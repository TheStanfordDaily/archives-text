German terrorist suspects seized
Bonn, West Germany — Yugoslavia has seized four of
West Germany's most-wanted terrorist suspects, includ
ing a woman with reported ties to the Red Brigades
murderers of former Italian premier Aldo Moro, the
Bonn government said yesterday.
Informed sources said the two men and two women
were captured in Yugoslavia May 11, on the same day
that a fifth suspected German terrorist was seized at Orly
airport in Paris before he could board a plane for Zagreb,
Yugoslavia.
A Justice Ministry spokesman said the four were
among 20 alleged hard-core terrorists sought in a string
of political murders, including last year's kidnap-slaying
of industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer.
White refugees flee African city
Kinshasa, Zaire — White refugees fearful of a new rebel
invasion were reported fleeing Lubumbashi, capital of
Shaba Province, as Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko
flew to Morocco yesterday to seek military reinforce
ments against the rebel threat.
Western diplomatic sources said two French cargo
planes flew white women and children out of Lubum
bashi on Sunday.
A Belgian Embassy spokesman in Kinshasa and French
officials in Paris denied their governments were mount
ing an airlift of Europeans from the area. But the French
Foreign Ministry confirmed that "a few dozen wives and
children" had left Lubumbashi.
Beaches attract millions for holiday
Los Angeles — The nation's war dead were remem
bered yesterday on a hot, smoggy day that saw Califor
nia's beaches and highways jammed — the traffic toll
and the temperatures among the highest on record.
The mercury hit 99 degrees, the hottest May 29 in Los
Angeles history, surpassing the 97 posted in 1972. Trying
to beat the heat, at least two million people packed
beaches from San Diego to San Francisco, including
some 700,000 at Santa Monica alone.
With the heat came the smog. The Southern California
Air Quality Management District called a first-stage
smog alert yesterday. National Weather Service forecas
ter Don Gales said cooler temperatures would begin
moving into Southern California by tomorrow.
482 die in holiday traffic
Chicago— Traffic deaths for the Memorial Day
weekend soared past last year's total yesterday. By mid
night (PDT), 482 persons had been killed on the nation's
roads.
Last year, there were 432 deaths over the Memorial
Day weekend.
Bill to protect 'whistleblowers'
Washington — The Carter administration, responding
to congressional criticism, has agreed to add more pro
tection for "whistleblowers" to the president's civil ser
vice bill, several officials say.
Protection will be included for dissident employees
who make allegations of non-criminal waste, misman
agement or impropriety, provided they do so confiden
tially within the government.
This will be added to the protection against firing,
demotion or transfer which President Jimmy Carter
proposed three months ago for civil servants who go to
the news media or Congress to allege criminal acts or
rule violations by their colleagues or bosses.

FBI asked to identify black leader
Atlanta — The head of the Southern Christian Leader
ship Conference wants the FBI to identify the black
leader who reportedly was working with the bureau to
oust Martin Luther King Jr. as a civil rights leader.
"We plan to ask President Jimmy Carter to have the FBI
substantiate the fantastic claim or withdraw it," Joseph
Lowery said yesterday in a telephone interview.
Yesterday's Washington Post reported that a confi
dential FBI memo from 1964 indicates the bureau was
working with an unidentified black leader in trying to
replace King as a civil rights leader.
The black leader's name was deleted from the report,
the Post said. v
Cleveland mayor attacks opponents
Cleveland — Mayor Dennis Kucinich, one step closer
to facing a recall election, lashed out yesterday at oppo
nents who he said are "returning Cleveland to a moc
kery it has known" in the past.
The 31-year-old maverick Democrat attacked his cri
tics at a holiday news conference called after more signa
tures were submitted demanding his ouster and the city
council president announced plans to block Kucinich
appointments to regional boards.
"My administration has not hurt Cleveland," Kucinich
declared at the news conference. "It has consistently
worked to improve the city and its neighborhoods, but
the recall has hurt Cleveland, and it is returning Cleve
land to a mockery it has known under other administra
tions."
NATO summit talks open today
Washington — Top NATO leaders who assembled here
yesterday were concerned over expanding Soviet power
but determined to strengthen their defenses from the
Arctic to the Aegean.
The two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization sum
mit talks to be opened by President Jimmy Carter at the
Kennedy Center today will, however, range far beyond
present and future affairs of the alliance.
European and American diplomats reported the secret
exchanges also will focus on how NATO's 15 member
countries can best thwart Kremlin actions to advance
Soviet interests in Africa and other areas.
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security ad
viser, assailed the Soviets in a stinging attack yesterday
for what he said were their "shortsighted attempts to
exploit global difficulties."
Jarvis-Gann task force set up
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday
that he may ask local government and the private sector
for help in making $5 billion do the work of $12 billion, in
case Proposition 13 passes.
Brown convened a new task force yesterday to begin
planning for what he called "the most massive public
finance challenge in the entire country."
But the Democratic governor was still unsure that
Proposition 13, the Jarvis-Gann property tax initiative,
would win voter approval at the June 6 primary.
"I'm still hoping the people will turn it down. But if
they don't, I'll be ready to carry out their will in as
sensitive, human and thoughtful a way as I know how,"
Brown said.

Bill to protect 'whistleblowers'
Washington — The Carter administration, responding
to congressional criticism, has agreed to add more pro
tection for "whistleblowers" to the president's civil ser
vice bill, several officials say.
Protection will be included for dissident employees

demotion or transfer which President Jimmy Carter

the news media or Congress to allege criminal acts or
rule violations by their colleagues or bosses.

FBI asked to identify black leader
Atlanta — The head of the Southern Christian Leader
ship Conference wants the FBI to identify the black
leader who reportedly was working with the bureau to
oust Martin Luther King Jr. as a civil rights leader.
"We plan to ask President Jimmy Carter to have the FBI
substantiate the fantastic claim or withdraw it," Joseph
Lowery said yesterday in a telephone interview.
Yesterday's Washington Post reported that a confi
dential FBI memo from 1964 indicates the bureau was
working with an unidentified black leader in trying to
replace King as a civil rights leader.
The black leader's name was deleted from the report,
the Post said. v
Cleveland mayor attacks opponents
Cleveland — Mayor Dennis Kucinich, one step closer
to facing a recall election, lashed out yesterday at oppo
nents who he said are "returning Cleveland to a moc
kery it has known" in the past.
The 31-year-old maverick Democrat attacked his cri
tics at a holiday news conference called after more signa
tures were submitted demanding his ouster and the city
council president announced plans to block Kucinich
appointments to regional boards.
"My administration has not hurt Cleveland," Kucinich
declared at the news conference. "It has consistently
worked to improve the city and its neighborhoods, but
the recall has hurt Cleveland, and it is returning Cleve
land to a mockery it has known under other administra
tions."
NATO summit talks open today
Washington — Top NATO leaders who assembled here
yesterday were concerned over expanding Soviet power
but determined to strengthen their defenses from the
Arctic to the Aegean.
The two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization sum
mit talks to be opened by President Jimmy Carter at the
Kennedy Center today will, however, range far beyond
present and future affairs of the alliance.
European and American diplomats reported the secret
exchanges also will focus on how NATO's 15 member
countries can best thwart Kremlin actions to advance
Soviet interests in Africa and other areas.
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security ad
viser, assailed the Soviets in a stinging attack yesterday
for what he said were their "shortsighted attempts to
exploit global difficulties."
Jarvis-Gann task force set up
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday
that he may ask local government and the private sector
for help in making $5 billion do the work of $12 billion, in
case Proposition 13 passes.
Brown convened a new task force yesterday to begin
planning for what he called "the most massive public
finance challenge in the entire country."
But the Democratic governor was still unsure that
Proposition 13, the Jarvis-Gann property tax initiative,
would win voter approval at the June 6 primary.
"I'm still hoping the people will turn it down. But if
they don't, I'll be ready to carry out their will in as
sensitive, human and thoughtful a way as I know how,"
Brown said.

German terrorist suspects seized
Bonn, West Germany — Yugoslavia has seized four of
West Germany's most-wanted terrorist suspects, includ
ing a woman with reported ties to the Red Brigades
murderers of former Italian premier Aldo Moro, the
Bonn government said yesterday.
Informed sources said the two men and two women
were captured in Yugoslavia May 11, on the same day
that a fifth suspected German terrorist was seized at Orly
airport in Paris before he could board a plane for Zagreb,
Yugoslavia.
A Justice Ministry spokesman said the four were
among 20 alleged hard-core terrorists sought in a string
of political murders, including last year's kidnap-slaying
of industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer.
White refugees flee African city

Western diplomatic sources said two French cargo
planes flew white women and children out of Lubum
bashi on Sunday.
A Belgian Embassy spokesman in Kinshasa and French
officials in Paris denied their governments were mount

Foreign Ministry confirmed that "a few dozen wives and
children" had left Lubumbashi.

Angeles history, surpassing the 97 posted in 1972. Trying

With the heat came the smog. The Southern California
Air Quality Management District called a first-stage
smog alert yesterday. National Weather Service forecas
