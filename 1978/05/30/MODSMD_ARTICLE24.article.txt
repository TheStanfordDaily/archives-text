# May help schizophrenics
## Pauling champions vitamin C 
### David Parker 
"You can tell a quack because he
will promise to have a substance that
will improve your health no matter
what ails you. Well, I propose that
vitamin C is such a substance," Linus
Pauling told a standing-room-only
audience of 400 here Wednesday.
Pauling, an eminent chemist and
twice Nobel laureate, spoke on the
properties of ascorbic acid (vitamin
C), citing numerous studies indicat
ing vitamin C's effectiveness in
promoting good physical and mental
health.
"Most schizophrenics have ab
normally low body content of ascor
bic acid, niacin and pyridoxine,"
Pauling said. "Apparently schizop
hrenics possess high levels of induc
ible enzymes which are able to con
vert vitamin C into other less health
ful substances," he said. Large doses
of vitamin C for schizophrenics have
been shown in some cases to al
leviate or remedy symptoms of their
psychosis, Pauling said.
More dramatic than vitamin C's ef
fects on schizophrenics are Pauling's
claims of the vitamin's beneficial in
fluence on cancer and disease.

Pauling cited studies showing that
"concentrations of vitamin C in a test
tube equal to that found in the
bloodstream of a moderate user (2 to
4 grams per day) will deactivate
poliomyelitus, herpes simplex, foot
and mouth, viral hepatitis, rabies and
bacterial viruses."
"A dose of six grams of vitamin C
per day has been shown to signific
antly lower subjects' susceptibility to
a wide range of conditions including
measles, mumps, diphtheria, tuber
culosis, whooping cough,
pneumonia, dysentery, etc.," he
said.
"Studies of patients with cancer of
the colon, stomach, bronchus,
breast, kidney, bladder, rectum or
ovary have indicated 300-plus days of
added life expectancy for those on
high (10 to 50 grams per day) vitamin
C intake," Pauling said.
He cited an early 1970 study by
Cameron and Pauling in which 500
terminally ill cancer patients were
given 10 to 50 grams of vitamin C per
day versus a control group of 1000
carefully matched patients receiving
no vitamin C. Fifty times as many of
the vitamin C group lived more than

one year. Some of the patients in this
group are still alive while all 1000 in
the control group have died.
"The evidence of these studies as
well as certain animal studies indi
cate that human intake of vitamin C
should be around 10 grams per day,
or at least 2 to 4 grams per day at a
minimum," Pauling said. Despite his
work, the Food and Nutrition Board
(FNB) continues to suggest a recom
mended daily allowance of vitamin C
at only .045 grams per day, 2 per cent
of Pauling's suggested lower limit of
two grams per day.
Pauling blames the great discre
pancy between his and the FNB's re
commended daily allowance for vit
amin C on two factors. First, practic
ing doctors and nutritionists rarely
have enough time to read the litera
ture and weigh the pro-vitamin C
evidence. Secondly, the FNB itself
has suffered from poorly thought
out actions.
"Often they have misconstrued
and misrepresented the evidence
which I have presented to them or
which exists in the literature," Paul
ing said.
