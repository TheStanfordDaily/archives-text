1300 stadium seats eliminated
Nearly 1300 seats in the top row of
Stanford stadium have been lost due
to the installation of a new security
fence.
The fence is a safety measure to
prevent fans from sitting atop or
leaning back against the stadium's
outside wall, according to Bob
Young, associate athletic director.
The fence was completed last week.
"The parapet wall of the stadium
has weakened slightly over the
years," Young said. "The new fence
on the top row will serve as a perma
nent security barrier to prevent con
tact with the wall."
The metal chain link fence was in
stalled on the footboard of the
stadium's top row, No. 80. It rises six
feet above row 79.
With the loss of 1294 seats in row
80, the capacity of the stadium has
become 85,013.
Young said a recent inspection
showed the 59-year-old stadium to
be "in very good shape."
Dead eucalyptus trees
Governor's Lane near the Stanford
golf course and driving range is look
ing somewhat devastated these days,
a sad result of the recent three-year
drought.
Approximately 100 dead eucalyp
tus trees in that area and elsewhere

on the campus have been felled and
carted off for pulp or firewood.
In the case of Governor's Lane, the
trees were logged free of cost to the
University, according to Herb Fong,
supervisor of grounds for Plant Ser
vices. The Holm and James Logging
Co. of Santa Rosa offered to do the
job in exchange for the wood.
This and all other logged areas on
the campus will be replanted next fall
with "eucalyptus globulus" or blue
gum, the Australian native eucalyp
tus most commonly found in
California, Fong said.
They will be watered regularly by
water truck now that the drought is
over, Fong said. They will grow at
least five feet per year, he said.
At the height of the drought last
year, Fong estimated that between
300 to 500 trees on the campus would
die because of the drought or old age
or both. Most were eucalyptus,
which will be replaced as needed, he
indicated.
Volunteering at hospital
An introductory presentation on
volunteering for the Children's Hos
pital at Stanford will be held today
from 6 to 7 p.m. in Faber Auditorium
at the hospital located at 520 Willow
Road.
All interested persons at least 18
years of age and willing to pledge a

commitment of time and energy to
constructive patient care and sup
port services are urged to attend. For

Marguerite honored
Stanford's free bus system, the
Marguerite, was one of the reci
pients of 1978 Transportation Awards
presented by the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission Wed
nesday during ceremonies at the
Lake Merritt BART station in Oak
land.
The Marguerite links student living
areas and parking lots with activity
centers on campus. It is named for a
horse that pulled a passenger wagon
from Palo Alto to Stanford around
the turn of the century.
The City of Palo Alto was also hon
ored for a study of transportation
problems. Some recommendations
from that survey have.been adopted
by the Santa Clara Transit district and
cities in the area.
ASSU divestment
In its last meeting of the year, the
ASSU Senate will consider divesting
its stock from the University merge
pool tonight at 7:30 in the Business
School, room 75. Fred Grethel, se
nate chairperson, said last night that
he encourages all senators to attend.
