# Undergraduate costs keep pace with rising family income levels
## 
### Janet Bailey 
Although tuition at Stanford rises
every year, University budget plan
ners say the cost of sending an un
dergraduate to school here keeps
pace with family income.
Tuition next year will be $5130, a
9.3 per cent increase from the cur
rent tuition of $4695. The figure for
1978-79 represents a 3.3 per cent
"real" increase, according to As
sociate Provost Wayne Price.
Price, in charge of the University's
operating and consolidated budgets,
said tuition is expected to increase by
6 per cent annually "no matter what"
because of inevitable increases in
staff salaries, equipment and infla
tion.
However, a recent report cited in
the operating budget guidelines for
next year shows that over a 10-year
period, University costs did not in
crease faster than family income.
"Parental ability to pay is expected
to grow by 8 per cent as a consequ
ence of normal increase in personal
income and assets," the guidelines
state.
Tuition increased faster
Tuition has increased slightly fas
ter than family income since 1974-75,
according to Price. In 1976, tuition
rose 12 per cent â€” from $3375 to
$3810. Since then there has been an
effort to monitor and lower the rate
of increase.
Budget guidelines indicate that
long-term plans should show "a
close relationship, not a widening
gap, between the rates of increase of
costs and affordability."

"Over a period of time, educa
tional costs seem to be consuming a
stable percentage of family in
comes," Price said. "We would be
worried if the percentage were in
creasing."
50 per cent of budget
Tuition and fee income from all
graduate and undergraduate schools
provides 50 per cent of the total in
come for the University's operating
budget of $118 million.

31 per cent of the University's overall
or consolidated budget. It includes
all the University's unrestricted in
come, as well as basic expenses of
departments, student services and
administration.
The "close relationship" between
college costs and family income in
creases is greatly assisted by financial
aid and loan programs.
3050 on aid
Next year's budget estimates that
increases in tuition, room and board
will total $1,930,650 for the 3050 stu
dents on financial aid. Scholarship
and grant aid to undergraduates dur
ing the same period should total
$11,250,000, representing an in
crease of about $1,100,000 over this

year's total.
University policy calls for student
self-help to rise as the student
budget rises. Total self-help income
will increase by $442,500 next year.
The budget for individual students
should be about $8000 next year. Ten
per cent of this figure is expected to
be through loans and 15 per cent
through work/study jobs.
Admissions records appear to
support the view that rising costs are
not driving potential students away
from the University. Over the past
eight years, about 38 per cent of
those students accepted have not
enrolled here. Of course, 75-82 per
cent enrolled in schools as expensive
or more expensive than Stanford,
Price said.
"If there were a dramatic turn in
this, we'd be concerned," he added.
Admissions separate
Stanford has a policy of separating
admissions from financial aid deci
sions. The policy reflects a "funda
mental concern with making sure
prices charged here don't show the
kind of class you would get with re
spect to socioeconomic position,"
Price said.
Even if rising costs keep pace with
family income, however, budget
planners have no way of knowing
how many potential applicants are
deterred from applying by rising
costs before they can find out about
the availability of financial aid.
"That is a concern," Price admit
ted. "It's possible that some parts of
the population might be screening
themselves out."
