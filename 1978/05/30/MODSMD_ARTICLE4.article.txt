## House to debate tuition credits 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The House is finally coming to
grips with issues kept alive for years without a vote:
whether tax credits for tuition costs should be allowed
and what schooling costs should be eligible.
The long-postponed debate is scheduled to begin to
morrow after the House returns from its Memorial Day
break.
The Senate is continuing its recess all week.
The House debate will come on a bill that would allow
direct subtraction from income tax owed of up to $250 of
college or vocational school tuition and on an amend
ment for credits of up to $100 for tuition in lower
schools.
No votes are expected before Thursday.
President Jimmy Carter and a number of educational,
minority and civil rights groups oppose the legislation,
but the House Republican Policy Committee and some
educational groups support it, including those who
speak for church-affiliated schools.
The bill would allow a taxpayer an income tax credit
equal to 25 per cent of the cost of college or other
post-secondary tuition, up to a total of $100 this year,
$150 in 1979 and $250 in 1980 per student. The program
would end then unless continued by Congress.

The House Rules Committee recommended that votes
be allowed on three amendments.
One amendment would provide credits for tuition to
private elementary and secondary schools, with
maximums of $50 in 1978, and $100 each year in 1979 and
1980. Another amendment would raise the basis of the
deduction to 50 per cent of tuition but maintain the same
ceilings. The third would be a substitute for the whole
bill.
Instead of credits, it would provide low-cost loans in
the form of tax deferrals for post-secondary tuition only,
beginning with the second year of college or equivalent
education.
Beginning Aug. 1, a taxpayer would be allowed to
defer up to $1000 per student per year, with the figure
rising to $1500 in 1982 and $2000 in 1986. The deferred
amounts would be paid back over a 10-year period at 3
per cent interest.
Carter recommended, instead of tax credits, a $1.2
billion expansion of current student aid programs with
provisions that would make families with as much as
$25,000 annual income eligible for some grants. The
House refused to consider such a bill under special
speedup procedures.
