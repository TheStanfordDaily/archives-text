## Horace Greeley revisited 
### 
Dan Harrison

Horace Greeley once said tq some
aspiring young adventurer, "Go
west, young man." And since some
one once thought enough of him to
name my high school in his honor, I
thought that it might be appropriate
to follow his advice. After all, Horace
seemed to be on top of things during
his day; he couldn't be-handing out
bad advice.
So here I am in California. My dis
tinctive New York license plates bet
ray my unfortunate origins to all
those who think of easterners as
cold, up-tight, and indifferent, as
well as being bad drivers.
To them, it seems that anyone who
lives east of Chicago is in the center
of crime, decay, fuel shortages, and
blackouts. There are a lot of haughty
Californians with that attitude;
people who exhibit the same sort of
regional chauvinism which is attri
buted to Easterners.
Like Rome and Constantinople
centuries earlier, New York and Los
Angeles are duelling for the position
of eminence in our present day em
pire. One can hardly turn on a T.V.
without being inundated with
Southern Californian attitudes, lifes
tyles, and maxims. Between Adam-12
and the Brady Bunch, middle
America must lie somewhere on
Sunset Bl.vd.
If omnipresent Television isn't
powerful enough to spread the good
news, the opiate pleasures in van
ning, skate-boarding, and surfing are
certainly compelling arguments for
becoming a Californian.
On the other hand, it is hard to go
through a day without hearing word
Irom New York, either from the
Stock Exchange or from some miscel
laneous policy maker. Even venera
ble Walter Cronkite broadcasts from
New York; can he be that wrong?
Image problem
New York has an image problem
here in the Golden State. I have been
hearing more of the cliches about
muggings, dirt, cab drivers, the
weather, etc. than I've ever heard be
lore. It seems to be in fashion here to
proclaim one's loathing of New York
and its satellites, as though it is a
manifestation of a cultural inferiority
complex.
Having finally convinced the rest
of the country that California is not
the boondocks, Californians and
their government seem bent on mov
ing the power base of the nation
westward to reflect the new-found
importance of the West. Los Angeles
vies with New York for the honor of
hosting the Olympics, being the
largest city in the country, being the
capital of entertainment, and so on.
The competition is keen and spirits
are high. But despite years of combat

training, Californians still talk about
going "back East" to visit relatives —
as though they still thought of the
East as the place they came from —
and they still buy the New York Times
when they feel like reading a good
newspaper. But to them, the East is
still a dying area paying for its own
cruelty.
Alive and well
I assure you that New York is alive
and well and still is the most exciting
place in the world to live in, on top of
being the centerof the universe. Ever
since I walked inside Grand Central
Station as a boy and stood beneath
the huge vaulted ceiling in the main
concourse, I've been in awe of New
York City.
I've learned to laugh at its idiosyn
cracies, wretch at its injustices, and
marvel at its wonders. But above all,
I've learned to respect New York and
its inhabitants.
It takes a lot of drive to live in New
York. People there aren't cold, they
are just fighting against the city and
enjoying it. It is sure that New York
can overwhelm you, but the secret of
New York is the way you work against
it; against the impersonality of gothic
arches and grey granite, against the
insanity of cab drivers and the ran
dom edicts of traffic lights.
Many rewards
But New York rewards her sparring
partners by supporting the finest re
staurants, the center of commercial
theatre, the best in classical music
ensembles, and of course the world
champions in baseball — as well as
Charlie's Calypso World in Brooklyn
and the Bottom Line tavern in
Greenwich Village, or any one of the
thousand other interesting places to
go. You pay a price for living in New
York, but you also collect many be
nefits.
New York is not going to give up
her status without a fight. Radio sta
tions already give out "I love New
York" bumper-stickers and the vis
itor's bureau has an advertising cam
paign to improve the image of the
city to both people and corporations,
and the latter are being encouraged
to stay in the city with promises of tax
breaks.
Lots of pride left
There still is a great amount of
pride in the oldest chartered city in
the United States; although it can
admit to a "Boss" Tweed, it also
points with justification to its
nickname; The Big Apple.
I know that the San Francisco orbit
is far removed from Los Angeles.
(I've even seen some intrastate
chauvinism from Northern Califor
nians who don't get into that plastic
L.A. scene.) But San Franciscans, like
Bostonians, are fond of cultivating a

collective elitism about their cities.
Smaller and more personable than
their big sisters, they can boast of the
best of both worlds: the advantages
of a city with the amiability of the
country. But potholes seem the
same in Boston as in New York and
the lane divider bumps still make the
same obnoxious sound in Los
Angeles as they do here.
Common factor
There is a common factor some
where. Perhaps climate, perhaps
heritage, perhaps something else
again, it is difficult to pinpoint the
cultural differences between the two
coasts although we all acknowledge
their existence. It is hard to be objec
tive about your home.
My advice to Californians who
think that the East should sever itself
from the rest of the country is that
you spend a couple of years there,
not just a few months. See what it is
like to be an Easterner. Although I'm
sure that you'll miss the sunshine*
you might find that riding in a subway
is just as fun as cruising on the free
way, or that a blizzard in New York or
Boston is just as much adventure as
camping in the Sierra Nevada.
To my fellow Easterners: follow
Horace Greeley's advice; there is a
lot to be said for sunshine and warm
weather. As for me: even though I'm
going to be here for a while, I'm still
going to keep my New York license
plates.
