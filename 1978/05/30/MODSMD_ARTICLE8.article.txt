Giving credit
I viewed a videotape of last Thurs
day's KZSU power increase celebra
tion. When the station manager Jon
Morris gave credit and thanks to
those people involved in the power
increase, he neglected to mention
Ron Kwang, KZSU's current chief en
gineer, as the person responsible for
coordinating and doing the technical
work required to make the power
jump.
Kwang has spent a lot of his spare
time listening to the transmission

and making adjustments to get the
great sound that KZSU transmits.
I asked Morris why he skipped
over Kwang's name. Morris told me
that Kwang had expressed the opin
ion that Mark Lawrence, KZSU's
soon-to-be chief engineer, should
be thanked above all others since
Lawrence has been working at KZSU
for ten years. Kwang is too modest.
He puts a lot of himself into his
work and is experimenting con
stantly to improve the quality of
KZSU's transmission. I know Kwang

because I have worked with him at
the Stanford Instructional Television
Network for the past three years.
He works full time at SITVN and
devotes the rest of his time to KZSU.
Kwang worked hard to engineer the
power increase. He also did an excel
lent job. I think that it is only fair that
the community acknowledge his
contribution to the power increase
and thank him.
