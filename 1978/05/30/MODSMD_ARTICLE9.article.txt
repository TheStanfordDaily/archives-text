# ERA: a gain for human rights here
##

While our attention is being directed to strug
gles for human rights in the Mideast, South Africa,
the Soviet Union and numerous other parts of the
world, many of us here have lost sight of a human
rights issue which directly affects us as citizens of
the United States: the United States Constitution,
in its present form, does not guarantee equal
rights for both women and men.
The Equal Rights Amendment, as passed by the
U.S. Congress in 1972, states, "Equality of rights
under the law shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any state on account of
sex."
Thirty-five states have already ratified the ERA.
Three more states must do so in order for it to
become part of the Constitution. The current
deadline for ratification is March 22, 1979.
Obtaining passage
Proponents of the ERA have launched a mul
tifaceted campaign for passage of the amendment,
focusing on both politicians and the public. The
campaign includes lobbying of legislators from
states that have not yet ratified the ERA, and a
program of educational publicitiy to maintain the
public's knowledge of ana interest in the a
mendment. (Every public opinion poll on the sub
ject indicates that a majority of Americans are in
favor of the ERA.)
Candidates for legislative positions in non
ratified states who have committed themselves to
supporting the ERA are being backed by pro-ERA
organizations and individuals. Supporters in
ratified states are directing theirefforts into raising
money for pro-ERA candidates and educational
campaigns in not yet ratified states.
Economic boycott successful
An economic boycott of states that have not
ratified the ERA is proving to be a successful
technique in the pro-ERA campaign. Well over 100

educational, religious, political, social, legal,
minority and labor organizations are supporting
this boycott by refusing to hold conventions in the
non-ratified states.
These organizations range from the American
Association of University Professors (AAUP) to the
National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, the
United Presbyterian Church to the United Auto
Workers.
Santa Clara County, along with other cities and
counties nationwide, has passed a resolution
supporting the boycott.
This boycott has had significant impact in
Florida, Illinois and Nevada, states which rely
heavily on their tourist and convention industries.
The other non-ratified states are: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missis
sippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Utah and Virginia.
A continuation of the economic boycott until
successful ratification of the ERA may convince
these states' legislators that refusing women
equality under the law is not a profitable en
deavor.
H.J.R. 638
Another important component of the pro-ERA
campaign is House ludiciary Resolution (H.J.R.)
638, which would extend the deadline for ratifica
tion to March 22, 1986. Supporters of this exten
sion believe that the extensive political maneuver
ing around the ERA has obscured the real issue:
equal rights for women and men. The seven-year
extension would allow time for more objective
debate and bring the issue back to its proper
focus.
H.J.R. 638. is presently under consideration by
the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and
Constitutional Rights, and is expected to reach the
House for a floor vote in July. Representative Don

Edwards of California's 13th District is chair of that
subcommittee. It is essential that he, and all our
legislators, recognize our desire to give the ERA
the necessary time to ensure ratification.
It is our individual responsibility as educated
members of a democracy to articulate that con
cern, by sending a postcard to each of them with a
statement in favor of extension.
Today at 8 p.m. a teach-in on the ERA and its
legal implications will be held at Bishop Au
ditorium. This teach-in, organized by students in
Undergraduate Special 77, "Women's Rights and
Political Organization/ will provide the commun
ity with a chance to discuss the ERA with people of
expertise on the issue.
Justifying exclusion
Most of us are enraged when confronted with
racism, discrimination on account of religious or
ethnic background, or exploitation of the Ameri
can working class. Women, the 51 per cent-of
the-population "minority," are not guaranteed
full rights under the Constitution in its present
form. How can any one of us justify this exclusion
of women from the Constitution?
The Equal Rights Amendment is not an issue of
concern to women exclusively. It is an issue of
human rights. The ERA promises equaltiy under
the law regardless of sex. Only 16 states have state
equal rights amendments. Unless the ERA be
comes part of the Constitution, women and men
throughout the United States may remain victims
of discrimination on the basis of sex.
Our battles against mistreatment and depriva
tion of any group of people, anywhere in the
world, should persist. But our demands forhuman
rights in other nations are baseless until we have
procured those same human rights forourselves.
