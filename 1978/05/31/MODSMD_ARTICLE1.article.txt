# Students quit to protest firing

### Jon Hornsby 
Two students quit their jobs at Tre
sidder bowling alley last Wednesday
to protest the previous day's firing of
long-time games manager John
Buckmaster.
Dave Wood and Gary Can, along
with a former worker, Bob Siedel,
stated in a letter to the Daily that they
"are so sickened by this callous act
that we can no longer work for Tre
sidder."
The decision to dismiss Buckmas
ter, who had worked at the bowling
alley for 14 years, was made almost a
month after he was hospitalized
from a job-related car accident.
After lengthy discussions with Dan
Williams, director of Tresidder, Ellie
Oppenheim, assistant director of
Tresidder, made the decision to fire
Buckmaster. Williams said he fully
supported her decision.
Oppenheim said her office con
ducted interviews to find a tempor
ary replacement but, "it was an tin

successful search.
"We waited about as long as we
could have," she said, "and we
looked at lots of alternatives."
But she and Williams said they felt
firing Buckmaster was the best move.
Oppenheim explained, "We need
management to keep the bowling
alley in operation, to do the planning
and the organization work. We can't
do this without ongoing help."
Wood said he thought the move
was untimely and immoral. He said
he believes the decision was a hard
one, but "it never should have even
been considered.
"The timing was awful," he said.
"All sorts of things have been hap
pening to John."
He explained that about a month
ago, Buckmaster's brother died in
Los Angeles after a long illness.
"John is 58 years old and a diabe
tic; he was badly shaken by his
brother's death," Wood said. "Two
weeks later he was broadsided by a

truck while delivering papers for Tre
sidder, a task he performed as a
favor, and suffered a broken pelvis
and broken ribs."
Buckmaster said the doctor esti
mated he would be out of work for 12
to 16 weeks.
Wood said he applied for the job of
temporary manager to replace
Buckmaster, but was turned down.
He said he suggested to Op
penheim that since Buckmaster
would be drawing full salary in vaca
tion and sick leave payments,
perhaps the man could assume the
title of assistant manager while
another head manager was hired.
Buckmaster could then be phased
out later on in the year instead of
now while he is in a state of trauma.
Oppenheirn said she considered
the issue of timing along with many
other options. She declined to dis
cuss Wood's suggestion.
Williams said he considered
Wood's suggestion to be deceptive.
"It's not a very honest, straightfor
ward way tf> do business," he said.
He added that he was aware of
Buckmaster's recent mishaps but he
considered honesty and openness to
be humanitarian ways of dealing with
the issue.
James Lyons, dean of student af
fairs, said Wood's alternative would
raise doubt about the respon
sibilities, authority and prerogatives
of a new manager.
Buckmaster said he didn't know
exactly why he was fired, and was
"put off" by the action.
When Wood found out about the
firing, he said he immediately gave
two weeks notice of resignation.
He said when Can heard the news,
"I thought he was going to hit some

body, he was so mad."
Can said he talked to Oppenheim
and "what she said really didn't hold
water." He gave notice on the spot.
Out of about nine students
employed in the bowling alley three
have quit and three are on the verge
of quitting, Wood said.
He added the work time of the
three who quit makes up over half of
the operating hours and if the other
three leave "maybe 90 per cent pre
sent worker hours will be gone."
Can said two of the other students
at the bowling alley had been re

cently hired and didn't know
Buckmaster.
The resigning students said their
actions didn't faze Oppenheim.
She and Williams said they would not
reconsider their decision.
Wood said some people were try
ing to get Buckmaster reinstated but
that he is skeptical of their success.
He added he wishes them good luck.
Buckmaster said a friend from Un
ited Stanford Employees is going to
advise him on what moves to make in
the near future.. Buckmaster, how
ever, is not a union member.
