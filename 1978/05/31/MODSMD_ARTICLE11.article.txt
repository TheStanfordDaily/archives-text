# Students plan bike tour from Minnesota to Peru
## features 
### Mindy Mayer 
Cycling through the
deepest, darkest wilds of
White Plaza where savage
beasts and people are likely to
pop out from behind kiosks is
an experience we all go
through here.
Now two students, appetites
obviously whetted by such en
counters, have decided to take
the whole experience further
— to South America, to be
exact.
Starting next month, Mark
Boyar and Pam Krone will bike
from the headwaters of the
Mississippi River in Minnesota
to the headwaters of the Ama
zon River at Lake Titicaca, bet
ween Bolivia and Peru. Boyar is
a sophomore majoring in in
ternational relations, and
Krone is a graduating senior
majoring in chemical engineer
ing. They estimate they will
cover approximately 7000 miles
in six months, returning by
spring quarter, or next year at
the latest.
Their journey will begin with
a rendezvous with two of
Boyar's friends in Minnesota.
From there they will pedal
south to New Orleans, fly to
Jamaica, and bike across the is
land to a boat that will take
them to Colombia.
Greater challenge
Once in South America, the
terrain and weather conditions
will provide a bit more of a
challenge. Boyar said his group
will hit Peru during its rainy
season, as well as approxi
mately 1500 miles of desert —
some of which hasn't received
rain in 15 years — in full sum
mer and 100 degree heat
After covering Colombia,
the group will begin the slow
ascent up and over the 17,000-
foot summit of the Andes,

which overlooks South Ameri
ca's largest lake, Lake Titicaca.
Boyar estimates he and his
friends will spend two-thirds of
their trip in the Andes, which
stretch the length of the conti
nent. This will make the ad
justment to the thin air at the
top relatively painless. After
this, they plan to coast dow
nhill and into Bolivia, where
they will catch a flight for the
United States.
For Boyar, who cycled a
round the world (15,000 miles)
after graduating from high
school, this trip will be the
equivalent of a jaunt to the

corner drugstore. When asked
if he was training, Boyar re
plied, "Oh, I run three or four
times a week, but really it's the
ride from Minnesota to New
Orleans that'll get us into
shape."
Biggest worries
Boyar's biggest worries are
traffic and dysentary. Although
there isn't much traffic along
his route, except in the
capitals, Boyar discovered on
his world tour that road rules
and cyclers' rights are almost
universally disregarded. Of all
the drivers he's encountered,
Boyar found Indian truckdriv

ers to be the most reckless.
"They're worse than Italians
— I think they drive with their
eyes closed. They'll pass com
ing right at you, or change a tire
in the middle of the road and
expect you to go around. If it
hadn't been for my quick reac
tions, I'd have been killed
hundreds of times," Boyar
said.
As for dysentary, it is more of
a discomfort and embarrass
ment than a danger; according
to Boyar, the only major medi
cal mishap suffered by his
group was a hernia, which re
portedly sprung loose in
Algeria.
Boyar is equally uncon
cerned about political upheav
als. He has cycled through the
Golan Heights, India during
Ghandi's "emergency," Af
ghanistan just after a coup
d'etat, and Thailand after the
student rebellion.
Boyar found that the United
States' image was generally
good where he cycled. Many
people, especially students in
the more repressed countries
such as Iran, looked on the
group of Americans as a possi
ble ticket to freedom, he said.
America's image
"It makes me sad to think
that America's image is often
better than deserved," he said.
Boyar also said he and his
friend found several com
munities in Central Asia, East
Iran, and Afghanistan that had

never heard of the United
States.
Krone and Boyar plan to al
ternate in ten-day cycles bet
ween riding and visiting sites
such as Cuzco, the old Inca
capitol. They will carry sleep
ing gear, and buy meals along
the way. Judging by the 300
correspondents Boyar gained
on his last trip, hospitality
won't be a problem.
However, "when you're a
tourist in the city, they want
your money, and you're not as
much a person as something to
make money off of," Boyar
said.
Although barbecued
beefhearts generally taste a lit
tle strange to Westernized pa
lates, with a few minor excep
tions, food problems were few
and far between on the world
tour.
Exceptions
One exception, however,
was in Tunisia. "There was one
time I wanted a ham and
cheese sandwich and some
Frosted Flakes in Tunisia,"
Boyar said. "For three days
that's all my friend and I talked
about. When we finally took a
boat to Italy, the first thing we
did was sit down on the dock
and gorge out on ham and
cheese and Frosted Flakes. We
got ourselves sick."
Boyar admits that cycling all
day for several months can be
come boring. "After three
months on the road, nothing

comes into your head —
you've done all the fantasizing
you can," he said.
"You'll be biking along for
an hour or so, and all of a sud
den you'll snap out of it and say
'Hey, what have I been think
ing about?' Nothing. I guess it's
sort of equivalent to medita
tion — or like driving a car for a
whole day," Boyar said.
At various times Boyar has
resorted to memorizing
poetry, playing the harmonica,
and even reading (by attaching
a book to the handlebars), to
entertain himself. He also did
isometric exercises for awhile,
he said, because despite the
biking, his "upper body had
become a marshmallow."
Risk involved
Certainly one of the larger
risks involved in taking off with
a small group of friends for
several months of intense
companionship is that you may
not return friends. For in
stance, a total of nine students
left on Boyar's world tour, but
only four completed the jour
ney, and one had a nervous
breakdown after five months.
To avoid a repetition of this,
Boyar, Krone, and their friends
will alternate leadership re
sponsibilities and will distance
themselves as they bike. Get
ting lost won't be a problem,
Boyar said, because there are
so few roads in South America.
"If you're going south in
Ecuador, well, you're on the
road that goes south in
Ecuador, and it's pretty hard to
get off."
Unlike his last tour, for
which he studied Arabic for
two years, Boyar anticipates
few language difficulties. Ex

cept for a few villages that still
speak in Indian dialects, the
majority of South Americans
speak Spanish, with a heavy
sprinkling of English.
Foreigners' English
Boyar and his comrades
learned not to depend on
foreign-spoken English, how
ever, after an incident in
Algeria in which they were un
able to understand a word of
the local English teacher's En
glish.
Although they claim that
theirs will be the first journey
along the route they've cho
sen, Krone and Boyar are not
interested in setting any re
cords. When asked if he didn't
secretly yearn after an entry in
the Guinness Book of World
Records, Boyar replied that had
that been the case, they
wouldn't have made it.
"We met a guy on his way
from Chicago to Los Angeles
on a unicycle," he said. "He'd
be the type to make it. We
aren't crazy enough."
Then what is it that impels
Mark Boyar and Pam Krone to
sweat and toil for six months to
reach a destination that could
be reached by airplane in one
day? It's not just the physical
challenge, they maintain. Nor
is it merely the scenery, the
cocoa leaves or Boyar's major.
It's a lot of things, Boyar said,
but most of all it's the people.
"I'm happiest when I'm se
eing the real world," Boyar
said. "You don't get any feeling
for the country when you go by
car or bus. Seventy-five per
cent of the people live in the
country. That's the real
people; that's the real coun
try."

such as Cuzco, the old Inca
capitol. They will carry sleep
ing gear, and buy meals along
the way. Judging by the 300
correspondents Boyar gained
on his last trip, hospitality
won't be a problem.
However, "when you're a
tourist in the city, they want
your money, and you're not as
much a person as something to
make money off of," Boyar
said.
Although barbecued
beefhearts generally taste a lit
tle strange to Westernized pa
lates, with a few minor excep
tions, food problems were few
and far between on the world
tour.
Exceptions
One exception, however,
was in Tunisia. "There was one
time I wanted a ham and
cheese sandwich and some
Frosted Flakes in Tunisia,"
Boyar said. "For three days
that's all my friend and I talked
about. When we finally took a
boat to Italy, the first thing we
did was sit down on the dock
and gorge out on ham and
cheese and Frosted Flakes. We
got ourselves sick."
Boyar admits that cycling all
day for several months can be
come boring. "After three
months on the road, nothing

comes into your head —
you've done all the fantasizing
you can," he said.
"You'll be biking along for
an hour or so, and all of a sud
den you'll snap out of it and say
'Hey, what have I been think
ing about?' Nothing. I guess it's
sort of equivalent to medita
tion — or like driving a car for a
whole day," Boyar said.
At various times Boyar has
resorted to memorizing
poetry, playing the harmonica,
and even reading (by attaching
a book to the handlebars), to
entertain himself. He also did
isometric exercises for awhile,
he said, because despite the
biking, his "upper body had
become a marshmallow."
Risk involved
Certainly one of the larger
risks involved in taking off with
a small group of friends for
several months of intense
companionship is that you may
not return friends. For in
stance, a total of nine students
left on Boyar's world tour, but
only four completed the jour
ney, and one had a nervous
breakdown after five months.
To avoid a repetition of this,
Boyar, Krone, and their friends
will alternate leadership re
sponsibilities and will distance
themselves as they bike. Get
ting lost won't be a problem,
Boyar said, because there are
so few roads in South America.
"If you're going south in
Ecuador, well, you're on the
road that goes south in
Ecuador, and it's pretty hard to
get off."
Unlike his last tour, for
which he studied Arabic for
two years, Boyar anticipates
few language difficulties. Ex

cept for a few villages that still
speak in Indian dialects, the
majority of South Americans
speak Spanish, with a heavy
sprinkling of English.
Foreigners' English
Boyar and his comrades
learned not to depend on
foreign-spoken English, how
ever, after an incident in
Algeria in which they were un
able to understand a word of
the local English teacher's En
glish.
Although they claim that
theirs will be the first journey
along the route they've cho
sen, Krone and Boyar are not
interested in setting any re
cords. When asked if he didn't
secretly yearn after an entry in
the Guinness Book of World
Records, Boyar replied that had
that been the case, they
wouldn't have made it.
"We met a guy on his way
from Chicago to Los Angeles
on a unicycle," he said. "He'd
be the type to make it. We
aren't crazy enough."
Then what is it that impels
Mark Boyar and Pam Krone to
sweat and toil for six months to
reach a destination that could
be reached by airplane in one
day? It's not just the physical
challenge, they maintain. Nor
is it merely the scenery, the
cocoa leaves or Boyar's major.
It's a lot of things, Boyar said,
but most of all it's the people.
"I'm happiest when I'm se
eing the real world," Boyar
said. "You don't get any feeling
for the country when you go by
car or bus. Seventy-five per
cent of the people live in the
country. That's the real
people; that's the real coun
try."

Sophomore Mark Boyar is preparing for a 7000-mile bike trip from
Minnesota to Peru. Senior Pam Krone wiII also be making the journey,
expected to take six months.
Cycling through the
deepest, darkest wilds of
White Plaza where savage
beasts and people are likely to
pop out from behind kiosks is
an experience we all go
through here.
Now two students, appetites
obviously whetted by such en
counters, have decided to take
the whole experience further
— to South America, to be
exact.
Starting next month, Mark
Boyar and Pam Krone will bike
from the headwaters of the
Mississippi River in Minnesota
to the headwaters of the Ama
zon River at Lake Titicaca, bet
ween Bolivia and Peru. Boyar is
a sophomore majoring in in
ternational relations, and
Krone is a graduating senior
majoring in chemical engineer
ing. They estimate they will
cover approximately 7000 miles
in six months, returning by
spring quarter, or next year at
the latest.
Their journey will begin with
a rendezvous with two of
Boyar's friends in Minnesota.
From there they will pedal
south to New Orleans, fly to
Jamaica, and bike across the is
land to a boat that will take
them to Colombia.
Greater challenge
Once in South America, the
terrain and weather conditions
will provide a bit more of a
challenge. Boyar said his group
will hit Peru during its rainy
season, as well as approxi
mately 1500 miles of desert —
some of which hasn't received
rain in 15 years — in full sum
mer and 100 degree heat
After covering Colombia,
the group will begin the slow
ascent up and over the 17,000-
foot summit of the Andes,

which overlooks South Ameri
ca's largest lake, Lake Titicaca.
Boyar estimates he and his
friends will spend two-thirds of
their trip in the Andes, which
stretch the length of the conti
nent. This will make the ad
justment to the thin air at the
top relatively painless. After
this, they plan to coast dow
nhill and into Bolivia, where
they will catch a flight for the
United States.
For Boyar, who cycled a
round the world (15,000 miles)
after graduating from high
school, this trip will be the
equivalent of a jaunt to the

corner drugstore. When asked
if he was training, Boyar re
plied, "Oh, I run three or four
times a week, but really it's the
ride from Minnesota to New
Orleans that'll get us into
shape."
Biggest worries
Boyar's biggest worries are
traffic and dysentary. Although
there isn't much traffic along
his route, except in the
capitals, Boyar discovered on
his world tour that road rules
and cyclers' rights are almost
universally disregarded. Of all
the drivers he's encountered,
Boyar found Indian truckdriv

ers to be the most reckless.
"They're worse than Italians
— I think they drive with their
eyes closed. They'll pass com
ing right at you, or change a tire
in the middle of the road and
expect you to go around. If it
hadn't been for my quick reac
tions, I'd have been killed
hundreds of times," Boyar
said.
As for dysentary, it is more of
a discomfort and embarrass
ment than a danger; according
to Boyar, the only major medi
cal mishap suffered by his
group was a hernia, which re
portedly sprung loose in
Algeria.
Boyar is equally uncon
cerned about political upheav
als. He has cycled through the
Golan Heights, India during
Ghandi's "emergency," Af
ghanistan just after a coup
d'etat, and Thailand after the
student rebellion.
Boyar found that the United
States' image was generally
good where he cycled. Many
people, especially students in
the more repressed countries
such as Iran, looked on the
group of Americans as a possi
ble ticket to freedom, he said.
America's image
"It makes me sad to think
that America's image is often
better than deserved," he said.
Boyar also said he and his
friend found several com
munities in Central Asia, East
Iran, and Afghanistan that had

never heard of the United
States.
Krone and Boyar plan to al
ternate in ten-day cycles bet
ween riding and visiting sites
such as Cuzco, the old Inca
capitol. They will carry sleep
ing gear, and buy meals along
the way. Judging by the 300

Sophomore Mark Boyar is preparing for a 7000-mile bike trip from
Minnesota to Peru. Senior Pam Krone wiII also be making the journey,
expected to take six months.
Cycling through the
deepest, darkest wilds of
White Plaza where savage
beasts and people are likely to
pop out from behind kiosks is
an experience we all go
through here.
Now two students, appetites
obviously whetted by such en
counters, have decided to take
the whole experience further
— to South America, to be
exact.
Starting next month, Mark
Boyar and Pam Krone will bike
from the headwaters of the
Mississippi River in Minnesota
to the headwaters of the Ama
zon River at Lake Titicaca, bet
ween Bolivia and Peru. Boyar is
a sophomore majoring in in
ternational relations, and
Krone is a graduating senior
majoring in chemical engineer
ing. They estimate they will
cover approximately 7000 miles
in six months, returning by
spring quarter, or next year at
the latest.
Their journey will begin with
a rendezvous with two of
Boyar's friends in Minnesota.
From there they will pedal
south to New Orleans, fly to
Jamaica, and bike across the is
land to a boat that will take
them to Colombia.
Greater challenge
Once in South America, the
terrain and weather conditions
will provide a bit more of a
challenge. Boyar said his group
will hit Peru during its rainy
season, as well as approxi
mately 1500 miles of desert —
some of which hasn't received
rain in 15 years — in full sum
mer and 100 degree heat
After covering Colombia,
the group will begin the slow
ascent up and over the 17,000-
foot summit of the Andes,

which overlooks South Ameri
ca's largest lake, Lake Titicaca.
Boyar estimates he and his
friends will spend two-thirds of
their trip in the Andes, which
stretch the length of the conti
nent. This will make the ad
justment to the thin air at the
top relatively painless. After
this, they plan to coast dow
nhill and into Bolivia, where
they will catch a flight for the
United States.
For Boyar, who cycled a
round the world (15,000 miles)
after graduating from high
school, this trip will be the
equivalent of a jaunt to the

corner drugstore. When asked
if he was training, Boyar re
plied, "Oh, I run three or four
times a week, but really it's the
ride from Minnesota to New
Orleans that'll get us into
shape."
Biggest worries
Boyar's biggest worries are
traffic and dysentary. Although
there isn't much traffic along
his route, except in the
capitals, Boyar discovered on
his world tour that road rules
and cyclers' rights are almost
universally disregarded. Of all
the drivers he's encountered,
Boyar found Indian truckdriv

ers to be the most reckless.
"They're worse than Italians
— I think they drive with their
eyes closed. They'll pass com
ing right at you, or change a tire
in the middle of the road and
expect you to go around. If it
hadn't been for my quick reac
tions, I'd have been killed
hundreds of times," Boyar
said.
As for dysentary, it is more of
a discomfort and embarrass
ment than a danger; according
to Boyar, the only major medi
cal mishap suffered by his
group was a hernia, which re
portedly sprung loose in
Algeria.
Boyar is equally uncon
cerned about political upheav
als. He has cycled through the
Golan Heights, India during
Ghandi's "emergency," Af
ghanistan just after a coup
d'etat, and Thailand after the
student rebellion.
Boyar found that the United
States' image was generally
good where he cycled. Many
people, especially students in
the more repressed countries
such as Iran, looked on the
group of Americans as a possi
ble ticket to freedom, he said.
America's image
"It makes me sad to think
that America's image is often
better than deserved," he said.
Boyar also said he and his
friend found several com
munities in Central Asia, East
Iran, and Afghanistan that had

never heard of the United
States.
Krone and Boyar plan to al
ternate in ten-day cycles bet
ween riding and visiting sites
such as Cuzco, the old Inca
capitol. They will carry sleep
ing gear, and buy meals along
the way. Judging by the 300
correspondents Boyar gained
on his last trip, hospitality
won't be a problem.
However, "when you're a
tourist in the city, they want
your money, and you're not as
much a person as something to
make money off of," Boyar
said.
Although barbecued
beefhearts generally taste a lit
tle strange to Westernized pa
lates, with a few minor excep
tions, food problems were few
and far between on the world
tour.
Exceptions
One exception, however,
was in Tunisia. "There was one
time I wanted a ham and
cheese sandwich and some
Frosted Flakes in Tunisia,"
Boyar said. "For three days
that's all my friend and I talked
about. When we finally took a
boat to Italy, the first thing we
did was sit down on the dock
and gorge out on ham and
cheese and Frosted Flakes. We
got ourselves sick."
Boyar admits that cycling all
day for several months can be
come boring. "After three
months on the road, nothing

comes into your head —
you've done all the fantasizing
you can," he said.
"You'll be biking along for
an hour or so, and all of a sud
den you'll snap out of it and say
'Hey, what have I been think
ing about?' Nothing. I guess it's
sort of equivalent to medita
tion — or like driving a car for a
whole day," Boyar said.
At various times Boyar has
resorted to memorizing
poetry, playing the harmonica,
and even reading (by attaching
a book to the handlebars), to
entertain himself. He also did
isometric exercises for awhile,
he said, because despite the
biking, his "upper body had
become a marshmallow."
Risk involved
Certainly one of the larger
risks involved in taking off with
a small group of friends for
several months of intense
companionship is that you may
not return friends. For in
stance, a total of nine students
left on Boyar's world tour, but
only four completed the jour
ney, and one had a nervous
breakdown after five months.
To avoid a repetition of this,
Boyar, Krone, and their friends
will alternate leadership re
sponsibilities and will distance
themselves as they bike. Get
ting lost won't be a problem,
Boyar said, because there are
so few roads in South America.
"If you're going south in
Ecuador, well, you're on the
road that goes south in
Ecuador, and it's pretty hard to
get off."
Unlike his last tour, for
which he studied Arabic for
two years, Boyar anticipates
few language difficulties. Ex

cept for a few villages that still
speak in Indian dialects, the
majority of South Americans
speak Spanish, with a heavy
sprinkling of English.
Foreigners' English
Boyar and his comrades
learned not to depend on
foreign-spoken English, how
ever, after an incident in
Algeria in which they were un
able to understand a word of
the local English teacher's En
glish.
Although they claim that
theirs will be the first journey
along the route they've cho
sen, Krone and Boyar are not
interested in setting any re
cords. When asked if he didn't
secretly yearn after an entry in
the Guinness Book of World
Records, Boyar replied that had
that been the case, they
wouldn't have made it.
"We met a guy on his way
from Chicago to Los Angeles
on a unicycle," he said. "He'd
be the type to make it. We
aren't crazy enough."
Then what is it that impels
Mark Boyar and Pam Krone to
sweat and toil for six months to
reach a destination that could
be reached by airplane in one
day? It's not just the physical
challenge, they maintain. Nor
is it merely the scenery, the
cocoa leaves or Boyar's major.
It's a lot of things, Boyar said,
but most of all it's the people.
"I'm happiest when I'm se
eing the real world," Boyar
said. "You don't get any feeling
for the country when you go by
car or bus. Seventy-five per
cent of the people live in the
country. That's the real
people; that's the real coun
try."
