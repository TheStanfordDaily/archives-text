# Chicano youths benefit from outreach program
## 
### Cindy Santana 
It's always great fun to spend the day at the
beach, to go to parties and to celebrate holidays
with terrific dinners, but it's even more fun
when you're doing it with 45 kids who can really
benefit from a group activity.
Getting people of the Chicano community to
gether is one of the major goals of the Barrio
Systems Project, one of the many MEChA-based
programs organized on campus.
"We try to provide some important services
that these people otherwise wouldn't receive,"
said Xavier Becerra, a sophomore from Sac
ramento, one of the four program coordinators
of the Barrios Systems Project.
The project reaches youngsters, teen-agers
and adults in the East Palo Alto community. Each
coordinator organizes activities for his respec
tive group. Becerra is coordinator of the chil
dren's group.
Every Saturday about 20 Stanford students act
as tutors to pre-schoolers and youngsters 6 to 13
years old, helping with reading, math, and En
glish skills. Becerra and others drive to East Palo
Alto, pick up the kids, and hold about a four
hour learning session at Ravenswood Recrea
tional Center in East Palo Alto.
One-to-one
"We try to keep the program on a one-to-one
basis, and find out what each child needs help
in," said Becerra. "They may bring their
homework with them and we'll try to help solve
any problems."
"It's such a great feeling to know you've
taught these kids something. One girl I worked
with was having problems reducing fractions,
and after our session she could solve her
homework problems, lust helping with little
things that can make a difference for them is
very rewarding," said Becerra.
The project extends to other needs of the
community as well. The Barrio Systems Project
has an annual Thanksgiving food drive and a
Cinco de Mayo celebration. This year the pro
ject sponsored a Christmas gift drive and also
had a Halloween celebration for the children.
The Cinco de Mayo celebration was the high
light of the year, according to Becerra. Barrios
Systems Project coordinated the activities for
the community and had speakers, Ballet
Folklorico, food, and games for the celebration.
Working in conjunction with Barrios Systems
Project is the Project Motivation Program.
"Our goal is to encourage high school

Chicano students to apply to colleges and uni
versities in California. With our tours,
question-and-answer sessions, and Chicanos of
the Stanford staff as speakers, we try to show
role models and let the students know that the
opportunities are available to them," said pro
ject director Elmer Aragon, a sophomore from
New Mexico.
This year Aragon had the program working on
much larger scale than its previous two years of
existence. High schools from the Bay Area and
Los Angeles were acquainted with the Stanford
campus by attending scheduled tours during
February and April. Stanford students led tou.s
of the engineering building, computer termi
nals, the medical center, and communications
buildings.
"The community was very receptive towards
our project," said Aragon.
Another section of Project Motivation works
with students at Sequoia High School in Red
wood City. Each counselor concentrates on a
target group of about 20 students.
"Many times I find that the parents of these
kids really don't value their child's education
because they don't understand the grading sys
tem or the letters sent home. The child feels
'Well, my parents don't care, why should I?' As a
Chicano student myself, I can relate better to
their situation and give them a realistic view of
what they have to do," said Evelia Rodriguez,
one of three counselors who work with Latino
students at the school.
Initiating program
Setting up the program at Sequoia took about
two months. The counselors had to introduce
themselves to the teachers and let students
know why they were there.
"There was a tremendous amount of resis
tance," said Adrian Ortega, a freshman from Los
Angeles. "The school, teachers, and students
were very conservative, and there were some
misunderstandings."
Ortega has arranged various activities at
Sequoia, bringing such as Ballet Eolklorico, and
the Chicano poets to the Sequioa campus.
Five years ago a group of Chicano students
here held a voter registration drive in East Palo
Alto area. The students saw a need for more
communication and assistance. The outreach
programs were organized to meet these needs.
All of the programs have been created, acti
vated, and coordinated by Stanford Chicano
students.

basis, and find out what each child needs help
in," said Becerra. "They may bring their
homework with them and we'll try to help solve
any problems."
"It's such a great feeling to know you've
taught these kids something. One girl I worked
with was having problems reducing fractions,
and after our session she could solve her
homework problems, lust helping with little
things that can make a difference for them is
very rewarding," said Becerra.
The project extends to other needs of the
community as well. The Barrio Systems Project
has an annual Thanksgiving food drive and a
Cinco de Mayo celebration. This year the pro
ject sponsored a Christmas gift drive and also
had a Halloween celebration for the children.
The Cinco de Mayo celebration was the high
light of the year, according to Becerra. Barrios
Systems Project coordinated the activities for
the community and had speakers, Ballet
Folklorico, food, and games for the celebration.
Working in conjunction with Barrios Systems
Project is the Project Motivation Program.
"Our goal is to encourage high school

Chicano students to apply to colleges and uni
versities in California. With our tours,
question-and-answer sessions, and Chicanos of
the Stanford staff as speakers, we try to show
role models and let the students know that the
opportunities are available to them," said pro
ject director Elmer Aragon, a sophomore from
New Mexico.
This year Aragon had the program working on
much larger scale than its previous two years of
existence. High schools from the Bay Area and
Los Angeles were acquainted with the Stanford
campus by attending scheduled tours during
February and April. Stanford students led tou.s
of the engineering building, computer termi
nals, the medical center, and communications
buildings.
"The community was very receptive towards
our project," said Aragon.
Another section of Project Motivation works
with students at Sequoia High School in Red
wood City. Each counselor concentrates on a
target group of about 20 students.
"Many times I find that the parents of these
kids really don't value their child's education
because they don't understand the grading sys
tem or the letters sent home. The child feels
'Well, my parents don't care, why should I?' As a
Chicano student myself, I can relate better to
their situation and give them a realistic view of
what they have to do," said Evelia Rodriguez,
one of three counselors who work with Latino
students at the school.
Initiating program
Setting up the program at Sequoia took about
two months. The counselors had to introduce
themselves to the teachers and let students
know why they were there.
"There was a tremendous amount of resis
tance," said Adrian Ortega, a freshman from Los
Angeles. "The school, teachers, and students
were very conservative, and there were some
misunderstandings."
Ortega has arranged various activities at
Sequoia, bringing such as Ballet Eolklorico, and
the Chicano poets to the Sequioa campus.
Five years ago a group of Chicano students
here held a voter registration drive in East Palo
Alto area. The students saw a need for more
communication and assistance. The outreach
programs were organized to meet these needs.
All of the programs have been created, acti
vated, and coordinated by Stanford Chicano
students.
It's always great fun to spend the day at the
beach, to go to parties and to celebrate holidays
with terrific dinners, but it's even more fun
when you're doing it with 45 kids who can really
benefit from a group activity.
Getting people of the Chicano community to
gether is one of the major goals of the Barrio
Systems Project, one of the many MEChA-based
programs organized on campus.
"We try to provide some important services
that these people otherwise wouldn't receive,"
said Xavier Becerra, a sophomore from Sac
ramento, one of the four program coordinators
of the Barrios Systems Project.
The project reaches youngsters, teen-agers
and adults in the East Palo Alto community. Each
coordinator organizes activities for his respec
tive group. Becerra is coordinator of the chil
dren's group.
Every Saturday about 20 Stanford students act
as tutors to pre-schoolers and youngsters 6 to 13
years old, helping with reading, math, and En
glish skills. Becerra and others drive to East Palo
Alto, pick up the kids, and hold about a four
hour learning session at Ravenswood Recrea
tional Center in East Palo Alto.
One-to-one
"We try to keep the program on a one-to-one
basis, and find out what each child needs help
in," said Becerra. "They may bring their
homework with them and we'll try to help solve
