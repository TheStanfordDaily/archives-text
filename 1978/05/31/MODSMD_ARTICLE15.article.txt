# Court to rule on alimony
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court said yesterday it
will decide whether laws pro
viding alimony payments only
for divorced women discrimi
nate against divorced men.
The justices also ruled that
lawyers generally may not
drum up business by person
ally contacting potential clients
but that lawyers for non-profit
groups may do so when seek
ing "litigation as a vehicle for
effective political expression."
In the alimony case, the
court will study the validity of
an Alabama law making only
women potential recipients of
alimony.
William Orr, a San Francisco
business executive charged
with being behind in alimony
payments to his ex-wife, an
Alabama resident, charges that
the law fosters sex discrimina
tion.
It violates the Constitution
because it denies him and all
other divorced men equal pro
tection under the law, attor
neys for Orr said.
Eleven other states have laws
providing alimony only for
women, and those laws hang in
the balance of the high court's

eventual decision.
The states are Arkansas,
Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana;
Mississippi, Nevada, New
York, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee and Wyom
ing.
In a pair of decisions, the jus
tices drew a distinction bet
ween lawyers who solicit
clients "for pecuniary gain"
and those who volunteer free
legal help to further the goals
of an association such as the
American Civil Liberties Un
ion.
The court unanimously re
fused to back down from tradi
tional bans on so-called "am
bulance chasing" by lawyers as
it upheld the disbarment of
Cleveland attorney Albert
Ohralik.
Noting the "detrimental as
pects of face-to-face selling,"
justice Lewis Powell Jr. said for
the court that "the potential for
overreaching is significantly
greater when a lawyer, a pro
fessional trained in the art of
persuasion, personally solicits
an unsophisticated, injured or
distressed lay person."
Ohralik, who was disbarred
after asking two young women

seriously hurt in a car accident
for permission to file a lawsuit
for them, had charged that
Ohio's ban on such solicitation
infringed on his free-speech
rights.
Powell also wrote the court's
opinion that provided the
ACLU and other civil rights
groups with a significant vic
tory.
In it, the court ruled that
South Carolina was wrong to
apply its disciplinary rules to
Fdna Smith Primus.
Primus, on behalf of the
ACLU, informed a group of
welfare mothers that they
could sue their doctors for per
forming involuntary steriliza
tions. Primus offered free
ACLU legal services to one of
the women.
Her action, said Powell,
"comes within the generous
zone of First Amendment pro
tection reserved for associa
tional freedoms. The ACLU
engages in litigation as a vehi
cle for effective political ex
pression and association, as
well as a means of com
municating useful information
to the public."
