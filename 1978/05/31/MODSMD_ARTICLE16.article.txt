## classical music/richard meyer E. Jerome Malry: a good chance 
### 
San Francisco has been the
setting for several astonishing
musical events in the last
month. First, the rediscovery
of a great piano virtuoso who
vanished some 40 years ago liv
ing in a transient's hotel in the
tenderloin. Second, the
emergence of a young,
hitherto unknown black con
cert pianist who made his first
major public appearance be
fore a capacity audience in the
Opera House last Thursday.
E.Jerome Malry turned many
heads in the musical profes
sion some weeks ago when he
announced in a fashion re
miniscent of Muhammed Ali "I
will win the Tchaikovsky Com
petition." Born 28 years ago
the son of a Los Angeles
plumber, Malry made his
debut with a local community
orchestra at age 15. He went to
college at USC where he ma
jored in music. During these
years he performed at colleges
and universities throughout
the West. He received his Mas
ters at San Francisco State Uni
versity. Despite his impressive
credentials, he has never
played before a large audi
ence. Nevertheless, he qual
ified for the prestigious
Tchaikovsky Competition to be
held in Moscow next month.
The purpose of his San Fran
cisco appearance was to gain
this experience for the compet
ition next month.
Tchaikovsky
The event drew a large
crowd, many of whom came
because of the uniqueness of
the event. The program con
sisted most notably of works by
Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Bach
and Liszt for solo piano. The
finale was the Tchaikovsky
Piano Concerto No. 1 accom
panied by the Lowell High
School Symphony Orchestra.
As the house lights dimmed
the audience grew quiet. A
young bearded black man with
the stature of a basketball
player strode confidently up to
the piano, right arm raised
above head in greeting amid
the cheers of the audience
From the moment he stopped
onstage it was clear there was
something different about this
man. Call it what you like, but
he had a remarkable affinity for
developing a rapport with his
listeners. The candidness and
spontaneity of his expressions,
gestures and poise set him
apart from other pianists for
even the greatest of whom

these have sometimes become
premeditated and mechanical.
Lowell High School
As he began to play, he
sought not to impress his audi
ence with technical ac
complishments but rather to
draw them into a world of
melody, colorand new musical
ideas. At the end of each piece,
Malry wiped his hands and
examined the audience with
intense, questioning eyes as
they lauded him. Despite his
age, he is more the mature re
flective artist than the string
breaking young firebrand.
For the Tchaikovsky con
certo, Malry was accompanied
.by the Lowell High School
Symphony, under the direc
tion of John Pereira. Being on
the front row, keyboard side, I
was smack in front of the violin
section. "Oh cruel and un
usual punishment" I thought,
but was pleasantly surprised by
the quality of the orchestra
especially the woodwinds.
From my seat I unfortunately
did not get the full impact of
the piano. Although a few
notes were missed, Malry pul
led the thing off powerfully
and with a touch of class. This
drew a thunderous ovation
from the appreciative audi
ence, everyone was standing.
It was clear they wouldn't let
him go without an encore.
Malry shrugged, stroked his
chin and then announced,
"OK, I'll play 'The Seasons' by
Tchaikovsky 'cause it's my
favorite."
"E."
After the concert I rushed
down to the dressing room to
find out what the "E." stood
for. A large crowd was
gathered there. Malry however
was not giving autographs, he
w;r asking tor them from the
people who attended his con
cert.
Could E. Jerome Malry win
the Tchaikovsky competition?
The technique certainly is
there, but at the level of the
competition, technical mastery
of th? keyboard is assumed.
The artist's confidence, audi
ence rapport and interpreta
tive originality will no doubt be
crucial elements. In light of
this, Malry will definitely have a
good chance. Should he win,
he would only be the second
American to receive this honor
(Van Cliburn was the first). At
the very least, this year's com
petition should prove to be an
interesting one. Best of luck,
Jerry!

hitherto unknown black con
cert pianist who made his first
major public appearance be
fore a capacity audience in the
Opera House last Thursday.
E.Jerome Malry turned many
heads in the musical profes
sion some weeks ago when he
announced in a fashion re
miniscent of Muhammed Ali "I
will win the Tchaikovsky Com
petition." Born 28 years ago
the son of a Los Angeles
plumber, Malry made his
debut with a local community
orchestra at age 15. He went to
college at USC where he ma
jored in music. During these
years he performed at colleges
and universities throughout
the West. He received his Mas
ters at San Francisco State Uni
versity. Despite his impressive
credentials, he has never
played before a large audi
ence. Nevertheless, he qual
ified for the prestigious
Tchaikovsky Competition to be
held in Moscow next month.
The purpose of his San Fran
cisco appearance was to gain
this experience for the compet
ition next month.
Tchaikovsky
The event drew a large
crowd, many of whom came
because of the uniqueness of
the event. The program con
sisted most notably of works by
Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Bach
and Liszt for solo piano. The
finale was the Tchaikovsky
Piano Concerto No. 1 accom
panied by the Lowell High
School Symphony Orchestra.
As the house lights dimmed
the audience grew quiet. A
young bearded black man with
the stature of a basketball
player strode confidently up to
the piano, right arm raised
above head in greeting amid
the cheers of the audience
From the moment he stopped
onstage it was clear there was
something different about this
man. Call it what you like, but
he had a remarkable affinity for
developing a rapport with his
listeners. The candidness and
spontaneity of his expressions,
gestures and poise set him
apart from other pianists for
even the greatest of whom

these have sometimes become
premeditated and mechanical.
Lowell High School
As he began to play, he
sought not to impress his audi
ence with technical ac
complishments but rather to
draw them into a world of
melody, colorand new musical
ideas. At the end of each piece,
Malry wiped his hands and
examined the audience with
intense, questioning eyes as
they lauded him. Despite his
age, he is more the mature re
flective artist than the string
breaking young firebrand.
For the Tchaikovsky con
certo, Malry was accompanied
.by the Lowell High School
Symphony, under the direc
tion of John Pereira. Being on
the front row, keyboard side, I
was smack in front of the violin
section. "Oh cruel and un
usual punishment" I thought,
but was pleasantly surprised by
the quality of the orchestra
especially the woodwinds.
From my seat I unfortunately
did not get the full impact of
the piano. Although a few
notes were missed, Malry pul
led the thing off powerfully
and with a touch of class. This
drew a thunderous ovation
from the appreciative audi
ence, everyone was standing.
It was clear they wouldn't let
him go without an encore.
Malry shrugged, stroked his
chin and then announced,
"OK, I'll play 'The Seasons' by
Tchaikovsky 'cause it's my
favorite."
"E."
After the concert I rushed
down to the dressing room to
find out what the "E." stood
for. A large crowd was
gathered there. Malry however
was not giving autographs, he
w;r asking tor them from the
people who attended his con
cert.
Could E. Jerome Malry win
the Tchaikovsky competition?
The technique certainly is
there, but at the level of the
competition, technical mastery
of th? keyboard is assumed.
The artist's confidence, audi
ence rapport and interpreta
tive originality will no doubt be
crucial elements. In light of
this, Malry will definitely have a
good chance. Should he win,
he would only be the second
American to receive this honor
(Van Cliburn was the first). At
the very least, this year's com
petition should prove to be an
interesting one. Best of luck,
Jerry!
San Francisco has been the
setting for several astonishing
musical events in the last
month. First, the rediscovery
of a great piano virtuoso who
vanished some 40 years ago liv
ing in a transient's hotel in the
tenderloin. Second, the
emergence of a young,
hitherto unknown black con
cert pianist who made his first
major public appearance be
fore a capacity audience in the
Opera House last Thursday.
