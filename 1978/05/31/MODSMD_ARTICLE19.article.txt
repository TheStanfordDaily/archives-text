## Stanley Clark: disappointing 
### 
Stanley Clarke plays excep
tional electric and acoustic
bass. His technique is flawless
and his wealth of musical ideas
seem unlimited. Nevertheless,
his performance last Friday
night at the Berkeley Commun
ity Theater with the "School
Days" band disappointed me,
even though it pleased the rest
of the audience and had all of
us dancing in front of our seats.

The problem is that Stanley's
choice of musical contexts in
which to express himself does
not necessarily allow his full ta
lent to emerge. Fusion, at least
as he plays it, is for him a limit
ing form: a repeated progres
sion of rock chords with jazz
phrasing, on top of which the
soloist improvises.
As composer and leader of
the rhythm section of "School

Days," Stanley certainly drove
the music at an impressive rate.
His theme composition
"School Days," for example,
moved along forcefully and
with dramatic changes. How
ever, when he jumped in front
of the band to solo, his riffs
were charged only with power
and unbelievable speed, not
with the tasteful finesse I
hoped they would have had.

His runs over the fretboard of
his electric bass were impres
sive and exciting, but they
lacked the thoughtful expres
sion that always inspires his
acoustic playing. The incessant
repetition of the simple theme
also became dull.
Thus, the highlight of the
evening occurred when Stan
ley brought out his upright
bass. He played two pieces on
it, a solo improvisation based
on one of the Spanish themes
he has been developing for
several years, and Charlie
Parkpr's upbeat "Confirma
tion" with fine trumpeter Al
Harrison. On both his playing
was sensitive and directed to
ward displaying the full range
of intonations of which the
acoustic bass is capable.
In contrast, Stanley's stan
dards "Quiet Afternoon,"
"Lopsy Lu" and "Hot Fun"
were no more than entertain
ing. Except for Ray Gomez'
guitar work, the horn and
piano solos were insipid, and
Stanley never brought his
compositions past the limits of
the underlying progressions.
Only the frantic pace of the
rhythm and Stanley's often

vague but always spirited bass
digressions kept the audience
excited.
To his credit
To his credit, Stanley did as
semble a lively, well-rehearsed
band for this concert. Darrel
Brown drummed smoothly and
enthusiastically, and Gomez
picked intelligently in the Jeff
Beck manner of space/funk.
The horn section was tight and
well integrated into each
number. Even Mike Carsin, on
synthesizer and keyboards, an
inveterate boogie-woogie rol
ler, contributed well to the fu
sion.
Perhaps it is wrong for me to
criticize such an artist as Stan
ley Clarke, whose perfor
mance in concert is always
energizing. It is wrong, how
ever, forStanleyto think fusion
and funk are the best forms for
the expression of his talent. If
his ideas are more interesting
and more enlightening, as they
are, on acoustic bass, then
perhaps he should devote
more time to this instrument
until he has defined the full
ness of his musical mind. Only
in such a way will we be able to
appreciate all he has to play.
