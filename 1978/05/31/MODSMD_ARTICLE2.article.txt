# Trustees recognize role of student views

"Students often claim they're not
heard, but that's not the case It's just
that the trustees may not agree with
them," said Board of Trustees
member Richard Guggenhime.
"The trustees don't have their ears
shut," agreed trustee William Ayer.
According to Ayer, student opin
ion is taken into account, "but I'm
much more powerfully influenced by
whatever information I can get that is
factual and not emotional."
"I particularly admire the opinions
of students who have made a con
certed effort to survey a broad range
of other students and who have as
similated that information into a
meaningful position on an issue,"
said trustee Stender Sweeney.
Protests ineffective
Although several of the trustees
said they value student opinion "a
great deal," they added they did not
feel that student protests were an ef
fective means of communicating
with the trustees.
Ayer said he thinks the student
protest over South African invest
ments is "sincere," but added "they
have looked at one side with a lot
more thoroughness than they have at
other sides."
Guggenhime said the sit-ins and
protests can be "self-defeating," but
"there's no question that the
squeaky wheel gets the grease."
President Richard Lyman said that
in some cases the student protests
are "counterproductive," but ad
ded, "if students don't attempt to be
somewhat dramatic, they're less
likely to keep an issue on the
agenda."
Power not in trustees
"I don't think that the Board of
Trustees is where the power is," said
trustee Armin Rosencranz.
"Probably the way to have the
most impact is to try to influence the
decision-making structure by par
ticipating in University committees.
You can do that by holding meetings,
educating, producing pamphlets,
writing letters to the Daily and trying
to get your own people on those
bodies through the normal selection
process," Rosencranz continued.
"One allegation is that trustees
aren't informed. It just isn't true,"
commented Ayer.
All are informed
All of the trustees receive the Stan
ford Daily, most University publica
tions, a monthly agenda and material
relevant to the issues to be discus
sed.
Several of the trustees said they
devote close to one working day per
week to trustee affairs. The trustees
serve without being paid. Although

they may ask to be reimbursed for
their traveling expenses to attend
meetings, most never do, said Ly
man.
Nature changed
According to Guggenhime, who
has been a trustee for 20 years, the
nature of the board has ( hanged sig
nificantly since he became a
member.
The most significant change was
the addition of alumni trustees to the
board. In 1954, the number of trus
tees was increased from 15 to 23, of
which three were to be selected by
the Alumni Association.
In 1970, the board was further in
creased to have between 25 and 35
trustees, and the alumni trustees
were elected by the alumni trustees
rather than appointed.
At this same time, the President of
the University was named an ex
officio member of the board, trus
tees were limited to two terms on the
board, and a mandatory retirement
age of 70 was set. A conscious effort
was also made to increase the
number of women on the board.
There are now seven women trus
tees.
More heterogeneous
Besides increasing the size of the
board, the alumni trustees also
helped to make the board more
heterogeneous, said Guggenhime,
because half of the alumni trustees
must be 35 years old or younger.
The increase in size is good, said
Lyman, in order to have "more diver
sity of viewpoint and expression,"
but the larger size also "constrains
debate and discussion."
Committee selects alumni
The alumni trustee candidates are
selected by an independent commit
tee which chooses eight candidates
to run for the four positions. Addi
tional candidates may petition to be
placed on the ballot. Stone said this
is the first year that no candidates
have petitioned to run.
Four alumni trustees are elected
every two years and serve four year
terms. Eight alumni trustees are on
the board at all times.
Voting declines
According to Alumni Association
Director Bill Stone, the voter partici
pation in these elections has de
clined steadily from 28 per cent in
1970 to only 17 per cent in 1976.
Stone said the figure for this year's
election is approximately 15 percent,
although final statistics have not
been determined.
He added he has been "disap
pointed" in the low turnout, al
though "other schools with the same
kind of election process have seen
similar declines."
