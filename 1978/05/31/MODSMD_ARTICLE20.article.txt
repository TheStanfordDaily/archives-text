## I hate the Chaparral 
### 
You should know that I hate
them, because we share the
same building, and they write
about my sister in the bat
hroom. My sister died of
leukemia five years ago, and
they seem to think it's funny,
so they're always making
corpse jokes on the door to the
second stall. "Hey, Nielsen,"
they say, "did you know your
sister was dead?" Or "For a
good time, cal! Nielsen's sister
at the morgue. We did." They
make me sick, is what they do
and then they ask me to review
their latest issue.
Stupid
Well, OK, then. I'll review it.
I'll review it, and I'll get even
with all you little weasels, and
then I'll move to a different
stall where you can't find me.
Everybody knows the Chapar
ral isn't funny anyway, so this'll
be my big chance to kick a
cripple and love it.
Here we go. I'm looking at
the cover now, and I'm not
laughing. I'm thinking "what a
stupid cover, I hope it doesn't
sell, I wish my sister could see
this." Take that, you turkeys.
Your cover isn't funny.
Boring
Now I'm turning the pages,
and I'm still not laughing. We
got your basic fifth-rate Na

tional Lampoon letters-to
the-editor rip-off, and we got
your basic cowshit from "ASSU
Senator X," and we got your
basic three-page plug for that
idiot 'John Vomit' punk-rock
group. I loathe 'John Vomit
and the Leather Scabs,' and so
does everybody else with a
brain that isn't pink and
smooth like theirs are, and I
hope they all get leukemia so
they'll know what it's like. She
was such a nice girl.
Dc,rnb and stupid
Yeah, and now I'm looking at
the cartoons. The thing is full
of cartoons. We got "Mr. Eg
ghead meets Brainiac" (dumb),
we got "Overman meets the
Mindless Menace" (dumb), we
got "You, starring in 'A Typical
Day,' " (dumb). Also "The
Paths of Honor, Part 3" (bor
ing), and "Dagwoods" (bor
ing), and "Saturday Night Lep
rosy" (dumb and boring). The
last page is full of cheap imita
tions of comics from the
Chron's comic section, and
none of it is funny and you can
all go to hell.
Dumb
So there. The Chappie
sucks. Kirsten Nielsen was a
vibrant pink bundle of sweet
ness, and when she was tragi
cally stricken we swore to up

hold her name. So you can put
away the Valium, Mom â€” I
took care of it.
(Editor's note: The Daily's
stall walls are, in fact, remarka
bly clean. And Kirsten will be
alarmed to hear of her demise.
The Chaparral will be on sale
today in White Plaza. We
thought you ought to know.)
