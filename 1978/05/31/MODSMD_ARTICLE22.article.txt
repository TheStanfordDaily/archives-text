ous."

38,000 and 40,000 troops in various African countries.

said yesterday that within two months "either the peace
process will gain momentum again, or it will prove to be
a failure."

April inflation figures 'disaster'
Washington — The Carter administration yesterday
braced for the latest inflation figures, which one official
predicted would be a disaster.
Barry Bosworth, chairman of the Council on Wage and
Price Stability, has said the April and May Consumer
Price Index figures to be released tomorrow will "prob
ably look pretty bad."
He said they would probably match the 9.3 per cent
annual inflation rate that stirred alarm in the first three
months of the year. The April figures, he said, would be a
"disaster."
Although he agreed the May price report will be bad,
one government economist said hedidn'tthink it would
cause the administration to do anything it isn't already
doing.
He said food prices probably will be up again sharply
in May, but that prices are also rising generally through
out the economy because of rising production costs,
both in labor and raw materials.
Brown won't move before election
Sacramento — Gov. jerry Brown said yesterday he
won't be able to roll back and freeze property tax as
sessments statewide before voters decide the fate of the
Jarvis tax initiative )une 6.
"It's not going to happen before the election and it
would be quite difficult later," Brown told reporters
after meeting with Democratic leaders of the Legislature
for nearly four hours.
The Democratic governor insisted that the plan was
constitutional, but said legislative leaders told him there
wasn't time to consider such a complex proposal.
First word that the freeze would not be enacted

quickly carre earlier in the day from Assembly Speaker
Leo McCarthy (D-San Francisco), one of Brown's closest
allies in the Legislature. McCarthy cited a shortage of
time and also said the freeze would have an "uneven
impact" on taxpayers.
Ex-Nazi stripped of citizenship
Chicago — Federal Judge Julius Hoffman stripped
Frank Walus of his U.S. citizenship yesterday on
grounds that Walus concealed from immigration au
thorities his past as a teenage Gestapo agent who mur
dered Polish Jews during World War 11.
Hoffman ordered Walus to turn over his certificate of
naturalization to Justice Department attorneys by June 9.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service could
then begin deportation proceedings, but David Vander
sall, regional INS director, said no decision had been
made on that.
Hoffman told a packed courtroom that evidence in the
17-day civil trial in U.S. District Court "was consistent,
horrible, and generally unshakeable" that Walus com
mitted wartime atrocities.
U.S.S.R. in on new wheat deal
Washington — Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland
predicted yesterday that the Soviet Union will be among
the signers of a new global wheat agreement now being
negotiated.
The Soviet Union has avoided participation in past
international wheat agreements. Bergland said, how
ever, that the Soviet Union is showing evidence that it
intends to be a part of the new pact when it is ready.
"I believe we are on our way in getting an agreement,
ut !t»r ; r> principle, agreed to informally by all parties by
the first of jcly or thereabouts," Bergland said.
The agreement would provide that participating coun
tries share in world wheat supplies when stockpiles are
aC.ir'e and "accept certain disciplines" for managing
reseives when large surpluses exist, he said.
Prop. 13 may contain loopholes
Los Angeles — Several loopholes make it possible for
legislators to get around the property tax limitations
imposed by Proposition 13, a UCLA law professor who is
opposed to the initiative said yesterday.
Donald Hagman, who teaches classes on state and
local taxation at the UCLA School of Law and who has
written two books and several papers on taxation, said
the California constitution of 1879 afforded one such
alternative to the initiative co-authored by Howard Jarvis
and Paul Gann.
"If the Legislature eliminated the loopholes in the
existing property tax and taxed all property within the
one per cent limit prescribed by Jarvis-Gann, the prop
erty tax would yield some $14 billion, as much as $3
billion more than currently," Hagman said.

Prop. 13 may contain loopholes
Los Angeles — Several loopholes make it possible for
legislators to get around the property tax limitations
imposed by Proposition 13, a UCLA law professor who is
opposed to the initiative said yesterday.
Donald Hagman, who teaches classes on state and
local taxation at the UCLA School of Law and who has
written two books and several papers on taxation, said
the California constitution of 1879 afforded one such
alternative to the initiative co-authored by Howard Jarvis
and Paul Gann.
"If the Legislature eliminated the loopholes in the
existing property tax and taxed all property within the
one per cent limit prescribed by Jarvis-Gann, the prop
erty tax would yield some $14 billion, as much as $3
billion more than currently," Hagman said.

force.

April inflation figures 'disaster'
Washington — The Carter administration yesterday
braced for the latest inflation figures, which one official
predicted would be a disaster.
Barry Bosworth, chairman of the Council on Wage and
Price Stability, has said the April and May Consumer
Price Index figures to be released tomorrow will "prob
ably look pretty bad."
He said they would probably match the 9.3 per cent
annual inflation rate that stirred alarm in the first three
months of the year. The April figures, he said, would be a
"disaster."
Although he agreed the May price report will be bad,
one government economist said hedidn'tthink it would
cause the administration to do anything it isn't already
doing.
He said food prices probably will be up again sharply
in May, but that prices are also rising generally through
out the economy because of rising production costs,
both in labor and raw materials.

allies in the Legislature. McCarthy cited a shortage of
time and also said the freeze would have an "uneven
