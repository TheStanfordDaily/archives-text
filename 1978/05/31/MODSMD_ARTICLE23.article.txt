"I find two sides to the Manzanita
issue: the committed enthusiasts
and the students who try not to come
here," said President Richard Lyman
last night in response to questions
from a crowd of Manzanita residents
on KZSU's Campus Conference.
"The underlying assumption has
been that temporary is temporary.
Things haven't been happening fast
because of financial and other con
straints," he said.
The future of the University's
trailer park was a major concern ex
pressed by the students in Manzanita
lounge. Other topics discussed in
cluded decreased minority applica
tions to graduate schools, the role of
sororities and the rising cost of tui
tion.
Western Culture
Lyman was also questioned on his
opinion of the proposed pilot prog
ram for the Western Culture Re
quirement.
('Yes, I am in favor of the prog
ram," he said. "But it is fraught with
difficulties. For one thing, it's hard to
finance."
Lyman said he felt progress on the
issue hasn't been "unduly speedy,"
and that even the pilot program
won't prove the worth of the re
quirement.
"We ought to see what we've got,"
he said. "Until it's a requirement we
don't know if it will work or not."
Fewer minorities
In response to a question about
the reason for declining minority ap
plications to graduate programs,
Lyman said there is no definite ans
wer, but that it certainly is a "central

issue.
"We can only speculate as to the
reason, because we don't have the
kind of research opportunities to
know for sure," he said.
"Perhaps there are more oppor
tunities for minorities to find a job
once out of college, which is appeal
ing especially if the student has loans
to pay off," he added.
Lyman said he also felt it is impor
tant for the University to look at its
own financial aid situation in solving
this problem.
Role of sororities
One of the students in the audi
ence asked Lyman what he felt the
role of sororities is and will eventu
ally be.
"Most of us were surprised at the
interest when the ban was re
moved," said Lyman. "There is no

question that the ban was unfair and
discriminated against women."
Lyman added that he felt it was
"unlikely" that there would be
houses for the sororities.
"It's been my impression that
women are more interested in a 'so
cial,' not a residential, situation," he
said.
Increased tuition
Another issue brought up at the
interview was the rising cost of Stan
ford's tuition.
"There's a limit to people's toler
ance of the gap between the private
sector and the public sector," said
Lyman.
But he said he is against the Tuition
Tax Credit Bill, because it is "com
pletely untargeted."
Lyman said that the Carter-Pell bill
is a much better alternative.
