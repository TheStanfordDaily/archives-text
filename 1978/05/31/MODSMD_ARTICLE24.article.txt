# Eight arrested at Jazz Festival
## 
### 
The Stanford Jazz Festival held in Frost Amphitheater
Monday and attended by at least 9500 people was mar
red by eight arrests, mostly on misdemeanor charges,
and the theft of over $1000 from a concessionaire.
Nonp of those arrested were Stanford students.
Director of Police Services Marvin Herrington said the
police didn't expect the large crowd but that "at least
that number of problems" could be expected "consider
ing the size of the crowd."
Mark Curtis, director of ASSU Special Events, was
pleased with the turnout and called the festival "ex
tremely successful financially." Curtis noted that the
parking situation around Frost needs improvement as

do some aspects of the amphitheater itself such as the
water fountains and the number of gates.
Curtis also said one reason for the crowded condi
tions was the picnicking which was encouraged in the
festival's promotion.
He added there was more than a one hour break in the
festival because Roy Ayers' group was delayed in getting
its equipment here from the San Jose Airport.
About 13 automobiles were towed from the intersec
tion of Galvez and Campus Drive during the concert.
Sgt. Debbie Marinaro of Police Services said several of
the cars were blocking traffic in the area, which is posted
as a no parking zone.
