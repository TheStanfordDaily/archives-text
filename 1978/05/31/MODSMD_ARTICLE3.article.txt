# ASSU votes to support student funds divestment
## 
### Rob Lempert 
The ASSU Senate, meeting for the
last timfe this school year, passed a
resolution last night designed to
pave the way for divestment of stu
dent funds from the University
merge pool.
The proposal was made because
ASSU funds are presently incorpo
rated in the general University in
vestments, part of which are in com
panies doing business in South Af
rica.
The resolution requires the ASSU
financial manag< i • prepare a report
over the summer ■ . iining possible
investment options 'or the funds if
they are withdrawn from the pool.
In addition to requiring the report
on alternative investments, the re
solution places a non-binding re
ferendum on next fall's ballot, put
ting the divestment question before
the student body.
Senator Doug Bandow said the re
sults of this referendum, along with
the financial manager's report,
wouid put next year's seriate in a re
sponsible position to make the final
divestment vote.
Stockbrokers
In the resolution the ASSU finan
cial manager is allowed to use ASSU
funds to employ stockbrokers who
can help make the report.
Senator Rick Levy co-authored the
resolution with Senator Lynn
Rubinett. Levy said he finds it abhor
rent that student funds are support
ing apartheid.
He added that the cost of hiring a
stockbroker for ASSLJ would be
about $3000 a year, or about 1 Vi per
cent of the ASSU budget. Presently
ASSU receives the services of the
University brokers free, but the so
cial cost of this bargain is supporting
apartheid, Levy said.
Other action
In other action, the senate nar
rowly approved all appointments of
the Nominations Committee (Nom-
Com), including the appointee to the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR), Susan Weinstein.
The divestment resolution passed
by a vote of 7-6, with SOC slate
members casting all the aye votes.
Senators Bandow and George Drys
dale, who voted against the prop
osal, said they did so because they
disagreed with the wording of two of
its passages.
One of the passages reads "the
ASSLJ Senate abhors the overt racism
exhibited by the trustees in their de
cision to support the vicious South
African apartheid government."
The second passage accuses the

trustees of wanting to "pro
letarianize" black South Africans.
Senator Kenneth Nunn defended
this language saying racism is shown
by actions and not by words. He said
the trustees' decision not to divest is
racist.
Senator Bandow said the question
is one of favoring different methods,
and that just because the trustees
don't support divestment doesn't
mean they are racist.
'It's their money'
Senator Tom McCormack said di
vestment is an important step that
the students should decide. "Be
sides," he added, "it's their money."
Senator Peter Joost opposed the
resolution. He said only one-quarter
per cent of merge pool B is student
funds, only a small percentage of the
pool itself is invested in companies

doing business in South Africa, and
that only 1 per cent of these com
panies have holdings in South Africa.
Thus, he said, the resolution puts
thousands of dollars of student
money in jeopardy to pull about $25
out of South Africa.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion calling for NomCom to nomi
nate at least half the members of any
University committee from applic
ants who apply during the spring,
rather than wait to fill vacancies in
the fall.
The present NomCom failed to do
this. Andrew Goldencranz, Council
of Presidents and NomCom
member, said the committee's first
priority was to find the best people. If
qualified people could not be found,
he said, all the spots would not be
filled.

stockbroker for ASSLJ would be
about $3000 a year, or about 1 Vi per
cent of the ASSU budget. Presently
ASSU receives the services of the
University brokers free, but the so
cial cost of this bargain is supporting
apartheid, Levy said.
Other action
In other action, the senate nar
rowly approved all appointments of
the Nominations Committee (Nom-
Com), including the appointee to the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR), Susan Weinstein.
The divestment resolution passed
by a vote of 7-6, with SOC slate
members casting all the aye votes.
Senators Bandow and George Drys
dale, who voted against the prop
osal, said they did so because they
disagreed with the wording of two of
its passages.
One of the passages reads "the
ASSLJ Senate abhors the overt racism
exhibited by the trustees in their de
cision to support the vicious South
African apartheid government."
The second passage accuses the

trustees of wanting to "pro
letarianize" black South Africans.
Senator Kenneth Nunn defended
this language saying racism is shown
by actions and not by words. He said
the trustees' decision not to divest is
racist.
Senator Bandow said the question
is one of favoring different methods,
and that just because the trustees
don't support divestment doesn't
mean they are racist.
'It's their money'
Senator Tom McCormack said di
vestment is an important step that
the students should decide. "Be
sides," he added, "it's their money."
Senator Peter Joost opposed the
resolution. He said only one-quarter
per cent of merge pool B is student
funds, only a small percentage of the
pool itself is invested in companies

doing business in South Africa, and
that only 1 per cent of these com
panies have holdings in South Africa.
Thus, he said, the resolution puts
thousands of dollars of student
money in jeopardy to pull about $25
out of South Africa.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion calling for NomCom to nomi
nate at least half the members of any
University committee from applic
ants who apply during the spring,
rather than wait to fill vacancies in
the fall.
The present NomCom failed to do
this. Andrew Goldencranz, Council
of Presidents and NomCom
member, said the committee's first
priority was to find the best people. If
qualified people could not be found,
he said, all the spots would not be
filled.
