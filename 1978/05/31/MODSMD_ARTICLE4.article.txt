# ERB report urges campaign reform
## 
### 
The Election Review Board (ERB)
has completed its final report on last
fall's ASSU Senate campaign and
election. The report was presented
to the Senate last night.
The 198-page report contained no
major surprises regarding the
board's record of investigation and
adjudication of charges against sev
eral candidates. The ERB also drafted
a 40-page section on possible re
forms for the senate.
Those reforms included a recom
mendation that students rank their
preference of candidates in all ASSU
elections. The ERB said it feels that if
students can rank their choices, elec
tions will be "fairer" and there will be
no need for run-off elections.
After suggesting campaign re
forms and discussing the possibility
of a permanent ERB or an ASSU
"Supreme Court,"the ERB unanim
ously recommended to change the
representation and method of elec
tion to the senate.
The ERB's proposed system would
be through "live petitions," where
any student could be a senator so
long as he had the "active support of
200 constituents." This method
would slightly increase the'number
of senators and would not mandate
that undergraduates and graduates
elect senators only from their own
constituency.
The ERB also corrected a mistake it

made last fall when it transcribed an
offense against five Stanford Or
ganizing Committee-supported
graduate senators with "impeding
the Elections Commission Investiga
tion" when the offense was actually
"failure to cooperate fully and
openly" with the commission.
In other matters, the ERB found
some imperfections with the ac
tivities of Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy, but concluded that,
considering the circumstances with
which Murphy was faced, Murphy's
conduct was commendatory.
The ERB also commended other
ASSU officials, including the Council
of Presidents, for the way in which
"they addressed themselves to this
situation. Lacking any real prece
dent, they confronted an increas
ingly volatile controversy with care
and responsiveness."
A section of the report was de
voted to analysis of the Daily's news
coverage and editorial positions of
the election controversy. Though the
ERB found "overreaction" with some
of the Daily's investigative efforts
and decided that "certainly some
mistakes were made," the board
concluded that "the Daily performed
their main and primary function
magnificently. The editors' position
was consistently (if sometimes ex
cessively) the proper one, in our es
timation."
