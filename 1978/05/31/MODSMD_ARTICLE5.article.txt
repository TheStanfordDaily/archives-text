# Professors' salaries below Harvard, Yale
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Stanford ranks 20th in the nation
behind Harvard, Yale, and other uni
versities in average compensation
paid to full professors, according to
statistics prepared by the
Association of University Professors
(AAUP).
Rockefeller University pays full
professors an average compensation
of $41,400, ranking highest, while
Stanford gives $35,300 to its full pro
fessors, according to 1976-77 data in
the Economic Status of the Profes
sion report. Statistics for 1977-78 will
be released this summer.
Compensation statistics include
salary and countable fringe benefits.
Measuring salaries alone, Stanford
ranks 17th.
Statistics are for all full university
professors, excluding medical
school professors, according to Ray
Bacchetti, vice provost for budget
and planning.
"We're concerned, but not
alarmed by these facts. We can't be
complacent, but we also can't say
that salary is the be-all and end-all in
attracting faculty. That just isn't the
case," Bacchetti said.
Ranks fifth
Stanford ranks fifth among the 10
private institutions against which it
compares itself in academic excel
lence, quality of faculty and quality of
the student body, according to Bac
chetti.
Columbia, Harvard, Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology
ahd Vale pay full professors more
than does Stanford, while California
Institute of Technology, University
of Chicago, Cornell, Princeton and
University of Southern California pay
less.
Of the 10 schools, Harvard gives
the highest compensation, with
$38,500 going to its full professors.
'Same ballpark'
"What's important is that even
where we're behind other academi
cally strong universities, we're still in
the same ballpark. As soon as you're

in the same relative area, you're talk
ing more than just salaries. The type
of colleagues an individual will have,
the type of libraries he'll be working
with and many other factors are im
portant to professors in any institu
tion," Bacchetti said.
Another concern for incoming fa
culty is whether they want to work at
a small liberal arts college or at a
major research institution, such as
Stanford, Bacchetti added. Prospec
tive faculty are also concerned with
the university's reputation, the qual
ity of the students, and the availabil
ity of research equipment.
In both the associate professorand
assistant professor categories, Stan
ford rates number one in compensa
tion. Associate professors here re
ceive an average of $24,600 while as
sistant professors obtain $19,800 an
nually.
Several factors are taken into ac
count to determine the salary of an

incoming faculty member, according
to Bacchetti.
Dean decides
The dean of the school and chair
man of the department look at the
professor's general level in his field
and compare him to his peers. The
dean then decides the professor's
salary, after receiving the chairman's
recommendation.
"He'll be paid differently if he's
never taught before than if he's been
an assistant professor someplace
else before coming to Stanford,"
Bacchetti said.
Within each professorial level,
such as assistant or associate, there
are several levels of pay that a profes
sor can accrue or work towards, Bac
chetti said.
Promotions here are made in
terms of rank. Faculty salaries are
"established in the marketplace,"
according to Bacchetti.
"Some universities such as the

University of Alaska may pay higher
salaries but that's because they have
trouble attracting faculty to start with
due to location. They may also have
to pav higher salaries to compensate
for a higher standard of living," he
said.
As in the other nine schools to
which Stanford compares itself,
female professors here earn less than
men, according to the AAUP data.
Female full professors, earn $4000
less than men in the same position,
while in the assistant professor
category, there is a $600 average an
nual difference.
"There are a number of reasons for
this, mostly historical. Standing in
profession and age distribution are
important considerations which
have made women's salaries lower in
some cases," Bacchetti said.
The University will not release any
individual's salary level without his
or her permission, Bacchetti said.
