# Homophobic people's rights violated
##

The recent string of repeals of
homosexual rights ordinances, and
the announcement that Senator
Briggs has probably gathered
enough signatures to put his mea
sure to bar the employment of
"open and blatant" homosexuals as
teachers on the ballot, has placed
gay rights activists increasingly on
the defensive.
What has been lost in the hue and
cry of battle is that there are two
major, and separate, issues: affirma
tive discrimination by the state
against homosexuals, and affirmative
discrimination by private individuals
against homosexuals.
The first sort of discrimination —
by the state — is the most obnoxious.
California had criminal sanctions
against homosexual behavior bet
ween consenting adults up until
1975. This sort of state intervention
has rightfully come under heavy at
tack in most states.
Such legislation is wrong because
it involves the state in an area where
it has no business — private, victim
less, moral behavior. The state has
no right to violate anyone's privacy to
enforce someone else's moral stan
dards unless there are involuntary
victims.
A rapist should be prevented from

raping, and a thief from stealing, but
private, consensual homosexual be
havior, even if it is considered to be
"wrong," should not be interfered
with.
The mind set of some of the prop
onents of such legislation can be
frightening. Anita Bryant, in her re
cent Playboy interview, argued that
homosexuals should get 20-year
prison terms. Never mind the fact
that homosexuality is rampant in
prisons. Never mind the precedent
set if heterosexuals some day be
come a minority. Never mind the in
equity of such a sentence compared
to that received by a victim-full crim
inal, such as a murderer, rapist,
mugger or thief.
Briggs initiative vindictive
The Briggs initiative is of a similar
vein. It is vindictive and offensive —
the product of an over-employed
opportunist seeking the governor
ship of California. It sanctions affir
mative discrimination by the state
against homosexuals who do not
hide their homosexuality, or who, in
Briggs' words, are "open and blat
ant."
Such a measure is unfair and un
necessary. The idea of role-modeling
converting children to homosexual
ity seems doubtful at best; there is

simply no persuasive evidence to
support it. And by making open
homosexuality per se the basis for
dismissal, the measure ignores the
potential lack of any effect on the
children, and any record of compe
tence, compassion, effectiveness,
etc., on the part of that particular
teacher.
Furthermore, it gets the state in
volved in affirmative discrimination
against a class of people fortheir per
sonal decisions. Allowing the state to
discriminate on the grounds of per
sonal matters, such as sexual orienta
tion (or politics, lifestyle, etc.) —
without regard to qualifications — is
an unfair and dangerous game on the
proverbial slippery slope.
If the personal decision gets in the
way of one's performance (as current
law covering teachers provides) then
it should be taken into account. But if
the personal choice is not job
related, and does not affect job per
formance, it should not be used as a
basis for hiring/firing.
However, homosexual rights
groups, after fighting the coercive
power of the state, then seek to turn
that power around for their own be
nefit. Homosexual rights ordi
nances, which generally ban dis
crimination by private individuals On

the basis of sexual orientation in
employment, housing, and public
accommodations, have been passed
in about 40 cities across the nation.
Such ordinances have themselves
come under increasing attack and
have been losing — correctly, I think
— but for the wrong reasons. Such
ordinances should not fall because
homosexuality is "immoral," "un
natural," and such; it may or may not
be, but that is a personal judgment
for everyone to make, and it misses
the point.
Rather, such laws violate the rights
of "homophobic" people. Just as the
coercive power of the state should
not be used to affirmatively discrimi
nate against homosexuals, it should
not be used to bludgeon people into
accepting homosexuality in their pri
vate affairs. Private individuals
should be free to associate with, rent
to, and do business with individuals
who meet whatever sexual prefer
ence they wish.
Freedom to be wrong
Homosexuals can make their per
sonal choice, to live as openly as they
wish. They should then be willing to
accept the problems that go with that
choice, without calling in the state.
Though I don't believe discrimina
tion against homosexuals is correct
— despite my own personal moral/
religious qualms about homosexual
ity — I don't believe the state should
coerce those who believe otherwise.
Ralph Raico, a noted libertarian, cor
rectly noted in this context that
"freedom, in our understanding,
implies also the freedom to be
wrong."
Affirmative discrimination by the
state against homosexuals is wrong,
and should be opposed. But state ac
tion suppressing the prejudices of
people against a voluntary lifestyle
decision is also wrong.
As columnist Max Lerner noted:
"If they have the right—as they do —
to their own personal sexual orienta
tion, they can't complain if the major
ity chooses to assert its own right of
choice to a heterosexually-oriented
society."
The freedom of people to choose
their own lifestyle should not abro
gate the freedom of people to run
their own lives based on their opin
ions of those lifestyle choices.
