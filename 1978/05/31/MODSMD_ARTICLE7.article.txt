The 1977-78 residence agreement
states, "Dues are determined by a
vote of the house a quarter in ad
vance . . . Houses which elect to
charge dues ot all members of the
house may have these dues collected
on the University room and board
bills ... If the association assesses
dues from its members, you will be
responsible for payment of such
dues."
The quotes from the residence ag
reement given in the last paragraph
very specifically state the terms
which must be met for a monetary
charge to 1) qualify as the housedues
residents have agreed to pay and 2)
be. charged on the room and board
bills. The terms can hardly be ob
jected to.
Since these terms were entirely set
by residential education, why don't
they honor them? It's true that some
dorms hold a fair election to deter
mine whether or not house dues will
be charged, who will have to pay
them, how much will be charged,
and whether or not payment will be
made through the room and board
bills.
But it is also true that some local
staffs (who are not supposed to have
any power in house associations) de
termine dues on their own and in
some dorms so called "house gov
ernments" determine dues even
though those governments have
never been given the authority to do
so-
This is a clear violation of the resi
dence agreement yet residential
education will not stop it and unless
you send a lawyer they will not re
move the charges from your bill nor
will they refund your money.
The result of such practices is
sftown in one dorm, where the resi
dents have paid almost $10,000 in
house dues yet the majority of resi
dents have had no hand in determin
ing the dues nor have they benefited
at all from them.
Since residential education col
lected charges which, because they
did not meet the terms of the resi
dence agreement, were not due

them, unless residential education
starts refunding money they ap
pear guilty of grand larceny.
It is unlikely that students can ex
pect any remedy to this situation in
the future. As students will discover
in the next few days the 1978-79 resi
dence agreement has been changed
to allow the local staff to determine
house dues.
Technically the new agreement
states that the local staff and the resi
dents of the house will determine

house dues. But since it is not
specific as to how each party will af
fect the determination and given the
history of residential education it
doesn't take a genius to figure out
that the local staff will be able to
charge whatever it damn well
pleases.
So what if the students get fucked
over, they don't matter anyway,
right?
