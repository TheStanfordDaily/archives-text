# Bakkian quotas unfair

An issue of recent interest in the
news has been that of the Bakke
case, now before the U.S. Supreme
Court. That the Bakke case has illi
cited such widespread interest and
analysis from both the press and the
various concerned public groups
points to the fundamental impor
tance of the underlying issue, that of
preferential scrutinization afforded
minority students during the admis
sions process' by our 119 medical
schools.
Presently there are approximately
350,000 physicians practicing
medicine in the United States, with
6000 of those from the different
minority groups. That there exists a
real discrepancy between the actual
number of minority physicians prac
ticing medicine and the total number
of minority citizens in the United
States has prompted the HEW and
other governmental agencies to
support an active program to bring
more numbers of minority students
into our medical schools.
In my mind, any type of preferen
tial consideration toward a particular
group of applicants can do no good
in promoting a more balanced rep
resentation of minority physicians in
our national ranks of specialty and
primary care medical practitioners.
Such a program presupposes that

inherently untair "quota" systems
(i.e., the "quota" at UC-Davis the
year Bakke applied) can justifiably be
used to right the discriminatory prac
tices of past admissions procedures.
This type of thinking is, at every level,
indefensible.
Chosen on individual merits
Thoughtful administrators and
deans of admission committees
might consider a viable alternative to
the present dilemma; simply put,
considereach applicant on his or her
individual merits. (At up to $35 per
application, there is surely enough
capital generated by the application
process to pay for such an individual
approach!)
Then, should it be the understood
policy of a particular admissions
committee to admit a certain number
of minority students, such a personal
approach would allow for those un
written "quotas" to be filled.
We are, in our society, presently
awash in a sea of numbers. The im
personal nature of the application
process to the various medical
schools most certainly carries over
into the following years of academic
and clinical training at some of these
same medical schools.
Inevitably we will have more and
more insensitive, highly technical
scientists attempting to practice the

"art" of medicine. We have a right to
expect more from our future physi
cians.
Impersonal selection
All I have written is but a reitera
tion of thoughts expressed by other
observers of the medical school
selection process. Yet, as a two-time
participant in the application process
who is approaching yet another at
tempt at gaining admittance to medi
cal school, I perhaps feel somewhat
more strongly about the seemingly
inevitable result of an impersonal
selection process.
As badly as I want to practice
medicine, I would not wish to be
come a highly technical, devoid-of
the-human-element physician at the
expense of losing my empathy and
concern for people. Medicine, in the
end, can not best be served by such
an approach to selecting and training
our future physicians.
In the end, the Bakke case, rather
than "righting" any perceived inhe
rent imperfections of the medical
school selection process, will only
more muddle what Americans want
from their health care practitioners;
a sense of caring and appreciation for
the human condition.
