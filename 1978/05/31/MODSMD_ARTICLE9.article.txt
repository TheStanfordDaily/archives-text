(The Daily editorial board r ecommends the following selections on
the June 6 ballot. Rebuttals and other letters on the election should be
submitted to the Daily offices by tonight at 6 p.m.)
Propositions
1 — State School Bond Act — YES
This bond act would provide $350,000,000 for constructing or im
proving public schools. This act will help reduce a school district's
cost in modernizing buildings and-constructing needed facilities as
enrollments grow.
2 — Clean Water and Conservation Bond Act — YES
This bond act would provide $375,000,000 for water pollution con
trol and water conservation. This proposal would help to improve
water quality and reduce the tax burden on local taxpayers.
3 — Tax Exemption of Alternative Energy Systems — YES
This constitutional amendment will allowthe Legislature toexempt
from property taxation any alternative energy system as long as the
system isn't based on fossil or nuclear fuels.
4 — Board of Education — YES
If this passes, any changes concerning the manner, time, term of
appointment, or election to the governing board of a school or
community college board would have to be submitted to the voters of
that district — and not just to the voters of the district's charter city.
5 — Administrative Agencies — YES
This amendment will prevent any state administrative agency from
declaring a statute unconstitutional, declaring a statute unenforce
able, or refusing to enforce a statute without the appropriate appel
late court determination.
6 — Sheriffs — NO
This amendment would force counties to have elected sheriffs.
This provision greatly intrudes upon the right of home-rule. It should
be up to counties to decide whether to elect or appoint their sheriffs,
depending on which is most desired.
7 — Insurance Pooling Arrangements — YES
This amendment will allow local governments to obtain insurance
or to self-insure themselves on a cooperative basis. This will allow
local governments to obtain insurance at the lowest rates.
9 — Judgment Interest Rates — YES
The Legislature will be able under this amendment to set the in
terest rate on court judgment at 10 per cent or less, depending on the
economy. The amendment will allow for fairer consideration of those
involved in court proceedings.
10 — Rehabilitated Property — YES
The amendment will permit the Legislature to exempt from prop
erty taxation a residential dwelling which has been renovated, for up
to five years after the renovation. This will provide incentive for
landlords and homeowners to repair their buildings.
11 — County Owned Real Property — YES
The amendment will permit counties to keep the tax free status on
properties which they continue to own but are located in a recently
created county.
12 — Compensation of State Officials — NO
This amendment would set up an appointed "citizens" commission
which would recommend to the Legislature the salaries of constitu
tional officers, legislators and judges. The legislators could accept or
refuse the commission's recommendations. The commission is not
subject to the voters' control, and thus voters would not have the
power which they have now of preventing a salary increase for state
officials. The best practice is the current one: let the legislators set
officials' salaries — and face the voters at election time.
(Note: Comments on Propositions 8 and 13 will be published Friday.)
