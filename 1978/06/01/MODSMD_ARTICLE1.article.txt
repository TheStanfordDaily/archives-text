# Supreme Court rules against 'Daily'
## Reaction: happiness, concern 
### 
Reactions of the various persons
involved in the seven year litigation
which culminated with yesterday's
decision ranged from happiness to
dismay.
The attorney who represented the
Daily before the Supreme Court,
Jerome Falk, said, "My reaction is
one of great disappointment.
"I have a fear that the result will
be abused," he continued, "and
that it will not just be used against
newspapers, but in other places
where information is stored. Such
places as banks, hospitals, lawyers
offices and other neutral de
positories of data may now be sub
ject to search."
"I'm happy that the highest court
in the land agreed that we were fol
lowing the law when we did what we
did," said Santa Clara County Dis

Daily Editor Dave Ansley
and Associate Editors
Dan Fiduccia and Randy
Keith sharply criticized
the U.S. Supreme Court
for its decision against
the Daily at an afternoon
press conference yester
day in the Daily offices
(above). During the day,
more than 40 represen
tatives of the national
media called the Daily
asking for comment on
the court's ruling. Palo
Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher (right), one of
the petitioners in the
case, sported a grin after
hearing the news that
the high Court had ruled
in his favor, reversing
two lower court deci
sions.
