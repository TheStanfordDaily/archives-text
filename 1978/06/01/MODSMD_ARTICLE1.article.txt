# Supreme Court rules against 'Daily'
## Reaction: happiness, concern 
### 
Reactions of the various persons
involved in the seven year litigation
which culminated with yesterday's
decision ranged from happiness to
dismay.
The attorney who represented the
Daily before the Supreme Court,
Jerome Falk, said, "My reaction is
one of great disappointment.
"I have a fear that the result will
be abused," he continued, "and
that it will not just be used against
newspapers, but in other places
where information is stored. Such
places as banks, hospitals, lawyers
offices and other neutral de
positories of data may now be sub
ject to search."
"I'm happy that the highest court
in the land agreed that we were fol
lowing the law when we did what we
did," said Santa Clara County Dis

Dan Fiduccia and Randy
Keith sharply criticized
the U.S. Supreme Court
for its decision against
the Daily at an afternoon
press conference yester
day in the Daily offices
(above). During the day,
more than 40 represen
tatives of the national
media called the Daily
asking for comment on
the court's ruling. Palo
Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher (right), one of
the petitioners in the
case, sported a grin after
hearing the news that
the high Court had ruled
in his favor, reversing
two lower court deci
sions.
trict Attorney Louis Bergna, one of
the defendants.
Stephen Newton, the attorney
who represented the four Palo Alto
police officers as individuals said
"we're very happy — it's been a long
case. It's a very proper result for the
police officers themselves."
"It was an unfair lower court rul
ing which penalized them for obey
ing a court order," explained New
ton, referring to the search warrant.
Palo Alto City Attorney Robert
Booth commented, "We've felt all
along that our procedures were
constitutional. The warrant is a use
ful and a necessary tool of law en
forcement."
The decision was called "disap
pointing" by President Richard Ly
man. "What is particularly trouble
some is that abuses are most likely
to take place when the target is a

small, independent, perhaps even
politically or socially dissident
newspaper, radio or TV station," he
said.
Former Daily staffers who were
plaintiffs expressed concern and
disappointment over the ruling.
Ed Kohn, former Daily managing
editor, said, "I'm disappointed of
course by what the court did, but
I'm not surprised and I wouldn't be
surprised if because of this, several
newspapers and TV stations an
nounced policies of routine non
retention of notebooks, film, and
other reporters' work product. This
decision will hurt the reading public
the most.
"And this decision could be the
end to the relationships people have
with lawyers, doctors and priests.
Most importantly, one of the
foundations of this country has
been that it is a nation of laws, not of

men — and yet the court now wants
even more discretion placed in the
hands of judges," added Kohn.
Steven Ungar, a former Daily
photographer, said last night, "I'm
concerned because part of the First
Amendment has been abrogated.
I'm not concerned as much about
losing as about how we lost — the
implications are not for us, but for
others. What will happen with the
next Pentagon Papers case? Who
will dare to print them knowing that
they can be searched as soon as
someone finds out they have the
documents?"
J. Barton Phelps, a Santa Clara
County Superior Court judge who
issued the warrant, declined to
comment on the court's decision, as
did federal District Judge Robert
Peckham, who wrote the initial
lower court ruling which the court
reversed yesterday.
