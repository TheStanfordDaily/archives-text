# Prop 13 tops California election
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Califor
nia s congressional delegation
in Washington and the state
Legislature in Sacramento will
contain at least 25 new faces
next year.
Twenty-five California law
makers — 12 Democrats and
13 Republicans — are not
seeking re-election this year to
seats in Congress of the Legis
lature.
And the number could be
considerably higher if the
anti-government tax revolt
anger behind the Proposition
13 campaign spills over into
congressional and legislative
races, as some political
analysts believe it might.
Proposition 13, the $7 billion
property tax cut initiative by
crusty tax cut crusader How
ard larvis, is the overriding
issue of 1978.
As a protest against the
status quo — which millions of
voters equate with taxes that
are too high — Proposition 13
is a threat to incumbents of
both parties, but particularly
to Democrats, who are more
closely identified in voters
minds with spending prog
rams.
Whether that anger recedes
by Nov. 7, when voters make
the final decision on the 1978
elections, is a question mark.
But the tax initiative ques
tion has interjected itself, in a
major or minor way, in every
campaign in the June b race,
where dozens of incumbents
face primary election opposi
tion.
Here is a brief rundown on
the primary races:
Congress — Democrats cur
rently have a 29-14 majority
over Republicans in Califor
nia's congressional delegation,
the biggest state delegation in

Washington.
But four Democrats and three
Republicans are retiring this
year, including the two
Californians with the most
seniority in Congress and both
women members of the
California delegation.
Only 10 congressional in
cumbents face opposition
from within their own party in
the primary, and one con
gressman, Republican john
Rousselot of San Marino, is
unopposed in either party.
Some attention-getting races
in November are expected to
include the bid by Democrat
)ohn McFall of Manteca for a
12th term and the campaign of
Republican Robert Dornan of
Redondo Beach for a second
term.
McFall has been troubled by

stories about gifts from Park.
Dornan's opponent may be
Carey Peck, a congressional
consultant and the son of actor
Gregory Peck, if Peck wins a
three-way Democratic prim
ary.
Slate Senate — Republicans
should have a good chance this
year to reduce the Democrats'
current 26-14 majority in the
California Senate, because 17
of the 20 seats up for election
this year are held by Democ
rats.
However, it might not work
out that way.
All three Republicans whose
terms expire this year are retir
ing, including one in a district
where registration figures give
Democrats a strong chance of
winning. Only one Democrat is
retiring, and his district is

Democratic in registration by a
4-1 margin.
State Assembly — Democrats
now have a commanding 57-23
majority in the Assembly, their
biggest in a century, so Repub
licans believe they have
nowhere to go but up.
That's not certain, though, as
seven Democrats and seven
Republicans are retiring. That
means the COP will have the
advantage of incumbency in
only 16 districts, compared to
50 for Democrats.
The big question is not con
trol of the lower house, which
appears firmly in Democratic
hands for another two years,
but whether Republicans can
pick up the four seats needed
to deny Democrats the two
thirds majority which assures
almost complete control.
