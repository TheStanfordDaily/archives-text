# High court rules water not mineral
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Water is
not a "valuable mineral" as de
fined by federal law and there
fore may not legally be re
trieved from public lands, the
Supreme Court ruled unanim
ously yesterday.
The justices reversed a lower
court's ruling that the Interior
Department had claimed
would "unsettle the law of
water rights throughout the
western states, drawing into
question the validity of private
rights long thought to be estab
lished."
A group of water-short states
in the West and upper Midwest
had sided with the federal gov
ernment. The states included
Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Ore
gon, South Dakota,
Washington and Wyoming.
Federal mining law provides
that "all valuable mineral de
posits in lands belonging to the
United States" are "free and
open to exploration and
purchase."

Yesterday the Supreme
Court said the law doesn't
apply to water.
At issue was an interpreta
tion of an 1872 act which allows
individuals or businesses to
mine "valuable minerals" on
public lands. The 9th U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals had ruled
that water must be included
within the act's definition of
"valuable mineral."
The legal controversy began
13 years ago when the Interior
Department sued the Charles
tone Stone Products Co. over
its operations on federally
owned land near Las Vegas,
Nev.
The firm works 25 sand and
gravel mining claims, and the
government's 1965 lawsuit
charged that the claims were
invalid because they were not
based on discovery of a valu
able mineral.
Charlestone had argued
successfully in lower federal
courts that the water it uses to
wash the sand and gravel is a
valuable mineral.
