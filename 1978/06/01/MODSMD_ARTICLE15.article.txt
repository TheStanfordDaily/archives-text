# James Sheehan unravels history, entertains students
## 
### Gary Fremerman 
Feet propped on his office
desk, fingers interlocked be
hind his neck, James Sheehan
does not seem like a history
professor.
A slightly overgrown shock
of brown hair, parted at the left
temple, covers his right ear.
His eyes are blue and he
squints when he speaks.
The desk is littered with pap
ers, and the volumes of books
stacked neatly in floor-to
ceiling shelves tower over him.
Speaking in a deliberate and
well-controlled voice, he
seems more Jike a cautious
government bureaucrat than a
history professor.
Classroom scene
Yet twp hours earlier, he was
pacing the floor in front of the
large classroom, his voice
forceful and undulating, in
formative and theatrical.
Sheehan is a visiting North
western University professor
teaching Modern Europe:
Europe in the 20th century.
Without the help of written
notes, he tries to make logical
and meaningful the often illog

ical and meaningless events of
history.
Standing before rows of stu
dents, he gestures frequently
with his hands, as though
manually framing the specific
events and personalities which
represent larger historical
themes. Using example after
example, he shows, as Marx
said, how men make history,
but not the history they chose
to make.
Students write furiously or
stare at him in silence.
Applause
He concludes the lecture
and glances at his watch. There
is scattered applause, and the
50-minute bell rings seconds
later.
"Professor Sheehan's lec
tures are very dynamic and
rhetorical, very well-organized
and well-thought-out," says
Glenn McDougall, one of eight
teaching fellows assisting
Sheehan.
Says freshman Roger Awad,
"Sheehan's great because he
gets his point across, he's
dynamic, and he doesn't ram

ble. So many professors tend
to ramble."
Framed in the center of his
office window Sheehan is
dressed in a blue cotton shirt,
blue and white stripped tie and
camel pants. He is friendly yet
reserved, as though con
sciously maintaining the ex
pected distance between pro
fessor and student.
No lecture notes
"There's a certain price you
pay for not using lecture notes.
It's not always as elegant or
well-timed as you like," he
says.
"But I feel it's a way of trying
to make some sort of contact,
of preserving some sort of
spontaneity. I don't seek to en
tertain for entertainment's
sake. I try to make things im
mediate and to add a kind of
human concreteness.
"A good story or anecdote
ought to provide a way of mak
ing analysis concrete, to give a
kind of human quality to what
you're saying," he says.
Born 41 years ago in San
Francisco, Sheehan received
his formal education in
California, graduating with
honors from Stanford in 1958.
Education
He obtained his master's de
gree a year later at UC-Berkeley
and his doctorate in 1964, also
at Cal.
"I think the most important

decision I made was to be an
academic, and that was much
more important than whatever
field," he says.
"By the time I graduated
from Stanford I thought of
either philosophy, English or
history, and I chose history by a
process of elimination," he
says.
He almost chose law.
"I guess I asked myself
'Where do I want to spend the
rest of my life, who do I want to
spend the rest of my life with?'
"I wasn't sure. The problem
is one doesn't really know
You're continually making
choices for which you have no
basis," he continues.
Family life
Married for 18 years,
Sheehan and his wife, Elena,
have a 10-year-old boy,
Michael. Outside academic
life, Sheehan enjoys cooking
for them.
After returning to Stanford in
1962 for a brief Western civili
zation teaching stint, Sheehan
joined the faculty of North

western University in 1964 and
is now a full professor there.
His specialty is 19th-century
German liberalism, and his
second book on that subject
will be published this year, .
For one quarter at Stanford,
Sheehan is delivering two lec
tures three days a week and is
coordinating two directed
reading courses.
He is also leading a weekly
discussion section, something
few full professors do.
Discussion sections
"I think the discussion sec
tions are a good way of under
standing how students are ex
periencing the course, rather
than if you just stood out there,
said your piece, and went
home," he says.
Teaching fellow George
Behlmer says he is impressed
with Sheehan's involvement in
the Modern Europe course.
"He's remarkable in that he's
taken such an active role, this
being his only quarter at Stan
ford as a professor. And he's
done it from the second he got

here," Behlmer says.
Poking and rearranging
some papers on his desk,
Sheehan speaks haltingly, as
though carefully choosing his
words, as he considers the im
portance of studying history.
"I think that one of th»
things people have t » learn is
how to put themselves in other
people's shoes, and to imagine
what life is like for people quite
different from themselves.
"All of us need to find ways
to get beyond our own experi
ence, and to see what it's like
to be in a very different sort of
world. I think history is one
very good way to do that," he
says.
Sense of histrionic
"Sheehan is clearly a histo
rian who has a sense of the his

trionic, in that he's true to his
subject," says Behlmer. "He
doesn't distort for the sake of
entertaining, and yet he in
teracts with his material in a
way that is entertaining and ab
sorbing
'So* one who is as clearly
interest 'd in the material and
involvt as Sheehan can't hel|
but be an interesting lecturer,"
Behlmer adds.
Does Sheehan consider
himself a typical academic, part
of the professional "mold?"
The professor moves his feet
from desk top to floor, and
smoothes a clump of hair to
ward his right ear.
"I think of myself as being
part of the mold. I don't think
of myself as moldy, though,"
he says with a slight smile.
