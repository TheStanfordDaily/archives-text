## jazz/ted gioia Berkeley's jazz festival: generally exceptional 
### 
For those who were able to
withstand the scorching temp
erature, Sunday's Jazz Festival
at Berkeley featured several
outstanding performances.
The surprise of the after
noon was the fantastic set by
Eddie Jefferson, Richie Cole
and the Ceorge Cable trio.
Cole's playing on alto, deeply
rooted in the styles of masters
such as Phil Woods, Lee
Konitz and Charlie Parker, was
first-rate in every sense; his
playing on standards such as
"Cherokee" and"I Can't Get
Started" clearly show that Cole
possesses the two necessary
strengths for great improvis
ing: excellent technique and
abundance of ideas.
Stellar
Cole was joined by Eddie Jef
ferson for the concluding
chorus of "Cherokee;" Jeffer

son followed with stellar rendi
tions of "So What," "Parker's
Mood," "Lady Be Good" and
"I'm in the Mood for Love."
On the latter song Jefferson
sang, in a high falsetto, the
bridge of the song which was
written for a female accom
panist. Returning to the main
theme Jefferson kept his voice
under more control than usual
(the squeaks and sudden turns
have become integral parts of
his style).
Peterson
Following Jefferson was
Oscar Peterson who played
what was, for him, an unusu
ally long set. Peterson played
quite a few songs from the
latest Pablo Montreux collec
tion, including "People,"
"Tenderly" and "Perdido,"
the latter song taken at a slow
almost dirge-like tempo.

Peterson is a very consistent
performer and his music
swung despite the oppressive
afternoon heat. Peterson was
joined by drummer Louie
Bellson and bassist Ray Brown,
both of whom are masters on
their respective instruments.
Herbie Hancock and his all
star trio followed Peterson and
played an introspective but dis
jointed set. In recent months
Hancock's work on acoustic
piano has been generally ex
ceptional. His playing at the re
cent benefit for KJAZ showed
Hancock to be in fine form.
Things did not cohere so well
at the Berkeley date. Augment
ing the problem was poor
sound amplification which
made Ron Carter's bass sound
over-bearing and heavy
handed.
The trio snapped out of their

lethargy for the encore, which
was a stirring rendition of
"Maiden Voyage." Through
out the concert Hancock was
able to create moments of in
terest but was largely incapable
of producing a well-developed
solo over the long run.
However
The concert was opened by
Night Flyte which was followed
by the enfant terrible of Jazz-
Rock, Noel Pointer. The festi
val would have been consider
ably improved had both these
artists stayed home. Pointer is
technically fluent but lacks in
spiration. Perhaps this is par
tially due to the second-rate
musicians he plays with. The
only merit of "Night Flyte" was
their lead singer who could do
adequate hand-stands bet
ween vocals.


Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers — plus a special guest as yet unannounced — will be appearing
in Mem Aud on Saturday, at 8 p.m.
