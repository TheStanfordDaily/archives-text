## ACT and 'The National Health' 
### 
God help you if you're ever
sick in England.
After witnessing the "Na
tional Health" system secon
dhand, courtesy playwright
Peter Nichols and the Ameri
can Conservatory Theatre
(ACT), I can say with a
minimum of certainty that I
would rather pay to die in an
antiseptic American hospital
than subject myself to the
humiliations and dehumaniz
ing treatments that prevail in
some of the larger British hos
pitals free of charge.
' "The National Health" is a
merciless satire of Britain's
awesome system of free "cra
dle to grave" health care,
begun in 1948 with good inten
tions that have apparently
been forgotten over the years.
From the moment the curtain
is lifted to reveal six ancient
cots occupied by six de
teriorating old people with
numbers above their heads,
the viewer gets the message.
Though the business here may
be life and death, business is
business.
Very black
This is humor of the blackest
kind: cries from the patients
of "please don't do that" and
"get your bloody hands off
me" are interspersed with wry
comments from the hospital
staff ("cheer up, you're still
alive"). Doctors parade
through the ward but never
stop; overworked interns look
at the patients for four sec
onds and hand out diagnoses,
then collapse on top of them;
nurses with funny accents hug
their clipboards and demand
to know of the patients if they
have had a bowel movement.
Life for the bedridden is an
endless series of therapies:
electrotherapy, physio
therapy, occupational
therapy; the patients are told
when to sleep, when to eat,
when to smoke, when to uri

nate; they are ogled and
cajoled and brutally manhan
dled. It's all so horrible, it's
funny.
Why is it funny? Because
even though it is all a bit
exaggerated, it is based on
truth, and if we took it seri
ously, we would become very
depressed indeed. So we
laugh instead.
No lecture
Rather than lecture his audi
ence about the evils of
socialized medicine or the in
eptitude of the British medical
bureaucracy, Nichols has cho
sen to give us an intimate, in
side look at an established in
stitution of healing. What goes
on is appalling, irreverant and
yes, very, very funny.
James R. Winker is the
ghoulish master of cere
monies. He plays a slimy, vag

uely sadistic orderly who ad
dresses the audience directly
and grabs a microphone
whenever it's time for the soap
opera, which he narrates.
Complete with organ ac
companiment, the soap opera
scenes are episodes from the
lives of the hospital staff.
Shown on stage for our view
ing pleasure, as well as for the
patients', these scenes, which
include a pre-kidney trans
plant tango, are among the
most amusing in the play.
Somewhere in the middle of
the second act, though, the
play runs out of gas. Sup
posedly "meaningful" silences
turn to dead air and a few
tedious types are given a
chance to stand on their soap
boxes and pontificate. It's too
bad, because it had such a
promising beginning.
Too much, too long
Instead of becoming clearer
and more forceful, the mes
sage gets confused because
the play tries to say too many
things. It deals with death,
sickness, interracial marriage,

alcoholism, old people, young
people; it goes on way too
long and yet is somehow in
complete. "Why didn't this
end an hour ago?" I asked my
self upon leaving the theater. I
would also like to ask Mr.
Nichols.
ACT put on a beautiful pro
duction. The set truly brought
the term "hospital green" to
life; even things that weren't
green seemed green, includ
ing some of the more decrepit
patients. The acting was virtu
ally flawless, particularly that
of Sydney Walker as a patient
who is not allowed to die.
When someone says to him
"good life is precious,"
Walker retorts with "good
death is too, if you can get it."
There are a few more per
formances of "The National
Health" before ACT starts its
summer season. Despite its
floundering finish, it is still
good theater, a black comedy
with a greenish tinge that
makes one laugh and think at
the same time.
