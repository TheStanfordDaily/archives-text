# 'The Pentagon Papers could never have been published'
## Editors nationwide pan ruling 
### Associated Press 
Newspaper editors took sharp ob
jection yesterday when the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled police with
warrants may search a newspaper
office for criminal evidence. "Just
plain awful," "terrible," "incredi
ble," were the judgments of several
prominent editors.
Many said freedom of the press
had been eroded — that it will be
easier for officials to interfere with
newspaper operations, and it will be
harder for reporters to work in con
fidence with sources.
Benjamin Bradlee, executive
editor of the Washington Post, said
that under the ruling, "the Pentagon
Papers could never have been pub
lished. The police would have en
tered newspaper offices and seized
them, before newspapers could
bring the facts to the people.
"If this decision were in force dur
ing Watergate, it requires no stretch
of the imagination to see police in
these offices on a regular basis on a
fishing expedition for Messrs. Ni
xon, Mitchell, Haldeman,
Ehrlichman and company. The re
quirement of a warrant is no real
protection, for the government can
always find a judge to issue a war
rant. It's just plain awful," he said.
'Terrible decision'
Bill Thomas, editor of the Los
Angeles Times, said, "I find it an in
credible decision, a terrible deci
sion. It's hard to believe that a ra
tional court could issue it.
"It seems clear from the language
of the decision that Justice White
neither cares much nor knows much
about the problems of the press, but
then he's demonstrated that before.
I simply think it's going to take us
some time to figure out how to live
with this blanket authorization for
search parties to walk in the door
with a slip of paper giving them ac
cess to our files."
Thomas said the decision seems
to indicate police could seek search
warrants to examine reporters'
notes.
"They could take a reporter's
story on a crime to the judge and
say, 'this guy probably knows more
than he told in the story.' I can see
no end to this thing," he said.

"What are you going to do?"
asked Bob Healy, executive editor of
the Boston Globe. "You're going to
have to keep your notes in your
pocket." Several editors also
suggested that by the same logic,
police could search lawyers' files
next.
Complete misapplication
"I think the ruling is a complete
misapplication of search warrants
and that subpoenas for specific in
formation are a more proper way to
get information if they want it," said
Barclay Jameson, managing editor of
the New Mexican in Santa Fe, and
president of the Associated Press
Managing Editors Association.
"This allows police simply to in
vade newspaper offices at will to
search for things which are totally
undefined," he said. "It could easily
be used as harassment to prevent
the production of a newspaper."
And, he added, "I would assume the
court would rule that search war
rants could be used to invade a
lawyer's office."
Jerry Friedheim, executive vice
president and general manager of
the American Newspaper Publishers
Association (ANPA) in Reston, Va.,
said ANPA was "extremely disap
pointed . . . We believe the guaran
tees of the First and Fourth Amend
ments could be substantially eroded
by the opinion. It appears that
police attempts to secure informa
tion from a newspaper about possi
ble crimes by others may no longer
be afforded the full due process re
quirements of a subpoena.
Overzealous officers
"Rather, the court seems to have
left open a back door that could
allow overzealous law enforcement
officers to present only their side to
a magistrate, obtain a warrant, and
then raid the news and editorial
rooms of a newspaper."
Keith Fuller, president and gen
eral manager of The AP, called the
decision "disappointing" and ad
ded, "My main concern is that this
could open the door to harassment
in situations where local authorities
are irritated over news coverage."
Mitch Farris, news director of
KRON-TV, called the decision "ex
tremely distressing" and said the

decision gives police officers "rights
bordering on totalitarianism." He
said he thought most law enforce
ment officers would not abuse the
rights they were granted by the rul
ing but "I worry about the bad ap
ples."
Crazed, maniacal
Farris said, "there is going to be
some police chief who has some
crazed, maniacal idea and is going to
come in and ransack a television sta
tion or a newspaper."
International Association of Police
Chiefs spokesman Bill Ellingsworth
said news media had overreacted:
"Police are not going to stage
wholesale raids on newsrooms
around the country. I don't think it
is as sinister as it may appear to
people."
Nevertheless, many editors ex
pressed concern over how to handle
confidential files in the future.
John Leard, executive editor of
the Richmond, Va., Times-Dispatch,
said the decision will "raise ques
tions about what material in the
form of notes and photographs
should be obtained or retained,"
and "makes it imperative to find
ways to keep the gathering of news
separate from the inadvertent
gathering of evidence for other pur
poses."

that under the ruling, "the Pentagon
Papers could never have been pub
lished. The police would have en
tered newspaper offices and seized
them, before newspapers could
bring the facts to the people.
"If this decision were in force dur
ing Watergate, it requires no stretch
of the imagination to see police in
these offices on a regular basis on a
fishing expedition for Messrs. Ni
xon, Mitchell, Haldeman,
Ehrlichman and company. The re
quirement of a warrant is no real
protection, for the government can
always find a judge to issue a war
rant. It's just plain awful," he said.
'Terrible decision'
Bill Thomas, editor of the Los
Angeles Times, said, "I find it an in
credible decision, a terrible deci
sion. It's hard to believe that a ra
tional court could issue it.
"It seems clear from the language
of the decision that Justice White
neither cares much nor knows much
about the problems of the press, but
then he's demonstrated that before.
I simply think it's going to take us
some time to figure out how to live
with this blanket authorization for
search parties to walk in the door
with a slip of paper giving them ac
cess to our files."
Thomas said the decision seems
to indicate police could seek search
warrants to examine reporters'
notes.
"They could take a reporter's
story on a crime to the judge and
say, 'this guy probably knows more
than he told in the story.' I can see
no end to this thing," he said.

"What are you going to do?"
asked Bob Healy, executive editor of
the Boston Globe. "You're going to
have to keep your notes in your
pocket." Several editors also
suggested that by the same logic,
police could search lawyers' files
next.
Complete misapplication
"I think the ruling is a complete
misapplication of search warrants
and that subpoenas for specific in
formation are a more proper way to
get information if they want it," said
Barclay Jameson, managing editor of
the New Mexican in Santa Fe, and
president of the Associated Press
Managing Editors Association.
"This allows police simply to in
vade newspaper offices at will to
search for things which are totally
undefined," he said. "It could easily
be used as harassment to prevent
the production of a newspaper."
And, he added, "I would assume the
court would rule that search war
rants could be used to invade a
lawyer's office."
Jerry Friedheim, executive vice
president and general manager of
the American Newspaper Publishers
Association (ANPA) in Reston, Va.,
said ANPA was "extremely disap
pointed . . . We believe the guaran
tees of the First and Fourth Amend
ments could be substantially eroded
by the opinion. It appears that
police attempts to secure informa
tion from a newspaper about possi
ble crimes by others may no longer
be afforded the full due process re
quirements of a subpoena.
Overzealous officers
"Rather, the court seems to have
left open a back door that could
allow overzealous law enforcement
officers to present only their side to
a magistrate, obtain a warrant, and
then raid the news and editorial
rooms of a newspaper."
Keith Fuller, president and gen
eral manager of The AP, called the
decision "disappointing" and ad
ded, "My main concern is that this
could open the door to harassment
in situations where local authorities
are irritated over news coverage."
Mitch Farris, news director of
KRON-TV, called the decision "ex
tremely distressing" and said the

decision gives police officers "rights
bordering on totalitarianism." He
said he thought most law enforce
ment officers would not abuse the
rights they were granted by the rul
ing but "I worry about the bad ap
ples."
Crazed, maniacal
Farris said, "there is going to be
some police chief who has some
crazed, maniacal idea and is going to
come in and ransack a television sta
tion or a newspaper."
International Association of Police
Chiefs spokesman Bill Ellingsworth
said news media had overreacted:
"Police are not going to stage
wholesale raids on newsrooms
around the country. I don't think it
is as sinister as it may appear to
people."
Nevertheless, many editors ex
pressed concern over how to handle
confidential files in the future.
John Leard, executive editor of
the Richmond, Va., Times-Dispatch,
said the decision will "raise ques
tions about what material in the
form of notes and photographs
should be obtained or retained,"
and "makes it imperative to find
ways to keep the gathering of news
separate from the inadvertent
gathering of evidence for other pur
poses."
Newspaper editors took sharp ob
jection yesterday when the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled police with
warrants may search a newspaper
office for criminal evidence. "Just
plain awful," "terrible," "incredi
ble," were the judgments of several
prominent editors.
Many said freedom of the press
had been eroded — that it will be
easier for officials to interfere with
newspaper operations, and it will be
harder for reporters to work in con
fidence with sources.
