Consumers battered by price hike
Washington — Consumers were battered by a 2.4 per
cent monthly increase in grocery prices in April and a
0.9 per cent hike in overall prices, the worst in more
than a year, the government said yesterday.
The price of beef was up by a record 6.6 per cent
during the month, surpassing the previous monthly
high of 6.5 per cent in May 1975.
The rise in consumer beef prices is restoring profita
bility to the cattle industry, but it comes after four years
of economic hardship, cattlemen say.
The increase prompted administration inflation
fighter Robert Strauss to call for consumers to shop for
cheaper cuts of beef. He said beef prices have gone up
"too far and too fast" despite years of depressed cattle
prices.
He said the administration may allow increased im
ports of foreign beef to help counter the rise.
The April consumer price index confirmed the
gloomy predictions of Carter administration
economists that inflation in the economy is worsening,
although they still expect relief later in the year.
NATO leaders end summit talks
Washington — NATO leaders ended two days of
summit talks yesterday by agreeing to increase military
spending by as much as $100 billion over the next de
cade to counter Soviet military power in Europe.
In agreeing to the proposal to raise their planned
military spending by at least $40 billion through the
1980s, the NATO leaders accepted President Jimmy Car
ter's plea for more military might in Europe.
Carter, in a closing statement to the allied leaders,
promised that the United States would view any attack
on Europe as an attack against the United States and
that retaliation would include the use of nuclear
weapons against the Soviets.
Under the program approved by NATO leaders yes
terday, allied governments committed themselves to
increasing production of tanks, anti-tank weapons and

missiles and upgrading the U.S. capability to speed
entire U.S. armored divisions across the Atlantic in
event of a crisis.
Anti-gay initiative qualifies for ballot
Sacramento — The initiative to let school districts fire
teachers for homosexuality has qualified for the
November ballot, Secretary of State March Fong Eu
announced yesterday.
The initiative, promoted by state Sen. John Briggs
(R-Fullerton), received more than enough signatures to
qualify, the announcement said.
Its qualification brought immediate reaction from a
Quaker-sponsored group that said if enacted, it "would
put California back into the dark ages."
If passed by the voters Nov. 7 and not declared un
constitutional, the initiative would let school districts
fire, or refuse to hire, teachers, teachers' aides, ad
ministrators or counselors for "advocating, soliciting,
imposing, encouraging or promoting private or public
sexual acts . . . between persons of the same sex in a
manner likely to come to the attention of other
employees or students."
Dow Jones climbs 6.41
New York — The stock market chalked up a solid gain
yesterday, apparently shrugging off the latest
consumer-price statistics as old news.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 6.41
to 840.61 on top of a 2.51-point gain Tuesday.
Trading was moderately active.
Today's Weather
Fog or low clouds spreading inland night and morn
ing through tomorrow but clearing to near the coast
during the afternoons. Cooler. Lows in upper 40s to
mid-50s. Highs in upper 50s along coast to near 80
