Committee corrections
The latest appointee to the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) is not Susan Weinstein,'as was
erroneously stated in yesterday's
Daily. Weinstein was appointed to
the Trustee Committee on Invest
ments; the senate actually approved
the appointment of Kayla Templin to
the CIR.
