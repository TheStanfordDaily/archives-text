# ISC chooses new officers
## 
### Ann Lincoln 
There were no landslide elec
tion victories on campus yester
day — at least not as far as the
Inter Sorority Council (ISC) elec
tions were concerned.
Tammy Ritchey of Alpha Phi
was elected as next year's ISC
president. But two revotes were
needed before she finally de
feated opponent Tina Barker.
Barker, of Chi Omega, was later
unanimously elected as vice pres
ident in charge of activities.
Representatives from all six
sororities were present for the
elections.
"I'm excited," Ritchey said
after her victory. "I guess the big
thing is that I really want
sororities to have a good name
on campus. Next year is going to
be our chance to show the school
we're here and that we can be
different."
Barker said she looks forward
to a year of sorority cooperation
and ISC activities that will benefit
the whole university.
Other ISC officers elected were
Heidi Jacobsen of Kappa Kappa

Camma as rush director and Sally
Scandalios of Kappa Alpha Theta
as secretary treasurer, jacobsen,
now at the Stanford Vienna cam
pus, was unanimously elected,
but the votes had to be counted
three times before Scandalios
was named the winner in her

race.
Plans for next year were also
discussed at the meeting. Tenta
tive activities include a tailgate
party and helping with women's
week activities in fall quarter, a
formal during winter quarter,
rush and a street dance for spring
quarter and sherry hours and
guest lecturers throughout the
school year. Holding a Greek
week or weekend in connection
with the street dance was discus
sed, but most of the delegates
thought that some Stanford stu
dents might be opposed to that
idea.
Hadden said a committee has
been appointed to look into the
possibility of an ISC lodge.
Campus groups receive Uni
versity recognition if they have
residential status (campus hous
ing or offices) or do not have a
selective membership. Because
sorority membership is selective,
a campus lodge, a form of resi
dential status, could be a big step
toward official University recog
nition, according to Barker.
