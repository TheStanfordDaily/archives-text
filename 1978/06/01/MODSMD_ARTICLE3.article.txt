# Lower courts reversed; search warrants upheld

### Mike Charlson 
In a major defeat for newsgather
ing organizations, the Supreme
Court ruled yesterday that a news
paper's offices may be searched by
police wielding a search warrant
even if none of its employees is sus
pected of a crime.
In its ruling in Zurcher v. The Stan
ford Daily, the Court struck down
decisions of the federal District
Court for Northern California and
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals by a
5 to 3 vote.
The initial suit filed by the Daily
sought a ruling that a search of its
offices by Palo Alto police officers
looking for evidence against par
ticipants in a Medical Center de
monstration in April 1971 was un
constitutional.
In the majority opinion, written by
Justice Byron White, the Court held
that "the critical element in a
reasonable search is not that the
owner of the property is suspected
of a crime but that there is reasona
ble cause to believe that the specific
'things' to be searched for and
seized are located on the property
to which entry is sought."

Rejected arguments
The Court also rejected Daily ar
guments that newsgathering opera
tions would be disrupted and confi
dential sources lost if searches were
allowed.
"Properly administered, the pre
conditions for a warrant — probable
cause, specificity with respect to the
place to be searched and the things
to be seized, and overall reasona
bleness — should afford sufficient
protection against the harms that are
assertedly threatened by warrants
for searching newspaper offices,"
the Court opinion stated.
The 39-page set of opinions in
cluded a strongly worded dissent by
Justice Potter Stewart, with which
Justice Thurgood Marshall concur
red. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote
an additional dissent.
Chief Justice Warren Burger and
Associate Justices Harry Blackmun,
Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist
joined White for the Court. Justice
William Brennan did not participate
in the decision due to illness.
Swift reaction
Reaction to the decision was swift.
Daily Editor David Ansley said, "We
are appalled at the Supreme Court's
cavalier attitude toward freedom of
the press. It's a sad day in the history
of the U.S. press when the High
Court condones surprise searches
of newspaper offices by police look
ing for evidence against other par
ties."
Edward Kohn, 1971 Daily manag
ing editor and a plaintiff in the suit,
called the decision "Richard Nixon's
greatest legacy."
And Jack Landau, director of the
Reporter's Committee for Freedom
of the Press called the decision "a
constitutional outrage."
Petitioner in the case Palo Alto
Police Chief James Zurcher said he
had not seen the decision, but said
he had "long felt our position was a
good one." He said he was pleased
with the court's ruling.
'Sensiti\ e to issues'
"We will be sensitive to issues that
affect the needs of the press,"
Zurcher said. "It has long been our
position that the press needs to op
erate in a free and unchilled atmos
phere. However, it sometimes may
be necessary to search and seize
from third parties."
The lower courts had held that the
First and Fourth Amendments

forbade issuance of a warrant to
search third parties unless there is
proved probable cause to believe a
subpoena would be impracticable.
The District Court also held that
when a newspaper is involved, addi
tional First Amendment interests are
at stake, so that a search warrant
could be used "only where there is a
clear showing that 1) important
materials will be destroyed or re
moved from the jurisdiction; and 2)
a restraining order would be futile."

'Sweeping revision'
White's 19-page majority opinion
blasted Chief Judge Robert Pec
kham's District Court opinion cal
ling it a "sweeping revision" of the
Fourth Amendment which no fed
eral court had authority to make.
Moreover, the Court ruling
stated, "the reasons presented by
the District Court and adopted by
the Court of Appeals for arriving at
its remarkable conclusion do not
withstand analysis.
"It is untenable to conclude that
property may not be searched un
less its occupant is reasonably sus
pected of crime and is subject to
arrest," the majority stated.
Balance struck

"As we understand the Fourth
Amendment . . . valid warrants to
search property may be issued when
it is satisfactorily demonstrated to
the magistrate that fruits, instrumen
talities or evidence of a crime is lo
cated on the premises. The Fourth
Amendment has itself struck a ba
lance between privacy and public
need, and there is no occasion or
justification for a court to revise the
Amendment and strike a new ba
lance by denying the search warrant
in the circumstances present
here. . . the Court stated.
In his opinion, White said protec
tion from potential threats to First
Amendment rights of free press
would be afforded through proper
administration of rules pertaining to
issuance of warrants.
"There is no reason to believe . . .
that magistrates cannot guard
against searches of the type, scope
and instrusiveness that would actu
ally interfere with the timely publica
tion of a newspaper," the opinion
stated.
"Nor, if the requirements of
specificity and reasonableness are
properly applied, policed and ob
served, will there be any occasion or
opportunity for officers to rummage
at large in newspaper files or to in
trude or to deter normal editorial
and publication decisions.

"Nor are we convinced . . . that
confidential sources will disappear
and that the press will suppress
news because of fears of warranted
searches," the Court said.
But in his dissent, Stewart disag
reed with the Court's First Amend
ment analysis:
"It seems to me self-evident that
police searches of newspaper of
fices burden the freedom of the
press," he said.
"It requires no blind leap of faith
to understand that a person who
gives information to a journalist only
on condition that his identity will
not be revealed will be less likely to
give that information if he knows

0 that, despite the journalist's assur
s ance, his identity may in fact be dis
a closed ... It seems obvious to me
that a journalist's access to informa
it tion, and thus the public's, will
- thereby be impaired," Stewart said,
e Police injured
t The search by Palo Alto police of
a the Daily offices on April 12, 1971
t occurred after a violent demonstra
tion at the Medical Center three
) days before in which nine police of
ficers were injured.
Seeking identities of possible as
-1 sailants, police obtained a search
warrant from Municipal Judge Bar
■ ton Phelps to search Daily offices,
112 Four officers did search through
■ Daily photo files and desks, but they
found nothing.
; According to University News
' Service officials, the search, ironi
cally, was unnecessary.
Robert Beyers, director of the
News Service, said yesterday,"I
personally informed . . . Zurcher
shortly after the sit-in that a Stanford
police photographer had the only
sequence of pictures showing the
breakout from the barricades at the
hospital," he said.
Hundreds of photos
Medical Center News Service
Chief Spyros Andreopoulos said
yesterday that his staff had taken
"hundreds of photos" of the de
monstration which, he had in
formed Zurcher, were available.
According to Andreopoulos, after
he informed Zurcher about the pic
tures, he was never contacted about
them again. "The next morning, I
picked up the paper and read about
the raid on the Daily offices," he
said.
The Daily has 10 days to petition
for a rehearing before the High
Court, but Ansley said it was un
likely that it would.
"The decision was one which
clearly has national implications,"
Ansley said. He said the interest in
the case is a good example of that.
Yesterday the Daily was contacted
for comment by more than 40 sepa
rate newsgathering organizations
from around the country. All three
major networks carried the story on
national news programs.
Newsmen comment
Comments from newsmen from
across the country bemoaned the
decision, pointing out that it means
that not just newspapers, but all citi
zens may be subject to warranted
searches as a result of the ruling.
In his dissent attacking the Court's
Fourth Amendment analysis, Ste
vens pointed this out, stating:
"Countless law abiding citizens —
doctors, lawyers, merchants, cus
tomers, bystanders — may have
documents in their possession that
relate to an ongoing criminal inves
tigation. The consequences of sub
jecting this large category of persons
to unannounced police searches are
extremely serious."
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, a na
tionally known constitutional scho
lar at the Law School, said he does
not feel the decision was "as crush
ing a defeat for the press as it is
likely to be represented as being.
"Justice Powell's vote was essen
tial to the decision," Cunther said.
"His concurrence emphasizes that
there is considerable room for rec
ognizing the First Amendment val
ues special to the press in the is
suance of search warrants."
Cunther said he was not surprised
at the decision, but thought it was
"regrettable. I happen to agree with
