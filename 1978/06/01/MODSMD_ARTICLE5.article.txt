## Zurcher v. Stanford Daily 
### 
Once again, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the
foundations which underlie our most fundamental freedoms
— the freedom to be secure in our homes and offices from
unreasonable searches, and the freedom of the press.
In deciding Zurcher v. The Stanford Daily, the high Court
ruled yesterday that a judge may issue a search warrant di
rected at third parties not suspected of a crime — including
newspapers from the Daily to the Washington Post — if he
has probable cause to believe that the party possesses evi
dence of a crime.
We believe that the Court's decision represents a green
light for law enforcement agencies to search newsrooms for
files, tapes, film and even reporters' confidential notes.
The search of the Daily's offices on April 12, 1971 was
unprecedented in the history of American journalism. How
ever, since then, nine other newspapers and radio and televi
sion stations have been subjected to similar, surprise
searches.
There is every reason to believe that searches of news
organizations by warrant-bearing policemen will be an in
creasingly used investigative technique, now that the Sup
reme Court has given its approval. In the long run, of course,
the reading and listening public will suffer the consequences.
As Justice Potter Stewart wrote in his dissenting opinion in
the Daily case, "The end result, wholly inimical to the First
Amendment, will be a diminishing flow of potentially impor
tant information to the public." We couldn't agree more.
Knowing that the newsroom is s'ibject to surprise search at
any moment, editors and reporters will certainly be more
hesitant to investigate criminal activity and government
wrongdoing. And, quite understandably, formerly "confiden
tial" sources will be much less likely to talk to reporters who
can no longer protect their identity.
In an affidavit filed in the HiHy r.ise, New York Times
reporter Douglas Kneeland said, "It will matter not that the
newspaper or the individual (reporter) is an unwilling ac
complice of the government A n io omplice he will be, his
hardwon reputation for independence shattered. Doors will
be closed. And the public will be deprived of much that it has
the right and need to know."
Yesterday's Supreme Court decision may also have serious
implications for a broad range of individuals who have infor
mation about a crime, but are not suspected of committing it.
Justice Stevens wrote, "Countless law abiding citizens — doc
tors, lawyers, merchants, customers, bystanders — may have
documents in their possession that relate to an ongoing crim
inal investigation." Under yesterday's decision, all would be
subject to surprise searches by police
