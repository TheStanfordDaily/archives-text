# Tuition tax credits, election board
## Tax Credit proposal 
### 
The Congress is currently considering a proposed tax credit for the
parents of college students. Congress is looking at proposals which
are not based on need, and thus we hope the Congress will instead
approve President Jimmy Carter's proposal to add more than $1
billion to existing financial aid programs, which are based on need.
Carter's proposal will help both middle-class families and students
who attend private universities. We feel Carter's proposal is more
sensible and equitable, and we join the University in endorsing it.
Election Review Board commended
The Election Review Board has delivered to the ASSU Senate its
final report on last fall's senate campaign and election, and has thus
finished its task. We 3gain commend the ERB for the diligence and
time they have spent since they were appointed.
Though we wish the 200-page report had been finished a bit
sooner, we feel it was worth waiting for. The report clearly and fully
details the problems and events of last fall, and the record of the
board's investigation should serve as a valuable precedent to the
community.
We hope next year's Senate will carefully consider all of the ERB's
cogent recommendations. The length of the report may scare some
people, but the report is well worth reading, particularly for those
who think its impossible for the ASSU to do anything correctly and
well.
