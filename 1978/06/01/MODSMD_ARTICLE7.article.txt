# PLO: freedom fighters or terrorists?

The Arab propaganda machine in
the United States, financed to the
tune of 50 million dollars per year by
oil-rich Saudi Arabia, is attempting to
portray the Israelis as brutal murder
ers who prey on innocent Arab civi
lians.
But they are, in fact, projecting
their own deeds onto the very vic
tims of those deeds.
The list of massacres perpetrated
on the Jews of Palestine and Israel by
their Arab neighbors is nearly end
less. In the years 1929 and 1936-9,
hundreds of Jewish men, women,
and children were massacred in the
Hulda and Hebron riots incited by
Haj Amin el Husseini, the Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem who convinced
his friend Adolf Hitler to extermi
nate the Jews in Europe.
In more recent years, just to name
a few cases, the PLO-sponsored Red
Army terrorists massacred 27 tourists
at Lod Airport on May 30,1972. Seven
innocent Israeli athletes were brut
ally murdered by Palestinian ter
rorists at the 1972 Olympics, 24
schoolchildren were murdered in
1974 at Maalot, 18 Israelis massacred
in 1974 at Kiryat Shmoneh. And only
this year, PLO "heroes" hijacked a
bus containing civilian bus drivers
and their wives and children return
ing from a weekend holiday — and
massacred 34 of them.
Non-military targets
So far the "brave" terrorists of the
PLO have yet to find the courage to
attack a military target. Rather, they
choose to blow up school buses and
to place bombs in crowded mar
ketplaces, where innocent men,
women and children are indiscrimi
nately destroyed. In the last decade,
Arab terrorism has killed 1131 and
wounded 2471.
And yet, with their reprehensible
history of murder, the Arabs are play
ing the oldest game in the history of
politics; accusing the other side of
the crimes which in fact, they them
selves have committed.
Every propaganda article written
by the Arabs includes mention of the
so-called "massacre" at Deir Yassin
in 1948. (Strangely enough, even the
propagandists cannot find another
example of so-called acts of ter

rorism committed against the Arabs).
But let us take a closer look at what
actually happened on April 10, 1948
at Deir Yassin.
On Nov. 29, 1947, the United Na
tions voted that Palestine be par
titioned into an Arab and a Jewish
State. But on May 15,1948, when the
tiny State of Israel declared its inde
pendence, it was immediately in
vaded by the combined armies of
Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and
Syria, whose stated goal was to an
nihilate the Jews in Israel. (Egypt and
Jordan ended up occupying and il
legally annexing the Gaza Strip and
the West bank, which were to be the
major portions of the Palestinian
Arab State).
War of extermination
Even before this full scale invasion,
on Nov. 30,1947, the Palestine Arabs,
Arab League, and The Arab States
declared war on the UN resolution
and the Palestinian Jewish commun
ity.
In the course of this war of exter
mination, the Arab armies attempted
to capture Jerusalem by placing it
under siege and starving its 150,000
Jewish civilian occupants. The major

access route for food and supplies Uv
Jerusalem, the Tp' Aviv lerusalem
road, was being continuously blor
kaded and shelled from the small
Arab villages overlooking the road
from the hills.
Deir Yassin was one of these vil
lages, the other was called Castel.
Both villages were heavily fortified
and militarily interconnected. The
Haganah, the Jewish Defense Force,
took the town of Castel in a battle in
which they lost many men. And the
second of these villages holding
Jerusalem under siege, Deir Yassin,
was to be assaulted by the Irgun, the
smaller Jewish paramilitary force.
Warning broadcasted
In early dawn of April 10, 1948, a
small truck with a loudspeaker, ac
companying the 100 poorly-armed
Jewish soldiers, drove near the vil
lage entrance, and broadcast a warn
ing in Arabic that an attack was immi
nent, and all civilian non
combatants should evacuate.
About 200 villagers did leave; none
were harmed, and all were after
wards released in the Arab part of
Jerusalem. The actual battle began
when the Palestine Arab and Iraqi

p?r ' or h.:"g out white flags near
the ent"nre.
The advance party of the Irgun was
met by a hail of fire as it approached;
the commarid°r was hit. Fierce
house-to-house fighting followed;
most of the stone buildings were de
fended hotly, and were captured
only after grenades were thrown in
side.
When the fighting ended, the 100
Irgun soldiers had four dead, 41
casualties. In the captured houses
they were horrified to find bodies of
women and children alongside the
combatant Palestinians and Iraqis.
Innocent victims
Whatever was their reason for not
leaving after the broadcast warnings,
they were innocent victims of a cruel
war; and the responsibility for their
deaths rests squarely upon the Arab
soldiers whose duty it was — under
any rule of war — to evacuate them
the moment they turned Deir Yassin
into a fortress, long before the battle
for the village began.
A statement by Yunes Ahmad As
sad, an inhabitant of Deir Yassin who
survived the battle, appeared in the
April 9, 1955 Jordanian Daily "Al Ur
dun":
"The Jews never intended to hurt
the population of the village, but
were forced to do so after they met
enemy fire from the population
which killed the Irgun commander."
No comparison
Arab propagandists would like to
degrade the freedom fighters of the
Irgun to the same level as the ter
rorists of the PLO. But there is no
comparison to be made.
"We fought to save a people. They
shoot in order to destroy a people.
Look at the methods we used. We did
whatever was humanly possible to
avoid civilian casualties, sometimes
at the risk of the lives of our own
fighting men. We warned away any
and every civilian, whether Jew, Bri
ton, or Arab, from the zone of danger
in advance.
What do they - the so-called PLO
do? They make the civilian popula
tion the target of their bloody attacks
on men, women, and children. They
*iv '>112 express regret or sorrow when
they have "succeeded" to kill an in
nocent Jewish man or women or
child. On the contrary, they rejoice in
it. That, is the difference between
fighters and killers. That is the differ
ence between the Jewish under
ground and those killers of the so
called PLO." (Menachem Begin,
1976)

In the course of this war of exter
mination, the Arab armies attempted
to capture Jerusalem by placing it
under siege and starving its 150,000
Jewish civilian occupants. The major

access route for food and supplies Uv
Jerusalem, the Tp' Aviv lerusalem
road, was being continuously blor
kaded and shelled from the small
Arab villages overlooking the road
from the hills.
Deir Yassin was one of these vil
lages, the other was called Castel.
Both villages were heavily fortified
and militarily interconnected. The
Haganah, the Jewish Defense Force,
took the town of Castel in a battle in
which they lost many men. And the
second of these villages holding
Jerusalem under siege, Deir Yassin,
was to be assaulted by the Irgun, the
smaller Jewish paramilitary force.
Warning broadcasted
In early dawn of April 10, 1948, a
small truck with a loudspeaker, ac
companying the 100 poorly-armed
Jewish soldiers, drove near the vil
lage entrance, and broadcast a warn
ing in Arabic that an attack was immi
nent, and all civilian non
combatants should evacuate.
About 200 villagers did leave; none
were harmed, and all were after
wards released in the Arab part of
Jerusalem. The actual battle began
when the Palestine Arab and Iraqi

p?r ' or h.:"g out white flags near
the ent"nre.
The advance party of the Irgun was
met by a hail of fire as it approached;
the commarid°r was hit. Fierce
house-to-house fighting followed;
most of the stone buildings were de
fended hotly, and were captured
only after grenades were thrown in
side.
When the fighting ended, the 100
Irgun soldiers had four dead, 41
casualties. In the captured houses
they were horrified to find bodies of
women and children alongside the
combatant Palestinians and Iraqis.
Innocent victims
Whatever was their reason for not
leaving after the broadcast warnings,
they were innocent victims of a cruel
war; and the responsibility for their
deaths rests squarely upon the Arab
soldiers whose duty it was — under
any rule of war — to evacuate them
the moment they turned Deir Yassin
into a fortress, long before the battle
for the village began.
A statement by Yunes Ahmad As
sad, an inhabitant of Deir Yassin who
survived the battle, appeared in the
April 9, 1955 Jordanian Daily "Al Ur
dun":
"The Jews never intended to hurt
the population of the village, but
were forced to do so after they met
enemy fire from the population
which killed the Irgun commander."
No comparison
Arab propagandists would like to
degrade the freedom fighters of the
Irgun to the same level as the ter
rorists of the PLO. But there is no
comparison to be made.
"We fought to save a people. They
shoot in order to destroy a people.
Look at the methods we used. We did
whatever was humanly possible to
avoid civilian casualties, sometimes
at the risk of the lives of our own
fighting men. We warned away any
and every civilian, whether Jew, Bri
ton, or Arab, from the zone of danger
in advance.
What do they - the so-called PLO
do? They make the civilian popula
tion the target of their bloody attacks
on men, women, and children. They
*iv '>112 express regret or sorrow when
they have "succeeded" to kill an in
nocent Jewish man or women or
child. On the contrary, they rejoice in
it. That, is the difference between
fighters and killers. That is the differ
ence between the Jewish under
ground and those killers of the so
called PLO." (Menachem Begin,
1976)

The Arab propaganda machine in
the United States, financed to the
tune of 50 million dollars per year by
oil-rich Saudi Arabia, is attempting to
portray the Israelis as brutal murder
ers who prey on innocent Arab civi
lians.
But they are, in fact, projecting
their own deeds onto the very vic
tims of those deeds.
The list of massacres perpetrated
on the Jews of Palestine and Israel by
their Arab neighbors is nearly end
less. In the years 1929 and 1936-9,
hundreds of Jewish men, women,
and children were massacred in the
Hulda and Hebron riots incited by
Haj Amin el Husseini, the Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem who convinced
his friend Adolf Hitler to extermi
nate the Jews in Europe.
In more recent years, just to name
a few cases, the PLO-sponsored Red
Army terrorists massacred 27 tourists
at Lod Airport on May 30,1972. Seven
innocent Israeli athletes were brut
ally murdered by Palestinian ter
rorists at the 1972 Olympics, 24
schoolchildren were murdered in
1974 at Maalot, 18 Israelis massacred
in 1974 at Kiryat Shmoneh. And only
this year, PLO "heroes" hijacked a
bus containing civilian bus drivers
and their wives and children return
ing from a weekend holiday — and
massacred 34 of them.
Non-military targets
So far the "brave" terrorists of the
PLO have yet to find the courage to
attack a military target. Rather, they
choose to blow up school buses and
to place bombs in crowded mar
ketplaces, where innocent men,
women and children are indiscrimi
nately destroyed. In the last decade,
Arab terrorism has killed 1131 and
wounded 2471.
And yet, with their reprehensible
history of murder, the Arabs are play
ing the oldest game in the history of
politics; accusing the other side of
the crimes which in fact, they them
selves have committed.
Every propaganda article written
by the Arabs includes mention of the
so-called "massacre" at Deir Yassin
in 1948. (Strangely enough, even the
propagandists cannot find another
example of so-called acts of ter

rorism committed against the Arabs).
But let us take a closer look at what
actually happened on April 10, 1948
at Deir Yassin.
On Nov. 29, 1947, the United Na
tions voted that Palestine be par
titioned into an Arab and a Jewish
State. But on May 15,1948, when the
tiny State of Israel declared its inde
pendence, it was immediately in
vaded by the combined armies of
Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and
Syria, whose stated goal was to an
nihilate the Jews in Israel. (Egypt and
Jordan ended up occupying and il
legally annexing the Gaza Strip and
the West bank, which were to be the
major portions of the Palestinian
Arab State).
War of extermination
Even before this full scale invasion,
on Nov. 30,1947, the Palestine Arabs,
Arab League, and The Arab States
declared war on the UN resolution
and the Palestinian Jewish commun
ity.
