Animal victimization
In lieu of the recent public con
troversy over animal victimization
(i.e. cow-tipping), we, the under
signed, would like to expose the all
too prevalent occurences of pig
painting.
Slightly sadistic political activists
have, in the guise of publicizing their
beliefs, painted various slogans and
caricatures in mural form on the un
dersides of unsuspecting porkers.
This atrocity was brought to our

attention when one of our party, a
worker in a local record store,
noticed a recent surge in the sales of
the Pink Floyd album Animals, con
taining the song "Pigs."
After careful investigation, we dis
covered that this music was used to
lull innocent piglets into a trance-like
state during which their immaculate
pink skins were tarnished by brutal
political Picassos.
Pig proponents unite: stop this
abominable infringement upon the
rights of our porcine friends. Pigs
people too.
