# Minorities' grad school enrollment down again
## 
### Peter Brett 
Minority enrollment of graduate
students at the University has de
clined for the fourth straight year,
Dean of Graduate Studies W. Bliss
Carnochan reported yesterday to the
Faculty Senate.
The sharpest decline overall has
been in the School of Education, but
the enrollment of black students in
the School of Engineering is also
down sharply â€” from 33 students to
21. Five years ago the figure was 54.
The number of women receiving
advanced degrees, however, has in
creased in every graduate school, ac
cording to Carnochan.
The University's record in affirma
tive action at the faculty level has
been good, reported Carnochan. A
recent audit of staff and faculty prog
rams by the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare determined
that the University is in compliance
with affirmative action requirements
and spoke well of its actions.
He said, however, he foresees
fewer minority appointments to fa
culty positions in the years im
mediately ahead. This is partly be
cause a large number of minority fa
culty members were hired in 1972
and 1973, leaving fewer minority
candidates available for hiring now.
President Richard Lyman said, "I
can't help feeling distress over what
the figures for graduate enrollment
portend for the future."
According to Lyman, fewer minor
ity students now in graduate schools
means that fewer minority candi
dates will be available in the future
for faculty positions.
The senate also gave its support to
the recommendation of the sub
committee on the evaluation and
improvement of teaching that all
courses be student-evaluated begin
ning fall quarter. The information ob
tained from the evaluation forms will
be released to the instructor, to his
or her immediate supervisor and to
the ASSU Course Guide on a volun
tary basis.
A course may only be exempted
from evaluation if its enrollment is
under eight students.
The recommendation also sets up
a body, called the network for teach
ing improvement, which will consult
with individual faculty members on a
confidential basis for the improve
ment of their courses.
English Assoc. Prof. William Chace
said he felt "a lot of the reasons for
bad teaching arise from problems
that can't be tackled here, for exam
ple, disenchantment with the
young."
Calfee added, however, "I just
can't believe that teachers can't be
helped to improve. We think this is
an experiment worth trying."
William Todd, assistant professor
of Slavic languages and literature,
suggested that the best time to have a
course evaluated might be the be
ginning of the term after the course,
rather than during dead week. He
also said students should be encour
aged to participate in the evaluations
and be reminded of the seriousness
of the process.
