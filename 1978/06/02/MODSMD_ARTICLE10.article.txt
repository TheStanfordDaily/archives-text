A couple of years ago there was an article in the
Stanford Observer that rated the different kinds of
graduate schools across the country. I wish I had paid
more attention to it, because now I would like to
know the top 10 medical schools, engineering
schools, business schools and law schools. Could
you find these out for me?
-M.H.
The Carrter report, published in the February, 1977
issue of Change, rated the leading schools of educa
tion, law and business on the basis of "faculty qual
ity" and "educational attractiveness." According to
the composite score each received, the report listed
the top 10 private and public law and business
schools as follows:
Law Schools
Private Public
1. Harvard 1. U. of Michigan
2. Yalo 2. UC-Berkeley
3. Stanford 3. U. of Virginia
4. U. of Chicago 4. UCLA
5. Columbia 5. U. of Texas, Austin
6. U. of Penn. 6. U. of Minnesota
7. Cornell 7. U. of Illinois
8. Duke 8. U. of Wisconsin
9. Northwestern 9. U. of N. Carolina
10. New York U. 10. U. of Wash.

7. Northwestern 7. U. of Wisconsin
8. Cornell 8. U. of N. Carolina
9. Columbia 9. U. of Texas, Austin
10. New York U. 10. U. of Illinois

A Columbia University report published in the
March, 1977 issue of Social Forces rated the reputa
tion of 87 medical schools based on the "quality of
faculty" and the "effectiveness of training." Here are
the top 10:
Medical Schools
1. Harvard b. Duke
2. Johns Hopkins 7. Michigan
2. Stanford 8. Cornell
3. UC-San Francisco 9. Washington atSt. Louis
4. Yale 10. U. of Penn.
5. Columbia
In 1975, the state university at Buffalo published
these findings after conducting a survey on engineer
ing schools in the country:
Engineering Schools
Electrical Industrial
1. M.I.T. 1. Stanford
2. Stanford 2. Michigan
3. UC-Berkeley 3. Cornell
4. Illinois 4. UC-Berkeley
5. Michigan 5. Purdue

7. Cal-Tech. 7. Georgia Tech.
8. Carnegie-Melon 8. Ohio State

When will the construction of the new library facil
ity be completed?
-P.H.
According to Hugh Turner, assistant manager for
construction and engineering, the contract calls for
construction to be over by January, 1979. Because
workers are running behind schedule, however, he
said he expects a more realistic completion date to be
sometime in April or May.

What is going to happen to Serra Street between the
Business School and Biology? Will it be closed to auto
traffic? Will it be repaved? Will it be replaced with a
grassy wall?
-C.R.R.
Oscar Nelson, master planner for facilities and
properties, said the street — from its intersection
with Lasuen to its intersection with Via Palon —will
be rebuilt after construction is completed of Quad
buildings 200 , 460 and 120.
He said he anticipates ii will be at least two years
before anything is done.
Although details have yet to be worked out, he said
it is likely that the street will be narrowed and there
will be no parking on it. It is also possible the street
will be closed off to automobiles in front of the biol
ogy building, he added.
Their goal, he said, is to make a "safe street for
bikes and a convenient street for bus lines."

When will the construction of the new library facil
ity be completed?
-P.H.
According to Hugh Turner, assistant manager for
construction and engineering, the contract calls for
construction to be over by January, 1979. Because
workers are running behind schedule, however, he
said he expects a more realistic completion date to be
sometime in April or May.

What is going to happen to Serra Street between the
Business School and Biology? Will it be closed to auto
traffic? Will it be repaved? Will it be replaced with a
grassy wall?
-C.R.R.
Oscar Nelson, master planner for facilities and
properties, said the street — from its intersection
with Lasuen to its intersection with Via Palon —will
be rebuilt after construction is completed of Quad
buildings 200 , 460 and 120.
He said he anticipates ii will be at least two years
before anything is done.
Although details have yet to be worked out, he said
it is likely that the street will be narrowed and there
will be no parking on it. It is also possible the street
will be closed off to automobiles in front of the biol
ogy building, he added.
Their goal, he said, is to make a "safe street for
bikes and a convenient street for bus lines."

A couple of years ago there was an article in the
Stanford Observer that rated the different kinds of
graduate schools across the country. I wish I had paid
more attention to it, because now I would like to
know the top 10 medical schools, engineering
schools, business schools and law schools. Could
you find these out for me?
-M.H.
The Carrter report, published in the February, 1977
issue of Change, rated the leading schools of educa
tion, law and business on the basis of "faculty qual
ity" and "educational attractiveness." According to
the composite score each received, the report listed
the top 10 private and public law and business
schools as follows:
Law Schools
Private Public
1. Harvard 1. U. of Michigan
2. Yalo 2. UC-Berkeley
3. Stanford 3. U. of Virginia
4. U. of Chicago 4. UCLA
5. Columbia 5. U. of Texas, Austin
6. U. of Penn. 6. U. of Minnesota
7. Cornell 7. U. of Illinois
8. Duke 8. U. of Wisconsin
