# Two services aid in travel planning

Interested in studying
abroad? Working overseas?
Just plain traveling? Two or
ganizations here are available
to offer advice and help pre
pare for future excursions.
The Overseas Operations
Resource Center (OORC), lo
cated at Bechtel l-Center,
primarily gives advice for travel
study and work abroad, ac
cording to Marcia Makino,
overseas opportunities adviser
for study and fellowships.
The Center gives informa
tion on study programs abroad
sponsored by other univer
sities and private foundations
including the Sorbonne in
Paris and Waseda University in
japan.
Makino added that the
Center offers information on
Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright
and Churchill fellowship op
portunities.
Youth and student hotel lo
cations and information are
also available. The Center does
not plan itineraries, but does
give references and guides for
travel.
"We're not set up to actually
plan something for someone,"
said Makido.
The Center sponsors travel
workshops on camping, hik
ing, hostels and guidebooks as
well.
"Later in the quarter,"
Makido added, "there will be
workshops with specific focus
on trips in Africa and Latin
America."
General travel advice is also
available from the Center. Stu
dent rail passes, international

student identification cards
and charter listings are pro
vided by the center to facilitate
foreign travel.
A resource library with
books and pamphlets on over
seas job opportunities is also
located at the Center.
Makino said that it is possi
ble to obtain a job overseas and
coordinate working with
foreign travel. Makino said that
a full summer was appropriate
as a length of time to work.
"Six weeks in a job is not too
likely," she added.
Work permits are required
by foreign governments and
cannot be obtained through
the Center.
Makino also said that the
Center works closely with the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center in advising stu
dents on career opportunities
in connection with overseas
employment.
The ASSU Travel Service is
another organization here
which helps students with their
travel needs.
Travel Service Manager
Breck Walker said the Travel
Service provides several op
portunities for Stanford stu
dents.
"The Travel Service has a
booking agent for private char
ters which fly all over Europe
including National Laker char
ters based in Los Angeles and
New York," said Walker. Stu
dents can also have their own
trips planned through this
booking agent, he said.
However, the Travel Service
does not arrange for accom
modations once students have
reached their destinations,
Walker added.
