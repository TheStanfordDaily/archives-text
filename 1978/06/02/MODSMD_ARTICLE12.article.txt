# SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
## James Zurcher v. The Stanford Daily Opinion of the Court 
### 
Mr. Justice White delivered the
opinion of the Court.
The terms of the Fourth Amend
ment, applicable to the States by vir
tue of the Fourteenth Amendment,
are familiar:
"The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against un
reasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated, and no War
rants shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by Oath or affir
mation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized."
As heretofore understood, the
Amendment has not been a barrier
to warrants to search property on
which there is probable cause to be
lieve that fruits, instrumentalities, or
evidence of crime is located,
whether or not the owner or posses
sor of the premises to be searched is
himself reasonably suspected of
complicity in the crime being inves
tigated. We are now asked to recon
strue the Fourth Amendment and to
hold for the first time that when the
place to be searched is occupied by
a person not then a suspect, a war
rant to search for criminal objects
and evidence reasonably believed to
be located there should not issue
except in the most unusual cir
cumstances, and that except in such
circumstances, a subpoena duces
tecum must be relied upon to re
cover the objects or evidence
sought.
Late in the day on Friday, April 9,
1971, officers of the Palo Alto Police
Department and of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department re
sponded to a call from the director
of the Stanford University Hospital
requesting the removal of a large
group of demonstrators who had
seized the hospital's administrative
offices and occupied them since the
previous afternoon. After several
futile efforts to persuade the de
monstrators to leave peacefully,
more drastic measures were
employed. The demonstrators had
barricaded the doors at both ends of
a hall adjacent to the administrative
offices. The police chose to force
their way in at the west end of the
corridor. As they did so, a group of
demonstrators emerged through the
doors at the east end and, armed
with sticks and clubs, attacked the
group of nine police officers
stationed there. One officer was
knocked to the floor and struck re
peatedly on the head; another suf
fered a broken shoulder. All nine
were injured. There were no police
photographers at the east doors,
and most bystanders and reporters
were on the west side. The officers
themselves were able to identify
only two of their assailants, but one
of them did see at least one person
photographing the assault at the
east doors.
On Sunday, April 11, a special edi
tion of the Stanford Daily (Daily), a
student newspaper published at
Stanford University, carried articles
and photographs devoted to the
hospital protest and the violent
clash between demonstrators and
police. The photographs carried the
byline of a Daily staff member and
indicated that he had been at the
east end of the hospital hallway
where he could have photographed
the assault on the nine officers. The
next day, the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office secured a
warrant from the municipal court for
an immediate search of the Daily's

'Properly administered, the preconditions for a warrant. . .
should afford sufficient protection against the harms that are
assertedly threatened. . .

offices for negatives, film and pic
tures showing the events and oc
currences at the hospital on the
evening of April 9. The warrant is
sued on a finding of "just, probable
and reasonable cause for believing
that: Negatives and photographs
and films, evidence material and re
levant to the identification of the
perpetrators of felonies, to wit, Bat
tery on a Peace Officer, and Assault
with a Deadly Weapon, will be lo
cated (on the premises of the
Daily)." The warrant affidavit con
tained no allegation or indication
that members of the Daily staff were
in any way involved in unlawful acts
at the hospital.
The search pursuant to the war
rant was conducted later that day by
four police officers and took place in
the presence of some members of
the Daily staff. The Daily's photo
graphic laboratories, filing cabinets,
desks, and waste paper baskets
were searched. Locked drawers and
rooms were not opened. The offic
ers apparently had opportunity to
read notes and correspondence dur
ing the search; but contrary to
claims of the staff, the officers de
nied that they had exceeded the
limits of the warrant. They had not
been advised by the staff that the
areas they were searching contained
confidential materials. The search
revealed only the photographs that

had already been published on April
11, and no materials were removed
from the Daily's office.
A month later the Daily and vari
ous members of its staff, respon
dents here, brought a civil action in
the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California
seeking declaratory and injunctive
relief against the police officers who
conducted the search, the chief of
police, the district attorney and one
of his deputies, and the judge who
had issued the warrant. The com
plaint alleged that the search of the
Daily's office had deprived respon-

dents under color of state law of
rights secured to them by the First,
Fourth, and Fourteenth Amend
ments of the United States Constitu
tion.
The District Court denied the re
quest for an injunction but on re
spondents' motion for summary
judgment, granted declaratory re
lief. The court did not question the
existence of probable cause to be
lieve that a crime had been commit
ted and to believe that relevant evi
dence would be found on the Dai
ly's premises. It held, however, that
the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend
ments forbade the issuance of a war
rant to search for materials in pos
session of one not suspected of
crime unless there is probable cause
to believe, based on facts presented
in a sworn affidavit, that a subpoena
duces tecum would be impractica
ble. Moreover, the failure to honor a
subpoena would not alone justify a
warrant; it must also appear that the
possessor of the objects sought
would disregard a court order not to
remove or destroy them. The Dis
trict Court further held that where
the innocent object of the search is a
newspaper, First Amendment in
terests are also involved and that
such a search is constitutionally
permissible "only in the rare cir
cumstance where there is a clear
showing that (1) important materials
will be destroyed or removed from
the jurisdiction; and (2) a restraining
order would be futile." Since these
preconditions to a valid warrant had
not been satisfied here, the search
of the Daily's offices was declared to
have been illegal. The Court of Ap
peals affirmed per curiam, adopting
the opinion of the District Court.
We issued the writs of certiorari re
quested by petitioners. We reverse.
II
The issue here is how the Fourth
Amendment is to be construed and
applied to the "third party" search,
the recurring situation where state
authorities have probable cause to
believe that fruits, instrumentalities,
or other evidence of crime is located
on identified property but do not

then have probable cause to believe
that the owner or possessor of the
property is himself implicated in the
crime that has occurred or is occur
ring. Because under the District
Court's rule impracticability can be
shown only by furnishing facts de
monstrating that the third party will
not only disobey the subpoena but
will also ignore a restraining order
not to move or destroy the property,
it is apparent that only in unusual
situations could the State satisfy
such a severe burden and that for all
practical purposes the effect of the
rule is that fruits, instrumentalities,
and evidence of crime may be reco
vered from third parties only by
subpoena, not by search warrant. At
least, we assume that the District
Court did not intend its rule to be
toothless and anticipated that only
subpoenas would be available in
many cases where without the rule a
search warrant would issue.
It is an understatement to say that
there is no direct authority in this or
any other federal court for the Dis
trict Court's sweeping revision of
the Fourth Amendment. Under
existing law, valid warrants may be

issued to search any property,
whether or not occupied by a third
party, at which there is probable
cause to believe that fruits, in
strumentalities, or evidence of a
crime will be found. Nothing on the
face of the Amendment suggests
that a third-party search warrant
should not normally issue. The war
rant clause speaks of search war
rants issued on "probable cause"
and "particularly describing the
place to be searched and the per
sons or things to be seized." In situ
ations where the State does not seek
to seize "persons" but only those
"things" which there is probable
cause to believe are located on the
place to be searched, there is no
apparent basis in the language of the
Amendment for also imposing the
requirements for a valid arrest —
probable cause to believe that the
third party is implicated in the
crime.
As the Fourth Amendment has
been construed and applied by this
Court, "when the State's reason to
believe incriminating evidence will
be found becomes sufficiently great,
the invasion of privacy becomes jus
tified and a warrant to search and
seize will issue," Fisher v. United
States (1976). In Camara v. Munici
pal Court (1967) we indicated that in
applying the "probable cause" stan
dard "by which a particular decision
to search is tested against the con
stitutional standard of reasonable
ness," it is necessary "to focus upon
the governmental interest which al
legedly justifies the official intru
sion" and that in criminal investiga
tions, a warrant to search for recov
erable items is reasonable "only
when there is 'probable cause' to
believe they will be uncovered in a
particular dwelling." Search war
rants are not directed at persons;
they authorize the search of
"places" and the seizure of
"things," and as a constitutional
matter they need not even name the
person from whom the things will
be seized, United States v. Kahn
(1974).
Because the State's interest in en
forcing the criminal law and recover

'Nor are we convinced . . . that confidential sources will
disappear and that the press will suppress news because of
fears of warranted searches.'

ing evidence is the same whether
the third party is culpable or not, the
premise of the District Court's hold
ing appears to be that State entitle
ment to a search warrant depends
on the culpability of the owner or
possessor of the place to be
searched and on the State's right to
arrest him. The cases are to the con
trary. Prior to Camara v. Municipal
Court, and See v. City of Seattle
(1967), the central purpose of the
Fourth Amendment was seen to be
the protection of the individual
against official searches for evidence
to convict him of a crime. Entries
upon property for civil purposes,
where the occupant was suspected
of no criminal conduct whatsoever,
involved a more peripheral concern
and the less intense "right to be
secure from intrusion into personal
privacy," Frank v. Maryland (1939);
Camara v. Municipal Court. Such
searches could proceed without
warrant, as long as the State's in
terest was sufficiently substantial.
Under this view, the Fourth
Amendment was more protective
where the place to be searched was
occupied by one suspected of crime
and the search was for evidence to
use against him. Camara and See,
disagreeing with Frank to this ex
tent, held that a warrant is required
where entry is sought for civil pur
poses, as well as when criminal law
enforcement is involved. Neither
case, however, suggested that to
secure a search warrant the owner
or occupant of the place to be in
spected or searched must be sus
pected of criminal involvement. In
deed, both cases held that a less
stringent standard of probable cause
is acceptable where the entry is not
to secure evidence of crime against
the possessor.
We have suggested nothing to the
contrary since Camara and See. In
deed, Colonnade Catering Corp. v.
United States (1970) and United
States v. Biswell (1972), dispensed
with the warrant requirement in
cases involving limited types of in
spections and searches.
The critical element in a reasona
ble search is not that the owner of
the property is suspected of crime
but that there is reasonable cause to
believe that the specific "things" to
be searched for and seized are lo
cated on the property to which entry
is sought. In Carroll v. U.S. (1925), it
was claimed that the seizure of
liquor was unconstitutional because

the occupant of a car stopped with
probable cause to believe that it was
carrying illegal liquor was not sub
ject to arrest. The Court, however,
said:
"If their theory were sound, their
conclusion would be. The validity of
the seizure then would turn wholly
on the validity of the arrest without a
seizure. But the theory is unsound.
The right to search and the validity
of the seizure are not dependent on
the right to arrest. They are depen
dent on the reasonable cause the
seizing officer has for belief that the
contents of the automobile offend
against the law."
The Court's ultimate conclusion
was that "the officers here had jus
tification for the search and sei
zure," that is, a reasonable "belief
that intoxicating liquor was being
transported in the automobile which
they stopped and searched." See
also Husty v. United States (1931).
Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure', which reflects
"(t)he Fourth Amendment's policy
against unreasonable search and
seizures," United States v. Ventresca
(1965), authorizes warrants to search
for contraband, fruits or instrumen
talities of crime or "any . . .property
that constitutes evidence of the
commission of a criminal of
fense. . . ." Upon proper showing,
the warrant is to issue "identifying

the good faith of the third party.'

the property and naming or describ
ing the person or place to be
searched. Probable cause for the
warrant must be presented, but
there is nothing in the Rule indicat
ing that the officers must be entitled
to arrest the owner of the "place" to
be searched before a search warrant
may issue and the "property" may
be searched for and seized. The
Rule deals with warrants to search,
and is unrelated to arrests. Nor is
there anything in the Fourth
Amendment indicating that absent
probable cause to arrest a third
party, resort must be had to a sub
poena.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit expressed the correct view of

Rule 41 and of the Fourth Amend
ment when, disagreeing with the
decisions of the Court of Appeals
and the District Court in the present
case, it ruled that "(o)nce it is estab
lished that probable cause exists to
believe a federal crime has been
committed a warrant may issue for
the search of any property which the
magistrate has probable cause to be
lieve may be the place of conceal
ment of evidence of the crime," Un
ited States v. Manufacturers Nat.
Bank of Detroit (1976) cert, denied
sub nom. Wingate v. United States
(1977). Accord, Sfafe v. TunnelCitgo
Services (1977).
The net of the matter is that
"(s)earches and seizures, in a tech
nical sense, are independent of,
rather than ancillary to arrest and ar
raignment." American Law Institute,
A Model Code of Pre-Arraignment
Procedure, Commentary 491 (1975).
The Model Code provides that the
warrant application "shall describe
with particularity the individuals or
places to be searched and the indi
viduals or things to be seized, and
shall be supported by one or more
affidavits particularly setting forth
the facts and circumstances.'ending
to show that such individuals or
things are or will be in the places, or
the things are or will be in posses
sion of the individuals, to be
searched." There is no suggestion
that the occupant of the place to be
searched must himself be implicated
in misconduct.
Against this background, it is un
tenable to conclude that property
may not be searched unless its oc
cupant is reasonably suspected of
crime and is subject to arrest. And if
those considered free of criminal in
volvement may nevertheless be
searched or inspected under civil
statutes, it is difficult to understand
why the Fourth Amendment would
prevent entry onto their property to
recover evidence of a crime not
committed by them but by others.
As we understand the structure and
language of the Fourth Amendment
and our cases expounding if, vaiid
warrants to search property may be
issued when it is satisfactorily de
monstrated to the magistrate that
fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence
of crime is located on the premises.
The Fourth Amendment has itself
struck the balance between privacy
and public need, and there is no oc
casion or justification for a court to
revise the Amendment and strike a
new balance by denying the search
warrant in the circumstances pre
sent here and by insisting that the
investigation proceed by subpoena
duces tecum, whether on the theory
that the latter is a less intrusive al
ternative, or otherwise.

This is not to question that
"reasonableness" is the overriding
test of compliance with the Fourth
Amendment or to assert that
searches, however or whenever
executed, may never be unreasona
ble if supported by a warrant issued
on probable cause and properly
identifying the place to be searched
and the property to be seized. We
do hold, however, that the courts
may not, in the name of Fourth
Amendment reasonableness, forbid
the States from issuing warrants to
search for evidence simply because
the owner or possessor of the place
to be searched is not then reasona
bly suspected of criminal involve
ment.
11l
In any event, the reasons pre
sented by the District Court and
adopted by the Court of Appeals for
arriving at its remarkable conclusion
do not withstand analysis. First, as
we have said, it is apparent that
whether the third-party occupant is
suspect or not, the State's interest in
enforcing the criminal law and re
covering the evidence remains the
same; and it is the seeming inno
cence of the property owner that the
District Court relied on to foreclose
the warrant to search. But as re
spondents themselves now con
cede, if the third party knows that
contraband or other illegal materials

are on his property, he is sufficiently
culpable to justify the issuance of a
search warrant. Similarly, if his ethi
cal stance is the determining factor,
it seems to us that whether or not he
knows that the sought-after articles
are secreted on his property and
whether or not he knows that the
articles are in fact the fruits, in
strumentalities, or evidence of
crime, he will be so informed when
the search warrant is served, and it is
doubtful that he should then be
permitted to object to the search, to
withhold, if it is there, the evidence
of crime reasonably believed to be
possessed by him or secreted on his
property, and to forbid the search
and insist that the officers serve him
with a subpoena duces tecum.
Second, we are unpersuaded that
the District Court's new rule deny
ing search warrants against third
parties and insisting on subpoenas
would substantially farther privacy
interests without seriously under
mining law enforcement efforts. Be
cause of the fundamental public in
terest in implementing the criminal
law, the search warrant, a hereto
fore effective and constitutionally
acceptable enforcement tool,
should not be suppressed on the
basis of surmise and without solid
evidence supporting the change. As
the District Court understands it,
denying third-party search warrants
would not have substantial adverse
effects on criminal investigations
because the nonsuspect third party,
once served with a subpoena, will
preserve the evidence and ulti
mately lawfully respond. The diffi
culty with this assumption is that
search warrants are often employed
early in an investigation, perhaps
before the identity of any likely crim
inal and certainly before all the per
petrators are or could be known.
The seemingly blameless third party
in possession of the fruits or evi
dence may not be innocent at all;
and if he is, he may nevertheless be
so related to or so sympathetic with
the culpable that he cannot be relied
upon to retain and preserve the arti
cles that may implicate his friends,
or at least not to notify those who
would be damaged by the evidence
that the authorities are aware of its
location. In any event, it is likely that
the rtal culprits will have access to
the property, and the delay involved
in employing the subpoena duces
tecum, offering as it does the oppor
tunity to litigate its validity, could
easily result in the disappearance of
the evidence, whatever the good
faith of the third party.
Forbidding the warrant and insist
ing on the subpoena instead when

'(W)e are unpersuaded that . . . denying search warrants
against third parties and insisting on subpoenas would sub
stantially further privacy interests without seriously under
mining law enforcement efforts.'

the custodian of the object of the
search is not then suspected of
crime, involves hazards to criminal
investigation much more serious
than the District Court believed;
and the record is barren of anything
but the District Court's assumptions
to support its conclusions. At the
very least, the burden of justifying a
major revision of the Fourth
Amendment has not been carried.
We are also not convinced that
the net gain to privacy interests by
the District Court's new rule would
be worth the candle. In the normal
course of events, search warrants
are more difficult to obtain than
subpoenas, since the latter do not
involve the judiciary and do not re
quire proof of probable cause.
Where, in the real world, subpoenas

would suffice, it can be expected
that they will be employed by the
rational prosecutor. On the other
hand, when choice is available
under local law and the prosecutor
chooses to use the search warrant, it
is unlikely that he has needlessly
selected the more difficult course.
His choice is more likely to be based
on the solid belief, arrived at
through experience but difficult, if
not impossible, to sustain in a
specific case, that the warranted
search is necessary to secure and to
avoid the destruction of evidence.
IV
The District Court held, and re
spondents assert here, that what
ever may be true of third-party
searches generally, where the third
party is a newspaper, there are addi
tional factors derived from the First
Amendment that justify a nearly per
se rule forbidding the search war
rant and permitting only the sub
poena duces tecum. The general
submission is that searches of
newspaper offices for evidence of
crime reasonably believed to be on
the premises will seriously threaten
the ability of the press to gather,
analyze, and disseminate news. This
is said to be true for several reasons:
first, searches will be physically dis
ruptive to such an extent that timely
publication will be impeded. Sec
ond, confidential sources of infor
mation will dry up, and the press will
also lose opportunities to cover var
ious events because of fears of the
participants that press files will be
readily available to the authorities.
Third, reporters will be deterred
from recording and preserving their
recollections for future use if such
information is subject to seizure.
Fourth, the processing of news and
its dissemination will be chilled by
the prospects that searches will dis
close internal editorial delibera
tions. Fifth, the press will resort to
self-censorship to conceal its pos
session of information of potential
interest to the police.
It is true that the struggle from
which the Fourth Amendment
emerged "is largely a history of con
flict between the Crown and the
press," Stanford v. Texas (1965), and
that in issuing warrants and deter
mining the reasonableness of a
search, state and federal magistrates
should be aware that "unrestricted
power of search and seizure could
also be an instrument for stifling lib
erty of expression," Marcus v.
Search Warrant (1961). Where the
materials sought to be seized may
be protected by the First Amend
ment, the requirements of the
Fourth Amendment must be applied
with "scrupulous exactitude," Stan
ford v. Texas. "A seizure reasonable
as to one type of material in one
setting may be unreasonable in a dif
ferent setting or with respect to
another kind of material," Roaden v.
Kentucky (1973). Hence, in Stanford
v. Texas, the Court invalidated a
warrant authorizing the search of a
private home for all books, records,
and other materials relating to the
Communist Party, on the ground
that whether or not the warrant
would have been sufficient in other
contexts, it authorized the searchers
to rummage among and make
judgments about books and papers
and was the functional equivalent of
a general warrant, one of the princi
pal targets of the Fourth Amend
ment. Where presumptively pro
tected materials are sought to be
seized, the warrant requirement
should be administered to leave as
little as possible to the discretion or
whim of the officer in the field.
Similarly, where seizure is sought
of allegedly obscene materials, the
judgment of the arresting officer
alone is insufficient to justify is
suance of a search warrant or a sei
zure without a warrant incident to
arrest. The procedure for determin
ing probable cause must afford an
opportunity for the judicial officer to
"focus searchingly on the question
of obscenity," Marcus v. Search War
rant; A Quantity of Books v. Kansas
(1964); Lee Art Theatre, Inc. v. Vir
ginia (1968); Roaden v. Kentucky;
Heller v. New York (1973).
Neither the Fourth Amendment
nor the cases requiring considera
tion of First Amendment values in

issuing search warrants, however,
call for imposing the regime ordered
by the District Court. Aware of the
long struggle between Crown and
press and desiring to curb unjus
tified official intrusions, the Framers
took the enormously important step
of subjecting searches to the test of
reasonableness and to the general
rule requiring search warrants is
sued by neutral magistrates. They
nevertheless did not forbid warrants
where the press was involved, did
not require special showings that
subpoenas would be impractical,
and did not insist that the owner of
the place to be searched, if con
nected with the press, must be
shown to be implicated in the of
fense being investigated. Further,


Justice White
the prior cases do no more than in
sist that the courts apply the warrant
requirements with particular exac
titude when First Amendment in
terests would be endangered by the
search. As we see it, no more than
this is required where the warrant
requested is for the seizure of crim
inal evidence reasonably believed to
be on the premises occupied by a
newspaper. Properly administered,
the preconditions for a warrant —
probable cause, specificity with re
spect to the place to be searched
and the things to be seized, and
overall reasonableness — should af
ford sufficient protection against the
harms that are assertedly threatened
by warrants for searching news
paper offices.
There is no reason to believe, for
example, that magistrates cannot
guard against searches of the type,
scope, and intrusiveness that would
actually interfere with the timely
publication of a newspaper. Nor, if
the requirements of specificity and
reasonableness are properly
applied, policed, and observed, will
there be any occasion or opportun
ity for officers to rummage at large
in newspaper files or to intrude into
or to deter normal editorial and pub
lication decisions. The warrant is
sued in this case authorized nothing
of this sort. Nor are we convinced,
anymore than we were in Branzburg
v. Hayes (1972) that confidential
sources will disappear and that the
press will suppress news because of
fears of warranted searches. What
ever incremental effect there may be
in this regard if search warrants, as
well as subpoenas, are permissible
in proper circumstances, it does not
make a constitutional difference in
our judgment.
The fact is that respondents and
amici have pointed to only a very

few instances in the entire United
States since 1971 involving the is
suance of warrants for searching
newspaper premises. This reality
hardly suggests abuse; and if abuse
occurs, there will be time enough to
deal with it. Furthermore, the press
is not only an important, critical, and
valuable asset to society, but it is not
easily intimidated — nor should it
be.
Respondents also insist that the
press should be afforded opportun
ity to litigate the State's entitlement
to the material it seeks before it is
turned over or seized and that
whereas the search warrant proce
dure is defective in this respect, re
sort to the subpoena would solve
the problem. The Court has held
that a restraining order imposing a
prior restraint upon free expression
is invalid for want of notice and op
portunity for a hearing, Carroll v.
Princess Anne (1968), and that sei
zures not merely for use as evidence
but entirely removing arguably pro
tected materials from circulation
may be effected only after an adver
sary hearing and a judicial finding of
obscenity, A Quantity of Books v.
Kansas (1964). But presumptively
protected materials are not neces
sarily immune from seizure under
warrant for use at a criminal trial.
Not every such seizure, and not
even most, will impose a prior re
straint, Heller v. t New York. And
surely,a warrant to search news
paper premises for criminal evi
dence such as the one issued here
for news photographs taken in a
public place carries no realistic
threat of prior restraint or of any di
rect restraint whatsoever on the
publication of the Daily or on its
communication of ideas. The
hazards of such warrants can be av
oided by a neutral magistrate carry
ing out his responsibilities under the

Fourth Amendment, for he has
ample tools at his disposal to con
fine warrants to search within
reasonable limits.
We note finally that if the evi
dence sought by warrant is suffi
ciently connected with the crime to
satisfy the probable cause require
ment, it will very likely be suffi
ciently relevant to justify a subpoena
and to withstand a motion to quash.
Further, Fifth Amendment ana state
shield law objections that might be
asserted in opposition to com
pliance with a subpoena are largely
irrelevant to determining the legality
of a search warrant under the Fourth
Amendment. Of course, the Fourth
Amendment does not prevent or
advise against legislative or execu
tive efforts to establish nonconstitu
tional protections against possible
abuses of the search warrant proce
dure, but we decline to reinterpret
the Amendment to impose a general
constitutional barrier against war
rants to search newspaper premises,
to require resort to subpoenas as a
general rule, or to demand prior
notice and hearing in connection
with the issuance of search war
rants.
V
We accordingly reject the reasons
given by the District Court and
adopted by the Court of Appeals for
holding the search for photographs
at the Stanford Daily to have been
unreasonable within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment and in viola
tion of the First Amendment. Nor
has anything else presented here
persuaded us that the Amendments
forbade this search. It follows that
the judgment of the Court of Appe
als is reversed.
So ordered.
Mr. Justice Brennan took no part
in the consideration or decision of
this case.
