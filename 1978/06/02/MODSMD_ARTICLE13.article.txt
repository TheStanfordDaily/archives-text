# SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
## James Zurcher v. The Stanford Daily Justice Stewart's and Justice Marshall's dissent 
### 
Mr. Justice Stewart, with whom
Mr. Justice Marshall joins, dissent
ing.
Believing that the search by the
police of the offices of The Stanford
Daily infringed the First and Four
teenth Amendments' guarantee of a
free press, I respectfully dissent.
I
It seems to me self-evident that
police searches of newspaper of
fices burden the freedom of the
press. The most immediate and ob
vious First Amendment injury
caused by such a visitation by the
police is physical disruption of the
operation of the newspaper.

Policemen occupying a newsroom
and searching it thoroughly for what
may be an extended period of time
will inevitably interrupt its normal
operations, and thus impair or even
temporarily prevent the processes
of newsgathering, writing, editing,
and publishing. By contrast, a sub
poena would afford the newspaper
itself an opportunity to locate what
ever material might be requested
and produce it.
But there is another and more
serious burden on a free press im
posed by an unannounced police
search of a newspaper office: the
possibility of .'isclosure of informa
tion received from confidential
sources, or of the identity of the
sources themselves. Protection of
those sources is necessary to ensure
that the press can fulfill its constitu
tionally designated function of in
forming the public, because impor
tant information can often be ob
tained only by an assurance that the
source will not be revealed.
Branzburg v. Hayes, (dissenting
opinion). And the Court has recog
nized that " 'without some protec
tion for seeking out the news, free
dom of the press could be eviscer
ated,' " Pell v. Procunier.
Today the Court does not ques
tion the existence of this constitu
tional protection, but says only that
it is not "convinced . . . that confi
dential sources will disappear and
that the press will suppress news
because of fears of warranted
searches." This facile conclusion
seems to me to ignore common ex
perience. It requires no blind leap of

faith to understand that a person
who gives information to a journalist
only on condition that his identity
will not be revealed will be less
likely to give that information if he
knows that, despite the journalist's
assurance, his identity may in fact be
disclosed. And it cannot be denied
that confidential information may be
exposed to the eyes of police offic
ers who execute a search warrant by
rummaging through the files,
cabinets, desks and wastebaskets of
a newsroom. Since the indisputable
effect of such searches will thus be
to prevent a newsman from being
able to promise confidentiality to his
potential sources, it seems obvious
to me that a journalist's access to
information, and thus the public's,
will thereby be impaired.
A search warrant allows police of
ficers to ransack the files of a news
paper, reading each and every
document until they have found the
one named in the warrant, while a
subpoena would permit the news
paper itself to produce only the
specific documents requested. A
search, unlike a subpoena, will
therefore lead to the needless expo
sure of confidential information
completely unrelated to the purpose
of the investigation. The knowledge
that police officers can make an un
announced raid on a newsroom is
thus bound to have a deterrent ef
fect on the availability of confiden
tial news sources. The end result,
wholly inimical to the First Amend
ment, will be a diminishing flow of
potentially important information to
the public.
One need not rely on mere intui
tion to reach this conclusion. The
record in this case includes affidavits
not only from members of the staff
of The Stanford Daily but from many
professional journalists and editors,
attesting to precisely such personal
experience. Despite the Court's re
jection of this uncontroverted evi
dence, I believe it clearly establishes
that unannounced police searches
of newspaper offices will signific
antly burden the constitutionally
protected function of the press to
gather news and report it to the pub
lic.
II
In Branzburg v. Hayes, the more
limited disclosure of a journalist's
sources caused by compelling him
to testify was held to be justified by

'Protection of. . . sources is necessary to ensure that the
press can fulfill its constitutionally designated function of
informing the public.'

the necessity of "pursuing and pro
secuting those crimes reported to
the press by informants and in thus
deterring the commission of such
crimes in the future," 408 U.S. at
695. The Court found that these im
portant societal interests would be
frustrated if a reporter were able to
claim an absolute privilege for his
confidential sources. In the present
case, however, the respondents do
not claim that any of the evidence

sought was privileged from disclo
sure; they claim only that a sjb
poena would have served equally
well to produce that evidence. Thus,
we are not concerned with the prin
ciple, central to Branzburg, that
" 'the public . . . has a right to every
man's evidence,' " but only with
whether any significant societal in
terest would be impaired if the
police were generally required to
obtain evidence from the press by
means of a subpoena rather than a
search.
It is well to recall the actual cir
cumstances of this case. The appli
cation for a warrant showed only
that there was reason to believe that
photographic evidence of assaults
on the police would be found in the
offices of The Stanford Daily. There
was no emergency need to protect
life or property by an immediate
search. The evidence sought was
not contraband, but material ob
tained by the Daily in the normal
exercise of its journalistic function.
Neither the Daily nor any member of
its staff was suspected of criminal
activity. And there was no showing
the Daily would not respond to a
subpoena commanding production
of the photographs, or that for any
other reason a subpoena could not
be obtained. Surely, then, a sub
poena duces tecum would have
been just as effective as a police raid
in obtaining the production of the
material sought by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney.
The District Court and the Court
of Appeals clearly recognized that if
the affidavits submitted with a
search warrant application should
demonstrate probable cause to be
lieve that a subpoena would be im
practical, the magistrate must have
the authority to issue a warrant. In
such a case, by definition, a sub
poena would not be adequate to
protect the relevant societal in
terest. But they held, and I agree,
that a warrant should issue only after
the magistrate has performed the
careful "balanc(ing) of these vital
constitutional and societal in
terests," Branzburg v. Hayes (con
curring opinion of Mr. Justice Pow
ell).
The decisions of this Court estab
lish that a prior adversary judicial
hearing is generally required to as
sess in advance any threatened inva
sion of First Amendment liberty. A

search by police officers affords no
timely opportunity for such a hear
ing, since a search warrant is ordi
narily issued ex parte upon the af
fidavit of a policeman or prosecutor.
There is no opportunity to challenge
the necessity for the search until
after it has occurred and the con
stitutional protection of the news
paper has been irretrievably in
vaded.
On the other hand, a subpoena

would allow a newspaper, through a
motion to quash, an opportunity for
an adversary hearing with respect to
the production of any material
which a prosecutor might think is in
its possession. This very principle
was emphasized in the Branzburg
case:
"(l)f the newsman is called upon
to give information bearing only a
remote and tenuous relationship to
the subject of the investigation, or if
he has some other reason to believe
that his testimony implicates confi
dential source relationships without
a legitimate need of law enforce

ment, he will have access to 'he
court on a motion to quash and an
appropriate protective order may be
entered," (concurring opinion of
Mr. Justice Powell).
If, in the present case, The Stan
ford Daily had been served with a
subpoena, it would have had an op
portunity to demonstrate to the
court what the police ultimately
found to be true â€” that the evi
dence sought did not exist. The
legitimate needs of government
thus would have been served with
out infringing the freedom of the
press.

111
Perhaps a* a matter of abstiact
policy a nev i olfice should re
ceive no rnoie protection from un
announced police searches than,
say, the office of a doctor or the
office of a bank. But we are here to
uphold a Constitution. And our
Constitution does not explicitly pro
tect the practice of medicine or the
business of banking from all ab
ridgment by government. It does
explicitly protect the freedom of the
press.
For these reasons I would affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appe
als.

It is well to recall the actual cir
cumstances of this case. The appli
cation for a warrant showed only
that there was reason to believe that
photographic evidence of assaults
on the police would be found in the
offices of The Stanford Daily. There
was no emergency need to protect
life or property by an immediate
search. The evidence sought was
not contraband, but material ob
tained by the Daily in the normal
exercise of its journalistic function.
Neither the Daily nor any member of
its staff was suspected of criminal
activity. And there was no showing
the Daily would not respond to a
subpoena commanding production
of the photographs, or that for any
other reason a subpoena could not
be obtained. Surely, then, a sub
poena duces tecum would have
been just as effective as a police raid
in obtaining the production of the
material sought by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney.
The District Court and the Court
of Appeals clearly recognized that if
the affidavits submitted with a
search warrant application should
demonstrate probable cause to be
lieve that a subpoena would be im
practical, the magistrate must have
the authority to issue a warrant. In
such a case, by definition, a sub
poena would not be adequate to
protect the relevant societal in
terest. But they held, and I agree,
that a warrant should issue only after
the magistrate has performed the
careful "balanc(ing) of these vital
constitutional and societal in
terests," Branzburg v. Hayes (con
curring opinion of Mr. Justice Pow
ell).
The decisions of this Court estab
lish that a prior adversary judicial
hearing is generally required to as
sess in advance any threatened inva
sion of First Amendment liberty. A

search by police officers affords no
timely opportunity for such a hear
ing, since a search warrant is ordi
narily issued ex parte upon the af
fidavit of a policeman or prosecutor.
There is no opportunity to challenge
the necessity for the search until
after it has occurred and the con
stitutional protection of the news
paper has been irretrievably in
vaded.
On the other hand, a subpoena

would allow a newspaper, through a
motion to quash, an opportunity for
an adversary hearing with respect to
the production of any material
which a prosecutor might think is in
its possession. This very principle
was emphasized in the Branzburg
case:
"(l)f the newsman is called upon
to give information bearing only a
remote and tenuous relationship to
the subject of the investigation, or if
he has some other reason to believe
that his testimony implicates confi
dential source relationships without
a legitimate need of law enforce

ment, he will have access to 'he
court on a motion to quash and an
appropriate protective order may be
entered," (concurring opinion of
Mr. Justice Powell).
If, in the present case, The Stan
ford Daily had been served with a
subpoena, it would have had an op
portunity to demonstrate to the
court what the police ultimately
found to be true â€” that the evi
dence sought did not exist. The
legitimate needs of government
thus would have been served with
out infringing the freedom of the
press.

It seems to me self-evident that
police searches of newspaper of
fices burden the freedom of the
press. The most immediate and ob
vious First Amendment injury
caused by such a visitation by the
police is physical disruption of the
operation of the newspaper.

Policemen occupying a newsroom
and searching it thoroughly for what
may be an extended period of time
will inevitably interrupt its normal
operations, and thus impair or even
temporarily prevent the processes
of newsgathering, writing, editing,
and publishing. By contrast, a sub
poena would afford the newspaper
itself an opportunity to locate what
ever material might be requested
and produce it.
But there is another and more
serious burden on a free press im
posed by an unannounced police
search of a newspaper office: the
possibility of .'isclosure of informa
tion received from confidential
sources, or of the identity of the
sources themselves. Protection of
those sources is necessary to ensure
that the press can fulfill its constitu
tionally designated function of in
forming the public, because impor
tant information can often be ob
tained only by an assurance that the
source will not be revealed.
Branzburg v. Hayes, (dissenting
opinion). And the Court has recog
nized that " 'without some protec
tion for seeking out the news, free
dom of the press could be eviscer
ated,' " Pell v. Procunier.
Today the Court does not ques
tion the existence of this constitu
tional protection, but says only that
it is not "convinced . . . that confi
dential sources will disappear and
that the press will suppress news
because of fears of warranted
searches." This facile conclusion
seems to me to ignore common ex
perience. It requires no blind leap of

faith to understand that a person
who gives information to a journalist
only on condition that his identity
will not be revealed will be less
likely to give that information if he
knows that, despite the journalist's
assurance, his identity may in fact be
disclosed. And it cannot be denied
that confidential information may be
exposed to the eyes of police offic
ers who execute a search warrant by
rummaging through the files,
cabinets, desks and wastebaskets of
a newsroom. Since the indisputable
effect of such searches will thus be
to prevent a newsman from being
able to promise confidentiality to his
potential sources, it seems obvious
to me that a journalist's access to
information, and thus the public's,
will thereby be impaired.
A search warrant allows police of
ficers to ransack the files of a news
paper, reading each and every
document until they have found the
one named in the warrant, while a
subpoena would permit the news
paper itself to produce only the
specific documents requested. A
search, unlike a subpoena, will
therefore lead to the needless expo
sure of confidential information
completely unrelated to the purpose
of the investigation. The knowledge
that police officers can make an un
announced raid on a newsroom is
thus bound to have a deterrent ef
fect on the availability of confiden
tial news sources. The end result,
wholly inimical to the First Amend
ment, will be a diminishing flow of
potentially important information to
the public.
One need not rely on mere intui
tion to reach this conclusion. The
record in this case includes affidavits
not only from members of the staff
of The Stanford Daily but from many
professional journalists and editors,
attesting to precisely such personal
experience. Despite the Court's re
jection of this uncontroverted evi
dence, I believe it clearly establishes
that unannounced police searches
of newspaper offices will signific
antly burden the constitutionally
protected function of the press to
gather news and report it to the pub
lic.
II
In Branzburg v. Hayes, the more
limited disclosure of a journalist's
sources caused by compelling him
to testify was held to be justified by

'Protection of. . . sources is necessary to ensure that the
press can fulfill its constitutionally designated function of
informing the public.'

the necessity of "pursuing and pro
secuting those crimes reported to
the press by informants and in thus
deterring the commission of such
crimes in the future," 408 U.S. at
695. The Court found that these im
portant societal interests would be
frustrated if a reporter were able to
claim an absolute privilege for his
confidential sources. In the present
case, however, the respondents do
not claim that any of the evidence

sought was privileged from disclo
sure; they claim only that a sjb
poena would have served equally
well to produce that evidence. Thus,
we are not concerned with the prin
ciple, central to Branzburg, that
" 'the public . . . has a right to every
man's evidence,' " but only with
whether any significant societal in
terest would be impaired if the
police were generally required to
obtain evidence from the press by
means of a subpoena rather than a

dom of the press could be eviscer
ated,' " Pell v. Procunier.
Today the Court does not ques
tion the existence of this constitu
tional protection, but says only that
it is not "convinced . . . that confi
dential sources will disappear and
that the press will suppress news
because of fears of warranted
searches." This facile conclusion
seems to me to ignore common ex
perience. It requires no blind leap of

faith to understand that a person
who gives information to a journalist
only on condition that his identity
will not be revealed will be less
likely to give that information if he
knows that, despite the journalist's
assurance, his identity may in fact be
disclosed. And it cannot be denied
that confidential information may be
exposed to the eyes of police offic
ers who execute a search warrant by
rummaging through the files,
cabinets, desks and wastebaskets of
a newsroom. Since the indisputable
effect of such searches will thus be
to prevent a newsman from being
able to promise confidentiality to his
potential sources, it seems obvious
to me that a journalist's access to
information, and thus the public's,
will thereby be impaired.
A search warrant allows police of
ficers to ransack the files of a news
paper, reading each and every
document until they have found the
one named in the warrant, while a
subpoena would permit the news
paper itself to produce only the
specific documents requested. A
search, unlike a subpoena, will
therefore lead to the needless expo
sure of confidential information
completely unrelated to the purpose
of the investigation. The knowledge
that police officers can make an un
announced raid on a newsroom is
thus bound to have a deterrent ef
fect on the availability of confiden
tial news sources. The end result,
wholly inimical to the First Amend
ment, will be a diminishing flow of
potentially important information to
the public.
One need not rely on mere intui
tion to reach this conclusion. The
record in this case includes affidavits
not only from members of the staff
of The Stanford Daily but from many
professional journalists and editors,
attesting to precisely such personal
experience. Despite the Court's re
jection of this uncontroverted evi
dence, I believe it clearly establishes
that unannounced police searches
of newspaper offices will signific
antly burden the constitutionally
protected function of the press to
gather news and report it to the pub
lic.

In Branzburg v. Hayes, the more
limited disclosure of a journalist's
sources caused by compelling him
to testify was held to be justified by

'Protection of. . . sources is necessary to ensure that the
press can fulfill its constitutionally designated function of
informing the public.'

the necessity of "pursuing and pro
secuting those crimes reported to
the press by informants and in thus
deterring the commission of such
crimes in the future," 408 U.S. at
695. The Court found that these im
portant societal interests would be
frustrated if a reporter were able to
claim an absolute privilege for his
confidential sources. In the present
case, however, the respondents do
not claim that any of the evidence

sought was privileged from disclo
sure; they claim only that a sjb
poena would have served equally
well to produce that evidence. Thus,
we are not concerned with the prin
ciple, central to Branzburg, that
" 'the public . . . has a right to every
man's evidence,' " but only with
whether any significant societal in
terest would be impaired if the
police were generally required to
obtain evidence from the press by
means of a subpoena rather than a
search.
It is well to recall the actual cir
cumstances of this case. The appli
cation for a warrant showed only
that there was reason to believe that
photographic evidence of assaults
on the police would be found in the
offices of The Stanford Daily. There
was no emergency need to protect
life or property by an immediate
search. The evidence sought was
not contraband, but material ob
tained by the Daily in the normal
exercise of its journalistic function.
Neither the Daily nor any member of
its staff was suspected of criminal
activity. And there was no showing
the Daily would not respond to a
subpoena commanding production
of the photographs, or that for any
other reason a subpoena could not
be obtained. Surely, then, a sub
poena duces tecum would have
been just as effective as a police raid
in obtaining the production of the
material sought by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney.
The District Court and the Court
of Appeals clearly recognized that if
the affidavits submitted with a
search warrant application should
demonstrate probable cause to be
lieve that a subpoena would be im
practical, the magistrate must have
the authority to issue a warrant. In
such a case, by definition, a sub
poena would not be adequate to
protect the relevant societal in
terest. But they held, and I agree,
that a warrant should issue only after
the magistrate has performed the
careful "balanc(ing) of these vital
constitutional and societal in
terests," Branzburg v. Hayes (con
curring opinion of Mr. Justice Pow
ell).
The decisions of this Court estab
lish that a prior adversary judicial
hearing is generally required to as
sess in advance any threatened inva
sion of First Amendment liberty. A

search by police officers affords no
timely opportunity for such a hear
ing, since a search warrant is ordi
narily issued ex parte upon the af
fidavit of a policeman or prosecutor.
There is no opportunity to challenge
the necessity for the search until
after it has occurred and the con
stitutional protection of the news
paper has been irretrievably in
vaded.
On the other hand, a subpoena

would allow a newspaper, through a
motion to quash, an opportunity for
an adversary hearing with respect to
the production of any material
which a prosecutor might think is in
its possession. This very principle
was emphasized in the Branzburg
case:
"(l)f the newsman is called upon
to give information bearing only a
remote and tenuous relationship to
the subject of the investigation, or if
he has some other reason to believe
that his testimony implicates confi
dential source relationships without
a legitimate need of law enforce

ment, he will have access to 'he
court on a motion to quash and an
appropriate protective order may be
entered," (concurring opinion of
Mr. Justice Powell).
If, in the present case, The Stan
ford Daily had been served with a
subpoena, it would have had an op
portunity to demonstrate to the
court what the police ultimately
found to be true â€” that the evi
dence sought did not exist. The
legitimate needs of government
thus would have been served with
out infringing the freedom of the
press.

Perhaps a* a matter of abstiact
policy a nev i olfice should re
ceive no rnoie protection from un
announced police searches than,
say, the office of a doctor or the
office of a bank. But we are here to
uphold a Constitution. And our
Constitution does not explicitly pro
tect the practice of medicine or the
business of banking from all ab
ridgment by government. It does
explicitly protect the freedom of the
press.
For these reasons I would affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appe
als.
