# Justice Stevens' dissent

Mr. Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The novel problem presented by
this case is an outgrowth of the pro
found change in Fourth Amendment
law that occurred in 1967, when
Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, was
decided. The question is what kind
of "probable cause" must be estab
lished in order to obtain a warrant to
conduct an unannounced search for
documentary evidence in the private
files of a person not suspected of
involvement in any criminal activity.
The Court holds that a reasonable
belief that the files contain relevant
evidence is a sufficient justification.
This holding rests on a misconstruc
tion of history and of the Fourth
Amendment's purposely broad lan
guage.
The Amendment contains two
clauses, one protecting "persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and sei
zures," the other regulating the is
suance of warrants: "no Warrants
shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by Oath or affir
mation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized."
When these words were written, the
procedures of the Warrant Clause
were not the primary protection
against oppressive searches. It is un
likely that the authors expected pri
vate papers ever to be among the
"things" that could be seized with a
warrant, for only a few years earlier,
in 1765, Lord Camden had delivered
his famous opinion denying that any
magistrate had power to authorize
the seizure of private papers. Be
cause all such seizures were consi
dered unreasonable, the Warrant
Clause was not framed to protect
against them.
Nonetheless, the authors of the
Clause used words that were
adequate for situations not ex
pressly contemplated at the time. As
Mr. Justice Black noted, the
Amendment does not "attempt to
describe with precision what was
meant by its words 'probable
cause' the words of the Amend
ment are deliberately "imprecise
and flexible." And Mr. Justice
Stewart, when confronted with the
problem of applying the probable
cause standard in an unprecedented
situation, observed that "(t)he stan
dard of reasonableness embodied in
the Fourth Amendment demands
that the showing of justification
match the degree of intrusion." To
day, for the first time, the Court has
an opportunity to consider the kind
of showing that is necessary to jus
tify the vastly expanded "degree of
intrusion" upon privacy that is au
thorized by the opinion in Warden v.
Hayden, 387 U.S. 294.
In the pre-Hayden era warrants
were used to search for contraband,
weapons and plunder, but not for
"mere evidence." The practical ef
fect of the rule prohibiting the is
suance of warrants to search for
mere evidence was to narrowly limit
not only the category of objects, but

also the category of persons and the
character of the privacy interests
that might be affected by an unan
nounced police search.
Just as the witnesses who partici
pate in an investigation or a trial far
outnumber the defendants, the per
sons who possess evidence that may
help to identify an offender, or exp
lain an aspect of a criminal transac
tion, far outnumber those who have
custody of weapons or plunder.
Countless law abiding citizens —

doctors, lawyers, merchants, cus
tomers, bystanders — may have
documents in their possession that
relate to an ongoing criminal inves
tigation. The consequences of sub
jecting this large category of persons
to unannounced police searches are
extremely serious. The ex parte war
rant procedure enables the pro
secutor to obtain access to
privileged documents that could not
be examined if advance notice gave
the custodian an opportunity to ob
ject. The search for the documents
described in a warrant may involve
the inspection of files containing
other private matter. The dramatic
character of a sudden search may
cause an entirely unjustified injury
to the reputation of the persons
searched.
Of greatest importance, however,
is the question whether the offen
sive intrusion on the privacy of the
ordinary citizen is justified by the
law enforcement interest it is in
tended to vindicate. Possession of
contraband or the proceeds or tools
of crime gives rise to two infer
ences: that the custodian is involved
in the criminal activity, and that, if
given notice of an intended search,
he will conceal or destroy what is
being sought. The probability of
criminal culpability justifies the in
vasion of his privacy; the need to
accomplish the law enforcement
purpose of the search justifies acting
without advance notice and by
force, if necessary. By satisfying the
probable cause standard approp
riate for weapons or plunder, the

police effectively demonstrate that
no less intrusive method of investi
gation will succeed..
Mere possession of documentary
evidence, however, is much less
likely to demonstrate that the custo
dian is guilty of any wrongdoing or
that he will not honor a subpoena or
informal request to produce it. In
the pre-Hayden era, evidence of that
kind was routinely obtained by pro
cedures that presumed that the cus
todian would respect his obligation
to obey subpoenas and to cooperate
in the investigation of crime. These
procedures had a constitutional di
mension. For the innocent citizen's
interest in the privacy of his papers
and possessions is an aspect of lib
erty protected by the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amend
ment. Notice and an opportunity to
object to the deprivation of the citi
zen's liberty are, therefore, the con
stitutionally mandated general rule.
An exception to that rule can only be
justified by strict compliance with
the Fourth Amendment. That
Amendment flatly prohibits the is
suance of any warrant unless jus
tified by probable cause.
A showing of probable cause that
was adequate to justify the issuance
of a warrant to search for stolen
goods in the 18th century does not
automatically satisfy the new dimen
sions of the Fourth Amendment in
the post-Hayden era. In Hayden it
self, the Court recognized that the
meaning of probable cause should
be reconsidered in the light of the
new authority it conferred on the
police. The only conceivable justifi
cation for an unannounced search
of an innocent citizen is the fear
that, if notice were given, he would

and of the Fourth Amendment's
purposely broad language.'

conceal or destroy the object of the
search. Probable cause to believe
that the custodian is a criminal, or
that he holds a criminal's weapons,
spoils, or the like, justifies that fear,
and therefore such a showing com
plies with the Clause. But if nothing
said under oath in the warrant appli
cation demonstrates the need for an
unannounced search by force, the
probable cause requirement is not
satisfied. In the absence of some
other showing of reasonableness,
the ensuing search violates the
Fourth Amendment.
In this case, the warrant applica
tion set forth no facts suggesting
that respondent was involved in any
wrongdoing or would destroy the
desired evidence if given notice of
what the police desired. I would
therefore hold that the warrant did
not comply with the Warrant Clause
and that the search was unreasona
ble within the meaning of the First
Clause of the Fourth Amendment.
I respectfully dissent.


Justice Stevens
