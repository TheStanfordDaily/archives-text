# Justice Powell's concurrence
## 
### 
Mr. justice Powell, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court,
and I write simply to emphasize
what I take to be the fundamental
error of Mr. Justice Stewart's dis
senting opinion. As I understand
that opinion, it would read into the
Fourth Amendment, as a new and
per se exception, the rule that any
search of an entity protected by the
Press Clause of the First Amendment
is unreasonable so long as a sub
poena could be used as a substitute
procedure. Even aside from the dif
ficulties involved in deciding on a
case-by-case basis whether a sub
poena can serve as an adequate sub
stitute, I agree with the Court that
there is no constitutional basis for
such a reading.
If the Framers had believed that
the press was entitled to a special
procedure, not available to others,
when government authorities re
quired evidence in its possession,
one would have expected the terms
of the Fourth Amendment to reflect
that belief. As the opinion of the
Court points out, the struggle from
which the Fourth Amendment
emerged was that between Crown
and press. The Framers were pain
fully aware of that history, and their

response to it was the Fourth
Amendment. Hence, there is every
reason to believe that the usual pro
cedures contemplated by the Fourth
Amendment do indeed apply to the
press, as to every other person.
This is not to say that a warrant
which would be sufficient to sup
port the search of an apartment or

an automobile necessarily would be
reasonable in supporting the search
of a newspaper office. As the
Court's opinion makes clear, the
magistrate must judge the reasona
bleness of every warrant in light of
the circumstances of the particular
case, carefully considering the de
scription of the evidence sought,
the situation of the premises, and
the position and interests of the
owner or occupant. While there is
no justification for the establish
ment of a separate Fourth Amend
ment procedure for the press, a
magistrate asked to issue a warrant
for the search of press offices can
and should take cognizance of the
independent values protected by
the First Amendment — such as
those highlighted by Mr. Justice
Stewart — when he weighs such fac
tors. If the reasonableness and par
ticularity requirements are thus
applied, the dangers are likely to be
minimal.
In any event, considerations such
as these are the province of the
Fourth Amendment. There is no au
thority either in history or in the
Constitution itself for exempting
certain classes of persons or entities
from its reach.
