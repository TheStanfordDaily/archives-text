## Cinemascope 
### 
Chinatown
Monday,
Festival Cinema
A movie about nosy
people, and how they lose
their noses. Directed with in
telligence and venom by
Roman Polanski, and acted
with intelligence and venom
by )ack Nicholson and Faye
Dunaway. A detective movie
with a brain, one that is both
intelligent and venomous.
Not to be missed. With
"Murder My Sweet" (a '42
Marlowe movie with Dick
Powell).
—John Nielsen

If you hated "Saturday

"Saturday Night Fever," then

Summer and The Crusaders
are supposed to be in it, but I
left after an hour and a halt
with hardly a clue as to their
whereabouts. I have nothing
against mindless ripoffs per
se, but T.C.I.F. reaches new
heights of mindless ripoffos
ity. Truly stupid. I hated it.
Don't go.

Variations on a central
theme, all of which appeal
exclusively to the prurient in
terest of the viewer. I went to
see this movie with Uncle
David on my 18th birthday,
and have attempted to go a
few times since then, but I
can't seem to make it through
five minutes without laugh
ing. Guess that means I'm
some kind of weakling. Not a
real man.

Big Wednesday ft
Palo Alto Square
Director John Milius (who
made "The Wind and the
Lion," another exercise in
hot air blowing) took per
fectly mindless material and
created an idiotic, pretenti

ous mess about life, death,
and youth — as they pertain
to surfing. Milius' simple
minded view of reality makes
things even worse
Milius must have been
cloned from someone like
Norman Mailer; how else can
you explain his attitude to
wards life and, specifically,
towards women? If Milius re
ally wants to live his macho
fantasies, why doesn't he get
the hell out of movies and do
something worthwhile, like
play Russian roulette?

Mem Aud, Sunday night
Sydney Pollack's confused
and inconsistent direction
wrecks this film. Pollack takes
a fairly solid script by Alvin
Sargent (who wrote
"julia") and t creates a
travelogue full of empty vis
ual images. Switzerland is
beautiful, and Italy is too, but
does the movie really need so
many long, lazy helicopter
shots of landscape? Much of
this film would make much
more sense as part of a big
travel commercial.
Finally, Pollack mistakes
slowness for art; he destroys
nearly all of the movie's per
formances with his dull pac
ing. Only Al Pacino rises (just
barely) above the film's
glossy emptiness to give a re
spectable performance in the
title role.

The End ★★
Old Mill
Burt Reynolds tries to do
something completely diffe
rent — which is admirable —
and winds up doing nearly
nothing in this comedy about
a man who has only a few
months to live.
Reynolds is too damn care
ful, both as director and star,
in this film. I kept waiting for
him to do some of the things
he does right, put us on, or
something, but he keeps try
ing to play a self-pitying buf
foon.
Reynolds is technically a

good enough director, but so
what? He needs to reconcile
himself to the fact that he can
only do a certain number of
things well. He's very
talented, but he can't possi
bly play the Woody Allen
type that he portrays in "The
End."
To unabashedly steal a line,
I admire Reynolds' courage
but question his judgment in
making "The End."
—R.L.
The Greek Tycoon
Fine Arts
In 1976, "Once is Not
Enough" was released. Last

year brought us "The Other
Side of Midnight." This year,
"The Creek Tycoon" joins
these instantly forgettable
soap opera movies which
celebrate the vapidness of the
rich and of moviemakers.
The film details the "inside
story" of the Aristotle
Onassis-jackie Kennedy mar
riage. The names have been
changed, of course (to To
masis and Cassidy). Like its
innumerable predecessors,
this tripe will probably make a
lot of money, confirming the
opinion in Hollywood that
glossy garbage pays.
—R.L.

F.I.S.T *★
Palo Alto Square
Employs "The Godfather"
films' scope but lacks their
depth. This story of the epic
rise and fall of a union leader
reminds one especially of the
Michael Corleone section of
"Godfather II"; to excess, in
fact. The Congressional hear
ings and the murders from
that film are unabashedly —
and in comparison, badly —
imitated here.
The director, Norman |ewi
son, asks the audience to ac
cept way too much, and he
also fails to give the film any
sense of consistently believa

ble passion or tension. His
surface approach to the mate
rial is the film's biggest liabil
ity. What the movie desper
ately needed was a director
with sociological (and artistic)
insight; i.e., someone like
Francis Ford Coppola.
The film is kept from be
coming abysmal by Sylvester
Stallone's galvanic, if uneven,
performance as johnny
Kovacs, member, and even
tually leader, of F.I.S.T". (Fed
eration of Interstate Truc
kers). His performance con
tains the film's only moments
of passion. These moments
only serve to heighten the

remainder of the film's frus
trating somberness and emo
tional emptiness.
—R.L.
The Last Waltz
Century 21, San |ose
The cinematography is flaw
less, as should be expected
from the director of "Mean
Streets," "Taxi Driver," and
"New York, New York" (Mar
tin Scorsese, stupid). Unlike
most rock and roll films —
they traditionally have done
little more than provide View
Master recreations of two
hour guitar solos — unlike
most of those "Waltz" man
ages a superb marriage of the
concert and the documen
tary. It is a genuine thrill to see
a song you have only known
in disembodied form emerge
from the mouth of a genuine
human being; human beings
in this production include
Bob Dylan, Neil Young, )oni
Mitchell, Neil Diamond,
Muddy Waters and Eric Clap
ton. Without a doubt, the
finest rock film extant.

The Goodbye Girl **
Old Mill
Famous Oscar winner
Richard Dreyfuss won his
famous Oscar in this picture,
which also features Neil Si
mon's wife and a mutant child
actress. "Goodbye" tells the
story of a fast-mouthed ro
mance and is distinguishable
from "Barefoot in the Park"
because it is set in a different
part of New York. Be on the
lookout for Simon's upcom
ing hits, too — "The Odd
Goodbye," "The Goodbye
Couple," "California Good
bye" and "Murder by Good
bye." What an artist this man
is. Hollywood's finest.

Festival Cinema
A movie about nosy
people, and how they lose
their noses. Directed with in
telligence and venom by
Roman Polanski, and acted
with intelligence and venom
by )ack Nicholson and Faye
Dunaway. A detective movie
with a brain, one that is both
intelligent and venomous.
Not to be missed. With
"Murder My Sweet" (a '42
Marlowe movie with Dick
Powell).

Director John Milius (who
made "The Wind and the

hot air blowing) took per

created an idiotic, pretenti

to surfing. Milius' simple

things even worse
Milius must have been
cloned from someone like
Norman Mailer; how else can
you explain his attitude to

Mem Aud, Sunday night
Sydney Pollack's confused
and inconsistent direction
wrecks this film. Pollack takes
a fairly solid script by Alvin
Sargent (who wrote
"julia") and t creates a
travelogue full of empty vis
ual images. Switzerland is
beautiful, and Italy is too, but
does the movie really need so
many long, lazy helicopter
shots of landscape? Much of
this film would make much
more sense as part of a big
travel commercial.
Finally, Pollack mistakes
slowness for art; he destroys
nearly all of the movie's per
formances with his dull pac
ing. Only Al Pacino rises (just
barely) above the film's
glossy emptiness to give a re
spectable performance in the
title role.

The End ★★
Old Mill
Burt Reynolds tries to do
something completely diffe
rent — which is admirable —
and winds up doing nearly
nothing in this comedy about
a man who has only a few
months to live.
Reynolds is too damn care
ful, both as director and star,
in this film. I kept waiting for
him to do some of the things
he does right, put us on, or
something, but he keeps try
ing to play a self-pitying buf
foon.
Reynolds is technically a

good enough director, but so
what? He needs to reconcile
himself to the fact that he can
only do a certain number of
things well. He's very
talented, but he can't possi
bly play the Woody Allen
type that he portrays in "The
End."
To unabashedly steal a line,
I admire Reynolds' courage
but question his judgment in
making "The End."

The Greek Tycoon
Fine Arts
In 1976, "Once is Not
Enough" was released. Last

year brought us "The Other
Side of Midnight." This year,
"The Creek Tycoon" joins
these instantly forgettable
soap opera movies which
celebrate the vapidness of the
rich and of moviemakers.
The film details the "inside
story" of the Aristotle
Onassis-jackie Kennedy mar
riage. The names have been
changed, of course (to To
masis and Cassidy). Like its
innumerable predecessors,
this tripe will probably make a
lot of money, confirming the
opinion in Hollywood that
glossy garbage pays.
—R.L.

F.I.S.T *★
Palo Alto Square
Employs "The Godfather"
films' scope but lacks their
depth. This story of the epic
rise and fall of a union leader
reminds one especially of the
Michael Corleone section of
"Godfather II"; to excess, in
fact. The Congressional hear
ings and the murders from
that film are unabashedly —
and in comparison, badly —
imitated here.
The director, Norman |ewi
son, asks the audience to ac
cept way too much, and he
also fails to give the film any
sense of consistently believa

ble passion or tension. His
surface approach to the mate
rial is the film's biggest liabil
ity. What the movie desper
ately needed was a director
with sociological (and artistic)
insight; i.e., someone like
Francis Ford Coppola.
The film is kept from be
coming abysmal by Sylvester
Stallone's galvanic, if uneven,
performance as johnny
Kovacs, member, and even
tually leader, of F.I.S.T". (Fed
eration of Interstate Truc
kers). His performance con
tains the film's only moments
of passion. These moments
only serve to heighten the

remainder of the film's frus

The Last Waltz
Century 21, San |ose
The cinematography is flaw
less, as should be expected
from the director of "Mean
Streets," "Taxi Driver," and
"New York, New York" (Mar
tin Scorsese, stupid). Unlike
most rock and roll films —
they traditionally have done
little more than provide View
Master recreations of two
hour guitar solos — unlike
most of those "Waltz" man
ages a superb marriage of the
concert and the documen
tary. It is a genuine thrill to see
a song you have only known
in disembodied form emerge
from the mouth of a genuine
human being; human beings
in this production include
Bob Dylan, Neil Young, )oni
Mitchell, Neil Diamond,
Muddy Waters and Eric Clap

finest rock film extant.

The Goodbye Girl **
Old Mill
Famous Oscar winner
Richard Dreyfuss won his

story of a fast-mouthed ro

from "Barefoot in the Park"
because it is set in a different
part of New York. Be on the
lookout for Simon's upcom
