"Madame Rosa" is what
anyone who has never seen a
foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. First of
all, its in a foreign language,
which means that most of us
yahoos in the audience are
torn for two hours between
reading the movie and watch
ing it. Second, while it is a very
good film, beautifully acted,
with moments of terrible
poignancy, "Madame Rosa"
also has more than its share of
loose ends. It is badly edited,
and (I hope) badly translated;.
it tends to drag at times and to
run a little heavy on pathos.
However, and this is the
operative phrase, "Rosa" has
more than enough high

quality raw material to nhake it
worth your while.
Whore
"Rosa" 1 'is the story Of an
aging whore who has in the
beginning of the picture been
relegated to the fifth floor of
the brothel, where she takes
care of the accidental sons and
daughters of those at work on
floors one through four. She is
ugly, and talks incessantly
about her suffering as a Jew,
and her favorite ward is a
young, volatile Arab who con
tinually gives her trouble.
When Rosa becomes too old
even to serve as a caretaker,
the young Arab stays with her
and protects her, and watches
over her as she slowly decays
and dies. Neither enjoys hav

ing to admit having any sort of
affection for the other, but by
the end the two are attached
by the strongest of psycholog
ical bonds.
Simone Signoret carries off
her role very well, as do all of
the principles in "Rosa." She
carries the whole film, in fact,
overcoming the occasionally
dumb dialogue, providing the
thing with humor at the most
unexpected moments. Every
time you read a subtitle you
know you've missed some
thing important on her face,
and when she is at her
strongest this film is excellent.
It is, unfortunately, one of
them foreign movies, but it
kind of makes me wish I
hadn't dropped French 10.
