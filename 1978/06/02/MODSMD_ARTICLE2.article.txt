Jewish students here will sponsor a June 17 ceremony,
"The Jewish Graduation Celebration," to compliment
the University's traditional baccalaureate service, Rich
Waldow, co-organizer of the celebration, said Wednes
day.
The purpose of the ceremony is to give each student,
before leaving the close-knit Stanford community, an
opportunity to reaffirm his or her identification with
Judaism, according to Linda Bernhard, spokesperson for
the celebration planning committee.
"The celebration is scheduled early (1:30 p.m.) so that
it will add to, and not compete with, the baccalaureate,"
Waldow said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president for public affairs,
expressed relief that the celebration would end in time
to allow Jewish students to participate in the 2:30 p.m.
baccalaureate.
"The events of commencement ought to bring the
class together and not fragment students along racial or
religious lines," he said.
Last year Jewish students sponsored an alternative
service scheduled during baccalaureate but in a separate
building.

"Last year's ceremony scheduling was partly a protest
against the baccalaureate taking place in Memorial
Church — clearly a Christian church," Rosenzweig said.
"In response to last year's conflict the administration
purposely scheduled baccalaureate outdoors this year,"
he said.
"Any group of students is perfectly welcome to or
ganize whatever graduation function they perceive
meets the particular needs of their members,"
Rosenzweig said. "The administration is not in conflict
in any way with this sort of thing."
The Jewish Graduation Celebration will take place in
Skilling Auditorium and, although intended primarily
for graduating seniors, friends and faculty, is open to the
public, Waldow said.
English Assoc. Prof. John Felstiner will be the cere
mony speaker. Bernhard said the celebration committee
wanted a faculty member who has been involved in
Hillel and the Jewish community and Felstiner has re
ceived the Hillel Gold Key, an award given to outstand
ing contributors within the Jewish community. Felstiner
serves on the Hillel advisory committee and is chairper
son of the Jewish faculty luncheons.
"There will bean outdoor reception for graduates and
their guests shortly after the celebration," he said.
