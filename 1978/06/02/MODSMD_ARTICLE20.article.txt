# Tracksters heading for finals Lofton jumps 25-11 in trials
## 
### 
Long jump virtuoso James
Lofton set the best mark in the
trials yesterday by leaping 25-
foot-11 in the NCAA Track and
Field Championships in
Eugene, Ore. Lofton and Dar
rin Nelson, who posied the
sixth best mark of the day at
25-4%, will both advance to the
finals.
In other events, the Cards
also fared well. Stanford

finished third behind Long
Beach State and Arizona State
in its preliminary heat of the
400 meter relay with a 40.19
clocking.
Today, distance star Roy Kis
sin will compete in the 10,000
meter final.
Lofton has his sights set on
the national title that has
eluded him for the past two
years. The senior from Los

Angeles has twice placed third
in the NCAA outdoor finals and
twice finished second in the
NCAA indoor championships.
A year ago, Lofton jumped
26-7 Vi at the nationals after
leaping 26-4% to win the
Pacific-8 title. Last week, he
claimed his second straight
conference championship by
jumping 25-9V2 into a strong
wind to outdistance the field

by nearly a foot and a half. His
lifetime best is 26-9.
"I think James is ready to win
it all this year," said Stanford
coach Payton Jordan. "He's
had a great season in both the
long jump and the sprints, but
he's really intent on winning
the NCAA championship this
time. So, we've taken him out
of the 200 meters so he can
concentrate more on his spe
cialty."
The 400 meter relay team,
anchored by Lofton, clocked a
39.% at the Pac-8 meet and has
a seasonal best of 39.7, a school
record. Nelson runs the
leadoff leg for the foursome,
followed by senior Alan Sheats
and sophomore Cordon
Banks.
Nelson's 25-4 V* in the long
jump yesterday exceeded his
personal best, without wind,
by3V4 inches.
