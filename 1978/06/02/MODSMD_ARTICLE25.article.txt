# Yell leaders planning for fall
## 
### Chris Haft 
Annoyance and boredom
were among the more promi
nent feelings students had to
wards last year's hard-working
but seldom-appreciated yell
leaders. The 1978-79 yell lead
ers, chosen in late April, hope
to change these reactions to
positive ones of excitement
and fun.
A fresh approach and an
earnest attitude will charac
terize the efforts of new yell
leaders Karen Brower, Seth El
lison, Sue Goldfarb, Doug
Greenfield, Louise Ostendorf
and Martin Pena to stimulate
student enthusiasm.
The new yell leaders are a
diverse group — some are ex
cellent dancers, others are
fine actors — and they plan to
coordinate their talents into
original routines.
"We're coming up with new
yells and new ideas so people
won't think we're a bunch of
incompetents," said Goldfarb,
who thought that last year's
yell leaders did "a damn good
job."
The yell leaders did not dis
close any details of their inno
vations, preferring to keep ev
erything secret until football
season.
However, one can expect to
see some singing, a few dance
soticks accompanying some
Stanford Band songs, and
maybe even satirical routines.
Another change will be the
yell leaders' presence in the
stands. We'll be in the stands
actively leading yells,"
Goldfarb asserted. "People
won't think we're six weirdos
down on the field."
The only holdover from last
year's acts will be the popular
"Stanford spell-out," and even
this may be altered, as the yell
leaders hope to spell other
words besides "Stanford."
It is uncertain whether or
not the yell leaders will utilize
sexually risque themes in their
yells. "We don't want to de
pend on sexual overtones
such as 'Score standing up,'
though we may end up doing
that," said Greenfield.
New uniforms, featuring a
Superman-type "S" logo
rather than a block S, will also
be a part of the yell leaders'
act. Greenfield described the
outfits as "traditional, but very
light and comfortable so we
can fly around."
Keeping fans occupied
An obvious function of the
yell leaders is to encourage

the students to give the team
vocal support, thus increasing
student participation and en
thusiasm.
Pena said he feels that stu
dents aren't very interested in
yelling, and claims that keep
ing the fans occupied when the
games slow down is a more
important function.
"Stanford students are not
really willing to yell a lot —
yelling is secondary here," he
said. "Sometimes games get a
little drawn-out, so the yell
leaders are there to enter
tain."
"We're adding another di
mension to the game, making
it a real show," Greenfield ag
reed. "As long as we don't set
goals, we'll be okay. We can't
expect to get 30,000 people
cheering — we just want to get
people to enjoy what we're do
ing.
"Good times don't depend
on the nature of the football
game; they depend on how
things are presented, and we
have the talent to present
them well."
Greenfield also emphasized
that the yell leaders shouldn't
concentrate on just football.
"We have to become more in
volved in all sports. Other
teams deserve support, too.
Football doesn't really need
us; they can't hear what we're
saying, and they expect a lot of
cheering anyway."
Frame of mind
Greenfield and Pena insisted
that a yell leader must have a
proper frame of mind to per
form efficiently.
"You need the confidence
to believe that what you're
doing is not crap, and the
courage to perform before
90,000 people," said Green
field. "Most of all, he needs to
really enjoy being with people
constantly."
"We have to be open
minded," Pena added. "We're
trying to please a particular
audience, and we have to put
ourselves in the fans' situa
tion, which is pretty hard."
Representatives
Being a yell leader gives a
person a chance to be uninhi
bited. "It's a license to be
weird," Greenfield said.
Yet all of them agreed that
their position also makes them
representatives of Stanford
University, thus giving them
the responsibility of accurately
expressing the character of the
student body.

"It's not important to be like
the USC or UCLA yell leaders
with their card sections and
unified cheers, because that's
not representative of our stu
dent body," Greenfield ex
plained.
"Stanford's student body is
not that unified," he said.
"What we are is creative, and
creative people ought to have
creative cheers.
"We would love to have
suggestions from anybody.
There is tremendous talent
here at Stanford, and if we
could receive ideas and sup
port, it would be great. We're
not an infinite well of ideas."
Changing attitudes
Pena echoed the impor
tance of student feedback in
eliminating the yell leaders'
slightly negative image. "It's
hard to change that attitude
right away," he said. "We
need to find out what students
want from us."
Working already
Though the yell leaders
won't debut until the Ok
lahoma game September 9,

they have practicing for about
a month. "We've been trying
to get together a couple of
routines for the first game —
just basic stuff," said Goldfarb.
The yell leaders will be
working closely with the Stan
ford Band, and must structure
their acts to complement
those of the LSJUMB. "This
will be hard, since they are
such a bizarre group," Green
field said. "But I foresee no
problems."
Greenfield understands that
the Band will be the object of
general attention. "A yell
leader must realize that he's
second fiddle to the Band.
They're the main attraction,
and people come to see
them."
Still, the yell leaders will de
finitely remain a recognizable
entity. It will be interesting to
see how the students receive
them this fall. Judging from
their present excitement and
their promises of originality,
the yell leaders should do a lot
more than just keep every
body in good cheer.

routine may be part of the group's repetoire next fall is ... well, it's a secret.
