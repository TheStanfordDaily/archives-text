U.S. Embassy in Moscow bugged
Washington — Electronic devices of "an intelligence
gathering nature" were discovered in a chimney of the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow earlier this week, administra
tion officials said yesterday.
One official, who asked not to be named, said the
espionage equipment represented a "fairly serious
penetration of our embassy."
He said the electronic gear was apparently regularly
maintained by Soviet technicians who entered the em
bassy by crawling through a tunnel and then climbing up
the chimney.
The official said the electronic equipment, which in
cluded an antenna, was being analyzed. He added that a
"damage assessment" of possible information obtained
by the Soviets was under way.
No federal newspaper searches
Washington — The Justice Department will not use the
authority of a new Supreme Court decision to launch
surprise searches of newspaper offices, Deputy Attor
ney General Benjamin Civiletti said yesterday.
Civiletti said in criminal cases the government will try
to obtain information from news organizations through
subpoenas before seeking a search warrant. He said that
was in keeping with the policy already in effect under
Attorney General Griffin Bell.
However, Civiletti acknowledged, the Justice De
partment has no control over local police forces that may
wish to obtain information from news organizations.
Prop. 13 to kill state programs
Los Angeles — Under Proposition 13, counties would
be $40 million short of what they need to pay for state
mandated programs — with nothing for "options" like
libraries, parks or special services for the disabled, a
spokeswoman for a statewide counties association said
yesterday.
Even mandated programs will be jeopardized because
counties won't be able to pay for them by borrowing
money as they normally do when property tax revenues
run out in late July or August, said Sandra Smoley, presi
dent of the County Supervisors Association of Califor
nia.
She said counties would be unable to borrow because
it is uncertain how much — if any — property tax re
venues they would be allocated and receive later in the
year under Jarvis.
"As a recourse, counties may be forced to register
warrants — a process whereby checks are issued but
payment is suspended until a later date," Smoley said at
a news conference in Los Angeles, one of three such
sessions held around the state yesterday. Others were in
Sacramento and San Diego.

Herzog pushes Mideast peace talks
United Nations — Israeli U.N. Ambassador Chaim
Herzog called yesterday for an all-embracing Arab-
Israeli disarmament conference "to break the vicious
cycle of arms buildup in the Middle East."
Addressing the General Assembly's special session on
disarmament, Herzog also said it is Israel's "hope and
trust" there will be a resumption of the Israeli-Egyptian
peace negotiations broken off in January by Egypt's Pres
ident Anwar Sadat.
Referring to those unprecedented talks, Herzog said
Israel "believes that a similar breakthrough can and
must occur in the field of disarmament and that another
momentous step can and must be taken to break the
vicious cycle of the arms buildup in the Middle East."
Just hours earlier, Herzog told a television interviewer
he did not believe the U.N. disarmament conference
would produce anything and that his country would ask
the United States for more arms.
Outlook for economic growth hopeful
Washington — Despite worsening inflation, the out
look for economic growth improved moderately in Ap
ril, government figures indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department's index of leading indi
cators increased 0.5 per cent in April after declining 0.1
per cent in March. The index is designed to forecast
economic activity but it often takes several months to
establish a trend.
Government economists expect the economy to grow
rapidly in the second quarter after declining slightly in
the first three months of the year.
The growing economy has helped reduce the un
employment rate to 6 per cent, and a report today will
show whether it declined further in May.
Dow Jones shows slight gain
New York — The stock market meandered yesterday.
Prices of most issues rose and fell within a narrow range
as investors analyzed the latest economic data.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed
fractionally higher, up .09 to 840.70.
Volume was 28.75 million, a trifle less than Wednes
day's activity. Issues losing value barely outnumbered
those gaining.
