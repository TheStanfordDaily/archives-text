# Women's panel agrees
## Slim chance for quick ERA passage 
### Susan Wels 
Progress toward passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is
slow "because of division within the
women's movement," according to
the eight members of an "ERA
Teach-In" panel.
About 150 persons attended the
forum, held Tuesday in Bishop Au
ditorium.
The pro-ERA panel was generally
pessimistic about chances that three
more states will ratify the amend
ment before the ratification deadline
March 22, 1979. Although 35 states
have already ratified the ERA, 38 must
do so before the amendment be
comes part of the Constitution.
According to panelist Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, professor of law at Col
umbia University and a fellow at
Stanford's Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the

ERA is a general statement that would
spur federal and state legislators to
reform archaic, gender-based laws.
It would allow judges to apply un
iformly the principle that women and
men are equal under the law.
Moderator Lee Novick, ASSU
guest professor and coordinator of
the National Women's Conference at
Houston, said the proposed
amendment has been supported by
the past six U.S. presidents as well as
by both major political parties.
"If there were a national referen
dum today, there is no doubt that it
would pass," she said.
But several obstacles, including
fear and confusion about the ERA's
potential impact and a powerful
anti-ERA lobbying effort by conserva
tive organizations, have made it dif
ficult for the women's movement to
focus its efforts, she said.
Zoe Lofgren, an attorney and ad
ministrative assistant to Con
gressman Don Edwards (D-San Jose),
said there is also a division of labor
within the women's movement,
causing further problems for ERA
supporters.
While many ERA advocates con
tinue to work directly for ratification
in the remaining three states, others
have redirected their efforts toward
support of a Congressional resolu
tion, co-sponsored by Edwards,
which would extend the ratification
deadline seven more years, Lofgren
said.
The ERA was originally given a
seven-year time limit for ratification.
But Lofgren said such time limita
tions on constitutional amendments
were never imposed before the turn
of the century.
"We don't have time, I believe, to
get the amendment passed by
three-quarters of the states," she

said, but added "The outlook for ex
tension is 'iffy' at best."
Unified support of ERA within the
women's movement is only possible
if white middle-class feminists be
come more sensitive to their minor
ity and working-class counterparts,
said Maria Chacon, co-director of the
Stanford Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE).
"It is time to stop allotting five mi
nutes for the minority viewpoint,"
Chacon said. She added that white
women mistakenly view minority
women as a homogeneous group
with similar needs and frequently ig
nore their views.
"Minority women must not be re
legated to minority issues," she said.
