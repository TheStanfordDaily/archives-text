# House approves tuition tax credit
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — A bill providing
income tax credits of up to $250
against the cost of college tuition and
$100 against private elementary and
secondary school tuition was passed
237-158 by the House yesterday.
President Jimmy Carter has
threatened to veto any such legisla
tion, and the close vote tended to
confirm estimates that a veto could
not be overriden.
But the House, disregarding op
ponents' arguments that passage
would be a hoax, not only passed the
measure but wrote into it the new
provision for lower school tuition, a
proposal which Carter has objected
to most strongly. That vote was 209-
194.
The bill now goes to the Senate,
which traditionally has been more
favorable to tuition credits. The Se
nate Finance Committee has ap
proved a measure for credits of up to
$500.
$100 this year
The House-passed measure would
allow a taxpayer a tax credit for each
student equal to 25 per cent of col
lege or other postsecondary tuition,
up to a total of $100 this year, $150 in
1979 and $250 in 1980. Congress then
would consider whether to continue
the program.
The credits for elementary and
secondary tuition also would be at 25
per cent, but the maximums would
be $50 this year and $100 in each of
the next two years.
The cost to the U.S. Treasury in lost
taxes was estimated at $635 million in
the 1979 fiscal year, beginning this
Oct. 1; $1.1 billion in fiscal 1980 and
$1.2 billion in fiscal 1981.
Supporters of the college tuition
credit argued it would provide over
due relief to middle-income families
coping with rising college costs but
ineligible for most private programs.
Constitutional dispute
The amendment to extend tax cre
dits to elementary and secondary tui
tion brought up longstanding con
stitutional arguments, since much of

the benefit would go to parents of
children in Roman Catholic and
other denominational schools.
But Rep. Charles Vanik (D-Ohio),
said, "I don't think there is going to
be any problem with the courts."
He said private schools are provid
ing quality education at less cost than
public schools and that in major
cities, 40 to 50 per cent of their en
rollment comes from minority
groups.
Vanik contended "83 per cent of
the benefits would go to families
with total income below $28,000 —
that's two wage earners at $14,000
each."
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), cos
ponsor of the amendment, said the
proportion of children in private
schools had fallen in a decade from
13 per cent to 9.8 per cent, and "that
tells what has happened to American
families' freedom of choice."
'Cruel hoax'
But Rep. Martha Keys (D-Kan.) said
the bill is "a cruel hoax.
"We have seen unexpected in
creases in tuition at even the sugges
tion that this wbuld be passed," she
said. . . Parochial schools have
made it clear that they intend im
mediately to increase their tuition if
this becomes law."
Rep. Abner Mikva (D-lll), said the
Justice Department has expressed
the opinion the measure is uncon
stitutional. "By any stretch of the
imagination how can a president sign
a bill when his attorney general has
said it is unconstitutional?" he asked.
Rep. Parren Mitchell (D-Md.),
suggested the bill would foster the
spread of private schools set up to
avoid desegregation.
Veto?
At a session with newspaper
editors in April, Carter was asked
whether he would veto a tuition tax
credit bill. He said he could not
commit himself absolutely without
seeing the legislation, but com
mented:
"My present intention would be to
veto any bill that was costly and
which was unconstitutional. All the
proposals I have seen in the Con
gress so far are both costly and un
constitutional, particularly as they
apply to elementary and secondary
schools."
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
told reporters he expects a veto if the
bill is passed by both chambers. He
said legislation in accordance with
Carter's recommendations would be
ready for consideration if the bill
were vetoed.
In place of the tax credits, Carter
has proposed a $1.2 billion expan
sion of existing college aid programs
with provisions so that families up to
$25,000 income could share in the
benefits.

Veto?
At a session with newspaper
editors in April, Carter was asked
whether he would veto a tuition tax
credit bill. He said he could not
commit himself absolutely without
seeing the legislation, but com
mented:
"My present intention would be to
veto any bill that was costly and
which was unconstitutional. All the
proposals I have seen in the Con
gress so far are both costly and un
constitutional, particularly as they
apply to elementary and secondary
schools."
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
told reporters he expects a veto if the
bill is passed by both chambers. He
said legislation in accordance with
Carter's recommendations would be
ready for consideration if the bill
were vetoed.
In place of the tax credits, Carter
has proposed a $1.2 billion expan
sion of existing college aid programs
with provisions so that families up to
$25,000 income could share in the
benefits.
Washington (AP) — A bill providing
income tax credits of up to $250
against the cost of college tuition and
$100 against private elementary and
secondary school tuition was passed
237-158 by the House yesterday.
President Jimmy Carter has
threatened to veto any such legisla
tion, and the close vote tended to
confirm estimates that a veto could
not be overriden.
But the House, disregarding op
ponents' arguments that passage
would be a hoax, not only passed the
measure but wrote into it the new
provision for lower school tuition, a
proposal which Carter has objected
to most strongly. That vote was 209-
194.
The bill now goes to the Senate,
which traditionally has been more
favorable to tuition credits. The Se
nate Finance Committee has ap
proved a measure for credits of up to
$500.
$100 this year
The House-passed measure would
allow a taxpayer a tax credit for each
student equal to 25 per cent of col
lege or other postsecondary tuition,
up to a total of $100 this year, $150 in
1979 and $250 in 1980. Congress then
would consider whether to continue
the program.
The credits for elementary and
secondary tuition also would be at 25
per cent, but the maximums would
be $50 this year and $100 in each of
the next two years.
The cost to the U.S. Treasury in lost
taxes was estimated at $635 million in
the 1979 fiscal year, beginning this
Oct. 1; $1.1 billion in fiscal 1980 and
$1.2 billion in fiscal 1981.
Supporters of the college tuition
credit argued it would provide over
due relief to middle-income families
coping with rising college costs but
ineligible for most private programs.
Constitutional dispute
The amendment to extend tax cre
dits to elementary and secondary tui
tion brought up longstanding con
stitutional arguments, since much of

the benefit would go to parents of
children in Roman Catholic and
other denominational schools.
But Rep. Charles Vanik (D-Ohio),
said, "I don't think there is going to
be any problem with the courts."
He said private schools are provid
ing quality education at less cost than
public schools and that in major
cities, 40 to 50 per cent of their en
rollment comes from minority
groups.
Vanik contended "83 per cent of
the benefits would go to families
with total income below $28,000 —
that's two wage earners at $14,000
each."
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), cos
ponsor of the amendment, said the
proportion of children in private
schools had fallen in a decade from
13 per cent to 9.8 per cent, and "that
tells what has happened to American
families' freedom of choice."
'Cruel hoax'
But Rep. Martha Keys (D-Kan.) said
the bill is "a cruel hoax.
"We have seen unexpected in
creases in tuition at even the sugges
tion that this wbuld be passed," she
said. . . Parochial schools have
made it clear that they intend im
mediately to increase their tuition if
this becomes law."
Rep. Abner Mikva (D-lll), said the
Justice Department has expressed
the opinion the measure is uncon
stitutional. "By any stretch of the
imagination how can a president sign
a bill when his attorney general has
said it is unconstitutional?" he asked.
Rep. Parren Mitchell (D-Md.),
suggested the bill would foster the
spread of private schools set up to
avoid desegregation.
