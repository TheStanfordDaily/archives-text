# Lake Lagunita's water turbid but not contaminated
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
If you've had doubts while wading
through the murky waters of Lake
Lagunita, you don't have to worry
about your health, but watch out for
your safety.
According to Hal Wilson, health
and safety specialist for the Univer
sity, the water has not yet reached
the level of bacteriological contami
nation where swimming would have
to be prohibited.
Nevertheless, "I wouldn't swim
there," Wilson said. From a safety
standpoint, it's hazardous, he ad
ded.
"It's so turbid that if you dive in
and hit your head or get tangled up in
the weeds, nobody could see you."
Two weeks ago Wilson made a
routine analysis of the water for its
content of E. Coli, the standard indi
cator of bacteriological contamina
tion.
In one water sample, the count
was 2.1 parts per million, just under
the 2.2 maximum allowed in Califor
nia's drinking water. Another sample
registered 2.4 ppm, but although this
count exceeds drinking levels, the

water is not bacteriologically unfit for
recreational uses.
Wilson stressed that bacterial con
tent is just one of the factors deter
mining potability. Lake Lag's water is
not potable because of its turbidity,
taste, odor and color, he said.
Yesterday Wilson trekked to Lag in
response to complaints that the
water smelled bad. "You could tell
just by looking that the cause was an
algae bloom," he said, explaining
that when large amounts of algae
grow and die, they give off strange
odors.
He also looked for mosquito lar
vae, but found none. "Mosquitoes
have been reported but they must be
breeding elsewhere," he said.
Wilson said there is less weed
growth in the lake this year, perhaps
because the drought killed germinat
ing seeds.
He also noted that the lake stayed
high because more water came out
of the hills, causing excess runoff
from Searsville and Felt Lakes.
