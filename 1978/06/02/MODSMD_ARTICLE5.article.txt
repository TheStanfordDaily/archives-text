# Voters to decide party nominees, propositions Tuesday
## 
### Rob Lempert 
Record numbers of Santa Clara
County voters have registered to
vote in the June 6 primary elections
in which Californians will choose
candidates for governor and other
statewide offices as well as decide
the fate of the controversial, tax
slashing Jarvis-Gann initiative.
Also on the ballot will be the
names of candidates for Congress
and for the state legislature, vying for
their party's endorsements in the
general election this November.
The 549,472 persons registered in
Santa Clara County is a local record
for a primary election, said George
Mann, the county's registrar of vot
ers.
Ten polling places will be open in
the area Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 8
p.m. Polls will be set up at Wilbur,
Kairos House, Terra House, Escon
dido School, Nixon School, Wo
men's Club House, Campus Recrea
tion Association Building and the
Creger residence. Two booths will
also be set up in Tresidder.
Gov. Jerry Brown is being opposed
by eight challengers including a
modern artist and a custodian, for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomi

nation. Challengers include Alex
Aloia, professor; David Rock,
businessman; George Roden;
Raymond Lienenberg, chiropractor;
Gene Atherton, physician; Jules
Kimmett, custodian; Lowell Darling,
modern artist and John Abbott, polit
ical scientist.
None of the challengers are consi
dered to have even an outside
chance of taking the nomination
from the incumbant governor.

The race for the Republican nomi
nation is more exciting. Attorney
Cenferal Evelle Younger currently
leads the field of seven candidates,
closely followed by Police Chief Ed
Davis of Los Angeles. Assemblyman
Ken Maddy of Fresno and Mayor Pete
Wilson of San Diego are also in the
running.
Others on the Republican ballot
are Elmer Crutchley of Ventura and
True Slocum of Encino and state
Senator John Briggs of Fullerton is on
the ballot but has withdrawn from
the race and has given his support to
Davis.
Lt. Governor Mervyn Dymally, a
Democrat from Los Angeles, is op
posed by challengers Patrick Fitzpat
rick of Orange County, Donald
Lynch of San Francisco, Abe Tapia of
Los Angeles and businesswoman
Penny Raven of Fresno.
Dymally, the state's first black
lieutenant governor, should win the
nomination easily.
Two Republicans, Assemblyman
Mike Antonovich of Glendale and
entertainment executive Mike Curb
of Hollywood, are fighting to face
Dymally in November.
Democratic Secretary of State

March Fong Eu is running unop
posed while Norrisa Poulson of
Orange County, Jacob Margosian of
Contra Costa County and Steve Nash
of Los Angeles are vying for the Re
publican nomination.
Ken Cory, state controller, should
easily beat his opponent, Joseph
O'Green of Glendale, forthe democ
ratic nomination, while San Mateo's
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett should
defeat his opponent James Ware of
Los Angeles on the Republican side.
It is expected that'the articulate Ar
nett should give Cory, also a skillful
politician, a tough battle in
November.
State Treasurer Jesse Unruh has
yet to face any serious opposition
from his Democratic primary oppo
nent William Burkett of Pebble Beach
or Republican challengers Donald
French of Richmond and Mama
Schnabel of Malibu.
There is no incumbent in the race
for attorney general because Evelle
Younger is running for governor. On
the Republican side, former U.S. At
torney James Browning faces State
Senator George Deukmejian of Long
Beach. Yvonne Burke and Bert Pines,
both of Los Angeles, are competing

for the Democratic nomination.
In local races, Republican Con
gressman Pete McCloskey will face
Memorex executive Joseph Zingale
of Campbell. Unlike past years when
McCloskey has had to struggle for
renomination, the incumbent is ex
pected to win easily this time. His
Democratic opponent will be either
Ron Davis, systems analyst or Kirsten
Olsen, financial counselor.

Incumbent State Senator Arlen
Gregorio of San Mateo is running
unopposed for the democratic
nomination, while Laddie Hughes
and Marz Garcia vye for the Republi
can bid.
The 21st Assembly District is the
race of the unopposed candidates as
Democratic incumbent Victor Calvo
and Republican Stanford graduate
Greg Morris face no opposition for
their respective party nominations.
In addition, 13 state propositions
are on the ballot. Among them is
Prop. 13, certainly the hottest item
on Tuesday's ballot. Called the
"great taxpayers' revolt" by its sup
porters, the initiative cuts property
taxes by two-thirds and will either,
depending on whose bumpersticker
you read, save the homeowner or
destroy local government. Equally
controversial is the legislature's al
ternative tax plan, Prop. 8.
Other propositions include Prop.
3, which would provide tax
exemptions for any property which
uses alternative energy sources such
as solar power, and Prop. 10, which
would allow home improvements to
be exempt from taxation for five
years.
