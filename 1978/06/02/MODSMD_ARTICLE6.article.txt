Propositions 8 and 13
In a close decision, we have decided to endorse Proposition
8 and to recommend a no vote on Proposition 13.
The reduction of property taxes is important, but Proposi
tion 13 will not permit the imposition of special local taxes
unless two-thirds of the voters approve. Most importantly,
Proposition 13's passage will make it extremely difficult to fund
vitally needed government services.
Proposition 8 is not a good bill by itself, but it's the politically
necessary alternative to Proposition 13. It will permit the flexi
bility in regard to taxes which Proposition 13 makes difficult, if
not impossible.
Governor's race
Democrat — Brown
For the Democratic governor's primary, we endorse Gov. Ed
mund Brown, Jr., who is without question the most competent
and qualified Democrat running in that race.
Republican — Maddy
Four candidates remain in the Republican governor's primary
race after state Sen. John Briggs withdrew. That leaves San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson and Fresno Assemblyman Ken
Maddy.
Wilson appears to be too dull to catch on with the voters.
Maddy's campaign has not doneall that well, either,yetwe feel
he offers the most hope of any Republican candidate. His
views are the most reasonable of the four candidates, and we
note in particular his stance against the Briggs initiative.
Maddy has also opposed Proposition 13.
Ed Davis, the former police chief of Los Angeles, at his best
impresses us as being Ronald Reagan without any actingcre
dits. His views on such issues as marijuana, capital punish
ment, and homosexuality would befine if California were 15th
century Spain, but it's not. We need not waste more newsprint
on his other views.
Attorney General EvelleVounger is, like Davis, alsounfortu
nately in the wrong place, time, and society. One need only
look at what Younger's office has done in his two terms as
attorney general to see why his political career should be
terminated. He has created and overseen an Organized Crime
and Criminal Intelligence Branch which has yet to claim credit
for the conviction of one major crime figure, but it has spent a
great deal of time and money performing surveillance of per
sons who just happen to have left-wing political views.
On an admittedly personal note, Younger's office has op
posed the Daily's lawsuit against Palo Alto police over the
search of our offices. Younger's office entered the case on the
side of police several years ago, and has shown great interest
in the matter since then.
An assistant attorney general told a federal appellate court
two years ago that newspapers, homes, and businesses should
be subject to unannounced police raids because "we don t
know who to trust" in California.
A deputy attorney general even went to Washington last
January to spend 20 minutes arguing to the Supreme Court
that the Daily's judgment must be reversed.
Briefs which Younger filed with the court aigued that, in
stead of handing anyone a subpoena requesting materials,
police should use a warrant and search the premises because
"by obtaining a search warrant the police insure that the pri
vacy rights of the individual (regarless of whether the person is
a defendant, suspect, or third party) are protected."
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court accepted Younger's
viewpoint Wednesday and ruled against the Daily. Not very
much can be done about the court, but something can be
done about Younger. Based on his record and his views, he
should be kept out of public office.
Anti-gay childishness
Americans have shown an unfortunate tendency through
out our history to blame without reason all their troubles on
some minority group. 17th-century New England persecuted
"witches"; German immigrants were vilified during World
War I; and, of course, McCarthyism tried to save us from "all
those Communists" during the early 19505.
Now it seems that Americans feel that homosexuality is a
danger to our society, and if we can get rid of gays — or at least
discriminate against them and criminally prosecute them —
we can make America a better place.
Citizens from Florida to Minnesota to Oregon have all voted
to repeal local ordinances protecting gays from discrimina
tion. Gays are apparently the "witches" of the 19705.
We find it appalling that citizens are deciding to single out
for punishment one group of people which chooses to live
differently than most, and are doing so out of fear and hysteria.
Laws which protect gays from discrimination will not destroy
America, just as other non-discrimination laws have not ruined
us. Anita Bryant and her ilk should stay in the orange groves,
and certain ministers should stay in their pulpits.
The California Secretary of State recently announced that
the Briggs initiative, which will permit the firing of public
school teachers simply because they are gay, has
received enough signatures to place it on the November bal
lot.
We hope Californians will realize the craziness of this initia
tive — which at best will probably just force gays to "stay in the
closet" — and defeat overwhelmingly the Briggs initiative.
The Briggs initiative will not make gays go away, nor will it
improve our society; it will, however, mandate the investiga
tion, harassment, and humiliation of gays and any one else
who is a school teacher.
Before we start "blacklisting" school teachers, voters
should at least realize how really ludicrous Briggs' proposal
would be in California, which has already intelligently re
formed its criminal laws to stop the prosecution of gays — and
San Francisco has an ordinance protecting gays from discrimi
nation.
We've had enough of this anti-gay childishness, which is
quickly becoming something more dangerous. Californians
should not have to look back twenty years from now and
realize how foolish and paranoid they were in 1978.

We hope Californians will realize the craziness of this initia
tive — which at best will probably just force gays to "stay in the
closet" — and defeat overwhelmingly the Briggs initiative.
The Briggs initiative will not make gays go away, nor will it
improve our society; it will, however, mandate the investiga
tion, harassment, and humiliation of gays and any one else
who is a school teacher.
Before we start "blacklisting" school teachers, voters
should at least realize how really ludicrous Briggs' proposal
would be in California, which has already intelligently re
formed its criminal laws to stop the prosecution of gays — and
San Francisco has an ordinance protecting gays from discrimi
nation.
We've had enough of this anti-gay childishness, which is
quickly becoming something more dangerous. Californians
should not have to look back twenty years from now and
realize how foolish and paranoid they were in 1978.
Propositions 8 and 13
In a close decision, we have decided to endorse Proposition
8 and to recommend a no vote on Proposition 13.
The reduction of property taxes is important, but Proposi
tion 13 will not permit the imposition of special local taxes
unless two-thirds of the voters approve. Most importantly,
Proposition 13's passage will make it extremely difficult to fund
vitally needed government services.
Proposition 8 is not a good bill by itself, but it's the politically
necessary alternative to Proposition 13. It will permit the flexi
bility in regard to taxes which Proposition 13 makes difficult, if
not impossible.
Governor's race
Democrat — Brown
For the Democratic governor's primary, we endorse Gov. Ed
mund Brown, Jr., who is without question the most competent
and qualified Democrat running in that race.
Republican — Maddy
Four candidates remain in the Republican governor's primary
race after state Sen. John Briggs withdrew. That leaves San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson and Fresno Assemblyman Ken
Maddy.
Wilson appears to be too dull to catch on with the voters.
Maddy's campaign has not doneall that well, either,yetwe feel
he offers the most hope of any Republican candidate. His
views are the most reasonable of the four candidates, and we
note in particular his stance against the Briggs initiative.
Maddy has also opposed Proposition 13.
Ed Davis, the former police chief of Los Angeles, at his best
impresses us as being Ronald Reagan without any actingcre
dits. His views on such issues as marijuana, capital punish
ment, and homosexuality would befine if California were 15th
century Spain, but it's not. We need not waste more newsprint
on his other views.
Attorney General EvelleVounger is, like Davis, alsounfortu
nately in the wrong place, time, and society. One need only
look at what Younger's office has done in his two terms as
attorney general to see why his political career should be
terminated. He has created and overseen an Organized Crime
and Criminal Intelligence Branch which has yet to claim credit
for the conviction of one major crime figure, but it has spent a
great deal of time and money performing surveillance of per
sons who just happen to have left-wing political views.
On an admittedly personal note, Younger's office has op
posed the Daily's lawsuit against Palo Alto police over the
search of our offices. Younger's office entered the case on the
side of police several years ago, and has shown great interest
in the matter since then.
An assistant attorney general told a federal appellate court
two years ago that newspapers, homes, and businesses should
be subject to unannounced police raids because "we don t
know who to trust" in California.
A deputy attorney general even went to Washington last
January to spend 20 minutes arguing to the Supreme Court
that the Daily's judgment must be reversed.
Briefs which Younger filed with the court aigued that, in
stead of handing anyone a subpoena requesting materials,
police should use a warrant and search the premises because
"by obtaining a search warrant the police insure that the pri
vacy rights of the individual (regarless of whether the person is
a defendant, suspect, or third party) are protected."
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court accepted Younger's
viewpoint Wednesday and ruled against the Daily. Not very
much can be done about the court, but something can be
done about Younger. Based on his record and his views, he
should be kept out of public office.
Anti-gay childishness
Americans have shown an unfortunate tendency through
out our history to blame without reason all their troubles on
some minority group. 17th-century New England persecuted
"witches"; German immigrants were vilified during World
War I; and, of course, McCarthyism tried to save us from "all
those Communists" during the early 19505.
Now it seems that Americans feel that homosexuality is a
danger to our society, and if we can get rid of gays — or at least
discriminate against them and criminally prosecute them —
we can make America a better place.
Citizens from Florida to Minnesota to Oregon have all voted
to repeal local ordinances protecting gays from discrimina
tion. Gays are apparently the "witches" of the 19705.
We find it appalling that citizens are deciding to single out
for punishment one group of people which chooses to live
differently than most, and are doing so out of fear and hysteria.
Laws which protect gays from discrimination will not destroy
America, just as other non-discrimination laws have not ruined
us. Anita Bryant and her ilk should stay in the orange groves,
and certain ministers should stay in their pulpits.
The California Secretary of State recently announced that
the Briggs initiative, which will permit the firing of public
school teachers simply because they are gay, has
received enough signatures to place it on the November bal
lot.
We hope Californians will realize the craziness of this initia
