## Letters to the 'Daily' editor 
### 
Native New Yorkers
Although I was relieved to dis
cover that someone had taken the
time to put down on paper what I
had been trying to explain to my
friends all year long, my friends
were both confused and annoyed
after reading Dan Harrison's article
(Daily, May 30).
Many had misinterpreted the
editorial solely as an attack on
California. I believe Harrison is at
tempting to convey the necessity for
open-mindedness with regard to re
gional cultures, whether they are
found in New York, Kansas City, or
Los Angeles.
As a native New Yorker I am con
stantly frustrated by the misconcep
tions about my home town, perpet
rated by such mediums as the San
Francisco Chronicle, KOVR evening
news and the movie, "The Out of
Towners."
This kind of attitude is reinforced
by a West coast chauvinism which
views all other lifestyles as inferior.
New York, as any urban center, is
not without its flaws. Crime, dirt and
noise do exist there. But one may
also find a genuine quality peculiar
to New York in its character, tradi
tions, and people.
This summer I am looking forward
to returning to a place that is very
special to me, and will probably re
main so, wherever I choose to live.
My advise to all Stanfordians: Co
East and take a look for yourself,

after all eight million people can't be
wrong.

Property is theft
"Taxation is theft" — according to
David Miller in the Daily, May 25.
No; property is theft!
Material values and goods have
been made, are made, and continue
to be made by people working to
gether. We all make more by coop
eration than any one of us could
claw out of the soil on their own.
There is no way to decide what piece
we now enjoy was made possible in
the past or what fraction of that
piece is due to the efforts of one
person in the present. All these
thingsand values belong to all of us.
If David Miller is able to end taxa
tion, who will pay the police that
now defend his property against
those who claim that part of it is the
fruit of their own labor? Who will
pay the military forces that secure
the flow of raw materials and
finished products to our shores for
him to enjoy? Who will train his
children to fit into this system? If he
has no children, who will train other
people's children to be subservient
to this system?
Can David Miller go it alone? I
doubt it. Practically everything he
eats, or uses, has been made by
people with differing moral values.

Even if he could figure out how to
plant one crop, I doubt he would
survive to harvest it without relying
on other people, and things they
have produced.
Most people living in our century
know, or have learned, that by work
ing together we can do better than
by working separately. But once we
start talking about property we end
up arguing and fighting over how to
get more for ourselves, or how to
make an uneasy alliance to rip off
some more distant group for our
own benefit.
These conflicts could stop if we
start from the idea that we all have
an equal share in what has been
made, and we would all have more
to share if we work together to make
more for all of us now.
Property, enforced by taxation
and police and armed force, takes
this possibility away from us. Prop
erty is theft — of our heritage from
the past, our share in the present,
our hope for the future.
Once we accept this idea as a sim
ple fact we can join together to
make more for all of us.

Palestinians correct coverage
During the past week, two omis
sions by the Daily have had the ef
fect of concealing important infor
mation from the Stanford commun
ity.
On Monday May 22, a rally was
held in support of Sami Esmail — an
American citizen of Palestinian des
cent recently arrested and impris
oned by the Israeli government. The
Daily's coverage of the rally, which
appeared Tuesday May 23, neg
lected to mention that Esmail is an
American citizen.
Consequently, readers of the arti
cle may have missed the unique na
ture of the case. There are many
Palestinian political prisoners in Is
rael, but one of the reasons Sami
Esmail's case has received wide sup
port in this country, is that he is

American born and a full citizen of
the U.S. Furthermore, he is being
tried for defending the political
rights of the Palestinians, an action
which is legal in the U.S. and pro
tected by the First Amendment.
In the second instance, the Daily
failed to give any coverage what
soever to a speech by Dr. Ibrahim
Abu-Lughod, professor of political
science at Northwestern University
and member of the Palestine Na
tional Council, the defacto parlia
ment of the Palestinian people and
the legislative body of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
Dr. Abu-Lughod's speech was of
considerable importance, as it was
the first time anyone formally af
filiated with the P.L.O. has spoken at
Stanford. Over 200 people attended
the speech, which was sponsored by
the Arab Students Association and
partially underwritten by the ASSU
Senate.
In his speech, Dr. Abu-Lughod
discussed the possibility of peace in
the Middle East without the partici
pation of the P.L.O. He started out
by stressing that the Palestinian
issue is the crux of the Middle East
conflict. He said that at the present
time, there are more countries in
the world that recognize the P.L.O.
than recognize Israel. This is not an
accident, he added, but the result of
the long dedication of the P.L.O. to
the Palestinians, who gave it the
legitimacy to be their sole represen
tative.
He concluded that although Pres
ident Carter's recognition of Palesti
nian rights is a step in the right di
rection, the necessity of involving
the P.L.O. in all peace efforts is the
minimum requirement for any
realistic progress towards peace.
Because of its complexity, the
conflict in the Middle East is one
which especially requires hearing all
points of view. We hope that in the
future, the Daily will make more of
an effort to put this point into prac
tice.

accident, he added, but the result of
the long dedication of the P.L.O. to
the Palestinians, who gave it the
legitimacy to be their sole represen
tative.
He concluded that although Pres
ident Carter's recognition of Palesti
nian rights is a step in the right di
rection, the necessity of involving
the P.L.O. in all peace efforts is the
minimum requirement for any
realistic progress towards peace.
Because of its complexity, the
conflict in the Middle East is one
which especially requires hearing all
points of view. We hope that in the
future, the Daily will make more of
an effort to put this point into prac

Native New Yorkers
Although I was relieved to dis
cover that someone had taken the
time to put down on paper what I
had been trying to explain to my
friends all year long, my friends
were both confused and annoyed
after reading Dan Harrison's article
(Daily, May 30).
Many had misinterpreted the
editorial solely as an attack on
California. I believe Harrison is at
tempting to convey the necessity for
open-mindedness with regard to re
gional cultures, whether they are
found in New York, Kansas City, or
Los Angeles.
As a native New Yorker I am con
stantly frustrated by the misconcep
tions about my home town, perpet
rated by such mediums as the San
Francisco Chronicle, KOVR evening
news and the movie, "The Out of
Towners."
This kind of attitude is reinforced
by a West coast chauvinism which
views all other lifestyles as inferior.
New York, as any urban center, is
not without its flaws. Crime, dirt and
noise do exist there. But one may
also find a genuine quality peculiar
to New York in its character, tradi
tions, and people.
This summer I am looking forward
to returning to a place that is very
special to me, and will probably re
main so, wherever I choose to live.
My advise to all Stanfordians: Co
East and take a look for yourself,

after all eight million people can't be
wrong.

Property is theft
"Taxation is theft" — according to
David Miller in the Daily, May 25.
No; property is theft!
Material values and goods have
been made, are made, and continue
to be made by people working to
gether. We all make more by coop
eration than any one of us could
claw out of the soil on their own.
There is no way to decide what piece
we now enjoy was made possible in
the past or what fraction of that
piece is due to the efforts of one
person in the present. All these
thingsand values belong to all of us.
If David Miller is able to end taxa
tion, who will pay the police that
now defend his property against
those who claim that part of it is the
fruit of their own labor? Who will
pay the military forces that secure
the flow of raw materials and
finished products to our shores for
him to enjoy? Who will train his
children to fit into this system? If he
has no children, who will train other
people's children to be subservient
to this system?
Can David Miller go it alone? I
doubt it. Practically everything he
eats, or uses, has been made by
people with differing moral values.

Even if he could figure out how to
plant one crop, I doubt he would
survive to harvest it without relying
on other people, and things they
have produced.
Most people living in our century
know, or have learned, that by work
ing together we can do better than
by working separately. But once we
start talking about property we end
up arguing and fighting over how to
get more for ourselves, or how to
make an uneasy alliance to rip off
some more distant group for our
own benefit.
These conflicts could stop if we
start from the idea that we all have
an equal share in what has been
made, and we would all have more
to share if we work together to make
more for all of us now.
Property, enforced by taxation
and police and armed force, takes
this possibility away from us. Prop
erty is theft — of our heritage from
the past, our share in the present,
our hope for the future.
Once we accept this idea as a sim
ple fact we can join together to
make more for all of us.

Palestinians correct coverage
During the past week, two omis
sions by the Daily have had the ef
fect of concealing important infor
mation from the Stanford commun
ity.
On Monday May 22, a rally was
held in support of Sami Esmail — an
American citizen of Palestinian des
cent recently arrested and impris
oned by the Israeli government. The
Daily's coverage of the rally, which
appeared Tuesday May 23, neg
lected to mention that Esmail is an
American citizen.
Consequently, readers of the arti
cle may have missed the unique na
ture of the case. There are many
Palestinian political prisoners in Is
rael, but one of the reasons Sami
Esmail's case has received wide sup
port in this country, is that he is

American born and a full citizen of
the U.S. Furthermore, he is being
tried for defending the political
rights of the Palestinians, an action
which is legal in the U.S. and pro
tected by the First Amendment.
In the second instance, the Daily
failed to give any coverage what
soever to a speech by Dr. Ibrahim
Abu-Lughod, professor of political
science at Northwestern University
and member of the Palestine Na
tional Council, the defacto parlia
ment of the Palestinian people and
the legislative body of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
Dr. Abu-Lughod's speech was of
considerable importance, as it was
the first time anyone formally af
filiated with the P.L.O. has spoken at
Stanford. Over 200 people attended
the speech, which was sponsored by
the Arab Students Association and
partially underwritten by the ASSU
Senate.
In his speech, Dr. Abu-Lughod
discussed the possibility of peace in
the Middle East without the partici
pation of the P.L.O. He started out
by stressing that the Palestinian
issue is the crux of the Middle East
conflict. He said that at the present
time, there are more countries in
the world that recognize the P.L.O.
than recognize Israel. This is not an
accident, he added, but the result of
the long dedication of the P.L.O. to
the Palestinians, who gave it the
legitimacy to be their sole represen
tative.
He concluded that although Pres
