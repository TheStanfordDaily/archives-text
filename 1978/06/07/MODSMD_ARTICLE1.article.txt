# Students linked to Chinatown melee
## 
### Bill Burger 
Several Taiwanese students here
were allegedly involved in a violent
fight during a May 20 demonstration
in San Francisco's Chinatown bet
ween supporters and opponents of
the Taiwanese government.
The demonstration was in protest
of the election of Chiang Ching-kuo
(Chiang Kai-shek's son) as Taiwan's
president.
The allegations were made by a
second group of Taiwanese stu
dents, which was part of the anti-
Chiang march and witnessed the in
cident.
Yeh Bing-hui, a graduate student
and social chairman of the Chinese

Students Association here, and Sun
Tei-new, another graduate student,
were both identified by the marchers
as having been involved in the fight
ing.
Both were identified to the Daily in
photographs of the incident pub
lished in The San Francisco Journal, a
Chinese-oriented newspaper pub
lishing both Chinese and English edi
tions.
According to the group alleging
the involvement of Yeh and Sun, the
fight broke out at 2 p.m. when the
200 to 300 demonstrators ap
proached the intersection of Clay
and Stockton streets near the head
quarters of the Taiwan-ruling

Kuomintang (KMT).
One member of the group said he
saw a gathering of about 20 people
on the Clay-Stockton corner "hold
ing five- to six-foot-long sticks."
Another Taiwanese studentsaid he
saw the group come out of the KMT
headquarters carrying sticks.
The first spokesman then said that
group "wedged" into the street to
block the route of the march. After
some verbal exchanges, the pro-
Chiang group "ran up and started
beating with sticks." He said the de
monstrators were then chased two
blocks down Clay Street to
Portsmouth Square where the march
began and where they were able to

"hold off" the "attackers."
The Journal reported that about 15
people were injured during the fight,
mainly with hand, face and head in
juries.
Teddy Kiang, a graduate student
from Taiwan who was present when
the incident occurred, saw things dif
ferently.
Kiang said he had been invited to a
"cocktail party celebrating the inau
guration" of Chiang and was walking
up Clay Street when the fight began.
He said "pro-Communists" started
the fight. He said he saw them carry
ing wooden sticks with red flags to
wards the KMT headquarters.

Several supporters of Taiwan's government approach a demonstrator during a
march through Chinatown on March 20. Several Taiwanese Stanford students
present at the incident have identified the man on the right as Yeh Bing-Hui, a
graduate student here and officer of the Chinese Students Association.
"They just looked like com
munists," he said.
Kiang said the demonstrators tried
to burn the Taiwanese flag in front of
the headquarters when people came
out of the building trying to "stop
them."
He said the demonstrators
"walked back" to Portsmouth
Square.
Kiang said Yeh was present when
the incident took place.
Asked whether Yeh could have
been photographed with a wooden
stick, Kiang said that was "probably
true," but added that the cir
cumstances surrounding the inci
dent must be taken into considera
tion.
Sun was identified in an unpub
lished photograph taken at the inci
dent standing next to Yeh and fight
ing with demonstrators.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he had heard nothing of
the incident. Lee Ziegler, director of
Bechtel International Center, said he
had heard about a disturbance dur
ing the march but knew nothing of
any student involvement in the inci
dent.
Both Yeh and Sun were unavaila
ble for comment yesterday. Yeh's
phone had been disconnected.
In a rally and march on May 27 in
Chinatown, the so-called "pro-KMT
initiated" fight was condemned by a
number of speakers. Several of the
demonstrators who were present the
week before, some of whom had
been injured, spoke at the rally.
There were more than 30 police

men in riot gear present to dissuade
further incidents.
When the marchers approached
KMT headquarters the police formed
a wall in front of the building while
the demonstrators chanted slogans.
The Taiwanese students who al
leged that Yeh and Sun were in
volved in the fighting have asked for
anonymity because of what they said
was the possibility of retaliation
against their families in Taiwan.
They urged the administration to
investigate their charges against stu
dents here who were allegedly in
volved and to "establish a University
policy forbidding admission as stu
dents . . . faculty and staff of agents
of foreign governments and to dis
courage surveillance, intimidation
and coercion of foreign nationals at
Stanford."

any student involvement in the inci

Both Yeh and Sun were unavaila
ble for comment yesterday. Yeh's
phone had been disconnected.
In a rally and march on May 27 in
Chinatown, the so-called "pro-KMT
initiated" fight was condemned by a
number of speakers. Several of the
demonstrators who were present the
week before, some of whom had
been injured, spoke at the rally.
There were more than 30 police

men in riot gear present to dissuade
further incidents.
When the marchers approached
KMT headquarters the police formed
a wall in front of the building while
the demonstrators chanted slogans.
The Taiwanese students who al
leged that Yeh and Sun were in
volved in the fighting have asked for
anonymity because of what they said
was the possibility of retaliation
against their families in Taiwan.
They urged the administration to
investigate their charges against stu
dents here who were allegedly in
volved and to "establish a University
policy forbidding admission as stu
dents . . . faculty and staff of agents
of foreign governments and to dis
courage surveillance, intimidation
and coercion of foreign nationals at
Stanford."
Several Taiwanese students here
were allegedly involved in a violent
fight during a May 20 demonstration
in San Francisco's Chinatown bet
ween supporters and opponents of
the Taiwanese government.
The demonstration was in protest
of the election of Chiang Ching-kuo
(Chiang Kai-shek's son) as Taiwan's
president.
The allegations were made by a
second group of Taiwanese stu
dents, which was part of the anti-
Chiang march and witnessed the in
cident.
Yeh Bing-hui, a graduate student
and social chairman of the Chinese

Students Association here, and Sun
Tei-new, another graduate student,
were both identified by the marchers
as having been involved in the fight
ing.
Both were identified to the Daily in
photographs of the incident pub
lished in The San Francisco Journal, a
Chinese-oriented newspaper pub
lishing both Chinese and English edi
tions.
According to the group alleging
the involvement of Yeh and Sun, the
fight broke out at 2 p.m. when the
200 to 300 demonstrators ap
proached the intersection of Clay
and Stockton streets near the head
quarters of the Taiwan-ruling

Kuomintang (KMT).
One member of the group said he
saw a gathering of about 20 people
on the Clay-Stockton corner "hold
ing five- to six-foot-long sticks."
Another Taiwanese studentsaid he
saw the group come out of the KMT
headquarters carrying sticks.
The first spokesman then said that
group "wedged" into the street to
block the route of the march. After
some verbal exchanges, the pro-
Chiang group "ran up and started
beating with sticks." He said the de
monstrators were then chased two
blocks down Clay Street to
Portsmouth Square where the march
began and where they were able to

"hold off" the "attackers."
The Journal reported that about 15
people were injured during the fight,
mainly with hand, face and head in
juries.
Teddy Kiang, a graduate student
from Taiwan who was present when
the incident occurred, saw things dif
ferently.
Kiang said he had been invited to a
"cocktail party celebrating the inau
guration" of Chiang and was walking
up Clay Street when the fight began.
He said "pro-Communists" started
the fight. He said he saw them carry
ing wooden sticks with red flags to
wards the KMT headquarters.

Several supporters of Taiwan's government approach a demonstrator during a
march through Chinatown on March 20. Several Taiwanese Stanford students
present at the incident have identified the man on the right as Yeh Bing-Hui, a
graduate student here and officer of the Chinese Students Association.
"They just looked like com
munists," he said.
Kiang said the demonstrators tried
to burn the Taiwanese flag in front of
the headquarters when people came
out of the building trying to "stop
them."
He said the demonstrators
"walked back" to Portsmouth
Square.
Kiang said Yeh was present when
the incident took place.
Asked whether Yeh could have
been photographed with a wooden
stick, Kiang said that was "probably
true," but added that the cir
cumstances surrounding the inci
dent must be taken into considera
tion.
Sun was identified in an unpub
lished photograph taken at the inci
dent standing next to Yeh and fight
ing with demonstrators.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he had heard nothing of
the incident. Lee Ziegler, director of
Bechtel International Center, said he
had heard about a disturbance dur
ing the march but knew nothing of
any student involvement in the inci
dent.
