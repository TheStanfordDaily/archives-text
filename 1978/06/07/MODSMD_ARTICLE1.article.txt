### Bill Burger 
Several Taiwanese students here
were allegedly involved in a violent
fight during a May 20 demonstration
in San Francisco's Chinatown bet
ween supporters and opponents of
the Taiwanese government.
The demonstration was in protest
of the election of Chiang Ching-kuo
(Chiang Kai-shek's son) as Taiwan's
president.
The allegations were made by a
second group of Taiwanese stu
dents, which was part of the anti-
Chiang march and witnessed the in
cident.
Yeh Bing-hui, a graduate student
and social chairman of the Chinese

Students Association here, and Sun
Tei-new, another graduate student,
were both identified by the marchers
as having been involved in the fight
ing.
Both were identified to the Daily in
photographs of the incident pub
lished in The San Francisco Journal, a
Chinese-oriented newspaper pub
lishing both Chinese and English edi
tions.
According to the group alleging
the involvement of Yeh and Sun, the
fight broke out at 2 p.m. when the
200 to 300 demonstrators ap
proached the intersection of Clay
and Stockton streets near the head
quarters of the Taiwan-ruling

Kuomintang (KMT).
One member of the group said he
saw a gathering of about 20 people
on the Clay-Stockton corner "hold
ing five- to six-foot-long sticks."
Another Taiwanese studentsaid he
saw the group come out of the KMT
headquarters carrying sticks.
The first spokesman then said that
group "wedged" into the street to
block the route of the march. After
some verbal exchanges, the pro-
Chiang group "ran up and started
beating with sticks." He said the de
monstrators were then chased two
blocks down Clay Street to
Portsmouth Square where the march
began and where they were able to

"hold off" the "attackers."
The Journal reported that about 15
people were injured during the fight,
mainly with hand, face and head in
juries.
Teddy Kiang, a graduate student
from Taiwan who was present when
the incident occurred, saw things dif
ferently.
Kiang said he had been invited to a
"cocktail party celebrating the inau
guration" of Chiang and was walking
up Clay Street when the fight began.
He said "pro-Communists" started
the fight. He said he saw them carry
ing wooden sticks with red flags to
wards the KMT headquarters.
