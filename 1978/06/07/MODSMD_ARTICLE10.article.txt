# Frustrations of the press over rape
## 
### 
Ansley

Several times this year I have been asked by
students "Why didn't you report that rape last
weekend/month/year? Are you trying to cover up
the danger of the campus?"
That's a frustrating question to hear, because
the answer is nearly always the same: "No one told
us about it."
And invariably, when I press for further details
so I can pursue the story, it turns out that my
questioner heard of the event third-hand, isn't
sure who was attacked or where it happened.
We check with the police. They say that no rapes
have been reported, that they'd tell us if they had
been.
The other groups on campus to which rapes are
occasionally reported — remain mum. Victims re
questing their help are granted confidentiality.
So the Daily is left with the uncomfortable feel
ing that this campus is not entirely as idyllic as it
appears, but that the newspaper has no way of
reporting that. If it did publish an unsubstantiated
report, the Daily could cause panic.
The only rape case we know of this school year

was an attack on a woman in Roble Hall last
November. If you know for certain of any other
incidents, at least report them, somehow, to the
police, so we know not to trust dark alleys so
much.
tt is understandable that some women might be
avoiding informing the police or us because they
fear the publicity and embarrassment accompany
ing a newspaper story.
Publicizing danger
To this I can only say that it is certainly not our
intention to let the whole world know which
woman has been attacked. But publicizing the
danger to women — or a description of the sus
pect — includes telling the world that a rape took
place.
Every case is handled differently, depending on
the situation involved, so I can not say with cer
tainty what facts will or will not be included in a
rape story.
But the woman's name, in general, won't be
printed in the original story. If her accused at
tacker is later caught and she presses charges, fair

reporting (of information that is public by then
anyway) includes printing the plaintiff's name
along with the defendant's.
By the way, the case of a homosexual attack on
Palm Drive last October presented a different
problem. We learned sketchy details of the event
soon after it occurred, but the police, when asked,
insisted that no rapes had been reported. So we
could publish nothing.
We learned a month later that the police did
know of the event, but had classified it as an as
sault and whited out even the basic details in the
report. So we ran the story one month late.
Maybe we're all wrong. Maybe this is the safest
University campus anywhere. Maybe we're wrong
to devote a page of the paper to a problem that
barely exists.
I wish we had some way of knowing if that's the
case.
