# 'Daily' columnist retracts Coors boycott opinion after meeting
## 
### 
For several months now, I've been
>oycotting Coors beer, and en
:ouraging my friends to do the same.
If anyone asked why I supported
he boycott, I had two reasons:
[!oors discriminates against gays and
ninorities, and Coors uses polyg
aph tests for hiring in which they ask
(ersonal questions they have no bus
ness asking.

Then, during rush, I found out that
suddenly Coors had a campus rep
resentative to promote their image.
It sounded to me like they were get
ting worried, and in view of the lack
of published material on the boycott,
it seemed like a good time to write a
column About Coors.
After the column was printed
(Daily, May 15), I was called by Coors

West, the local distributor. They
were very upset and asked me to
come in and talk to them about my
earlier column. I did, and I talked for
more than an hour with the president
and several other officers. I was also
given a great deal of literature to back
up their claims.
From what I know now, I'm afraid I
must retract my earlier column. The
bases for the boycott popularly cited
are not legitimate. Coors is worried
because the campaign waged against
them is based on misinformation.
Here are the facts as I now believe
them to be:
It is certainly true that Coors uses a
polygraph test in dealings with
employees. That alone is not reason
enough for a boycott, even though I
really dislike the practice, because
about 40 per cent of the Fortune 500
corporations also use polygraph
tests.
Use of polygraph
Coors uses the polygraph test in
two ways. One is in the grievance
process, where either side may re
quest a witness involved in a formal
hearing to take a polygraph test. No
one, however, is forced to take the
test.
The other way is in the application
process. There are no questions
about sexual preference, as is popu
larly rumored. There are, however,
questions about the use of drugs by
the applicant, and about the conce
alment of information about subver
sive or Communistic activities.
The question about drugs, though,
asks only if the applicant has ever
used drugs on the job. This is easily
justificable for safety reasons alone.
As for the question on Communism,
Coors is at best no worse than Local

-366 and the AFL-CIO itself. The AFL
CIO constitution is full of references
to the "undermining efforts" of
Communists, and ackowledged
Communists are banned from hold
ing executive office in the organiza
tion.
Other questions used in the poly
graph test are not really objectiona
able.
Discrimination charges
As for the discrimination charge,
Coors has been certified by the U.S.

opinions

government as an Equal Opportunity
Employer. It has observed a
federally-approved Affirmative Ac
tion program since 1972. As a matter
of fact, Coors has the best minority
and female hiring record of any major
company in the Rocky Mountain
area. Its work force includes 13 per
cent minorities and 17 per cent wo
men.
As of March 10,1978, Coors' Board
of Directors added the phrase "sex
ual preference" to the company's
Equal Employment Opportunity pol
icy. It is clear this action was a direct
result of the boycott, since several
gay organizations, including many in
San Francisco, were actively cam
paigning against Coors.
Examply set
Now, however, by taking such a
step, Coors has set the example for

the brewery industry with regards to
discrimination against gays. Several
gay organizations have ended their
boycott against Coors, including the
Houston Human Rights League.
Coors has never donated any
money to Anita Bryant or her "Save
Our Children" organization, nor has
it donated funds to any organizations
opposing passage of the ERA. The
company, according to a letter by
Joseph Coors, has decided to take no
position on the nature of gays, abor-

tion, and the ERA.
What about the strike itself, then?
The strike began in April of 1977, and
two weeks after the walkout, 53 per
cent of the 1472 who walked out re
turned to their jobs. N0w,71 percent
of those who were on strike have re
turned.
On April 19,1977, Coors proposed
that the all-union operation be
changed to open shop, so that those
employees who crossed their own
picket lines would not be fined or
suspended by the union. The union
demands either a union shop, or an
"agency shop," whereby those who
decide not to join the union must still
pay union fees.
Union demands
The union also demands that re
placement workers be fired, but
Coors refuses to do so, and further
proposes that striking workers be

reinstated only as jobs open up. They
will get preferential treatment
though.
The union also demands that
polygraph tests no longer be used in
the grievance procedure, but has ag
reed that the use of such tests in the
application process is not an issue.
It's clear that the issues separating
Coors and Local 366 are post-strike
issues. Just what started the strike is
unclear, but it had to do with senior
ity rights and the special work-

schedule Coors uses to keep its bre
wery open 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. It seems that this is no longer
an issue.
The important thing is that the
most commonly stated issues, the
use of the polygraph tests and dis
crimination in hiring, were not the
basis for the strike, and furthermore,
these charges are not substantiated.
The boycott has done some good,
from getting Coors to include "sex
ual preference" in its employment
policy, to just getting the company ot
become more aware of the commun
ity. The issues that still separate
Coors and Local 366, however, are
not really a matter for national con
cern. As far as I am concerned, the
boycott is over.
