# Rape at Stanford: prevention, problems discussed
## Palo Alto police study prevention and conviction in rape cases 
### 
Zurcher

The problem of sexual investigation is a
critical one. The crime rate for rape is in
creasing alarmingly and official rape statis
tics represent only a small portion of the
problem.
Although rapes tend to be both planned
and violent, few apprehended rapists are
even charged with and convicted of rape.
Even fewer are committed to institutions.
There is a higher acquittal rate for rape than
for any other felony in California. The
reasons for this failure to charge and convict
are clear. Social and legal attitudes about
rape have produced a web of formal and
informal restraints on the actions of police,
prosecutors, magistrates and juries which
hinder prosecutions for forcible rape.
In 1975, the Palo Alto Police Department
obtained a federally funded grant to conduct
a year-long study of sexual assault and the
criminal justice system response. The pur
pose was to improve the institutional re
sponse to the crime of rape. The result was a
24-hour training curriculum providing in
sight into the emotional impact of sexual
assault on victims, the circumstances of
rape, criminal justice and health agency per
sonnel perspectives on sexual assault, and
procedures for improving the institutional
response to victims and encouraging more
women to report.
The study produced some rather disturb
ing information. For exaijiple, one of the
issues cited as a problem in victims not re
porting rape is the treatment of victims by
the criminal justice system. This problem
has been played upon by the media, portray
ing the victim as being treated as though she
were the offender by the police. One of the
ways to encourage victims to report is to
dispel the negative image of the police re
sponse to rape victims.
Although two-thirds of the victims sur

veyed who came into contact with law en
forcement agencies and medical services
had positive experiences with those agen
cies, a sizable minority reported strongly
negative reactions. They felt unfairly ac
cused of negligence. There was considera
ble unhappiness with the length and nature
of the police interrogation immediately after
the assault and the number of times victims
were asked to repeat the complete account
of the rape.
The training program developed by the
Palo Alto Police Department is aimed at
creating change within all agencies which
have an involvement with rape victims. Al
though survey victims who had been raped
in Palo Alto were largely satisfied with the
department's response, procedures and
policies were changed or instituted to meet
the needs of all parties concerned with the
victim's emotional response as a primary
consideration.
An anonymous reporting line to the police
department was installed (329-2421). This
provides a means for any victim who does
not wish to be identified or to prosecute the
offender to, at least, advise the police of the
incident and other details which she may feel
are important to assist in identifying the of
fender and preventing similar attacks.
Reporting the crime
For those victims who wish to report the
crime, initial victim contact will usually be
made by a patrol officer. This officer will
determine the nature of the crime, assist the
victim in obtaining medical treatment if
necessary, and provide information regard
ing possible immediate apprehension of the
offender. Although the responding officer
may be male or female, the victim is then
given the choice of talking with an officer of
either sex.
Once this decision is made, the investigat

ing officer will take some procedural steps to
preserve physical evidence and contact a
friend or relative of the victim if she wishes
to have someone present for support. If the
victim is in need of immediate medical atten
tion, she will be transported to the Stanford
Hospital Emergency Room. If this treatment
is not required, as soon as the on-scene in
vestigation allows, the victim and officer will
proceed to the emergency room for an
examination of the victim and collection of
medical evidence.
The examination may be conducted by the
hospital staff or, upon request, by the vic
tim's private physician. The expense of the
examination and evidence collection is
borne by the county. Although state law
does not require corroboration of the vic
tim's testimony, the evidence which may be
collected from the victim's body by the
physician can be crucial for a successful pro
secution of the rapist.
Follow-up investigation
A follow-up investigator will be contacted
and may meet with the victim at the scene,
hospital, or other location depending upon
the circumstances. Again, the victim may
control the decision to assign a male or
female investigator to the case. If the contact
between the victim and investigator does
not occur immediately, it will occur the next
morning. At that time a detailed statement
regarding the crime will be obtained from
the victim.
•The purpose for delay in questioning the
victim is to allow her to regain control of her
emotions, refresh her memory of events and
descriptions and reduce the number of
times she is required to describe the attack.
Of course, if she wishes, she may relate the
story to the first officer she contacts.
Because the psychological effects of rape
are usually far more severe than in other

crimes, even in other serious crimes of vio
lence, police officers must pay special atten
tion to the emotional responses and needs
of victims. In addition to the routine
investigation-oriented needs, there are
victim-oriented duties for the police which
help set the tone of the victim's attitude to
ward authorities. If these needs are met,
there is a greater likelihood of the victim
remaining within the system and developing
into a strong witness.
Immediate attention
These duties include providing immediate
medical attention and insuring that the vic
tim is informed and treated for the possibil
ity of venereal disease and pregnancy. The
victim is informed of counseling re
sources, criminal justice system functions
and procedures and assigned a guide or con
tact person within the department. This per
son will keep the victim informed through
out the progress of her case.
Although the report of the attack does not
guarantee that the rapist will be ap
prehended or that the victim will have her
day in court, research results indicate that
those victims who reported the incident to
the police achieved emotional recovery
from the rape trauma sooner than non
reporting victims. Apparently, most victims
receive a positive feeling from taking action
to stop or punish the persons responsible
for the attacks, regardless of the outcome of
the case.
If the offender is identified, the case will
be presented to the district attorney's office
for review. If the investigation has produced
a case which in the opinion of the district
attorney is strong enough to warrant charg
ing and trying the accused for rape then the
case will go to court. Rape can be a particu
larly difficult charge to prove to a jury be
cause of social attitudes toward the crime,

legal requirements and the frequent lack of
corroborative evidence.
Testifying easier
The victim will be required to testify, but
the reality is that the plight of rape victims
has improved considerably during recent
years. Questions pertaining to the victim's
prior sexual history are no longer permitted
without an in camera (closed) showing of
relevancy and the scope of cross examina
tion is strictly limited. The infamous
"cautionary instruction" which was one of
the central and unique facts of rape trials
may no longer be given.
Formerly, the judge was required to in
struct the jury that it must examine the vic
tim's testimony with caution. This instruc
tion has been held to be no longer relevant
to society by the California Supreme Court.
The Palo Alto Police Department requires
that all officers complete rape investigation
training incorporating the techniques,
policies and philosophies which have been
described. The course has been certified by
the California State Commission on Peace
Officer Standards and Training.
In addition, personnel from other criminal
justice system agencies such as probation
officers and prosecutors, and special in
terest groups, including the National Or
ganization for Women, Women Against
Rape, YWCA, American Red Cross and men
tal health professionals participate in the
training. This provides valuable cross
training, increased information regarding
procedures and policies and enhances
coordination between the criminal justice
agencies themselves and groups committed
to improving the lot of the rape victim and
attacking the crime of rape.

creasing alarmingly and official rape statis
tics represent only a small portion of the
problem.
Although rapes tend to be both planned
and violent, few apprehended rapists are
even charged with and convicted of rape.
Even fewer are committed to institutions.
There is a higher acquittal rate for rape than
for any other felony in California. The
reasons for this failure to charge and convict
are clear. Social and legal attitudes about
rape have produced a web of formal and
informal restraints on the actions of police,
prosecutors, magistrates and juries which
hinder prosecutions for forcible rape.
In 1975, the Palo Alto Police Department
obtained a federally funded grant to conduct
a year-long study of sexual assault and the
criminal justice system response. The pur
pose was to improve the institutional re
sponse to the crime of rape. The result was a
24-hour training curriculum providing in
sight into the emotional impact of sexual
assault on victims, the circumstances of
rape, criminal justice and health agency per
sonnel perspectives on sexual assault, and
procedures for improving the institutional
response to victims and encouraging more
women to report.
The study produced some rather disturb
ing information. For exaijiple, one of the
issues cited as a problem in victims not re
porting rape is the treatment of victims by
the criminal justice system. This problem
has been played upon by the media, portray
ing the victim as being treated as though she
were the offender by the police. One of the
ways to encourage victims to report is to
dispel the negative image of the police re
sponse to rape victims.
Although two-thirds of the victims sur

veyed who came into contact with law en
forcement agencies and medical services
had positive experiences with those agen
cies, a sizable minority reported strongly
negative reactions. They felt unfairly ac
cused of negligence. There was considera
ble unhappiness with the length and nature
of the police interrogation immediately after
the assault and the number of times victims
were asked to repeat the complete account
of the rape.
The training program developed by the
Palo Alto Police Department is aimed at
creating change within all agencies which
have an involvement with rape victims. Al
though survey victims who had been raped
in Palo Alto were largely satisfied with the
department's response, procedures and
policies were changed or instituted to meet
the needs of all parties concerned with the
victim's emotional response as a primary
consideration.
An anonymous reporting line to the police
department was installed (329-2421). This
provides a means for any victim who does
not wish to be identified or to prosecute the
offender to, at least, advise the police of the
incident and other details which she may feel
are important to assist in identifying the of
fender and preventing similar attacks.
Reporting the crime
For those victims who wish to report the
crime, initial victim contact will usually be
made by a patrol officer. This officer will
determine the nature of the crime, assist the
victim in obtaining medical treatment if
necessary, and provide information regard
ing possible immediate apprehension of the
offender. Although the responding officer
may be male or female, the victim is then
given the choice of talking with an officer of
either sex.
Once this decision is made, the investigat

ing officer will take some procedural steps to
preserve physical evidence and contact a
friend or relative of the victim if she wishes
to have someone present for support. If the
victim is in need of immediate medical atten
tion, she will be transported to the Stanford
Hospital Emergency Room. If this treatment
is not required, as soon as the on-scene in
vestigation allows, the victim and officer will
proceed to the emergency room for an
examination of the victim and collection of
medical evidence.
The examination may be conducted by the
hospital staff or, upon request, by the vic
tim's private physician. The expense of the
examination and evidence collection is
borne by the county. Although state law
does not require corroboration of the vic
tim's testimony, the evidence which may be
collected from the victim's body by the
physician can be crucial for a successful pro
secution of the rapist.
Follow-up investigation
A follow-up investigator will be contacted
and may meet with the victim at the scene,
hospital, or other location depending upon
the circumstances. Again, the victim may
control the decision to assign a male or
female investigator to the case. If the contact
between the victim and investigator does
not occur immediately, it will occur the next
morning. At that time a detailed statement
regarding the crime will be obtained from
the victim.
•The purpose for delay in questioning the
victim is to allow her to regain control of her
emotions, refresh her memory of events and
descriptions and reduce the number of
times she is required to describe the attack.
Of course, if she wishes, she may relate the
story to the first officer she contacts.
Because the psychological effects of rape
are usually far more severe than in other

crimes, even in other serious crimes of vio
lence, police officers must pay special atten
tion to the emotional responses and needs
of victims. In addition to the routine
investigation-oriented needs, there are
victim-oriented duties for the police which
help set the tone of the victim's attitude to
ward authorities. If these needs are met,
there is a greater likelihood of the victim
remaining within the system and developing
into a strong witness.
Immediate attention
These duties include providing immediate
medical attention and insuring that the vic
tim is informed and treated for the possibil
ity of venereal disease and pregnancy. The
victim is informed of counseling re
sources, criminal justice system functions
and procedures and assigned a guide or con
tact person within the department. This per
son will keep the victim informed through
out the progress of her case.
Although the report of the attack does not
guarantee that the rapist will be ap
prehended or that the victim will have her
day in court, research results indicate that
those victims who reported the incident to
the police achieved emotional recovery
from the rape trauma sooner than non
reporting victims. Apparently, most victims
receive a positive feeling from taking action
to stop or punish the persons responsible
for the attacks, regardless of the outcome of
the case.
If the offender is identified, the case will
be presented to the district attorney's office
for review. If the investigation has produced
a case which in the opinion of the district
attorney is strong enough to warrant charg
ing and trying the accused for rape then the
case will go to court. Rape can be a particu
larly difficult charge to prove to a jury be
cause of social attitudes toward the crime,

legal requirements and the frequent lack of
corroborative evidence.
Testifying easier
The victim will be required to testify, but
the reality is that the plight of rape victims
has improved considerably during recent
years. Questions pertaining to the victim's
prior sexual history are no longer permitted
without an in camera (closed) showing of
relevancy and the scope of cross examina
tion is strictly limited. The infamous
"cautionary instruction" which was one of
the central and unique facts of rape trials
may no longer be given.
Formerly, the judge was required to in
struct the jury that it must examine the vic
tim's testimony with caution. This instruc
tion has been held to be no longer relevant
to society by the California Supreme Court.
The Palo Alto Police Department requires
that all officers complete rape investigation
training incorporating the techniques,
policies and philosophies which have been
described. The course has been certified by
the California State Commission on Peace
Officer Standards and Training.
In addition, personnel from other criminal
justice system agencies such as probation
officers and prosecutors, and special in
terest groups, including the National Or
ganization for Women, Women Against
Rape, YWCA, American Red Cross and men
tal health professionals participate in the
training. This provides valuable cross
training, increased information regarding
procedures and policies and enhances
coordination between the criminal justice
agencies themselves and groups committed
to improving the lot of the rape victim and
attacking the crime of rape.
