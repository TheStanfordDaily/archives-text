Over the past few years, the Stanford Emergency De
partment has developed a program to better deal with
victims of a sexual assault. The program was developed
as a result of studies done by the Palo Alto Police De
partment in conjunction with othercommunityagencies
and Stanford Hospital. The staff has attended educa
tional programs to obtain the necessary skills and infor
mation for the evaluation and comfort of victims of such
assault. When someone who has been a victim of such
an assault comes to the Emergency Department, she,
and occasionally he, is immediately taken to a private
treatment room.
A nurse alwaysaccompanies the patientand stays with
the patient to provide emotional support. The nurse
responsible for thfe patient offers the patient the oppor
tunity of having a friend or relative join her in the treat
ment room. The nurse is also responsible for calling the
local "Woman Against Rape" organization if the patient
so wishes. At all times the patient is kept aware that
confidentiality is maintained and that the patient's
wishes are respected.
The police department, if not already involved, is only
involved if the patient gives permission. The patient is
fully informed about the proposed medical examina
tion, including information about tests that will be run to
rule out venereal disease and pregnancy. We explain the
kinds of medications that can be given to treat these
venereal diseases and to prevent pregnancy, and it is
explained to the patient why certain procedures are

carried out to gather legal information to assist the
police.
After the patient evaluation and treatment plan is
completed, arrangements are made for the patient to be
taken home by a friend or relative. Clothes are provided
if they are needed and brochures and literature contain
ing information about available community resources
are given to the patient. A follow-up visit is arranged for
the patient with her private physician, or with physicians
in the Stanford University Clinics, depending on the
patient's preference. We encourage patients to consider
utilizing psychiatric services and we facilitate this by
making appointments if the patients so desire.
When victims of sexual assault are under 18 years of
age the Pediatric Department takes primary responsibil
ity for the patient in the Emergency Department and
uses gynecological consultation as needed.
Patients are made aware of the legislation in California
which provides funds forevaluation and care to "Victims
of Violent Crimes."
I and my staff are particularly interested in receiving
information from the community about our perfor
mance. We are available at any time to discuss particular
incidents in strict confidence. We are available to serve
the community and can only improve our performance if
people bring shortcomings to our attention.
