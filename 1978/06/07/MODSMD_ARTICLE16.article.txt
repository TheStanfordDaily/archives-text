Rape is a topic which very few people can discuss with
objectivity. Certain assumptions can be made; for
example, no one takes a position in favor of it.
The issue of what constitutes rape is harder on which
to reach agreement. Victims have been made to feel guilty
for "inviting" rape, not successfully fighting the rapist
off, not being fully cooperative with police during ques
tioning or for not pressing charges against an identifi
able attacker. Sometimes the worst punishment to the
victim is the one she applies to herself; "how could I
have been so stupid," etc.
This year there has been a very active and effective
attempt to deal with the need for educational measures
that could help to minimize the risk of rape on the
Stanford campus or elsewhere.
A University-wide committee involving representa
tives from Cowell Student Health, Counseling and
Psychological Service, Police Services, Residential Edu
cation and Council of Presidents met several times in the
fall to discuss the issue of safety on campus.
During the winter quarter, an all day training work
shop was held for male and female members of the
student body, staff and faculty to train facilitators for
group discussion on rape issues. This initial group of
leaders have since been active in outreach programs to
various dorrns and fraternities. A second group of
facilitators received training spring quarter and the re
quest for their services continues.
An excellent booklet, Working Against Rape which

was published by a group of students has been widely
distributed.
If a rape occurs, the various services that would be
involved have tried to be sensitive and responsive to the
needs of the victim. Since there is only one female police
officer who is on day duty, a group of women staff
members of Counseling and Psychological Service have
agreed to be available to women who have been victims
of assault and want a woman to be present should an
attack occur at night. Thus far, this service has been used
twice.
Mary Morimoto in writing her column showed real
courage and social concern for other Stanford students.
In trying to overcome her returning fears, something
she described so well as the "psychological aftermath"
of a rape attempt, she illustrated one of the reasons one
cannot talk of the seriousness of rape in numbers only.
Two or three victims may continue to pay a psychologi
cal price, yet people may only be impressed with the
seriousness of the problem if many more attacks are
reported.
I feel some positive administrative action had already
been taken prior to Morimoto's experience. With her
cooperation, more specific complaints were channeled
to the appropriate people involved. We will all benefit
from some changes that resulted from her open and
constructive response.
