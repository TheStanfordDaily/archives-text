# Methods for dealing with sexual harassment outlined
## 
### 
The University has recently moved to simplify
the methods used in dealing with cases of sexual
harassment on the job and in the classroom.
Although only about three cases of harass
ment involving professors, students or staff
members are reported each year, Assistant
Dean of Students Leah Kaplan said, "It's impor
tant to be responsive and avoid the cumber
some, indirect procedures used at some other
universities."
She said harassment isn't as often a sexual
problem as it is an exploitation of power. "Fa<
culty should not be in a position to give grades,
grants or recommendations if they have a per
sonal relationship with students," she said.
Cutting red tape
Cutting the red tape in this case, means refer
ring students with complaints to Kaplan and
sending staff and faculty members with com
plaints to John Goheen, University om
budsman. If either of them encounter difficul
ties resolving a complaint, they can then refer it
to Provost William Miller.
According to Goheen, most of the victims of
harassment are women. "A typical case would
be a male staff member attracted to a young
woman student who doesn't want the attention.
The purpose of the procedures is to let them
know where they can go to get help."
"If people are happy with what they're doing,
that's no problem," said Kaplan. "What we're

concerned about is when someone is pressured
into something they don't want to do.
More expected
"For example, a female graduate student ap
plying for a teaching assistant position a few
years ago found that more was expected of her
than just being a TA. When I talked to the faculty
member about it, he confirmed her allegations,
but he didn't see any problems with it. He felt it
was all right since she was over 21."
There have also been cases involving women
instructors, she said. "One female faculty
member told me a male grad student had been
making advances. But it was nothing she
couldn't handle."
Three months
The plan has now been in effect for about
three months, Kaplan said. "The women I know
about have been helped by this procedure."
Previously, the lack of an established plan had
led to confusion, ineffectiveness and too many
persons being involved in the solution.
Kaplan said she's trying to avoid the cumber
some, many-layered routes used at Harvard and
Vale. Women students at Yale last year filed a
class action suit based on sexual harassment
against the school.
"It took a lot of stamina from the person lodg
ing the complaint, and there were confidential
ity problems," Kaplan said. "We want to avoid
that here."
