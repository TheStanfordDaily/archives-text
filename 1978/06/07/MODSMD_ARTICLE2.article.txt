Arbitrator Francis Walsh ruled Fri
day that all picketing by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) is prohi
bited under the terms of its collective
bargaining agreement with the Uni
versity.
The decision was the result of a
University complaint against picket
ing by USE at Encina Hall and Old
Pavilion in January, 1976. Picketing
occurred for three days while a grie
vance filed by William Reynolds,
then USE assistant president, was
being processed.
According to Walsh's ruling, all
employees represented by USE must
refrain from picketing until Aug. 31,
1979, or they will be in direct viola
tion of the University contract which
allows for collective bargaining
(grievances) instead of strikes.

The current contract expires in
1979.
Bob Britton, president of USE, said
he felt this decision was an infringe
ment on rights guaranteed by the
U.S. Constitution.
"It (the decision) ignored First
Amendment rights," he said. "The
question is: does an individual
worker have the right to carry a sign
on a stick?
"Also, the University is blocking,
in several ways, our grievances," he
said. "Therefore, we theoretically
have no obligation to fulfill our part
of the contract."
Rob Parker, University director of
personnel, said he was happy with
the decision but said that since he
hadn't seen the full report he was
unable to Comment further.
