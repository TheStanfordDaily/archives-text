# Blacks quiz Lyman on low enrollment
## 
### Ellie Lanza 
About 25 students gathered outside President Richard Ly
man's office last Thursday morning to express the black
community's concern for the University's commitment to
black studies and black enrollment.
"The thing that is most worrisome to me of all is the decline
in graduate enrollment of black students," Lyman said. He
added he realizes that if there isn't a certain minimum
number of black students in the professional schools black
students will be discouraged from coming here.
A joint letter from Black Student Union (BSU) President
Diane Burbie and Co-President Keith Archuleta was read to
Lyman, stating that they fail to see "substantial reality" to the
University's claim of "no erosion of commitment on its part."
The letter questions the University's degree of commit
ment to "the needs of the black community at Stanford." It
cites the financial cutback of black programs, the denial of
tenure to Food Research Asst. Prof. Tetteh Kofi, a new staff
grievance procedures and the University's investment policy
in South Africa.
"The black community is duly prepared to take an adament
stand on the issues," the letter stated. "The situation is
serious and merits your prompt attention." The students
requested that all University administrators work to maintain
black students here.
"You personally may have a commitment to the black
community, but that commitment means nothing if other
University administrators do not/' the letter stated.
"I believe I have the same commitment now that I had 10
years ago," Lyman said.
"Ten years ago, as now, I believed that American society
could not progress unless those ethinic groups who have
been almost completely excluded from opportunities in pro
fessions, leadership positions and places in government
were included," he said.
