# Students push SWOPSI, SCIRE
## 
### Mac Funk 
For many students, Univer
sity life is an unending barrage
of acronyms like SWOPSI,
SCIRE, ARLO, UGS and
LSJUMB. But there is a definite
quality unique to each prog
ram and it is because of this
that the co-directors of the
Stanford Center for Innovation
in Research and Education
(SCIRE) and the Stanford
Workshop on Political and So
cial Issues (SWOPSI) plan to
educate students on the vast
opportunities available to
them through their respective
programs.
The main function of SCIRE,
according to co-director Joan
Harrington, is not "harboring
ideas and innovations, but
providing students with a re
source center through which
they can implement ideas."
SCIRE has "funds, energy, gui
dance and academic credit" for
the student who has a desire to
see such implementation.
Funds for implementation
are provided by SCIRE's $4000
Innovation Fund, through
which projects such as New Di
rections newsletter and Au
rora, a feminist newspaper,
have been started, Harrington
said.
Harrington said SCIRE is

"identity-less," the center
does not house any program
and is only a point of "spin
off." Harrington added that
this causes problems because
students use a specific class or
workshop to remember a prog
ram. But student interest in
SCIRE is essential, since the
program is directed for and by
students, he said.
The "heart of SWOPSI," ac
cording to co-director Lisa Fos
ter, is the workshop program,
designed to actively involve
students in political and social
issues. The workshops utilize
both class time and time spent
in the community to learn
about the issue by first-hand
experience. Thus, students are
given the opportunity to apply
their classroom learning to
ward changing some of the
problems of today's world.
SWOPSI has also recently
begun sponsoring and co
sponsoring public events, in
tended to educate students on
various political issues. Often
the public events arise as ac
tion projects of SWOPSI work
shops. The workshops them
selves are often headed by a
graduate or undergraduate
student, with a faculty spon
sor, who, according to Foster,
often takes an active interest in

the course but does not teach
or lead the workshop.
Next year's goals for both
SCIRE and SWOPSI are to im
prove relations with sponsors
and faculty and to increase
student awareness of the pre
sence of the programs.
Harrington and Foster also
said they wanted to better pub
licize SCIRE and SWOPSI, in
cluding dorm and house pre
sentations of .the findings of
the various programs.
Harrington and Foster ex
pressed concern regarding a
"nationwide return to funda
mentals," which they fear may
occur at the expense of prog
rams such as SCIRE and
SWOPSI, which emphasize
newer approaches to educa
tion. However, both said they
felt the faculty has a strong
commitment to the programs,
and they see no danger of the
programs being curtailed or
canceled.
SCIRE and SWOPSI are re
viewed by the University every
three years to assure their
legitimacy as accredited prog
rams, but so far the renewal of
the programs has never been
in question. The only problem,
according to Foster, is misun
derstanding. She said she felt

that the faculty does not know
enough about the programs
and docs not approach them
from the "right perspective."
Another obstacle which the
programs are attempting to
overcome is their reputation as
"micks," or easy courses. Fos
ter commented that students
in general think of work only as
doing papers and taking
exams. She said the workshops
require definite time commit
ment and students enrolled
spend more time actually
learning than they do in other
courses.
