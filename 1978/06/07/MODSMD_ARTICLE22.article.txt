# SCRIP 'proud' of year's actions
## 
### Joel Dickholtz News analysis 
This year's campus movement against
American corporate presence in South Af
rica was much less dramatic than last
year's. Rallies, protests and demonstra
tions here generally involved fewer
people, and there were no protest-related
arrests, as compared to the mass arrest of
294 students last May."
The Board of Trustees' proxy decisions
did, however, show the effects of pressure
from the Stanford community.
"I think that SCRIP (Stanford Committee
for Responsible Investment Policy) and
SCRIP'S supporters can be proud of their
achievements this year," said Maggie
Goud, SCRIP spokesperson.
"Im sure that the trustees would be
forced to admit that if it hadn't been forthe
student movement, it would never have
occurred to them (the trustees) to vote
'yes' on any proxies."
Although the number of protesters has

decreased since last year, Coud said, "the
issue this year is much more concerted
and thoughtful, but much less emotional.
But in no way is it a dying issue.
"There's more support — or I should say
more informed support — of the South
African movement than before. But the
tactics have changed, although the goals
are basically the same. People are working
in different ways than getting arrested."
Goud attributes this change in attitute to
the fact that South Africa is not "a new
issue anymore. When people first started
learning about apartheid last year their reac
tion was 'Oh my God! I'm going to do
something about it.'
"Now we're realizing that South Africa is
very far from people s lives in general, so it
lacks the emotion. But it's still a strong,
sustained, well thought-out movement.
The things happening don't make big
headlines, but they do show progress."
She also said divestment was not the
major thrust of this spring's movement

because "the mood on campus wasn't for
divestment. We've emphasized the idea of
withdrawal, the more basic issue. As
people learn more about it they realize the
need for withdrawal, and divestment then
becomes a more legitimate alternative."
She added that next year's movement
would be similar to this year's, and will be
aimed at reaching incoming students.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president of
public affairs, said he felt the trustees'vot
ing change could be indirectly attributed
to list year's movement.
"From the student activity came a re
vised investment policy, and that policy
was what determined the trustees' votes,"
Rosenzweig said. "The key event was the
revision of the investment guidelines."
He attributed the decline in "student
involvement — and by that I don't mean a
lack of student support of approval — to
changes within the system, such as the
investment policy and the development of
the Commission on Investment Responsi
bility.
