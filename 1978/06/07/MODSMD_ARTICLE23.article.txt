# Soviets possibly spying under guise of students

Soviet spies possibly enrol
led in "colleges such as Stan
ford University" conduct in
dustrial espionage in local
electronic businesses, accord
ing to Palo Alto magazine Elec
tronic Warfare/Defense Elec
tronics.
The story, written by Richard
Davis, was published May 19
after two months of investiga
tion, according to the
magazine's senior editor,
Richard Hartman.
Hartman said an FBI source
told him "the agents register in
colleges such as Stanford Uni
versity, get jobs with integ
rated circuit manufacturers,
then transmit information to
the Soviet consulate" in San
Francisco.
"We didn't say that," argued
Roy McKinnon, chief of the San
Francisco FBI office.
McKinnon said he may have
told Hartman that keeping
track of all Soviets in the area,
including "many Soviet
student-exchange people as
well as thousands of USSR
seamen, has compounded the
problems of investigation.
"The possibility exists that
some (Soviets) may be in
volved in counterintelligence.
We must also consider the stu
dents," he added.
The University had less than
10 exchange students from the
Soviet Union, Hungary and Po
land this year, said A. Lee
Zeigler, director of Bechtel In
ternational Center.
Some are post-doctoral
scholars and the rest are
"non-degree students," he
said. "All of them are official
exchange students . . . we've
always had a few."
According to the magazine's
"informed sources," spying is
now occurring in the Santa
Clara Valley "wherea daily data
dump is made to orbiting
Soviet satellites and where

KGB (Soviet secret police)
agents have been conducting
industrial espionage for sev
eral years.
The article also stated that
the FBI estimated there are 50
KGB colonels in the "Silicon
Valley," a nickname for the
Santa Clara Valley because of
its electronic semiconductor
industries.
Hartman said he has revised
that number to 32, based on
information received from an
FBI source after the article's
publication.
McKinnon denied that the
FBI issued any specific estimate
for the valley.
He told the Palo Alto Times,
"History has shown approxi
mately 35 per cent of Soviet of
ficials in the United Mates an

intelligence-affiliated. The
Sunnyvale area, especially the
Sunnyvale research and de
velopment corporations,
would be a logical target for
these people."
The article theorized Soviet
agents are tapping long
distance, microwave
transmitted telephone conver
sations of electronics industry
officials.
The Palo Afto Times added
no evidence or cases were
cited to back up the charges of
spying.
San Francisco television
station KQED reported three
months ago that the top floor
of the Soviet Consulate in San
Francisco contained equip
ment designed to intercept
microwave signals.
