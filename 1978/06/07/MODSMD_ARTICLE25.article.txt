# CRIS program moves to Hoover
## 
### Andrea James 
The Center for Research in
International Studies (CRIS) is
joining the research-oriented
Hoover Institution in the Lou
Henry Hoover Building.
According To Political Sci
ence Prof. Robert direc
tor of CRIS, the center, which
"neither teaches nor does re
search" has begun moving into
its new quarters.
This year CRIS was located in
Rogers House, on the Row.
The sociology department will

move there next year because
the corner of the Quad where
it is now located will undergo
renovation.
The purpose of CRIS is to
"facilitate the teaching of in
ternational studies in all educa
tional institutions," Ward said.
CRIS currently directs the Af
rican, Latin American, East
Asian and Russian and East
European area programs at the
University. It also operates the
interdisciplinary programs of
Arms Control and Security,
U.S.-Japan Relations and
U.S.-China Relations.
Binational research
These last two programs
mainly deal with "binational
research," Ward said. "For
example, persons involved in
these programs are advising on
the Korean situation and the
plan to gradually remove
American troops."
But Ward emphasized that
the 18 persons involved with
CRIS are not interested primar
ily in research or in teaching
but in "providing the materials
and encouragement for
facilitating international edu
cation."
In an attempt to popularize
international education, sev
eral outreach programs have
been instituted. The first of th
ese, the Bay Area China Educa
tion Program (BACEP) was
started in the early 19705.
"We work with teachers in
the San Francisco-East Bay area
in trying to develop interna
tional education programs in

high schools and, though less
so, in primary levels," Ward
said.
Successful
The program was so success
ful that CRIS later initiated
Japanese, Latin American and
African equivalents of BACEP.
"We provide bibliographies
and ideas for introductory
courses to any interested
school district," Ward
explained. "Its amazing how
little international education
teachers have. Less than one in
five teachers are experienced
in this field."
CRIS also works at a col
legiate level. In the Earmark
program, Stanford works

closely with UC-Berkeley and
San lose State University to de
sign East Asian programs in 10
or 12 other colleges in the Bay
Area, Ward said.
"We also work on the inter
national education curriculum
at Stanford,'' Ward said. "The
IR (International Relations)
major, designed about two
years ago, was directed by this
office until it became 'ma
ture.' "
Ward is a "great sym
pathizer" of the Western Cul
ture requirement, but said he
believes there should have
been a more non-western con
tent included in the course
sequence.
