### Susan Larsen 
Diploma Services Company, which sold reproductions of dip
lomas from Stanford and other universities, has agreed to cease
its operations in exchange for the dismissal of the consumer
fraud case against it.
The company, based in Marina del Rey, was charged with
selling some of its customers reproductions of diplomas which
they had not earned. Customers could then deceive prospective
employers about their qualifications.
The case, handled by Deputy Attorney General Karen Fried,
was dropped before its first hearing, which had been scheduled
for Tuesday, May 30. The suit asked that the company be enjoined
from manufacturing the diplomas and be required to pay $2500
for each proven act of wrongdoing.
The state case was initiated at the request of Stanford staff
attorney, Cassius Kirk, after Assoc. Registrar Bob Houghton or
dered and received a Stanford diploma to which he was not
entitled.
