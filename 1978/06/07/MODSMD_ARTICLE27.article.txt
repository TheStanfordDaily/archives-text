# USE president looks ahead
## Britton promises union 'clean up' 
### Monika Guttman 
"In our campaign, we all
came together — radicals,
liberals and conservatives.
We united because we're a
union," according to Bob
Britton, the new United
Stanford Employees (USE)
president.
"As president, I am the
mouthpiece for the union. I
have to put my own feelings
aside and follow the policy
of the union," he said.
Britton began his term as
USE president one month

ago, following Ann
Schlagenhaft in the office,
ending several months of
internal disputes. Most of
the conflicts centered on
union secretary Jim Berk.
Berk holds no office now.
"I have no trouble repre
senting the people," said
Britton, "but I have a lot to
learn. I had to take over the
administrative problems,
which were previously
handled by Berk, and I had
no previous experience in
this capacity. I feel more
comfortable on the policy
end."
Britton, who works at the
University computer
center, receives no financial
compensation for his job as
union president. He said he
is now putting a lot of time
into USE, because "there's
all kinds of cleaning up to
do."
Part of this "cleaning up"
includes a change in the
emphasis of USE's administ
ration.
"Now the 'organizers'
(union employees)
specialize in certain areas.
For instance, Sue Fry hand
les most of the grievances,
and Gary DeMellow works
on classifications, layoffs

and disabilities. That's been
a big problem, because
they've ended up in the of
fice a lot," he said.
Britton said he is waiting
for Shirley Campbell to be
approved by the member
ship as business representa
tive, because she would
change the emphasis to a
geographical area rather
than a "specialty."
"There's a lot of workers
who may have a problem,
but never see USE people,"
he said. "Shirley feels that
75 per cent of the work
should be carried on in the
field."
According to Britton, this
would help with member
ship recruitment, which has
remained a big problem for
USE.
"Also, beginning in June,
we will lower the initiation
fee for one month from $50
to $5. Hopefully this will at
tract a lot of agency shop
people who don't want to
pay the full amount," he
said. "Agency shop" refers
to those workers who can't
vote and are not full mem
bers of the union, but pay
fees similar to regular dues.
Britton said he felt there is
a need for more communi

cation within the union.
"Rather than just the
monthly newspaper, we
need one page leaflets
once a week," he said.
"What I've been finding is
a big problem is the grie
vance system," said Britton.
"There are some 70 grie
vances blocked and almost
80 arbitrations to be
scheduled." He said the
grievance system would be
one of the main objects of
reform in the new contract,
which USE will negotiate in
September 1979.
"We need some kind of
guarantee that they will
expedite arbitrations," he
said.
Other goals of USE in the
new contract will probably
include a dental plan, be
nefits for dependents, and
an increased pension plan,
according to Britton.
"We feel we didn't get a
decent contract this time,"
Britton said. "And we will
probably vote to strike for
the next one."
Britton expressed his
concern with the anti-labor
movement sentiment in the
nation, and said he felt this
was "going against" USE.
