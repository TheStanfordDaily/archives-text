They submitted applica
tions, obtained recommenda
tions, attended meetings, went
through two rounds of inter
views, established preferences
— and waited.
For the 163 candidates cho
sen for the House Associate
(RA) positions for 1978-79, the
process paid off.
This year, 463 students
applied for the positions, in
cluding current RA's who
reapplied. This number re
mains fairly constant from year
to year, according to the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs.
The 348 applicants who
made it to Round Two inter
viewed with the Resident Fel
lows of residences they ex
pressed specific interest in.
Some see everyone
"Some residences, like Ro
ble, see everyone," said Alice
Supton, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs. "Others select
from the folders those people
most attractive to them or suit
able to their house."
Despite time constraints and
the sheer number of people to
be interviewed, most resident
fellows make an effort to see a
large number of applicants.
"I was pretty impressed,"
said Lydia Lewis, a sophomore
applicant. "Robert Hamrdla
called me even though I hadn't
signed up for interviews at his
house (Larkin). And he con
ducted two interviews: the first
to get to know people; the
second to find out about our

attitudes on residential educa
tion."
The residential education
staff matches the lists of pre
ferences submitted by the
applicants to the lists of candi
dates preferred by the House
Fellows.
Flexibility
"Sometimes, a really well
qualified person won't be cho
sen because his or her choices
were very popular ones," said
Supton. "But the system is set
up to give the greatest flexibil
ity and choice to both the Resi
dent Fellows and to the candi
dates."
There is a review process
that applicants who do not
make Round Two may resort
to, either on procedural or
substantive grounds. This year,
19 rejections were appealed.

Five were granted second in
terviews, four on procedural
grounds, which involved ir
regularities in the First Round
interviews: incorrect number
of people on the interview
panel; a panel consisting of all
the same sex, etc.
The grounds for a substan
tive appeal are "gross dis
crepancies between a person's
file and the decision to ad
vance them to Round Two, or
invalid criteria used in making
the decision," according to
Supton.
The FHousing Office is con
sidering changes which would
streamline the procedure of RA
selection. Among the prop
osed changes are making the
initial cut after Round One gre
ater to insure that all those in
Round Two get interviews.
