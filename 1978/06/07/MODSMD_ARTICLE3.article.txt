# Protection Act seeks search prevention
## 
### 
Calling last week's Supreme Court ruling allowing police to use search
warrants against newspapers "only the latest example of our present Sup
reme Court's blatant disregard of First and Fourth Amendment protections,"
Rep. Robert Drinan (D-Mass.) introduced a bill in Congress Friday to protect
newspapers from searches.
"The Press Protection Act of 1978" would prevent any person acting under
the law from searching the premises of persons engaged in news gathering
or dissemination without a prior court hearing involving both parties. The
only time police could obtain a warrant for search and seizure would be if a
news media employee was suspected of committing or having committed a
crime.
The bill provides for both civil and criminal penalties for violators. Persons
whose premises were unlawfully searched could file a civil suit for general
damages and punitive damages up to $10,000. Violators could also be prose
cuted and fined up to $10,000. The bill also provides for an award of attor
ney's fees to any prevailing party, except the United States.
The Supreme Court's reversal of lower court rulings in Zurcher v. The
Stanford Daily said that newspapers and other non-suspects had no special
privileges to protect them from searches and seizures. However, the court
said "the Fourth Amendment does not prevent or advise against legislative
or executive efforts to establish nonconstitutional protections against possi
ble abuse of the search warrant procedure."
