# Foreign students' images of U.S. have altered

### Kathy Trafton 
The United States is a coun
try of "tremendous
paradoxes/' said Jorge Heine,
a Chilean graduate student in
political science here.
Speaking at an informal in
terview with three other
foreign students, Heine said
on the one hand there are
"things like the environmental
movement and the struggle for
women's rights, and on the
other hand there are extremely
odd policies that command
significant support (such as)
the Jarvis-Gann issue, which is
peculiar."
The four students agreed
that arriving in the United
States was a shock for them.
Their images of America as a
land of equality where "no
thing goes wrong" were
proven incorrect, according to
Ato Mensah, a former mic
robiology student here from
Ghana.
Disillusioned
Mensah said he was "disil
lusioned by the great emphasis
placed on material goods and
also on individualism. There is
no sense of compassion for the
next person, even in families."
Nuran Ercan, a Turkish stu
dent who is working toward
her master's degree in civil en
gineering, said the spirit of
cooperation and caring among
students in Turkey is much
greater than that among
American students.
"Here students say hello to
each other and go back to their
work," she said.

The fourth student, Arvind
Khilneni from Pakistan, said
"people never do anything to
gether" here, and he missed
that.
"The closest things to cul
ture are the football games on
Saturday afternoons," said
Khilneni, an engineering
economic systems Ph.D. can
didate. He defined "culture"
as a common value shared by
many people.
Against America
The students said that how
people from their native lands
perceive the United States and
its citizens depends on their
socioeconomic class. Ercan
said Turkish students are
against America economically
and politically.
"They are against the United
States military presence and
NATO. They want Turkey out
of NATO. People believe they
are exploited," she said.
Her friends told her not to
come to America because they
were afraid she would assimi
late the culture. They wanted
her to stay in her own country,
she said.
The uneducated people in
Turkey are bombarded with
advertisements, and because
of this the lower classes say
"America is great, they are out
for us and are helping us. They
are our friends," Ercan noted.
Lazy nation
Ercan said she has always
been against the United States'
investing in Third World coun
tries. She said that before she
came here she thought Turkey
was a "lazy nation, that we
couldn't develop."
Ercan said she now thinks
her country can best develop
outside the realm of American
influence. She said she no
longer blames the American
people themselves for Ameri
ca's presence in Turkey.
"The upper class controls all
the ideas of the people in the
United States," she said. For
example, through television
advertisements they attempt to
control existing ideologies,
she said.
Heine said the Carter ad
ministration with its "focus on

human rights in Latin America
has to some degree been able
to overcome the negative
image that had been created by
the Johnson administration."
No other president since
John F. Kennedy has com
manded the respect in Latin
America that Carter does to
day, according to Heine. He
said that Americans do not
realize the significance of the
Latin Americans' perceptual
change toward the United
States.
The example of the Ameri
can revolution excited and in
spired Latin American patriots
during their struggles for inde
pendence, Heine said. How
ever, the Johnson administra
tion created bad feelings to
ward America; now the Carter
administration has reversed
that trend, he said.
People look up
Mensah said in Ghana most
people look up to the United
States. Once again the pre
sence of American media has
done much to influence the
people's perceptions. Not only
are Time and Newsweek

magazines sold in large volume
there, but "a lot of TV prog
rams are American" as well.
Mensah said that before ar
riving in America, he thought
Americans were rewarded on
the basis of their merits, "what
they know, say and their effi
ciency." He said he attributed
to the United States positive
aspects of "everything I
thought was wrong with soci
ety in Ghana."
Mensah's opinions about
the United States had been
formed by the comments of
American citizens teaching in
Ghana. He said these opinions
werewrong. "When I got here,
itwas very different from what I
thought."
Mensah said he developed
radical views during his stay
here. When he wrote home to
conservative friends in Ghana,
the friends told him to keep his
radical views in the United
States, he said.
Films and magazines
Khilneni, on the other hand,
said the perceptions he formed
of the United States while he
was in Pakistan stemmed from
films and magazines he saw at
the United States Information
Agency there.
"What the Russians and
Chinese showed," Khilneni
said, "was propaganda. What
the U.S. showed was real. I
would believe anything I saw
there."
When he got to America, he
discovered that "America is
not just all that they show in
those films." Khilneni added
that it is illegal to show those
same films in the United States.
More political
The four students said uni
versities in their own countries
are more political than theyare
here because of structural
conditions in the universities
themselves and because of ex

ternal situations such as gov
ernmental dominance. In addi
tion, all four noted that there is
a higher level of social con
sciousness at their universities
at home.
Khilneni said the function of
universities here is to "train the
citizens of tomorrow to ac
quire certain skills." Pakistani
universities perform this func
tion, but also play a large part
in "uplifting the social con
sciousness of the student. Ex
posure to social, political and
economic reality occurs. Many
people go through universities
here without getting that uplift
ing action.
"Despite the United States'

philosophical view that the
best answer is achieved in the
adversary process," Khilneni
said, "students here don't try
hard to look closely at all the
issues, to get the balance of the
issues, which is the tradition of
the whole democratic institu
tions."
Ercan noted that American
students "believe what you tell
them. In Turkey they don't."
Competitive spirit
American students feel pres
sure and operate under a com
petitive spirit, and they do not
let much outside their work
distract them, Mensah said.
Turkish students, however,
"don't care about their study
ing," Ercan said. "In practice
they don't need that stuff. Why
should you learn it? You can
find a job. They sit around and
drink tea all day."
She said few students are
able to attend universities in
Turkey, and those who do are
not allowed to choose their
majors. All incoming students
take art examination, and from
the results they are assigned a
field of study.
Discussions
Ghanaian students spend
much time in political and so
cial discussions, Mensah said.
"The students are more aware
of what's going on in the out

side world. You certainly don't
find that here," he said.
Itiseasyin Pakistan, Khilneni
said, to quickly gathe r r big
crowd to hear issues concern
ing South Africa. Here it is very
difficult, and those who do ap
pear "might be there because
of the sun."
All four students say they
plan to go back to their native
countries to live.
Mensah said he has "no pre
scriptions for what my country
needs. Before I came here I
thought I had (the prescrip
tion), I thought that our prob
lem was technical backward
ness. That was a naive view. v '

The United States is a coun
try of "tremendous
paradoxes/' said Jorge Heine,
a Chilean graduate student in
political science here.
Speaking at an informal in
terview with three other
foreign students, Heine said
on the one hand there are
"things like the environmental
movement and the struggle for
women's rights, and on the
other hand there are extremely
odd policies that command
significant support (such as)
the Jarvis-Gann issue, which is
peculiar."
The four students agreed
that arriving in the United
States was a shock for them.
Their images of America as a
land of equality where "no
thing goes wrong" were
proven incorrect, according to
Ato Mensah, a former mic
robiology student here from
Ghana.
Disillusioned
Mensah said he was "disil
lusioned by the great emphasis
placed on material goods and
also on individualism. There is
no sense of compassion for the
next person, even in families."
Nuran Ercan, a Turkish stu
dent who is working toward
her master's degree in civil en
gineering, said the spirit of
cooperation and caring among
students in Turkey is much
greater than that among
American students.
"Here students say hello to
each other and go back to their
work," she said.

The fourth student, Arvind
Khilneni from Pakistan, said
"people never do anything to
gether" here, and he missed
that.
"The closest things to cul
ture are the football games on
Saturday afternoons," said
Khilneni, an engineering
economic systems Ph.D. can
didate. He defined "culture"
as a common value shared by
many people.

The students said that how
people from their native lands
perceive the United States and
its citizens depends on their
socioeconomic class. Ercan
said Turkish students are
against America economically
and politically.
"They are against the United
States military presence and
NATO. They want Turkey out
of NATO. People believe they
are exploited," she said.
Her friends told her not to
come to America because they
were afraid she would assimi
late the culture. They wanted
her to stay in her own country,
she said.
The uneducated people in
Turkey are bombarded with
advertisements, and because
of this the lower classes say
"America is great, they are out
for us and are helping us. They
are our friends," Ercan noted.
Lazy nation
Ercan said she has always
been against the United States'
investing in Third World coun
tries. She said that before she
came here she thought Turkey
was a "lazy nation, that we
couldn't develop."
Ercan said she now thinks
her country can best develop
outside the realm of American
influence. She said she no
longer blames the American
people themselves for Ameri
ca's presence in Turkey.
"The upper class controls all
the ideas of the people in the
United States," she said. For
example, through television
advertisements they attempt to
control existing ideologies,
she said.
Heine said the Carter ad
ministration with its "focus on

human rights in Latin America

to overcome the negative

the Johnson administration."
No other president since

said that Americans do not
realize the significance of the
Latin Americans' perceptual

can revolution excited and in
spired Latin American patriots
during their struggles for inde

ever, the Johnson administra
tion created bad feelings to
ward America; now the Carter
administration has reversed
that trend, he said.
People look up
Mensah said in Ghana most
people look up to the United
States. Once again the pre
sence of American media has
done much to influence the
people's perceptions. Not only
are Time and Newsweek

magazines sold in large volume
there, but "a lot of TV prog
rams are American" as well.
Mensah said that before ar
riving in America, he thought
Americans were rewarded on
the basis of their merits, "what
they know, say and their effi
ciency." He said he attributed
to the United States positive
aspects of "everything I
thought was wrong with soci

Mensah's opinions about
the United States had been

conservative friends in Ghana,
the friends told him to keep his

Khilneni, on the other hand,
said the perceptions he formed
of the United States while he
was in Pakistan stemmed from
films and magazines he saw at
the United States Information
Agency there.
"What the Russians and
Chinese showed," Khilneni
said, "was propaganda. What
the U.S. showed was real. I
would believe anything I saw
there."
When he got to America, he
discovered that "America is
not just all that they show in
those films." Khilneni added
that it is illegal to show those
same films in the United States.
More political
The four students said uni
versities in their own countries
are more political than theyare
here because of structural
conditions in the universities
themselves and because of ex

ternal situations such as gov
ernmental dominance. In addi
tion, all four noted that there is
a higher level of social con
sciousness at their universities
at home.
Khilneni said the function of
universities here is to "train the
citizens of tomorrow to ac
quire certain skills." Pakistani
universities perform this func
tion, but also play a large part
in "uplifting the social con
sciousness of the student. Ex
posure to social, political and
economic reality occurs. Many
people go through universities
here without getting that uplift
ing action.
"Despite the United States'

philosophical view that the
best answer is achieved in the
adversary process," Khilneni
said, "students here don't try
hard to look closely at all the
issues, to get the balance of the
issues, which is the tradition of
the whole democratic institu
tions."
Ercan noted that American
students "believe what you tell
them. In Turkey they don't."
Competitive spirit
American students feel pres
sure and operate under a com
petitive spirit, and they do not
let much outside their work
distract them, Mensah said.
Turkish students, however,
"don't care about their study

versities in their own countries
are more political than theyare
here because of structural
conditions in the universities
themselves and because of ex

ternal situations such as gov
ernmental dominance. In addi
tion, all four noted that there is
a higher level of social con
sciousness at their universities
at home.
Khilneni said the function of
universities here is to "train the
citizens of tomorrow to ac
quire certain skills." Pakistani
universities perform this func
tion, but also play a large part
in "uplifting the social con
sciousness of the student. Ex
posure to social, political and
economic reality occurs. Many
people go through universities
here without getting that uplift
ing action.
"Despite the United States'

philosophical view that the
best answer is achieved in the
adversary process," Khilneni
said, "students here don't try
hard to look closely at all the
issues, to get the balance of the
issues, which is the tradition of
the whole democratic institu
tions."
Ercan noted that American
students "believe what you tell
them. In Turkey they don't."
Competitive spirit
American students feel pres
sure and operate under a com
petitive spirit, and they do not
let much outside their work
distract them, Mensah said.
Turkish students, however,
"don't care about their study
ing," Ercan said. "In practice
they don't need that stuff. Why
should you learn it? You can
find a job. They sit around and
drink tea all day."
She said few students are
able to attend universities in
Turkey, and those who do are
not allowed to choose their
majors. All incoming students
take art examination, and from
the results they are assigned a
field of study.
Discussions
Ghanaian students spend
much time in political and so
cial discussions, Mensah said.
"The students are more aware
of what's going on in the out

side world. You certainly don't
find that here," he said.
Itiseasyin Pakistan, Khilneni
said, to quickly gathe r r big
crowd to hear issues concern
ing South Africa. Here it is very
difficult, and those who do ap
pear "might be there because
of the sun."
All four students say they
plan to go back to their native
countries to live.
Mensah said he has "no pre
scriptions for what my country
needs. Before I came here I
thought I had (the prescrip
tion), I thought that our prob
lem was technical backward
ness. That was a naive view. v '
