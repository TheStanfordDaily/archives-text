## Scrapbook tells story of teacher in 1800s 
### Cheryl Zollars 
Jennie McKee, a resident of
Mayfield, became a school
teacher after college and
then a San Francisco school
principal. A career woman by
choice, McKee views marriage
sardonically — to McKee a
housewife is a weary disil
lusioned woman with a baby
under one arm and an iron
weighing down the other.
This description could fit any
of several recent Stanford
graduates.
But Jennie McKee was a stu
dent over 100 years ago, al
though not at Stanford.
Regina Faulkner, a San Jose
State University freshman,
owns the key to Jennie McKee
— a small, dark-green
leather-bound scrapbook she
bought for 50 cents at Busvans,
a San Francisco junk store for

unclaimed storage items.
The scrapbook, filled with
pasted-in newspaper clip
pings, faded calling cards and
samples of popular poetry,
maxims and humor of the late
1800s ("What tricks are the
most common among
Irishman? . . . Patricks!") pro
vide a glimpse into the person
ality of a woman whom Faulk
ner said is very similar to her
self.
Similar book
"The ironic thing is that I
have a book like that," she
said. "I don't cut as many
things out from newspapers,
but I do from magazines —
poetry, sayings and words."
Faulkner, a student of the
humanities, is interested in old
books — an interest shared by
SJSU Humanities Professor
Robert Pepper to whom she

appealed for help on research
ing details of McKee's life.
In the 1870s, McKee lived in
the village of Mayfield, now in
cluded in Stanford University
property. According to his
paper "A San Jose College Girl
in the 19705," Pepper assumes
that McKee went to college
somewhere in the area, al
though she may not have
graduated.
An undated news clipping
near the scrapbook's end
names McKee as one of 29 stu
dents receiving teaching cre
dentials after passing a quar
terly public examination.
Telephone listings
Pepper said that McKee be
came a principal in San Fran
cisco in the 1890s. Old tele
phone directories of that year,
which Pepper found in the
Stanford research library, list

her twice, under the names J.E.
McKee and J. Evelyn McKee.
Because her listings disap
pear after 1900-and because her
name is not in the 1900 census,
Pepper surmised that "she
died before 1900 in San Fran
cisco or maybe moved out of
the state."
The most striking aspect of
McKee's life as revealed by the
scrapbook is the similarity of
her lifestyle and the personal
dilemmas she faced to those of
today's women. She seems to
have had a dual view of ro
mance and marriage.
"A lot of the poems are
about romance, but some are
about rebellion," Faulkner
said.
Sentimental poems
Many of the poems are sen
timental: "For connoisseurs of
poetry the many pages which
Jennie filled with newspaper
verse are interesting chiefly as
evidence of the perennial
wretchedness of popular
taste," Pepper wrote.
The scrapbook contains sev
eral of Longfellow's and Ten
nyson's "less memorable
poems," besides the works of
minor poets — including "San
Jose's own Edwin Markham," a
schoolteacher contemporary
of McKee, according to Pep
per.
Faulkner said she believes
McKee deliberately remained a

lifelong spinster. The scrap
book's only hint of a personal
romance is the cryptic hand
written entry: "Jimmy I almost
love thee."
"I can sympathize with her,"
said Faulkner. "I have some of
the same fears — maybe I love
him, maybe I don't."
McKee's life and several
scrapbook items belie the
poetry's sentimentality, pre
senting instead the image of a
liberalized woman. While in
San Francisco, McKee lived for
a time with financier John De
mpsy, "quite a wheeler-dealer
in the nineteenth century," ac
cording to Pepper.
1876 program
An 1876 program (pasted in)
of the SJSU "Work and Win
Society's" first "Literary Enter
tainment" announces a play
("What Are We Coming To?")
with three scenes — set in
1776, 1876 and 1976. The latter
scene's protagonists are an
"Old Fogy" (male) and a "Com
ing Woman."
Pasted on facing pages are
two cartoon views of marriage
— before and after, the blush
ing bride and the harried
housewife.
Besides revealing tidbits of
local history, other scrapbook
entries provide a poignant con
trast between the late 1800s
and today.

her twice, under the names J.E.
McKee and J. Evelyn McKee.
Because her listings disap
pear after 1900-and because her
name is not in the 1900 census,
Pepper surmised that "she
died before 1900 in San Fran
cisco or maybe moved out of
the state."
The most striking aspect of
McKee's life as revealed by the
scrapbook is the similarity of
her lifestyle and the personal
dilemmas she faced to those of
today's women. She seems to
have had a dual view of ro
mance and marriage.
"A lot of the poems are
about romance, but some are
about rebellion," Faulkner
said.
Sentimental poems
Many of the poems are sen
timental: "For connoisseurs of
poetry the many pages which
Jennie filled with newspaper
verse are interesting chiefly as
evidence of the perennial
wretchedness of popular
taste," Pepper wrote.
The scrapbook contains sev
eral of Longfellow's and Ten
nyson's "less memorable
poems," besides the works of
minor poets — including "San
Jose's own Edwin Markham," a
schoolteacher contemporary
of McKee, according to Pep
per.
Faulkner said she believes
McKee deliberately remained a

lifelong spinster. The scrap
book's only hint of a personal
romance is the cryptic hand
written entry: "Jimmy I almost
love thee."
"I can sympathize with her,"
said Faulkner. "I have some of
the same fears — maybe I love
him, maybe I don't."
McKee's life and several
scrapbook items belie the
poetry's sentimentality, pre
senting instead the image of a
liberalized woman. While in
San Francisco, McKee lived for
a time with financier John De
mpsy, "quite a wheeler-dealer
in the nineteenth century," ac
cording to Pepper.
1876 program
An 1876 program (pasted in)
of the SJSU "Work and Win
Society's" first "Literary Enter
tainment" announces a play
("What Are We Coming To?")
with three scenes — set in
1776, 1876 and 1976. The latter
scene's protagonists are an
"Old Fogy" (male) and a "Com
ing Woman."
Pasted on facing pages are
two cartoon views of marriage
— before and after, the blush
ing bride and the harried
housewife.
Besides revealing tidbits of
local history, other scrapbook
entries provide a poignant con
trast between the late 1800s
and today.
Jennie McKee, a resident of
Mayfield, became a school
teacher after college and
then a San Francisco school
principal. A career woman by
choice, McKee views marriage
sardonically — to McKee a
housewife is a weary disil
lusioned woman with a baby
under one arm and an iron
weighing down the other.
This description could fit any
of several recent Stanford
graduates.
But Jennie McKee was a stu
dent over 100 years ago, al
though not at Stanford.
Regina Faulkner, a San Jose
State University freshman,
owns the key to Jennie McKee
— a small, dark-green
leather-bound scrapbook she
bought for 50 cents at Busvans,
a San Francisco junk store for

unclaimed storage items.
The scrapbook, filled with
pasted-in newspaper clip
pings, faded calling cards and
samples of popular poetry,
maxims and humor of the late
1800s ("What tricks are the
most common among
Irishman? . . . Patricks!") pro
vide a glimpse into the person
ality of a woman whom Faulk
ner said is very similar to her
self.
Similar book
"The ironic thing is that I
have a book like that," she
said. "I don't cut as many
things out from newspapers,
but I do from magazines —
poetry, sayings and words."
Faulkner, a student of the
humanities, is interested in old
books — an interest shared by
SJSU Humanities Professor
Robert Pepper to whom she

appealed for help on research
ing details of McKee's life.
In the 1870s, McKee lived in
the village of Mayfield, now in
cluded in Stanford University
property. According to his
paper "A San Jose College Girl
in the 19705," Pepper assumes
that McKee went to college
somewhere in the area, al
though she may not have
graduated.
An undated news clipping
near the scrapbook's end
names McKee as one of 29 stu
dents receiving teaching cre
dentials after passing a quar
terly public examination.
Telephone listings
Pepper said that McKee be
came a principal in San Fran
cisco in the 1890s. Old tele
phone directories of that year,
which Pepper found in the
Stanford research library, list

her twice, under the names J.E.
McKee and J. Evelyn McKee.
Because her listings disap
pear after 1900-and because her
name is not in the 1900 census,
Pepper surmised that "she
died before 1900 in San Fran
cisco or maybe moved out of
the state."
