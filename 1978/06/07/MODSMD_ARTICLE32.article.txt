# Optacon improvements aid blind students to read

With the help of an instrument developed by
the Voice Communication Project blind people
will be able to increase their access to printed
material and reading speed. This instrument will
transform printed words into synthetic speech,
so the blind person will listen rather than read.
Telesensory Systems Inc. (TSI), of Palo Alto,
has been perfecting its Voice Communication
Project and hopes to begin marketing the pro
duct next year. The Voice Communication Pro
ject expands upon the Optacon (optical to tac
tile conversion), a device which made it possible
to read any printed material without first trans
cribing it to Braille.
Paul Liniack, Reading Systems manager at TSI
explained that the Optacon is a tape recorder
sized instrument which the blind person uses
with two hands. The right hand usually controls
a scanner which is passed over each line of print.
The forefinger of the left hand is placed on a
tactile pad consisting of 144 pins arranged into
six rows of 24, he said.
As the page is scanned, the pins are raised to
resemble the letter viewed by the camera in the
scanner. Using this method, the blind person
can read up to ninety words a minute, he said.
Several variations of the Optacon can be used
to read computer terminals and typewriters.
Speech Plus, a talking calculator for blind
people with a vocabulary of 24 words, was its
next development. It uses the simulated
speech, but is limited by a finite vocabulary.
The Voice Communication Project is invent
ing the capacity for an infinite simulated voc
abulary. The Optacon scanner would relay
printed words to a computer which would con
vert the text into phonems (the basic unit of
speech). The phonems would be converted into
wave forms which would be emitted from the
computer as a sound based on that wave form.
Senior Eric Dorsey, an electrical engineering
major, is helping with the project. "The objec
tive is to develop a vocal track model," he said.
"We talk into a microphone to find out the

wave forms of different sounds and try to extract
the wave forms," he said.
Each wave form corresponds to a phonem.
The wave form of each phonem is coded into a
PDPII computer which can translate the waves
into a sound output.
The sound waves produced by human speech
and the sound waves produced by the computer
are identical so the words can be recognized."
"The computer has a flat-toned voice," Dor
sey said. "We are working on getting the proper
inflections at the ends of sentences and the
proper pausing between words," he said.
"The PDPII computer is large and vey costly.
Right now it is impractical for blind people,"
Dorsey said.
"We are trying to develop a microcomputer,
which would do the same thing, but cost only
$10,000. This would be portable and reasonable
for schools and companies," Dorsey explained.
"The problem is compressing the wave form
into a manageable size," he said.
The Voice Communication Project instrument
would more than double the reading speed ob
tained with the Optacon. It would be possible to
read 200 words a minute, according to Dorsey.
"It takes less training to use, so there is that
advantage," Dorsey said. To use the Optacon,
the blind person must learn to identify the feel
of each letter.
"For nonsense phonems, such as TSI, the
computer would spell out the letters," Dorsey
said.
TSI began in Stanford's electrical engineering
labs. Professor John Linville, executive head of
electrical engineering department, began re
search on the Optacon as a supplement for his
blind daughter's reading needs, as it was dif
ficult to get materials transcribed into Braille
quickly.
Dr. James Meindl, Dr. J. Stephen Brugler, and
Dr. James Bliss aided him and finally produced
the Optacon. They formed an independent
company to manufacture and sell products for
the physically handicapped (TSI).
