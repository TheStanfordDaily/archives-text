# Laughing gas provides dangerous party thrills
## 
### Wendy Jalonen 
There might be nothing new
under the sun when it comes to
Stanford parties. But just when
students are beginning to res
ign themselves to that, some
thing not so new has resur
faced to challenge the reign of
the strawberry daiquiri â€”
laughing gas.
The illicit use of laughing
gas, or nitrous oxide, dates
back to the 1840s, but accord
ing to Stanford Medical Center
anesthesiologist Dr. Charles

Whitcher, there has been a re
cent upswing in its popularity.
Nitrous oxide is a colorless,
odorless gas at normal con
centrations, sweet-smelling at
higher ones. It is a potent
anesthetic and is commonly
used in dentists' offices.
Recently, said Whitcher, "a
number of dental offices here
have been vandalized and the
nitrous oxide taken from
them."
Two dangers
There are two dangers in
using it for party entertain
ment, said Whitcher. The first
effect of nitrous oxide is a nar
cotic state where the senses
are numbed. But unlike other
common drug effects, this is a
nitrogen narcosis, what divers
get when they surface too
quickly, otherwise known as
"the rapture of the deep."
"They just don't care what
happens to them" in this state,
said Whitcher. The person
does not protect himself and
can kill himself as a direct re
sult of the gas.
The second and potentially
fatal danger is due to the fact
that nitrous oxide "does not
support life." The problem is
that when inhaled, it is taken in
place of a breath of oxygen so it
reduces the amount of oxygen
going to the body, said
Whitcher.
Used medically, it is given in
a controlled mixture with oxy
gen through a special ap
paratus. But this apparatus is
not available at parties.
Whitcher estimated that 10
breaths in a short period of
time would be enough to pro
duce death in humans. At par
ties, however, "they get a cer
tain amount of room air and
that's what's saving them."
At a recent party here, ac
cording to one senior, 200 in

dividual canisters of nitrous
oxide were emptied during the
evening, with an average of 10
per person up to a maximum of
20.
Whippets
The individual canisters,
enough for one breath, are cal
led Whippets. They are also
sold under the brand name of
Whip-Master, and are contain
ers of the gas used to propel
whipping cream out of its can.
Nitrous oxide can be ob
tained by removing the layer of
gas in a whipped cream can.
This is sometimes done in the
supermarket, leaving rows of
whipping cream with little, or
nothing to propel it out of the
can.
Effects of gas
The effects of the gas, said
the student, are that "it kills a
few brain cells but nothing
else. I get a headache after 10."
He added that it wasn't a very
strong headache. He had,
however, heard of two in
stances of people dying as a re
sult of Whippets.
According to Officer Carl
Gielitz of the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety,
deaths from nitrous oxide are
not unheard of. "It can be a
deadly gas, I understand, if
someone gets too much of it,"
said Gielitz. There is no Uni
versity policy about it, how
ever.
Besides stealing canisters of
nitrous oxide from supermar
kets, dental offices or college
chemistry departments, it is
possible to buy the gas over the
counter at restaurant supply
outlets.
According to one student
questioned, one local store
sold a box of 10 Whippets for
$3.95 and two dozen for $9.00,
while a second store sold two
dozen for $6.00.
