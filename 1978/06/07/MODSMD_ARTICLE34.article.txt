## Theater/karen caesar At last, 'Pippin' has arrived and it's TERRIFIC! 
### 
At long last, "Pippin" has hit
the road. Afterfive years on the
Great White Way (it was
Broadway's seventh-longest
running musical), the show
that catapulted Ben Vereen to
stardom and won two Tony
Awards for director
choreographer Bob Fosse has
come West. It's about time.
"Pippin" opened to rave re
views in New York in 1972 and
proceeded to win, among
other awards, five Tonys. It has
a rousing, finger-snapping,
toe-tapping score with re
markably intelligent lyrics,
some outrageous choreog
raphy, strong, talented per
formers and enough spirit and
enthusiasm to knock you right
out of your seat.
The story centers on Pippin,

the Emperor Charlemagne's
young son who wants his life to
be "something more than
long." He tries being a soldier,
he tries drugs, sex and just
about everything else that
comes his way, but fulfillment
and happiness evade him. The
time and place is eighth cen
tury France, but it could very
well be here and now.
Geriatric audience
I couldn't understand why so
many members of the rather
geriatric audience walked out
on "Pippin," but I think now
that it has something to do with
their inability to identify with
Pippin, or perhaps their unwil
lingness to even try to under
stand his restlessness.
Pippin is full of curiosity
and enthusiasm and expecta

tions, but like so many of us
young whippersnappers, he
can't seem to stay content for
very long, which causes him at
various times to exclaim things
along the line of "I know this is
a musical comedy, but I still
want my life to mean some
thing!" And while life may not
exactly be a musical comedy,
his plaint has universal signifi
cance for anyone who has ever
stopped to question the path
his life has taken.
Michael Rupert is an out
standing Pippin, the kind of
singer-dancer-actor who is
made for musical comedies.
Although his phrasing in some
of the songs is a bit peculiar
("Everything has a season-u/i,
everything has a time-uh,"
etc.) his voice is big and strong

and he makes singing beauti
fully appear effortless.
'Exhausting vitality'
He appears totally comforta
ble in his role, which is not
surprising since he just
finished playing Pippin on
Broadway for two years. What
is surprising is how he can con
tinue to infuse Pippin with
such exhausting vitality. It's as
if each performance is his first.
As the leading player, Larry
Riley has a tough act to follow
(Ben Vereen originated the
role), but he manages to make
the part his own. He sings and
dances his way through Pip
pin's life and he is, quite sim
ply, electrifying. When he is on
stage, there is so much energy
that the air seems to crackle.
Great support
The supporting players are
uniformly excellent. Alexandra
Borrie as Catherine, the
woman with whom Pippin
eventually finds a nice, quiet
kind of happiness, is a subtle
and gifted actress. Carol
Schweid as Fastrada, Pippin's
young and somewhat sleazy
stepmother, gives a delight
fully devilish twist to the role of
doting parent. And her doltish
other stepson, Lewis, doltishly
played by Jerry Colker, is a fine
example of how an actor can
etch a small part indelibly on
your memory.
The only actor from the orig
inal Broadway cast is Eric Berry,
who portrays Charlemagne.
He has been with the show for
five years, and though he tries
to cover, he is the only one
who seems a trifle bored with
the goings-on on stage.
Grandma stops the show
Finally, Thelma Carpenter as
Pippin's lusty old grandma,
Berthe, is on the stage for
about 10 minutes but manages
to steal the show when she
belts out "No Time At All."
When we first see her, she is
wrapped in a shawl, sewing
and looking sweetly senile. But
the first thing she says is "god
dammit, I hate needlepoint!"
and so it is immediately appa
rent that this is not your aver
age grandma.
She has lots of wisdom to
pass on to Pippin. "Sometimes
I think men raise flags when
they can't get anything else
up," she says, disgusted with
the activities of her emperor
son, Charlemagne. She advises
Pippin, "whatever you do,
don't do too much thinking."
That is what seems to get Pip
pin into so much trouble.
Kinky stuff
There is some mighty kinky
choreography in "Pippin,"
thanks to Bob Fosse. People
slink around constantly, half
naked and in ridiculous
make-up, moving suggestively
and giving the show a strange,
nightmarish quality. They are
reminiscent of the German
whores in "Cabaret," which
Fosse also happened to
choreograph and direct. There
is a lot of pelvic thrusting and
touchy-feely stuff that might
have had something to do with
why so many older people de
cided to walk out.
There is no question about
it; "Pippin" is a very different
musical. It has a vigorous
theatricality that is hard to
forget. It is almost like a circus
sideshow: alittlefreaky,alittle
disturbing, but always fascinat
ing.

fanciful telling of Pippin's story; his was the role
that made Ben Vereen famous.
