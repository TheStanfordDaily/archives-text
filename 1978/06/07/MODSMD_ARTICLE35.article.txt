"That's some catch, that catch
22," said Orr.
"Its the best there is," said
Yosarian.
In the music industry today,
the existence of a tour presup
poses the existence of a book
ing agent. A booking agent will
only proselytize with a record
contract in hand, and record
contracts require manage
ment, except that manage
ment, like booking, prefers to
begin with a "star." That's all
very simple, if you happen to
be a "star," but for relatively
unknown musicians with only
huge amounts of musical abil
ity and expertise to recom
mend them, the system as it
stands can be something of a
problem. Relatively unknown
musicians with only huge
amounts of ability and exper
tise must establish themselves
at Boarding Houses, Great
American Music Halls and oc
casional Dinkelspiel Au
ditoriums, and they must hope

for a loud and enthusiastic re
view by someone lucky
enough to see them.
Well.
Well. It is the purpose of this
column to loudly and en
thusiastically review Chic
Streetman, Eric Ajaye, and Mis
sissippi Charles Bevel, and to
suggest that we ought to do
our best to find them that occa
sional Dinkelspiel. Between
them, they have staged two of
the finest concerts of the year
this year at Stanford, and the
talents they have shown there
are, at least, considerable.
Streetman, Ajaye und Bevel
are classical blues players. As
Streetman and Bevel, as Ajaye
and Streetman, and soon, with
luck, as Bevel, Streetman and
Ajaye, the three have de
veloped a mixture of acoustic
guitar, impeccable bass, flaw
less harmony and backtalk that
inevitably unglues an audi
ence. They, for example, have
unglued audiences at the San

Francisco Blues Festival, at
Berkeley's Bread and Roses
Festival, and at the aforemen
tioned Boarding House and
Great American Music Hall:
they have also appeared sepa
rately or as a pair with 8.8.
King, Albert Collins, Sonny
Terry and Brownie McGee, the
Persuasions, Doc Watson,
Freddie Hubbard, Rhythm
Heritage and Taj Mahal.
Again.
Again, they have been well
received everywhere by both
performers and audiences —
that is perhaps best
exemplified by their recent ap
pearances here. Mississippi
Charles Bevel, Chic Streetman
and Eric Ajaye have played
twice, at Phi Psi for fire-hazard
crowds (once, sadly, there
were no photographers); in
November it was Bevel and
Streetman, and in May Street
man and Ajaye got help from
Taj Mahal. He had heard they
were here, and he showed up
around midnight, and then
they sat and played as a trio for
the better part of two hours.
Taj Mahal was very much im
pressed, and the audience
went justifiably nutso, and it
kind of makes you wonder why
the hell they aren't "stars."
And that's the catch. Missis
sippi, Chic and Eric, separately
or in one of their various per
mutations, were not (and in
many senses never intended to
be) "stars" to begin with, and
that, of course, puts them on
the wrong side of the "star"-
to-begin-with system. With all
due respect, they were the
equal of anything ASSU Special
Events could arrange this year,
and we ought to get them back.
Are you listening, Special
Events? I can give you their
numbers if you want them.
"Jump!" Major Danby cried.
Yossarian jumped. Nately's
whore was hiding just outside
the door. The knife came
down, missing him by inches,
and he took off.
