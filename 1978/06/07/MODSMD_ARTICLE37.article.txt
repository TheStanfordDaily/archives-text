## Petty's sound: future rock 
### 
Tom Petty is the Renaissance
of Rock and Roll.
I've said it before: There's a
lot of crap that's floating
around the AM airwaves iiiai
some would call music. Maybe
it's the sound of the '70s, but
the '80s are almost here and I
have a feeling, after seeing
Petty play at Memorial Au
ditorium Saturday, that the '80s
may just spell the return of
good, solid Rock. And at the
forefront of the Rock Revival
will be a young man named
Tom Petty.
Petty broke into the
BeeGee-esque AM scene a few
months ago with a hard-driving
sound on a song called
"Breakdown." The composi
tion quickly rose into the Top
40 and floated around for
awhile before falling into Ob
livion. The song came from the
album "Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers," which was the
group's first effort.
Now, Petty has released a
new album, "You're Gonna

Get It,"and is touring exten
sively to promote it. Saturday
night's performance was a
good showcase for the group.
It is maturing quickly and it is
attracting a following.
The show began almost an
hour late, much to everyone's
discontent. Finally, at 8:50
p.m., Wha-koo came on stange
and delivered a 50 minute set
that didn't deserve an encore
and didn't get one. There is lit
tle about the band that makes
one sit up and take notice.
Lead singer Dave Palmer an
chors a strong vocal perfor
mance when he calms down
enough to sing and lead
guitarist Chuck Cochran can
play rehearsed scales and
make people think he's doing
something more difficult than
he really is. But besides a tight
harmony and a capable drum
mer, Wha-koo still has quite a
way to go.
10:20 p.m.
Things changed at 10:20
p.m. when the stage darkened
and Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers stepped on.
Opening with "When The
Time Comes," a song from the
new album, Petty gavea blisier
ing performance. Though in
the end it had lasted only an

hour, the group performed 14
songs with intensity, and few
people left unsatisfied.
Petty's avant garde sound is
centered around short, high
energy songs that have their
roots in the '50s and '60s. Be
sides performing five songs
from each of his albums, in
cluding "Breakdown" and "I
Need To Know," his new hot
single, Petty betrayed his influ
enced by performing a few
early Rock and Roll classics.
"Shout," made popular by the
Animals in the '60s was Petty's
first encore. He soon came out
again to perform Chuck Berry's
"Route 66." The final song of
the night was a searing rendi
tion of "I Fought The Law."
It was over
When it was all over, the
band had delivered a powerful
message: They are the grqup
of the future to watch.
Last time the group ap
peared in the Bay Area, they
played second bill to Be-Bop
Deluxe at Winterland. Petty
stole the show then, but this
time, when they play Win
terland this Saturday, they
won't have to. They will be the
show. In fact, they are quite
likely to be THE show for some
years in the future.
