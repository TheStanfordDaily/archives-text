## Very Witty. Loudon Wainwright III. 
### 
You've broken my heart
You've torn it apart,
So f'.ck you.
Cliche No. 1: Starting an article with song
lyrics.
Cliche No. 2: Using a cheap dramatic device
like cliche No. 1.
Terribly funny idea and possibly redeeming
feature: beginning an article on Loudon Wain
wright 111 with lyrics by Harry Nilson, which have
nothing to do with anything.
Once upon a time, when he was a folkie in the
Village, Loudon Wainwright was hailed as "the
new Bob Dylan." Please. One is enough. Any
way, comparing one person to another is
dangerous. It could break up potential friend
ships.
No, Loudon Wainwright can not be compared
to Bob Dylan. One thing, however, he can very
readily be compared to: apple pie.
Those of you still hung up on a.p. as a symbol
of America: fergit it, man. Nothing to do with
what I'm saying.
Here's why:
Both are a bit flaky around the edges.
Both area subtle combination of the spicy and
the predictable.
Both stand up well alone, or with accom
panists (in one case, ice cream; in the other, a
backup band).
Both are crusty on the outside . . . but you
know there's good stuff inside.
Both are — awwww — sweet.
Both are easily forgotten when out of sight,
until they pop up again, when they're a most
unexpected pleasure.

Stop. Cancel. Hold the phone. I apologize. It
happens when vou try to make an excruciatingly
clever analogy: sometimes it just doesn't work. I
am sor<y.
Loudon Wainright is not like apple pie at all.
He is sick. He sings songs about dead skunks,
and alcohol, and being old, and Cod knows
what else.
He played the Boarding House a couple of
Saturdays ago. Just him and a guitar.
,\t the Boarding House Wainwright proved
he's best with a small appreciative crowd. He
was veryfunny. Very witty. Very dry and laconic.
Very communicative, warm, entertaining. And
the house was packed with an adoringly bois
terous and supportive audience. The "hero's
welcome" was well-deserved, following as it did
on the heels of the previous Wednesday's
Boarding house benefit fiasco where, as noted
journalist Neil Zunn wrote, "he died for our
sins."
Wainwright just released "Final Exam," his
second Arista album. He is not one of the most
popular/highest paid/best-selling acts in the
music industry, and in fact his material stands up
better live than on disc. He had a novelty hit a
few years back called "Dead Skunk in the Mid
dle of the Road." Remember? Me neither.
But if you get the chance, see him. He'll make
you laugh, and you'll have fun.
And he's less fattening than ... ah, forget it.
He ain't tied down/To no home town.
Oooh, and you thought he was reckless.
You think he's bad/He thinks you're mad
Hey, and the guitar player gets restless.
And his coat is torn and frayed.
Cliche No. 3.
