Cecil Taylor
Air Above Mountains
(Buildings Within)
This cryptically titled album
is the newest solo piano effort
from the foremost member of
the avant-garde. In the past it
was often remarked that
Taylor's music would doubt
less soften as he grows older â€”
in contrast, Taylor's music has
grown increasingly intense in
the past few years.
On this album Taylor plays
the Bosendorfer grand piano,
noted for its four extra keys
(possibly signalling the even
tual demise of the old 88 key
model?). Taylor uses these
extra notes to produce growl
ing bass passages. The Bosen
dorfer clarity (long a trademark
of these fine German pianos) is
put to a real test ast the listener
tries to plow through the dense
clouds of sound which Taylor
creates.
Taylor's music is uncom
promising, but even the unin
itiated should be fascinated (if
only in a perverse way) by this
new set.

Jack Wilson
Innovations
Jack Wilson is one of the few
jazz musicians around with a
deep sense of the "beautiful."
He manages to create music
which is very listenable and
mellow without making it
sound like Muzak.
This latest album (which may
be difficult to find except in
stores with a large stock) is a
very enjoyable production. His
music swings like Peterson
only with fewer notes. The
sense is very pure and unclut
tered. His playing on "Invita
tion" and "Waltz for Ahmad" is
supple and full-toned.
Wilson seems influenced by
Errol Garner, Ahmad Jamal,
and Peterson. Perhaps the
most interesting aspect of this
album is Wilson's ability to
weave electric and acoustic
pianos together on the same
number, playing one with his
left hand and the other with his
right. The effect is far from
clashing, but rather an aurally
enticing approach. This album
is highly recommended to all.
