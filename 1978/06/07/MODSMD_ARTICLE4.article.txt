# Prop. 13 passes by landslide
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — California vot
ers — stung by skyrocketing prop
erty tax bills — approved the Jarvis
tax cut initiative by landslide propor
tions yesterday.
Howard Jarvis, 75-year-old author
of the tax cut measure, called his
election victory the start of a tax re
volt that will spread across America.
Attorney General Evelle Younger
lead former Los Angeles Police Chief
Ed Davis by a 10 per cent margin in
the race for the Republican nomina
tion for governor.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who faced only

token opposition from eight political
unknowns, won the Democratic
primary with three-quarters of the
vote.
Returns from 12,038 of California's
23,793 precincts showed Proposition
13, the Jarvis initiative, leading b>
nearly 2 to 1 with 1,130,102 yes to
673,360 no, or 63 to 37 per cent.
Moderates defeated
A more moderate tax cut measure
supported by Brown, Proposition 8,
trailed 818,288 to 872,237 with 50 per
cent of the vote counted.
In the race for governor, Younger
led Davis, former Los Angeles Police
Chief, 258,364 to 197,422, in early re
turns.
In the race for governor, Younger
had 39 per cent of the vote, followed
by Davis at 29 per cent, Fresno As
semblyman Ken Maddy, 20 per cent
and San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, 8
per cent.
With 42 per cent of the state's
23,793 precincts reporting, Younger
had 39.1 per cent of the Republican
vote, followed by Davis at 30.3 per
cent, Fresno Assemblyman Ken
Maddy with 19.8 per cent and San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson 8.6 per
cent.
Proposition 13, which would cut
property taxes in half and reduce
funds for cities, counties and schools
by $7 billion annually, sparked what

could be a record primary election
turnout, topping 70 per cent in Los
Angeles and other urban areas.
Loud and clear
Proposition 1, a $350 million
school bond issue trailed by a 2 to 1
margin in early returns as voters
throughout the state voiced their
opposition to government spending
in loud and clear terms.
Proposition 2, a $375 million sew
age treatment bond, led narrowly,
while Proposition 3, a five-year tax
exemption for home solar units,
trailed nearly 3 to 2.
Also defeated was Proposition 12,
which would have established an in
dependent commission to recom
mend salaries for state officials. It
was being beaten about 5 to 3.
Brown said the returns showed the
people "want a spirit of austerity,
and that's what I'm going to do."
"This is not a partisan issue. The
vote comes from liberals, conserva
tives, Democrats and Republi
cans. . . . What we have is the
strongest expression of our democ
ratic process that I've seen in a de
cade," Brown said.
"It's now time to make sure the will
of the people is carried out in a sensi

tive and humane way. We are not
going to have increased state taxes.
People want that spirit of frugality
spread across California. We will cut
those parts of state government
where it is most intelligent to do so,"
Brown said.
State Sen. George Deukmejian,
author of California's death penalty,
trounced James Browning, Patricia
Hearst's prosecutor, in the Republi
can primary for attorney general.
Teeter-totter
And in a teeter-totter Democratic
race for the same job, black Con
gresswoman Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke widened her lead over Los
Angeles City Attorney Burt Pines —
52 to 48 per cent with 73 per cent of
the precincts in. Burke had 551,183
votes to Pines' 511,664.
Deukmejian, a 16-year legislative
veteran from Long Beach, had
428,886 to 255,065 for Browning, who
had stressed his role in the Hearst
case.

Los Angeles (AP) — California vot
ers — stung by skyrocketing prop
erty tax bills — approved the Jarvis
tax cut initiative by landslide propor
tions yesterday.
Howard Jarvis, 75-year-old author
of the tax cut measure, called his
election victory the start of a tax re
volt that will spread across America.
Attorney General Evelle Younger
lead former Los Angeles Police Chief
Ed Davis by a 10 per cent margin in
the race for the Republican nomina
tion for governor.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who faced only

token opposition from eight political
unknowns, won the Democratic
primary with three-quarters of the
vote.
Returns from 12,038 of California's
23,793 precincts showed Proposition
13, the Jarvis initiative, leading b>
nearly 2 to 1 with 1,130,102 yes to
673,360 no, or 63 to 37 per cent.
Moderates defeated
A more moderate tax cut measure
supported by Brown, Proposition 8,
trailed 818,288 to 872,237 with 50 per
cent of the vote counted.
In the race for governor, Younger
led Davis, former Los Angeles Police
Chief, 258,364 to 197,422, in early re
turns.
In the race for governor, Younger
had 39 per cent of the vote, followed
by Davis at 29 per cent, Fresno As
semblyman Ken Maddy, 20 per cent
and San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, 8
per cent.
With 42 per cent of the state's
23,793 precincts reporting, Younger
had 39.1 per cent of the Republican
vote, followed by Davis at 30.3 per
cent, Fresno Assemblyman Ken
Maddy with 19.8 per cent and San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson 8.6 per
cent.
Proposition 13, which would cut
property taxes in half and reduce
funds for cities, counties and schools
by $7 billion annually, sparked what

could be a record primary election
turnout, topping 70 per cent in Los
Angeles and other urban areas.
Loud and clear
Proposition 1, a $350 million
school bond issue trailed by a 2 to 1
margin in early returns as voters
throughout the state voiced their
opposition to government spending
in loud and clear terms.
Proposition 2, a $375 million sew
age treatment bond, led narrowly,
while Proposition 3, a five-year tax
exemption for home solar units,
trailed nearly 3 to 2.
Also defeated was Proposition 12,
which would have established an in
dependent commission to recom
mend salaries for state officials. It
was being beaten about 5 to 3.
Brown said the returns showed the
people "want a spirit of austerity,
and that's what I'm going to do."
"This is not a partisan issue. The
vote comes from liberals, conserva
tives, Democrats and Republi
cans. . . . What we have is the
strongest expression of our democ
ratic process that I've seen in a de
cade," Brown said.
"It's now time to make sure the will
of the people is carried out in a sensi

tive and humane way. We are not
going to have increased state taxes.
People want that spirit of frugality
spread across California. We will cut
those parts of state government
where it is most intelligent to do so,"
Brown said.
