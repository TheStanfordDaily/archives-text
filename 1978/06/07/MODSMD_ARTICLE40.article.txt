## It's time for the Proud Popover 
### 
The Proud Popover
Stanford Shopping Center
326-0272
Several imported dishes —
the crepe, the quiche, the
pizza, the fondue — have re
cently been popularized in this
country and are now about as
American as apple pie. So
maybe it's time for something
truly American to earn that
same distinction. Maybe, as
Cathy Zelzer, owner of one of
Palo Alto's newest restaurants,
suggests, it's time for the
popover — the Proud Popover,
that is.
Against a contemporary
backdrop of shoe stores,
groceries, and high fashion,
the new Proud Popover in
Stanford Shopping Cener
brings to life the hospitality of
an old New England inn.
Named after the fluffy con
coction of eggs, milk, flour and
shortening which dates from

the days of the earliest settlers,
the Proud Popover features
more than just popovers. Be
sides five different stuffed
popover entrees, there is also
prime rib, lamb roast, indi
vidual quiches, and hearty
vegetable casseroles from
which to choose.
After deciding on the Stuffed
Filet of Sole ($6.50) and the
Lexington Lamb Dinner
($6.25), we were treated to the
light and delicate flavor of
freshly baked, hot popovers
served with whipped butter
and clover honey.
To our disappointment, the
two soups which followed
failed to capture the same old
fashioned goodness. Both the
Boston clam chowder and the
English beef and vegetable
broth were rather ordinary
preparations.
A choice of spinach, garden
or Boston lettuce salad also

comes with the lamb dinner.
Although notapartof the usual
colonial fare, I'm sure, my
selection of the spinach salad
was one even Ben Franklin
would have approved. Large,
young spinach leaves, chop
ped egg and bacon, sliced
mushrooms and an interesting
chedder cheese dressing made
for a delicious, if rather
Californian, accompaniment
to the popovers.
Dinner portions were sur
prisingly small. The Lexington
Lamb Popover is a cute idea but
somewhat unimaginatively
executed. Chunks of lamb and
vegetables blended in a mild
brown sauce fill an open-faced
popover; though not con
temptible, this dish is actually
little more than stew and bis
cuits under a new name. Given
more time (the Proud Popover
has been open for only two
weeks), I have confidence the
chef will make amends.
The Filet of Sole received
another "good but ..." ver
dict. Rolled around a lightly
seasoned shrimp stuffing and
sparingly topped with lemon
caper sauce, the sole was tasty
but not extraordinary.
Ratatouille of vegetables was
also served with the fish;
blended with Gruyere cheese
and thyme and basil season
ings, this zesty casserole was a
good example of creative
home cooking. Nevertheless,
one can't help but feel that cer
tain "pioneer spirit of adven

ture" is lacking in this colonial
kitchen.
And for dessert? How does
New England Blueberry Trifle
($1.75) — layers of vanilla
creme, blueberry preserves
and cake, laced with rum and
sprinkled with slivered al
monds — sound to you? Or
how about Lemon Bavarian
($1.50) set on a bed of ladyfin
gers and topped with juicy red
strawberries? Well, we tried
them both and loved them
equally.
Finally, our waiter, who was
appropriately dressed in New
England knickers and Pilgrim
boots, brought us glasses of
rather unexceptional Irish cof
fee.
Capitalizing on an authentic
historical setting and an im
aginative slant on the American
menu, the Proud Popover has
the potential to become a
noteworthy dining experience.
The makings are definitely
there.
Lunch is also featured with
only minor changes to the din
ner menu. Quiche Lorraine
and Fresh Mushroom Quiche
($3.50 each) are substituted for
someof the heartier dinneren
trees.
Brunch offerings, served
with hot popovers, butter and
honey, include a variety of
fresh egg entrees; Eggs Mon
ticello, Roast Beef Hash, and
Eggs goldenrod Popover are all
featured for $3.95.

Cathy Zelzer, owner of one of
Palo Alto's newest restaurants,
suggests, it's time for the
popover — the Proud Popover,
that is.
Against a contemporary
backdrop of shoe stores,
groceries, and high fashion,
the new Proud Popover in
Stanford Shopping Cener
brings to life the hospitality of
an old New England inn.
Named after the fluffy con
coction of eggs, milk, flour and
shortening which dates from

the days of the earliest settlers,
the Proud Popover features
more than just popovers. Be
sides five different stuffed
popover entrees, there is also
prime rib, lamb roast, indi
vidual quiches, and hearty
vegetable casseroles from
which to choose.
After deciding on the Stuffed
Filet of Sole ($6.50) and the
Lexington Lamb Dinner
($6.25), we were treated to the
light and delicate flavor of
freshly baked, hot popovers
served with whipped butter
and clover honey.
To our disappointment, the
two soups which followed
failed to capture the same old
fashioned goodness. Both the
Boston clam chowder and the
English beef and vegetable
broth were rather ordinary
preparations.
A choice of spinach, garden
or Boston lettuce salad also

comes with the lamb dinner.
Although notapartof the usual
colonial fare, I'm sure, my
selection of the spinach salad
was one even Ben Franklin
would have approved. Large,
young spinach leaves, chop
ped egg and bacon, sliced
mushrooms and an interesting
chedder cheese dressing made
for a delicious, if rather
Californian, accompaniment
to the popovers.
Dinner portions were sur
prisingly small. The Lexington
Lamb Popover is a cute idea but
somewhat unimaginatively
executed. Chunks of lamb and
vegetables blended in a mild
brown sauce fill an open-faced
popover; though not con
temptible, this dish is actually
little more than stew and bis
cuits under a new name. Given
more time (the Proud Popover
has been open for only two
weeks), I have confidence the
chef will make amends.
The Filet of Sole received
another "good but ..." ver
dict. Rolled around a lightly
seasoned shrimp stuffing and
sparingly topped with lemon
caper sauce, the sole was tasty
but not extraordinary.
Ratatouille of vegetables was
also served with the fish;
blended with Gruyere cheese
and thyme and basil season
ings, this zesty casserole was a
good example of creative
home cooking. Nevertheless,
one can't help but feel that cer
tain "pioneer spirit of adven

ture" is lacking in this colonial
kitchen.
And for dessert? How does
New England Blueberry Trifle
($1.75) — layers of vanilla
creme, blueberry preserves
and cake, laced with rum and
sprinkled with slivered al
monds — sound to you? Or
how about Lemon Bavarian
($1.50) set on a bed of ladyfin
gers and topped with juicy red
strawberries? Well, we tried
them both and loved them
equally.
Finally, our waiter, who was
appropriately dressed in New
England knickers and Pilgrim
boots, brought us glasses of
rather unexceptional Irish cof
fee.
Capitalizing on an authentic
historical setting and an im
aginative slant on the American
menu, the Proud Popover has
the potential to become a
noteworthy dining experience.
The makings are definitely
there.
Lunch is also featured with
only minor changes to the din
ner menu. Quiche Lorraine
and Fresh Mushroom Quiche
($3.50 each) are substituted for
someof the heartier dinneren
trees.
Brunch offerings, served
with hot popovers, butter and
honey, include a variety of
fresh egg entrees; Eggs Mon
ticello, Roast Beef Hash, and
Eggs goldenrod Popover are all
featured for $3.95.
