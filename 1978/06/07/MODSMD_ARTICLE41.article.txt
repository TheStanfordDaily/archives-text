# No surprises at Holiday Inn Sunday brunch

In a hotel restaurant, one
would hardly expect to find an
excellent meal, but the Holiday
Inn's Sunday brunch is an ex
ception. Upon entering the re
staurant, we were over
whelmed by the sight of the
prominently placed buffet ta
ble. Sitting under a large
skylight, laden with food and
accented by silver candelabras
and big bunches of grapes, the
table looked like it had been
set for a feast.
After having toasted one
another over a complimentary
glass of champagne, we took
advantage of the invitation to
eat as much as we possibly
could.
Moving across the table, we
sampled a variety of breads and
muffins, all of which, accord
ing to Executive Chef David

Asher-Tournant, are freshly
baked in the restaurant. Al
though the banana bread was
somewhat ordinary, the
French croissants were buttery
and crisp. Prune and orange
flake muffins were enjoyable
novelties for us. The highlights
were fresh Danish pastries fil
led with cinnamon apples,
strawberry jelly or custard.
They were all so moist that we
could not resist going back for
seconds and thirds.
One special treat was the
baked pears. According to
Asher-Tournant, the pears are
soaked overnight in a sugar
syrup, stuffed with raisins and
then baked. As a result, they

were soft and grainy and had
the delicious taste of cinna
mon.
We next piled our plates with
fresh fruit from the 25 bowls
which covered the table. Not
only were there popular fruits
like oranges, strawberries,
cantaloup, grapefruit and
watermelon offered, but also
more i.'nusual fruits such as
papaya and mandarin oranges.
After a second serving of
fruit and pastry, we moved to
the hot entrees. Accompany
ing sausage, perfectly crisp
bacon and hash browns were
creamy scrambled eggs, dis
tinguished by a hint of garlic.
Although neither of us are

fish lovers, we both enjoyed
the seafood salad, a mixture of
shrimp, scallops and mus
hrooms in a cheese sauce. We
found that the muffin Of the
Eggs Benedict, unfortunately,
was dry and hard to cut which
detracted from the gooey
blend of cheese and egg.
The small chicken crepes
were definitely our favorite.
We each ate several of these
thin French pancakes. They
were filled with well-seasoned,
tender chicken and covered
with a cream sauce.
Feeling well-satisfied, we fi
nally turned to the table of des
serts. The excellent quantity
and quality reflected the spec

tacular meal. French cream
puffs decorated with icing and
the apple strudel were both
beautiful and delicious.
To end the meal, we had cool
and fluffy vanilla custard and
the chocolate mousse.
All through our leisurely
meal we were pampered with
excellent service.
Open at 10 on Sunday morn
ing, the brunch attracts a
nicely-dressed clinetel, mainly
of convention members and
visitors.
One price of $6.25 is all
inclusive for this spectacular
meal.
