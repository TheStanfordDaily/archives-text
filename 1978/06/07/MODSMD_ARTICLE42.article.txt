# Clark to head track at Montana
## 
### John Foster 
After a decade as Stanford's
head cross country and assis
tant track coach, Marshall
Clark has decided to move on
and become the head track
coach and assistant athletic di
rector at the University of Mon
tana.
Over his past 10 years at
Stanford, Clark has been con
sidered one of the top coaches
of distance runners in the Un
ited States. This comes as no
surprise to those who know
anything about track and field.
Two of his former athletes
competed in the 1976 Olympic
Games in Montreal: Don Kar
dong in the marathon, and
Duncan McDonald in the 5000
meters. A third athlete of
Clark's, Tony Sandoval, was an
alternate (4th in the U.S.A.) for
the United States in the
Montreal Olympic Games.
It hasn't been easy develop
ing these champions while
coaching at a school like Stan
ford. The track team is limited
to roughly two scholarships a
year, and the average academic
load leaves most distance run
ners with a short span of time
each day for training. Despite
handicaps such as these, Clark
has continued to turn out good
crosscountry teams and excel
lent track distance runners.
In his very first year at Stan
ford, in 1968, Clark coached
the cross country team to an
undefeated season and second
place in the NCAA champion
ships. On that 1968 team, Clark
helped develop All-American
distance runners Greg Brock
and Brook Thomas. He later
worked with Brian Mittelstaedt
who became one of the best
milers in the U.S.A. at 4.00 mi
nutes.
Because of exploits such as
these, in 1972 he was elected to
coach a group of track athletes
that would compete against
the Soviet Union in Moscow.
Clark did not start at the in
ternational level though. After
graduating from USC in 1958,
he became head cross country
coach at Los Altos High School
in Southern California. After

six years, six league champion
ships and one state champion
ship, he moved on to Mon
terey's Seaside High. After one
year at Seaside he came to
Stanford.
How did this coach become
so good so quickly? Possibly
his rapport with student
athletes, and his coaching
techniques were developed
when he was a runner at USC.
Clark was one of the best 880
(half mile) runners in the na
tion at track powerhouse USC
and a member of the 1955
NCAA championship team. He
lettered for three years in track
and cross-country for the Tro
jans, then ran for the Southern
California Striders. He con
tinues to run today, and is one
of the best distance runners in
the United States in the mas
ters (over 40) track competi
tion.
In the last few years, Clark
has helped institute both a
women's cross-country team
and a women's track club at
Stanford. The women's cross
country team is now a varsity
sport.
Clark tends to draw the
world's best distance runners
to Stanford. Currently, former
Olympian and 5000 meter
American record holder Dun
can McDonald and 800 meter
Olympian Mike Boit from
Kenya workout at Stanford
under Clark. Beyond this, he
promotes distance running in
the Bay Area and at Stanford.
Stanford has hosted Pacific-8
cross country championships
consecutively for the past few
years.
Although he will be moving
on, the slender and soft spo
ken Clark still admits that "It
was not an easy decision to
leave Stanford. Most of all I will
miss the student athletes that
I've worked with."
Surely, Stanford will miss
coach Marshall Clark, too. He
has enhanced cross country,
track, conditioning and run
ning in general in his decade at
Stanford.

he has gone a long way.
