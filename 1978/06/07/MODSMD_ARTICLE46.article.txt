## Colorado to Athens, Ga. Sports year runs gamut 
### Bruce Anderson 
It began with the thoughtful steps of a silver
haired coaching genius pacing the sidelines in
Colorado and ended with the brash strut of a
teenage tennis prodigy claiming the NCAA sing
les crown.
It included the joyous end zone dance steps of
a gifted wide receiver and the dejected shuffle of
an entire basketball team. It noticed the bone
aching strides of a young woman running to
All-America cross country honors and the gait of
a patient batter walking his way into the record
books.
The 1977-78 Stanford sports year has now
stepped into the athletic chronicles. Like previ
ous years, the one just ended tested the gamut
of human emotions:
—The elation of Cardinal football fans upon
.seeing Darrin Nelson in early September and
realizing that Stanford at last had a running back
who could move like the wind and escape from
holds that would defy Houdini.
—The tension of the women's volleyball team
rebounding from a 14-5 deficit in the last game
of a playoff match with San Jose State to win
16-14 and advance to the AIAW regionals.
—The disappointment of the Card baseball
team, ranked No. 5 in the nation prior to the
conference opener, when it nosedived with a
6-12 mark in Pac-8.
—The pride of the women's basketball team
when it made the AIAW regional tournament it
hosted at Maples.
It was a year in which many new people left
their mark on Stanford athletics.
First-year football coach Bill Walsh removed
the fetters which had chained quarterback Guy
Benjamin and wide receiver James Lofton to the
bench the previous three seasons and in doing
so guided Stanford to a 9-3 season culminated
by a 24-14 Sun Bowl victory.
Freshmen paced both tennis teams. Kathy
lordan upset Trinity's Anne Smith to lead the
Cards past the Tigers and hand them their first
dual match loss ever. John McEnroe drew the
largest crowds in several years to the indoor
matches in Maples. The undefeated Cardinal
men won their fourth NCAA championship in
six years. After the team title, McEnroe added
the singles crown to his growing list of laurels.
Departed All-America water polo goalie Chris
Dorst was hardly missed when freshman John
Gansel assumed guard of the net this fall. The

poloists, top-seeded at nationals, fell to UC-
Irvine in the semifinals and relinquished the title
won in 1976.
Philadelphia transplant Barbara Longstreth, in
her first year on the Farm, coached the women's
field hockey team to a second-place finish in the
Western Regionals. Sophomore scotcher Nancy
White was named to the national field hockey
team.
Swimmers Kim Peyton and Valerie Lee defied
the sophomore jinx by placing in seven and six
events respectively at the AIAW meet and steer
ing the Cards to a third-place finish.
The injections of new blood vitalized many
sports, but the exodus of coaches and athletes
this spring will create a vacuum in some sports
next year.
Cross country coach Marshall Clark and vol
leyball coach Art Lambert both resigned this
spring. More startling, however, was the retire
ment announcement of Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz who will stay until a successor is found
next winter.
Senior Mike Peck, a product of Prairie Village,
Mo., concluded a brilliant four-year tenure with
the golf team. His collegiate golfing ac
complishments surpassed those of another
Prairie Village native who played golf for the
Cards — Tom Watson.
Tom Guardino smashed his way into the Pac-8
record books with 37 home runs during four
years here, none more dramatic than the solo
blast he hit in the 10th inning against UCLA this
year which gave Stanford a 8-7 victory over the
Bruins. Pepe Hinojosa, proving the truth in the
adage that a walk's as good as a hit, set a national
record with 212 career base on balls.
One of the finest athletes in the United States,
Lofton will have to adjust to catching a football
in the Green Bay cold. The first-draft pick ended
his collegiate career by winning the NCAA long
jump title with a Stanford record leap of 26-1134.
Senior Maggie Nelson leaves for Europe to
play pro basketball after becoming the first
women eager at Stanford to earn All-America
honors.
One of the major events to affect sports here
this year was one which never occurred — the
departure of Bill Walsh for the NFL. He stayed.
Everyone sighed and breathed easy.
He'll be here next year, pacing the sidelines,
beginning the year the way it should begin.
