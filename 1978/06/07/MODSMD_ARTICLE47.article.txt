# Lofton captures NCAA title
## 
### Chris Haft 
Only five Stanford athletes participated in last
weekend's NCAA track and field finals at
Eugene, Oregon, but three of them — james
Lofton, Darrin Nelson and Roy Kissin — distin
guished themselves in grand fashion.
As most everyone knows by now, Lofton
dominated the long jump competition, leaping
26-11% on his second attempt to capture first
place.
Nelson also shined in the long jump, breaking
Lofton's freshman record with a 25-5% effort in
Thursday's qualifying round.
Kissin, Stanford's excellent distance runner,
clocked 30:17.5 in the 10,000 meters for the
sixth-best showing among American runners
and twelfth-best over-all.
Coach Payton Jordan was pleased with Stan
ford's performance which made the Cards 16th
in the nation's collegiate track ladder.
"Considering over 300 schools compete in
track, 16th isn't bad," said Jordan. "We had a
very small group, and we got two Ail-Americans
(Lofton and Kissin) out of that bunch."
The usually loquacious Jordan was humbled
by Lofton's heroics. "James was the most impre
ssive athlete in the meet," Jordan marveled.
"Superlatives are pretty hard to come by when
you talk about him, but as a captain, leader and
competitor, very few are his peer."
If it weren't for the wind, which exceeded the
allowable limit by .1 meter per second, Lofton's

winning jump would have gone down as the
sixth best ever by an American.
"With the conditions, the competition, and
the crowd, my adrenalin was very high," said
Lofton. "But I could have jumped even better."
James will attempt to do just that Friday in Los
Angeles at the AAU finals.
Though he had been previously bothered by
injuries, Lofton felt fine while jumping. "The
tendons behind my knee were a little bit tight,
but they didn't hinder me. I was just hoping they
wouldn't pull."
Nelson was also physically prepared for his
NCAA finals debut. "I was ready to jump that
day,"he affirmed. "Because I was jumping last, I
had warmed up three times, so I was really
loose."
Besides erasing Lofton's first-year mark, Dar
rin also had a wind-aided 26%. He cited techni
cal faults for failing to place in the finals: "I was
actually jumping better, but my steps were off."
Nevertheless, Nelson's jumping enthused
Jordan. "It (Darrin's performance) was a tre
mendous tribute to his ability. It's remarkable
that a freshman could do so well against all those
great ones."
Kissin was matched against Kenyans, En
glishmen and other foreigners on his way to
claiming All-American status. "Roy was confi
dent and strong," Jordan stated. "He ran a very
solid race."
