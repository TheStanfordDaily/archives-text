# Benjamin to sign contract
## 
### Ddvid Georgette 
A National Football League
team's top draft pick can some
times be somewhat difficult to
sign, but in the case of Stanford
quarterback Guy Benjamin —
the Miami Dolphins' top
choice in last month's draft —
reaching an agreement did not
take too long.
Benjamin will jet to Miami
Sunday for a Monday press
conference and the official
signing of his contract. Benja
min, represented by attorney
Leigh Steinberg of Los
Angeles, reached a verbal ag
reement with Miami last week.
Benjamin was the third Stan
ford player taken in the draft,
going to the Dolphins on the
second round. Miami had no
first-round pick. The two Car
dinals taken on the first round
— wide receiver James Lofton
by Green Bay and offensive
tackle Gordon King by the New
York Giants — have both re
jected the initial offer by their
teams. Wide receiver Bill Kel
lar, the fourth Card drafted,
signed with Kansas City last
week. Kellar was a seventh
round pick.
Benjamin's three-year ag
reement is estimated to be
worth a minimum of $215,000,
and is the best ever given to a
Dolphin rookie. It also exceeds
the ones given the two quar
terbacks taken in the first

round of last year's draft —
Tommy Kramer (Rice), who
went to Minnesota, and Steve
Pizarkewicz (Missouri), who
went to St. Louis — as well as
most of those agreed to by
other second round picks this
year.
"The contract was settled in
a matter of three or four days,"
said Benjamin. "It was an ag
reement both parties reached
amicably."
The Dolphins' initial offer
was turned down, and Benja
min said, "I was about ready to
apply to graduate school be
cause it's not worth only that
much to go out and get beat
up." The second day, though,
Benjamin said the Dolphins
nearly doubled their offer.
"The time sequence was
speeded up drastically because
of the Canadian Football
League," said Steinberg.
"The base salary is elastic,
depending upon how much I
play," said Benjamin. "If I do
start by the end of the third
year, it would be comparable
to (Steve) Bartowski and
(Richard) Todd. So if I do start, I
will be fairly well compen
sated."
Trying to cope
But in beginning a career that
could see him enjoying a large
income each year for possibly
as many as 10 years, Benjamin
said, "I've had a hard time try

ing to cope with it. I don't want
to live a life where people say,
'Oh, you're an athlete takingall
that mon£y.' I've been a very
nonmaterialistic person, and
have been living in a simple
way. You only need one car
and you can only live in one
house at a time. At Stanford I
was living on $3000 or $4000 a
year for a few years, and I had a
great time."
So what is Benjamin going to
do now that he will have a lot
more money to live on than
what an athletic scholarship
provides? "I would really have
to work hard to spend more
than $20,000 a year," he said.
"I'm going to set up a budget I
can live by. I'd like to buy a
house and furnish it, and then
there's food. I'll also invest
some of it to get something to
show for the years I spend in
football. But altogether that's
not a whole lot. There's not as
much as people would think."
As Benjamin said, "Football
is so insecure a profession. I
spent the biggest part of my life
trying to play football, and I
have something that's gonna
last me 10 years. Someone who
has spent most of their life try
ing preparing to be a lawyer
has something he can do the
rest of his life.
"Hopefully, I kept both
doors open. If I messed up, I
think I could still get into a law
school."
Taxes hurt
Benjamin said though he ex
pects about half of his income
to go to taxes, he chose to take
the money over the next three
years instead of receiving de
ferred payments because not
only would inflation eat away at
deferments, in addition "I
would rather help people out
than have the owners sit there
hoarding the money."
Benjamin, like most of the
athletes Steinberg represents,
has an agreement with the at
torney to put part of his income
derived from football into the
communities he's played in.
Benjamin intends to contribute
to a scholarship fund at Mon
roe High School in Los Angeles

where he played before com
ing to Stanford, and also to the
Buck Club, which is the source
of athletic scholarships at Stan
ford. In Miami, he said he is
going to aid Greenpeace and
solar power advocacy groups.
"It's worthwhile to do some
thing to stop putting nuclear
reactors all around the uni
verse," he said.
Not soon
Steinberg also is represent
ing King and Kellar. "We're in
the middle of a fairly extended
discussion with the New York
Giants," said Steinberg. "Their
first offer was unacceptable.
We're probably in for a long
negotiation."
Steinberg will meet with
Giants' executive Andy Robus
telli tomorrow in Los Angeles.
"We'll see where we go from
here," said Steinberg.
"So far I've been a little sur
prised and a little disappointed
at the slowness of negotia
tions," said King. "I'm pre
pared to wait, and even to hold
out — though I don't want to —
until an offer is made that's of
competitive market value."
Steinberg indicated he had
contacted Montreal of the Cf"L
about King, but he added,
"Our goal is to make Gordon
one of the highest paid rookie
linemen in NFL history."
Lofton also rejected the Pac
kers' initial offer, but he said
the negotiations are "coming
along all right." He said the
Packers have increased their
offers, and expects to reach an
agreement within the next few
weeks.
Kellar signed a three-year
pact with the Chiefs valued at
about $120,000. "It's an excel
lent contract and very I ucrative
for his round," said Steinberg.
"Part of it was because of the
rivalry between Edmonton (of
the CFL) and the Chiefs."
Kellar also made an impres
sion upon the Chiefs with a
good performance in their
rookie camp."I feel much
more confident of making the
team and contributing," he
said.

You might see Guy Benjamin doing something like this next fall, but he'll be wearing a Miami Dolphins
uniform instead of the familiar Cardinal red. Benjamin will travel to the land of Flipper Sunday to
announce the signing of his new contract.
