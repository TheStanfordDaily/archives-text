# Card lacrosse bridging coasts

Here's a question for all you sports trivia buffs. What women's
team at Stanford had an 8-0 record, won two tournaments and
placed four women on an All-California All-Star team?
Would you believe the women's lacrosse team?
The next question you might have is what is women's lacrosse,
anyway? Stanford coach Barbara Longstreth describes it as "the
fastest game on two feet" and"the most pleasing spectator
sport." Originally an Indian game, lacrosse play is similar to
soccer or field hockey in movement and scoring but is a throwing
and catching game,played with netted sticks.
Although Longstreth says that "lacrosse is predominantly an
Eastern sport," the energetic coach has done much to introduce
the sport on the West Coast and especially at Stanford where
players fall into two groups — those who learned the game at
prep schools back East and those who learned the game on Roble
Field. Besides teaching and coaching Stanford players,
Longstreth has also helped organize the seven lacrosse clubs in
the state and competitions between the teams.
"I feel a little like a pioneer," she said. "Lacrosse is new here
but Stanford is bridging the gap between the East and the West."
"I can't believe how fast the game has caught on here," player
Liz Maxwell commented. A freshman from Pennsylvania, Max
well, who played lacrosse in high school, made the All California
team and was a leading scorer on the squad. Other women
selected to the all-star team were Onnie Killifer, Kathy Levinson
and Buffie Burger. Freshman Carey Kelly received honorable men
tion.
Although most of the California teams are in developing stages,
Stanford's young team performed surprisingly well in the Satur
day morning matches. And since many of the players are
freshmen and sophomores, Longstreth has high hopes for future
teams. "I would hope that we would be recognized as a viable
sport and be supported, not necessarily financially, in our efforts
to compete and develop the game," she said. She also hopes to
take a Stanford team to the National Collegiate Championship
next year.
Whether it was Longstreth's leadership, the natural beauty of
the game, the enthusiasm of the players or "beginner's luck" as
one player suggested, lacrosse has come of age on the Stanford
campus. The main problem future teams may have will be trying
to equal the excellent record the 1977-78 team posted in their first
organized season.
