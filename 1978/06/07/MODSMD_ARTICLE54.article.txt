# Busy legal year at Medical Center
## 
### Andrea lames 
While the FBI closed its case against one Univer
sity employee, the State Board of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA) subpoenaed the University for
information on its medical services plan. And
while a radiologist agreed to drop his lawsuit
against Stanford, the Hospital's general foreman
filed a $1.2 million suit against the school.
University counsel at the Medical School has
indeed been busy this year, but in the eyes of Carl
Hitchner, associate staff counsel at the medical
center legal department, there was nothing un
ique about the legal problems.
"There were about the same number of cases
this year as in past years," he said.
In October, the Daily learned of an FBI investiga
tion into the alleged fraudulent research of Assoc.
Prof, of Surgery Zoltan Lucas.
Lucas is suspected of publishing inaccurate re
ports while working for the University under a
National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant.
The FBI has since closed its files on the matter
and has turned all materials over to the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Welfare, according
to Joe Erran, public relations spokesman at the FBI
office in San Francisco.
Counsel was also preoccupied this year with the
alleged double billing procedures at the Stanford

Medical Center.
BMQA issued a subpoena asking for a "very
extensive set of records" dealing with the Univer
sity's distribution of physicians' professional fees,
according to administrators here.
The University has complied with the subpoena.
Section 2008 of the California Business Code
states that medical schools and institutions cannot
charge for professional services rendered pa
tients.
The University claims its billing procedures are
within the law because the hospital is an owned
subsidiary of the University and faculty physicians
are employed by the University and not by the
hospital.
Meanwhile, a Palo Alto radiologist who claimed
he was denied a fair hearing before the board of
hospital directors when he applied for member
ship on the hospital staff, dropped his lawsuit
when it was agreed he would be recommended for
an appointment to the medical staff.
The radiologist, William Hayden, is now a staff
member of Stanford Hospital.
But the main issue of the case, the hospital's
"closed staff rule," is still being discussed by the
board, according to Gale Mondry, assistant coun
sel for medical affairs.
The closed staff rule means "the staff is not open

to every physician wanting to be on the staff,"
according to University counsel John Schwartz.
"Participating community physicians have to meet
certain conditions to be admitted."
But those conditions are not stipulated any
where.
Because of this the board is discussing the rule
and has refused to make any more appointments
to Hospital staff until a full review of the rule has
been made.
And while Hayden's suit against the University
was dropped, another $1.2 million damage suit
against the University and three Hospital facilities
administrators was filed.
Frank Petta, former chief engineer, and General
Foreman Conroe McCee claim the three adminis
trators "knowingly and willfully conspired" to di
vert materials and labor from the Hospital's con
struction projects "for their individual and mutual
use and benefit."
The three administrators named are lames Mc-
Nally, director of facilities; William Ferguson,
chief engineer; and David Dominguez, general
foreman.
This suit is being handled by outside attorneys,
Hitchner said.
The case is still pending and there is no estimate
of when it will be resolved.
