One day in 1886, while
Senator Stanford strolled the
construction sites of his new
University, his prized gold watch
slipped through a hole in his
pocket and into the dirt. Unfor
tunately, Stanford didn't notice
the loss for some time, and the
watch remains somewhere, a
few inches beneath the Univer
sity.
Repeated efforts to locate the
watch have failed; massive exca
vations in parking lots behind the
Bookstore and Main Library have
been the most recent.
The newest stab in the dirt is
an area adjoining Jordan Quad;
workers have been digging in
vain since last month. If the
search is again unsuccessful,
another University building will
be constructed on the site. And
the search goes on. (Daily photo
