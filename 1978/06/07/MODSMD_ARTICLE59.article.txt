# Trustees to consider several building plans
## 
### 
Various building project proposals
will consume most of the University
trustees' time as the board meets for
the final time this academic year on
Friday, June 16.
Building projects to receive board
consideration include a $10.6 million
reconstruction of Building 120 of the
Quad, a $200,000 addition to the
Bowman Alumni House and Phase I
of the $2 million Jackson Library ex
pansion at the Graduate School of
Business (GSB).
The board is expected to approve
the $10.6 million budget and give au
thorization to proceed with con
struction drawings and bid solicita
tion on the reconstruction of Build
ing 120. The sociology building re
construction should be complete in
mid-September 1981.
The Bowman expansion, to be
completed next February, will add an
additional 2000 square feet of office
space and conference rooms to the
facility.
Phase I of the Jackson Library pro
ject is a $488,000 start of the $2 million
expansion expected to be approved
in September. The expansion will
consist of adding a third floor to the
GSB.

When the CSB was built in 1964,
the building was designed to allow
construction of a third floor above
the library portion of the structure.
Also coming before the board will
be renewal of the lease to the Mobil
Oil station on Page Mill Road at El
Camino Real, new leases to
Wheatley-Jacobsen in the Industrial
Park and to a Christmas tree interest
on University land in San Mateo.
The board will lease land to
Wheatley-Jacobsen, which will
probably sublease it to Xerox Corp.
for a 20-year period.
Also, the trustees will probably
approve leasing a 150-acre parcel of
land to a Christmas tree grower. The
land is located between the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and Sand
Hill Road, and income will be used to
help defer some of the property tax
burden on the University.
The board is also expected to ap
prove the budgets of the athletic de
partment, Tresidder Union, Student
Housing, Food Service and the Stan
ford University Press for the coming
year.
The auxiliary services budgets are
expected to total some $21.5 million.
