# Who's got your number? Anyone who wants it.

### David Ansley 
If I wanted to know your medical
record, your credit rating, how much
you had in the bank or who you cal
led last April 26, I could do so —
without your permission or know
ledge, and without much trouble.
How do I know?
It was done to me.
Last weekend I was handed a dos
sier on myself which included some
minute details of my life: the fact that
I am not adopted, a list of all the clubs
I joined in high school (and how long
I was a member), the fact that I dis
cussed medical deferments from the
draft with a doctor at Cowell on April
14,1975, and that I called a particular
family in Richmond three times last
April 26 from my touch-tone phone
(with a 25-foot cord).
Fortunately, the file was compiled
with my knowledge. Unfortunately,
it needn't have been.
Six students in a spring quarter
course here, Modern Technology
and the Invasion of Privacy, used me
as a guinea pig and discovered that
chutzpah and a good story are all one
needs to find the most intimate in
formation about any person.
Inside connections or impressive
credentials aren't necessary to go
digging:
—With a good story and a forged
signature, I could obtain your com
plete medical records.
—If you don't bank at Wells Fargo,
I could find out your bank balance

with just a phone call.
—If you have a charge card or have
ever borrowed money from a bank, a
letterwould get meyourentirecredit
history.
—Your social security number
might as well be published, it's so
accessible. With those nine digits
and a phony signature, I could send
away to the government for a list of
all your earnings.
—And Pacific Telephone seems
remarkably willing to tell me every
long distance number you dialed in
the last six months — and the name
of the persons or companies you cal
led.
The ploys the class used to elicit
facts usually meant posing as me
over the phone or in person. In a few
cases they impersonated a personnel
director considering me for a job.
"Persistence and a convincing story
almost always worked," they re
ported.
While there is little danger in a
class project, nothing stops govern
ment agencies, insurance companies
(who often pay dearly for this sort of
information), private investigators or
someone with less-than-legal mo
tives from doing the same thing.
"We were six students who had no
idea of how to go about it, and we
could do much better now," said one
class member. "But someone who
had any authority could get all this
information in a matter of hours."
When the project ended last week,

the students were on the verge of
obtaining a copy of my birth certifi
cate, with which they could have
started creating files with my name
on them: bank accounts, new
driver's licenses, credit cards, etc.
"Files . . . can be a gold mine for
the would-be criminal," the stu
dents' report said. "Armed with a

birth certificate, social security
number and bank account number,
one can create a new identity and use
it to lessen his chance of being
caught."
The only scrap of information
keeping them from my birth certifi
cate was my mother's maiden name,
a traditionally secure "password"

used to verify that the right person is
seeking the records. Not knowing
her name kept them from my check
ing account records too; Wells Fargo
was the only local bank that insisted
on hearing it before answering ques
tions over the phone.
But the big break should be in the
mail already; a secretary at my high
school thinks she is sending my
grade point average, scholastic ap
titude test scores and parents' full
names to a prospective employer.
Criminal records and copies of
checks are the most difficult items to
obtain, reported the class. Individu
als usually have to request police
files in person and present identifica
tion.
Copies of checks (the bank has five
years'worth on microfilm) can be ob
tained with subpoenas.
Stanford administrators will be
pleased to know that, with the excep
tion of my medical records, all my
files — application and registration
documents and student petitions —
were inaccessible.
Among the documents included in
the report was a copy of my transcript
(with the notation "needs 14 units
this quarter to graduate"). But that
was obtained by tricking me into
lending out my Stanford ID card,
which was then used by someone
pretending to be me.
One strong safeguard for personal
records seems to be clerical incom
petence. When "I" telephoned

them, seeking information on my
self, neither my home bank nor my
automobile club (which has insur
ance and driving records) could find
any of my records.
The students have suggested sev
eral ways to minimize the misuse of
personal files. They suggest that you
keep all your identification numbers
and cards secure, determine who
maintains files concerning you, re
quest copies of those files to insure
their accuracy, and ask those who
maintain files to keep them from un
authorized persons.
But once the key pieces of infor
mation (full legal name, birthdate
and birthplace, social security
number, mother's maiden name) are
obtained, stated the student report,
"the information gathering process
becomes routine. There is little data
that these items and a 'signed' waiver
will not uncover."
The students conclude, "There is a
certain point where all this informa
tion becomes irrelevant. Persons and
institutions do not really care how
much John Doe owes his bank, how
much he earned in 1971 or whether
he is a diabetic. The information is
available in many ways and at many
levels but may never be obtained un
less he comes under government
scrutiny, applies for a loan, applies
for a job or becomes the mark of a
ripoff artist. At that point, his privacy
is no longer his own, and he is vul
nerable."

long distance number you dialed in
the last six months — and the name
of the persons or companies you cal
led.
The ploys the class used to elicit
facts usually meant posing as me
over the phone or in person. In a few
cases they impersonated a personnel
director considering me for a job.
"Persistence and a convincing story
almost always worked," they re
ported.
While there is little danger in a
class project, nothing stops govern
ment agencies, insurance companies
(who often pay dearly for this sort of
information), private investigators or
someone with less-than-legal mo
tives from doing the same thing.
"We were six students who had no
idea of how to go about it, and we
could do much better now," said one
class member. "But someone who
had any authority could get all this
information in a matter of hours."
When the project ended last week,

the students were on the verge of
obtaining a copy of my birth certifi
cate, with which they could have
started creating files with my name
on them: bank accounts, new
driver's licenses, credit cards, etc.
"Files . . . can be a gold mine for
the would-be criminal," the stu
dents' report said. "Armed with a

birth certificate, social security
number and bank account number,
one can create a new identity and use
it to lessen his chance of being
caught."
The only scrap of information
keeping them from my birth certifi
cate was my mother's maiden name,
a traditionally secure "password"

used to verify that the right person is
seeking the records. Not knowing
her name kept them from my check
ing account records too; Wells Fargo
was the only local bank that insisted
on hearing it before answering ques
tions over the phone.
But the big break should be in the
mail already; a secretary at my high
school thinks she is sending my
grade point average, scholastic ap
titude test scores and parents' full
names to a prospective employer.
Criminal records and copies of
checks are the most difficult items to
obtain, reported the class. Individu
als usually have to request police
files in person and present identifica
tion.
Copies of checks (the bank has five
years'worth on microfilm) can be ob
tained with subpoenas.
Stanford administrators will be
pleased to know that, with the excep
tion of my medical records, all my
files — application and registration
documents and student petitions —
were inaccessible.
Among the documents included in
the report was a copy of my transcript
(with the notation "needs 14 units
this quarter to graduate"). But that
was obtained by tricking me into
lending out my Stanford ID card,
which was then used by someone
pretending to be me.
One strong safeguard for personal
records seems to be clerical incom
petence. When "I" telephoned

them, seeking information on my
self, neither my home bank nor my
automobile club (which has insur
ance and driving records) could find
any of my records.
The students have suggested sev
eral ways to minimize the misuse of
personal files. They suggest that you
keep all your identification numbers
and cards secure, determine who
maintains files concerning you, re
quest copies of those files to insure
their accuracy, and ask those who
maintain files to keep them from un
authorized persons.
But once the key pieces of infor
mation (full legal name, birthdate
and birthplace, social security
number, mother's maiden name) are
obtained, stated the student report,
"the information gathering process
becomes routine. There is little data
that these items and a 'signed' waiver
will not uncover."
The students conclude, "There is a
certain point where all this informa
tion becomes irrelevant. Persons and
institutions do not really care how
much John Doe owes his bank, how
much he earned in 1971 or whether
he is a diabetic. The information is
available in many ways and at many
levels but may never be obtained un
less he comes under government
scrutiny, applies for a loan, applies
for a job or becomes the mark of a
ripoff artist. At that point, his privacy
is no longer his own, and he is vul
nerable."

If I wanted to know your medical
record, your credit rating, how much
you had in the bank or who you cal
led last April 26, I could do so —
without your permission or know
ledge, and without much trouble.
How do I know?
It was done to me.
Last weekend I was handed a dos
sier on myself which included some
minute details of my life: the fact that
I am not adopted, a list of all the clubs
I joined in high school (and how long
I was a member), the fact that I dis
cussed medical deferments from the
draft with a doctor at Cowell on April
14,1975, and that I called a particular
family in Richmond three times last
April 26 from my touch-tone phone
(with a 25-foot cord).
Fortunately, the file was compiled
with my knowledge. Unfortunately,
it needn't have been.
Six students in a spring quarter
course here, Modern Technology
and the Invasion of Privacy, used me
as a guinea pig and discovered that
chutzpah and a good story are all one
needs to find the most intimate in
formation about any person.
Inside connections or impressive
credentials aren't necessary to go
digging:
—With a good story and a forged
signature, I could obtain your com
plete medical records.
—If you don't bank at Wells Fargo,
I could find out your bank balance

with just a phone call.
—If you have a charge card or have
ever borrowed money from a bank, a
letterwould get meyourentirecredit
history.
—Your social security number
might as well be published, it's so
accessible. With those nine digits
and a phony signature, I could send
away to the government for a list of
all your earnings.
—And Pacific Telephone seems
remarkably willing to tell me every
long distance number you dialed in
the last six months — and the name
of the persons or companies you cal
