# Rape and the Stanford community: a 'Daily' forum
## Victim tells of attempted rape 
### 
Morimoto

As a victim of attempted rape on
campus, I would like to lend support
to recent efforts to inform the Stan
ford community of incidents of rape
on campus. Every day women are
clearly exposed to situations in
which they must choose between
their relative degress of safety and
independence. This decision cannot
be made intelligently if women are
being misled or misinformed about
the levels of risk they face.
There seems to be a growing sen
timent that rape education projects
create a feeling of paranoia. It has
been my experience that informed
women are much less likely to feel
that "all men are potential rapists"
, than those who are forced to learn
about rape at the point of a knife. I
i hope then, that the innocent have
[nothing to fear in anything I am
| about to say.
The woman who is assaulted at
I Stanford is clearly not just the person
i who is caught walking alone down
i Palm Drive at midnight. I, for one,
j, was sleeping in my dorm at four
thirty in the morning when a man
slashed the window screen and held
,a knife to my back. I do not believe
my incident was so unprecedented.
Dorms — obvious targets
If you think about it, the dorm is an
| understandable choice for the rapist
in terms of accessibility. The relative
risk for the assailant is not a great as
one may think. People are misled by
Hollywood portrayals of rape. A
sleeping person can be pinned and
gagged almost instantaneously with
out the knowledge of someone who
is literally in the same room.
A number of factors can contribute
to the underreporting of rape on
campus. Informing the community
about a rapist need not be at the ex
pense of the individual's safety, but it
can be. From a victim's point of view,
the fear of retaliation can be easily
taken lightly by those who have no
thing at stake. A victim is constantly
confronted with people who are wil
ling to sacrifice the victim's safety on
behalf of the larger community,
i Social factors, in addition to the
fear of retaliation are linked to the
underreporting of rape. In a close
living situation there can be many
painful consequences, particularly if
•a member of the house is suspect.
Although this was not the situation in
my case, I am often forced to deal
»vith comments from men such as,
'Well, Mary, I better get out of your
'oom now before you call the
aolice."
tNo report completely confidential
There is no such thing as a com
letely confidential report to the
olice. The press has access to all

routine reports, although details and
names may be withheld. While I
agree that this is necessary, I believe
that we cannot hope victims will
come forth with information, if we
expose them to media members
whose methods of interrogation are
insensitive and abusive.
I hope victims wishing to come
forth will take heart in the fact that
the Daily for one, has made progress
in treating victims with compassion
since my incident.
I wish I could offer equal encour
agement to other victims in telling
them what to expect in the police
interrogations. The officers I dealt
with were generally considerate and
kind. But despite their good inten
tions their lack of adequate training
in the area and their administrative
problems made the situation
exhausting and at times painful.
I was asked to lie on the bed and
reinact the scene. I was told by a de
tective, "Mary, if you looked like a
refrigerator none of this would have
happened." ! was warned my friends
could be interrogated about my past
sexual history. My room was de
stroyed in a barage of black finger
print dust.
Openness to change
Since my incident, I feel the police
have shown concern, and an open
ness to change. I am trying to in
crease efforts to get a female officer
on call at night. The single woman on
the Stanford police force is only on
duty during the day. I had constantly
asked to see her, and I was told she
was only available by appointment
for dorm talks. Women should not
have to suffer for an overlap in re
sponsibilities by being forced to
answer the same questions countless
times.
Self-defense groups on campus
have definitely made progress in in
creasing women's chances to
escape from a rape situation un
harmed. Traditionally, the police
have told women to kick for the groin
or submit. That doesn't help. How
ever, teaching women to fight from
the ground, particularly in a face
down pin or a position where they
won't get a clear shot at the groin
area is an advancement.
Advising women in dorms to try to
get to the windows and break them if
screaming might anger the assailant
is also an option, given that ironically
people in dorms often don't take
screaming seriously.
But all the discussion groups on
rape education are no substitution
for positive administrative action to
protect women regardless of their
level of awareness. If you have not
been convinced of that bv now, my

advice to you is, "don't get hurt at
Stanford."
Still afraid
If I had to choose one thing to tell
other victims and the public about
how I feel as an assault victim at Stan
ford, it would be this: I have not cho
sen to do this because I have stopped
being afraid. The psychological af
termath is nothing but a phrase to
some people. To me, it means not
being able to sleep on suffocating
hot nights without the window
closed and locked.
It means having to get up at three
to check the closets and under the
bed. The wound that will never go
away is partially from having to
realize in one night that my life can
be taken in a single undeserved and
unpredictable burst of violence.
But worse than that would be the
feeling I would have to live with just
knowing what other women would
suffer at Stanford, if I didn't speak
up. If you are a victim of sexual as
sault at Stanford, I hope you will feel
the same.
