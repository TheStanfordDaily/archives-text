# Easing the reporting process

Rape is one of the most difficult crimes to investigate.
The victim goes through the most frightening, traumatic
experience of her life. After the attack, she must face
questioning, physical examination and re-questioning
by police, physicians, lawyers and investigators about an
event that she would like to blot out of her memory. No
matter how carefully the crime is investigated, the victim
must face a difficult process.
We have been fortunate in the Stanford Community to
have a very low number of reported rapes each year. I
emphasize "reported" because we do know that some
cases go unreported. It is impossible for us to determine
the actual number, but we estimate that there are at least
as many unreported as reported.
Over the past three to four years, officers from our
department have tried several approaches in our rape
prevention efforts. Written handouts, speeches, work
shops and dorm talks are the mainstays of the program.
These efforts are partially successful, but, as with any
crime prevention program, most people think, "It won't
happen to me." I believe our most successful preven
tion efforts have been the discussion sessions presented
by Sergeant Deborah Marinaro and an increasingly ag
gressive police patrol.
Marinaro covers several kinds of prevention as well as
escape tactics to use when attacked. Our patrol units
have been alerted to increase coverage of problem areas
and check out individuals loitering in areas that have a
high incidence of sex related offenses. These efforts
have helped us alert potential victims of the danger and
we have arrested several individuals for minor sex re
lated crimes.

In the investigation of rape cases, we are improving
and refining our procedures to minimize the trauma to
the victim and thereby encourage prompt reporting of
the crime. We have experienced some coordination
problems, in the past, because of overlapping police
jurisdiction.
However, with the help of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department, Cowell Student Health Center
and other University departments, we have developed a
procedure which should improve our investigative
technique. The sheriff has stated that he will make every
effort to provide a female deputy, to assist with the
investigation, if we do not have a female officer availa
ble. Uniformed officers have been instructed to gather
the minimum information needed for immediate pursuit
of the suspect and leave detailed questioning to the
follow-up team.
Cowell Health Center Counseling Service has assem
bled a group of trained counselors who are on call to
respond to rape cases. These counselors will assist the
victim through the initial and follow-up investigations.
We intend through these training and sensitizing ef
forts, to aid the victim by explaining each step of the
procedure and by helping her handle the emotional
problems that follow from the crime. Our goal is to aid
the victim in a way that will help her to deal with the
situation and assist us in preventing recurrences by
successfully prosecuting those responsible.
