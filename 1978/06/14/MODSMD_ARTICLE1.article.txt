## FDA head to address seniors 
### Kathy Trafton 
Donald Kennedy was chosen
as this year's commencement
speaker for his "popularity
with students and his long as
sociation with Stanford" as
well as for his current promi
nence as commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), said Senior Class Co-
President Clark Sterling.
Kennedy is on an official
two-year leave of absence from
the University, but he has
promised the Carter administ
ration he will remain with the
agency for at least four years.
Kennedy said he hopes his
leave of absence will be ex
tended, for "it has always been
my intention to return."
Before his departure last
March, Kennedy devoted
much time and effort to both
national and Stanford commit
tees, not the least of which was
his Chairmanship of the un
dergraduate Program in
Human Biology.
Three degrees
Kennedy, who holds three
degrees from Harvard includ
ing a Ph.D. in biology, rose

Regarding our nation's capital: . . They
have developed a remarkable civilization
considering the inhospitable nature of the
climate."

quickly through academia. He
was hired as a faculty member
at Syracuse University straight
out of Harvard, and moved to
Stanford four years later. He
was appointed chairman of the
Department of Biological Sci
ences here before he co
founded the Program in
Human Biology.
Kennedy was described by
one Washington colleague as
"the most intelligent commis
sioner in recent memory . . .
impatient with bureaucratic
thinking." Said another, "he is

abominably secure."
Kennedy said perhaps the
most difficult adjustment he
had to make between
academia and the real world
was a departure from the cer
titude with which scientists like
to deal.
'People are at risk'
"At the FDA we act on the
base of strong presumptions,
information that creates the
strong probability that people
are at risk and acting accord
ingly."
An additional challenge fac
ing him, Kennedy said, is "feel
ing independent of pressures"
from the entrenched bureauc
racy he inherited. His blueprint
for recharging the FDA in
cludes a major overhaul of its
internal management and a
consolidation of its facilities.
Kennedy oversees a staff of
7500 lawyers, scientists, in
spectors and secretaries, and
manages an annual budget of
$300 million. Intra-agency ten
sions are exacerbated by the
fact that agency offices and
laboratories are spread
throughout the Washington

area. Laboratories alone are in
17 separate sites.
Central role
Since his arrival in
Washington, Kennedy has
played a central role in the
proposed saccharin ban, the
Laetrile battle, the liquid pro
tein diet controversy and
changes in standards for ice
cream.
Kennedy and his agency are
caught between two powerful
forces: the need to furnish ef
fective, responsive regulation,
and the need to preserve indi

vidual and business rights. The
middle ground, according to
Kennedy, lies in the area of
providing information to pa
tients— patient labeling — and
to consumers — consumer
labeling.
"It's easy to do the right
thing," Kennedy said.
The FDA decreed last July
that women taking oral con
traceptives must be provided
with a lay language brochure
pointing out that estrogens
have been associated with
cancer of the uterus. And the
FDA also proposed ending the
routine addition of penicillin to
animal feeds.
Kennedy is "on top of every
thing. No one can rattle him
because he has his facts to
gether," said Tibby Simon,
administrative assistant for the
Program in Human Biology
here.
"He has tremendous
charisma and a marvelous facil
ity for remembering students'
names." She also said that he is
"very considerate."
Joie de vivre
In addition, Kennedy "pos
sesses a joie de vivre," Simon
said. "He was a constant
source of entertainment. Every
morning (when he was at Stan
ford) he'd bounce into the of
fice, and drink gallons of cof
fee with loads of sugar in it."
Students' anonymous evalu
ations of Kennedy's classes
were very positive, and from
these forms it is clear "he really
made students understand
(the material)," Simon said. He
possessed the uncanny ability
to divide his time between
teaching, research and ad
ministration without neglect
ing any area.
Two years ago, Kennedy re
ceived the Dinkelspiel award,
the University's highest honor
for outstanding service to un
dergraduate education. He
also holds the endowed Ben
jamin Scott Crocker professor
ship in human biology.
Kennedy possesses an un-

usual classroom style. A former
student said he is a dynamic
lecturer and that one of her
favorite moments was when
"Dr. Don got up on a table like
a dog to exhibit the dorsal and
ventral sides." She said he'd
"do it even when people didn't
laugh."
Impeccable credentials
Kennedy has impeccable
scientific credentials. He is a
member of the National
Academy of Sciences, the Insti
tute of Medicine and the
American Philosophical As
sociation.
A specialist in neurophysiol
ogy, Kennedy served on nati
nal committees dealing with
food and nutrition, and the ef
fects of pesticides on health
and the environment, prior to
his FDA appointment.
Despite the fact that Ken
nedy is the first non-physician
FDA commission in 12 years,
Peter Mutt, who was for several
years chief counsel to the FDA
said Kennedy's appointment
"upgrades the FDA beyond

anyone's wildest hopes."
Kennedy's recreational in
terests include skiing, trout
fishing and volleyball. The
slim, bespectacled 46-year-old
was a ski racer and coach when
he was at Harvard. Atone point
in his life he dreamed of be
coming a downhill racer.
Ironically, working with the
FDA has changed Kennedy's
exercise patterns but not his
eating habits. Because ot
Washington traffic patterns, he
said he is able to jog only on
weekends. And Kennedy still
enjoys dessert and sugar-laden
coffee.
He works longer hours at
Washington than he did here,
Kennedy said. He arrives for
work at 7 a.m. and usually
leaves at 7 in the evening.
Kennedy was a "very natural
choice" for commencement
speaker, Sterling said. This
year, unlike someothers, there
was not "much tension bet
ween the university and the
seniors on who they want."
