# Compassion and tolerance

### 
There can be no ques
tion in anyone's mind that
Stanford is a fine univer
sity — a fact that any mat
riculated student will at
test to! It might also be
added that in virtue of its
quality, it provides a
myriad of opportunities
for those interested in tak
ing advantage of them.
Aside from all of this, there
is another side to Stanford
— the Stanford whose par
ties abound, high-priced
drugs are accessible, and
racial and socio-economic
tensions run rampant in
the minds of the under
grad. What do these things
have in common? They are
all part of that pie-in-the
sky fantasy we all lovingly
refer to as, "The Stanford
Experience."

It is difficult for me to
view my "experience" in
any single light. As a
Chicano, I am well aware
of the inadequate mea
sures the university has
taken in meeting the
needs of Third World
people. As a concerned

student, I found the stu
dent body senate a moc
kery and a symposium for
those practicing to take
themselves too seriously.
As a male, I discovered the
Stanford meaning of "sex
ual freedom" — to be en
joyed whenever a woman
is ready, willing, and (on
rare occasion, unpreten
tious. And as a graduate
elect I am able to witness
the publication of possibly
the worst Stanford Quad
to date. But while these
provide discontent, they
have helped me appeciate
the positive points of a
Stanford education all the
more!
The caliber of faculty I
have encountered is excel
lent; the diversity of class
selection is impressive;
the overseas studies prog
ram is phenomenal; and
the facilities are befitting a
university of Stanford's
stature.
I suppose my life here
has been a pleasant one,
and one I have (more
times than not) taken for
granted. As'l prepare to
leave The Farm, I realize
that it has been more than
a school to me — it has
been a home. I have made
some very good friends
here. Friends from diverse
backgrounds, whose
primary reasons for being
here are to learn, experi
ence, and to prepare for a
career.
I have learned to accent
diversity and tolerate op
posing views as a result of
the friendships I have es
tablished. I have learned

to be compassionate by
listening. This is what
Stanford is all about. It is
that process which one
undergoes in developing
ideals. If you do not be
come tolerant of others
you have not listened to
them, and this is the an
tithesis of attempting to
learn. And if you have not
learned compassion, you
have not encountered the
experiences that this uni
versity, and its "cast of
thousands," has to offer.
For a person to attend
Stanford and not be toler
ant of others is indicative
of his/her close
mindedness. For a person
to come here and not be
compassionate when
he/she leaves is tan
tamount to saying, "I have
not learned from my ex
periences."

It is the intermingling of
minds that makes a uni
versity atmosphere a
haven for idealism. Unfor
tunately, all evidence
points to the unwanted
phenomena which awaits
us in the Real World, that
few people to|erate those
who have opposing views,
and just as few are even
compassionate epough to
listen to the tales of the
system-induced sufferings
of others. I fear we are
bound to experience that
phenomena and I only
hope I have the wisdom to
recognize a quagmire
when I am in one. Cer
tainly, The "Stanford Ex
perience" will provide a
reference for which to
deal with such matters.
