# A
						letter to the folks back home

### 
Dear Folks,
Well, I'm just about to com
plete my stay at Stanford. I
hope when I get home that you
all won't find I've changed that
much. I'm still the same, just a
little older, maybea littlewiser.
There were times during the
last few years when I didn't
think I'd make it. You all re
member how I told you my
freshman year about how dif
ferent Stanford is from home? I
was going through a lot in
those days. My self concept
was going through a storm. I
had been trained in schools to
master the white culture and
had absorbed a sense of black,
Chicano, and Third World cul
ture from you all and from
growing up in the projects in
Denver and working in the to
bacco fields of North Carolina.
But Stanford almost kicked
my behind. Many people here
seemed like machines, robots,
and zombies to me. And the
domination of the white,
affluent culture, both in the
type of courses offered and in
the social atmosphere and
ethnic makeup of Stanford,
was overwhelming at first. The
materialist/individualist in me
tried to make me conform, yet
the humanity in me wouldn't
allow it. My decision to retain
my natural culture and to work
for and with the community
here has determined the
course of my life.
I must apologize for neglect
ing all of you these last few
years. My commitment to my
family, the black community
here, has caused me to focus
on my immediate surround
ings. Yet, I know you all under
stand that my commitment to
the black and general com
munity here comes from the
values you all taught me. Also, I
felt that my commitment
would not only enable me to
share myself with people here,
but would also prepare me to
better understand the prob
lems of our people and form
some strategies for the future.
Somehow you have taught
me that our individual future is
tied to that of all our people.
Moreover, I have learned that
my future is tied to the future
of the folks here at Stanford, in
California, Colorado, in
Carolina, and even South Af
rica. I prepare to leave Stanford
with a strong sense of self and a
strong feeling of commitment
to my brothers and sisters,
here and back home.
You know, giving my time to
organizations like the BSU, the
ASSU, and the Black Media In
stitute have given me back ten
fold an understanding of
people. I guess you know as
well as I that we have our prob
lems. The times here that have
been the hardest for me have
been the times that I've had to
deal with some folks here who
have given up on themselves
or who have given in to the sys
tem, or who have forgotten or
never knew why they came
here and now seek to satisfy
their own selfish desires. I
guess, though, I had to learn
not to let those folks get me

down or make me lose sight of
what is real.
The best thing about Stan
ford has been the members of
the black Stanford family that
I've been able to work with.
Since I've been here, black
students have been working to
organize the BSU, the Black
House, the Black Activities
Center, the Committee on
Black Performing Arts; have
named the Black Cultural
Center "Ujamaa" (which is
Swahili for "familyhood"); have
created a Black Media Insti
tute, a Gospel Choir, the
Ujamaa Players, and the
Ujamaa Dancers; and have
begun to work toward unifying
the black community here.
Many black faculty and staff
have also helped me learn and
grow and have served as a
foundation for me and for the
community. Also, individuals
from the Asian, Chicano, na
tive American, and white Stan
ford communities have taught
me much about myself and
have often struggled with me
in solving our common prob
lems and challenging back
ward and inhumane systems,
policies and people.
But I hope you all know that I
could not have made it had it
not been for you back home.
You are the reason I came. You
are the reason I wish to help
build a new world based on our
values: Umoja (unity),
Kujichagulia (self
determination), Ujima (collec
tive work and responsibility),
Ujamaa (building and main
taining our own businesses
and profiting together, work
ing together as a family), Nia
(purpose), Kuumba (creativ
ity), and Imani (faith). Your
patience, understanding, help
and love along the way will not
be forgotten. Ail that I do now,
I do for you and our "family"
throughout the world.
Well, I guess I'd better close
before I start sounding like
Stanford folks â€” all serious
and heavy and rational.
All I'm really trying to say is
. . . thanks.
Love always,
Keith
