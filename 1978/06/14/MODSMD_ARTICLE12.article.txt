# Hoover House honored
## 
### Cynthia Santana 
The Lou Henry Hoover
House here, also known as the
President's House, was for
mally dedicated as a California
State Historical Landmark last
month.
In addition to being a former
United States president's
home, the house is also distin
guished by a unique style and
architecture, said Birge Clark.
As a young man, Clark worked
with his father, A.B. Clark, on
the design and construction of
the famous residence.
Clark, a 1914 Stanford
graduate, called the house a
"reflection of Mrs. Hoover
(who) was a free spirit, very
gracious and happy."
Clark recalled the architects'
attempts to meet Mrs.
Hoover's specifications for the

house. "The house is a product
of her requests. We could
never say 'but that isn't the way
it's done,' because Mrs.
Hoover would retort, 'well, it's
about time somebody did,' "
said Clark.
Clark said the Hoovers were
private people and felt their
home was of no concern to the
general public. Stanford fa
culty and students, however,
were treated like family.
Mrs. Hoover was friendly
with the faculty wives, Clark
said. Once she gave a tea party
on the roof and told her guests
to bring toasters so they could
have "nice fresh toast."
The electrical load of the
toasters partially blew out one
of the switches, resulting in a
220 watt charge in the rest of
the house's switches. Clark

was called over to fix the toas
ters, and arrived just in time to
keep young Allan Hoover from
blowing out all the lights on the
second floor.
"Allan had discovered that
when he switched on a light, it
would flare and blow. He was
going around saying 'Whoops,
there went that one too!" said
Clark.
An earthquake could seri
ously damage the house.There
are walls of hollow tile that
could easily pop out under an
earthquake of major propor
tions. Clark warned Mrs.
Hoover of this condition after
the 1925 Santa Barbara ear
thquake, but Mrs. Hoover only
said, "Oh, Birge, don't bother
about it. We've lived in far
more dangerous places around
the world and I'm not going to
lose any sleep over it."
"I've told each Stanford
president's wife about the
same thing, and they still stay
here in the house," said Clark.
