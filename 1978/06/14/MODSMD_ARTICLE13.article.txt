## After 33 years, sororities 
### Jill Liscom 
This year students witnessed
the return of a college tradition
which had been banned from
the University for over 33 years
— national sororities and
sorority rush.
Yet what the sororities are
emphasizing now is not to
carry on the old traditions, but
"to make sure sororities here
will be well-suited to the Stan
ford environment."
Faced with the legal issue of
providing equal opportunities
for selective housing to both
men and women, the Board of
Trustees deliberated on the
sorority issue for several
months. In December, the
trustees voted to amend the
ban to allow selective a 11 -

women's housing, instead of
lifting the ban on national
sororities.
Included in the amendment
were several stipulations re
garding the selection process.
The Board stressed maintain
ing local autonomy, which in
cluded disallowing the use of
letters of recommendation,
usually required by national
sororities.

Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons explained that the
University discourages selec
tive organizations because
"once a student is admitted on
merit, we feel that that student
should have access to every
aspect of student life and edu
cation.

"When a student is admit
ted, it is a time of growing up,
to be free to be whatever the
hell you want to be," Lyons
said. "It's an important thing to
happen. One must have free
will, free choice. Letters of re
ference are a form of pressure.
They limit that choice, and are
a form of discrimination."
Within a month after the ban
was amended, the first group
of nine women was pledged
into the Alpha Phi sorority.
During the next several
months, meetings between
sorority alumnae and students
were held on campus to ac
quaint students with the diffe
rent sororities and discuss how
they would be organized.
By spring quarter, six na
tional sorority colonies had
been organized, with mem
bership totaling almost 100
women. An Inter-Sorority
Council (ISC) was also formed
to unite the sororities and to
plan a formal spring rush.
The first sorority rush here
since 1944 took place from
April 10 to 21. The groups par
ticipating in rush were Alpha
Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta (Theta),
Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa
Gamma (Kappa), Pi Beta Phi (Pi
Phi), Chi Omega (Chi O).
Kappa Delta did not com
plete rush, and another soror
ity, Alpha Omicron Pi (A O Pi)
simultaneously held an infor
mal, independent rush be
cause they colonized too late
to be included in the formal
ISC rush.
Bids were issued to 148 wo
men, such that at the end of
rush, the sororities had about
250 student members. Kappa is
the largest group, with 71
members, and Theta and Alpha
Phi both have over 50 mem
bers.
No University recognition
So far, however, none of the
sororities have been recog
nized by the University.
According to Dean of Resi
dential Education Norm Robin
son, for an organization to be
recognized by the University it
must be either voluntary
(which does not apply to
sororities because of their
selective membership policy)
or residential. Robinson said a
specific process through which
sororities could be recognized
has not yet been determined.
Not being recognized by the
University has created some
problems for sororities. For in
stance, they are unable to use
classrooms and many other
University facilities as meeting
places. During their rush,
sororities were permitted to
use dorm lounges and dining
hails for activities only with the
consent of the house resi
dents.
Although several sororities
have asked about the proce
dure for getting on-campus
housing, no sorority has re
quested housing, said Robin
son. He estimated it would be
at least two or three years be
fore housing would be granted
to sororities.
Housing
According to Tammy
Ritrfiey, ne 1 ISC president,
"h using is robobly one of
u'timate goals, but it's not

an immediate goal."
An alternative proposed by
Lyons was establishing an ISC
eating lodge in one of the two
former eating clubs not for
mally assigned.
"One of the problems in
1942 was that sororities were in
competition with one another.
We're interested in seeing that
not happen again, so we en
courage activities for them to
cooperate with one another,"
commented Lyons.
Ritchey said the feasibility of
an eating lodge "depends on
how much the women of each
group want to actively seek to
get rid of the letter of reference
clause" imposed by most of
the national sororities. She
said the sororities must meet
some of the same require
ments for an eating club as for
housing, such as proving local
autonomy and not requiring
letters of recommendation.
'Positive' impressions
Row Director Karen Harri
son, who has been serving as
an advisor to the ISC, said her
impressions of sororities here
"are generally very positive.
"The seriousness with which
the ISC has dealt with some of
the major issues of being re
sponsive to student issues and
meeting Stanford students'
needs is very encouraging to
me," she commented.
However, she also said she
foresees "some real sticking
points," which include the
issue of letters of recommen
dation and determining "what
is alumnae advising versus
alumnae interference."
Regulations 'beneficial'
Ritchey said, "I don't see the
University stipulations as being
that big a problem. If the
women here really want some
thing badly enough, some
thing can be worked out.
"I think the University regu
lations are really good and in
the long run, will prove benefi
cial to the sororities."
"The people who have been
active, of student leaders, have
a good understanding of the
University principles," said
Robinson, "but I hope we're
able to pass that on to future
generations of students.
"We just have to be very
careful, so we won't wake up
one day to discover that
sororities are just like they are
at other schools, or how they
were in the past," he added.

not happen again, so we en
courage activities for them to
cooperate with one another,"
commented Lyons.
Ritchey said the feasibility of
an eating lodge "depends on
how much the women of each
group want to actively seek to
get rid of the letter of reference
clause" imposed by most of
the national sororities. She
said the sororities must meet
some of the same require
ments for an eating club as for
housing, such as proving local
autonomy and not requiring
letters of recommendation.
'Positive' impressions
Row Director Karen Harri
son, who has been serving as
an advisor to the ISC, said her
impressions of sororities here
"are generally very positive.
"The seriousness with which
the ISC has dealt with some of
the major issues of being re
sponsive to student issues and
meeting Stanford students'
needs is very encouraging to
me," she commented.
However, she also said she
foresees "some real sticking
points," which include the
issue of letters of recommen
dation and determining "what
is alumnae advising versus
alumnae interference."
Regulations 'beneficial'
Ritchey said, "I don't see the
University stipulations as being
that big a problem. If the
women here really want some
thing badly enough, some
thing can be worked out.
"I think the University regu
lations are really good and in
the long run, will prove benefi
cial to the sororities."
"The people who have been
active, of student leaders, have
a good understanding of the
University principles," said
Robinson, "but I hope we're
able to pass that on to future
generations of students.
"We just have to be very
careful, so we won't wake up
one day to discover that
sororities are just like they are
at other schools, or how they
were in the past," he added.

This year students witnessed
the return of a college tradition
which had been banned from
the University for over 33 years
— national sororities and
sorority rush.
Yet what the sororities are
emphasizing now is not to
carry on the old traditions, but
"to make sure sororities here
will be well-suited to the Stan
ford environment."
Faced with the legal issue of
providing equal opportunities
for selective housing to both
men and women, the Board of
Trustees deliberated on the
sorority issue for several
months. In December, the
trustees voted to amend the
ban to allow selective a 11 -

women's housing, instead of
lifting the ban on national
sororities.
Included in the amendment
were several stipulations re
garding the selection process.
The Board stressed maintain
ing local autonomy, which in
cluded disallowing the use of
letters of recommendation,
usually required by national
sororities.
Lyons explains
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons explained that the
University discourages selec
tive organizations because
"once a student is admitted on
merit, we feel that that student
should have access to every
aspect of student life and edu
cation.

"When a student is admit
ted, it is a time of growing up,
to be free to be whatever the
hell you want to be," Lyons
said. "It's an important thing to
happen. One must have free
will, free choice. Letters of re
ference are a form of pressure.
They limit that choice, and are
a form of discrimination."
Within a month after the ban
was amended, the first group
of nine women was pledged
into the Alpha Phi sorority.
During the next several
months, meetings between
sorority alumnae and students
were held on campus to ac
quaint students with the diffe
rent sororities and discuss how
they would be organized.
By spring quarter, six na
tional sorority colonies had
been organized, with mem
bership totaling almost 100
women. An Inter-Sorority
Council (ISC) was also formed
to unite the sororities and to
plan a formal spring rush.
The first sorority rush here
since 1944 took place from
April 10 to 21. The groups par
ticipating in rush were Alpha
Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta (Theta),
Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa
Gamma (Kappa), Pi Beta Phi (Pi
Phi), Chi Omega (Chi O).
Kappa Delta did not com
plete rush, and another soror
ity, Alpha Omicron Pi (A O Pi)
simultaneously held an infor
mal, independent rush be
cause they colonized too late
to be included in the formal
ISC rush.
Bids were issued to 148 wo
men, such that at the end of
rush, the sororities had about
250 student members. Kappa is
the largest group, with 71
members, and Theta and Alpha
Phi both have over 50 mem
bers.
No University recognition
So far, however, none of the
sororities have been recog
nized by the University.
According to Dean of Resi
dential Education Norm Robin
son, for an organization to be
recognized by the University it
must be either voluntary
(which does not apply to
sororities because of their
selective membership policy)
or residential. Robinson said a
specific process through which
sororities could be recognized
has not yet been determined.
Not being recognized by the
University has created some
problems for sororities. For in
stance, they are unable to use
classrooms and many other
University facilities as meeting
places. During their rush,
sororities were permitted to
use dorm lounges and dining
hails for activities only with the
consent of the house resi
dents.
Although several sororities
have asked about the proce
dure for getting on-campus
housing, no sorority has re
quested housing, said Robin
son. He estimated it would be
at least two or three years be
fore housing would be granted
to sororities.
Housing
According to Tammy
Ritrfiey, ne 1 ISC president,
"h using is robobly one of
u'timate goals, but it's not

an immediate goal."
An alternative proposed by
Lyons was establishing an ISC
eating lodge in one of the two
former eating clubs not for
mally assigned.
"One of the problems in
1942 was that sororities were in
competition with one another.
We're interested in seeing that
not happen again, so we en
courage activities for them to
cooperate with one another,"
commented Lyons.
