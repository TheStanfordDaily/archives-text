## After 33 years, sororities 
### Jill Liscom 
This year students witnessed
the return of a college tradition
which had been banned from
the University for over 33 years
â€” national sororities and
sorority rush.
Yet what the sororities are
emphasizing now is not to
carry on the old traditions, but
"to make sure sororities here
will be well-suited to the Stan
ford environment."
Faced with the legal issue of
providing equal opportunities
for selective housing to both
men and women, the Board of
Trustees deliberated on the
sorority issue for several
months. In December, the
trustees voted to amend the
ban to allow selective a 11 -

women's housing, instead of
lifting the ban on national
sororities.
Included in the amendment
were several stipulations re
garding the selection process.
The Board stressed maintain
ing local autonomy, which in
cluded disallowing the use of
letters of recommendation,
usually required by national
sororities.
Lyons explains
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons explained that the
University discourages selec
tive organizations because
"once a student is admitted on
merit, we feel that that student
should have access to every
aspect of student life and edu
cation.

"When a student is admit
ted, it is a time of growing up,
to be free to be whatever the
hell you want to be," Lyons
said. "It's an important thing to
happen. One must have free
will, free choice. Letters of re
ference are a form of pressure.
They limit that choice, and are
a form of discrimination."
Within a month after the ban
was amended, the first group
of nine women was pledged
into the Alpha Phi sorority.
During the next several
months, meetings between
sorority alumnae and students
were held on campus to ac
quaint students with the diffe
rent sororities and discuss how
they would be organized.
