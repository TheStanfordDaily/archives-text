# Furtive glances by a lunatic
## 
### Robert Ackley 
Thirty years from now, immediately preced
ing the apocalypse, many will look back fondly
upon the day of their graduation. They will have
framed the picture somebody took of them
standing next to a total stranger in a matching cap
and gown, and put it in the display case next to
the merit badges, and every night after trudging
home from work they will wonder on those days
gone by. There they'll be, hanging out-of-focus
on the wall, 50 pounds lighter, looking for the
world like these were the best years of their life.
This is not good of course, this counter
productive moping. You must never forget how
much you hated college, and in that way, you
will not waste time yearning for a chance to
recapture once again that golden era of col
legiate glee. That's what happens, you know —
you yearn, and then you have another drink,
and then you make your children sick and tired
with yet another rendition of "All Right Now."
Dark humiliation
It happens to everybody that leaves this place
— sooner or later they completely forget every
thing that went wrong. And we can't have that.
No sir. If we are allowed to blot out those dark,
humiliating moments in our undergraduate past
we run the risk of thinking that it was fun, and
that of course is what will have you buying those
horrible-looking red socks.
It is necessary to carry with us a few scars
when we graduate, things that will keep us
growth-oriented and upwardly-mobile. And for
that reason
—try to savor the embarassment you felt upon
discovering that it is not possible to book your
relatives into the Holiday Inn two days before
graduation (it's full of people waiting for the
next USC game). Carry with you always the slim
iness you felt when you had to inform Aunt
Olga, who happens to be 89, and came all the
way from Idaho to see this, Aunt Olga who
raised you and always gave you the best; re
member how you felt this morning when you
told her that her room was in the vibra-massage
wing of Raphael's Silver Cloud Lounge and Grill
in Hollister.

She took it well, didn't she, hitting you with
her purse and locking herself in the car. Try to
capture her expression that morning forever in
your mind's eye, and in that way will you gain
the perspective that will keep you from that nos
talgic second drink. Or,
Sheer tedium
—Spend a few minutes today dwelling on the
incredible tedium of the events going on around
you. Think of the way your shirt starts to stick
aftersitting in the sun foran hour, and wallow in
the fact that it is impossible to sleep in a folding
metal chair. You know that you're hung over,
and you know that poor Auntie air-head has
locked herself in the car again, so spend some
time soaking up the underlying tension and fil
ing it away. And where is your little sister any
way? Why hasn't anybody mentioned her ador
able boyfriend lately?
—If those things don't work, and you persist
in feeling good, it is necessary only to travel
back four days in time. You had one test left, in a
class that was supposed to rank only behind
"Reading and Writing Poetry" as the most colos
sal mick in the history of undergraduate educa
tion, but you were worried about flunking the
test because you hadn't opened a book.
You hadn't even bought a book this quarter,
and the "O" has called a collection agency. Four
days ago you had just come to the horrifying
realization that you needed these units to
graduate, and you had just started off to the
library to see if you could steal the text.
But the library didn't have it, or if they did
somebody took it in the three hours it took you
to get there. So that left six hours in which you
had to find someone who had the audacity to
take notes.
Goodbye
And it doesn't matter that you somehow pul
led through and are now headed off to law
school. It doesn't matter that your name is al
most up. By now there's not a chance in hell of
your being overcome with nostalgia some day—
if you do just remind yourself that it was you
who was supposed to remind Olga to roll the
window down.
