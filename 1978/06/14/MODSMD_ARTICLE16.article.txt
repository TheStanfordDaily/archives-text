# The
						ups and downs of Stanford athletics

### David Georgette 
For the Stanford fans who
had trekked across the Bay, it
was a moment of despair— Cal
quarterback Steve Bartkowski
rolled to his right while his
lightning-quick battery-mate
Steve Rivera was cutting away
from a Card defender in the
endzone. When Bartkowski let
that pass go it was clear Rivera
would catch it.
He did, and the Cal Band,
fans and seemingly everyone
else in Memorial Stadium went
berserk, because Rivera's
score had tied the game and
Jim Breech's subsequent con
version put the Bears in front
with 27 seconds left in the
game.
Amidst the frenzied celebra
tion, Stanford fans had nothing
to imagine but visions of the
frustrating 1974 season that
was about to end with a gut
wrenching loss.
In the next five plays, how
ever, those Stanford feelings of
emptiness first changed to flic
kers of hope, then burst into

flames of unrestrained rejoic
ing when Mike Langford's 50-
yard field goal attempt on the
game's final play wobbled
down through the uprights for
a stunning 22-20 Card win.
The dramatic victory dispel
led the disappointments the
season had brought, letdowns
that had culminated two weeks
earlier when the USC Trojans
crushed Stanford hopes for the
Rose Bowl with a 34-10 thrash
ing in a packed Stanford
Stadium.
Both those games four years
ago symbolized what the
then-first-quarter freshmen
have witnessed in sports dur
ing their stay at Stanford. Thril
ling performances such as
Langford's field goal and
swimmer Dave Fairbanks'
upset win over some of the
world's top swimmers for the
1977 NCAA 100-yard freestyle
crown were plentiful. But
along with the victories and
triumphs, there've been a
good share of disappointments
and embarrassments in sports

on the Farm.
Disappointments like the
Trojans' biennial bash in Stan
ford Stadium. After the '74 de
bacle, in 1976 the Cards re
ceived a deafening ovation as
they ran onto the field. Four
plays into the game, Shelton
Diggs was in the endzone re
ceiving a 57-yard touchdown
pass and USC was on its way to
a 48-24 rout of the Cards.
How about the beginning of

Sports

the 1975 basketball game
against Lonnie Shelton and the
Oregon State Beavers? Card
forward Scott Trobbe flew in
for a lay-in off the opening tip.
The only problem was that it
was the Beavers' basket. Stan
ford lost, 74-68.
Embarrassments in Stanford

Stadium were not limited to
football games against USC.
There was the track — which
was in such bad condition that
during the 800 meters in the
1976 double dual meet, USC's
Rayfield Beaton tripped on one
of the lane dividers and lost by
.2 seconds to Cal's James
Robinson. Not until a letter by
Stanford hurdler Tom
Shellworth complaining about
the surface was published did

the efforts to replace the track
get serious, and just in time.
Finishing touches were placed
on the track in March, and just
a few hours later Marathon En
gineering Corp., the firm that
installed the track, burned up
in a three-alarm blaze.
Each time the Cards hosted

San Jose State in the annual
South Bay grid battle resulted
in another venture into the
bizarre. In 1974, the game
ended in a 21-21 tie. In 1975,
Spartan quarterback Roger
Profitt, who had passed for a
measly three yards against
inept Oregon the previous
week, racked up 258 yards
against the porous Card de
fense as San Jose State won,
36-34. Then last year, after San
Jose State had cut a Cardinal
lead to five points with a
touchdown pass off a triple re
verse, many of the students in
the Stanford rooting section
gave the Spartans a standing
ovation.
Up until last season,
whenever the Cards had a big
football game at home, they
lost. With a possible Rose Bowl
bid on the line in the 1975 Big
Game, the Cards turned in a
fine imitation of the audience,
watching Bear running back
Chuck Muncie spin all over the
field as he accounted for five
