# The 						ups and downs of Stanford athletics
## 
### David Georgette 
For the Stanford fans who
had trekked across the Bay, it
was a moment of despair— Cal
quarterback Steve Bartkowski
rolled to his right while his
lightning-quick battery-mate
Steve Rivera was cutting away
from a Card defender in the
endzone. When Bartkowski let
that pass go it was clear Rivera
would catch it.
He did, and the Cal Band,
fans and seemingly everyone
else in Memorial Stadium went
berserk, because Rivera's
score had tied the game and
Jim Breech's subsequent con
version put the Bears in front
with 27 seconds left in the
game.
Amidst the frenzied celebra
tion, Stanford fans had nothing
to imagine but visions of the
frustrating 1974 season that
was about to end with a gut
wrenching loss.
In the next five plays, how
ever, those Stanford feelings of
emptiness first changed to flic
kers of hope, then burst into

flames of unrestrained rejoic
ing when Mike Langford's 50-
yard field goal attempt on the
game's final play wobbled
down through the uprights for
a stunning 22-20 Card win.
The dramatic victory dispel
led the disappointments the
season had brought, letdowns
that had culminated two weeks
earlier when the USC Trojans
crushed Stanford hopes for the
Rose Bowl with a 34-10 thrash
ing in a packed Stanford
Stadium.
Both those games four years
ago symbolized what the
then-first-quarter freshmen
have witnessed in sports dur
ing their stay at Stanford. Thril
ling performances such as
Langford's field goal and
swimmer Dave Fairbanks'
upset win over some of the
world's top swimmers for the
1977 NCAA 100-yard freestyle
crown were plentiful. But
along with the victories and
triumphs, there've been a
good share of disappointments
and embarrassments in sports

on the Farm.
Disappointments like the
Trojans' biennial bash in Stan
ford Stadium. After the '74 de
bacle, in 1976 the Cards re
ceived a deafening ovation as
they ran onto the field. Four
plays into the game, Shelton
Diggs was in the endzone re
ceiving a 57-yard touchdown
pass and USC was on its way to
a 48-24 rout of the Cards.
How about the beginning of

Sports

the 1975 basketball game
against Lonnie Shelton and the
Oregon State Beavers? Card
forward Scott Trobbe flew in
for a lay-in off the opening tip.
The only problem was that it
was the Beavers' basket. Stan
ford lost, 74-68.
Embarrassments in Stanford

Stadium were not limited to
football games against USC.
There was the track — which
was in such bad condition that
during the 800 meters in the
1976 double dual meet, USC's
Rayfield Beaton tripped on one
of the lane dividers and lost by
.2 seconds to Cal's James
Robinson. Not until a letter by
Stanford hurdler Tom
Shellworth complaining about
the surface was published did

the efforts to replace the track
get serious, and just in time.
Finishing touches were placed
on the track in March, and just
a few hours later Marathon En
gineering Corp., the firm that
installed the track, burned up
in a three-alarm blaze.
Each time the Cards hosted

San Jose State in the annual
South Bay grid battle resulted
in another venture into the
bizarre. In 1974, the game
ended in a 21-21 tie. In 1975,
Spartan quarterback Roger
Profitt, who had passed for a
measly three yards against
inept Oregon the previous
week, racked up 258 yards
against the porous Card de
fense as San Jose State won,
36-34. Then last year, after San
Jose State had cut a Cardinal
lead to five points with a
touchdown pass off a triple re
verse, many of the students in
the Stanford rooting section
gave the Spartans a standing
ovation.
Up until last season,
whenever the Cards had a big
football game at home, they
lost. With a possible Rose Bowl
bid on the line in the 1975 Big
Game, the Cards turned in a
fine imitation of the audience,
watching Bear running back
Chuck Muncie spin all over the
field as he accounted for five
t< uchdowns in a 48-15 Cal
tr umph. The Cards' perfor
mance that day was summed
Hp when substitute quarter
back Jerry Waldvogel's attemp
ts I swing pass turned into a
literal which Cal recovered as
Host of the Cards were return
ing to the huddle.
I The men's basketball team
was not alone in its misadven
tures; the women cagers also
piovided a few, particularly
this season when they twice
Kin up against national champ
ipn UCLA. They did manage to
Bold the Bruins under 100
p tints, however.
I Probably the ultimate em
barrassment for the women's
Brogram came when prior to
■he awards ceremony for the
BlAW regional tournament in
Maples Pavilion, there was no
ftody around to carry out the
■rophies and coaches Dottie
f IcCrea and Sue Rojcewicz had
i< i struggle with a large wooden
»ble in moving the awards out
H) center court.
V Nor was field hockey im
" triune to moments of weak
ness. In one game, Nancy
lackson suddenly ran off the
ijield, to her teammates' dis
may. The reason? The buttons
holding her skirt had given
Way.
Maples Miracles
Though men's basketball has
■consistently provided the most
frustration for Stanford fans
during the past four years, it
galso provided the greatest chal
lenge to the ranking of
jLangford's Big Game field goal
las the biggest Stanford sports
■thrill in the last four years.
Frequently in Maples there
Iwere situations such as ]ay Car
eer missing a breakaway lay-up,
Iwhich cost the Cards a chance
lat victory over highly-ranked
■ USF three seasons ago, or
lUSC's Don Carfino sinking a
|25-footer at the buzzer to si
llence the crowd and ruin a
■ Stanford comeback this year.
But the Maples Miracle —
Ithose two consecutive magical
■ nights back in January 1975
Iwhen the Cards knocked off
I No. 2-ranked UCLA 64-60 and
I then edged No. 5 USC 67-66 —
I left voices hoarse, ears ringing
land Stanford fans ecstatic as
I Rich Kelley, Ed Schweitzer and
I hot-shooting freshman Carter
Igunned Stanford to the top of
I the Pac-fl basketball standings.
Langford also had another
| field goal, though, which
stands up next to his 1974 boot.
In the Cards' last game against
Trojan coach John McKay,
langford sent the ball whirling
through the uprights on a 37-
yard field goal, again on the last
play of the game, to give the
j Cards a 13-10 triumph in 1975.
Langford's field goals, like
most of the other great sports
achievements by the Cards in
the past four years, both occur
red on the road. With the ex
ception of the heroics turned
in by quarterback Steve Dils
and receiver James Lofton in
last year's 32-28 barnburning
Stanford win over UCLA and
the patented late-inning rallies
of the baseball team, the Cards
basked in their greatest glory

miles away from the Farm.
Sure, there have been times
and places when it would have
been better if no one from
Stanford had been present.
Like the time a flurry of tipped
passes in the fourth quarter
cost the Cards a game against
UCLA. It seemed liketherewas
no one from Stanford at the
49-0 debacle against the Tro
jans last year, the 51-0 Michi
gan massacre two years ago,
and the last two visits to Pauley
Pavilion. And it's fortunate that
when the Cards blewa 20-point
fourth-quarter lead against the
Army football team two years
ago, it happened on the shores
of the FHudson River.
Tennis and water polo
But the four Stanford na
tional championships in the
last four years also came on the
road — a 13-12 water polo
triumph over UCLA in 1976 at
Long Beach. The Cards
notched their second national
title in the same academic year
— a first on the Farm — six
months later when the men's
tennis team downed Trinity
University 5-4 in Athens, Ga.
This year the Card netters
did more than just set a Stan
ford precedent — they re
corded a national first. Led by
super freshman John McEnroe
and a handful of outstanding
tennis players, probably the
greatest college tennis team
ever assembled blitzed its way
to a second straight NCAA title
in Athens while the Card
women upset top-ranked USC
to win the AIAW National
Championship in Salisbury,
Md.
Swimming titles
In swimming, Mike Bruner
and John Hencken have
brought five NCAA swimming
titles to the Farm. Bruner took
the 200 butterfly the same year
Fairbanks won the 100 frees
tyle. Bruner also captured the
1650 freestyle in 1975. Hencken
won the 100 and 200
breaststroke in '75 and then
came back to win the 100
breaststroke again in 1976.
Later that summer, he won
the gold medal at the Montreal
Olympics in the 100
breaststroke and was also on
the champion 400 medley re
lay. Bruner took the gold in the
200 butterfly and was a
member of the victorious 800
freestyle relay. Kim Peyton
took home a gold medal as a
member of the women's 400
freestyle relay team.
Peyton also won the 200
freestyle in the 1977 AIAW na
tional meet. The Cards finished
second that year as Valerie Lee
took three individual firsts and
two Stanford relay squads
added two other firsts.
In track, Terry Albritton won
the 1977 NCAA shotput crown.
A year earlier, at the Pac-8
Championships at Berkeley,
runner Tony Sandoval pro
vided one of the highlights in
Stanford track when he ran
down defending NCAA champ
ion John Ngeno of Washington
State and two of his teammates
to win the 10,000.
And then there's Lofton, one
of the greatest athletes in Stan-
