# Water polo standout prepares to leave pool
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
After four years of com
bining economics and
waterpolo, earning a
bachelor's degree in the
former and All-America
honors in the latter, Marty
Davis appears to be a
strong candidate for busi
ness or law school.
Instead, however, Davis
plans to spend the next
year or so playing and
coaching water polo,
wine-tasting in France and
scuba diving off Australia's
Great Barrier Reef. He said
that after he had done all
that, he would think about
a career.
"I don't want to work in
any type of corporation,"
Davis said. "I don't want to
be a businessman."
Another thing Davis said
he won't be doing after
this year is playing water
polo. He said he plans to
play in the AAU Nationals
this summer but, except
for possibly coaching a
team in Australia later this
year, this summer may
mean an end to his eight
year career in the sport.
"There's a very good
chance this might be my

last year in water polo,"
said Davis. "It's just that it
takes up too much time.
It's about time I did some
other things."
Davis got his start in
water polo as a freshman
at Harvard High School in
Redlands, but his aquatic
career began when he was
a six year-old age-group
swimmer.
Having swum for seven
years before trying the
new sport, Davis naturally
had an edge over the other
players.
"It was fun for me just
being better than every
body else," said Davis. "I
liked the sport because it
had all the elements of a
good sport — passing,
shooting and scoring. And
it's a team sport. I've al
ways liked team sports."
Davis chose to come to
Stanford for the
academics, even though
he had applied to other
schools with stronger
water polo programs. At
first, his smaller size —
about 5-foot-10 — earned
him the nickname "The
Flea."
"That never sat well with

him," laughed Art Lam
bert, Davis's coach for his
first three years here.
Lambert said that Davis
was very receptive to
coaching and quickly
learned to compensate for
the size difference by out
thinking and out-hustling
his opponents.
"He's one of the best
players that I've coached,"
said Lambert. "He's a very
level-headed individual.
He's an intelligent indi
vidual and he's very eager
to learn."
Davis said he learned a
lot more from his water
polo experience than just
how to play the game well.
"It's given me a lot of
confidence in other
areas," he explained. "If I
work hardforsomething, I
know I'll do a good job.
"I was an extremely
temperamental kid," he
continued. "It taught me
how to control my anger,
especially when I didn't
like what my teammates
were doing. It taught me
that, from a team aspect,
you get a lot more ac
complished when you're
reassuring somebody else
even though they're

screwing up, than to just
let your emotions go."
Davis cited Lambert's
coaching as the primary
reason for his more discip
lined character.
"I think it (water polo)
gave me more discipline
than any other thing in my
life," Davis said.
In the summer of 1976,
Davis traveled with the
team to the U.S.S.R. to
play the Russian water
polo team. He described
the trip as "quite an ex
perience."
"The (Russian) players
took us to places which
were 'off grounds' for the
rest of the tourists," Davis
said. "They were just as
curious about us as we
were about them. I feel
that I got a very close
perspective of Russian
society in must a week and
a half."
He learned a little bit
about water polo, too.
That same summer, Davis
was voted All-America in
the AAU Summer Nation
als. Last fall, he was not
only chosen All-America in
the NCAA, but was also
selected to the All-
Tourney team at the NCAA

C^mpionships.
his credentials out of
the pool are also highly re
garded. Said Lambert:
"He's intellectually honest
and 'up front.' You always
know where you stand
with Marty. He's very
soft-spoken and he's firm
on what he believes. He's
not a wishy-washy person.
He always seemed to have
a good sense of values.
He's very much his own
man."
Besides confidence and
discipline, Davis said that
playing water polo taught

him not to panic in pres
sure situations.
Finally, Davis said that
the thing he likes most
about the University is
there is so much to do and
there's such a diverse
group of people here.
"What you learn outside
the classroom around
here is just as important as
what you learn inside the
classroom," he said.
"This place is a little like
a Utopia," Davis quipped,
"unless you're a pre-med
or an engineer."
