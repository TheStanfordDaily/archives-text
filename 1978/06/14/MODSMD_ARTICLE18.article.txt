ford history. The sixth player
taken in the 1978 professional
football draft capped his four
years of exploits on the track by
capturing the 1978 NCAA long
jump crown to go along with
the two Pac-8 titles he won.
The Cards
equaled their best showing in
recent years in the pro football
draft this spring when Lofton,
offensive tackle Cordon King
and record-setting quarter
back Guy Benjamin were all
claimed in the first two rounds.
Benjamin, who directed the
winning drives for both of
Langford's memorable field
goals, was the Pac-B's Co-
Player of the Year in 1977 and
ended his career as the most
accurate passer in conference
history.
In baseball, first baseman
Tom Guardino set a Pac-8
career mark for home runs,
slamming 13 this season to
finish with a career total of 37.
Outfielder Larry Reynolds, was
the Pac-8 Baseball Co-Athlete
of the Year in 1977 before being
drafted by the San Diego
Padres last week.
In water polo, Chris Dorst,
All-America goalie, Rick
Johannsen and Marty Davis
spearheaded the Cards' drive
to the heights of college water
polo.
Golfer Mike Peck became an
All-American, won the 1976
U.S. Collegiate Invitational and
put together a record which
overshadows that of former
Card Tom Watson, currently
on the pro tour.
In women's basketball,
center Maggie Nelson set Card
rebounding and scoring re
cords to become the first
woman eager at Stanford to
earn All-America status.
Nancy White, an All-America
field hockey player, played on
the national team which par
ticipated in a tournament in
Trinidad. Before that, she
helped her Stanford team
make consecutive trips to the

national field hockey tourna
ment.
Finally, the fourth-year fans
had the pleasure for at least
one season of seeing diminu
tive freshman Darrin Nelson
dart his way past, between and
under defenders a she became
the first Stanford runner to
gain 1000 yards in a season.
Coaching
Coaching is not supposed to
be a secure profession, and a
look at the changes on the
Farm in the last four years un
derscores this.
The firing took place on the
eve of the 1976 Big Game when
Ruetz announced he had de
cided to buy up the remaining
years of Jack Christiansen's
contract even though Chris
had directed the Cards to a
winning record every season.
With Chris' departure and the

graduation of quarterback
Mike Cordova, the quarter
back controversy which had
plagued the Cardinals for three
years came to an end.
Ruetz, who announced in
April he will be retiring at the
end of this year, went to the
ranks of pro football to find a
replacement for Christiansen,
selecting offensive wizard Bill
Walsh. Under his tutelage, the
Cards enjoyed their best sea
son since their last Rose Bowl
trip, winning all their games at
home, including a 21-3 victory
over Cal.
And though hopes for the
Rose Bowl over the past four
years never materialized as a
trip to Pasadena, the 24-14 Sun
Bowl win over Louisiana State
soothed many of the cleat
marks USC had left on Stanford
dreams.

the score changed from 20-19 Cal with two seconds left in the game
to 22-20, Stanford over Cal.
