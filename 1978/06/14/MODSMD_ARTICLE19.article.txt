# Fantasies of an unknown sportswriter
## Yes, Virginia, there is a James Lofton... 
### Bruce Anderson 
"Come on Ralph, give up,"
said Don, a 42-year-old invest
ment broker. "You know you
don't really mean it."
"Sure do," responded the
pudgy, ruddy-faced lawyer.
"Lofton was more ham than
athlete when we were in col
lege. Who else would have said

that the new track put in the
stadium our senior year was 'a
tribute to me and my great and
illustrious career.'?"
"He just had a great sense of
humor."
"Sense of humor, no. Ego,
yes. I'll bet he used to autog
raph his own pictures and mail

them to himself."
"Come off it. Look, Mike just
got here. He was an avid fan in
college, let's ask him."
Don stepped to the side and
yelled across the crowded
banquet room, "Hey Mike, we
need an expert opinion."
Mike, late for the class reun
ion just as he had been for
graduation 20years earlier, was
still fumbling with his name
tag.
")ust a minute," he hollered
back. In a few seconds he wan
dered over to the pair. "OK,
what do you need to know?"
"We were arguing about
whether Lofton was the best
Stanford athlete ever. Ralph,
like a penguin trying to fly, is
trying to say he was more a
great ham than a great
athlete!"
"You're a lawyer, Ralph,
look at the evidence," Mike
said after stirring his martini.
"First, he was a three-time
track All-American. Second, he
won the NCAA long jump title
in '78 and still holds the school
record. He shared the school
record for 200 meters and an
chored the 1600-meter relay
team to a school mark."
"Yeah, Ralph. In football his
14 touchdown receptions are
still a Stanford record for one
season. They wasted him on
the bench for three years and
he still caught 53 passes his
senior year. I think he led the
conference in receptions. No
matter, the Packers thought
enough of his one-year show
ing to pick him with the eighth
choice in the '78 draft. And
even that early, he proved to
be a steal. He was the greatest
combination of speed and
spring ever to set foot in Stan
ford Stadium."
"Even more important, he

was amazingly smart. He had a
great mind. Coach Walsh al
ways said the thing that set
James apart from the receivers
he worked with when he was in
the NFL was that James was so
much more intelligent. Now
he's out of pro ball and he's a
hot-shot engineer."
"Right. Didn't Lofton get the
Al Masters award for the best
combination of academics and
athletics our senior year?"
"He may have, but the only
award he really earned was the
one they gave him in El Paso at
a luncheon the day before the
Sun Bowl?"
"What was that?"
"The Muhammad Ali l-am
the-Createst Award.
"Speaking of the Sun Bowl,
remember those two TD pas
ses Lofton grabbed? The first
one was a midfield bomb and
the second one was a two-yard
strike on fourth-and-1 which
gave us a 17-14 lead."
"All I remember about those
touchdowns is that ridiculous
dance Lofton and Bill Kellardid
around the ball in the end
zone. It was a football game,
not a discotheque."
"Come on Ralph," Mike
said. "You screamed your
lungs out after both of those
touchdowns."
"Yelling after touchdowns?"
Don asked. "I thought I'd mis
placed my vocal cords after
Lofton's touchdown against
UCLA. Guy was hurt and Dils
was quarterbacking that game.
Stanford had the ball on the 27
and James jumped up between
two UCLA jokers at the 5, grab
bed the pass and ran into the
end zone to give us a 37-38 win
with only 37 seconds left."
"What do you mean 'he ran
into the end zone'?" He pr
anced in. Then he had the gall
after the game to say "Hey, I'm
no hot dog.' Hell, he was a

fulltime hot dog with relish."
"Sure, Ralph. The only
reason he ever wanted to catch
touchdown passes was so he
could be a hot dog. That UCLA
catch was not only a great
catch, but was the pivotal play
of the whole season."
"And the only reason he was
able to make that catch was be
cause of his spring. Man, that
guy could jump. He was the
world's greatest part-time long
jumper. He'd only spend half
the year jumping and even
then he was a spread thin run
ning the sprints and anchoring
the relays. Despite all that, he
jumped 27 feet in the AAU
meet our senioryear. I'll bet he
would have won a gold medal
in the Moscow Olympics if he
hadn't gone into pro ball."
"But what the hell, he ended
up a six-year All-Pro."
"Man, he worked so hard. It
was only fair that it paid off. In
track he did everything. He
won the Iron Man Award hands
down all four years. Some
meets he was practically the
whole team. In the Big Meet
against Cal senior year, he won
three events and anchored two
winning relays and we still lost.
If he'd gone to 'SC, they'd have
enshrined him."
"The NFL Hall of Fame al
ready has."
"Hey, he wasn't such a hard
worker. He spent half of his
time practicing how he was
going to look when he broke
the finish tape. He'd stand in
front of a mirror and practice
holding up his index finger and
grinning at the crowd and
slapping palms with Cordon
Banks."
Another voice joined the trio
of paunchy middle-aged Stan
ford grads. "I think lames Lof
ton's greatest quality was his
absolute humility."
"Hey lames, it's good to see
you."

that the new track put in the
stadium our senior year was 'a
tribute to me and my great and
illustrious career.'?"
"He just had a great sense of
humor."
"Sense of humor, no. Ego,
yes. I'll bet he used to autog
raph his own pictures and mail

them to himself."
"Come off it. Look, Mike just
got here. He was an avid fan in
college, let's ask him."
Don stepped to the side and
yelled across the crowded
banquet room, "Hey Mike, we
need an expert opinion."
Mike, late for the class reun
ion just as he had been for
graduation 20years earlier, was
still fumbling with his name
tag.
")ust a minute," he hollered
back. In a few seconds he wan
dered over to the pair. "OK,
what do you need to know?"
"We were arguing about
whether Lofton was the best
Stanford athlete ever. Ralph,
like a penguin trying to fly, is
trying to say he was more a
great ham than a great
athlete!"
"You're a lawyer, Ralph,
look at the evidence," Mike
said after stirring his martini.
"First, he was a three-time
track All-American. Second, he
won the NCAA long jump title
in '78 and still holds the school
record. He shared the school
record for 200 meters and an
chored the 1600-meter relay
team to a school mark."
"Yeah, Ralph. In football his
14 touchdown receptions are
still a Stanford record for one
season. They wasted him on
the bench for three years and
he still caught 53 passes his
senior year. I think he led the
conference in receptions. No
matter, the Packers thought
enough of his one-year show
ing to pick him with the eighth
choice in the '78 draft. And
even that early, he proved to
be a steal. He was the greatest
combination of speed and
spring ever to set foot in Stan
ford Stadium."
"Even more important, he

was amazingly smart. He had a
great mind. Coach Walsh al
ways said the thing that set
James apart from the receivers
he worked with when he was in
the NFL was that James was so
much more intelligent. Now
he's out of pro ball and he's a
hot-shot engineer."
"Right. Didn't Lofton get the
Al Masters award for the best
combination of academics and
athletics our senior year?"
"He may have, but the only
award he really earned was the
one they gave him in El Paso at
a luncheon the day before the
Sun Bowl?"
"What was that?"
"The Muhammad Ali l-am
the-Createst Award.
"Speaking of the Sun Bowl,
remember those two TD pas
ses Lofton grabbed? The first
one was a midfield bomb and
the second one was a two-yard
strike on fourth-and-1 which
gave us a 17-14 lead."
"All I remember about those
touchdowns is that ridiculous
dance Lofton and Bill Kellardid
around the ball in the end
zone. It was a football game,
not a discotheque."
"Come on Ralph," Mike
said. "You screamed your
lungs out after both of those
touchdowns."
"Yelling after touchdowns?"
Don asked. "I thought I'd mis
placed my vocal cords after
Lofton's touchdown against
UCLA. Guy was hurt and Dils
was quarterbacking that game.
Stanford had the ball on the 27
and James jumped up between
two UCLA jokers at the 5, grab
bed the pass and ran into the
end zone to give us a 37-38 win
with only 37 seconds left."
"What do you mean 'he ran
into the end zone'?" He pr
anced in. Then he had the gall
after the game to say "Hey, I'm
no hot dog.' Hell, he was a

fulltime hot dog with relish."
"Sure, Ralph. The only
reason he ever wanted to catch
touchdown passes was so he
could be a hot dog. That UCLA
catch was not only a great
catch, but was the pivotal play
of the whole season."
"And the only reason he was
able to make that catch was be
cause of his spring. Man, that
guy could jump. He was the
world's greatest part-time long
jumper. He'd only spend half
the year jumping and even
then he was a spread thin run
ning the sprints and anchoring
the relays. Despite all that, he
jumped 27 feet in the AAU
meet our senioryear. I'll bet he
would have won a gold medal
in the Moscow Olympics if he
hadn't gone into pro ball."
"But what the hell, he ended
up a six-year All-Pro."
"Man, he worked so hard. It
was only fair that it paid off. In
track he did everything. He
won the Iron Man Award hands
down all four years. Some
meets he was practically the
whole team. In the Big Meet
against Cal senior year, he won
three events and anchored two
winning relays and we still lost.
If he'd gone to 'SC, they'd have
enshrined him."
"The NFL Hall of Fame al
ready has."
"Hey, he wasn't such a hard
worker. He spent half of his
time practicing how he was
going to look when he broke
the finish tape. He'd stand in
front of a mirror and practice
holding up his index finger and
grinning at the crowd and
slapping palms with Cordon
Banks."
Another voice joined the trio
of paunchy middle-aged Stan
ford grads. "I think lames Lof
ton's greatest quality was his
absolute humility."
"Hey lames, it's good to see
you."


James Lofton
"Come on Ralph, give up,"
said Don, a 42-year-old invest
ment broker. "You know you
don't really mean it."
"Sure do," responded the
pudgy, ruddy-faced lawyer.
"Lofton was more ham than
athlete when we were in col
lege. Who else would have said

that the new track put in the
stadium our senior year was 'a
tribute to me and my great and
illustrious career.'?"
