# Job scene improving for seniors and med, law grads
## 
### Matt Mettler 
Job prospects for graduating
seniors "are better this year than
they have been in the past several
years," according to Ralph Keller, di
rector of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
Keller cited an upswing in the
economy and an increase of confi
dence in the economy as leading
employers to hire more entry-level
people.
"Some employers are even comp
laining that they are not getting
enough Stanford applicants," said
Keller.
Approximately 40 per cent of the
graduating seniors plan to continue
immediately to graduate school ac
cording to an Academic Information
Center survey. This is a decrease of
10 per cent from last year; however,
the proportion of seniors surveyed
who intend to seek an advanced de
gree at some time has remained
constant for the last three years.
These statistics represent a trend
for seniors to stop out for a year or
two before continuing to graduate
or professional schools.
Diversity preferable
For students graduating with de
grees in math, science or engineer
ing, job prospects are good, but
those who majored in the liberal arts
are experiencing some difficulty,
Keller said.
He explained that students major
ing in the humanities tend to con

centrate heavily on liberal arts, be
coming specialized in areas that
don't qualify them for jobs.
"Employers look for diversity at
the undergraduate level. The pros
pects for a history major who has
also taken other courses such as cal
culus, economics, statistics, compu
ter science and social psychology
would be good," Keller said.
In competing with job candidates
from other schools "the advantage
of being from Stanford is considera
ble," Keller said.
"They are aware of the quality of
people admitted to Stanford and
they realize students here compete
with high ability people," Keller
said.
Keller indicated job candidates
with any type of engineering degree
are particularly in demand this year,
but he noted such demands are
often cyclical.
Improvement for minorities, women
"Job prospects for women and
minorities have improved tremend
ously over the last few years," Keller
said. While the problem is not com
pletely solved, programs aimed at
ending discrimination are working.
Women are moving into areas
from which they have previously
been excluded, Keller said. The
same pattern holds in general for
minorities, but they tend to major in
the humanities rather than the sci
ences.

For the seniors who will be enter
ing professional schools after
graduation, the outlook is even
more heartening. About 88 per cent
of graduating Medical School stu
dents and 73 per cent of Law School
seniors know where they will be
working after leaving the University,
according to figures released by the
two professional schools.
Seventeen of the 83 seniors who
participated in the National Intern
ship Residency Matching Program
will be doing internships at Stanford
University Hospital, while UCLA
captured six seniors.
According to Karl Cray, director of
student affairs at the Med School,
graduating medical students have
about two to five years of residency
ahead of them.
But nevertheless, it seems that
once they make it through medical
school, they don't quit.
"I can't think of any students who
made it through medical school and
then dropped out before going into
residency," he said. "It would be in
consistent."
About 73 per cent of the graduat
ing law students who have jobs lined
up will work for-private law firms,
according to Gloria Pyszka, director
of the Office of Law Placement.
Another 8 per cent will go into gov
ernment, 8 per cent into judicial
clerkships and 2 per cent each into
public interest, corporations and
non-legal activities.
