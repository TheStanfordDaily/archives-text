The capsule reviews which follow
have been distilled from the most re
cent work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer. Harry's
taste is wide, reliable and entirely free
of national prejudices. The prices he
quotes are approximate and are only
intended to give an idea of the general
range in any particular restaurant.
Chinese
Chef Chu's advertises the Mandarin
cuisine of China. It is extremely popular
with Stanford people because it com
bines uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cooking in
the area.

One shouldn't miss themu shu pork
which is definitively done at Chef
Chu's. Served with silk-thin crepes, it is
distinct from the pancakes found at
most other places.
Chu's menu is well-chosen and var
ied; one can't go wrong with any of
their "specialties." Although its prices
are no longer cheap, Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture of Sam
son Chu, Lawrence "Chef" Chu's
younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items, many of
which are Hunan-style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the portions are
smaller. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is attentive.

Kung pao beef ($4.25-spicy) consists
of tender beef slices and crisp green
pepper accented with peanuts. Prawns
in hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the best
Szechuan food near Stanford. The spic
ing at Hsi-Nan is more distinct and hot
ter than at the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be prepared,"
says the owner.
French
Chantilly is that type of restaurant
you'd like to keep a secret. The under
stated elegance of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmosphere

without the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and the di
verse menu shows imagination:
sauteed veal and eggplant ($9.50), L'es
calopine de Veau a la Bolognaise for
two ($2l), Chicken Cynthia ($8.50) with
champagne, grapes and orange
(Melanzana a la Feta, $5.25 — for two).
The chef's subtle sauces and refined
seasonings enhance rather than stifle
the freshness of Chantilly's dishes. The
Liaison Salad a la Chantilly for two
($6.00), with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs, and the
Medallions of Spring Lamb ($9.25),
sauteed with fresh taragon, will both
delight rather than assault your palate.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's third
French restaurant in the Bay Area and it
continues his policy of good food at
reasonable prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour and a
pleasant butter lettuce salad with a
mustardy vinaigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
