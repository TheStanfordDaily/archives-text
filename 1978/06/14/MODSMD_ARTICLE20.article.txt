The capsule reviews which follow
have been distilled from the most re
cent work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer. Harry's
taste is wide, reliable and entirely free
of national prejudices. The prices he
quotes are approximate and are only
intended to give an idea of the general
range in any particular restaurant.
Chinese
Chef Chu's advertises the Mandarin
cuisine of China. It is extremely popular
with Stanford people because it com
bines uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cooking in
the area.

One shouldn't miss themu shu pork
which is definitively done at Chef
Chu's. Served with silk-thin crepes, it is
distinct from the pancakes found at
most other places.
Chu's menu is well-chosen and var
ied; one can't go wrong with any of
their "specialties." Although its prices
are no longer cheap, Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture of Sam
son Chu, Lawrence "Chef" Chu's
younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items, many of
which are Hunan-style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the portions are
smaller. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is attentive.

Kung pao beef ($4.25-spicy) consists
of tender beef slices and crisp green
pepper accented with peanuts. Prawns
in hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the best
Szechuan food near Stanford. The spic
ing at Hsi-Nan is more distinct and hot
ter than at the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be prepared,"
says the owner.
French
Chantilly is that type of restaurant
you'd like to keep a secret. The under
stated elegance of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmosphere

without the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and the di
verse menu shows imagination:
sauteed veal and eggplant ($9.50), L'es
calopine de Veau a la Bolognaise for
two ($2l), Chicken Cynthia ($8.50) with
champagne, grapes and orange
(Melanzana a la Feta, $5.25 — for two).
The chef's subtle sauces and refined
seasonings enhance rather than stifle
the freshness of Chantilly's dishes. The
Liaison Salad a la Chantilly for two
($6.00), with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs, and the
Medallions of Spring Lamb ($9.25),
sauteed with fresh taragon, will both
delight rather than assault your palate.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's third
French restaurant in the Bay Area and it
continues his policy of good food at
reasonable prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour and a
pleasant butter lettuce salad with a
mustardy vinaigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are marvelous, but
others, not satisfactorily demembraned, are
chewy and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate mousse ($1.25)
and "Floating Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Che/ Justine offers eight standard appetizers
such as shrimp, escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed liver variety, but
too dry. Entrees come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone ($8.50), Long Is
land Duckling ($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50) among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream Sauce ($8.25) are
extremely tender, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they resembled veal
medallions. Tuite Plemontaise (fresh trout with
white wine sauce — $7.50) is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries Romanoff ($2.50)
with ice cream, nuts and Grand Marnier is a
visual as well as taste treat.
Although better French restaurants than Chez
lustine exist on the Peninsula, don't miss Sun
day Champagne Brunch. The incredible buffet is
already a legend in the Bay Area. Many students
here fast for two days before parting with their
$6.
Italian
Frankie, lohnnie & Luigi Too is just 15 minutes
down El Camino Real in Mountain View, and has
a reputation as the students choice.
Pizzas are 12, 14 and 16 inches. Two specialty
pizzas — "Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" — presently cost $5.50, $7.25
and $8.95
Frankie's has the most generous meat top
pings of all local restaurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the meager help
ing of green pepper. The fresh-tasting tomato
sauce harmonizes well with the mozzarella
cheese and except for the wide border around
the pizza, the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular item at Fran
kie's, but there are other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal scallopini din
ner ($6.50) includes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagna ($5.25) is the house
specialty.

Three appetizers are stand-outs. A huge bowl
of homemade minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable starter contains fresh
carrots and zucchini, cubes of ham and beef and
herbs. Fresh mushrooms ($1.50) sauteed in a
wine sauce and pungent with garlic are always
reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown Palo Alto and
mere minutes away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an amazing assort
ment of fresh vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14 and 16 inches in
diameter. A one-item medium is $4.55; a
medium Stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here are ex
tremely filling, a result of too much cheese (if
that is possible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not generously portioned
and if one likes tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices are high, espe
cially in relation to the meat portions, the
stromboli is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about Formico's are not re
vealing their secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embarcadero and High
way 101, Formico's "specializes in all Italian
foods."
Prices here tend to be lower than at the other
pizzerias, which makes Formico's tough com
petition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actually huge with
garbanzo and kidney beans and iceberg lettuce.
The Italian dressing in particular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four sizes (10 to 16
inches). Their specialty are the same as those of
Frankie's; only the names are different. "Vin
cent's Special," for example, is $4.50 for a 12-
inch and $5.75 tor a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent balance of
cheese and tomato sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close to the edge of
the pizza. Mushrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In fact, the crust is
a little too thin and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would heighten the pizza's
total impact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is slightly
offbeat. And whoever labelled pizza
"junk food" has not tried Jose's
Cuban-style pizza with a wheat-germ
crust. These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not make
every skeptic a devoted fan, it is cer
tainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innovation,
however, is his remarkable deep-dish
sourdough crust. It could be the best
crust in the area, and is recommended
for pizzas with copious topping. But be
prepared to wait longer fora deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($6.55 for 14 in
ches) is a lavish yield from the garden:
olives, carrots, peas, onions, tomato,
corn, green beans, mushrooms and the

odd pineapple speck. Huge and thick,
it is a veritable meal in itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Saltenas, the
national dish of Bolivia, are a specialty.
These pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked with
olives, peas, eggs, potatoes and raisins.
Mexican
Casa Blanca, a small establishment on
El Camino in Mountain View, has a stark
green and white interior. Napkins
folded into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are favorites
of the owner's mother and range from
$3 to $4. These include Huevos Ran

cheros, chicken and beef burritos and
three types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.25.
A side order of mild guacamole
($1.45) is generously served in a curled
corn tortilla with plenty of chips. Two
combination plates ($3.95) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef bur
rito, tostada, enchilada and rice and re
fritos) and the Cinaloa (tacos, en
chiladas and chile relleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan Castro
Street in Mountain View is a restaurant
that has gained popularity with many
students here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the kitchen
is exposed and a Latin radio station
plays in the background.
The entire menu is in Spanish and

lists five egg dishes. Huevos Rancheros
at $2 is the most popular. The fried
chicken is only $3 and Mexican butter
fried steak comes with house salad,
guacamole, potatoes and dessert for
only $4. Menudo (beef tripe soup) and
Paella Valenchana ($1.75 — the only
non-Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are excellent
($2.60-$2.80) and include a crisp house
salad, a delectable Consome de Polio
(chicken broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green chile
peppers) and noteworthy rice and re
fritos. Don't pass up the burrito with
chicken chunks in green tomato sauce
or the chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos.
