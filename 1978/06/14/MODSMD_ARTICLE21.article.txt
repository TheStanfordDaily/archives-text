## Housing, apartheid, the bonfire, and tenure... 
### Jon Hornsby 
You would think that all the
flows and cross-currents hap
pening around a class going
through four years of college
would run their course and fi
nally reach some happy end
ing.
Luckily, it doesn't happen
that way. What happens is a lot
of hot little affairs flare up and
burn out while some long-term
issues smolder on to be occa
sionally tended.
The year 1974 was tainted by
a debate over innovative edu
cation, while minority students
fought for their cause's survival
against threats of minority aid
cuts. In 1975 distinguished fa
culty members were shaken by
decisions denying tenure to
such able "under" professors
as Jerry Irish.
Also in 1974, fans at football
games were hollering "Im
peach Christiansen! We want
Benjamin!" (or was it
Waldvogel, or back to Cor
dova?), while fraternities were
alarmed by Larry Horton's
campus housing plans which
threatened their existence.
The "Chaparral Era" lasted
for a while last year v ith the

election of the Hammer and
Coffin slate to the ASSU Se
nate, and the next year
ushered in more serious busi
ness when some senators-elect
were disqualified in a cam
paign marred by dirty tricks.
This year the campaigns for
women, gays, and minorities
kept grinding. New highlights
on a diffrent level of concern
were the Bonfire getting can
celed and sororities slip
ping back onto campus.
The combination of both the
highbrow and lowbrow issues
over the last four years has
added different shades of per
ception to people's concep
tion of their "Stanford experi
ence."
Education
Fortunately for everyone, a
lot of thought over the years
has gone not only to the issues
just mentioned, but to un
dramatic issues affecting how
we get our education.
Last quarter, an editorial in
the Stanford Daily detailing
reasons for a student's
dropping-out resurrected (to
serious conversation level, at
least) insecurities about the

worth of a college education.
For a couple of weeks, stu
dents were reassessing their
grade-grubbing motivations
pitting "working within the
system" against conscientious
boycott of it as means of attain
ing individual and social prog
ress.
And all the while, changes in
Western Culture requirements
have continued to be tossed
about. The latest is that the
next two years will see several
three-quarter "pilot" courses

.tested as sequences for the re
quirement. The enemy in this
issue is cultural narrowness.
Halsey Royden, dean of
humanities and sciences,
preaches wide exposure to the
"goals and ideals of our cul
ture."
Back in early 1974-75 grade
inflation was the villain. It was
said to be a threat to the Uni
versity's academic prestige.
Winter quarter saw the "D"
grade reinstated.
Innovative learning prog
rams like SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program were threatened with
extinction at the hand of james
Gibbs, former dean of under
graduate studies. After a year
long debate, the programs
were salvaged and the con
troversial Gibbs asked to be re
lieved of his duties by 1976.
An overseas studies program
was not so lucky. Talks of
budget cut-backs began in
winter '75 and the center in
Beutelsbach was closed. Ef

forts to keep it open came
mostly from enthusiasts who
had experienced the foreign
learning trip, but their num
bers were too few. The center
in Berlin was also on the ropes,
but managed to hang on.
Tenure
Also in winter '75, Jerry Irish,
a popular assistant religious
studies professor who had re
ceived awards for excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
The decision was made against
a great tide of support from

students and unanimous back
ing by Irish's department.
In the following months, be
became the "cause celebre"
for worried faculty and con
cerned students critical of the
old "publish or perish" syn
drome. A committee was set
up, the Task Force on Tenure
and Teaching Quality, to inves
tigate tenure decisions.
Since then, several well
respected teachers have been
denied full professorships, in
cluding Sandra Bern, assistant
psychology professor this year.
Activism
Backtrack one more time to
winter-spring 1977 when cam
pus activism began to seriously
open its eyes after a five year
dormancy. It came to appear
grander in some ways, milder
in others, but as directed and
persistent as ever with protests
against University dealings in
South Africa armed forces re
cruiting on campus, and the
Bakke case.
On February 28, 60 students

occupied the office of Robert
Augsburger, then vice
president for business and fi
nance. Part of their objections
was with Augsburger's absten
tion on one of two "corporate
responsibility" resolutions at a
J.P. Stevens shareholders
meeting. Responsible use of
stockholder votes came to be a
major demand of students.
May 4, 450 demonstrators
marched on Lyman's office.
They asked that the University
reconsider its position on
South Africa resolutions. Five
days later on May 9, after a
noon rally that brought out 700
in the rain, 294 students were
arrested after a 16-hour sit-in in
Old Union.
Led by the Stanford Commit
tee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP), the stu
dents asked that the University
reverse its abstentions and
vote its 94,000 Ford Motor Co.
shares in favor of a stockholder
resolution mandating with
drawal from South Africa.
This year, SCRIP'S struggle
has continued, though with
less support from the students.
A recent rally on May 9 at
tracted about 325 persons.
More than 100 occupied the
Old Union but left to avoid ar
rest.
Minorities
The future of minorities in
colleges is still in doubt, the
latest blow, of course, being
the Bakke decision where the
California Supreme Court up
held Allan Bakke's contention
that he was unjustly refused
admission to the UC Davis
Medical School because pre
ference was given to minority
students to meet admissions
quotas.
Similar principles were on
trial back in November '74
when a proposal to cut minor
ity aid found much support, in
cluding that of former Dean
Gibbs. After three months, de
bate reached a high intensity
and a few rallies were held in
White Plaza.
The issue was "equity." One
side phrased their platform


On May 10, 1977 apartheid protesters staged a "sit-in" at Old Union
which resulted in 294 arrests.
saying low-income students
should receive aid on based on
need, not race. The other side
held that more aid should be
given minorities to alleviate
cultural disadvantages. Finally
the Faculty Senate com
promised and set up a limited
number of special benefits.
Other concerns
To many students, in the
midst of these early gropings
for the education everyone de
serves, another important de
mand was to live where they
thought they deserved. And in

the way, so they thought, was
the formerly notorious Larry
Horton, director of residential
education.
Most of the dissent came
from the fraternities who
didn't want to be included in
the housing draw. Even when
the housing office came up
with their solution — the
three-year guaranteed on
campus housing program —
many students must passed it
off as a "another Horton job."
In fall '75 and fall '76 another
conflict, important to many,
arose over whether the bonfire

would burn in stone-dry Lake
Lagunita.
Stanford students definitely
rose to the occasion on that
controversy. In the same spirit
of hilarity, the Hammer and
Coffin slate laughed their way
into seven out of 10 seats on
the ASSU Senate for '76-'77.
Though some deemed them
"capricious and obstructive,"
the Chaparral crew drew
mostly smiles and shrugs from
their ever-concerned consti
tuency.
This year, the slate of the
Stanford Organizing Commit

tee (SOC), a coalition of minor
ity and varied interest groups,
landed 12 candidates on the
ASSU Senate. But before they
got there, a few people for and
against the SOC slate were
censured for unethical muddy
campaign practices. Most stu
dents ignored it in true post-
Watergate form.
The student body shrugged
and shook its head again last
fall when another subject came
up — sororities. But a growing
number of young women per
sisted and on December 13,
the 33-year old ban on

sororities was lifted. An esti
mated 200 women attended
rush functions and 138 finally
settled into six new campus
sororities.
Next fall SCRIP will still be
around. Maybe the Bonfire will
be back. Western culture will
be going somewhere.
And President Lyman will
probably be wide awake for the
'78orientaton speech, wonder
ing what the new batch of stu
dents — freaks, jocks, geeks,
cruisers and legular diverse
types — will want to think ab
out.

was not so lucky. Talks of

Beutelsbach was closed. Ef

forts to keep it open came
mostly from enthusiasts who
had experienced the foreign
learning trip, but their num
bers were too few. The center
in Berlin was also on the ropes,
but managed to hang on.
Tenure
Also in winter '75, Jerry Irish,
a popular assistant religious
studies professor who had re
ceived awards for excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
The decision was made against
a great tide of support from

students and unanimous back
ing by Irish's department.
In the following months, be
became the "cause celebre"
for worried faculty and con
cerned students critical of the
old "publish or perish" syn
drome. A committee was set
up, the Task Force on Tenure
and Teaching Quality, to inves
tigate tenure decisions.
Since then, several well
respected teachers have been
denied full professorships, in
cluding Sandra Bern, assistant
psychology professor this year.
Activism
Backtrack one more time to
winter-spring 1977 when cam
pus activism began to seriously
open its eyes after a five year
dormancy. It came to appear
grander in some ways, milder
in others, but as directed and
persistent as ever with protests
against University dealings in
South Africa armed forces re
cruiting on campus, and the
Bakke case.
On February 28, 60 students

occupied the office of Robert
Augsburger, then vice
president for business and fi
nance. Part of their objections
was with Augsburger's absten
tion on one of two "corporate
responsibility" resolutions at a
J.P. Stevens shareholders
meeting. Responsible use of
stockholder votes came to be a
major demand of students.
May 4, 450 demonstrators
marched on Lyman's office.
They asked that the University
reconsider its position on
South Africa resolutions. Five
days later on May 9, after a
noon rally that brought out 700
in the rain, 294 students were
arrested after a 16-hour sit-in in
Old Union.
Led by the Stanford Commit
tee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP), the stu

shares in favor of a stockholder
resolution mandating with
drawal from South Africa.
This year, SCRIP'S struggle
has continued, though with
less support from the students.
A recent rally on May 9 at
tracted about 325 persons.
More than 100 occupied the
Old Union but left to avoid ar
rest.
Minorities
The future of minorities in
colleges is still in doubt, the
latest blow, of course, being
the Bakke decision where the
California Supreme Court up
held Allan Bakke's contention
that he was unjustly refused
admission to the UC Davis
Medical School because pre
ference was given to minority
students to meet admissions
quotas.
Similar principles were on
trial back in November '74
when a proposal to cut minor
ity aid found much support, in
cluding that of former Dean
Gibbs. After three months, de
bate reached a high intensity
and a few rallies were held in
White Plaza.
The issue was "equity." One
side phrased their platform

saying low-income students
should receive aid on based on
need, not race. The other side
held that more aid should be
given minorities to alleviate
cultural disadvantages. Finally
the Faculty Senate com
promised and set up a limited
number of special benefits.
Other concerns
To many students, in the
midst of these early gropings
for the education everyone de
serves, another important de
mand was to live where they
thought they deserved. And in

the way, so they thought, was
the formerly notorious Larry
Horton, director of residential
education.
Most of the dissent came
from the fraternities who
didn't want to be included in
the housing draw. Even when
the housing office came up
with their solution — the
three-year guaranteed on
campus housing program —
many students must passed it
off as a "another Horton job."
In fall '75 and fall '76 another
conflict, important to many,
arose over whether the bonfire

would burn in stone-dry Lake
Lagunita.
Stanford students definitely
rose to the occasion on that
controversy. In the same spirit
of hilarity, the Hammer and
Coffin slate laughed their way
into seven out of 10 seats on
the ASSU Senate for '76-'77.
Though some deemed them
"capricious and obstructive,"
the Chaparral crew drew
mostly smiles and shrugs from
their ever-concerned consti
tuency.
This year, the slate of the
Stanford Organizing Commit

tee (SOC), a coalition of minor
ity and varied interest groups,
landed 12 candidates on the
ASSU Senate. But before they
got there, a few people for and
against the SOC slate were
censured for unethical muddy
campaign practices. Most stu
dents ignored it in true post-
Watergate form.
The student body shrugged
and shook its head again last
fall when another subject came
up — sororities. But a growing
number of young women per
sisted and on December 13,
the 33-year old ban on

sororities was lifted. An esti
mated 200 women attended
rush functions and 138 finally
settled into six new campus
sororities.
Next fall SCRIP will still be
around. Maybe the Bonfire will
be back. Western culture will
be going somewhere.
And President Lyman will
probably be wide awake for the
'78orientaton speech, wonder
ing what the new batch of stu
dents — freaks, jocks, geeks,
cruisers and legular diverse
types — will want to think ab
out.
You would think that all the
flows and cross-currents hap
pening around a class going
through four years of college
would run their course and fi
nally reach some happy end
ing.
Luckily, it doesn't happen
that way. What happens is a lot
of hot little affairs flare up and
burn out while some long-term
issues smolder on to be occa
sionally tended.
The year 1974 was tainted by
a debate over innovative edu
cation, while minority students
fought for their cause's survival
against threats of minority aid
cuts. In 1975 distinguished fa
culty members were shaken by
decisions denying tenure to
such able "under" professors
as Jerry Irish.
Also in 1974, fans at football
games were hollering "Im
peach Christiansen! We want
Benjamin!" (or was it
Waldvogel, or back to Cor
dova?), while fraternities were
alarmed by Larry Horton's
campus housing plans which
threatened their existence.
The "Chaparral Era" lasted
for a while last year v ith the

election of the Hammer and
Coffin slate to the ASSU Se
nate, and the next year
ushered in more serious busi
ness when some senators-elect
were disqualified in a cam
paign marred by dirty tricks.
This year the campaigns for
women, gays, and minorities
kept grinding. New highlights
on a diffrent level of concern
were the Bonfire getting can
celed and sororities slip
ping back onto campus.
The combination of both the
highbrow and lowbrow issues
over the last four years has
added different shades of per
ception to people's concep
tion of their "Stanford experi
ence."
Education
Fortunately for everyone, a
lot of thought over the years
has gone not only to the issues
just mentioned, but to un
dramatic issues affecting how
we get our education.
Last quarter, an editorial in
the Stanford Daily detailing
reasons for a student's
dropping-out resurrected (to
serious conversation level, at
least) insecurities about the

worth of a college education.
For a couple of weeks, stu
dents were reassessing their
grade-grubbing motivations
pitting "working within the
system" against conscientious
boycott of it as means of attain
ing individual and social prog
ress.
And all the while, changes in
Western Culture requirements
have continued to be tossed
about. The latest is that the
next two years will see several
three-quarter "pilot" courses

.tested as sequences for the re
quirement. The enemy in this
issue is cultural narrowness.
Halsey Royden, dean of
humanities and sciences,
preaches wide exposure to the
"goals and ideals of our cul
ture."
Back in early 1974-75 grade
inflation was the villain. It was
said to be a threat to the Uni
versity's academic prestige.
Winter quarter saw the "D"
grade reinstated.
Innovative learning prog
rams like SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program were threatened with
extinction at the hand of james
Gibbs, former dean of under
graduate studies. After a year
long debate, the programs
were salvaged and the con

cluding that of former Dean
Gibbs. After three months, de
bate reached a high intensity
and a few rallies were held in
White Plaza.

saying low-income students
should receive aid on based on
need, not race. The other side
held that more aid should be
given minorities to alleviate
cultural disadvantages. Finally
the Faculty Senate com
promised and set up a limited
number of special benefits.
Other concerns
To many students, in the
midst of these early gropings
for the education everyone de
serves, another important de
mand was to live where they
thought they deserved. And in

the way, so they thought, was
the formerly notorious Larry
Horton, director of residential
education.
Most of the dissent came
from the fraternities who
didn't want to be included in
the housing draw. Even when
the housing office came up
with their solution — the
three-year guaranteed on
campus housing program —
many students must passed it
off as a "another Horton job."
In fall '75 and fall '76 another
conflict, important to many,
arose over whether the bonfire

would burn in stone-dry Lake
Lagunita.
Stanford students definitely
rose to the occasion on that
controversy. In the same spirit
of hilarity, the Hammer and
Coffin slate laughed their way
into seven out of 10 seats on
the ASSU Senate for '76-'77.
Though some deemed them
"capricious and obstructive,"
the Chaparral crew drew
mostly smiles and shrugs from
their ever-concerned consti
tuency.
This year, the slate of the
Stanford Organizing Commit

tee (SOC), a coalition of minor
ity and varied interest groups,
landed 12 candidates on the
ASSU Senate. But before they
got there, a few people for and
against the SOC slate were
censured for unethical muddy
campaign practices. Most stu
dents ignored it in true post-
Watergate form.
The student body shrugged
and shook its head again last
fall when another subject came
up — sororities. But a growing
number of young women per
sisted and on December 13,
the 33-year old ban on

sororities was lifted. An esti
mated 200 women attended
rush functions and 138 finally
settled into six new campus
sororities.
Next fall SCRIP will still be
around. Maybe the Bonfire will
be back. Western culture will
be going somewhere.
And President Lyman will
probably be wide awake for the
'78orientaton speech, wonder
ing what the new batch of stu
dents — freaks, jocks, geeks,
cruisers and legular diverse
types — will want to think ab
out.
You would think that all the
flows and cross-currents hap
pening around a class going
through four years of college
would run their course and fi
nally reach some happy end
ing.
Luckily, it doesn't happen
that way. What happens is a lot
of hot little affairs flare up and
burn out while some long-term
issues smolder on to be occa
sionally tended.
The year 1974 was tainted by
a debate over innovative edu
cation, while minority students
fought for their cause's survival
against threats of minority aid
cuts. In 1975 distinguished fa
culty members were shaken by
decisions denying tenure to
such able "under" professors
as Jerry Irish.
Also in 1974, fans at football
games were hollering "Im
peach Christiansen! We want
Benjamin!" (or was it
Waldvogel, or back to Cor
dova?), while fraternities were
alarmed by Larry Horton's
campus housing plans which
threatened their existence.
The "Chaparral Era" lasted
for a while last year v ith the

election of the Hammer and
Coffin slate to the ASSU Se
nate, and the next year
ushered in more serious busi
ness when some senators-elect
were disqualified in a cam
paign marred by dirty tricks.
This year the campaigns for
women, gays, and minorities
kept grinding. New highlights
on a diffrent level of concern
were the Bonfire getting can
celed and sororities slip
ping back onto campus.
The combination of both the
highbrow and lowbrow issues
over the last four years has
added different shades of per
ception to people's concep
tion of their "Stanford experi
ence."
Education
Fortunately for everyone, a
lot of thought over the years
has gone not only to the issues
just mentioned, but to un
dramatic issues affecting how
we get our education.
Last quarter, an editorial in
the Stanford Daily detailing
reasons for a student's
dropping-out resurrected (to
serious conversation level, at
least) insecurities about the

worth of a college education.
For a couple of weeks, stu
dents were reassessing their
grade-grubbing motivations
pitting "working within the
system" against conscientious
boycott of it as means of attain
ing individual and social prog
ress.
And all the while, changes in
Western Culture requirements
have continued to be tossed
about. The latest is that the
next two years will see several
three-quarter "pilot" courses

.tested as sequences for the re
quirement. The enemy in this
issue is cultural narrowness.
Halsey Royden, dean of
humanities and sciences,
preaches wide exposure to the
"goals and ideals of our cul
ture."
Back in early 1974-75 grade
inflation was the villain. It was
said to be a threat to the Uni
versity's academic prestige.
Winter quarter saw the "D"
grade reinstated.
Innovative learning prog
rams like SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program were threatened with
extinction at the hand of james
Gibbs, former dean of under
graduate studies. After a year
long debate, the programs
were salvaged and the con
troversial Gibbs asked to be re
lieved of his duties by 1976.
An overseas studies program
was not so lucky. Talks of
budget cut-backs began in
winter '75 and the center in
Beutelsbach was closed. Ef

forts to keep it open came
mostly from enthusiasts who
had experienced the foreign
learning trip, but their num
bers were too few. The center
in Berlin was also on the ropes,
but managed to hang on.
Tenure
Also in winter '75, Jerry Irish,
a popular assistant religious
studies professor who had re
ceived awards for excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
The decision was made against
a great tide of support from

students and unanimous back
ing by Irish's department.
In the following months, be
became the "cause celebre"
for worried faculty and con
cerned students critical of the
old "publish or perish" syn
drome. A committee was set
up, the Task Force on Tenure
and Teaching Quality, to inves
tigate tenure decisions.
Since then, several well
respected teachers have been
denied full professorships, in
cluding Sandra Bern, assistant
psychology professor this year.
Activism
Backtrack one more time to
winter-spring 1977 when cam
pus activism began to seriously
open its eyes after a five year
dormancy. It came to appear
grander in some ways, milder
in others, but as directed and
persistent as ever with protests
against University dealings in
South Africa armed forces re
cruiting on campus, and the
Bakke case.
On February 28, 60 students

occupied the office of Robert
Augsburger, then vice
president for business and fi
nance. Part of their objections
was with Augsburger's absten
tion on one of two "corporate
responsibility" resolutions at a
J.P. Stevens shareholders
meeting. Responsible use of
stockholder votes came to be a
major demand of students.
May 4, 450 demonstrators
marched on Lyman's office.
They asked that the University
reconsider its position on
South Africa resolutions. Five
days later on May 9, after a
noon rally that brought out 700
in the rain, 294 students were
arrested after a 16-hour sit-in in
Old Union.
Led by the Stanford Commit
tee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP), the stu
dents asked that the University
reverse its abstentions and
vote its 94,000 Ford Motor Co.
shares in favor of a stockholder
resolution mandating with
drawal from South Africa.
This year, SCRIP'S struggle
has continued, though with
less support from the students.
A recent rally on May 9 at
tracted about 325 persons.
More than 100 occupied the
Old Union but left to avoid ar
rest.
Minorities
The future of minorities in
colleges is still in doubt, the
latest blow, of course, being
the Bakke decision where the
California Supreme Court up
held Allan Bakke's contention
that he was unjustly refused
admission to the UC Davis
Medical School because pre
ference was given to minority
students to meet admissions
quotas.
Similar principles were on
trial back in November '74
when a proposal to cut minor
ity aid found much support, in
cluding that of former Dean
Gibbs. After three months, de
bate reached a high intensity
and a few rallies were held in
White Plaza.
