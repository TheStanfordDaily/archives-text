# Time capsules- A peanut and an armband?
## 
### Jan Miller 
One peanut from a Thursday
night at the "O," a vial of algae
water from Lake Lagunita, a
SCRIP armband protesting
apartheid, and a tennis ball
from the 1978 NCAA tennis
championships are a few
pieces of memorabilia to be
preserved for posterity in the
Class of '78 time capsule.
The Capsule will be cere
moniously buried beneath the
solid bronze '78 class plate dur
ing Class Day festivities Satur
day.
"We'd like people to say
"what's this?' why'd they put
that in?' when they open it
someday in the future," said
Senior Class President Clark
Sterling. "Its contents are a
combination of seriousness
and fun from '78."
Laid under the arcade of the
Inner Quad near the Geology
Corner, the '78 class plate will
be the 83rd laid since the tradi
tion was begun by seniors in
1896.
The class plate idea was
originated by the exercises
committee of the Class of '96,

chaired by Robert Willis
Campbell. In their search for a
suitable monument to be dedi
cated on Class Day, the com
mittee conceived the idea of
replacing one of the cement
paved blocks under the ar
cades with a bronze plaque
bearing the numerals of their
class.
The site of the 1896 plate was
chosen when the Quad had
not yet been completed. It was
decided that the plaque should
be situated squarely in front of
the not yet built Memorial
Church, and thus all those en
tering or leaving the church
would forever view the '96
numerals right side up.
Then engineering student
Ray Lyman Wilbur (later to be
come president of the Univer
sity) executed the two-way de
sign for the plate, setting the
precedent for all succeeding
class plates. Thus through an
idea, approved by Jane Stan
ford and President David Starr
Jordan, a tradition was born.
All of the plates are custom
cast of bronze with figures
formed with antimony lead

inlay except those four made
during World War I when
bronze was unobtainable. A
rich, red-colored concrete
mixture was substituted for the
metal.
The plates, which are or
dered in groups of four to save
money, cost $769 each this
year, and the time capsule's
stainless steel box and scroll
tube, including installation
fees, is $390. The price of the
entire operation is split bet
ween the Senior Class and the
President's office according to
Melinda Howe, assistant to the
director of University rela
tions.
The time capsule contents
are selected from suggestions
submitted by senior class
members. The class presidents
make the final selections,
based on space available in the
time capsule, a stainless steel
box measuring 18 inches
square by 12 inches deep.
Although traditionally in
cluded in the time capsule,
there will be no class scroll this
year, according to Sterling.
He said it was "too difficult

to get everyone's signature"
and he would rather have
everyone sign the scroll or no
one.
The class of '78 has chosen to
be remembered by the follow
ing items: One Quad, one
Dolly boot, a Sun Bowl program,
Big Came button, Big Came
Week poster, "Saturday Night
Fever" and LSJUMB album,
"Senior Almanac," Senior
T-shirt, Music Man program,
Gaieties program and ticket,
Casino Night invitation and
chips, Senior Brunch invita
tion, Catsby Night champagne
cork, Class Day program, Nuc
lear Power "No Thanks" but
ton, Saturday and Sunday

Night Flicks Poster, five Stan
ford Dailys, '78 news high
lights, six "Senior Sheet"
newsletters, and some '78
commemorative stamps.
Some items preserved by
preceding classes have in
cluded the Pill, a pair of de
ckers shoes, election buttons
and a tube of clean air.
Provost William Miller will
deliver the dedication at this
year's Class Day as the four
senior class officers lower the
time capsule into place, and
seniors fling their final student
ID cards into the pit with sol
emnity as dirt, concrete, and
bronze serve to immortalize
the class of 1978.

moniously buried beneath the
solid bronze '78 class plate dur
ing Class Day festivities Satur
day.
"We'd like people to say
"what's this?' why'd they put
that in?' when they open it
someday in the future," said
Senior Class President Clark
Sterling. "Its contents are a
combination of seriousness
and fun from '78."
Laid under the arcade of the
Inner Quad near the Geology
Corner, the '78 class plate will
be the 83rd laid since the tradi
tion was begun by seniors in
1896.
The class plate idea was
originated by the exercises
committee of the Class of '96,

chaired by Robert Willis
Campbell. In their search for a
suitable monument to be dedi
cated on Class Day, the com
mittee conceived the idea of
replacing one of the cement
paved blocks under the ar
cades with a bronze plaque
bearing the numerals of their
class.
The site of the 1896 plate was
chosen when the Quad had
not yet been completed. It was
decided that the plaque should
be situated squarely in front of
the not yet built Memorial
Church, and thus all those en
tering or leaving the church
would forever view the '96
numerals right side up.
Then engineering student
Ray Lyman Wilbur (later to be
come president of the Univer
sity) executed the two-way de
sign for the plate, setting the
precedent for all succeeding
class plates. Thus through an
idea, approved by Jane Stan
ford and President David Starr
Jordan, a tradition was born.
All of the plates are custom
cast of bronze with figures
formed with antimony lead

inlay except those four made
during World War I when
bronze was unobtainable. A
rich, red-colored concrete
mixture was substituted for the
metal.
The plates, which are or
dered in groups of four to save
money, cost $769 each this
year, and the time capsule's
stainless steel box and scroll
tube, including installation
fees, is $390. The price of the
entire operation is split bet
ween the Senior Class and the
President's office according to
Melinda Howe, assistant to the
director of University rela
tions.
The time capsule contents
are selected from suggestions
submitted by senior class
members. The class presidents
make the final selections,
based on space available in the
time capsule, a stainless steel
box measuring 18 inches
square by 12 inches deep.
Although traditionally in
cluded in the time capsule,
there will be no class scroll this
year, according to Sterling.
He said it was "too difficult

to get everyone's signature"
and he would rather have
everyone sign the scroll or no
one.
The class of '78 has chosen to
be remembered by the follow
ing items: One Quad, one
Dolly boot, a Sun Bowl program,
Big Came button, Big Came
Week poster, "Saturday Night
Fever" and LSJUMB album,
"Senior Almanac," Senior
T-shirt, Music Man program,
Gaieties program and ticket,
Casino Night invitation and
chips, Senior Brunch invita
tion, Catsby Night champagne
cork, Class Day program, Nuc
lear Power "No Thanks" but
ton, Saturday and Sunday

Night Flicks Poster, five Stan
ford Dailys, '78 news high
lights, six "Senior Sheet"
newsletters, and some '78
commemorative stamps.
Some items preserved by
preceding classes have in
cluded the Pill, a pair of de
ckers shoes, election buttons
and a tube of clean air.
Provost William Miller will
deliver the dedication at this
year's Class Day as the four
senior class officers lower the
time capsule into place, and
seniors fling their final student
ID cards into the pit with sol
emnity as dirt, concrete, and
bronze serve to immortalize
the class of 1978.
