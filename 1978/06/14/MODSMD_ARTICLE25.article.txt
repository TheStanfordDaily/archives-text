Welcome to Stanford and welcome to
The Stanford Daily's Summer Visitor's
Guide. What we hope to accomplish in the
next 20-some pages is to familiarize you just
a little with the University and the sur
rounding area. Mind you, we have no illu
sions about making you feel comfortable
here — just a little more informed.
A lot of you here this Summer are un
familiar with Stanford. You may be visiting
Summer School students or you may be
here for a one week conference of one sort
or another. Whatever, you probably don't
know anything about the Daily either ex
cept for our dubious distinction of being
the first newspaper in the country not sus
pected of a crime to be searched by a law
enforcement agency with a search warrant.
You may remember also that only a few
weeks ago the Supreme Court of the Un
ited States decided that the constitution's
protection of the press didn't protect it

from becoming the playground of the men
in blue. But enough of that; we fought the
battle for over seven years only to lose in
the last round but there's nothing we can't
be proud as hell about.
If you're going to be around for a while,
the Daily will begin its twice weekly publi
cation (Tuesdays and Fridays) on June 27.
The papers will be distributed free of
charge around campus and Palo Alto. Pick
up a copy.
We welcome all of you who are in
terested in working for the Daily this Sum
mer. Take a look at the staff ad below and
stop by the office on your next walk past
Terman if you have the inkling.
If you have any questions or complaints
about the Daily's coverage this Summer or
about future improvements on this issue,
stop by and we'll hear you out. We want to
know what you're thinking.
