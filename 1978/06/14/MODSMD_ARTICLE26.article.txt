Each of us has a special reason for making Stanford his or her
home for four years. For some, it is the hope of becoming, as one
eastern school puts it, "a member of the family of educated men
and women." For others, it is the promise of financial success after
graduation. Still others choose Stanford because "Dad went
there," or perhaps because he didn't.
Students who join the staff of the Stanford Daily also have a
variety of reasons and ambitions. A school newspaper may be the
most familiar-looking place on campus for freshmen who worked
on their high school paper. For those interested in journalism or
writing as a career, the Daily is, as a professor in the Communica
tion Department has said, "the most realistic communications lab
around." Daily alumni have gone on to interesting and occasion
ally lucrative careers with such newsgathering organizations as the
Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post,
the Associated Press, United Press International, the Boston Globe
and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to name just a few.
After a few days (sometimes a few hours) on the staff, the friend
ship and camaraderie of the place can become important reasons
