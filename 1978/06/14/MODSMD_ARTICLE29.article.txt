# Leland Stanford: many faceted man
## 
### 
Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity was founded out of a
very simple but intense love
and memory of a mother and
father for their son, but its ide
als were so broad as to include
the education of all children
and the desire to teach people
to do something useful with
their lives.
Leland Stanford was born in
1824 in Waterliet, New York.
He never received the univer
sity education that was to mean
so much to him for others in
the founding of his university.
Instead, he was educated at
country schools and later ap
prenticed himself to a law firm
in Albany. He was admitted to
the New York and Wisconsin
bars.
His future wife, Jane Lat
hrop, was born in Albany, New
York, in 1828. She was the
daughter of moderately well
to-do parents, and received
the normal private school edu
cation that was fitting for girls
of her day.
The Stanford were married
in 1850. In 1852, Leland went
alone to San Francisco to begin
his business ventures. Jane
stayed behind in New York
until 1855 to care for her ailing

father, to whom she was very
close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until a tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a
new life they moved to Sac
ramento via Nicaragua in 1856;
Leland's father had told them
that California was the place to
be.
In Sacramento, Leland
purchased his brothers' store,
and then began his political
life. In 1856, he helped to or
ganize Sacramento's Republi
can party. Four years later, he
was chosen as a delegate to the
Chicago convention, where he
supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence
with his election in 1861 as
governor of California. As
former Stanford student, and
later president, Ray Lyman
Wilbur writes in his Memoirs,
"as governor of California he
had led in the battle to keep
California in the Union against
those who wanted it to follow
the South or to set it up as a
separate republic." In 1885, he
was to be elected to the United
States Senate.

Stanford museum docent
and chairman of the Stanford
Family Portfolio Peg Haneberg
says that Leland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the stand
ing armies of Europe were a
waste of time and manpower,"
she says."He believed that
disputes should be settled by
arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stan
ford and three other men
formed the Central Pacific Rail
road, of which he later was
elected president. Later, a
series of complicated mergers
consolidated several railroads
into the Central Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at the University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates were known as the
"big four."
"He has been characterized
by some historians as a robber
barron," he adds. "If he was
really so despicable he
wouldn't have been liked so
much by his employees."
At first the railroad was con
sidered to be a risky financial
venture, but it later proved to
be a most lucrative investment,
as it was later to help support
the University. To celebrate

the first transcontinental line,
Leland drove a golden spike in
a ceremony in Promontory,
Utah, in 1869.
Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some mea
sure of play. In 1870 he bought
his first race horse, named Oc
cident. He later bred, trained,
and raced horses very success
fully; one year his horse won a
world's record. When the
horse died, Kentucky racers
were relieved.
An investment in the
California Street Cable Rail
road Franchise made Stanford
an even wealthier man. He
tried to talk his influential
friends into investing in the
company, but only a few were
willing to take the chance; he
bought most of the shares him
self.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the
cable cars, the stock eventually
made him an even wealthier
man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881, he bought

a vineyard in Vina, Ca., and
tried to make table wine. Ac
cording to Haneberg, he in
vested a lot of money in wine
and made good brandy, but
never got good table wine.
'Farmer at heart'
Hansen says that Stanford
was a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
"He was a pioneer of viticul
ture," he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina
were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne,
but they failed and became
brandy. His Weidel Winery at
Mission San Jose still produces
successfully.
Jane had meanwhile made
her husband her career, and
the two were very close. Be
cause of her husband's many
personal and business in
terests, she knew many famous
people, traveled widely, and
lived well.
Hansen says that "Jane's
outstanding characteristic was
that she was deeply religious.
Her life centered in her belief
in immortality and Jesus
Christ." Jane supported
