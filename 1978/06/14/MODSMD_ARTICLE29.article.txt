# Leland Stanford: many faceted man
## 
### 
Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity was founded out of a
very simple but intense love
and memory of a mother and
father for their son, but its ide
als were so broad as to include
the education of all children
and the desire to teach people
to do something useful with
their lives.
Leland Stanford was born in
1824 in Waterliet, New York.
He never received the univer
sity education that was to mean
so much to him for others in
the founding of his university.
Instead, he was educated at
country schools and later ap
prenticed himself to a law firm
in Albany. He was admitted to
the New York and Wisconsin
bars.
His future wife, Jane Lat
hrop, was born in Albany, New
York, in 1828. She was the
daughter of moderately well
to-do parents, and received
the normal private school edu
cation that was fitting for girls
of her day.
The Stanford were married
in 1850. In 1852, Leland went
alone to San Francisco to begin
his business ventures. Jane
stayed behind in New York
until 1855 to care for her ailing

father, to whom she was very
close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until a tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a
new life they moved to Sac
ramento via Nicaragua in 1856;
Leland's father had told them
that California was the place to
be.
In Sacramento, Leland
purchased his brothers' store,
and then began his political
life. In 1856, he helped to or
ganize Sacramento's Republi
can party. Four years later, he
was chosen as a delegate to the
Chicago convention, where he
supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence
with his election in 1861 as
governor of California. As
former Stanford student, and
later president, Ray Lyman
Wilbur writes in his Memoirs,
"as governor of California he
had led in the battle to keep
California in the Union against
those who wanted it to follow
the South or to set it up as a
separate republic." In 1885, he
was to be elected to the United
States Senate.

Stanford museum docent
and chairman of the Stanford
Family Portfolio Peg Haneberg
says that Leland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the stand
ing armies of Europe were a
waste of time and manpower,"
she says."He believed that
disputes should be settled by
arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stan
ford and three other men
formed the Central Pacific Rail
road, of which he later was
elected president. Later, a
series of complicated mergers
consolidated several railroads
into the Central Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at the University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates were known as the
"big four."
"He has been characterized
by some historians as a robber
barron," he adds. "If he was
really so despicable he
wouldn't have been liked so
much by his employees."
At first the railroad was con
sidered to be a risky financial
venture, but it later proved to
be a most lucrative investment,
as it was later to help support
the University. To celebrate

the first transcontinental line,
Leland drove a golden spike in
a ceremony in Promontory,
Utah, in 1869.
Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some mea
sure of play. In 1870 he bought
his first race horse, named Oc
cident. He later bred, trained,
and raced horses very success
fully; one year his horse won a
world's record. When the
horse died, Kentucky racers
were relieved.
An investment in the
California Street Cable Rail
road Franchise made Stanford
an even wealthier man. He
tried to talk his influential
friends into investing in the
company, but only a few were
willing to take the chance; he
bought most of the shares him
self.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the
cable cars, the stock eventually
made him an even wealthier
man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881, he bought

a vineyard in Vina, Ca., and
tried to make table wine. Ac
cording to Haneberg, he in
vested a lot of money in wine
and made good brandy, but
never got good table wine.
'Farmer at heart'
Hansen says that Stanford
was a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
"He was a pioneer of viticul
ture," he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina
were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne,
but they failed and became
brandy. His Weidel Winery at
Mission San Jose still produces
successfully.
Jane had meanwhile made
her husband her career, and
the two were very close. Be
cause of her husband's many
personal and business in
terests, she knew many famous
people, traveled widely, and
lived well.
Hansen says that "Jane's
outstanding characteristic was
that she was deeply religious.
Her life centered in her belief
in immortality and Jesus
Christ." Jane supported

Catholic charities, but neither
she nor Leland belonged to any
particular church.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco."
In his Memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beauti
ful woman — some thought
she resembeld Queen Victoria
in general appearance, which
rather pleased her. She had a
commanding presence and
friendly dignity which only a
great heart, courage and
strong convictions and charac
ter can give."
Up until their 18th year of
marriage, the Stanfords re
mained childless. Finally, in
1868 in Sacramento, Leland Jr.
was born. Jane was 40 at the
time of his birth; according to
Stanford Art Museum docent
Glenda Northway, he was her
"precious jewel."
Leland Jr. had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated
by the best tutors. For a while
he attended Heald Business
College in San Francisco.
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it

that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved the
boots, and slept in them the
first night. The next day, he saw
a poor boy who had no shoes,
so Leland Jr. gave him his
boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr.,
was very intelligent, had a
good sense of humor and en
joyed playing boyish pranks.
Yet "he was brought up to be
aware of the responsibilities
that wealth brought."
In his Memoirs, Wilbur
writes that Leland and Jane had
a "happy and dignified home
life" and trained their son in a
"sensible and careful way . . .
for responsibility that he would
handle wisely and well their
vast fortune which they
thought would become
his. .
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vac
ationing in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He
got worse in Naples and Rome,
and in 1884 died in Florence.
He was 16.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When

into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is
said that Leland Jr. appeared
and said, "live for humanity."
When he awoke, Leland said,
"California's children shall be
my children." Thus Leland
founded Leland Stanford
Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her
son, established the Leland
Stanford Junior Museum.
Musuems were her son's pas
sion and lifelong dream; the
fall he was 16, he had planned
to enter Harvard and study
courses pertaining to the run
ning of a museum.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
University was laid on May 14
in 1887 — it would have been
Leland Jr.'s 19th birthday. In a
copper box in the cornerstone,
the Stanfords placed, among
other documents pertaining to
the organization of the Univer
sity, a photograph of their son.
The University was to open
four years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for his University.
Although the Stanfords had
various houses, Palo Alto was
home, so he chose his Palo
Alto farm.
"The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising

race horses ought to be good
for students."
Wilbur continues, "I particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea
of what education should be,
that it should be for'direct use
fulness in life.' He wanted it to
break away from the
tradition-bound classical and
philosophical programs of
some of the older eastern in
stitutions, and to develop
along the more practical and
scientific lines in which Cornell
University, the Johns Hopkins
University and the Mas
sachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering.
Jordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who
could "see and try new ways of
doing things. Such a man he
found in David Starr Jordan."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford
was coed. Girls were housed in
Roble Hall; the men in Encina
Hall. Hansen says that Encina
has been "slowly remodeled"
and now houses offices, the
Economics Department and
the Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; Haneberg
says that Leland "favored"
women. But Jane went along

with her husband's wishes,
and in spite of her misgivings,
women were respected and
given equal rights.
To welcome the women,
Jane gave tea parties at their
Palo Alto home, the site of the
present Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't pro
hibit women; in 1899, women
began to increase. Jane be
came concerned that more
women than men would attend
the University that had been
dedicated to her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited
more than 500 women. "Up
until the early '30s, they were
known as the 'Stanford 500.' It
was later rescinded by the trus
tees."
No tuition
In the early days there was
no tuition; Leland believed that
all his "children" should be en
titled to an education. Stu
dents were responsible for
paying their own miscellane
ous expenses, and the Univer
sity charged $4.50 weekly for
room and board.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new
educational institution could
be expected to encounter.
Wilbur writes that "not only
was the university undergoing
organization, with educational

processes in debate at practi
cally every meeting of the fa
culty, but the students them
selves were likewise develop
ing their own organizations,
their athletic teams, their de
bating, literary and musical
societies and fraternities. . .
"A good many. . .new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a
few became a lasting part of
Stanford life. With the trial and
error method there de
veloped good leadership and
some rather unique and ap
propriate customs. . . We
were starting from the very be
ginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two
years. But the young University
was devastated by the death of
its founder in 1893.
There was some question if
the University could survive fi
nancially after Leland's death.
The estate was tied up in court
for some time. Jane, who had a
massive jewelry collection
second only to the queen of
England, established the Jewel
Fund, the money of which was
used to pay for salaries and
books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she

wanted, she "plunged full
speed ahead" to save the Uni
versity.
"When Leland died, the
lawyers advised her to close
the University," Hansen says.
"She refused, saying, 'If the
school closed down I would
have nothing to live for.' The
University became her son;
every energy and dollar mus
tered went to the University. It
was part of her Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion
as to the cause of her death.
Wilbur and Haneberg concur
that death was caused by a
heart attack. Rumors at the
time had it that she was
poisoned with strychnine by a
maid . . . "as was headlined in
some of the more sensational
newspapers," writes Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed,
along with her husband and
son, in the mausoleum, set
apart from the main grounds in
a grove of oak trees.
Another shock was to come
to the University, this time in
the form of the massive 1906
earthquake. The new Outer
Quad, much of the museum,
the library, the gym, arches
and Jane's beloved, recently
built Memorial Church were
badly damaged. The statue of
biologist Agassiz, located in
front of Jordan Hall, fell head
first into the pavement. A stu
dent and fireman were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Uni
versity was relieved that Jane
wasn't alive to see the damage,
as that in itself would have kil
led her. "It was just a case of
starting all over again."
"Starting all over again"
meant immediately beginning
restoration of the damaged
buildings. Wilbur writes that
President Jordan issued a
statement saying that "the ac
tual needs of the growing Uni
versity" would be first consi
dered. "No backward" steps
were taken in repairs, nor were
faculty numbers reduced. For a
while, the University could not
accept any more students; the
year after the quake, students
returned "in greater number
than ever before."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some
philosophical lessons from the
earthquake, commenting that
'forever man must rise above
his own creations.' " The
young university soon fully re
covered.
