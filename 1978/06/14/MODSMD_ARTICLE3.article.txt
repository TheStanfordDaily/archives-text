# Departure from traditional service
## Marty to give sermon 
### Sara Lessley 
For the graduating seniors,
the traditional baccalaureate
service will be held this year,
but with a few changes, accord
ing to Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly.
This year's baccalaureate will
be held outside Memorial
Church, he said. In the past,
when the service was held in
side the church, there was
"some unhappiness" because
not everyone was able to at
tend the ceremony due to the
limited seating available.
The church seats about 1100.
About 3000 chairs will be set
upin the Inner Quad in front of
Memorial Church for this
year's service, Hamerton-Kelly
added.
Moving outside the church is
also an attempt to make the
service "sufficiently inter
religious" so that "non-
Christians feel they can attend
and participate," Hamerton-
Kelly said.
The church is about as "spec
ifically" Christian as is possi
ble, he added.
In addition to the traditional
baccalaureate participants, a
Hillel representative will also
take part in this year's cere

mony, according to Pam Strike,
senior class president.
Strike said baccalaureate
planners are "trying to involve
all faiths . . . it's not geared to
ward any particular religion."
"The purpose of bac
calaureate is to express the re
ligious and spiritual dimen
sions of education,"
Hamerton-Kelly added.
During the hour ceremony
scheduled for the Saturday be
fore commencement,
Hamerton-Kelly, two senior
class presidents, the Hillel rep
resentative and baccalaureate

speaker Martin Marty will take
part.
Marty, Assoc. Dean of the
University of Chicago Divinity
School, will give a sermon enti
tled "Seek Simplicity and Dis
trust It," Strike said.
Hamerton-Kelly said Marty's
theme is a "reflection on the
American tendency to simplify
or oversimplify and to assume
that the simple solution is
best."
He added that Marty is a
"very prominent religious fi
â– gure . . . we're very lucky to
have gotten him."
