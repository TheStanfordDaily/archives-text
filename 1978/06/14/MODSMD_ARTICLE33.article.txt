The capsule reviews which

the most recent work of Harry
Killas, the Daily's resident re
staurant reviewer. Harry's taste
is wide, reliable and entirely
free of national prejudices. The
prices he quotes are approxi

give an idea of the general
range in any particular restaur
ant.
Chinese
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it com

bines uncommonly good ser
vice with some of the best
Chinese cooking in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresis
tible tomato-cherry sauce with
scallions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen

and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no
longer cheap, Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan
style. Prices are lower than
Chef Chu's, but the portions
are smaller. One is advised to

order an extra bowl of rice.
Service is attentive.
Kung pao beef ($4.25-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a
challenge to eat — the prawns
are not shelled.
An excellent dish at the

China Lion, however, is the
pungent chicken. Juicy deep
fried chicken pieces arrive in a
slightly-sweet garlic sauce with
peppers. Other successful of
ferings here are the squid and
shredded pork and the tender
beef and mushroom in oyster
sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and
a civilized mood. The menu is
diverse and competently
served, and it includes both
standards such as sliced chic
ken and snow peas ($3.50), and

specialties like Hunan ham
($22), which must be ordered
in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and
sour is spicier, but not as sour
as Chef Chu's. The house spe
cial soup ($2.50) — sizzling rice
with chicken, ham, shrimp and
vegetables in a rich chicken
broth — is memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.75) are treated with re
spect. The scallops are not
tough from overcooking and
contrast well with the accom
panying water chestnuts. The
generals' chicken ($4.50), sub
tly spiced tender chicken in a
bed of crunch snow peas, is
excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively
generous, and the prices com
pare with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is

more distinct and hotter than
at the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and
a must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.95) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for
its plentiful serving, but also
for the chile peppers cooked in
it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.
French
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gance of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretension
of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows im
agination: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($9.50), L'escalopine
de Veau a la Bolognaise for two
(s2l), Chicken Cynthia ($8.50)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta, $6
— for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The
Liaison Salad a la Chantilly for
two ($6) with lettuce,
cucumber, olive, bacon, feta
cheese and herbs, and the
Medallions of Spring Lamb
($9.25) sauteed with fresh tara
gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the

Bay Area and it continues his
policy of good food at reason
able prices.
Le diner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy vin
aigrette dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include pip
ing hot escargot de Bourgogne
($3.50) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($3), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream —
$7.50) are inconsistent. Some
are marvelous, but others, not
satisfactorily demembraned,
are chewy and rubbery with a
stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots and oysters.
Pate Maison ($2.50) is of the
pureed liver variety, but too
dry. Entrees come with soup
du jour and salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak
with green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely
tender, but the veal is too thick
for classic escalopes. Rather,
they resembled veal medall
ions. Truite Plemontaise (fresh
trout with white wine sauce —
$7.50) is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with ice
cream, nuts and Grand Mar
nier is a visual as well as taste
treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez (ustine
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss Sunday Champagne
Brunch. The incredible buffet
is already a legend in the Bay
Area. Many students here fast

for two days before parting
with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas
of its menu.
Everything is a specialty of
the provinces of France:
Canard Normande for two
(s2l), Care d'Agneau Dijon
naise for two (s2l). The imagi-

nation of Chef Jean-Pierre
Doigneau shows in his sterling
sauces and in his seasonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($9), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($3.50) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two
first-rate appetizers are the
savoury escargots ($4), pun
gent with garlic and the meaty
ham crepes ($3) in a superior
sauce mornay. Two interesting
soups are the Sherried Con
somme (warm or cold —
$1.75), and when available,
cream of fresh crayfish ($3.25).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($11.25) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed

duck) in particular is outstand
ing.
For dessert try the frozen
strawberry mousse ($2) or the
dramatic Grand Marnier souf
fle ($3.75). Don't pass up
another house specialty — the
apple tart ($2). Classically exe
cuted with puff pastry, custard
and apricot glaze, it is a model
of its kind.

The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well at Liaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make
an ideal starter. I recommend
Linguine con Vongole ($5.75),
or the Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the
bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.75), a refreshing cold
watercress ($1.50) is generous
in portion but too heavy on the
potato.
Entrees come with a choice
of soup or salad (the house oil
and vinegar dressing is a little
glutinous). Veal dishes here

are exemplary. Veal Piccata
with capers ($9.50) and Scalop
pini of Veal with fresh mus
hrooms ($8) are fork-tender.
The veal is white and milk fed
— you won't find better any
where. Medallions of Beef
Bearnaise ($10.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($25) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.
Italian
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El
Camino Real in Mountain
View, has a reputation as the
students' choice.
Pizzas are 12, 14 and 16 in
ches. Two specialty pizzas —
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" — presently cost
$5.50, $7.25 and $8.95.
Frankie's has the most

generous meat toppings of all
local restaurants. A healthy
dose of mushrooms counter
balances the meager helping of
green pepper. The fresh
tasting tomato sauce har
monizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for
the wide border around the
pizza, the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popu
lar item at Franlcie's, but there
are other Italian dishes which
are equally commendable. The
veal scallopini dinner ($6.50)
includes soup, salad, bread,
pasta, coffee and dessert.
Lasagne ($5.25) is the house
specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of
homemade minestrone ($1.25)
is hearty and aromatic. This
memorable starter contains
fresh carrots and zucchini,
cubes of ham and beef and

herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juici
ness.
Ramona's is just in
downtown Palo Alto and mere
minutes away by bicycle. One
of its best features is the salad
buffet, an amazing assortment
of fresh vegetables such as
cherry tomatoes and bell pep
pers, plus mozzarella cheese,
sprouts, mushrooms, beans
and four types of dressing. It's
$1.20 a bowl, but you may pile
it as high as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16 inches in diameter. A
one-item medium is $4.55; a
medium stromboli is $6.05.
Pizzas here are extremely fil
ling, a result of too much
cheese (if that is possible) and
an overly thick, chewy crust.
Toppings are not generously
portioned and if one likes to
mato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation

to the meat portions, the
stromboli is notable for its
greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods."
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Formico's pizzas come in
four sizes (10 to 16 inches).
Their specialty pizzas are the
same as those of Frankie's;
only the names are different.
"Vincent's Special," for exam
ple, is $4.50 for a 12-inch and
$5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excel
lent balance of cheese and to
mato sauce. The topping is
generously applied and
reaches close to the edge of
the pizza. Mushrooms, green
pepper and onions are espe
cially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brit

tie to sustain all items. A bit
more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
fuse's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique,
organic taste. Although it may
not make every skeptic a de
voted fan, it is certainly worth
trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarka
ble deep-dish sourdough
crust. It could be the best crust
in the area, and is recom
mended for pizzas with copi
ous topping. But be prepared
to wait longer for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($6.55
for 14 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, car
rots, peas, onions, tomato,
corn, green beans, mus
hrooms and the odd pineapple
speck. Huge and thick, it is a
veritable meal in itself.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant.

Mexican

Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in
Mountain View, has a stark
green and white interior. Nap
kins folded into hats rest on all
tables. Many of the restaur
ant's recipes are favorites of
the owner's mother and range
from $3 to $4. These include
Huevos Rancheros, chicken
and beef burritos and three

types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.25.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.45) is gener
ously served in a curled corn
tortilla with plenty of chips.
Two combination plates ($3.95)
that are good bets are the En
cinada (beef burrito, tostada,
enchilada and rice and refritos)
and the Cinaloa (tacos, en
chiladas and chile relleno).
Tucked away on cosmopoli
tan Castro Street in Mountain
View is a restaurant that has
gained popularity with many

students here. Poblanita Care is
totally unpretentious — it seats
30, the kitchen is exposed and
a Latin radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in
Spanish and lists five egg dis
hes. Huevos Rancheros at $2 is
the most popular. The fried
chicken is only $3 and Mexican
butterfried steak comes with
house salad, guacomole,
potatoes and dessert for only
$4. Menudo (beef tripe soup)
and Paella Valenchana ($1.75 —
the only non-Mexican item) are
weekend specialties.
All combination plates are
excellent ($2.60-$2.80) and in
clude a crisp house salad, a de
lectable Consome de Polio
(chicken broth, garnished with
freshly diced onion, tomato
and green chile peppers) and
noteworthy rice and refritos.
Don't pass up the burrito with
chicken chunks in green to
mato sauce or the chile re
llenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada
is a standout — succulent chic
ken pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount
of guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular
storefront restaurant in Moun
tain View with the most exten
sive Latin menu of the three re
staurants. The Mexican dishes
are excellent, but here the
specialties are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($4.50) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chiladas and the refritos are
not inspired, the Papusas (85
cents a la carte) are a true find.
These are homemade wheat
tortillas stuffed with cheese,

pork, beans (or a combination
of any two) and served with
pickled cabbage (curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes
range from beef tongue ($3.25)
to yucca root and pork salad
($2.50). Polla Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is
$4.50. The exceptional
homemade beef soup ($2.50)
with fresh zucchini, tomato,
cabbage and corn on the cob is
a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants, j
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reserva
tions on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday are a must.
Seafood
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant
and seafood market. Even
though you should expect to
pay more for seafood, The Fish
Market is expensive for what
you get because the portions
are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combina
tion ($6) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with
green pepper and onion — is
juicy and not overcooked.
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood
chairs and old fishing photos,
and its youthful, cheery staff
(which is extremely efficient).

El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached
or broiled salmon ($6.95),
Abalone Meuniere ($8.25),
Paella ($7.95) and even Frog
Legs Provencale ($8.25) show
the menu's extensiveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot
fish chowder; an excellent
romaine and spinach salad
with tomato cubes, croutons
and an herbed oil and vinegar
dressing; sourdough bread
and fresh whipped butter;
ravioli, stuffed with spinach, in
a tomato meat sauce; and
superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese
($7.95) is highly recom
mended. It has a fragrant garlic
aroma and a piquant Italian
tomato sauce simmered with
black olives, capers and spices.
