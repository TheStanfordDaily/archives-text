The capsule reviews which
follow have been distilled from
the most recent work of Harry
Killas, the Daily's resident re
staurant reviewer. Harry's taste
is wide, reliable and entirely
free of national prejudices. The
prices he quotes are approxi
mate and are only intended to
give an idea of the general
range in any particular restaur
ant.
Chinese
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it com

bines uncommonly good ser
vice with some of the best
Chinese cooking in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresis
tible tomato-cherry sauce with
scallions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen

and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no
longer cheap, Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan
style. Prices are lower than
Chef Chu's, but the portions
are smaller. One is advised to

order an extra bowl of rice.
Service is attentive.
Kung pao beef ($4.25-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a
challenge to eat — the prawns
are not shelled.
An excellent dish at the

China Lion, however, is the
pungent chicken. Juicy deep
fried chicken pieces arrive in a
slightly-sweet garlic sauce with
peppers. Other successful of
ferings here are the squid and
shredded pork and the tender
beef and mushroom in oyster
sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and
a civilized mood. The menu is
diverse and competently
served, and it includes both
standards such as sliced chic
ken and snow peas ($3.50), and

specialties like Hunan ham
($22), which must be ordered
in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and
sour is spicier, but not as sour
as Chef Chu's. The house spe
cial soup ($2.50) — sizzling rice
with chicken, ham, shrimp and
vegetables in a rich chicken
broth — is memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.75) are treated with re
spect. The scallops are not
tough from overcooking and
contrast well with the accom
panying water chestnuts. The
generals' chicken ($4.50), sub
tly spiced tender chicken in a
bed of crunch snow peas, is
excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively
generous, and the prices com
pare with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is

more distinct and hotter than
at the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and
a must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.95) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for
its plentiful serving, but also
for the chile peppers cooked in
it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.
French
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gance of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretension
of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows im
agination: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($9.50), L'escalopine
de Veau a la Bolognaise for two
(s2l), Chicken Cynthia ($8.50)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta, $6
— for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The
Liaison Salad a la Chantilly for
two ($6) with lettuce,
cucumber, olive, bacon, feta
cheese and herbs, and the
Medallions of Spring Lamb
($9.25) sauteed with fresh tara
gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
