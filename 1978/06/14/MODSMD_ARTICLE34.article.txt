Feeling in the mood for
gourmet French cuisine served
in a European dining atmos
phere without the hassle of a
weekend trip to Paris? Well,
one need not travel any farther
than downtown Palo Alto to
experience this extraordinary
restaurant: La Tour.
Although it's hidden away on
the third floor of the Palo Alto
Office Center, the month-old
La Tour is well worth seeking
out. As one steps off the
elevator, the elegance of the
chandeliers, wooden columns,
high ceilings and archways
immediately catches the eye,
while the dim lights and soft
music create a relaxing aura,
judging purely from its ap
pearance, my companion and I
anticipated that an evening at
La Tourwould bean eveningto
remember. The exceptional
cuisine and service that soon
followed proved our assump
tion to be correct.
Our four-course meal was
served in the leisurely French
fashion; we were allowed
plenty of time between each
course to relax and digest. The
waiter informed us that the
French sometimes take all
evening to eat their dinner,

and indeed, we did end up
spending almost three hours at
La Tour. Every minute of it was
enjoyable.
The service was also a note
able aspect of the restaurant.
Our attentive waiter con
cerned himself with our per
sonal comfort and enjoyment
of the meal. Between courses,
he often came over to our table
and chatted with us in French,
which added to the intimate
European ambience.
For those who care for
cocktails, there is a comfortable
sitting area available where
one can enjoy drinks ($1.50
each) before being seated at a
table. The restaurant offers full
bar service in addition to a
wine list of over 90 domestic
and imported selections.
From a choice of six hors
d'oeuvres, we decided on the
Coquille Saint Jacques ($3.50
each). The magnificent flavor
the chef created by mixing
tender scallops with a mus
hroom and cream sauce, along
with the clam shell in which it
was served, made this dish
truly unique.
La Tour features an extensive
list of entrees, all of which
sound delicious. One must
choose between lamb, beef,
chicken, duck or seafood, each
individually prepared in a spe
cial gourmet fashion. Believe

me, this is not a easy decision
to make.
I finally decided on the
Medaillon de Boeuf la Valliere
(fillet of tenderloin, $9.75)
while my companion chose the
chef's specialty for the night,
Loup en Croute (sea bass stuf
fed with lobster, $9.75). We
opted to have our entrees "au
diner" which includes a soup
or salad. However, one can
also have the entree "a la
carte" for $1 less.
The leafy green salad co
vered with a simple oil and vin
egar dressing was tasty and ap
portioned perfectly. Many re
staurants tend to ruin theircus
tomers' appetites with large
salads but La Tour was not
guilty of this.
The soup of the day was
Creme de Champignon. My

companion found this to be
different from other cream of
mushroom soups she had
tasted due to the flavor
enhancing spices it contained.
As we expected, the entrees
were superb. Also included
with my dish were "dauphine"
potatoes (mashed potatoes
that have been baked) and
french-cut green beans. How
ever, my attention was focused
on the two fillets of tenderloin
which were smothered in a
mushroom and truffle sauce. I
savored every bit.
My friend equally enjoyed
her entree, Loup en Croute.
The sea bass, stuffed full of
lobster, had been dipped in a
light batter, then baked until
crisp. There was a dish of cho
ron (bernaise and tomato)
sauce that one can spread on

the fish if desired. Unlike my
entree which was of just the
right portion, the sea bass was
very large and my companion
could finish only about three
fourths of it.
Although our full stomachs
instructed us otherwise, it was
impossible to pass up the
French desserts. My compan
ion had her favorite, Mousse
au Chocolat ($1.75), while I
branched out with the Souffle
Froid au Grand Marnier ($2.50).
This cold, egg-based dessert
topped with brandy, tasted as
good as it looked.
We ended our meal with the
after-dinner liqueur, Grand
Marnier, served in beautiful
violet-colored crystal goblets.
An excellent finale to an enjoy
able evening.
