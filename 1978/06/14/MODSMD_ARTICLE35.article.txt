# Presenting Maddalena's, here in our own Palo Alto

Maddalena's
544 Emerson Street
Palo Alto
326-6082
Roll over, haute cuisine of
San Francisco, Maddalena's is
here. Maddalena's is in the
same class with the best San
Francisco and Sausalito re
staurants and has the added
advantage of being located
right here in our own little Palo
Alto, so you can work up an
appetite in some place other
than your car.
The food, both French and
Italian, is excellent — so good,
in fact, and served in such a
highly choreographed man
ner, that you almost don't want
tp ruin their creation. The
prices are high, locit diminish in
relation to both the quality and
the up-state competition.
While the decor and ambiance
at Maddalena's are not quite as
impressive as Ondines or The
Carnelian Room, it does have

the coziness that a small but
devoted staff and patronage
bring.
We began our meal with a
Caesar Salad for two ($5.50).
Shortly after we placed our
order we noticed a man per
forming some curious rite in
the corner. We never guessed
that all the scraping, grinding,
tossing and lettuce-ripping was
inourhonor. Itwas actually the
owner and manager, Mr. Mad
dalena, personally preparing
our salad. The result soon ar
rived, topped with fresh
croutons and an unusually
light, lemon-flavored dressing.
Forentrees, we ordered Veal
Lemonata ($11.95) and Crab
Legs Eileene ($11.50). The first

dish consisted of several
breaded veal slabs of the most
tender cut. The crab legs,
which arrived without shells,
were served in a light but rich
cream sauce.
Pastas run $5 to $7 while the
other entrees are in the $8.50 to
$11.95 price range.
Finally, for those so inclined,
Maddalena's offers the ulti
mate in romantic settings and
discretion — an upstairs pri
vate dining room for two,
complete with paintings of re
clining nudes, lavish decor, a
bell to summon the waiter and
access from the back, rather
than the front, of the restaur
ant. Reservations requested.
