# Stanford Museum preserves family history

### 
The Leland Stanford Junior
Museum stands majestically at
the end of Museum Way.
Like any museum, it is full of
the paintings, sculpture and
pottery of the past — priceless
testimony of lost civilizations
or examples of more contem
porary artists.
But the Stanford museum
claims a unique legacy: an en
tire room devoted to the his
tory of the family who founded
the University.
Leland and Jane Lathrop
Stanford built the museum and
the University as memorials to
their son Leland Jr., who died
at 16.
The museum, built in stages
from 1894, was modeled after a
building in Athens. It was orig
inally much larger than it is
now, extending into what is
now the anatomy building. But
the 1906 earthquake destroyed
the back section; the remain
ing front section survived be
cause it was built of reinforced
concrete. Much of the pottery
and sculpture were destroyed.
Were it not for the quake,
the museum would have been
the largest private museum in
the world. Today, the Histori
cal Association of American
Public Works considers it one
of the most significant build
ings west of the Mississippi for
its structure and historical con
tent.
The Stanford room, and
other parts of the museum, de
tail much of the history of the
family, from its early business
ventures to little Leland's play
things.
Married in 1850, the couple
moved to Sacramento from the
upper Midwest, where Stan
ford purchased his brother's

store.
He later helped build, and
was president of, the Southern
Pacific Railroad. At first seen as
a risky financial venture, it later
proved to be a most lucrative
investment and helped to sup
port the University.
As a tribute to Stanford's
venture, the museum has a
safe displaying a gold and silver
spike, symbols of the joining of
the Central and Union Pacific
in Promontory, Utah, which
formed the first transcontinen
tal line. Stanford was present at
the ceremony.
Among Stanford's other in
terests was the fledgling art of
motion picture photography.
Stanford hired the services of
San Francisco photographer
Edward Muybridge to prove
that when a horse is in motion,
all its hoofs can be off the
ground at once.
Muybridge placed, under a
layer of dirt, a wire connected
to a camera; when the horse
ran over the wire, a photo
graph was taken. A series of
photographs was placed on a
disc, which when rotated,
looked like a horse in motion.
A sequence of photos, on dis
play in the Stanford room show
that Stanford was correct.
During the Civil War, Stan
ford kept California on the
Union side and organized the
Republican party for Lincoln.
He was governor of California
at the time; after that, in 1885,
he was elected Senator. His
blue Civil War uniform with
gold buttons and epaulets is
preserved under glass in the
room.
The Stanfords had been mar
ried 18 years before their only
child, Leland Jr., was born in

1868, in Sacramento. Mrs.
Stanford was 40 at the time of
his birth, and according to
museum docent Clenda
Northway, her son was her
"precious jewel."
At 16, Leland Jr. planned to
enter Harvard and learn how to
run museums — they were his
passion. But before he got to
Harvard in 1884, while with his
parents in Florence, in died of
typhoid fever.
When his son died, Stanford
sank into a coma from the
shock. Legend has it that in his
father's dreams, Leland Jr. ap
peared and said, "live for hu
manity." When he awoke,
Stanford thought, "California's
children shall be my children."
This led to the establishment of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity. Mrs. Stanford, as a memo
rial to her son and to carry out
his dream, built the Leland

Stanford Junior Museum.
Mrs. Stanford also took her
son's death very hard, and her
husband was happy she had a
project to keep her busy.
While the museum was being
built, museum docent and
chairman of the Stanford Fam
ily Portfolio Peg Haneberg re
lates, Jane drove the contrac
tors crazy making changes in
the design. The contractors
told Leland the design changes
would cost an addition $11,000.
He paid, believing that "if you
get the best first, it only hurts
once when you get the bill."
The Stanford room in the
museum is full of Leland Jr.'s
travel mementos and toys.
One can follow the course of
his maturation through the re
lics.
His bicycle, with remarkably
well-preserved rubber tires,
dominates much of the room.

Leland Jr.'s childhood toys
begin with wooden soldiers,
paint sets, games, wood carv
ings and drawings of ships he
did at age 10.
His early travel mementos
include 16th century German
knives and forks, a corner of a
stove from a sixth century
Bavarian castle, and a minia
ture Bank of America safe.
He later collected scrolls
from Constantinople, elabo
rately detailed Roman, Floren
tine and Venetian mosaics, ar
rowheads, jewelry and a
mummified hand and alligator.
The museum has recently
acquired a permanent collec
tion of Rodin sculptures, do
nated by B. Gerald Cantor, a
Beverly Hills inveslmenf
banker.

manity." When he awoke,
Stanford thought, "California's
children shall be my children."
This led to the establishment of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity. Mrs. Stanford, as a memo
rial to her son and to carry out
his dream, built the Leland

Stanford Junior Museum.
Mrs. Stanford also took her
son's death very hard, and her
husband was happy she had a
project to keep her busy.
While the museum was being
built, museum docent and
chairman of the Stanford Fam
ily Portfolio Peg Haneberg re
lates, Jane drove the contrac
tors crazy making changes in
the design. The contractors
told Leland the design changes
would cost an addition $11,000.
He paid, believing that "if you
get the best first, it only hurts
once when you get the bill."
The Stanford room in the
museum is full of Leland Jr.'s
travel mementos and toys.
One can follow the course of
his maturation through the re
lics.
His bicycle, with remarkably
well-preserved rubber tires,
dominates much of the room.

Leland Jr.'s childhood toys
begin with wooden soldiers,
paint sets, games, wood carv
ings and drawings of ships he
did at age 10.
His early travel mementos
include 16th century German
knives and forks, a corner of a
stove from a sixth century
Bavarian castle, and a minia
ture Bank of America safe.
He later collected scrolls
from Constantinople, elabo
rately detailed Roman, Floren

rowheads, jewelry and a
mummified hand and alligator.
The museum has recently
acquired a permanent collec
tion of Rodin sculptures, do
nated by B. Gerald Cantor, a
Beverly Hills inveslmenf
banker.

The Leland Stanford Junior
Museum stands majestically at
the end of Museum Way.
Like any museum, it is full of
the paintings, sculpture and
pottery of the past — priceless
testimony of lost civilizations
or examples of more contem
porary artists.
But the Stanford museum
claims a unique legacy: an en
tire room devoted to the his
tory of the family who founded
the University.
Leland and Jane Lathrop
Stanford built the museum and
the University as memorials to
their son Leland Jr., who died
at 16.
The museum, built in stages
from 1894, was modeled after a
building in Athens. It was orig
inally much larger than it is
now, extending into what is
now the anatomy building. But
the 1906 earthquake destroyed
the back section; the remain
ing front section survived be
cause it was built of reinforced
concrete. Much of the pottery
and sculpture were destroyed.
Were it not for the quake,
the museum would have been
the largest private museum in
the world. Today, the Histori
cal Association of American
Public Works considers it one
of the most significant build
ings west of the Mississippi for
its structure and historical con
tent.
The Stanford room, and
other parts of the museum, de
tail much of the history of the
family, from its early business
ventures to little Leland's play
things.
Married in 1850, the couple
moved to Sacramento from the
upper Midwest, where Stan
ford purchased his brother's

store.
He later helped build, and
was president of, the Southern
Pacific Railroad. At first seen as
a risky financial venture, it later
proved to be a most lucrative
investment and helped to sup
port the University.
As a tribute to Stanford's
venture, the museum has a
safe displaying a gold and silver
spike, symbols of the joining of
the Central and Union Pacific
in Promontory, Utah, which
formed the first transcontinen
tal line. Stanford was present at
the ceremony.
Among Stanford's other in
terests was the fledgling art of
motion picture photography.
Stanford hired the services of
San Francisco photographer
Edward Muybridge to prove
that when a horse is in motion,
all its hoofs can be off the
ground at once.
Muybridge placed, under a
layer of dirt, a wire connected
to a camera; when the horse
ran over the wire, a photo
graph was taken. A series of
photographs was placed on a
disc, which when rotated,
looked like a horse in motion.
A sequence of photos, on dis
play in the Stanford room show
that Stanford was correct.
During the Civil War, Stan
ford kept California on the
Union side and organized the
Republican party for Lincoln.
He was governor of California
at the time; after that, in 1885,
he was elected Senator. His
blue Civil War uniform with
gold buttons and epaulets is
preserved under glass in the
room.
The Stanfords had been mar
ried 18 years before their only
child, Leland Jr., was born in

1868, in Sacramento. Mrs.
Stanford was 40 at the time of
his birth, and according to
museum docent Clenda
Northway, her son was her
"precious jewel."
At 16, Leland Jr. planned to
enter Harvard and learn how to
run museums — they were his
passion. But before he got to
Harvard in 1884, while with his
parents in Florence, in died of
typhoid fever.
When his son died, Stanford
sank into a coma from the
shock. Legend has it that in his
father's dreams, Leland Jr. ap
peared and said, "live for hu
manity." When he awoke,
Stanford thought, "California's
children shall be my children."
This led to the establishment of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity. Mrs. Stanford, as a memo
