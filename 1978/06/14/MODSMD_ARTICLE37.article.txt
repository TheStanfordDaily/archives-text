(Editor's note: The Daily is
indebted to Mr. Lopez, prog
ram director at KZSU, for the
following article about the sta
tion to which we could not
have done justice to ourse
lves.)
Help Wanted: No Experi
ence needed. Will train. Great
returns guaranteed. Call 328-
2000.
This may sound like a comic
book or match book cover ad.
Well pilgrim, you're wrong.
This is the typical set of qualifi
cations that most beginners
have upon entering the cam
pus radio station, KZSU. The
great returns include United
Press International, all major
networks, and many other

radio and television stations.
Sound good, well here's the
straight dope, so to speak.
KZSU is the campus radio
station for Stanford University.
The station is 500 watts strong,
courtesy of a recent FCC deci
sion. Broadcast times are 24
hours a day, all year long. KZSU
has complete news, public af
fairs, music, sports and en
gineering departments that
supply plenty of opportunities
for anxious and interested
people.
Now you're probably think
ing, "What kind of chance do I
have since I am only going to
be here for a short period of
time?" Once again pilgrim,
you're on the wrong track.
Since KZSU is overwhelmingly
staffed by students during the
school year, there are plenty of
spots to fill during the summer.
If you feel like news or public
affairs, the world is atyour feet.
KZSU has an extreme need for
concerned people who want to
flex their journalistic muscle

on the entire Bay Area. Many of
our disc jockeys have landed
jobs at such stations as WNEW
(New York, KSAN (San Fran
cisco), KOME, KSjO (San Jose),
KCBS, KABC (Los Angeles), and
KPIX-TV (San Francisco).
So what do you say? Still
skeptical? Well here is the
answer to your question. The
types of activities that you will
perform at KZSU will be as var
ied as your own personal in
terests. The station is a profes
sional facility with exceptional
equipment to allow for the
most competent presentation
of news, music and public af
fairs.
If you feel like experiment
ing with radio or furthering
your present level of experi
ence try KZSU-FM. The Break
fast of Professionals. The first
meeting will be at KZSU
(basement of Mem. Aud. by
the Little Theatre) on Wednes
day, |une 28 at 7: H) p.m. For
more information call V2B
