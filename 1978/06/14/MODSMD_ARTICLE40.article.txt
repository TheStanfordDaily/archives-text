# Hoover Institution houses more than bells

### 
Everyone knows that once
you have become an alumnus,
the institution which
graduated you immediately
starts to solicit funds from you
and does not stop until you do.
Under this kind of constant
duress, everyone eventually
gives a little something. Some
even volunteer money —
perhaps as a tax dodge. Her
bert Hoover was a rare excep
tion.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas
— such as founding the Food
Research Institute and en
couraging the development of
a business school.
Probably his greatest con
tribution to Stanford was the
creation of one of the world's
most complete collections of
information on 20th century

wars and revolution.
The Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
major center for advanced
scholarship in political sci
ence, history, economics and
international law.
As student guides in the
tower point out to visitors, the
institution has the third largest
archives in the nation — the
largest private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000
volumes, including govern
ment documents, as well as
3000 archive units, which are
private collections of paper,
letters, memos, pamphlets,
diaries and other documents.
Subscriptions to newspapers
and periodicals have resulted
in more than 30,000 titles being
on file.
What all these numbers sig

nify to a scholar is the possibil
ity to thoroughly investigate a
subject — whether it be an in
tensive study of a particular
country, war, or revolution, or
a broad, comparative look at a
political or historical
phenomenon. The institution
has published 275 volumes
since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North
Korean Economy," "Truman,
the Jewish Vote, and the Crea
tion of Israel," "Yearbook on
International Communist Af
fairs: 1973 (seventh in a
series)" and "A Chinese-
English Dictionary of Com
munist Chinese Terminology."
As American Relief Ad
ministration Director in Europe
during World War I, Hoover
began his collection with the
help of Stanford professors
Ephraim Adams and Ralph
Lutz. He hoped that the mate
rials they gathered would pro
vide the data with which future
historians could work. Lutz be
came the institution's director
in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in vari
ous places on campus — many
in the main library. The library
was not really prepared to
store the masses of documents
the collecting team sent back at
the end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the found
ers set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start
the tower, which was dedi
cated in 1941.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives —
there are 17 levels of stacks —
as well as administrative and
research offices, two reading
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Bel
gium for the 1939-40 World's
Fair and were later donated to

Hoover by the Belgian Ameri
can Educational Foundation.
Hoover gave them to the in
stitution, which placed them
on top of the tower.
Electrical Engineering Pro
fessor James Angell plays the
carillon occasionally in the
evening during the summer.
'Angell's music'
As "Angell's music" de
scends from the heights above,
Hoover staffers are constantly
seeking new items for all their
collections. Although the in
stitution began as a vehicle to
study World War I, Hoover's
statement of purpose that it
"promote peace" throughout
the world led to its expansion
and constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encour
aged three areas of interest
which are still pursued today:
domestic problems, interna
tional studies and scholarship
fellowships.
The library is divided into re
gional and special collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the
British Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevsky Collection and the
New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest
solutions and uncover trends
in the world through its re
search and publications.
As well as employing a staff
of permanent researchers and
archivists, the institution
makes its holdings available to
Stanford students and faculty
and all other scholars. Many
authors and researchers come
from all over the world to use
the institution.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
areas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow

them to spend time "in unre
stricted and creative work."
The national fellowships are
given to approximately 10
people a year.
For one year they are free to
use the institution's resources.
They may discuss their projects
with any of the scholars con
nected with the institution.
Peace fellows
The projects of the three
peace fellows must investigate
"the phenomena of peace,"
the fellowship founders de
creed. Public affairs fellow
ships are designed to train
about three people a year to
work for legislators and na
tional administrators.
The staff and administration
of the institution cover a wide
spectrum. The director, W.
Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of
California board of regents.
The staff, which represents 20
different countries and 30 lan
guages, numbers 150.
The board of overseers of
the institution, which sets pol
icy and helps in the selection of
a director, consists of corpo
rate businessmen and notables
from all over the nation.
Donated money
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a compara
ble public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave $200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
Endowment and reserve
funds are now over
$12,000,000. Gifts to the institu
tion have risen to over
$2,000,000 a year. In 1971,
alumnus David Packard (co
founder of Hewlett-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered an independent body
within the University, not just
its stepchild in the backroom.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
the building, are open only to
the eyes of the librarians and
archivists. Even library patrons
are not free to browse — they
must request specific books,
then wait for the search crew to
bring them.
Visitors in the elevator may
get a glimpse of the director's
office, on the same floor where
Hoover himself once kept an
office. But the wealth of mate
rials in the archives hold a sec
ret no one can ever learn com
pletely.
