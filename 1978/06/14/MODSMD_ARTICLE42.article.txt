# Don't get caught in the library...
## Beat boredom with one of the area's clubs 
### 
Saturday night. It was a rough
week. Last night you were so
tired you went to bed early. To
night you're ready to do some
thing". You're not a nerd, so
you're not going to the library to
study. You're not the frat type,
so you're not going to the
"party" at Sigma Chi. You don't
like to bowl, so you're not going
to the lanes at Tresidder. You're
not going to sit and talk in the
room down the hall because
you've done that for the last
three Saturday nights. Well?
Why not check out one of the
Bay Area's outstanding Clubs?
Local talent and night spots
which feature it abound. Nor are
larger establishments featuring
larger names in short supply.
Not all of the better known clubs
listed below require I.Dand with
a little ingenuity, you could
probably get yourself into the
others if you are under 21 (but
don't tell anyone we told you).
Keystone Palo Alto. This club
brings a variety of acts and is the
only club in Palo Alto that has
"name" or otherwise recogniz
able talent. You'll find every
thing from disco to Jerry Garcia
to Stoneground. In general,
Keystone Palo Alto offers the
best club entertainment on the
Mid-peninsula. 260 California,
Palo Alto, 324-1402.
The Boarding House. You'll find
the Boarding House one of the
best clubs in the Bay Area. Up
and-coming, first-rate artists ap
pear at this rather high-profile
establishment. Such comedy
greats as Steve Martin, Martin
Mull, Henny Youngman, and
Robert Klein are part of its bill

on a regular basis. Musically,
there are such names as Patti
Smith, Jesse Winchester and
Ronee Blakley. Expensive deli
type food downstairs. 960 Bush,
San Francisco, 441-4333.
The Great American Music Hall.
The GAMH is one of the most
elegant clubs in the Bay Area.
Its format has a definite jazz
orientation, but not in a total
sense. Betty Carter, Count
Basie, Oregon, Billy Cobham,
Bill Evans, Jack Dejohnette and
Vassar Clements are but a few
of the personalities who fre
quent its stage. I.D. required.
859 O'Farrell, San Francisco,
885-0750.
The Old Waldorf. If metamor
phosis is possible, The Old Wal
dorf has achieved it. What once
used to be a small club with un
known acts has turned into one
of the hottest clubs around. In
the recent past, they have had
Tower of Power, Buddy Miles,
Andy Gibb, AC/DC, The Sons of
Champlin, and many others. The
club features great atmosphere,
but is a little hard to find. Try to
arrive early since parking is hard
to come by. 444 Battery, San
Francisco, 397-3884.
Keystone Korner. This is San
Francisco's "purest" jazz club.
Not a big or elegant place, it fea
tures big names like Rahsaan
Roland Kirk, Ahmad Jamal and
John Handy to name just a few.
Keystone Korner is one of the
centers of the Bay Area jazz
community. 750 Vallejo, San
Francisco, 781-0697.

Keystone Berkeley. For all prac
tical purposes, this is the club in
Berkeley. This also tends to be
the frequent stopping point of
many well-known aswell as local
artists. Earthquake, Greg Kihn,
Pablo Cruise and Elvin Bishop,
are just a few of the Keystone

types. This is a great place to see
good local talent and an occa
sional "biggie." I.D. Required.
2119 University, Berkeley, 841-
9903.
The establishments listed
above are just a few of the many
clubs in the Bay Area. Others

worth mentioning are the
Mabuhay Gardens, Slat's, The
Palm's, The Last Day Saloon and
the Other Cafe. All are in San
Francisco and feature only local
artists.
