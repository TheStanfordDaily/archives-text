### 
In general, San Francisco and
the Bay Area have an extremely
good reputation in the music in
dustry. Bands and artists of vary
ing size and fame often try to
include San Francisco on their
itinerary. A summary of what
you can expect from facilities
and promoters follows:
Facilities
Winterland. Acoustics are OK
to kind-of-bad, depending on to
whom you are talking. Expect
shows produced by Bill Graham

only, becausehe holds the lease.
Spectating possibilities include a
balcony with chairs and a large
standing area in front of the
stage. The groups who play
there are too numerous to name
and tend to be rock-oriented.
Capacity: about 4000. Corner ot
Post and Steiner, San Francisco.
Cow Palace. A general
purpose, large, basketball-type
auditorium. Only major acts
with a large draw play the Cow
Palace. Parking is a bit of a has
sle, as is traffic when leaving. Bill
Graham tends to use this place

more than other promoters.
Capacity: about 13,000. Geneva
and Santos, San Francisco (near
South San Francisco).
Oakland Coliseum/Stadium.
What can I say about a baseball
stadium? Location of Bill
Graham's Days on the Green.
Great on warm days. Capacity:
about 60,000. The Coliseum is
the basketball/hockey part of the
complex. It is much like the Cow
Palace, except nicer and newer.
Capacity: approximately 16,000.
FHegenberger Road and Flighway
17, Oakland.

Zellerbath Auditorium. Nice,
nice, very nice. An acoustically
superb auditorium. Tends to
have more mellow acts. Capac
ity: 3500. UC-Berkeley campus.
Greek Theatre. Pleasant setting
in thedesignof an ancient Greek
amphitheatre. Can be a bit un
comfortable on a very hot day.
The building stone sometimes
bounces the sound around.
Capacity: about 9000. UC-
Berkeley campus.
Paramount Theatre. An ex
tremely comfortable and enjoy
able place to hear good music in
the heart of Oakland. One of the
best. Capacity: approximately
3200. Broadway and West
Grand, Oakland.
Berkeley Community Theatre.
Another great one. Not as new
as Zellerbach, but newer than
the Paramount. Excellent acous
tics. Capacity: approximately
3500. Ashton and Grove, Ber
keley.
Concord Pavilion. An interest
ing combination of outdoor re
served and "festival" seating. I*
includes a covered section of
seats with a surrounding and
separated grass area. The sound
in the reserved seats is some
times made too loud so that the
"festival" seats can hear. Capac
ity: approximately 5000. 2000
Kirker Pass Road, Concord.
San |ose Civic Auditorium. A
basketball, boxing and wrestling
auditorium. Much like Winter
land acoustically with a similar
layout. Capacity: about 2750.
Market and West Carlos, San
Jose.

Center for the Performing Arts.
In my opinion, the best au
ditorium in the Bay Area. Less
than seven years old, with com
fortable seats. A real joy. Capac
ity: approximately 3000. Alma
den and Park, San Jose.
Leavey Center. A newish,
large-on-the-outside, small-on
the-inside basketball pavilion. If
you're not close to the stage, the
sound can have a tinny echo.
Capacity: about4soo. University
at Santa Clara campus, Santa
Clara.
Circle Star Theatre. The revolv
ing stage earns mixed reviews,
though the acoustics are good.
No rock — R&B, soul and jazz
predominate with an occasional
act aimed at the older crowd.
Capacity: approximately 2000.
1717 Industrial Road, San Carlos.
The Farm. Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and Memorial Au
ditorium are not bad places.
Frost Amphitheatre is by far the
best outdoor facility in the Bay
Area. Maples is tolerable as bas
ketball places go — the special
suspension floor gives any con
cert added bounce.
Promoters
One has to start with Bill
Graham. He is the grandfather
(or to his competitors, god
father) of the Bay Area music
scene. It has been fashionable to
knock Bill Graham as the "rob
ber baron" of the rock world,
but this is no longer true, if it
ever was. Graham shows are al
most always well-produced and
innovative.
Other promoters include Roy
Dußrow of Morning Sun Pro
ductions who tends to produce
mostly rock shows as well as an
occasional jazz concert, and
Freidman and Johnston (Linda
Freidman and Joy Johnston) who
are reputable promoters pro
ducing more mellow shows.
Student promoters include
CAL (Committee on Arts and
Lectures), SUPERB (both at UC
Berkeley). And last but
not least, we have our own Mark
Curtis at ASSU Special Events.

Oakland Coliseum/Stadium.
What can I say about a baseball
stadium? Location of Bill
Graham's Days on the Green.
Great on warm days. Capacity:
about 60,000. The Coliseum is
the basketball/hockey part of the
complex. It is much like the Cow
Palace, except nicer and newer.
Capacity: approximately 16,000.
FHegenberger Road and Flighway
17, Oakland.

Zellerbath Auditorium. Nice,
nice, very nice. An acoustically
superb auditorium. Tends to
have more mellow acts. Capac
ity: 3500. UC-Berkeley campus.
Greek Theatre. Pleasant setting
in thedesignof an ancient Greek
amphitheatre. Can be a bit un
comfortable on a very hot day.
The building stone sometimes
bounces the sound around.
Capacity: about 9000. UC-
Berkeley campus.
Paramount Theatre. An ex
tremely comfortable and enjoy
able place to hear good music in
the heart of Oakland. One of the
best. Capacity: approximately
3200. Broadway and West
Grand, Oakland.
Berkeley Community Theatre.
Another great one. Not as new
as Zellerbach, but newer than
the Paramount. Excellent acous
tics. Capacity: approximately
3500. Ashton and Grove, Ber
keley.
Concord Pavilion. An interest
ing combination of outdoor re
served and "festival" seating. I*
includes a covered section of
seats with a surrounding and
separated grass area. The sound
in the reserved seats is some
times made too loud so that the
"festival" seats can hear. Capac
ity: approximately 5000. 2000
Kirker Pass Road, Concord.
San |ose Civic Auditorium. A
basketball, boxing and wrestling
auditorium. Much like Winter
land acoustically with a similar
layout. Capacity: about 2750.
Market and West Carlos, San
Jose.

Center for the Performing Arts.
In my opinion, the best au
ditorium in the Bay Area. Less
than seven years old, with com
fortable seats. A real joy. Capac
ity: approximately 3000. Alma
den and Park, San Jose.
Leavey Center. A newish,
large-on-the-outside, small-on
the-inside basketball pavilion. If
you're not close to the stage, the
sound can have a tinny echo.
Capacity: about4soo. University
at Santa Clara campus, Santa
Clara.
Circle Star Theatre. The revolv
ing stage earns mixed reviews,
though the acoustics are good.
No rock — R&B, soul and jazz
predominate with an occasional
act aimed at the older crowd.
Capacity: approximately 2000.
1717 Industrial Road, San Carlos.
The Farm. Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and Memorial Au
ditorium are not bad places.
Frost Amphitheatre is by far the
best outdoor facility in the Bay
Area. Maples is tolerable as bas
ketball places go — the special
suspension floor gives any con
cert added bounce.
Promoters
One has to start with Bill
Graham. He is the grandfather
(or to his competitors, god
father) of the Bay Area music
scene. It has been fashionable to
knock Bill Graham as the "rob
ber baron" of the rock world,
but this is no longer true, if it
ever was. Graham shows are al
most always well-produced and
innovative.
Other promoters include Roy
Dußrow of Morning Sun Pro
ductions who tends to produce
mostly rock shows as well as an
occasional jazz concert, and
Freidman and Johnston (Linda
Freidman and Joy Johnston) who
are reputable promoters pro
ducing more mellow shows.
Student promoters include
CAL (Committee on Arts and
Lectures), SUPERB (both at UC
Berkeley). And last but
not least, we have our own Mark
Curtis at ASSU Special Events.

In general, San Francisco and
the Bay Area have an extremely
good reputation in the music in
dustry. Bands and artists of vary
ing size and fame often try to
include San Francisco on their
itinerary. A summary of what
you can expect from facilities
and promoters follows:
Facilities
Winterland. Acoustics are OK
to kind-of-bad, depending on to
whom you are talking. Expect
shows produced by Bill Graham

only, becausehe holds the lease.
Spectating possibilities include a
balcony with chairs and a large
standing area in front of the
stage. The groups who play
there are too numerous to name
and tend to be rock-oriented.
Capacity: about 4000. Corner ot
Post and Steiner, San Francisco.
Cow Palace. A general
purpose, large, basketball-type
auditorium. Only major acts
with a large draw play the Cow
Palace. Parking is a bit of a has
sle, as is traffic when leaving. Bill
Graham tends to use this place

more than other promoters.
Capacity: about 13,000. Geneva
and Santos, San Francisco (near
South San Francisco).
