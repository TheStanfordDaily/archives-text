# The
						changing San Francisco Bay

### 
In the fourth act of Goethe's "Faust Part Two," the
hero tells the devil Mephistopheles that he has been
contemplating the seashore and has been struck with
an inspiration:
Thus plan on plan came thronging to my mind-
Win for yourself, O Faust, this precious pleasure:
Lock out the lordly sea from shore and measure
A narrower measure for his briny plain,
Drive him far back into his own domain.
Faust's motivation, Mephistopheles learns, is of
the noblest sort:
It steals along, in countless channels flowing,
Fruitless itself and fruitlessness bestowing;
It swells and grows and rolls and spreads its reign
Over the loathsome desolate domain.
There wave on wave holds tyrant sway unfettered
And then draws back and nothing has been bettered;
And I could thus grow desperate to behold
This aimless power of elements uncontrolled
But here my spirit dared a flight unknown:
Here I could war and warring, win my throne.
To the Europeans who first explored and later set
tled the San Francisco Peninsula, the Bay must have
seemed no less a "fruitless, desolate, loathsome do
main." The surrounding land may have been fertile,
but the expanse of water seemed from the first an
obstacle to progress.
Immense arm
When the Portola-Serra expedition of 1869 disco
vered the Bay, one member noted in his diary that
"The expedition strove to reach Point Reyes, but was
hindered by an immense arm of the sea, which, ex
tending to a great distance inland, compelled them to
make an enormous circuit for that purpose. In con
sequence of this and other difficulties, the greatest of
all being the absolute want of food, the expedition
was compelled to turn back."
At the time of the gold rush, in the 1850 sand after,
so little esteemed was the Bay that submerged lots
were sold by the municipalities of San Francisco and
other cities with the understanding that the purchas
ers would fill in their property and make it "useful."
This practice continued until the early part of this
century, at which time the state legislature was obli

gated to step in and settle the complex inter
municipal disputes which were flaring around the
usage of the Bay. This resulted only in a juggling of
roles, however, instead of disposing of water rights,
the cities could only acquire them on the condition
that "improvements" be made within 10 years.
It was not until the last decade that the Bay Area's
citizens started to acquire an appreciation for the
blue expanse. In 1962 the city of Berkeley, following
the lead of a dozen other Bayside communities, for
mulated a plan which would double its land area by
filling in 4000 acres of wetlands. Compared to other
proposals circulating at the time, this was quite a
modest sum. San Mateo County, for example, en
couraged by an impromptu consortium of foothill
developers who were selling the earth removed from
their excavations and truckers who were buying and
reselling it at a profit as Bay fill, had decided to push
its shoreline two to three miles further out into the
water.
The Berkeley scheme, however, galvanized a small
but determined group of conservationists into ac
tion. Several faculty wives from the University of
California, together with a handful of Bay Area con
servationists, formed an activist group which they
named the Save San Francisco Bay Association.
After months of unrelenting effort during which
the group's members consulted engineers,
economists, sociologists and city planners about the
necessity of the fill, they presented their case to the
Berkeley City Council. When the filling plans were
withdrawn, the Save the Bay Movement spread to
other communities.
Two years after the movement's inception, the
issue became one of such political potency that a bill
was passed by the state legislature establishing the
San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
Commission and calling for a detailed study of the
issue. The Commission was directed to examine "All
the characteristics of the Bay, including . . . the
ecological balance of the Bay, the economic interests
in the Bay, including the needs of the Bay Area popu
lation for industry and employment."
The study was started in 1965 and completed in

1969. Duringthecourseof these five years, reports on
25 different aspects of the Bay were prepared, many
of which contained startling information which had
not been appreciated outside of specialized circles.
In a report entitled "Smog and Weather," for
example, it was stated that "the waters of the Bay play
a significant part in helping to determine the climate
in the region: they serve as a 'heat reservoir,' mod
erating the extremes of temperature; they make pos
sible the smooth flow of cooling winds from the
ocean; and their existence helps prevent smog."
If as little as 25 per cent of the Bay were filled, the
report said, a significant increase in summertime
temperatures and a decrease in both winter tempera
tures and rainfall around the Bay would result.
The intuitively obvious conclusion that the Bay is a
complex ecosystem was born out by the half dozen
reports dealing with tidal movement, sedimentation,
pollution, fish and wildlife, marshes and mudflats,
and salt, sand, and shells.
While the study was being conducted, the Com
mission had been empowered to regulate local fill of
the Bay. Even before all the evidence was in, the
commission believed strongly enough that Bay fill
was deleterious that it permitted only 359 acres to be
filled in four years, a fraction of the amount which
previously had been filled annually.
"It requires little imagination to picture the Bay
region without the Bay," wrote Harold Gilliam in 1969
in his chronicle of the Bay's preservation, "Between
the Devil and the Deep Blue Bay." "It is only neces
sary to look at many another U.S. city, surrounded by
mile after mile of tract houses, asphalt-encircled
shopping centers, factories and freeways â€” endless
stretches of slurbs, choked by traffic, begrimed by
smog.
"However, it requires considerable imagination,
and a great deal of ingenuity, to picture this region if
its greatest natural resource were preserved and de
veloped to its fullest potential. This kind of vision of
what the Bay might become has been set forth by the
Bay Conservation and Development Commission in
the comprehensive plan it developed for the Bay and
its shores."
