# Union Street shops cater to all tastes
## 
### 
Between the shrimp cocktail of the
wharves and tourist cocktail of
Chinatown lies Union Street, a mixture
of what San Francisco is famous for —
things peculiar and edible.
The order of the day is shopping for
items varying from Finnish cheese to
antique pipes and the order of the night
is shopping for a partner and/or a good
time (often the same thing) in places
ranging from a quiet corner of a re
staurant to a dance floor of a disco, or
even one of numerous, narrow back
alleys, if that's your whim.
The central, busiest section of Union
Street stretches about five blocks, from
Laguna to Pierce. It is a combination of
many-colored doors, unusual spots to
eat, parallel parking, and people who
are dressed well and know it. Every
thing is packed close together, even
more so than in the rest of the City,
making slow feet and sharp eyes neces
sary for catching all the sights.
Eat
The first thing is to eat, either brunch
or lunch, in order to be able to walk it
off during the afternoon. Park Place,
one of the newer restaurants, serves an
excellent brunch on the weekends.
Choices include various poached eggs
and omelettes, salmon, chile rellenos,
and even a ground beef casserole cal
led "Joe's Special," which is sup
posedly cooked better than when Joe
invented it at another restaurant a few
years back. The tone in Park Place is set
by caneback chairs, redwood beams,
overhead ferns and a clear, glass roof.
The waiters are young and friendly, and
one of them is an almost exact likeness
of Giancarlo Ciannini. Prices for
brunch are $2.75 to $3.95, and the serv
ings are generous. Don't hesitate to go
for dinner, too. The chef was stolen
from Portland, and seafood is his spe
cialty.
A bit down the block is Thomas
Lord's, with a pub setting and pretzels
at every table. There are pictures of
cricket matches on the walls, and a type

of food named Wimbledon Fries, which
does not, incidentally, mean potatoes
in the shape of tennis rackets. A firep
lace and television by the bar complete
the decor. On the menu are crepes,
quiche, crab, burgers, and eggs, cost
ing about $2.95 to $4.95. Most of the
patrons are in their 30s and 40s, though
younger patrons are quite welcome.
Wear a heavy, wool sweater if you really
want to fit in.
Cup cantata
Another spot is Coffee Cantata which
boasts exhibits of local artists and a
patio facing the street, so you can watch
the walkers watch you eat. Cups and
plates seem to clatter continually, as if
to keep reminding you that you're in a
restaurant.
There's also the Bohemian Gardens,
which no doubt looks something like
Bohemia even though the food seems a
bit American. Colorful murals of the
French Riviera cover the walls. In back
is a protected outside cafe where you
can eat cordonbleu and stuffed cab
bage, or more average delights such as
corned beef and roast beef.
Two other small and interesting
places are Delancey Street, run solely
by ex-cons, and Bogart's Shellfish Bar,
which specializes in guess what.
After eating, it's time to take to the
streets. The choice of shops in which to
browse is nearly burdensome. A good
deal of fun and a greater deal of money
can be spent in the antique stores. Un
doubtedly, many of the antiques are
good investments, and who has not
dreamt of owning a 1928 gramophone
to blast out the neighbors? One of the
stores even carries antique clothing,
assuredly sewn by antique seamstres
ses. If you want that grandparent look,
this is the spot for you. In any case,
romping through the goods of days
past for an hour or two is entertaining
and even educational.
The new
Union Street is also filled with mod
ern trinket shops which carry every sort

of gumball machine known to man, im
aginative cards to send for mother's or
father's or grand aunt's day, and
numerous games, including a new ver
sion of Monopoly, with San Francisco
as the scene instead of plain old Atlantic
City. These trinket shops, and the an
tique stores, are often owned and run
by one person. Apparently it's custom
ary for these people to be interesting
and able to tell good stories, so staying
a while and talking to them can be quite
enjoyable.
A great number of additional odds
and ends are scattered along the street.
Several bars, such as the Bus Stop and
Tarr and Feathers, not as busy in the
afternoon as at night when they fill
completely, are good places to have a
few drinks in the afternoon, relax and
talk.
In the alleys lie various merchants
in-waiting, like the Flower Boutique,
complete with birdsongs, and a well
stocked poster store. If your tastes run
to the more exotic, there's a pet shop
displaying some of the "weirdest
looking birds," as one passerby de
scribed them. You can also find a
sheepskin shop, and an art gallery,
showing, with other exhibits, food art
(to prepare you for dinner).
Safari
If you like old buildings, explore the
Sherman School on a weekday. And for
the internationally-minded, there's a
Safari travel agent a short distance
down the block.
Finally, sometime during the after
noon, you need to visit the Garden
Cheese Company. To reach the shop,
you stroll down an alley built for one
way traffic, and as you proceed, the
smell of cheese becomes more and
more gouda until you finally arrive in a
frenzy of tasty anticipation.
A man named Nicholas van Beek,
who seems to have just popped out of
the French countryside, runs Garden
Cheese, called such because of a small,
spotless garden next door, where, as

van Beek says, "an old man rakes it with
a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Finland, Greece and even
the old staple, France, line the shelves
of the store, as well as wine and an
assortment of gourmet foods.
Night
At night, especially on weekends,
Union Street does its own imitation of
Mr. Hyde. In place of the calm, shop
ping and strolling crowd comes a mass
of people in their 20s and early 30s to
infiltrate the bars and restaurants. And
as one man declared, "these places get
to be body shops late at night. People
are on the take, and no one's trying to
hide it."
The best example, with some of the
best of everything is Perry's. Prices go
from $4.75 to $8.50, and the meal is
worth every bite of the money. It is de
finitely some of the finest eating around
— London broil, skewered lamb, chic
ken —all good and plentiful. The salads
are large and green, and the drinks are
as strong as you'd fix them for yourself,
unless your name is W.C. and you hate
babies. The service is fine, and you're
given time to eat each course and relax
before the next.
But "most of the people don't just
come in here for dinner," one waiter
stated. "This is self-made entertain
ment. It's a people show." At the bar
and all around the front area of Perry's,
men and women stand and converse
and watch who's walking by. It's one of
the best places to meet someone easily
and quickly, so if that's what you desire,
eat and drink out front. If you want a
quiet dinner with someone you already
know, ask for a table in the back. Either
way, you've got a good deal.
Antebellum atmosphere
Of course, a good number of other
restaurants stand patiently along the
street. La Creole, with table settings
and authentic New Orleans food, gives
the feeling of eating at the home of an
antebellum Southern aristrocrat.
