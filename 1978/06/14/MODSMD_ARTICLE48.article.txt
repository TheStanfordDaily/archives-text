# The
						Bay Area has something for all
## 
### 
There is a lot to be said for
San Francisco, but no speech
on the sights of the Bay Area
should stop there. The last
word has not been spoken
until the names of such
localities as Sausalito and Tibu
ron, Mount Tamalpais and
Point Reyes, Berkeley and
Santa Cruz have been men
tioned.
Water is the most significant
geographical feature of the Bay
Area. It plays a crucial role in
determining the character of
San Francisco and environs. Its
efficacy as a physical barrier
can be judged by comparing
San Francisco and Marin coun
ties : separated by the relatively
modest 1000 yard expanse of
the Golden Gate, the City
packs 14,000 people in every
square mile, while Marin ap
pears to consist of row upon
row of apparently lifeless hills.
But Marin is by no means
without attractions. The oppu
lent homes of Sausalito and
Tiburon, for example, are a
spectacle. (The per capita in
come of the latter community
is in the top 10 of the country.)
Prison
Just to the north of Tiburon's
carefully groomed peninsula
the monolithic walls of San
Quentin State Penitentiary can
be seen. It isn't so convenient
to the City, perhaps, but the
guard towers command a fine
view of the Bay.
To gain access to Marin's
Pacific coastline, it is necessary
to take one of the climbing,
winding roads out of Mill Val
ley. After ascending the steep
slopes of Mount Tamalpais
(pronounced t m-al-PIE-as),
these routes eventually join
Highway 1, the coast road.
Separated from Marin only
by the five mile expanse of the
Bay, the group of cities collec
tively known as the East Bay
seem to be a world apart. The
mood of the area, set in large
part of Oakland, is more
business-like than that of San
Francisco, and, perhaps be
cause of the chronic fog, every
thing seems grayer.
Berkeley is a notable excep
tion, however. The city itself
reminds some people of the
well-known college towns of
the East Coast such as Cam
bridge and New Haven.
The University of California
campus in Berkeley has attrac

tions of its own. Vestiges of the
air of protest arid radicalism,
of long hair and drugs still sur
vive in the outdoor life of street
vendors and performers at the
student center. Behind the
academicand residential build
ings, the natural beauty of the
foothills is preserved in Tilden
and Wildcat Regional Parks.
Napa Valley
About an hour's drive to the
northwest from San Francisco
is California's premium wine
country, the Napa Valley. The
terrain itself is not dramatic,
composed chiefly of dry,
gently, rolling hills, and the
town of Napa has never in
spired lyric descriptions. The
wine, however, speaks for it
self and has no need to
apologize to anyone. The most
difficult part of a tasting tour is
the drive home afterwards.
Other bays
San Francisco's may be the
biggest, but it is not the only
bay in the Bay Area. Two bays
to the south have given rise to
several seaside towns of pic
turesque character.
Half Moon Bay, located on
the coastal indentation of the
same name, is most noted for
its seafood restaurants and
busy harbor.
Santa Cruz is stationed at the
northern limit of Monterey Bay.
Considered at one time a re
tirement community, the
summer resort was trans
formed by the establishment of
a University of California cam
pus there in 1960. Santa Cruz is
best known for its (relatively)
warm-water beaches and its
roller coaster.
Monterey, at the southern
end of Monterey Bay, has a his
tory as long and colorful as San
Francisco. Today it is some
what self-conscious; its Can
nery Row, immortalized by
John Steinbeck, has been
taken over by expensive
boutiques and tourist-oriented
restaurants.
Carmel, on the other hand,
has been able to retain, largely
by virtue of its singular wealth,
an authentic older-California
atmosphere. Faced with an
ever increasing influx of
tourists, the village is currently
resisting the impulse to com
mercialize itself. It is located
on its own, much smaller bay,
which it shares with the noted
Pebble Beach Golf Course.
