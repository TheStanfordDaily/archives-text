# The 						lonely rock they call Alcatraz...
## 
### 
"This is just 12 acres of 34,000
that we control, although I guess
this is the most famous part,"
said Bill Whalen, a Golden Gate
National Recreation Area offi
cial, nodding toward the tiny
finger of rock across the Bay.
Alcatraz Island lay quietly in
the water, whipped by a chilly
wind, pummeled by the Pacific
Ocean's blue waves. The one
time home of Al Capone was
greeting visitors who had no in
tention of staying more than a
few hours.
Alcatraz, once the object of
more fear and hate than any
place else in America, opened to
the public in 1973 for the first
time since Mexico ceded the is
land in 1848.
From 1934, when federal
prison administrators made the
island a home for America's in
corrigibles, until 1963, when of
ficials declared it obsolete, few
citizens could honestly claim
neutral feelings for "The Rock."
For millions of Americans, Al
catraz represented protection, a
fortress where the government
held unmitigated evil at bay. For
others, Alcatraz was a monu
ment to barbarous cruelty, a
continuing reminder of Ameri
ca's failures. To the handful of
men who actually served time
there, it was at once a living hell,
a worse existence than they
could ever have imagined, and
paradoxically, a coveted mark of
high status in the underworld.
Psychological myth
"Alcatraz was founded on a
psychological myth," Whalen
said. "It was a place that would
make the public feel safe from
the big criminals of the 19305,
that would make the public feel
'we've really taken care of those
guys.'
"At the same time, there was a
lot of trouble in existing prisons,
a lot of riots and violence, and
this was something the prison
people could use as a discipli
nary measure.
"They really built up the image
of Alcatraz ... no one was ever
taken to other prisons for re
lease, because the prison
people wanted to build up the
i mage that you never get off 'The
Rock.'
"Even today, the Bureau of
Prisons is reluctant to talk about
it to us," he said.

A little over a mile from
Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz still
has an air of ominous entice
ment that the years of isolation
have not dimmed.
A large sign warns: KEEP OFF
— US Gov't Property. The water
tower, looming high above the
island, bears a different mes
sage: "Home of the Free Indian
— Welcome," a remnant of the
lengthy occupation of the island
by militant Indians at the start of
this decade. The automated
lighthouse watches over the
empty settlement, warning away
unwary boats.
Alcatraz has been dead 14
years now, and it shows. Shat
tered windows in the old yellow
administration building give it a
blind, hollow look; rusted bars
reek of decay.
"See if you can feel the at
mosphere; try to imagine you're
a prisoner here," guide Jerry
Rombourg advised visitors. Even
the most skeptical felt a small
chill as the ferry pulled away
from the island and headed back
to Fisherman's Wharf.
Military installation
Alcatraz began as a military in
stallation. The island is solid
rock, with structures built on
two levels. The lower area was
constructed by the military, with
the idea of keeping the enemy
out. A great deal of the upper
level was built or altered by the
prison authorities to keep
another sort of enemy in.
The two areas are connected
by an intricate series of stairways
and catwalks, rusted and sprout
ing weeds in many cases. A
winding road, carved out of
solid stone, winds its way up the
jagged hill. It, like everything
else on the island, has been par
tially eaten up by the greenery.
"All the island's piping and
wiring is contained in a tunnel
underneath this road," Rom
bourg told visitors as they
trudged up the hill. "They built it
into the road because it was the
only way to protect it from the
wind and the sea." The tunnel
caused a number of problems,
though.
"Every time there was an es
cape, or an escape attempt, the
prison authorities had to crawl
through all the tunnels to see if
the prisoners were hiding in
there. And once or twice a week

they had to go through it to see if
the prisoners were hiding any
contraband," Rombourg said.
Even the old warden's office,
in the corner of the sickly pink
main building, has been invaded
by the wildly-proliferating vege
tation.
When Alcatraz was young,
there were about 40 terraced
gardens on the island, tended by
inmates who got outside the
cellblock for good behavior. The
island's vegetary anarchy today
stems from the old gardens.
Command post
Little remains in the warden's
office to indicate that it was once
the command post of a
maximum security system cover
ing an area of 12 acres. An old
desk rots quietly in one corner,
on the wall is a rusted brown
spot, once a control panel that lit
up if trouble flared anywhere on
the island.
"The warden had some pretty
tough ideas about security,"
Rombourg recounted. "He
would send guards out to the
rifle range, and tell them to prac

tice during the morning as the
prisoners marched by on their
way to work. He thought that
reinforced the idea that if they
wanted to leave, they would
have some problems.
"He also had the guard put
dummies outside and use them
for target practice while the
prisoners ate. They (prisoners)
could hear the shooting . . .
then, after their meal, they
would go outside and see a
bunch of dummies shot full of
holes. I suppose it was pretty
effective," he continued.
Past the warden's office is the
old visitor's area — a dark,
parched, peeling room, still
heavy with the stench of loneli
ness. In this dimly-lit room wives
and children sat, waiting to catch
a glimpse of husbands and
fathers — through a one-foot
square window with inch-thick
glass.
They spoke only through tele
phones.
On the other side of the win
dow was the heart and soul of
Alcatraz — if it had such a thing

— the three cell blocks. Here the
Al Capones and Robert Strouds
lived out desperate year after
desperate year, watching the
San Francisco skyline just a mile
away.
Here they stayed, in a pain
fully small nine by five foot cell,
with a folding cot, stool, sink,
toilet, light bulb, and folding
bench and table. And their time.
'Silent days'
"From 1934 to 1944 were
what's known as 'the silent
days,' " Rombourg intoned as
visitors moved among the cells.
"The prisoners were not allowed
to talk to each other. They got a
three-minute break on
weekends. Everyone got to be
pretty proficient in arm lan
guage, shoulder language, sign
language, any kind but spoken."
"Reading material was non
existent. In the prison library
there were hardly any books to
read . . . mail did not exist. An
inmate could have one visit a
month," Rombourg added. He
told visitors to go into the cells:
"But don't shut the doors.
We've already had a couple
people locked in."
The tiny cells produce now —
as they must have produced
then — a feeling of quiet, desol

ate hopelessness. Visitors
walked inside, gazing in wonder
at the bleak walls, and conversa
tion died out. In one section of
"Broadway" — the main cell
block — they examined the
pockmarked floor where prison
guards dropped concussion
grenades to break up a riot in
1946.
Others wandered back and
looked at the narrow utility tun
nel running between the cell
blocks. In 1946, Alcatraz inmates
won a major concession: twice a
week, guards would turn on a
small radio at the end of the tun
nel. By kneeling beside a small

air vent under the sink in each
cell, the prisoner could hear the
radio echo through the tunnel.
The utility tunnel has served
other purposes from time to
time. In 1962, three inmates
painstakingly tunneled out the
back of their cells into the tunnel
and climbed out the cell block
skylight. They were never seen
again.
Like the other three men who
escaped from"The Rock,"
they're presumed dead. Anyone
who could get away, psychiat
rists say, would surely have
bragged about it by now.
Past the main cell block is the
isolation and segregation block

— or solitary, if you prefer. Dis
ciplinary cases could spend up
to 19 days at a time in solitary,
where the prison served them
only two meals a week. The rest
of the time they got bread and
water.
If that wasn't enough, they
went to "the hole" — a cell with
nothing but a blanket in it. If an
inmate was too noisy in the hole,
an outer door could be closed,
cutting off all light and most
sound from the outside.
Here, in the solitary block,
Robert Stroud — the Birdman of
Alcatraz — spent his time in cell
41. Stroud, sentenced to death,
won a commutation of sen
tence, to life in solitary con
finement. "That was a rather un
usual sentence," Rombourg
noted.
Outside the isolation block is
the main yard, where inmates
got a few minutes to exercise
each week. The yard had space
for basketball, handball, and
shuffleboard.
But most inmates spent their
time huddling against the sharp
Bay wind, gazing out across the
water at the San Francisco docks
and counting seagulls — which
were after all, alive and free. By
standing on the top step at the
side of the yard they could see
the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge,
a bit of fog shrouded San Fran
cisco skyline — and the ever
present guard tower.
Now the yard, like every thing
else on Alcatraz, is dead. Grass
has completely taken over the
basketball court, obscuring the
faded yellow markings which
once passed as boundaries.
Apartments
The tour headed back toward
the dock, where the ferry
waited. Rombourg pointed out
the remnants of the apartment
buildings where a third of Alcat
raz' guards lived with their
families when the prison was in
operation.
The Indians used them during
the occupation, and when fed
eral authorities ejected the
militants, they decided the
buildings were a health hazard
and bulldozed them on the spot.
All that remains of them now
are three huge mounds of life
less concrete beside the shat
tered corpse of a guard tower,
symbolic of Alcatraz itself — an

island which died of old age. The
era which spawned Alcatraz is
dead too; the only surprise is
that the island managed to live
on for so long afterward.
The only life now on "the
Rock" is the vegetation that
peeks out everywhere — but
that, too, is doomed. Alcatraz
really is solid rock; when the
military took over the island, it
dynamited huge holds in the
ground and filled them with dirt.
Now the soil is eroding away,
and soon only rock will remain.
Alcatraz will simply be a lifeless

hump in the Bay, a bare deserted
place of despair and crumbled
hope The lighthouse will stay, a
marker for the world's largest
grave.
If the touring group did not
feel a change when they stepped
onto the island, they certainly
felt one as they left. Voices rose,
laughter returned, and everyone
eagerly watched the approach of
the San Francisco docks. Almost
no one turned to look at the
lighthouse, winking through the
afternoon fog.
