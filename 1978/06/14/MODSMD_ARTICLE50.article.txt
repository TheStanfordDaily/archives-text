# Local vintners offer wine tasting tours

"Wine is constant proof that
Cod loves to see us happy."
That witticism by Benjamin
Franklin hangs in the tasting
room of the Brookside Winery,
on El Camino Real in Mountain
View. The Brookside and other
local wineries are proof that
one doesn't have to drive two
hours to Napa Valley to visit
good wineries.
Brookside is a quiet, low
pressure winery; visitors are
under no pressure to buy, but
are encouraged to browse,
taste and ask questions.
Visitors may taste virtually
anything they want, except for
the brandies, and manager
Claude Anisodon's friendli
ness and thorough knowledge
make Brookside a worthwhile
trip.
Something for everyone
Brookside features over 100
varieties of wine, which it sells
through its own outlets, re
staurants or to churches for
altar wines. This keeps the
prices down and the prices are
extremely reasonable. The var
iety also means that there is
something for everyone; as
wine-tasting host Michael Mil
ler says, "We make wine for
everybody. No matter what
types you're looking for, here
you can find it."
And Brookside will buy back
for 10 cents its old half-gallon
and gallon bottles for recycling
— a feature unique to that win
ery.
Brookside's estate wines are
among its best. These are orig
inal to Brookside, and one, cal
led "Guasti Chocolate," has
won a gold medal at the Los
Angeles Fair.
The Paul Masson Winery in
Saratoga offers a totally diffe
rent experience from Brook
side. Its operations are much
bigger and cater to tourists,
and hence, are much more
commercial.
While the tour is excellent,
Mason's tasting room is not. In
spite of the many varieties of
wines, only a few are available
for tasting on any given day —
it depends on what type the

winery opens that day.
A little-known but wonder
fully quaint winery lies in the
Los Catos hills. Called the
Novitiate, it was founded in
1888 by ]esuit priests, who still
do much of the work.
The Novitiate is strictly a
non-profit enterprise, supply
ing altar wines for Catholic
churches in the U.S. and sup
porting retirement homes for
old priests.
The priests run a very small,
personal operation; their vol
ume is about 135,000 gallons a
year and they only make about
20 types of wine. But visitors
can taste as much as they like of
anything they like — with free
breadsticks to make a light
meal.
And unlike the completely
modern equipment at Paul
Masson, the Novitiate has a
sma/l, classic wine cellar with
old barrels in racks. One of
their larger barrels was re
cently sold to a man who built a
house from it.
Specialty fruit wines
Bargetto's winery, in Soquel,
offers a mixture of the Italian
family touch large factory op
erations. Tours are informal —
just ask.
The tasting room is worth the
hour's drive. Senior wine
counselor Pat Ballard handles
the always-busy room with re
markable dexterity; every cus
tomer is given a completely or
ganized "tour" through wines,
from "vin ordinaire" to fruit
and dessert wine. Visitors can
taste anything but the most ex
pensive wines.
Fruit wines are Bargetto's
specialty. Made of only
"natural" ingredients, the
cherry, strawberry, honey,
brambleberry and olallieberry
were top prize winners in the
1974 Los Angeles County Fair.
Another wine unique to
Bargetto's is an excellent red
wine called Barbers.
Bargetto's volume runs
about 150,000 gallons yearly,
and it only sells through its
own outlets.
