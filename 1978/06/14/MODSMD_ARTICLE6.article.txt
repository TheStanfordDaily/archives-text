## Senior Class Presidents: a year of frustration and fun 
### 
"Choosing a Commence
ment Speaker, publishing
newsletters and a directory,
and planning activities like
Senior Happy Hours — these
are jobs of the Senior Class
Presidents." It has been over
a year since we wrote this
down on our election cam
paign posters, the ones with
four "constructive workers
and great ideas . . Since
that time we've learned how
much more there is to our
job, some of which meant
stuffing thousands of en
velopes while listening to AM
radio on a hot Saturday inside
Tresidder, while other "re
quirements" were a formal
dinner at the Factulty Club
with alumni.
As class officers, we were
often called on to represent
the student body on commit
tees such as the Alumni Trus
tee Nominating Committee.
Working for three weekends
Autumn and Winter quarter

with alumni from across the
country, Clark was treated as
an equal in the decision
making process and had the
opportunity of talking with at
torney Clark Clifford, Deputy
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and Mayor Tom
Bradley about possible can
didates. Pam worked as a vot
ing member of the Alumni
Executive Board which oper
ates Stanford Alumni Associa
tion and its many services.
The four of us assisted the
University in not only Com
mencement Speaker selec
tion, but Baccalaureate
speaker selection and plan
ning.
But so much forformality—
as representatives we learned
and observed but as party
planners and participants we
had our best times. Hiding in
the bathroom of Zot's when
the beer tickets were going
too fast, running out of root
beer floats on the National
Day of Fasting, professors
dealing at Casino Night, Tre
sidder Bowling Alley bursting
with pizza, beer and seniors,
the sight and sounds of Frost
from Senior Catsby Night, a
night in an innertube at de-
Guerre, and that immortal
word from The Graduate:
"plastics!" are what we re
member most. There are of
course those things we've
tried to forget, the band at the
street dance, the attendance
at the picnic, and the weather
at a Lake Lag happy hour, for

example.
We faced some frustra
tions, especially when it
seemed like no one we
wanted to work with on an
event cared about anything
but money. But that made the
people who went out of their
way to help and advise for
free even more special. We
met many people like that,
and hope seniors realize that
behind most activities were
people other than just us.
From a "hi" and a chat at a
happy hour to a dance with a
new partner, we got to know
more of our classmates this
year. For each of us this
stands out as the most re
warding experience of our
position.
The event for which we
have worked longest is still
before us — the Class Day
Senior-Parent Luncheon. We
hope it will be a chance for
seniors and their families to
enjoy a Class of '78 activity to
gether. We also hope to
thank seniors for their en
couragement and comple
ments, and remind them of
life after graduation to look
forward to: REUNIONS!
