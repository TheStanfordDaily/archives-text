# College is learning to find ones limits
## 
### 
When someone from a small
college visits Stanford for the
first time, there are usually
three questions they ask:
"How do you find your class on
this campus? (I've been driving
around for an hour!) How
much did you say you pay to go
here? (Faint) Who did you say
was in the Chemistry Depart
ment here? (Wow, Linus Paul
ing and Carl Djerassi!)
These are typical questions
of a large and distinquished
university such as Stanford,
but Stanford also has a unique
atmosphere which is very diffe
rent from eastern colleges.
Being in California, Stanford
has a large percentage of west
ern students. When the Ad
mission Committees of eastern
colleges draw on the eastern
population, the group is im
mediately divided between
public and private shcools.
Eastern universities are deeply
rooted in tradition and usually
tradition dictates that there
should be no women. Except
for Jane Stanford's quota of
500, Stanford has never dis
criminated against the admis
sion of women.
In fact, Stanford is a refresh
ing change for this female New
Yorker. It is a heterogenous
group of students who have a
common desire to succeed,
but usually find that they
can't ignore the urge to put
down the books and get out in
the sun. Stanford students
are some of the healthiest
looking people with the dar
kest tans that I've ever seen!
Having been founded 100 or
150 years after the Ivy Leagues,
Stanford has an ideal location
and a lot of land for expansion.
Lake Tahoe, Carmel, the
beach, the mountains, and San
Francisco are in an easily
reached. Most eastern colleges
are confined by cities, have a
higher crime problem and no

Lake Lagunita!
As a freshperson, I had a lot
of new things to adapt to, both
academically and socially. My
high school was a private girls'
school in New York in which
the largest class was, maybe, 25
girls. With Stanford came
Chemistry 31, a mere 250 stu
dents in the class, a median,
men and professors who en
gage in high power research.
Sports were very different too,
since I played midi on the
men's Junior Varsity Lacrosse
Team and lifted weights as a
part of training!
One of the most important
things at college is learning to
find your limits — how much
sleep you REALLY need, how
much partying is permissible,
how many hours of extra
curricular activities you can
commit yourself to and how to
meet new people. One of the
attractive featu res of the size of
Stanford is that it has more
scheduled activities than one
could do in a lifetime
Stanford provides a pre
medical student with some
rare opportunities. There are
an amazing diveristy of spe
cialty fields (as evidenced by
the 40-page Time Schedule.)
Professors in science are in
volved in high power research
and are usually interested in
having undergraduates as lab
assistants. I was fortunate to
get involved early in research
at the Medical School's De
partment of Medical Mic
robiology. Two years after
starting the research, I fol
lowed up at the University of
London's School of Pharmacy.
After returning to complete my
senior year, I did an honors
project in microbiology and
have presented my results at
two molecular biology sym
posiums.
When I came to Stanford, I
had no idea of what life in
California, life as a pre-med
and life in a co-ed environment
would bring. Next year, I will
enter the School of Medicine at
Buffalo, so my goal of becom
ing a clinical physician will be
realized. Fouryears after enter
ing Stanford, I will leave Stan
ford and California excited
about receiving my diploma
and my future plans, but with a
twinge of sadness since my ex
perience at Stanford has been
such a memorable one.

get involved early in research
at the Medical School's De
partment of Medical Mic
robiology. Two years after
starting the research, I fol
lowed up at the University of
London's School of Pharmacy.
After returning to complete my
senior year, I did an honors
project in microbiology and
have presented my results at
two molecular biology sym
posiums.
When I came to Stanford, I
had no idea of what life in
California, life as a pre-med
and life in a co-ed environment
would bring. Next year, I will
enter the School of Medicine at
Buffalo, so my goal of becom
ing a clinical physician will be
realized. Fouryears after enter
ing Stanford, I will leave Stan
ford and California excited
about receiving my diploma
and my future plans, but with a
twinge of sadness since my ex
perience at Stanford has been
such a memorable one.
