# Leaving 'enriched'
## 
### 
Four years ago, almost to the
day, I spoke at my high school
graduation entreating parents
to "let us fly," however shakily,
into young adulthood.
Now, I look back on those
words and try to assess my four
years at Stanford. One thing is
certain — adulthood, as all
stages of life, is not an age, but
a process. Often at Stanford, it
has been painful.
A few days after I came here
in September 1974, someone
said, "I know that you had no
trouble getting in, being black
and female, too." The state
ment denied my abilities and
mypersonhood It hurt, mainly
because I had not thoroughly
come to terms with blackness
or womanhood in my own life
experience.
I remember wanting to be
accepted by the black com
munity but feeling that I had to
do or say "black" things to
qualify. I felt shut out of the
extended family atmosphere
that seemed to exist at the
Black Cultural Center because
I did not live there. But in that
aloneness, my concept of
blackness began to become
more stable, coming from
within myself. Instead of using
a definition from outside of me
and making my life fit it, I
began to accept myself and
my own experience as validly
black.
At that time, I saw little need
to lend support to the move
ments and struggles of wo
men. In doing this, I now
realize that I had put by black
ness above my womanhood,
not acknowledging that I could
not choose between the two.
I do wonder sometimes how
these four years would have
been different had I gone to a
different university. Academi
cally, I have come to discover
that admission into these in
stitutions is bureaucratic and
sometimes arbitrary. The sub
stance is whether one can suc
ceed and benefit from the situ
ation. Thus special admissions

or not, I have come to know
that no one here should feel
that he or she should not be
here.
Outside of the realm of
academics, Stanford is often
described as Utopian, a bubble
of unreality. To a large extent
this is the case. However, there
is nothing unreal about the
cutbacks that minority prog
rams are constantly plagued
with here; there is nothing un
real about the millions of dol
lars that the University still has
invested in firms doing busi
ness in South Africa. No one
should be fooled.
This situation has allowed
me the space and time to come
to know myself better, and to
become more confident in my
abilities. Thus, my dealings
with the University have en
riched me, often by helping me
to define those areas that are
important enough to me to
struggle for. I feel that as I leave
here, I have changed, but have
not been programmed. I have
become stronger, able to and
wanting to accept more re
sponsibility for continued
growth.
