# The
						Farm: a myriad of people
## 
### 
Where is The Farm,
anyway? I look around at
the additions of the past
four years: a law school,
an engineering building,
Casa Italiana, and a
million-dollar fountain.
Hardly the trappings of a
farm. As I await graduation
with joy and with sadness,
I can reflect on my Stan
ford career as a myriad of
people and experiences
which combined to help
me grow and mature.
As a "frat-rat" I had a
perspective on Stanford
life very different from that
of Stern or Roble. I have
found that the reputation
of a fraternity often de
scribes the members of
five years ago, rather than
those of the present time.
More than once during a
conversation I have been
greeted with, "Oh, you're
a KA? But you're nice."
The bulk of the verbal
sexism and "macho"
competition that an all
male environment breeds
is in my opinion just that:
verbal.
Since I do live in a
fraternity, it is with some
excitement, and much an
xiety, that I witness the
reincarnation of
sororities. I am glad that at
last women have an op
portunity to form close
friendships with other
women. I am scared to
death when I visualize
sororities at Stanford even
resembling those at USC
or those at the University
of Georgia.
Closed sorority
fraternity parties could all
too easily become a habit
that would disastrously
stratify the casual social
life that now exists. I am
optimistic that the women
who are recreating Stan
ford sororities will not let

this happen.
Academically, Stanford
is undeniably abundant in
outstanding faculty mem
bers, superb classes, and
very smart students. I dis
covered too late for my
own liking that the faculty
members who taught my
300-person biology and
chemistry lectures were
willing to be as personal as
I desired, if I made the ini
tial effort.
As a student, I wanted to
graduate as something
more creative than a pre
med biology major. Unfor
tunately, my pre-dental
career with a chemistry
major fell by the wayside,
and here I sit — proud as
hell to be a Stanford
graduate going to medical
school with a B.S. in biol
ogy-
My primary reason for
coming here in the first
place was for the people.
Everyone I had met who
had attended Stanford car
ried an air about them
which I can best describe
as self-assurance. I hoped
that after four years some
of it would rub off on me.
Consequently, I enjoyed
my college life and spent
time with friends a bit
more than many self
respecting pre-meds — by
backpacking to a Vosemite
lake when I should have
been researching, or by
watching a sunset over the
Pacific instead of banging
out physics problems on
my calculator. My regrets
are few.
The best thing I did here
was working around the
pre-med curriculum (and
at the time, my chemistry
major) to go overseas.
During my two-quarter
stay in Florence, most of
my closest friendships de
veloped. We taught high

schoolers from Prato the
hustle. We spent twenty
five hours in a train just to
drink dark beer in Munich
for an afternoon. I swam
off Capri during the first
week in February with 20
mad Russians. I
camped on a beach on the
Isle of Elba with only a bot
tle of wine, a starving dog,
and a friend.
One of the worst deci
sions I have seen the Stan
ford administration make
was to slash the overseas
budget by over 50 per
cent, and to close the
Beutelsbach campus al
together. In Europe we
experienced cultures,
lifestyles, and lives to
gether. To curtail the
program is unfair to those
students who will never be
there as I was.
Now, as I run past "the
Dish" and contemplate my
difficult and uncertain fu
ture life, I can remember
the good times I have had
with friends. From mid
night pizza and nude pool
runs freshman year to
Thursday night at the "O"
and Senior Happy Hours at
Zot's, Stanford has truly
been a worthwhile experi
ence.
