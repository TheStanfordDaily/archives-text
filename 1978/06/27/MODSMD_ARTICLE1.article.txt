# Kennedy addresses grads

### John Nielsen 
Food and Drug Commis
sioner Donald Kennedy, the
commencement speakerat last
week's graduation ceremony,
had some hard language ready
for neoconservatives who use
"deliberate nonsense" in an
effort to make government of
ficials "more cautious than
their duty requires."
Currently on leave from the
University, Kennedy addres
sed himself to "one of the
best-advertised features of
contemporary American polit
ical life ... a loss of faith in
government." He spoke on
that subject to a capacity crowd
of 12,000 in Frost Ampitheater
on June 17.
Neoconservatism
"Each region of the country
seems to be developing its own
neoconservative ethos," Ken
nedy said. "The establishment
East gives us the inevitable
touch of trendy intellec
tualism, with ex-liberals trying
to outpublish one another on
the failures of Great Society
and New Frontier social prog
rams.
"In the nation's heartland,
there is the traditional
populism, strengthened by the
anti-regulatory analysis from
whatever fraction of Chicago
economics still lives in
Chicago.
"And out there in the home
state," he continued, "one
notes the development of a
new governmental style in
which the most troublesome
social problems are ap
proached by expectant medita
tion. The trouble, as we found
out last week, is that when you
substitute that for dollars,
people start to notice that you
are accumulating too many of
the latter."
Kennedy said that the
growth of "regulated enter
prise" is accompanied by a
growing conviction on the part
of the public that "govern
ment, and particularly gov
ernment regulators, are trying
to gain more control over their
lives."
Deliberate nonsense
That belief, insisted Ken
nedy, is based on "deliberate
nonsense." Its purpose is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a

lessened need for their ser
vices/and it evidences itself in
Time magazine stories on "The
End of the New Deal."
That means, he said, that
"The new conservatives would
have you believe that it sig
nifies only the end of wasteful
social programs and uncon
sionable intervention," while
"in reality it would mean the
death of an important concept
of social justice.

"In that concept, regulation
plays a special role: it protects
ordinary people against the
adverse consequences of pri
vate monopoly power, in the
form of anticompetitive ar
rangements and in the form of
external costs of corporate ac
tivity."
Past overreachings
Kennedy conceeded that
"regulators have overreached"
themselves in the past, adding
that "they will no doubt do it
again," but he argued that "we
have a mechanism for redres
sing these errors, and it is not
hesitancy or expediency on the
part of the regulators."
While it is difficult to pin
point the "troublesome, shift
ing boundary" between efforts
to advance human liberty
through public intervention
and actions which intrude on
that liberty, Kennedy warned
against the "all-out effort" cur
rently being made "to con
vince Americans that because
no accurate line can be drawn,
none should be drawn at all.
The administrator who is
frightened by anti-regulatory
pressure into doing less than
he should may save himself

from future controversy — but
it will cost the system its
chance at self-correction, and
withhold from the people their
voice in deciding how much
government they want."
Lyman attacks Prop. 13
President Richard Lyman ad
dressed himself to a theme
similar to that dealt with by
Kennedy when he noted a ten
dency "in this country ... to
translate whatever fears and
forbodings we may have into
attacks on our politics and
politicians . . . we Califor
nians, lashing out at what were
perceived to be irrational
methods of tax assessment, a
huge unused surplus in Sac
ramento, and hordes —
whether real or imaginary no
matter — of faceless bureauc
rats harassing us at our own
expense, have now in effect
voted to diminish sharply our
support of libraries, parks,
amenities of all sorts — and
education at all levels.
"Politics," he continued, "in
a free society has always been
riddled with ambiguity . . . un
intended results are closer to
the norm than to the excep
tion."
Lyman told the graduates
that one of the benefits of a
college education is an in
creased tolerance for am
biguity, and he expressed a
hope that "this includes a to
lerance for the ambiguities, the
inevitable messiness, the sheer
noise and confusion of politics
of a democracy."
Community colleges
Lyman singled out the com
munity college as a particularly
undeserving victim of Proposi
tion 13, calling it "one of the
most significant and promising
educational inventions of our
era, an era in which the world
of education is forever proc
laiming innovation but very
seldom achieving it. To reduce
their budgets so drastically
would be to slam the doors of
opportunity against the very
peoplewho only recently came
to know that such doors
existed — the disadvantaged,
the unwillingly illiterate, the
late starters, the elderly, the re
turning housewife anxious to
explore life beyond the four
walls of the house and the TV
set." "

hesitancy or expediency on the
part of the regulators."
While it is difficult to pin
point the "troublesome, shift
ing boundary" between efforts
to advance human liberty
through public intervention
and actions which intrude on
that liberty, Kennedy warned
against the "all-out effort" cur
rently being made "to con
vince Americans that because
no accurate line can be drawn,
none should be drawn at all.
The administrator who is
frightened by anti-regulatory
pressure into doing less than
he should may save himself

from future controversy — but
it will cost the system its
chance at self-correction, and
withhold from the people their
voice in deciding how much
government they want."
Lyman attacks Prop. 13
President Richard Lyman ad
dressed himself to a theme
similar to that dealt with by
Kennedy when he noted a ten
dency "in this country ... to
translate whatever fears and
forbodings we may have into
attacks on our politics and
politicians . . . we Califor
nians, lashing out at what were
perceived to be irrational
methods of tax assessment, a
huge unused surplus in Sac
ramento, and hordes —
whether real or imaginary no
matter — of faceless bureauc
rats harassing us at our own
expense, have now in effect
voted to diminish sharply our
support of libraries, parks,
amenities of all sorts — and
education at all levels.
"Politics," he continued, "in
a free society has always been
riddled with ambiguity . . . un
intended results are closer to
the norm than to the excep
tion."
Lyman told the graduates
that one of the benefits of a
college education is an in
creased tolerance for am
biguity, and he expressed a
hope that "this includes a to
lerance for the ambiguities, the
inevitable messiness, the sheer
noise and confusion of politics
of a democracy."
Community colleges
Lyman singled out the com
munity college as a particularly
undeserving victim of Proposi
tion 13, calling it "one of the
most significant and promising
educational inventions of our
era, an era in which the world
of education is forever proc
laiming innovation but very
seldom achieving it. To reduce
their budgets so drastically
would be to slam the doors of
opportunity against the very
peoplewho only recently came
to know that such doors
existed — the disadvantaged,
the unwillingly illiterate, the
late starters, the elderly, the re
turning housewife anxious to
explore life beyond the four
walls of the house and the TV
set." "

Donald Kennedy
Food and Drug Commis
sioner Donald Kennedy, the
commencement speakerat last
week's graduation ceremony,
had some hard language ready
for neoconservatives who use
"deliberate nonsense" in an
effort to make government of
ficials "more cautious than
their duty requires."
Currently on leave from the
University, Kennedy addres
sed himself to "one of the
best-advertised features of
contemporary American polit
ical life ... a loss of faith in
government." He spoke on
that subject to a capacity crowd
of 12,000 in Frost Ampitheater
on June 17.
Neoconservatism
"Each region of the country
seems to be developing its own
neoconservative ethos," Ken
nedy said. "The establishment
East gives us the inevitable
touch of trendy intellec
tualism, with ex-liberals trying
to outpublish one another on
the failures of Great Society
and New Frontier social prog
rams.
"In the nation's heartland,
there is the traditional
populism, strengthened by the
anti-regulatory analysis from
whatever fraction of Chicago
economics still lives in
Chicago.
"And out there in the home
state," he continued, "one
notes the development of a
new governmental style in
which the most troublesome
social problems are ap
proached by expectant medita
tion. The trouble, as we found
out last week, is that when you
substitute that for dollars,
people start to notice that you
are accumulating too many of
the latter."
Kennedy said that the
growth of "regulated enter
prise" is accompanied by a
growing conviction on the part
of the public that "govern
ment, and particularly gov
ernment regulators, are trying
to gain more control over their
lives."
Deliberate nonsense
That belief, insisted Ken
nedy, is based on "deliberate
nonsense." Its purpose is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a

lessened need for their ser
vices/and it evidences itself in
Time magazine stories on "The
End of the New Deal."
That means, he said, that
"The new conservatives would
have you believe that it sig
nifies only the end of wasteful
social programs and uncon
sionable intervention," while
"in reality it would mean the
death of an important concept
of social justice.

"In that concept, regulation
plays a special role: it protects
ordinary people against the
adverse consequences of pri
vate monopoly power, in the
form of anticompetitive ar
rangements and in the form of
external costs of corporate ac
tivity."
Past overreachings
Kennedy conceeded that
"regulators have overreached"
themselves in the past, adding
that "they will no doubt do it
again," but he argued that "we
have a mechanism for redres
sing these errors, and it is not
hesitancy or expediency on the
part of the regulators."
While it is difficult to pin
point the "troublesome, shift
ing boundary" between efforts
to advance human liberty
through public intervention
and actions which intrude on
that liberty, Kennedy warned

rently being made "to con
