# Constitution the 'winner' in Skokie decision
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) — His long
feared Skokie march never
came off. But after 15 months
of court victories and the kind
of publicity money could not
have bought, Nazi Frank Collin
may have gained some points.
Collin, ironically the son of a
German Jew who survived a
Nazi death camp, adeptly
foisted a rabble-rousing hand
ful of followers into the na
tional spotlight, at least tem
porarily. Through invaluable
assistance from — also ironi
cally — a Jewish attorney for
the American Civil Liberties
Union, he exercised rights
guaranteed him by the U.S.
Constitution.
And by posing a threat to
Jewish victims of Nazism, Col
lin was able — and may con
tinue — to attract serious
media attention.
That attention could be use
ful in keeping before the pub
lic the white-power message
that Collin and his followers
subscribe to: subjection of
blacks and minorities and de
struction of Jews.
Ostensibly, Collin fought in
court for his right to free
speech, both in Skokie and in

Chicago parks. Others con
tend he only sought publicity
and never intended to go to
Skokie.
Who won, and who lost?
And what were the stakes?
David Coldberger, the ACLU
lawye/, says the Constitution is
the real winner in the ordeal
that began in March 1977. "Af
ter 15 months of agonizing liti
gation, the First Amendment
has emerged undamaged."
But if the law prevailed, it
was at great cost to the ACLU.
Coldberger and officers in Il
linois and nationwide were vil
ified for their defense of Nazis
on constitutional grounds. Na
tional membership dropped 15
percent.
Skokie avoided a volatile
demonstration at the last mo
ment, but endured a year of
agitation and the threat of a
Nazi march before regaining its
peace. The village hung on the
edge of anticipation until the
last possible moment. Mayor
Albert Smith, who led the fight
to keep Collin out, was hos
pitalized recently for nervous
exhaustion.
Legal fees of the village came
out of its regular legal budget

of about $90,000 to five salaried
attorneys, Corporation Coun
sel Harvey Schwartz said Sun
day. He said there were no
extra legal costs involved, al
though printing costs were
about $3000. There will be
more legal expense if the Sup
reme Court hears the village's
appeal of a lower court deci
sion striking down its ordi
nances designed to bar the
Nazis. No money was
budgeted for the Nazi fight,
Schwartz added.
Last week, Smith said he had
no estimate of total costs to the
village: "When you are talking
about people's health and wel
fare and the welfare of the
community, I don't think
there's any price . . . price is
really not that significant."
The specter of goose
stepping brown-shirtea storm
troopers wearing swastikas did
not become a modern reality
for Skokie's Jews. But they did
have to endure the agony of
anticipation.
Collin displayed uncanny
ability in recent days to key his
moves to live television cover
age — and strung everyone
along by a seeming ability to

play off one demand against
another and maintain sus
pense until the end.
The furor over the proposed
march in Skokie peaked last
week with Collin winning still
more victories in the courts —
which upheld his group's right
to demonstrate — and the
media reporting blow-by-blow
locally, nationally, internation
ally.
A giant peaceful demonstra
tion was planned in Skokie
while Collin's rally was on but
was canceled when he called it
off. Collin staged his Saturday
"victory rally" at a barricaded
federal building plaza, where
he needed no permit, to celeb
rate a court order allowing him
to march in city parks without
posting any insurance bond.
But anti-Nazis vowed to re
sist Collin's efforts to speak in
Marquette Park or elsewhere
— as Skokians did.
Collin has won in some
ways, achieving a notoriety un
imaginable a year and a half
ago. And the courts have said
he could march.
He did it by taking on Skokie
officials, seeking a permit for
his National Socialist Party of
America to demonstrate in
front of the village hall.
He had tried to get permits to
march in other places, but the

officials did not bother to re
ply. But Skokie, with a third of
its 69,000 residents Jewish and
several thousand survivors of
World War II concentration
camps was different.
Skokie said no and passed
three ordinances to bar a Nazi
rally, which Collin and the
ACLU challenged as abridging
free speech rights.
State and federal courts
overturned the ordinances. A
few weeks ago, June 12, the
U.S. Supreme Court said Col
lin could demonstrate in
Skokie while it decided
whether to hear the appeal.
In the meantime, a federal
judge said the Chicago Park
District could not set any in
surance bond to keep Collin
from rallying.
Collin called Skokie his
"lever" to obtain the park rul
ing, saying he really only
wanted to march in Marquette
Park. Even an attorney for the
park district accused Judge
George N. Leighton of bowing
to pressure to avoid a Skokie
march — which the judge de
nied.
Collin has not gotten a Mar
quette Park permit yet but says
he'll start the Skokie issue
again if he doesn't. The park
district, meanwhile, still may
appeal.

more victories in the courts —
which upheld his group's right
to demonstrate — and the
media reporting blow-by-blow
locally, nationally, internation
ally.
A giant peaceful demonstra
tion was planned in Skokie
while Collin's rally was on but
was canceled when he called it
off. Collin staged his Saturday
"victory rally" at a barricaded
federal building plaza, where
he needed no permit, to celeb
rate a court order allowing him
to march in city parks without
posting any insurance bond.
But anti-Nazis vowed to re
sist Collin's efforts to speak in
Marquette Park or elsewhere
— as Skokians did.
Collin has won in some
ways, achieving a notoriety un
imaginable a year and a half
ago. And the courts have said
he could march.
He did it by taking on Skokie
officials, seeking a permit for
his National Socialist Party of
America to demonstrate in
front of the village hall.
He had tried to get permits to
march in other places, but the

officials did not bother to re
ply. But Skokie, with a third of
its 69,000 residents Jewish and
several thousand survivors of
World War II concentration
camps was different.
Skokie said no and passed
three ordinances to bar a Nazi
rally, which Collin and the
ACLU challenged as abridging
free speech rights.
State and federal courts
overturned the ordinances. A
few weeks ago, June 12, the
U.S. Supreme Court said Col
lin could demonstrate in
Skokie while it decided
whether to hear the appeal.
In the meantime, a federal
judge said the Chicago Park
District could not set any in
surance bond to keep Collin
from rallying.
Collin called Skokie his
"lever" to obtain the park rul
ing, saying he really only
wanted to march in Marquette
Park. Even an attorney for the
park district accused Judge
George N. Leighton of bowing
to pressure to avoid a Skokie
march — which the judge de
nied.
Collin has not gotten a Mar
quette Park permit yet but says
he'll start the Skokie issue
again if he doesn't. The park
district, meanwhile, still may
appeal.
Chicago (AP) — His long
feared Skokie march never
came off. But after 15 months
of court victories and the kind
of publicity money could not
have bought, Nazi Frank Collin
may have gained some points.
Collin, ironically the son of a
German Jew who survived a
Nazi death camp, adeptly
foisted a rabble-rousing hand
ful of followers into the na
tional spotlight, at least tem
porarily. Through invaluable
assistance from — also ironi
cally — a Jewish attorney for
the American Civil Liberties
Union, he exercised rights
guaranteed him by the U.S.
Constitution.
And by posing a threat to
Jewish victims of Nazism, Col
lin was able — and may con
tinue — to attract serious
media attention.
That attention could be use
ful in keeping before the pub
lic the white-power message
that Collin and his followers
subscribe to: subjection of
blacks and minorities and de
struction of Jews.
Ostensibly, Collin fought in
court for his right to free
speech, both in Skokie and in

Chicago parks. Others con
tend he only sought publicity
and never intended to go to
Skokie.
Who won, and who lost?
And what were the stakes?
David Coldberger, the ACLU
lawye/, says the Constitution is
the real winner in the ordeal
that began in March 1977. "Af
ter 15 months of agonizing liti
gation, the First Amendment
has emerged undamaged."
But if the law prevailed, it
was at great cost to the ACLU.
Coldberger and officers in Il
linois and nationwide were vil
ified for their defense of Nazis
on constitutional grounds. Na
tional membership dropped 15
percent.
Skokie avoided a volatile
demonstration at the last mo
ment, but endured a year of
agitation and the threat of a
Nazi march before regaining its
peace. The village hung on the
edge of anticipation until the
last possible moment. Mayor
Albert Smith, who led the fight
to keep Collin out, was hos
pitalized recently for nervous
exhaustion.
Legal fees of the village came
out of its regular legal budget

of about $90,000 to five salaried
attorneys, Corporation Coun
sel Harvey Schwartz said Sun
day. He said there were no
extra legal costs involved, al
though printing costs were
about $3000. There will be
more legal expense if the Sup
reme Court hears the village's
appeal of a lower court deci
sion striking down its ordi
nances designed to bar the
Nazis. No money was
budgeted for the Nazi fight,
Schwartz added.
Last week, Smith said he had
no estimate of total costs to the
village: "When you are talking
about people's health and wel
fare and the welfare of the
community, I don't think
there's any price . . . price is
really not that significant."
The specter of goose
stepping brown-shirtea storm
troopers wearing swastikas did
not become a modern reality
for Skokie's Jews. But they did
have to endure the agony of
anticipation.
Collin displayed uncanny
ability in recent days to key his
moves to live television cover
age — and strung everyone
along by a seeming ability to

play off one demand against
another and maintain sus
pense until the end.
