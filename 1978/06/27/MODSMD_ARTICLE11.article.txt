# Economy postpones national health plan
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The peril
of inflation is causing President
Jimmy Carter to put off the na
tional health insurance he
promised the nation.
Carter said at his news con
ference yesterday"it might
take many years" before
economic conditions permit
full implementation of the
plan, which he promised dur
ing his election campaign.
But the president said he will
give his Health, Education and
Welfare secretary instructions
within the next few days "to
comply with principles that I
outlined to him in the prepara
tion of a national health prop
osal."
White House aides have
been saying for several weeks
that those principles would be
forthcoming soon. But sources
reported shortly before Car
ter's news conference that in
flation could cause him to re
consider, or even break, what
was one of his key campaign
pledges.
On May 22, Health, Educa

tion and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano asked Carter
to choose either a narrow
health plan to help only socie
ty's neediest, or a broad pac
kage to guarantee care for all
Americans. That request is still
on Carter's desk, and his
comments Monday did not
make it clear which he would
choose.
"I do favor a comprehensive
health proposal," he told re
porters, but added: "Now, at
this time, the high inflation rate
and the very tight budget con
straints would not permit im
mediate implementation of it.
It might take many years before
the final plan is completely put
into effect."
The program's planners, in
fact, are seeking ways to tie
implementation to the health
of the economy.
Before the news conference,
White House sources were un
certain whether Carter would
keep the promise at all. "Any
thing is possible at this point,"
said one source who did not

want to be identified.
When Califano sent his
memo asking for Carter's deci
sion, backers thought it was
simply a formality. As far as
they were concerned, the pres
ident had made his choice six
months before he was elected,
when he pledged a universal,
mandatory and comprehen
sive health care program.
After he was elected, Carter
said he would send national
health insurance legislation to
Congress early this year. None
has been sent.
"We thought we were very
close," another administration
source said, asking not to be
identified. "But the threshhold
decision still has not been
made. There has been some
definite backtracking."
Time and deadlines have
passed, and it is clear there is
pressure on Carter to trim the
program he promised.
The principal objections are
from the president's economic
advisers, who say the nation
can't afford the inflationary

spending that national health
insurance would bring. The
cost of living already has been
rising this yearat an annual rate
of about 10 percent.
Califano estimates that even
the narrow proposal would
cost $15 billion to $27 billion in
new government outlays, or
about $140 a year for every tax
payer. A broader plan to
guarantee everyone a "no
frills" benefit package would
cost about twice as much, or
$40 billion per year, in addition
to the $57 billion already being
spent on Medicare, Medicaid
and other health programs.
The broad program would
not provide coverage for
drugs, dental services, mental
health care, preventive atten
tion or long-term care.
Most individuals and
employers already pay a sub
stantial amount for private
health insurance, which does
not necessarily include those
options either.
Any program would face a
certain fight in Congress,

where other national health in
surance proposals have
lingered for years.
To those who fought those
past battles, "universal, man
datory and comprehensive"
means that everyone must be
provided basic protection
against the costs of sickness,
hospitalization, operations
and such preventive care as
regular check-ups and Pap
smears.
