## An encore Women win nationals 
### Emilie Deutsch 
The Cardinal women's ten
nis team brought home a na
tional championship |une 8 to
match the men's, and set two
historical precedents at the
same time. Not only is this the
first time that one school has
captured both the AIAW and
NCAA national tennis champ
ionships in one year, but the
women's national title marks
the first ever in Stanford wo
men's athletics.
The Cards upset the Univer
sity of Southern California 5-4
in the finals of the tournament
to end a Trojan 36-match win
ning streak that began in 1976.
USC, the champions of the
1977 season, were the favored
team, but the Cardinals re
ceived a key win from their
freshman doubles team of
Donna Rubin and Caryn Hertel
to clinch the victory.
The team score stood at 4-4
with Rubin and Hertel trailing
the USC doubles combination
of Stacy Margolin and Cindy

Dennis by a score of 4-2 in the
third set. But the Cards grab
bed the final fcui ijames to win
not only the iriui h (2-6, 6-.},
6-4), but the national title as
well.
Individual play
In individual tournament
play, Stanford monopolized
the doubles finals as two-time
defending champions Susie
Hagey and Diane Morrison
faced the sibling team-up of
Kathy and Barbara Jordan. It
took a three-set tie-breaker for
the Jordans to defeat the
Hagey-Morrison team 5-7, 6-3,
7-6.
In singles play, Kathy Jordan
reached the finals before fal
ling 7-5, 6-4 to No. 1 seeded
UCLA frosh Jeanne DuVall.
Fourth-seeded Barb Jordan
suffered a quarterfinal loss to
Kay McDaniel of LSU 3-6, 6-4,
6-4. Although unseeded, Stan
ford's Hagey also reached the
quarterfinals only to lose to
DuVall in straight sets. Morri
son lost in the round of 16 to

No. 2 seeded Margolin.
On the whole, it was an ex
cellent season. The women fi
nally experienced the sensa
tion of success after narrowly
avoiding it the past three years
by taking second. And the men
brought home their second na
tional championship in a row.
Together, Stanford's tennis
teams took an unprecedented
sweep of national collegiate
tennis competition to assure
their status as No. 1.
