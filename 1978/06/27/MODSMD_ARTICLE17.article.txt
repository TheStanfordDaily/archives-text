# 'Shrew': the best of the lot
## 
### 
"Shakespeare's 'The Tam
ing of the Shrew/ " notes
director )udd Parkin, is "a
farce, commedia dell'arte,
poetic fantasy, a rude man
ner'd shew, a festive com
edy, a brutal comedy, a
righte pleasante comity, a
gem, a blasphemey, a
dream, a plagiarism, a vau
deville, a comedy of man
ners, a comedy." It proves,
among other things, "that
Shakespeare was not an ec
lectic genius for nothing,"
and at Ashland it is the high
light of the festival and an
illustration of one of the
most often-heard critical
amorphisms in the area.
With "Tartuffe" it is an ex
cellent example of why
"Ashland does comedy
best," and if it has a weak
ness you will probably
never notice. This year's
production of "Shrew" gets
around the major stumbling
bocks involved therein by
being excruciatingly funny,
and by setting the central
characters in a iess-than
archtypal light. It features a
coordinated hysteria abet
ted by similarly coordinated
costume and staging
techniques, and it presents
a cast that does its job with
uniformly maniacal zeal.
The thing is funny
Most of all, though, the
thing is funny. It is ex
tremely funny. The actors
get laughs out of everything
from the pillars on the
Elizabethan Stage to the size
of their shoes to the play
that Shakespeare wrote,
and they do it without bog

ging down the action at the
forefront. Even the set
changers moonlighting
Petrucio's servants are in on
it — they bring out furniture
and set it down and then
come back and change it,
and change it again, and fi
nally move it back before
tiptoeing offstage. That
manuever, like Larry R. Bal
lard's speech delivered
through the guitar smashed
over his head, as well as

. . . most of all, though, the thing is
funny. Very funny. The actors get
laughs out of everything from the
lines of Shakespeare's play to the
sizes of their shoes.

Ronald Edmundson Wood's
death-defying attempts at
descending a stairway;
those are the kinds of things
that make a comedy comic.
Parkin's direction makes the
most of the aforementioned
abilities of the minor
characters in "Shrew," and
in so doing it sets the audi
ence in the isle.- pretty-near
continuously.
As for the major charac
ters, those whose relation
ship has been the source of
countless honors theses
comparing Shakespeare to
everything from a master of
parody to Anita Bryant —
the complexities and objec
tionable aspects of the sex
ual philosophy implicit in
that action are quite effec
tively ignored in Ashland's
"Shrew." Fredi Olster plays

a Katharina who has it com
ing from the first time she
attempts to verbally and
bodily obliterate everyone
unlucky enough to wander
onstage, and Rick Hamil
ton's Petrucio is clearly the
person to do it. Its not be
cause he's male and she's
female that Ashland's tam
ing takes place — here we
have a Petrucio that just
happens to be superior.
He's funnier than Kate, and

smarter than her as well,
and when in the end she
plays "total woman" it
doesn't seem all that sexist.
Because she deserved a
humbling this time the
speech is more easily
stomached, especially since
it comes across as more
than submissive testimony.
Oist"i 's Ashland Kate says
it all as -he is supposed to
say it, and she says it in such
a way as to convince
everyone on stage that she
is very much convinced, but
out there in the audience
you know she'll see 111 e
light. She and Petrucio are
playing games with the
others more than they are
proseletyzing, and in such a
way they make Ashland's
"Shrew" an unqualified
success.
