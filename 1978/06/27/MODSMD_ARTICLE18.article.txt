# 'Tartuffe': on target
## 
### 
Molier's "Tartuffe" is what they call a
"serious comedy." Like his other major
plays, it proves that everyone's life is
what one critic described as "a ro
mance, a farce, a disgrace," as its "ef
fect might be compared to what would
happen if, in a Mack Sennet movie,
when the clown throws a cream pie,
that pie should splash on the faces of all
the spectators."
Ashland's version of Molier's play
takes this dictum to heart with almost
the same degree of success as was the
case in "Shrew." Director Sabin Epstein
works with a cast that features several
of those persons responsible for the
success of Shakespeare's comedy, and
for the most part the actors do the same
with Moliere. Tartuffe is played with
masterful slimyness by Rex Raybold,
and Larry R. Ballard's Orgon is every bit
as good as his Hortensio — in this play
too we see a group determined to never
miss a laugh.
Only once
And they rarely do, which is almost
always good. Only when Epstein treats
the finish of the play does he go a little
overboard, but by then the mistake is
only slightly disappointing in view of all
that good acting.
"Tartuffe" is a play about a phoney
holy man's hold on a wealthy bourgeois
family. Orgon, the head of the family, is

completely taken in, and refuses to lis
ten to arguments from his children,
wife, wife's brother or maid. By the
time the wife is able to convince Orgon
of Tartuffe's hypocrisy the rat has taken
complete control, and it takes a near
divine intervention on the part of an
officer of the King to undo what has
been done.
Excessive pains
And Sabin goes to excessive pains in
his effort to let us know that he knows
that the conclusion of "Tartuffe" was
written primarily because the play was
first performed in court. His represen
tative of Louis XIV is overdressed, and
overacted, and instead of solving a
problem in the play he only succeeds in
underlining it. Only here does the pro
duction lose its forward momentum,
and dampen the enthusiasm of the au
dience, but again by then we've been
so taken in that it hardly ruins the play.
For the most part "Tartuffe" is a great
success marked by greatly successful
performances, and the proof can be
found on the faces of everyone in range
of Sabin's cream pie. He's a good shot,
as was Moliere — between the cast he
got and the play he wrote they hit damn
near a bulls-eye. This year's comedies
at Ashland are far and away the finest of
their productions.
