# Only 'Richard III' misfires
## 
### 
By Ashland's standards,
"Richard III" is disappointing.
It misfires repeatedly at mo
ments that are often critical,
and it fails to hold our interest
over all of its three-odd hours.

. . .Michael Santos, for several
reasons, is continually undercut, and
as a result he never gets a chance to
show us how well he can act. This
"Richard" never quite finds its foot
ing. . .

It has its strengths, but it also
has its failings, and all too often
the latter cancel the former
out.
As a result this play — oh
blasphemy — is boring, as it
simply doesn'f live up to last
year's "Henry VI, III"
("Richard 111 is the last of a
series of plays grown out of En
gland's "War of the Roses,"
and it completes the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival's
four-year staging of that
group). Last year Michael San
tos' performance as Richard of
Gloucester had made
everyone present anxious to
return and see him take the
crown, but this year Santos' er
ratic successes cannot carry
the show. His most important
moments are undercut in a var
iety of ways, and his most ef
fective speeches are similarly
undone. Director Pat Patton's
staging of the play has no glar
ing holes in it, but the play just

never gets going for a variety of
reasons.
Stow to warm up
First, Santos is slow to warm
up to his part. The famous first
soliloquy and the equally

well-known final lines are deli
vered in part with Santos' back
turned on the crowd — the
gratuitousness of the blocking
there undermines the skill with
which the words are spoken.
And Richard's first great show
of skill, in which he woos the
Lady Anne away from her hus
band's funeral procession;
that exchange never quite
comes off, and it leaves us un
convinced. Santos and Kenned
Mac Iver do not play off each

other well here, and the deci
sion to reduce the body being
carried to metal is a bad one.
Lady Anne's grief when she
shows her husband's wounds
seems hard to understand
here, and that in turn makes it
hard to share Richards' excite
ment when he outmanuevers
that grief. The effectiveness
with which this scene is played
can make or break a production
— this time it doesn't work and
thus greatly slows things
down.
And with all due respect, the
child actors are bad ones. The
Duke of York and the Prince of
Wales are just not up to their
parts, and that again makes it

difficult for Santos' Richard to
keep his momentum. He has
little to play off once again, and
once again his "victory" over
his "enemies" loses much of
its potency. Santos never really
has a chance to \how us how
well he can act in this play —
that is surely the thing that
makes this "Richard III" what it
is. It is a frustrating and erratic
show, this "Richard," and it
never quite finds its footing. It
is the kind of show that may
very well improve itself drasti
cally after several more per
formances, but as it stands now
it is disappointing to most
every good "Richard" fanatic.
