# Lyman rejects two amendments
## 
### Vickie Evangel 
President Richard Lyman has
vetoed two of the three ASSU
Constitutional Amendments
ratified by students during the
recent spring elections.
On June 15, Lyman an
nounced that he would not
ratify the separate assessment
levying and financial audit
amendments proposed and
ratified on the spring ballot.
Election results showed 71.2
percent of the students voting
yes on the separate levying
amendment for graduate stu
dents and 75.2 percent favor
ing the financial audit prop
osal.
The separate assessment
levying bill dealt with changing
the fee assessments which
fund programs and groups for
either undergraduates or
graduates. The amendment
proposed that separate
graduate student fee assess
ments could be levied by a
majority vote of at least 10 per
cent of graduate students.
The financial audit would
have mandated that organiza
tions seeking to put fee as
sessments on the ballot by pet
ition present financial data and
audits to the ASSU Senate and
Financial Manager.
Lyman outlined his reasons
for vetoing both issues in a let
ter of June 15 to Fred Crethel,
chairperson of the senate.
He stated that "it is impor

tant for an organization of
graduate students (in this in
stance) to appeal to graduate
student members of the ASSU
for a systematic collection of
fees to further their activities,
and it would be unfortunate if
undergraduate members were
to prevent this from occurring
by negative votes during the
election."
Agreed with intent
Though Lyman agreed with
the basic intent of the amend
ment, he strongly disagreed
with the provision that would
require only 10 percent of the
affected members vote instead
of the established minimum of
20 percent. Lyman finalized his
discussion of this issue in not
ing that the "change was not
needed in the present instance
as the fee assessment for the
Graduate Student Association
was supported by the majority
of all ASSU members who
voted."
Lyman stated, "the prop
osed audit amendment lacks
the precision and clarity
necessary to give guidance to
the legislature and officers of
the Association." For example,
Lyman asked "Does the Senate
have authority to keep fee as
sessments off the ballot if it
disapproves of the fee or of the
organization's budget or
spending record? If the Senate
should have such powers by
