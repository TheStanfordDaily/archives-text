## Furay: where he's been, where he's going 
### 
Richie Furay has been
around a long time. As the
legend goes, he and Stephen
Stills were driving down Sunset
Boulevard in 7966 when they
noticed a hearse being driven
by an old acquaintance from
the New York City club scene:
Neil Young. The three became
the nucleus of the Buffalo
Springfield, arguably one of
the best rock and roll bands
America produced in the six
ties. Since the Springfield
broke up in 1966, Furay has had
various degrees of success and
non-success with Poco, the
Souther, Hillman, Furay Band

and two solo albums, the latest
of which is the recently re
leased "Dance a Little Light."
Furay laughs easily and of
ten, and doesn't mind taking
the time to chat with his fans, a
hard core group of whom sang
Happy Birthday when he took
the stage for a recent perfor
mance at the Old Waldorf in
San Francisco, despite the fact
that his birthday had been nine
days earlier. Fie thanked them
with just what they had been
waiting for: a closing, eight
song medley of Buffalo
Springfield and Poco material.
The following is taken from an

interview conducted between
sets.
Daily: I just want to tell you
ahead of time, if I start asking
any questions you're really sick
of, like about Neil Young
hearse stories . . .(a man walks
up and introduces a young
couple).
Man: I'm sorry to interrupt fora
second, but I want you to meet
a couple people. Teri, this is
Richie.
Teri: Hi.
Richie: Teri?
Teri: (somewhat flustered) Hi.
Richie: How do you do, nice to
meet you.
Teri: We've been big fans since
the sixties.
Man: And this is Terry.
Terry: Happy Birthday.
Teri: (bashfully) Could we get
your 'John Henry'?
Richie: (looking around) If I can
borrow a piece of paper.
Daily: I just happen to have
one.
Teri: I was just saying how our
baby dances to your "Dance a
Little Light."
Richie: Is it Terry with a y, and
Teri with an i?
Terry: One with an i, one with a
y. (He signs and they depart.)
Daily: You sign a lot of 'John
Henrys' between snows?
Richie: Sometimes.
Daily: Anyway, as I was saying,
I know you've been doing this
for a long time, and if you're
really sick of any of this stuff,
I'll try not to touch on it . . .
That medley at the end, is that
an obligatory thing?
Richie: I don't wanna talk about
it. (Laughter) Obligatory?
Daily: Do you feel likeyou have
to get all the old songs in?
Richie: No. I wanna do it. I've
found that since I quit Poco, a
lot of my audience still comes
because of that and they de
serve to hear it, and I want to
give it to them.
Daily: Do you think you have a
lot of new fans?
Richie: Not yet, that's why I'm
out there working real hard.
Daily: What about the record,
it's pretty (pause) middle of the
road, compared to your ....
Richie: I don't know what you
mean by that.

Daily: A lot of violins.
Richie: Violins? Like Elton
John? I mean, is that middle of
the road?
Daily: (Wishing the subject had
never been brought up) I don't
mean you sound like Elton
)ohn.
Richie: No, I don't sound like
Elton John.
Daily: Those guys (Poco) are
back playing with you on the
new album. Jim Messina does a
great solo on one tune.
Richie: Jimmy and I are like two
peas in a pod. We've stayed in
touch and been very close
friends. We're closer now than
we've ever been. I really think I
chased Jimmy out of the band
— without knowing I was chas
ing him out of the band. I feel
like I held back his creative in
put. I mean, that's not really
how I look at it, and that's not
how he looks at it, either. He
went out and did what he had
to do, and did it excellently.
Sometimes, you know, you get
so wrapped up in what you're
doing that you can't see the
forest for the trees, and I made
that mistake back then. . . .
What I wanted to do on that
instrumental on "Stand Your
Guard," I wanted to get
Stephen (Stills) and Neil
(Young), Paul (Cotton) and
Rusty (Young), Jimmy (Mes
sina) and Al (Perkins) —all the
guitar players I've ever played
with — and have them come in
and just have a good time. But
Stephen was touring, Neil was
on a boat, Paul wouldn't do it,
and when it got that far I didn't
even call Jimmy to ask him to
come back. But I called Aland
he said he'd love to come in,
Rusty said he'd love to come in
and Virgil (Beckham) was there
too.
Daily: Is there any more?
Richie: I don't know how to
take that middle of the road
stuff, man.
Daily: It sounds middle of the
road to me.
Richie: You like the Sex Pistols?
Daily: No, do you?
Richie: No.
Daily: To be perfectly hon
est. . . .
Richie: If you're honest, man,
the heck with it, let's not even

do it.
Daily: Like on "Stand Your
Guard." There's some great
guitar stuff going on, but the
strings seem to take the guts
right out of it.
Richie: I guarantee you, if you
heard it without the strings,
you wouldn't like it. It's too
raw.
Daily: Raw definitely is not
where it's at these days.
Richie: Even at that, before the
strings went on it, it was not
held together right. Everything
that's on that album is my deci
sion. I don't want any producer
to take flack for it. If the pro
ducer says he likes something
and shakes me and says 'You
gotta do it,' you know, if I don't
like it, I won't do it. Because
that's me that's going out
there. And I love it. I think the
strings on there are exciting,
and I think they really add.
Daily: I think my problem is
that I get sick of hearing every
thing on the radio that has vio
lins stepping all over all the
other instruments. (A woman
of about 35 has sat down next
to us, and she speaks for the
first time).
Woman: You're just pre
judiced.
Richie: (to the woman) You re
mind me of someone I know
. . . (We find she is a high
school chum from Yellow
Springs, Ohio. A quick em
brace . . .)
Woman: I have a friend at work
who heard you when you
played at Palo Alto High School
in '67.
Richie: With the Byrds, right?
Woman: No, it was with some
body big.
Richie: (gently) The Byrds were
real big. (More general re
miniscing follows until Richie
mentions that his voice is
hoarse, and I see a chance to
get in a question).
Daily: Did you transpose "On
the Way Home" down a step
tonight?
Richie: No, but there are a few
tunes that I've done tonight
that are transposed down.
"Good Feelin' To Know,"
"Over and Over Again." I just
can't sing those night after
