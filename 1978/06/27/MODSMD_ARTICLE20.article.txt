## Furay: where he's been, where he's going 
### 
Richie Furay has been
around a long time. As the
legend goes, he and Stephen
Stills were driving down Sunset
Boulevard in 7966 when they
noticed a hearse being driven
by an old acquaintance from
the New York City club scene:
Neil Young. The three became
the nucleus of the Buffalo
Springfield, arguably one of
the best rock and roll bands
America produced in the six
ties. Since the Springfield
broke up in 1966, Furay has had
various degrees of success and
non-success with Poco, the
Souther, Hillman, Furay Band

and two solo albums, the latest
of which is the recently re
leased "Dance a Little Light."
Furay laughs easily and of
ten, and doesn't mind taking
the time to chat with his fans, a
hard core group of whom sang
Happy Birthday when he took
the stage for a recent perfor
mance at the Old Waldorf in
San Francisco, despite the fact
that his birthday had been nine
days earlier. Fie thanked them
with just what they had been
waiting for: a closing, eight
song medley of Buffalo
Springfield and Poco material.
The following is taken from an

interview conducted between
sets.
Daily: I just want to tell you
ahead of time, if I start asking
any questions you're really sick
of, like about Neil Young
hearse stories . . .(a man walks
up and introduces a young
couple).
Man: I'm sorry to interrupt fora
second, but I want you to meet
a couple people. Teri, this is
Richie.
Teri: Hi.
Richie: Teri?
Teri: (somewhat flustered) Hi.
Richie: How do you do, nice to
meet you.
Teri: We've been big fans since
the sixties.
Man: And this is Terry.
Terry: Happy Birthday.
Teri: (bashfully) Could we get
your 'John Henry'?
Richie: (looking around) If I can
borrow a piece of paper.
Daily: I just happen to have
one.
Teri: I was just saying how our
baby dances to your "Dance a
Little Light."
Richie: Is it Terry with a y, and
Teri with an i?
Terry: One with an i, one with a
y. (He signs and they depart.)
Daily: You sign a lot of 'John
Henrys' between snows?
Richie: Sometimes.
Daily: Anyway, as I was saying,
I know you've been doing this
for a long time, and if you're
really sick of any of this stuff,
I'll try not to touch on it . . .
That medley at the end, is that
an obligatory thing?
Richie: I don't wanna talk about
it. (Laughter) Obligatory?
Daily: Do you feel likeyou have
to get all the old songs in?
Richie: No. I wanna do it. I've
found that since I quit Poco, a
lot of my audience still comes
because of that and they de
serve to hear it, and I want to
give it to them.
Daily: Do you think you have a
lot of new fans?
Richie: Not yet, that's why I'm
out there working real hard.
Daily: What about the record,
it's pretty (pause) middle of the
road, compared to your ....
Richie: I don't know what you
mean by that.

Daily: A lot of violins.
Richie: Violins? Like Elton
John? I mean, is that middle of
the road?
Daily: (Wishing the subject had
never been brought up) I don't
mean you sound like Elton
)ohn.
Richie: No, I don't sound like
Elton John.
Daily: Those guys (Poco) are
back playing with you on the
new album. Jim Messina does a
great solo on one tune.
Richie: Jimmy and I are like two
peas in a pod. We've stayed in
touch and been very close
friends. We're closer now than
we've ever been. I really think I
chased Jimmy out of the band
— without knowing I was chas
ing him out of the band. I feel
like I held back his creative in
put. I mean, that's not really
how I look at it, and that's not
how he looks at it, either. He
went out and did what he had
to do, and did it excellently.
Sometimes, you know, you get
so wrapped up in what you're
doing that you can't see the
forest for the trees, and I made
that mistake back then. . . .
What I wanted to do on that
instrumental on "Stand Your
Guard," I wanted to get
Stephen (Stills) and Neil
(Young), Paul (Cotton) and
Rusty (Young), Jimmy (Mes
sina) and Al (Perkins) —all the
guitar players I've ever played
with — and have them come in
and just have a good time. But
Stephen was touring, Neil was
on a boat, Paul wouldn't do it,
and when it got that far I didn't
even call Jimmy to ask him to
come back. But I called Aland
he said he'd love to come in,
Rusty said he'd love to come in
and Virgil (Beckham) was there
too.
Daily: Is there any more?
Richie: I don't know how to
take that middle of the road
stuff, man.
Daily: It sounds middle of the
road to me.
Richie: You like the Sex Pistols?
Daily: No, do you?
Richie: No.
Daily: To be perfectly hon
est. . . .
Richie: If you're honest, man,
the heck with it, let's not even

do it.
Daily: Like on "Stand Your
Guard." There's some great
guitar stuff going on, but the
strings seem to take the guts
right out of it.
Richie: I guarantee you, if you
heard it without the strings,
you wouldn't like it. It's too
raw.
Daily: Raw definitely is not
where it's at these days.
Richie: Even at that, before the
strings went on it, it was not
held together right. Everything
that's on that album is my deci
sion. I don't want any producer
to take flack for it. If the pro
ducer says he likes something
and shakes me and says 'You
gotta do it,' you know, if I don't
like it, I won't do it. Because
that's me that's going out
there. And I love it. I think the
strings on there are exciting,
and I think they really add.
Daily: I think my problem is
that I get sick of hearing every
thing on the radio that has vio
lins stepping all over all the
other instruments. (A woman
of about 35 has sat down next
to us, and she speaks for the
first time).
Woman: You're just pre
judiced.
Richie: (to the woman) You re
mind me of someone I know
. . . (We find she is a high
school chum from Yellow
Springs, Ohio. A quick em
brace . . .)
Woman: I have a friend at work
who heard you when you
played at Palo Alto High School
in '67.
Richie: With the Byrds, right?
Woman: No, it was with some
body big.
Richie: (gently) The Byrds were
real big. (More general re
miniscing follows until Richie
mentions that his voice is
hoarse, and I see a chance to
get in a question).
Daily: Did you transpose "On
the Way Home" down a step
tonight?
Richie: No, but there are a few
tunes that I've done tonight
that are transposed down.
"Good Feelin' To Know,"
"Over and Over Again." I just
can't sing those night after

night any more. I haven't done
two sets a night for probably
seven, eight years. I've only
worked about five months out
of the last four years live. And I
don't sing right. I don't sing
from my diaphragm.
Woman: Yeah, but you haven't
lost your highs, I noticed.
Richie: They're gone tonight.
My voice is definitely hoarse
right now.
Daily: Have you had any train
ing for it?
Richie: I went to a person, and
actually took a lesson, but I
couldn't handle it. I'm gonna
try to get the breathing down,
because I think that'll help. But
as for EEAAOORRR (he breaks
into a quick aria). . .
Daily: Are there any more of
the old Buffalo Springfield
tunes in the can somewhere
waiting to be released?
Richie: Atlantic has them all.
They have the rights to release
them. I'm sure that Stephen
and Neil would probably have
fits over some of the stuff if
they did.
Daily: Is it good?
Richie: Whether it was good or
bad, it's something we did
then. There would be no pur
pose in putting it out. The
memory that you have of the
Springfield ought to last.
Daily: How does it ... A lot of
these guys you've played with
have gone on to be giant

names, and you're not a giant
name. I don't know how to tell
you this, Richie. I mean, you're
doing interviews with the Stan
ford Daily (long pause).
Richie: Hey man, talk to me.
Daily: Do you want to be a giant
name?
Richie: Let me put it this way. I
think a few years ago I might
have had more of a problem
dealing with that than I do
now, 'cause I know what I am,
and I know what I do, and I
know what I do is good. It's as
good as any of it that's going
down. It hasn't been accepted
on a mass scale, and for what
reason — hey, I don't know

why. Believe me, Poco could
have stood up with every single
band, bar none, and done their
business and taken care of it.
When you make a record,
when you create something
that comes from inside of you
and put it on that little piece of
plastic and ship it out, you re
ally want a lot of people to
enjoy it. You're really giving
something from inside, no
matter what you call it.
Whether you call it middle of
the road, hard rock, metal
rock, country rock, jazz rock,
dumb rock — it's a part of your
life, and you do the best you
can. I wouldn't trade my life for

any or anything that any of the
other guys have done. Now I'm
really close with Jimmy. Years
ago, we talked about what we
wanted to get out of life. Now
it's real strange. He took a
piece of it, and I've got the
other piece. He became very
successful in the eyes of the
people, he's very wealthy and
he'» really well off. I, on thfe
other hand, have my family,
and to me that's more impor
tant. I mean, hey look. What
more can I ask for? I've got
food on the table. I've got
good, good friends. I've got a
wife and three kids that I love
and that love me. If the rest of

that comes — outasite. I'll deal
with that when it comes. And
I've dealt with a lot of it over
the years. And that's why I say
Jimmy and I are real close.
We've seen our dream and we
both have a piece of it. I mean,
he loves my family . . . but he
hasn't been able to get that
type of thing together. He will.
I guarantee you he will. But I
wouldn't trade for any of what
Stephen or Neil or Jimmy have.
Those guys deserve everything
that they've got. They're
talented people, I don't want
to sound like I'm trying to take
anything away from them.

night any more. I haven't done
two sets a night for probably
seven, eight years. I've only
worked about five months out
of the last four years live. And I
don't sing right. I don't sing
from my diaphragm.
Woman: Yeah, but you haven't
lost your highs, I noticed.
Richie: They're gone tonight.
My voice is definitely hoarse
right now.
Daily: Have you had any train
ing for it?
Richie: I went to a person, and
actually took a lesson, but I
couldn't handle it. I'm gonna
try to get the breathing down,
because I think that'll help. But
as for EEAAOORRR (he breaks
into a quick aria). . .
Daily: Are there any more of
the old Buffalo Springfield
tunes in the can somewhere
waiting to be released?
Richie: Atlantic has them all.
They have the rights to release
them. I'm sure that Stephen
and Neil would probably have
fits over some of the stuff if
they did.
Daily: Is it good?
Richie: Whether it was good or
bad, it's something we did
then. There would be no pur
pose in putting it out. The
memory that you have of the
Springfield ought to last.
Daily: How does it ... A lot of
these guys you've played with
have gone on to be giant

names, and you're not a giant
name. I don't know how to tell
you this, Richie. I mean, you're
doing interviews with the Stan
ford Daily (long pause).
Richie: Hey man, talk to me.
Daily: Do you want to be a giant
name?
Richie: Let me put it this way. I
think a few years ago I might
have had more of a problem
dealing with that than I do
now, 'cause I know what I am,
and I know what I do, and I
know what I do is good. It's as
good as any of it that's going
down. It hasn't been accepted
on a mass scale, and for what
reason — hey, I don't know

why. Believe me, Poco could
have stood up with every single
band, bar none, and done their
business and taken care of it.
When you make a record,
when you create something
that comes from inside of you
and put it on that little piece of
plastic and ship it out, you re
ally want a lot of people to
enjoy it. You're really giving
something from inside, no
matter what you call it.
Whether you call it middle of
the road, hard rock, metal
rock, country rock, jazz rock,
dumb rock — it's a part of your
life, and you do the best you
can. I wouldn't trade my life for

any or anything that any of the
other guys have done. Now I'm
really close with Jimmy. Years
ago, we talked about what we
wanted to get out of life. Now
it's real strange. He took a
piece of it, and I've got the
other piece. He became very
successful in the eyes of the
people, he's very wealthy and
he'» really well off. I, on thfe
other hand, have my family,
and to me that's more impor
tant. I mean, hey look. What
more can I ask for? I've got
food on the table. I've got
good, good friends. I've got a
wife and three kids that I love
and that love me. If the rest of

that comes — outasite. I'll deal
with that when it comes. And
I've dealt with a lot of it over
the years. And that's why I say
Jimmy and I are real close.
We've seen our dream and we
both have a piece of it. I mean,
he loves my family . . . but he
hasn't been able to get that
type of thing together. He will.
I guarantee you he will. But I
wouldn't trade for any of what
Stephen or Neil or Jimmy have.
Those guys deserve everything
that they've got. They're
talented people, I don't want
to sound like I'm trying to take
anything away from them.
Richie Furay has been
around a long time. As the
legend goes, he and Stephen
Stills were driving down Sunset
Boulevard in 7966 when they
noticed a hearse being driven
by an old acquaintance from
the New York City club scene:
Neil Young. The three became
the nucleus of the Buffalo
Springfield, arguably one of
the best rock and roll bands
America produced in the six
ties. Since the Springfield
broke up in 1966, Furay has had
various degrees of success and
non-success with Poco, the
Souther, Hillman, Furay Band

and two solo albums, the latest
of which is the recently re
leased "Dance a Little Light."
Furay laughs easily and of
ten, and doesn't mind taking
the time to chat with his fans, a
hard core group of whom sang
Happy Birthday when he took
the stage for a recent perfor
mance at the Old Waldorf in
San Francisco, despite the fact
that his birthday had been nine
days earlier. Fie thanked them
with just what they had been
waiting for: a closing, eight
song medley of Buffalo
Springfield and Poco material.
The following is taken from an

interview conducted between
sets.
Daily: I just want to tell you
ahead of time, if I start asking
any questions you're really sick
of, like about Neil Young
hearse stories . . .(a man walks
up and introduces a young
couple).
Man: I'm sorry to interrupt fora
second, but I want you to meet
a couple people. Teri, this is
Richie.
Teri: Hi.
Richie: Teri?
Teri: (somewhat flustered) Hi.
Richie: How do you do, nice to
meet you.
Teri: We've been big fans since
the sixties.
Man: And this is Terry.
Terry: Happy Birthday.
Teri: (bashfully) Could we get
your 'John Henry'?
Richie: (looking around) If I can
borrow a piece of paper.
Daily: I just happen to have
one.
Teri: I was just saying how our
baby dances to your "Dance a
Little Light."
Richie: Is it Terry with a y, and
Teri with an i?
Terry: One with an i, one with a
y. (He signs and they depart.)
Daily: You sign a lot of 'John
Henrys' between snows?
Richie: Sometimes.
Daily: Anyway, as I was saying,
I know you've been doing this
for a long time, and if you're
really sick of any of this stuff,
I'll try not to touch on it . . .
That medley at the end, is that
an obligatory thing?
Richie: I don't wanna talk about
it. (Laughter) Obligatory?
Daily: Do you feel likeyou have
to get all the old songs in?
Richie: No. I wanna do it. I've
found that since I quit Poco, a
lot of my audience still comes
because of that and they de
serve to hear it, and I want to
give it to them.
Daily: Do you think you have a
lot of new fans?
Richie: Not yet, that's why I'm
out there working real hard.
Daily: What about the record,
it's pretty (pause) middle of the
road, compared to your ....
Richie: I don't know what you
mean by that.

Daily: A lot of violins.
Richie: Violins? Like Elton
John? I mean, is that middle of
the road?
Daily: (Wishing the subject had
never been brought up) I don't
mean you sound like Elton
)ohn.
Richie: No, I don't sound like
Elton John.
Daily: Those guys (Poco) are
back playing with you on the
new album. Jim Messina does a
great solo on one tune.
Richie: Jimmy and I are like two
peas in a pod. We've stayed in
touch and been very close
friends. We're closer now than
we've ever been. I really think I
chased Jimmy out of the band
— without knowing I was chas
ing him out of the band. I feel
like I held back his creative in
put. I mean, that's not really
how I look at it, and that's not
how he looks at it, either. He
went out and did what he had
to do, and did it excellently.
Sometimes, you know, you get
so wrapped up in what you're
doing that you can't see the
forest for the trees, and I made
that mistake back then. . . .
What I wanted to do on that
instrumental on "Stand Your
Guard," I wanted to get
Stephen (Stills) and Neil
(Young), Paul (Cotton) and
Rusty (Young), Jimmy (Mes
sina) and Al (Perkins) —all the
guitar players I've ever played
with — and have them come in
and just have a good time. But
Stephen was touring, Neil was
on a boat, Paul wouldn't do it,
and when it got that far I didn't
even call Jimmy to ask him to
come back. But I called Aland
he said he'd love to come in,
Rusty said he'd love to come in
and Virgil (Beckham) was there
too.
Daily: Is there any more?
Richie: I don't know how to
take that middle of the road
stuff, man.
Daily: It sounds middle of the
road to me.
Richie: You like the Sex Pistols?
Daily: No, do you?
Richie: No.
Daily: To be perfectly hon
est. . . .
Richie: If you're honest, man,
the heck with it, let's not even

do it.
Daily: Like on "Stand Your
Guard." There's some great
guitar stuff going on, but the
strings seem to take the guts
right out of it.
Richie: I guarantee you, if you
heard it without the strings,
you wouldn't like it. It's too
raw.
Daily: Raw definitely is not
where it's at these days.
Richie: Even at that, before the
strings went on it, it was not
held together right. Everything
that's on that album is my deci
sion. I don't want any producer
to take flack for it. If the pro
ducer says he likes something
and shakes me and says 'You
gotta do it,' you know, if I don't
like it, I won't do it. Because
that's me that's going out
there. And I love it. I think the
strings on there are exciting,
and I think they really add.
Daily: I think my problem is
that I get sick of hearing every
thing on the radio that has vio
lins stepping all over all the
other instruments. (A woman
of about 35 has sat down next
to us, and she speaks for the
first time).
Woman: You're just pre
judiced.
Richie: (to the woman) You re
mind me of someone I know
. . . (We find she is a high
school chum from Yellow

Woman: I have a friend at work

Teri: (bashfully) Could we get
your 'John Henry'?
Richie: (looking around) If I can
borrow a piece of paper.
Daily: I just happen to have
one.
Teri: I was just saying how our
baby dances to your "Dance a
Little Light."
Richie: Is it Terry with a y, and
Teri with an i?
Terry: One with an i, one with a
y. (He signs and they depart.)
Daily: You sign a lot of 'John
Henrys' between snows?
Richie: Sometimes.
Daily: Anyway, as I was saying,
I know you've been doing this
for a long time, and if you're
really sick of any of this stuff,
I'll try not to touch on it . . .
That medley at the end, is that
an obligatory thing?
Richie: I don't wanna talk about
it. (Laughter) Obligatory?
Daily: Do you feel likeyou have
to get all the old songs in?
Richie: No. I wanna do it. I've
found that since I quit Poco, a
lot of my audience still comes
because of that and they de
serve to hear it, and I want to
give it to them.
Daily: Do you think you have a
lot of new fans?
Richie: Not yet, that's why I'm
out there working real hard.
Daily: What about the record,
it's pretty (pause) middle of the
road, compared to your ....
Richie: I don't know what you
mean by that.

Daily: A lot of violins.
Richie: Violins? Like Elton
John? I mean, is that middle of
the road?
Daily: (Wishing the subject had
never been brought up) I don't
mean you sound like Elton
)ohn.
Richie: No, I don't sound like
Elton John.
Daily: Those guys (Poco) are
back playing with you on the
new album. Jim Messina does a
great solo on one tune.
Richie: Jimmy and I are like two
peas in a pod. We've stayed in
touch and been very close
friends. We're closer now than
we've ever been. I really think I
chased Jimmy out of the band
— without knowing I was chas
ing him out of the band. I feel
like I held back his creative in
put. I mean, that's not really
how I look at it, and that's not
how he looks at it, either. He
went out and did what he had
to do, and did it excellently.
Sometimes, you know, you get
so wrapped up in what you're
doing that you can't see the
forest for the trees, and I made
that mistake back then. . . .
What I wanted to do on that
instrumental on "Stand Your
Guard," I wanted to get
Stephen (Stills) and Neil
(Young), Paul (Cotton) and
Rusty (Young), Jimmy (Mes
sina) and Al (Perkins) —all the
guitar players I've ever played
with — and have them come in
and just have a good time. But
Stephen was touring, Neil was
on a boat, Paul wouldn't do it,
and when it got that far I didn't
even call Jimmy to ask him to
come back. But I called Aland
he said he'd love to come in,
Rusty said he'd love to come in
and Virgil (Beckham) was there
too.
Daily: Is there any more?
Richie: I don't know how to
take that middle of the road
stuff, man.
Daily: It sounds middle of the
road to me.
Richie: You like the Sex Pistols?
Daily: No, do you?
Richie: No.
Daily: To be perfectly hon
est. . . .
Richie: If you're honest, man,
the heck with it, let's not even

do it.
Daily: Like on "Stand Your
Guard." There's some great
guitar stuff going on, but the
strings seem to take the guts
right out of it.
Richie: I guarantee you, if you
heard it without the strings,
you wouldn't like it. It's too
raw.
Daily: Raw definitely is not
where it's at these days.
Richie: Even at that, before the
strings went on it, it was not
held together right. Everything
that's on that album is my deci
sion. I don't want any producer
to take flack for it. If the pro
ducer says he likes something
and shakes me and says 'You
gotta do it,' you know, if I don't
like it, I won't do it. Because
that's me that's going out
there. And I love it. I think the
strings on there are exciting,
and I think they really add.
Daily: I think my problem is
that I get sick of hearing every
thing on the radio that has vio
lins stepping all over all the
other instruments. (A woman
of about 35 has sat down next
to us, and she speaks for the
first time).
Woman: You're just pre
judiced.
Richie: (to the woman) You re
mind me of someone I know
. . . (We find she is a high
school chum from Yellow
Springs, Ohio. A quick em
brace . . .)
Woman: I have a friend at work
who heard you when you
played at Palo Alto High School
in '67.
Richie: With the Byrds, right?
Woman: No, it was with some
body big.
Richie: (gently) The Byrds were
real big. (More general re
miniscing follows until Richie
mentions that his voice is
hoarse, and I see a chance to
get in a question).
Daily: Did you transpose "On
the Way Home" down a step
tonight?
Richie: No, but there are a few
tunes that I've done tonight
that are transposed down.
"Good Feelin' To Know,"
"Over and Over Again." I just
can't sing those night after

night any more. I haven't done
two sets a night for probably
seven, eight years. I've only
worked about five months out
of the last four years live. And I
don't sing right. I don't sing
from my diaphragm.
Woman: Yeah, but you haven't
lost your highs, I noticed.
Richie: They're gone tonight.
My voice is definitely hoarse
right now.
Daily: Have you had any train
ing for it?
Richie: I went to a person, and
actually took a lesson, but I
couldn't handle it. I'm gonna
try to get the breathing down,
because I think that'll help. But
as for EEAAOORRR (he breaks
into a quick aria). . .
Daily: Are there any more of
the old Buffalo Springfield
tunes in the can somewhere
waiting to be released?
Richie: Atlantic has them all.
They have the rights to release
them. I'm sure that Stephen
and Neil would probably have
fits over some of the stuff if
they did.
Daily: Is it good?
Richie: Whether it was good or
bad, it's something we did
then. There would be no pur
pose in putting it out. The
memory that you have of the
Springfield ought to last.
Daily: How does it ... A lot of
these guys you've played with
have gone on to be giant

names, and you're not a giant
name. I don't know how to tell
you this, Richie. I mean, you're
doing interviews with the Stan
ford Daily (long pause).
Richie: Hey man, talk to me.
Daily: Do you want to be a giant
name?
Richie: Let me put it this way. I
think a few years ago I might
have had more of a problem
dealing with that than I do
now, 'cause I know what I am,
and I know what I do, and I
know what I do is good. It's as
good as any of it that's going
down. It hasn't been accepted
on a mass scale, and for what
reason — hey, I don't know

why. Believe me, Poco could
have stood up with every single
band, bar none, and done their
business and taken care of it.
When you make a record,
when you create something
that comes from inside of you
and put it on that little piece of
plastic and ship it out, you re
ally want a lot of people to
enjoy it. You're really giving
something from inside, no
matter what you call it.
Whether you call it middle of
the road, hard rock, metal
rock, country rock, jazz rock,
dumb rock — it's a part of your
life, and you do the best you
can. I wouldn't trade my life for

any or anything that any of the
other guys have done. Now I'm
really close with Jimmy. Years
ago, we talked about what we
wanted to get out of life. Now
it's real strange. He took a
piece of it, and I've got the
other piece. He became very
successful in the eyes of the
people, he's very wealthy and
he'» really well off. I, on thfe
other hand, have my family,
and to me that's more impor
tant. I mean, hey look. What
more can I ask for? I've got
food on the table. I've got
good, good friends. I've got a
wife and three kids that I love
and that love me. If the rest of

that comes — outasite. I'll deal
with that when it comes. And
I've dealt with a lot of it over
the years. And that's why I say
Jimmy and I are real close.
We've seen our dream and we
both have a piece of it. I mean,
he loves my family . . . but he
hasn't been able to get that
type of thing together. He will.
I guarantee you he will. But I
wouldn't trade for any of what
Stephen or Neil or Jimmy have.
Those guys deserve everything
that they've got. They're
talented people, I don't want
to sound like I'm trying to take
anything away from them.
Richie Furay has been
around a long time. As the
legend goes, he and Stephen
Stills were driving down Sunset
Boulevard in 7966 when they
noticed a hearse being driven
by an old acquaintance from
the New York City club scene:
Neil Young. The three became
the nucleus of the Buffalo
Springfield, arguably one of
the best rock and roll bands
America produced in the six
ties. Since the Springfield
broke up in 1966, Furay has had
various degrees of success and
non-success with Poco, the
Souther, Hillman, Furay Band

and two solo albums, the latest
of which is the recently re
leased "Dance a Little Light."
Furay laughs easily and of
ten, and doesn't mind taking
the time to chat with his fans, a
hard core group of whom sang
Happy Birthday when he took
the stage for a recent perfor
mance at the Old Waldorf in
San Francisco, despite the fact
that his birthday had been nine
days earlier. Fie thanked them
with just what they had been
waiting for: a closing, eight
song medley of Buffalo
Springfield and Poco material.
The following is taken from an

interview conducted between
sets.
Daily: I just want to tell you
ahead of time, if I start asking
any questions you're really sick
of, like about Neil Young
hearse stories . . .(a man walks
up and introduces a young
couple).
Man: I'm sorry to interrupt fora
second, but I want you to meet
a couple people. Teri, this is
Richie.
Teri: Hi.

them. I'm sure that Stephen
and Neil would probably have
fits over some of the stuff if
they did.
Daily: Is it good?
Richie: Whether it was good or
bad, it's something we did
then. There would be no pur
pose in putting it out. The
memory that you have of the
Springfield ought to last.
Daily: How does it ... A lot of
these guys you've played with
have gone on to be giant

names, and you're not a giant
name. I don't know how to tell
you this, Richie. I mean, you're
doing interviews with the Stan
ford Daily (long pause).
Richie: Hey man, talk to me.
Daily: Do you want to be a giant
name?
Richie: Let me put it this way. I
think a few years ago I might
have had more of a problem
dealing with that than I do
now, 'cause I know what I am,
and I know what I do, and I
know what I do is good. It's as
good as any of it that's going
down. It hasn't been accepted
on a mass scale, and for what
reason — hey, I don't know

why. Believe me, Poco could
have stood up with every single
band, bar none, and done their
business and taken care of it.
When you make a record,
when you create something
that comes from inside of you
and put it on that little piece of
plastic and ship it out, you re
ally want a lot of people to
enjoy it. You're really giving
something from inside, no
matter what you call it.
Whether you call it middle of
the road, hard rock, metal
rock, country rock, jazz rock,
dumb rock — it's a part of your
life, and you do the best you
can. I wouldn't trade my life for

any or anything that any of the
other guys have done. Now I'm
really close with Jimmy. Years
ago, we talked about what we
wanted to get out of life. Now
it's real strange. He took a
piece of it, and I've got the
other piece. He became very
successful in the eyes of the
people, he's very wealthy and
he'» really well off. I, on thfe
other hand, have my family,
and to me that's more impor
tant. I mean, hey look. What
more can I ask for? I've got
food on the table. I've got
good, good friends. I've got a
wife and three kids that I love
and that love me. If the rest of

that comes — outasite. I'll deal
with that when it comes. And
I've dealt with a lot of it over
the years. And that's why I say
Jimmy and I are real close.
We've seen our dream and we
both have a piece of it. I mean,
he loves my family . . . but he
hasn't been able to get that
type of thing together. He will.
I guarantee you he will. But I
wouldn't trade for any of what
Stephen or Neil or Jimmy have.
Those guys deserve everything
that they've got. They're
talented people, I don't want
to sound like I'm trying to take
anything away from them.
