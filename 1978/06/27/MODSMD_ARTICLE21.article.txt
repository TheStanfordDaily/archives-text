## 'Omen II' lacks oomph 
### 
"Damien — The Omen, Part
II," Sequel to "The Omen" and
precursor of Cod knows what.
When analyzing this film we
must at all times keep in mind
the arch-paradigm/conundrum
of the horror/terror genre, as it
is posited therein the Godzilla,
despite his massive size and
malefic demeanor, his baleful
countenance and awesome
plentitude; Godzilla the giant
monster-thing must never de
stroy plastic tanks. If Godzilla
(or Mothra for that matter, or
Kronos or Wife of Kong, all of
whom are both terrorriffic and
screamomatic); if Godzilla
wastes his or her (never
specified—probably neuter, like
the Tin Man) precious time de
stroying plastic tanks, than
he/she will naturally have in
sufficient time to destroy To
kyo, which is what everyone
came to see. In "Damien —
The Omen, II" we have a
high-magnitude violation of
the aforementioned prime di
rective, and accordingly the
picture lacks cinemomendous
oomph.
Murderous diddling
We are dealing, you re
member, with nothing less
than the anti-celestial counter
part of Mick Jagger himself,
that master of ocean and earth
and skies we call Satan (SATAN

'We are cheated of form and dissembling nature,
and we wonder why the Devil has not proven
himself a villain/

— his name is legion). Satan is
played by Jonathan Scott-
Taylor (13 years old, and dis
turbingly acne-less); in the
course of the picture he goes
to military school and diddles
murderously with a handful of
co-stars (not Gregory Peck
though — his diddle came up
at the end of the first episode).
In "-II" the evil and acne-less
one has been sent to live with
William Holden and his lovely
(or so you think, but little do

you know) wife Lee Grant. Wil
liam Holden, of course, is Pres
ident of Thorrf Industries,
which just so happens to be the
worlds' largest multi
congolermate producer of

. . but they were merely murders, and we came
to see the Devil.'

high-quality famine-connected
foodstuffs. In "Damien — The
Omen, II" Damien ominously
rises in the corporate infras
tructure of Thorn Industries,
until at the end we find him
standing outside a building
with large pillars and scary art
objects, having successfully
omenized all impediments. He
stares provocatively into the
distance in that shot, presum
ably at the marquee of the the
ater in Chicago that will soon
announce the opening of "I,
Damien — The Omen, Part
Twelve."
Not enough gore
And yet we in the audience
are not shaped by sportive
tricks. We are cheated of form
and dissembling nature, and
we wonder why the Devil has
not proven himself a villian.
Truely, he has made an hors
d'ouvre of a suspecting physi
cian, and gleefully squished an
investigative reporter with a

hurtling mack truck, but they
were merely murders, and we
came to see the Devil. Christ is
rarely even mentioned, much
less Tokyo, and it seems
throughout the picture that the
Devil is wasting his time, and
ours.
After two hours we have
tired of these one-at-a-time
eliminations, and it becomes
necessary for young Damien to
really flex for awhile, and take
on a Scout Troop or two. As it

stands, he seems dumb, and as
anyone who has ever seen
Garner Ted Armstrong's
"Amazing Bible Prophecy"
hour can tell you, this is not the
case. Nobody expects the devil

to be threatened by the mere
president and lovely wife (or so
you think) of Thorn Industries,
and when he does have trou
ble, we naturally are puzzled.
"Omen II" spends most of its
time squashing plastic tanks,
and it never once breathes fire.
It diddles, and it is a boring
movie.
I can't wait for the sequel.

throughout the picture that the
Devil is wasting his time, and
ours.
After two hours we have
tired of these one-at-a-time
eliminations, and it becomes
necessary for young Damien to
really flex for awhile, and take
on a Scout Troop or two. As it

stands, he seems dumb, and as
anyone who has ever seen
Garner Ted Armstrong's
"Amazing Bible Prophecy"
hour can tell you, this is not the
case. Nobody expects the devil

to be threatened by the mere
president and lovely wife (or so
you think) of Thorn Industries,
and when he does have trou
ble, we naturally are puzzled.
"Omen II" spends most of its
time squashing plastic tanks,
and it never once breathes fire.
It diddles, and it is a boring
movie.
I can't wait for the sequel.
