Are you ready to be a star?
Even if you're not, hop on

Wednesday or Thursday night

the three one-act plays director

Mendelson, who received
his doctorate in drama here
this year and is currently assis
tant professor and stage direc
tor in the Professional Theater
Program at the University of
Michigan, is putting on "Crawl
ing Arnold," by Jules Pfeiffer, a
play "set in the early '60s about
anxiety and identity and
psychiatric social workers,"
which Mendelson also de
scribes as "very funny."
There is also a one-act play
by Terrence McNally called
"Noon," about "five different
people who answer sex ads in a
paper." They include "one an
xious college student, one lib
erated gay, one Scarsdale
housewife and one middle
aged couple from Long Island
who are into leather." Mendel

son describes this one as ' the
quest for the ultimate experi
ence."
The last one-act play is enti
tled "Adaptation" and was
written by Elaine May. The play
depicts "life as a game show,
from birth to death a vain pur
suit for the security
square. . ." Need we say
more?
Mendelson stresses that get
ting involved with the play(s) is
only a two-and-a-half week
committment, since the per
formances will be July 20-22.
Anyone interested? Show up at
Branner Dining Hall and show

So you've always wanted to
play the piano. But you think
you have to be seven to start
taking lessons, or that you have
to have a piano at home to

staff and community — that is,
almost everybody. You can't

credit, but you can pay $65 and

week.
The course begins on July 5
and ends on August 11, and will

vided (there will be five to ten
students in the class), and
there will be no seven-year
olds.
Allen is a candidate for the
Doctor of Musical Arts degree
here. She completed her Mas
ters degree at the University of
Michigan after obtaining her
B.A. here also. Any questions
about the class? Call her at
327-1066 or 497-3811.
