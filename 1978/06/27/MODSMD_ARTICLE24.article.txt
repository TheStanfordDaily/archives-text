# Land sale delayed for third time

### Joel Dickholtz 
The controversial sale of 694
acres of Stanford land has been
postponed until the end of
September, according to Wil
liam Massy, vice president for
business and finance. This is
the third time escrow has been
extended.
The extension was granted at
the June 14 board meeting of
the Midpeninsula Regional
Open Space District, the pros
pective buyers of the land,
known as Black Mountain
Ranch. Massy requested that
the date of excrow be delayed
until September 29, so that a
"written valuation analysis" of
the land could be prepared and
additional language could be
inserted into the agreement,
according to the minutes of the
meeting.
According to Massy, addi
tional information must be
added to the contract to clarify
the wishes of the donor of the
land, trustee emeritus George
Morell, who had requested
that the land remain unde
veloped. Originally there were
legal restraints on the deeds to
the land, but rhey were re
moved by Morell in 1972.
That the land was to remain
undeveloped was an assumed
fact, until Stanford alumnus
Harry Aine, a Palo Alto attor
ney, questioned the $475,000
sale price of the land, which
amounted to $664 per acre.
Aine said that this selling
price would be $1.5 million
below fair market value, which

he placed at over $2 million.
The decreased value of the
land, however, has been attri
buted by both parties to the
sale to the fact that it was not to
be developed, a requirement
left out of the original contract.
Herbert Crench, Chairman
of the Board of the Open Space
District, said that the non
development of the land was
"so obvious" that it was never
written into the original ag
reement. "The value is depen
dent on what can be done with
the land . . . and we specifi
cally preserve undeveloped
land, rather than develop it."
According to Aine the fact
that the donor dropped legal
restrictions on the land in 1972,
which coincided with the
changed zoning of the land,
indicated that he was satisfied
with development along the
new zoning lines.
Aine said that the zoning was
changed from allowing one re
sidence per acre to allowing
only one residence per 10
acres.
Massy explained that Stan
ford was operating according
to Morell's wishes, rather than
simply following the few re
strictions on the selling price of
the land.
Massy added that "with re
spect to the questions raised,
the extension was the best
thing to do." Three months
was necessary, he said, be
cause the Stanford trustees do
not meet until September.
