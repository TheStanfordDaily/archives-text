McNally resigns
James McNally, the Stanford Hospital director
of facilities recently audited by the University
and sued by former employees, has resigned.
McNally, whose resignation is effective June
30, said that "it seems an appropriate time to
submit my resignation after achieving one of my
major goals" in organizing the facilities depart
ment.
University administrators will not comment
on McNally's decision, or on the events that
preceeded it, as they felt that it would not be
appropriate in light of the pending court case.
McNally was charged last March by former
employees of the facilities department with
using University property and personnel for
personal purposes. Three other administrators
facing similar charges were cleared by auditors,
but the results of an examination of McNally's
department were never released.
Former hospital employees Frank Petta and
current employee Conroe McGee have sub
sequently asked for $2.4 million in damages.
EPA okays SRI
The United States Environmental Protection
Agency has completed its investigation of ac
cusations by a former SRI employee to the effect
that that agency falsified research results ob

tained during a chemical testing project per
formed for Shell Chemical about 10 years ago.
EPA has stated that "current laboratory practices
and procedures utilized for toxicology testing at
SRI are exemplary and lead to scientific conclu
sions which are reliable."
Volker Fund settled
The Hoover Institution will receive approxi
mately $7 million from the William Volker Fund
under the term of a plan of distribution ap
proved recently by a Circuit Court Judge in Kan
sas City.
The decision apparently settles a dispute
begun in September of 1977, when Missouri At
torney General John Ashcroft obtained a tem
porary restraining order preventing the Fund's
proposed distribution of the major portion of its
assets to the Hoover Institution and $2 million to
28 Kansas City charities. Ashcroft had argued
that the dominant intent of the Fund's creator
was to benefit local charities.
