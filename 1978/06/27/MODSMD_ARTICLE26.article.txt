# Hospital nurses may strike
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Registered nurses at Stanford Hospital have
confirmed their intention to strike at 6:45 a.m.
July 2 if the terms of a new contract under
negotiation have not been settled by then.
The announcement was made last Friday by
CRONA (the Committee for Recognition of
Nursing Achievements), the professional or
ganization which represents the approximately
900 registered nurses in non-supervisory posi
tions at the hospital.
A joint statement issued Friday by the Hospital
and CRONA emphasized, "the Hospital is con
tinuing to provide full services to the commun
ity and both the Hospital and CRONA have
pledged their best efforts to successfully com
plete negotiations before the July 2 deadline."
"We don't believe there will be a strike," Gary
Mecklenberg, Deputy Director of the Hospital,
said yesterday. Mecklenberg declined to com
ment further, as did Director of Personnel
Ronald Twomey, who cited the agreement made
"early on in the game" that neither side would
comment on the contract negotiations except in
the form of a joint statement.
Chief CRONA negotiator and officer Linda
Simpson was unavailable for comment.
Negotiations on a new contract between the
hospital and CRONA began April 25. The current
agreement expires June 30. Issues still under
negotiation include salaries, the number of days
off with pay, promotion and grievance proce
dures, the institution of mandatory CRONA
dues or a service charge for all registered
nurses, understaffing, poor communication be
tween administration and nurses and adequate
and safe parking for night staff, according to
CRONA member Kathleen Barnett.
The nurses vote Thursday on the contract and
whether or not to go on strike. A strike commit
tee has already been set up and funds set aside,
according to Barnett. A series of preliminary

meetings has indicated a strong consensus
among CRONA members over the outstanding
issues, she said.
Hospital administrators declined to comment
on what effect a strike of registered nurses
would have on hospital services. In the last
CRONA-led nurses strike four years ago, an
11-day action in July, 1974, the 618 bed hospital
reduced its patient load from over 500 to a low of
72. Hoover pavillion and the pediatrics ward
were closed with all non-critically ill patients
being transferred to other local hospitals. All
elective surgery was cancelled and all prospec
tive patients who were not in need of immediate
emergency care were redirected to other nearby
hospitals. Nurses meanwhile provided minimal
coverage for critical care areas.
Barnett said an important factor behind
CRONA's decision to provide the 10 days notifi
cation legally required before a strike was the
feeling of dissatisfaction among nurses as to the
handling of negotiations by the Hospital. The
negotiations process has been a "random-type
thing"; no negotiations for this week were set
up until last Friday, Barnett said. Nurses are also
unhappy that salaries and retirement programs
were not discussed until almost a month into the
negotiations, she said.
Issues that remain unresolved thus far in
negotiations include several of considerable
importance to the nurses. The salaries of all four
levels of nurses at Stanford Hospital are un
iformly below those of nurses in most Bay Area
hospitals, who belong to the California Nurses
Association, Barnett said.
Another important issue is that of "agency
shop" â€” CRONA wants to institute a mandatory
service charge for all registered nurses, on the
grounds that all nurses derive benefit from
CRONA, said Barnett. The hospital opposes
this, as if a nurse refused to pay, she would have
to be fired.
