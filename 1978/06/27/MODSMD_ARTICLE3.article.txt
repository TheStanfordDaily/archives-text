# Prop. 13 cutbacks don't phase Norris

All of Palo Alto's scheduled summer school programs were
cancelled when Proposition 13 passed, but that didn't stop
Jane Norris. She set about to organize a summer program
anyway, one that would be held in the Escondido school
buildings vacated in an effort to save money, and today she
begins the second day of registering students for summer
classes.
A Doctoral candidate in hearing and speech sciences here as
well as a part-time worker in the Neurology department at the
Stanford hospital, Norris plans to get a program started that
would operate on a "fee basis.
"I'd noticed that schools in Cupertino and Los Altos were
starting programs in which the parents paid a fee for the child
to go to school," she said, "and I'd seen that these groups had
arranged to have the use of the school buildings. That's essen
tially what I've done here. We can handle up to 400, but we
really don't know how many will enroll — it will cost $60 for a
four hour session from 8:30 a.m. until 12:15."
Norris has had little trouble finding people who are willing
to run the new program. Harold Jones, the regular principal at
Escondido School, has been hired as the adr* . . •»rator, and
teachers have been anxious for the chance to 'iv jme work.
"They had scheduled 200 teaching jobs in the area this sum
mer," she says."I can tell you that they've been calling in every
day hoping to get hired."
Insurance was the biggest problem Norris had to deal with.
"The school board requires a half milliondollar personal liabil
ity policy in order to use the building, and they were not
willing to let us use their insurance. The cost of such coverage
was $500, and we now have it, but that was definitely a large
problem,"
With Nixon Elementary, Escondido is the primary servicer of
Stanford community children — two of the first ones enrolled
for this term were Norris' own. "I raise these kids by myself,"
she says,"and I had planned on having them rcupied for that
block of time. If enough people show up to register (today,
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.)
the Escondido school should be functional by Thursday."
That would no doubt please Norris, who would then get
back to her work. After all, she says,"I don't know anything
about running a school. That's why we hired an adminis
trator."
