The newspaper you hold in your hands will continue publica
tion this summer on a semiweekly basis (Tuesdays and Fridays)
through August 18, with the exception of July 4 when we will not
publish.
The Daily is a studerit-owned and student-run corporation and
for that reason we urge all members of the Stanford community
this summer who are interested in working for the Daily to stop
by the office in Storke Publications Building (across Lomita Mall
from Terman Engineering Center). We need writers, photo
graphers, persons interested in layout and anyone who thinks he
or she might be able to add something to the paper. You don't
have to be a communication major— only interested enough in
journalism to work hard and be fair and accurate.
And, of course, everyone is invited to submit letters to the
editor on whatever topic interests them. All we ask is that the
letters be typed on a double-spaced, 57-character line. Please
confine your letters to no more than 30 lines. The Daily reserves
the right to edit all submitted material for clarity, brevity and style
and cannot guarantee its return.
Finally, if you have any questions or complaints about any
aspect of the Daily's general news policy or its coverage of a
particular event, please do not hesitate to stop by the office or to
call me at 497-4632. Thank you and pleasant reading this summer.
