Yeh and Sun

We are deeply enraged and
disturbed by the Daily's report
on the May 20th melee in
Chinatown. We cannot im
agine how an act of rescue and
self-defense can be singularly
portrayed as a mere violent
street fight. Equally, we are
shocked that a melee initiated
by some Chinatown hoodlums
and radical Hong Kong stu
dents were described as a fight
between two groups from
Taiwan. Indeed, this biased
and considerably distorted re
port by the Daily not only de
rogates the University and its
fine traditions and the indi
viduals accused, it also af
fected our preparation for the
finals, and affronted the dig
nity of those of us from Free
China. Here we would like to
tell it as it was. This is what
happened in Chinatown on
May 20.
On that day about 30 Stan
ford students from Taiwan
were attending a cocktail party
to celebrate the inauguration
of the new Taiwanese presi
dent. Some 200 guests includ
ing Chinese students from Bay
Area schools and colleges, and
local Chinese leaders joined in
the celebration at about 2 p.m.
When we arrived at the party,
we saw a crowd of some 50
people in the vicinity (it was in

correctly reported as 200 to 300
people) wearing red
armbands, and carrying two
inch square wooden rods.
These people were waving red
flags, chanting slogans of "lib
erate Taiwan" and demonstrat
ing at the premises where the
party was being held. (We sub
sequently learned that they
had not obtained permission
from the proper city au
thorities.) Suddenly and omin
ously, they began to march to
ward the premises.
At that time, an old Chinese
gentleman (about 60 years old)
among the guests invited at
tempted to take down an effigy
of the newly elected Taiwanese
president from the hands of a
demonstrator. He was vio
lently struck to the ground by
the demonstrator. Seeing this,
another party guest who had
only just arrived at the scene in
his car, immediately got out of
it to rescue the poor old man.
In trying to stop him, the de
monstrator hit him over the
head repeatedly with a
wooden rod. Blood began to
spurt from gashes on his head.
Standing close to the vic
timized "good smaritan," we
were next in line to receive a
savage beating. At the same
time, we also felt it was our
duty as human beings to try to

save this man. The only way,
and the safest way we knew
how then to help him and de
fend ourselves was to keep the
violent demonstrators in
abeyance by waving the flag
poles in our hands after the
flags had been torn off. After
the "good smaritan" was re
scued, he went straight to the
hospital where he received
seven stitches. It took him two
weeks to recover his wounds.
Since we were all dressed up
for the occasion and our mobil
ity was seriously impaired, we
also were hit and bruised (in
various parts of our body) dur
ing the ensuing scuffle.
One significant fact was
omitted from the Daily's re
port. At the scene of violence,
we saw a number of Stanford
students and spouses from
Hong Kong mingling among
the demonstrators and assist
ing them. Of these two stood
out prominently: Fred Wu,
former secretary of the
Chinese Student Associations
(CSA), and a graduate student,
and Yvonne, Woo, wife of
Louis Woo who is the cultural
chair-person of CSA. We did
not see any Stanford students
from Taiwan among the de
monstrators.
It is noteworthy that the de
monstrators not only precipi

tated the incident by marching
to the inaugural party, they
also had photographers on
hand to record the incident.
The photograph that appeared
in the Daily as well as other
photographs that appeared in
San Francisco newspapers
make it appear that we were
the aggressors, when in fact,
the demonstrators were the
ones to start the melee.
Also, Yeh disconnected his
telephone because he was in
the process of moving. The
Daily mentioned the discon
nection without explanation,
probably giving people a
wrong impression.
At this point we are re
minded of the incident of al
leged "spying" among Taiwan
students as reported by the
Daily in a like fashion about the
same time last year. In both
cases, the Daily printed a story
which was (deliberately or,
hopefully, unintentionally)
misleading, callous and in
adequately researched.
Moreover, each article had
been done the eve before the
last issue of the Daily; and in
dividuals accused, naturally,
were not given a meaningful
opportunity to get the records
straight. Whatever the motive
behind this hit-and-run
guerilla tactic, the repercus-

sions, unfortunately, have
been far-reaching.
In essence, it has really
created an "atmosphere of
suspicion and fear" among the
Taiwan students themselves
which the Daily was seemingly
speaking against. Worst of all,
it also generated suspicion and
doubt of Taiwan students
among their American friends.
The cumulative effects, thus,
are extremely damaging to
their studies and general
well-being. We sincerely hope
that the Daily, and students as
well as officials of the Univer
sity would review the entire in
cident with the objectivity and
understanding that it rightly
deserves.

Editor's note: The Daily stands
by its story of June 7. The story
was not published until that
date because we did not pos
sess enough concrete informa
tion before then to print the
story without callously disre
garding the truth. Last year's
three-part series on alleged
spying among Taiwanese stu
dents here was published April
27-29, giving the "individuals
accused" ample time to reply
before the end of the volume.

viduals accused, it also af
fected our preparation for the
finals, and affronted the dig
nity of those of us from Free
China. Here we would like to
tell it as it was. This is what
happened in Chinatown on
May 20.
On that day about 30 Stan
ford students from Taiwan
were attending a cocktail party
to celebrate the inauguration
of the new Taiwanese presi
dent. Some 200 guests includ
ing Chinese students from Bay
Area schools and colleges, and
local Chinese leaders joined in
the celebration at about 2 p.m.
When we arrived at the party,
we saw a crowd of some 50
people in the vicinity (it was in

correctly reported as 200 to 300
people) wearing red
armbands, and carrying two
inch square wooden rods.
These people were waving red
flags, chanting slogans of "lib
erate Taiwan" and demonstrat
ing at the premises where the
party was being held. (We sub
sequently learned that they
had not obtained permission
from the proper city au
thorities.) Suddenly and omin
ously, they began to march to
ward the premises.
At that time, an old Chinese
gentleman (about 60 years old)
among the guests invited at
tempted to take down an effigy
of the newly elected Taiwanese
president from the hands of a
demonstrator. He was vio
lently struck to the ground by
the demonstrator. Seeing this,
another party guest who had
only just arrived at the scene in
his car, immediately got out of
it to rescue the poor old man.
In trying to stop him, the de
monstrator hit him over the
head repeatedly with a
wooden rod. Blood began to
spurt from gashes on his head.
Standing close to the vic
timized "good smaritan," we
were next in line to receive a
savage beating. At the same
time, we also felt it was our
duty as human beings to try to

save this man. The only way,
and the safest way we knew
how then to help him and de
fend ourselves was to keep the
violent demonstrators in
abeyance by waving the flag
poles in our hands after the
flags had been torn off. After
the "good smaritan" was re
scued, he went straight to the
hospital where he received
seven stitches. It took him two
weeks to recover his wounds.
Since we were all dressed up
for the occasion and our mobil
ity was seriously impaired, we
also were hit and bruised (in
various parts of our body) dur
ing the ensuing scuffle.
One significant fact was
omitted from the Daily's re
port. At the scene of violence,
we saw a number of Stanford
students and spouses from
Hong Kong mingling among
the demonstrators and assist
ing them. Of these two stood
out prominently: Fred Wu,
former secretary of the
Chinese Student Associations
(CSA), and a graduate student,
and Yvonne, Woo, wife of
Louis Woo who is the cultural
chair-person of CSA. We did
not see any Stanford students
from Taiwan among the de
monstrators.
It is noteworthy that the de
monstrators not only precipi

tated the incident by marching
to the inaugural party, they
also had photographers on
hand to record the incident.
The photograph that appeared
in the Daily as well as other
photographs that appeared in
San Francisco newspapers
make it appear that we were
the aggressors, when in fact,
the demonstrators were the
ones to start the melee.
Also, Yeh disconnected his
telephone because he was in
the process of moving. The
Daily mentioned the discon
nection without explanation,
probably giving people a
wrong impression.
At this point we are re
minded of the incident of al
leged "spying" among Taiwan
students as reported by the
Daily in a like fashion about the
same time last year. In both
cases, the Daily printed a story
which was (deliberately or,
hopefully, unintentionally)
misleading, callous and in
adequately researched.
Moreover, each article had
been done the eve before the
last issue of the Daily; and in
dividuals accused, naturally,
were not given a meaningful
opportunity to get the records
straight. Whatever the motive
behind this hit-and-run
guerilla tactic, the repercus-

sions, unfortunately, have
been far-reaching.
In essence, it has really
created an "atmosphere of
suspicion and fear" among the
Taiwan students themselves
which the Daily was seemingly
speaking against. Worst of all,
it also generated suspicion and
doubt of Taiwan students
among their American friends.
The cumulative effects, thus,
are extremely damaging to
their studies and general
well-being. We sincerely hope
that the Daily, and students as
well as officials of the Univer
sity would review the entire in
cident with the objectivity and
understanding that it rightly
deserves.

Editor's note: The Daily stands
by its story of June 7. The story
was not published until that
date because we did not pos
sess enough concrete informa
tion before then to print the
story without callously disre
garding the truth. Last year's
three-part series on alleged
spying among Taiwanese stu
dents here was published April
27-29, giving the "individuals
accused" ample time to reply
before the end of the volume.
The "atmosphere of suspicion
and fear" among Taiwanese
students to which Yeh and Sun
refer exists we believe not
without reason.

We are deeply enraged and
disturbed by the Daily's report
on the May 20th melee in
Chinatown. We cannot im
agine how an act of rescue and
self-defense can be singularly
portrayed as a mere violent
street fight. Equally, we are
shocked that a melee initiated
by some Chinatown hoodlums
and radical Hong Kong stu
dents were described as a fight
between two groups from
Taiwan. Indeed, this biased
and considerably distorted re
port by the Daily not only de
rogates the University and its
fine traditions and the indi
viduals accused, it also af
fected our preparation for the
finals, and affronted the dig
nity of those of us from Free
