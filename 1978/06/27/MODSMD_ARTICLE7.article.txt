# Time running short for ERA
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — With time
in the legislative season run
ning short, backers of the
Equal Rights Amendment are
looking for one, elusive state
victory to boost their chances
of winning ratification by a
March 22, 1979, deadline.
"Frankly, I think if we could
get one state, the momentum
would build again and it
wouldn't be difficult to get two
others," Nancy Neuman, a vice
president of the League of
Women Voters, said in an in
terview.

But opponents claimed they
could hold on to the votes of
opposition state legislators
long enough to defeat the
amendment.
"I think the momentum is
going strongly against the
ERA," said Phyllis Schlafly, na
tional chairman of Stop ERA.
"The 15 states which have not
ratified it have rejected it again
and again and again. I see no
indication that the proponents
are gaining votes."
ERA, the proposal Congress
approved in 1972 which would

prohibit discrimination based
on sex, has been ratified by 35
of the 38 states needed if it is to
become a part of the Constitu
tion. But Tennessee, Idaho and
Nebraska have voted to re
scind their approval votes.
The Justice Department has
ruled that Congress must ulti
mately decided if recissionsare
permissable.
Opponents of the proposal
maintain it would erode legal
rights which have been as
signed to women in this society
and would force women into
unacceptable roles.
Backers maintain the
amendment would provide a
constitutional underpinning
for the rights of men as well as
women. They accuse the other
side of using misinformation
and scare tactics in the attempt
to defeat the amendment.
Supporters, who thought
they had that hoped-for state
victory within their grasp, were
disheartened by a fresh defeat
in the Illinois last
week. In the second vote on
the amendment in two weeks,
they came within two votes of
carrying the House.
Illinois is considered crucial
in the strategy aimed at per
suading three more states to
ratify. It is the only northern
industrial state which has not
ratified although the question
has been voted on repeatedly
during the past six years.
Illinois was considered the
state with the best chance of
nudging the ratification
movement forward.
