# Arjay Miller finds profit isn't everything
## 
### Associated Press 
Ten years after running one
of the world's largest firms,
Arjay Miller is chipping away at
one of the cornerstones of big
business — the notion that
profit is everything.
It isn't, and business people
must learn to broaden their
focus to include the concerns
of society, said the 62-year-old
dean of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business. The "big
picture," he said, has got to get
even bigger.
The former Ford Motor Co.
president must be doing a lot
of things right, for under his
leadership Stanford has dis
placed Harvard to become the
nation's top-ranked school in
business education.
Miller, interviewed in his
spacious, simply appointed of
fice, recalled that before he ac
cepted the Stanford post in
1969 he insisted on drastic
changes in the business school
curriculum. He wanted con
cern for the public good to be
blended with the concerns of
business.
Business must be responsive
to the needs of society if it is to
survive, he said. Its leaders,
"must take into account the
impact of their actions on a
broader set than just maximiz
ing their profits. They're doing
it on their own, and some laws
are forcing them to do it. But it
is in their own interest."
"The problems that are fac
ing us today — safety, air pollu
tion, water pollution, urban
problems, housing — you just
can't get at them in a single
segment. They're interrelated.
They are what you call 'public
goods.' They aren't amenable
to the market place."
As elements that cannot be
packaged and sold, like space
on a highway or clean air, they
fall into the category that de
mands "partnership between
the private and public sec
tors," he said.
"To work on it is why I came
to Stanford — on the precondi
tion that they would let me
change the curriculum."
The Stanford business
school's Public Management
Program grew to such stature
that it drew this orchid from
Robert McNamara, president
of the International Bank for
Construction and Develop
ment:
"Stanford's Public Manage

ment Program would be jus
tified if it did no more than
train 25 candidates per year.
However, its major contribu
tion, I believe, will be to point
the way to Harvard, Yale and
other graduate schools and to
emphasize toour public and its
private and public sector lead
ers the unity of purpose that
should underline the actionsof
all."
Miller believes that the pub
lic and private sectors have for
a long time unknowingly faced
the same problems.
"Government is getting to
be more like business. They

have to deal with scarce re
sources in the public sector as
well as the private sector —
money, land, air, water. . .
And that, he said, is what pri
vate business has done all
along, "dealt with scarce re
sources, and not just money.
Money buys labor and
machinery, and in the case of a
city, police protection and fire
protection. We're in an
economy of scarcity."
Government, he said, must
start acting "like a private busi
ness in their management of
resources, educational re
sources, health resources. I
think that can be learned better
in a business school than it can
be in a public policy school."
Will Arjay Miller, the super
man of the nation's business
schools, ever return to private
business? Don't even ask.
