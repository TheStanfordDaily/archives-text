## Officials optimistic on effect

Bakke has won — but so have
most minority admissions prog
rams in use in America's col
leges and graduate schools," ac
cording to Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther.
Both positive and negative
implications of the Bakke deci
sion were recognized by the
Stanford community following
the Supreme Court's an
nouncement of Allan Bakke's
Wednesday. How Stanford will
be affected by this decision in
terms of both admissions (at the
graduate and undergraduate
levels) and employment is the
question being asked and con
sidered by students, staff and
administrators.
Stanford, along with Colum
bia, Harvard and Pennsylvania
Universities, filed an amicus
curiae brief supporting the
UC-Davis Medical School affir
mative action program.
Nonetheless, administrators
were optimistic about the future
of Stanford's effort.
"While ruling out quotas,
which Stanford has not used, it
apparently allows us to continue
to take the background of stu
dents into account in our at
tempts to bring together a di
verse, but able, student body,
said Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon.

Hargadon said that "while the
decision may bring a certain re
lief to admissions officers for
this reason, we still face an uphill
struggle to increase the number
of students from minority
backgrounds who enter into
higher education and the
mainstream of American life."
As president of the trustees of
the College Entrance Examina
tions Board, Hargadon said, "we
continue to believe that there is
considerable educational merit
in bringing together students of
ability from quite different
backgrounds into the same clas
srooms, dormitories and playing
fields."
He also noted that Stanford's
enrollment of blacks, chicanos,
and native Americans at the un
dergraduate level reached a re
cord high of 760 this year.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said
he feels that "it is more impor
tant than ever to remember that
while all attention has been fo
cused on Allan Bakke, the
broader issue has been the fate
of preferential admissions prog
rams and of affirmative action
generally."
Gunther concurred with the
opinion of Justice Lewis Powell,
saying that "universities can
legitimately strive to increase
the diversity of their student
bodies as an aspect of their First
Amendment academic freedom
rights, so that promoting diver
sity is a compelling interest.
"In short, though Bakke wins,
minority admissions programs
also win."

ident Richard Lyman for chicano

affairs discerned "two central
points of the decision." First,
quotas are inherently dis
criminatory. Second, race may
be taken into account in future
admissions decisions. If news
reports are confirmed, the deci
sion may affect Stanford "very
little," said Baeza.
John Bunzel, president of San
Jose University, who will soon
become a senior research fellow
at Hoover Instituttion, said "the
Supreme Court has now made
clear that affirmative action does
not and may not mean a quota
system.
"The challenge now is how to
make a distinction between the
abhorrent quota and the more
nuanced consideration in ad
missions of a number of factors,
including racial and ethnic
background."
ASSU Senate Chairperson
Fred Grethel was "appalled" but
not really "surprised" by the de
cision. He said, however, that "it
is going to take a lot of time be
fore everything settles down and
we can see the full ramifications

of the decision.
"The lower courts will have an
influential part in determining
the decision's effect. And this
worries me," continued
Crethel. "There are too many
scattered assaults to see what
will come of this decision."
After correspondence with
Lyman, Crethel said he hopes to
know what action Stanford
should take in terms of not only
admissions but also, employ
ment."
Black Media Institute Director
William Stroud said that while
many persons were "shocked"
by the decision, he feels that it
"leaves the door open for affir
mative action."
He explained that Stanford's
affirmative action admissions
program sets goals for minority
enrollment rather than admit
ting minority students on the
basis of strict proportional
quotas.
Hiring quotas are used for
government contract work done
by the University, however,
Stroud said. He added that he
finds this "most reasonable."
