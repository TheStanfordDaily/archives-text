## Officials optimistic on effect

Bakke has won — but so have
most minority admissions prog
rams in use in America's col
leges and graduate schools," ac
cording to Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther.
Both positive and negative
implications of the Bakke deci
sion were recognized by the
Stanford community following
the Supreme Court's an
nouncement of Allan Bakke's
Wednesday. How Stanford will
be affected by this decision in
terms of both admissions (at the
graduate and undergraduate
levels) and employment is the
question being asked and con
sidered by students, staff and
administrators.
Stanford, along with Colum
bia, Harvard and Pennsylvania
Universities, filed an amicus
curiae brief supporting the
UC-Davis Medical School affir
mative action program.
Nonetheless, administrators
were optimistic about the future
of Stanford's effort.
"While ruling out quotas,
which Stanford has not used, it
apparently allows us to continue
to take the background of stu
dents into account in our at
tempts to bring together a di
verse, but able, student body,
said Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon.

Hargadon said that "while the
decision may bring a certain re
lief to admissions officers for
this reason, we still face an uphill
struggle to increase the number
of students from minority
backgrounds who enter into
higher education and the
mainstream of American life."
As president of the trustees of
the College Entrance Examina
tions Board, Hargadon said, "we
continue to believe that there is
considerable educational merit
in bringing together students of
ability from quite different
backgrounds into the same clas
srooms, dormitories and playing
fields."
He also noted that Stanford's
enrollment of blacks, chicanos,
and native Americans at the un
dergraduate level reached a re
cord high of 760 this year.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said
he feels that "it is more impor
tant than ever to remember that
while all attention has been fo
cused on Allan Bakke, the
broader issue has been the fate
of preferential admissions prog
rams and of affirmative action
generally."
Gunther concurred with the
opinion of Justice Lewis Powell,
saying that "universities can
legitimately strive to increase
the diversity of their student
bodies as an aspect of their First
Amendment academic freedom
rights, so that promoting diver
sity is a compelling interest.
"In short, though Bakke wins,
minority admissions programs
also win."
