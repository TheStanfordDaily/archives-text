# Supreme Court of the United States
## Regents of the University of California v. Allan Bakke 
### 
The following are excerpts from the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision on the case of
Regents of the University of California v.
Bakke. The opinions are by Associate Jus-

tices Lewis Powell, William Brennan, lohn
Stevens, Harry Blackmun, Thurgood Mar
shall and Byron White.

By Justice Powell

Mr. Justice Powell announced
the judgment of the Court.
For the reasons stated in the
following opinion, I believe that
so much of the judgment of the
California court as holds
petitioner's special admissions
program unlawful and directs
that respondent be admitted to
the Medical School must be af
firmed. For the reasons expres
sed in a separate opinion, my
brothers The Chief Justice, Mr.
Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Re
linquish and Mr. Justice Stevens
concur in this judgment.
I also conclude for the reasons
stated in the following opinion
that the portion of the court's
judgment enjoining petitioner
from according any considera
tion to race in its admissions
process must be reversed. For
reasons expressed in separate
opinions, my brothers Mr. Jus
tice Brennan, Mr. Justice White,
Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr.
Justice Blackmun concur in this
judgment.
In this Court the parties
neither briefed nor argued the
applicability of Title VI of the
Civil Rights of 1964. Rather, as
had the California court, they
focused exclusively upon the
validity of the special admissions
program under the Equal Protec
tion Clause. Because it was pos
sible, however, that a decision
on Title VI might obviate resort
to constitutional interpretation,
we requested supplementary
briefing on the statutory issue.
At the outset we face the ques
tion whether a right of action for
private parties exists under Title
VI. Respondent argues that
there is a private right of action.
He contends that the statute
creates a Federal right in his
favor, that legislative history re
veals an intent to permit private
actions, that such actions would
further the remedial purposes of
the statute, and that enforce
ment of Federal rights under the
Civil Rights Act generally is not
relegated to the states.
In addition, he cites several
lower court decisions which
have recognized or assumed the
existence of a private right of ac
tion. Petitioner denies the exis
tence of a private right of action.
In its view, administrative cur
tailment of Federal funds under
that section was the only sanc
tion to be imposed upon reci
pients that violated Section 601.
Petitioner also points out that
Title VI contains no explicit grant
of a private right of action, in
contrast to Titles 11, 111, IV, and
VII.
We find it unnecessary to re
solve this question in the instant
case. The question of respon
dent's right to bring an action
under Title VI was neither ar
gued nor decided in either of the
courts below, and this Court has
been hesitant to review ques
tions not addressed below. We
therefore do not address this dif
ficult issue. Similarly, we need
not pass upon petitioner's claim
that private plaintiffs under Title
VI must exhaust administrative
remedies. We assume only for
the purposes of this case that re
spondent has a right of action
under Title VI.
The language of section 601,
like that of the Equal-Protection
Clause, is majestic in its sweep:
No person in the United States
shall, on the ground of race,
color, or national origin, be

excluded from participation in,
be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity re
ceiving Federal financial assis
tance.
The concept of "discrimina
tion," like the phrase "equal
protection of the laws," is sus
ceptible to varying interpreta
tions, for as Mr. Justice Holmes
declared, "(a) word is not a crys
tal, transparent and unchanged,
it is the skin of a living thought
and may vary greatly in colorand
content according to the cir
cumstances and the time in
which it is used." We must,
therefore, seek whatever aid is
available in determining the
precise meaning of the statute
before us.
Examination of the volumin
ous legislative history of Title VI
reveals a congressional intent to
halt federal funding of entities
that violate a prohibition of ra
cial discrimination similartothat
of the Constitution. Although
isolated statements of various
legislators, taken out of context,
can be marshalled in support of
the proposition that section 601
enacted a purely colorblind
scheme, without regard to the
reach of the Equal Protection
Clause, these comments must
be read against the background
of both the problem that Con
gress was addressing and the
broader view of the statute that
emerges from a full examination
of the legislative debates.
The problem confronting
Congress was discrimination
against Negro citizens at the
hands of recipients of federal
moneys. . . . Over and over
again, proponents of the bill de
tailed the plight of Negroes
seeking equal treatment in such
programs. There simply was no
reason for Congress to consider
the validity of hypothetical pre
ferences that might be accorded
minority citizens; the legislators
were dealing with the real and
pressing problem of how to
guarantee those citizens equal
treatment.
In view of the clear legislative
intent, Title VI must be held to
proscribe only those racial clas
sifications that would violate the
Equal Protection Clause or the
Fifth Amendment.
The parties fight a sharp pre
liminary action ovar the proper
characterization of the special
admissions program. Petitioner
prefers to view it as establishing
a "goal" of minority representa
tion in the medical school. Re
spondent, echoing the courts
below, labels it a racial quota.
This semantic distinction is
beside the point: the special
admissions program is undeni
ably a classification based on
race and ethnic background.
The guarantees of the Four
teenth Amendment extend to
persons. Its language is explicit:
"No state shall . . . deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."
The guarantee of equal pro
tection cannot mean one thing
when applied to one individual
and something else when
applied to a person of another
color. If both are not accorded
the same protection, then it is
not equal.
Racial and ethnic distinctions
of any sort are inherently sus
pect and thus call for the most
exacting judicial examination.

If it is the individual who is
entitled to judicial protection
against classifications based
upon his racial or ethnic
background because such dis
tinctions impinge upon personal
rights, rather than the individual
only because of his membership
in a particular group, then con
stitutional standards may be
applied consistently.
Political judgments regarding
the necessity for the particular
classification may be weighed in
the constitutional balance, but
the standard of justification will
remain constant. This is as it
should be, since those political
judgments are the product of
rough compromise struck by
contending groups within the
democratic process.
When they touch upon an in
dividual's race or ethnic
background, he is entitled to a
judicial determination that the
burden he is asked to bear on
that basis is precisely tailored to
serve a compelling governmen
tal interest. The Constitution
guarantees that right to every
person regardless of his
background.
Petitioner contends that on
-several occasions this Court has
approved preferential classifica
tions without applying the most
exacting scrutiny. Most of the
cases upon which petitioner re
lies are drawn from three areas:
school desegregation, employ
ment discrimination, and sex
discrimination. Each of the cases
cited presented a situation
materially different from the
facts of this case.
The school desegregation
cases are inapposite. Each in
volved remedies for clearly de
termined constitutional viola
tions. Racial classifications thus
were designed as remedies for
the vindication of constitutional
entitlement. Moreover, the
scope of the remedies was not
permitted to exceed the extent
of the violations. Here, there
was no judicial determination of
constitutional violation as a pre
dicate for the formulation of a
remedial classification.
The employment discrimina
tion cases also do not advance
petitioner's cause. For example
we approved a retroactive award
of seniority to a class of Negro
truck drivers who had been the
victims of discrimination â€” not
just by society at large, but by
the respondent in that case. . . .
Such preferences also have
been upheld where a legislative
or administrative body charged
with the responsibility made de
terminations of past discrimina
tion by the industries affected,
and fashioned remedies
deemed appropriate to rectify
the discrimination.
But we have never approved
preferential classifications in the
absence of proven constitu
tional or statutory violations.
Nor is petitioner's view as to
the applicable standard sup
ported by the fact that gender
based classifications are not sub
jected to this level of scrutiny.
Gender-based distinctions are
less likely to create the analytical
and practical problems present
in preferential programs pre
mised on racial orethniccriteria.
With respect to gender there
are only two possible classifica
tions. The incidence of the bur
dens imposed by preferential
classifications is clear. There are
no rival groups who can claim
that they, too, are entitled to
preferential treatment.
Classwide questions as to the
group suffering previous injury
and groups which fairly can be
burdened are relatively man
ageable for reviewing courts.
The resolution of these same

questions in the context of racial
and ethnic preferences presents
far more complex and intracta
ble problems than gender-based
classifications. More impor
tantly, the perception of racial
classifications as inherently odi
ous stems from a lengthy and
tragic history that gender-based
classifications do not share. In
sum, the Court has never viewed
such classification as inherently
suspect or as comparable to ra
cial or ethnic classifications for
the purpose of equal-protection
analysis.
We have held that in "order to
justify the use of a suspect clas
sification, a State must show that
its purpose or interest is both
constitutionally permissible and
substantial, and that its use of
the classification is 'necessary
. . . to the accomplishment' of
its purpose or the safeguarding
of its interest."
The special admissions prog
ram purports to serve the pur
poses of: (i) "reducing the his
toric deficit of traditionally dis
favored minorities in medical
schools and the medical profes
sion," Brief for Petitioner 32; (ii)
countering the effects of societal
discrimination; (iii) increasing
the number of physicians who
will practice in communities cur
rently undeserved; and (iv) ob
taining the educational benefits
that flow from an ethnically di
verse student body. It is neces
sary to decide which, if any, of
these purposes is substantial
enough to support the use of a
suspect classification.
If petitioner's purpose is to as
sure within its student body
some specific percentage of a
particular group merely because
of its race or ethnic origin, such a
preferential purpose must be re
jected not as insubstantial but as
facially invalid. Preferring mem
bers of any one group for no
reason other than race or ethnic
origin is discrimination for its
own sake. This the Constitution
forbids.
The State certainly has a
legitimate and substantial in
terest in ameliorating, or
eliminating where feasible, the
disabling effects of identified
discrimination.
We have never approved a
classification that aids persons
perceived as members of rela
tively victimized groups at the
expense of other innocent indi
viduals in the absence of judi
cial, legislative, or administra
tive findings of constitutional or
statutory violations.
Petitioner does not purport to
have made, and is in no position
to make, such findings.
Hence, the purpose of help
ing certain groups whom the fa
culty of the Davis Medical
School perceived as victims of
"societal discrimination" does
not justify a classification that
imposes disadvantages upon
persons like respondent, who
bear no responsibility for what
ever harm the beneficiaries of
the special admissions program
are thought to have suffered.
Petitioner identifies, as
another purpose of its program,
improving the delivery of health
care services to communities
currently underserved. It may be
assumed that in some situations
a State's interest in facilitating
the health care of its citizens is
sufficiently compelling to sup
port the use of a suspect classifi
cation. But there is virtually no
evidence in the record indicat
ing that petitioner's special ad
missions program is either
needed or geared to promote
that goal.
The fourth goal asserted by
petitioner is the attainment of a
diverse student body. This

clearly is a constitutionally per
missible goal foran institution of
higher education. Academic
freedom, though not a specifi
cally enumerated constitutional
right, long has been viewed as a
special concern of the First
Amendment. The freedom of a
university to make its own
judgments as to education in
cludes the selection of its stu
dent body.
It may be argued that there is
greater force to these views at
the undergraduate level than in
a medical school where the
training is centered primarily on
professional competency. But
even at the graduate level, our
tradition and experience lend
support to the view that the con
tribution of diversity is substan
tial.
Ethnic diversity, however, is
only one element in a range of
factors a university properly may
consider in attaining the goal of
a heterogeneous student body.
Although a university must have
wide discretion in making the
sensitive judgment as to who
should be admitted, constitu
tional limitations protecting in
dividual rights may not be disre
garded.
Respondent urges â€” and the
courts below have held â€” that
petitioner's dual admissions
program is a racial classification
that impermissibly infringes his
rights under the Fourteenth
Amendment. As the interest of
diversity is compelling in the
context of a university's admis
sions program, the question re
mains whether the program's
racial classification is necessary
to promote this interest.
Petitioner's argument that this
is the only effective means of
serving the interest o1 diversity is
seriously flawed. In a most fun
damental sense the argument
misconceives the nature of the
state interest that would justify
consideration of race or ethnic
background. It is not an interest
in simple ethnic diversity, in
which a specified percentage of
the student body is in effect
guaranteed to be members of
selected ethnic groups, with the
remaining percentage an undif
ferentiated aggregation of stu
dents. The diversity that furthers
a compelling state interest en
compasses a far broader array of
qualifications and characteris
tics of which racial or ethnic ori
gin is but a single though impor
tant element. Petitioner's spe
cial admissions program, fo
cused solely on ethnic diversity,
would hinder rather than further
attainment of genuine diversity.
The experience of other uni
versity admissions programs,
which take race into account in
achieving the educational diver
sity valued by the First Amend
ment, demonstrates that the as
signment of a fixed number of
places to a minority group is not
a necessary means toward that
end. An illuminating example is
found in the Harvard College
program:
In recent years Harvard Col
lege has expanded the concept
of diversity to include students
from disadvantaged economic,
racial and ethnic groups. Harvard
College now recruits not only
Californians or Louisianans but
also blacks and Chicanos and
other minority students.
In practice, this new definition
of diversity has meant that race
has been a factor in some admis
sion decisions. When the Com
mittee on Admissions reviews
the large middle group of applic
ants who are "admissible" and
deemed capable of doing good
work in their courses, the race of
an applicant may tip the balance
in his favor just as geographic
origin or a life spent on a farm
may tip the balance in other can
didates' cases. A farm boy from
Idaho can bring something to
Harvard College that a Bostonian
cannot offer. Similarly, a black
student can usually bring some
thing that a white person cannot
offer.
In Harvard college admissions
the Committee has not set
target-quotas for the number of
blacks, or of musicians, football
players, physicists or Califor
nians to be admitted in a given
years. . . . But that awareness (of
the necessity of including more
than a token number of black
students) does not mean that the
Committee sets the minimum
number of blacks or of people
from west of the Mississippi who
are to be admitted. It means only
that in choosing among
thousands of applicants who are
not only "admissible" academi
cally but have other strong qual
ities, the Committee, with a
number of criteria in mind, pays
some attention to distribution
among many types and
categories of students.
In such an admissions prog
ram, race or ethnic background
may be deemed a "plus" in a
particular applicant's file, yet it
does not insulate the individual
from comparison with all other
candidates for the available
seats.
The file of a particular black
applicant may be examined for
his potential contribution to di
versity without the factor of race
being decisive when compared,
for example, with that of an
applicant identified as an
Italian-American if the latter is
thought to exhibit qualities
more likely to promote henefi- *
cial educational pluralism.
Such qualities could include
exceptional personal talents, un
ique work or service experience,
leadership potential, maturity,
demonstrated compassion, a
history of overcoming disadvan
tage, ability to communicate
with the poor, orother qualifica
tions deemed important.
In short, an admissions prog
ram operated in this way is flexi
ble enough to consider all perti
nent elements of diversity in
light of the particular qualifica
tions of each applicant, and to
place them on the same footing
for consideration, although not
necessarily according them the
same weight. Indeed, the weight
attributed to a particular quality
may vary from year to year de
pending upon the "mix" both of
the student body and the applic
ants for the incoming class.
This kind of program treats
each applicant as an individual in
the admissions process. The
applicant who loses out on the
last available seat to another
candidate receiving a "plus" on
the basis of ethnic background
will not have been foreclosed
from all consideration for that
seat simply because he was not
the right color or had the wrong
surname. It would mean only
that his combined qualifica
tions, which may have included
similar nonobjective factors, did
not outweigh those of the other
applicant. His qualifications
would have been weighed fairly
and competitively, and he would
have no basis to complain of un
equal treatment under the Four
teenth Amendment.
It has been suggested that an
admissions program which con
siders race only as one factor is
simply a subtle and more sophis
ticated â€” but no less effective â€”
means of according racial pre
ference than the Davis program.
A facial intent to discriminate,

however, is evident in
petitioner's preference program
and not denied in this case.
No such facial infirmity exists
in an admissions program where
race or ethnic background is
simply one element â€” to be
weighed fairly against other
elements â€” in the selection pro
cess.
In summary, it is evident that
the Davis special admission
program involves the use of an
explicit racial classification
never before countenanced by
this Court. It tells applicants who
are not Negro, Asian, or
"Chicano" that they are totally
excluded from a specific percen
tage of the seats in an entering
class.

No matter how strong their
qualifications, quantitative and
extracurricular, including their
own potential for contribution
to educational diversity, they are
never afforded the chance to
compete with applicants from
the preferred groups for the
special admission seats. At the
same time, the preferred applic
ants have the opportunity to
compete for every seat in the
class.
The fatal flaw in petitioner's
preferential program is its disre
gard of individual rights as
guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment. Such rights are not
absolute. But when a State's dis
tribution of benefits or imposi
tion of burdens hinges on the

color of a person's skin orances
try, that individual is entitled to a
demonstration that the chal
lenged classification is neces
sary to promote a substantial
state interest.
Petitioner has failed to carry
this burden. Forthis reason, that
portion of the California court's
judgment holding petitioner's
special admissions program in
valid under the Fourteenth
Amendment must be affirmed.
In enjoining petitioner from
ever considering the race of any
applicant, however, the courts
below failed to recognize that
the State has a substantial in
terest that legitimately may be
served by a properly devised
admissions program involving

the competitive consideration of
race and ethnic origin. For this
reason, so much of the Califor
nia court's judgment as enjoins
petitioner from any considera
tion of the race of any applicant
must be reversed.
With respect to respondent's
entitlement to an injunction di
recting his admission to the
Medical School, petitioner has
conceded that it could not carry
its burden of proving that, but
for the existence of its unlawful
special admissions program, re
spondent still would not have
been admitted. Hence, respon
dent is entitled to the injunction,
and that portion of the judgment
must be affirmed.

By justice Brennen

Opinion of Mr. Justice Bren
nan, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Jus
tice Marshall, and Mr. Justice
Blackmun, concurring in the
judgment in part and dissenting.
The Court today, in reversing
in part the judgment of the Sup
reme Court of California, affirms
the constitutional power of Fed
eral and State Government to act
affirmatively to achieve equal
opportunity for all. The difficulty
of the issue presented â€”
whether Government may use
race-conscious programs to red
ress the continuing effects of
past discrimination â€” and the
mature consideration which
each of our Brethren has
brought to it have resulted in
many opinions, no single one
speaking for the Court. But this
should not and must not mask
the central meaning of today's
opinions: Government may take
race into account when it acts
not to demean or insult any ra
cial group, but to remedy disad
vantages cast on minorities by
past racial prejudice, at least
when appropriate findings have
been made by judicial, legisla
tive, or administrative bodies
with competence to act in this
area.
The Chief lustice and our
brothers Stewart, Rehnquist,
and Stevens, have concluded
that Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 prohibits programs
such as that at the Davis Medical
School. On this statutory theory
alone, they would hold that re
spondent Allan Bakke's rights
have been violated and that he
must, therefore, be admitted to
the Medical School. Our brother
Powell, reaching the Constitu
tion, concludes that, although
race may be taken into account
in university admissions, the
particular special admissions
program used by petitioner,
which resulted in the exclusion
of respondent Bakke, was not
shown to be necessary to
achieve petitioner's stated go
als. Accordingly, these Mem
bers of the Court form a majority
of five affirming the judgment of
the Supreme Court of California
insofar as it holds that respon
dent Bakke "is entitled to an
order that he be admitted to the
university."
We agree with Mr. Justice
Powell that, as applied to the
case before us, Title VI goes no
further in prohibiting the use of
race than the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment itself. We also
agree that the effect of the
California Supreme Court's af
firmance of the judgment of the
Superior Court of California
would be to prohibit the Univer
sity from establishing in the fu
ture affirmative action programs
that take race into account.
Since we conclude that the af

firmative admissions program at
the Davis Medical School is con
stitutional, we would reverse the
judgment below in all respects.
Mr. Justice Powell agrees that
some uses of race in university
admissions are permissible and,
therefore, he joins with us to
make five votes reversing the
judgment below insofar as it
prohibits the university from es
tablishing race-conscious prog
rams in the future.
Our Nation was founded on
the principle that "all men are
created equal." Yet candor re
quires acknowledgment that the
Framers of our Constitution, to
forge the Thirteen Colonies into
one Nation, openly com
promised this principle of equal
ity with its antithesis: slavery.
The consequences of this com
promise are well known and
HavÂ« aptly hi'cn called our
"American Dilemma." Still, it is
well to recount how recent the
time has been, if it has yet come,
when the promise of our princi
ples has flowered into the actual
ity of equal opportunity for all
regardless of race or color.
The Fourteenth Amendment,
the embodiment in the Con
stitution of our abiding belief in
human equality, has been the
law of our land for only slightly
more than half its 200 years. And
for half of that half, the Equal
Protection Clause of the
Amendment was largely
moribund so that, as lateas 1927,
Mr. Justice Holmes could sum
upthe importanceof that Clause
by remarking that it was "the last
resort of constitutional argu
ments." Worse than desuetude,
the Clause was early turned
against those whom it was in
tended to set free, condemning
them to a "separate but equal"
status before the law, a status
always separate but seldom
equal.
Not until 1954 â€” only 24 years
ago â€” was this odious doctrine
interred by our decision in
Brown v. Board of Education and
its progeny, which proclaimed
that separate schools and public
facilities of all sorts were inhe
rently unequal and forbidden
under our Constitution. Even
then inequality was not elimi
nated with "all deliberate
speed." Brown v. Board of Edu
cation. In 1968 and again in 1971,
for example, we were forced to
remind school boards of their
obligation to eliminate racial
discrimination root and branch.
And a glance at our docket and at
those of lower courts will show
that even today officially
sanctioned discrimination is not
a thing of the past.
Against the background,
claims that law must be "col
orblind" or that the datum of
race is no longer relevant to pub
lic policy must be seen as aspira

tion rather than as description of
reality. This is not to denigrate
aspiration; for reality rebukes us
that race has too often been
used by those who would stig
matize and oppress minorities.
Yet we cannot â€” and as we
shall demonstrate, need not
under our Constitution or Title
VI, which merely extends the
constraints of the Fourteenth
Amendment to private parties
who receive federal funds â€” let
color blindness become myopia
which masks the reality that
many "created equal" have
been treated within our lifetimes
as inferior both by the law and by
their fellow citizens.
The threshold question we
must decide is whether Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
bars recipients of federal funds
from giving preferential consid
eration to disadvantaged mem
bers of racial minorities as part
of a program designed to enable
such individuals to surmount
obstacles imposed by racial
discrimination.
In our view, Title VI prohibits
only those uses of racial criteria
that would violate the Four
teenth Amendment if employed
by <2 State or its agencies; it does
not bar the preferential treat
ment of racial minorities as a
means of remedying past
societal discrimination to the ex
tent that such action is consis
tent with the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The history of Title VI â€” from
President Kennedy's request
that Congress grant executive
departments and agencies au
thority to cut off federal funds to
programs that discriminate
against Negroes through final
enactment of legislation incor-,
porating his proposals â€” reveals
one fixed purpose: to give the
Executive Branch of Govern
ment clear authority to termi
nate federal funding of private
programs that use race as a
means of disadvantaging
minorities in a manner that
would be prohibited by the
Constitution if engaged in by
government.
This purpose was first expres
sed in President Kennedy's June
19, 1963, message to Congress
proposing the legislation that
subsequently became the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
Respondent's contention that
Congress intended Title VI to
bar affirmative action programs
designed to enable minorities
disadvantaged by the effects of
discrimination to participate in
federally financed programs is
also refuted by an examination
of the type of conduct which
Congress thought it was pro
hibiting by means of Title VI. The
debates reveal that the legisla
tion was motivated primarily by a
desire to eradicate a very
specific evil: federal financial
support of programs which dis
advantaged Negroes by exclud
ing them from participation or

providing them with separate
facilities. Again and again sup
porters of Title VI emphasized
that the purpose of the statute
was to end segregation in feder
ally funded activities and to end
other discriminatory uses of race
disadvantaging Negroes.
The conclusion to be drawn
from the foregoing is clear.
Congress recognized that Neg
roes, in some cases with con
gressional acquiescence, were
being discriminated against in
the administration of programs
and denied the full benefits of
activities receiving federal fi
nancial support. It was aware
that there were many federally
funded programs and institu
tions which discriminated
against minorities in a manner
inconsistent with the standards
of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments but whose ac
tivities might not involve suffi
cient state or federal action so as
to be in violation of these
Amendments.
Moreover, Congress believed
that it was questionable whether
the Executive Branch possessed
legal authority to terminate the
funding of activities on the
ground that they discriminated
racially against Negroes in a
manner violative of the stan
dards contained in the Four
teenth and Fifth Amendments.
Congress' solution was to end
the Government's complicity in
constitutionally forbidden racial
discrimination by providing the
Executive Branch with the au
thority and the obligation to
terminate its financial support of
any activity which employed ra
cial criteria in a manner con
demned by the Constitution.
Of course it might be argued
that the Congress which enacted
Title VI understood the Con
stitution to require strict racial
neutrality or color blindness,
and then enshrined that concept
as a rule of statutory law. Later
interpretation and clarification
of the Constitution to permit
remedial use of race would then
not dislodge Title Vl's prohibi
tion upon race-conscious ac
tion. But there are three compel
ling reasons to reject such an
hypothesis.
First, no decision of this Court
has ever adopted the proposi
tion that the Constitution must
be colorblind.
Second, even if it could be ar
gued in 1964 that the Constitu
tion might conceivably require
color blindness, Congress
surely would not have chosen to
codify such a view unless the
Constitution clearly required
it. . . . It is inconceivable that
Congress intended to encour
age voluntary efforts to elimi
nate the evil of racial discrimina
tion while at the same time for
bidding the voluntary use of
race-conscious remedies to cure
acknowledged or obvious
statutory violations.
Third, the legislative history
shows that Congress specifically
eschewed any static definition of
discrimination in favor of broad
language that could be shaped
by experience, administrative
necessity, and evolving judicial
doctrine.
In sum, Congress' equating of
Title Vl's prohibition with the
commands of the Fifth and Four
teenth Amendments, its refusal
precisely to define that racial
discrimination which it intended
to prohibit, and its expectation
that the statute would be ad
ministered in a flexible manner,
compel the conclusion that
Congress intended the meaning
of the statute's prohibition to
evolve with the interpretation of
the commands of the Constitu
tion. Thus any claim that the use
of racial criteria is barred by the
plain language of the statute
must fail in light of the remedial
purpose of Title VI and its legis
lative history.
The legislative history of this
race-conscious legislation reve
als that it represents a deliberate
attempt to deal with the exces
sive rate of unemployment
among minority citizens and to
encourage the development of
viable minority controlled en
terprises. It was believed that
such a "set-aside" was required
in order to enable minorities,
still "new on the scene" and "re
latively small," to compete with
larger and more established
companies which would always
be successful in underbidding
minority enterprises. What is
most significant about the con
gressional consideration of the
measure is that although the use
of a racial quota or "set-aside"
by a recipient of federal funds
would constitute a direct viola
tion of Title VI if that statute were
read to prohibit race-conscious
action, no mention was made
during the debates in either the
House or the Senate of even the
possibility that the quota provi
sions for minority contractors
might in any way conflict with or
modify Title VI. It is inconceiva
ble that such a purported con
flict would have escaped con
gressional attention through an
inadvertent failure to recognize
the relevance of Title VI.
The assertion of human equal
ity is closely associated with the
proposition that differences in
color or creed, birth or status,
are neither significant nor relev
ant to the way in which persons
should be treated. Nonetheless,
the position that "(o)ur Con
stitution is color-blind," has
never been adopted by this
Court as the proper meaning of
the Equal Protection Clause. In
deed, we have expressly re
jected this proposition on a
number of occasions.
Our cases have always implied
that an "overriding statutory
purpose" could be found that
would justify racial classifica
tions.
We conclude, therefore, that
racial classifications are not per
se invalid under the Fourteenth
Amendment. Accordingly, we
turn to the problem of articulat
ing what our role should be in
reviewing state action that ex
pressly classifies by race.
Unquestionably we have held
that a government practice or
statute which restricts "funda
mental rights" orwhich contains
"suspect classifications" is to be
subjected to "strict scrutiny"
and can be justified only if it
furthers a compelling govern
ment purpose and, even then,
only if no less restrictive alterna
tive is available.
But no fundamental right is in-

By Justice Stevens

Mr. Justice Stevens, with
whom The Chief Justice, Mr. Jus
tice Stewart, and Mr. Justice Re
hnquist join, concurring in the
judgment in part and dissenting
in part.
It is always important at the
outset to focus precisely on the
controversy before the Court. It
is particularly important to do so
in this case because correct
identification of the issues will
determine whether it is neces
sary or appropriate to express
any opinion about the legal
status of any admissions prog
ram other than petitioner's.
This is not a class action. The
controversy is between two
specific litigants. Allan Bakke
challenged petitioner's special
admissions program, claiming
that itdenied him a place in med
ical school because of his race in
violation of the Federal and
California Constitutions and of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. The California Supreme
Court upheld his challenge and
ordered him admitted. If the
state court was correct in its view
that the University's special
program was illegal, and that
Bakke was therefore unlawfully
excluded from the medical
school because of his race, we
should affirm its judgment, re
gardless of our views about the
legality of admissions programs
that are not now before the
Court.
The trial court did not order
the University to admit Bakke
because it concluded that Bakke
had not shown that he would
have been admitted if there had
been no special program. In
stead, it ordered the University
to consider Bakke's application
for admission without regard to
his race or the race of any other
applicant. The order did not in
clude any broad prohibition
against any use of race in the
admissions process; its terms
were clearly limited to the Uni
versity's consideration of Bak
ke's application.
The California Supreme
Court, in a holding that is not
challenged, ruled that the trial
court incorrectly placed the
burden on Bakke of showing
that he would have been admit
ted in the absence of discrimina
tion. The University then con
ceded "that it (could) not meet
the burden of proving that the
special admission program did
not result in Bakke's exclusion."
Accordingly, the California Sup
reme Court directed the trial
court to enter judgment order
ing Bakke's admission. Whether
the judgment of the state court is
affirmed or reversed, in whole
or in part, there is no outstand
ing injunction forbidding any
consideration of racial criteria in
processing applications.
It is therefore perfectly clear
that the question whether race
can ever be used as a factor in an
admissions decision is not an
issue in this case, and that dis
cussion of that issue is inapprop
riate.
In this case, we are presented
with a constitutional question of
undoubted and unusual impor
tance. Since, however, a dis
positive statutory claim was
raised at the very inception of
this case, and squarely decided
in the portion of the trial court
judgment affirmed by the
California Supreme Court, it is
our plain duty to confront it.
Only if petitioner should prevail
on the statutory issue would it

be necessary to decide whether
the University's admissions
program violated the Equal Pro
tection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
Section 601 of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 provides: No person
in the United States shall, on the
ground of race, color, or national
origin, be excluded from partici
pation in, be denied the benefits
of, or be subjected to discrimina
tion under any program or activ
ity receiving Federal financial as
sistance.
The University, through its
special admissions policy,
excluded Bakke from participa
tion in its program of medical
education because of his race.
The University also acknow
ledges that it was, and still is,
receiving federal financial assis
tance. The plain language of the
statute therefore requires affir
mance of the judgment below. A
different result cannot be jus
tified unless that language mis
states the actual intent of the
Congress that enacted the sta
tute or the statute is not en
forceable in a private action.
Neither conclusion is war
ranted.
Petitioner contends that exc
lusion of applicants on the basis
of race does not violate Title VI if
the exclusion carries with it no
racial stigma. No such qualifica
tion or limitation of section 601 's
categorical prohibition of "exc
lusion" is justified by the statute
or its history. The language of
the entire section is perfectly
clear; the words that follow
"excluded from" do not modify
or qualify the explicit outlawing
of any exclusion on the stated

grounds.
The legislative history rein
forces this reading. The only
suggestion that section 601
would allow exclusion of non
minority applicants came from
opponents of the legislation and
then only by way of a discussion
of the meaning of the word "dis
crimination." The opponents
feared that the term "discrimina
tion" would be real as mandat
ing racial quotas and "racially ba
lanced" colleges and univer
sities, and they pressed for a
specific definition of the term in
order to avoid this possibility. In
response, the proponents of the
legislation gave repeated assur
ances that the Act would be
"colorblind" in its application.
It seems clear that the propo
nents of Title VI assumed that
the Constitution itself required a
colorblind standard on the part
of government, but that does
not mean that the legislation
only codifies an existing con
stitutional prohibition. The
statutory prohibition against
discrimination in federally
funded projects contained in
section 601 is more than a simple
paraphrasing of what the Fifth or
Fourteenth Amendment would
require. The Act's proponents
plainly considered Title VI con
sistent with their view of the
Constitution and they sought to
provide an effective weapon to
implement that view. As a distil
lation of what the supporters of
the Act believed the Constitu
tion demanded of State and
Federal Governments, section
601 has independent force, with
language and emphasis in addi
tion to that found in the Con
stitution.
As with other provisions of the,
Civil Rights Act, Congress' ex

pression of its policy to end ra
cial discrimination may inde
pendently proscribe conduct
that the Constitution does not.
However, we need not decide
the congruence â€” or lack of
congruence â€” of the controlling
statute and the Constitution
since the meaning of the Title VI
ban on exclusion is crystal clear:
Race cannot be the basis of
excluding anyone from partici
pation in a federally funded
program.
In short, nothing in the legisla
tive history justifies the conclu
sion that the broad language of
section 601 should not be given
its natural meaning. We aredeal
ing with a distinct statutory pro
hibition, enacted at a particular
time with particular concerns in
mind; neither its language nor
any prior interpretation suggests
that its place in the Civil Rights
Act, even after long debate, is
simply that of a constitutional
appendage. In unmistakable
terms the Act prohibits the exc
lusion of individuals from feder
ally funded programs because of
their race. As succinctly phrased
during the Senate debate, under
Title VI it is not "permissible to
say 'yes' to one person, but to
say 'no' to another person, only
because of the color of his skin."
The University's special ad
missions program violated Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
by excluding Bakke from the
medical school because of his
race. It is therefore our duty to
affirm the judgment ordering
Bakke admitted to the Univer
sity.
Accordingly, I concur in the
Court's judgment insofar as it af
firms the judgment of the Sup
reme Court of California. To the
extent that it purports to do any
thing else, I respectfully dissent.

By Justice White

Separate opinion of Mr. Jus
tice White.
I write separately concerning
the question of whether Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
provides for a private cause of
action. Four Justices are appa
rently of the view that such a pri
vate cause of action exists, and
four Justices assume it for pur
poses of this case. I am unwilling
merely to assume an affirmative
answer. If in fact no private
cause of action exists, this Court
and the lower courts as well are
without jurisdiction to consider
respondent's Title VI claim. Just
as it is inappropriate to address
constitutional issues without de
termining whether statutory
grounds urged before us are
dispositive, it is at least ques
tionable practice to adjudicate a
novel and difficult statutory
issue without first considering
whether we have jurisdiction to
decide it. Consequently, I ad
dress the question of whether
respondent may bring suit
under Title VI.
A private cause of action
under Title VI would, in terms
both of the Civil Rights Act as a
whole and that title, not be
"consistent with the underlying
purposes of the legislative
scheme" and contrary to the
legislative intent.
The role of Title VI was to ter
minate federal financial support
for public and private institu
tions or programs that discrimi
nated on the basis of race. Sec
tion 601 imposed the proscrip
tion that no person, on the
grounds of race, color or na
tional origin, was to be excluded
from or discriminated against
under any program or activity
receiving federal financial assis

tance. But there is no express
provision for private actions to
enforce Title VI, and it would be
quite incredible if Congress,
after so carefully attending to
the matter of private actions in
other titles of the Act, intended
silently to create a private cause
of action to enforce Title VI.
Termination of funding was
regarded by Congress as a seri
ous enforcement step, and the
legislative history is replete with
assurances that it would not
occur until every possibility for
conciliation had been
exhausted. To allow a private in
dividual to sue to cut off funds
under Title VI would com
promise these assurances and
short circuit the procedural pre
conditions provided in Title VI.
If the Federal Government may
not cut off funds except pur
suant to an agency rule, ap
proved by the President, and
presented to the appropriate
committee of Congress for a
layover period, and after volun
tary means to achieve com
pliance have failed, it is incon
ceivable that Congress intended
to permit individuals to circum
vent these administrative pre
requisites themselves.
Furthermore, although Con
gress intended Title VI to end
federal financial support for ra
cially discriminatory policies of
not only public but also private
institutions and programs, it is
extremely unlikely that Con
gress, without a word indicating
that it intended to do so, con
templated creating an indepen
dent, private statutory cause of
action against all private as well
as public agencies that might be
in violation of the section. There
is no doubt that Congress re

garded private litigation as an
important tool to attack dis
criminatory practices. It does
not at all follow, however, that
Congress anticipated new pri
vate actions under Title VI itself.
Wherever a discriminatory prog
ram was a public undertaking,
such as a public school, private
remedies were already available
under other statutes, and a pri
vate remedy under Title VI was
unnecessary. Congress was well
aware of this fact. It was un
necessary, of course, to create a
Title VI private action against
private discriminators where
they were already within the
reach of existing private re
medies.
For those who believe, con
trary to my views, that Title VI
was intended to create a stricter
standard of color blindness than
the Constitution itself requires,
the result of no private cause of
action follows even more read
ily. In that case Congress must
be seen to have banned degrees
of discrimination, as well as
types of discriminators, not pre
viously reached by law. A Con
gress careful enough to provide
that existing private causes of ac
tion would be preserved (in Ti
tles 111 and IVJ would not leave
for inference a vast new exten
sion of private enforcement
power. And a Congress so ex
ceptionally concerned with the
satisfaction of procedural pre
liminaries before confronting
fund recipients with the choice
of a cut-off or of stopping dis
criminating would not permit
private parties to pose precisely
that same dilemma in a greatly
widened category of cases with
no procedural requirements
whatsoever.
If private suits to enjoin con
duct allegedly violative of sec
tion 601 were permitted, reci
pients of federal funds would be
presented with the choice of
either ending what the court,
rather than the agency, deter
mined to be a discriminatory
practice within the meaning of
Title VI or refusing federal funds
and thereby escaping from the
statute's jurisdictional predi
cate. This is precisely the same
choice which would confront

recipients if suit was brought to
cut off funds. Both types of ac
tions would equally jeopardize
the administrative processes so
carefully structured into the law.
Because each of my col
leagues either has a different
view or assumes a private cause
of action, however, the merits of
the Title VI issue must be ad
dressed. My views in that re
gard, as well as my views with
respect to the equal protection
issue, are included in the joint
opinion of Brennan, White,
Marshall, and Blackmun.

By Justice Marshall

Mr. Justice Marshall.
I agree with the judgment of
the Court only insofar as it per
mits a university to consider the
race of an applicant in making
admissions decisions. I do not
agree that petitioner's admis
sions program violates the Con
stitution. For it must be remem
bered that, during most of the
past 200 years, the Constitution
as interpreted by this Court did
not prohibit the most ingenious
and pervasive forms of discrimi
nation against the Negro. Now,
when a State acts to remedy the
effects of that legacy of discrimi
nation, I cannot believe that this
same Constitution stands as a
barrier.
Three hundred and fifty years
ago, the Negro was dragged to
this country in chains to be sold
into slavery. Uprooted from his
homeland and thrust into bon
dage for forced labor, the slave
was deprived of all legal rights. It
was unlawful to teach him to
read; he could be sold away
from his family and friends at the
whim of his master; and killing
or maiming him was not a crime.
The system of slavery brutalized
and dehumanized both master
and slave.
The denial of human rights
was etched into the American
colonies' first attempts at estab
lishing self-government. When
the colonists determined to seek
their independence from Eng
land, they drafted a unique
document cataloguing their
grievances against the King and
proclaiming as "self-evident"
that "all men are created equal"
and are endowed "with certain
unalienable Rights," including
those to "Life, Liberty and the
pursuit of Happiness." The
self-evident truths and the una
lienable rights were intended,
however, to apply only to white
men.
The position of the Negro
today in America is the tragic but
inevitable consequence of cen
turies of unequal treatment.
Measured by any benchmark of
comfort or achievement, mean
ingful equality remains a distant
dream for the Negro.
A Negro child today has a life
expectancy which is shorter by
more than five years than that of
a white child. The Negro child's
mother is over three times more
likely to die of complications in
childbirth, and the infant mortal
ity rate for Negroes is nearly
twice that for whites. The me
dian income of the Negro family
is only 60 percent that of the me
dian of a white family, and the
percentage of Negroes who live
in families with incomes below
the poverty line is nearly four
times greater than that of whites.
When the Negro child reaches
working age, he finds that
America offers him significantly
less than it offers his white coun
terpart. For Negro adults, the
unemployment rate is twice that
of whites, and the unemploy
ment rate for Negro teenagers is
nearly three times that of white

teenagers. A Negro male who
completes four years of college
can expect a median annual in
come of merely $110 more than a
white male who has only a high
school diploma. Although Neg
roes represent 11.5 percent of
the population, theyareonlyl.2
percent of the lawyers and
judges, 2 percent of the physi
cians, 2.3 percent of the de
ntists, 1.1 percent of the en
gineers and 2.6 percent of the
college and university profes
sors.
The relationship between
those figures and the history of
unequal treatment afforded to
the Negro cannot be denied. At
every point from birth to death
the impact of the past is re
flected in the still disfavored
position of the Negro.
In light of the sorry history of
discrimination and its devastat
ing impact on the lives of Neg
roes, bringing the Negro into
the mainstream of American life
should be a state interest of the
highest order. To fail to do so is
to ensure that America will
forever remain a divided society.
I do not believe that the Four
teenth Amendment requires us
to accept that fate. Neither its
history nor our past cases lend
any support to the conclusion
that a University may not remedy
â™¦he cumulative effects of socie
ty's discrimination by giving
consideration to race in an effort
to increase the number and per
centage of Negro doctors.
It is plain that the Fourteenth
Amendment was not intended
to prohibit measures designed
to remedy the effects of the Na
tion's past treatment of Neg
roes. The Congress that passed
the Fourteenth Amendment is
the same Congress that passed
the 1866 Freedmen's Bureau Act,
an act that provided many of its
benefits only to Negroes. In
deed, the bill was bitterly op
posed on the ground that it "un
dertakes to make the negro in
some respects . . . superior . . .
and gives them favors that the
poor white boy in the North
cannot get." The bill's suppor
ters defended it â€” not by rebut
ting the claim of special treat
ment â€” but by pointing to the
need for such treatment.
Despite the objection to the
special treatment the bill would
provide for Negroes, it was pas
sed by Congress. President
Johnson vetoed this bill and also
a subsequent bill that contained
some modifications; one of his
principal objections to both bills
was that they gave special be
nefits to Negroes. Rejecting the
concerns of the President and
the bill's opponents, Congress
overrode the President's second
veto.
As has been demonstrated in
our joint opinion, this Court's
past cases establish the constitu
tionality of race-conscious re
medial measures. Beginning
with the school desegregation
cases, we recognized that even
absent a judicial or legislative

finding of constitutional viola
tion, a school board constitu
tionally could consider the race
of students in making school as
signment decisions.
Only last Term, in United
Jewish Organizations v. Carey,
430 U.S. 144 (1977), we upheld a
New York reapportionment plan
that was deliberately drawn on
the basis of race to enhance the
electoral power of Negroes and
Puerto Ricans; the plan had the
effect of diluting the electoral
strength of the Hasidic lewish
Community. We were willing in
UJO to sanction the remedial
use of a racial classification even
though it disadvantaged other
wise "innocent" individuals.
While I applaud the judgment
of the Court that a university
may consider race in its admis
sions process, it is more than a
little ironic that, after several
hundred years of class-based
discrimination against Negroes,
the Court is unwilling to hold
that a class-based remedy for
that discrimination is permissi
ble. In declining to so hold, to
day's judgment ignores the fact
that for several hundred years
Negroes have been discrimi
nated against, not as individuals,
but rather solely because of the
color of their skins. It is un
necessary in 20th century
America to have individual Neg
roes demonstrate that they have
been victims of racial discrimina
tion; the racism of our society
has been so pervasive that none,
regardless of wealth or position,
has managed to escape its im
pact. The experience of Negroes
in America has been different in
kind, not just in degree, from
that of other ethnic groups. It is
not merely the history of slavery
alone but also that a whole
people were marked as inferior
by the law. And that mark has
endured. The dream of America
as the great melting pot has not
been realized for the Negro; be
cause of his skin color he never
even made it into the pot.
These differences in the ex
perience of the Negro make it
difficult for me to accept that
Negroes cannot be afforded
greater protection under the
Fourteenth Amendment where
it is necessary to remedy the ef
fects of past discrimination. In
the Civil Rights Cases the Court
wrote that the Negro emerging
from slavery must cease "to be
the special favorite of the laws."
We cannot in light of the history
of the last century yield to that
view. Had the Court in that case
and others been willing to "do
for human liberty and the fun
damental rights of American
citizenship what it did . . . for
the protection of slavery and the
rights of the masters of fugitive
slaves," we would not need now
to permit the recognition of any
"special wards."
Most importantly, had the
Court been willing in 1896, in
Plessy v. Ferguson, to hold that
the Equal Protection Clause for
bids differences in treatment
based on race, we would not be
faced with this dilemma in 1978.
We must remember, however,
that the principle that the "Con
stitution is colorblind" appeared
only in the opinion of the lone
dissenter. The majority of the
Court rejected the principle of
color blindness, and for the next
60 years, from Plessy to Brown v.
Board of Education, ours was a
Nation where, by law, an indi
vidual could be given "special"
treatment based on the color of
his skin.
It is because of a legacy of un
equal treatment that we now
must permit the institutions of
this society to give consideration
to race in making decisions

about who will hold the posi
tions of influence, affluence and
prestige in America. For far too
long, the doors to those posi
tions have been shut to Neg
roes. If we are ever to become a
fully integrated society, one in
which the color of a person's
skin will not determine the op
portunities available to him or
her, we must be willing to take
steps to open those doors. I do
not believe that anyone can truly
look into America's past and still
find that a remedy for the effects
of that past is impermissible.
It has been said that this case
involves only the individual,
Bakke, and this University. I
doubt, however, that there is a
computer capable of determin
ing the number of persons and

institutions that may be affected
by the decision in this case.
I fear that we have come full
circle. After the Civil War our
government started several "af
firmative action" programs. This
Court in the Civil Rights Cases
and Plessy v. Ferguson de
stroyed the movement toward
complete equality. For almost a
century no action was taken, and
this nonaction was with the tacit
approval of the courts. Then we
had Brown v. Board of Education
and the Civil Rights Acts of Con
gress, followed by numerous af
firmative action programs. Now,
we have this Court again step
ping in, this time to stop affirma
tive action programs of the type
used by the University of
California.

By Justice Blackmun

Mr. Justice Blackmun.
I participate fully, of course, in
the opinion that bears the names
of my Brothers Brennan, White,
Marshall, and myself. I add only
some general observations that
hold particular significance for
me, and then a few comments
on equal protection.
I yield to no one in my earnest
hope that the time will come
when an "affirmative action"
program is unnecessary and is,
in truth, only a relic of the past. I
would hope that we could reach
this stage within a decade at the
most. But the story of Brown v.
Board of Education decided al
most a quarter of a century ago,
suggests that that hope is a slim
one. At some time, however,
beyond any period of what some
would claim is only transitional
inequality, the United States
must and will reach a stage of
maturity where action along this
line is no longer necessary. Then
persons will be regarded as per
sons, and discrimination of the
type we address today will be an
ugly feature of history that is in
structive but that is behind us.
It is somewhat ironic to have
us so deeply disturbed over a
program where race is an ele
ment of consciousness, and yet
to be aware of the fact, as we are,
that institutions of higher learn
ing, albeit more on the under
graduate than the graduate
level, have given conceded pre
ferences up to a point to those
possessed of athletic skills, to
the children of alumni, to the
.affluent who may bestow their
largess on the institutions, and
to those having connections
with celebrities, the famous, and
the powerful.
Programs of admission to in
stitutions of higher learning are
basically a responsibility for
academicians and for adminis
trators and the specialists they
employ. The judiciary, in con
trast, is ill-equipped and poorly
trained for this. The administra
tion and management of educa
tional institutions are beyond
the competence of judges and
are within the special compe
tence of educators, provided
always that the educators per
form within legal and constitu
tional bounds. For me, there
fore, interference by the
judiciary must be the rare excep
tion and not the rule.
I am not convinced, as Mr. Jus
tice Powell seems to be, that the
difference between the Davis
program and the one employed
by Harvard is very profound or
constitutionally significant. The
line between the two is a thin
and indistinct one. In each, sub
jective application is at work.
Because of my conviction that
admission programs are primar
ily for the educators, I am willing
to accept the representation that

the Harvard program is one
where good faith in its administ
ration is practiced as well as pro
fessed. I agree that such a prog
ram, where race or ethnic
background is only one of many
factors, is a program better for
mulated than Davis' two-track
system. The cynical, of course,
may say that under a program
such as Harvard's one mpy ac
complish covertly that Davis
concedes it does openly. I need
not go that far, for despite its
two-track aspect, the Davis
program, for me, is within con
stitutional bounds, though
perhaps barely so.
It is worth noting, perhaps,
that governmental preference
has not been a stranger to our
legal life. We see it in veterans'
preferences. We see it in the
aid-to-the-handicapped prog
rams. We see it in the progres
sive income tax. We see it in the
Indian programs. We may ex
cuse some of these on the
ground that they have specific
constitutional protection or, as
with Indians, that those bene
fited are wards of the Govern
ment. Nevertheless, these pre
ferences exist and may not be
ignored. And in the admissions
field, as I have indicated, educa
tional institutions have always
used geography, athletic ability,
anticipated financial largess,
alumni pressure, and other fac
tors of that kind.
I add these only as additional
components on the edges of the
central question as to which I
join my Brothers Brennan,
White, and Marshall in our more
general approach. It is gratifying
to know that the Court at least
finds it constitutional for an
academic institution to take race
and ethnic background into
consideration as one factor,
among many, in the administra
tion of its admissions program. I
presume that that factor always
has been there, though perhaps
not conceded or even admitted.
It is a fact of life, however, and a
part of the real world of which
we are all a part. The sooner we
get down the road toward ac
cepting and being a part of the
real world, and not shutting it
out and away from us, the
sooner will these difficulties van
ish from the scene.
I suspect that it would be im
possible to arrange an affirma
tive action program in a racially
neutral way and have it success
ful. To ask that this be so is to
demand the impossible. In
order to get beyond racism, we
must first take account of race.
There is no other way. And in
order to treat some persons
equally, we must treat them dif
ferently. We cannot â€” we dare
not â€” let the Equal Protection
Clause perpetrate racial supre
macy.
volved here. Nor do whites as a
class have any of the "traditional
indicia of suspectness: the class
is not saddled with such dis
abilities, or subjected to such a
history of purposeful unequal
treatment, or relegated to such a
position of political powerless
ness as to command extraordi
nary protection from the
majoritarian political process."
On the other hand, the fact
that this case does not fit neatly
into our prior analytic
framework for race cases does
not mean that it should be
analyzed by applying the very
loose rational-basis standard of
review that is the very least that
is always applied in equal pro
tection cases.
Instead, a number of consid
erations â€” developed in gender
discrimination cases but which
carry even more force when
applied to racial classifications
â€” lead us to conclude that racial
classifications designed to
further remedial purposes
" 'must serve important gov
ernmental objectives and must
be substantially related to
achievement of those objec
tives.' "
First, race, like, "gender
based classifications too often
(has) been inexcusably utilized
to stereotype and stigmatize
politically powerless segments
of society."
Second, race, like gender and
illegitimacy, is an immutable
characteristic which its posses
sors are powerless to escape or
set aside.
In sum, because of the sig
nificant risk that racial classifica
tions established for ostensibly

benign purposes can be mis
used, causing effects not unlike
those created by invidious clas
sifications, it is inappropriate to
inquire only whether there is
any conceivable basis that might
sustain such a classification.
Instead, to justify such a clas
sification an important and ar
ticulated purpose for its use
must be shown. In addition, any
statute must be stricken that

stigmatizes any group or that
singles out those least well rep
resented in the political process
to bear the brunt of a benign
program. Thus our review under
the Fourteenth Amendment
should be strict â€” not " 'strict'
in theory and fatal in fact," be
cause it is stigma that causes fat
ality â€” but strict and searching
nonetheless.
If it was reasonable to con

elude â€” as we hold that it was â€”
that the failure of minorities to
qualify for admission at Davis
under regular procedures was
due principally to the effects of
past discrimination, then there
is a reasonable likelihood that,
but for pervasive racial discrimi
nation, respondent would have
failed to qualify for admission
even in the absence of Davis'
special admissions program.
Thus, our cases under Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act have held
that, in order to achieve minority
participation in previously
segregated areas of public life,
Congress may require or au
thorize preferential treatment
forthose likely disadvantaged by
societal racial discrimination.
Such legislation has been sus
tained even without a require
ment of findings of intentional
racial discrimination by those
required orauthorized to accord
preferential treatment, or a
case-by-case determination that
those to be benefited suffered
from racial discrimination.
These decisions compel the
conclusion that States also may
adopt race-conscious programs
designed to overcome substan
tial, chronic minority underre
presentation where there is
reason to believe that the evil
addressed is a product of past
racial discrimination.
We therefore conclude that
Davis' goal of admitting minority
students disadvantaged by the
effects of past discrimination is
sufficiently important to justify
use of race-conscious admis
sions criteria.
Properly construed, there
fore, our prior cases unequivoc
ally show that a state govern

ment may adopt race-conscious
programs if the purpose of such
programs is to remove the dispa
rate racial impact its actions
might otherwise have and if
there is reason to believe that
the disparate impact is itself the
product of past discrimination,
whether its own or that of soci
ety at large. There is no question
that Davis' program is valid
under this test.
Certainly, on the basis of the
undisputed factual submissions
before this Court, Davis had a
sound basis for believing that
the problem of underrepresen
tation of minorities was substan
tial and chronic and that the
problem was attributable to
handicaps imposed on minority
applicants by past and present
racial discrimination. Until at
least 1973, the practice of
medicine in this country was, in
fact, if not in law, largely the pre
rogative of whites.
Moreover, Davis had very
good reason to believe that the
national pattern of underrepre
sentation of minorities in
medicine would be perpetuated
if it retained a single admissions
standard.
Davis clearly could conclude
that the serious and persistent
underrepresentation of
minorities in medicine depicted
by these statistics is the result of
handicaps under which minority
applicants labor as a consequ
ence of a background of delib
erate, purposeful discrimination
against minorities in education
and in society generally, as well
as in the medical profession.
From the inception of our na
tional life, Negroes have been

subjected to unique legal dis
abilities impairing access to
equal educational opportunity.
Moreover, we need not rest
solely on our own conclusion
that Davis had sound reason to
believe that the effects of past
discrimination were handicap
ping minority applicants to the
Medical School, because the
Department of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare, the expert
agency charged by Congress
with promulgating regulations
enforcing Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. has also
reached the conclusion that race
may be taken into account in
situations where a failure to do
so would limit participation by
minorities in federally funded
programs, and regulations
promulgated by the Department
expressly contemplate that ap
propriate race-conscious prog
rams may be adopted by univer
sities to remedy unequal access
to university programs caused
by their own or by past societal
discrimination.
It is not even claimed that
Davis' program in any way oper
ates to stigmatize or single out
any discrete and insular, or even
any identifiable, nonminority
group. Nor will harm compara
ble to that imposed upon racial
minorities by exclusion or sep
aration on grounds of race be

the likely result of the program.
It does not, for example, estab
lish an exclusive preserve for
minority students apart from
and exclusive of whites. Rather,
its purpose is to overcome the
effects of segregation by bring
ing the races together.
True, whites are excluded
from participation in the special
admissions program, but this
fact only operates to reduce the
number of whites to be admitted
in the regular admissions prog
ram inordertopermit admission
of a reasonable percentage â€”
less than their proportion of the
California population â€” of
otherwise under-represented
qualified minority applicants.
We disagree with the lower
courts' conclusion that the Davis
program's use of race was un
reasonable in light of its objec
tives. First, as petitioner argues,
there are no practical means by
which it could achieve its ends in
the foreseeable future without
the use of race-conscious mea
sures.
Second, the Davis admissions
program does not simply equate
minority status with disadvan
tage. Rather, Davis considers on
an individual basis each applic
ant's personal history to deter
mine whether he or she has
likely been disadvantaged by ra
cial discrimination. The record
makes clear that only minority
applicants likely to have been
isolated from the mainstream of
Americal life are considered in

the special program; other
minority applicants are eligible
only through the regular admis
sions program.
Finally, Davis' special admis
sions program cannot be said to
violate the Constitution simply
because it has set aside a pre
determined number of places
for qualified minority applicants
rather than using minority status
as a positive factor to be consi
dered in evaluating the applica
tions of disadvantaged minority
applicants. For purposes of con
stitutional adjudication, there is
no difference between the two
approaches.
In any admissions program
which accords special consider
ation to disadvantaged racial
minorities, a determination of
the degree of preference to be
given is unavoidable, and any
given preference that results in
the exclusion of a white candi
date is no more or less constitu
tionally acceptable than a prog
ram such as that at Davis.
Furthermore, the extent of the
preference inevitably depends
on how many minority applic
ants the particular school is

seeking to admit in any particu
lar year so long as the number of
qualified minority applicants ex
ceeds that number.
There is no sensible, and cer
tainly no constitutional, distinc
tion between, for example, ad
ding a set number of points to
the admissions rating of disad
vantaged minority applicants as
an expression of the preference
with the expectation that this
will result in the admission of an
approximately determined
number of qualified minority
applicants and setting a fixed
number of places for such
applicants as was done here.
The "Harvard" program as
those employing it readily con
cede, openly and successfully
employs a racial criterion for the
purpose of ensuring that some
ot the scarce places in institu
tions of higher education are al
located to disadvantaged minor
ity students. That the Harvard
approach does not also make
public the extent of the prefer
ence and the precise workings
of the system while the Davis
program employs a specific,
openly stated number, does not

condemn the latter plan for pur
poses of Fourteenth Amend
ment adjudication. It may be
that the Harvard plan is more ac
ceptable to the public than is the
Davis "quota." If it is, any State,
including California, is free to
adopt it in preference to a less
acceptable alternative, just as it
is generally free, as far as the
Constitution is concerned, to
abjure granting any racial pre
ferences in its admissions prog
ram. But there is no basis for pre
ferring a particular preference
program simply because in
achieving the same goals that
the Davis Medical School is pur
suing, it proceeds in a manner
that is not immediately apparent
to the public.
Accordingly, we would re
verse the judgment of the Sup
reme Court of California holding
the Medical School's special
admissions program unconstitu
tional and directing respon
dent's admission, as well as that
portion of the judgment enjoin
ing the Medical School from ac
cording any consideration to
race in the admissions process.
