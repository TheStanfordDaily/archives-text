# Supreme Court of the United States
## Regents of the University of California v. Allan Bakke 
### 
The following are excerpts from the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision on the case of
Regents of the University of California v.
Bakke. The opinions are by Associate Jus-

tices Lewis Powell, William Brennan, lohn
Stevens, Harry Blackmun, Thurgood Mar
shall and Byron White.

By Justice Powell

Mr. Justice Powell announced
the judgment of the Court.
For the reasons stated in the
following opinion, I believe that
so much of the judgment of the
California court as holds
petitioner's special admissions
program unlawful and directs
that respondent be admitted to
the Medical School must be af
firmed. For the reasons expres
sed in a separate opinion, my
brothers The Chief Justice, Mr.
Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Re
linquish and Mr. Justice Stevens
concur in this judgment.
I also conclude for the reasons
stated in the following opinion
that the portion of the court's
judgment enjoining petitioner
from according any considera
tion to race in its admissions
process must be reversed. For
reasons expressed in separate
opinions, my brothers Mr. Jus
tice Brennan, Mr. Justice White,
Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr.
Justice Blackmun concur in this
judgment.
In this Court the parties
neither briefed nor argued the
applicability of Title VI of the
Civil Rights of 1964. Rather, as
had the California court, they
focused exclusively upon the
validity of the special admissions
program under the Equal Protec
tion Clause. Because it was pos
sible, however, that a decision
on Title VI might obviate resort
to constitutional interpretation,
we requested supplementary
briefing on the statutory issue.
At the outset we face the ques
tion whether a right of action for
private parties exists under Title
VI. Respondent argues that
there is a private right of action.
He contends that the statute
creates a Federal right in his
favor, that legislative history re
veals an intent to permit private
actions, that such actions would
further the remedial purposes of
the statute, and that enforce
ment of Federal rights under the
Civil Rights Act generally is not
relegated to the states.
In addition, he cites several
lower court decisions which
have recognized or assumed the
existence of a private right of ac
tion. Petitioner denies the exis
tence of a private right of action.
In its view, administrative cur
tailment of Federal funds under
that section was the only sanc
tion to be imposed upon reci
pients that violated Section 601.
Petitioner also points out that
Title VI contains no explicit grant
of a private right of action, in
contrast to Titles 11, 111, IV, and
VII.
We find it unnecessary to re
solve this question in the instant
case. The question of respon
dent's right to bring an action
under Title VI was neither ar
gued nor decided in either of the
courts below, and this Court has
been hesitant to review ques
tions not addressed below. We
therefore do not address this dif
ficult issue. Similarly, we need
not pass upon petitioner's claim
that private plaintiffs under Title
VI must exhaust administrative
remedies. We assume only for
the purposes of this case that re
spondent has a right of action
under Title VI.
The language of section 601,
like that of the Equal-Protection
Clause, is majestic in its sweep:
No person in the United States
shall, on the ground of race,
color, or national origin, be

excluded from participation in,
be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity re
ceiving Federal financial assis
tance.
The concept of "discrimina
tion," like the phrase "equal
protection of the laws," is sus
ceptible to varying interpreta
tions, for as Mr. Justice Holmes
declared, "(a) word is not a crys
tal, transparent and unchanged,
it is the skin of a living thought
and may vary greatly in colorand
content according to the cir
cumstances and the time in
which it is used." We must,
therefore, seek whatever aid is
available in determining the
precise meaning of the statute
before us.
Examination of the volumin
ous legislative history of Title VI
reveals a congressional intent to
halt federal funding of entities
that violate a prohibition of ra
cial discrimination similartothat
of the Constitution. Although
isolated statements of various
legislators, taken out of context,
can be marshalled in support of
the proposition that section 601
enacted a purely colorblind
scheme, without regard to the
reach of the Equal Protection
Clause, these comments must
be read against the background
of both the problem that Con
gress was addressing and the
broader view of the statute that
emerges from a full examination
of the legislative debates.
The problem confronting
Congress was discrimination
against Negro citizens at the
hands of recipients of federal
moneys. . . . Over and over
again, proponents of the bill de
tailed the plight of Negroes
seeking equal treatment in such
programs. There simply was no
reason for Congress to consider
the validity of hypothetical pre
ferences that might be accorded
minority citizens; the legislators
were dealing with the real and
pressing problem of how to
guarantee those citizens equal
treatment.
In view of the clear legislative
intent, Title VI must be held to
proscribe only those racial clas
sifications that would violate the
Equal Protection Clause or the
Fifth Amendment.
The parties fight a sharp pre
liminary action ovar the proper
characterization of the special
admissions program. Petitioner
prefers to view it as establishing
a "goal" of minority representa
tion in the medical school. Re
spondent, echoing the courts
below, labels it a racial quota.
This semantic distinction is
beside the point: the special
admissions program is undeni
ably a classification based on
race and ethnic background.
The guarantees of the Four
teenth Amendment extend to
persons. Its language is explicit:
"No state shall . . . deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."
The guarantee of equal pro
tection cannot mean one thing
when applied to one individual
and something else when
applied to a person of another
color. If both are not accorded
the same protection, then it is
not equal.
Racial and ethnic distinctions
of any sort are inherently sus
pect and thus call for the most
exacting judicial examination.

If it is the individual who is
entitled to judicial protection
against classifications based
upon his racial or ethnic
background because such dis
tinctions impinge upon personal
rights, rather than the individual
only because of his membership
in a particular group, then con
stitutional standards may be
applied consistently.
Political judgments regarding
the necessity for the particular
classification may be weighed in
the constitutional balance, but
the standard of justification will
remain constant. This is as it
should be, since those political
judgments are the product of
rough compromise struck by
contending groups within the
democratic process.
When they touch upon an in
dividual's race or ethnic
background, he is entitled to a
judicial determination that the
burden he is asked to bear on
that basis is precisely tailored to
serve a compelling governmen
tal interest. The Constitution
guarantees that right to every
person regardless of his
background.
Petitioner contends that on
-several occasions this Court has
approved preferential classifica
tions without applying the most
exacting scrutiny. Most of the
cases upon which petitioner re
lies are drawn from three areas:
school desegregation, employ
ment discrimination, and sex
discrimination. Each of the cases
cited presented a situation
materially different from the
facts of this case.
The school desegregation
cases are inapposite. Each in
volved remedies for clearly de
termined constitutional viola
tions. Racial classifications thus
were designed as remedies for
the vindication of constitutional
entitlement. Moreover, the
scope of the remedies was not
permitted to exceed the extent
of the violations. Here, there
was no judicial determination of
constitutional violation as a pre
dicate for the formulation of a
remedial classification.
The employment discrimina
tion cases also do not advance
petitioner's cause. For example
we approved a retroactive award
of seniority to a class of Negro
truck drivers who had been the
victims of discrimination â€” not
just by society at large, but by
the respondent in that case. . . .
Such preferences also have
been upheld where a legislative
or administrative body charged
with the responsibility made de
terminations of past discrimina
tion by the industries affected,
and fashioned remedies
deemed appropriate to rectify
the discrimination.
But we have never approved
preferential classifications in the
absence of proven constitu
tional or statutory violations.
Nor is petitioner's view as to
the applicable standard sup
ported by the fact that gender
based classifications are not sub
jected to this level of scrutiny.
Gender-based distinctions are
less likely to create the analytical
and practical problems present
in preferential programs pre
mised on racial orethniccriteria.
With respect to gender there
are only two possible classifica
tions. The incidence of the bur
dens imposed by preferential
classifications is clear. There are
no rival groups who can claim
that they, too, are entitled to
preferential treatment.
Classwide questions as to the
group suffering previous injury
and groups which fairly can be
burdened are relatively man
ageable for reviewing courts.
The resolution of these same

questions in the context of racial
and ethnic preferences presents
far more complex and intracta
ble problems than gender-based
classifications. More impor
tantly, the perception of racial
classifications as inherently odi
ous stems from a lengthy and
tragic history that gender-based
classifications do not share. In
sum, the Court has never viewed
such classification as inherently
suspect or as comparable to ra
cial or ethnic classifications for
the purpose of equal-protection
analysis.
We have held that in "order to
justify the use of a suspect clas
sification, a State must show that
its purpose or interest is both
constitutionally permissible and
substantial, and that its use of
the classification is 'necessary
. . . to the accomplishment' of
its purpose or the safeguarding
of its interest."
The special admissions prog
ram purports to serve the pur
poses of: (i) "reducing the his
toric deficit of traditionally dis
favored minorities in medical
schools and the medical profes
sion," Brief for Petitioner 32; (ii)
countering the effects of societal
discrimination; (iii) increasing
the number of physicians who
will practice in communities cur
rently undeserved; and (iv) ob
taining the educational benefits
that flow from an ethnically di
verse student body. It is neces
sary to decide which, if any, of
these purposes is substantial
enough to support the use of a
suspect classification.
If petitioner's purpose is to as
sure within its student body
some specific percentage of a
particular group merely because
of its race or ethnic origin, such a
preferential purpose must be re
jected not as insubstantial but as
facially invalid. Preferring mem
bers of any one group for no
reason other than race or ethnic
origin is discrimination for its
own sake. This the Constitution
forbids.
The State certainly has a
legitimate and substantial in
terest in ameliorating, or
eliminating where feasible, the
disabling effects of identified
discrimination.
We have never approved a
classification that aids persons
perceived as members of rela
tively victimized groups at the
expense of other innocent indi
viduals in the absence of judi
cial, legislative, or administra
tive findings of constitutional or
statutory violations.
Petitioner does not purport to
have made, and is in no position
to make, such findings.
Hence, the purpose of help
ing certain groups whom the fa
culty of the Davis Medical
School perceived as victims of
"societal discrimination" does
not justify a classification that
imposes disadvantages upon
persons like respondent, who
bear no responsibility for what
ever harm the beneficiaries of
the special admissions program
are thought to have suffered.
Petitioner identifies, as
another purpose of its program,
improving the delivery of health
care services to communities
currently underserved. It may be
assumed that in some situations
a State's interest in facilitating
the health care of its citizens is
sufficiently compelling to sup
port the use of a suspect classifi
cation. But there is virtually no
evidence in the record indicat
ing that petitioner's special ad
missions program is either
needed or geared to promote
that goal.
The fourth goal asserted by
petitioner is the attainment of a
diverse student body. This

clearly is a constitutionally per
missible goal foran institution of
higher education. Academic
freedom, though not a specifi
cally enumerated constitutional
right, long has been viewed as a
special concern of the First
Amendment. The freedom of a
university to make its own
judgments as to education in
cludes the selection of its stu
dent body.
It may be argued that there is
greater force to these views at
the undergraduate level than in
a medical school where the
training is centered primarily on
professional competency. But
even at the graduate level, our
tradition and experience lend
support to the view that the con
tribution of diversity is substan
tial.
Ethnic diversity, however, is
only one element in a range of
factors a university properly may
consider in attaining the goal of
a heterogeneous student body.
Although a university must have
wide discretion in making the
sensitive judgment as to who
should be admitted, constitu
tional limitations protecting in
dividual rights may not be disre
garded.
Respondent urges â€” and the
courts below have held â€” that
petitioner's dual admissions
program is a racial classification
that impermissibly infringes his
rights under the Fourteenth
Amendment. As the interest of
diversity is compelling in the
context of a university's admis
sions program, the question re
mains whether the program's
racial classification is necessary
to promote this interest.
Petitioner's argument that this
is the only effective means of
serving the interest o1 diversity is
seriously flawed. In a most fun
damental sense the argument
misconceives the nature of the
state interest that would justify
consideration of race or ethnic
background. It is not an interest
in simple ethnic diversity, in
which a specified percentage of
the student body is in effect
guaranteed to be members of
selected ethnic groups, with the
remaining percentage an undif
ferentiated aggregation of stu
dents. The diversity that furthers
a compelling state interest en
compasses a far broader array of
qualifications and characteris
tics of which racial or ethnic ori
gin is but a single though impor
tant element. Petitioner's spe
cial admissions program, fo
cused solely on ethnic diversity,
would hinder rather than further
attainment of genuine diversity.
The experience of other uni
versity admissions programs,
which take race into account in
achieving the educational diver
sity valued by the First Amend
ment, demonstrates that the as
signment of a fixed number of
places to a minority group is not
a necessary means toward that
end. An illuminating example is
found in the Harvard College
program:
In recent years Harvard Col
lege has expanded the concept
of diversity to include students
from disadvantaged economic,
racial and ethnic groups. Harvard
College now recruits not only
Californians or Louisianans but
also blacks and Chicanos and
other minority students.
In practice, this new definition
of diversity has meant that race
has been a factor in some admis
sion decisions. When the Com
mittee on Admissions reviews
the large middle group of applic
ants who are "admissible" and
deemed capable of doing good
work in their courses, the race of
an applicant may tip the balance
