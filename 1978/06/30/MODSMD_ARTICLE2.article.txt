# State supreme court refuses review
## Medical Center denied funds 
### John Nielsen 
"Losing the money is not
something we relish, but it won't
modify our behavior." That's
how Medical School Dean Dr.
Clayton Rich responded to a
California Supreme Court move
that cost the University $448,800
in state funds.
Yesterday the Court refused
to review a lower court decision
which had held it unconstitu

tional for California to pay the
University for expanding its en
rollment. Chief justice Rose
Bird, Associate Justice Stanley
Mosk and William Clark, and
Appeals Court Justice Thomas
Caldecott voted to deny a hear
ing, while Justices Mathew Tob
riner, Frank Richardson and
Frank Newman favored one.
Stanford had requested that
the court reconsider a state

court of appeals ruling that had
held such payments violate the
state constitutional prohibition
against using public money to
support private schools.
In 1973, Stanford and the state
had agreed that the University
would be awarded $12,000 each
year for each medical student
trained, minus some funding
applicable as a result of the Fed
eral Comprehensive Health
Manpower Training Act of 1971.
In the 1973-74 and 1974-75
years the University had claimed
$495,860, as enrollment was in
creased by 61 students. Forty
four more students were added
in the 1975-76 school year, and
the University went back to the
state claiming $448,000 for the
increase, but at that point the
state controller's office decided
that the claim was illegal and re
fused to pay. The Court of Appe
als agreed.
"It's fair to say that we were
disappointed," said Robert
Rosenzweig, University Vice-
President for Public Affairs. "We
did what was required to qualify
under the program, and it was
disappointing to see that the
court refused to give a definitive
answer."
A court observer said that
payments received in the years
before 1975-76 were not in
volved in this action because the
litigation dealt with only that
claim.
"It came as a surprise," said
Carl Hitchjner, associate staff
counsel at the medical center
legal department. "We felt that
there were significant public
policy issues that the court
might have wanted to hear."
