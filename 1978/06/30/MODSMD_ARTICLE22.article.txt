# Court: officials may be sued
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court, rejecting the Carter
administration's "absolute im
munity" arguments, ruled yes
terday that federal officials may
be sued if they deliberately viol
ate a person's constitutional
rights.
The decision could have an
immediate effect on a series of
pending civil lawsuits against
top-ranking officials of the FBI
and CIA accused of violating
constitutional rights by approv
ing illegal wiretaps and breakins.
"It makes little sense," Justice
Byron White wrote for the court,
"to hold that a government
jgent is liable for warrantless
and forcible entry into a citizen's
house in pursuit of evidence,
but that an official of higher rank
who actually orders such a
burglary is immune simply be
cause of his greater authority."
Voting 5 to 4, the justices held
that all federal officials except
those who function essentially
as judges rather than adminis
trators can be held accountable
for unconstitutional actions.
The four dissenters, in an
opinion by Justice William Re
hnquist, said the decision virtu

ally stripped those officials of
any immunity in carrying out
their duties.
Attorney General Griffin Bell
had forwarded the same argu
ment. He said the threat of civil
suits seeking damages places an
unfair burden on federal offi
cials with sensitive policymaking
assignments.
Discounting those fears,
White said, "Federal officials will
not be liable for mere mistakes
in judgment, whether the mis
take is one of fact or one of law."
White said that only a specific
act of Congress could free fed
eral officials from such liability,
stating, "In the absence of con
gressional direction to the con
trary, there is no basis for ac
cording to federal officials a
higher degree of immunity from
liability . . . than is accorded
state officials. . . ."
In other decisions yesterday,
the court:

— By a 7-2 vote in a Rhode
Island case stemming from the
nation's medical malpractice
crisis of 1975, gave consumers
the right to sue insurance com
panies on charges of refusing to
sell them certain types of insur
ance.
The justices ruled that a 1945
law, the McCarran-Ferguson
Act, protects insurance com
panies from many — but not all
— federal antitrust lawsuits.
— Ruled that employers
charged with illegal discrimina
tion in employment may offer an
array of evidence in their own
behalf, including workforce
statistics to prove that the
charges are unfounded.
—Upheld the dismissal of
price-fixing convictions against
four major U.S. gypsum com
panies. Now, the federal gov
ernment must decide whether
to seek a new trial.
