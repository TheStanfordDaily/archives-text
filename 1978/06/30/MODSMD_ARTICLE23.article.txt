# Bayh's committee hears news-search testimony
## 
### B. Bart Slawson Special to The Stanford Daily 
Washington D.C. — As the Se
nate Judiciary Subcommittee on
the Constitution opened hear
ings June 22 on five bills in
tended to restrict a recent Sup
reme Court decision allowing
police to search for evidence re
levant to criminal cases, oppos
ing forces squared off for a long
struggle over a complex con
stitutional issue.
Birch Bayh, (D-lnd.), chairman
of the Subcommittee on the
Constitution, termed the issue
"as important a constitutional
issue that has come before the
Congress in a long time."
The hearings became the focal
point of the struggle between
press and civil liberties groups
and the Justice Dept., state at
torneys general, district attor
neys and the rest of the law en
forcement community.
At stake is the degree of press
freedom and privacy rights to be
enjoyed by U.S. citizens and re
sidents in the years to come.
The Zurcher vs Stanford Daily
decision handed down May 31 of
this year held that police may
make unannounced searches of
newsrooms, private homes, and
businesses if they believe evi
dence relevant to a criminal case
can be found on the premises.
The five bills aimed at limiting
the decision are:
— Bayh's bill that would pro
hibit the use of federal and state
search warrants at homes and
businesses except in instances
where police fear evidence will
be destroyed if a subpoena is
served.
— A bill introduced by Rep.
Dan Quayle, (R-lnd.), that is
identical to Bayh's.
— A revised version of a bill
submitted by Sen. Robert Dole,
(R-Kan.), that is identical to
Bayh's except that it would mod
ify the federal Criminal Code.
(Bayh's bill would modify the
Civil Rights Act.)

— A bill introduced by Rep.
Robert Drinan, (D-Mass.), limit
ing federal and state searches
against members of the press
not suspected of a crime.
— A bill introduced by Sen.
John Heinz, (R-Pa.), that would
prevent law enforcement offi
cials from engaging in so-called
"fishing expeditions" directed
at news organizations or repor
ters who may have information
relating to a crime.
Testifying before the sub
committee, Philip Haymann of
the Justice Department said the
bills gave too much latitude to
the press, much more than was
intended by the Pramers of the
Constitution.
Sen. William Scott, (R-Va.), a
member of the subcommittee,
agreed. "Determining what the
definition is of print, wire and
broadcast news organizations is
very difficult," he said. "We
have to be careful not to give the
press more latitude than the
Framers of the Constitution in
tended."
Stating his opposition to the
Supreme Court's decision, Bayh
said, "I don't believe that the
proper enforcement by our
criminal law requires that inno
cent Americans surrender their
right to privacy to unannounced
government searches of their
homes or businesses."
Grant Dillman, UPI
Washington Bureau chief,
warned against the Supreme
Court's decision. "This will hit
small and medium-sized media
the hardest. The New York
Times and the Washington Post
can take care of themselves in
any arena because the best
lawyers are available to them,
and they can run their cases in
their own pages. These (small
and medium-sized media) are
staffed by younger Journalists,
and surprise searches could
prove devastating, forcing re
porters to destroy their notes.
Responsible newsgathering re
quires keeping files."
