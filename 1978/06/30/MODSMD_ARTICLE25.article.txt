## theater/karen caesar Price delights in 'Delights' 
### 
Tuesday night, Vincent Price became Oscar
Wilde. In his one-man show at the Geary Theater,
"Diversions and Delights," Price assumes the
character of Wilde, dispensing Wildisms ("Give
me the luxuries of life and I can dispense with the
necessities") and drinking absinthe and pretend
ing that he is the celebrated wit and famed author
of "The Importance of Being Earnest" and that we
are an audience that has come to see him in a
tacky Paris lecture hall in 1899. Only it isn't pre
tending; Price really has us believing he is Wilde.
Surely Wilde's spirit is hovering somewhere
around Mason and Geary Streets. When Price
lowers his voice, a deafening hush falls over the
audience; at his finest moments, Price grabs the
audience by the ears and holds them there,
breathless. Is this the man who has entertained
audiences for years in such delightful epics as
"The Conqueror Worm," "Dr. Goldfoot and the
Bikini Machine," and"The Abominable Dr.
Phibes," to name but a few?
Price is priceless
Yes. But it is also the man who graduated from
Yale and studied art history in London and starred
on Broadway opposite Helen Hayes at the age of
23. Vincent Price is an amazingly versatile actor,
and his reputation as the King of the three a.m.
Channel 2 horror flicks, while well-deserved,
should certainly not precede his reputation as an
immaculately trained artist. His performance in
"Diversions and Delights," is, (forgive me), price
less.
His role is not an easy one. Wilde, who rose to
literary stardom with his plays, poetry, novels and
essays, was an eccentric who died in poverty of a

middle ear disease at the age of 46 in one of the
less privileged sections of Paris. He spent two
years in a British prison after having been tried
and convicted of homosexuality, and was de
nounced and disowned by his wife and children
and all those who had flocked to him in his earlier
years of glory.
'Dirty, drunken, debauched'
Tuesday night, Wilde, who only half-facetiously
described himself as "dirty, drunken, and de
bauched," proceeded to poke fun at America,
Americans, politics, politicians, Britain, Britons,
and a host of other places, people, avocations and
occupations. He wallowed in a sort of proud but
pathetic narcissism ("I was extremely young but
quite brilliant even then," "a customs agent
wanted to know what I had to declare; I told him I
had nothing but my genius," "Do I appear to you
overdressed? Well that's only because I'm im
mensely overeducated . . .")
He even poked fun at those who appraise the
theater: "the artist stands alone . . . well, almost
alone. The critic is always present." Then, later,
"all drama critics can be bought. Well, judging
from their appearance, they can't be very expen
sive."
Price didn't have to buy me or any other person
in that theater. When the show ended, he was
rewarded with a wildly enthusiastic standing ova
tion and hundreds of "Bravo's" bellowed down
from the first and second balconies.

sions and Delights," running through July 9.
