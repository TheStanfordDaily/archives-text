The Buddy Holly Story -trifkit
Fine Arts
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
!: pressive eyebrows are as fine as

any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he also is a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. "The
Buddy Holly Story" could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but its hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we
got right now. Hollywood's finest
offering of the season.
—J.N.

Damien — The Omen II
Guild
The devil wastes his time and
ours herein, as he spends the vast
majority of his energy diddling
with a heap of characters that
could easily have been dis
patched with early on in the ac
tion. He seems kind of dumb,
this particular arch-fiend — a
pretty good sadist, but still kind
of dumb. William Holden gets it
in the end.
—J.N.

laws II
Park
More dying, and less life. More
acting by worse actors. An even
worse plot, and a stiffer shark.
Better than "Orca the Killer
Whale," but not much. Gratuit
ous and boring.
—J.N.
Crease ★★
Old Mill Six
Olivia-Newton-Boring is a blah
actor and John Travolta is a blah
singer. "Crease" was a blah play

dependent on acting and sing
ing. Blah.
—J.N.
Bad News Bear Go To lapan
Old Mill Six
Sequel to "Bad News Bears" and
"Bad News Bears in Breaking
Training"; percursor to "Bad
News Bears Meet Godzilla" and
"Bad News Bears on Drugs." In
this episode the little twerps take
off for Japan, where they fail to
catch even one case of mercury
poisoning. Too bad.
—J.N.
The End
Old Mill Six
A sick plot played sickly. Burt
Reynolds gets in over his head
and tries to yuck-yuck his way
out; each shot he takes gets
cheaper, and he takes every one
he sees. There is nothing inhe
rently the matter with movies that
insult and degrade, but this one
does it as a last resort and is
therefore to be avoided. . ..
—J.N.
The Cheap Detective ★★
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casab
lanca," "To Have and Have Not,"
"The Big Sleep" or "The Maltese
Falcon," some of the subtler
points in this picture will go over
your skull; if you did happen to
catch them then "Cheap" will
thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows
Peter Falk's enjoyable showing,
and it almost keeps you from
realizing how un-Nurse
Ratchett-like Louise Fletcher can
be. Ann-Margret's Rumanian
cleavage is much in evidence.

Old Mill Six
Sequel to "Bad News Bears" and
"Bad News Bears in Breaking
Training"; percursor to "Bad
News Bears Meet Godzilla" and
"Bad News Bears on Drugs." In
this episode the little twerps take
off for Japan, where they fail to
catch even one case of mercury
poisoning. Too bad.

The End
Old Mill Six
A sick plot played sickly. Burt
Reynolds gets in over his head
and tries to yuck-yuck his way
out; each shot he takes gets
cheaper, and he takes every one
he sees. There is nothing inhe
rently the matter with movies that
insult and degrade, but this one
does it as a last resort and is
therefore to be avoided. . ..

The Cheap Detective ★★
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casab
lanca," "To Have and Have Not,"
"The Big Sleep" or "The Maltese
Falcon," some of the subtler
points in this picture will go over
your skull; if you did happen to
catch them then "Cheap" will
thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows
Peter Falk's enjoyable showing,
and it almost keeps you from
realizing how un-Nurse
Ratchett-like Louise Fletcher can
be. Ann-Margret's Rumanian
cleavage is much in evidence.

[<! Any Woody Allen fanatic worth

\> lust what anyone who has
never seen a foreign film would
!; expect a foreign film to be like.
Beautifully acted, with moments
of great poignancy; also badly
edited and heavy on the pathos.
Simone Signoret makes the film
!; worthwhile with her perfor
!; mance as an aging whore — she
; easily overcomes the occasion
s ally dumb dialogue, and often
provides humor at unexpected
;; moments. It is, unfortunately,
; one of them foreign things, but it
Ikinda makes me wish that I had
never dropped French 10.

The Buddy Holly Story -trifkit
Fine Arts
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
!: pressive eyebrows are as fine as

any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he also is a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. "The
Buddy Holly Story" could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but its hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we
got right now. Hollywood's finest
offering of the season.

Damien — The Omen II
Guild
The devil wastes his time and
ours herein, as he spends the vast
majority of his energy diddling
with a heap of characters that
could easily have been dis
patched with early on in the ac
tion. He seems kind of dumb,
this particular arch-fiend — a
pretty good sadist, but still kind
of dumb. William Holden gets it
in the end.
—J.N.

laws II
Park
More dying, and less life. More
acting by worse actors. An even
worse plot, and a stiffer shark.
Better than "Orca the Killer
Whale," but not much. Gratuit
ous and boring.
—J.N.
Crease ★★
Old Mill Six
Olivia-Newton-Boring is a blah
actor and John Travolta is a blah
singer. "Crease" was a blah play

dependent on acting and sing
ing. Blah.
