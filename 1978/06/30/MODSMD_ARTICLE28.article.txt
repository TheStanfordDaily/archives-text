The Drama Department has
not yet completed casting for its
production of "Leonce and
Lena," a comedy in three acts by
Ceorg Buchner that has been
described by some as "a fairy
tale for adults (nothing pornog
raphic implied)." The play will
be directed by Ron Davies, a
PhD candidate here, and will run
August 2 through August 5 and
August 9 through August 12 in
the Nitery.
If you are interested in audi

tioning, merely appear in the Lit
tle Theater (in Memorial Au
ditorium) at 7:30 tonight; no
preparation is necessary. Excel
lent parts are still available for
both men and women. If you
have any questions, call the
drama department, 497-2576.
Davies has also directed
"Scenes from Shakespeare" and
"Festival of Bacchus," by
Schnitzler. He received his B.A.
in Drama at Dartmouth and his
M.A. at the Catholic University

in Washington, D.C., and has
worked in various summer re
pertory companies around the
country.
The sets and costumes for
"Leonce and Lena" will be done
by Prof. Wendell Cole of the
Drama Department. He de
scribes the costumes as being in
the "late fairy tale" style. The
"simultaneous" set includes a
palace and an inn, with an land
scape in between.
