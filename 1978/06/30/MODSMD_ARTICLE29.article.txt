Explosion kills two in Jerusalem
Jerusalem — A powerful explosion ripped
through a crowded open-air market in the Jewish
section of Jerusalem yesterday, just one day be
fore the scheduled arrival in Israel of Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale. Two persons were killed
and 47 wounded, officials said.
The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for the mid-morning blast that blew
apart a vegetable stand at the Mahane Yehuda
market as Israelis were doing their pre-Sabbath
shopping.
A small concrete building was destroyed and
several adjacent stores and sidewalk carts were
damaged.
"An underground squad acting inside oc
cupied Palestine planted the heavy explosive
charge in the Mahane Yehuda vegetables market
in Jerusalem Wednesday morning," a PLO
spokesman said in Beirut.
He said the squad "returned safely to its base
inside occupied territory despite the enemy's
security dragnets."
The PLO spokesman said the attack "em
phasizes the PLO's determination to escalate the
armed struggle against our Zionist enemy from
within."
Newsmen face Moscow hearing
Moscow — The president of the Moscow city
court told two American correspondents today
they face a court hearing July 5 in connection with
articles they wrote about Soviet dissidents.
Craig Whitney of The New York Times and
Harold Piper of The Baltimore Sun met for 15
minutes with the official, L. E. Almazov. Whitney
said they were handed a copy of the charges
against them, which he said were based on arti
cles they wrote suggesting that the televised con
fession of Georgian dissident Zviad Gamsakhur
dia was a fake.
The correspondents said they were told to ap
pear at the courthouse on Friday with written
responses to the charges. They were also told
they could hire Soviet lawyers or could receive
assistance from U.S. Embassy consular officers.
Whitney said Almazov told them the hearing
was postponed for one day, until July 5, in defer
ence to America's July 4 holiday.
Whitney, 34, and Piper, 39, received sum
monses in their Moscow offices Tuesday.
It was the first time in memory that the Soviet
government had ordered American correspon
dents to appear in court as defendants.
Tenants demand benefits
Los Angeles — A coalition of tenants organiza
tions and community groups announced Wed
nesday the launching of a statewide campaign to
get landlords to pass on to renters their property
tax savings under Proposition 13.
"We're backing state legislation that would re
quire landlords to decrease rents as taxes go
down," said Alice Sunshine, spokeswoman for
the Coalition to Roll Back Rents and tenants rights

co-ordinator for the Coalition for Economic Sur
vival.
"The bill would require an 80 percent pass
through of savings," she said. "The renter organi
zations feel there should be a 100 percent pass
through, but we're supporting the legislation
anyway."
The group is also encouraging tenants to form
associations, pass out pamphlets and circulate
petitions to pressure landlords into keeping pre
election promises of passing on their property tax
cuts to renters.
Vietnamese enter Cambodia
Bangkok, Thailand — Thai military sources re
port 60,000 Vietnamese troops in eastern Cam
bodia, and Washington sources say they have
launched a major new offensive in the border war
between the two Communist Indochinese
neighbors.
The Thai sources said the Vietnamese are in the
Parrot's Beak, a slice of Cambodia territory that
juts into southwest Vietnam, and in adjoining
Svay Rieng Province.
U.S. intelligence sources in Washington said
the offensive began in the last two weeks. They
said the Vietnamese have advanced as much as 37
miles inside Cambodia.
This is about twice as far as earlier assaults in the
undeclared war between the two countries,
whose Communist rulers have reverted to the
enmity that has been traditional for centuries be
tween the two peoples.
The Washington sources said the Vietnamese
control Mimot, about six miles inside Cambodia,
and that they are operating around the Chup rub
ber plantation deeper in Cambodia.
Brown's consumer unit hit
Sacramento — The Legislature's budget com
mittee, angered at what it considered misman
agement in Governor Jerry Brown's Consumer
Affairs Department, voted yesterday to grant only
seven months' salary to the department's four top
officials.
Under terms of the 5-1 vote, Director Richard
Spohn and his three top aides would be paid after
next Feb. 1 only if they satisfied the lawmakers
that they have remedied the department's prob
lems.
"They're not doing their job — they're lac
kadaisical," said Assemblyman Dan Boatwright
(D-Concord), who cast the deciding vote. He is
chairman of a two-house conference committee
that is drafting a final legislative version of the
1978-79 state budget.
Today's weather
Patchy low clouds tonight and tomorrow morn
ing but sunny afternoons through tomorrow.
Highs both days in the 70s to low 80s. Overnight
lows in the 50s. Northwest winds to 15 mph in the
afternoons.

"We're backing state legislation that would re
quire landlords to decrease rents as taxes go
down," said Alice Sunshine, spokeswoman for
the Coalition to Roll Back Rents and tenants rights

co-ordinator for the Coalition for Economic Sur
vival.
"The bill would require an 80 percent pass
through of savings," she said. "The renter organi
zations feel there should be a 100 percent pass
through, but we're supporting the legislation
anyway."
The group is also encouraging tenants to form
associations, pass out pamphlets and circulate
petitions to pressure landlords into keeping pre
election promises of passing on their property tax
cuts to renters.
Vietnamese enter Cambodia
Bangkok, Thailand — Thai military sources re
port 60,000 Vietnamese troops in eastern Cam
bodia, and Washington sources say they have
launched a major new offensive in the border war
between the two Communist Indochinese
neighbors.
The Thai sources said the Vietnamese are in the
Parrot's Beak, a slice of Cambodia territory that
juts into southwest Vietnam, and in adjoining
Svay Rieng Province.
U.S. intelligence sources in Washington said
the offensive began in the last two weeks. They
said the Vietnamese have advanced as much as 37
miles inside Cambodia.
This is about twice as far as earlier assaults in the
undeclared war between the two countries,
whose Communist rulers have reverted to the
enmity that has been traditional for centuries be
tween the two peoples.
The Washington sources said the Vietnamese
control Mimot, about six miles inside Cambodia,
and that they are operating around the Chup rub
ber plantation deeper in Cambodia.
Brown's consumer unit hit
Sacramento — The Legislature's budget com
mittee, angered at what it considered misman
agement in Governor Jerry Brown's Consumer
Affairs Department, voted yesterday to grant only
seven months' salary to the department's four top
officials.
Under terms of the 5-1 vote, Director Richard
Spohn and his three top aides would be paid after
next Feb. 1 only if they satisfied the lawmakers
that they have remedied the department's prob
lems.
"They're not doing their job — they're lac
kadaisical," said Assemblyman Dan Boatwright
(D-Concord), who cast the deciding vote. He is
chairman of a two-house conference committee
that is drafting a final legislative version of the
1978-79 state budget.

Explosion kills two in Jerusalem
Jerusalem — A powerful explosion ripped
through a crowded open-air market in the Jewish
section of Jerusalem yesterday, just one day be
fore the scheduled arrival in Israel of Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale. Two persons were killed
and 47 wounded, officials said.
The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for the mid-morning blast that blew
apart a vegetable stand at the Mahane Yehuda
market as Israelis were doing their pre-Sabbath
shopping.
A small concrete building was destroyed and
several adjacent stores and sidewalk carts were
damaged.
"An underground squad acting inside oc
cupied Palestine planted the heavy explosive
charge in the Mahane Yehuda vegetables market
in Jerusalem Wednesday morning," a PLO
spokesman said in Beirut.
He said the squad "returned safely to its base
inside occupied territory despite the enemy's
security dragnets."
The PLO spokesman said the attack "em
phasizes the PLO's determination to escalate the
armed struggle against our Zionist enemy from
within."
Newsmen face Moscow hearing
Moscow — The president of the Moscow city
court told two American correspondents today
they face a court hearing July 5 in connection with
articles they wrote about Soviet dissidents.
Craig Whitney of The New York Times and
Harold Piper of The Baltimore Sun met for 15
minutes with the official, L. E. Almazov. Whitney
said they were handed a copy of the charges
against them, which he said were based on arti
cles they wrote suggesting that the televised con
fession of Georgian dissident Zviad Gamsakhur
dia was a fake.
The correspondents said they were told to ap
pear at the courthouse on Friday with written
responses to the charges. They were also told
they could hire Soviet lawyers or could receive
assistance from U.S. Embassy consular officers.
Whitney said Almazov told them the hearing
was postponed for one day, until July 5, in defer
ence to America's July 4 holiday.
Whitney, 34, and Piper, 39, received sum
monses in their Moscow offices Tuesday.
It was the first time in memory that the Soviet
government had ordered American correspon
dents to appear in court as defendants.
