In a final effort to avoid a
strike, negotiators for Stanford
Hospital and the hospital's regis
tered nurses reached a tentative
agreement on a new contract
Thursday.
The agreement followed a
negotiating session lasting all
day and into the early morning
hours.
The negotiating team, headed
by Linda Simpson, president of
the Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievements
(CRONA), will present the new
agreement to nurses today for
approval. CRONA is the profes
sional association which repre
sents the approximately 900 re
gistered nurses in non
supervisory positions at the
hospital.
CRONA announced its inten
tion last Friday to go out on
strike at 6:45 Sunday morning if
the terms of the new contract
were not settled by then.
Both teams reached agree

ment on all outstanding issues,
according to Ronald Twomey,
director of personnel, who said
the hospital was "very pleased"
with the agreement. "
Peter Fortune, attorney for the
nurses, issued a "no comment."
Both sides have agreed not to
make any statements until after
the nurses vote today. However,
Kathleen Barrett, a CRONA
member, told the Daily yester
day she had taken down all strike
notices posted in the hospital.
"Both sides wanted very much
to try and settle (the remaining
issues)," Twomey commented.
"I cannot praise highly enough
both teams — they worked very
hard." A decisive factor in the
negotiations was that "both
sides were willing to give on is
sues that were important to
them," he said.
Negotiations on a new con
tract between the hospital and
CRONA began April 25. The cur
rent agreement expires today.
