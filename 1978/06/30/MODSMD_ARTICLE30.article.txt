# Bakke unleashes lawsuit torrent
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Dozens of
lawsuits that challenge prog
rams giving preference to racial
minorities as unconstitutionally
discriminatory against whites
are waiting in the wings nowthat
the Supreme Court has decided
the Allan Bakke case.
The "reverse discrimination"
suits attack "affirmative action"
programs in education, gov
ernment and private industry.
And some of the suits' chal
lenge programs giving women
preference in hiring and promo
tions.
Los Angeles County au
thorities seek review of a suc
cessful suit, by members of the
California construction indus
try, that struck down a $4 billion
public works law passed by
Congress last year.
The law earmarked 10 percent
of the money for minority
businesses. That portion of the
bill sparked federal lawsuits by
white-owned businesses in
California, Pennsylvania, In
diana and Montana.

Each claimed the law was un
constitutional because it denied
equal protection to white
owned businesses by establish
ing a racial quota.
A three-judge federal court in
Los Angeles said the law was in
valid and that Congress should
not pass laws similar to it.
The California case was the
first to reach the Supreme
Court.
Also pending before the jus
tices is a challenge to an affirma
tive action program adopted
four years ago by American
Telephone — Telegraph Co. to
end discrimination against wo
men, blacks and others who
often claim they don't get a fair
chance in the job market.
The affirmative action was
challenged by three unions that
claimed it ignored collectively
bargained seniority rights.
The case has been viewed as a
potential major test of the right
of the government, which sued
AT&T in 1973 over employment
bias, to fight discrimination in
private industry.
