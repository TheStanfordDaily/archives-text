# Ruling leaves room for other programs

### 
Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court Wednesday ordered
a California medical school to
admit Allan Bakke, ruling that he
had suffered illegal discrimina
tion because he is white, but
said that race can be taken into
account in future college admis
sions programs.
In a 5-4 decision, the court
held that the University of
Calitornia s medical school at
Davis had gone too far in con
sidering race when it refused to
admit Bakke. But it held that
affirmative-action programs in
tended to benefit minority
applicants can properly be a fac
tor in decisions on admitting
students.
The Court was praised for
"judicial statesmanship" and
condemned for an "absolutely
absurd" decision in the wake of
its ruling.
Bakke successfully sued the
university after his application to
the university's medical school
at Davis was rejected in 1973 and
1974.

program which reserved 16 of
the 100 openings in each enter
ing class for "disadvantaged"
students was really only an im
permissible racial quota.
The Supreme Court in
terpreted the Civil Rights Act of
1964 to say that while some
race-conscious programs are
valid, the program that kept
Bakke out of medical school
crossed the line into illegal racial
discrimination.
Most of the legal experts, civil
rights leaders and academic au
thorities contacted by The As

encouraged by the fact that the
court said race can be taken into
account in future college admis
sion programs.
Like the court itself, however,
the reaction was split over the
issue of racial quotas. The jus
tices issued seven separate opin
ions in connection with the 5-4
LJr. John Tupper, clean of «».«.
UC-Davis medical school,
said, "We will obey the law." He
declined further comment,
pending a review of the deci
sion.
Alan Derschowitz, a law pro
fessor at Harvard University,
said the decision "is an act of
judicial statesmanship . . . that
will go down in history not for
what it did, but for what it didn't
do. It neither legitimized racial
quotas nor put down affirmative
action programs. The decision
will make the job of admissions
offices a lot harder. It will make
them look at people as persons,
not as members of a group and
not as computerized ciphers."
Peter Cohn, co-counsel for
the regional office of the NAACP
in Washington, D.C., said, "I
think this is a very sad day in the
United States. The Bakke deci
sion represents a step back in
time, even though the initial re
port sounds favorable to minor
ity admissions programs," he
said. "To suggest that the . . .
policy of reserving 16 out of 100
places in the enteringclass is un
fair is absolutely absurd."
Merritt Weisinger, a Los
Angeles attorney involved in a
reverse discrimination case at
the University of California
medical school at Davis said the
decision was "self
contradictory" in ruling out
quota systems while allowing
race to be used as a criterion in
admissions. "Anytime you give
points for racial or ethnic origin,
you're keeping somebody else
out," he said.
Weisinger represents Rita
Clancy, a 23-year-old Russian
immigrant, who was admitted
to medical school under
court order last September. In
Sacramento, Gov. lerry Brown
said the University of California
and other institutions will have
to' redouble their minority ad
missions efforts
