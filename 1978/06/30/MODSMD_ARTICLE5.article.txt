## Bakke harm? 
### 
Wednesday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling up
holding the principle of affirmative action while
striking down the University of California's
"quota system" is neither a defeat nora victory for
this nation's vital efforts to achieve a semblance of
racial equality.
While racism undoubtedly continues in our soc
iety, this decision should not be construed as a
shift in that direction. The tendency to overreact
to this decision should be realized and overcome
by opponents of the decision. The ruling does not
mean the death of affirmative action and the
added energy and time universities may spend on
their own programs as a result of the decision will
only serve to improve the quality of such prog
rams.
The most regrettable aspect of the decision is
that it left the door open for further suits against
affirmative action oriented programs in and out of
the educational field. We can only hope that fu
ture Supreme Courts will uphold the principles of
this decision, unlike the present court's poten
tially disastrous attacks on the Miranda rule and
the First Amendment.
It is regrettable that a case of this nature is a
possibility and we sincerely hope that one day
there will be no affirmative action programs to
rule on nor any need for such efforts. But these
programs are vitally necessary in a society in
which the disparity between racial, ethnic and
sexual groups remains shameful.
Allan Bakke is going to attend medical school in
the fall. We only wish he could have been ac
cepted long ago, along with many of the other
qualified applicants of all races for whom there
were not enough places in this country's far too
few medical schools.
