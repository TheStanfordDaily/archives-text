# Make the revolution live

The Fourth of July — with its parades,
fireworks, flags and speeches — is upon us once
again. This year, as in so many years past, the
festivities will result in a show of jubiliation as
great as if the Heavenly Savior were to come
among us on this particular day.
Possibly, though, the Savior's arrival at this time
would be good, for not only is there much to
celebrate, but there is also much which needs to
be saved.
Undoubtedly, the Fourth of July should be a
time of rejoicing, but it must be jubilation tem
pered by remorse. We can rejoice that our coun
try has lasted for more than 200 years, but we must
also have remorse for the millions of war dead —
from the thousands lost during the Revolutionary
War to the 51 lost during the Mayaguez incident.
We can rejoice that we have proven the free
enterprise system, but we must remember that
the largest fortunes in our country were built on
child labor and the sweat of underpaid workers.

We can rejoice that America is in the Age of Afflu
ence, but be dismayed that equality has not
spread to the millions of unemployed who are
disproportionately of racial minorities.
We can rejoice that for 200 years democracy has
succeeded, but feel saddened also that there are
40 million Americans, most of whom poor, who
are alienated and effectively disenfranchised.
And finally, feel rejoice that in our country free
dom has spread, but realize that we have
achieved such independence only as we have
prevented others from having it.
All of this is not to say that the Fourth of July
cannot be a truly festive occasion; I for one plan
on enjoying my day off from work. Rather, it is to
caution against becoming wrapped up in our past
successes, and to thereby miss the opportunity to
reaffirm and revitalize the revoutionary spirit on
which our country was founded.
