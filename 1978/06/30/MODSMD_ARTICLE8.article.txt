Newspaper searches
I have some expertise in the matter of
searching newspaper files: for over seven
years I struggled to locate bits of informa
tion that reporters, officials, agencies and
the general public wanted from the files
of The New York Times. All of this infor
mation was freely and willingly offered as
a public service by the Times.
To deal with everything that has hap
pened since the 1860s requires millions of
files, a sophisticated computer bank, and
a large staff to sort, weed, index and yes,
search.
It's very easy not to find something in
the files of the Times. Even when you've
been handling these files for years and
you know it's there. I once figured out the
probability of finding a paper that had
been misfiled: one in about 28 million. I
had also figured it out in terms of man
hours required to find this hypothetical
scrap of paper: three people working a
full day might sort out 1000 file folders; in
three years they'll have made it through
the first million.
What has this to do with the Supreme
Court decision regarding the police
search of The Stanford Daily? Only this:
the largest news media can't be searched.
Their resources are just too massive. At
the Times I could easily have filed some
thing so that some people could find it
and others couldn't. And this is just deal
ing with paper files; what if the informa
tion sought has been committed into a
computer bank? That can be searched
only by someone who knows passwords,
codes, data entry systems . . . and even
then, one good programmer can foil
another. Not to mention that some data
entry systems have remote terminals by
means of which information can be ac
cessed (duplicated, read or transmitted)
by someone in another part of the coun
try.
Not being well versed in law, I wonder
what happens when the police depart
ment can't perform its search for lack of
manpower or expertise: can skilled
employees be pressed into service? Can

they be then held liable for not finding
something? Probably things will never get
that far . . . yet it seems clear to me that
permission to search newspaper offices
will invariably be directed aginst small,
"local" papers, and most likely those
which have not got a wide base of com
munity support because the national
media can't be searched any more effec
tively than the national government. It
may be there and you may have a court
order, but who knows which cabinet it's
in, which floppy disk it's on?
The Supreme Court decision effec
tively discriminates against small presses,
which need protection the most.

ERA passage
On May 30, Undergraduate Special's
Class 77 (Womens' rights in America — a
Political Perspective), sponsored (along
with the ASSU Guest Professorship
Board) an Equal Rights Amendment
"teach-in." The program was well at
tended, with about 170 people from di
verse backgrounds.
This program and others like it
exemplify the rallying spirit joining be
hind the ratification of the ERA. There are
many areas, legal as well as social, in
which all people will benefit if the ERA is
ratified. Even with the support the ERA
now has, however, the future is shaky.
It is hard for me to believe that any
thinking, concerned person could possi
bly buy the line that Phyllis Schlafly and
others are using. Their arguments center
on such points as the ERA legalizing gay
marriage, the ERA institutionalizing co-ed
bathrooms, and the idea that the 14th
Amendment covers womens' rights.
These arguments are either false or mis
understood.
For example, gay marriages will not be
affected by the ERA. They will be legalized
only when states (or the federal govern
ment) legalizes them by separate laws.
Segregated bathrooms are a matter of in
dividual privacy and will not be changed

to co-ed facilities with the passage of the
ERA. Finally, the 14th Amendment was
never intended specifically to cover wo
mens' rights. It would be without con
stitutional precedent to start deciding
cases based on an amendment that does
not specifically include a certain group.
So why, if their arguments are shaky,
their attitudes unreasonable, and their
rhetoric jaded, do people still listen to the
anti-ERA sloganeers?
The answer, I believe, is fear. Fear of
change, of shaking up the status quo.
Fear of any group that tries to even things
out or to make things a little more equal
for those of us who aren't white upper
class males.
The ERA will serve as a vehicle for both
sexes to start receiving more equal treat
ment. „ ,

Proposition 13
The recent passage of Proposition 13,
the Jarvis-Gann initiative, in California
points out a major flaw in our supposedly
democratic system. While 65 percent of
the state's voters backed the proposal to
cut property taxes, they did not vote for
its consequences. Although local oppo
nents of the amendment had warned of
school and library closures, curtailed
police and fire protection, and aban
donment of old, helpless and poor indi
viduals, many voters opted for the
guaranteed changes written in the bill.
Now that the initiative has passed, its
repercussions are becoming widespread
and affecting millions, many of whom do
not even own property. Los Angeles
County laid off 579 employees, and
Orange County officials proposed a
four-day work week and a 20 percent pay
cut for their employees. Street lighting
and mosquito control will be curtailed in
many districts, as these services were
nearly entirely funded by property taxes
previously.
Worst of all, many cities have been
forced to close their parks and libraries
and school boards across the state are

contemplating massive teacher layoffs.
These latter effects of Proposition 13
are to be most vehemently condemned,
as they represent parallels to Ray Brad
bury's "Fahrenheit 451," in which a soci
ety denied access to knowledge is de
scribed. In effect, we have a situation in
which capitalism and money have taken
priority over the really important as
pects of life.
While Jarvis-Gann itself affects only
Californians, it has set the trend for simi
lar measures in other states.
A more reasonable plan would be
adopted in states allowing ballot in
itiatves, one in which the people vote for
everything, not simply a part, of a prop
osed change. Using Proposition 13 as an
example, the exact consequences of the
tax cut should have been written into the
proposal, rather than only its enticing as
pects. Before such drastic measures are
proposed, government committees
should carefully assess their impact on
existing state and local budgets, making
this information known clearly to the
public in understandable terms.
A special Gallup poll conducted for
Newsweek magazine supports this con
tention. While 57 percent of the public
favored a large tax cut in their states, the
vast majority did not believe that their
communities spend too much on local
services. In the words of Richard Boeth of
Newsweek, the only way to satisfy the
American taxpayer's desire for both
lower taxes and ample services would be
to make government more efficient.
However, even if the above sugges
tions were to come about, the problems
delineated by Proposition 13 would not
be entirely solved. As previously em
phasized, we as a society need to reassess
our priorities. Something is seriously
wrong when we sacrifice education,
health and life itself for personal financial
interests. Our nation and democratic sys
tem were founded with a tea party — let
them not end with one.

they be then held liable for not finding

will invariably be directed aginst small,

This program and others like it

It is hard for me to believe that any

on such points as the ERA legalizing gay
marriage, the ERA institutionalizing co-ed

Amendment covers womens' rights.
These arguments are either false or mis
understood.
For example, gay marriages will not be
affected by the ERA. They will be legalized
only when states (or the federal govern
ment) legalizes them by separate laws.
Segregated bathrooms are a matter of in
dividual privacy and will not be changed

to co-ed facilities with the passage of the
ERA. Finally, the 14th Amendment was
never intended specifically to cover wo
mens' rights. It would be without con

So why, if their arguments are shaky,
their attitudes unreasonable, and their

The answer, I believe, is fear. Fear of

Fear of any group that tries to even things

Proposition 13
The recent passage of Proposition 13,
the Jarvis-Gann initiative, in California
points out a major flaw in our supposedly
democratic system. While 65 percent of
the state's voters backed the proposal to
cut property taxes, they did not vote for
its consequences. Although local oppo
nents of the amendment had warned of
school and library closures, curtailed
police and fire protection, and aban
donment of old, helpless and poor indi
viduals, many voters opted for the
guaranteed changes written in the bill.
Now that the initiative has passed, its
repercussions are becoming widespread
and affecting millions, many of whom do
not even own property. Los Angeles
County laid off 579 employees, and
Orange County officials proposed a
four-day work week and a 20 percent pay
cut for their employees. Street lighting
and mosquito control will be curtailed in
many districts, as these services were
nearly entirely funded by property taxes
previously.
Worst of all, many cities have been
forced to close their parks and libraries
and school boards across the state are

contemplating massive teacher layoffs.
These latter effects of Proposition 13
are to be most vehemently condemned,
as they represent parallels to Ray Brad
bury's "Fahrenheit 451," in which a soci
ety denied access to knowledge is de
scribed. In effect, we have a situation in
which capitalism and money have taken
priority over the really important as
pects of life.
While Jarvis-Gann itself affects only
Californians, it has set the trend for simi
lar measures in other states.
A more reasonable plan would be
adopted in states allowing ballot in
itiatves, one in which the people vote for
everything, not simply a part, of a prop
osed change. Using Proposition 13 as an
example, the exact consequences of the
tax cut should have been written into the
proposal, rather than only its enticing as
pects. Before such drastic measures are
proposed, government committees
should carefully assess their impact on
existing state and local budgets, making
this information known clearly to the
public in understandable terms.
A special Gallup poll conducted for
Newsweek magazine supports this con
tention. While 57 percent of the public
favored a large tax cut in their states, the
vast majority did not believe that their
communities spend too much on local
services. In the words of Richard Boeth of
Newsweek, the only way to satisfy the
American taxpayer's desire for both
lower taxes and ample services would be
to make government more efficient.
However, even if the above sugges
tions were to come about, the problems
delineated by Proposition 13 would not
be entirely solved. As previously em
phasized, we as a society need to reassess
our priorities. Something is seriously
wrong when we sacrifice education,
health and life itself for personal financial
interests. Our nation and democratic sys
tem were founded with a tea party — let
them not end with one.

Newspaper searches
I have some expertise in the matter of
searching newspaper files: for over seven
years I struggled to locate bits of informa
tion that reporters, officials, agencies and
the general public wanted from the files
of The New York Times. All of this infor
mation was freely and willingly offered as
a public service by the Times.
To deal with everything that has hap
pened since the 1860s requires millions of
files, a sophisticated computer bank, and
a large staff to sort, weed, index and yes,
search.
It's very easy not to find something in
the files of the Times. Even when you've
been handling these files for years and
you know it's there. I once figured out the
probability of finding a paper that had
been misfiled: one in about 28 million. I
had also figured it out in terms of man
hours required to find this hypothetical
scrap of paper: three people working a
full day might sort out 1000 file folders; in
three years they'll have made it through
the first million.
What has this to do with the Supreme
Court decision regarding the police
search of The Stanford Daily? Only this:
