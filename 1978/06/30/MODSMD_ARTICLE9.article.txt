# Asbestos poisons millions
## 
### Associated Press 
If Marcos Vela had to get by on the same air the
rest of us breathe, he wouldn't last long. After 35
years of working with asbestos, his lungs are shot
and he has to breathe pure oxygen 16 hours a day.
Vela, 60, spent his working life at the Johns
Manville asbestos products plant at Pittsbu rg east
of Oakland. It was no surprise to him when the
federal government warned in April that millions
may die from working with asbestos over the past
30 years.
Vela knows there's a good chance he is going to
be one of those millions. He knows many of the
men who worked with him at the Pittsburg plant
are already dead.
Asbestos victims die one at a time in scattered
parts of the country. Quietly, no violence, no
headlines. About half the people who worked
with asbestos in the 1940s are expected to die of
asbestos disease. Many are just now showing
symptoms because asbestos diseases almost al
ways take at least 20 to 30 years to show up.
Things have gotten better since the 19405, but
many scientists believe that today's workers are
still breathing too much asbestos. The diseases
killing yesterday's asbestos workers today may
kill today's asbestos workers tomorrow.
There are 3000 businesses that use asbestos in
California plus 40,000 firms that do automobile
brake work with asbestos brake linings. There are
two asbestos mines in the state and more than
half of the nation's asbestos production comes
from California.
Asbestos causes three major diseases. One is
asbestosis, a non-cancerous scarring of the lungs
that gradually makes it harder and harder to
breathe. The other two are cancers — lung cancer
and mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the
stomach or the lung.
Mesothelioma is almost never seen in the gen
eral public but kills nearly one in 10 asbestos
workers. Several other cancers also turn up more
frequently in asbestos workers than in the general
public.
There is no effective treatment for any of the
asbestos diseases. Asbestosis is irreversible. Lung
cancer is rarely cured. Mesothelioma is always
fatal, usually within a few months after the diag
nosis.
Asbestos is such a common material that any
one can breathe the fibers without even realizing
it. Children and wives of asbestos workers have
developed asbestos cancers simply by coming
into contact with clothing of the worker. In ship
yards, insulation workers often stir up enough
asbestos dust to put anyone near them in danger.
The danger comes from breathing asbestos fib
ers, and that generally happens in the work
ingplace — asbestos plants, at mines and mills or
in the process of insulating or removing old insu-

lation at a construction site. Asbestos fibers in
homes — floor tiles and in some acoustic ceilings
— are generally locked inside the product and
don't go into the air unless the ceilings or tiles are
heavily worn.
Vela says he has never smoked a cigarette. "If I
smoked, I wouldn't be alive and talking to you
right now."
He's probably right. Scientists say a person who
works with asbestos and also smokes has 92 times
the chance of dying of lung cancer as a person
who neither smokes nor works with asbestos.
Johns Manville, the nation's leading asbestos
products company, won't allow smoking on the
grounds of any of its asbestos plants.
Scientists seem to be linking an ever-growing
number of products with cancer these days°
based only on experiments with laboratory rats
that were exposed to unusually high concentra
tions of the product. The test animals for asbes
tos, however, have been humans, millions of
them, and they breathed only what asbestos there
was in a normal day's work.
Nobody volunteered for these experiments.
They just went to work, did their jobs and now,
years later, are developing cancers. Many of them
don't know they ever breathed any asbestos.
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano warned in April that about half of
the 8 million to 11 million people who have
worked with asbestos during the past 35 years
may die because of asbestos exposure. Califano
said "the roughest kind of estimate" indicates 1.5
million to 2 million of these people already have
died.
Later this summer, HEW is beginning a massive
nationwide radio, television and pamphlet cam
paign to warn people who may have been ex
posed to asbestos. Paul Van Nevel, associate di
rector of the National Cancer Institute, said the
prupose is to "alert ppople that exposure to as
bestos even for a short period of time a long time
ago may cause health problems."
Although little can be done to treat asbestos
victims, early detection of the diseases can be of
some value.
Van Nevel said HEW has identified 15 areas of
the nation for especially intensive publicity cam
paigns because of the likelihood that potential
asbestos victims may live there. Three of those
areas are in California — San Diego, Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
The Department of Labor estimates about 2
million workers are now exposed to asbestos on
their jobs. Although the government has tried to
cut down the amount of asbestos in the work
place, there is reason to believe these 2 million
people are still breathing too much asbestos.
