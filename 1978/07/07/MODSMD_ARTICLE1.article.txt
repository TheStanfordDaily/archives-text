## Egypt offers new plan 
### 
Cairo, Egypt (AP â€” Egypt un
veiled a new six-point Mideast
peace plan Wednesday calling
for Israeli withdrawal from the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank of
the Jordan River, including East
Jerusalem.
But the main elements of the
plan already have been rejected
by the Israel and Egyptian dip
lomats say they have little hope
for a breakthrough.
Israel radio called the plan
"rigid and reflecting no
change" in President Anwar

Sadat's stand."
Israeli government officials
withheld immediate comment
on the proposal, which also
stipulates Israel must abandon
Jewish settlements built in the
occupied territory.
A decision on whether to
send Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan to London for a meeting
with Egyptian and American of
ficials later this month to dis
cuss the plan probably will not
be made until Sunday's Israeli
cabinet meeting.

Israel has said it will not with
draw from the occupied ter
ritories and will not withdraw
from the occupied territories
and will not give up any of the
settlements there. Even the op
position Labor Party in Israel has
said it would be willing to with
draw only from certain areas of
the West Bank.
The Egyptian plan, prepared
at the urging of the United
States, calls for a five-year trans
itional period during which the
occupied territories will be ad
ministered by "freely elected"
representatives of the Palesti
nian people under the supervi
sion of Jordan on the West Bank
and Egypt in Gaza.
The future of the 1.1 million
Palestinians will be decided
after the transition period.
The plan calls for talks involv
ing Egypt, Jordan, Israel and
"the representatives of the
Palestinian people" with the
participation of the United Na
tions to discuss details of the
transitional government, a
timetable for Israeli withdrawal,
mutual security arrangements,
and any other issues all sides
can agree to discuss.
Delayed pullout
It suggests that only after ag
reement is reached on all these
issues would the Israelis be ex
pected to begin pullout from
the territories captured in the
1967 Mideast war. The present
military government would be
dismantled at the beginning of
the transition period.
Any security arrangements
would be guaranteed by Egypt
and Jordan "and will continue
to be respected in the West
Bank and Gaza." It appeared
