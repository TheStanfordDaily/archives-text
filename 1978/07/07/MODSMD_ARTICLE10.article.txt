# U.S. restricts Soviet press
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — It's a dip
lomat's game of tit-for-tat. Gov
ernments make the moves. Re
porters take the chances.
The United States has played
it with the Soviet Union for 23
years, responding in kind to
Soviet restrictions on U.S. jour
nalists.
It has gone as far as expulsion
of Soviet journalists. And since
1955, nearly one quarter of the
United States has been kept off
limits to them — just as Ameri
can travel is restricted in Russia.
Now a new round is being
played out in the case of Craig
Whitney of The New York Times
and Harold Piper of The Balti
more Sun.
First a slander suit was filed in
Moscow against them. Then,
last week and again Wednes
day, Soviet reporters were cal
led to the State Department and
the White House for "a review
of credentials."
Now State Department offi
cials, speaking privately, say
they are preparing for the next
step by reviewing a number of
ways to retaliate if Whitney and
Piper are judged to have com
mitted slander.
The civil suit, which could re
sult in fines rather than impris
onment, accuses Whitney and
Piper of slandering the Soviet
broadcasting network by report
ing the views of sources who

said film editors had doctored a
dissident's broadcast "confes
sion."
The American officials won't
say what their options are, in
part because they do not know
just what will happen to Whit
ney and Piper.
But it is hardly a new game.
Twice since World War 11, the
State Department has expelled
Soviet correspondents in retali
ation for expulsions of Ameri
cans.
In 16 other cases in which
Moscow expelled American re
porters, there were no re
taliatiatory expulsions. One
reason, an official said, is that
American newspapers and news
agencies feared the Soviets
would close their Moscow
bureaus if the game of tit-for-tat
got out of hand.
But since 1955, when it de
spaired of using reason to per
suade the Soviets to lift restric
tions on American reporters,
the State Department has de
veloped a set of regulations
governing Soviet reporters in
the United States. They seem
draconian to an American, but
the department says they pre
cisely mirror conditions in Mos
cow.
Roughly 23 percent of the
territory in the United States is
"closed" to Soviet journalists,
corresponding to the 27 percent

of the Soviet Union that is off
limits to Americans.
The closed areas are scattered
throughout the country. A few
around defense installations are
closed for security reasons. But
most were chosen, one official
said, "almost by throwing darts
at the map."
The closed areas include such
cities as Las Vegas, Detroit, Dal
las, Winston-Salem, N.C. and
Columbia, S.C., as well as vast
stretches of farmland in the
Great Plains and hundreds of
miles of shoreline.
To travel even to open areas
in the United States, a Soviet
reporter must apply to the State
Department one or two days in
advance. The application must
state how he intends to travel,
who will go with him, which
roads he will use, where he will
make each overnight stop.
The State Department can re
ject any application; in practice,
the officials said, it does so only
when it has a similar Soviet re
jection to retaliate against.
The restrictions remain in
hope that they will prompt
more relaxation by the Soviets,
or at least prevent things from
getting worse. "One of our
chief goals is to improve work
ing conditions for American re
porters in Moscow, and these
restrictions are the only lever
age we have," the official said.
