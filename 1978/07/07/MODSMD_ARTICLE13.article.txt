# Cards lose recruit to Angels
## 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Stanford's football and baseball recruiting ef
forts were dealt a disappointing blow Monday
when Tom Brunansky, one of the Cardinal's top
incoming freshmen, decided in a change of heart
to sign with the California Angels for a bonus in
the $90,000 range.
Brunansky had won All-CIF football honors in
southern California after catching 34 passes for
723 yards and eight touchdowns in his senior
year. And while on the West Cordova High
baseball team, the 6-4, 205 pound centerfielder
hit .470, .496 and .465 during his three varsity
seasons and stole 21 bases this spring.
Brunansky was the No. 1 pick of the Angels
and the 14th man chosen in the june profes
sional draft.
Card football coach Bill Walsh said he was
"surprised" with Brunansky's decision to sign
with the Angels. "I spent a considerable amount
of time with him," Walsh said, "what bothers me
is that he could have gone to Stanford for two
or three years, playing both football and
baseball, and then turned pro. He could have
finished his fourth year of academic work very
easily compared to starting from scratch.
"They (the Angels) are not going to gain that
much by signing bim so early. It's really too bad.
I think it's extremely unfortunate all the way
around."
But the Cards have not lost all the fine talent
scheduled to enter the Farm in the fall. Babe
Laufentberg of Crespi High School in Canoga
Park and Rodney Gilmore from Skyline High
School in Oakland are both baseball and football
recruits hoping to help the Cards out during
more than one season.
These three, along with 11 other incoming
freshmen comprise the core of head baseball
coach Mark Marquess' recruiting efforts.
Among Marguess' other recruits are two

members of Edgewood High School's 1977 CIF
3-A championship team: Loring Davies, a
catcher-first baseman and Mike Toothman, a
centerfielder.
Also joining the Cardinal squad will be pitcher
Alan Leukhardt from North Huntington,
Pennsylvania, shortstop Bob DeCosts from San
Leandro, Craig Campbell (catcher — Bullard
High School), Dave Dacus (outfield — Fox
Chapel High School, Pennsylvania), Brian
Miganao (pitcher — Robert Louis Stevenson
High School), Kevin McClain (outfield — William
Neff High School), Mike Sullivan (pitcher —
Cambell High School), johnny Thaw (second
base — Mount Vernon High School, New York)
and Dave Weber (outfield — Beverly Hills High
School). The most recent recruit is Dave Meir, a
star shortstop from Fesno City College.
The most recent Stanford signees are three of
the nation's most highly-recruited track and field
athletes.
Kurt Roessler of Haverford High School in
Pennsylvania won the prep triple jump champ
ionship with a 50-0 mark and placed in three
other events at the state meet (second in the 330
low hurdles, fourth in the half mile and fourth in
the long jump).
Distance runner Rod Berry of Redwood High
School in Larkspur, California won the two-mile
at the Prep International Meet in Chicago two
weeks ago. He also placed second in the Califor
nia state championships with a time of 8:59.7. He
is one of the West Coast's top cross country
prospects as well.
John Schaer of Crescent Valley High School in
Corvallis, Oregon is the two-time Oregon state
champion in the half mile and will bring his run
ning ability to Stanford in the fall. He also
finished third in the Golden West Invitational
and fifth in the AAU junior nationals this year in
the same event.
