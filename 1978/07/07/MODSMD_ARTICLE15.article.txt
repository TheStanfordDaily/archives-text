On July 1, with the addition
of Arizona State and the Univer
sity of Arizona, the Pacific-8
Conference became not only
the Pacific-10, but also the
strongest athletic conference in
the nation.
The facts are impressive.
The two new members are al
ready athletic powerhouses.
Arizona possesses top-notch
basketball, baseball, water polo
and cross country programs.
Arizona State is an indisputable
football, baseball, track, gym
nastics and golf power. And the
two desert schools will join the
only conference in the nation to
ever win five different NCAA

championships in one year — an
accomplishment the Pac-8 has
achieved for the last nine con
secutive years.
Although both schools are
understandably apprehensive
about facing the caliber of com
petition that the Pac-10 boasts,
they are enjoying the boost the
membership has given to their
recruiting efforts.
"There is no doubt the pre
stige of joining the Pac-10 has
helped our recruiting," said
Arizona football coach Tony Ma
son. "The Arizona schools are
now much more attractive to
West Coast kids who might not
have considered coming here
before."
