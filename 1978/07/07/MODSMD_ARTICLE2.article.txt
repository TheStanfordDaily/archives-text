# Student groups overpaid in fees
## 
### Bill Burner 
Student groups receiving fee
assessments and dorms or
houses collecting their house
dues through fees collected
during registration were the
benefactors of an accounting
oversight which paid them a
total of approximately $9400
throughout the year more than
the amount due them, accord
ing to Philip Curry, administra
tive assistant of residential edu
cation.
The transfer student orienta
tion program was shortchanged
by the General Accounting Of
fice when those fees were inad
vertantly placed in with the
money destined for fee assess
ments and house dues.
The groups receiving fee as
sessments received $3735 more
than they were supposed to and
the houses received the remain
ing $5000 to $6000. Curry said he
didn't know at this time exactly
which of the groups received
more than the amount collected
from the fees.
"We're trying to find a
reasonable course of action to
take at this time," Curry said.
"We'll see how much we can
get back."

I ape said last night the money
probably will not be "re
couped."
While he said it was the "Uni
versity's decision whether they
want it back or not," Lape said
"I don't think there is anything
anybody can do about it right
now. The majority of the groups
(receiving fee assessments)

don't have anything to give back
â€” they've spent it all."
Lape also said that the houses
will not have to pay back any
funds but added that their ac
counts have been frozen until
"the University decides what it
wants to do."
Curry said this past year's
transfer student orientation
program was not affected by the
income loss because the fund
ing operates on a "revolving
basis" which allowed it to oper
ate on funds from the previous
year. Curry said the program is
now short on funds for transfer
orientation scheduled for this
fall.
The summer transfer orienta
tion was unaffected by the ac
counting error.
According to Curry, the ac
counting mistake was brought
to the University's attention
near the end of spring quarter
when a student told him that
the student residence he lived
in "had too much money."
Curry said his office traced
the funds back through the
General Accounting Office to
the registration fee collection.
Lee assessments, house dues
and orientation dues are ac
counted tor in the "other fees '
section of the registering stu
dent's PTRs. Curry said the
transfer orientation fees were
sometimes mixed in with house
dues and tee assessment.
Lape said there would be no
rebates tor houses that have ac
counts "in the black" until the
University decides what action
it will take.
