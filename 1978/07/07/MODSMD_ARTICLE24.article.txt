## rock/laura ost Springsteen: he's still great 
### 
I don't give a damn for the same
old played-out scenes,
I don 't give a damn for lust the
in-betweens,
Honey I want the heart, I want
the soul, I want control . . .
We'll keep push in' 'til it's un
derstood . . .
from "Badlands"
by Bruce Springsteen
Bruce Springsteen told us
three years ago that he was horn
to run, and if last week's
marathon at the San Jose Center
for Performing Arts was a test of
his heart, he's proving it.
Nothing stopped him — not
three electric hours of springing
across the stage on what he cal
led "bionic" knees, not 20-odd
songs with belting raw vocals

Not even the two years he spent
starved of rock's staples - touring and
recording - seem to have spoiled the
tough-yet-tender texture Springsteen
first carved in Asbury Park.

that never lost flavor or energy.
Not even the two years he spent
starved of rock's staples — tour
ing and recording — seem to
have spoiled the tough-yet
tender texture Springsteen first
carved in Asbury Park.
That's New Jersey, not South
ern California; he writes about
back streets, not freeways, and,
as he said between songs, he
has an Italian nose, not a tan.
Zonker wouldn't approve —
Springsteen is definitely not
"mellow" — but Bruce wouldn't
care; he never claimed to be
anyone but himself. Unfortu
nately, the critical compulsion
for comparison has stuck labels
like "The Bob Dylan of the '70s"
on E Street alleys and it isn't
easy to get tape off the walls.
Just after Springsteen's third al
bum, "Born to Run," fired a na
tional spotlight, he sued his
former management for misrep
resentation, among other
things, and spent some two
years mired in legal hassles, un
able to perform or record.
Al, Elvis & Buddy
I could point out that on the
cover of his new album, "Dark
ness on the Edge of Town," he
looks like Al Pacino; when he
rumbled the tune "Fire," which
he shyly introduced as "for the

girls," I thought of Elvis Presley;
his emotional punctuation — a
hypodermic "huh!" — reminds
me of Buddy Holly's famous
"hiccup" . . . but please don't
tell anyone at Columbia Re
cords.
The point is, Springsteen
now, finally, has a chance to
convince remaining doubters, a
category which excludes the
hungry hordes at the San lose
concert, that he needs no addi
tives or artificial sweeteners.
From "Thunder Road" to
"The Promised Land," Springs
teen and his 6-man E Street
Band served a tight balance of
familiar and new material that
asserted his versatility. He was
as moving in a solo piano rendi
tion of "The Promise," written

several years ago, as in the
heart-pounding "Badlands,"
probably the most distinctive
song on the new album (which
reflects a creative fire somewhat
dampened by his enforced vac
ation).
When he wasn't cavorting
with "Big Man" Clarence de
mons, a standout with his red
suit and golden saxophone, he
was whipping out guitar leads
(rare among lead singers) or
wielding a plaintive harmonica.
He saved his best-known roc
kers, "Rosalita" and "Born to
Run," for the wee hours, but, as
he assured one fan, he played
'em all, wearing an expression
that bespoke his enjoyment of
the music itself (not, as so often
happens in the business, preoc
cupation with big money and
long breaks). The major distrac
tions in the performance were
technical: the concert began
some 45 minutes late, and
over-amplification drowned
many of the musical intricacies.
No center aisle?
Springsteen continued to play
himself off-mike; his familiar
rapport with the audience had
him jumping off the stage at one
point to ad-lib in the orchestra,
and commenting on the infam
ous lack of a center aisle in the
Performing Arts Center ("What
do you guys in the middle do if
you have to go to the bath
room?").
Just like most kids, he admit
ted he can be lured home by a
maternal bait of strawberries

(his parents now live in San
Mateo). He acknowledged that
he "stole the ending" of one of
his own songs, "For You," from
an arrangement by Berkeley's
Greg Kihn, another artist who
stubbornly saws against the ac
cepted musical grain. He
clowned with Clemons and
guitarist "Miami" Steve Van
Zandt, "sneaking through the
woods" to the howling of . . .
"at first I thought it was Warren
Zevon," and culminating the
show by dancing on speakers at
either end of the platform —
Clemons on the left and Bruce
on the right. Finally, Springs
teen played dead at center
stage.
But he came back — to one of
many standing ovations — and
the encores went on long after
the main lights came on.
Survival in the soul
Springsteen once wrote, in
Southside Johnny's liner notes,
that "to me, rock'n'roll is all
about . . . music as survival . . .
lived . . . down in (the) soul,
night after night." You can hear
the sweat trickle when he pours
out tales of long, hot nights on
the strip and you can tell he's
got "a head-on collision
smashin' in my guts, man."
His instrumentals are driving,
his lyrics vivid; the crying of
saxophone and harmonica add
to the intensity. Other artists
are starting to hit with Springs
teen material — Patti Smith with
"Because the Night," Robert
Palmer with "Fire," Kihn with
"For You" — which indicates
the current trend toward more
basic, "primitive," if you will,
rock expression, of which
"punk" is the adolescent ex
treme. Witness the phenomenal
popularity of England's "angry
young man," Elvis Costello,
against the fading,
homogenized sound of groups
like the Eagles and the Beach
Boys. It may be that the "FM" or
"progressive" artists are finally
gathering the momentum to
shred the plastic wrapping pro
tecting "AM" or "popular"
music from the agony of a
long-distance life. Freeways,
after all, are only back streets in
designer clothes.
Some day, girl, I don't know
when,
We're gonna get to that place
where we really want to go
And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then, tramps like us,
baby,
We were born to run."

point to ad-lib in the orchestra,
and commenting on the infam
ous lack of a center aisle in the
Performing Arts Center ("What
do you guys in the middle do if
you have to go to the bath
room?").
Just like most kids, he admit
ted he can be lured home by a
maternal bait of strawberries

(his parents now live in San
Mateo). He acknowledged that
he "stole the ending" of one of
his own songs, "For You," from
an arrangement by Berkeley's
Greg Kihn, another artist who
stubbornly saws against the ac
cepted musical grain. He
clowned with Clemons and
guitarist "Miami" Steve Van
Zandt, "sneaking through the
woods" to the howling of . . .
"at first I thought it was Warren
Zevon," and culminating the
show by dancing on speakers at
either end of the platform —
Clemons on the left and Bruce
on the right. Finally, Springs
teen played dead at center
stage.
But he came back — to one of
many standing ovations — and
the encores went on long after
the main lights came on.
Survival in the soul
Springsteen once wrote, in
Southside Johnny's liner notes,
that "to me, rock'n'roll is all
about . . . music as survival . . .
lived . . . down in (the) soul,
night after night." You can hear
the sweat trickle when he pours
out tales of long, hot nights on
the strip and you can tell he's
got "a head-on collision
smashin' in my guts, man."
His instrumentals are driving,
his lyrics vivid; the crying of
saxophone and harmonica add
to the intensity. Other artists
are starting to hit with Springs
teen material — Patti Smith with
"Because the Night," Robert
Palmer with "Fire," Kihn with
"For You" — which indicates
the current trend toward more
basic, "primitive," if you will,
rock expression, of which
"punk" is the adolescent ex
treme. Witness the phenomenal
popularity of England's "angry
young man," Elvis Costello,
against the fading,
homogenized sound of groups
like the Eagles and the Beach
Boys. It may be that the "FM" or
"progressive" artists are finally
gathering the momentum to
shred the plastic wrapping pro
tecting "AM" or "popular"
music from the agony of a
long-distance life. Freeways,
after all, are only back streets in
designer clothes.
Some day, girl, I don't know
when,
We're gonna get to that place
where we really want to go
And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then, tramps like us,
baby,
We were born to run."
from "Born to Run"
by Bruce Springsteen
I don't give a damn for the same
old played-out scenes,
I don 't give a damn for lust the
in-betweens,
Honey I want the heart, I want
the soul, I want control . . .
We'll keep push in' 'til it's un
derstood . . .
from "Badlands"
by Bruce Springsteen
Bruce Springsteen told us
three years ago that he was horn
to run, and if last week's
marathon at the San Jose Center
for Performing Arts was a test of
his heart, he's proving it.
Nothing stopped him — not
three electric hours of springing
across the stage on what he cal
led "bionic" knees, not 20-odd
songs with belting raw vocals

Not even the two years he spent
starved of rock's staples - touring and
recording - seem to have spoiled the
tough-yet-tender texture Springsteen
first carved in Asbury Park.

that never lost flavor or energy.
Not even the two years he spent
starved of rock's staples — tour
ing and recording — seem to
have spoiled the tough-yet
tender texture Springsteen first
carved in Asbury Park.
That's New Jersey, not South
ern California; he writes about
back streets, not freeways, and,
as he said between songs, he
has an Italian nose, not a tan.
Zonker wouldn't approve —
Springsteen is definitely not
"mellow" — but Bruce wouldn't
care; he never claimed to be
anyone but himself. Unfortu
nately, the critical compulsion
for comparison has stuck labels
like "The Bob Dylan of the '70s"
on E Street alleys and it isn't
easy to get tape off the walls.
Just after Springsteen's third al
bum, "Born to Run," fired a na
tional spotlight, he sued his
former management for misrep
resentation, among other
things, and spent some two
years mired in legal hassles, un
able to perform or record.
Al, Elvis & Buddy
I could point out that on the
cover of his new album, "Dark
ness on the Edge of Town," he
looks like Al Pacino; when he
rumbled the tune "Fire," which
he shyly introduced as "for the

girls," I thought of Elvis Presley;
his emotional punctuation — a
hypodermic "huh!" — reminds
me of Buddy Holly's famous
"hiccup" . . . but please don't
tell anyone at Columbia Re
cords.
The point is, Springsteen
now, finally, has a chance to
convince remaining doubters, a
category which excludes the
hungry hordes at the San lose
concert, that he needs no addi
tives or artificial sweeteners.
From "Thunder Road" to
"The Promised Land," Springs
teen and his 6-man E Street
Band served a tight balance of
familiar and new material that
asserted his versatility. He was
as moving in a solo piano rendi
tion of "The Promise," written

several years ago, as in the
heart-pounding "Badlands,"
probably the most distinctive
song on the new album (which
reflects a creative fire somewhat
dampened by his enforced vac
ation).
When he wasn't cavorting
with "Big Man" Clarence de
mons, a standout with his red
suit and golden saxophone, he
was whipping out guitar leads
(rare among lead singers) or
wielding a plaintive harmonica.
He saved his best-known roc
kers, "Rosalita" and "Born to
Run," for the wee hours, but, as
he assured one fan, he played
'em all, wearing an expression
that bespoke his enjoyment of
the music itself (not, as so often
happens in the business, preoc
cupation with big money and
long breaks). The major distrac
tions in the performance were
technical: the concert began
some 45 minutes late, and
over-amplification drowned
many of the musical intricacies.
No center aisle?
Springsteen continued to play
himself off-mike; his familiar
rapport with the audience had
him jumping off the stage at one
point to ad-lib in the orchestra,
and commenting on the infam
ous lack of a center aisle in the
Performing Arts Center ("What
