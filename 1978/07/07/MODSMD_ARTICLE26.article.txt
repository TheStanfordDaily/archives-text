## Fosse fails with 'Chicago' 
### 
IjE lust because Boh Fosse choreographed it and
I directed it and infused it with his soul doesn't
I mean you have to like it.
lust because it lias three of the biggest, most
I talented stars to ever have tapped on a Broadway
I stage doesn't mean it has to be great.
And just because it has won thousands of
I awards, Tony and otherwise, and has been slob-
I bered and raved over by rabid gushing critics
I doesn't mean it is deserving.
Fnough already. I didn't like "Chicago," and
I I'll tell you why.
!. fhe plot is insipid and extremely uninterest
■ ing. A rip-oft from some 19 50s Edward G. Robin
■ son movie, it is supposed to be about an "im-
Ipetuous red-head named Roxie who shoots her
I lover" (and remember this is supposed to be a
| musk al c omedy heavy on the laughs). Instead of
Iheing ostracized or hung, she becomes a
I heroine. Ho-ho.
J 2. Though it is supposed to depict Chicago in
■ the 19205, it could be Berlin in the 19505. We
■ have Mr. Fosse to thank for this, for he has once
"lagain brought along his portable German
■whores. They were in "Cabaret" (the movie) and
H"Pippin" (the play), both of which he choreog-
Hraphed and directed. So of course they are here
Bin "Chicago," slinking and sleazing and sliming
■across the stage doing the requisite number of
Hprlvic thrusts, which is all Mr. Fosse seems to
Hknow how to do these days. There is the obligat-
Hory heavy-handed smattering of sexual sugges
tion in all the moves fosse has his characters do,
gphrre and elsewhere; it is getting very, very tire-
Incidentally, the whores this time aren't all
female. He has men slinking around in pink
tights and high heels, too. In 1920s Chicago, very
fitting and not at all distracting. Sure.
i. The script is about as thin as Fosse's hair,
which is to say, it's hardly there at all. It is the
kind of script where lines like "Oh, shit" and

"What the hell. . and "that bastard . . are
relied upon to be funny and elicit hearty guffaws
from the audience, which they of course do.
Funny, they don't sound like punch lines. Why
do people laugh at them?
4. When Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera are
together on stage, there should be electricity,
there should be fireworks, there should be danc
ing. These are two dancers who have made
Broadway history, yet they are given nothing to
do but slink and sleaze and thrust themselves.
Not only is it boring and repetitious and mildly
revolting, it is a horrendous waste of talent.
5. I would say something about the music, but
I can't seem to recall any of it.
Enough already; you get the picture. This is
one time Bob Fosse doesn't deserve all the
praise. The stuff is all so unoriginal, you wonder
how "Chicago" ever made it to Broadway, let
alone win all those meaningless awards.
There are a few (and only a few) almost-good
things about the play. Chita Rivera can really
sing, as opposed to Gwen Verdon, who can
hardly talk (when she does, she sounds like a
retarted Lucille Ball). Rivera carries the show,
along with super-talented Jerry Ohrbach, who
plays Roxie's fast-talking "mick lawyer," Billy
Flynn. He does one number with Gwen Verdon
on his knee where he is supposed to be the
ventriloquist-lawyer and she is the dummy
defendant who can't speak for herself. It is one
of the better portions of the show.
The staging of the "Chicago," although en
tirely inappropriate, is nevertheless quite pro
vocative. Blinking lights and silver sets and neon
backdrops are all flashes of brilliance in a sea of
tedium. It is just plain too bad the script, music
and dancing don't live up to it all.
So there it is. "Chicago" is one big series of
disappointments, presented by the San Fran
cisco Civic Light Opera and running through Au
gust 5 at the Orpheum Theater.
