## 'Capricorn One' exploits gullibility of U.S. audiences 
### 
Here's a game you can play.
It's called "Would It Surprise
You If." To play you invent
some political statement that
would have sounded startling 10
years ago, and you see it anyone
is shocked by it today. Ready to
Start?
"Would It Surprise You If you
found out that a certain branch
of our government had been
systematically harassing inno
cent citizens?"
"Would It Surprise You If you
found out that your president
had been lying to you all
along?"
Well, probably not too many
eyebrows raised so far. Here's
another:
"Would It Surprise You If you
found out that the most impor
tant event of our recent history
never really happened?"
What event? Do you mean the
moon walk? That's hard to be
lieve, but . . .
Not that moon walk
If you're like most people,
you went along with the ques
tion anyway. And that's pre
cisely the response which the
producers of "Capricorn One"
expect you to have as you pon
der the possibility of the most
fabulous hoax of all time. No,
it's not the historic moon walk
"Capricorn One" is about, it's a
manned voyage to Mars that has

so far not taken place anywhere
but in science fiction. Yet you
probably were attracted by the
question like a fish to the bait.
And therein lies the appeal and
the problem of this film, whose
plot speciously invites audi
ences to distrust everything.
The story may appear sound if
you don't think too hard about
it. As a parody it sometimes
works. The time is the near fu
ture — but not so future as to be
unrecognizable. From what we
learn, the country is populated
by apathetic media junkies who
are led by blase politicians.
And the chief of the nation's
space program (Hal Holbrook)
knows that unless his Mars
flight can instill some new
idealism into everyone, those
materialistic politicians are
going to scrap his whole prog
ram. So when he discovers a
safety flaw in the rocket life
support system, what does he
do? Does he postpone the
blast-off and get the thing fixed?
No, indeed. He simply abducts
the astronauts, regretfully asks
them to appear in a fake Mars
landing staged for TV cameras,
and then modestly tells them
that if they refuse, he'll have
their wives and kiddies blown
up. You see, scientists can be
very zealous, especially when
their funding is at stake.

All goes as planned. The roc
ket is launched into space while
the three astronauts — whom
everone presumes to be on
board — are ushered into a sec
ret television studio. When the
day of the Mars landing comes,
the astronaut TV stars play their
parts admirably, grandiloquent
statements about Mankind and
all. Unfortunately several
weeks later, on its return to
Earth, the rocket burns up. It
doesn't take our astronauts very
long to figure out that their
reappearance in living form
might spoil the scenario, and
that they'd better run for their
lives.
From there on, the plot
moves with the swiftness and
palpitation of a good adventure.
But there's also a detective story
unfolding, as one outsider be
comes suspicious enough to
sniff out the incredible hoax.
It's Elliott Gould, a specialist at
playing hardboiled, disgruntled
types, this time cast as a nearly
washed-up newspaperman who
stumbles on to the truth.
The astronauts (lames Brolin,
Sam Waterston, O.J. Simpson)
are a spirited bunch who never
let a good wisecrack slip out of
their grip; their lines sound like
Woody Allen had written them,
and while I doubt that real-live
astronauts are quite so witty,

these three are certainly right
for film.
And special credit goes to the
stunt and special effects people
for some of the most hair
raising aerial work you'll ever
see on film.
Most dubious
But in the end, what can you
say about a film which builds a
rollercoaster of thrills, per
sonalities and smart dialogue
over the most dubious of foun
dations?
The question is, does it do
any good to have a sinister gov
ernment agency as the villain of
the intrigue?
Presumably, the makers of
the film are warning us of the
ruthlessness of power and offer
ing, as a more reliable value, the
bravery, individualism and un
flagging good humor of Could,
Brolin and associates. But that's
too easy. A moment's thought
will reveal that it is just as mis
leading to suggest that
everyone in power is lazy, cor
rupt or insane as to suggest that
everyone in power is virtuous.
As tempting as it is to see
"Capricorn One" strictly as an
adventure yarn, there's no get
ting away from the implications
of its plot. And in fact, "Cap
ricorn One" rather self
importantly asks to be seen as a
comment on society. But if the

makers of this film had any seri
ous intentions, they would have
taken a little more care.
Whereas a film like "All the
President's Men" — equally a
sort of detective story — takes
pains to establish the workings
of a conspiracy, "Capricorn
One" merely exploits our wil
lingness to believe in the possi
bility of such things, an easy
thing to do in an age of Water
gate hearings, CIA probes, and
mysteriously defunct Warren
Commission witnesses. In this
film, the government is nothing
but a villain, like the
gangsters, psychopaths and
enemy agents of earlier movies.
And while it's easy to accept
such stock villains as a part of
conventional film magic, it is
somehow disturbing to watch a
movie in which U.S. armed
forces are sent out to hunt
down and systematically kill
fugitive astronauts.
The makers of this film would
like to have the adventure and
the parody without taking any
responsibility for asking audi
ences to believe the worst, but
they can't have it both ways.
And the partial success of "Cap
ricorn One" suggests that what
Hollywood does well, it does
smashingly, and that what it
does thoughtlessly, it passes off
with a cynical shrug.

would have sounded startling 10
years ago, and you see it anyone
is shocked by it today. Ready to
Start?
"Would It Surprise You If you
found out that a certain branch
of our government had been
systematically harassing inno
cent citizens?"
"Would It Surprise You If you
found out that your president
had been lying to you all
along?"
Well, probably not too many
eyebrows raised so far. Here's
another:
"Would It Surprise You If you
found out that the most impor
tant event of our recent history
never really happened?"
What event? Do you mean the
moon walk? That's hard to be
lieve, but . . .
Not that moon walk
If you're like most people,
you went along with the ques
tion anyway. And that's pre
cisely the response which the
producers of "Capricorn One"
expect you to have as you pon
der the possibility of the most
fabulous hoax of all time. No,
it's not the historic moon walk
"Capricorn One" is about, it's a
manned voyage to Mars that has

so far not taken place anywhere
but in science fiction. Yet you
probably were attracted by the
question like a fish to the bait.
And therein lies the appeal and
the problem of this film, whose
plot speciously invites audi
ences to distrust everything.
The story may appear sound if
you don't think too hard about
it. As a parody it sometimes
works. The time is the near fu
ture — but not so future as to be
unrecognizable. From what we
learn, the country is populated
by apathetic media junkies who
are led by blase politicians.
And the chief of the nation's
space program (Hal Holbrook)
knows that unless his Mars
flight can instill some new
idealism into everyone, those
materialistic politicians are
going to scrap his whole prog
ram. So when he discovers a
safety flaw in the rocket life
support system, what does he
do? Does he postpone the
blast-off and get the thing fixed?
No, indeed. He simply abducts
the astronauts, regretfully asks
them to appear in a fake Mars
landing staged for TV cameras,
and then modestly tells them
that if they refuse, he'll have
their wives and kiddies blown
up. You see, scientists can be
very zealous, especially when
their funding is at stake.

All goes as planned. The roc
ket is launched into space while
the three astronauts — whom
everone presumes to be on
board — are ushered into a sec
ret television studio. When the
day of the Mars landing comes,
the astronaut TV stars play their
parts admirably, grandiloquent
statements about Mankind and
all. Unfortunately several
weeks later, on its return to
Earth, the rocket burns up. It
doesn't take our astronauts very
long to figure out that their
reappearance in living form
might spoil the scenario, and
that they'd better run for their
lives.
From there on, the plot
moves with the swiftness and
palpitation of a good adventure.
But there's also a detective story
unfolding, as one outsider be
comes suspicious enough to
sniff out the incredible hoax.
It's Elliott Gould, a specialist at
playing hardboiled, disgruntled
types, this time cast as a nearly
washed-up newspaperman who
stumbles on to the truth.
The astronauts (lames Brolin,
Sam Waterston, O.J. Simpson)
are a spirited bunch who never
let a good wisecrack slip out of
their grip; their lines sound like
Woody Allen had written them,
and while I doubt that real-live
astronauts are quite so witty,

these three are certainly right
for film.
And special credit goes to the
stunt and special effects people
for some of the most hair
raising aerial work you'll ever
see on film.
Most dubious
But in the end, what can you
say about a film which builds a
rollercoaster of thrills, per
sonalities and smart dialogue
over the most dubious of foun
dations?
The question is, does it do
any good to have a sinister gov
ernment agency as the villain of
the intrigue?
Presumably, the makers of
the film are warning us of the
ruthlessness of power and offer
ing, as a more reliable value, the
bravery, individualism and un
flagging good humor of Could,
Brolin and associates. But that's
too easy. A moment's thought
will reveal that it is just as mis
leading to suggest that
everyone in power is lazy, cor
rupt or insane as to suggest that
everyone in power is virtuous.
As tempting as it is to see
"Capricorn One" strictly as an
adventure yarn, there's no get
ting away from the implications
of its plot. And in fact, "Cap
ricorn One" rather self
importantly asks to be seen as a
comment on society. But if the

makers of this film had any seri
ous intentions, they would have
taken a little more care.
Whereas a film like "All the
President's Men" — equally a
sort of detective story — takes
pains to establish the workings
of a conspiracy, "Capricorn
One" merely exploits our wil
lingness to believe in the possi
bility of such things, an easy
thing to do in an age of Water
gate hearings, CIA probes, and
mysteriously defunct Warren
Commission witnesses. In this
film, the government is nothing
but a villain, like the
gangsters, psychopaths and
enemy agents of earlier movies.
And while it's easy to accept
such stock villains as a part of
conventional film magic, it is
somehow disturbing to watch a
movie in which U.S. armed
forces are sent out to hunt
down and systematically kill
fugitive astronauts.
The makers of this film would
like to have the adventure and
the parody without taking any
responsibility for asking audi
ences to believe the worst, but
they can't have it both ways.
And the partial success of "Cap
ricorn One" suggests that what
Hollywood does well, it does
smashingly, and that what it
does thoughtlessly, it passes off
with a cynical shrug.
