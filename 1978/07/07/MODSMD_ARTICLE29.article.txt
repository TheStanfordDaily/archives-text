New Varsity
When the spouses of two acquain
tences consumate an affair back in
the bushes at a large family, the cuc
kolds first console each other, then
become good friends and finally em
bark upon the ultimate revenge, a
"counter-affair." However, instead of
being deceitful and secretive like
their unfaithful mates, the pro
tagonists are openly honest in their
adultery. In doing so they romp
through the hypocritical morays of
polite bourgeois society and its tacit
prescription for conducting infidel
ity. The film is bright, matuce, and a
lot of vicarious fun. The wholesome
ness of the heroes is a little distract
ing though. It seems really too bad
that they weren't married to each
other in the first place and also hard
to believe that they aren't having sex
for the normal reason but just to
prove a point. With Small Change.

Small Change ••••
Saturday-Monday, July 8-10
New Varsity
France is very proud of its precoci
ous little children. French cinema can
make worthwhile films about them
without making them hug big dogs or
become Satan's little darling. So
when Fellini released "Amartord" Fr
ance's honor was threatened. But
with "Small Change" Truffaut proves
that French brats are cuter than Ita
lian brats. Truffaut's remarkable suc
cess with children is nothing new.
His first feature film, "The 400 Blows"
remains one of the finest "child's eye
view" films. "Freshness" and "clar
ity" are the usual descriptions of his
style, its just that he's able to show
the impishness and innocence of the
little world without trying to make us
snicker at sex and excrement pranks,
like Fellini or cause cancer in Cana
dian rats like Disney. "Small Change"

is an entertaining though episodic
collection of the antics of a bunch of
kids who have a good time inspite of
and often at the expense of the big,
bumbling world of adults. With
Counsin, Cousine.

F.I.S.T. *•
Millbrae
Employ's "The Godfather" films'
scope but lacks their depth. This
story of the epic rise and fall of a
union leader reminds one especially
of the Michael Corleone section of
"Godfather II"; to excess, in fact. The
Congressional hearings and the mur
ders from that film are unabashedly
— and in comparison, badly — im
itated here.
The director, Norman Jewison,
asks the audience to accept way too
much, and he also fails to give the
film any sense of consistently believ
able passion or tension. His surface
approach to the material is the film's
biggest liability. What the movie de
sperately needed was a director with
sociological (and artistic) insight; i.e.,
someone like Francis Ford Coppola.
The film is kept from becoming
abysmal by Sylvester Stallone's gal
vanic, if uneven, performance as
Johnny Kovacs, member and eventu
ally leader, of F.I.S.T. (Federation of
Interstate Truckers). His performance
contains the film's only moments of
passion. These moments only serve
to heighten the remainder of the
film's frustrating somberness and
emotional emptiness.

An Unmarried Woman *•**
Biograph
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and
Tonto") warm and intelligent look at
70s divorce. Jill Clayburgh finally
gets a role which is equal to her ta
lent, and she doesn't disappoint.
The film is a bit slow in its middle
third, where the are some very weak

scenes with a therapist. However, in
general the film is comic and affect
ing without being cruel or sac
charine, Alan Bates stands out in a
fine supporting cast. With 7% Solu
tion.

Casablanca *****
Friday, |une 9
Festival
Very obscure film, but you should
see it. After all, you're part of his
work, the thing that keeps him going.
If this movie leaves the Varsity and
you're not on it you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomor
row, but soon, and for the rest of
your life. With To Have and Have Not.

The Buddy Holly Story •«««
Fine Arts
Gary Busey's upper lip and expres
sive eyebrows are as fine as any in the
business; his showing as Buddy Holly
makes this picture worthwhile. Busey
can sing, too, and he also is a marvel
ously idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the end
he holds it all together. "The Buddy
Holly Story" could have been better,
and that's no hooey, but its hard to
imagine a finer hick superstar than
the one we got right now. Hol
lywood's finest offering of the sea
son.

Saturday Night Fever
Moffett 3
No nutritional value. Also very
good. A dopey plot and only one real
actor and stupid dialogue — pure
schlock — but still a damn good film
and you should see it. Even though
John Travolta makes a fool of himself
every week on TV he is a legitimate
star here; as the best disco dancer in
the entire one-mile radius of this pic
ture he gives power to what other
wise would have been awful. No one
will blame you if you loathe, despise,

detest and abhor this picture because
of its unrepentant dumbness; still, if
you scoff too loudly at followers we
are liable to punch you in the nose.

Madame Rosa **"
Aquarius twin
Just what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy
on the pathos. Simone Signoret
makes the film worthwhile with her
performance as an aging whore —
she easily overcomes the occasion
ally dumb dialogue, and often pro
vides humor at unexpected mo
ments. It is, unfortunately, one of
them foreign things, but it kinda
makes me wish that I had never
dropped French 10. With Dear Detec
tive.

Damien — The Omen II
Guild
The devil wastes his time and ours
herein, as he spends the vast majority
of his energy diddling with a heap of
characters that oculd easily have
been dispatched with early on in the
action. He seems kind of dumb, this
particular arch-fiend — a pretty good
sadist, but still kind of dumb. William
Holden gets it in the end.
-J.N.
The End
Old Mill Six
A sick plot played sickly. Burt
Reynolds gets in over his head and
tries to yuck-yuck his way out; each
shot he takes gets cheaper, and he
takes every one he sees. There is no
thing inherently the matter with
movies that insult and degrade, but
this one does it as a last resort and is
therefore to be avoided.
—J.N.

The Cheap Detective **
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big
Sleep" or "The Maltese Falcon,"
some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al
most keeps you from realizing how
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise
Fletcher can be. Ann-Margret's
Rumanian cleavage is much in evi
dence.
—Bill Burger
laws II
Park
More dying, and less life. More act
ing by worse actors. An even worse
plot, and a stiffer shark. Better than
"Orca the Killer Whale," but not
much. Gratuitous and boring. With
Roy Scheider, Lorraine Grey and
Murray Hamilton; without Richard
Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw.
—J.N.
Bad News Bears Go To lapan
Old Mill Six
Sequel to "Bad News Bears" and
"Bad News Bears in Breaking Train
ing"; percursor to "Bad News Bears
Meet Godzilla" and "Bad News Bears
on Drugs." In this episode the little
twerps take off for lapan, where they
fail to catch even one case of mercury
poisoning. Too bad.
—J.N.
Close Encounters of the
Third Kind •*•••
Menlo 3
Steven Spielberg's wonderfully
childlike fantasy about man's first
meeting with extraterrestial beings.
Spielberg is clearly indebted to
Hitchcock, but in all the right ways,
and he has the youthful exuberance
that Hitchcock lost about four de
cades ago. The unfortunate thing
about "Close Encounters" is that it
came so soon after "Star Wars," a
situation which provokes unneces
sary and misleading comparisons be
tween the two.
—R.L.
It Happened One Night •••••
Festival Theater, |uly 6-12
This '34 Columbia Pictures picture
took five awards in the first sweep in
Oscar history: Best Picture, Best Di
rector (Frank Capra), Best Actor
(Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette
Colbert), and Best Screenplay
(Robert Ruskin). What's more, they
deserved it. Resourceful Gable ch
ases around after obnoxious Colbert,
and they manage what could be the
beginning of a beautiful relationship.
The script is improvisational, anar
chistic, and very good. With 20th
Century.

Twentieth Century
Festival Theater, |uly 6-12
Oscar laffe (John Barrymore) runs
up against Lily Garland (Carole Lom
bard); he sets out to make her a star,
and ends up making her a star (and a
concubine). They have a lotta great
fights, and he attempts to re-woo her
on the 20th Century Limited train ride
— there we get the title of this pic
ture. Voila. With It Happened One
Night.
