# Egyptians, here, upset with Begin

Egyptian officials visiting Stan
ford were upset by Israel's re
jection of President Anwar
Sadat's latest peace proposals.
The group consisted of Nabil
Hamdy, the Egyptian consul
general in San Francisco; Mak
ram Ebeid, chairman of Egypt's
opposition Liberal Party; Mrs.
Laila Takla, an attorney and
head of Egypt's Foreign Rela
tions Commission; and Fikry-
Mkram-Ebeid, an Egyptian parli
ament member.
Ambassador Ashrof Chorbal
was scheduled to attend, but
had to cancel after the peace
proposals prompted a flood of
questions elsewhere.
Those who did attend said
that the prospects of a Middle
East peace could be clouded
"for years to come" by Israel's
recent actions.
Ebeid said that despite his
party's criticism of Sadat's re
gime through the Egyptian
newspaper El Ahram, the party
was solidly behind the peace
overtures just made.
He reviewed the 10-point
program offered by Sadat, in
volving a return of the Gaza
Strip and the west bank of the
Jordan River, and restoration of
the Palestinian homeland, all of
which were to be supervised by
a U.N. commission and local
Palestinian councils.
The plan could have been
worked out in five years, he
said, if it had received joint
support from Israel, Jordan,
Egypt and the Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO). Takla
claimed that "President Sadat
believes that security is not in
building fences, but in opening
doors," and she argued that Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin recognizes only "security
by force."
"We are not against Jews, but
we are against Zionists, which is
a very different thing," said
Ebid.
Takla went on to condemn
President jimmy Carter for not
recognizing that "Palestinians
are people, too, while raising
the banner of human rights."
While the delegates were
pleased by what they described
as a "reversal in the American
public's attitude" toward the
Arab position, they added that
"at the same time you refuse to
open a dialogue with the Pales
tinians, who are the real vic tims

of the situation."
Takla said that "there is a
great misconception of who the
Palestinians are. They are not a
group of terrorists. They are an
institution.
"The United States has an ob
ligation to recognize their
legitimate rights, and to ap
proach the moderates of the
PLO when Arab-Israeli propos
als are made."
She warned that the United
States should not "squeeze"
Palestine "up against the wail,
because when a person is
squeezed against a wall he must
fight back."
Nonsupport and nonrecogni
tion of the PLO — "99 percent
of whom are Palestinians" —
are costing Carter his credibil
ity, said Takla.
