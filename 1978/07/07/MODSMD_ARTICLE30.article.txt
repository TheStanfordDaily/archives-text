# 'the buddy holly story' /john nielsen
## An excellent performance on thin ice 
### 
Understatement, simplicity,
restraint — these are the great
strengths of "The Buddy Holly
Story" at the same time they are
its weaknesses. At its best this
movie has a good-natured po
tency that goes right to the
heart of its subject, yet at its les
ser moments it has the opposite
effect. At its worst "Holly"
wastes a near-perfect perfor
mance by the actor in the lead
ing role, and it fails to answer
several questions it had obli
gated itself to address.
Lubbock
It is, in short, one of those
"lines! movies of the summer."
In "Holly" Gary Buseyrecreates
the rise to stardom of a Lub
bock, Texas hick superstar; he
does it by giving us a character
whose slightest mannerisms
seem to be the source of his
power. When Holly sings you
can see in his moves the be
ginnings of thousand of more
recently famous on-stage man
uevers. This spontaneity makes
Busey appealing in much the
same way Holly must have
been. On stage and off Busey's
Buddy Holly charm is the kinci
ot (harm shown by a maniac
convinced of his talent, one
convinced that his calling in life
is to maniacally and, whenever
possible, politely go about his
business. His performances are
simply extensions of that per
sonality, except that the ferocity
is closer to the surface.
Busey's Buddy
And you can see in Busey's
performance why Holly wasn't
satistied playing country music.
No need to purposefully play
the country stuff with a little less
skill here, or to make a point of
botching one of the Inirmonies
— Busey's face while he sings is
proof enough that he'll never
be at home. He looks cramped,
and out of his element, and it
follows easily when he can't re
sist the temptation to do a little
be-bop during that opening
scene at the roller rink.
And that opening scene
serves as a good example of
what this picture has to offer. It
treats a conventional subject
conventionally, and consciously
avoids making too much of it
sell, and this lack of pretention
works to its advantage. We
know how significant it is when
Buddy loosens his tie for the
first time, and we saw it coming
a mile away, but we can still
enjoy it because the movie al
lows us to notice it on our own,

without announcing "the sig
nificance."
It is much the same with the
effect of that first fast tune. The
roller skates keep the thing in
perspective, and we are free to
enjoy the horror-stricken pa
rents and suddenly rock-crazed
kids without wondering
whether the director is making
too much of his opportunity.
But it has more than that as well
— at its best it manages to play
both sides off each other,
achieving something of a
cinematic razor edge. And
again, Gary Busey is magnifi
cent. He, too, deals conven
tionally with those themes tradi
tionally associated with both fic
tion and non fiction "fame
movies," and he is successful,
as before, because he is able to

root his every big move in one
of them Lubbock mannerisms.
Almost nothing he does seems
stale or contrived, even when it
is stale and contrived. He can
tell a producer that "it doesn't
sound like the sound in my
head," and get away with it, and
he can listen to a nearly-serious
comparison of his music and
Beethoven's without seeming a
fool. His character says dumb
things from time to time, but he
knows it when he does, and
Busey manages to deliver each
of those lines with a twist of the
lip or tone sufficient to inform
us that he knows whereof he
speakes.
Busey makes this movie, and
this is particularly true towards
the end. There he's all we've
got. There the directoral ten

dency to shy away from over
statement becomes an attempt
to steer this movie clear of any
sort of difficult or complex
theme. For example, the rela
tionship between Buddy Holly
and the Black musicians and
music he rooted his work in is
used dramatically, and to great
effect, but it is also used
simplistically. Race in any movie
is an impossibly complex issue,
and"The Buddy Holly Story"
the situation is no different, but
these are not grounds for leach
ing off a theme. The director ob

ligated himself to comment on
the issue, and then attempted
to pass it over. And here it isn't
the same as passing over a
cliche, or avoiding a dumb line.
In a way the avoidance of such
questions is a cliche of its own,
one that is far more painful to
see than any of its more aesthe
tic relatives.
Marriage
The second half of "Holly" is
dominated by Buddy's mar
riage, and the effect of his mar
riage on his music, and here
they make the same mistake
again. Complexities of character
are hinted at and then swept
under the carpet, and this in
turn results in a made-for-TV
atmosphere. There is no exami
nation of the pressures of Hol
ly's work as they relate to his
homelife, no closer look at the
driving forces that busey em
bodies so convincingly. The pic
ture simply jumps back and
forth from the household to
Holly's increasingly strained re
lationship with his two bass
player and drummer, making no
connections, asking no ques
tions, providing us with a movie
that increasingly appears to be
all prologue.
And it will of course be ar
gued, in light of the finish of
this picture, that that was just
the point. There is sense in in
sisting that we should leave feel
ing that there was much un
finished business, wondering
what might have happened had
Holly's career ended in a diffe
rent way than it did.
lust in time
But that's not what this movie
leaves us with. The end,
cinematically, comes just in
time, as it becomes all too evi
dent by then that this picture
has lost its bearings. Towards
the end we begin to wonder if
even Busey can keep the thing
afloat much longer, if the finest
performance thus far this year
can keep a movie that offers so
much early on from running it
self into the ground.
And he does, but I don't think
that he could have kept it up for
long.

Understatement, simplicity,

strengths of "The Buddy Holly

connections, asking no ques

that increasingly appears to be
all prologue.
And it will of course be ar
gued, in light of the finish of
this picture, that that was just
the point. There is sense in in

ing that there was much un
finished business, wondering
what might have happened had
Holly's career ended in a diffe
rent way than it did.
lust in time
But that's not what this movie
leaves us with. The end,
cinematically, comes just in
time, as it becomes all too evi
dent by then that this picture
has lost its bearings. Towards
the end we begin to wonder if
even Busey can keep the thing
afloat much longer, if the finest
performance thus far this year
can keep a movie that offers so
much early on from running it
self into the ground.
And he does, but I don't think
that he could have kept it up for
long.

Understatement, simplicity,
restraint — these are the great
strengths of "The Buddy Holly
Story" at the same time they are
its weaknesses. At its best this
movie has a good-natured po
tency that goes right to the
heart of its subject, yet at its les
ser moments it has the opposite
effect. At its worst "Holly"
wastes a near-perfect perfor
mance by the actor in the lead
ing role, and it fails to answer
several questions it had obli
gated itself to address.
Lubbock
It is, in short, one of those
"lines! movies of the summer."
In "Holly" Gary Buseyrecreates
the rise to stardom of a Lub
bock, Texas hick superstar; he
does it by giving us a character
whose slightest mannerisms
seem to be the source of his
power. When Holly sings you
can see in his moves the be
ginnings of thousand of more
recently famous on-stage man
uevers. This spontaneity makes
Busey appealing in much the
same way Holly must have
been. On stage and off Busey's
Buddy Holly charm is the kinci
ot (harm shown by a maniac
convinced of his talent, one
convinced that his calling in life
is to maniacally and, whenever
possible, politely go about his
business. His performances are
simply extensions of that per
sonality, except that the ferocity
is closer to the surface.
Busey's Buddy
And you can see in Busey's
performance why Holly wasn't
satistied playing country music.
No need to purposefully play
the country stuff with a little less
skill here, or to make a point of
botching one of the Inirmonies
— Busey's face while he sings is
proof enough that he'll never
be at home. He looks cramped,
and out of his element, and it
follows easily when he can't re
sist the temptation to do a little
be-bop during that opening
scene at the roller rink.
And that opening scene
serves as a good example of
what this picture has to offer. It
treats a conventional subject
conventionally, and consciously
avoids making too much of it
sell, and this lack of pretention
works to its advantage. We
know how significant it is when
Buddy loosens his tie for the
first time, and we saw it coming
a mile away, but we can still
enjoy it because the movie al
lows us to notice it on our own,

without announcing "the sig
nificance."
It is much the same with the
effect of that first fast tune. The
roller skates keep the thing in
perspective, and we are free to
enjoy the horror-stricken pa
rents and suddenly rock-crazed
kids without wondering
whether the director is making
too much of his opportunity.
But it has more than that as well
— at its best it manages to play
both sides off each other,
achieving something of a
cinematic razor edge. And
again, Gary Busey is magnifi
cent. He, too, deals conven
tionally with those themes tradi
tionally associated with both fic
tion and non fiction "fame
movies," and he is successful,
as before, because he is able to

root his every big move in one
of them Lubbock mannerisms.
Almost nothing he does seems
stale or contrived, even when it
is stale and contrived. He can
tell a producer that "it doesn't
sound like the sound in my
head," and get away with it, and
he can listen to a nearly-serious
comparison of his music and
Beethoven's without seeming a
fool. His character says dumb
things from time to time, but he
knows it when he does, and
Busey manages to deliver each
of those lines with a twist of the
lip or tone sufficient to inform
us that he knows whereof he
speakes.
Busey makes this movie, and
this is particularly true towards
the end. There he's all we've
got. There the directoral ten

dency to shy away from over
statement becomes an attempt
to steer this movie clear of any
sort of difficult or complex
theme. For example, the rela
tionship between Buddy Holly
and the Black musicians and
music he rooted his work in is
used dramatically, and to great
effect, but it is also used
simplistically. Race in any movie
is an impossibly complex issue,
and"The Buddy Holly Story"
the situation is no different, but
these are not grounds for leach
ing off a theme. The director ob

ligated himself to comment on
the issue, and then attempted
to pass it over. And here it isn't
the same as passing over a
cliche, or avoiding a dumb line.
In a way the avoidance of such
questions is a cliche of its own,
one that is far more painful to
see than any of its more aesthe
tic relatives.
Marriage
The second half of "Holly" is
dominated by Buddy's mar
riage, and the effect of his mar
riage on his music, and here
they make the same mistake
again. Complexities of character
are hinted at and then swept
under the carpet, and this in
turn results in a made-for-TV
atmosphere. There is no exami
nation of the pressures of Hol
ly's work as they relate to his
homelife, no closer look at the
driving forces that busey em
bodies so convincingly. The pic
ture simply jumps back and
forth from the household to
Holly's increasingly strained re
lationship with his two bass
player and drummer, making no
connections, asking no ques
tions, providing us with a movie
that increasingly appears to be
all prologue.
And it will of course be ar
