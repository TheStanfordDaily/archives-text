Bell found in contempt
New York — Attorney General Griffin Bell was found in contempt
of court yesterday for defying a federal judge's order to disclose
files on 18 FBI informers. Bell immediately appealed for a stay, and
a hearing was scheduled for today.
The judge took the action after being told Bell had no intention
of obeying an order to disclose files of 18 FBI informants to lawyers
for the Socialist Workers Party.
Bell could be fined or imprisoned under the contempt finding,
but U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, who issued the ruling, took
no action to punish Bell.
Bell's request for a stay will be heard today by Judge Murray
Gurfein of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
The Supreme Court had refused to review the case, but the
Justice Department says that was only because the case was not yet
far enough along. Bell persisted in withholding the documents on
grounds that a contempt order would provide the basis for an
appeal.
Israel's warning to Syria
Beirut, Lebanon — Israel sent seven warplanes screaming over the
battered heart of Beirut yesterday in a show of force and clear
warning to Syria to ease its stranglehold on the city's hemmed-in
Christians.
The United States was reported trying to mediate an end to the
bloody Syrian-Christian fighting in the Lebanese capital.
In Washington, the White House issued a statement by President
Carter calling for a cease-fire, saying the fighting "adds to the
hatred and suffering accumulated over several years of tragedy in
Lebanon."
The Israeli jets roared in from the sea at rooftop-level after
hundreds of Syrian rockets set the Christian half of the city aflame
in the sixth day of a Syrian siege aimed at subduing the
independent-minded Christian militias.
Frugal state budget approved
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown yesterday signed a $14.7 billion
state budget, trimmed by $1.5 billion since tax revolt leader How
ard Jarvis' Proposition 13 was approved by voters.
The budget was $10.6 million less than last year, a net decrease of
one-fifteenth of 1 percent.
"This is the first time in 17 years that the budget has gone down,
rather than up," Brown said after signing the bill.
The Democratic governor vetoed 2V2 percent pay raises for
224,000 state employees and 2Vi percent welfare grant increases for
1.4 million parents and children on Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
He left untouched 3.7 percent grant increases for 700,000 aged,
blind and disabled Californians.
The most controversial item in the budget, Brown's request for
$34 million to pay for abortions for an estimated 101,000 low in
come women, was slashed to $11 million'by anti-abortion lawmak
ers before the budget was sent to Brown.
Brown left the remaining abortion funds untouched, along with
the strict limitations imposed b/ the Legislature.
Van Houten convicted again
Los Angeles — Leslie Van Houteri, the high school homecoming
princess who became a disciple of mass murderer Charles Manson,
was found guilty again Wednesday of first-degree murder and
conspiracy in the 1969 Tate-Laßianca killings.
It was the third time that the 28-year-old Van Houten had been
tried for the murders that shocked the world.
One of her trials ended in a hung jury last year. But Wednesday's
conviction affirmed the original verdict by a jury which convicted
her along with Manson and two other women in 1971.
That verdict was overturned by an appeals court which ruled Van
Houten had been denied adequate legal representation after her
lawyer, Ronald Hughes, died during a camping trip during the final
stages of the trial.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer immediately ordered Van
Houten returned to prison and set her sentencing for July 21. She
had been free during the trial on $200,000 bail, but Ringer revoked
that.

Israel's warning to Syria
Beirut, Lebanon — Israel sent seven warplanes screaming over the
battered heart of Beirut yesterday in a show of force and clear
warning to Syria to ease its stranglehold on the city's hemmed-in
Christians.
The United States was reported trying to mediate an end to the
bloody Syrian-Christian fighting in the Lebanese capital.
In Washington, the White House issued a statement by President
Carter calling for a cease-fire, saying the fighting "adds to the
hatred and suffering accumulated over several years of tragedy in
Lebanon."
The Israeli jets roared in from the sea at rooftop-level after
hundreds of Syrian rockets set the Christian half of the city aflame
in the sixth day of a Syrian siege aimed at subduing the
independent-minded Christian militias.
Frugal state budget approved
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown yesterday signed a $14.7 billion
state budget, trimmed by $1.5 billion since tax revolt leader How
ard Jarvis' Proposition 13 was approved by voters.
The budget was $10.6 million less than last year, a net decrease of
one-fifteenth of 1 percent.
"This is the first time in 17 years that the budget has gone down,
rather than up," Brown said after signing the bill.
The Democratic governor vetoed 2V2 percent pay raises for
224,000 state employees and 2Vi percent welfare grant increases for
1.4 million parents and children on Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
He left untouched 3.7 percent grant increases for 700,000 aged,
blind and disabled Californians.
The most controversial item in the budget, Brown's request for
$34 million to pay for abortions for an estimated 101,000 low in
come women, was slashed to $11 million'by anti-abortion lawmak
ers before the budget was sent to Brown.
Brown left the remaining abortion funds untouched, along with
the strict limitations imposed b/ the Legislature.
Van Houten convicted again
Los Angeles — Leslie Van Houteri, the high school homecoming
princess who became a disciple of mass murderer Charles Manson,
was found guilty again Wednesday of first-degree murder and
conspiracy in the 1969 Tate-Laßianca killings.
It was the third time that the 28-year-old Van Houten had been
tried for the murders that shocked the world.
One of her trials ended in a hung jury last year. But Wednesday's
conviction affirmed the original verdict by a jury which convicted
her along with Manson and two other women in 1971.
That verdict was overturned by an appeals court which ruled Van
Houten had been denied adequate legal representation after her
lawyer, Ronald Hughes, died during a camping trip during the final
stages of the trial.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer immediately ordered Van
Houten returned to prison and set her sentencing for July 21. She
had been free during the trial on $200,000 bail, but Ringer revoked
that.

Bell found in contempt
New York — Attorney General Griffin Bell was found in contempt
of court yesterday for defying a federal judge's order to disclose
files on 18 FBI informers. Bell immediately appealed for a stay, and
a hearing was scheduled for today.
The judge took the action after being told Bell had no intention
of obeying an order to disclose files of 18 FBI informants to lawyers
for the Socialist Workers Party.
Bell could be fined or imprisoned under the contempt finding,
but U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, who issued the ruling, took
no action to punish Bell.
Bell's request for a stay will be heard today by Judge Murray
Gurfein of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
The Supreme Court had refused to review the case, but the
Justice Department says that was only because the case was not yet
far enough along. Bell persisted in withholding the documents on
grounds that a contempt order would provide the basis for an
appeal.
