# Nurses OK contract
## 
### 
Registered nurses at the Stan
ford Hospital have reached final
agreement on a two-year con
tract with hospital adminis
trators.
The nurses, represented by
CRONA (Committee for the
Recognition of Nursing
Achievements), settled on a
contract that provides for a 7
percent wage increase for the
first year and an additional 7
percent adjustment the follow
ing year.
CRONA and the hospital
began bargaining April 25. Ten
tative agreement was reached
june 29, and an overwhelming
majority of nurses ratified the
final pact the next day.
The nurses had announced
their intention to go on strike if
an agreement were not reached
by July 2.
They had been dissatisfied by
handling of negotiations by the
hospital — it was described by
CRONA member Kathleen Bar
nett as "a random-type thing"
— and by a lack of discussion of
salaries and retirement prog
rams until nearly a month into
the negotiations.
CRONA further favored an
"agency shop," with a mandat
ory CRONA service charge for

all nurses, on the theory that all
nurses benefit by CRONA's ac
tions.
The hospital opposed the
stipulation that nurses refusing
to pay be fired. Once the early
tentative settlement was
reached, the notice to strike
was withdrawn.
After settling, the hospital
and CRONA issued a joint
statement describing the con
tract as reflecting "a proper ba
lance between the parties' de
sire to reward and support the
excellent performance by the
nurses and at the same time re

spond to concerns with health
care costs."
CRONA said it was pleased
with the course of negotiations
and the agreement, and is anxi
ous to take advantage of the
hospital's willingness to open
channels of communication
further.
Hospital officials praised the
nurses for the manner in which
they carried out their duties
during the notice period, and
for their offer to work with the
hospital to care for critically ill
patients in the event of a strike.
