No otherwise qualified hand

States . . . shall, solely by
reason of his handicap, be
excluded from participation in,
be denied benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity
receiving Federal financial assis
tance.
—section 504,
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973
The Stanford Hospital is work
ing hard to keep up with section
504. As part of a University-wide
program to aid disabled stu
dents, visitors and employees,
the hospital is continuing with
extensive efforts to make itself
more accessible.
If that sounds strange — the
idea of a hospital being a dif
ficult place for the handicapped
to get around — keep in mind
that "there really weren't any
obstacles" in the tirst place. So
says Bill Snyder, trom the Med
Center News Bureau.
Snyder explained that
facilities such as the wailing
areas, restrooms and phone
booths were designed at a time
when such things were done for
"a majority of people.
"Things have changed since

then," he said, "and opinions
have changed."
The hospital, then, is not so
much remedying "wrongs" as it
is making refinements of its
facilities.
And, according to Hospital
Planner and Architect Richard
Pierce, $37,000 has been spent
during the last two years to
carry out these improvements.
To aid the deaf and blind and
to aid those confined to wheel
chairs:
— restrooms in the clinic
areas in the Boswell and Ed
wards buildings have been fit
ted with free swinging doors,
and stalls and fixtures have
been modified to make wheel
chair access easier;
— ramps have been placed
from the sidewalk to the street:
and
— telephones have been
lowered, and extra volume con
trols have been installed tor
deat persons.
In addition, the hospital is
preparing to install automatic
doors in the rear of the clink
and is investigating the feasibil
ity ot lowered drinking foun
tains, lowered buttons in
elevators and braille numbeiing
on elevator panels.
