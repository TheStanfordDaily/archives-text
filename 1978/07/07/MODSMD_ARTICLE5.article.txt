(At Princeton this year, the
controversy over South African
investments was marked by
both demonstrations and sit
ins, and a substantial segment
of the study body along with a
number of faculty members cal
led on the university to refuse to
buy or hold securities of com
panies doing business in South
Africa. Below are excerpts from
the Princeton trustees' re
sponse.)
Apartheid is morally repug
nant; it has caused great suffer
ing; it contradicts our most
fundamental beliefs concerning
relationships among people of
different races; it offends our
sense of human rights. In all
discussions of South Africa, and
in every communication on this
subject, the University has
clearly and emphatically op
posed apartheid.
The University has stated its
belief that companies doing
business in South Africa should
take action to ensure equal
employment opportunity and
improved standards of living for
black workers, including the es
tablishment of minimum wages
at fair levels. . . .
We have had serious reserva
tions concerning the desirability
of "new starts" or additional net
new investment in South Africa
by U.S. companies, and in one
recent instance (Union Carbide)
have decied to respond to a
proxy resolution by recom
mending against further expan
sion in South Africa under pre
sent conditions. . . .
As a matter of general policy,
the University has not recom
mended that the companies in
which we hold stock withdraw
from South Africa.
On this last question, the
strbngly conflicting views of
people united in their opposi
tion to apartheid, in and out of
South Africa, suggest that one
should be skeptical about any
claim to confidence in assessing
the ultimate effects of com
panies' staying or leaving.
Our decision not to urge
withdrawal as a general proposi
tion has been and continues to
be based less on a clear convic
tion that it is best for companies
to remain in South Africa than
on the complicated nature of
the issue and the lack of any
persuasive evidence that under
current conditions withdrawal
would be clearly beneficial.
. . . We recognize that "sym
bolic" effects are what many of
those proposing general disin
vestment chiefly seek to
achieve. But we are not per
suaded that a symbolic gesture
of this kind — a one-time action
of very limited practical impact
— would be seen by people
generally as an effective or
reasoned expression of opin
ion.
Nor do we believe that such
an action by Princeton would
have any lasting effect on public
opinion. In addition, it is by no
means clear that the role of the
University is to take actions for
the purpose of achieving an ef
fect of this kind.
This purely moral dimension
of an act of disinvestment must
also be considered carefully.
We recognize that some who
advocate disinvestment see
such an action as a way of
eliminating any connection,
even an indirect one, between
the University and the present
policies of the South African
government.
We are not persuaded, how
ever, that disinvestment would
achieve this goal, and we also

believe that such an action
would in itself create serious
moral problems — raising sig
nificant issues of fairness and
consistency — quite apart from
its effects on the ability of the
University to pursue its central
purposes.
The kind of purity which is
sought is not attainable simply
by selling stock in those com
panies with affiliates or sub
sidiaries in South Africa. There
are, for example, many other
companies which have impor
tant trade relations with South
Africa but which do not have af
filiates or subsidiaries there.
In addition, there are other
linkages. It is not simply earn
ings on endowment, but also
other sources of revenue that
are traceable in some degree to
companies or individuals with
ties of one kind or another to
South Africa.
Thus, if we were to consider,
as an objective, the elimination
of all linkages to South Atrica,
and were to pursue this objec
tive for moral reasons, we
would have to recognize that a
focus on disinvestment alone is
artificial and partial.
. . . While the likely effects on
American companies and on
South Africa are unclear at best
and almost certainly minimal,
the effects on Princeton would
be dramatic and clearly nega
tive. . . .
What is involved here is not a
simple choice between high
moral principles and the pursuit
of economic gain. In the setting
of a nonprofit institution char
tered to pursue educational
purposes, financial resources
are never an end but only the
means used to pursue larger ob
jectives.
Thus, there is an inescapable
moral obligation to weigh care
fully, consciously and conscien
tiously what may be conflicting
obligations — specifically to
compare (a) the effects of disin
vestment on the University's
long-term ability to contribute
to the general welfare through
the students it educates and the
scholarship it supports, against
(b) whatever positive contribu
tion to racial justice one be
lieves will follow from purging
the University's investment ac
count of stocks of companies
that do some small part of their
business in South Africa,

Apartheid is morally repug
nant; it has caused great suffer
ing; it contradicts our most
fundamental beliefs concerning
relationships among people of
different races; it offends our
sense of human rights. In all
discussions of South Africa, and
in every communication on this
subject, the University has
clearly and emphatically op
posed apartheid.
The University has stated its
belief that companies doing
business in South Africa should
take action to ensure equal
employment opportunity and
improved standards of living for
black workers, including the es
tablishment of minimum wages
at fair levels. . . .
We have had serious reserva
tions concerning the desirability
of "new starts" or additional net
new investment in South Africa
by U.S. companies, and in one
recent instance (Union Carbide)
have decied to respond to a
proxy resolution by recom
mending against further expan
sion in South Africa under pre
sent conditions. . . .
As a matter of general policy,
the University has not recom
mended that the companies in
which we hold stock withdraw
from South Africa.
On this last question, the
strbngly conflicting views of
people united in their opposi
tion to apartheid, in and out of
South Africa, suggest that one
should be skeptical about any
claim to confidence in assessing
the ultimate effects of com
panies' staying or leaving.
Our decision not to urge
withdrawal as a general proposi
tion has been and continues to
be based less on a clear convic
tion that it is best for companies
to remain in South Africa than
on the complicated nature of
the issue and the lack of any
persuasive evidence that under
current conditions withdrawal
would be clearly beneficial.
. . . We recognize that "sym
bolic" effects are what many of
those proposing general disin
vestment chiefly seek to
achieve. But we are not per
suaded that a symbolic gesture
of this kind — a one-time action
of very limited practical impact
— would be seen by people
generally as an effective or
reasoned expression of opin
ion.
Nor do we believe that such
an action by Princeton would
have any lasting effect on public
opinion. In addition, it is by no
means clear that the role of the
University is to take actions for
the purpose of achieving an ef
fect of this kind.
This purely moral dimension
of an act of disinvestment must
also be considered carefully.
We recognize that some who
advocate disinvestment see
such an action as a way of
eliminating any connection,
even an indirect one, between
the University and the present
policies of the South African
government.
We are not persuaded, how
ever, that disinvestment would
achieve this goal, and we also

believe that such an action
would in itself create serious
moral problems — raising sig
nificant issues of fairness and
consistency — quite apart from
its effects on the ability of the
University to pursue its central
purposes.
The kind of purity which is
sought is not attainable simply
by selling stock in those com
panies with affiliates or sub
sidiaries in South Africa. There
are, for example, many other
companies which have impor
tant trade relations with South
Africa but which do not have af
filiates or subsidiaries there.
In addition, there are other
linkages. It is not simply earn
ings on endowment, but also
other sources of revenue that
are traceable in some degree to
companies or individuals with
ties of one kind or another to
South Africa.
Thus, if we were to consider,
as an objective, the elimination
of all linkages to South Atrica,
and were to pursue this objec
tive for moral reasons, we
would have to recognize that a
focus on disinvestment alone is
artificial and partial.
. . . While the likely effects on
American companies and on
South Africa are unclear at best
and almost certainly minimal,
the effects on Princeton would
be dramatic and clearly nega
tive. . . .
What is involved here is not a
simple choice between high
moral principles and the pursuit
of economic gain. In the setting
of a nonprofit institution char
tered to pursue educational
purposes, financial resources
are never an end but only the
means used to pursue larger ob
jectives.
Thus, there is an inescapable
moral obligation to weigh care
fully, consciously and conscien
tiously what may be conflicting
obligations — specifically to
compare (a) the effects of disin
vestment on the University's
long-term ability to contribute
to the general welfare through
the students it educates and the
scholarship it supports, against
(b) whatever positive contribu
tion to racial justice one be
lieves will follow from purging
the University's investment ac
count of stocks of companies
that do some small part of their
business in South Africa,

Princeton trustees

(At Princeton this year, the
controversy over South African
investments was marked by
both demonstrations and sit
ins, and a substantial segment
of the study body along with a
number of faculty members cal
led on the university to refuse to
buy or hold securities of com
panies doing business in South
Africa. Below are excerpts from
the Princeton trustees' re
