# Zionists need love, too

Judging from the rather force
ful statements of a Palestinian
speaker on campus in May, the
face which the Palestine na
tional liberation movement pre
sents to Americans has not
changed substantially in the
past two years.
This is disturbing because the
eyesight of this otherwise noble
face is regrettably myopic. A de
finite, critical asymmetry such
as this deserves explicit recogni
tion.
In some respects the Palesti
nian perception is ironically un
canny. The movement, at least
as embodied in the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO),
and its legitimating parliament,
the Palestine National Council,
is of course well aware of the
oppression and sufferings of
the Palestinian people, and it
knows too well of long years of
attempting in vain to gain a fair
hearing in the world commun
ity.
It further understands
Zionism — also a national liber
ation movement — can, in es
tablishing (or restoring) a home
land for the Jewish people,
paradoxically sometimes dis
criminate coldly against non-
Jews who also claim rights in the
Holy Land.
Non-penetrating vision
But the clear vision of this
people seemingly cannot
penetrate far beyond its imme

dite experience. The flaw is cru
cial: there is no understanding
(of the meaning which Israel
can have to Zionists, nor any
appreciation) of the validity
which Zionism (in turn) can
have to Jews.
To the Palestinian spokes
people, Zionism — an ideology
to which literally millions of
people have a puzzling, ypt
deep attachment — has no re
deeming social value, no posi
tive aspects whatsoever.
This view is a serious short
coming because it arrests the
long walk towards peace. p or
how can anyone negotiate with
an adversary (or neighbor)
without even the most basic
common ground, namely an
understanding of the other's
frame of reference? (Or, for the
ruthlessly tactical: How can you
beat the Zionists if you are not
able, at times, to think like
one!)
Ignorance is bliss
The Palestinian leadership
seems to be singularly unwilling
to find out where a Zionist is
coming from. If ignorance is
bliss, it's not even the ignorance
which disturbs me so much as
the bliss — the unwillingness
even to listen.
But permit me to try and point
out a few salient aspects of what
a Palestinian would call the
"Zionist problem" (There is a
lesson here. Now I realize how
repulsive the common phrase
"Palestinian problem" must
sound to Palestinians!).
The Palestinian argument is
especially lopsided where the
persistence with which it cries
for national liberation bears a
simultaneous denial that the
Jews also have that right. It
maintains simply that the Jews
are not a nationality. But some
Jews are willing to fight and die
for "national liberation."
All of which has led me to ask,
"What makes a nation?" I found
an answer in a basic political
science textbook on ideologies
which, incidentally, hardly even
mentions Zionism.
Definition
Basically, a nation is a sizeable
group of people which feels
some mutual attachment and
decides to call itself a nation,
and behaves like a nation.
It's a peculiarly appropriate
circular definition. No other
criterion — common language,
history, political, religious, or
cultural destiny — is sufficient

to differentiate all the recog
nized nations of today.
To those who still don't be
lieve that the Palestinians exist, I
will point out that this charac
terization is as true for Palesti
nian Arabs as it is for jews. And
to the Palestinians I say: after
being considered "non
existent" for so long, why do
you jump so qu>cW\\/ to return
the favor?
But why do people want to be
Zionists anyway? To give )us\ a
taste of the meaning which
Zionism has had (Caution: I
cannot overemphasize that
there has never been a
monolithic Zionist ideology!):
an activist might say that s/he is
fostering a transcendental
commitment to social justice by
building a base, a homeland, for
the mission.
Messianic vein
There is a strong messianic
vein in Judaism — associating
the Holy Land with divine im
manence, love and redemption
— which manifests itself in two
ways: as a Utopian optimism
and as a deep emotional at
tachment to the land.
From a more secular perspec
tive, Israel functions as a center
of Jewish learning and culture.
Others point with pride to the
primal role of the labor move
ment in constructing both the
society and the state.
Last on this abbreviated list is
the conviction of those who
have reckoned with the difficul
ties of either trying to assimilate
or to express Jewish identity in a
larger culture, and have de
cided that personal fulfillment is
best approached by living in a
Jewish society.
Zionists need love, too. I have
occasionally found stunning
parallels between the two liber
ation movements (not very flat
tering to either side, I know!).
In other words, the differences
in basic viewpoint may not be as
great as each group supposes.
At the risk of unmercifully
overworking my metaphor, let
me just say that, often, myopia
is not apparent to the individual
who has it; therefore it must be
diagnosed by another. No, my
eyes are not too clear either,
but I hope that together, if we
keep talking, we can work out
something for our mutual be
nefit.

you jump so qu>cW\\/ to return
the favor?
But why do people want to be
Zionists anyway? To give )us\ a
taste of the meaning which
Zionism has had (Caution: I
cannot overemphasize that
there has never been a
monolithic Zionist ideology!):
an activist might say that s/he is
fostering a transcendental
commitment to social justice by
building a base, a homeland, for
the mission.
Messianic vein
There is a strong messianic
vein in Judaism — associating
the Holy Land with divine im
manence, love and redemption
— which manifests itself in two
ways: as a Utopian optimism
and as a deep emotional at
tachment to the land.
From a more secular perspec
tive, Israel functions as a center
of Jewish learning and culture.
Others point with pride to the
primal role of the labor move
ment in constructing both the
society and the state.
Last on this abbreviated list is
the conviction of those who
have reckoned with the difficul
ties of either trying to assimilate
or to express Jewish identity in a
larger culture, and have de
cided that personal fulfillment is
best approached by living in a
Jewish society.
Zionists need love, too. I have
occasionally found stunning
parallels between the two liber
ation movements (not very flat
tering to either side, I know!).
In other words, the differences
in basic viewpoint may not be as
great as each group supposes.
At the risk of unmercifully
overworking my metaphor, let
me just say that, often, myopia
is not apparent to the individual
who has it; therefore it must be
diagnosed by another. No, my
eyes are not too clear either,
but I hope that together, if we
keep talking, we can work out
something for our mutual be
nefit.

Judging from the rather force
ful statements of a Palestinian
speaker on campus in May, the
face which the Palestine na
tional liberation movement pre
sents to Americans has not
changed substantially in the
past two years.
This is disturbing because the
eyesight of this otherwise noble
face is regrettably myopic. A de
finite, critical asymmetry such
as this deserves explicit recogni
tion.
In some respects the Palesti
nian perception is ironically un
canny. The movement, at least
as embodied in the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO),
and its legitimating parliament,
the Palestine National Council,
is of course well aware of the
oppression and sufferings of
the Palestinian people, and it
knows too well of long years of
attempting in vain to gain a fair
hearing in the world commun
ity.
It further understands
Zionism — also a national liber
ation movement — can, in es
tablishing (or restoring) a home
land for the Jewish people,
paradoxically sometimes dis
criminate coldly against non-
Jews who also claim rights in the
Holy Land.
Non-penetrating vision
But the clear vision of this
people seemingly cannot
penetrate far beyond its imme

dite experience. The flaw is cru
cial: there is no understanding
(of the meaning which Israel
can have to Zionists, nor any
appreciation) of the validity
which Zionism (in turn) can
have to Jews.
To the Palestinian spokes
people, Zionism — an ideology
to which literally millions of
people have a puzzling, ypt
deep attachment — has no re
deeming social value, no posi
tive aspects whatsoever.
This view is a serious short
coming because it arrests the
long walk towards peace. p or
how can anyone negotiate with
an adversary (or neighbor)
without even the most basic
common ground, namely an
understanding of the other's
frame of reference? (Or, for the
ruthlessly tactical: How can you
beat the Zionists if you are not
able, at times, to think like
one!)
Ignorance is bliss
The Palestinian leadership
seems to be singularly unwilling
to find out where a Zionist is
coming from. If ignorance is
bliss, it's not even the ignorance
which disturbs me so much as
the bliss — the unwillingness
even to listen.
But permit me to try and point
out a few salient aspects of what
a Palestinian would call the
"Zionist problem" (There is a
lesson here. Now I realize how
repulsive the common phrase
"Palestinian problem" must
sound to Palestinians!).
The Palestinian argument is
especially lopsided where the
persistence with which it cries
for national liberation bears a
simultaneous denial that the
Jews also have that right. It
maintains simply that the Jews
are not a nationality. But some
Jews are willing to fight and die
for "national liberation."
All of which has led me to ask,
"What makes a nation?" I found
an answer in a basic political
science textbook on ideologies
which, incidentally, hardly even
mentions Zionism.
Definition
Basically, a nation is a sizeable
group of people which feels
some mutual attachment and
decides to call itself a nation,
and behaves like a nation.
It's a peculiarly appropriate
circular definition. No other
criterion — common language,
history, political, religious, or
cultural destiny — is sufficient

to differentiate all the recog
nized nations of today.
To those who still don't be
lieve that the Palestinians exist, I
will point out that this charac
terization is as true for Palesti
nian Arabs as it is for jews. And
to the Palestinians I say: after
being considered "non
existent" for so long, why do
you jump so qu>cW\\/ to return
the favor?
But why do people want to be
Zionists anyway? To give )us\ a
