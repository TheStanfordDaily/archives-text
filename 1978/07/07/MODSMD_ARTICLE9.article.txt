# Frost Amphitheater to receive face-lift
## 
### David Sokale 
Rehabilitation of Frost Am
phitheater, including the instal
lation of a new eight-foot fence,
is now being carried out.
Used for little besides com
mencement exercises in its
early days, the 40-year-old facil
ity has become the scene of
rock concerts, symphony or
chestras, picnics and a variety of
activities.
These factors, as well as ero
sion and drought, have caused
such wear and tear over the
years that preventative mainte
nance measures must be taken
to preserve Frost's unique qual
ity, according to Steve Schmidt,
associate planner in Facilities
Planning. A master plan has
been developed with the aid of
a consultant to eliminate the
facility's problems and in
adequacies.
To this end, construction has
begun on the new eight-foot
fence around the base of the
amphitheater. The new fence
will replace the existing smaller
fence around the top of the am
phitheater, which has been in

effective in keeping out persons
who climb the outside banks,
causing erosion and damage to
trees and shrubs.
The main entrance ramp, op
posite Galvez St.and Campus
Dr., will be regraded to allow
use by those in wheelchairs,
who will also be able to use the
rest room without any special
assistance, Schmidt said.
Five smaller gates will be con
structed to replace the current
two gates to facilitate easy
movement. The new gates will
be "bike proof."
The new fence will be instal
led as the old one is removed,
so that the schedule of public
events will not be disturbed by
construction activities, accord
ing to Schmidt.
The master plan includes re
modeling of the interior of the
amphitheater.
Funds are available for the
new fence and ramp; the re
mainder will be completed,
funds permitting, during
periods when the facility is not
being used.
