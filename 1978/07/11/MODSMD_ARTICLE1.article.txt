## 
### 
President Richard Lyman
has accepted an invitation
from the World Peace Found
ation to attend a multiracial,
multinational conference on
the future of South Africa, July
2b to 29 near Johannesburg.
Approximately 15 to 18
American and European
politicians, industrialists,
lawyers, journalists and scho
lars have been invited to at
tend. South African particip
ants will include both suppor
ters and opponents of the
Vorster regime.
The meeting is co
sponsored by the South Afri
can Institute of International
Affairs, a private organization
associated with the Univer
sity of Witwatersrand.
The conference was called
because "this is an area of in
ternational affairs we feel
needs particular attention,"
Vicki Rivers, assistant to the
foundation's director, said.
The results of the informal,
"off-the-record" conference
will probably be released "in
some form," depending on
the results, she said.
