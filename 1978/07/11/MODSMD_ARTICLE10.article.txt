# Mud, but no nutz, at' Nutz and Mud'
## 
### John Nielsen 
His name is Grant Cox, but
everyone calls him Goober. He
has mangy blond hair, huge
feet, and a "pretty good re
verse slam dunk"; he's six-feet
five, looks deceptively un
businesslike, runs Stanford's
least-known business — and is
liable to say anything.
"It's called "Nutz and Mud,"
and it operates out of the Ter
man lounge. "Nutz and Mud"
is a euphemism for
"Doughnuts and Coffee," but
Goober doesn't sell
doughnuts. That doesn't
bother him much, though.
"I sell coffee and milk and
tea and soft drinks," he said.
"And I sell sandwiches and
candy and potato chips and V-8
juice and totally organic over
sized cookie things. So shut
up. I do alright."
Fridays are slow
Goober runs "nutz" on
weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m. "Fridays are slow," he
said, "but the rest of the week
is fine if you remember that no
one has ever heard of the
place." Goober has been in the
lounge since spring quarter,
doing anywhere from $60 to
$200 worth of business a day —
the prices are low but not un

believable and the service is
very good.
"I did intend to sell
doughnuts at one point," he
added. "But we had some
problems getting the thing
started. The health department
tried to crush the spirit of free
enterprise as we know it by in
sisting that we have a sink if we
were going to use water in the
coffee machine, and we
couldn't think of anything else
to use, and that set us back
until Lindsey decided to use
bottled water which makes
better coffee anyway. (Lindsey
Conner started the business
last spring and hired Goober to
work the register and "sell
things before they rot" —
when Conner went home for
the summer he left Goober in
"total command.")
Though he has "absolutely
no desire to drive the apple
man in front of the post office
out of business" Goober ad
mitted that he wouldn't mind a
few extra customers now and
then.
"People generally like the
place," he said. "Some think
it's a blight on the face of hu
manity, but most that come in
here think it's pretty good.
Want an avocado sandwich?"
