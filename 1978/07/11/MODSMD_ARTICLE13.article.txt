# Brown gaining in popularity
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown may have
turned Proposition 13 to his own advantage, ac
cording to the results of a Los Angeles Times poll
released today.
The survey, which questioned 1072 voters
statewide, revealed Brown's popularity has in
creased since the passage of Proposition 13. Fifty
percent of those interviewed said they would re
elect the governor if asked to vote today, while 41
percent favored his Republican opponent, Attor
ney General Evelle Younger.
In late April, Brown collected 47 percent of the
vote in a similar poll, while 41 percent said they
would back Younger.
The most recent poll shows the number of vot
ers who think Brown supports Proposition 13
outweighs those who think Younger does, al
though Brown was a vocal opponent of the prop
erty tax limitation initiative during the primary
campaign and Younger backed the measure.
Brown's quick action to implement Proposition
13 seems to have influenced public opinion, the
paper said. Since the measure was approved by a

margin of almost 2-1 on June 6, Brown has worked
feverishly to make cuts — invoking a state hiring
freeze, slashing state spending and denying
cost-of-living increases to state workers and some
welfare recipients.
Younger, meanwhile, has been almost absent
from the campaign circuit since winning the GOP
nomination. Immediately after the primary, he
went to Hawaii fora vacation. Upon his return, he
entered the hospital fora kidney stone operation.
Brown's popularity was also on the increase
when compared to President Jimmy Carter, the
poll revealed. While 56 percent of those ques
tioned gave Brown a favorable rating, Carter re
ceived a similar vote from only 47 percent. In the
April survey, both politicians received favorable
ratings from 50 percent of the voters polled.
