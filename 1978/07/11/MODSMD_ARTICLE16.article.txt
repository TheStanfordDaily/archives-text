# Malibu Grand Prix.

Race car driving, like sailing
around the world, is one of
those fantasies that almost
everyone indulges in. Most
people are limited to the per
formance of their Volkswagen
around the cul-de-sac at the end
of the street, however, and few
laymen venture ontoa real track,
much less into a real Formula
car. But in search of more and
better means of entertainment,
Malibu Grand Prix has given
every potential Al Unser or
Mario Andretti the chance to
prove his or her skillâ€”without
the threat of sirens or red lights
stopping all the fun.
In April of 1975 a group of
firemen from Los Angeles took a
leave of absence and a large loan
to open a miniature raceway
track in Anaheim. Other race
ways had existed previously, but
for several reasons they weren't
successful. They failed to keep a
close inventory on the number
of tickets sold and the actual

number of laps driven, the cars
weren't maintained properly
and the entire operation wasn't
managed well.
But the firemen soon built a
second raceway in Fountain Val
ley and a third in Pasadena. The
fourth sprang up in Northridge
and in 1977, Warner offered to
support the Malibu Grand Prix
enterprise financially while al
lowing them to maintain their
successful system of operation.
Presently, 11 tracks are in op
eration and nine new ones are
projected to open before Oc
tober 22 in several states across
the country. Eventual plans in
clude international expansion.

Dick Dunne, manager of the
Redwood City track said
"Malibu Grand Prix is into enter
taining people." And obviously
people are into being enter
tained.
When the Redwood City track
opened last year, the lines were
three hours long. "People
would buy tickets, go out to din
ner and come back to race," said
Dunne. Since then, however,
the enthusiasm has tapered to
an hour and a half wait on Friday
and Saturday nights and only 15

to 20 minutes during the week.
Dunne said the quietest times
are between 5 and 8 p.m. any
night of the week. And it's not a
one-shot deal. People return
time and time again to test their
skills against the computerized
timing device. It's addicting.
When a small-time racer first
goes in to drive, a liability re
lease is signed and a permanent
orange card given out to be used
at subsequent visits to the track.
A valid driver's license must be
presented at this time also.
