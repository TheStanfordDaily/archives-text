Once onto the track, fitted into a
helmet and strapped into the
seat, the drivers careen around
corners and try to improve their
times after each lap.
First runs are considerably
worse than those taken after the
track becomes familiar. Posting
times in the low 60s (seconds) is
average. The Redwood City
track men's record held by Pete
Hodgson is 50 seconds. The
women's record, held by his
daughter Cindy is 52 seconds.
Although the number of men
that race the mini-cars is greater
than the number of women,
their times are competitively
close. It takes a certain amount
of veritable skill. In fact, with all
the laps taken in the past year,
there surprisingly "hasn't been a
single body cracked," said
Dunne. (Car body that is.)
"Ninety-nine percent of the
people that come here to drive
want to do the right thing," said
Dunne. "There have been no
serious injuries because the cars
.nt' designed so well. In addi
tion, you can't floor it past the
tirst turn.'' A blacklist does exist,
however, for those who can't
seem to handle the "privilege"
of driving at Malibu Grand Prix.
Those that are pulled off the

track aren't allowed to drive
again. It's this high standard of
conduct, along with the support
of the local law enforcement
agencies that keep the place
from becoming shoddy or ill
managed.
For those who don't want to
drive or who come to socialize
and compare performances, the
inside shop holds pinball
machines, computerized rifle
games and a snack bar. The gar
age garnishes the rear of the

building and the well-lit tracks
spread out beyond, visible from
101 (take the Harbor Blvd. exit).
The entire place is impeccably
clean.
The cars
Twenty-one scaled down
Formula cars zoom around the
two tracks. (Ten for each track
and one for show.) They run at
28 horsepower with a rotary en
gine and can reach speeds of 67
mph on an open straightaway, 40
mph on the closed course. The

first cars were hand-made and
cost $15,000 each. The more re
cent ones were constructed in
the Grand Prix factory in Wood
land Hills and are valued at
$6500. It's an expensive piece of
machinery on which to be racing
around.
The maintenance is thorough
with 25, 50, 100, 250, 1000 and
2000 hour checks. The
mechanics are skilled and the
garage well-equipped.

Several special offers serve as
further enticement. One track is
available to be rented out by
groups and the Grand Prix will
provide scoring tables, a pit
crew and a 10 percent discount.
They recently ran a special for
13, 14 and 15 year olds who
wouldn't normally be able to
drive. Classes were conducted
in the maintenance and driving
of the cars and a diploma, along
with the opportunity to drive
several laps, were awarded at
the end.
The laps are normally $1.25
each. When 10 are bought at the
same time, the price is reduced
tosl each. Before 6 p.m., a pac
ket of 20 tickets can be purch
ased for $18.25.
"The entire operation is low
key," said Dunne. "We usually
don't have any problems, and
the people really enjoy them
selves. They learn something
about driving too," he added.
"You can see (hem using their
technique when they leave the
parking lot."
