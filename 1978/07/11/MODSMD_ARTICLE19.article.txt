An exhibition including 33
bronze sculptures and numer
ous brush drawings by the con
temporary German sculptor
Joachim Berthold is currently on
exhibit at the Stanford Art Gal
lery. The occasion provides an
unusual West Coast opportunity
to see recent work in sculpture
from the German Federal Re
public.
In the modernist tradition,
Berthold uses the human form
as the basis for his work, but he
treats it abstractly. "The order in
my sculptures," the artist writes,
"is intended to demonstrate the
power of man in overcoming
fear and real or apparent chaos
in the world." The art of Ancient
Egypt has played a part in the
evolution of Berthold's work.
He finds particular interest in a
form which he calls a human
wall. "The idea of introducing
hollowed-out or 'negative'
shapes in a normal type of wall
first occurred to me in 1963. The
volumes of the figures are pro
duced not by the shadows of
usual convex shapes but by
shadows of concave forms." The
Stanford exhibition will include
several bronze variations of the
human wall. And it will also
show a number of photographs
of sculptures commissioned
from him for public installation
in Germany.
'Werkkunstschule'
Berthold was born in
Eisenach, Germany, in 1917. His
mother, herself a painter, was
the daughter of the court
sculptor Ceorg Kugel. His father
came from a famous goldsmiths'
family. Berthold studied at the
Werkkunstschule in Cologne,
and at the Akademie der bilden
den Kuenste in Munich. After
the war, he started to work as an
independent sculptc. He built
himself a house and a studio in
Oberaudorf, in the valley of the
Inn River, near Munich. In 1970 a
gallery was built which houses
his complete works —
sculptures, drawings, lithog
raphs.
In 1960, German museums
and galleries began presenting
Berthold's work in one-man
exhibitions as well as purchasing
works from him. He also re
ceived important commissions
from the Universities of Munich
and Muenster.
Better known
In 1963, Berthold became bet
ter known outside of Germany.
He exhibited in the seventh

"Biennale of Sculpture" in
Antwerp, then in the Salon de la
leune Sculpture and in the Salon
des Grands et Jeunes in Paris, as
well as in other European cities.
His sculpture "Couple" was
exhibited in front of the German
Pavilion at Expo '67 in Montreal.
Since that time the artist's work
has found a steadily growing
number of admirers all over the
world. The David B. Findlay Gal
leries in New York introduced
his works in a number of exhibi
tions in New York and elsewhere
on the East Coast.
Also on exhibit at the Stanford
Art Gallery are recent photo
graphs by Joan Myers of Los
Angeles. Myers is a contempor
ary photographer who uses trad
itional and highly refined
methods of printing to intensify
her sense of dramatic gesture
and to emphasize the specific
beauty of human limbs, torsos
and facial features.
The subject of the negative
platinum prints is the draped
female nude. The negative pro
cess reverses darks and lights as
we see them; in these prints,
dark arms, legs, and partial tor
sos emerge like newly revealed
and fantastic shapes from a deli
cately indicated white ground.
The positive platinum prints are
of the male figure, usually
caught in some extreme ges
ture: these are portraits of anxi
ety, or performances from the
theater of Artaud.
"I see life as theater," says

Myers. "All living beings have
their role to play and a certain
time in which to expand and per
fect it. . . . All the nude figures
in my photographs are theatrical
in that they are portraying some
thing other than their own
character. I am interested in
making use of photographic
realism to give validity to images
that do not exist in normal wak
ing life, but are basic to our
human condition."
Performance, both as a danger
and a musician, has long been a
part of Myers' life. She studied
music as an undergraduate at
Stanford University, and re
ceived an M.A. in musicology
from Stanford in 1966. In the
early 19705, she began her study
of photography at UCLA, initially
using the customary silver
gelatin papers for printing. As
her photography evolved, she
turned increasingly to non-silver
processes, such as carbon and
platinum, which she mastered
by studying the historic for
mulae for them. The platinum
prints in the present exhibition
are subtly touched with color in
a manner more evocative than
realistic.
Both the Berthold and the
Myers exhibits are at the Stan
ford Art Gallery and will remain
on view through Sunday, August
20. Gallery hours are Tuesday to
Friday, 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.;
Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 4:45
p.m.

"Scream," a negative platinum print by Joan Myers, is one of several
photographs on display in the Stanford Art Gallery. Myers attended
Stanford, then went on to study photography at UCLA. Both the
Berthold and Myers shows will run through Sunday, August 5.
An exhibition including 33
bronze sculptures and numer
ous brush drawings by the con
temporary German sculptor
Joachim Berthold is currently on
exhibit at the Stanford Art Gal
lery. The occasion provides an
unusual West Coast opportunity
to see recent work in sculpture
from the German Federal Re
public.
In the modernist tradition,
Berthold uses the human form
as the basis for his work, but he
treats it abstractly. "The order in
my sculptures," the artist writes,
"is intended to demonstrate the
power of man in overcoming
fear and real or apparent chaos
in the world." The art of Ancient
Egypt has played a part in the
evolution of Berthold's work.
He finds particular interest in a
form which he calls a human
wall. "The idea of introducing
hollowed-out or 'negative'
shapes in a normal type of wall
first occurred to me in 1963. The
volumes of the figures are pro
duced not by the shadows of
usual convex shapes but by
shadows of concave forms." The
Stanford exhibition will include
several bronze variations of the
human wall. And it will also
show a number of photographs
of sculptures commissioned
from him for public installation
in Germany.
'Werkkunstschule'
Berthold was born in
Eisenach, Germany, in 1917. His
mother, herself a painter, was
the daughter of the court
sculptor Ceorg Kugel. His father
came from a famous goldsmiths'
family. Berthold studied at the
Werkkunstschule in Cologne,
and at the Akademie der bilden
den Kuenste in Munich. After
the war, he started to work as an
independent sculptc. He built
himself a house and a studio in
Oberaudorf, in the valley of the
Inn River, near Munich. In 1970 a
gallery was built which houses
his complete works —
sculptures, drawings, lithog
raphs.
In 1960, German museums
and galleries began presenting
Berthold's work in one-man
exhibitions as well as purchasing
works from him. He also re
ceived important commissions
from the Universities of Munich
and Muenster.
Better known
In 1963, Berthold became bet
ter known outside of Germany.
He exhibited in the seventh

"Biennale of Sculpture" in
Antwerp, then in the Salon de la
leune Sculpture and in the Salon
des Grands et Jeunes in Paris, as
well as in other European cities.
His sculpture "Couple" was
exhibited in front of the German
Pavilion at Expo '67 in Montreal.
Since that time the artist's work
has found a steadily growing
number of admirers all over the
world. The David B. Findlay Gal
leries in New York introduced
his works in a number of exhibi
tions in New York and elsewhere
on the East Coast.
Also on exhibit at the Stanford
Art Gallery are recent photo
graphs by Joan Myers of Los
Angeles. Myers is a contempor
ary photographer who uses trad
itional and highly refined
methods of printing to intensify
her sense of dramatic gesture
and to emphasize the specific
beauty of human limbs, torsos
and facial features.
The subject of the negative
platinum prints is the draped
female nude. The negative pro
cess reverses darks and lights as
we see them; in these prints,
dark arms, legs, and partial tor
sos emerge like newly revealed
and fantastic shapes from a deli
cately indicated white ground.
The positive platinum prints are
of the male figure, usually
caught in some extreme ges
ture: these are portraits of anxi
ety, or performances from the
theater of Artaud.
"I see life as theater," says

Myers. "All living beings have
their role to play and a certain
time in which to expand and per
fect it. . . . All the nude figures
in my photographs are theatrical
in that they are portraying some
thing other than their own
character. I am interested in
making use of photographic
realism to give validity to images
that do not exist in normal wak
ing life, but are basic to our
human condition."
Performance, both as a danger
and a musician, has long been a
part of Myers' life. She studied
music as an undergraduate at
Stanford University, and re
ceived an M.A. in musicology
from Stanford in 1966. In the
early 19705, she began her study
of photography at UCLA, initially
using the customary silver
gelatin papers for printing. As
her photography evolved, she
turned increasingly to non-silver
processes, such as carbon and
platinum, which she mastered
by studying the historic for
mulae for them. The platinum
prints in the present exhibition
are subtly touched with color in
a manner more evocative than
realistic.
Both the Berthold and the
Myers exhibits are at the Stan
ford Art Gallery and will remain
on view through Sunday, August
20. Gallery hours are Tuesday to
Friday, 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.;
Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 4:45
p.m.
