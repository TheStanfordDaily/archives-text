# Police keep burglary rate down by 'aggressive patrolling' tactic
## 
### 
The Department of Public
Safety has reported that "ag
gressive patrolling' and "a
heavy crime prevention prog
ram" have kept the University
burglary rate far lower than it
was a few years ago.
Thefts from University struc
tures and faculty houses have
leveled off after dropping 46
percent last year from the rate
two years ago. Only three resi
dential burglaries have been re
ported since the end of spring
quarter, according to police of
ficials.
In contrast, burglaries have

increased in nearby com
munities, and officials here at
tribute the difference to more
extensive police coverage.
Captain William
Wullschleger, head of the field
operations division, said the
burglary rate here is running
about the same this year as last,
down considerably from the
1975-76 rate.
Rate drop
"We had 198 on-campus
burglaries that year, he said,
"and that went down to 112 in
1976-77, and at the rate we're
going we should stay at that level
again (this year)."
The Stanford community, par
ticularly the residential sections,
is "a vulnerable area" in the
summer, said Wullschleger.
"Particularly after spring quar
ter, when people are on vaca
tion, we have problems.
"People ride around and look
for piles of newspapers lying
around, and mailboxes full of
mail. Places like Los Altos, Palo
Alto and other such wealthy
communities are always hardest
hit."
Wullschleger noted that other
areas in the county, including
Campbell, Santa Clara and Los
Catos, are experiencing
burglary rate increases of as
much as 10 percent.
Prevention program
"Last year we really got into a
crime prevention program,'
said Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
head of the investigations divi
sion. "We begin meeting with
homeowners, making ourselves
more available, making them

more cognizant of precautions
they are able to take.
"Handing out materials,
checking locks, teaching people
to cancel the paper — those
things have probably been a fac
tor.
Two unsolved cases
Two of the three on-campus
residential burglaries that have
occurred since the end of spring
quarter remain unsolved, ac
cording to police reports. One
was a daylight robbery, in which
a fur coat and jewelry were sto
len from the home of Andreas
Acrivos, a professor in the

Chemical Engineering Depart
ment.
The second unsolved burglary
was on Frenchman's Road, at the
homeof Mrs. I.J. Quillan, where
antique silver dollars of un
known value were taken.
In the third incident,
Niemeyer said, "two guys
walked into a fellow's garage
and attempted to steal his
lawnmower — and were
promptly arrested and booked. "
The low apprehension rate is
normal and almost inevitable,
according to Niemeyer. "
