Soviet dissident trials begin
Moscow — Climaxing an 18-month Krem
lin crackdown on dissent, two Jewish dissi
dent leaders went before Soviet courts yes
terday in trials that are drawing the United
States into a major human rights confronta
tion with Moscow.
In Paris, the wife of one of the defen
dants, Anately Shcharansky, appealed to
the United States to intercede anew to help
free her husband, who faces a possible
death penalty if convicted of espionage.
Shcharansky, appearing before a three
judge panel in a tree-shaded central Mos
cow courthouse, pleaded innocent to the
treason charge against him. Leonid
Shcharansky said his brother rejected as
"absurd" allegations that he spied for the
CIA.
In the city of Kaluga, 100 miles south of
here, Alexander Ginzburg, accused of
anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda, also
denied the charges against him. Irina
Ginzburg said her husband, who could get
up to 10 years at hard labor, told the three
judges he might modify his plea if his guilt is
proved at the trial.
The prosecution of the 30-year-old
Shcharansky, a computer expert who be
came a key member in the Jewish emigra
tion movement, and the 41-year-old
Ginzburg, a longtime human rights activist,
follows a long Soviet campaign against dis
sent.
The Carter administration says the fate of
the two men could have an important im
pact on East-West detente. President Jimmy
Carter has personally championed their
cause, and Vance contends they are being
tried for "asserting fundamental human
rights."
Brooke perjury case delayed
Boston — After a three-week investigation
into whether Sen. Edward Brooke should
be charged with perjury, the Middlesex
County district attorney said yesterday he
has no jurisdiction in the case.
District Attorney John J. Droney, a
Democrat who was defeated by Brooke in
the 1972 Senate race, said he would take no
further action on the matter because any
possible offense occurred in Suffolk
County.
Asked why it took three months to de
termine jurisdiction, Droney's investigator,
Assistant District Attorney Richard Kelley,
said, "A matter of this delicacy should not
be taken lightly."
Droney said that if the case is to be pur
sued it should be by the state attorney gen
eral, Francis Bellotti, or the Suffolk County
district attorney, Garrett Byrne.
Brooke, a Massachusetts Republican,
-admitted makingafalse statement about his

finances in a divorce deposition taken in
Boston, which is in Suffolk County.
Brooke admitted last month that he had
made "a misstatement and a mistake" on
the deposition when he claimed that he
owed $49,000 to Boston liquor dealer A.
Raymond Tye, a close personal frield.
He latter admitted at a news conference
and in court that he owed Tye only $2000.
The rest of the money he said was owed to
the estate of his late mother-in-law.
Brown urges rent reductions
San Francisco — Gov. jerry Brown put
California landlords on notice yesterday
that he plans to "vigorously press" them to
reduce rents in proportion to gains from
Proposition 13 tax relief.
Speaking at the 12th convention of the
California Labor Federation, Brown made
his remark following a general call for unity
among the ranks of organized labor in the
state.
The governor said he would pressure
landlords to return their Proposition 13-
triggered property tax savings to their ten
ants, but did not say how.
Currently, there are two bills pending in
the Legislature which would require land
lords to do just that, but Brown has taken no
formal stand on either measure.
U.S.-Soviet arms talks resume
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, citing the spectre of "mutual annihi
lation," said yesterday a new arms limita
tion pact with the Soviet Union must not be
conditioned on Soviet behavior in such
other areas as human rights.
Vance strongly defended, during a news
conference, his decision to proceed with
plans to resume U.S.-Soviet arms talks this
week despite his deep concern over trials of
two Soviet human rights activists.
Vance will meet tomorrow with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in
Geneva to try to remove the remaining obs
tacles to a new strategic arms limitation ag
reement.
ERA lobbyists ask for time
Washington — Supporters of the Equal
Rights Amendment met with members of
Congress yesterday to ask for more time to
seek ratification of the embattled amend
ment.
Mildred Jeffrey, head of the National
Women's Political Caucus, estimated that
up to 5000 women and men lobbied Con
gress during the day for an extension of the
ratification period.

A smaller number of opponents of the
amendment were also visiting members of
Congress. There was no estimate of their
number.
"I don't think any reasonable man will
want to go down in history as the man who
stood between women and the Constitu
tion," said Allie Hixson of Greensburg, Ky.
The pro-ERA lobbyists were carrying that
message to Congress following a march and
rally Sunday by thousands of ERA suppor
ters.

West African nation of Mauritania during

world's largest egg ranch.
