# Peninsula schools face penalty
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Unified School
District will be penalized about
$666,000 by a state measure cal
ling for a penalty of one-third of
all reserve funds over 5 percent
of a school district's operating
budget.
Palo Alto had extended its
surplus almost $2 million above
its allowed $1.7 million reserve.
Business Manager Jim Keller at
tempted to spend school district
funds and thus reduce the pen
alty.
The state however, imposed a
retroactive deadline early this
week on reserve spending by
districts. Because the deadline
was June 6, Palo Alto will be hit
hard by the state legislation.
The Los Altos School District
will also be penalized by the
state measure, Senate Bill 154.
However, Business Manager
Keith Van Der Zyl estimates a
loss of only $30,000 to $40,000.
"That may be a lot of money to
an individual," said Van Der Zyl,
"but not to a district such as
ours."
Los Altos School District, with
an $800,000 reserve to start with,
made purchases of "about
$300,000," said Van Der Zyl.
"Many of those," he said, "had
nothing whatsoever to do with
SB 154."
"As I interpret the legislation,
any contracts entered into by
June 6 would meet the require
ments of the bill. You could not
enter into a contract after that
date, but I don't interpret that to
include purchases," Van Der Zyl
said.
The state became "uptight,"
said Van Der Zyl, "because of
some junior colleges with large
ending balances. One junior col
lege in this county had stored
some $7 million in reserves,"
Van Der Zyl said.
