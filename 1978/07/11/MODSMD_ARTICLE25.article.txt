# Off-campus lounge open for summer
## 
### 
The Clearinghouse, an or
ganization designed to make life
easier for students not living in
University residences, has
reopened the Off-Campus
Lounge. Run by Tresidder Union
during the year, the Lounge was
originally scheduled to be
closed until fall.
According to Diane Zipursky,
coordinator of the organization,
the lounge will double as a
Clearinghouse office while re
maining available for student
use on weekdays from 10 a.m.
until 2 p.m.
Though many of the centers'
traditional services will not be
continued duringthe summer —
the carpool program, lockers
and courtesy phone remain
closed — tea and coffee will still
be available. Located on the
main floor of the clubhouse, off
the Old Union Courtyard, the
Lounge is to be used as a "read
ing, lunch-eating and relaxing
area.
"We hope to make the place
better known," said Zurpitsky.
"By remaining open during the

summer we are attempting to
make it easier for more students
to familiarize themselves with
the facility, in the hope that
more of them will make use of
the center's services during the
school year."
The Clearinghouse is a
student-staffed service regularly
provided during autumn quarter
to students who are searching
for off-campus housing. It re
sumes full operation Sept. 5, in
Tresidder Union, and remains
open through registration.
The organization provides ex

or share; work exchanges (for
board and/or room); a
roommate-finding service; tele
phones and maps for effective
"hunting"; information on local
transportation, leases and fair
housing; social events, and a
staff "that knows every answer
to every question."
The Clearinghouse also pro
