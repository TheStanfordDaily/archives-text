# Hostages held in skyscraper

New York (AP) — A Polish
speaking machinist who wanted
more money for an on-the-job
injury was seized last evening
after he held four hostages for
nine hours in the World Trade
Center. He had threatened to
blow up the office where he was
cornered with what he said was
80 pounds of dynamite.
"It appears we have him," said
a spokesman for the Port Au
thority, which operates the
Trade Center at 8 p.m.
The hostages reportedly were
not hurt.
Police said one hostage es
caped the windowless iftth floor
hearing room where the man,
Ladislaw Fraczeck, in his 50s,
was said to have told his lawyer
earlier: "I have a bomb here and
I'm going to set it off if I don't get
money."
Police said another of the hos
tages told Fraczek:
"We don't believe you have a
bomb."
Knapsack
The three remaining hostages
then jumped Fraczek and over
powered him, police said. They
said a knapsack which contained
four loaves of dark bread and a
package was taken from him.

One of the hostages told police
he had seized "the device."
Thousands of office workers
were evacuated from one tower
of the twin-towered, 110-story
skyscraper, the city's tallest.
At one point, Police Lt. Frank
Kelly said:
"He said he had 80 pounds of
dynamite. I'm no explosives ex
pert but if that went off it would
take out two or three floors."
It was not clear how Fraczek,
from Brooklyn, could have got
ten 80 pounds of explosives into
the building as he claimed.
Negotiations
A team of police negotiators
was rushed in under the com
mand of Capt. Frank Bolz to
negotiate release of the hos
tages. The team, trained to avoid
overt actions that might trigger
violence, also called in a Polish
interpreter.
The four hostages were iden
tified as Workers Compensation
Board referee Louis jerome,
court reporter Clarence Doug
las, state insurance fund lawyer
Salvatore Ciaccio and Fraczek's
lawyer, whose name was not
immediately known.
Arthur Cooperman, chairman
of the compensation board, said
Fraczek lost two fingers in an in
dustrial accident in 1975 and was
awarded $6000 in compensation,
the maximum under the law.
"He evidently spent it and told
us he was not working and he
insisted upon receiving more
money," Cooper man said.
Proof
The board chairman added
that Fraczek was told he would
have to present proof that the
amount he already had received
was insufficient compensation
for the injury. This effort appa
rently had bogged down in a
series of delays, angering Frac
zek.
The evacuation sent tenants of
the 24th through 40th floors of
the world's second-tallest build
ing from their air conditioned
working quarters into the 86-
degree heat on the sidewalks be
low.
