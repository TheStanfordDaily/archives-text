David Truong, a Stanford alumnus from Viet
nam, and Ronald Humphrey, a former U.S. In
formation Agency official, have been sentenced
to 15 years in prison for spying for Vietnam's
socialist government in 1976 and 1977.
The sentence was handed down Friday in
Alexandria, Va., by U.S. District Court ludge Al
bert Bryan, as both men protested their inno
cence. â€ž
"I am not a spy or anyone's agent, Truong
insisted. "My mind is totally at peace."
The son of an antiwar politician who finished
second to Nguyen Van Thieu in South Vietnam's
1967 presidential election, Truong graduated with
a bachelor's degree in political science in 1968.
While on campus, he was an antiwar activist.
Truong and Humphrey were arrested |an. 31
and found guilty on six counts of a seven-count
espionage indictment May 19. In 12 days of tes
timony, both defendants argued that they were
merely trying to promote better U.S.-Vietnamese
relations by releasing what they called low-grade
"diplomatic chit-chat.'
Both men entered pleas for leniency, and could

have been sentenced to life terms plus i5 years.
Bryan said he believed Truong the more culpable
of the two, but, because he was not an American
citizen, he gave the two men similar sentences.
Each man must serve 55 months before being
eligible for parole.
Humphrey was convicted of stealing sensitive
documents from the U.S. Information Agency
and giving them to Truong, who has lived in the
United States for 13 years.
The indictment stated that Truong then passed
the documents to a courier to be relayed to Viet
namese diplomats in Paris. The courier was an
informant for the Central Intelligence Agency and
the FBI, working as a double agent.
Humphrey and Truong have said they will ap
peal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., and to the U.S. Supreme Court it
necessary.
The case may set a precedent because some of
the key evidence was obtained through warrant
less searches and electronic surveillance. The use
of such methods was approved by President
limmv Carter and Attorney General Griffin Bell.
