# Letter: incident reveals racism
## 
### 
A group of approximately 25
Asian American students met
with a gathering of up to 60
Madera residents in the Madera
House lounge on June 11. This
meeting was agreed to after the
Asian American students, com
posed mainly of members of the
Asian American Students As
sociation (AASA) and residents
of Junipero House, presented a
letter of grievances to a Madera
house associate (RA).
The letter was apparently a re
sponse to the broadcast of a
"re-enactment of the Pearl Har
bor attack" by members of
neighboring Junipero House,
the Asian American theme
house, two days earilier. In the
letter, the Asian American stu
dents expressed their outrage
against the program, which al
legedly contained racial slurs
and ended with the message,
"pack up your chopsticks and
put your rice paddies in your
woks and get the fuck out."
Both Madera and Junipero re
sidents attacked AASA for
"blowing the incident out of
proportion" when "the matter is
settled between the two
dorms." A Madera RA com
mented, "This was not an inten
tionally malicious act, simply
one of very poor taste."
The Asian American student
group responded that, "this was
not simply a matter of dorm
rivalry, but clearly a racist act,"

adding, "we must all do our part
to ride society of this kind of
thinking."
Whilethe AASA'sdemands for
a formal apology, the release of a
copy of the tape used for the
broadcast, and a meeting bet
ween representatives of Madera
House and the Asian American
community, were not addressed
at this meeting, the Office of Re
sidential Education has received
a copy of this tape.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson,
the tape will be used for the
training of future residence
staffs. He added, "This is not an
isolated event. Incidents of this
nature have been increasing in
the last few years. Five or six
years ago, nothing like this
would have happened."
