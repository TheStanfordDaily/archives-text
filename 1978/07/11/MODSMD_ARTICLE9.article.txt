# Rewards of assisting in research

A conflict has long existed be
tween teaching and research in
undergraduate education.
Though University policy stipu
lates that teaching and research
shall be weighed equally in te
nure and promotion decisions,
the "publish or perish" syn
drome is almost universally rec
ognized. Consequently, anec
dotes from students about fam
ous professors being poor in
structors are not uncommon.
At one level, however, the
conflict between teaching and
research has been resolved. For
those students who pursue di
rected research with a faculty
member, teaching and research
become one and the same.

For myself, I have found re
search work with individual fa
culty members in psychology,
sociology, and in my major,
political science, to be some of
the most immediately and po
tentially valuable aspects of my
career at Stanford.-
Working closely
Without a doubt, the stu
dent's greatest benefit from di
rected research is the opportun
ity to work closely with a faculty
member. Not only does such
provide a role model for the stu
dent in her/his academic focus,
but it also promotes a demystifi
cation of the faculty in general,
as their human and natural
characteristics are observed in a
non-classroom setting.
Further, there is the practical
consideration that close work
with a faculty member might
also lead to a quality letter of re
commendation.
Directed research also pro
vides students the opportunity
to apply what has been learned in
previous courses, to pursue in
depth a particular area of in
terest, and to learn the practical
value of a specific major.
The benefits for faculty mem
bers who seek undergraduate
research assistants are equally
obvious. By providing units or
work-study funding, a faculty
member can receive the time
and energy of a student to either
assist on a research project di
rectly or to pursue a tangential
area of interest.
Improvements
Administratively, there are
several small steps which could
be taken to promote under
graduate research. First would

be to strengthen the dean of un
dergraduate studies' Under
graduate Research Oppor
tunities (URO) program. The
staff supervising URO is already
overburdened with respon
sibilities to SWOPSI and SCIRE,
equally needy programs.
Specifically, URO needs to be
more broadly publicized to both
students and faculty.
A second step would be to di
rect as much of the federal
work-study (or any other
University/financial aids job
program) monies to faculty
members seeking under
graduate resejarch assistants.
Few job opportunities exist
which could better fulfill the
goals of the work-study prog
ram.
Finally, the number of under
graduates a professor involves in
his/her research should be a fac
tor indepartmental decision
making, similar to the use of the
numbers of doctorates, advisees
or honors projects a professor
supervises.
Individual faculty members
should carefully consider their
own research projects, and
should try to devise ways in
which undergraduates could
play a supporting role as re
search assistants. Whether units
of credit or a salary is used as
incentive or not, the faculty
member should publicize the
research opportunity through
the URO and by making an
nouncements in class.
Contact
Further, it is important for the
professor to have as much con
tact with the student as possible,
and not to just shove the under
graduate off onto a graduate

student.
The stimulation of under
graduate research is not just a
responsibility of the administra
tion and faculty, however. Stu
dents must seek out such work
and demonstrate that a demand
for research opportunities does
exist.
Undergraduate departmental
associations should identify and
publicize the research interests
of the faculty members in their
departments and should en
courage students to seek out
those professors that they feel
they would like to work with.
When starting on a research
project, the individual students
must recognize that they have
undertaken a commitment
which they should responsibily
fulfill. If the work the students
are doing is uninteresting or
menial, the burden is on them to
find ways to make their wort par
ticipation more educational and
valuable, and to suggest such to
their faculty sponsors.
It is the research function of
Stanford which distinguishes it
from so many other universities
and colleges. While small, lib
eral arts institutions may be able
to offer the finest instruction,
they do not have the capability
to offer directed reseach with
leading scholars.
To remain competitive, Stan
ford must develop its resources
to the maximum, and part of that
process must include expanding
research opportunities for not
only graduate students, but un
dergraduates as well.

A conflict has long existed be
tween teaching and research in
undergraduate education.
Though University policy stipu
lates that teaching and research
shall be weighed equally in te
nure and promotion decisions,
the "publish or perish" syn
drome is almost universally rec
ognized. Consequently, anec
dotes from students about fam
ous professors being poor in
structors are not uncommon.
At one level, however, the
conflict between teaching and
research has been resolved. For
those students who pursue di
rected research with a faculty
member, teaching and research
become one and the same.

For myself, I have found re
search work with individual fa
culty members in psychology,
sociology, and in my major,
political science, to be some of
the most immediately and po
tentially valuable aspects of my
career at Stanford.-
Working closely
Without a doubt, the stu
dent's greatest benefit from di
rected research is the opportun
ity to work closely with a faculty
member. Not only does such
provide a role model for the stu
dent in her/his academic focus,
but it also promotes a demystifi
cation of the faculty in general,
as their human and natural
characteristics are observed in a
non-classroom setting.
Further, there is the practical
consideration that close work
with a faculty member might
also lead to a quality letter of re
commendation.
Directed research also pro
vides students the opportunity
to apply what has been learned in
previous courses, to pursue in
depth a particular area of in
terest, and to learn the practical
value of a specific major.
The benefits for faculty mem
bers who seek undergraduate
research assistants are equally
obvious. By providing units or
work-study funding, a faculty
member can receive the time
and energy of a student to either
assist on a research project di
rectly or to pursue a tangential
area of interest.
Improvements
Administratively, there are
several small steps which could
be taken to promote under
graduate research. First would

be to strengthen the dean of un
dergraduate studies' Under
graduate Research Oppor
tunities (URO) program. The
staff supervising URO is already
overburdened with respon
sibilities to SWOPSI and SCIRE,
equally needy programs.
Specifically, URO needs to be
more broadly publicized to both
students and faculty.
A second step would be to di
rect as much of the federal
work-study (or any other
University/financial aids job
program) monies to faculty
members seeking under
graduate resejarch assistants.
Few job opportunities exist
which could better fulfill the
goals of the work-study prog
ram.
Finally, the number of under
graduates a professor involves in
his/her research should be a fac
tor indepartmental decision
making, similar to the use of the
numbers of doctorates, advisees
or honors projects a professor
supervises.
Individual faculty members
should carefully consider their
own research projects, and
should try to devise ways in
which undergraduates could
play a supporting role as re
search assistants. Whether units
of credit or a salary is used as
incentive or not, the faculty
member should publicize the
