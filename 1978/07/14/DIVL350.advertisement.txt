Next week, July 17 through 22, we will be celebrating
our 8th anniversary, with a few surprises for those
who drop in to see us. Our goal remains what it
always has been: to become the best book store in
the West. For helping to make this seem less impos
sible than it did eight years ago, our sincere thanks.
We re at 405 Kipling, corner of Lytton, 329-9217.
