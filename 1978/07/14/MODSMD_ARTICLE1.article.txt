After years of indecision, controversy and technical delays, "Albers' Wall" is finally going up on Lomita
Mall between the Physics Tank and the Quad. The story of the relief and the University began in 1971, when
the late artist Josef Albers gave the design of the sculpture to Stanford. The final decision on locating the
wall was made by Assoc. Provost Edward Shaw last winter.
