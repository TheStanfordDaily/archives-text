# Renters want tax-cut benefits
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” The Proposition 13 campaign
promised renters a share of benefits reaped by
their landlords if the tax-slashing initiative was
approved. But many disgruntled tenants now be
lieve it was no more than a quickly forgotten cam
paign promise.
Despite pleas by government officials, protests
by tenants and threatened laws forbidding rent
increases, landlords say they want to wait and see
what happens before cutting rents to share with
tenants the 57 percent property tax cut they are
supposed to be getting under Proposition 13.
Many of them even raised rents.
"There may have been some plausible, rational
reasons for some to have made rent increases,"
said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, "but by and
large what we are seeing in the way of complaints
is a matter of greed."
Bradley endorsed a proposed six-month rent
freeze at June 1 levels. Gov. Jerry Brown put land
lords on notice that he plans to "vigorously
press" for rent reductions in proportion to their,
gains from Proposition 13. And Attorney Ceneral
Evelle Younger, Brown's Republican opponent in
November, urged landlords to cut rents in the
state's estimated 3.5 million rental units.
Tenant-rights activists had predicted the land
lords would simply keep the benefits. Shortly
after Proposition 13 passed, Syd Rose of Santa
Monica said, "If renters expect any money back,
they'll soon recognize they've been duped."
Landlords say increased municipal fees and un
certainty over their final savings from Proposition
13 make immediate rent reductions premature,
although some promise rent cuts if savings
materialize. The initiative itself said nothing about
rent relief.
A few landlords, like the L B. Nelson Property
Management Corp. of Menlo Park, are cutting
rents immediately. The San Francisco Bay Area
firm sent notices to 1000 tenants pledging an
across-the-board 8 percent rent cut on Aug. 1.
Other landlords are less equivocal, saying only
that they will raise the rent because it's too low,

hasn't been upped in more than a year, because
business is business, not charity. Many give no
explanation.
The sale of rental property is the biggest single
reason for rent increases. When a building is sold
it must be appraised at current market values, not
at the substantially cheaper 1975-76 levels Propos
ition 13 resurrected.
However the new property tax would still rep
resent a savings for landlords under Proposition
13 in that it would be limited to 1 percent of the
appraised value and subsequent increases in as
sessments would be limited to only 2 percent a
year.
Property taxes used to account for about 20
percent or about $50 of a typical $250-a-month
rent, apartment owners groups have said. Under
Proposition 13, however, that $50 should drop to
about $20, unless other costs increase dramati
cally.
But many landlords hesitate to cut back be
cause it might decrease the value of the property.
If they are contemplating selling apartments, a
buyer would be attracted to a place that collects
higher rents and more income.
And another factor diluting their savings under
Proposition 13, landlords say, is the fact their fed
eral tax bill will be higher now that they won't be
deducting as much for local property taxes.
But renters and politicians aren't buying this
landlord reasoning. Los Angeles City Councilman
Joel Wachs, for instance, introduced a six-month
city rent freeze to stop what he called "rent goug
ing."
"I have been inundated with calls by tenants
throughout the city who have had stiff rent in
creases since the passage of Proposition 13," said
Wachs. "We have been checking them out and in
most cases they don't have new owners, they
don't have any improvements. There the owners
should be sharing their tax savings. They're not
even holding the line. The whole intent of Propos
ition 13 was that homeowners and tenants alike
should share in the profits."
