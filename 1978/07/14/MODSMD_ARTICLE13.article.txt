It was all a matter of being in
the wrong place at the wrong
time.
Stanford police, following up
on an anonymous tip on June 9,
had just decided those suspici
ous looking plants on the roof of
Theta Xi fraternity were really
marijuana, when Dean Thomas,
a fifth year mathematical sci
ences student, appeared and
began to reerect the wooden
barrier that previously had al
lowed the plants to fluorish un
disturbed.
The appearance of Thomas
galvanized the observing offic
ers into action, "who then de
termined they should investi
gate further," according to Stan
ford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer. "Mr. Thomas tried to
exit the scene through his room,
and he was apprehended
there."

Thirty plants in 25 seperate
containers were seized. Thomas
now faces a charge of cultiva
tion, a felony, which could result
in a year's imprisonment or an
unspecified fine. A preliminary
hearing in Palo Alto Municipal
Court has been scheduled for
July 20.
Drug busts like these are
known to cause widespread
concern among certain mem
bers of the University commun
ity; but the arrest of Thomas
doesn't spell a new change in
Stanford police policy,
Niemeyer said.
"This type of arrest is in
frequent," he said. "The last one
took place months ago." Cases
of marijuana cultivation are
either "reported to us or ob
served by officers; we just have
too many other things to do than
to go snooping around on roofs
or in people's gardens."
