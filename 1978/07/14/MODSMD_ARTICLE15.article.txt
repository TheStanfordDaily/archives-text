# At home and abroad: the Stanford Chorus performs
## 
### Shirley Gines 
Last year the Stanford Chorus
was invited to Rome to be the
official choir when St. Paul's
church dedicated its new doors.
"That was the first time that the
Archbishop of Canterbury and
the Pope had ever met in a pub
lic function," said Bill Ramsey,
director of Stanford's choral ac
tivities for the past three years.
When you picture a choir,
thoughts of either prepubesent
boys or community housewives
come to mind. But the Stanford
Choral Organization, which in
cludes the Chorale, the Chorus
and the summer Memorial
Church Choir, attracts many
types of people from the area.
"We get mostly student age
groups," said Ramsey. "We get
lots of medical students, people
from all student endeavors." His
wife sings in the choir. "Don
Stillwell, he teaches anatomy;
he's in there too."
For those who think that
choirs belong only in church,
think again. Stanford's choral
groups have sung all over — in
cluding national conventions of
choral directors. The Chorus has
even been the San Francisco
Symphony's official chorus for
many years. Of course, they sing

regularly on Sundays.
"Last year, not counting the
church services, about 4000
people were in attendance at
our performances. During
spring, we did a Bach cantata
every Sunday, complete with an
orchestra and a soloist," said
Ramsey. And they don't just do
"choral music" either. "We can,
and we do, almost any kind of
music, from jazz to 16th century
masses based on some sort of
sacred, mystical text."
Perhaps part of the choirs'
success is due to Bill Ramsey
himself. He chooses and pre
pares the music and directs the
choir. Music books line his wall.
On the other side, a piano. You
would think his only interest is
music. But he's just as intent on
details with a choir as with his
other interest, Italian cooking.
He grows his own Italian herbs
— cicoria, rucchetta (pro
nounced rugetta, he em
phasized), and basilico. "You
know, you can get the best her
ring baccala at San Lorenzo," he
said. San Lorenzo is an open
market in Florence.

He lived in Rome for three
years and speaks Italian fluently.
Once, while shopping in an Ita
lian cheese store in San Jose,
someone asked, "How long
have you been living in the
States? You have a wonderful
American accent." While in
Rome four years ago, he studied
with Maestro Muigi Ricci, "who
is, I suppose, one of the best
known voice teachers in the
world. He was 83. I bet he's still
teaching."
But it's obvious that music is
Ramsey's main interest. He has
practically done the musical
gamut — clarinetist, pianist,
conductor, singer in a hole-in
the-wall club; worked with op
era, oratorios, psalms and pop
songs.
Ramsey invites anyone "who
just wants to sing" to join the
Summer Memorial Church
Choir. And those who want to
see them perform, come to
Memorial Church on Sunday,
Aug. 13 at 11 a.m. This time the
performance will be psaims ar
ranged by Leonard Bernstein.
