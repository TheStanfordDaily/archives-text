# Low alumni turnout
## Trustee election review 
### 
A steady decline in the
number of returned ballots has
lead the Stanford Alumni As
sociation Executive Committee
(AEC) to plan a formal review of
the trustee election process.
The recent trustee elections
drew only a 15 percent alumni
response.
"We're going to take a long,
serious look at the whole pro
cess," said William Stone, di
rector of the Alumni Associa
tion. "I think that the AEC and
the trustees are in complete
agreement as to the value of
that action."

Four alumni have been
elected biannually since 1970
to four-year terms on the board
by mailed ballot sent to all
Stanford graduates.
The number of ballots re
turned has been steadily de
clining from a 28 percent rate
the first year. Of the 110,995
ballots mailed in the recent
election only 16,859 were re
turned (522 of these were ruled
ineligible by the selection
committee).
He stressed that "we are not
in an enormous hurry" to

begin the review, but he indi
cated that it ought to begin this
summer.
Stone offered two explana
tions for the decline in votes
cast. "First," he said, "it could
be that the board has become
something that just doesn't
grab people where they live."
Alternatively he suggested that
the 15 percent turnout rate
"might indicate a higher level
of satisfaction with the course
that the University has taken
than that reached when we
were in the middle of the Viet
nam war."
