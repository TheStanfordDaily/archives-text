What is perfection ? Perfection
is three ineffably elegant, tre
mendously talented singers
you've never heard of perform
ing songs many of which you've
never heard of in a tiny theater
that you've undoubtedly never
heard of.
Let me get specific. "Side by
Side by Sondheim," which
opened Tuesday night at the
American Conservatory
Theatre's Marines' Theater on
Sutter and Mason in San Fran
cisco, is the greatest thing to de
scend on San Francisco since
the It's It. It has topical jokes,
charming and seemingly spon
taneous chatter, no overbearing
sets or distracting props and
only two (count 'em,fwo pianos)
— no strings to hide what's not
there in the first place. This is a
class show, with class perfor
mers in a moderately classy thea
ter.

It has topical jokes, charming and
seemingly spontaneous chatter, no
overbearing sets or distracting props
and only two (count 'em, two)
pianos . . .

There's nothing like flogging a
dead metaphor to make it run
further, but "Side" is in a class
by itself. It is a musical revue
featuring songs from some of
Sondheim's more obscure
works ("Anyone Can Whistle,"
"Do I Hear a Waltz?") as well as
from his smash successes (A
Funny Thing Happened On the
Way to the Forum," "Com
pany," "Follies," "West Side
Story," "A Little Night Music,"
"Gypsy," etc.)
Sondheim can artfully man
uever a lyric to suit any theme,
but his favorites happen to be
Marriage and New York; he en
joys a love-hate relationship
with both 'indeed, it helped him
rake in thousands). His tunes
aren't bad either, although my
motherclaims she can't hum any
song for which he has written
the music. I find a few, such as

"I'm Still Here" from "Follies,"
done show-stoppingly by Carol
Swarbrick, infinitely hummable.
And what about "Comedy To
night" from "Forum ?" Mom
must have a tin ear.
Sondheim salute
But wait, I should explain the
show. Three people, two wo
men, one man, who sing un
nervingly well stand up on
stage and salute Sondheim. To
their right (our left) sits a man
whose job it is to read wisec
racks from a music stand and oc
casionally imitate W.C. Fields
and David Brinkley, both of
whom his does quite excel
lently. The singers are Carol
Swarbrick, David Chaney and
Bonnie Schon, and they are
dynamite. Schon in particular
possesses a range that seems
almost biologically impossible.
She is tiny, too, but there is
enough power in her voice to

light up Cleveland. And while
Chaney can't help it if he's shor
ter than Swarbrick, somehow
they all look so good together.
Elliot Reid is the wiseacre who
sits on the side; he has an in
credibly familiar face — you've
seen and heard him everywhere,
but you couldn't say where
exactly. He does a competent
job of playing second banana to
the three top ones, even if mate
rial is a bit corny at times.
It may sound like the easy way
out, but there is really no way to
explain this show, you just have
to see it. It has something in it for
everybody, from the jaded synic
to the maniacal musical fan. Be
fore it sells out (and rumors have
already started circulating), I
suggest you make plans to see it
immediately, if not sooner. You
will be a better person for it.
