The plot of Hayavadan comes from an ancient collection of stories
in Sanskrit. The play centers around the entaslement of the three
main characters in the story: Devadatta, Kapila and Padmini. De
vadatta is a man of intellect, Kapila a man of the body; together they
form a harmonious unit. Then the beautiful Padmini enters their lives
and the harmony is broken. She is torn between the two men. The
struggle that develops is touching and fascinating.
Thomas Mann poses a problem of human identity and a search for
completeness by the three characters in a world of tangled relation
ships. Girish Karnad uses the conventions and motifs of folk tales and
folk theatre through masks, music, doll characters and a story within
a story. While Karnad narrates the main story lyrically, he poses the
same question in the Prologue and Epilogue using comedy as con
trast.
