Capricorn One • •
Hillsdale Cinema
The makers of this film would like to
have adventure and parody without
taking any responsibility for asking au
diences to believe the worst, but they
can't have it both ways. "Capricorn"
exploits the gullibility of US audiences.
It moves with the swiftness and palpita
tion of a good adventure, and James
Brolin, Sam Waterson and O.J.
Simpson make a spirited bunch of as
tronauts, but substantively the film is
thoughtless, and too casually set forth.
There's nothing to hold on to.
— Robert Ackley
Crease
Old Mill Six
Olivia-Newton-Boring is a blah actor
and John Travolta is a blah singer.
"Crease" was a blah play dependent on
acting and singing. Blah.

The Importance of Being Earnest *#»*
Thursday |uly 13-Wednesday July 19
Festival Cinema
The cast includes Sir Michael Redgrave,
Michael Dennis, Joan Greenwood,
Dorothy Tutin, Dame Edith Evans, Mar
garet Rutherford, and Miles Malleson.
The production is devoutly loyal to
Oscar Wilde's play. The movie, accord
ingly, is a straight-faced, understated
punch to our collective kidney; it's
success has grown primarily from some
impeccable performing. There's no
technical broughaha, and the

camerawork is strictly functional and as
a result "Earnest" might not appeal to
those weaned on flashier stuff, but we
ought not blame director Anthony As
quith for our own shortcomings.
Movies need not always be gripping to
be good — "Earnest" is the perfect
example.

The Man in the White Suit ••••
Thursday July 13-Wednesday |uly 19
Festival Cinema
Alec Cuiness creates a rip-proof, tea
proof, dirt-proof line of clothing; the
textile industry is less than pleased by
this threat to their livelihood. They set
out to crush him, but the movie is a
comedy, and Cuiness is too funny —
his performance as an ostracized
chemist and die-hard moral visionary
overrides the thematic machinations.
With "The Importance of Being Ear
nest."

Damien — The Omen II ••
Guild
The devil wastes his time and ours
herein, as he spends the vast majority
of his energy diddling with a heap of
characters that oculd easily have
been dispatched with early on in the
action. He seens kind of dumb, this
particular arch-fiend — a pretty good
sadist, but still kind of dumb. William
Holden gets it in the end.

The Deep
Moffet Drive-In
You begin to lose interest in this
movie somewhere between the sec
ond giant eel attack and the quasi
rape voodoo ritual. This is unfortu
nate, since the 30-shark feeding
frenzy, outboard motor fight and
third eel attack are still to be seen at
that time, not to mention assorted
drownings, bombings and harpoon
ings. Good adventure movies consist
of more than good adventures, and
every audience has its saturation
point; the makers of The Deep, by
ignoring the former truism, end up
proving the latter. Excitement unre
lieved relieves itself, and this movie is
a case in point.

An Unmarried Woman •••*
Biograph
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and
Tonto") warm and intelligent look at
70s divorce. Jill Clayburgh finally
gets a role which is equal to her ta
lent, and she doesn't disappoint.
The film is a bit slow in its middle
third, where the are some very weak
scenes with a therapist. However, in
general the film is comic and affect
ing without being cruel or sac
charine, Alan Bates stands out in a
fine supporting cast.
With "7% Solution."

The End
Old Mill Six
A sick plot played sickly. Burt
Reynolds gets in over his head and
tries to yuck-yuck his way out; each
shot he takes gets cheaper, and he
takes every one he sees. There is no
thing inherently the matter with
movies that insult and degrade, but
this one does it as a last resort and is
therefore to be avoided.
-J.N.
The Buddy Holly Story ••••
Fine Arts
Gary Busey's upper lip and expres
sive eyebrows are as fine as any in the
business; his showing as Buddy Holly
makes this picture worthwhile Busey
can sing, too, and he also is a marvel
ously idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the end
he holds it all together. "The Buddy
Holly Story" could have been better,
and that's no hooey, but its hard to
imagine a finer hick superstar than
the one we got right now. Hol
lywood's finest offering of the sea
son.
—J.N.
Close Encounters of the
Third Kind
Moffet
Steven Spielberg's wonderfully
childlike fantasy about man's first
meeting with extraterrestial beings.

Spielberg is clearly indebted to
Hitchcock, but in all the right ways,
and he has the youthful exuberance
that Hitchcock lost about four de
cades ago.
—R.L.
The Cheap Detective **
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big
Sleep" or "The Maltese Falcon,"
some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al- Z
most keeps you from realizing how 2
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise Z
Fletcher can be. Ann-fvVargret's 2
Rumanian cleavage is much in evi- 2
dence. 2

Park \
More dying, and less life. More act- >
ing by worse actors. An even worse ?
plot, and a stiffer shark. Better than J
"Orta tfte Killer Whale," but not <
much. Gratuitous and boring. With Z
Roy Scheider, Lorraine Grey and 2
Murray Hamilton; without Richard I
Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw. Z

F.I.S.T. *• \
Millbrae s
Employ's "The Godfather" films' 7
scope but lacks their depth. This 2
story of the epic rise and fall of a £
union leader reminds one especially >
of the Michael Corleone section of 7
"Godfather II"; to excess, in fact. The ?
Congressional hearings and the mur- s
ders from that film are unabashedly sand
—and in comparison, badly — im- <
itated here.
The director, Norman lewison, <
asks the audience to accept way too c
much, and he also fails to give the Z
film any sense of consistently believ- 2
able passion or tension. His surface Z
approach to the material is the film's z
biggest liability. What the movie de- 2
sperately needed was a director with 7
sociological (and artistic) insight; i.e., 7
someone like Francis Ford Coppola. ?!
The film is kept from becoming V
abysmal by Sylvester Stallone's gal- V
vanic, if uneven, performance as j;
johnny Kovacs, member and eventu- j;
ally leader, of F.I.S.T. (Federation of v
Interstate Truckers). His performance £
contains the film's only moments of <<
passion. These moments only serve
to heighten the remainder of the
film's frustrating somberness and
emotional emptiness.
