# 'A' stamps rejected by foreign countries

Los Angeles (AP) â€” Letter writ
ers in the United States might
have had to accept the new 15-
cent stamp introduced in May.
But foreign countries aren't ac
cepting the new stamp because
it does not carry any cash value
on its face, a postal official says.
Letters hearing the stamp
mailed out of the United States
are being refused by foreign na
tions, a postal service employee
said here Wednesday.
The Postal Service is aware of
the problem, but continues to
send such mail out of the coun
try "as a public service," accord
ing to Caroline Murphy, public
information officer for the Postal
Service here.
"We send them on and hope
the foreign country will accept
it," although none will, she said.
Once the letters are returned,
the stamps cannot be reused
and customers cannot get a re
fund, she said.
"Every postal clerk knows

about the restrictions," she said.
"If they are aware that someone
is buying stamps for foreign
mail, they will advise them about
the stamps."
But, she added, "we can't go
through every piece of mail."
There was no estimate of the
amount of foreign mail that has
been returned because of the
stamp.
The bright orange stamps with
a stylized eagle and the letter
"A" were printed without a de
nomination as a contingency
measure by the Postal Service.
Officials were concerned they
would not have time to print
stamps in 15-cent denomina
tions because the Postal Service
board of governors waited until
the last minute to decide on the
new rate for first-class mail.
The Postal Service apparently
intends to continue selling the
stamps until enough new stamps
with the 15 cent cash value on
them can be printed.
