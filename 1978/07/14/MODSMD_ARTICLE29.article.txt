# Rockefeller fortune pervades American life
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Unlike the
original ]ohn D., today's Roc
kefellers do not offer dimes to
people they meet on the street.
But like the man who made
them one of the world's richest
families, the Rockefellers shape
theirag.. 1 . There have been three
Governors Rockefeller, a vice
president, philanthropists, dip
lomats, conservationists and
businessmen.
With a memorial service for
|ohn D. Rockefeller 3d yester
day, B4 Rockefellers share a for
'une estimated at more than $1
billion. More millions are in
vested in the family's charitable
foundations.
Add to that countless political
and business connections. "In
family power in the United
States," said a Wall Street ex
pert, "there is nothing that en
faintly resembles the Rockt el
lers."
Their power was born of John
D. Sr.'s Standard Oil and of
sleepless nights he spent trying
to invest his billion.
"Your fortune is rolling up,
rolling up like an avalanche!"
Frederick Gates, manager of his
holdings, once told him. "You

must distribute it faster than it
grows! If you do not, it will crush
you, and your children, and your
children's children."
The clan's patriarch gave away
$500 million, a sum matched by
his son, John D. Jr. "Junior's"
five sons and daughter were left
with about $240 million, which
has quadrupled since their
father's death in 1960. During
that time, $224 million went to
charity.
The family's works and
charities are part of the national
consciousness. Among them are
Rockefeller Center and the
Chase Manhattan Bank in New
York, colonial Williamsburg in
Virginia, Humboldt State Park in
California and Yosemite Na
tional Park.
But the sons and daughter dis
tinguished themselves in other
ways, too. John D. 3d devoted
his time to art and population
control. Abby, the most re
served Rockefeller, died in 1976
after a lifetime of endowing the
arts. Winthrop, once governor
of Arkansas, died in 1973.
Nelson is the most famous of
the surviving brothers. Now 70,
he was appointed to the vice

presidency in 1973 after 15 years
as governor of New York and
after periodic quests for the
presidency.
David Rockefeller does not
have Nelson's fame, but as
chairman of the board of Chase
Manhattan, the nation's third
largest bank with $43.8 billion in
deposits, he now may have more
clout.
The third surviving brother,
Laurance, is known for his con
servation work. He has served
presidential commissions on re
creation and the environment,
and founded the American Con
servation Association.
From the instant of birth,
every Rockefeller owns a share
of the family fortune. The best
known of the new generation is
Gov. John D. "Jay" Rockefeller
4th of West Virginia.

"I think I have as interesting
and exciting a job as anyone
could have," David Rockefeller
said several years ago. "But I
don't think I've really convinced
my children of the fact, at least to
the point where they're anxious
to go into business."
David's eldest daughter,
Abby, 35, is a case in point. She
rebelled against the family mill
ions but then found money was
a powerful tool. "I gave to every
thing: civil rights, draft resis
tance, teach-ins, radical educa
tions, everything," Abby told
Peter Collier and David
Horowitz, authors of "The Roc
kefellers: An American
Dynasty."
Nelson's son Michael disap
peared in New Guinea in 1961
and was never found. The other
Rockefellers include Nelson's

sons Rodman, who runs many
family ventures in South
America, and Steven, a theology
professor at Middlebu ry College
in Vermont whose marriage and
divorce to a maid, Anne-Marie
Rasmussen, made news in the
19605, and Laurance's daughter
Marion, who is eking out a living
with her husband and two chil
dren on a California farm.
Meanwhile, the manager of
the family holdings has com
plained that some Rockefellers
are so little interested in their
money that they balk at meeting
with their investment counselor
even once a year.
"The world is in a state of rapid
transition and I think that. . .we
as a family are in a transitional
state, too," John D. 3d once
said. "I'm not sure yet just what
it will add up to in the end."

said several years ago. "But I
don't think I've really convinced
my children of the fact, at least to
the point where they're anxious
to go into business."
David's eldest daughter,
Abby, 35, is a case in point. She
rebelled against the family mill
ions but then found money was
a powerful tool. "I gave to every
thing: civil rights, draft resis
tance, teach-ins, radical educa
tions, everything," Abby told
Peter Collier and David
Horowitz, authors of "The Roc
kefellers: An American
Dynasty."

New York (AP) — Unlike the
original ]ohn D., today's Roc
kefellers do not offer dimes to
people they meet on the street.
But like the man who made
them one of the world's richest
families, the Rockefellers shape
theirag.. 1 . There have been three
Governors Rockefeller, a vice
president, philanthropists, dip
lomats, conservationists and
businessmen.
With a memorial service for
|ohn D. Rockefeller 3d yester
day, B4 Rockefellers share a for
'une estimated at more than $1
billion. More millions are in
vested in the family's charitable
foundations.
Add to that countless political
and business connections. "In
family power in the United
States," said a Wall Street ex
pert, "there is nothing that en
faintly resembles the Rockt el
lers."
Their power was born of John
D. Sr.'s Standard Oil and of
sleepless nights he spent trying
to invest his billion.
"Your fortune is rolling up,
rolling up like an avalanche!"
Frederick Gates, manager of his
holdings, once told him. "You

must distribute it faster than it
grows! If you do not, it will crush
you, and your children, and your
children's children."
The clan's patriarch gave away
$500 million, a sum matched by
his son, John D. Jr. "Junior's"
five sons and daughter were left
with about $240 million, which
has quadrupled since their
father's death in 1960. During
that time, $224 million went to
charity.
The family's works and
charities are part of the national
consciousness. Among them are
Rockefeller Center and the
Chase Manhattan Bank in New
York, colonial Williamsburg in
Virginia, Humboldt State Park in
California and Yosemite Na
tional Park.
But the sons and daughter dis
tinguished themselves in other
ways, too. John D. 3d devoted
his time to art and population
control. Abby, the most re
served Rockefeller, died in 1976
after a lifetime of endowing the
arts. Winthrop, once governor
of Arkansas, died in 1973.
Nelson is the most famous of
the surviving brothers. Now 70,
he was appointed to the vice

presidency in 1973 after 15 years
as governor of New York and
after periodic quests for the
presidency.
David Rockefeller does not
have Nelson's fame, but as
chairman of the board of Chase
Manhattan, the nation's third
largest bank with $43.8 billion in
deposits, he now may have more
clout.
The third surviving brother,
Laurance, is known for his con
servation work. He has served
presidential commissions on re
creation and the environment,
and founded the American Con
servation Association.
From the instant of birth,
every Rockefeller owns a share
of the family fortune. The best
known of the new generation is
Gov. John D. "Jay" Rockefeller
4th of West Virginia.

"I think I have as interesting
and exciting a job as anyone
could have," David Rockefeller
said several years ago. "But I
don't think I've really convinced
my children of the fact, at least to
the point where they're anxious
to go into business."
