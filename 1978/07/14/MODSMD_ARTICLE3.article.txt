# Petitions circulate urging renter relief
## 
### Vickie Evangel 
Renters want relief and are
organizing community action
groups to circulate petitions in
favor of sharing in Prop. 13's
boon to landlords.
"We didn't know what to do,
but we knew we had to do
something," said Ron Summa,
chairman of a rent relief action
board in Palo Alto. Summa or
ganized an open meeting in
coordination with the Tenants
Union on June 22 to see what
renters wanted and what they
could do to lower their rental
payments.
"That meeting was attended
by over 50 concerned renters
ready to take action," said
Summa.
The passage of Prop. 13 low
ered property taxes and there
fore should have lowered ren
tal rates, Summa said. "I per
sonally know of several renters
whose payments have in
creased since the passage of
Prop. 13."
He added that "renters pay
for all property taxes . . . and

so I can't understand why land
lords are increasing their rents
when they could easily be low
ering them."
Palo Alto renters are circulat
ing petitions to put an initiative
on the Nov. 7 ballot. This initia
tive would require landlords to
pass on their Prop. 13 property
tax savings to tenants. Moun
tain View renters have also
taken this action and last night
Menlo Park citizens joined in
the movement.
Menlo Park committee
chairman Susan Nerlinger said
that "since (property) taxes
were lowered, it's our right as
renters to get money back."
She noted that 25 percent of a
tenant's rent goes toward
property taxes. The other 75
percent gos towards mortgage
and operating expenses.
Menlo Park's meeting was at
tended by about 20 concerned,
angry tenants. They agreed to
ask, as did the committees in
the other two cities, for a 100
percent return of tax savings.
