# Labor, management differ
## Postal strike predicted 
### Joel Dickholtz 
"Unless the management starts displaying a
willingness to bargain, compromise and deal
with people, you can almost count on a postal
strike," said Mary Pulvers, public information
officer for the Palo Alto local of a postal workers'
union.
"And make no mistake about it — a postal
strike would traumatize the nation," he added.
But Jerry Reynolds, a spokesman for the U.S.
Postal Service, said yesterday, "There won't be a
strike.
"The Postal Service is determined to negotiate
a contract fair to the people of the United States
and the employees of the post office."
The current postal worker contract will expire
midnight Thursday and a strike may result if no
new contract is agreed to by that date. A hand
out distributed by postal workers Wednesday
said that while the workers would prefer having
a new contract to stopping work, a strike may be
inevitable.
Pulvers said management has thus far been
uncooperative in negotiations, doing nothing
more than submitting its original proposal and

refusing to compromise.
Reynolds responded that, "The proper place
to negotiate is at the bargaining table, and we
(the management) remain committed to bargain
in earnest and good faith, in order to reach an
agreement by midnight July 20."
More than 85 percent of the postal workers
currently belong to one of four postal unions,
each of which is a part of the AFL-CIO.
According to Pulvers, the primary concern of
the workers is improved working conditions
rather than pay. He said that while the workload
has increased significantly in the past several
years, the number of employees has steadily
declined.
This process, he said, causes mail deliveries to
cover "horribly long routes and carry exceed
ingly heavy bags," he said.
Reynolds said the decline in the number of
employees is part of a postal reorganization
aimed at making the system self-supporting
which began in 1970. He said that much more of
the postal process is mechanized today than in
1970, making the system more efficient.

A picketer in front of the Post Office discusses the alleged deteriora
tion in working conditions for postal employees. The unions currently
negotiating a new Postal Service contract have said that since 1970,
when a major postal reorganization began, the volume of mail has
increased markedly while the number of postal workers has declined,
causing overburdened employees.
