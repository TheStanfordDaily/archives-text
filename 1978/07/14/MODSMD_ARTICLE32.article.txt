Young causes another furor
Geneva, Switzerland — U.S. Ambassador An
drew Young was quoted Wednesday as saying
"there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of
political prisoners in the United States," and
drew immediate fire from his own government.
Yesterday, Young modified his initial state
ment by saying that he did not mean Russians
are freer than Americans when he spoke of
"political prisoners" in the United States.
Several times since his appointment in 1977,
Young has been forced to retreat from or exp
lain statements that appeared to disagree with
administration positions. There have been
periodic calls for his ouster.
In the latest flap, the House of Representa
tives killed on a 293-82 vote a resolution from
Rep. Larry McDonald (D-Ga.), calling ( .o>
Young's impeachment.
Also, Republicans including Sen. Barry Gold
water of Arizona, National GOP Chairman Bill
Brock and several representatives called for
Young's resignation, while House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill, a Democrat like Young, told
reporters: "I think Andy could have done well if
he had curbed his tongue at this particular time
. . . I don't believe there is such a thing as a
political prisoner in America and I don't believe
Andy believes there is such a thing either."
Presidential press secretary Jody Powell said
Young's statement did not reflect U.S. policy
and the State Department's press spokesman
said the department did not agree with it.
But in an interview yesterday with the British
Broadcasting Corp., Young, in Geneva for a
meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Coun
cil, said he does not feel at odds with Carter on
foreign policy.
Cleveland cops go on strike
Cleveland — Cleveland police went on strike
last night over the dismissal of 13 patrolmen who
refused to obey an order by Mayor Dennis
Kucinich to patrol crime-ridden housing pro
jects alone in daytime hours.
The police rejected a last minute offer by the
mayor to rescind the order that led to the firings
and Kucinich responded by saying he would
seek an injunction to block the walkout, saying
the strike would be in violation of police con
tract provisions that bar such job actions.
Less than an hour before the strike deadline,
Kucinich made what he called a major conces
sion. The 31-year-old mayor said he would allow
two-man patrols because "of the climate of fear
and hysteria" surrounding the one-man as
signments.
But he said he would not yield on reinstating
the officers because they had the right to appeal
their dismissals through civil service channels.
Ethics committee vs. McFall
Washington — The House ethics committee
launched formal proceedings Wednesday
against former Democratic Whip John McFall
and three other current congressmen on al
leged ethics violations in the South Korean
influence-buying affair.
McFall said he expects to be cleared in ethics
committee proceedings that will try to deter
mine if the allegations are true and if the com
mittee should recommend punishment by the
full House.
The "statement of alleged violations" ap

proved against McFall accuses him of accepting
$4000 from South Korean rice merchant
Tongsun Park "under circumstances which
might be construed by reasonable persons as
influencing the performance of his government
duties."
The panel yesterday also cleared nine other
congressmen who took money from Park. And it
exonerated House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
from any unethical conduct, saying his only
"questionable propriety was to accept two par
ties in his honor paid by Tongsun Park."
Students hurt by Prop. 13
Lansing, Mich. — Low-income students in
California are hurt most by higher education
budget cutbacks in the aftermath of Proposition
13, an education professor at San Jose State Uni
versity said yesterday.
Some disadvantaged students may have to
give up college, he said.
"Not all low-income students will drop out,
but it will be more difficult for them to compete
in the economic marketplace than it is for my
kids, who are advantaged," he added.
Carter meets with Schmidt
Bonn, West Germany — President Carter ar
rived in Germany last night and got an un
scheduled greeting from Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, one of his potential adversaries at a
seven-nation economic summit marred by ad
vance bickering.
"We don't expect to solve all the problems,
but we expect to leave the summit with renewed
commitment ... to having a better future for
our people," Carter said at a White House de
parture ceremony. "This is a sober time. It's one
of reassessment, not one of discouragement."
Two escape with $8 million
New York — Two armed men seized a car
transporting securities in Lower Manhattan's fi
nancial district yesterday, forced the driver to go
to a nearby getaway car, and then escaped with
$8 million in negotiable securities, authorities
said.
The stolen negotiables were in denomina
tions of about $10,000 and were described under
normal circumstances as easily cashed with any
banker or broker. However, news of the rob
bery was expected to make it more difficult to
dispose of the notes.
China cuts aid to Albania
Tokyo — China announced yesterday it was
cutting off economic and military assistance to
Albania because of the tiny communist nation's
"anti-China course."
The Chinese said their help had amounted to
about $5 billion over 24 years.
China said it also was recalling Chinese
economic and military experts working in Al
bania — at one time one of China's closest
friends and ideological partners.

"Not all low-income students will drop out,
but it will be more difficult for them to compete
in the economic marketplace than it is for my
kids, who are advantaged," he added.
Carter meets with Schmidt
Bonn, West Germany — President Carter ar
rived in Germany last night and got an un
scheduled greeting from Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, one of his potential adversaries at a
seven-nation economic summit marred by ad
vance bickering.
"We don't expect to solve all the problems,
but we expect to leave the summit with renewed
commitment ... to having a better future for
our people," Carter said at a White House de
parture ceremony. "This is a sober time. It's one
of reassessment, not one of discouragement."
Two escape with $8 million
New York — Two armed men seized a car
transporting securities in Lower Manhattan's fi
nancial district yesterday, forced the driver to go
to a nearby getaway car, and then escaped with
$8 million in negotiable securities, authorities
said.
The stolen negotiables were in denomina
tions of about $10,000 and were described under
normal circumstances as easily cashed with any
banker or broker. However, news of the rob
bery was expected to make it more difficult to
dispose of the notes.

Young causes another furor
Geneva, Switzerland — U.S. Ambassador An
drew Young was quoted Wednesday as saying
"there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of
political prisoners in the United States," and
drew immediate fire from his own government.
Yesterday, Young modified his initial state
ment by saying that he did not mean Russians
are freer than Americans when he spoke of
"political prisoners" in the United States.
Several times since his appointment in 1977,
Young has been forced to retreat from or exp
lain statements that appeared to disagree with
administration positions. There have been
periodic calls for his ouster.
In the latest flap, the House of Representa
tives killed on a 293-82 vote a resolution from
Rep. Larry McDonald (D-Ga.), calling ( .o>
Young's impeachment.
Also, Republicans including Sen. Barry Gold
water of Arizona, National GOP Chairman Bill
Brock and several representatives called for
Young's resignation, while House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill, a Democrat like Young, told
reporters: "I think Andy could have done well if
he had curbed his tongue at this particular time
. . . I don't believe there is such a thing as a
political prisoner in America and I don't believe
Andy believes there is such a thing either."
Presidential press secretary Jody Powell said
Young's statement did not reflect U.S. policy
and the State Department's press spokesman
said the department did not agree with it.
But in an interview yesterday with the British
Broadcasting Corp., Young, in Geneva for a
meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Coun
cil, said he does not feel at odds with Carter on
foreign policy.
Cleveland cops go on strike
Cleveland — Cleveland police went on strike
last night over the dismissal of 13 patrolmen who
refused to obey an order by Mayor Dennis
Kucinich to patrol crime-ridden housing pro
jects alone in daytime hours.
The police rejected a last minute offer by the
mayor to rescind the order that led to the firings
and Kucinich responded by saying he would
seek an injunction to block the walkout, saying
the strike would be in violation of police con
tract provisions that bar such job actions.
Less than an hour before the strike deadline,
Kucinich made what he called a major conces
sion. The 31-year-old mayor said he would allow
two-man patrols because "of the climate of fear
and hysteria" surrounding the one-man as
signments.
But he said he would not yield on reinstating
the officers because they had the right to appeal
their dismissals through civil service channels.
Ethics committee vs. McFall
Washington — The House ethics committee
launched formal proceedings Wednesday
against former Democratic Whip John McFall
and three other current congressmen on al
leged ethics violations in the South Korean
influence-buying affair.
McFall said he expects to be cleared in ethics
committee proceedings that will try to deter
mine if the allegations are true and if the com
mittee should recommend punishment by the
full House.
The "statement of alleged violations" ap

proved against McFall accuses him of accepting
$4000 from South Korean rice merchant
Tongsun Park "under circumstances which
might be construed by reasonable persons as
influencing the performance of his government
duties."
The panel yesterday also cleared nine other
congressmen who took money from Park. And it
exonerated House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
from any unethical conduct, saying his only
"questionable propriety was to accept two par
ties in his honor paid by Tongsun Park."
Students hurt by Prop. 13
Lansing, Mich. — Low-income students in
California are hurt most by higher education
budget cutbacks in the aftermath of Proposition
13, an education professor at San Jose State Uni
versity said yesterday.
Some disadvantaged students may have to
give up college, he said.
"Not all low-income students will drop out,
but it will be more difficult for them to compete
in the economic marketplace than it is for my
