## 
### 
Former President Gerald
Ford will help dedicate the
Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building next Thursday in front
of Hoover Tower.
The memorial, parallel to the
Lou Henry Hoover building
and identical to it in appear
ance, is the latest addition to
the Hoover Institution,
founded in 1919 by Herbert
Hoover.
The federal memorial in
cludes a spacious courtyard
with two pavilions, one hous
ing an exhibit of rare docu
ments.
The new building will be the
federal government's only
memorial to Herbert Hoover,
and the only one to a former
president placed by Congress
on the West Coast. The five
story building will house the
archives and special collec
tions of the institution, offices
for institution fellows, the in
stitution press, and rooms for
seminars and conferences.
The new facilities will serve
the needs of scholars for manv

years to come, said Institution
Director Glenn Campbell,
making them the fitting memo
rial to a man who dedicated his
life to the wellbeing of man
kind.
The memorial was funded by
a federal grant approved by
Congress during the Ford ad
ministration, matched by pri
vate funds.
Ground was broken for the
$7.5 million memorial in July
1976. At that time Allan
Hoover, the former president's
son, observed that his father
wasn't much of a believer in
stone monuments.
Allan, along with President
Richard Lyman and U.S. Sen.
Mark Hatfield of Oregon, will
join Ford in the dedication
ceremonies.
Campbell commented that,
"The analysis of major foreign
and domestic issues and the
contributions to knowledge
that can now go forward in
these buildings is the real
memorial to Herbert Hoover."
