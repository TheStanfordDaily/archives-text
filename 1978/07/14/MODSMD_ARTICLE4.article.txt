# Ginzburg sentenced to eight years
## Shcharansky to get verdict today 
### 
Moscow (AP) — Alexander
Ginzburg, a veteran of the dis
sident movement and the
Soviet "Gulag" prison system,
was sentenced to eight years at
hard labor yesterday, ending
one of two trials that have
drawn world attention and
frayed U.S.-Soviet detente.
Ginzburg's wife, Irina, who
was barred from the last two
days of the trial, called the sen
tence "a tragic farce . . . .They
spit on the West so openly and
ignore public opinion."
In the other major trial, of
Jewish activist Anatoly
Shcharansky for espionage,
the prosecutor said the 30-
year-old defendant deserved
the maximum allowable pen
alty, death, but he called in
stead for a 15-year sentence,
saying he was taking into ac
count Shcharansky'syouth and
the fact that this was his first
trial.
The verdict is expected to
day.
Sentence
In the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius, Catholic activist Vik
toras Pyatkus, like Ginsburg
and Shcharansky a member of
the now-decimated "Helsinki"
human rights group, was sen
tenced to 10 years hard labor
and five years of exile within
the Soviet Union, friends re
ported.
In front of the courthouse in
Kaluga, 100 miles south of
here, Ginzburg's supporters
chanted, "Alek! Alek! Alek!"
as a judge explained the sen
tence to Western reporters
outside.
Then a police wagon, its

siren wailing, sped away from
the building. The shouts rose
and the defendant's friends
tossed bouquets of flowers at
its hood. Western reporters
were barred from the trials.
In one of the first reactions
to the Ginzburg sentence,
West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher con
demned it and said, "We ex
pect that the verdict against
him ... is not the last word."
A growing sentiment for re
taliatory action was evident in
the U.S. Congress. An As
sociated Press survery of
senators showed a broad
cross-section in favor of curb
ing economic and technology
cal assistance to Moscow.
In Geneva, after holding
arms negotiations with the
Soviets, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance met with Natalia
Shtiglits, who says she is
Shcharansky's wife but whose
marital status was questioned
in the Shcharansky trial.
She said she spoke with
Rosalynn Carter by telephone
Wednesday night and that the
American first lady assured her
of White House support in her
struggle to free Shcharansky.
Ginsburg, 41, an associate of
exiled author Alexander Sol
zhenitsyn and key member of
the Moscow dissident move
ment, was convicted of anti-
Soviet agitation and prop
aganda.
He had been accused of dis
tributing such "anti-Soviet"
material as Solzhenitsyri's
"Gulag Archipelago," a
chronicle of the Soviet penal
system.
