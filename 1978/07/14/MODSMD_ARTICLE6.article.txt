# Another version of KMT incident
## 
### 
Wu, Woo

We are not amused to see our
names used in a deliberately
misleading context in a column
by Veh Bing-hui and Sun Tieh
new (Daily, June 27), which is a
reply to the Daily's June 7 report
on the armed attack on
Chinatown demonstrators May
20.
As reported by the Daily and
The San Francisco Journal, there
was an anti-Chiang rally and
march protesting the inaugura
tion of Chiang Ching-kuo as the
sixth president of Taiwan on May
22. Concurrently, there was a
pro-Chiang celebration with lion
dancers and uniformed men
from the White Crane kung-fu
school outside the Kuomintang
(KMT) headquarters near the in
tersection of Stockton and Clay
streets. Both events were attract
ing large numbers of onlookers.
We were among the crowd
watching the celebration near
the KMT building and thus
eyewitnesses to the ensuing
fight. In stating that we were
"mingling among the de
monstrators and assisting
them," Yeh and Sun weresimply
making an attempt to divert the
readers' attention from the ugly
acts of the KMT supporters.
A few facts suffice to refute
Veh and Sun's elaborate version
of the story of the melee. First of
all, they first wrote that the mar
chers were "demonstrating at
the premises" of the KMT head
quarters; one sentence later,
the marchers were said to have
"Begun to march toward the
premises" (our italics).
This self-contradictory ac
count fails entirely to hold up to
scrutiny. We saw — and the
photos published in The San
Francisco Journal show — how
far away the demonstrators ac
tually were from the KMT build
ing when the fight started. As far
as we know, the KMT premises
do not extend to the entire
Stockton-Clay intersection as
well as the two blocks of Clay
Street down which the attackers
chased the marchers.
Yeh and Sun also claimed that
they were unexpectedly in
volved in the fight when they
were arriving at a cocktail party.
We saw a group of men, includ
ing Yeh and Sun, coming out of
the KMT headquarters armed —
six-foot poles in their hands
when the demonstrators were
still about one block away from
the Stockton and Clay intersec
tion. Their weapons were not, as

Yeh and Sun claimed, makeshift
stripped-down flagpoles
snatched in the heat of the fight.
These men were in formation
blocking traffic and showing
their force even before the mar
chers reached the intersection.
If all this does not indicate pre
meditation and provocation, we
don't know what does.
Moreover, it should be noted
that there were a lot of women,
children and elderly Chinese
among the marchers. After their
initial onslaught, the attackers
chased the marchers down two
blocks of Clay Street, hurling
splintered wood and glass after
them, endangering anyone who
happened to be in the street.
Such behavior can by no
stretch of the imagination be
termed "an act of rescue and
self defense."
Finally, if the fight had indded
started the way Yeh and Sun
claimed it did, with a 60-year-old
man victimized and an equally
innocent "good smaritan" (sic)
getting seven stitches on the
head, why was there absolutley
no mention of this "tragedy" in
any of the newspapers, Chinese
or English, pro-KMT or anti-
KMTI before Yeh and Sun wrote
about it over a month after the
incident?
Yeh and Sun vehemently as
serted that the "atmosphere of
suspicion and fear" was merelya
Stanford Daily creation. Why,
then, did Fred Wu, one of the
authors of this article, find a KMT
flag stuck on the door of his
apartment the second night after
the Daily exposed Yeh and Sun's
involvement in the Chinatown
melee?
It seems that, after having
been caught red-handed, Yeh
and Sun were desperate for
means to block all exposure and
criticism. Hence their witch
hunting attempt to malign us.
Hence also their resentment
against the Daily staff for writing
about activities that infringe
upon the rights of Chinese stu
dents at Stanford.
With their complaint about
the timing of the Daily articles —
what they call a "hit-and-run
guerilla tactic" — their accusat
ory mentality reaches new
heights of absurdity. We feel we
need to say no more.
