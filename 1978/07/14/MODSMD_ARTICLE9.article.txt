# Ban food ads for kids?

In response to mounting pres
sure from various consumer ag
encies, the Federal Trade Com
mission (FTC) is currently con
sidering a band on advertising
during peak hours of child tele
vision viewing.
Specifically, objection has
been raised to the promotion of
sugar-sweetened breakfast
cereals and other products.
These items have been impli
cated in the increasing preva
lence of dental caries among
young people and the develop
ment of poor eating habits as
adults, predisposing to such
diseases as obesity, high blood
pressure, coronary artery dis
ease, arteriosclerosis and diab

etes.
There are several issues raised
by this proposal. First, such a
ban would not guarantee that
the purchase of "junk food" by
mothers would decrease sig
nificantly. Several years ago,
television cigarette advertising
was prohibited, yet the inci
dence of smoking has continued
to increase.
Alternatively, adhering to the
tobacco analogy, the FTC might
require that the amounts and
hazards of sugar in children's
products be printed on the pac
kage. This tactic would probably
fail as well, based on its apparent
ineffectiveness with regard to
cigarettes and saccharine-

containing products.
It has been argued strongly
that children are a select group
in that they are not in a position
to know what is good or bad for
them. While this is true, it is also
true that Mom does the grocery
shopping, so that a plan to
reeducate mothers might be
more successful than one which
bans the brainwashing of chil
dren.
In any case, it is also undeni
ably true? that many adults da not
know what is good for them,
particularly in the area of nutri
tion. Many of those who do find
it difficult to break old dietary
habits to which they have
adhered for decades. Hence, if
we are to improve the eating
habits of our society as a whole,
we must encourage the de
velopment of good habits at an
early age.
The goal may be achieved via
emphasis in several areas. Nutri
tion instruction should be im
plemented into primary educa
tion during the early grades and
continued through secondary
school. Mass media can be used
constructively to educate pa
rents with regard to the benefits
of some foods and the hazards
of others.
At the same time, major man
ufacturers should be given in
centive to develop and advertise
more nutritous products, mak
ing them attractive to children.
