# Old critic looks at his task as new trustee
## 
### John Nielsen 
In 1969, when he was editor of the
Daily, Phillip Taubman wrote the first
section of what was to be a two-part
editorial on the Board of Trustees. In it
he argued that "progress has caught
up" with that body, adding that, "the
Board is about to experience the most
thoughtful, serious and powerful threat
to its existence since the University was
founded."
The trustees, said Taubman, had
"mindlessly retained a system of self
perpetuating membership selec
tion . . in which "one businessman
follows another, all are white, and all
are around or above 50."
Crucial flaw
The "crucial flaw" in the system was a
"lack of diversity" on the board; "the
case against the organization" was
"comprehensive, solid and persua
sive."
Phillip Taubman never wrote the
second editorial, which he had prom
ised would "discuss more specific
changes in Board structures" — he
graduated, went to work for Time
Magazine and now is an editor of Es
quire.
He is also a Stanford trustee, one of
four such persons recently chosen in an
alumni election. Eight alumni trustees
have been on the 35-person board con
tinuously since 1970 — four are elected
every two years to serve four year
terms.
Similar problems
As such Taubman will be returning to
deal with issues often similar to those
he found problematic as an under

graduate. He will help control invest
ments, and set the annual budget and
determine policies for operation and
control of the University; he will con
sider development proposals for Stan
ford land, study post-Bakke admissions
policies and puzzle over increasing de
pendence on federal funding.
How does Taubman, who "you'd
have called a student activist in those

days," intend to approach his position?
What does he intend to add to a group
that he once claimed had "stagnated in
antiquity of age, blandness of
background and mediocrity of deci-
will his fundamental princi
ples be as a trustee?
Learning
Taubman is the first to admit that "it's
something that I'm going to have to
learn a lot about." He is approaching
his new position with care, but says that
"my basic philosophy is that the board
shouldn't meddle in other than the
long-range affairs of the University, that
it shouldn't get involved in day-to-day
operations, that it should leave the
running of Stanford to the faculty, ad
ministration and students.
"The board is there to offer them
overall guidance and to bring to bear on
University affairs the perspective of
non-academic segments of society.
"It should do as little as possible,
frankly, when the board is actively in
volved in a specific Stanford cause or
issue, as trustee action is an indication
that something has broken down in the
self-governance of the University.
"When I was a student, the board was
enmeshed in the upheavals here — it
became a target for the radical move
ment at Stanford. It was a symbol of the
establishment and unfortunately fit the
part all too well at times."
Yet there are a few issues that Taub
man feels are inherently the responsi
bility of the trustees, questions whose
answers "are the charter respon
sibilities of the board."

Yet there are a few issues that
Taubman feels are inherently
the responsibility of the trus
tees, questions whose answers
"are the charter responsibilities
of the board."
One such is the development
and uses of land; another is "the
board's primary responsibility—
maintaining the financial sec
urity of the University."
"The best example," how
ever, "is investment policy."
Taubman cannot predict
"exactly where I'm going to
come out on it," because "I re
ally have not done enough re
search to have thought it
through," but he is more than
willing to explain the rudiments
of his position.
"Number one, apartheid is
unconscionable. Any American
support of apartheid, whether
passive or active, is inexcusable.
Any actions by American com
panies that in any way encour
age apartheid are intolerable. By
extention, any stockholder
complicity in American corpo
rate support of apartheid,
whether passive or active, is
wrong.

"That means that the Stanford
Board of Trustees, being collec
tively responsible for managing
the University's securities, must
do everything in its power to
discourage companies from
providing aid or comfort of apar
theid and the South African gov
ernment.
"I realize that there are several
ways for the University to make
its feelings felt but I believe that
the trustees cannot duck the is
sue, nor can they allow it to be
come bogged down in endless
debate.
"There's no perfect answer,
but of the imperfect answers, I'd
rather see the trustees go too far
in opposing apartheid than not
go far enough."
Phillip Taubman seems de
termined not to fit his under
graduate description of a trus
tee, in which he claimed that
they were "the first to claim that
disruption must be squashed,
rarely considering that there
might be cause for unrest." He is
apparently attempting to remain
consistent with earlier opinions,
to implement some of the
suggestions he never had a
chance to make.
