# Angolans predict trouble for Soviets

Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) â€” Angolan guerrilla
leaders here confidently predict the Marxist
government in Luanda, propped up by the
Soviet Union and protected by Cuban
troops, will suffer a similar fate to that of
U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
The leaders believe that, like the Ameri
cans in Vietnam, the Russians and Cubans
are new hands at counterinsurgency tactics
in African jungle and savannah terrain and
unfamiliar with the alien languages and cus
toms of the local people.
They also maintain, as do the indepen
dent analysts, that the Luanda government
would fall if either the foreign troops were
withdrawn or if free troops were withdrawn
or if free popular elections were to be held.
The guerrilla leaders and Western obser
vers here picture the Soviet Union as back
ing an undemocratic minority govern
ment.
Jorge Sangumba, foreign minister of
Jonas Savimbi's UNITA guerrilla army which
poses the biggest threat to the government,
sits behind a map of his country in his office
here and with a sweep of his hand declares:
"Angola will be the Soviet's Vietnam."
Reminiscent of American military aid to
South Vietnam in the 19605, Moscow today
has hundreds of military advisers in Angola
alongside up to 20,000 Cuban troops, ac
cording to Western intelligence sources.
A dozen Soviet generals reportedly ar
rived in Angola last month, demonstrating
to the guerrillas President Agostinho Neto's
dependence on foreign troops and also
forewarning them of a possible new military
offensive against them. All previous opera

tions to destroy them have failed.
But despite this support, UNITA, which is
the National Union for the Total Liberation
of Angola, controls more than a third of the
territory, about twice the size of Texas, and
half of the six million inhabitants, according
to Western diplomats here. And most of the
1.5 million inhabitants of six northern pro
vinces are believed by Western sources to
be loyal to the second biggest movement,
Holden Roberto's National Liberation
Front, the FNLA.
' Sangumba and Roberto are two of dozens
of Angolan rebel leaders who divide their
time between their Cuban-patrolled home
land and the sanctuary of this refugee
crowded central African capital.
A 32-year-old alumnus of Manhattan Col
lege in New York, Sangumba envisages an
escalation in the war against the forces of
President Neto.
Like many guerrilla leaders, Sangumba
says he spends about nine months of the
year in UNITA-held areas of southern and
central Angola.
Much of the remaining time is spent in
Kinshasa, a teeming, decaying city of 3 mill
ion inhabitants on the banks of the Congo
River which is vital to the resistance leaders
as a staging post for recruits, envoys and
supplies.
While Angolan guerrillas inside their
country persistently harrass Cuban and gov
ernment troops, their leaders outside
struggle for arms, supplies and money as
well as international recognition.
Samgumba sees UNITA's immediate
needs as anti-aircraft weapons to defend

guerrillas against Soviet-built MIG warpianes
and heavier, more sophisticated arms to
hold occupied towns and settlements.
While Sangumba and Roberto expect
heavy casualties in the anticipated offensive
they are confident of ultimate victory.
Time, they say, is on their side.
The third and smallest Angolan move
ment, the Front for the Liberation of
Cabinda Enclave FLEC, is beset by leader
ship squabbles, launches few effective
military operations while claiming to have
6000 men and is dismissed lightly by West
ern observers here.
The 240-square-mile Cabinda enclave
FLEC seeks to liberate is, however, vital to
Angola and its anti-guerrilla war. Gulf Oil
Co. of the United States pays the Luanda
government $600 million annually to drill oil
off Cabinda and this foreign currency helps
the military budget.
FLEC commander Lt. Col. Marcelino
Luemba, 35, says his guerrillas have not at
tacked the oilfields, which are heavily
guarded by government and Cuban troops.
Said Luemba: "We don't attack Gulf be
cause we do not want to anger America."
Since Portugal granted independence to
Angola, the United States has had a limited
role and minimal influence in the West Afri
can territory.
But the recent visit to Luanda by U.S. de
puty United Nations Ambassador Donald
McHenry suggests the Carter administra
tion is trying to nudge Neto's government
away from its almost total dependence on
the Soviet Union and Cuba.
