# Washington hosts marches

Washington (AP) — "Every
thing starts someplace else but it
finishes right here," said Police
Capt. Joseph Mazur, a mild un
dertone of complaint in his
voice.
"Take the Bakke decision. It
began in California, but where
do the protesters come? New
York City went broke, where did
their policemen and firemen
demonstrate? The Shah of Iran
visits. Who gets the pickets and
the bricks? We do."
Get Mazur rolling on the sub
ject of protest marches and he'll
rattle off a decade's worth. Viet
nam. Postal workers. Yippies.
Human rights in this country and
abroad. Pro-abortion. Anti
abortion.
"This is the capital and this is
where people come to," Mazur
says.
"Expect any trouble with the
latest group?"
"You mean the Indians?
Nah!"

"No, the traveling salesmen."
"Traveling salesmen?" Mazur
replied. "You kidding?"
There was indeed such a de
monstration planned for today
as Salesmen's Awareness Day —
a serious matter for traveling
salesmen wanting to impress
congressmen that some pend
ing legislation will hurt their in
come and retail sales generally.
At the time of the conversa
tion, the police department's
Special Operations Division was
preparing for a group of Indians
who had marched across the
country to plead their case for
regaining lost lands, water and
fishing rights.
As Mazur says, Washington is
the place people go to when
they've got a beef. Last year the
police department issued 252
parade permits.
The British probably started
the custom by marching on
Washington in 1814, leaving a
bigger mess than any later de
monstration. They burned the
Capitol, the president's house
and most other public buiidings.
The 20th Century's first nota
ble protest gatherings, in the lat
ter part of Herbert Hoover's ad
ministration, were the hunger
marches that seared the capital
with the country's acute
economic distress.
The first ones, in December
1931, were relatively peaceful.
Then in June 1932, a "bonus
army" of unemployed veterans
came to petition Congress for
immediate payment of a war
bonus, and they stayed.
Later the same day, Hoover
ordered federal troops to drive
out the demonstrators. The sol
diers burned the huts and tents
and the unarmed bonus mar
chers were routed. Two soldiers
in command positions that ig
noble day: Douglas Mac Arthur
and Dwight Eisenhower.
In 1963, a quarter million
people stretched from the
Washington Monument to the
Lincoln Memorial to hear Martin

Luther King Jr.'s Dream, a dream
of a day when black and white
would live together.
A commemorative book of
that day includes this paragraph:
"One remembers most the
faces and the feet. There were
feet of every imaginable descrip
tion, some of them bare, some
of them stylishly shod; the feet
of old women who had stood
long over white folks' stoves and
the feet of old men who had
stood long in mines and fac
tories; feet used to the outdoors
. . . feet that ached easily and
were favored gently as the
people walked . . . the feet of
the young, feet fresh from col
lege campuses and offices, feet
modishly shod."
There was no counting the
marches of the '60s, the years of
Vietnam and war protest and de
fiance of the draft. Capt. Mazur
says some of the crowds in those
days were bigger than in thel963
march. They were certainly
more raucous and hostile.
Then came the Richard Nixon
regime and the 1969 March on
the Pentagon by the people
Norman Mailer called "The Ar
mies of the Night"; Mayday,
when the White House encour
aged thousands of arrests; the
Saturday Night Massacre, when
crowds exhorted motorists to
"honk for impeachment."
There have been poor
people's encampments,
mother's marches, "Honor
America Day" rallies, "Right-to-
Life" vigils. There have been
demonstrations against the
Soviet Union, against the lead
ers of Iran and Israel and Egypt;
there have been mass marches
for symbols such as Hungary's
Crown of St. Stephen.
The crowd today won't be
anywhere near that — probably
under a 1000. But it may start a
new line of jokes that begin
"Hear the one about the travel
ing salesman and the con
gressman's daughter "
