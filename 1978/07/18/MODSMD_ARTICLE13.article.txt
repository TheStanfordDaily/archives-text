# Reagan: keep Taiwanese ties

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The average American is not
willing to normalize relations with Communist
China at the expense of the established relation
ship with Taiwan, former California governor
Ronald Reagan said yesterday.
And the "normalization now" view articulated
by U.S. scholars and commentators "may just be a
case of native American restlessness," Reagan
said.
"Normalization advocates suggest that if we
don't hurry, our present level of friendship with
the Communist mainland will deteriorate and
Peking will rush into the arms of Moscow,"
Reagan said.
But, he said, if that were to happen, it would be
because Peking had decided it was in its own
self-interest to do so.
"Any government that acted with such calculat
ing pragmatism," Reagan said, "might be just as
likely to throw over an alliance with the United
States at some future date if it felt it was in its best
interests to do so."
Reagan made his remarks at a Chinatown lunch
eon meeting of the Chinese Consolidated Be
nevolent Association and the Committee to Con
serve Chinese Culture.
The former governor, who recently returned
from a visit to Taiwan, told the gathering that

those who argue for normalized relations have
not figured out how to do it without conceding to
Peking's demands.
Those demands, that Peking has said are the
grounds upon which they will accept normalized
relations with the U.S., include breaking dip
lomatic relations with Taiwan, breaking the
mutual defense treaty of 1954 and withdrawing
the remaining U.S. military advisors.
But, Reagan repeated, the great majority of the
American people and most opinion leaders do
not want that to happen.
"It's hard for me to believe that any sensible
American who believes in individual liberty and
self-determination would stand by and let his
government abandon an ally whose only sins are
that it is small and loves freedom," Reagan said.
However, Reagan said, he did not expect the
U.S. government to press the normalization issue
before next year.
"The realities of American politics are such that
the Administration would not be persuaded to
move much closer toward so-called normaliza
tion before this year's elections," he said.
With a note of humor, he added, "After all,
elected representatives do not like to have to
answer for unpopular policies."
