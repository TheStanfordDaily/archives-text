# Best lineman offer ever
## King signs with Giants 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Stanford All-American offen
sive tackle Gordon King signed a
three-year contract with the
New York Giants today which
was characterized by the New
York Daily News as being "the
largest contract in the history of
the National Football League for
an offensive lineman."
Although the 6-foot-5 256 lb.
rookie and his lawyer Lee Stein
berg refused to divulge the
terms of the contract, Steinberg
described King as "really
pleased."
King, in his first week of train
ing camp at Pleasantville, NY is
planning to donate a portion of
his contracted salary to several
causes of which he's personally
interested. Steinberg said his
athletes usually share in his own
concern that an obligation exists
to the community in which the
athlete received his training and
support.
In response to that concern,
King is donating a certain
amount of money to his high
school in Sacramento where
he's hoping to establish a scho
larship fund. Ideally, the money
would go specifically for wo
men's athletics since King feels a

great disparity exists between
the treatment of men and
women athletes. Under Title IX,
however, that specification may
not be allowed.
A certain amount of money
will also be donated to the Stan
ford Athletic Department and be
earmarked for either weight
room improvements or the Buck
Club — the organization which
provides the money for athletic
scholarships.
King's local contributions will
be to his newly adopted New
York community where several
causes will benefit from his con
cern. Raising money for public
television, preserving African
wildlife, coping with muscular
dystrophy and dealing with the
problems that senior citizens
face in our society also interest
the ball player. King will not only
be taking on the causes of vari
ous organizations in New York,
though. He'll also be taking on a
new position — left guard.
The Giants need the big man
in places other than offensive
tackle and King is being chal
lenged by the move.
Negotiations between Stein
berg, King and the Giants were
also challenging and did not go

smoothly as King opted to
hold out to reach a decision
on incorporation. Incorporation
would allow King to be paid as a
personal service corporation,
bringing alternate interest rates
and a more lucrative contract in
the long run. The final terms of
the agreement, though not in
cluding incorporation, were cal
led "generous and fair" by
Steinberg.
As a matter of fact, the two
"couldn't be happier."
"The Big Apple is about to get
its newest star," said Steinberg.
"The Giants sell-out every game
here. They've been following
the negotiations and they're ex
cited."
But how does Steinberg, a Cal
graduate and former student
body president, rationalize his
undeniable interest in the
promotion of Stanford athletes?
"The attempt to take my
alumni association card away
has failed, but this Big Game I
may have to sit half on each
side," said Steinberg. "Stanford
athletes are among the
brightest, most interesting, and
talented people with which I've
worked."
And according to the Giants,
King is no exception.

Gordon King helped lead Stanford to a winning season and a Sun Bowl
victory last year as offensive tackle. Next year the New York Giants
will use King at left guard and hope to compile as impressive a record.
