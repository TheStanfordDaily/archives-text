## movies/karen caesar 'Grease' has problems but still a lot of fun 
### 
I get angry, I mean really an
gry, when people say "Grease"
is a dumb movie. It was a dumb
play, so of course it is going to be
a dumb movie. If you are expect
ing a documentary or some seri
ous treatment of life in the '50s,
you will be disappointed, and
you will have no one to blame
but yourself. "Grease" doesn't
pretend to be incisive social
commentary on an era no one
can justify or understand or re
member; it is what it is — an
often funny, always entertaining
parody of high school in the '50s.
No one had parents, no one
went to class, no one learned
anything; the biggest fear was
running out of Vaseline and all
anybody wanted to do anyway
was make out in the back seat of
a Chevy. This is the substance
(or non-substance) of "Grease,"
and if you expect it and take it for
what it is, you should find the
movie enjoyable and at least
mildly amusing. If you thought
"Grease" was "stupid," then all I
can say is that you were stupid
for thinking it was not going to
be stupid. Got it?
High school stud
The story concerns handsome
high school stud Danny Zuko
(John Travolta) and his buddies,
all of whom comprise a leather
jacketed group called the
T-Birds. These T-Birds have a
female equivalent called the
Pink Ladies, comprised of tough
and no-so-tough cookies who
wear bobby socks and tight
skirts and cashmere sweaters.
Back to start their senior year
(for perhaps the third or fourth
time), the kids anticipate
another typical term smoking in
the bathroom and hiding rubber
bugs in each others'

sandwiches. The real conflict of
the film appears when Sandy
(Olivia Newton-John), a transfer
student from Sydney, Australia,
comes to Rydell High after hav
ing spent a wonderful summer
on the beach with . . . who else
but Danny Zuko. The burning
question is whether or not
Danny will dump his "Mr. Cool"
image to take on sickeningly
sweet Sandy, who wants desp
erately not to be so sickeningly
sweet. There's fun and games
along the way, including a terri
fically choreographed high
school sock hop, a car race
straight out of "American Graf
fiti", a false alarm pregnancy
and a high school carnival.
Even the credits in "Grease"

are hilarious; right from the
start, it is obvious the movie is
out to make fun of itself and the
'50s. "Summer Nights" and
"Greased Lightning" are two of
the funniest and most innovative
musical numbers I've ever seen
anywhere. They set the mood,
and if you happen to be in a bad
one, maybe you should leave
and come back when you're
feeling better.
There were some problems in
"Grease," primary among them
the fact that all the 17 and 18year
olds floating around look like
they should be portraying the
parents who weren't in the
movie. Stockard Channing in
particular, although her charac
terization of tough cookie (and

almost pregnant) Betty Rizzo is
one of the better thought-out
elements of the movie, is 33 and
looks 33.
Newton-John, on the other
hand, will be 30 in September
and doesn't look a day over 16.
John Travolta is the closest in age
to the "Grease" characters, and
he's 24.
No question
Whether you hate him or not,
there is no question that Travolta
makes this movie. He is poised
and he is a damn good dancer
and an adequate singer and he
can even act. His Danny Zuko is
not a slimy moronic punk but a
likeable, vulnerable kid who
can't decide if his buddies mean
more to him than Sandy. In the

end, he decides, and while I
can't say he made the right deci
sion (he chooses Sandy) I can at
least appreciate the identity
crisis he endured to make it.
Arrested
Travolta has a winning smile
and loads of boyish charm that
conflict directly with the way he
moves that long, lean body
(sometimes I think he ought to
be arrested). He gives Danny
some dignity, which is hard to
do with dialogue like "it's better
than hanging around with you
dorks," etc. The role doesn't re
ally tax Travolta, and I eagerly
await the day when he will play
someone other than an ethnic
thug from the wrong side of the
tracks (Vinnie Barbarino, Tony
Manero, Danny Zuko ... do
you detect a pattern emerging
here?).
There's almost nothing you
can say about Olivia Newton-
John, except that it's obvious (a
little foo obvious) that she's re
ally trying. She sings well, but
every time she sings it's as if the
movie stops to announce the
fact. Her acting is . . . well, this
will probably be her last film.
She's not really that awful, but
she's better off and probably a
lot more at home on vinyl and in
Las Vegas.
"Crease" is an enjoyable
movie — don't be ashamed to
say you liked it. It's not indica
tive of a weak mind or a low IQ.
Just be prepared for it. If you
want to see a movie that you can
sit and talk about over coffee af
terwards, go see "The Swarm"
or "Jaws II." But if you want to
smile and see a picture laugh at
itself and the '50s, see "Grease."
