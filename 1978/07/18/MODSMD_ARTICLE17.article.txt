U.S. will resume arms talks
Washington — The Carter administration, de
spite its indignation over Soviet treatment of dis
sidents, will resume negotiations with Moscow
today on ways to limit the export of conventional
weapons.
Declaring that international arms traffic poses
"serious risks to regional stability and thus to
world peace," State Department press officer
Thomas Reston said that issue is too important to
be linked to Soviet performance in the human
rights area.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance used similar lan
guage last week in justifying a resumption of
strategic arms limitation talks with the Moscow
during the trials of Soviet dissident leaders
Anatoly Shcharansky and Alexandr Ginzburg.
The announcement of the talks on conven
tional arms negotiations came just three days
after Shcharansky was convicted and sentenced
to 13 years imprisonment and hard labor. An
eight-year sentence was handed to Ginzburg last
week.
Some members of Congress vigorously op
posed Vance's decision to continue the SALT talks
in light of the trials of the dissidents.
U.S. to ask for Egyptian pledges
London — The United States will urge Egypt to
spell out security guarantees for Israel in new
Mideast peace talks opening today behind the
walls of a medieval fortress in south England, U.S.
officials said.
The participants — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and Foreign Ministers Moshe Dayan of Is
rael and Mohammed Ibrahim Kamel of Egypt —
arrived separately yesterday behind a shield of
tough security and flew by helicopter to isolated
Leeds Castle.
U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said
Vance hopes that specific assurances from Egypt
— particularly on how to cope with extremists on
the West Bank of the Jordan River — could lead to
matching Israeli concessions.
The purpose is to draw Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin into an acknowledgement that
Israel will withdraw from the West Bank, won
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War.
Hongisto may head N.Y. prisons
Albany, N.Y. — Richard Hongisto, a liberal and
controversial cop whose firing as Cleveland
police chief triggered a recall drive against the
mayor, was named yesterday to head the state's
20,000-inmate prison system.
The appointment must be approved by the
state Senate, where it is likely to meet resistance.
But Gov. Hugh Carey moved immediately to
neutralize potential opposition from the guard's
union by appointing a former guard to a high
corrections post.
And Carey maneuvered to put Hongisto on the
state payroll this week to discourage the Senate
from stalling confirmation of the nominee.
Hongisto, 40, served 10 years with the San Fran
cisco Police Department and two years as a
newsman for KQED, the public television station,
before being elected sheriff of San Francisco
County in 1972.
Charges against Jarvis dropped
Oxnard, Calif. — A mistrial was declared and
charges dropped yesterday in the drunken driv
ing trial of tax reformer Howard Jarvis after a jury
reported it was deadlocked 11-1 with the majority
favoring acquittal.

The jurors, who had begun deliberating last
Friday, had spent more than seven hours trying to
resolve the impasse and reach a verdict.
The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney
Robert Bayer, said immediately after the mistrial
that he would not attempt to retry the charge
against Jarvis.
He said the jury's vote with so many favoring
acquittal indicated a conviction could not be won
in another trial.
Moments later, the judge dismissed the mis
demeanor drunken driving charge against Jarvis
and fined him $40 for driving with an expired
license. He had earlier pleaded guilty to the latter
charge.
The seven men and five women returned three
times to the jury room after first reporting they
could not reach a decision. Each time, one juror
voiced the opinion that a verdict might still be
possible.
Finally, jury foreman Donald Rundle reported
there was no hope.
Brown, Younger debates stalled
Sacramento — Pre-election debates between
Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Evelle
Younger are being held up by disagreement on
format and coverage, both sides reported yester
day.
While Younger's side reported that another
negotiating session is scheduled for next Mon
day, Brown's campaign manager, Gray Davis, said
in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, "It's
unlikely we're going to have any meaningful de
bates. I think the Younger campaign is ducking
us."
A spokeswoman for Younger, the Republican
candidate for governor, said he wants four de
bates on specific subjects, and coverage only by
public broadcasting, which would mean "an
issue-oriented debate rather than a perfor
mance."
Davis said the Democratic governor, who is
seeking re-election, wants four debates without
restrictions on topics, and wants statewide com
mercial radio and television coverage. After that,
Brown would consider debates on specific sub
jects.
As for coverage, "To the extent you limit the
discussion or the number of people who can see
it, you frustrate the goal" of the debates, Davis
said.

ings that people stay indoors or in the shade.
