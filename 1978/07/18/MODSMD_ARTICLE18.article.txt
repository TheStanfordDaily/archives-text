# Magna Carta to be displayed
## 
### 
The Magna Carta will be
spending the weekend here.
One of the original copies of
the charter of English liberties
signed by King John in 1215 will
be on public display at the
Hoover Institution from Thurs
day through Sunday.
The exhibition, sponsored by
Hoover to conincide with the
dedication of the Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building
Thursday, was made possible by
a loan of the document from
Lincoln Cathedral, in England,
whose dean, Rev. Oliver Fien
nes, is visiting Stanford.
The display copy is one of four
originals remaining from an es

timated 20 documents sealed by
the king at Runnymede. Two
other copies are in the Britsh
Museum in London and the
fourth is in the archives of the
Salisbury Cathedral.
Known as the Lincoln Magna
Carta, the display document was
exhibited at the 1939 World's
Fair in New York and was stored
at Fort Knox along with the U.S.
Constitution and Declaration of
Independence during World
War 11. The Chartered Bank of
London exhibited it in San Fran
cisco during 1976.
A replica of the Magna Carta
together with an English transla
tion, will be given to the first
5000 visitors, according to
Hoover Public Affairs Coor
dinator George Marotta.
"The Hoover Institution is
honored to be able to present
the Magna Carta to help celeb
rate the dedication of the na
tion's memorial to President
Herbert Hoover," said Hoover
Director Glenn Campbell.
"This treasured British docu
ment, which signaled the begin
nings of our country's more
cherished liberties, will remind
us that the problem of control
ling central authgority is peren
nial, and that protecting indi
vidual freedoms requires our
constant attention."
Former President Gerald Ford
will be the principal speaker at
the dedication ceremonies at
noon Thursday in front of
Hoover Tower. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building is the
sole federal monument to the
late president and Stanford
alumnus.
The Magna Carta exhibit will
be open to the public from 3 to 8
p.m. Thursday, from 10a.m. tos
p.m. Friday and Saturday, and
from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday.
