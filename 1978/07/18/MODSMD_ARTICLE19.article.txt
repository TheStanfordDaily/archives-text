Gunther appointment
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther has
been appointed to the Federal
Judicial Center Advisory Com
mittee on Experimentation in
the law.
Headed by Edward Re, chief
judge of the U.S. Customs
Court, the 12-member commit
tee will study the use of control
led experimentation to evaluate
innovations in the justice sys
tem.
One potential application is
the evaluation of local rules pro
viding for mandatory, nonbind
ing arbitration of civil cases.
This can be done by randomly
assigning eligible cases to arbit
ration and to conventional litiga
tion procedures, and then ap
praising the results.
Another committee member
is former Law Prof, loseph
Sneed, now judge in the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals.
