# Alums view ROTC return
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Beginning in September, an
alumni committee will consider
whether to recommend a resol
ution supporting the reinstate-,
ment of the ROTC program here
to the 1979 annual alumni meet
ing.
The resolution, submitted at
this year's annual meeting on
May 20 by Michael Antonacci,
Class of 1924, declares in part
that "ROTC courses are even
more vital than those courses
which offer preparation for earn
ing a living since they prepare
for the defense of our way of
life," and petitions the Board of
Trustees, administration and fa
culty to grant ROTC full recogni
tion and academic credit.
On May 7,1970, the Academic
Council voted to end all
academic credit for ROTC. The
council's decision was based on

the conclusion of a student
faculty committee in February
1969 that ROTC "is not compati
ble" with the University and that
"this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC
programs."
'Appropriateness'
The five .person committee,
chaired by Alumni Executive
Board member Philip Sarkesian,
has been appointed to study the
resolution — including the "ap
propriateness" of the resolution
itself — and make a recommen
dation to the Executive Board,
according to Sarkesian. The
board will then decide whether
to place the resolution in front of
next year's assembly.
Resolution proponent An
tonacci is president of the New
Founders League, a private con
servative alumni group formed
in 1970 which has lobbied ac

tivelyfor 10 official goals, includ
ing the reinstatement of ROTC.
Antonacci, a San Jose resi
dent, was unavailable for Com
ment last night.
'Demonstrated interest'
President Richard Lyman told
the Daily last year, "I have no
reason to forsee the return of
ROTC. Of all the efforts in the
last few years, there hasn't been
a demonstrated interest among
students. In order for there to be
any likelihood of ROTC return
ing, there has to be substantial
interest."
Eight years ago, students de
monstrated a substantial interest
by demanding that ROTC be
thrown off campus. By the time
ROTC was finally denied
academic credit, $15,000 worth
of windows had been broken,
two separate sit-ins at Old Union

Tpnter in Aoril 1977 One of the issues in the anti-military rally was keeping ROTC, which has bee
campus since 1970, froUT coming back. Now a committee oftheAlumn, Assoc,at,on plans to cons,der
whether the association should recommend the return of KOIC..
had taken place and there had
been two consecutive nights of
street fighting between police
and students which culminated
in a student strike that virtually
shut down the entire campus for
several days.
Continued interest
Student interest in keeping
ROTC off campus continues to
day. Some 200 people rallied in

White Plaza in April 1977 in sup
port of the Stanford Coalition
Against Racism, which advo
cated among other things a halt
to military recruitment on
campus and the denial of cam
pus facilities for ROTC.
Some 287 colleges and univer
sities now have full time ROTC
programs. Another 500 to 700
have cross enrollment with
other ROTC programs.
