## Soviet justice 
### 
"I've seen the future, and it works."
That's how journalist/muckraker Lincoln Steffens
characterized the Soviet Union of the 19205. Within
five years, Josef Stalin had shown the world his con
ception of futuristic justice in his famous "show trials"
of anti-Stalin party officials.
Last week, the Soviets showed they haven't dropped
their peculiar notions about judicial progress: in sham
trials designed more to impress the West with the
security of the Soviet state than to enforce justice,
Anatoly Shcharansky and Alexandr Ginzburg were
sentenced to long prison terms for daring to exercise
old-fashioned free speech.
Fortunately for the cause of socialism in the United
States, the American Left long ago abandoned any
notion of the Soviet Union as "the great experiment"
in social progress it was believed to be earlier in the
century.
We believe the United States should be extremely
cautious in responding to the repression. Any reaction
should be limited to discreet approaches to the Soviets
offering to exchange Soviet citizens the U.S. govern
ment has arrested on espionage charges.
It is clear from the timing of the arrests in the United
States, together with the usual diplomatic practice of
sending home apprehended spies, that American offi
cials have had in mind for some time the idea that
"dissident for spy" exchanges are possible.
As attractive as such deals are, Americans should not
hope for them in this week's cases in the near future
because of Soviet touchiness following what they must
realize is a set of major public relations disasters. But
holding the Soviet spies keeps the option open.
That's as far as the United States should go, how
ever. In particular, nothing in the Soviets' domestic
activities should be allowed to interfere with either the
cultural and economic exchanges agreed on since 1972
or the two sets of strategic talks aimed at slowing the
pace of the arms race.
There are several reasons for this. The most obvious
of these underlies U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young's
ill-timed remarks on political prisoners last week: any
serious attempt to manage domestic policy in the
Soviet Union opens American domestic policy to the
kind of international scrutiny Americans are quick to
reject.
Put more simply, if we want to run our own affairs,
we are going to have to be extremely restrained in
attempting by coercion to regulate those of other na
tions, no matter how distasteful.
Another reason is the balance between the probabil
ity of changing Soviet policy and the chance of destroy
ing negotiations affecting the security of the entire
world. Given that even those who favor sanctions
against the Soviets admit that their system is extremely
resistant to change, the delicacy of the SALT talks and
conventional arms negotiations — not to mention the
European force reduction talks — must be considered
vital.
The plain fact is that there is little or nothing the
United States can do to make a system which is inhe
rently totalitarian and repressive into one in which
values personal liberty, and the relations between the
two superpowers are both delicate and so important
that they overshadow any other consideration.
But we can still be damned mad.
