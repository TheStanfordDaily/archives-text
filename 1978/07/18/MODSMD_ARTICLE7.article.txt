# Western Culture costs

In January 1977, the Faculty
Senate approved the concept of
a universal Western Culture
course requirement. Last spring
Stanford took a second step to
ward imposing such a require
ment when the Faculty Senate
approved a trial program in
Western Culture to be con
ducted over the next few years.
As we move closer and closer
to a full-scale Western Culture
requirement, we must continue
to question its costs to the rest of
the University.
One of the lessons taught to
me repeatedly during my term as
a participant in ASSU and Uni
versity governance was that the
allocation of limited resources is
a most difficult and complex
process. When considering a
new program or activity, the es
sential question is not whether
the proposal is valuable, but
whether it is more valuable than
the other potential recipients of
the University's resources.
Neglect
In its deliberations so far, the
Faculty Senate has neglected any
detailed and comprehensive
analysis of this kind. Rather, its
financial considerations have
focused on determining what
the costs of the various propos
als were, and identifying where
the resources would come from
in general terms only.
Basically, there are three
sources of funds for a Western
Culture requirement: new
money to the University, reallo
cated non-academic funds or
reallocated academic funds.
Since the provost has restricted
the potential use of new money
for the requirement, and since
the possibility of reallocating
non-academic funds has not
been discussed, we are left to
the general conclusion that the
Western Culture requirement
will be funded by a reallocation
of academic funds.
For now, however, let's con
sider the possible effects of
using each of these three
sources of funding for the re
quirement.
While many question whether
it would be possible to solicit
enough new money to endow a
Western Culture program, it is
worth considering. A problem
arises, though, when trying to
determine which other potential
uses of the new money is less
important than the Western Cul
ture requirement.
Forexample, might the money
better be spent on constructing
a new research animal care facil
ity (which is currently of low

funding priority) or relieving
some of the University's depen
dence on corporations doing
business in South Africa?
How to compare?
While the second source of
funding for the requirement,
reallocating non-academic
funds, has not been discussed, it
is another valid possibility. The
problem here, however, is try
ing to decide how to compare
the value of non-academic prog
rams with an academic one.
Which is more valuable or
necessary: Western Culture or
renovation of the steam heating
system, Western Culture or con
struction of new undergraduate
and graduate housing, Western
Culture or psychological sup
port services for students? The
possibilities are endless, and the
choices are all difficult.
The final potential source of
funding, and that which the Fa
culty Senate seems inclined to
support, is a reallocation of
academic funds. Unfortunately,
no one has yet identified exactly
what would be lost by such a
reallocation, and contrasted
those losses to the benefits of
the Western Culture require
ment.
Costs
Assuming that current faculty
will be the principal instructors

of the Western Culture
course(s), it is likely that the
academic costs of the require
ment will include a decrease in
the number of course offerings,
a decrease in the variety of
courses offered, and a decrease
in the amount of faculty time de
voted to advising and research
sponsorship.
Throughout discussion of the
Western Culture requirement
there has, in my mind, been in
sufficient justification for the re
quirement to warrant any of the
cuts or reallocations which have
been outlined above. The bur
den is on the proponents of the
Western Culture program to
prove the need for their prop
osal, and to demonstrate that a
requirement will fulfill that
need.
The priorities of the University
are established, and can be iden
tified through its resource allo
cations. We must continue to
question whether the Western
Culture requirement is more
important than the programs
that will be sacrificed to fund it.
During the Watergate crisis,
Deep Throat suggested to "fol
low the money." Students
should now do the same to have
a role in determining the nature
and focus of their education.
