# Letter: quotas for minorities
## 
### 
In the June 30 article on local
reaction to the Bakke decision, I
was misquoted on the subject of
affirmative action and hiring
quotas.
At the time of the initial im
plementation of affirmative ac
tion, the guidelines set down
stated that if you received
money from the federal gov
ernment, then your institution
— whether school or shop —
had to have minorities rep
resented in the work force in
proportion to their percentage
in the national population.
Because of the past system of
old-boy school ties in many in
dustires, minorities were
completely absent from the pic
•ure. With affirmative action, we
were at least guaranteed a cer
tain number of slots reflecting
our numbers in the population.
The reason the change seems
so dramatic is that for many
years, no blacks at all were hired

at many companies. Even at
Stanford, we are a recent inno
vation and we will be watching
the University to see what policy
changes they are going to make
in order to increase the actual
numbers of black faculty, staff
and students.
Without the pressure of losing
contract money from the federal
government, many employers
would not have integrated their
work forces and it would still be
all white males. Without the
guarantee of law, we would be
left at the mercy of the employer
and subject to irreparable, puni
tive harm.
What the Supreme Court de
cides on the issue of affirmative
action will be very important for
generations to come. We will be
watching.
