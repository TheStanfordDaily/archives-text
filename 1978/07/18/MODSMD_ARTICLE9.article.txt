# Professor charges FBI with spying
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Paul Lin has
been glancing over his shoulder
to see if he's being followed, and
recently, says the college pro
fessor, he's rarely been disap
pointed.
Like the time when four men
not- too- inconspicuously
jumped into four unmarked cars
and followed him down the
street.
Lin, a Canadian-born visiting
professor, lecturer and consul
tant at UCLA, spent 15 years in
Communist China. He said
about a month ago it occurred to
him that someone was following
him all over town, but "they
seemed too blatant, too
amateurish to be the FBI."
Chased followers
For example, Lin said he and
some of his friends armed them
selves with cameras and chased
three men through Los Angeles
International Airport trying to
find out who the unidentified
men were.
Last week, Lin went to the
Santa Monica Police Depart
ment to find out who his un
wanted companions were. As he
left his home, four cars started
out after him. A Los Angeles
Times reporter whom Lin had
called, Doyle McManus, fol
lowed the four cars tailing Lin.
When the six-car motorcade
entered the police parking lot,
McManus found the tables had
been turned on him.
"As I parked my car,"
explained the reporter, "three
of them (the men following Lin)
drove by at very close range, tak
ing my picture."
FBI owned cars
Inside the police station, Lin
found his first guess had been
correct: the men following him
had license plates given to law
enforcement vehicles. Further
checks by McManus determined
the cars belonged to the FBI, and
even more specifically, to the
counterespionage section.
McManus said he assumes the
FBI suspects Lin of being a spy
for Peking, which Lin visits sev
eral times a year. Lin denies he is
an agent, and accuses the FBI of
harassing him and tapping his
telephone.
Ted Gunderson, special agent
in charge of the FBI office here,
said, "I can neither confirm nor
deny that we are running an in
vestigation on Paul Lin."
Amateurish surveillance
"Lin says the surveillance is
amateurish," Gunderson con
tinued. "The Times countersur
veillance and subsequent article

is amateurish. I don't think the
L.A. Times reporters have
enough work to do." •
McManus laughingly re
sponded to Gunderson's re
marks, "I admit that my counter
surveillance was amateurish —
probably more amateurish than
anything the FBI has done. But
my story wasn't."
Lin and his wife Eileen are re
turning to Canada this week, to
the university from which the
professor was on a sabbatical
leave. His job at UCLA — to
explore the possibility of setting
up an exchange program with
Chinese universities — is over.
Building bridges
The program was a task he had
referred to as "building bridges"
between China and America,
but after being under surveil
lance, he said, "I feel like drop
ping the whole damn thing.
"It sure puts a damper on my
enthusiasm for building
bridges."
