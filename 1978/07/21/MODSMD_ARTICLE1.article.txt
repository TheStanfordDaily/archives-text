## 
### Jim Tranquada 
One former president paid
tribute to another yesterday as
Gerald Ford formally dedicated
the Herbert Hoover Federal
Memorial Building in a cere
mony on the steps of Hoover
Tower.
Ford called the building "a
living growing memorial to a
great American and a most un
common man. The federal
contribution to it represents
the thanks of a very grateful na
tion."
Ford, as president three
years ago, signed the legisla
tion which designated the
memorial and approved fed
eral funding for the new build
ing, which is the nation's sole
memorial to Hoover.
The five story building,
which will house offices and
the archives and special collec
tions of the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace,
and the Hoover Institution
Press, is the latest addition to
the Institution, founded in
1919 by Hoover.
Ford praised Hoover for his
"total devotion to his country,
his lifetime dedication to its
service, and his tremendous
and unique contributions after
World War I."
Ford and Allan Hoover,
former President Hoover's
son, assisted each other in cut
ting the red, white and blue
ribbon, which formally opened
the building at the end of the
ceremony.
Oregon senator and Stan
ford alumnus Mark Hatfield,
who introduced the Hoover
Memorial bill in Congress, also
spoke in appreciation of
Hoover's life and accomplish
ments.
"Today when too many of

our politicians and political
policies are about as authentic
as instant mashed potatoes, I
think it is appropriate that we
reflect on the aualities of one
of our most multifaceted pres
idents of all time," Hatfield
said.
Hatfield also paid a personal
tribute to Hoover, saying, "His
words, his life, his philosophy,
have been my inspiration.
Would I could emulate them."
"(Hoover) was in a very real
sense a second founder," said
Stanford President Richard
Lyman. "And I'd like to suggest
that he did much more than
any one other person to assure
that Stanford would be an in
stitution in and of the world,
and not removed from it."
Hoover Institution Director
W. Glenn Campbell pledged
the Institution to the continu
ing pursuit of its ultimate aim,
the pursuit of world peace.
"Today the resources
Hoover dreamed of putting to
gether are now largely
realized," Campbell, who
went on to warn "but the pur
pose of all this, the reason why
Hoover founded the Institu
tion, is still far from realiza
tion."
Campbell charged the In
stitution with the necessity of
being conservative — "in our
fundamental respect for the
truth" — liberal — "in our
compassion for our fellow
man" — and radical — "in our
uncompromising search for
truth."
Among the crowd of over
1000 in attendance were
former California governor
Ronald Reagan, former Secret
ary of the Treasury William
Simon and Shirley Temple
Black.
