# Brown proposes rent relief

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown met with
leaders of landlord groups yesterday and an
nounced a three-point plan for rent rollbacks en
dorsed with reservations by tax crusader Howard
Jarvis.
Jarvis, co-author of property tax slashing Prop
osition 13, and Brown appeared at a news confer
ence with the heads of major apartment owners
associations to announce the plan containing
these points:
— Rents are to be rolled back to May 31 levels.
— Rents will be frozen at least through the end
of the year.
— Landlords will share Proposition 13 tax sav
ings with tenants by offering either a rebate of
one half of December's rent, a rebate in De
cember of 80 percent of the savings, or a pro
longed rent freeze.
Brown said he would set up telephone "hot
lines" for renter complaints. He warned that if
landlords do not comply with this plan, legislation
will be sought for rent controls.
Jarvis, who heads the California Apartment
Owners' Association, said he goes along with the
proposal but had some doubts about the third

point involving rent rebates. He said landlords
may be faced with new local taxes which would
cancel some of their Proposition 13 tax savings.
"I am trying to bring the benefits of Proposition
13 to tenants with a minimum of bureaucracy and
new government agencies," Brown said.
"We don't want to see the double bind where
rent control will discourage new building of
apartments.
"What I'm saying to the people of California is
that the landlords had better shape up or some
body will be shipping them out. And I mean the
legislature and city councils."
A spokesman for one landlord's group, Howard
Ruby, chairman of the California Housing Coun
cil, said the landlords would appoint their own
"police force" of apartment owners who will visit
uncooperative landlords seeking to win their par
ticipation in the voluntary rent control program.
