Moscow (AP) — Francis Crawford, the American
businessman who spent 15 days in a Soviet prison
last month, is back at work again, going about his
business almost as if nothing had happened.
But Crawford, 38, of Mobile, Ala., is not a free
man. He still faces charges of "systemetically"
violating Soviet currency laws and has been bar
red from leaving the country. His trial date has not
been set.
Crawford has denied the charges.
He was arrested on June 12 and held in Lefor
tovo prison until he was released under the rec
ognizance of the U.S. ambassador on June 27 —
the same day two Soviet United Nations
employees who were charged with spying were
released without bail in New Jersey, in a mutually
acceptable deal worked out by both govern
ments.
Although there is no formal requirement that
he do so, Crawford is said to check in frequently
with the U.S. embassy.
Rumors have surfaced that the two accused
Soviet spies could be exchanged for two Soviet

dissidents — Anatoly Shcharansky and Alexandr
Cinzburg — who were convicted last week of
espionage and anti-Soviet activity and sentenced
to long terms in prison and labor camps.
But Western diplomats here say they do not
know what the Soviets may have in mind for
Crawford. If he were tried and convicted, he
could face three to eight years in prison.
In New Jersey, the two Soviets have been told
their trial has been set for September. If there
were no exchange, it is likely Crawford would go
on trial then as well.
Crawford's employer, International Harvester
Co. of Chicago, told the Soviets last week after
some initial hesitation that it would conduct no
more business with the U.S.S.R. while criminal
action is still pending against Crawford.
According to well-informed sources, the com
pany also informed the Soviet foreign trade minis
try that no new business would be conducted
until the Crawford case is cleared up.
