## Singlaub blasts arms policy 
### Bill Burger 
Retired Maj. Gen. John
Singlaub sharply criticized U.S.
arms policy last Friday, telling
San Francisco's Commonwealth
Club that, "the time has come
for our national policymakers to
face up to the undeniable reality
that the Soviets are not in
terested in detente and coopera
tive relations with the United
States."
Singlaub was the center of a
national controversy last year
after he criticized President
Jimmy Carter's proposed policy
of withdrawal of U.S. ground
troops from South Korea.
Singlaub, then chief of staff of
U.S. forces in Korea, said Friday
he "did not intend to challenge
or embarrass the president or to
seek notoriety" in the confron
tation. He added he didn't be
lieve military personnel should

speak out against decisions of
the president or policies of the
nation, and that in his case he
did not know the president's de
cision had already been made
about Korean troop withdrawal.
However, Singlaub said the
confrontation "did not change
my point of view or raise new
concerns. It merely heightened
my sensitivities to the military
and political problems facing the
nation."
Singlaub called it a "basic fact
. . . partially hidden" from the
American public that the United
States has been "engaged in
gradual unilateral disarmament
for roughly 15 years.
"The result of our policy of
gradual unilateral disarmament
is that we are now in a position of

military inferiority," Singlaub
said.
"I think we should operate on
the principle that both Soviet
and Red Chinese weapons may
some day be used against us. I
have little faith that U.S. dip
lomatic efforts could ever be
successful in converting the
People's Republic of China into
a bonafide ally, regardless of the
nature of the Soviet challenge to
the PRC."
Reminding the audience that
the U.S.S.R. challenged the Un
ited States twice in the last 30
years "when we enjoyed a sig
nificant military advantage (1948
in Berlin and 1962 in Cuba)," he
said "we are engaging in self
deceit if we assume that the
Soviets will never challenge us
again or that they do not fully
appreciate the advantages their
current superiority grants to
them."
Singlaub called upon the Un
ited States to increase its naval
power, reconstruct its strategic
defenses, increase the number
of U.S. troops and pursue "ad
vances in weaponry, such as the
neutron bomb.
"The prime requirement is for
our national leadership to follow
the lead of the American people
whose common sense tells them
that the surest road to peace is
unchallengeable strength â€” and
that history proves that weak
ness is the road to war,"
Singlaub said.
