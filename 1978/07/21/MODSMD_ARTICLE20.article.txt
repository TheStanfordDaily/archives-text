## movies/alisome parker Parody or formula? 
### 
"Dear Inspector" is a murder
mystery. A comedy. A romance.
Most importantly, however, it is
French. Murder, sex and humor
are definite box-office attrac
tions of the American cinema,
but what distinguishes this film
from the grade B American for
mulas is the French charm in
fused by director Philippe De
Broca, the creative genius re
sponsible for the classic "The
King of Hearts."
Much of the appeal of this
movie derives from taking stan
dard formulas and applying
ironic non-stereotypical twists.
Every time we laugh at the
switched roles between man
and woman, we must realize that
our own pre-conceived notions
are the true source of humor. To
the believer in status-quo, to the
devotee of the familiar formula?
"Dear Inspector" presents some
clever substitutions.
In a true formula script, a
handsome detective with both
physical and emotional scars
from the past has a romance with
beautiful young heroine cum
unjustified suspect, cum in
tended victim. He solves the
murder after a high-speed chase
involving said heroine as framed
suspect and/or innocent hos
tage. In De Broca's scenario, the
only beautiful young victim/
suspect, who seems quite un
perturbed by the murders
around her, is of minor interest
except to those with lust in their
hearts.
The only hard-boiled detec
tive spends his time nursing the
flu, propositioning the women
and being a generally unsym
pathetic and unbelievable
character.
The true story begins with one

middle-aged divorcee needing a
new hairdo literally running into
one middle-aged professor of
Greek needing a constant sup
ply of food. The romance, as
well as the professor's eating, is
constantly interrupted by mur
dered political deputies. For
once the detective wears spiked
heels and curlers and the roman
tic interest has middle age
bulge. For once, it is the woman
who must interrupt meetings for
her career; he simply wants to
settle down and eat. She tries to
bully a woman behind a counter
into giving her change for an im
portant phone call; he succeeds
through congenial small talk.
Unfortunately, it is sometimes
hard to distinguish between
formula and parody. Which as
sumptions does the director
share with society and which are
he mocking? At times I wasn't
sure whether to laugh with glee
or shake with outrage. Does the
inspector's bevy of male detec
tives indicate her power in her
non-traditional role, or do they
merely illustrate the stereotype
that a woman needs male sup
port to chase the suspect while
she gets her hair done?
The music provided another
interpretive problem. The in
tensely dramatic tones at the
prelude of each murder were
annoying, yet perhaps they too
parodied the "straight" detec
tive story.
If the film was comprised of
incongrous (to our eyes), unex
pected roles, the acting and di
rection certainly were not. The
leads, played by Anne Girardot
and Philippe Noiret, were con
sistently good. The direction
never lagged. The cinematog
raphy, using the sights of Paris

and Honfleur as backdrop, was
an almost constant joy. But the
all-too-bloody close-ups were a
bit surprising, a rather sharp re
minder of this movie's ability to
skirt the edge of several film
genres.
It would be possible to isolate
"Dear Inspector" into separate
stories: a murder that was a real
mystery, a romance that was a
real comedy. In balance, the
humor outweighed the sus
pense, hence the jarring effects
of the music and close-ups. The
mystery was suspensful yet solv
able to all budding Hercule
Poirots, and the humorous
twists to the formula were less
predictable and much more in
teresting. Take, for instance, the
requisite chase where the car
sped along at 15 mph as the hos
tage driver kept stalling the un
familiar manual gears. What
possibilities for a remake of
"Bullit" on Lombard Street. . . .
