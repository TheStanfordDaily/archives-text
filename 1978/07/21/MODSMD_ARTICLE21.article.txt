# Company presents comedy tonight
## 
### 
Two entertaining one-act
plays are on the bill tonight and
tomorrow night at Branner Din
ing Hall. The Company proudly
presents "Noon' by Terrence
MacNally and "Adaptation" by
Elaine May, both one-act plays
that succeeded in New York and
are making their Palo Alto pre
mieres here.
"I think that they say some
very relevant things about con
temporary American life," says
director Andy Mendelson, who
received his Ph.D. in drama here
this year and has been teaching
at the University of Michigan. "I
think there is a real dearth of
good, short contemporary

American plays." Mendelson
has never directed or seen either
of these plays. "I try not to do
shows that I've seen and that I've
done before. I don't want to
copy anyone else, or myself."
And justwho isThe Company?
Its devotees often change from
year to year.
Joy Fossel, who has been as
sociated with it for four years,
explains: "The Company was
started by (Associate English
Professor) Larry Friedlander in
the '60s. It was basically de
signed for non-drama people
and has been that way through
its history." The Company exists
for the entire Stanford commun

ity, "to give people who are in
terested in theater who maybe
haven't had a chance to experi
ence it a chance to act, direct,
whatever, in a non-pressurized
atmosphere, and really show
what they can do."
The productions have been
beset with some serious prob
lems, such as rapidly dwindling
funds ("We always pass the hat,"
says Joy) and one temperamen
tal type who was cast in a major
role in each play and then
backed out barely a week ago.
But these haven't stopped The
Company. The shows will go on,
Friday and Saturday at 8:45 p.m.
in the Branner Dining Hall.
