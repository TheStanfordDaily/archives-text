## 'Heaven' resurrects intelligent comedy 
### 
Joe Pendleton died, but it was
a mistake. He was removed from
his body early in an effort to save
him some pain, but Pendleton's
bike had not been destined to
hit the truck, and it definitely
was a mistake. To make things
worse, the people who ran
heaven were slow to notice what
had happened, and Pendleton's
body was reduced to ashes be
fore he could reclaim it.
That is the premise of
"Heaven Can Wait," which is a
frequently very funny movie.
Warren Beatty plays Pendleton,
a quarterback for the Los

... it depends for its success upon
machinations of the plot that come totally
out of the blue. We're not supposed to
dissect it.

Angeles Rams lifted out of his
chance to play the Super Bowl —
he also plays a to-be murdered
millionaire and another L.A.
quarterback. He's still Joe Pend
leton, but in the bodies of other
people — it's all very si mple if we
keep in mind that we see things
as he does. We see Warren
Beatty, and none of the other
bodies he takes, but that's not
supposed to matter since it's not
that kind of movie.
Bite lacking
And it isn't, really. "Heaven
Can Wait" is like a Thurber story
without any of the bite; it de
pends for its success upon

machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue.
We're not supposed to dissect it.
We're supposed to know only
that something has to happen,
and that what happens had bet
ter be strange, and we also
should suspect that if the movie
is to work it must continually
outwit us.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little
Walter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistence and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.

(Strange as it sounds, Beatty is
good at this, and his efforts are
aided by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
Buck Henry is unbelievably
bureaucratic as Beatty's
heavenly escort, and James
Mason is properly understand
ing, and pedantic and straight
faced as his boss. Back on earth,
Dyan Cannon and Charles Gro
din are perfect little weasels. As
an unfaithful wife and scheming
personal assistant to and of Beat
ty's first new body, their slimi
ness helps the movie from be
coming too ethereal. In most

comedies today, every character
would be like them, and as a re
sult they would be rotten, but
here they are exceptions, and
they give us a little perspective.
It has been noted elsewhere
that this picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but it
isn't so much a "remake" as it is
an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that we thought had been
abandoned. It doesn't just stick

old lines into new faces and then
play off of its inferiority to the
original; "Heaven" seems more
hand-crafted than the sure-fire
approach of pictures following
the "Cheap Detective" formula.
Those are rip-offs, and not much
else — attempts to leach off
somebody else's ideas — but this
is a thoughtful reintroduction to
a far more intelligent kind of
comedy.
60 to 0
Remember, though, that the
old approach had drawbacks of

We're supposed to know only that some
thing has to happen and that what hap
pens had better be strange, and we also

it must continually outwit us.

its own. Movies with no known
ties to the real world work when
they keep our attention, but
they go from 60 to zero faster
than most any other kind. An
audience here is always con
scious of a huge pool of so what
waiting patiently behind them,
and when the picture slips we
know it won't take long at all to
drown. When a new twist of plot
is late, we are instantaneously
bored, and it fast becomes ex
tremely tough to salvage what
remains because we then begin
to approach things rationally
and ask rational-sounding ques

tions, and such a state of mind is
not the slightest bit appropriate.
The movie is nuts, pure and sim
ple, and it appeals to our sense
of nutzo. If we do not respond
from exactly that perspective the
thing goes thraight to pieces.
And how successful is
"Heaven Can Wait" at keeping
our attention? Well. Midway
through it loses its grip and we
sink to our necks immediately,
but then it picks up again and
finishes nearly as well as it be
gins. The most important things

in this picture, of course, are the
ones that cannot be mentioned
— sufficeth to say that it saves
itself and that it is well worth se
eing. Never again will Beatty be
confused with Clint Eastwood;
is happily harmless in such a
waythatwe marvel at his versatil
ity. And that, perhaps, is the sel
ling point of the picture as a
whole — it turned it's back on
almost all of Hollywood's "gim
mes" without coming off as
high-handed. It's not what you
expect, yet it rarely ends up
muddled. It is very wry, and very
good.

his impersonation of a wealthy industrialist.

Heaven only to find out they are not supposed to be there, in Paramount's G-rated "Heaven Can Wait,"
currently at the Palo Alto Square.
