Just what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy on
the pathos. Simone Signoret makes
the film worthwhile with her perfor
mance as an aging whore — she easily
overcomes the occasionally dumb
dialogue, and often provides humor
at unexpected moments. It is, unfor
tunately, one of them foreign things,
but it kinda makes me wish that I had
never dropped French 10. With "Dear
Detective."

At first glance, 1) stunningly enter
taining and wildly visual 2) wildly en
tertaining and stunningly visual 3) the
kind of movie nobody makes any
more. On second thought it's delib
erately anesthetic; little more than the
financial successor to "Jaws." Except
for Alec Guiness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls, or escapees from
episode of Lassie; though Lucas is to
be praised for avoiding the asinine
political commentary implicit in
things like "Rollerball" and "Logan's
Run'' his decision to center the action
around the aformentioned members
of the Pepsi Generation rankles and
irks and peeves. True "2001" fans in
sist that for all its visual achievements
"Star Wars" is really very bland —
even though I still don't know what
the hell was going on in Kubrick's
movie I am tempted to agree.

The dominant sensation upon leav
ing this film is that is must have been a
very good play — the screen version
suffers by comparison. Nevertheless,
there is proof positive here that
Richard Burton is what they say he is
— his perfotnance here gives power
to a production that otherwise is a bit
stilted. With "Sailor Who Feil With
Grace From the Sea."

Sunday, My 23
Memorial Auditorium
Screenplay by Jules Feiffer. Director
Mike Nichols follows the separate dis
intigrations of two former college
roommates, jack Nicholson becomes
a tax lawyer and Art Garfunkel a doc
tor; both are doomed from the be
ginning and neither escapes his fate.
An absolutely straight-faced type of
sequel to "The Graduate," and this is
not entirely a good thing. The point
apparently, is that none of us have a
chance — that is a reasonable opin
ion, but "Knowledge" pounds it
home a little too often.

Gunga Din ★ ★
Festival Cinema
Thunday, My 20-Wedne»day, My 26
A 1939 RKO Cary Grant/Victor
McLaughlin/Douglas Fairbanks Jr./
Sam Jaffe spectacular; impossible to
fully enjoy because of the things it
takes for granted. The principles do
very well what they were know to do
very well, but even the fastest of quips

and the longest of leaps are soured by
the theme. "Gunga Din" is a pro
foundly racist movie about happy-go
lucky imperialists crunching savage
disgusting beasts — that it never once
questions its premises is very ag
gravating. Din comes out as whiter
than the rest in the end, and that ap
parently was supposed to be a com
pliment. It isn't. At root the picture is
insidious. Procedurally good, and in
teresting, but insidious. With "The
Lives of a Bengal Lancer."

Thursday, July 20-Wednesday, July 26
Paramount, 1935. Another Kip
lingesque thriller that magnificently
extolls the virtues of the magnificent
English empire. Excellent melodrama,
but a movie whose time is past. Gary
Cooper's son (Richard Cromwell)
gives in to Afghan torture and then
redeems himself by killing them in
droves. Afghans died easily then.

Biograph
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and

'70s divorce, fill Clayburgh finally
gets a role which is equal to her ta
lent, and she doesn't disappoint.

The film is a bit slow in its middle
third, where the are some very weak
scenes with a therapist. However, in
general the film is comic and affect
ing without being cruel or sac
charine, Alan Bates stands out in a
fine supporting cast.

Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big
Sleep" or "The Maltese Falcon,"
some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al
most keeps you from realizing how
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise
Fletcher can be. Ann-Margret's
Rumanian cleavage is much in evi
dence.

More dying, and less life. More act

much. Gratuitous and boring. With

If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big

some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al
most keeps you from realizing how
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise

Rumanian cleavage is much in evi

Just what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy on
the pathos. Simone Signoret makes
the film worthwhile with her perfor
mance as an aging whore — she easily
overcomes the occasionally dumb
dialogue, and often provides humor
at unexpected moments. It is, unfor
tunately, one of them foreign things,
but it kinda makes me wish that I had
never dropped French 10. With "Dear

At first glance, 1) stunningly enter
taining and wildly visual 2) wildly en
tertaining and stunningly visual 3) the
kind of movie nobody makes any
more. On second thought it's delib
erately anesthetic; little more than the
financial successor to "Jaws." Except
for Alec Guiness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls, or escapees from
episode of Lassie; though Lucas is to
be praised for avoiding the asinine
political commentary implicit in
things like "Rollerball" and "Logan's
Run'' his decision to center the action
around the aformentioned members
of the Pepsi Generation rankles and
irks and peeves. True "2001" fans in
sist that for all its visual achievements
"Star Wars" is really very bland —
even though I still don't know what
the hell was going on in Kubrick's
movie I am tempted to agree.

The dominant sensation upon leav
ing this film is that is must have been a
very good play — the screen version
suffers by comparison. Nevertheless,
there is proof positive here that
Richard Burton is what they say he is
— his perfotnance here gives power
to a production that otherwise is a bit
stilted. With "Sailor Who Feil With

Mike Nichols follows the separate dis

roommates, jack Nicholson becomes
a tax lawyer and Art Garfunkel a doc

An absolutely straight-faced type of
sequel to "The Graduate," and this is
not entirely a good thing. The point
apparently, is that none of us have a
