Gamble. I did and came out a
winner. A few weeks ago while
looking through the San Fran
cisco telephone directory, an ad
for St. Pierre, "un restaurant
francais," caught my attention.
The graphics were sophisti
cated, the neighborhood ap
propriate (Pacific and
Montgomery, one block over
from Ernie's and Doro's), and
the adventure right. So, like the
student who waits until Sunday
night to study for the Modern
Europe final Monday morning, I
decided "Why not?", and took
the plunge. Having enjoyed the
consequences, I recommend
that you do the same.
Built in the 1860s, Diana's Sa
loon, which was reopened two
years ago as St. Pierre, was one
of the few survivors of the 1906
earthquake and fire. Today, with
its beautifully restored glass

arched doorway and marvelous
red brick walls, St. Pierre has
captured the color of old San
Francisco and the traditions of
France.
Green director's chairs, white
linen tablecloths and red carna
tions give the small interior a
fresh and open ambiance. Mir
rors and large, airy black and
white sketches cover one length
of the restaurant while the origi
nal wainscoting, now painted
white, spans the other. A well
trained staff provides good ser
vice.
We were seated by le prop
rietaire himself, Monsieur Pierre
Blouse, who gracefully placed
the napkins in our laps and pre
sented us with the evening's
"programme."
A menu of 10 entrees, five of
them organized into dinners
that include soup or salad, man
age to cover the "basics" of
haute cuisine. Prices are high,
starting with Supreme de Vol
aille Forestiere (breast of chic

ken sauteed with wild mus
hrooms and shallots) at $8.75 a la
carte; Canard Montmorency
and Filet au Poivre Vert are fea
tured at $10.25. Medaillon de
Boeuf carries the top dinner
price of $11.50.
Along with five different
salads on the a la carte side are
several appetizers, from $3.25
for a pate to $4.25 for smoked
salmon. We settled on some
thing in-between and ordered
the Escargots de Bourgogne
listed at $3.75. Baked and served
in special snail dishes, the snails
were small and tender and drip
ping in a rich butter sauce. We
both agreed a little more garlic
would have made this recipe
complete.
A great beginning always adds
excitement to a meal, and our
next selection of Salade Verte
Maison ($1.75) and Salade de
Cresson ($2.50) succeeded in
doing just that. Lengthy romaine
and tender-leafed butter lettuce
with a good vinaigrette and

finely grated blue cheese, made
up the house salad. Even the
simple Salade de Cresson, with
its peppery watercress and fresh
tomato slices, was prepared with
finesse.
While we finished our salads
and waited for the main course,
Medaillon de Veau Vallee
d'Auge ($10.25) and Saumon au
Champagne ($9.75), we sipped a
full-bodied white Burgandy
wine from Macon bottled under
St. Pierre's own label ($7).
Both the veal and the salmon
were above average. A change
from the creamy white wine or
sherry-sauced veal dishes usu
ally served, our veal entree was
laced with Calvados, the fiery
apple brandy from the Nor
mandy region. Tender and deli
cately sweet, this eastern white
veal dish was well-received. The
salmon, poached in a smooth
white wine and champagne
sauce that verged on the too
rich, was the evening's specialty.
A generous touch were two

vegetable dishes, lightly but
tered carrots, and braised zuc
chini and tomato. In addition,
sauteed potatoes were served
with the veal and rice accom
panied the salmon.
The desserts listed on the
menu were simple and imagina
tive. The Ganache ($2.25), St.
Pierre's own "Chocolate ex
travaganza" and the Coupe Pier
rot Gourmand ($2) should satisfy
any rich dessert connoisseur.
The Coupe Marron consisted
of scoops of French vanilla ice
cream decorated with dollops of
thickly whipped cream and rich
chestnut spread. Also enjoyed
was the lingering savor of vanilla
and caramel in the Creme
Caramel ($1.75). Usually called
Creme Renversee au Caramel,
this smooth egg custard was de
liciously enrobed in a cloak of
warm, brown caramel.
St. Pierre should be ap
proached with an empty
stomach and a full pocketbook.
With most items a la carte, the
tab rises quickly. Nevertheless,
the price is rarely without pleas
ant and memorable compensa
tion.
St. Pierre is open for lunch
Tuesday through Friday from
11:30 to 2:30. And for dinner on
Tuesday through Saturday from
6 to 10:30. Reservations are
suggested.
