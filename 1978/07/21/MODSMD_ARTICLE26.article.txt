Shadowbrook
Wharf & Capitola Roads

(408) 475-1511
Originally Shadowbrook was a
quaint log cabin lying at the
banks of the San Lorenzo River.
It was later abandoned and left
to ruin until two men decided to
convert this "Haunted House up
the River," as it had become
known, into a fine restaurant.
Since then, Shadowbrook has
shed its "haunted house" repu
tation and is known as one of the
most unique dining establish
ments in the area.
Though the restaurant's
cuisine is quite good, its rustic
and charming setting is the one
feature that makes Shadow
brook so unique. The restaurant
lies at the foot of a lush, green
hillside. One can descend the
hill by strolling down a winding
footpath or by taking the
"Shadowbrook Railway," actu
ally a cable car. Either way, one
can enjoy the pleasant view of
the river.
Shadowbrook's interior con
tinues this theme of rustic
beauty. Wood panelling, an
tique furniture and stone firep
laces create a feeling of warmth
and comfort.

Seafood is the predominant
item on the menu. For those
who prefer something other
than fish, there are beef, chic
ken and vegetarian dishes avail
able. Entree prices vary from

made this appetizer a true deli
cacy. However, we were rather
displeased to find several bits of
shell in the crepe.
A choice of Boston Clam
Chowder or Shadowbrook Salad
precedes all dinners. The soup is
of a thick consistency and defi
nitely one of the best chowders
available in the Bay Area. The
salad, on the other hand, was
merely average.. Cherry to
matoes, sliced mushrooms and
olives encircled a mound of let
tuce. Nothing unusual.
For our main course we de
cided on Salmon Filet ($9.75) and
Lobster and Sirloin ($11.95). The
broiled King Salmon was excel
lent — fresh and moist. The Hol
landaise sauce which topped
this dish was somewhat nondes
cript in flavor. The herb rice ac
companying the salmon was also
quite ordinary.
The high quality of Shadow
brook's seafood was further
demonstrated in the lobster.
The sirloin steak, which I re
quested medium-rare and un
fortunately received medium
well, was good but not outstand
ing. A large baked potato was
also included in this dinner.
For dessert we chose the
Mousse Denise de Cafe and

Crepe Patisserie, both $1.50.
The coffee-flavored mousse was
a perfect choice to top off a rich
meal. It was light and just sweet
enough to tantalize the tas
tebuds, not drown them. A
custard-filled crepe, smothered
in a thin caramel sauce was tasty
but off limits for you waist
watchers.
Contributing to our evening at
Shadowbrook was the service.
The waiters were extremely ami
able and often inquired about
our enjoyment of the meal.
Located south of Santa Cruz,
Shadowbrook is about an hour
drive from Stanford. But this
charming, unusual restaurant is
well-worth the drive.
