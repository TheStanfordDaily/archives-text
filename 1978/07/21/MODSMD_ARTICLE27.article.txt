Carter denies vendetta
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
yesterday renewed his criticism of Soviet
trials of dissidents but said he has "not em
barked on a vendetta" against the Russians
and remains hopeful for better relations.
The president also told a news confer
ence that he hopes the imprisoned Soviet
dissidents will be released but he declined
to discuss any negotiations in which the Un
ited States might play a role.
Asked if he were aware of any talks un
derway for the release of Anatoly
Shcharansky and other Soviet dissidents,
Carter said, "not specifically."
The president said cancellation of the sale
of a sophisticated computer to the Soviet
news agency Tass is "all the action I intend
to take for the time being" to express U.S.
displeasure with the treatment of Soviet dis
sidents.
"We have a deep commitment in our na
tion to the enhancement of human rights
not only here but around the world," Carter
said, but he stressed that he has "not em
barked on a vendetta against the Soviet Un
ion. We cannot interfere in the internal af
fairs of the Soviet Union."
Asked about suggestions by some mem
bers of Congress that the United States de
mand that the 1980 Olympic games be
moved out of Moscow, Carter said such a
decision would be made by the Olympic
committee, a non-governmental body.
"My own hope is that American athletes
will participate in the 1980 Olympics," he
said.
Asked about the recent statement by U.N.
Ambassador Andrew Young that there are
"thousands of political prisoners" in the
United States, Carter said he is confident
Young feels he made a mistake in making
such a claim.
"I've discussed this with Andy Young and
I don't believe he will make a similar state
ment again," the president added.
Drug chief resigns
Washington — Dr. Peter Bourne, the
White House expert on drug abuse who
himself became enmeshed in a drug-related
problem, resigned yesterday, saying he
wanted to spare President Carter additional
embarrassment.
"I felt I owed it to the president to free
him of this burden," Bourne said. "I felt it
wasn't fair to him, particularly with tonight's
news conference."
Bourne's resignation came less than 24
hours after he admitted writing a prescrip
tion for a potent sedative to a fictitious name
and was given a paid leave of absence from
his $51,000-a-year job.
The prescription has led to investigations
by District of Columbia and suburban Vir
ginia police. It also brought a flood of criti
cism, some of it from White House staffers
who felt Bourne should have quit following
the disclosure Wednesday.
The president, who returned earlier this
week from what was hailed by aides as a
highly successful economic summit meet
ing in Germany, had scheduled a news con
ference in prime television time last night,
his first at that hour.
Some aides feared that the luster of Car
ter's summit performance would be lost by
questions about the Bourne affair.
In an effort to dispel that problem,
Bourne submitted his resignation shortly
after 3 p.m. EDT. It was officially announced
just minutes laterby White House press sec
retary Jody Powell.
In a voice heavy with fatigue, Bourne said
he had not talked with Carter before sub
mitting his letter. Powell agreed that it had
been Bourne's decision alone.
"There's been no change in the facts of
the situation," Bourne said in a telephone
interview. "I wanted to see what would
happen this morning. The spinoffs are still
continuing."
Mitchell gets January parole
Washington — John Mitchell, the last
Watergate criminal to go to prison, was
granted a parole yesterday, effective Jan. 19.
He will have served 19 months of his one
to-four year sentence, counting five months
freedom on medical furlough.
The U.S. Parole Commission apparently
accorded little weight to Mitchell's age and
infirmities since the length of his sentence is
similar to that of his two co-defendants,
H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman whose
time in prison was set at 18 months each.

The decision follows an interview with
Mitchell by commission investigators July 5.
The former attorney general, a one-time
law partner of Richard Nixon and Nixon's
manager in two winning presidential cam
paigns, will be 65 in September. This year he
has undergone major surgery twice: for re
pair of a weakened artery in his abdomen,
and for replacement of an arthritic right hip.
The five months Mitchell was absent from
prison counts as time served.
In recent weeks Mitchell has progressed
from walking with crutches to using a cane.
He works in the institution's education sec
tion and for a time was a clerk in the library.
Like many others involved in Watergate,
Mitchell has been working on a book.
Corona granted new trial
San Francisco — Juan Corona, convicted
of the machete murders of 25 farmhands,
was granted a new trial yesterday by the
California Supreme Court which voted 6-1
to uphold a lower court decision.
Last May, the three-member state Court
of Appeals granted Corona a new trial on
grounds that his former attorney had made
a "farce and mockery" of his defense by
spending too much time trying to cash in on
a book about the case.
The attorney general, who had hoped for
a reversal of the appeals court ruling, ar
gued unsuccessfully that the Court of Ap
peals had erred in finding Corona's ex
counsel Richard Hawk incompetent.
Corona, 44, was convicted of mass mur
der after the fertile peach orchards near
Yuba City yielded the hacked bodies of 25
migrant workers in 1971. After the 1973 con
viction, he was sentenced to life at Soledad
prison.
The appeals court originally granted a
new trial on finding Hawk had failed to ad
vise Corona to plead mental incapacity as a
defense.
The court also noted that part of Hawk's
fees for defending Corona included sole
rights to the convicted murderer's life story,
and held the literary contract prevented
Hawk from "devoting the requisite undi
vided loyalty and service to his client."
Little Mideast progress
Leeds Castle, England — A two-day Egyp
tian and Israeli foreign ministers' meeting
ended Wednesday without any apparent
progress toward peace in the Middle East,
but with a pledge from Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance to follow through with more
negotiations.
"I believe Egypt and Israel remain fully
committed to establishing a genuine peace
and we will continue to help them in that
effort," Vance said in a statement issued at
the 13th-century moated castle where the
meeting was held.
Vance mediated the talks, which focused
on the future of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip.
As the talks were ending here, President
Anwar Sadat of Egypt declared in Khartoum,
Sudan, that Israel was "still dreaming of ex
pansion" and said it could be "the cause of
grave damage" to the Mideast. Sadat made
the statement in a speech to a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity.
Israeli sources referred to the Leeds par
ley, held in a sitting room once favored by
King Henry VIII, as "a seminar" rather than a
negotiating session. One delegate, how
ever, said it was the first time he had
thoroughly understood Egypt's position
and felt Egypt understood Israel.
1980 Olympics boycott?
San Francisco — Avital Shcharansky, who
said she does not want to live without the
hope that her husband will be freed by the
Soviet Union some day, urged Wednesday
that nations withdraw from the 1980 Olym
pics in Moscow.
The 27-year-old wife of the imprisoned
computer scientist told a crowded news
conference that the international commun
ity should consider "the possibility of with
drawing from the Olympic games, or trans
ferring them from Moscow altogether.
"There is a parallel with the scheduled
games in Russia and the 1936 Olympics in
Germany," she said.
Speaking in Russian through an interpre
ter, the slightly built woman, who now re
sides in Israel, termed the German games "a
propagandistic parade for the Nazis, and I
think having the Olympic games in the
Soviet Union is immoral."

Shcharansky was convicted of treason last
week by a Moscow court and sentenced to
13 years in prison.
On Wednesday Shcharansky was moved
from Lefortovo Prison in Moscow to the
grim 18th century Vladimir Prison, which
has been condemned by human rights ac
tivists for frequent beatings and poor condi
tions.
Wave of strikes across nation
Negotiators reached tentative agreement
yesterday to end a week-long strike by
Philadelphia municipal workers that has left
streets dotted with litter. In Washington, a
wildcat transit strike caused mammoth traf
fic jams in the nation's capital, while in New
Orleans, one-third of the city's striking gar
bagemen made pickups for the first time in
three days.
And throughout the nation, federal postal
workers were threatening to strike at mid
night.
City workers in Philadelphia, who walked
out demanding higher pay and no layoffs,
manned picket lines despite the tentative
contract agreement reached early yesterday
morning. They vote on the proposal Friday
by secret ballot.
All bus and subways in Washington were
idled when operators honored picket lines
set up by mechanics protesting a delay in
settlement of their wage dispute. A half
million commuters either drove or stayed
home, causing large-scale traffic tieups,
especially on bridges from the suburbs. The
area already was under a pollution alert.
In New Orleans, where the odor of gar
bage began to spread through some
neighborhoods, about a third of the 328
garbage collectors made their rounds yes
terday. But dissident union members
stormed from a meeting with Mayor Ernest
Mo rial, refusing to end a walkout which was
sparked by complaints about broken down
trucks.
Israeli women get draft break
Jerusalem — The Israeli Parliament
granted religious women a sweeping new
exemption from compulsory military duty
yesterday, a move applauded by some as a
protection of women against "temptation"
and denounced by others as an invitation to
lie and evade the draft.
The legislation was approved by a vote of
54-45 after one of Parliament's most bitter
debates in recent years and after a 12-hour
filibuster by the opposition Labor Party and
the liberal Democratic Movement for
Change.
The Laborites called the bill discriminat
ory against the non-religious and predicted
it would create a shortage in military per
sonnel.
It amends Israel's 1959 draft law, which
requires women at age 18 to serve 24
months in the military and men 36 months.
Most women serve as secretaries or in
communications, though a few have joined
a new armor program.
Previously, women demanding military
exemptions on religious grounds were
examined by rabbinical boards. The new
amendment requires only that women sign
an affidavit asserting that they abide by
Jewish dietary laws and do not travel on the
Sabbath.
Orthodox groups contend that the army's
integration of sexes and sudden freedom
from parental oversight can corrupt young
women's morals.
Atkins denied parole
Frontera — Susan Atkins, the Charles
Manson follower who confessed she stab
bed pregnant actress Sharon Tate to death
in 1969, was denied parole yesterday from
her life prison sentence.
The Community Release Board panel's
decision followed a five-hour hearing at the
California Institution for Women at Front
era.
The Board said Atkins' attitude had
changed little since her days with Manson.
They cited her prison conversion as a
"born-again Christian" as evidence of the
same personality traits which led her to fol
low Manson.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except coastal low
clouds and fog extending inland nights and
mornings. Little temperature change. Lows
in the 50s. Highs in low 60s along the coast
to the mid 80s inland.
