Hines said Hickethier told him
he was "sick of the accusations"
and to "punch out and go
home." The housekeeper, who
has not received a raise in five
years of employment, requested
that Hickethier put it in writing
so he couldn't later be accused
of "walking off the job." Hines
said Hickethier refused.
On the firing of the house
keeper, Hickethier commented
that "Mr. Hines was justifiably
terminated. We will go to the
grievance hearing to determine
the outcome."
Hines punched out and went
to personnel to obtain some
written documentation of his
suspension. According to Hines,
George Hallett, employee rela
tions representative, told Hines
that Hickethier had every right
to send him home, but said Hic
kethier would have been "a
damned fool" to put down his
actions in writing.
Hines called Sue Frey, an or
ganizer for USE for legal assis
tance. Hallett refused to talk
with Frey.
On Monday, Hines returned
to the hospital, this time with his
attorney, Tim Wright. Again, he
was refused admittance with any
legal aid or witness. On Tues
day, Hines' employment was
terminated.
"We're really going to push
this grievance because this inci
dent is so outrageous," said
Frey. "O.V. has been harassed
since 1973 when he came out in
favor of unionizing the Medical
Center employees."
Hines is active in the unioniz
ing efforts because he has
"never seen so many scared
employees," he said. "There are
many employees that the hospi
tal owes years of back pay for not
receiving the 12 percent base
pay increase for the night shift,"
he said.
Hines has filed approximately
15 grievances since 1973 and
has not won one yet. Florie
Berger, also an organizer for
USE, said "it's hard to win a grie
vance when you're not going to
a disinterested party."
Ron Twomey, director of per
sonnel, often presides over the
grievances. According to Hines,
"Twomey has never ruled in
favor of any Stanford
employee."
Hines has another arbitration
that will be heard Monday. This
complaint concerns Hines' not
receiving a raise in pay, other
than cost-of-living increases,
since being hired.
"I am working out of my clas
sification," said Hines. "I'm
doing the duties of an outside
janitor and not getting paid the
same wages."
Twomey, who will preside
over the most recent grievance,
said, "I am not able to comment
because Hines had filed an in
ternal grievance. I don't want to
prejudge the case and so have
avoided reviewing it in ad
vance."
