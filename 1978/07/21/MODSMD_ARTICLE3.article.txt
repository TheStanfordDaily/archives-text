# Postal workers stay on the job

### 
Washington (AP) — Negotia
tions on a new contract for more
than 500,000 U.S. Postal Service
workers continued past a mid
night deadline yesterday, but
union negotiators said the two
sides were very close to an ag
reement and signaled for work
ers to remain on the job.
Union sources let word out
late last night that agreement
had been reached on two issues
that they felt could trigger a
walkout — retention of a no
layoff clause and future wage
protection from inflation.
Sources close to the talks said
bargainers were hopeful of settl
ing in time to announce an ag
reement before the deadline
when the old contract expired,
but the two sides still had failed
to resolve the size of general
wage increases.
Some local union leaders had
threatened a midnight walkout if
there were no settlement.
However, in Washington,
leaders of three postal unions
clearly wanted to dissuade
postal workers from such action
which is in violation of federal
law.
Earlier, one union source said
he was very confident of reach

ing a settlement soon. Chief
federal mediator, Wayne Hor
vitz, told reporters yesterday af
ternoon that he would keep the
two sides meeting past midnight
as long as they were closing in
on a settlement.
Both sides were described as
being in a loose, jovial mood and
working hard for an announce
ment sometime before mid
night, so postal employees
could be alerted to report as
usual for midnight shifts.
The two sides resumed face
to-face negotiations under the
auspices of federal mediators
yesterday for the first time in
three days.
The breakthrough in the talks
reportedly came at midday,
when the Postal Service expres
sed willingness to grant a critical
union demand that employees
remain protected against job
layoffs.
Through three months of bar
gaining, union negotiators had
insisted retention of the no
layoff clause was crucial to ag
reement on a contract replacing
the one expiring at midnight.
Until yesterday, management
had insisted with equal determi
nation that the clause must go.
