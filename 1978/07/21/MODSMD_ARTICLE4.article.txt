## Keep ROTC out 
### 
An Alumni Association committee will be meeting
this fall to decide whether to recommend that the
association support returning ROTC to campus. We
wish they'd save themselves the trouble. '
President Richard Lyman has made it clear that, in
the absence of demonstrated student interest in
ROTC, he does not anticipate its return.
The student interest is there. It was demonstrated in
front of the Career Planning and Placement Center last
year when a Marine Corps recruiter was nearly pre
vented from entering the building to do his job.
And the people in front of the CPPC were not "a
minority of radicals"; there is every reason to believe
that the great majority of those students who have
considered the matter at all oppose ROTC's presence
here.
For the few who wish to take advantage of ROTC
training, the University of Santa Clara's Army ROTC
program and UC-Berkeley's Air Force program are
close by. No one is being "denied" ROTC by going to
Stanford; the issue is merely whether Stanford wants
to make the political statement bringing back ROTC
surely will be.
That political statement is not alien to the wishes of
those who favor ROTC's return: the New Founders
League, whose president authored the resolution
favoring ROTC at the Alumni Senate meeting in May, is
a group of alumni who believe strongly that the Uni
versity is going too far to the left in its policies, and
should return to supporting "American" values.
The return of ROTC, the league believes, would
begin to reverse the trend.
In our view, the "American" value to be served is
distrust of the state by private individuals. Stanford
should not consider itself an instrument of the gov
ernment, and institutions which house ROTC are act
ing as military recruiters.
