Summer quarter at Stanford is a different experience from the regular academic
year. The pace is slower; there is more time for recreation and contemplation. And
the student and faculty population is different, smaller but more diverse and
professionally oriented.
These differences provide an opportunity for new topics and insights on this
page. The subject matter can be anything from what it's like to live at Stanford
during a summer conference to the problems encountered by the world's newest
nation. The page is yours.
