# OAU summitry stands at a crossroads

When the heads of state
gather for the 16th annual sum
mit meeting of the Organization
of African Unity in Khartoum this
week they face unprecedented
conflict among their number.
That fact is often obscured in the
preoccupation with Russians,
Cubans and other foreign milit
ary actors on the continent.
Consider: Ethiopia and the
Somali Republic have been en
gaged in all out warfare over the
efforts of the latter to incorpo
rate the Somali ethnics living in
the Ogaden region of Ethiopia
into a "greater Somalia"; Eritrea,
a reluctant northern province of
Ethiopia, has been fighting a war
of secession for over 10 years;
the rebellions in the Shaba Pro
vince of Zaire (1977 and 1978) are
the most recent incidents in a
legacy formerly called the
"Katanga secession." The
domestic issues there are now
complicated by the outcome of
the internal struggle in Angola
(1975-76).
The group backed by Zaire
lost out to the now governing
MPLA which has resulted in hos
tile relations and border inci
dents between Zaire and Angola
for two years; Morocco and
Mauritania are in direct conflict
with Algeria over the borders of
the former Spanish Sahara;
Libya has fostered coup at
tempts against the governments
of both Egypt and the Sudan,
and supports an armed in
surgency in Chad; the East Afri
can Economic Community has
broken up and the border bet
ween Kenya and Tanzania is
closed (all of these clashes are
quite apart from the struggles in
Southern Africa).
Fundamental question
These events raise a funda
mental question about the state
of the rules prevailing in African
international relations. Until re
cently a cardinal principle of
inter-African relations has been

mutual respect for the political
boundaries of the respective
states, however arbitrarily they
might have been drawn in the
last century by the European
colonial powers. Explicit refer
ences to "territorial integrity,"
"nonalignment" and "noninter
vention" in each other's internal
affairs were written into the
OAU charter at the founding in
1963.
Left unwritten was the implica
tion that disregard for this rule
would open the forbidding
prospect of numerous border
conflicts deriving from historical
anomalies enshrined in colonial
boundaries. The premise of ar
bitrary boundaries could conve
niently cover a multitude of
present-day adventures which is
why the principle of noninter
vention was adopted.
Have the rules changed? True,
there has been intermittent
inter-African conflict since the
mid-19605. In several cases the
good offices of the OAU were
used successfully in mediation,
e.g., Morocco versus Mauritania
and Kenya versus Somalia.
But the increased conflict of
the past two years would suggest
that the rules are changing. The
quest for allies by African states
in conflict has led to stepped up
foreign military involvement.
Somalia unabashedly broke the
rules in the Ogaden (despite of
ficial denials); a breach all the
more embarrassing as it
backfired when the Soviets
switched sides. Libya
shamelessly meddles in the in
ternal affairs of her neighbors.
"Shaba II" signals only more
hostility between Angola and
Zaire, exacerbated by foreign
participation.
New phase
The relative silence of the
OAU on these threats to the in
tegrity of the member states
causes one to wonder if Africa is
entering a new phase in which

state boundaries and neighbor
ing regimes will become open
targets for political opportunism
by individual African leaders or
regimes with mischievous mo
tives.
If the old rules are increasingly
moot, conflict will increase and
more great power (or proxy) in
volvement in African political af
fairs is inevitable — and highly
dangerous. If the old rules are
not dead, African statesmen
must collectively reassert the
charter principles of the 49-
member OAU — emphatically
and unequivocally.
In the wake of the 1978 military
actions in Zaire, President Nye
rere of Tanzania, Africa's most
credible philosopher
statesman, lectured the West on
foreign intervention. He re
minded Europe and the United
States that the Cubans and
Soviets were only in countries to
which they had been invited;
that it was arrogant for the West
ern countries to discuss an Afri
can peace-keeping force; and
implied that the European action
in Shaba reflected a higher value
on capitalism and corruption
than African freedom.
In sum, the Western-backed
military response to the rebell
ion in Shaba was seen by many
Africans not as a rescue mission
but as a gambit of Western
domination. President Nyerere
adds an important perspective
to what has to be acknowledged
as an unimaginative Western re
sponse to the increasing conflict
in Africa.
French empire intact
In the anxiety over Russians
and Cubans, it is forgotten that,
although the British, Belgians
and Portuguese have essentially
disengaged politically from Af
rica, the French have not. With
the notable exceptions of
Algeria, Guinea and perhaps
Congo, the former French em
pire in Africa is remarkably in

tact.
French troops have been used
to influence the course of events
in African countries on many oc
casions since 1960, e.g., Gabon,
Chad, Congo, Cameroun, Cent
ral African Republic, etc. A re
cent coup attempt on the gov
ernment of Benin (formerly
Dahomey) has been attributed
to French instigation by more
than one source.
And it is President Giscard
d'Estaing who proposes an "Af
rican Corps" to act as a standby
military force with French sup
port. (Even the Belgians, who
stand to lose more in Zaire than
France, were embarrassed
enough by this suggestion that
they proposed such a force
should be "NATO" supported,
not exclusively French.)
If the principles of territorial
integrity, nonalignment and
nonintervention in the internal
affairs of member states are not
vigorously reasserted, it will not
be just because of the few states
which depend upon the support
of the Soviets and Cubans. It is
likely that the "aligned" leaders
of the francophone states will
want to dilute any such declara
tions so they can continue to rely
on French economic and milit
ary support.
African solutions to African
problems is a good principle. It
is now time for the OAU to de
monstrate some unity and lead
ership in that very respect. It is
crucial that President Nyerere
take the opportunity at the OAU
summit to lecture his own col
leagues on the conditions which
attract foreign involvement;
namely, weak, corrupt regimes
and interference of African
countries in each other's affairs.
Drift will continue
If the OAU does not, or can
not, come to a new consensus
on the rules governing the inter
relations of African states, the
present drift will continue. Bilat-

eral meddling will likely increase
as ideological camps become
more rigid; the OAU and the
principles it represents will be
displaced as a norm or reference
point in the minds of African
policy-makers by ad hoc calcula
tions related only to expe
diency; more lethal weaponry
will be introduced into inter-
African conflicts; more foreign
soldiers, whether African, Euro
pean or from elsewhere, will ap
pear as combatants; regimes
and state boundaries will change
by force; and Africa will become
what everybody said they did
not want: a theater for East-West
confrontation.
Resolve by the OAU cannot
stop such a trend, but it might
inhibit it.
Responsible leaders like Nye
rere should be encouraged to
take a firm and courageous
stand at the Khartoum meeting
in mobilizing a categorical re
statement of basic charter prin
ciples. The OAU should also be
encouraged to speak to the mat
ter of peace-keeping forces, stat
ing unequivocally that any such
body, if there is to be one, will
be a creation of that organiza
tion.
Politics on the African conti
nent will likely become more
fluid over the next few years.
The old consensus and rules
may be permanently weakened.
The outcome of this week's
OAU summit will signal the truth
of that proposition. If African
summitry cannot pronounce
firmly and as one on the basic
principles, it will serve only to
complicate, rather than contri
bute to the resolution of, the
struggles in Southern Africa.

affairs of member states are not
vigorously reasserted, it will not
be just because of the few states
which depend upon the support
of the Soviets and Cubans. It is
likely that the "aligned" leaders
of the francophone states will
want to dilute any such declara
tions so they can continue to rely
on French economic and milit
ary support.
African solutions to African
problems is a good principle. It
is now time for the OAU to de
monstrate some unity and lead
ership in that very respect. It is
crucial that President Nyerere
take the opportunity at the OAU
summit to lecture his own col
leagues on the conditions which
attract foreign involvement;
namely, weak, corrupt regimes
and interference of African
countries in each other's affairs.
Drift will continue
If the OAU does not, or can
not, come to a new consensus
on the rules governing the inter
relations of African states, the
present drift will continue. Bilat-

eral meddling will likely increase
as ideological camps become
more rigid; the OAU and the
principles it represents will be
displaced as a norm or reference
point in the minds of African
policy-makers by ad hoc calcula
tions related only to expe
diency; more lethal weaponry
will be introduced into inter-
African conflicts; more foreign
soldiers, whether African, Euro
pean or from elsewhere, will ap
pear as combatants; regimes
and state boundaries will change
by force; and Africa will become
what everybody said they did
not want: a theater for East-West
confrontation.
Resolve by the OAU cannot
stop such a trend, but it might
inhibit it.
Responsible leaders like Nye
rere should be encouraged to
take a firm and courageous
stand at the Khartoum meeting
in mobilizing a categorical re
statement of basic charter prin
ciples. The OAU should also be
encouraged to speak to the mat
ter of peace-keeping forces, stat
ing unequivocally that any such
body, if there is to be one, will
be a creation of that organiza
tion.
Politics on the African conti
nent will likely become more
fluid over the next few years.
The old consensus and rules
may be permanently weakened.
The outcome of this week's
OAU summit will signal the truth
of that proposition. If African
summitry cannot pronounce

When the heads of state
gather for the 16th annual sum
mit meeting of the Organization
of African Unity in Khartoum this
week they face unprecedented
conflict among their number.
That fact is often obscured in the
preoccupation with Russians,
Cubans and other foreign milit
ary actors on the continent.
Consider: Ethiopia and the
Somali Republic have been en
gaged in all out warfare over the
efforts of the latter to incorpo
rate the Somali ethnics living in
the Ogaden region of Ethiopia
into a "greater Somalia"; Eritrea,
a reluctant northern province of
Ethiopia, has been fighting a war
of secession for over 10 years;
the rebellions in the Shaba Pro
vince of Zaire (1977 and 1978) are
the most recent incidents in a
legacy formerly called the
"Katanga secession." The
domestic issues there are now
complicated by the outcome of
the internal struggle in Angola
(1975-76).
The group backed by Zaire
lost out to the now governing
MPLA which has resulted in hos
tile relations and border inci
dents between Zaire and Angola
for two years; Morocco and
Mauritania are in direct conflict
with Algeria over the borders of
the former Spanish Sahara;
Libya has fostered coup at
tempts against the governments
of both Egypt and the Sudan,
and supports an armed in
surgency in Chad; the East Afri
can Economic Community has
broken up and the border bet
ween Kenya and Tanzania is
closed (all of these clashes are
quite apart from the struggles in
Southern Africa).
Fundamental question
These events raise a funda
mental question about the state
of the rules prevailing in African
international relations. Until re
cently a cardinal principle of
inter-African relations has been

mutual respect for the political
boundaries of the respective
states, however arbitrarily they
might have been drawn in the
last century by the European
colonial powers. Explicit refer
ences to "territorial integrity,"
"nonalignment" and "noninter
vention" in each other's internal
affairs were written into the
OAU charter at the founding in
1963.
Left unwritten was the implica
tion that disregard for this rule
would open the forbidding
prospect of numerous border
conflicts deriving from historical
anomalies enshrined in colonial
boundaries. The premise of ar
bitrary boundaries could conve
niently cover a multitude of
present-day adventures which is
why the principle of noninter
vention was adopted.
Have the rules changed? True,
there has been intermittent
inter-African conflict since the
mid-19605. In several cases the
good offices of the OAU were
used successfully in mediation,
e.g., Morocco versus Mauritania
and Kenya versus Somalia.
But the increased conflict of
the past two years would suggest
that the rules are changing. The
quest for allies by African states
in conflict has led to stepped up
foreign military involvement.
Somalia unabashedly broke the
rules in the Ogaden (despite of
ficial denials); a breach all the
more embarrassing as it
backfired when the Soviets
switched sides. Libya
shamelessly meddles in the in
ternal affairs of her neighbors.
"Shaba II" signals only more
hostility between Angola and
Zaire, exacerbated by foreign
participation.
New phase
The relative silence of the
OAU on these threats to the in
tegrity of the member states
causes one to wonder if Africa is
entering a new phase in which

state boundaries and neighbor
ing regimes will become open
targets for political opportunism
by individual African leaders or
regimes with mischievous mo
tives.
If the old rules are increasingly
moot, conflict will increase and
more great power (or proxy) in
volvement in African political af
fairs is inevitable — and highly
dangerous. If the old rules are
not dead, African statesmen
must collectively reassert the
charter principles of the 49-
member OAU — emphatically
and unequivocally.
In the wake of the 1978 military
actions in Zaire, President Nye
rere of Tanzania, Africa's most
credible philosopher
statesman, lectured the West on
foreign intervention. He re
minded Europe and the United
States that the Cubans and
Soviets were only in countries to
which they had been invited;
that it was arrogant for the West
ern countries to discuss an Afri
can peace-keeping force; and
implied that the European action
in Shaba reflected a higher value
on capitalism and corruption
than African freedom.
In sum, the Western-backed
military response to the rebell
ion in Shaba was seen by many
Africans not as a rescue mission
but as a gambit of Western
domination. President Nyerere
adds an important perspective
to what has to be acknowledged
as an unimaginative Western re
sponse to the increasing conflict
in Africa.
French empire intact
In the anxiety over Russians
and Cubans, it is forgotten that,
although the British, Belgians
and Portuguese have essentially
disengaged politically from Af
rica, the French have not. With
the notable exceptions of
Algeria, Guinea and perhaps
Congo, the former French em
pire in Africa is remarkably in

tact.
French troops have been used
to influence the course of events
in African countries on many oc
casions since 1960, e.g., Gabon,
Chad, Congo, Cameroun, Cent
ral African Republic, etc. A re
cent coup attempt on the gov
ernment of Benin (formerly
Dahomey) has been attributed
to French instigation by more
than one source.
And it is President Giscard
d'Estaing who proposes an "Af
rican Corps" to act as a standby
military force with French sup
port. (Even the Belgians, who
stand to lose more in Zaire than
France, were embarrassed
enough by this suggestion that
they proposed such a force
should be "NATO" supported,
not exclusively French.)
If the principles of territorial
integrity, nonalignment and
nonintervention in the internal
affairs of member states are not
vigorously reasserted, it will not
be just because of the few states
which depend upon the support
of the Soviets and Cubans. It is
likely that the "aligned" leaders

tions so they can continue to rely

tegrity of the member states
causes one to wonder if Africa is
entering a new phase in which

state boundaries and neighbor
ing regimes will become open
targets for political opportunism
by individual African leaders or
regimes with mischievous mo
tives.
If the old rules are increasingly
moot, conflict will increase and
more great power (or proxy) in
volvement in African political af
fairs is inevitable — and highly
dangerous. If the old rules are
not dead, African statesmen
must collectively reassert the
charter principles of the 49-
member OAU — emphatically
and unequivocally.
In the wake of the 1978 military
actions in Zaire, President Nye
rere of Tanzania, Africa's most
credible philosopher
statesman, lectured the West on
foreign intervention. He re
minded Europe and the United
States that the Cubans and
Soviets were only in countries to
which they had been invited;
that it was arrogant for the West
ern countries to discuss an Afri
can peace-keeping force; and
implied that the European action
in Shaba reflected a higher value
on capitalism and corruption
than African freedom.
In sum, the Western-backed
military response to the rebell
ion in Shaba was seen by many
Africans not as a rescue mission
but as a gambit of Western
domination. President Nyerere
adds an important perspective
to what has to be acknowledged
as an unimaginative Western re
sponse to the increasing conflict
in Africa.
French empire intact
In the anxiety over Russians
and Cubans, it is forgotten that,
although the British, Belgians
and Portuguese have essentially
disengaged politically from Af
rica, the French have not. With
the notable exceptions of
Algeria, Guinea and perhaps
Congo, the former French em
pire in Africa is remarkably in

tact.
French troops have been used
to influence the course of events
in African countries on many oc
casions since 1960, e.g., Gabon,
Chad, Congo, Cameroun, Cent
ral African Republic, etc. A re
cent coup attempt on the gov
ernment of Benin (formerly
Dahomey) has been attributed
to French instigation by more
than one source.
And it is President Giscard
d'Estaing who proposes an "Af
rican Corps" to act as a standby
military force with French sup
port. (Even the Belgians, who
stand to lose more in Zaire than
France, were embarrassed
enough by this suggestion that
they proposed such a force
should be "NATO" supported,
not exclusively French.)
If the principles of territorial
integrity, nonalignment and
nonintervention in the internal
affairs of member states are not
vigorously reasserted, it will not
be just because of the few states
which depend upon the support
of the Soviets and Cubans. It is
likely that the "aligned" leaders
of the francophone states will
want to dilute any such declara
tions so they can continue to rely
on French economic and milit
ary support.
African solutions to African
problems is a good principle. It
is now time for the OAU to de
monstrate some unity and lead
ership in that very respect. It is
crucial that President Nyerere
take the opportunity at the OAU
summit to lecture his own col
leagues on the conditions which
attract foreign involvement;
namely, weak, corrupt regimes
and interference of African
countries in each other's affairs.
Drift will continue
If the OAU does not, or can
not, come to a new consensus
on the rules governing the inter
relations of African states, the
present drift will continue. Bilat-

eral meddling will likely increase
as ideological camps become
more rigid; the OAU and the
principles it represents will be
displaced as a norm or reference
point in the minds of African
policy-makers by ad hoc calcula
tions related only to expe
diency; more lethal weaponry
will be introduced into inter-
African conflicts; more foreign
soldiers, whether African, Euro
pean or from elsewhere, will ap
pear as combatants; regimes
and state boundaries will change
by force; and Africa will become
what everybody said they did
not want: a theater for East-West
confrontation.
Resolve by the OAU cannot
stop such a trend, but it might
inhibit it.
Responsible leaders like Nye
rere should be encouraged to
take a firm and courageous
stand at the Khartoum meeting
in mobilizing a categorical re
statement of basic charter prin
ciples. The OAU should also be
encouraged to speak to the mat
ter of peace-keeping forces, stat
ing unequivocally that any such
body, if there is to be one, will
be a creation of that organiza
tion.
Politics on the African conti
nent will likely become more
fluid over the next few years.
The old consensus and rules
may be permanently weakened.
The outcome of this week's
OAU summit will signal the truth
of that proposition. If African
summitry cannot pronounce
firmly and as one on the basic
principles, it will serve only to
complicate, rather than contri
bute to the resolution of, the
struggles in Southern Africa.
