# Sex study shows men expected to move first

Los Angeles (AP) — Despite the
breakdown of the double stan
dard of sexuality morality, it's
still up to the male to make the
first move, a study of college
students has found.
Letitia Anne Peplau, a profes
sor of social psychology at the
University of California at Los
Angeles, said the two-year study
of 200 couples in the Boston area
found 95 percent of the women
waited for men to make sexual
overtures, fearing that for them
to act first would threaten the
male ego.
"There are no easy rules to
explain why people do what they
do," Peplau said, "but I think
women fear that to violate stan
dards of traditional behavior
could be to invite misun
derstanding. If the woman
should suddenly become the in
itiator of sex, some men would
feel threatened."
She added: "Sexual role

playing provides a familiar, un
derstandable set of guidelines
for male-female interactions."
Results of the study were pub
lished in the current issue of the
quarterly Journal of Social Is
sues. The study was directed by
Peplau and two other social
psychologists — Professor Zick
Rubin of Brandeis University and
Professor Charles Hill of the
University of Washington.
The study also found that
when a couple began having sex
— or whether they abstained —
had no effect on the durability of
their relationship.
Of the couples in the study, 41
percent had sex within a month
of meeting, 41 percent began
having sex after a month and 18
percent abstained.
But over the two-year period,
46 percent of each group had
broken up, 34 percent were still
dating and 20 percent got mar
ried.
