# A new trustee to help keep the business running
## 
### John Nielsen 
Editor's Note: This is the second in a
four-part series devoted to Stanford's
new alumni-elected members of the
Board of Trustees.
"It's not a business. It's an institution.
But it has a lot of things in it that have to
be run in a business-like manner." So
said John Packard of the job he begins
this September as a member of the Board
of Trustees.
Packard feels that the primary task of
the trustees is "working to provide a
quality education at a reasonable cost"
— though there are other considerations
of importance he feels that they are "not
really in the mainstream of the trustee
function."
Recent criticism
According to Packard, little of the re
cent criticism of trustee performance has
had much to do with that "mainstream."
Students, for example "have never been
happy with the trustees — not in the last
10 years, at least. But I'm sure that you
should react to that without sitting down
and really thinking about what the trus
tees' job is."
When evaluating the actions of the
board, Packard said that "the question to
be Iqoked at turns on attacking the job to
be done with the right priority, and the
first priority is running the University."
Packard notes that the trustees do not in
and of themselves "run" Stanford —
their function is "fiduciary responsibility
for the endowment" — yet he maintains
that "perception of what the trustees are
doing" is all too often lacking.
"Your biggest concerns are paying at

tention to having the best education and
faculty, and getting the best students
here. We're dealing with inflation that's
currently — name it, its at 7, 8, 9, 10
percent — the University's costs are
going up substantially, and yet the
money they get from tuition and from
alumni and from corporations and foun
dations may not be expanding at that
rate."
Impasse
Packard holds that Stanford may be
reaching "something of an impasse" in

this area. He notes several growing ten
dencies on the part of contributors that
make the trustees job more difficult.
"Corporations," he said, "are no longer
giving as much as they used to except for
very specific purposes . . . many are giv
ing in different directions, and not so
heavily to private education." Some or
ganizations have gone so far as to make
contributions contingent upon the exis
tence of specific curriculum — the over
all changes have accentuated the pres
sure on members of the board.
Packard cited leasing of Stanford land
as a good example. "I don't think anyone
wants to develop it just to develop it,"he
said. "Nothing will look as good as the
pastoral view you had. But it is necessary
to pay the bills here albeit pay them sen
sibly — we must do this at a pace that ties
in with financial needs."
Most criticism
Most criticism of the trustees comes
when they deal with the issues "behind
those of greatest importance," those
things that "carry a lot of visibility . . .
whether or not we have a defensive con
tract, or the problems encountered
when Tom Jones was on the board
(Jones, a president of the Northrup Cor
poration, resigned as trustee when his
company was accused of having made
illegal contributions to Richard Nixon's
1972 re-election fund); problems like th
ese, and like the voting on the South
African issue." Packard feels that these
are certainly not things to be ignored,
but he nevertheless is apparently
pleased with most of what the trustees
have done, and are doing.
