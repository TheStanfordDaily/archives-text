# Marines watching their language

### 
San Diego (AP) — The Marine
Corps is watching its recruiters
closely to be sure they paint an
accurate picture to young,
would-be Marines.
The husky youngsters they try
to sign up must be told, a gen
eral says, that "we want you to
be a good Marine, to be willing
to expose yourself to life and
death situations."
At no time is a recruiter al
lowed to picture Marine life as
one of ease, pleasure and "se
eing strange and exotic parts of
the world."
The possibility of a congres
sional investigation of Marine
recruiting was raised recently by
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-
Ohio), after an 18-year-old re
portedly tried to kill himself in
the Marine Corps Recruit Depot
in San Diego.
Earlier, that youngster from
Cleveland complained about a
nervous condition but was still
signed up. Another 20-year-old
recruit who was too fat to do
basic exercises hid out for seven
weeks.
In early 1976, a San Diego re
cruit died after being pummeled
on the head in a special discipli
nary unit. He had been signed
up despite a police record and
history of mental problems.
As commander of the depot,
Maj. Gen. Richard Schulze over
sees the unit which turns out
about 1000 recruiters annually.
Schulze said in an interview
that he is concerned about re
cruiters showing too much zeal.
Honesty comes first, he says.
The school for Marine recruit
ers is using the latest techniques
developed by private industry
in order to sell what the Corps
regards as a unique career.
The manual warns that "under
no circumstances shall recruit
ing personnel picture Marine
Corps life as one of ease and
pleasure. Specific promises as to
duty stations and as to seeing
strange and exotic parts of the
world should not be made."
There will be no "questionable
advertising, false promises or

methods contrary to high
ethics," recruiters are warned.
Civilian specialists teach pub
lic speaking to the recruiter can
didates, and videotape cameras
are used as they speak to make
believe high school classes.
There is also a two-hour class in
ethics.
Maj. John Mentzer, who runs
the recruiting school, said the

pressure ot meeting recruiting
goals is being eased.
Apparently few of the
youngsters signing up think the
Marine Corps is "just another
employer." A questionnaire
asks them what they prefer —
travel and adventure or "self
reliance, self-direction and dis
cipline." Mentzer said the pre
ference is 95-5 for the latter.
