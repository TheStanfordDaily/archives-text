# DAILY INTERVIEW:
## NAT LEHRMAN 
### 
It's not remarkable that the senior vice president and
associate publisher of today's top men's entertainment
magazine reached his career climax by trying several
different positions along the way. What is notable,
however, is the fact that he's retained not only his wife,
but his sense of humor through it all.
Nat Lehrman's been married for 21 years and has
been with Playboy for 15 of it. He's undoubtedly
utilized his rare combination of intelligence, humor
and objectivity to work his way from an M.A. in English
and linguistics at New York University in 1960 to the
title of associate publisher of Playboy in 7976. Along the
way, Lehrman joined the army, became a travel writer
and editor for the Automobile Association, served as
editors of Relax, Dude and Gent magazines and ac
quired the position of editor of New Publications,
which he still holds today, with the Playboy organiza
tion. He was at the University Friday talking to particip
ants in the Stanford Publishing course. Lehrman was
interviewed for the Daily by Emilie Deutsch.
Daily: Do you ever feel you're doing something morally
wrong?
Lehrman: Absolutely not. I could probabaly talk 25 mi
nutes on that one. If anything, we're morally right.
We're probably the most moral magazine that's ever
existed.
Daily: The most moral?
Lehrman: We're a mass magazine, right? We reach mill
ions and millions of people and we actually take a
position on issues. Most magazines tend to reflect
society. We lead society. We give out opinions in the
Playboy Advisor and the Forum. I can't begin to tell you
the range of issues on which we've taken a position —
abortion, birth control, civil rights, the war in Vietnam.
We were one of the first publications to attack the war.
You can't name an issue of importance in society that
we haven't taken a liberal, libertarian or humanistic
position on.
Daily: But you appeal to conservative people.
Lehrman: Sexually conservative. If people are looking
for a real (explicit) shot, they're not going to find it in
Playboy. Our sexual morality is, I think, above criti
cism. We're not into exploitation.
Daily: But you get charged with that.
Lehrman: I know by people who don't read the
magazine.
Daily: How do you deal with the accusations?
Lehrman: Well, we deny them. None of it's true. The
basic accusation is that if you show a woman in a sexual
position without her clothes, you are therefore dis
criminating against her and treating her like an object.
The fact that you value the sexual qualities in a woman
doesn't mean you don't value her other qualities. The
people who attack us are usually people who are em

barrassed by the body. There's no doubt if you look at
the whole magazine, there's a combination of mind
and body.
Daily: Do you respect your models?
Lehrman: I respect my mother, I respect my wife, I
respect my daughter. Do we respect our models? We
respect them. We pay them a lot of money. We'll be
paying $25,000 for a woman to take off her clothes for
the 25th anniversary issue. Normally we pay $10,000.
That's good money for taking your clothes off in an
air-conditioned room for three days, right?
Daioy: Who do you think has the best job at Playboy?
Lehrman: Me . . . well, I suppose the answer should be
the photographer, right? The editors have great jobs
because they have a lot of freedom to do good work.
For anybody who wants to be an editor, there's no
better place than Playboy. It's a good environment.
The photographers have a lot of fun. I have a good job
because I'm the boss. And Hefner has a great job. He's
everybody's boss. Let's say Hefner.
Daily: How did you get involved in Playboy? Was that
one of your aspirations when you were young?
Lehrman: What's a nice Jewish boy like me doing in
Playboy, right? I got involved just the way careers head.
I went from one thing to another. Actually, I wanted to
be an associate publisher for The Nation so I could
reach 60,000 people who think the same way I do. Here
I'm reaching 6 million people — more than that —
who's minds I can help shape.
Daily: Do you think many of those minds are enrolled
in college?
Lehrman: It's difficult to keep track, but I think we have
a very high readership on campuses.
Daily: Is that one reason you're going to run the Pac-10
spread?
Lehrman: Well, I think other adults will be interested
too. It's all part of a theme. We did secretaries last
month. We're going to do cheerleaders. It adds a little
interest to the pictures.
Daily: What do you think of Stanford's participation in
the Pac-10 issue?
Lehrman: I think it's great. We're going to put you on
the map. We'll make you famous.
Daily: Does Playboy have any plans for an educational
publication?
Lehrman: I don't think we'll ever do anything for educa
tion. You have Stanford and Harvard and all those nice
places for education. There's an old line in show busi
ness — if you want to send a message, call Western
Union. Playboy is an entertainment magazine. We do a
lot of things that are educational, but you don't set out
to do an educational magazine with a commercial pub
lication.
Daily: How's your financial situation now as opposed
to several years ago?

Lehrman: It's better. We're in a turn-around situation.
We've been improving steadily for two years now.
Daily: To what can you attribute that improvement?
Lehrman: Well, they made me publisher of Playboy two
years ago. No, actually we hired a new president. We
went into a slump related to a lot of things such as an
attack on Hefner by legal authorities because of al
leged drug use. Things looked bad for awhile, but we
reorganized. The editors are kings in our organization.
There's a lot of competition to be a good editor.
Daily: Is there a lot of competition for your job?
Lehrman: For my job? I'm the first one who's ever had
it. I created the position.
Daily: What does your wife think about your involve
ment with Playboy?
Lehrman: She loves it. She goes to nice parties, I make a
nice income.
Daily: How about your competition? Who's your main
competitor?
Lehrman: Actually, we're going after Time, Sports Illus
trated and Newsweek. I don't want to cop out, though.
Penthouse is the key competition.
Daily: What do you think of Playgirl?
Lehrman: It serves a purpose. Shouldn't women have a
chance to look at male genitalia? I think when Playgirl
came out, women were into liberation. It was a big trip
to say "the men have their magazine, we want ours."
So they went out and bought it.
Daily: How about Hustler?
Lehrman: Can I get intellectual for a minute? A guy
named Stanley Fleischman who lives in California is a
brilliant lawyer who just wrote a paper about censor
ship laws. The gist of his paper was that the censorship
laws discriminate against less-educated people. In
other words, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce and people
like that always broke through the censorship barriers.
That's for people who go to college. But your average
blue-collar worker can't read that kind of stuff. So
along comes Hustler with the pretense of going to that
blue-collar worker and I don't think there's anything
wrong with that. It's edited for someone that has a
different taste.
Daily: Do you know Larry Flint?
Lehrman: Very well. He comes from the Bible Belt and
he probably has had a religious feeling in him ever
since he was young. At some point it came out. I didn't
communicate too much with him after his conversion.
Daily: Are you still holding all those wild parties at the
Chicago mansion?
Lehrman: The Chicago mansion closed down. But the
parties were straight from Hollywood in the 1920s —
music, dancing, pretty women, drinking. They were
boring.
Daily: Did you gof
Lehrman: I worked there. I had to go.
