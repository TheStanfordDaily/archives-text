## Photographer's exhibit 
### 
One year after her show of
portraits at Tresidder's Coffee
House Gallery, Ann Skinner-
Jones is exhibiting a series of
photographs taken in Japan, en
titled "Design Observed in Cul
ture." Based on the discipline of
visual anthropology, the show
documents the Japanese
people's use of tradition to
adapt to their newly indus
trialized environment. A
number of photographs concen
trate on the objects and cere
monies of daily life and are
grouped according to categories
of Tradition, Ritual, Design, and
Western Symbols. Another set
of photographs presents the
people themselves, busy at
some part of their daily routine.
A narrative text clarifies the
photographer's point of view. In
Ann Skinner-Jones' luminous
prints, the camera focuses on
both people and objects with in
timate involvement, yet with a
documentary directness.
In the following interview,
photographer Ann Skinner-
Jones discusses her reaction to
Japan and her particular ap
proach to visual anthropology.
EK: How did your involvement
with Japan begin?
ASJ: Nine years ago, when my

husband was in Vietnam, I first
travelled in Southeast Asia and
Japan, and it seemed to me then
that Japan was going to have a
strong influence on the Third
World countries, particularly
economically. But the involve
ment just happened to me. I
wanted to go back to Asia, and
so we started in Japan.
As anyone who has been there
will tell you, the more time you
spend in Japan, the more fas
cinating it gets. There's a certain
mystery there that's so different
from what we've grown up with
and know. And the more you
know, the more mysterious it
gets. It's especially the little tiny
things, like the things I photo
graphed, which are so fascinat
ing to me, as is all the ritual and
tradition.
EK: That fascination comes
through in your work. But so
does the care which you put into
developing a theme through
your organization.
ASJ: Doing the organization was
like doing a story board for a
movie script. It was not like
shooting the script, however,
because the photographs them
selves generated the exhibit. In
other words, I didn't shoot pic
tures in Japan according to a

preconceived idea. But after I
had all my film and contact
sheets made — and some of the
negatives dated from nine years
ago, before I ever knew I would
have an exhibit — the first step
was to inventory the contact
sheets, to sit down and write
what was in each shot.
In writing down what is in
each negative, you discover
what the content is and how you
see its significance. You can do
this process without making any
categories; in fact, at this stage,
categories will be subjective and
imposed. But you notice that
when you write down two col
umns, content and significance,
certain trends emerge, like
"tradition-ritual-renewal," or
"old age-youth-rejuvenation."
At this point, you can tabulate
your categories, and you'll see
that you have a preponderance
of material in certain areas. All of
a sudden, you ask yourself,
"What am I doing there?" In my
case, you could just read my
personality from the contact
sheets: you could see what I'm
interested in, and what I'm not
interested in. So for me, the
catergories developed from the
contact sheets, as I gave the
negatives a voice.


"Look at the objects and you'll see they have very human
characteristics. Look at the broom and the dustpan -
they're like an old couple."
