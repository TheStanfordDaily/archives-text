# chronicles life among the Japanese

EK: It seems to me that you suc
ceed as a documentary photo
grapher because you do more
than simply record: you make
compelling images which give a
sense of place, an impression, a
symbolic meaning.
AS): But I don't give them the
symbolism — the symbolism is
there and it's for me to interpret
it, or edit it. Look at the objects
in my photos and you'll see they
have very human characteristics.
Look at the broom and the
dustpan — they're like an old
couple. When you see these
things, there are no people visi
ble, but the people are
everywhere.
EK: Yes, the photographs focus
our attention on qualities which
are difficult to convey in words
alone.
AS|: That brings me to another
point I want to make. While
photographs present the qual
ifiers, in terms of my training as a
visual anthropologist, photo
graphs do nothing without the
analysis. There's a tremendous
amount of writing involved in
visual anthropology, and it was
important for me that the
analysis worked well with the
photos. What I wanted to do was
to pinpoint what was in the
photograph, but more than that,
to talk about the significance,
which is the key. In this respect
my show is not an exhibit of art
photos that people can react to
subjectively. The narrative is
what gives the continuity, the
thing that shows that I've re
flected on the culture.
EK: I noticed how much you are
attracted to the things in
Japanese cult'ure which are use
ful. The people you show are al
most always active, doing, work

ing. Was it conscious choice to
portray the people that way?
ASJ: I don't know how to distin
guish what was conscious
choice. All of my shooting was
on-the-street recording. As I was
walking and walking, my only
choice was to say, Yes, I want to
stop and take that picture. I was
simply attracted to that woman
or man working. Of course, I did
take a lot of pictures of people at
leisure, but the pictures of
people at work fit more with
what I was trying to say about the
core of Japanese culture.
In fact, I had to step back in
surprise later as I inventoried my
contact sheets and saw the story
it told about me and my in
terests. The discovery was excit
ing. If I go back again, my shots
will be much more consciously
chosen. In some way, though,
that worries me; I'm not sure I
really want to shoot that way,
since I want to develop some
confidence in my intuition, my
instinct.
EK: Was there ever a point when
you felt a conflict between the
demands of anthropology and
those of fine photography?
ASJ: Yes, sure. There are shots
with wonderful content that I
threw out because they didn't
have the kind of print quality I
want to exhibit. Even still, I feel I
was much freer this time than
when I was doing portraits.
EK: You seem to have such fine
rapport with the people you
photographed, I wonder how
you approached them. Do you
speak Japanese?
ASJ: I speak a few words. But
more important, I think the
people sensed that I was
genuinely interested in them,
and that I was not going to abuse

them. I wanted to be respectful
and I would not intrude. They're
very friendly, very open people.
Either I would spend a lot of time
in one area, so they could sense
my interest, or else I would get a
shot set up and say "Excuse me,
I'm sorry," and as they'd look
up, I'd take my picture. I would
then try to be very graceful and
grateful about it. At other times I
would approach and ask permis
sion to photograph. It really de
pended on where I was, and
whether it looked like my sub
ject was going to be gone in a
second! And non-verbal rapport
is very important.
EK: What was it like to be a
woman photographer in such a
male dominated society?
ASJ: That's very interesting. I
have felt that it makes it easier
for me. I think that the Japanese
see me, in some situations, as a
very strange being. I've been in
situations with Japanese people,
particularly businessmen, who
don't know how to deal with me,
because they're not accustomed
to someone with my forthright
manner. I think they get a kick
out of it. I obviously get a hit off
of it, and they can see that.
EK: I have a speculative question
for you. If a Japanese woman
came to the United States with a
camera and photographed in our
culture, would her results bear
some relationship to the work
you did in Japan?
ASJ: I doubt it — unless, of
course, the photographer was

an anthropologist. In general,
the things I shot aren't the kinds
of things the Japanese are in
terested in photographing. It's
been my impression that it's im
portant that they photograph
the places they've travelled, that
they have their pictures taken in
front of signs. As a matter of fact,
I have shown my photos to a
Japanese woman who doesn't
speak much English and she
laughed in embarrassment as if
to say, "Why would you want to
photograph that sort of thing?"
EK: How long have you been
working at photography?
ASJ: Seriously, three years.
About nine years ago I travelled
as a photo-journalist for a year,
just for the hell of it. That was for
my hometown paper, in Ander
son, Indiana — I'm a good old
Midwestern girl. But it's only
been recently that I've felt it be
come clear what I want to do. I
really want to get more and more
into photography. The real con
flict is how to make a living off of
it, to really do what you want to
do and not to prostitute your
self.
EK: How does your activity in
photography fit into the rest of
your life?
ASJ: I work three days a week as a
speech therapist to support my
interest in photography. When I
think back on this last semester
that I went through — working
three days a week and carrying
nine units and putting togethera
photo exhibit and being a

mother and taking care of this
house and Elizabeth — all I can
say is, there's a lot of drive there.
EK: What projects do you have in
store?
ASJ: I want to go back to school
for an MFA because there are
many things I want to do, and
that will give me some time to do
them. I also want to get funding
so I can go back to )apan be
cause I would like to publish this
project. And when I go back next
time I'd like to be a little more
abstract and try to evaluate if this
idea of categories is useful, or if
there's a better way to organize a
show. Perhaps I can use these
present categories and push
them farther.
As far as me personally, I
would like to do more work in
this nebulous area of visual an
thropology, but at the same time
I want to do some really far-out
stuff, like dream surrealism. I re
ally think I need to push to get a
little bit freer, because every
thing I do now is very precise.
Putting this show together was
an extremely disciplined and,
consequently, creative process.

analysis worked well with the
photos. What I wanted to do was
to pinpoint what was in the
photograph, but more than that,
to talk about the significance,
which is the key. In this respect
my show is not an exhibit of art
photos that people can react to
subjectively. The narrative is
what gives the continuity, the
thing that shows that I've re
flected on the culture.
EK: I noticed how much you are
attracted to the things in
Japanese cult'ure which are use
ful. The people you show are al
most always active, doing, work

ing. Was it conscious choice to
portray the people that way?
ASJ: I don't know how to distin
guish what was conscious
choice. All of my shooting was
on-the-street recording. As I was
walking and walking, my only
choice was to say, Yes, I want to
stop and take that picture. I was
simply attracted to that woman
or man working. Of course, I did
take a lot of pictures of people at
leisure, but the pictures of
people at work fit more with
what I was trying to say about the
core of Japanese culture.
In fact, I had to step back in
surprise later as I inventoried my
contact sheets and saw the story
it told about me and my in
terests. The discovery was excit
ing. If I go back again, my shots
will be much more consciously
chosen. In some way, though,
that worries me; I'm not sure I
really want to shoot that way,
since I want to develop some
confidence in my intuition, my
instinct.
EK: Was there ever a point when
you felt a conflict between the
demands of anthropology and
those of fine photography?
ASJ: Yes, sure. There are shots
with wonderful content that I
threw out because they didn't
have the kind of print quality I
want to exhibit. Even still, I feel I
was much freer this time than
when I was doing portraits.
EK: You seem to have such fine
rapport with the people you
photographed, I wonder how
you approached them. Do you
speak Japanese?
ASJ: I speak a few words. But
more important, I think the
people sensed that I was
genuinely interested in them,
and that I was not going to abuse

them. I wanted to be respectful
and I would not intrude. They're
very friendly, very open people.
Either I would spend a lot of time
in one area, so they could sense
my interest, or else I would get a
shot set up and say "Excuse me,
I'm sorry," and as they'd look
up, I'd take my picture. I would
then try to be very graceful and
grateful about it. At other times I
would approach and ask permis
sion to photograph. It really de
pended on where I was, and
whether it looked like my sub
ject was going to be gone in a
second! And non-verbal rapport
is very important.
EK: What was it like to be a
woman photographer in such a
male dominated society?
ASJ: That's very interesting. I
have felt that it makes it easier
for me. I think that the Japanese
see me, in some situations, as a
very strange being. I've been in
situations with Japanese people,
particularly businessmen, who
don't know how to deal with me,
because they're not accustomed
to someone with my forthright
manner. I think they get a kick
out of it. I obviously get a hit off
of it, and they can see that.
EK: I have a speculative question
for you. If a Japanese woman
came to the United States with a
camera and photographed in our
culture, would her results bear
some relationship to the work
you did in Japan?
ASJ: I doubt it — unless, of
course, the photographer was

an anthropologist. In general,
the things I shot aren't the kinds
of things the Japanese are in
terested in photographing. It's
been my impression that it's im
portant that they photograph
the places they've travelled, that
they have their pictures taken in
front of signs. As a matter of fact,
I have shown my photos to a
Japanese woman who doesn't
speak much English and she
laughed in embarrassment as if
to say, "Why would you want to
photograph that sort of thing?"
EK: How long have you been
working at photography?
ASJ: Seriously, three years.
About nine years ago I travelled
as a photo-journalist for a year,
just for the hell of it. That was for
my hometown paper, in Ander
son, Indiana — I'm a good old
Midwestern girl. But it's only
been recently that I've felt it be
come clear what I want to do. I
really want to get more and more
into photography. The real con
flict is how to make a living off of
it, to really do what you want to
do and not to prostitute your
self.
EK: How does your activity in
photography fit into the rest of
your life?
ASJ: I work three days a week as a
speech therapist to support my
interest in photography. When I
think back on this last semester
that I went through — working
three days a week and carrying
nine units and putting togethera
photo exhibit and being a

mother and taking care of this
house and Elizabeth — all I can
say is, there's a lot of drive there.
EK: What projects do you have in
store?
ASJ: I want to go back to school
for an MFA because there are
many things I want to do, and
that will give me some time to do
them. I also want to get funding
so I can go back to )apan be
cause I would like to publish this
project. And when I go back next
time I'd like to be a little more
abstract and try to evaluate if this
idea of categories is useful, or if
there's a better way to organize a
show. Perhaps I can use these
present categories and push
them farther.
As far as me personally, I
would like to do more work in
this nebulous area of visual an
thropology, but at the same time
I want to do some really far-out
stuff, like dream surrealism. I re
ally think I need to push to get a
little bit freer, because every
thing I do now is very precise.
Putting this show together was
an extremely disciplined and,
consequently, creative process.
(Japan: Design Observed in Cul
ture will continue at the Coffee
House Gallery through this
Saturday.)
EK: It seems to me that you suc
ceed as a documentary photo
grapher because you do more
than simply record: you make
compelling images which give a
sense of place, an impression, a
symbolic meaning.
AS): But I don't give them the
symbolism — the symbolism is
there and it's for me to interpret
it, or edit it. Look at the objects
in my photos and you'll see they
have very human characteristics.
Look at the broom and the
dustpan — they're like an old
couple. When you see these
things, there are no people visi
ble, but the people are
everywhere.
EK: Yes, the photographs focus
our attention on qualities which
are difficult to convey in words
alone.
AS|: That brings me to another
point I want to make. While
photographs present the qual
ifiers, in terms of my training as a
visual anthropologist, photo
graphs do nothing without the
analysis. There's a tremendous
amount of writing involved in
visual anthropology, and it was
important for me that the
analysis worked well with the
photos. What I wanted to do was
to pinpoint what was in the
photograph, but more than that,
to talk about the significance,
