Postal unions angry
Union officials for postal workers in the
key New York area, angry over firings by the
Postal Service, agreed Monday night to au
thorize a strike vote. Local president Moe
Biller said, "if New York votes to strike, the
rest of the country will follow."
The Postal Service had announced yes
terday the dismissal of 122 employees in
New Jersey and California who had taken
part in wildcat strikes to protest a new
nationwide contract proposal.
If the New York local votes to strike, a
nationwide strike could result — despite the
tentative contract settlement that averted a
nationwide strike early Friday morning.
Postmaster General William Bolger said
strikers who were dismissed "are involved
in illegal picketingand overactivities," and
could be subject to felony prosecutions.
Bolger said he would fire any other postal
workers who walked off the job.
The contract settlement between the
postal service and its four unions provides
for wage increases, including cost-of-living
benefits, totaling 19.5 percent over three
years. However, strikers complained that
high accident rates and mandatory overtime
requirements were not addressed, and that
the proposed contract did not recognize the
high cost of living in urban centers.
Brown asks rent rollback
San Francisco — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.,
speaking before a group that included angry
tenants with placards, had a few signs of his
own yesterday as he asked support for his
program to pass Proposition 13 savings back
to renters.
At a meeting with leaders of landlord
groups unexpectedly opened to the public,
Brown plugged his three-point program
which includes rolling back rents to May 31,
1978 levels, freezing rents at least through
the end of the year and landlords sharing
Proposition 13 net tax savings with their ten
ants.
"I would prefer a non-bureaucratic solu
tion as the first alternative," said Brown.
"But I will support legislation to accomplish
those goals if I can't do it otherwise."
Some of the signs greeting the governor
read: "Volunteer Plan another Sham,"
"Would You Trust Your Landlord," "Let's
Have Landlord Control," "Rent Rebate

Now" and "Renters Have Rights Too."
Howard Ruby, chairman of the California
Housing Council, said a rent crisis hotline
set up in Los Angeles Friday generated 1100
phone calls involving 600 to 700 landlords
and rollbacks have been pledged for 121,000
out of 400,000 units.
Prisoner uprising
Reidsville, Ga. — Georgia officials said
yesterday that a riot at the state prison here
may have been sparked by news accounts of
a deadly rampage one day earlier by inmates
in Pontiac, 111. Four guards and two inmates
died in the two uprisings.
The disturbance at Reidsville originally
was thought to have been another in a series
of tecent racially motivated disturbances
which have left two inmates dead and 30
others injured.
But Evans said the latest turmoil was diffe
rent because, "There were no demands, no
reasons given by any of the inmates. In the
past we have been able to pick up real quick
as to the reasons, causes and demands."
Yankee manager resigns
Kansas City — Billy Martin, weeping
openly arid with disappointment and grief,
resigned under pressure yesterday as man
ager of the New York Yankees and was im
mediately replaced by Bob Lemon.
Martin's resignation, which came after his
Sunday night tirade against team owner
George Steinbrenner, ended almost three
seasons of controversy.
"Billy needed to resign for health reasons
but I couldn't let any employee of the Yan
kees say things like that about the front of
fice," said Yankee President Al Rosen.
Although Martin denied making the slur
ring remarks, Rosen said, "I'm absolutely
satisfied that Billy made the comment."
Rose ties N.L. mark
New York — Pete Rose tied the modern
National League hitting streak record of 37
games yesterday with a seventh-inning
single against Pat Zachry.
Hitless in his first three at bats against the
right-hander, Rose came up with one out
in the seventh inning as the Shea Stadium
crowd of about 30,000 fans, including
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn gave the vete
ran Red star a standing ovation.

Partial debating agreement
Los Angeles — Agreement has been
reached on one of three issues blocking
agreement on televised debates this fall be
tween Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. and Attorney
General Evelle Younger, Brown's campaign
manager said yesterday.
Gray Davis, chief of the Democratic in
cumbent's campaign, said he and Ken Rietz,
the Republican candidate's campaign man
ager, agreed yesterday to allow broadcast of
all debates statewide by any radio or televi
sion station wishing to carry them.
Previously, Younger's representatives
had wished to restrict the debates to Public
Broadcasting System stations.
That left unresolved the questions of for
mat and content.
The Brown campaign wants a panel of re
porters to question the candidates with no
restrictions on topics in what Davis called
"the classic form of political debates in this
country." Younger's campaign wants a for
mal debate between the two candidates on
previously selected topics with a moderator
serving only as timekeeper.

could be subject to felony prosecutions.
Bolger said he would fire any other postal
workers who walked off the job.
The contract settlement between the
postal service and its four unions provides
for wage increases, including cost-of-living
benefits, totaling 19.5 percent over three
years. However, strikers complained that
high accident rates and mandatory overtime
requirements were not addressed, and that
the proposed contract did not recognize the
high cost of living in urban centers.
Brown asks rent rollback
San Francisco — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.,
speaking before a group that included angry
tenants with placards, had a few signs of his
own yesterday as he asked support for his
program to pass Proposition 13 savings back
to renters.
At a meeting with leaders of landlord
groups unexpectedly opened to the public,
Brown plugged his three-point program
which includes rolling back rents to May 31,
1978 levels, freezing rents at least through
the end of the year and landlords sharing
Proposition 13 net tax savings with their ten
ants.
"I would prefer a non-bureaucratic solu
tion as the first alternative," said Brown.
"But I will support legislation to accomplish
those goals if I can't do it otherwise."
Some of the signs greeting the governor
read: "Volunteer Plan another Sham,"
"Would You Trust Your Landlord," "Let's
Have Landlord Control," "Rent Rebate

Now" and "Renters Have Rights Too."
Howard Ruby, chairman of the California
Housing Council, said a rent crisis hotline
set up in Los Angeles Friday generated 1100
phone calls involving 600 to 700 landlords
and rollbacks have been pledged for 121,000
out of 400,000 units.
Prisoner uprising
Reidsville, Ga. — Georgia officials said
yesterday that a riot at the state prison here
may have been sparked by news accounts of
a deadly rampage one day earlier by inmates
in Pontiac, 111. Four guards and two inmates
died in the two uprisings.
The disturbance at Reidsville originally
was thought to have been another in a series
of tecent racially motivated disturbances
which have left two inmates dead and 30
others injured.
But Evans said the latest turmoil was diffe
rent because, "There were no demands, no
reasons given by any of the inmates. In the
past we have been able to pick up real quick
as to the reasons, causes and demands."
Yankee manager resigns
Kansas City — Billy Martin, weeping
openly arid with disappointment and grief,
resigned under pressure yesterday as man
ager of the New York Yankees and was im
mediately replaced by Bob Lemon.
Martin's resignation, which came after his
Sunday night tirade against team owner
George Steinbrenner, ended almost three
seasons of controversy.
"Billy needed to resign for health reasons
but I couldn't let any employee of the Yan
kees say things like that about the front of
fice," said Yankee President Al Rosen.
Although Martin denied making the slur
ring remarks, Rosen said, "I'm absolutely
satisfied that Billy made the comment."
Rose ties N.L. mark
New York — Pete Rose tied the modern
National League hitting streak record of 37
games yesterday with a seventh-inning
single against Pat Zachry.
Hitless in his first three at bats against the
right-hander, Rose came up with one out
in the seventh inning as the Shea Stadium
crowd of about 30,000 fans, including
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn gave the vete
ran Red star a standing ovation.

Partial debating agreement
Los Angeles — Agreement has been
reached on one of three issues blocking
agreement on televised debates this fall be
tween Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. and Attorney
General Evelle Younger, Brown's campaign
manager said yesterday.
Gray Davis, chief of the Democratic in
cumbent's campaign, said he and Ken Rietz,
the Republican candidate's campaign man
ager, agreed yesterday to allow broadcast of
all debates statewide by any radio or televi
sion station wishing to carry them.
Previously, Younger's representatives
had wished to restrict the debates to Public
Broadcasting System stations.
That left unresolved the questions of for
mat and content.
The Brown campaign wants a panel of re
porters to question the candidates with no
restrictions on topics in what Davis called
"the classic form of political debates in this
country." Younger's campaign wants a for
mal debate between the two candidates on
previously selected topics with a moderator
serving only as timekeeper.

Postal unions angry
Union officials for postal workers in the
key New York area, angry over firings by the
Postal Service, agreed Monday night to au
thorize a strike vote. Local president Moe
Biller said, "if New York votes to strike, the
rest of the country will follow."
The Postal Service had announced yes
terday the dismissal of 122 employees in
New Jersey and California who had taken
part in wildcat strikes to protest a new
nationwide contract proposal.
If the New York local votes to strike, a
nationwide strike could result — despite the
tentative contract settlement that averted a
nationwide strike early Friday morning.
Postmaster General William Bolger said
strikers who were dismissed "are involved
in illegal picketingand overactivities," and
could be subject to felony prosecutions.
Bolger said he would fire any other postal
workers who walked off the job.
