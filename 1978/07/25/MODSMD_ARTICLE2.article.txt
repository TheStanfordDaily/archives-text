# Dollar takes a beating abroad
## 
### 
Tokyo (AP) — For the first time
in post-war history, the dollar
closed below 200 Japanese yen
on foreign exchanges yesterday,
a psychological barrier whose
crossing worried both Japanese
businessmen and hard-pressed
Americans here.
Japanese government
economists said the U.S. cur
rency would probably bounce
back above 200 yen, but some
exchange dealers disagreed,
predicting it might continue to
plummet to about 180 yen in the
next few months.
At that point, Americans
would be shelling out $27 for a
restaurant meal that cost them
$17 just 19 months ago.
The dollar closed yesterday at
199.05 yen, down from 201.25
yen last Friday and 229 yen as
recently as late May. The dollar

also plunged against major
European currencies in early
trading — the British pound, for
example, was selling for
$1.92475, against $1.9121 Friday.
The fall below 200 yen came
despite stiff resistance from Ja
pan's central bank. Of the ex
tremely large spot trading total
of $900 million, the Bank of
Japan bought an estimated $400
million, most of it just above 200
yen per dollar. But even that
couldn't keep it from dipping
below 200.
Although widely expected,
the breaking of the 200 barrier
was the top item in Japanese
newspapers and news broad
casts, in which business leaders
expressed concern over the ef
fect on Japan's economic recov
ery.
The basic factors behind the
dollar's drop here remain Ja
pan's large trade surplus, which
produces a dollar surplus on the
Tokyo market, and inflation in
the United States.
The most immediate concrete
effect is on Americans who live
here or visit Japan:
— Without even considering
usual inflationary price rises, a
100-yen soft drink, for example,
has jumped from 34 to 50 cents
in dollar terms in the past 19
months, and from 44 to 50 cents
in the past two months.
— A 300,000-yen monthly rent,
which would have come to $1027
in January 1977 at 292 yen to the
dollar, and $1310 two months
ago at 229 yen, now will cost
$1507 at 199 yen.
— The national railway's
minimum tare of 60 yen has gone
from 21 cents to 2b cents to 30
cents. But the railway has just
raised the fare to 80 yen, so it
now costs 40 cents.

People were still lining up 15 minutes before closing time Sunday to see a copy of the Magna Carta, on
loan from England's Lincoln Cathedral. The document, displayed for four days, is one of four known
remaining originals out of 20 estimated to have been signed by King John in 1215. According to Hoover
Public Affairs Coordinator George Marotta, the display attracted well over 5000 visitors.
