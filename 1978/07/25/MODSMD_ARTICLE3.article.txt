# Antibiotics overused, less effective
## 
### Chris Tillotson 
Indiscriminate use of antibio
tics is creating serious implica
tions, one of which is their de
creased therapeutic effective
ness, according to Dr. Jack Re
mington, professor of medicine
at the School of Medicine and
chief of Allergy, Immunology
and Infectious Diseases at the
Palo Alto Medical Research
Foundation.
Remington stressed that, "un
less we can limit the prescribing
of antibiotics to their proper
uses, we will see increases in the
number of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria and in needless suffer
ing and death of patients in
fected with them."
In the period from 1967 to
1971, Remington said, prescrip

tions for antibiotics in the Un
ited States rose approximately 30
percent, whereas the number of
visits to doctors increased by
only 5 percent.
Remington said one major
reason for the increasing re
liance on antibiotics is that their
success in combating bacterial
diseases has overshadowed any
potentially negative effects.
Another factor in the increasing
use of antibiotics is their fre
quent prescription as a
safeguard in surgeries which run
a greater risk of post-operative
infection, according to Re
mington. "There are few cir
cumstances in which prophylac
tic (preventive) antibiotics are
warranted," he said. "Antibio
tics are no substitute for sterile

surgical technique."
Yet another reason for the
tremendous increase in the use
of antibiotics is pressure from
the patient to receive a prescrip
tion upon each visit to the physi
cian. Although Remington said
he does not condone this prac
tice, he noted that in many
cases, the patient relationship is
a difficult one.
On a busy day, he explained, it
is much easier for the physician
to prescribe an antibiotic to a pa
tient complaining of a sore
throat than to displease the pa
tient and wait for the full account
of lab analyses. Remington said
doctors must deal with people
who have no formal understand
ing of the profession and who
often believe that for complete

and rapid recovery a prescrip
tion is required.
The abuse of antibiotics is by
no means restricted to the Un
ited States, Remington said. It is
apparently an international
problem as well. Remington said
in certain European and South
American countries antibiotics
can be purchased without pre
scription. Careless practices of
this sort must be curtailed, for
they endanger populations of all
countries, he warned.
As an example, Remington
cited chloramphenical, the most
effective drug available against
typhoid. Outside the United
States, however, it is commonly
prescribed for minor infections
and in some cases can be bought
without prescription. In Mexico
in 1972, a new typhoid with resis
tance to chloramphenicol was
discovered. This new, virulent
strain has since been carried to
the United States.
Remington said he believes
that more responsibility must be
accepted by countries which
carelessly use antibiotics, be
cause in his opinion, relative to
these countries, United States
controls are stringent.
Causes
Perhaps one of the most in
teresting causes for the increase
in antibiotic prescriptions, Re
mington said, is pressure from
pharmaceutical companies.
Pharmaceuticals is a lucrative
business, with the larger com
panies dealing in many millions
of dollars per year. One out
come of this is keen competi
tion, and pharmaceutical com
panies sponsor large advertising
programs in order to convince
physicians that their product is
superior.
Although up to the present,
no serious dilemmas have oc
curred, the appearance of resis
tant bacterial strains is an omen
of the future. Unless the indis
criminate and widespread appli
cation of antibiotics is curtailed,
problems with diseases of grea
ter severity than those experi
enced to date will inevitably
arise, Remington said.
