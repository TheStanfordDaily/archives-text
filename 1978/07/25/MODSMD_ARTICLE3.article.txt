# Antibiotics overused, less effective

Indiscriminate use of antibio
tics is creating serious implica
tions, one of which is their de
creased therapeutic effective
ness, according to Dr. Jack Re
mington, professor of medicine
at the School of Medicine and
chief of Allergy, Immunology
and Infectious Diseases at the
Palo Alto Medical Research
Foundation.
Remington stressed that, "un
less we can limit the prescribing
of antibiotics to their proper
uses, we will see increases in the
number of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria and in needless suffer
ing and death of patients in
fected with them."
In the period from 1967 to
1971, Remington said, prescrip

tions for antibiotics in the Un
ited States rose approximately 30
percent, whereas the number of
visits to doctors increased by
only 5 percent.
Remington said one major
reason for the increasing re
liance on antibiotics is that their
success in combating bacterial
diseases has overshadowed any
potentially negative effects.
Another factor in the increasing
use of antibiotics is their fre
quent prescription as a
safeguard in surgeries which run
a greater risk of post-operative
infection, according to Re
mington. "There are few cir
cumstances in which prophylac
tic (preventive) antibiotics are
warranted," he said. "Antibio
tics are no substitute for sterile

surgical technique."
Yet another reason for the
tremendous increase in the use
of antibiotics is pressure from
the patient to receive a prescrip
tion upon each visit to the physi
cian. Although Remington said
he does not condone this prac
tice, he noted that in many
cases, the patient relationship is
a difficult one.
On a busy day, he explained, it
is much easier for the physician
to prescribe an antibiotic to a pa
tient complaining of a sore
throat than to displease the pa
tient and wait for the full account
of lab analyses. Remington said
doctors must deal with people
who have no formal understand
ing of the profession and who
often believe that for complete

and rapid recovery a prescrip
tion is required.
The abuse of antibiotics is by
no means restricted to the Un
ited States, Remington said. It is
apparently an international
problem as well. Remington said
in certain European and South
American countries antibiotics
can be purchased without pre
scription. Careless practices of
this sort must be curtailed, for
they endanger populations of all
countries, he warned.
As an example, Remington
cited chloramphenical, the most
effective drug available against
typhoid. Outside the United
States, however, it is commonly
prescribed for minor infections
and in some cases can be bought
