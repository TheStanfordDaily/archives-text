						rebuttal to 'Soviet justice'

Your editorial entitled Soviet
Justice 'Dailv, July 18» advised
against active measures bv the
United States in protest against
the current oppression of
Shcharansky, Ginzburg and
others. I believe vou misjudge
the set of values used by the
Soviet leaders in their actions.
These people are practical
politicians and not averse to
changing the partv line w hen the
price for a certain policy be
comes too high. Apart from an\
initial steps b> our government,
progress can be attained by in
formal pressures of various sorts
by the American people, e.g.,
boycotting the Moscow Olym
pics, or non-attendance by lead
ing intellectuals at international
conferences in the U.S.S.R.
Such actions demonstrate di
rectly the opinions of Ameri
cans, and the Soviet leaders
know that at some level of per
sistency and intensity, public
opinion in this country is often
translated into a plan for specific
government action, peaceful to
be sure, but possibly distasteful
to the Soviet government from,
say, an economic point of view .
It then becomes a matter of
trade-offs which is, I feel, the
way this type of problem needs
to be treated.
As for the effect on the SALT
talks, it is probably true that the
events of a given day may affect
the climate of these negotiations
temporarily, but will not really
influence basic Soviet posture.
Your advice against "rocking
the boat" while the delicate
SALT negotiations are going on
reminds one of the appease
ment policy practiced by British
Prime Minister Chamberlain to
ward Hitler in the late 19305,
even though we are not dealing
with barbarians as Chamberlain
was.
Nevertheless, you do not
make points by being a "nice
guy" in the hope that the other
side will then also be a nice guy
where human rights are con
cerned. Surely, many upper
middle-class Jews of Germany
learned that lesson when they
assumed that Hitler would relax
his persecution if they did not
engage in active protests.
That the matter is not strictly
an internal problem of any par
ticular country is implied by the

Helsinki agreement.
Many ot us in various walks of
lite have interacted in a cordial
and constructive way with Soviet
counterparts at international
events and on other occasions.
However, the persecution of
Russian dissidents constitutes a
cloud which darkens the climate
of American-Soviet friendship —
a situation of which the U.S.S.R.
government is surely aware by
now I believe that continued
steps by the American people
expressing their strong repudia
tion of the current violations of
human rights now taking place
in the U.S.S.R. are desirable.
Such action will help to remove
the cloud and lead to more har
monious relations between the
United States and U.S.S.R.
