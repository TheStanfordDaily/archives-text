# Protect laboratory animals' rights
## 
### 
Greg Larson

There are thousands of dogs,
cats, monkeys, rabbits, rats,
frogs, mice and other animals
being used in medical and be
havioral research projects at
Stanford. The specific benefits
of such research are too numer
ous to cite, but it can safely be
said that the well-being of hu
mans and animals in general has
improved as our knowledge has
expanded.
The negative aspects of animal
research, however, are equally
impressive. Nearly all of the
animals used in research are de
prived of some aspect of their
natural existence, and most are
"terminated" for the purpose of
the research that they have un
luckily become a part of.
From the outset of this edito
rial, I should make it clear that I
am not an anti-vivisectionist. In
most cases, the benefits of ani
mal research far outweigh its de
triments.
However, there are countless
numbers of animals here at Stan
ford which are being needlessly
tortured and sacrificed. It is all
too easy and common for a re
searcher (and all others who
work with research animals) to

become calloused and unsym
pathetic to the needs and rights
of the animals they are usingand
abusing.
What is necessary?
Ultimately, the problem be
comes one of trying to decide
what is necessary for research
and what is not. At what point
does a particular research pro
tocol become so cruel to the
animals involved that the re
search itself must be halted?
Should research funds be spent
on developing a sorely-needed
animal care and housing facility,
or should such money be used
to finance additional research
which might solve some medical
enigma?
Resolving conflicting
priorities such as these is a most
difficult enterprise. Fortunately,
much of the policy-making in
this regard has already been
mandated by state and federal
law, and by National Institutes of
Health and U.S. Department of
Agriculture regulations.
Stanford still has the respon
sibility, however, to ensure that
the animal research conducted
here meets or exceeds the
minimum requirements. Cur
rently. the Administrative Panel
on Laboratory Animal Care (AP
LAC) is charged with fulfilling
Stanford's obligations regarding
animal research.
Though designated an ad
ministrative panel, this commit
tee establishes policy to the ex
tent that the interpretation and
application of rules and regula
tions is a substantive, subjective
process.
Ironically, the membership of
AP-LAC consists of those verv

individuals which thecommittee
is supposed to oversee and es
tablish policy for. The seven re
searchers who serve on AP-LAC
cannot be deemed impartial ar
bitrators who decide between
conflicting priorities — each de
cision they make affects them
personally as they pursue their
own research.
Additionally, as noted before,
it is easy and common for those
who use animals to become har
dened to the effects of their re
search on those animals.
As an alternative to the current
composition of AP-LAC, I would
suggest that the committee's
membership consist of stu
dents, faculty from throughout
;he University, staff from Busi
ness and Finance and the Spon
sored Projects Office, and, at
most, two animal researchers
who have outstanding reputa
tions for high quality animal
care.
Such a committee would have
the information necessary for in
telligent decision-making, but
would be unbiased w hen choos
ing between differing funding
priorities and alternatives.
A year ago, another student
and I asked to become members
of AP-LAC. My interest stemmed
from my involvement as a
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, which the other stu
dent was doing a Human Biologv
honors thesis on the ethical is
sues of research with animals.
Request denied
Not only was our request for
membership denied by the
panel, but we were also refused
permission to attend any meet
ings as observers or to have ac-

cess to committee materials and
minutes. Subsequently, the
other student's honors thesis
sponsor, who was a member of
AP-LAC, told her to change her
thesis topic.
The above events are not re
counted here to cast aspersions
on the integrity or hard work of
the members of AP-LAC, but
only to drive home the poi nt that
change is needed in this com
mittee. The responsibility now
rests with the President s Office
to re-define the charge and
membership of AP-LAC. Onlv by
such action can the needs and
rights of both researchers and
research animals be trul\ ac
counted for.

There are thousands of dogs,
cats, monkeys, rabbits, rats,
frogs, mice and other animals
being used in medical and be
havioral research projects at
Stanford. The specific benefits
of such research are too numer
ous to cite, but it can safely be
said that the well-being of hu
mans and animals in general has
improved as our knowledge has
expanded.
The negative aspects of animal
research, however, are equally
impressive. Nearly all of the
animals used in research are de
prived of some aspect of their
natural existence, and most are
"terminated" for the purpose of
the research that they have un
luckily become a part of.
From the outset of this edito
rial, I should make it clear that I
am not an anti-vivisectionist. In
most cases, the benefits of ani
mal research far outweigh its de
triments.
However, there are countless
numbers of animals here at Stan
ford which are being needlessly
tortured and sacrificed. It is all
too easy and common for a re
searcher (and all others who
work with research animals) to

become calloused and unsym
pathetic to the needs and rights
of the animals they are usingand
abusing.
What is necessary?
Ultimately, the problem be
comes one of trying to decide
what is necessary for research
and what is not. At what point
does a particular research pro
tocol become so cruel to the
animals involved that the re
search itself must be halted?
Should research funds be spent
on developing a sorely-needed
animal care and housing facility,
or should such money be used
to finance additional research
which might solve some medical
enigma?
Resolving conflicting
priorities such as these is a most
difficult enterprise. Fortunately,
much of the policy-making in
this regard has already been
mandated by state and federal
law, and by National Institutes of
Health and U.S. Department of
Agriculture regulations.
Stanford still has the respon
sibility, however, to ensure that
the animal research conducted
here meets or exceeds the
minimum requirements. Cur
rently. the Administrative Panel
on Laboratory Animal Care (AP
LAC) is charged with fulfilling
Stanford's obligations regarding
animal research.
Though designated an ad
ministrative panel, this commit
tee establishes policy to the ex
tent that the interpretation and
application of rules and regula
tions is a substantive, subjective
process.
Ironically, the membership of
AP-LAC consists of those verv

individuals which thecommittee
is supposed to oversee and es
tablish policy for. The seven re
searchers who serve on AP-LAC
cannot be deemed impartial ar
bitrators who decide between
conflicting priorities — each de
cision they make affects them
personally as they pursue their
own research.
Additionally, as noted before,
it is easy and common for those
who use animals to become har
dened to the effects of their re
search on those animals.
As an alternative to the current
composition of AP-LAC, I would
suggest that the committee's
membership consist of stu
dents, faculty from throughout
;he University, staff from Busi
ness and Finance and the Spon
sored Projects Office, and, at
most, two animal researchers
who have outstanding reputa
tions for high quality animal
care.
Such a committee would have
the information necessary for in
telligent decision-making, but
would be unbiased w hen choos
ing between differing funding
priorities and alternatives.
A year ago, another student
and I asked to become members
of AP-LAC. My interest stemmed
from my involvement as a
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, which the other stu
dent was doing a Human Biologv
honors thesis on the ethical is
sues of research with animals.
