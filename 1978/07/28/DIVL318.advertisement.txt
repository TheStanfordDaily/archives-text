Lie down
and
be counted.
President Jtmmy Carter signed up 51 limes
In America, 3% of the people
give 100% of all the blood
that's freely donated
Which means that if only 1 %
more people—maybe you—
became donors, it would add
over thirty percent more blood
to America's voluntary blood
stream. Think of it!
But forget arithmetic. Just
concentrate on one word.
The word is Easy.
Giving blood is easy. You
hardly feel it (in fact, some peo
ple say they feel better physi
cally after a blood donation).
And, of course, everybody
feels better emotionally.
Because it's a great feeling
knowing your one easy blood
donation has helped up to live
other people to live.
So how about it, 1 % of
America? Are you going to lie
J down and be counted?
