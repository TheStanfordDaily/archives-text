# Med School-clinic liaison group created to serve mutual needs

A liaison committee between
the Medical School and the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic has formed
to further mutual interests in
medical care and education,
Med School Dean Dr. Clayton
Rich announced Wednesday.
The committee will consist of
four physicians from Stanford
and four from the Palo Alto Med

ical Clinic. "The committee will
serve as a mechanism to better
the relations (between Stanford
and the clinic) and to improve
and provide the best educa
tional training for medical stu
dents," said Rich.
Rich was surprised that a for
mal liaison committee had not
been organized in the past, in
view of the close relationship

between Stanford and the clinic.
The Palo Alto Medical Clinic is a
partnership or about 135 private
physicians. The doctors practice
a wide range of specialized
fields.
A large number of physicians
from the clinic, as well as many
other community doctors, teach
at Stanford, noted Rich. Furth
ermore, he said "that the clinic
hospitalizes its patients here at
Stanford . . . and clinic doctors
share activities with the Stanford
staff."
The clinic also provides for
educational opportunities by of
fering clerkships and training in
its offices. The benefit of this,
noted Rich, is that students learn
different ways to practice
medicine. He said he hopes that
the clinic will continue and in
crease its program.
Dr. George Janetos of the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic agreed with
Rich. Ultimately, he said, "the
idea is to basically maximize the
teaching resources of both the

clinic and the university." The
committee, he said, will improve

and the clinic so that teaching
facilities at both will be utilized

Rich said that the clinic and
Medical Center often differ in
policy and opinion. With a
liaison committee, not only will
teaching opportunities enhance
but staff interactions will im
prove. "Policies and problems
will be heard on a formal level"
and the center and clinic will
function with more organized
and efficient interaction.

national tour — rumored to be their final one — to the Bay Area. Mick's birthday was an extra reason for
merriment, which included every intoxicant known to man and some made specially for the Stones.
