# Lofton impresses Packer coaches

### 
Green Bay, Wis. (AP) — The
athlete the Green Bay Packers
think can be the National Foot
ball League's next great wide re
ceiver wasn't even the fastest
player on his high school team.
"I certainly wasn't recruited
by many colleges," James Lofton
said. "And I didn't realize until
after my junior year in college
that I had a chance to play pro
football. You could say I de
veloped late. I surprised my
self."
Lofton weighed only 160
pounds as a Los Angeles high
school senior, when he was bet
ter at track than at football. He
was timed in 4.65 seconds at 40
yards and could long jump 24
feet, but was clocked in a barely
competitive 10.2 seconds at 100
yards.
Today Lofton packs 190
pounds on a lithe 6-foot-3 frame,
has run the 100 in 9.3 seconds
and the 40 in 4.4, has high
jumped 6 feet, 10 inches and won
the long jump at 26 feet, 11% in
ches in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association outdoor
championships at Eugene, Ore.,
June 2.
Lofton also found time to
catch 53 passes for 931 yards and
12 touchdowns for Stanford's
football team last fall, and that
kind of athletic ability is why the
Packers made him the sixth
player chosen in the NFL draft of
collegiate players May 2. And
while training camp for rookies
and veterans is only in its first
week, Lofton has done nothing
to disappoint them.
"He's about as good as every
body thought," said Lew Car
penter, who coaches the Pac
kers' receivers. "He has excel
lent speed, good hands, he can
catch in a crowd and he's tough
mentally.
"He can help immensely right
now, and the best thing about
him is he's far from fully de
veloped because he always
skipped spring practice at Stan
ford to go out for track," Car
penter said. "A lot of receivers
who are first round draft choices

are great when they come into
the league, but never improve. I
think James will get 50 percent
better than he is right now."
Lofton, a quarterback and
safety in high school, went to
Stanford because it was one of
the few schools which would
allow him to compete in both
football and track.
"When I was in high school, I
just wanted to see if I was good
enough to play college football,
that and do well in school," Lof
ton said. "I didn't start at Stan
ford until my senior year, so I
expect to improve a lot, even as
this season goes along.
"It doesn't seem to be much
different here than in college,
except for the terminology," he
said. "I'm comfortable in this
camp, and that should help me
improve. I'm fortunate in that
my college coach, Bill Walsh,
has a pro background from
being an assistant at Cincinnati
and San Diego."
Other Packer receivers are
fully aware of the new dimen
sions Lofton could add to the
team's passing game. One is
Steve Odom, who led the club
with 441 yards receiving last year
but who never has been able to
fully exploit his exceptional
speed because of the Packers'
lack of a complementary deep
threat.
"We've just had a few work
outs, but I can see it in Lofton,"
Odom said. "He can run, and I
have to like that. He can take a
lot of pressure off if we can go
deep on both sides of the field.
"It depends on the respect he
gets, and usually rookies have to
earn respect, but I think he can
do that in the preseason," he
said. "Some guys are burners,
but don't know how to use their
speed. He seems to have it all
together.

sions Lofton could add to the
team's passing game. One is
Steve Odom, who led the club
with 441 yards receiving last year
but who never has been able to
fully exploit his exceptional
speed because of the Packers'
lack of a complementary deep
threat.
"We've just had a few work
outs, but I can see it in Lofton,"
Odom said. "He can run, and I
have to like that. He can take a
lot of pressure off if we can go
deep on both sides of the field.
"It depends on the respect he
gets, and usually rookies have to
earn respect, but I think he can
do that in the preseason," he
said. "Some guys are burners,
but don't know how to use their
speed. He seems to have it all
together.
