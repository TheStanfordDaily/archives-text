# ’Test tube baby' doing well

London (AP) — Louise Brown, the world's first
authenticated "test tube baby," was moved from
a special care unit in a British hospital yesterday to
join her mother in the maternity ward after heal
thily crying her lungs out all night.
While hospital officials reported Lesley Brown,
30, and her two-day-old daughter were both
doing well, the two doctors responsible for the
laboratory conception cautioned other infertile
women against immediately pinning their hopes
on what is being hailed as a major medical break
through.
Physiologist Robert Edwards, who also helped
pioneer the first authenticated birth from a con
ception outside the womb, added: "We havea lot
to learn."
But up to 5000 women reportedly have sought
help from the two specialists and other scientists
working on similar experiments.
Published estimates suggest that in Britain
there could be some 10,000 women with blocked
Fallopian tubes — the problem that prevented
Mrs. Brown from conceiving in the normal way.
The Steptoe-Edwards technique was to remove

an egg from Mrs. Brown, fertilize it in a laboratory
dish with sperm from her husband and implant
the dividing cell into her uterus where it de
veloped normally.
Brown and her truck driver husband Johnny,
meanwhile, became the center of controversy
over a British government film of the historic birth
of their chubby cheeked, blond-haired 5-pound
12-ounce baby.
The Browns, bound by a $600,000 contract giv
ing exclusive rights for their story to the London
Daily Mail newspaper, refused permission to
allow television viewers to see a Central Office of
Information film for 28 days.
Some government ministers, noting that Brown
is and has been cared for free under the state-run
National Health Service, were annoyed at her at
titude.
A Health Department statement said the film of
the Caesarean birth was made "for the purpose of
assisting in the evaluation of the behavior of the
baby at birth and to provide an historic medical
record."
