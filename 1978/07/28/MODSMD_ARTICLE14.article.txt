# Transcendental meditation
## Exploring the mind — the final frontier 
### Donna DePue 
While the majority of students are taking their vaca
tions away from Stanford, a number of Bay Area people
are coming here for relaxation. What they are hoping
to achieve is a deep rest for their nervous system and a
strengthening of mind/body coordination.
These people are students at the courses of the TM-
Sidhi program being taught at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house from now until September 9.
Peter Stemper, course instructor, stated, "What we
are trying to gain is the simplest state of awareness. We
want to fine tune our physiology and neutralize
stress."
Transcendental meditation teaches one to transcend
to a level of total relaxation yet remain in a state of
awareness. Teachers of TM claim it is simple and effort
less, requiring no focusing or concentrating and is a
totally natural process. It is practiced twice a day, 20
minutes in the morning after arising and 20 minutes in
the evening.
The process rests the body, clears the mind and
allows the individual to emerge renewed and re
freshed. "It relieves stress," stated Lorna Thomas,
course instructor, "which is an overshadow of the
nervous system and disallows us to remain stable.

Sleep relieves some stress but for a person who is
under pressure for a long amount of time sleep may
not relieve the deep strain stress creates on the body.
After practicing the TM technique sleep is generally
more restful and refreshing."
Athletes benefit
The technique has lost some of its mysticism in the
last decade partly from devotees such as the Beatles,
but also from scientific documentation of its benefits.
Meditation has also been successfully introduced into
the field of athletics with increased performances re
ported by such athletes as ]oe Namath and ex-derby
champ Tim Englert.
The TM-Sidhi program is designed to enliven the
transcendental field of consciousness. The program is
divided into two phases. Phase I, a series of one week
preparatory courses, teaches students to deepen their
experiences during the practice of the TM technique;
to quickly develop the full value of consciousness as
the field of all possibilities. This is achieved through
group meeting with videotape instructions from
Maharishi and other teachers and through very struc
tured individual meditation.
Phase 11, a series of longer residence courses, has
emphasisis on enlivening the consciousness as a field

of all possibilities to enable the individual to fulfill all
his desires and live harmoniously with his environ
ment.
Absolute level
Stemper states, "Its purpose is to reach the absolute
state of creation, to achieve the vacuum state of
physics from which all creativity arises. This level of
consciousness is the home of all laws of nature. All
energy forces arise from this level and once trans
cended to, the purpose of evolution — for man to
become enlightened — can be achieved."
Stanford has-been the site for Phase I of the program
courses forthe last two years. The quiet and tranquility
of the campus during the summer alone with the av
ailability of a dormitory for eating and sleeping lends
itself as an ideal location for the teaching of the
courses. Another factor is Stanford's convenience to
the local center, located in the Mayfield Building at 399
Sherman Avenue in Palo Alto.
All persons interested in the TM-Sidhi program must
have first practiced the TM technique regularly for at
least six months, attended a weekend residence
course and been checked and recommended by the
local center. Introductory lectures on the TM
technique are given at the center on Wednesdays at
12:15 p.m. and 7 p.m.
