Chicago (AP) — Beneath their
one-piece swimsuits, many
beauty queens have less than
meets the eye, says a man who
has fit suits for dozens of Miss
America contestants.
"Eighty percent of those I've
fitted don't have enough top and
need help — the bosoms are
faked up a little bit," said Morris
Creenblatt, who can make a
good body look great in doc
tored bathing suits.
Creenblatt, a small, greying
man of 68 who owns Fashionette
Swimsuit World, has 10,000
swimming suits in about 200 var
ieties in stock at his store. Many
are of his own design.
"I've had three winners in that
class of judging in the last five
years," he said. "But in all my
years, I'veonly seensixgirlswith
what I would call perfect bodies
and none of them were contes
tants. They just came in off the

street to buy a swim suit. A per
fect body to me is one that fits
into any swim suit."
Creenblatt has suits with hal
ters, "T" backs, criss-crosses
and high backs. Color schemes
and designs are rampant. All are
meshed by Creenblatt to bring
out the best and diminish the
worst of a body.
There also are foam rubber
breast "shells" and angle pads,
and built-in fiber fillers to create
cleavage.
"For the last two years these
have been legal to wear in Miss
America contests," said
Greenblatt, who is divorced. "A
good bosom is the first thing
needed for a contestant to ba
lance herself. When she comes
to me, I ask her height, weight
and cup size — and from that I
know from experience the swim
suit for her. Usually, the first one
she tries on is it."
