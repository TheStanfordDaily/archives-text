Washington (AP) — The House
Ways and Means Committee
approved yesterday a $16.2-
billion tax-cut bill that includes a
new tax break for persons who
sell their homes and a sharp re
duction in the tax on capital
gains.
The bill bears little re
semblance to the measure re
commended by President )immy
Carter, who has vigorously op
posed the capital-gains cut.
The measure was approved on
a 25-12 vote. A bare majority of
the 25 committee Democrats
joined all 12 Republicans in en
dorsing the compromise, which
was written principally by Rep.
James Jones (D-Okla.).
House debate on the bill is ex
pected the week of Aug. 7.
Typical cuts
The Joint Committee on Taxa
tion calculates that the bill
would result in a $15 tax cut in
1979 for a typical single person
who earns $10,000 a year and has
itemized deductions of 23 per
cent of income.
A $15,000-a-year single person
would get a $71 tax cut; a $25,000
single, a $160 cut. A couple with
no children would average a $39
cut at the $10,000 level, $6 at the
$15,000 level and $160 at the
$25,000 level.
A couple with two children at
the $10,000 level would get a $62
cut; $77 at the $15,000 level and
$232 at $25,000.

Key parts of the bill would:
— Widen individual income
tax brackets to help offset the
effects of inflation and reduce
some individual tax rates.
— Increase the $2200 standard
deduction for single persons
and the $3200 standard deduc
tion for joint returns to $2300
