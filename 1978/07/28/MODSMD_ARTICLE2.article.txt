# House committee approves tax cut
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The House
Ways and Means Committee
approved yesterday a $16.2-
billion tax-cut bill that includes a
new tax break for persons who
sell their homes and a sharp re
duction in the tax on capital
gains.
The bill bears little re
semblance to the measure re
commended by President )immy
Carter, who has vigorously op
posed the capital-gains cut.
The measure was approved on
a 25-12 vote. A bare majority of
the 25 committee Democrats
joined all 12 Republicans in en
dorsing the compromise, which
was written principally by Rep.
James Jones (D-Okla.).
House debate on the bill is ex
pected the week of Aug. 7.
Typical cuts
The Joint Committee on Taxa
tion calculates that the bill
would result in a $15 tax cut in
1979 for a typical single person
who earns $10,000 a year and has
itemized deductions of 23 per
cent of income.
A $15,000-a-year single person
would get a $71 tax cut; a $25,000
single, a $160 cut. A couple with
no children would average a $39
cut at the $10,000 level, $6 at the
$15,000 level and $160 at the
$25,000 level.
A couple with two children at
the $10,000 level would get a $62
cut; $77 at the $15,000 level and
$232 at $25,000.

Key parts of the bill would:
— Widen individual income
tax brackets to help offset the
effects of inflation and reduce
some individual tax rates.
— Increase the $2200 standard
deduction for single persons
and the $3200 standard deduc
tion for joint returns to $2300
and $3400.
— Repeal the existing $35-
per-person tax credit and raise
the current $750-per-person
exemption to $1000.
— Repeal the current deduc
tion allowed for state and local
gasoline taxes and tighten the
deduction allowed for medical
expenses.
— Reduce taxes on corporate
income by about $3.5 billion, by
cutting tax rates and liberalizing
the investment tax credit.
— Exempt from taxation the
first $100,000 worth of profit that
is realized when a person's prin
cipal home, owned and oc
cupied for two years or more, is
sold.
— Reduce from about 49.1
percent to about 35 percent the
theoretical maximum tax on cap
ital gains, which are profits from
the sale of assets, such as land
and stocks, that were owned for
a year or more. Virtually all the
$1.2 billion of benefits would go
to high-income Americans.
— Create a new "alternative
tax" aimed at ensuring that weal
thy persons who realize large
capital gains will pay at least
some tax.
A person could take advan
tage of the new tax break for
homeowners only once in a
lifetime.
Two-thirds of the tax reduc
tion, costing about $750million a
year, would go to persons with
annual incomes of $15,000 to
$50,000. Those earning $30,000
to $50,000 would get about one
third of the benefit. The remain
ing one-third would go to per
sons earning less than $15,0CK) or
over $50,000.
