## rock/stephen brown Stones celebrate in Oakland 
### 
The Rolling Stones held the last concert of their
American tour before 64,000 people who packed
themselves into the Oakland Coliseum Wednes
day — the day Mick Jagger turned 34. The seated
crowd endured, more or less peacefully, a 2Vi
hour break that preceded the Stones' theatrical
arrival, while those on the green busied them
selves by jockeying for position on the already
jammed field. A female trapeze artist mollified
some of the short-tempered members of those on
the green midway through the wait. Anxious fans
tried to hurry Karl Winn on his tight-wire walk 160
feet above the stage in tricky winds just prior to
the Stones' appearance.
As thousands of red balloons sailed out of the
stadium and helicopters poured ping-pong balls
and naked-lady balloons onto the sea of scream
ing fans, the band dashed onto the stage and
launched into "Honky Tonk Woman." During the
next hour and 45 minutes, the cheering, singing,
clapping crowd watched the Stones play 19 num
bers. The first and last portions of the set were
composed of well-known songs such as "Brown
Sugar," "Tumblin' Dice" and "Jumping Jack
Flash" (they closed with that), whereas the songs
from their most recent LP, "Some Girls" (which is
climbing the charts at a phenomenally fast rate),
formed the middle part of the program. Of the
latter, "Miss You," "Lies" and "Respectable"
drew particularly enthused responses from the
fans.
Subdued attire
Onstage, Jagger, as usual, provided the
dominating force. Dressed in shining orange
pants, lavender T-shirt, silver vest, white jacket,
pink socks and white shoes, Jagger ran, twitched,
pranced, thrusted, pointed, and taunted all over
the stage between the glistening red lips and be
neath the white teeth of the enormous mouth that
has long been the trademark of the Rolling
Stones.
He elicited desired responses from the crowd
as if he were a conductor and the audience were a
symphony. He emptied a bucket of water on him
self, stripped to his trousers, threw his shoes to
the crowd, ventured to the edges of the stage
where he would sometimes jump down a step
toward the outstretched arms of the crowd (an
unobtrusive bodyguard behind him, mind you),
and scaled the scaffolding to dance in front of a

blasting speaker half again as tall and five times as
wide as he. However, although his cool disdain —
which permitted him to appear oblivious of ob
jects thrown in his direction — and his uncanny
power to conduct a crowd remain, his energy
level has diminished. Keith Richards, who
seemed calm and cool, and Ron Wood, who re
cently replaced Mick Taylor, played a greater part
in the theatrics onstage than they used to.
Fever rock
The music itself is the same brand of feverish
rock and roll that brought the Stones to fame 14
years ago. Surprisingly, Jagger often added
rhythm guitar to the sounds of the other two
guitarists, and he played the piano in "Far Away
byes," from "Some Girls." Ron Wood, bedecked
in crimson, provided most of the guitar solos, and
Charlie Watts appeared, as always, contented and
in a world of his own with his drums. Watts re
minds one of a benevolent dictator as he alter
nately coaxed gentle beats and brought forth re
sounding rhythms from his drums. He was always
in full control and never too loud or overbearing,
so he provided a pleasing compliment to Jagger.
When Jagger defiantly strutted in front of him,
Watts only smiled, whereas Richards and Wood
invariably accepted the challenges in well
choreographed confrontations in which Jagger
all but once triumphed.
The Stones played one encore, "Satisfaction,"
before disappearing as fireworks and multico
lored smokebombs discharged and British and
American flags floated down from the sky on
parachutes. The crowd was very responsive, but
the crazed, clamoring fans who used to greet the
Stones were not in Oakland yesterday. There
were drugs, an assortment of costumes and occa
sionally a lack of costume, but the thirtyish fans
who had grown up with the Stones were not
there.
Santana played for an enjoyable hour and 15
minutes. Their refreshing looseness and lack of
pretension were particularly welcome. Eddie
Money preceded them with his hits "Ticket to
Paradise" and "Baby Hold On to Me," some good
moves on stage, some inane comments and a
too-brassy band. Peter Tosh, who is with Rolling
Stones Records, opened the day's entertainment
with reggae.rock that was generally repetitive and
occasionally trite.

feet above the stage in tricky winds just prior to
the Stones' appearance.
As thousands of red balloons sailed out of the
stadium and helicopters poured ping-pong balls
and naked-lady balloons onto the sea of scream
ing fans, the band dashed onto the stage and
launched into "Honky Tonk Woman." During the
next hour and 45 minutes, the cheering, singing,
clapping crowd watched the Stones play 19 num
bers. The first and last portions of the set were
composed of well-known songs such as "Brown
Sugar," "Tumblin' Dice" and "Jumping Jack
Flash" (they closed with that), whereas the songs
from their most recent LP, "Some Girls" (which is
climbing the charts at a phenomenally fast rate),
formed the middle part of the program. Of the
latter, "Miss You," "Lies" and "Respectable"
drew particularly enthused responses from the
fans.
Subdued attire
Onstage, Jagger, as usual, provided the
dominating force. Dressed in shining orange
pants, lavender T-shirt, silver vest, white jacket,
pink socks and white shoes, Jagger ran, twitched,
pranced, thrusted, pointed, and taunted all over
the stage between the glistening red lips and be
neath the white teeth of the enormous mouth that
has long been the trademark of the Rolling
Stones.
He elicited desired responses from the crowd
as if he were a conductor and the audience were a
symphony. He emptied a bucket of water on him
self, stripped to his trousers, threw his shoes to
the crowd, ventured to the edges of the stage
where he would sometimes jump down a step
toward the outstretched arms of the crowd (an
unobtrusive bodyguard behind him, mind you),
and scaled the scaffolding to dance in front of a

blasting speaker half again as tall and five times as
wide as he. However, although his cool disdain —
which permitted him to appear oblivious of ob
jects thrown in his direction — and his uncanny
power to conduct a crowd remain, his energy
level has diminished. Keith Richards, who
seemed calm and cool, and Ron Wood, who re
cently replaced Mick Taylor, played a greater part
in the theatrics onstage than they used to.
Fever rock
The music itself is the same brand of feverish
rock and roll that brought the Stones to fame 14
years ago. Surprisingly, Jagger often added
rhythm guitar to the sounds of the other two
guitarists, and he played the piano in "Far Away
byes," from "Some Girls." Ron Wood, bedecked
in crimson, provided most of the guitar solos, and
Charlie Watts appeared, as always, contented and
in a world of his own with his drums. Watts re
minds one of a benevolent dictator as he alter
nately coaxed gentle beats and brought forth re
sounding rhythms from his drums. He was always
in full control and never too loud or overbearing,
so he provided a pleasing compliment to Jagger.
When Jagger defiantly strutted in front of him,
Watts only smiled, whereas Richards and Wood
invariably accepted the challenges in well
choreographed confrontations in which Jagger
all but once triumphed.
The Stones played one encore, "Satisfaction,"
before disappearing as fireworks and multico
lored smokebombs discharged and British and
American flags floated down from the sky on
parachutes. The crowd was very responsive, but
the crazed, clamoring fans who used to greet the
Stones were not in Oakland yesterday. There
were drugs, an assortment of costumes and occa
sionally a lack of costume, but the thirtyish fans
who had grown up with the Stones were not
there.
Santana played for an enjoyable hour and 15
minutes. Their refreshing looseness and lack of
pretension were particularly welcome. Eddie
Money preceded them with his hits "Ticket to
Paradise" and "Baby Hold On to Me," some good
moves on stage, some inane comments and a
too-brassy band. Peter Tosh, who is with Rolling
Stones Records, opened the day's entertainment
with reggae.rock that was generally repetitive and
occasionally trite.
