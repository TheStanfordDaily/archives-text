# Summer fairy tale
## 
### 
Ron Davies, a third-year doc
toral student in drama, will di
rect the Drama Department's
summer production of Ceorg
Buchner's "Leonce and Lena."
Inspired in part by Shakes
peare's romantic comedies, the
play uses all of the elements of a
traditional fairy-tale but places
them in a slightly ironic perspec
tive, using conventions to
parody conventions.
Buchner's fame as a dramatist
stems chiefly from his powerful
first play, "Danton's Death,"
and his unfinished masterpiece,
"Woyzeck." The least known of
his three plays, "Leonce and
Lena" was written for a competi
tion offering a prize for the best
German comedy. It reached the
judges a few days after the dead
line and was returned un
opened.
The critical appreciation of
Buchner's genius had to wait for
50 years after his untimely death
in 1837 at the age of 23. Gradually
his works began to have some
popularity in Germany, espe
cially the productions staged by

Max Reinhardt after the turn of
the century and the operatic ver
sion of "Woyzeck" composed
by Alban Berg in 1921.
Buchner's influence can be
detected in almost every 20th
century theater movement from
Expressionism to the Epic Thea
ter of Bertolt Brecht to the mod
ern Theater of the Absurd.
The story line of "Leonce and
Lena," although entirely con
ventional and lighthearted on
the surface, includes many of
the same themes that occur in
Buchner's other two plays: the
precariousness of identity, the
frailty of the human condition
and the difficulty of communica
tion. It is the "fairy-tale" veneer
and the more serious content
that provide the challenge for di
rector Davies.
"Leonce and Lena" will be
performed in the Nitery Theater
located in a wing of the Old
Union on campus August 2-5
and 9-12. Tickets will be on sale
at the door for $1. Curtain is at 8
p.m.
