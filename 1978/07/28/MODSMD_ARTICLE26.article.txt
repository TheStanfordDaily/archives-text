## Kirk's last: first-rate jazz 
### 
In many ways Rahsaan Roland
Kirk was the most versatile musi
cian of modern jazz history. Dur
ing the brief 39 years of his lite,
he was known to play tenor sax,
flute, clarinet, manzello, stritch,
harmonium, piccolo, black mys
tery pipes, nose flute and a host
of other diverse instruments.
Frequently he would astound
audiences by playing several at
once.
Yet Kirk was more than a mus
ical oddity. He played each in
strument with a virtuosityand in
tensity that would transcend the
gimmicks and antics he often re
sorted to. He was the first to un
seat Benny Goodman from the
number one clarinet position in
the prestigious Downbeat poll,
and he would frequently place
high in other categories.
Kirk passed away earlier this
year. He suffered a stroke two
years ago which paralyzed his
entire left side. But he continued
performing, playing more with
one hand than most could play
with two. Kirk also suffered from
blindness, yet he benefited from
that added musical acuity that so
many blind musicians exhibit.
Atlantic records has gathered
together a greatest hits album
which forces one to accept Kirk
as one of the outstanding reed
players of our time. Whatever
one thought of the gimmicks
and stunts, one must admit that

Kirk was an amazing musician.
At jam sessions he would take on
and defeat the most ac
complished musicians. One
only has to listen to Mingus'
"Town Hall" album to hear Kirk
completely outshine some of
the best names in the jazz world.
Similarly, at one of the all-star
jams at last year's Newport festi
val, Kirk played a one-handed
solo which highlighted the
show.
On the Atlantic album, enti
tled "The Vibration Continues,"
Kirk is particularly outstanding
on "Lush Life" and "If I Loved
You." He makes his tenor sax
sing with that full rich sound that
has, for some reason, disap
peared during the last decade.
The collection leaves out some

of Kirk's finest work, particularly
from the out-of-print "Bright
Moments" session, and the out
standing "Three Sided Dream"
album of a few years ago.
Despite these problems, the
album still offers a great deal of
first-rate music. It's rumored
that Atlantic has a live session in
the can awaiting release. Hope
fully this is true. Kirk was an en
gaging live player who would
reach his greatest heights in
front of audiences. His passing
was a serious blow to jazz; even
more depressing is the apparent
lack of tenor giants to take his
place. Surely none of the newer
tenors have any of the depth and
versatility which came through
on every Kirk album and in every
performance.

'Saturday Night Live' alum Chevy Chase has moved to Hollywood
and become a dashing leading man. In "Foul Play," he makes his
movie debut as a quicK-witted police officer who comes to Goldie
Hawn's rescue. The Daily will pass judgment on this latest release
from Paramount some time next week. You can see it yourself at the
Palo Alto Square.
