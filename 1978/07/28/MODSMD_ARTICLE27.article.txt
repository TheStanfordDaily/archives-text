Two Women ★★★★
New Varsity
Thursday |uly 27, Friday |uly 28
Probably Loren's best picture
thanks to Vittorio deSica. She is an
Italian mother who is trying to protect
herself and her 12 year old daughter
during the denouement of WWII,
when a war that began with shiny
boots and high ideals has become a
dusty votex of cruelty, fear, despera
tion and survival. Loren and daughter
try to avoid the entire mess; the"
herdlike cowardice of the ignorant
peasants, the vindictive brutality of
the retreating Nazis, and the coarse
barbarism of the Allies who are less
intent on Liberation as they are on the
lawless privileges of the victorious.
Inevitably the mother is unable to
shield her child's innocence and Must
cope with the youngster's transtorma
tion into a survivalistic woman thing
who rejects dolls and flowers for
black-market chocolates and nylon
stockings. Playing with "A Special
Day."
—Vincent Warren
The Longest Yard ★★
Sunday Flicks, Memorial Auditorium
A great flick for all the "sports as a
microcosm of life" fans. After a scan
dal stained career as a football super
star and an abortive stint as a super
stud, Burt Reynolds lands in jail. There
he learns the true meaning of "pride,
integrity and guts" among the semi
retired thieves, murderers and
sodomists he agrees to turn into a
football team for the titanic show

down with the guards (boo). A lot of
good he-man laughs and macho
morality. The muscle-bound message
of the film is that no matter what kind
of life a man has led, be he cutthroat,
cheat or child-molester, he is exhalted
and uplifted when he passes through
the purifying flame of sweaty compet
ition into the halls of true Manhood.
All Praise to Rockne! (The Longest
yard is really the distance to the lobby
where one may laugh without fear of
reprisal from the football camp jocksa
row or two back.)

Madame Rosa ★ ★ # ★
Aquarius
lust what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy on
the pathos. Simone Signoret makes
the film worthwhile with her perfor
mance as an aging whore — she easily
overcomes the occasionally dumb
dialogue, and often provides humor
at unexpected moments. It is, unfor
tunately, one of them foreign things,
but it kinda makes me wish that I had
never dropped French 10. With "Dear
Detective."
— John Nielsen
Foul-Play ★★★★
Palo Alto Square
After a long absence Chevy Chase
surfaces as a klutzy cop along with
Hawn as a dizzy blonde in dis
tress. Foul-Play is a very good "sit back
and enjoy it" movie and great for the

summer. It has action, comedy, in
trigue, love and even San Francisco.
The director, Collin "Silver Streak"
Higgins picked a perfect place for a
summer movie and shows us some
very funny people who could only
come from Caen country — there's a
chic feminist who carries brass knuck
les and mace, an old landlord with a
black-belt in karate and a pet boa, a
midget Bible peddler and a swinging
symphony conductor scandalizes
likewise. There are many flaws in the
film but these should be overlooked
in gratitude for the first summer film
this year that isn't a waste of time.

Star Wars ★ ★ ★
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly enter
taining and wildly visual 2) wildly en
tertaining and stunningly visual 3) the
kind of movie nobody makes any
more. On second thought it's delib
erately anesthetic; little more than the
financial successor to "Jaws." Except
for Alec Cuiness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls, or escapees from
episode o! Lassie; though Lucas is to
be praised for avoiding the asinine
political commentary implicit in
things like "Rollerball" and "Logan's
Run" his decision to center the action
around the aformentioned members
of the Pepsi Generation rankles and
irks and peeves. True "2001" fans in
sist that for all its visual achievements
"Star Wars" is really very bland —
even though I still don't know what
the hell was going on in Kubrick's
movie I am tempted to agree.

Scaramouche ★ ★★
Festival Cinema
Thursday |uly 27, Wednesday August 2
A late-night TV favorite which
should be seen on the big screen at
least once. Stewart Granger (not yet
grey in the temples) plays an ousted
French aristocrat who determined to
avenge his family; he goes in to hiding
and becomes a popular actor and
clown, Scaramouche. He thus fences
with his wit until he needs his sword.
This movie has all the best "cavalier
film" attributes, a cynical wag for a
good-guy, an unscrupulous louse for
a bad guy (Mel Ferrer) great costumes,
snappy banter, lots of very superb
sword-play, and a minimum of
(yeech) kissing. Playing with "The
Black Swan."

The Black Swan ★ ★
Festival Cinema
Thursday |uly 27, Wednesday August 2
Here's another one to buckle on
your swash for. Muscle-bound heart
throb Tyrone Power and fiery Mau
reen O'Hara cut a glorious swath
through the Caribbean to save
Jamaica from evil Anthony Quinn.
Lots of broadsides, scurvy-knaves,
thrown knives, and swinging from the
yard-arms in this one. Playing with
"Scaramouche."
—VW
An Unmarried Woman ★ ★★
Biograph
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and
Tonto") warm and intelligent look at
70s divorce. Jill Clayburgh finally
gets a role which is equal to her ta
lent, and she doesn't disappoint.
The film is a bit slow in its middle
third, where the are some very weak
scenes with a therapist. However, in
general the film is comic and affect
ing without being cruel or sac
charine, Alan Bates stands out in a
fine supporting cast.
With "7% Solution."
—Ron Lillejord
Grease ★ ★ ★
Old Mill
It was a dumb play, so don't expect a
brilliant movie. "Grease" has no so
cial commentary or serious insight
into the '50s. It's just good. Greasy
fun.
—Karen Caesar
The Cheap Detective irit
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big
Sleep" or "The Maltese Falcon,"
some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al
most keeps you from realizing how
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise
Fletcher can be. Ann-Margret's
Rumanian cleavage is much in evi
dence.
—Bill Burger
laws II ★ ★
Park
More dying, and less life. More act
ing by worse actors. An even worse
plot, and a stiffer shark. Better than
"Orta the Killer Whale," but not
much. Gratuitous and boring. With
Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary and
Murray Hamilton; without Richard
Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw.
-J.N.

Damien — The Omen II ★ ★
Guild
The devil wastes his time and ours
herein, as he spends the vast majority
of his energy diddling with a heap of
characters that could easily have
been dispatched with early on in the
action. He seems kind of dumb, this
particular arch-fiend — a pretty good
sadist, but still kind of dumb. William
Holden gets it in the end.
-|.N.
The Buddy Holly Story
Fine Arts
Gary Busey's upper lip and expres
sive eyebrows are as fine as any in the
business; his showing as Buddy Holly
makes this picture worthwhile. Busey
can sing, too, and he also is a marvel
ously idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the end
he holds it all together. "The Buddy
Holly Story" could have been better,
and that's no hooey, but its hard to
imagine a finer hick superstar than
the one we got right now. Hol
lywood's finest offering of the sea
son.
—|.N.
International Velvet
Old Mill 6
A sodden remake (demake? un
make?) of a Liz Fischer picture. Tatum
O'Neil no longer oozes charm. She
rides horses, and deja-vuzes all who
will admit to having seen the original,
but she doesn't really, and it shows.
She's losing her zip, that kid.
—J.N.
Turning Point * 112
New Varsity
Saturday July 29—Monday, July 31
A lot of people think this is a tre
mendous movie, very powerful, with
much to say about living and dancing
and dealing with the problems of age.
Baloney. Don't call me at home about
this, because I know it smells of man
slaughter, but "Turning Point" is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious fake sal
vageable only because it incidentally
features the finest dancer on the
planet. The actors' credentials are im
peccable, but they cannot save the
thing from its grocery store pulp novel
state of mind. Stupid. With "Isadora."
-J.N.
Also playing (not reviewed)
The Swarm
Menlo
A movie about killer bees. John Be
lushi isn't in it.
Cat from Outer Space
Old Mill Six
I refuse to see this movie. I refuse to
allow anyone else to see this movie.
Shouldn't have even mentioned it in
the first place.
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band
Moffett
Peter Frampton, the Bee Gees and
other famous rock groups pay a gala
and tuneful tribute to the immortal
Beatles, John Paul, George and Ringo
Starr, the drummer. What a brilliant
idea.
