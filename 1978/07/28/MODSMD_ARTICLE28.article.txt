## Dine amidst Bengal tigers at India House 
### 
India House
350 Jackson Street
San Francisco
392-0744
One of the world's oldest
cuisines, India's table rivals that
of the French, Italians and
Chinese for balance of flavor
and ingredients. Hot and mild
curries, creamy yogurts and
sweet chutneys are the tools of
the good Indian cook.
India House, long a San Fran
cisco favorite, was the first In
dian restaurant on the West
Coast. Established in 1947 by an
elderly British couple, it soon
earned a reputation for bearing
exotic grains and spicemaking in
a proper colonial setting. Today,
owner Sarwan Gill, who began at
India House in 1958 as busboy
and cook, continues to oversee
the finest of Near Eastern kitch
ens.
Aglancearound the interior of
India House suggests at once
that this restaurant is unusual.
Heads, skins and tapestries of
Bengal tigers decorate the walls;
the doorways are arched, the
colors richly muted shades of
red and gold. Waiters wear tur
bans and nehru jackets and are
serious about what they do. The
service is uncompromising.
At India House the menu em
phasizes curry. Each curry is a
unique blending of seasonings
determined by individual taste
or regional custom. Catering to
an often uninitiated clientele,
Mr. Gill has been careful to offer
a variety of blends in a range of
seafood, lamb, poultry and veg
etable entrees.
Authentic recipes, such as
Ghai Ka Gosht Vindaloo, a hot
and sour sirloin beef curry
($10.50), are prepared with the
fiery curries of southern India,
while the Punjabi Chicken Curry
($9.95) and the Shrimp Curry
($10.75) incorporate the more
subtle blends of northern and
eastern India.
Meals at India House can be
ordered a la carte or as complete

dinners with romaine salad,
choice of dessert and tea or cof
fee. Entree portions are large
and begin at $6.95 for a mixed
vegetable curry and $8.25 for
Bermuda Creamed Chicken.
More expensive dinners include
the Prawn Curry at $11.50.
The recommended drink with
curry is a large tankard of beer or
a frosted Pimm's Cup — the orig
inal Gin Sling invented in 1841 by
James Pimm and served with
7-Up, Club Soda and garnished
with sliced cucumber and le
mon. An average, but certainly
adequate selection of medium
priced California wines is also
available.
For those who prefer some
thing other than curry, the selec
tion is small but distinctive.
Chicken Tandoori ($9.95) is
probably the best known of such
non-curry dishes. Pieces of ten
der chicken are marinated over
night in a special blend of herbs,
spices, wine and yogurt, and
baked until the meat falls away
from the bone. The tandoori is
sweeter and creamier than a
curry dish.
Appetizers and breads are or
dered separately from the din
ner. We tried the Keema Samosa
($1.25) and found these mince
stuffed pastries pleasant but not
exceptional. Something a little
spicier would have provided a
more dramatic introduction.
To complement the Punjabi
Chicken Curry and Bakra
Khorma that we had ordered we
decided on a basket of Chapati
($1), a mild, unleavened pan
cake bread. Similar to a flour tor
tilla, the Chapati went largely
unnoticed.
All curries are served with
eight different condiments —
grated coconut, ground
peanuts, chow-chow, chopped
pickles in a highly seasoned
mustard sauce, onions, raisins,
hot sauce and quartered limes.
The trick here is to contrast hot
and cool, sweet and sour tastes
and to provide an attractive array
of textures and colors. Like a lit

tie kid in a candy store, the diner
is invited to sample and enjov
Both curries were served i
individual casseroles with larg.
plates on which to mix meat,
sauce and condiments. The
Khorma consisted of thick cubes
of lamb cooked in a spicy brown
sauce — a house specialty my
escort enjoyed with liberal
amounts of hot sauce. Generous
with tender chicken and
smothered in a tomato based
sauce, the Punjabi is a milder
curry perfect for the beginner.

I ike most eastern cultures,
".Jians don't really eat de
and usually only offer it as a
itession to the Westerner's
.veet tooth. As a result, desserts
are simple and rarely notewor
thy. We did try the Kheer, a rice
pudding included with dinner,
and found it rather tasteless.
Fresh fruit or a light sherbet
would have been a better
choice.
At the end of our meal we
were pleased that our waiter
wasn't rushing us out. In "impe

rial" style, we were allowed to
enjoy the memory of a well
prepared cuisine. Undoubtedly
tailored to American tastes and
American pocketbooks (no In
dian would pay $10.75 fora lamb
curry) India House has neverthe
less made dining out a pleasant
experience.
Luncheon and cocktails are
served weekdays at 11:30 a.m.
and dinner daily at 5:30 p.m. ex
cept Sundays. Banquet rooms
and valet parking are available.

India House
350 Jackson Street
San Francisco
392-0744
One of the world's oldest
cuisines, India's table rivals that
of the French, Italians and
Chinese for balance of flavor
and ingredients. Hot and mild
curries, creamy yogurts and
sweet chutneys are the tools of
the good Indian cook.
India House, long a San Fran
cisco favorite, was the first In
dian restaurant on the West
Coast. Established in 1947 by an
elderly British couple, it soon
earned a reputation for bearing
exotic grains and spicemaking in
a proper colonial setting. Today,
owner Sarwan Gill, who began at
India House in 1958 as busboy
and cook, continues to oversee
the finest of Near Eastern kitch
ens.
Aglancearound the interior of
India House suggests at once
that this restaurant is unusual.
Heads, skins and tapestries of
Bengal tigers decorate the walls;
the doorways are arched, the
colors richly muted shades of
red and gold. Waiters wear tur
bans and nehru jackets and are
serious about what they do. The
service is uncompromising.
At India House the menu em
phasizes curry. Each curry is a
unique blending of seasonings
determined by individual taste
or regional custom. Catering to
an often uninitiated clientele,
Mr. Gill has been careful to offer
a variety of blends in a range of
seafood, lamb, poultry and veg
etable entrees.
Authentic recipes, such as
Ghai Ka Gosht Vindaloo, a hot
and sour sirloin beef curry
($10.50), are prepared with the
fiery curries of southern India,
while the Punjabi Chicken Curry
($9.95) and the Shrimp Curry
($10.75) incorporate the more
subtle blends of northern and
eastern India.
Meals at India House can be
ordered a la carte or as complete

dinners with romaine salad,
choice of dessert and tea or cof
fee. Entree portions are large
and begin at $6.95 for a mixed
vegetable curry and $8.25 for
Bermuda Creamed Chicken.
More expensive dinners include
the Prawn Curry at $11.50.
The recommended drink with
curry is a large tankard of beer or
a frosted Pimm's Cup — the orig
inal Gin Sling invented in 1841 by
James Pimm and served with
7-Up, Club Soda and garnished
with sliced cucumber and le
mon. An average, but certainly
adequate selection of medium
priced California wines is also
available.
For those who prefer some
thing other than curry, the selec
tion is small but distinctive.
Chicken Tandoori ($9.95) is
probably the best known of such
non-curry dishes. Pieces of ten
der chicken are marinated over
night in a special blend of herbs,
spices, wine and yogurt, and
baked until the meat falls away
from the bone. The tandoori is
sweeter and creamier than a
curry dish.
Appetizers and breads are or
dered separately from the din
ner. We tried the Keema Samosa
($1.25) and found these mince
stuffed pastries pleasant but not
exceptional. Something a little
spicier would have provided a
more dramatic introduction.
To complement the Punjabi
Chicken Curry and Bakra
Khorma that we had ordered we
decided on a basket of Chapati
($1), a mild, unleavened pan
cake bread. Similar to a flour tor
tilla, the Chapati went largely
unnoticed.
All curries are served with
eight different condiments —
grated coconut, ground
peanuts, chow-chow, chopped
pickles in a highly seasoned
mustard sauce, onions, raisins,
hot sauce and quartered limes.
The trick here is to contrast hot
and cool, sweet and sour tastes
and to provide an attractive array
of textures and colors. Like a lit

tie kid in a candy store, the diner
is invited to sample and enjov
Both curries were served i
individual casseroles with larg.
plates on which to mix meat,
sauce and condiments. The
Khorma consisted of thick cubes
of lamb cooked in a spicy brown
sauce — a house specialty my
escort enjoyed with liberal
amounts of hot sauce. Generous
with tender chicken and
smothered in a tomato based
sauce, the Punjabi is a milder
curry perfect for the beginner.

I ike most eastern cultures,
".Jians don't really eat de
and usually only offer it as a
itession to the Westerner's
.veet tooth. As a result, desserts
are simple and rarely notewor
thy. We did try the Kheer, a rice
pudding included with dinner,
and found it rather tasteless.
Fresh fruit or a light sherbet
would have been a better
choice.
