# Enrico's – a city 'hot spot'

It may be a typical foggy day in San Francisco,
but indeed, as the top of the menu reads, "It is a
beautiful day at Enrico's." As one of the city's hot
spots, this restaurant is perfect for people
watching and sipping exotic coffees. In addition
to offering a sidewalk cafe setting amidst hanging
plants, antiqued wood and stained glass, Enrico's
boasts an assortment of pastas, crepes, salads and
sandwiches.
After surveying a selection of reasonably priced
dishes, I decided on a bowl of onion soup ($2.25)
and Enrico's Special ($4.25). My companion chose
the Canelloni ($4.50), which comes with a
garden-fresh salad and a basket of assorted
breads — dark pumpernickel, rye and crusty
sourdough.
The onion soup, which almost constituted a
meal in itself, was cleverly served on a small metal
stand in order to prevent the diner from burning
himself on the piping-hot ceramic bowl. Stringy
melted cheese and a thick slice of French bread
topped this savory onion broth.
The salad, which consisted of iceberg lettuce in
an oily Italian dressing, was somewhat disap
pointing.
Quick, efficient service allowed us to have our
entrees presented to us just as we were finishing
the soup and salad.
I never would have guessed before that a mix
ture of ground beef, eggs, spinach, green onions,
mushrooms, water chestnuts and fresh tomatoes
could be such a flavorful combination! Yet, En

rico's Special was just that. This lightly-seasoned
concoction was delightfully different.
A smooth white cheese sauce gave the Canel
loni its richness and flavor. This creamy sauce
smothering the sausage-stuffed noodles, per
fectly complemented the spicy meat filling.
Other specialties worth mentioning are the
tangy welsh rarebit ($3.50), an assorted cheese
board ($5.50) with six different kinds of cheese
and seasonal fruit, and entrees which change
daily.
With half the menu devoted to a myriad of
tempting goodies including cakes and pastries
($1.50), soda fountain creations ($ 60-$3.50) and
25 varieties of coffee ($.90-$4.50), it is under
standable why many people come to Enrico's just
for dessert! We chose a delicious liqueured
milkshake ($3) and the traditional Irish coffee
($1.25).
The milkshakes, created from ice cream made
at the restaurant and a choice of liqueur, were
unbeatable. The vanilla ice cream with Creme de
Menthe shake was easily enough for two. Other
mouth-watering suggestions are pineapple ice
cream with apricot brandy and blackberry ice
cream with Cognac.
In addition, we ordered Irish coffee. Served
with a dollop of whipped cream, this warming
drink was perfect for slow sipping at the end of
our meal.
Whether breakfast, lunch, dinner or midnight
snack, for a full-course dinner or just an ice cream
cone, in a fur coat or blue jeans, it's always "a
beautiful day at Enrico's."
