Israeli negotiators sent home
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israel's only direct
negotiating link with Egypt was severed yes
terday while America's Mideast mediator
moved to get the two countries talking
face-to-face again about a Mideast peace
settlement.
An Israeli military delegation, in Egypt
since January, was thrown out of the coun
try on the order of President Anwar Sadat
and flown back to Tel Aviv yesterday in an
Egyptian jet liner.
"This is not the end, only the beginning of
process," delegation commander Col.
Yaacov Heychal told reporters after arriving
at Ben Gurion airport.
Meanwhile, Arab foreign ministers said
they have agreed on the basis for a possible
Middle East peace platform after meeting at
the conference of non-aligned nations in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
Details of the proposal weren't disclosed,
but it is the first joint peace effort that
includes Egypt since Sadat took his lone in
itiative to Jerusalem last year.
Despite the Israelis' expulsion <rom
Egypt, U.S. Ambassador Alfred Atherton Jr.,
the roving Mideast mediator, pressed ahead
with his Mideast shuttle by scheduling a
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan.
Today, Atherton is to travel to Egypt for
more meetings. Washington hopes they will
lead to a resumption of direct Israel-Egypt
talks in about two weeks, when U.S. Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance is to travel to the
Middle East.
The American aim is to get the foreign and
defense ministers of both Israel and Egypt
together with Vance as chairman, probably
at the U.S. Surveillance station in the Sinai
Peninsula.
Begin dismissed the expulsion of the de
legation as a minor matter.
"They don't have a central role," Begin
said on television Wednesday night after
the Egyptian decision was announced. But
observers here and in Egypt saw the expul
sion as a signal of Egyptian impatience for a
change in Israel's negotiating position.
Ford: don't count me out
Arlington, Va. — Former President Gerald
Ford launched a broad attack yesterday on
many <Jf President Carter's policies and de
clared: "Don't count me out" in 1980.
Ford criticized Carter on both foreign and
domestic issues, including attempts to curb
inflation, a proposed national health prog
ram, tax policies and cancellation of the B-1
bomber and cutback in other military prog
rams in the face of what he said was a grow
ing Soviet threat.
On the possibility that he might seek to
regain the White House in two years, Ford
said in a strong voice: "Don't count me out
and don't count me in. I'm healthy, I'll be
around and I won't duck any responsibil
ity."
That drew loud applause from his audi
ence, a convention of the Independent
Truckers Association. The truckers also
applauded roundly when he added:
"Retirement isn't all that bad, and I would
recommend it to President Carter at the ear
liest possible time."
Ford called inflation "America's public
enemy No. land said the Carter administ
ration had failed to follow through on an
anti-inflation program he had started in 1974
when he took office following the resigna
tion of Richard M. Nixon.
Brown monitors hotline
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown said yes
terday he will monitor a new statewide toll
free renters' hotline for several weeks be
fore deciding whether mandatory rent con
trol legislation is needed.
Brown's announcement followed a
closed-door meeting with 12 representa
tives of renters' rights coalitions and politi
cal groups.
Brown and Cary Lowe, of the California
Housing Action and Information Network,
told reporters after the meeting that they
agreed to give the voluntary rollback a try —
via the hotline — then decide whether there
was sufficient positive response from land
lords.
"Through the hotline, we are going to
compile information on how well Proposi
tion 13 has been implemented," said
Brown. The information from the hotline,
which began Wednesday, will be made pub

lie and given to state legislators, he added.
The statewide hotline number — for ten
ants whose rent has been increased since
May 31 — is 800-952-5537, except in Sac
ramento, where it is 322-5257. It will be staf
fed weekdays only from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tenants will be asked to give their name and
address, as well as the name and address of
their landlord and the amount of their rent
increase. A hotline staff member will then
call the landlord, explain Brown's voluntary
rent-control proposals and urge them to
comply.
Tenants also may write to Renters' Hot
line, 1020 N. Street, Sacramento, 95814.
"If the landlords don't respond, then
some sort of legislation will be required.
I've made it very clear to the landlords that
they'd better shape up — or else," Brown
continued. "And I'm going to use the hot
line to that end."
The Democratic governor's meeting with
the renters' representatives yesterday was
described by Lowe as "somewhat friendly,"
but Lowe added that ". . . there is still a
tremendous gap before we come to an ag
reement on how landlords should act." 1
Folsom Prison hunger strike
Folsom — Some inmates in Folsom Pris
on's tough maximutnrsecurity quarters have
launched a hunger strike, and a Prisoners
Union lawyer said yesterday the situa
tion "is getting pretty volatile."
About 60 of the 78 prisoners on the first
two floors of the "prison-within-a-prison"
have refused to eat since dinner Wednes
day, said prison spokesman Huel Morphis.
Inmates on those floors have been locked
in their cells since they began protesting
conditions July 11 by refusing to show up for
the evening headcount.
At various times, they have flooded the
cells, burned papers and bedding, and
thrown metal plates on the floor, Morphis
said. But he said they have been quiet for
several days.
Morphis said the center is "the end of the
line" for "some of the toughest riff-raff you
have ever come in contact with." He said
most of the prisoners are "troublemakers,
dangerous, escape-prone, and some are
gang leaders."
The prisoners want some of the amenities
that the remainder of the 1488 Folsom in
mates have, including telephone calls, fam
ily visits and more equipment in the exer
cise yard. They also want better food and
medical care, and the right to wear straw
hats as protection against the sun.
Morphis said prison officials have re
sponded to most of the demands, but will
not negotiate while the "misbehavior" con
tinues.
Michael Snedeker, a Prisoners Union
lawyer who represents families and friends
of some of the inmates, said the hunger
strike started after prisoners were put on
"restricted diets," which he said have the
taste and consistency of dog food.
Morphis said some inmates who had de
stroyed property earlier in the protest were
put on a diet of warmed baked meat loaf,
bread and water twice a day as punishment
starting Wednesday. He said the food was
"wholesome."
Gulf Oil refunds $42 million
Washington — Gulf Oil Corp. will pay
$42.2 million to the Treasury to settle a gov
ernment claim that the oil company over
stated the cost of crude oil acquired by
Gulf's foreign affiliates, it was announced
yesterday.
The refund is intended to go eventually to
customers who were overcharged because
of the overstatement, the Energy Depart
ment said. But if you buy Gulf gasoline for
the family car, don't expect riches.
The department said, however, that the
refund due the Treasury Department will be
minus any claims by "Gulf's customers who
are able to show that they should receive
refunds directly."
O'Leary and Paul Bloom, the Energy De
partment's general counsel, said notices of
hearings to determine a policy will be pub
lished soon in the Federal Register.
Namibia supported by U.N.
United Nations — The U.N. Security
Council adopted two resolutions yesterday
initiating a Western plan to make South
west Africa independent of white-ruled
South Africa and calling for the "reintegra

tion" of Walvis Bay into the disputed territ
ory.
One resolution endorsed the Western
proposal asking U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim to name a special represen
tative to "ensure the early independence of
Namibia through free elections" under
U.N. supervision and control. It passed
13-0, with the Soviet Union and Czechos
lovakia abstaining.
The other resolution, denounced by the
South Africans, said Walvis Bay, the territ
ory's only deepwater port, should be
handed over to the new nation. It was ap
proved 13-0, with the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia abstaining again.
Namibia is the African name for South
west Africa.
South Africa has controlled Namibia for
63 years and its cooperation for the orderly
transition to nationhood is considered es
sential.
The United States and the other Western
powers — Britain, France, West Germany
and Canada — hoped they could win South
African cooperation with a joint statement
of their own saying that their plan did not
question South Africa's legal claim to the
port, Walvis Bay, or require South Africa to
turn it over immediately to Namibia.
The status of Walvis Bay had become the
major stumbling block in the way of a set
tlement. Black African leaders insist it must
belong to Namibia. South Africa insists that
it has always held sovereignty over the port.
'Uncle of Sam' reward raised
South Lake Tahoe — The price on the head
of a man who calls himself "Uncle of Sam"
and is believed to have set a rash of fires in
the Lake Tahoe Basin went up by $500 yes
terday.
The Nevada Division of Forestry added
$500 to the $1500 reward put up by the U.S.
Forest Service for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of the alleged arsonist
or arsonists.
The Nevada money will be paid only if the
arson conviction involves fires set in
Nevada.
The unidentified man began calling the
Tahoe Tribune last week. Before the
switchboard operator could connect him
with a reporter, he threatened to continue
setting fires in the area if California does not
drop a lawsuit against Nevada.
He never said what suit he meant.
So far, nobody has been injured in any of
the fires, and none has been reported since
Sunday.
Garbage strikes continue
Detroit's 650 garbagemen worked past
yesterday's strike deadline as negotiators
for their union and the city met in secret to
resolve differences over mandatory over
time.
In San Antonio, about 400 ex-garbagemen
and other fired city workers held a four-mile
march and rallied at City Hall to gain support
from the city council.
Rock-throwing and other sporadic vio
lence has erupted since more than half the
city's 313 sanitation workers were fired for
walking off the job Saturday and Sunday.
And in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the city's 245 gar
bagemen manned picket lines after the
mayor extended a deadline for firing them
until Monday to allow officials to investigate
charges that led to the walkout.
Regular garbage collections were made in
Detroit after union leaders allowed their
strike deadline to pass so that their
negotiators could attempt to reach agree
ment in the overtime dispute. The city con
tended that mandatory overtime is neces
sary to maintain adequate sanitation ser
vice.
The marchers in San Antonio, including
children in wagons and on roller skates and
women with baby carriages, marched
peacefully through the city to the rally out
side City Hall.
The mostly Mexican-American crowd car
ried placards in Spanish and English and
heard speeches in Spanish at the rally. The
city of 800,000 near the Mexico border has a
high population of Mexican-Americans.
Today's weather
Tomorrow through Tuesday, fair with
night and morning fog or low clouds along
the coast. Temperatures will average nearto
slightly above normal. Highs in the 60s and
70s near the coast and the 90s to near 105
inland valleys. Lows in the 50s and 60s.

The refund is intended to go eventually to

The department said, however, that the

Namibia supported by U.N.
United Nations — The U.N. Security
Council adopted two resolutions yesterday
initiating a Western plan to make South
west Africa independent of white-ruled
South Africa and calling for the "reintegra

tion" of Walvis Bay into the disputed territ
ory.
One resolution endorsed the Western
proposal asking U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim to name a special represen
tative to "ensure the early independence of
Namibia through free elections" under
U.N. supervision and control. It passed
13-0, with the Soviet Union and Czechos
lovakia abstaining.
The other resolution, denounced by the
South Africans, said Walvis Bay, the territ
ory's only deepwater port, should be
handed over to the new nation. It was ap
proved 13-0, with the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia abstaining again.
Namibia is the African name for South
west Africa.
South Africa has controlled Namibia for
63 years and its cooperation for the orderly
transition to nationhood is considered es
sential.
The United States and the other Western
powers — Britain, France, West Germany
and Canada — hoped they could win South
African cooperation with a joint statement
of their own saying that their plan did not
question South Africa's legal claim to the
port, Walvis Bay, or require South Africa to
turn it over immediately to Namibia.
The status of Walvis Bay had become the
major stumbling block in the way of a set
tlement. Black African leaders insist it must
belong to Namibia. South Africa insists that
it has always held sovereignty over the port.
'Uncle of Sam' reward raised
South Lake Tahoe — The price on the head
of a man who calls himself "Uncle of Sam"
and is believed to have set a rash of fires in
the Lake Tahoe Basin went up by $500 yes
terday.
The Nevada Division of Forestry added
$500 to the $1500 reward put up by the U.S.
Forest Service for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of the alleged arsonist
or arsonists.
The Nevada money will be paid only if the
arson conviction involves fires set in
Nevada.
The unidentified man began calling the
Tahoe Tribune last week. Before the
switchboard operator could connect him
with a reporter, he threatened to continue
setting fires in the area if California does not
drop a lawsuit against Nevada.
He never said what suit he meant.
So far, nobody has been injured in any of
the fires, and none has been reported since
Sunday.
Garbage strikes continue
Detroit's 650 garbagemen worked past
yesterday's strike deadline as negotiators
for their union and the city met in secret to
resolve differences over mandatory over
time.
In San Antonio, about 400 ex-garbagemen
and other fired city workers held a four-mile
march and rallied at City Hall to gain support
from the city council.
Rock-throwing and other sporadic vio
lence has erupted since more than half the
city's 313 sanitation workers were fired for
walking off the job Saturday and Sunday.
And in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the city's 245 gar
bagemen manned picket lines after the
mayor extended a deadline for firing them
until Monday to allow officials to investigate
charges that led to the walkout.
Regular garbage collections were made in
Detroit after union leaders allowed their
strike deadline to pass so that their
negotiators could attempt to reach agree
ment in the overtime dispute. The city con
tended that mandatory overtime is neces
sary to maintain adequate sanitation ser
vice.
The marchers in San Antonio, including
children in wagons and on roller skates and
women with baby carriages, marched
peacefully through the city to the rally out
side City Hall.
The mostly Mexican-American crowd car
ried placards in Spanish and English and
heard speeches in Spanish at the rally. The
city of 800,000 near the Mexico border has a
high population of Mexican-Americans.
Today's weather
Tomorrow through Tuesday, fair with
night and morning fog or low clouds along

Israeli negotiators sent home
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israel's only direct
negotiating link with Egypt was severed yes
terday while America's Mideast mediator
moved to get the two countries talking
face-to-face again about a Mideast peace
settlement.
An Israeli military delegation, in Egypt
since January, was thrown out of the coun
try on the order of President Anwar Sadat
and flown back to Tel Aviv yesterday in an
Egyptian jet liner.
"This is not the end, only the beginning of
process," delegation commander Col.
Yaacov Heychal told reporters after arriving
at Ben Gurion airport.
Meanwhile, Arab foreign ministers said
they have agreed on the basis for a possible
Middle East peace platform after meeting at
the conference of non-aligned nations in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
Details of the proposal weren't disclosed,
but it is the first joint peace effort that
includes Egypt since Sadat took his lone in
itiative to Jerusalem last year.
Despite the Israelis' expulsion <rom
Egypt, U.S. Ambassador Alfred Atherton Jr.,
the roving Mideast mediator, pressed ahead
with his Mideast shuttle by scheduling a
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan.
Today, Atherton is to travel to Egypt for
more meetings. Washington hopes they will
lead to a resumption of direct Israel-Egypt
talks in about two weeks, when U.S. Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance is to travel to the
Middle East.
The American aim is to get the foreign and
defense ministers of both Israel and Egypt
together with Vance as chairman, probably
at the U.S. Surveillance station in the Sinai
Peninsula.
Begin dismissed the expulsion of the de
legation as a minor matter.
"They don't have a central role," Begin
said on television Wednesday night after
the Egyptian decision was announced. But
observers here and in Egypt saw the expul
sion as a signal of Egyptian impatience for a
change in Israel's negotiating position.
Ford: don't count me out
Arlington, Va. — Former President Gerald
Ford launched a broad attack yesterday on
many <Jf President Carter's policies and de
clared: "Don't count me out" in 1980.
Ford criticized Carter on both foreign and
domestic issues, including attempts to curb
inflation, a proposed national health prog
ram, tax policies and cancellation of the B-1
bomber and cutback in other military prog
rams in the face of what he said was a grow
ing Soviet threat.
On the possibility that he might seek to
regain the White House in two years, Ford
said in a strong voice: "Don't count me out
and don't count me in. I'm healthy, I'll be
around and I won't duck any responsibil
ity."
That drew loud applause from his audi
ence, a convention of the Independent
Truckers Association. The truckers also
applauded roundly when he added:
"Retirement isn't all that bad, and I would
recommend it to President Carter at the ear
liest possible time."
Ford called inflation "America's public
enemy No. land said the Carter administ
ration had failed to follow through on an
anti-inflation program he had started in 1974
when he took office following the resigna
tion of Richard M. Nixon.
Brown monitors hotline
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown said yes
terday he will monitor a new statewide toll
free renters' hotline for several weeks be
fore deciding whether mandatory rent con
trol legislation is needed.
Brown's announcement followed a
closed-door meeting with 12 representa
tives of renters' rights coalitions and politi
cal groups.
Brown and Cary Lowe, of the California
Housing Action and Information Network,
told reporters after the meeting that they
agreed to give the voluntary rollback a try —
via the hotline — then decide whether there
was sufficient positive response from land
lords.
"Through the hotline, we are going to
compile information on how well Proposi
tion 13 has been implemented," said
Brown. The information from the hotline,
which began Wednesday, will be made pub

lie and given to state legislators, he added.
The statewide hotline number — for ten
ants whose rent has been increased since
May 31 — is 800-952-5537, except in Sac
ramento, where it is 322-5257. It will be staf
fed weekdays only from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tenants will be asked to give their name and
address, as well as the name and address of
their landlord and the amount of their rent
increase. A hotline staff member will then
call the landlord, explain Brown's voluntary
rent-control proposals and urge them to
comply.
Tenants also may write to Renters' Hot
line, 1020 N. Street, Sacramento, 95814.
"If the landlords don't respond, then
some sort of legislation will be required.
I've made it very clear to the landlords that
they'd better shape up — or else," Brown
continued. "And I'm going to use the hot
line to that end."
The Democratic governor's meeting with
the renters' representatives yesterday was
described by Lowe as "somewhat friendly,"
but Lowe added that ". . . there is still a
tremendous gap before we come to an ag
reement on how landlords should act." 1
Folsom Prison hunger strike
Folsom — Some inmates in Folsom Pris
on's tough maximutnrsecurity quarters have
launched a hunger strike, and a Prisoners
Union lawyer said yesterday the situa
tion "is getting pretty volatile."
About 60 of the 78 prisoners on the first
two floors of the "prison-within-a-prison"
have refused to eat since dinner Wednes
day, said prison spokesman Huel Morphis.
Inmates on those floors have been locked
in their cells since they began protesting
conditions July 11 by refusing to show up for
the evening headcount.
At various times, they have flooded the
cells, burned papers and bedding, and
thrown metal plates on the floor, Morphis
said. But he said they have been quiet for
several days.
Morphis said the center is "the end of the
line" for "some of the toughest riff-raff you
have ever come in contact with." He said
most of the prisoners are "troublemakers,
dangerous, escape-prone, and some are
gang leaders."
The prisoners want some of the amenities
that the remainder of the 1488 Folsom in
mates have, including telephone calls, fam
ily visits and more equipment in the exer
cise yard. They also want better food and
medical care, and the right to wear straw
hats as protection against the sun.
Morphis said prison officials have re
sponded to most of the demands, but will
not negotiate while the "misbehavior" con
tinues.
Michael Snedeker, a Prisoners Union
lawyer who represents families and friends
of some of the inmates, said the hunger
strike started after prisoners were put on
"restricted diets," which he said have the
taste and consistency of dog food.
Morphis said some inmates who had de
stroyed property earlier in the protest were
put on a diet of warmed baked meat loaf,
bread and water twice a day as punishment
starting Wednesday. He said the food was
"wholesome."
Gulf Oil refunds $42 million
Washington — Gulf Oil Corp. will pay
$42.2 million to the Treasury to settle a gov
ernment claim that the oil company over
stated the cost of crude oil acquired by
Gulf's foreign affiliates, it was announced
yesterday.
The refund is intended to go eventually to
customers who were overcharged because
of the overstatement, the Energy Depart
ment said. But if you buy Gulf gasoline for
the family car, don't expect riches.
The department said, however, that the
refund due the Treasury Department will be

are able to show that they should receive
refunds directly."
O'Leary and Paul Bloom, the Energy De

Brown monitors hotline
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown said yes
terday he will monitor a new statewide toll
free renters' hotline for several weeks be
fore deciding whether mandatory rent con
trol legislation is needed.
Brown's announcement followed a
closed-door meeting with 12 representa
tives of renters' rights coalitions and politi
cal groups.
Brown and Cary Lowe, of the California
Housing Action and Information Network,
told reporters after the meeting that they
agreed to give the voluntary rollback a try —
via the hotline — then decide whether there
was sufficient positive response from land
lords.
"Through the hotline, we are going to
compile information on how well Proposi
tion 13 has been implemented," said
Brown. The information from the hotline,
which began Wednesday, will be made pub

lie and given to state legislators, he added.
The statewide hotline number — for ten
ants whose rent has been increased since
May 31 — is 800-952-5537, except in Sac
ramento, where it is 322-5257. It will be staf
fed weekdays only from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tenants will be asked to give their name and
address, as well as the name and address of
their landlord and the amount of their rent
increase. A hotline staff member will then
call the landlord, explain Brown's voluntary
rent-control proposals and urge them to
comply.
Tenants also may write to Renters' Hot
line, 1020 N. Street, Sacramento, 95814.
"If the landlords don't respond, then
some sort of legislation will be required.
I've made it very clear to the landlords that
they'd better shape up — or else," Brown
continued. "And I'm going to use the hot
line to that end."
The Democratic governor's meeting with
the renters' representatives yesterday was
described by Lowe as "somewhat friendly,"
but Lowe added that ". . . there is still a
tremendous gap before we come to an ag

Folsom Prison hunger strike
Folsom — Some inmates in Folsom Pris
on's tough maximutnrsecurity quarters have
launched a hunger strike, and a Prisoners
Union lawyer said yesterday the situa
tion "is getting pretty volatile."
About 60 of the 78 prisoners on the first
two floors of the "prison-within-a-prison"
have refused to eat since dinner Wednes
day, said prison spokesman Huel Morphis.
Inmates on those floors have been locked
in their cells since they began protesting
conditions July 11 by refusing to show up for
the evening headcount.
At various times, they have flooded the
cells, burned papers and bedding, and
thrown metal plates on the floor, Morphis
said. But he said they have been quiet for
several days.
Morphis said the center is "the end of the
line" for "some of the toughest riff-raff you
have ever come in contact with." He said
most of the prisoners are "troublemakers,
dangerous, escape-prone, and some are
gang leaders."
The prisoners want some of the amenities
that the remainder of the 1488 Folsom in
mates have, including telephone calls, fam
ily visits and more equipment in the exer
cise yard. They also want better food and
medical care, and the right to wear straw
hats as protection against the sun.
Morphis said prison officials have re
sponded to most of the demands, but will
not negotiate while the "misbehavior" con
tinues.
Michael Snedeker, a Prisoners Union
lawyer who represents families and friends
of some of the inmates, said the hunger
strike started after prisoners were put on
"restricted diets," which he said have the
taste and consistency of dog food.
Morphis said some inmates who had de
stroyed property earlier in the protest were
put on a diet of warmed baked meat loaf,
bread and water twice a day as punishment
starting Wednesday. He said the food was
"wholesome."
Gulf Oil refunds $42 million
Washington — Gulf Oil Corp. will pay
$42.2 million to the Treasury to settle a gov
ernment claim that the oil company over
stated the cost of crude oil acquired by
Gulf's foreign affiliates, it was announced
yesterday.
The refund is intended to go eventually to
customers who were overcharged because
of the overstatement, the Energy Depart
ment said. But if you buy Gulf gasoline for
the family car, don't expect riches.
The department said, however, that the
refund due the Treasury Department will be
minus any claims by "Gulf's customers who
are able to show that they should receive
refunds directly."
O'Leary and Paul Bloom, the Energy De
partment's general counsel, said notices of
hearings to determine a policy will be pub
lished soon in the Federal Register.
Namibia supported by U.N.
United Nations — The U.N. Security
Council adopted two resolutions yesterday
initiating a Western plan to make South
west Africa independent of white-ruled
South Africa and calling for the "reintegra

tion" of Walvis Bay into the disputed territ
ory.
One resolution endorsed the Western
proposal asking U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim to name a special represen
tative to "ensure the early independence of
Namibia through free elections" under
U.N. supervision and control. It passed
13-0, with the Soviet Union and Czechos
lovakia abstaining.
The other resolution, denounced by the
South Africans, said Walvis Bay, the territ
ory's only deepwater port, should be
handed over to the new nation. It was ap
proved 13-0, with the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia abstaining again.
Namibia is the African name for South
west Africa.
South Africa has controlled Namibia for
63 years and its cooperation for the orderly
transition to nationhood is considered es
sential.
The United States and the other Western
powers — Britain, France, West Germany
and Canada — hoped they could win South
African cooperation with a joint statement
of their own saying that their plan did not
question South Africa's legal claim to the
port, Walvis Bay, or require South Africa to
turn it over immediately to Namibia.
The status of Walvis Bay had become the
major stumbling block in the way of a set
tlement. Black African leaders insist it must
belong to Namibia. South Africa insists that
it has always held sovereignty over the port.
'Uncle of Sam' reward raised
South Lake Tahoe — The price on the head
of a man who calls himself "Uncle of Sam"
and is believed to have set a rash of fires in
the Lake Tahoe Basin went up by $500 yes
terday.
The Nevada Division of Forestry added
$500 to the $1500 reward put up by the U.S.
Forest Service for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of the alleged arsonist
or arsonists.
The Nevada money will be paid only if the
arson conviction involves fires set in
Nevada.
The unidentified man began calling the
Tahoe Tribune last week. Before the
switchboard operator could connect him
with a reporter, he threatened to continue
setting fires in the area if California does not
drop a lawsuit against Nevada.
He never said what suit he meant.
So far, nobody has been injured in any of
the fires, and none has been reported since
Sunday.
Garbage strikes continue
Detroit's 650 garbagemen worked past
yesterday's strike deadline as negotiators
for their union and the city met in secret to
resolve differences over mandatory over
time.
In San Antonio, about 400 ex-garbagemen
and other fired city workers held a four-mile
march and rallied at City Hall to gain support
from the city council.
Rock-throwing and other sporadic vio
lence has erupted since more than half the
city's 313 sanitation workers were fired for
walking off the job Saturday and Sunday.
And in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the city's 245 gar
bagemen manned picket lines after the
mayor extended a deadline for firing them
until Monday to allow officials to investigate
charges that led to the walkout.
Regular garbage collections were made in
Detroit after union leaders allowed their
strike deadline to pass so that their
negotiators could attempt to reach agree
ment in the overtime dispute. The city con
tended that mandatory overtime is neces
sary to maintain adequate sanitation ser
vice.
The marchers in San Antonio, including
children in wagons and on roller skates and
women with baby carriages, marched
peacefully through the city to the rally out
side City Hall.
The mostly Mexican-American crowd car
ried placards in Spanish and English and
heard speeches in Spanish at the rally. The
city of 800,000 near the Mexico border has a
high population of Mexican-Americans.
Today's weather
Tomorrow through Tuesday, fair with
night and morning fog or low clouds along
the coast. Temperatures will average nearto
slightly above normal. Highs in the 60s and
70s near the coast and the 90s to near 105
inland valleys. Lows in the 50s and 60s.
Israeli negotiators sent home
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israel's only direct
negotiating link with Egypt was severed yes
terday while America's Mideast mediator
moved to get the two countries talking
face-to-face again about a Mideast peace
settlement.
An Israeli military delegation, in Egypt
since January, was thrown out of the coun
try on the order of President Anwar Sadat
and flown back to Tel Aviv yesterday in an
Egyptian jet liner.
"This is not the end, only the beginning of
process," delegation commander Col.
Yaacov Heychal told reporters after arriving
at Ben Gurion airport.
Meanwhile, Arab foreign ministers said
they have agreed on the basis for a possible
Middle East peace platform after meeting at
the conference of non-aligned nations in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
Details of the proposal weren't disclosed,
but it is the first joint peace effort that
includes Egypt since Sadat took his lone in
itiative to Jerusalem last year.
Despite the Israelis' expulsion <rom
Egypt, U.S. Ambassador Alfred Atherton Jr.,
the roving Mideast mediator, pressed ahead
with his Mideast shuttle by scheduling a
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan.
Today, Atherton is to travel to Egypt for
more meetings. Washington hopes they will
lead to a resumption of direct Israel-Egypt
talks in about two weeks, when U.S. Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance is to travel to the
Middle East.
The American aim is to get the foreign and
defense ministers of both Israel and Egypt
together with Vance as chairman, probably
at the U.S. Surveillance station in the Sinai
Peninsula.
Begin dismissed the expulsion of the de
legation as a minor matter.
"They don't have a central role," Begin
said on television Wednesday night after
the Egyptian decision was announced. But
observers here and in Egypt saw the expul
sion as a signal of Egyptian impatience for a
change in Israel's negotiating position.
Ford: don't count me out
Arlington, Va. — Former President Gerald
Ford launched a broad attack yesterday on
many <Jf President Carter's policies and de
clared: "Don't count me out" in 1980.
Ford criticized Carter on both foreign and
domestic issues, including attempts to curb
inflation, a proposed national health prog
ram, tax policies and cancellation of the B-1
bomber and cutback in other military prog
rams in the face of what he said was a grow
ing Soviet threat.
On the possibility that he might seek to
regain the White House in two years, Ford
said in a strong voice: "Don't count me out
and don't count me in. I'm healthy, I'll be
around and I won't duck any responsibil

That drew loud applause from his audi
ence, a convention of the Independent
Truckers Association. The truckers also
applauded roundly when he added:
"Retirement isn't all that bad, and I would

arrest and conviction of the alleged arsonist
or arsonists.
The Nevada money will be paid only if the
arson conviction involves fires set in
Nevada.
The unidentified man began calling the
Tahoe Tribune last week. Before the
switchboard operator could connect him
with a reporter, he threatened to continue
setting fires in the area if California does not
drop a lawsuit against Nevada.
He never said what suit he meant.
So far, nobody has been injured in any of
the fires, and none has been reported since
Sunday.
Garbage strikes continue
Detroit's 650 garbagemen worked past
yesterday's strike deadline as negotiators
for their union and the city met in secret to
resolve differences over mandatory over
time.
In San Antonio, about 400 ex-garbagemen
and other fired city workers held a four-mile
march and rallied at City Hall to gain support
from the city council.
Rock-throwing and other sporadic vio
lence has erupted since more than half the
city's 313 sanitation workers were fired for
walking off the job Saturday and Sunday.
And in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the city's 245 gar
bagemen manned picket lines after the
mayor extended a deadline for firing them
until Monday to allow officials to investigate
charges that led to the walkout.
Regular garbage collections were made in
Detroit after union leaders allowed their
strike deadline to pass so that their
negotiators could attempt to reach agree
ment in the overtime dispute. The city con
tended that mandatory overtime is neces
sary to maintain adequate sanitation ser
vice.
The marchers in San Antonio, including
children in wagons and on roller skates and
women with baby carriages, marched
peacefully through the city to the rally out
side City Hall.
The mostly Mexican-American crowd car
ried placards in Spanish and English and
heard speeches in Spanish at the rally. The
city of 800,000 near the Mexico border has a
high population of Mexican-Americans.
