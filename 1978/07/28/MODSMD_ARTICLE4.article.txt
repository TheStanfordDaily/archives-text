# Union officials nix postal pact

Washington (AP) — Represen
tatives of 280,000 postal workers
rejected a proposed contract
yesterday, but left it up to the
rank-and-file to decide whether
to accept the settlement and
head off the possibility of a mail
strike.
National officials of the
American Postal Workers union
said they remained optimistic
that the membership would ap
prove the three-year accord de
spite the 29-15 rejection vote by
the union's national bargaining
advisory committee.
But some leaders of locals said
the committee's vote would in
fluence some members to vote
against the contract. Ballots will
be mailed, probably within a
week.
The 2-1 margin of the commit
tee's vote came as a surprise to
APWU President Emmet An-

Drews, who had said the com
mittee's sentiment was running
"50-50."
The contract would provide a
19.5 percent wage increase —
including cost-of-living adjust
ments — over three years and
retain a guarantee against
layoffs.
Postal workers in New Jersey
and California had staged illegal
walkouts in protest after the set
tlement was forged last Friday,
but most of the workers re
turned.
Some union locals rejected
the contract in informal votes.
The New York Area Postal Un
ion, the nation's largest and
most militant local, has
scheduled a strike vote for next
Monday, and some other locals
have indicated they would fol
low the New York local's deci
sion.
Postal strikes are prohibited
by federal law, which calls for
fines and jail terms for violators.
But in 1970 the New York local
led a walkout that spread to
200,000 workers across the
country.
Those strikers were not
punished. This time, the Postal
Service vows to enforce the law.
Mam objections to the prop
osed contract are that the wage
increase is inadequate and that
work rules remain too rigid,
such as mandatory overtime.
Andrews estimated that the
contract would increase the av
erage wage $3100 over three
years. About half of that would
derive from cost-of-living
boosts. The average annual
wage now is almost $16,000.
After voting to reject the con
tract, the advisory committee
voted 30 to 9 to let Andrews send
the pact to the rank-and-file.
