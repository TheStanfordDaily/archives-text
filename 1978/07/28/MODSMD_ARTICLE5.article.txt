(USE) union continued its sup
port of O.V. Hines, a Medical
Center employee who was fired
two weeks ago, by demanding a
meeting with Ron Twomey, di
rector of personnel.
A group of about 30 USE
members and hospital
employees presented a petition
bearing6s signatures toTwomey
demanding the immediate
reinstatement of Hines, a
housekeeper, and the dismissal
of Karl Hickethier, Hines' super
visor, said USE organizer Sue
Frey. Hickethierwas responsible
for Hines losing his job.
Hines had been employed at
the Medical Center for five
years. In that time he has filed
approximately 15 grievances
against the hospital and says he
has received a great deal of
harassment for coming out in
support of the USE.
Twomey, the hearing officer
for the upcoming grievance filed
by Hines upon his dismissal, re
fused to make any decisions.
"They demanded the
reinstatement of Hines, but

there was no way I could make
that decision in my position,"
said Twomey. "It's not possible
to make a reasonable decision
until all the facts have been
heard."
The group also demanded to
know why Hickethier, a white.
