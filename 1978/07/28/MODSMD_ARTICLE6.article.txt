# No arms control without rights

In a recent editorial, the Daily
advised a cau'ious response to
the trials of Shcharansky and
Ginzburg, claiming that the sec
urity of the world comes first,
and hence nothing should be al
lowed to interfere with various
arms limitation talks now in
progress.
I take issue with this belief on
the grounds that it is impossible
to divorce world security from
Soviet and American domestic
affairs.
First, while the SALT talks are
important to world security,
there is no reason to believe that
a SALT II treaty would be effec
tive in limiting the arms race.
The past two decades has seen a
series of bilateral and multilat
eral arms limitation agreements,
and yet the arms race continues
undiminished, even heightened
in pace.
And if the Soviets have such a
poor track record abiding by the
terms of the Helsinki accord on
human rights, is there any
reason to assume that the oppo
site will be true of SALT II?
Secondly, mouthing the con
ventional platitudes about our
commitment to human rights
both at home and abroad with
out following up with long-term
international political pressure
is simple hypocrisy.
World security, of both the

arms limitation human
rights varieties, requires a com
mitment by both the United
States and the Soviet Union to
examine and call a halt to the
roots of repression in one
another's societies.
No country can police itself
adequately and objectively, but
working cooperatively, perhaps
we can make the platitudes into
a reality.
So far, the Soviet Union and,
arguably, the United States,
have demonstrated a commit
ment to neither. Perhaps greater
American pressure on the
Soviets would demonstrate— to
both governments — that the
phrase "world security" is mean
ingless in the absence of one or
the other, arms control and
human rights.
