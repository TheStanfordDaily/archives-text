Why no guano?
Where has your courage
gone? Why have you dropped
the "guano" rating from your
Cinemascope section? John
Nielsen's excellent reviews usu
ally indicate very clearly that an
adjective considerably stronger
than "lousy" is necessary to de
scribe some movies.
Moreover, while correctly im
plying that TV is intolerable, the
ratings system in your issue of
July 21 quite ridiculously
suggests that it would be inaccu
rate to say that TV is lousy.
Hollywood continuously tries
to foist upon us the most execr
able abominations; why not tell
the truth about this guano?

Editor's note: The Daily also
realized the virtues of the
"guano" label on certain intoler
able movies. But Mr. Nielsen's
persistent efforts to enlarge the
black smudge presented us with
a dilemma: we could allow John
to enlarge the guanos until they
engulfed the entire page, we
could get rid of the guano rating
or we could fire the bum.
After a long and difficult pro
cess we decided to drop the
guano for the less descriptive
but less problematic rating of
"lousy."
We also kept Nielsen for
humanitarian reasons.
Noise pollution
Is it really necessary that a
trash truck has to do its noisy job
at 6 a.m.? Especailly after the
Fourth of July?
There is too much noise poll u
tion on campus: grasscutting
(not necessary to do so often
and especially not at 7 a.m.),
water sprinklers, trucks, con
struction work, etc.
Please, save summer students
from noise.
