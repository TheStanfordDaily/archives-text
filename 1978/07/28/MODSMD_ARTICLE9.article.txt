# Anti-nuclear struggle continues

Over the past couple of years a
great deal of attention has been
directed toward Stanford's in
vestment policy in South Africa.
While this is indeed a very im
portant issue there is another
one equally deserving of the
Stanford community's concern,
one that has a much more direct
relevance to our everyday lives.
This is the issue of nuclear
energy.
The nuclear controversy has
been steadily rising in impor
tance on the national and inter
national scenes. Protests and ac
tions, involving tens and at
times, hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators have occurred in
Germany, France, Spain, Japan
and elsewhere.
During the past months there
have been several demonstra
tions across the nation protest
ing against nuclear power in
general and the construction of
nuclear power plants in particu
lar. The largest of these, spon
sored by the Clamshell Alliance,
recently drew over 10,000
people near the site of New
Hampshire's Seabrook Nuclear
Plant.
Nuclear power is admittedly a
complex issue. But it is a very
vital one concerning the health
and well-being of all of us, and of
future generations. The building
of a nuclear power plant has so
cial, economic, environmental
and health implications an order

of magnitude greater than the
construction of ordinary fossil
fuel or hydroelectric power
plants.
Briefly, the principal argu
ments against nuclear power are
that it is unsafe, unclean, un
economical and that there exist
real alternatives to it. Since the
first nuclear plantwas built there
have been numerous accidents
in several plants, including near
meltdowns in at least a couple of
cases.
The Nuciear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) has admitted
that since 1969 there has been
over 400 accidents at commer
cial nuclear plants, releasing
millions of curies of radioactive
gases and liquids directly into
the environment. A major acci
dent such as a meltdown would
release the radioactive equiva
lent of 1000 Hiroshima size
bombs, causing 27,000 im
mediate deaths, 73,000 injuries
and $17 million in property dam
age.
The problems with nuclear
energy abound. At this time,
government reports declare,
there is no safe way to dispose of
radioactive waste. The threat of
sabotage or theft of nuclear
fuel/waste creates a situation re
quiring police-state security
measures which threaten fun
damental civil liberties.
Nuclear power further con
centrates energy resources and

profits in the hands of a few
powerful corporations. The
spread of nuclear technologies
and reactors internationally will
result in the proliferation of nuc
lear weapons capability and a
corresponding large rise in the
probability of nuclear war.
Furthermore, nuclear power
is not cheap, and it gets more
expensive every year. Uranium
prices have more than quad
rupled since 1972 and reactor
construction costs are also
skyrocketing. Finally, contrary
to the claims of nuclear propo
nents, studies show that the nuc
lear industry offers far less jobs
over the long run than what
would be created if we based
our energy policy on alternative
renewable energy technologies.
And immediate alternatives to
nuclear generated electricity do
exist. These include solar heat
ing and cooling, wind energy,
biomass conversion, solar photo
voltaic cells and other solar elec
tric technolgies, co-generation,
and energy conservation.
It is not my intention here,
however, to go into a lengthy
debate. There is a growing body
of literature covering all aspects
of the nuclear energy issue (see
for example: Peter Faulkner,
"The Silent Bomb"; John Gof
man and Arthur Templin,
"Poisoned Power: the Case
Against Nuclear Power Plants";
Barry Commoner, "The Poverty
of Power"; Amory Lovins and
John Price, "Non-Nuclear Fu
tures: The Case for an Ethical
Energy Strategy").
I do want to make people
aware of the fact that there are
many people around the state
that are actively engaged in try
ing to stop nuclear energy in
California. These people, or
ganized in a federation of local
anti-nuclear groups, called the
Abalone Alliance are sponsoring
af\ occupation/demonstration at
the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant
near San Luis Obispo, on Aug. 6.
The Diablo Canyon plant is lo
cated less than three miles from
the active off-shore San
Simeon-Hosgri fault, which the
U.S. Geological Survey says has
a potential for a 7.5 (on the Rich
ter scale) earthquake.
The Abalone Alliance believes
that the Diablo plant is not safe
and cannot be made safe. Yet
the NRC intends to grant PG&E a
license to operate it. PG&E is
aiming to have the Diablo reac
tors on line by next spring. The
Abalone Alliance is aiming to

stop them.
The day on Aug. 6 will begin at
noon on Port San Luis Beach
with a commemoration of the
1945 Hiroshima bombing led by
Buddhist monks. A rally will fa
ture well-known speakers and
musicians, including Dr. John
Gofman, past associate director
of the Lawrence Livermore Labs;
David Brower, director of
Friends of the Earth; and Raye
Fleming, one of the original legal
intervenors in the fight against
the Diablo Canyon plant.
There will be exhibits, de
monstrations and workshops at
a day-long alternative energy
fair. Musicians, poets and
theatre-groups have volun
teered their time and talents.
Later in the day, affinity
groups trained in nonviolence
will blockade the plant gate and
enter the site in an attempt to
halt construction. Some will
carry trees and solar energy
equipment in a gesture of trans
formation.
Those interested in more in
formation, or who want to par
ticipate, need transportation
and/or childcare should contact
CANE (Citizens for Alternatives
to Nuclear Energy), phone: (415)
494-0363, or write to CANE, 3680
Bryant Street, Palo Alto, CA
94306. There will also be a table

Over the past couple of years a
great deal of attention has been
directed toward Stanford's in
vestment policy in South Africa.
While this is indeed a very im
portant issue there is another
one equally deserving of the
Stanford community's concern,
one that has a much more direct
relevance to our everyday lives.
This is the issue of nuclear
energy.
The nuclear controversy has
been steadily rising in impor
tance on the national and inter
national scenes. Protests and ac
tions, involving tens and at
times, hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators have occurred in
Germany, France, Spain, Japan
and elsewhere.
During the past months there
have been several demonstra
tions across the nation protest
ing against nuclear power in
general and the construction of
nuclear power plants in particu
lar. The largest of these, spon
sored by the Clamshell Alliance,
recently drew over 10,000
people near the site of New
Hampshire's Seabrook Nuclear
Plant.
Nuclear power is admittedly a
complex issue. But it is a very
vital one concerning the health
and well-being of all of us, and of
future generations. The building
of a nuclear power plant has so
cial, economic, environmental
and health implications an order

of magnitude greater than the
construction of ordinary fossil
fuel or hydroelectric power
plants.
Briefly, the principal argu
ments against nuclear power are
that it is unsafe, unclean, un
economical and that there exist
real alternatives to it. Since the
first nuclear plantwas built there
have been numerous accidents
in several plants, including near
meltdowns in at least a couple of
cases.
The Nuciear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) has admitted
that since 1969 there has been
over 400 accidents at commer
cial nuclear plants, releasing
millions of curies of radioactive
gases and liquids directly into
the environment. A major acci
dent such as a meltdown would
release the radioactive equiva
lent of 1000 Hiroshima size
bombs, causing 27,000 im
mediate deaths, 73,000 injuries
and $17 million in property dam
age.
The problems with nuclear
energy abound. At this time,
government reports declare,
there is no safe way to dispose of
radioactive waste. The threat of
sabotage or theft of nuclear
fuel/waste creates a situation re
quiring police-state security
measures which threaten fun
damental civil liberties.
Nuclear power further con
centrates energy resources and

profits in the hands of a few
powerful corporations. The
spread of nuclear technologies
and reactors internationally will
result in the proliferation of nuc
lear weapons capability and a
corresponding large rise in the
probability of nuclear war.
Furthermore, nuclear power
is not cheap, and it gets more
expensive every year. Uranium
prices have more than quad
rupled since 1972 and reactor
construction costs are also
skyrocketing. Finally, contrary
to the claims of nuclear propo
nents, studies show that the nuc
lear industry offers far less jobs
over the long run than what
would be created if we based
our energy policy on alternative
renewable energy technologies.
And immediate alternatives to
nuclear generated electricity do
exist. These include solar heat
ing and cooling, wind energy,
biomass conversion, solar photo
voltaic cells and other solar elec
tric technolgies, co-generation,
and energy conservation.
It is not my intention here,
however, to go into a lengthy
debate. There is a growing body
of literature covering all aspects
of the nuclear energy issue (see
for example: Peter Faulkner,
"The Silent Bomb"; John Gof
man and Arthur Templin,
"Poisoned Power: the Case
Against Nuclear Power Plants";
Barry Commoner, "The Poverty
of Power"; Amory Lovins and
John Price, "Non-Nuclear Fu
tures: The Case for an Ethical
Energy Strategy").
I do want to make people
aware of the fact that there are
many people around the state
that are actively engaged in try
ing to stop nuclear energy in
California. These people, or
ganized in a federation of local
anti-nuclear groups, called the
Abalone Alliance are sponsoring
af\ occupation/demonstration at
the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant
near San Luis Obispo, on Aug. 6.
The Diablo Canyon plant is lo
cated less than three miles from
the active off-shore San
Simeon-Hosgri fault, which the
U.S. Geological Survey says has
a potential for a 7.5 (on the Rich
ter scale) earthquake.
The Abalone Alliance believes
that the Diablo plant is not safe
and cannot be made safe. Yet
the NRC intends to grant PG&E a
license to operate it. PG&E is
aiming to have the Diablo reac
tors on line by next spring. The
Abalone Alliance is aiming to

stop them.
The day on Aug. 6 will begin at
noon on Port San Luis Beach
with a commemoration of the
1945 Hiroshima bombing led by
Buddhist monks. A rally will fa
ture well-known speakers and
musicians, including Dr. John
Gofman, past associate director
of the Lawrence Livermore Labs;
David Brower, director of
Friends of the Earth; and Raye
Fleming, one of the original legal
intervenors in the fight against
the Diablo Canyon plant.
There will be exhibits, de
monstrations and workshops at
a day-long alternative energy
fair. Musicians, poets and
theatre-groups have volun
teered their time and talents.
Later in the day, affinity
groups trained in nonviolence
will blockade the plant gate and
enter the site in an attempt to
halt construction. Some will
carry trees and solar energy
equipment in a gesture of trans
formation.
Those interested in more in
formation, or who want to par
ticipate, need transportation
and/or childcare should contact
CANE (Citizens for Alternatives
to Nuclear Energy), phone: (415)
494-0363, or write to CANE, 3680
Bryant Street, Palo Alto, CA
94306. There will also be a table
out on White Plaza, this week
where people should feel free to
drop by.
