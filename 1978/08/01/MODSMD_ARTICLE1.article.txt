# Peer advising starts in fall
## 
### Vickie Evangel 
An organization of peer ad
visors will work with house as
sociates next fall to advise
freshmen on academics, said
Greg Larson, a former ASSU
co-president.
A group of 10 students have
been selected to work as advisor
assistants (AAs) in all-freshmen
Trancos House in September.
"Because resident associates
(RAs) cannot possibly know
about all the specific depart
ments and academic interests of
students, peer advisors will be
beneficial to freshmen," said
project worker Pat Nabti.
Nabti said that "through their
own experiences, AAs will be

able to give students a perspec
tive on their education."
The student advisors maintain
different majors and will be as
signed to work with about ten
freshmen according to majors
and interests. The advisors will
help students select classes, in
structors and majors, and define
their goals. Problems in
academic programs, such as
probation or suspension may
also be directed toward the AA,
explained Larson.
The assistant advisors prog
ram is new except to medical
and engineering students.
The ASSU Council of Presi
dents took a survey among
sophomores, juniors and

seniors last spring and found
they strongly recommended
that an academic advising prog
ram be initiated in the fall.
Larson is working with two
other students and Asst. Under
graduate Studies Dean Alexan
der Fetter in developing the peer
advising program. If the prog
ram is successful this fall, it may
be expanded throughout the
campus to benefit all freshmen,
implied Larson.
"Training is now in process for
the 10 selected AAs," said Lar
son. The advisors will begin their
work during orientation week
when meetings to assign stu
dents to advisors will take place.
