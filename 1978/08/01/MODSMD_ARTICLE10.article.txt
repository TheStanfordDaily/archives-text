# Stranded travelers jam French airports

### 
London — Hundreds of
thousands of travelers jammed
European airports Monday as a
slowdown by French air traffic
controllers and a flood of Ameri
can and Canadian passengers
fighting for standby seats across
the Atlantic threw air travel
facilities into chaos.
British authorities said only 16
flights an hour were being al
lowed through French airspace,
a fraction of the normal traffic.
France lies in the heart of West
ern Europe and some of the
most heavily traveled air routes
cross French territory.
"This chaos is threatening air
transport as a reliable and seri
ous trade," said Hans Erik Chris
tensen, station manager at De
nmark's Billund Airport, as
flights continued to pile up after
the third straight weekend of
slowdown by the French con
trollers.
Aage Riis Johansen, president
of the Danish Air Controllers'
Association, defended his
French colleagues, saying, "This
is first of all a matter of safety in
the air." He said that in France
there are too few air controllers
to handle the traffic with "rather
outdated" equipment.
The French controllers union
meets Wednesday to decide
what future action to take. They
are demanding modernized
equipment and more personnel,
which they claim are essential

for passenger safety, as well as
an improved pay structure.
Thousands of Americans and
Canadians swelled airport and
ticket office queues in Britain,
pitching camp for waits of up to
eight days for cut-rate standby
seats home. With longer and
longer waits, the cut-price
crowd was getting more or
ganized and less rancorous,
since, after all, they had ex
pected to take their chances and
wait in lines.
But for Britons with a precious
week or 10 days to spend on
some sunny beach it was a diffe
rent story — and as if in moc
kery, Monday's gray skies
sprayed cold rain on England all
day.
"It started off as a bit of a joke,
but the novelty has long since
worn off," said Sheilagh
McLaughlin, 18, reclining on the
terminal floor at Manchester
Airport in England where she
had been waiting since Saturday
morning for a flight to Majorca.
More than 3000 would-be
travelers slept there Sunday
night, and when hundreds more
arrived Monday, one official
said: "There are very few spaces
left in the terminal for anyone to
squeeze into."
At the other end, 70 airplanes
were stacked up at Palma de
Majorca airport and departing at
one an hour rather than the cus
tomary 500 a day.
