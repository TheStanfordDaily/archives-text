# Sun, beer, and everybody's crazy
## Life in the bleachers at Candlestick Park 
### John Nielsen 
The man next to us brought his
own beer. He had a plastic ther
mos full of Miller stuck under his
coat. It lasted him and his wife
until roughly the seventh inning,
at which point the two of them
began looking for one of the
vendors, who were everywhere,
from time to time they turned
and talked to us about the game,
or about the beer, and they were
very pleasant sounding even
though it was impossible to un
derstand anything they said due
to the accents that became
heavier with each inning. . .
A chance to be part of the life
in the bleachers at Candlestick
I'ark is worth considerably more
than a dollar. After a little trou
ble earlier this year with an iso

lated group ot cherry-bomb and
what-not throwers, the
bleachers are back at full
strength. As if the San Francisco
Giants in and of themselves are
not enough to keep you going,
there are considerable other di
versions present. And only a few
extra steps need be taken. They
are as follows:
1) Show up early. Watch bat
ting practice. Not only will this
enable you to miss out on the
agony of parking defeat, it will
make visible a spectacle at least
as exciting as the ninth inning of
a seventh world series game.
Said spectacle is called Watching
the Little Kids Catch Balls Hit
Over the Fence. Though the lit
tle kids in question often stand
upwards of six feet tall (and the
big ones always have mitts), the

size of the group shoots proba
bility to hell.
No one that you expect to get
the ball ever actually gets the
ball.
On jersey days and other such
occasions there are bound to be
nearly a thousand innocent
looking young persons hanging
around in the vicinity of the
fence, appearing polite, and
even docile, but it's easy to tell
what's bound to happen the first
time lack Clark puts a practice
shot over. You can see from the
thinly-veiled look of terror in the
eyes of the lone security guard
watching the area between the
fence and the stands that the
kiddies are ready to enter his ter
ritory, and that when they do
they will not walk out in single
file.

When somebody hits a prac
tice home run the tiny ones
explode, crashing over the rail
ing, stampeding towards the
ball. When they get there they
begin to beat each other up in an
effort to get at it. It takes about
thirty seconds, and then things
subside, but the security guard
is rarely the same.
2) It's also fun to roast your
self. Unlike the rich yahoos in
the shady box seats the pro
letariat sits in the sun, and most
of the time most of the crowd
makes the best of this opportun
ity. Everybody wants to get a tan,
even though it generally turns
out to be more like a third de
gree burn — nobody seems to
care that you can only expose
one side. After the game you can
calculate where someone sat by

checking out his burnt-to-a
crisp-side; a bacon twist right
shoulder means the left-field
line, and vice-versa. Needless to
say such heat creates an over
whelming desire to drink —
beer vendors occasionally lose
their supply before making it
down half an aisle. The beer, of
course, is too expensive, but no
one seems to care after the first
few innings.
3) Check out the crowd. It can
be endlessly fascinating to wait
for the guy staggering around in
the tank top to start a fight, or to
watch the evil dopers two rows
down smoke themselves into a
coma. After all, they've probably
already checked you out, and
come to similarly simpleminded
conclusions. It doesn't hurt to
peg the big guy as an organized
criminal as long as you don't let
on that you know. It is of course
impossible to predict whether
the people on either side of you
would enjoy a little conversa
tion, but it only infrequently
hurts to try, and more often is
very rewarding. There's nothing
like a baseball argument in
Candlestick, unless you happen
to be a Dodger fan. Dodger fans
should ignore all suggestions
made here. They should shut
up, wear disguises, and hope no
one notices their hats.)
There are other things to do in
the bleachers, of course, such as
watching the baseball game. But
that's only for the hard-core
among us.
The people with the accent
jumped up like everybody else,
and stuck their hands in the air -
everyone had great hope at the
same time they had great terror.
But the foul ball didn't hit any
one in the head. It bounced off a
big guy's mitt, and rolled under
some seats, and then a little kid
stole it from a vendor. Everyone
cheered, even though it was a
foul ball.


The bleachers at Candlestick Park offer a plethora of things to do besides
watt h the Giants bat and pitch their way to the World Series. Aside from

mad scrambles for bullpen mishits, there's plenty of beer to imbibe and
people to tell stories about.
