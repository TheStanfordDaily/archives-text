## Movies/elliot klein Disney's 'Fantasia' merits a second look 
### 
Chances are that you've al
ready seen Walt Disney's Fan
tasia. Maybe you caught a seg
ment on the Mickey Mouse Club
TV show when you were ten, or
maybe your mother took all the
kids on the block to see it one
rainy afternoon. And chances
are good that you remember a
snippet or two, maybe Mickey
Mouse as the Sorcerer's Appren
tice or the part with that one lit
tle Chinese mushroom who
couldn't keep up with the
others. Yes, Fantasia has been
seen by generations of American
children. So I hope you won't
snort "kid stuff!" when I tell you
that Fantasia is now showing at
the Regency in San Francisco

and is definitely worth a revisit.
In the thirty-nine years since
its first release, Fantasia has
never totally disappeared from
the re-run circuit. But it's still a
joy to sit in a first-run house and
experience Fantasia for the plum
of a movie it is. How many films
are there, after all, which are de
signed to give pure and sumptu
ous pleasure to the senses? It was
Disney's goal to blend musicand
animated images — not neces
sarily to interpret the music, but
to create a freely imaginitive
world of color, movement, and
cartoon invention — hence, the
title, Fantasia. And as long as
Disney's artists kept their inspi
ration within the bounds of

abstract forms or on the level of
comic shenanigans, they pro
duced moments of innocent,
gorgeous, silly fun. They expres
sed that music's character as
well as any choreographer.
The wizard they conceived for
the Sorcerer's Apprentice
episode conjures every fearful
image we ever had as children,
as much as apprentice Mickey's
gleeful self-confidence still
coaxes our sympathetic laugh
ter. Nowhere has there ever
been a better sound and sight
representation of an orchestra
tuning up. And nowhere have
hippos danced in frilly tutus with
quite the grace they muster in
Disney's version of the Dance of

the Hours. All told, Fantasia at its
best is a feast for the senses, a
film of unabashed beauty and
good spirits which would be
nearly impossible to produce in
our more cynical age.
Preserved print
Of course, Disney was a great
innovator in everything he did,
and the freshness of Fantasia
today owes much to the techni
cal innovation behind its con
ception. It must have been
dazzling for audiences in 1940,
in an era when color films were
still quite new, to watch the sub
tle and brilliant effects achieved
by Disney — and I'm happy to
report that the print of Fantasia
on view at the Regency has been

well preserved. Likewise, in a
period when animation was still
a painstaking process requiring
that every frame be individually
drawn, it must have seemed a
wonder to watch abstract and
natural forms move so smoothly
— and this was well before the
age of Star Wars computer ani
mation. Most stunning of all
perhaps is the soundtrack of
Fantasia. Long before franchise
chain stores were to bring hi-fi
gear to every college dormitory
room in America, Disney was
experimenting with a multitrack
recording process. Although the
current score is remixed from
the original half-dozen or more
tracks, the night I saw Fantasia
the audience gasped as the pon
derous opening chords of
Bach's Toccata and Fugue thun
dered out in directional sound.
All this must have been a revela
