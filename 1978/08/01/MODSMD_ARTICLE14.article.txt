## Movies/elliot klein Disney's 'Fantasia' merits a second look 
### 
Chances are that you've al
ready seen Walt Disney's Fan
tasia. Maybe you caught a seg
ment on the Mickey Mouse Club
TV show when you were ten, or
maybe your mother took all the
kids on the block to see it one
rainy afternoon. And chances
are good that you remember a
snippet or two, maybe Mickey
Mouse as the Sorcerer's Appren
tice or the part with that one lit
tle Chinese mushroom who
couldn't keep up with the
others. Yes, Fantasia has been
seen by generations of American
children. So I hope you won't
snort "kid stuff!" when I tell you
that Fantasia is now showing at
the Regency in San Francisco

and is definitely worth a revisit.
In the thirty-nine years since
its first release, Fantasia has
never totally disappeared from
the re-run circuit. But it's still a
joy to sit in a first-run house and
experience Fantasia for the plum
of a movie it is. How many films
are there, after all, which are de
signed to give pure and sumptu
ous pleasure to the senses? It was
Disney's goal to blend musicand
animated images — not neces
sarily to interpret the music, but
to create a freely imaginitive
world of color, movement, and
cartoon invention — hence, the
title, Fantasia. And as long as
Disney's artists kept their inspi
ration within the bounds of

abstract forms or on the level of
comic shenanigans, they pro
duced moments of innocent,
gorgeous, silly fun. They expres
sed that music's character as
well as any choreographer.
The wizard they conceived for
the Sorcerer's Apprentice
episode conjures every fearful
image we ever had as children,
as much as apprentice Mickey's
gleeful self-confidence still
coaxes our sympathetic laugh
ter. Nowhere has there ever
been a better sound and sight
representation of an orchestra
tuning up. And nowhere have
hippos danced in frilly tutus with
quite the grace they muster in
Disney's version of the Dance of

the Hours. All told, Fantasia at its
best is a feast for the senses, a
film of unabashed beauty and
good spirits which would be
nearly impossible to produce in
our more cynical age.
Preserved print
Of course, Disney was a great
innovator in everything he did,
and the freshness of Fantasia
today owes much to the techni
cal innovation behind its con
ception. It must have been
dazzling for audiences in 1940,
in an era when color films were
still quite new, to watch the sub
tle and brilliant effects achieved
by Disney — and I'm happy to
report that the print of Fantasia
on view at the Regency has been

well preserved. Likewise, in a
period when animation was still
a painstaking process requiring
that every frame be individually
drawn, it must have seemed a
wonder to watch abstract and
natural forms move so smoothly
— and this was well before the
age of Star Wars computer ani
mation. Most stunning of all
perhaps is the soundtrack of
Fantasia. Long before franchise
chain stores were to bring hi-fi
gear to every college dormitory
room in America, Disney was
experimenting with a multitrack
recording process. Although the
current score is remixed from
the original half-dozen or more
tracks, the night I saw Fantasia
the audience gasped as the pon
derous opening chords of
Bach's Toccata and Fugue thun
dered out in directional sound.
All this must have been a revela
tion in 1940 when shellac re-
I cords and clunky table radios
were the order of the day.
[ Not surprisingly, in its present
re-release, Fantasia is being
promoted as the "ultimate trip."
Its distributors obviously
Jjfcouldn't help going after those
apsychoedelic bucks. But it
112 seems an injustice to Fantasia's
l creators and a sop to gullible au
f diences to imply that the film
j shares the values of drug
oriented youth. Fantasia is just
too square a movie for that, too
much a product of Depression
America's puritanism and Hol
lywood's scrubbed-clean family
fun.
Vet the squareness of the film
canbeatrip in itself. There is just
enough stylistic kitsch to make
Fantasia betray its age. And
while this film certainly has its
lapses in taste, they are interest
ing lapses which stem from that
morality^which rolled over Dis
ney's movies like underarm
deodorant, keepingthem bland,

unoffensive, non-explicit and
sanitized.
For example, the Pastoral
Symphony sequence, set to
Beethoven's music, is intended
as a wry tribute to classical pagan
mythology. Its theme is spring's
awakening and sensuality, but
the sequence comes off like a
spoof written by sophomores
who smirk at something they
don't understand. Usually Dis
ney opts for good old
deodorized family-style sex such
as would have warmed the heart
of Louis B. Mayer.
If Disney, with his stilted mor
ality, is ill-equipped to represent
sensuality, he is equally out of
his league when trying to illus
trate the great abstractions of
existence. Who would have
thought that Stravinsky's Rite of
Spring could become the musi
cal backdrop for a pictorial dis
sertation on evolution?
In other words, its just when
Fantasia pretends to be arty or
profound that its spell collapses.

So, not surprisingly, when Dis
ney tries to come to terms with
classical music, he falls on some
intriguing contradictions, all of
which pertain to an era in
America when highbrow culture
was even more misunderstood
and mistrusted than it is today.
At one extreme, Disney upholds
the middle-class image of classi
cal music as lofty and mystic; the
conductor Leopold Stokowski
mounts the podium like a god,
his hair haloed in golden light
and his silhouetted hands too
angelic to be flesh. But Disney is
careful to include a sequence in
which members of the orchestra
play a boogie version of Beeth
oven, proving that symphony
musicians are just plain folks.
Well, this is all sublime
hokum, real Americana, and if
anything, it should add to the
fun of seeing Fantasia in 1978.
Just don't go expecting the ulti
mate trip to Space-Out City. Co
for a wonderful journey across
the time barrier of pop culture.

'Beach Blanket Babylon Goes to the Stars' boasts some outrageous costumes and some ridiculous and
unbelieveable head pieces (these coconuts are nothing compared to the head piece in the finale . . . that
one includes the entire San Francisco skyline .. .). BBBGttS is currently enjoying what will undoubtedly
be a long, long run at the Club Fugazi, 678 Green in S.F. Call 421-4222 for reservations.

lapses in taste, they are interest
ing lapses which stem from that
morality^which rolled over Dis
ney's movies like underarm
deodorant, keepingthem bland,

unoffensive, non-explicit and
sanitized.
For example, the Pastoral
Symphony sequence, set to
Beethoven's music, is intended
as a wry tribute to classical pagan
mythology. Its theme is spring's
awakening and sensuality, but
the sequence comes off like a
spoof written by sophomores
who smirk at something they
don't understand. Usually Dis
ney opts for good old
deodorized family-style sex such
as would have warmed the heart
of Louis B. Mayer.
If Disney, with his stilted mor
ality, is ill-equipped to represent
sensuality, he is equally out of
his league when trying to illus
trate the great abstractions of
existence. Who would have
thought that Stravinsky's Rite of
Spring could become the musi
cal backdrop for a pictorial dis
sertation on evolution?
In other words, its just when
Fantasia pretends to be arty or
profound that its spell collapses.

So, not surprisingly, when Dis
ney tries to come to terms with
classical music, he falls on some
intriguing contradictions, all of
which pertain to an era in
America when highbrow culture
was even more misunderstood
and mistrusted than it is today.
At one extreme, Disney upholds
the middle-class image of classi
cal music as lofty and mystic; the
conductor Leopold Stokowski
mounts the podium like a god,
his hair haloed in golden light
and his silhouetted hands too
angelic to be flesh. But Disney is
careful to include a sequence in
which members of the orchestra
play a boogie version of Beeth
oven, proving that symphony
musicians are just plain folks.
Well, this is all sublime
hokum, real Americana, and if
anything, it should add to the
fun of seeing Fantasia in 1978.
Just don't go expecting the ulti
mate trip to Space-Out City. Co
for a wonderful journey across
the time barrier of pop culture.

'Beach Blanket Babylon Goes to the Stars' boasts some outrageous costumes and some ridiculous and
unbelieveable head pieces (these coconuts are nothing compared to the head piece in the finale . . . that
one includes the entire San Francisco skyline .. .). BBBGttS is currently enjoying what will undoubtedly
be a long, long run at the Club Fugazi, 678 Green in S.F. Call 421-4222 for reservations.
Chances are that you've al
ready seen Walt Disney's Fan
tasia. Maybe you caught a seg
ment on the Mickey Mouse Club
TV show when you were ten, or
maybe your mother took all the
kids on the block to see it one
rainy afternoon. And chances
are good that you remember a
snippet or two, maybe Mickey
Mouse as the Sorcerer's Appren
tice or the part with that one lit
tle Chinese mushroom who
couldn't keep up with the
others. Yes, Fantasia has been
seen by generations of American
children. So I hope you won't
snort "kid stuff!" when I tell you
that Fantasia is now showing at
the Regency in San Francisco

and is definitely worth a revisit.
In the thirty-nine years since
its first release, Fantasia has
never totally disappeared from
the re-run circuit. But it's still a
joy to sit in a first-run house and
experience Fantasia for the plum
of a movie it is. How many films
are there, after all, which are de
signed to give pure and sumptu
ous pleasure to the senses? It was
Disney's goal to blend musicand
animated images — not neces
sarily to interpret the music, but
to create a freely imaginitive
world of color, movement, and
cartoon invention — hence, the
title, Fantasia. And as long as
Disney's artists kept their inspi
ration within the bounds of

abstract forms or on the level of
comic shenanigans, they pro
duced moments of innocent,
gorgeous, silly fun. They expres
sed that music's character as
well as any choreographer.
The wizard they conceived for
the Sorcerer's Apprentice
episode conjures every fearful
image we ever had as children,
as much as apprentice Mickey's
gleeful self-confidence still
coaxes our sympathetic laugh
ter. Nowhere has there ever
been a better sound and sight
representation of an orchestra
tuning up. And nowhere have
hippos danced in frilly tutus with
quite the grace they muster in
Disney's version of the Dance of

the Hours. All told, Fantasia at its
best is a feast for the senses, a
film of unabashed beauty and
good spirits which would be
nearly impossible to produce in
our more cynical age.
Preserved print
Of course, Disney was a great
innovator in everything he did,
and the freshness of Fantasia
today owes much to the techni
cal innovation behind its con
ception. It must have been
dazzling for audiences in 1940,
in an era when color films were
still quite new, to watch the sub
tle and brilliant effects achieved
by Disney — and I'm happy to
report that the print of Fantasia
on view at the Regency has been

well preserved. Likewise, in a
period when animation was still
a painstaking process requiring
that every frame be individually
drawn, it must have seemed a
wonder to watch abstract and
natural forms move so smoothly
— and this was well before the
age of Star Wars computer ani
mation. Most stunning of all
perhaps is the soundtrack of
Fantasia. Long before franchise
chain stores were to bring hi-fi
gear to every college dormitory
room in America, Disney was
experimenting with a multitrack
recording process. Although the
current score is remixed from
the original half-dozen or more
tracks, the night I saw Fantasia
the audience gasped as the pon
derous opening chords of
Bach's Toccata and Fugue thun
dered out in directional sound.
All this must have been a revela
tion in 1940 when shellac re-
I cords and clunky table radios
were the order of the day.
[ Not surprisingly, in its present
re-release, Fantasia is being
promoted as the "ultimate trip."
Its distributors obviously
Jjfcouldn't help going after those
apsychoedelic bucks. But it
112 seems an injustice to Fantasia's
l creators and a sop to gullible au
f diences to imply that the film
j shares the values of drug
oriented youth. Fantasia is just
too square a movie for that, too
much a product of Depression
America's puritanism and Hol
lywood's scrubbed-clean family
fun.
Vet the squareness of the film
canbeatrip in itself. There is just
enough stylistic kitsch to make
Fantasia betray its age. And

ing lapses which stem from that
