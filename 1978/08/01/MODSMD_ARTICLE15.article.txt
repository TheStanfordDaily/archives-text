## Good times in S.F. 
### 
It's not often these days that a
piece of pure fluff can legiti
mately call itself "entertain
ment" and run for years and
years and get away with charging
$7 or $8 a head. Not too many
shows have that kind of staying
power, and San Francisco audi
ences are not among the most
patient in the world. But at the
City's Club Fugazi, a little revue
called "Beach Blanket Babylon
Goes to the Stars" (BBBGttS)
goes on and on and on, raking in
moneyand delightingaudiences
with its craziness, camp, and un
abashed corniness.
It began in 1974 with "Beach
Blanket Babylon," which
evolved into "Beach Blanket
Babylon Goes Bananas," which
ran for nearly three years.
"BBBGttS" opened June 26, and
if audience response is any indi
cation of a show's possible
longevity, this one will outlive
us all. The crowd at the club
went wild.
Loose plot
The plot (and I use the term
loosely)concerns sweet Snow
White who wants to leave San
Francisco for Hollywood to find
herself a prince. Snow, played
by Penny Hamilton, has the un
derwater warble of her
namesake in the original Disney
movie and an automaton-like
walk remniscent of C3PO in
"Star Wars." On her way to Tin
seltown she meets lots of
strange characters who give
meaningless advice and do a lot
of singing and dancing, but in
the end, Snow realizes that she
doesn't have to stray outside her
own backyard. She forgets Hol
lywood and sings a rousing tri
bute to San Francisco.
That is the plot of BBBGttS.
Complicated it's not, but there is
enough to last 80 minutes and
accomodate what seems like 200
songs, from "As Time Goes By"
to "Stayin' Alive." The produc
tion is sleek and flashy and
loaded with color, and the out
landish costumes and headgear
(there is an obvious obsession
with headgear) are works of art
you'll never see in a museum.
Ever seen someone belt out a
song with a giant basket of
french fries on her head? Ever
seen someone try to render an
emotional "There's No Business

Like Show Business" dressed as
an envelope? There's a lot in
BBBGttS that you've never seen
and probably will never see
anywhere else. This is the most
original and creative mingling of
kitsch and camp to hit the thea
ter scene in a long, long time.
Frenetic pace
The talented troupe of
singer-dancers who perform
BBBGttS are for the most part
young and attractive and over
flowing with energy, but not
even they can keep up with the
frenetic pace BBBGttS sets in its
first fifteen minutes. During the
first few scenes, one question
ran repeatedly through my
thoughts: do these people
shoot up before each show?
They scramble on stage, do a few
kicks, sing a few bars, say a few
words and speed off all before
you get a chance to focus your
eyes and see who it it. Every line
is a punch line, every costume is
an eye-popper, every song is a
familiar hit. This predilection for
overkill is apparent throughout
the production, though it tones
down a bit after the first half
hour or so. Nevertheless, the
performers are kept so busy
hoofing and huffing and hoof
ing, they hardly have time to
enjoy themselves, which is a
shame.
The Club Fugazi is a cute little
cabaret which seats 299 people
and serves beer and wine. The
stage is very small, but the cos
tumes are so bright and the
amplification system is so good
that you will see and hear almost
everything. There is an excel
lent group of musicians, all of
whom wear large pink rabbit
ears and play mighty fine music.
The service at the club is friendly
and the atmosphere is good, al
though this is the season for
drunken out-of-towners and
you might be crammed in next to
a sloshed foursome from
Fresno. Don't pay any attention
to them, just sit back and pre
pare to lose yourself in the total
mindlessness of BBBGttS. It's
fantasy, it's escapism, and it's
real, honest-to-God, old
fashioned entertainment. Those
folks up there really pump ev
erything they've got into
BBBGttS. You definitely get your
money's worth.

The service at the club is friendly
and the atmosphere is good, al
though this is the season for
drunken out-of-towners and
you might be crammed in next to
a sloshed foursome from
Fresno. Don't pay any attention
to them, just sit back and pre
pare to lose yourself in the total
mindlessness of BBBGttS. It's
fantasy, it's escapism, and it's
real, honest-to-God, old
fashioned entertainment. Those
folks up there really pump ev
erything they've got into
BBBGttS. You definitely get your
money's worth.
It's not often these days that a
piece of pure fluff can legiti
mately call itself "entertain
ment" and run for years and
years and get away with charging
$7 or $8 a head. Not too many
shows have that kind of staying
power, and San Francisco audi
ences are not among the most
patient in the world. But at the
City's Club Fugazi, a little revue
called "Beach Blanket Babylon
Goes to the Stars" (BBBGttS)
goes on and on and on, raking in
moneyand delightingaudiences
with its craziness, camp, and un
abashed corniness.
It began in 1974 with "Beach
Blanket Babylon," which
evolved into "Beach Blanket
Babylon Goes Bananas," which
ran for nearly three years.
"BBBGttS" opened June 26, and
if audience response is any indi
cation of a show's possible
longevity, this one will outlive
us all. The crowd at the club
went wild.
Loose plot
The plot (and I use the term
loosely)concerns sweet Snow
White who wants to leave San
Francisco for Hollywood to find
herself a prince. Snow, played
by Penny Hamilton, has the un
derwater warble of her
namesake in the original Disney
movie and an automaton-like
walk remniscent of C3PO in
"Star Wars." On her way to Tin
seltown she meets lots of
strange characters who give
meaningless advice and do a lot
of singing and dancing, but in
the end, Snow realizes that she
doesn't have to stray outside her
own backyard. She forgets Hol
lywood and sings a rousing tri
bute to San Francisco.
That is the plot of BBBGttS.
Complicated it's not, but there is
enough to last 80 minutes and
accomodate what seems like 200
songs, from "As Time Goes By"
to "Stayin' Alive." The produc
tion is sleek and flashy and
loaded with color, and the out
landish costumes and headgear
(there is an obvious obsession
with headgear) are works of art
you'll never see in a museum.
Ever seen someone belt out a
song with a giant basket of
french fries on her head? Ever
seen someone try to render an
emotional "There's No Business

Like Show Business" dressed as
an envelope? There's a lot in
BBBGttS that you've never seen
and probably will never see
anywhere else. This is the most
original and creative mingling of
kitsch and camp to hit the thea
ter scene in a long, long time.
Frenetic pace
The talented troupe of
singer-dancers who perform
BBBGttS are for the most part
young and attractive and over
flowing with energy, but not
even they can keep up with the
frenetic pace BBBGttS sets in its
first fifteen minutes. During the
first few scenes, one question
ran repeatedly through my
thoughts: do these people
shoot up before each show?
They scramble on stage, do a few
kicks, sing a few bars, say a few
words and speed off all before
you get a chance to focus your
eyes and see who it it. Every line
is a punch line, every costume is
an eye-popper, every song is a
familiar hit. This predilection for
overkill is apparent throughout
the production, though it tones
down a bit after the first half
hour or so. Nevertheless, the
performers are kept so busy
hoofing and huffing and hoof
ing, they hardly have time to
enjoy themselves, which is a
shame.
The Club Fugazi is a cute little
cabaret which seats 299 people
and serves beer and wine. The
stage is very small, but the cos
tumes are so bright and the
amplification system is so good
that you will see and hear almost
everything. There is an excel
lent group of musicians, all of
whom wear large pink rabbit
ears and play mighty fine music.
The service at the club is friendly
and the atmosphere is good, al
though this is the season for
drunken out-of-towners and
you might be crammed in next to
a sloshed foursome from
Fresno. Don't pay any attention
to them, just sit back and pre
pare to lose yourself in the total
mindlessness of BBBGttS. It's
fantasy, it's escapism, and it's
real, honest-to-God, old
fashioned entertainment. Those
folks up there really pump ev
erything they've got into
BBBGttS. You definitely get your
money's worth.
