# Hospital receives full accreditation
## 
### 
The Stanford Hospital has re
ceived a full two-year accredita
tion following three consecutive
one-year accreditations from the
Joint Commission on Accredita
tion of Hospitals (JCAH), it was
announced yesterday.
The accreditation is based on a
survey completed in April by
members of JCAH, the Califor
nia Department of Health and
the California Medical Associa
tion.
The hospital has been at
tempting to improve some of the
deficiencies noted in past JCAH
reports. The one-year accredita
tions were issued in the beliefs
that the deficiencies could be
corrected within one year.
Accreditation may be denied
for severe deficiencies.
The two-year accreditation in
ducates that many of the more

serious deficiencies have been
corrected.
Two of the concerns of the
surveyors inspecting the hospi
tal last year were "deficiencies
due to the high utilization of the
hospital and a lack of space," ac
cording to former Hospital Di
rector Paul Hofmann.
Hospital administrator Gary
Mecklenburg said the two-year
accreditation signified "signific
ant achievements in providing a
high standard of operation and
to an ongoing commitment of
the hospital staff to deliver the
highest quality of patient care."
The JCAH is a nongovernmen
tal organization operating under
the auspices of the American
College of Surgeons, the Ameri
can Hospital Association and the
American Medical Association.

the house had its typical summer sparseness, all reports indicate those who did come out were not
disappointed.
