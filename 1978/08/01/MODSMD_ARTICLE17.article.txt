Rhodesian jets attack guerrillas
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesian jet fighters
streaked into Mozambique for the second
straight day yesterday to support Rhodesian
troops attacking black nationalist guerrilla bases.
Operations headquarters here has remained si
lent about the raid since the initial communique
Sunday that described the attack as "self-defense
operations" against guerrillas of Robert Mugabe's
Zimbabwe African National Union who have ig
nored the transition government's May 2 call for a
ceasefire.
A spokesman at Mugabe's office in Maputo, the
Mozambican capital, said he knew nothing about
the raids apart from Western news reports. Radio
Maputo, which normally carries official accusa
tions of Rhodesian incursions, has carried no re
port.
Fighters based in the central Rhodesian town of
Gwelo, 200 miles south of here, flew over Salis
bury heading toward the northeast border along
Mozambique's Tete province. Tete, 1000 miles
north of Maputo, has been one of the main
springboards for guerrilla incursions since the
start of their war to topple the government six
years ago.
The internally based faction of ZANU led by the
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole — one of four members
on the transition government's executive council
— called the raids "ill-advised." The local ZANU
faction said in a statement the attack should be
directed against Mugabe and his senior military
commander, Josiah Tongogara, at their head
quarters in Maputo.
Sithole, who disputes Mugabe's leadership in
the organization, claims considerable support
among guerrillas and, despite the heightened
guerrilla incursions and suarply rising war casual
ties, says many insurgents are obeying the biracial
government's ceasefire call.
Iraqi embassy held by terrorist
Paris — A lone terrorist surrendered after hold
ing hostages at the Iraqi Embassy for BVi hours
Friday and touched off a wild and bloody shoot
out between vengeful Iraqi security men and
French police who were trying to take him away.
One officer and one Iraqi guard were killed,
and the terrorist and three other persons were
wounded, police said.
Police said at least three Iraqi security men first
rushed the French officers and their captive on
the street outside the embassy, opening fire on
the terrorist. The Frenchmen returned the fire,
police said.
More than a dozen shots were heard during the
brief, bizarre battle.
A number of Iraqi security men were arrested
by French police.
The captured terrorist, said by Palestinian
sources in Lebanon to be a guerrilla loyal to Yas
ser Arafat, was reported seriously wounded. The
other three wounded were identified as two
policemen and an Arab League diplomat who had
acted as a negotiator. An embassy guard suffered
serious gunshot wounds during the initial ter
rorist takeover of the building.
Urban League attacks 'Sambo's'
Springfield, Mass. — The Urban League of
Springfield wants the state attorney general's of
fice to prevent a national restaurant chain from
calling it's Massachusetts outlets "Sambo's,"

claiming the name carries racist overtones and
offends blacks.
Henry Thomas 111, executive director of the
league, said Monday he has written to Attorney
General Francis X. Bellotti seeking legal action by
the state against the California-based Sambo's
Restaurants Inc.
"We must all work aggressively toward enhanc
ing positive race relations within the common
wealth, to make this state a better one," Thomas
said. The attorney general's office had no im
mediate comment on his organization's request
that it attempt to intervene.
A spokesman at the Santa Barbara, Calif, head
quarters of Sambo's Restaurants said the name is
derived from parts of the names of the firm's two
founders. In other places, after Sambo's restaur
ants have opened, "most people felt it was kind of
silly" to make "such a to-do" about the name, he
said.
But, Thomas said, the chain's advertising uses a
figure clearly intended to be the "Little Black
Sambo" storybook character.
Gann seeks state spending limit
Sacramento — Passage of Proposition 13 is re
sulting in a tax shift instead of a cut, and a limit on
government spending is needed to really curb
taxes, Proposition 13's co-author said yesterday.
"Proposition 13 was a step in the right direc
tion, not a panacea," said Paul Gann, who com
plained many local governments are raising fees
to help make up for 13's property tax cuts.
Gann was joined at a press conference by state
Sen. Ceorge Deukmejian and John Hay, execu
tive vice president of the California Chamber of
Commerce, to push forapproval of Deukmejian's
spending limit.
Gann said he would lead a drive to put a
spending-limit initiative on the ballot in 1980 if
Deukmejian's constitutional amendment, SCA
42, fails to make the November ballot.
Hay was even stronger in his criticism of the fee
increases, many of which have hit businesses he
represents. "We are finding that 13 is not working
because we are getting a tax shift and are getting
government as usual," he said.
Deukmejian's amendment, one of several
spending limit plans awaiting legislative action in
August, would generally limit growth in state and
local spending to increases in inflation plus popu
lation.
Rose hits 44th
Atlanta — Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds tied
the National League's all-time consecutive game
hitting streak yesterday, hitting safely for the 44th
consecutive game with a ground-ball single to
right field in the sixth inning.
Rose, who had walked and lined out in two
previous trips, took two balls from knuckleballer
Phil Niekro of the Atlanta Braves before smashing
his hit just out of second baseman RodGilbreath's
reach.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except coastal fog or low
clouds extending inland nights and mornings.
Temperatures averaging above normal. Highs in
the 60s and 70s near the coast and the 90s to near
110 inland valleys. Lows in the 50s and 60s except
locally in the 70s in the Sacramento Valley.

One officer and one Iraqi guard were killed,
and the terrorist and three other persons were
wounded, police said.
Police said at least three Iraqi security men first
rushed the French officers and their captive on
the street outside the embassy, opening fire on
the terrorist. The Frenchmen returned the fire,
police said.
More than a dozen shots were heard during the
brief, bizarre battle.
A number of Iraqi security men were arrested
by French police.
The captured terrorist, said by Palestinian
sources in Lebanon to be a guerrilla loyal to Yas
ser Arafat, was reported seriously wounded. The
other three wounded were identified as two
policemen and an Arab League diplomat who had
acted as a negotiator. An embassy guard suffered
serious gunshot wounds during the initial ter
rorist takeover of the building.
Urban League attacks 'Sambo's'
Springfield, Mass. — The Urban League of
Springfield wants the state attorney general's of
fice to prevent a national restaurant chain from
calling it's Massachusetts outlets "Sambo's,"

claiming the name carries racist overtones and
offends blacks.
Henry Thomas 111, executive director of the
league, said Monday he has written to Attorney
General Francis X. Bellotti seeking legal action by
the state against the California-based Sambo's
Restaurants Inc.
"We must all work aggressively toward enhanc
ing positive race relations within the common
wealth, to make this state a better one," Thomas
said. The attorney general's office had no im
mediate comment on his organization's request
that it attempt to intervene.
A spokesman at the Santa Barbara, Calif, head
quarters of Sambo's Restaurants said the name is
derived from parts of the names of the firm's two
founders. In other places, after Sambo's restaur
ants have opened, "most people felt it was kind of
silly" to make "such a to-do" about the name, he
said.
But, Thomas said, the chain's advertising uses a
figure clearly intended to be the "Little Black
Sambo" storybook character.
Gann seeks state spending limit
Sacramento — Passage of Proposition 13 is re
sulting in a tax shift instead of a cut, and a limit on
government spending is needed to really curb
taxes, Proposition 13's co-author said yesterday.
"Proposition 13 was a step in the right direc
tion, not a panacea," said Paul Gann, who com
plained many local governments are raising fees
to help make up for 13's property tax cuts.
Gann was joined at a press conference by state
Sen. Ceorge Deukmejian and John Hay, execu
tive vice president of the California Chamber of
Commerce, to push forapproval of Deukmejian's
spending limit.
Gann said he would lead a drive to put a
spending-limit initiative on the ballot in 1980 if
Deukmejian's constitutional amendment, SCA
42, fails to make the November ballot.
Hay was even stronger in his criticism of the fee
increases, many of which have hit businesses he
represents. "We are finding that 13 is not working
because we are getting a tax shift and are getting
government as usual," he said.
Deukmejian's amendment, one of several
spending limit plans awaiting legislative action in
August, would generally limit growth in state and
local spending to increases in inflation plus popu
lation.
Rose hits 44th
Atlanta — Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds tied
the National League's all-time consecutive game
hitting streak yesterday, hitting safely for the 44th
consecutive game with a ground-ball single to
right field in the sixth inning.
Rose, who had walked and lined out in two
previous trips, took two balls from knuckleballer
Phil Niekro of the Atlanta Braves before smashing
his hit just out of second baseman RodGilbreath's
reach.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except coastal fog or low
clouds extending inland nights and mornings.
Temperatures averaging above normal. Highs in
the 60s and 70s near the coast and the 90s to near
110 inland valleys. Lows in the 50s and 60s except
locally in the 70s in the Sacramento Valley.
Rhodesian jets attack guerrillas
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesian jet fighters
streaked into Mozambique for the second
straight day yesterday to support Rhodesian
troops attacking black nationalist guerrilla bases.
Operations headquarters here has remained si
lent about the raid since the initial communique
Sunday that described the attack as "self-defense
operations" against guerrillas of Robert Mugabe's
Zimbabwe African National Union who have ig
nored the transition government's May 2 call for a
ceasefire.
A spokesman at Mugabe's office in Maputo, the
Mozambican capital, said he knew nothing about
the raids apart from Western news reports. Radio
Maputo, which normally carries official accusa
tions of Rhodesian incursions, has carried no re
port.
Fighters based in the central Rhodesian town of
Gwelo, 200 miles south of here, flew over Salis
bury heading toward the northeast border along
Mozambique's Tete province. Tete, 1000 miles
north of Maputo, has been one of the main
springboards for guerrilla incursions since the
start of their war to topple the government six
years ago.
The internally based faction of ZANU led by the
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole — one of four members
on the transition government's executive council
— called the raids "ill-advised." The local ZANU
faction said in a statement the attack should be
directed against Mugabe and his senior military
commander, Josiah Tongogara, at their head
quarters in Maputo.
Sithole, who disputes Mugabe's leadership in
the organization, claims considerable support
among guerrillas and, despite the heightened
guerrilla incursions and suarply rising war casual
ties, says many insurgents are obeying the biracial
government's ceasefire call.
