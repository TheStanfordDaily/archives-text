# 300 more spaces in parking lots here
## 
### 
The dearth of parking on the
west end of the campus should
end with the summer. Nearly 300
new spaces will be available
soon — new parking lots will be
built in Lagunita Court and on
the top of the "supertank."
"The supertank" is a four mill
ion gallon underground reser
voir holding water for the Uni
versity's air conditioning sys
tem; it is located at Campus
Drive and Jordan Way, west of
the steam plant. The Lagunita lot
is at the west end of Santa Teresa
Street.
Construction of both lots will
get under way during August.
In addition to the construction
of new parking facilities, the ser
vice road which runs between
Green Library and Hoover Fed
eral Memorial buildings will be
paved and landscaped.
Then work will proceed on re
paving Crothers Way, the coun
terpart street which runs bet
ween the two Crothers dor
mitories and Encina Commons.
Crothers Way connects with
Arguello St., which runs along
the west side of Encina Hall to

Serra St.
The modular building holding
the Development Office's
graphics department will be
moved out of the way during the
repaving process, which will
continue well into September
and possibly later.
These roads will be restricted
to the use of bicycles, service
and emergency vehicles. Park
ing and use regulations will be
strictly enforced.
Continuous abuse of the "no
entry" regulations around the
Tanner Fountain between
Hoover Institution and Memo
rial Auditorium will be halted by
the installation of heavy-duty
steel barriers.
"All cars, except high-axle
service and emergency vehicles
and the Marguerite bus, will suf
fer severe damage to the under
carriage if they try to cross these
barriers," warned Peter Hopf,
facilities engineer-coordinator.
These are expected to be in
stalled during the next'two
weeks.
