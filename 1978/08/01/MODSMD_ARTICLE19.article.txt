sidder Union and the Stanford Bookstore, will be holding a book
sale August 7to 11. The hours are from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day

and history donated by prize committees.
The council, an outgrowth of the Stanford Faculty Women's
Group, offers quality childcare for Stanford families through two
schools: Escondido Nursery School and Bing School.
The child center, which offers Kindergarten through third grade,
is presently full with a waiting list.
Films killed
The Chaparral film series has been cancelled for the remainder
of the summer due to poor attendance.
Jordan defeated
Sophomore Kathy Jordan was edged by Tracy Austin of Rolling
Hills in the finals of the Girls 18 clay court tennis championships in
Memphis, Tenn. this weekend, 6-2, 6-0.
New student rule
The Immigration and Naturalization service is proposing to allow
foreign students to remain in the United States as long as they
continue as students.
Currently foreign students are admitted for one year and have to
renew their student status annually to remain in the country.
This has caused considerable paperwork and confusion for
some students, officials said.
The proposal is open for public comment until Aug. 25 and
interested persons should write to the Commissioner of Immigra
tion and Naturalization, 425 Eye St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20536.
