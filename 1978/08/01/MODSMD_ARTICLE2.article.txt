# Mail carriers closer to strike
## 
### Associated Press 
The nation's letter carriers
took a step toward a strike yes
terday when their union's na
tional convention voted against
ratification of a tentative con
tract with the U.S. Postal Ser
vice.
In the first union-wide vote on
the contract, 8000 state and local
leaders of the National Associa
tion of Letter Carriers rejected
the contract by voice vote in
Chicago.
The vote is not binding, but a
union official said it probably
would carry considerable weight
among the nationwide rank
and-file, who will be voting by
mail this month.
The union has 181,000 mem
bers, mostly mail deliverers. It is
one of three unions that reached
tentative agreement with the
Postal Service July 21, and the
convention action was the first
vote other than by locals of each
union.
The contract provides a wage
hike of 19.5 percent over three
years.
In Newark, N.)., meanwhile, a
militant postal workers' local
was barred in court from taking a
strike vote. And in Portland,
Ore., the postmaster general
predicted there will be no strike.
NACL Vice President James
Schaefer said after the vote in
Chicago that the three unions
had agreed not to put the con
tract into effect if any one union
votes against it.
If ratification is rejected, he
said, the unions could try to re
sume talks with the postal ser
vice. But postal authorities
would not be bound to do so,
Schaefer said, and a strike could

break out.
There was no immediate
comment from the Postal Ser
vice.
The other unions are the
American Postal Workers Union
and the Mail Handlers Division
of the Laborers' International
Union of North America.
In Newark, the militant New
York-New Jersey local of the
APWU and its officials were bar
red by a federal judge Monday
from participating in a strike
vote by members or contribut
ing to any walkout they au
thorize.
U.S. District Judge Frederick
Lacey's injunction allowed
postal workers to talk about a
strike on their own under free
speech constitutional guaran
tees, but stopped the union
from aiding or supporting pic
keting or any other strike action.
He added that if individual
members strike independently
they would be in contempt of
court.
The executive council of the
23,000-member local responded
by calling for rejection of the
contract.
"We are recommending to
our membership that they vote
down the contract, and we are
recommending to all our friends
throughout the country the
same," said Morris Biller, presi
dent of the New York metro Area
Postal union.
Lacey had issued a temporary
order against the strike vote by
the local, which was planned for
yesterday. He based the tem
porary order Friday on the fed
eral law against postal strikes.
Yesterday's ruling made the in
junction permanent.
