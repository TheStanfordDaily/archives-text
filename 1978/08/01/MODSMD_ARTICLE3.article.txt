Low voter turnout in the re
cent alumni trustee elections
has fostered considerable activ
ity on the part of those con
nected with the workings of
Stanford's trustee organization.
The Alumni Executive Board,
responsible for administering
the elections, plans to conduct a
formal review of the process at
its next meeting; in addition, it is
now busy examining a "demog
raphic analysis" conducted dur
ing the election by the Mervin
Field Poll Company. The func
tion and effect of alumni trus
tees is being examined at great
length; the relationship bet
ween that body and the rest of
the board is being redefined.
Such a redefinition is essential
to a proper understanding of the
board, according to Nelson
Dong. Dong served this year on
a trustee ad hoc commission
concerning investment respon
sibility; he is a White House Fel
low, an attorney in San Francisco
and a recently elected trustee.
Needless to say, Dong is
greatly interested in the

dynamics of the Board of Trus
tees and his thoughts on the
changes taking place therein
may help explain what has hap
pened to the vote.
Only 15 percent of the ballots
senttoalumni in the last election
were returned and Dong be
lieves that this is largely a result
of two related phenomenon.
First, he notes that alumni trus
tees no longer constitute a
group that is politically, racially
and economically distinct from
the remainder of the board.
"The original intention (of
alumni elections) was to make
the board more reflective of the
general and student populations
— alumni trustees brought a
broader representation and dif
ferent kind of perspective," he
said.
In short, according to Dong,
alumni trustees were supposed
to counterbalance the San
Francisco-based, exclusively
white, inevitably male group.
That was in 1972, when the
alumni elections began. Today,
Dong argues, the non-elected
trustees are not so easily
categorized. Dong holds that "if
you look out over the last 8-10
years you'll find that regular
trustees have become more and

more like alumni trustees.
"Some views expressed today
by those members would have
been at best heretical 10 years
ago — they may not be prevail
ing opinions, but they have de

finitely become a part of the give
and take."
Alumni trustees and the "reg
ular" officers are fast becoming
indistinguishable, and this, ac
cording to Dong, may have con

vinced most alumni that "they
have achieved what they set out
to do.
"Alumni no longer see a great
need for altering the make-up of
the organization." Even without
the alumni trustees, board
members are younger now and
less SF-based and WASP.
Thus this year's alumni trus
tees have more than the tradi
tional set of problems waiting
forthem in addition to problems
related to corporate holdings,
rising costs, a shrinking en
dowment and the need to main
tain University educational
standards.
Dong is the first to concede
that it may not be easy. "There
may be some skepticism on the
part of alumni who participate
year after year in a process with
no feedback loop built into it —
there is no way for alumni as
such to know how the trustees
are voting, and likewise there is
no mechanism that enables us to
guage their opinions."
Now that the alumni trustees
no longer make up an identifi
able faction of the board, Dong
notes, such points of stress in
the relationship between the
trustees and their constituency
are bound to be further tested.
