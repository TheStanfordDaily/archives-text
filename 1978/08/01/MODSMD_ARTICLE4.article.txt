This time they've just gone too far.
The Department of Athletics, during one of its more inspired
moments, has announced that it will prohibit bottles, cans, large
containers and alcoholic beverages inside the stadium during
home football games.
The rhetorical reasoning behind the change in policy is that it is
in the best interest of Stanford football fans. Make us laugh.
While we realize the virtues of crowd control as well as anyone,
the Saturday afternoon football crowds have not been noted for
their rowdiness. The danger simply doesn't exist here as it might at
other, less civilized institutions.
This decision, consistent with the University's policy of an
nouncing controversial decisions during the summer when no one
is here to protest them, will be as difficult to enforce as it will be to
convince the students of its merit.
Now there will be two games in the stadium, the one played by
large men in uniforms and the other played by students and other
fans trying to slip a couple of cans of beer past the security guards
at the gate. Our intellect could be put to better use.
Sure, keep the kegs and garbage cans full of beer bottles out. But
if someone wants to take a sixpack in to pass the long, hot after
noon on the sunny side of the stadium, what's the harm?
And will the University ban soft-drink sellers, those pernicious
purveyors of steel cans?
"It's the repression inherent in the system," the rebellious peas
ant told the crowd upon seeing King Arthur's anger in "Monty
Python and the Holy Grail." One needn't be in sixth century Eng
land to witness such ridiculous scenes.
Give us a break.
