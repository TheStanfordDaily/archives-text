# Noah looks at the Stanford experience
## 
### 
Pollock, Vale

Noah and I met yesterday in
front of Memorial Church. He
was hard at work, as usual, an
noying the tourists. He made
sure that there was too much
bustle for them to take "quiet"
pictures of the church.
If they got tired of waiting for
the traffic of the Quad to clear
they would turn around and
shoot a roll of Hoover Tower in
stead. Noah would then laugh
heartily, reassured he was doing
the right thing.
He is good at what he does
because he is almost impossible
to pick out of a crowd of Stan
ford students.
"You know, kid, (he calls
everyone "kid") that Hoover
Tower of babble is really some
thing . . . my, my, finals are al
most here. What are you doing
this summer?"
I told him I was going home
and finding a job there, like I did
last year.
"Back to the 'real world,' eh,
kid? Some think this place is as
real as Cupertino. How 'bout
you?"
I said I had long heard about
that dichotomy, and while it
shouldn't be right, I could not
help but feel strange whenever I
went from here to home and
vice-verse. That strange feeling
wasn't all from jet lag, to be sure.
I told him I refused to believe
that this was just a big play
ground with toys such as labs,
typewriters and articulate
teachers (oops, I mean profes

sors).
But two separate realities, if
that is the explanation, would
make one schizo. Noah, give me
an answer!
"Alright, kid. College is a sub
set in the Venn diagram of real
ity. Another subset is grad
school and another is IBM.
"The particular style of living
you go through while getting
this education is just temporary.
That sheepskin may say

'Bachelor of Arts' on the front,
but its backside insists that all
the learning you endured is but a
preparation to the rest of reality.
A pretty shabby preparation, if
you ask me."
I told him that made sense,
but that I thought I was getting a
lot out of college besides an
education and vocational train
ing. Asan example, I mentioned
I was learning how to survive all
the varieties of "interpersonal

relationships."
"Kid, relatively few people
make it into Stanford or get
around to approaching the
meaning of their being intellec
tually. Besides that, not
everyone knows, understands
or likes California plasticity.
"Why, some folks even insist
they don't have interpersonal re
lationships, just friends and lov
ers.
"Kid, Stanford will get you a
cushy and interesting job, but it
won't fill you in on what the
other subsets of reality are like.
"Here, you can have an art ap
preciation class, and a music ap
preciation one. Really the whole
darn school is just an intellec
tual masturbation appreciation
course. The only place you can
enroll in reality appreciation is in
your summer factory job."
I told Noah to come off it. I
knew the outer world was cold
and frustrating and admitted to
avoiding it as long as possible.
But while I am avoiding it, I said,
I am learning skills and bullshit
that will get me a plush job. I
assured him I wasn't trying to
fool anyone.
"Look, I didn't mean to make
you mad, kid. I'm not even a
student here. I just hang around
to leer at pre-meds and snicker
at psychology majors.
"When I go to bed at night, in
my cozy little pup tent I have set
up in one of the oases in front of

the church, I think about your,
and other students' worries
about entering the grown-ups'
world. Me, I just live on hand
outs and freebies.
"Kid, maybe it's all just switch
ing one set of routines to
another. The grown-up's
routine is the principle one and
college is assumed to be the
routine for preparation for it. It
may not be an adequate pre
paratory routine in most cases,
but calling education vital to ad
justing to the 'real' routine gives
it its only significance.''
I thought Noah a fool. Then I
realized that fools are just about
the only nonspecialized people
these days. He, at least, is sane. I
asked him how I could stay sane
in any subset.
"Simple, kid. While you are in
school enjoy the pleasures of
drugs, sex and violence. When
you have a career, fall back on
beer, marriage and the CBS
Evening News."

Pollock, Vale

Noah and I met yesterday in
front of Memorial Church. He
was hard at work, as usual, an
noying the tourists. He made
sure that there was too much
bustle for them to take "quiet"
pictures of the church.
If they got tired of waiting for
the traffic of the Quad to clear
they would turn around and
shoot a roll of Hoover Tower in
stead. Noah would then laugh
heartily, reassured he was doing
the right thing.
He is good at what he does
because he is almost impossible
to pick out of a crowd of Stan
ford students.
"You know, kid, (he calls
everyone "kid") that Hoover
Tower of babble is really some
thing . . . my, my, finals are al
most here. What are you doing
this summer?"
I told him I was going home
and finding a job there, like I did
last year.
"Back to the 'real world,' eh,
kid? Some think this place is as
real as Cupertino. How 'bout
you?"
I said I had long heard about
that dichotomy, and while it
shouldn't be right, I could not
help but feel strange whenever I
went from here to home and
vice-verse. That strange feeling
wasn't all from jet lag, to be sure.
I told him I refused to believe
that this was just a big play
ground with toys such as labs,
typewriters and articulate
teachers (oops, I mean profes

sors).
But two separate realities, if
that is the explanation, would
make one schizo. Noah, give me
an answer!
"Alright, kid. College is a sub
set in the Venn diagram of real
ity. Another subset is grad
school and another is IBM.
"The particular style of living
you go through while getting
this education is just temporary.
That sheepskin may say

'Bachelor of Arts' on the front,
but its backside insists that all
the learning you endured is but a
preparation to the rest of reality.
A pretty shabby preparation, if
you ask me."
I told him that made sense,
but that I thought I was getting a
lot out of college besides an
education and vocational train
ing. Asan example, I mentioned
I was learning how to survive all
the varieties of "interpersonal

relationships."
"Kid, relatively few people
make it into Stanford or get
around to approaching the
meaning of their being intellec
tually. Besides that, not
everyone knows, understands
or likes California plasticity.
"Why, some folks even insist
they don't have interpersonal re
lationships, just friends and lov
ers.
"Kid, Stanford will get you a
cushy and interesting job, but it
won't fill you in on what the
other subsets of reality are like.
"Here, you can have an art ap
preciation class, and a music ap
preciation one. Really the whole
darn school is just an intellec
tual masturbation appreciation
course. The only place you can
enroll in reality appreciation is in
your summer factory job."
I told Noah to come off it. I
knew the outer world was cold
and frustrating and admitted to
avoiding it as long as possible.
But while I am avoiding it, I said,
I am learning skills and bullshit
that will get me a plush job. I
assured him I wasn't trying to
fool anyone.
