The Wall
There will soom be four walls
of renown in this world: the
Great Wall of China, the Berlin
Wall, the Wailing Wall, and the
Stanford Wall.
The last has characteristics in
common with the others.
It will be a tourist attraction, it
has been and will be devisive,
and it will induce lamentation.

Movie reviews
I am very grateful that some
one other than John Nielsen is
doing some of the reviews. Vin
cent Warren actually described
movies in such a way as to indi

cate whether they are worth
going to. He clearly writes with
the reading public in mind.
On the other hand, in each of
John Nielsen's reviews, the focal
point is his pesonality, which I
happen to find distasteful.
There might be some people
who find his reviews amusing,
but there are probably very few
who find them informative.
I did find his description of
"The Turning Point" to be very
ironic. He described the movie
as "an inflated, shrill, pretenti
ous fake." The description
seemed so much more apropos
of the reviewer.
