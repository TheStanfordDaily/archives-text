# TV rights trial underway

San Francisco (AP) — In a case
that could affect the future of
television, trial began Monday in
an $11 million negligence suit
against NBC for showing a movie
about a sexual assault on a
young girl.
• At issue is whether the First
Amendment protects televi
sion's right to air movies dealing
with brutal subjects, such as the

Sept. 6,1974, showing of the film
"Born Innocent."
The case was assigned to
Superior Court Judge Robert
Dossee, who heard a series of
routine motions from attorneys
in closed session Monday. He
scheduled arguments on the
motions for Tuesday with jury
selection to begin Wednesday.
Defense attorney Marvin

Lewis said the trial probably
would last three to four weeks.
The movie charted the life of a
runaway teenager, portrayed by
actress Linda Blair, star of the
movie "The Exorcist," and in
cluded a scene at a reformatory
in which she is sexually as
saulted with the wooden handle
of a plumber's plunger.
Four days after the TV movie
was aired, a 9-year-old girl was
similarly attacked by three girls
with a beer bottle on a San Fran
cisco beach. Her mother, Valeria
Niemi, filed suit in San Francisco
Superior Court contending the
film inspired the crime.
"It's merely our contention
that the particular scene, which
was graphic and unnecessary for
the telling of the plot, caused
harm to an innocent victim,"
said Lewis.
NBC lawyer Floyd Abrams
countered that there were con
flicting statements about
whether the girls, and one boy
who stood lookout for them, ac
tually saw the movie. He said,
however, the case posed serious
constitutional problems regard
less of whether they viewed the
movie.
"We view this as a terribly sig
nificant First Amendment case
dealing with constitutional
rights of free expression," Ab
rams said.
Abrams said he feared an NBC
loss in the case would "lead to a
kind of blandness, a kind of av
oidance of television dealing
with hard and real and poignant
social problems."
Lewis, however, complained
the movie was aired at 7:30 p.m.
in some areas and at 8 p.m. in
others and suggested "there is
no question that children and
young people learn by imita
tion."
The gritty realism of the film
inspired the concept of
"family-hour" programming in
which the Federal Communica
tions Commission slapped
stringent guidelines on the por
trayal of sex and violence during
early evening shows.
