The Daily welcomes let
ters, columns and cartoons
from readers on topics of
interest to the Stanford
community. Columns and
letters should be typed,
double-spaced, on
nonerasable paper using a
57-character line. Cartoons
should be submitted in
camera-ready form.
The Daily reserves the
right to edit all opinions for
clarity, brevity and style.
