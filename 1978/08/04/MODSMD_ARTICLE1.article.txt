# Arab killing in Paris; Israel raids Lebanon

Tel Aviv (AP) — Israeli
warplanes blasted a Palestinian
guerrilla training base deep in
southern Lebanon yesterday
only hours after a terrorist bomb
ripped through a crowded Tel
Aviv market, wounding 49 per
sons, one fatally.
Meanwhile, in Paris a two-man
Arab hit squad assassinated the
Paris representative of the Pales
tine Liberation Organization and
another PLO employee in the
latest round of a bloody Arab
vendetta being waged in world
capitals.
In a communique issued in
Beirut, the PLO claimed respon
sibility for planting the
homemade bomb that rained
nails and ball bearings on shop
pers at the outdoor market in Tel
Aviv.
The Popular Front for the Lib

most radical guerrilla factions
under the PLO umbrella, later
said it was responsible for the
blast and vowed to "continue to
fight against the enemy to liber
ate the whole of Palestine." The
Marxist radical band, headed by
Dr. George Habash, is opposed
to any negotiated settlement

with Israel.
Israel, reporting the air raid 25
miles north of its border with
Lebanon, said, "The murderers
will be hit wherever they will
be."
An Israeli communique said
planes attacked a base at Dahar
a-Tutah, about 10 miles north of
the Mediterranean port city of
Tyre in an area inhabited exclu
sively by guerrillas.
A guerrilla spokesman in
Beirut said five civilians were
wounded in Israeli air strikes at

"several positions" about 36
miles south of the Lebanese cap
ital.
Guerrilla sources said six Is
raeli planes took part in the 30-
minute attack that heavily dam
aged a training base in the Zifta
valley.
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman Hodding Car
ter condemned the market
bombing as "a savage and brutal
act . . . that nothing can justify.

Two Recycling Center workers empty a can full of soon-to-be-recycled
cans into a bin at the center on Pampas Lane. The center has received
less recyclable material this summer than in the past, and workers are
concerned that visitors and summer students may be unaware of the
purpose of the green cans. Anytime you see the green with arrows, it's
for recycling.
