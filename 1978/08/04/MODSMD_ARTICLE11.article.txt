# Dance instructor brings movement to Stanford

### Heidi Henkel 
"Dance is what this life is all
about!" exclaims Juan Valen
zuela. That may be an expected
statement from a dance instruc
tor here, however, for Valen
zuela dance and life are an in
separable combination.
Born in Mexico, Valenzuela
draws upon his Spanish and
Aztec-Yacqui Indian heritage in
his philosophy that "Man was
given five special gifts that color
life's dance â€” the senses. Our
dance has a beginning, a middle
and an end. It is the same with
birth, life and death." Since he
came to Stanford in 1974, Valen
zuela has enlightened many
Stanford students to the world
of dance.
When asked why he started
dancing, Valenzuela recalled
being in third grade watching
two girls tap dance. During their
dance, he said he felt as if he had
been struck by a bolt of lighten
ing. "I knew then that I was
meant to dance."
However, it was not until he
was 16 that he actually started
dancing. His professional career
began when he was 25. Today, at

59, Valenzuela seems to have
remained 25 in both appearence
and energetic spirit.
Valenzuela's late start in danc
ing can be attributed to being
male during the 1920's and com
ing from a poor family. Valen
zuela said his father could not
understand his desire to dance.
It was not until he brought home
a paycheck and made the news
in his hometown, Salt Lake City,
that Juan gained his father's
support.
"However, my mother was
one of the two major influences
in my dancing,"Valenzuelasaid.
"After I began studying with the
biggies in New York, my mother
told me that she had wanted to
dance but never could. She be
lieved, as with Indian tradition,
that I had chosen her as my
mother so that I would fulfill her
dreams and she, in turn, would
influence me to dance. Mom
also would save up so that I
could see Fred Astaire at the
movies."
The other influential person in
Valenzuel's dancing career is
Martha Graham, whom he
studied with in New York.

"Everyone seemed to teach
dance as calisthenics. I knew
there was more to it, perhaps it
was my Indian background.
Martha was able to bring the
calisthenics and the philosophy
of dance together. I felt the spirit
of the dance along with the phys
ical."
When teaching now, whether
it be to children, school superin
tendents or to a class of Stanford
students, Valenzuela combines
the stretching, bending, twist
ing, and leaping with Indian lore
and his own philosophy.
Juan said he believes that
when we are born all we know
is movement; that is our only
form of communication. Then
we learn to talk and gradually we
lose our freedom of movement
as we become more verbal.

By the time a student reaches
Stanford, he has often divorced
his mind from his body. For
Juan, it is necessary for us to re
construct the links between our
mind, body and spirit. "It is ap
parent that the effects of our sci
entific creativity has isolated our
sense of relationships. As a con
sequence man is a fragmented
being."
During his four years at Stan
ford, Valenzuela has brought
dance into an engineering class,
allowing the students to relate
movement to their studies.
Valenzuela's goal is to bring
dance and art into the schools. A
total education involves the
mind and body growing as one.
"We do a great job of not listen
ing, seeing or reading the
dances and songs of young

people," he said. "The arts can
assist us in expression and
communication."
Valenzuela has worked for a
long time toward realizing this
goal. He is a master movement
specialist for the Nation.*:! En
dowment for the Arts, an Artist
in-the-Schools and has taught
various workshops throughout
the nation to adults and chil
dren.
He is a consultant for the
Headstart program and directed
the first American Indian Mod
ern Dance Ensemble. Valen
zuela taught at the University of
Utah, the Institute of American
Indian Arts and several college
summer workshops. And now
at Stanford, Juan is bringing
dance into our classrooms, labs
and curriculum.
