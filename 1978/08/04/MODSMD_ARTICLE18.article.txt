## Movies/elliot klein 'Driver' takes you for a nebulous ride 
### 
"The Driver," now showing
at the Fine Arts Theater in Palo
Alto, takes'you for a trip on a
flat road across a dead land
scape.
And when it's over, you
wonder where you've been
led, and why.
Walter Hill, who directs his
own screenplay, has bor
rowed from the traditional
cops-and-robbers genre, but
with a difference: the pro
ceedings are too alienating to
be taken at face value. His plot
involves three characters in an
elaborate game of nerves and
bluffing. Each is isolated,
dresses in dark colors, dis
trusts people and is motivated
not by recognizable human
emotion but by some
monolithic Sense of Purpose.
As if to reinforce their
abstractness, Hill has with
held names from all his
characters. You can see right
away that there's supposed to
be some deep metaphor con
cealed in the game of confron
tations, deals and double
crosses. In casting faceless
characters and having them
speak mechanical dialogue
against bleak urban land
scape, Hill is obviously bid
ding to give "The Driver"
some credibility as a thinking
man's cops-and-robbers, a
film with Meaning. But what/'s
the meaning?
I don't envy any screen per
former who gets cast in this
sort of vehicle. The danger is
that he'll be required to turn
off his acting ability in order to
become the instrument of the

director's dubious
philosophical designs. But in
the case of Ryan O'Neal, the
sacrifice is probably minimal.
As "The Driver," the cool pro
fessional getaway driver with
the skill to elude a regiment of
police cars, O'Neal is called
upon to look beautiful and
project nothing — something
he excels at. Whether he can
act at all continues to remain a
closely guarded secret. As his
accomplice, a moody lady
gambler, Isabelle Adjani is
equally inanimate. Although
an intelligent actress, she

seems uncomfortable in the
English language — not sur
prising, considering her lines
— and moves stiffly through a
part that calls for none of the
emotional range she showed
in Truffaut's "Story of Adele
H." The only interesting per
formance in the film belongs
to Bruce Dern, who plays "The
Detective," obsessed with
tracking down "The Driver"
and bagging him like a trophy.
His characterization of the au
thoritarian heavy who
seethes with repressed vio
lence creates a cinematic pro

totype, much liketheoriginal
bad guy types that Peter Lorre
and Edward C. Robinson
created on the screen. The
fact that Dern has already
played this part, or a variation
of it, in about half a dozen
films is easily forgotten in the
withering glare of his scowl.
His menacing gestures come
less from real life than from
the gruesome repertoire of
Grand Guignol, yet Dern does
inject a needed sense of
urgency into the plot of "The
Driver."
But if the characters are es

sentially disembodied ghosts,
where is the interest of this
film? In the portentous re
marks everyone makes about
winning and losing, there
seems to be some nebulous
symbolism; maybe Hill has in
mind a message about life
being a gamble whose stakes
are finally not worth a sneeze.
But aside from the second
hand existentialism inherent
in that idea, it's hard to piece
together any consistent mean
ing from meager clues. Fi
nally, it's fair to guess that Hill
is bluffing the intellectual
weight of his own hand. For
while his direction does pro
ject some of the bleak mood
of the post-war crime film, the
so-called "film noir," his own
film has neither the
psychological perception nor
the philosophical rigor to
leave a lasting impression.
So if not an art film in com
mercial garb, what is "The
Driver?" As a cops-and
robbers, it's got great car ch
ases and the obligatory share
of violent deaths, but none of
the human suppleness that
draws an audience into a plot
and gives it a sense of partici
pation. It's possible you may
see "The Driver" and find it a
taut and moody underworld
film. You may even be con
vinced by its gesturing after
significance. But to me it looks
like a concoction of car chases
and existential cliches, set to
simmer in the grim workshop
of television writing.
My advice on this one is,
drive on.
