# Community doctors defeated
## Hospital restricts lab work 
### Jim Tranquada 
In a major declaration of pol
icy in the continuing
philosophical rift between Stan
ford Hospital and community
doctors, the Hospital directors
decided Tuesday to continue to
restrict hospital based clinical
services to faculty physicians.
Hospital based clinical ser
vices include anesthesia, car
diology, pathology, radiology
and other specialized
laboratories. However, hospital
wards and surgery will remain
available to local physicians "in
the foreseeable future."
The board's decision to up
hold the "closed staff " policy is a
serious setback for local physi
cians, many of whom are mem
bers of the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic. Ever since Stanford
bought the hospital in 1968, the
University has given first priority
to teaching and research, while
local doctors have maintained
that allowing full access to non
faculty physicians is perfectly
compatible with these two func
tions.
"It has always been our feeling
that it is a combined
community-University hospital
. . . that we could have the best
of both worlds," said Dr. Robert
)amplis, medical director of
PAMC. "We have also thought
that if we can't solve the town
gown problem here, then it can 't
be solved anywhere."
The one aspect of the direc
tors decision that "really dis
turbs" (amplis, is the restriction
of anethesia to faculty only.
"That is totally wrong, in my es
timation," he said, explaining
that while PAMC has "the most
sophisticated outpatient clinic in
the country," it still needs access
to a limited number of clinical
services that only Stanford can

provide. Of these, the need is
greatest for anesthesia.
"We wouldn't (have made the
decision) unless we had strong
reasons to do so," explained Dr.
Clayton Rich, Dean of the Medi
cal School.
Rich said the "long term qual
ity of the medical school as an
organization would suffer," and
that top faculty could be lost, if
the restriction on clinical ser
vices was not in effect.
"The environment on those
services is unattractive for fa
culty when large numbers of
people from the outside also
have access," he said. In this
situation, top faculty might seek
positions elsewhere.
Rich said that restrictions on
hospital-based clinical services
can be found at "a great majority
of community hospitals
elsewhere." Other factors cited
in the directors decision was that
clinical service restrictions fos
ter high quality medical care,
and that the hospital has no legal
obligation to provide these ser
vices, nor moral obligation ". . .
when the research and teaching
activities of the School of
Medicine might be jeopar
dized," while they are required
by the hospital bylaws and arti
cles of incorporation to support
research and teaching.
Rich said that "there was no
solution that the directors could
find that satisfies the views and
needs of the faculty and at the
same time the desires, viewsand
needs of doctors in private prac
tice.
"The problem is that the two
points of view are contradic
tory," he said.
The directors' decision came
after a six-month review that was
instigated after Dr. William
Hayden, a Palo Alto radiologist,

sued Stanford in March, 1977,
seeking admission to the hospi
tal staff.
The lawsuit was dropped this
February when the hospital ag
reed to give Hayden clinical
privileges.
Dean Rich acknowledged,
however, that the new policy
statement would not prevent
Stanford from facing new law
suits in the future.
The 41 community doctors
who hold clinical services out of
the 550 community physicians
on the staff will be allowed to
retain this privilege, according
to the directors' decision.
