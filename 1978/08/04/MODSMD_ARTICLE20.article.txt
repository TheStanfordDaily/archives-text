## 'Foul Play': easy-to-swallow summer cinema 
### 
It's too bad that Hollywood
[makes so few good summer
[movies. Moviehouses tradition
ally do their best business dur
ing the summer months when
[the entire under-18 audience
land most of the under-24 audi
[ence is out of school and on the
[prowl for diversion. People are
[generally more active during the
[summer and after a day at the
fball park or even thirty minutes
!with a frisbee, an evening of cold
beer and warmed-over re-runs
•isn't going to fill the entertain
ment bill. A fun fantasy trip to
|the cool, dark cavern of the
fmagic lantern, however, fits
right in. Summer, then, is the
sbest time to see movies.
Catch
But there is a catch. People go
"to movies which suit their
moods, especially between |une
and September. The summer is
active and its active participants
want action in their movies.
They want something that
moves fast, something that
thrills and gallops away with
their imagination.
It must be light. There are few
bigger downers than seeing a
Sad movie in the "good ole
summertime." Snappy dialogue
and some good hearty laughts
get the blood flowing and in
crease the enjoyment. "Light"
also describes the optimal
theme. Summer movies are best
without dire profundities and
deep insights into the human
condition. No one wants to walk
away from a movie into a warm,

starry night lugging a film's mes
sage like a woolen overcoat. Ac
tion, levity and simplicity are de
sirable qualities in a vacation
movie. It's no coincidence that
filmdom's all-time grosser, "Star
Wars," (released last June), is
also a damned good summer
movie.
Unfortunately, Hollywood has
misunderstood these qualities
and has few worthwhile offer
ings this summer. Say "action"
to the media moguls and they
think "violence." Then we get
ravenous sharks, killer bees and
murderous children. Disney
Studios take "levity" and
"simplicity" back to the third
grade level and so most of us will
probably skip "The Cat from
Outer Space."
Indulgent theory
This indulgent foray into "The
Theory of Summer Cinema" is
an elaborate preparation for a
very favorable appraisal of "Foul
Play," which, in my opinion, is
the summer's best release so far.
The preparation was necessary
because every "serious" critic
has panned it so far. The movie
has many obvious flaws but then
so do the critical verdicts. Few
critics pay any attention to the
pure entertainment value of a
film. But entertainment value
should be a prime concern in
considering a summer movie.
Time magazine devoted a spe
cial section to "Summer Read
ing," then poo-pooed "Foul
Play" the next week without any

similar vernal consideration. It's
a real shame, too, because "Foul
Play is very much a "fun" movie.
It features Chevy Chase (re
member him?) and Goldie Hawn
in the leading roles and is writ
ten and directed by Colin Hig
gins, who brought us last year's
other good summer movie,
"Silver Streak."
The plot is familiar enough.
Goldie Hawn is a recent divor
cee who works in a San Fran
cisco library. At a Marin County
party she is advised by a friend
to "get out and circulate."
Chevy Chase gallantly offers
himself as another "fish in the
sea" but is snubbed by the pretty
Ms. Hawn who calls him some
thing unpleasant and leaves. On
her way back to the City, she
picks up a handsome man
whose car has broken down
and, seeing Fate at work, she
strikes up an acquaintance with
her fidgety passenger. They
make a date for that night and
she lets him out, not noticingthe
ominous black limo that has
been following them. Ms. Hawn
waits in vain for him at the ap
pointed cinema and finally goes
inside.
Body disappears
He arrives later but since he is
freshly gunshot, he only stays
long enough to bleed in her
popcorn, warn her about a cer
tain "dwarf," die and have his
body disappear when Ms. Hawn
runs for help. From then on she
is pursued by all sorts of baddies
who want to kill her and she
even makes another disappear

ing body. When the police give
up on her as another dizzy
blonde affected by paraquat,
Chevy Chase (ah, Fate) steps in
as the cop who will save her life,
fit the loose ends together, foil
the assasination and fall in love
with Ms. Hawn in the remaining
reel-and-a-half.
Chevy Chase is a remarkably
believable S.F. detective whose
casually Eastern manner comes
off very well. It takes awhile to
see him in close-up and not ex
pect his face to erupt into a
ridiculous expression, but his
acting ability becomes apparent
fairly early on. It's good to see
him again after his departure
from "Saturday Night Live" and,
for all of us who remember his
Gerald Ford falls and klutz at
tacks, he provides enough with
out becoming silly.
Goldie Hawn's acting has de
finitely improved since her last
screen appearance ("Sham
poo"). She is finally able to con
vey a bright, sunny personality
without constant childish giggl
ing. Her wardrobe is also well
suited to a mature human being
rather than a cutsey-pie and
places her excellently in the Bay
Area style of "chic and earthy."
Colin Higgins' directing is
adequate but often uneven, as is
the storyline. There is too much
reliance on coincidence and
chance to make it totally accept
able. Higgins' genius is fitting
the movie so beautifully into its
setting. San Francisco and "Foul
Play" are an inspired match. The
film fills itself with the colors of

Nob Hill and Mason Street, of
bright brownstones and the
Opera House and never has to
resort to the gaudy cliches of
Fisherman's Wharf or Polk
Street.
Caen country characters
The director has ably charac
terized the City's inhabitants as
well and the movie is brim full
with thumbnail sketches of the
lovably eccentric residfents of
Caen Country. Burgess
Meredith shines as a charming
landlord who's a retired an
thropologist, a karate expert
who has a pet boa constrictor.
Dudley Moore is a swinging
single transplant from London in
search of the perfect one-night
stand with the aid of blow-up
dolls and a musical bed. There is
also a chic feminist who bran
dishes brass knuckles and mace,
and a pair of old ladies who play
Scrabble with four letter words.
Since the movie is set in San
Francisco, there is the obligatory
high-speed chase down the hills.
It's actually pretty hilarious to
watch Chevy Chase turn the City
into a torture track for an Italian
restaurant, three chase cars and
a pair of newly arrived Japanese
tourists.
All in all "Foul Play" is a very
good "sit back and enjoy it"
movie, and, overlooking its
shortcomings, isn't too hard to
swallow for two hours of solid
summer entertainment. Still, if
you'd like more substance in
your film diet, I'm sure there'll
be a Bergman double feature
around here by early fall.

grade level and so most of us will
probably skip "The Cat from
Outer Space."
Indulgent theory
This indulgent foray into "The
Theory of Summer Cinema" is
an elaborate preparation for a
very favorable appraisal of "Foul
Play," which, in my opinion, is
the summer's best release so far.
The preparation was necessary
because every "serious" critic
has panned it so far. The movie
has many obvious flaws but then
so do the critical verdicts. Few
critics pay any attention to the
pure entertainment value of a
film. But entertainment value
should be a prime concern in
considering a summer movie.
Time magazine devoted a spe
cial section to "Summer Read
ing," then poo-pooed "Foul
Play" the next week without any

similar vernal consideration. It's
a real shame, too, because "Foul
Play is very much a "fun" movie.
It features Chevy Chase (re
member him?) and Goldie Hawn
in the leading roles and is writ
ten and directed by Colin Hig
gins, who brought us last year's
other good summer movie,
"Silver Streak."
The plot is familiar enough.
Goldie Hawn is a recent divor
cee who works in a San Fran
cisco library. At a Marin County
party she is advised by a friend
to "get out and circulate."
Chevy Chase gallantly offers
himself as another "fish in the
sea" but is snubbed by the pretty
Ms. Hawn who calls him some
thing unpleasant and leaves. On
her way back to the City, she
picks up a handsome man
whose car has broken down
and, seeing Fate at work, she
strikes up an acquaintance with
her fidgety passenger. They
make a date for that night and
she lets him out, not noticingthe
ominous black limo that has
been following them. Ms. Hawn
waits in vain for him at the ap
pointed cinema and finally goes
inside.
Body disappears
He arrives later but since he is
freshly gunshot, he only stays
long enough to bleed in her
popcorn, warn her about a cer
tain "dwarf," die and have his
body disappear when Ms. Hawn
runs for help. From then on she
is pursued by all sorts of baddies
who want to kill her and she
even makes another disappear

ing body. When the police give
up on her as another dizzy
blonde affected by paraquat,
Chevy Chase (ah, Fate) steps in
as the cop who will save her life,
fit the loose ends together, foil
the assasination and fall in love
with Ms. Hawn in the remaining
reel-and-a-half.
Chevy Chase is a remarkably
believable S.F. detective whose
casually Eastern manner comes
off very well. It takes awhile to
see him in close-up and not ex
pect his face to erupt into a
ridiculous expression, but his
acting ability becomes apparent
fairly early on. It's good to see
him again after his departure
from "Saturday Night Live" and,
for all of us who remember his
Gerald Ford falls and klutz at
tacks, he provides enough with
out becoming silly.
Goldie Hawn's acting has de
finitely improved since her last
screen appearance ("Sham
poo"). She is finally able to con
vey a bright, sunny personality
without constant childish giggl
ing. Her wardrobe is also well
suited to a mature human being
rather than a cutsey-pie and
places her excellently in the Bay
Area style of "chic and earthy."
Colin Higgins' directing is
adequate but often uneven, as is
the storyline. There is too much
reliance on coincidence and
chance to make it totally accept
able. Higgins' genius is fitting
the movie so beautifully into its
setting. San Francisco and "Foul
Play" are an inspired match. The
film fills itself with the colors of

Nob Hill and Mason Street, of
bright brownstones and the
Opera House and never has to
resort to the gaudy cliches of
Fisherman's Wharf or Polk
Street.
Caen country characters
The director has ably charac
terized the City's inhabitants as
well and the movie is brim full
with thumbnail sketches of the
lovably eccentric residfents of
Caen Country. Burgess
Meredith shines as a charming
landlord who's a retired an
thropologist, a karate expert
who has a pet boa constrictor.
Dudley Moore is a swinging
single transplant from London in
search of the perfect one-night
stand with the aid of blow-up
dolls and a musical bed. There is
also a chic feminist who bran
dishes brass knuckles and mace,
and a pair of old ladies who play
Scrabble with four letter words.
Since the movie is set in San
Francisco, there is the obligatory
high-speed chase down the hills.
It's actually pretty hilarious to
watch Chevy Chase turn the City
into a torture track for an Italian
restaurant, three chase cars and
a pair of newly arrived Japanese
tourists.
All in all "Foul Play" is a very
good "sit back and enjoy it"
movie, and, overlooking its
shortcomings, isn't too hard to
swallow for two hours of solid
summer entertainment. Still, if
you'd like more substance in
your film diet, I'm sure there'll
be a Bergman double feature
around here by early fall.

It's too bad that Hollywood
[makes so few good summer
[movies. Moviehouses tradition
ally do their best business dur
ing the summer months when
[the entire under-18 audience
land most of the under-24 audi
[ence is out of school and on the
[prowl for diversion. People are
[generally more active during the
[summer and after a day at the
fball park or even thirty minutes
!with a frisbee, an evening of cold
beer and warmed-over re-runs
•isn't going to fill the entertain
ment bill. A fun fantasy trip to
|the cool, dark cavern of the
fmagic lantern, however, fits
right in. Summer, then, is the
sbest time to see movies.
Catch
But there is a catch. People go
"to movies which suit their
moods, especially between |une
and September. The summer is
active and its active participants
want action in their movies.
They want something that
moves fast, something that
thrills and gallops away with
their imagination.
It must be light. There are few
bigger downers than seeing a
Sad movie in the "good ole
summertime." Snappy dialogue
and some good hearty laughts
get the blood flowing and in
crease the enjoyment. "Light"
also describes the optimal
theme. Summer movies are best
without dire profundities and
deep insights into the human
condition. No one wants to walk
away from a movie into a warm,

starry night lugging a film's mes
sage like a woolen overcoat. Ac
tion, levity and simplicity are de
sirable qualities in a vacation
movie. It's no coincidence that
filmdom's all-time grosser, "Star
Wars," (released last June), is
also a damned good summer
movie.
Unfortunately, Hollywood has
misunderstood these qualities
and has few worthwhile offer
ings this summer. Say "action"
to the media moguls and they
think "violence." Then we get
ravenous sharks, killer bees and
murderous children. Disney
Studios take "levity" and
"simplicity" back to the third
grade level and so most of us will
probably skip "The Cat from
Outer Space."
