An Unmarried Woman •••
Biograph
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and
Tonto') warm and intelligent look at
'70's divorce. )ill Clayburgh finally
gets a role which is equal to her talent,
and she doesn't disappoint.
The film is a bit slow in its middle
third, where there are some very weak
scenes with a therapist. However, in
general the film is comic and affecting
without being cruel or saccharine,
Alan Bates stands out in a fine sup
porting cast.
With '7% Solution."
—Ron Lillejord
Madame Rosa * ★ ★ ★
Aquarius
)ust what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy on
the pathos. Simone Signoret makes
the film worthwhile with her perfor
mance as an aging whore — she easily
overcomes the occasionally dumb
dialogue, and often provides humor
at unexpected moments. With "Dear
Detective."
—John Nielsen
The Cheap Detective ★ *
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big
Sleep" or "The Maltese Falcon,"
some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's dippiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al
most keeps you from realizing how
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise
Fletcher can be. Ann-Margret's
Rumanian cleavage is much in evi
dence.
—Bill Burger
Crease * ★ *
Old Mill
It was a dumb play, so don't expect a
brilliant movie. "Crease" has no so
cial commentary or serious insight
into the '50s. It's just good, Creasy
fun.

The Wizard of Oz *****
New Varsity
Friday, August 4
Movies in movie theaters are diffe
rent from movies on television. On
television "Oz" is merely appealing —
at the movies, when everything is 20
times the size you're used to, the pic
ture well deserves its mythic status.
None of the acting falls apart on a
huge screen; none of the singing
cracks when heard through a woofer,
and life-size munchkins are some
thing to behold. With "Singing in the
Rain."

Singing in the Rain ****
New Varsity
Friday, August 4
Cene Kelly. Also Donald O'Conner
and Debbie Reynolds. Considerable
evidence as to why the latter remain
on talk shows to this day — even a
better explanation of why Kelly's

dance is on file at the Smithsonian,
next to Paul Robeson singing "Old
Man River," before Kelly again, in
"American in Paris." One of the finest
musicals extant. With "Oz" (not
"Wiz" — "Oz").

Star Wars ★ * ★
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly enter
taining and wildly visual 2) wildly en
tertaining and stunningly visual 3) the
kind of movie nobody makes any
more. On second thought it's delib
erately anesthetic; little more than the
financial successor to "laws." Except
for Alec (.uiness the .k tors are not
unlike Barbie dolls, or escapees from
episode of Lassie; though Lucas is to
be praised for avoiding the asinine
political commentary implicit in
things like "Rollerball" and "Logan's
Run" his decision to center the action
around the aformentioned members
of the Pepsi Generation rankles and
irks and peeves. True "2001'' fans in
sist that for all its visual achievements
"Star Wars" is really very bland —
even though I still don't know what
the hell was going on in Kubrick's
movie I am tempted to agree.

The Driver •
Fine Art
A chase movie with Levels of In
terpretation. A chase movie with
Bruce Dern, Ryan O'Neal and Isabel
Ajani. A "stark realism" motif, a "cars
have lives of their own" motif, a "who
needs a screenwriter anyhow?" motif.
A B movie that you will dislike in a way
that you have never disliked a B movie
before, one that proves now and
forever that automobiles cannot act,
and that Bruce Dern needs a tune-up.
See today's review.

Lawrence of Arabia ★ ★ ★ # ★
New Varsity
Stanford students have a stake in
the story of Col. T.E. Lawrence. He
was once refused admission to a party
that was held at a certain English man
sion which was to become an over
seas campus for a major American
university. Lawrence was a sort of
James Dean with a grand panache.
This is Peter O'Toole's best role. The
careers of Anthony Quinn and Omar
Sharif were secure after this picture,
lose Ferrer is superb as a Turkish gen
eral; a striking and even sympathetic
portrayal of a homosexual done in the
days when gays were not seen, heard
or even admitted to. This film is prob

ably the most decorated of all specta
cles. The Oscars it won are thicker
than mosques in Mecca. Playing with
"A Man for All Seasons."
—Vincent Warren
International Velvet ■£
Old Mill 6
A sodden remake (demakef un
make?) of a Liz Fischer picture. Tatum
O'Neil no longer oozes charm. She
rides horses, and deja-vuzes all who
will admit to having seen the original,
but she doesn't really, and it shows.
She's losing her zip, that kid.
—J.N.
M.A.S.H. **•*•
Memorial Auditorium
Sunday, August 6
Things you've forgotten if you've
ever watched the T.V. show: 1) There
is evil in this movie — the tortures
inflicted by Gould and Sutherland are
not entirely laughable. 2) More than
anything else, this is a movie about
people at war, about the ways that
people die when at war. 3) Robert
Altman mikes excellent use of loose
ends. The movie is full of cinematic
debris as well as pieces of theme — it
is not slick, and does not stomach
well, and it was very, very good, and
gets better with age.
—J.N.

Dear Detective
Aquarius
A murder mystery. A comedy. A
romance. French. Distinguishable
from grade-B American formulas by a
French charm infused by director Phil
lipe De Broca, the creative genius re
sponsible for the classic "King of
Hearts." Standard motifs are given
non-standard ironic twists, but it is
difficult at times to distinguish bet
ween formula and parody, between
the assumptions the director shares
with society and the ones he is mock
ing. The leads, though, are consis
tantly good; the direction never lags;
the cinematography is a constant joy.
A murder that is a real mystery and a
romance that is a real comedy —
sometimes the two conflict, but for
the most part the picture works well.
With "Madame Rosa."
—Alisome Parker

A movie about killer bees. John Be

I refuse to see this movie. I refuse to
allow anyone else to see this movie.
Shouldn't have even mentioned it in
the first place.
