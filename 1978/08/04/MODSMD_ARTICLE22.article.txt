Robert's
Restaurant Francais
1701 Octavia
San Francisco
931-1030
Simple, smart, and sophisti
cated — three words that cap
ture a dining experience re
staurant owner, Robert Bitton,
spells but one way — Robert's.
Neither a neighborhood bis
tro, nor a cloud-capped Cordon
Bleu, Robert's is one of San
Francisco's highly personal re
staurants. It's an establishment
where a well-dressed and beaut

ifully coiffured clientele makes
for an interesting and important
ambiance.
What looks like a restored
turn-of-the-century drugstore is
now the home of Mr. Bitton's
restaurant. Appointed with
white and pink linen and fresh
bud roses, the single dining
room is a study in understated
elegance. White walls, mirrors
on one side and two large win
dows up front lend a crisp open
ness to the restaurant that is un
fortunately diminished by trying
to -eat too many people in the

available space.
Thoroughly French, the menu
encompasses a list of nine regu
lar a la carte entrees, plus one
daily special and a choice of
eight other dishes served with
soup and salad. Single entrees
manage good coverage with
Truite Maison ($8.50), Veau Pic
cata ($9.75) and Entrecote Bor
delaise (a New York cut for $11),
as well as the less conventional
Canard a L'Orange (duckling
with orange sauce, $8.50), and
Langoustines (baby lobster tails,
$11). Complete dinners include

a spicy marinated beef brochette
($11), sweetbreads ($8.75), and a
choice of chicken, seafood, or
spinach crepes ($8.50).
We selected the Veau au
Champagne ($9.75) and Filet de
Sole Maison ($8.50).
Skipping the three a la carte
appetizers, Escargots de Bour
gogne ($3.50), Pate de Capagne
($2.75) and Coquille St. Jacques
($3.25), we began with an order
of onion soup ($2.75) and a pep
pery Cream of Broccoli included
in the filet of sole dinner. Like
the earthenware crock of onion
soup with its rich broth and half
inch layer of melted Romano
and Parmesan cheeses, the
well-seasoned broccoli soup
was an auspicious start to a per
fectly French meal.
Tips of sharply-flavored Bel
gian endive accented by a light
dressing (ordered a la carte at
$2.75) and the Salade Verte, also
included with the sole, followed
in good order. Delightfully sim
ple, the house salad consisted of
butter lettuce, fresh and crisp,
with a blue cheese dressing in
corporating a hint of mustard.
With both of these, a flowery
Puilly Fuisse ($l3 a bottle) and a
basket of thinly-sliced bagettes
made a pleasant combination.
Having enjoyed the efficiency
and care with which our meal
had thus far been presented, we
noted that the service remained
professional and smooth
throughout.
Robert's wine list is predo
minantly French and runs
through a variety of labels that
begin with an unnamed Macon
Blanc for $8 on up to a Graves
(1970) Chateau Haut Brion for
$45. Those in between include a
Barre Freres Muscadet at $7 a
bottle and a Pomerol (1970)
Chatreau LaFleui at $18 a bottle.
California wines are not nearly
as well-represented with only a
half dozen labels offered. The
house wine, $5 a carafe for chab
lis, $8 for beaujolais, is San Mar
tin from a second-rate local

wineyard.
Delicately cooked and sea
soned, the white veal was
nonetheless too heavily-sauced.
More mushrooms and less
cream would have been an im
provement here. The filet of sole
was, on the other hand, received
without compromise. Sur
rounded by scallops and baby
shrimp and blanketed with a vel
vety cream sauce that had just a
touch of white pepper and
lemon juice, the sole was
awarded the evening's highest
rating.
The vegetables, stringbeans
and carrots, and the boiled,
parsleyed potatoes accompany
ing the seafood and the
chicken-flavored rice with the
veal were good but undistin
guished.
We had bypassed the hors
d'oeuvres and consequently felt
justified in ordering dessert
from among eight tempting
choices that included a marvel
ously parfaited Hot Fudge Sun
dae ($1.50) and a more unusual
Poire Belle Helene (pears
poached in an aromatic red wine
syrup, $1.75). We decided on the
Peche Melba, a sweetly layered
creation of vanilla ice cream,
fresh peaches and raspberry
syrup ($1.75) and the Pro
fiteroles, small meringue puffs
arranged between dollops of
whipped and ice crem and lad
died with thick chocolate sauce
($2).
Small cups of good French
coffee (.75) completed dinner
with an extra gold star.
With more than its share of
culinary pluses, Robert's offers a
dining experience above most.
Simple, smartand sophisticated,
Robert spells it right.
