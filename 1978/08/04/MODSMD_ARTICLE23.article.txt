La Mere Duquesne recreates the glowing am
biance of a 19th century French farming estate.
iLocated at 101 Shannon, just off of Geary between
Taylor and )ones, the restaurant attracts a large
before-theater clientele and provides attentive
service to accommodate that 8:30 curtain time.
We decided to begin our meal with the tradi
tionally French les escargots and a more imagina
tive fish pate. Expertly prepared, Les Escargots le
Bourgogne ($3.75) were seeping in butter and
touched with just the right amount of garlic. The
fish pate was a light, smooth-textured creation of
spinach and water cress surrounding chunks of
salmon and plump slices of mushroom.
A basket of soft and chewy bagettes and a crock
of sweet creamed butter accompanied our ap
petizers.
La Soupe du Jour and la Salade Verte, which are
in the price of the entrees, followed
promptly. The hospitality of the French country
manor was exhibited when the waiter brought a
small pot of potato-leek soup to our table and
ladeled it out before us.
A simple salad of butter lettuce in a pleasant oil
and vinegar dressing directly preceded our en
trees, rather than coming afterward in the typical
European fashion.
Having chosen from a sizable assortment of dis
hes, we Were presented with the special of the

day, recommended to us by the chef himself, and
the Filet de Boeuf en Croute (Beef Wellington,
$10.75). The special was something out of the or
dinary that both my companion and I enjoyed.
Fresh boned squab and pate de foie (goose livers)
stuffed in a delicate pastry crust.
The Beef Wellington, also in a flaky crust and
nut-meg laced truffle sauce, was superior in prep
aration, yet the meat itself was somewhat tough.
Both dinners came with sauteed vegetables:
French-cut green beans, zucchini and carrots
sprinkled with parsley and another specialty of the
house — pomme de terre souffles. The pomme de
terre souffle was a combination of mashed
potatoes, flour, eggs and a dash of nutmeg deep
fried in a crispy batter.
After reviewing an extensive list of properly
priced French and California wines, we chose a
bottle of La Mere Duquene's own label ($6.50). A
strong bouquet and the sharp individuality of this
white wine went with not only the poultry dish,
but the beef as well.
Sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with
a thick vanilla cream sauce, the Grand Marnier
Souffle was an exquisite tribute to the chef. As is
the case at most restaurants, his delicious dessert
which billows elegantly from individual souffle
dishes must be ordered in advance to allow for
baking time.
For excellent French cuisir:*? in an authentic set
ting, try La Mere Duquesne, you won't be disap
pointed.
