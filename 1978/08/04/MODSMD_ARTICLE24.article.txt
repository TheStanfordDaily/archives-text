# Space settlements possible

Living in space will be techni
cally feasible in less than 50
years, according to John Billin
gham, chief of the Extraterrest
rial Biology Division at the
NASA-Ames Rsearch Center. Ac
tual construction of a space set
tlement is probably much
farther away, he said in a speech
on space settlements Wednes
day night in Skilling Auditorium.
Citing critics who believe the
proposed $200 billion cost of
space settlements could be put
to better use on more earthly
matters, Billingham said, "We
just don't know if the human
race is interested in a new fron
tier right now."
He did point out, though, that
as a new source of electrical

energy a space settlement would
be capable of paying for itself
within 50 years. "Money is not
the main obstacle. The concept
is so new that there is not
enough will or support to do it at
this time."
The key to constructing a
space settlement (previously cal
led "colonies" until a State De
partment request to do other
wise) is to minimize the need for
using the earth's resources and
to depend on the raw materials
of space instead. Billingham
elaborated on two methods
which have been studied exten
sively that would do just that.
One, called a Mass Driver,
would propel rocks and soil
from the moon to a receiving sta
tion in space at the rate of

600,000 tons a year.
Another similar method is to
use a "portable" Mass Driver to
collect material from asteroids.
It is still not known for sure,
Billingham said, whether a
"closed, artificial ecological sys
tem" can work. But, he said, "I
suspect that some time, some
people, somewhere will want to
try this just as others once
traveled the seas to see what was
on the other side."
Billingham's lecture was the
sixth in a series of seven being
given as part of the 15th Annual
Stanford-NASA-ASEE Aerospace
Technology Seminar. Next
Wednesday Leonard Roberts
wiJI speak on "Air Transporta
tion in the 1980's — Its Prospects
and Problems."

The Medical Center's five-year roof replacement program is underway, as the tar cooker testifies.
Re-roofing of the hospital core and the medical center is expected by early next month.
