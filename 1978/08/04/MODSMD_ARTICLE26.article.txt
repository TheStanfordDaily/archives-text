U.S. reporters fined
Moscow — A Soviet court fined two
American correspondents $73 apiece
yesterday for failing to publish court
ordered retractions of stories they wrote
about a Soviet dissident.
Judge Lev Almazov of the Moscow City
Court gave New York Times correspon
dent Craig Whitney and Baltimore Sun
reporter Harold Piper five more days for
the retractions to be published. He said
they would face additional fines or un
specified "different measures" if they
failed to meet the new deadline.
Neither man was present in the Mos
cow court. Their newspapers have said
they will not retract the reporters' stories
about Georgian political dissident Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
The papers have offered to share pay
ment of the $3342 in court costs levied
against the newsmen in the original July
18 ruling by Almazov's court, as well as
any additional fines.
Bizarre suicides in Utah
Salt Lake City — With her husband
dead of suicide, a woman and her seven
children plunged 11 floors from the bal
cony of a downtown Salt Lake City hotel
yesterday in an apparent act of religious
zealotry, police said. The mother and six
of the children died.
Police and witnesses said the woman,
Rachel David, 38, pushed some of the
children as they screamed and struggled
to hold onto a railing and at least three
older children "jumped of their own voli
tion."
A 13-year-old girl survived and was in
critical condition.
Police said the bizarre deaths came
four days after Immanuel David, 39, a
bearded loner who thought he was God,

committed suicide by inhaling carbon
monoxide.
"All indications are they were religious
fanatics and decided to join the father,"
said police Lt. Nick Paloukos.
"He believed he was the Holy Ghost,
Jesus Christ and God — all three at the
same time," said police Sgt. Brent Davis,
who said he was a personal friend of
David's.
Pinochet on extradition
Santiago, Chile — President Augusto
Pinochet said Wednesday that murder
indictments in Washington against three
former Chilean security officials are only
accusations and nobody will be extra
dited without proof of guilt.
The president's comments at a break
fast meeting with reporters apparently
were part of a government effort to head
off public alarm and were made before
the U.S. House of Representatives voted
to cut off all American arms shipments to
Chile until the government turns the
three men over to the United States.
The Chilean government ordered the
arrest of the accused army men at the
request of the American Embassy a few
hours after a grand jury in Washington
issued indictments Tuesday in the 1976
murder of exiled Chilean socialist Or
lando Letelier.
Ford recalls autos
Detroit — Ford Motor Co. will recall
the first 1,475,000 cars and light trucks it
built in North America in the 1978 model
year to correct an emissions defect, the
company said yesterday.
A valve in the emissions control system
might become disengaged and release
gasoline fumes into the air, the company
said.

Donald Jensen, director of automotive
emissions and fuel economy, confirmed
a report by the bimonthly trade publica
tion, Ward's Engine Update. He said
owners would be notified of the recall
later this month.
The recalled autos constitute about
half of Ford's output for the model year.
Ford has sold about 2,270,000 cars in the
United States this model year. Trucks
and Canadian sales are not included in
that figure.
Suit against Briggs initiative
Los Angeles — A lawsuit alleging mis
representation, fraud, forgery and per
jury was filed yesterday against officials
responsible for placing an initiative that
would bar homosexuals from teaching in
California schools on the November bal
lot.
The suit filed in Superior Court at
tacked the manner in which signatures
were gathered and certified for the initia
tive authored by state Sen. John Briggs
(R-Fullerton) and named Briggs, Secret
ary of State March Fong Eu, Attorney
General Evelle Younger and the regis
trars of voters and clerks for each of
California's 58 counties as defendants.
"We're asking for several things," said
Morris Kight, chairman of the No on 6
Committee that filed the suit. "The first
thing is for the court to issue a writ of
mandate to start all over counting the
356,000 signatures, since the rate of
fraud, forgery, misrepresentation and
perjury was so very high."
Postal balloting continues
Washington — Postal employees began
mailing ratification ballots to 336,000
co-workers yesterday as union leaders
expressed hope that acceptance of a con

troversial contract settlement would end
threats of a mail strike.
"I think this vote may be a squeaker,
but I think it'll be approved," said a
spokesman for the American Postal
Workers Union, which started sending
out ballots yesterday morning after a
one-day delay caused by a union dissi
dent's court challenge.
Besides the APWU, which represents
300,000 clerks and other postal
employees, the 36,000-member
Mailhandlers Division of Laborers' Inter
national began mailing ratification bal
lots Thursday.
Swollen rivers ravage Texas
Bandera, Texas — The raging, overflow
ing rivers of central Texas left a trail of
death in the hill country yesterday and
headed for two dammed-up lakes, some
low-lying cities and the Lyndon Johnson
gravesite.
Officials' body counts ranged from
nine to 15 as police and rescue agencies
tried to coordinate efforts in areas where
phone communication was knocked out
and travel was difficult.
The Pedernales and Guadalupe rivers,
swollen by as much as 14 inches of new
rain yesterday and a two-day total of 30
inches, were under the eye of the Army
Corps of Engineers.
