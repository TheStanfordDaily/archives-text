# Bay Area renters agitate for relief
## 
### Evelyn Newell 
Palo Alto renters may soon be
paying lower rents as a result of
the overwhelming voter support
for an ordinance drawn up by
the Palo Alto Citizens for Rent
Relief.
The ordinance, created to
pass on Propostition 13 tax sav
ings to tenants, was presented to
the Palo Alto City Council Tues
day morning. A total of 5722 sig
natiiros were obtained on peti
tions backing up the ordinance,
which is over 1000 more than
were needed to place it on the
November ballot. It is now up to
the City Council to either ap
prove or reject the proposal.
According to Don Surath, rep
resenting the Palo Alto Citizens
for Rent Relief, the proposed
ordinance is advantageous to
both tenants and landlords. It
grants benefits to renters in the
form of rent reductions based
on the landlords' tax savings
from Proposition 13.
In addition, the ordinance
permits landlords to pass
through documentable net in
creases in the costs they must
pay as well as insuring a reason
able rate of return on invest
ment.
"The ordinance, which will go

into effect on January 1 after tax
bills are received, will give a rent
reduction over a 12-month
period," Surath said.
He emphasized that it is not a
form of rent control.
Tenants' concern over rent is
evident not only in Palo Alto, but
throughout the peninsula. Palo
Alto citizens were able to im
plement their petition campaign
quickly because in Palo Alto,
citizens need to wait only one
day after the pui>Hcnt<o»i of «n
issue before they can begin
gathering petition signatures.
In cities such as Menlo Park
and Mountain View, people
must wait 21 days after the publi
cation of an issue.
Renters in San Jose and San
Francisco are equally perturbed
over the tax inequity created be
tween renters and homeowners
as a result of Prop. 13, but the
size of the two cities precludes
the quick, cohesive action wit
nessed in Palo Alto.
Landlords' reactions to the
ordinance have been mixed.
"Some landlords are upset,
but many have signed our peti
tion saying that they intend to
pass thorugh the tax savings to
tenants who in fact pay the land-

lords' property taxes," said
Surath.
The Palo Alto Citizens for Rent
Relief started with the impetus
of Surath, who called a general
meeting on June 21 asking Palo
Alto renters what they thought
about their rental costs. The
turn-out, 50, was sizable for a
city the size of Palo Alto. Many of
the renters complained not only
about the costs of their rents but
that they had actually received
rent increases after Prop. 13 pas
ses.
The group then decided to put
an initiative on the ballot to en
sure tax equity for renters. Peti
tions were drafted and "150 Palo
Altansfrom all walks of life, most
of whom had never met before,
carried the petitions," Surath
said.
"Never before in the history of
Palo Alto have so many signa
tures been gathered in such a
short period of time," Surath
said.
What happens now that the
petitions are in the hands of the
Palo Alto City Council? By Mon
day the city clerk will tell the
Citizens for Rent Relief whether

there are enough valid signa
tures. If there are, the clerk will
place the ordinance on the
council agenda for Aug. 14.
If the ordinance is approved as
it reads, it becomes law; if not,
an election campaign will be
launched.
