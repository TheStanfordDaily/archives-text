A recent CBS television spe
cial entitled, "The U.S. Army —
A Shocking State of Readiness,"
dealt with the problems faced by
the American military, it em
phasized the deteriorating qual
ity of our fighting forces and
combat equipment, particularly
in Western Europe, where the
threat of communist aggression
persists. In doing so, it indirectly
raised a heated question:
should the Selective Service Sys
tem be reactivated?
Our nation has been without a
draft since the Vietnam war and
has since relied upon attractive
advertising to recruit enlisted
men. The result has been a com
bat force composed primarily of
"losers," as one Army official
admitted — individuals with no
better opportunities on the out
side. Many of these soldiers
have been equally disappointed
with the military bureaucracy
due to failure to receive prom
ised assignments and/or train
ing. Worse yet, problems of
drug abuse, crime and equip
ment mismanagement run ram
pant within the military.
In view of these facts,
reinstitution of the draft might
conceivably be justified; how
ever, several factors would sig
nificantly impair the success of
such action. Memories of the
Vietnam conflict, a fiasco in
which thousands of Americans
were killed or maimed to no
end, still burn brightly in the
minds of our citizens. Without a
justifiable cause, such as direct
threat to the security of the Un
ited States, many young men
would simply refuse to comply.
The current popularity of the
equal rights concept would
further complicate any attempt
to reinstate the draft. Would
young women be equally sus
ceptible to induction, as they are
in Israel? Undoubtedly, some re
luctant male draftee would file
suit claiming that previous
Selective Service programs had
been discriminatory against his
sex and that women ought to be
affected by the new draft.
In support of Selective Ser
vice, I have heard it argued that
many of the social and adjust
ment problems of adolescence
would be solved by mandatory
induction. Certainly, it would
help to alleviate the current un
employment problem facing our
country. In addition, greater re
spect for our democratic system
and the personal freedoms it af
fords might result.
Bearing the preceding com
ments in mind, two major bene
ficial changes in our present sys
tem might be made. First, the
military should remain on a vol
unteer basis, but efforts should
be made to make it more attrac
tive to potential servicemen.
Upgraded training programs,
higher wages, better organiza

tion, improved living and work
ing conditions and adequate
post-service benefits would con
tribute to a higher quality fight
ing force.
Second, all men and women
should be required to serve their
country in some non-military
capacity for a specified period of
time. There are certainly many
useful projects which could be
undertaken in various
capacities, ranging from refores
tation and park maintenance to
child and geriatric care to con
struction of bicycle paths and
repair of highways. Indeed,
many of the services for which
we presently pay taxes could
conceivably be provided by an
inducted public service work
force.
