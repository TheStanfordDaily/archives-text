# Sororities and subjective selection
## 
### 
Greg Larson

A year ago, at its June 12 meet
ing, the Board of Trustees first
considered rescinding the ban
on sororities which had been in
effect since 1944. At that meet
ing, and for two meetings to fol
low, this issue was of sufficient
controversy to warrant long dis
cussions and passage of motions
to table (an action uncommon
for the board).
On Dec. 13, 1977, the board
finally voted to rescind the ban.
However, the vote was atypically
non-unanimous; in committee,
six members of the board voted
not to rescind the ban.
Given the legal requirements
of Title IX of the federal Educa
tion Amendments, there is little
doubt in my mind that the ban
should have been rescinded,
given that fraternities would be
allowed to stay. To permit one
type of housing for men, and to
deny such for women, is dis
crimination.
The unique characteristic of
fraternities, and now sororities,
is that their members are chosen
through a process labelled by
the University as "subjective
selectivity." In this process, the
current members of the
residence/organization select
new members based on per
sonal, subjective preferences.
A year ago, had I been a trus
tee, I would not have voted to
rescind the ban on sororities.
Rather, I would have tried to end
this aspect of Stanford's dis
crimination against women by
voting to ban fraternities as well,
and to thereby rid Stanford of
subjective selectivity altogether.
During this past year, how
ever, my views have changed.
Having worked and dealt with

fraternity members on a number
of projects, my stereotype of a
"frat-rat" has been somewhat
weakened. No longer are all
fraternity members conserva
tive, sexist, athletic and al
coholic. Many just prefer the re
lationships and bonds which are
established by living in a subjec
tively selective residence. Con
sequently, the University should
offer the alternative of subjec
tively selective houses to both
men and women.
The dangers of subjective
selectivity become real, how
ever, if its scope becomes too
large. For both the individual re
sidents and the campus in gen
eral, a large Creek system is a
negative factor.
One of the goals of an institu
tion of higher education should
be to expand one's awareness of
not only differing ideas, but of
different types of individuals as
well. But such becomes impos
sible if the number of residences
accorded the privilege of subjec
tive selectivity becomes large
enough to isolate the members
of such residences from the rest
of campus.
Another danger with a
flourishing Greek system is the
importance it would attain for
Stanford life in general. As we
learned prior to 1944 with
sororities, the importance of the
Greek system must never be
great enough to be a large de
terminant of the social status of a
significant number of students.
The problem, then, is one of
determining how best to keep
subjective selectivity as one par
ticular form of housing available
to students (both men and wo
men), yet to prevent it from be

coming too large of a system
within Stanford.
One solution, and I think the
best, would be to view subjec
tive selectivity as a finite re
source which the University
must allocate among conflicting
needs and wants. From this
perspective, determining the
scope of subjective selectivity
(i.e., the number of houses
committed to it) is the first deci
sion which must be made.
It would be easiest and most
convenient to assert that such a
decision has already been made
historically, and that subjective
selectivity should be permitted
by only 13 residences (the cur
rent number of fraternities).
While I view 13 as the upper limit
to the number of subjectively
selective houses Stanford
should have, a more equitable
and logical process for making
this decision would involve the
COSS-Subcommittee on Resi
dences.
Once a decision has been
made as to the optimal number
of residences which should be
permitted to use subjective
selectivity, the next question is
how to allocate those residences
among fraternities, sororities
and co-educational subjectively
selective residences. Such a task
would indeed be difficult, but
that is always the case when li
mited resources are being allo
cated.
Ideally, the decisions should
be made by a group of represen
tatives from all the varied in
terests involved, including
fraternities, sororities, Residen
tial Education, the student body
at large and others.
Using the current system as a

starting point, one could im
agine that under the system out
lined above, a new sorority
would be striving for space cur
rently held by a fraternity.
The University would then
have to decide which was most
important: the first sorority or
the thirteenth fraternity? It is
likely that such a process would
continue until equilibrium is
reached at the point where the
need and desire for an addi
tional sorority equals the need
and desire for an existing frater
nity.
Deciding which type of house
is most important, or who has
the greatest need, would be
anotherdifficulttask, butitisthe
fairest process available. It
should not come to pass that
fraternities and sororities, like
theme houses, compete for ad
ditional residences with the
housing system as a whole.

rent number of fraternities).
While I view 13 as the upper limit
to the number of subjectively
selective houses Stanford
should have, a more equitable
and logical process for making
this decision would involve the
COSS-Subcommittee on Resi
dences.
Once a decision has been
made as to the optimal number
of residences which should be
permitted to use subjective
selectivity, the next question is
how to allocate those residences
among fraternities, sororities
and co-educational subjectively
selective residences. Such a task
would indeed be difficult, but
that is always the case when li
mited resources are being allo
cated.
Ideally, the decisions should
be made by a group of represen
tatives from all the varied in
terests involved, including
fraternities, sororities, Residen
tial Education, the student body
at large and others.
Using the current system as a

starting point, one could im
agine that under the system out
lined above, a new sorority
would be striving for space cur
rently held by a fraternity.
The University would then
have to decide which was most
important: the first sorority or
the thirteenth fraternity? It is
likely that such a process would
continue until equilibrium is
reached at the point where the
need and desire for an addi
tional sorority equals the need
and desire for an existing frater
nity.
Deciding which type of house
is most important, or who has
the greatest need, would be
anotherdifficulttask, butitisthe
fairest process available. It
should not come to pass that
fraternities and sororities, like
theme houses, compete for ad
ditional residences with the
housing system as a whole.

A year ago, at its June 12 meet
ing, the Board of Trustees first
considered rescinding the ban
on sororities which had been in
effect since 1944. At that meet
ing, and for two meetings to fol
low, this issue was of sufficient
controversy to warrant long dis
cussions and passage of motions
to table (an action uncommon
for the board).
On Dec. 13, 1977, the board
finally voted to rescind the ban.
However, the vote was atypically
non-unanimous; in committee,
six members of the board voted
not to rescind the ban.
Given the legal requirements
of Title IX of the federal Educa
tion Amendments, there is little
doubt in my mind that the ban
should have been rescinded,
given that fraternities would be
allowed to stay. To permit one
type of housing for men, and to
deny such for women, is dis
crimination.
The unique characteristic of
fraternities, and now sororities,
is that their members are chosen
through a process labelled by
the University as "subjective
selectivity." In this process, the
current members of the
residence/organization select
new members based on per
sonal, subjective preferences.
A year ago, had I been a trus
tee, I would not have voted to
rescind the ban on sororities.
Rather, I would have tried to end
this aspect of Stanford's dis
crimination against women by
voting to ban fraternities as well,
and to thereby rid Stanford of
subjective selectivity altogether.
During this past year, how
ever, my views have changed.
Having worked and dealt with

fraternity members on a number
of projects, my stereotype of a
"frat-rat" has been somewhat
weakened. No longer are all
fraternity members conserva
tive, sexist, athletic and al
coholic. Many just prefer the re
lationships and bonds which are
established by living in a subjec
tively selective residence. Con
sequently, the University should
offer the alternative of subjec
tively selective houses to both
men and women.
The dangers of subjective
selectivity become real, how
ever, if its scope becomes too
large. For both the individual re
sidents and the campus in gen
eral, a large Creek system is a
negative factor.
One of the goals of an institu
tion of higher education should
be to expand one's awareness of
not only differing ideas, but of
different types of individuals as
well. But such becomes impos
sible if the number of residences
accorded the privilege of subjec
tive selectivity becomes large
enough to isolate the members
of such residences from the rest
of campus.
Another danger with a
flourishing Greek system is the
importance it would attain for
Stanford life in general. As we
learned prior to 1944 with
sororities, the importance of the
Greek system must never be
great enough to be a large de
terminant of the social status of a
significant number of students.
The problem, then, is one of
determining how best to keep
subjective selectivity as one par
ticular form of housing available
to students (both men and wo
men), yet to prevent it from be

coming too large of a system
within Stanford.
One solution, and I think the
best, would be to view subjec
tive selectivity as a finite re
source which the University
must allocate among conflicting
needs and wants. From this
perspective, determining the
scope of subjective selectivity
(i.e., the number of houses
committed to it) is the first deci
sion which must be made.
It would be easiest and most
convenient to assert that such a
decision has already been made
historically, and that subjective
selectivity should be permitted
by only 13 residences (the cur
rent number of fraternities).
While I view 13 as the upper limit
to the number of subjectively
