Sacramento, Calif. (AP) — A
possible trivia question for fu
ture political history buffs:
Howard Jarvis was the No. 1 man
in California's property tax re
volt — who was No. 2?
Answer: Paul Gann.
It could have been otherwise.
It might have been Gann, not
Jarvis, who became a household
word as the lead author of the $7
billion property tax cut measure
approved by voters June 6.
"It could have been the
Gann-Jarvis initiative," the 66-
year-old Gann said recently. "All
we had to do was start calling it
that.
"When we got together it was

suggested it be called the
Jarvis-Gann orGann-Jarvis initia
tive. I said, 'Let's call it Jarvis-
Gann because Howard's been
fighting this thing for 15 solid
years.' "
Jarvis, a crusty, 75-year-old
landlords' representative and
perennial political candidate,
quickly captured the attention of
the news media, and Gann was
relegated to a secondary role.
But Gann says that doesn't
bother him. "If it did, I would
hire myself a PR firm," he adds.
"If I wanted to create an image, I
could create it.
"I know who I am," he added.
"I don't have to have some re

porter tell me or have somebody
take my picture and tell me what
I look like."
Cann, a former real estate and
auto salesman spends his time
these days aiding tax revolts in
other states, pushing a constitu
tional amendment to limit gov
ernment spending in California
and overseeing implementation
of his tax cut initiative, a re
ferendum labeled Proposition
13on the June 6 primary election.
And he isn't happy with how
the initiative is being put into
effect. Cann is complaining that
fee increases and state aid have
left some local governments
with too much to spend and that
fire districts have too little.
"Nobody got short-changed
in the spreading around of the
state's money except the fire
men," he said. "I understand it
was created by a mistake in the
figures."
He said if the Legislature fails
to put a spending limit on the
November ballot, he'll push for
another initiative that would.
"Proposition 13 is no
panacea," Cann said. "It's a step
in the right direction. Appa
rently we are going to have to
continue legislating because it
doesn't look like they really got
the message at all."
Eventually, Gann wants to
eliminate about a fourth of
California's 1.4 million state and
local government jobs through
attrition, claiming such a move
would not hurt the quality of life
in this state of 22 million.
"We will still be the best taken
care of people in the world," he
says. "We have them public
employees running out of our
ears now."
