# State energy supply to last through 1990
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” California
will have enough electricity
through 1990 "if everyone keeps
his nose to the grindstone" and
finishes work on 49 power
plants, the state Energy Com
mission chairman said Wednes
day.
However, industry and labor
critics weren't reassured by
Richard Maullin's predictions
and called for abolition of the
Energy Commission, claiming it
has caused delays that will cost
California jobs, money and elec
tricity.
Maulin said Wednesday that
Energy Commission estimates
show the new plants are vital to
meet a 65 percent increase in
peak power demands by 1990.
"But consumers will have
more energy alternatives to
choose from," Maullin said,
stressing coal, geothermal, nuc
lear and solar power.
By 1995, he said, the commis
sion hopes to have reduced by
16 percent the state's reliance on
energy created by oil, which is
more expensive.
Maullin said the 49 power
plants, including oil, nuclear,
geothermal, hydroelectric, coal
and wind power, are new or are
being expanded, but at the same
ti me three oil-fueled planted will
be taken out of service.
He said by 1990 the state will
need 23,000 megawatts more
electricity than currently deli
vered, 4500 megawatts less than
predicted two years ago. He
credited the decrease to conser
vation efforts by businessmen
hit by rising power costs. A
megawatt is a million watts.
In an effort to speed de
velopment of new power plants,

Maullin said, the commission is
working to make it easier for
projects to be approved by the
government. But he denied the
simplification would be at the
expense of environmental con
cerns.
But in Sacramento the
California Council for Environ
mental and Economic Balance, a
labor-industry coalition, re
leased a study by two consulting
firms that warned of energy
shortages resulting from the
commission's restrictions on
new power plants.
The study, which Maullin cal
led an "ill-informed hatchet job"
said a moratorium on nuclear
plants, imposed by the commis
sion and state law, would cost
consumers $2.1 billion by 1995
and eliminate 20,000 jobs even if
all other plants could be built
without restriction.
The report also said that if
clean-air restrictions on coal
plants are continued or ex
panded, total losses will be $9.6
billion to $12 billion to consum
ers, 81,000 to 170,000 jobs and
extensive blackouts.
The council proposed abolish
ing the commission, transferring
most of its duties to a new De
partment of Energy under the
governor's office, and returning
to the state Public Utilities
Commission the authority to de
cide where and when new
power plants are built.
A bill passed by the Seante,
and awaiting Assembly commit
tee action, would abolish the
commission and transfer all its
duties, including power plant
siting, to a Department of
Energy. Brown has said he would
sign such a bill.
