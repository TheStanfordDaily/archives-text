# University wins round in lawsuit
## 
### John Nielsen 
A Santa Clara County Superior
Court judge has dismissed three
of four causes of action in a $1.2
million damage suit filed against
the Stanford Hospital.
The suit, brought by hospital
employee Conror McGee and
former employee Frank Petta, al
leged that three hospital ad
ministrators had "conspired" to
use hospital materials and labor

for their own benefit, and that
these administrators had at
tempted to remove employees
who would not help them "in a
systematic process of diverting
materials and labor from Stan
ford Univeristy construction
projects."
In addition to the hospital and
20 John Does, defendants
named included former
Facilities Director Jim McNally,

chief engineer William Ferguson
and general foreman David
Dominguez.
judge Marilyn Pestarino's rul
ing dismissed all action against
Ferguson and Dominguez, as
well as McCee's claim that Mc-
Nally had asked him to resign so
that Dominguez could be
named general foreman. McCee
refused, though Dominguez
was later named to the post.
Petta and McGee had each
sought $100,000 in general dam
ages and $500,000 in punitive
damages.
The court did not rule on Pet
ta's charge that McNally had
given him a poor job rating as a
result of his refusal to participate
in the alleged conspiracy, and
that this rating had prevented
him from obtaining other
employment after he left the
hospital.
McGee had claimed that he
"suffered humiliation, mental
anguish and emotional and
physical distress" because Mc-
Nally "withdrew all practical au
thority from McGee in violation
of personnel rules and proce
dures" established by the hospi
tal. Petta also claimed he suf
fered considerably at the hands
of McNally, and that he had
signed his resignation under
duress.
Petta and McGee had asked
for "special consideration" of a
request for an unspecified dam
age fee to be paid by the Univer
sity and one administrator col
lectively because the University
had allegedly confirmed and
ratified the administrators "wan
ton and reckless" actions. Judge
Pestarino's ruling dispensed
with that request.
When the suit was filed, hos
pital officials denied that the
hospital had acted improperly in
dealing with personnel actions
taken concerning Petta and
McGee.
The University's Department
of Internal Audit investigated
McNally and several other hos
pital officials. Hospital sources
reported that McNally was ac
cused of using University per
sonnel, paid on University time,
to do personal work. McNally's

workers allegedly used material
bought with University money.
Internal Audit found the other
officials accused "wholly inno
cent," and cleared them of all
charges. The results of the
examination of McNally were
never released.
McNally quit his position last
June, saying that "it seems an
appropriate time to submit my
resignation after achieving one
of my major goals" in organizing
the Facilities Department.
