## Stapleton sought no publicity

Los Angeles (AP) — Evangelist Ruth Carter
Stapleton said yesterday she never sought the
publicity she has received as President Jimmy Car
ter's sister, but she has decided to use it to help
spread her "ministry of healing" worldwide.
Stapleton, who was here to prepare her
schedule for the coming year, held a news con
ference to set the record straight on "misrep
resentations" in the news media which she said
have been used by other church leaders to dis
credit her.
"I've been trying to get them cleared up in a
positive way, to represent my ministry as it has
been for 21 years," said the soft-spoken faith
healer in a telephone interview.
At the news conference, she distributed a SVi
page statement setting down her religious beliefs
— she is a Southern Baptist who believes in "di
vine healing of the body and the mind" -— and
denied she was capitalizing on her relationship
with Carter to forward her ministry.
"Of course I am loyal to Jimmy, but I am also
serving Cod the best way I know how and that is
the only issue I recognize as valid," she said.
The statement also cited specific instances in
which she felt her statements were distorted.
"I may not always use precise terms and words
of theology as seminary trained theological minis

ters do. I minister to plain people in trouble," she
said. "I try to use terms which these persons can
understand."
However, Stapleton emphasized that she did
not blame the "misunderstandings" on the ex
tensive news media coverage she has received
since her brother was elected President.
"It was something I wasn't used to," she said.
"My meetings have been increased an awful lot
by those who came through curiosity."
"For 20 years they just came because they
needed help, because they were confused. All of
a sudden there were all these press people, writ
ing down everything I said. I had to stop and think
about what I was saying, whether it would be
misused."
"I made up my mind that I was just going to
make an asset out of any liability," she said. "It's
been a little transition period for me."
"Now that I feel this is no longer a problem, I'll
be having larger meetings in the United States
and fewer of them," she said. "This year I'm going
to be expanding my overseas ministry because
I've been getting just a deluge of invitations."
"Many of them are from heads of state," she
said. "I've been getting invitations from overseas
for years, but never before from the heads of
state, so I imagine that's because of my brother."
