# judge: must prove network willfully intended to incite rape
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Despite a
judge's order to prove NBC will
fully intended to incite rape, the
attorney for a 9-year-old girl ar
gued yesterday that the network
was negligent in televising a
movie he claims led to an assault
on his client.
Marvin Lewis, representing
Valeria Niemi and her daughter
Olivia in an $11 million suit
against the network and local af
filiate KRON-TV, began his
opening arguments in Superior
Court by attempting to establish
the powerful effect of television
on children. He said he plans to
prove that NBC was "hypocriti
cal" in airing the film "Born In
nocent" on Sept. 10, 1974.
The film, shown during what
now is called the "family hour,"
depicted the reformatory rape of
a young girl in which several
other girls assaulted her with the
handle of a plumber's plunger.
NBC "should have known that
someone, with high probability,
would go out and cause that

scene of violence and harm a
young innocent victim," Lewis
said.
He said that since the late
19605, NBC officials have tes
tified at numerous Congres
sional and Federal Communica
tions Commission hearings
where they admitted that televi
sion can heavily influence chil
dren and promised to shape
programming responsibly.
He said network censors
never reviewed the version of
the film shown just four days be
fore the assault on Niemi, now
13. She was attacked on a San
Francisco beach by three girls
wielding a bottle.
Earlier, Lewis said Judge
Robert Dossee's decision that
Lewis would have to prove the
network willfully sought to in
cite rape placed "an impossible
burden of proof" on his efforts
to prove that NBC was negligent
in showing the movie.
After clashing with the judge
several times, Lewis said he
would present his opening
statement to the San Francisco
Superior Court jury later Mon
day, before filing an appeal on
grounds the judge overstepped
his authority in setting narrow
legal grounds for the trial.
"It's ridiculous to argue that
NBC advocated the rape," said
Lewis. "I would have to be idio
tic to be an attorney presenting
that case."
Lewis said he never intended
to argue that "NBC ever inten
tionally abetted, coerced or in
cited people to go out and rape
girls with artificial instruments."
Last week Dossee said Lewis
would have to prove incitement,
and yesterday imposed the addi
tional "requirement of proving
intent."
The ruling marked a victory for
the network, according to NBC
attorney Floyd Abrams, who said
he planned to move that the
judge dismiss the case if Lewis
doesn't observe the rules.
Abrams has argued that the
telecast was protected by the
free speech provisions of the
First Amendment to the Con
stitution.
"I plan to prove that the show
created undue risk of harm and

that NBC put on the scene that
they knew or should have
known would result in harm to
my client and others," said
Lewis.
The girl's mother filed suit
against NBC and its local af
filiate, KRON-TV, seeking $1
million in compensatory dam
ages and $10 million in punitive
damages.
The suit initially was dismissed
by a California trial judge, but
the state Court of Appeal over
turned that decision. The case
was appealed to the U.S. Sup
reme Court, which refused to
bar a trial.
Lawyers for NBC and KRON
argued that broadcasters cannot
be held legally responsible for
the acts of others.
The California Medical As
sociation, siding with the girl's
lawyers, called television "a
school of violence and a college
for crime," which contributes to
the violence in society.
Lewis said that broadcasters
have a choice in showing
specific violent scenes and
"when they start to put on
scenes that are obscene and in
decent, then they should pay a
price for it."
