# Following the money: a day at the races
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
"Follow the money."
The 50-ish Asian American man tapped
his copy of Daily Racing Form on the arm
of his chairas he explained his method of
picking winners at horse races.
"It's just like Watergate: follow the
money. Forget looking at the board to
see how much is on who. Spot the guy
with the $300 suit and the diamond
stickpin in his tie and bet with him. He's
been here before, and he knows how to
keep ahold of his dough."
Another veteran bettor has a slightly
shadier method. "I know a guy who's a
bookie in his spare time. I never bet
through him, but I get tips in return for
buying him drinks at a bar. The tips are
usually good, but when he sends his
OWN money with me to put on a horse,

you could put your paycheck on it."
Other followers of what was called in
far more exclusive days "The Sport of
Kings" use more mundane strategies as
they indulge in one of the few legal
gambling activities in California: pari
mutual horse racing. Some bet only on
the "favorite" — the horse whose "win
pool" (the amount of money bet at that
moment on the chance that the horse
will win — and not come in second or
third — in the race) is largest at a
specified time before the race begins.
Still others use more complex systems,
utilizing the massive information on the
race contained in racing forms. For each
race, each horse's entire history, right
down to which position it held (and by
what margin) rounding the second turn
of a six-furlong race in August 1975, is

listed in a manner so cryptic that only the
experienced bettor knows for sure.
Horse racing is a curious mixture. It
isn't quite a sport — there are no teams,
none but the most prestigious horses are
"followed" by fans and few pay the $1.50
to $3.50 admission price to "watch the
horsies" — yet to equate it with playing
roulette at Harrah's Tahoe would ignore
the human (or, more properly, human
and animal) element of the race. Unlike a
game of chance, one horse REALLY IS
better than another, as anyone who has
put his or her money on a "dog" can
attest.
For those who truly love the track, for
those to whom the names of the horse
ranches and jockeys listed in the prog
ram mean something, the weekend
often represents time off.

"I never go when I can't see the horses
for all the cotton candy in the kids'
hands," says one bettor, a retired South
ern Pacific railroad worker who spends a
good deal of time — and a large portion
of a meager pension — at the track.
"I can't afford the grandstand and the
ramp is just too damned crowded on
Saturday," he says, referring to the area
in front of the grandstand and just be
hind the track's fence where most of the
"regulars" do their betting and watch
ing.
At the larger tracks, those which run
"meets" when there is no county or state
fair underway, the ramp is provided with
benches, but on the "fair circuit" you
find your seat on the cement between
the cigar butts and the chewing gum.
