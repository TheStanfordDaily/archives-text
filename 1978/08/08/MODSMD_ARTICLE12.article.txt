# Following the money: a day at the races
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
"Follow the money."
The 50-ish Asian American man tapped
his copy of Daily Racing Form on the arm
of his chairas he explained his method of
picking winners at horse races.
"It's just like Watergate: follow the
money. Forget looking at the board to
see how much is on who. Spot the guy
with the $300 suit and the diamond
stickpin in his tie and bet with him. He's
been here before, and he knows how to
keep ahold of his dough."
Another veteran bettor has a slightly
shadier method. "I know a guy who's a
bookie in his spare time. I never bet
through him, but I get tips in return for
buying him drinks at a bar. The tips are
usually good, but when he sends his
OWN money with me to put on a horse,

you could put your paycheck on it."
Other followers of what was called in
far more exclusive days "The Sport of
Kings" use more mundane strategies as
they indulge in one of the few legal
gambling activities in California: pari
mutual horse racing. Some bet only on
the "favorite" — the horse whose "win
pool" (the amount of money bet at that
moment on the chance that the horse
will win — and not come in second or
third — in the race) is largest at a
specified time before the race begins.
Still others use more complex systems,
utilizing the massive information on the
race contained in racing forms. For each
race, each horse's entire history, right
down to which position it held (and by
what margin) rounding the second turn
of a six-furlong race in August 1975, is

listed in a manner so cryptic that only the
experienced bettor knows for sure.
Horse racing is a curious mixture. It
isn't quite a sport — there are no teams,
none but the most prestigious horses are
"followed" by fans and few pay the $1.50
to $3.50 admission price to "watch the
horsies" — yet to equate it with playing
roulette at Harrah's Tahoe would ignore
the human (or, more properly, human
and animal) element of the race. Unlike a
game of chance, one horse REALLY IS
better than another, as anyone who has
put his or her money on a "dog" can
attest.
For those who truly love the track, for
those to whom the names of the horse
ranches and jockeys listed in the prog
ram mean something, the weekend
often represents time off.

"I never go when I can't see the horses
for all the cotton candy in the kids'
hands," says one bettor, a retired South
ern Pacific railroad worker who spends a
good deal of time — and a large portion
of a meager pension — at the track.
"I can't afford the grandstand and the
ramp is just too damned crowded on
Saturday," he says, referring to the area
in front of the grandstand and just be
hind the track's fence where most of the
"regulars" do their betting and watch
ing.
At the larger tracks, those which run
"meets" when there is no county or state
fair underway, the ramp is provided with
benches, but on the "fair circuit" you
find your seat on the cement between
the cigar butts and the chewing gum.

In the New Deal days, the average
ramp person on weekdays would have
been called "the common man." And,
most of those at Bay Meadows last Friday
probably remember Franklin Roosevelt.
"There are two kinds of people at the
track," says one bettor several years into
Medicare. "The retired guys who don't
have a thing to do during the day and the
welfare types who take the taxpayers'
money and give most of it back at the
track. Everybody else is working."
No one can say the crowd at the track
isn't fully integrated: last Friday at Bay
Meadows, whites made up just over half
the crowd on the ramp, with about 30
percent blanks and the rest chicano and
Asian Americans.
"Maybe there's no race problem be
cause there's no camaradarie to start
with," says a student who spent several
summers following the horses. "At the

track, nobody cares about anything but
winning — there's no team to root for,
and the horses don't care who bets on
who, so nobody gets mad about the
other people."
Regardless of his or her system, the
experienced racegoer starts the race
where the horses do, in the paddock. As
the equestrian contenders are led inside
the dirt circle to be saddled and tested
for illegal stimulants and pain-killers in
their blood, all eyes are peeled for signs
of fatigue, distemper and anything else
that could be a clue to performance.
Some of those eyes are — or claim to be
— sharper than others.
After the paddock, the systems take
over. Some wait until just before "post
time" — the deadline for betting, to go to
the sellers' windows. Their racing judg
ment depends in part on the odds the
horse has — a bet on a horse everyone
else things will win won't pay much, even

if it wins.
"Everyone has his own pace," says a
"favorite" bettor. "For me, the betting is
early — I put my money on the best one
and don't care what the other guy
thinks."
Eventually, all bets are in and the
horses are "at the post," inside the start
ing gates with jockeys astride. Attention
is directed to the announcer and to a
small board which periodically reports
the first three horses.
The start, the first turn, the back
stretch, the clubhouse turn — and the
final dash to the finish. As the race moves
forward, so does the ramp crowd.
"By the time this is over on a big race,
they're lining the fence," says a horse
lover on her way out from the stands.
"Somehow they think it'll help their
horse."
There are, naturally, mixed emotions
at the end of the race. But when a heavy

favorite comes in worse than third, the
reaction is less than pleasant. Even the
long-shot bettors feel slightly cheated.
"That's how you can tell a good race
from a bad one," says a veteran. "Good
horses run consistently, and a favorite
should at least 'show' (run third). But
when it's a pig race, it's anybody's
guess."
Do they make money? Some do, but
most consider a breakeven day a plus.
"It's fun to try your luck, and if you don't
lose much, you've had a good time," says
a retired man. "If we went to the movies
for fun, we'd have no chance of getting
the money back. Here you can make a
profit."
Another bettor, who says he's watched
horse races in California since the 19205,
agrees: "I've been going to the track so
long, it's in my blood. You can get in
volved here like nowhere else. You really
put your money where your mouth is."
"Follow the money."

track," says one bettor several years into
Medicare. "The retired guys who don't
have a thing to do during the day and the
welfare types who take the taxpayers'
money and give most of it back at the
track. Everybody else is working."
No one can say the crowd at the track
isn't fully integrated: last Friday at Bay
Meadows, whites made up just over half
the crowd on the ramp, with about 30
percent blanks and the rest chicano and
Asian Americans.
"Maybe there's no race problem be
cause there's no camaradarie to start
with," says a student who spent several
summers following the horses. "At the

track, nobody cares about anything but
winning — there's no team to root for,
and the horses don't care who bets on
who, so nobody gets mad about the
other people."
Regardless of his or her system, the
experienced racegoer starts the race
where the horses do, in the paddock. As
the equestrian contenders are led inside
the dirt circle to be saddled and tested
for illegal stimulants and pain-killers in
their blood, all eyes are peeled for signs
of fatigue, distemper and anything else
that could be a clue to performance.
Some of those eyes are — or claim to be
— sharper than others.
After the paddock, the systems take
over. Some wait until just before "post
time" — the deadline for betting, to go to
the sellers' windows. Their racing judg
ment depends in part on the odds the
horse has — a bet on a horse everyone
else things will win won't pay much, even

if it wins.
"Everyone has his own pace," says a
"favorite" bettor. "For me, the betting is
early — I put my money on the best one
and don't care what the other guy
thinks."
Eventually, all bets are in and the
horses are "at the post," inside the start
ing gates with jockeys astride. Attention
is directed to the announcer and to a
small board which periodically reports
the first three horses.
The start, the first turn, the back
stretch, the clubhouse turn — and the
final dash to the finish. As the race moves
forward, so does the ramp crowd.
"By the time this is over on a big race,
they're lining the fence," says a horse
lover on her way out from the stands.
"Somehow they think it'll help their
horse."
There are, naturally, mixed emotions
at the end of the race. But when a heavy

favorite comes in worse than third, the
reaction is less than pleasant. Even the
long-shot bettors feel slightly cheated.
"That's how you can tell a good race
from a bad one," says a veteran. "Good
horses run consistently, and a favorite
should at least 'show' (run third). But
when it's a pig race, it's anybody's
guess."
Do they make money? Some do, but
most consider a breakeven day a plus.
"It's fun to try your luck, and if you don't
lose much, you've had a good time," says
a retired man. "If we went to the movies
for fun, we'd have no chance of getting
the money back. Here you can make a
profit."
Another bettor, who says he's watched
horse races in California since the 19205,
agrees: "I've been going to the track so
long, it's in my blood. You can get in
volved here like nowhere else. You really
put your money where your mouth is."
"Follow the money."
The 50-ish Asian American man tapped
his copy of Daily Racing Form on the arm
of his chairas he explained his method of
picking winners at horse races.
"It's just like Watergate: follow the
money. Forget looking at the board to
see how much is on who. Spot the guy
with the $300 suit and the diamond
stickpin in his tie and bet with him. He's
been here before, and he knows how to
keep ahold of his dough."
Another veteran bettor has a slightly
shadier method. "I know a guy who's a
bookie in his spare time. I never bet
through him, but I get tips in return for
buying him drinks at a bar. The tips are
usually good, but when he sends his
OWN money with me to put on a horse,

you could put your paycheck on it."
Other followers of what was called in
far more exclusive days "The Sport of
Kings" use more mundane strategies as
they indulge in one of the few legal
gambling activities in California: pari
mutual horse racing. Some bet only on
the "favorite" — the horse whose "win
pool" (the amount of money bet at that
moment on the chance that the horse
will win — and not come in second or
third — in the race) is largest at a
specified time before the race begins.
Still others use more complex systems,
utilizing the massive information on the
race contained in racing forms. For each
race, each horse's entire history, right
down to which position it held (and by
what margin) rounding the second turn
of a six-furlong race in August 1975, is

listed in a manner so cryptic that only the
experienced bettor knows for sure.
Horse racing is a curious mixture. It
isn't quite a sport — there are no teams,
none but the most prestigious horses are
"followed" by fans and few pay the $1.50
to $3.50 admission price to "watch the
horsies" — yet to equate it with playing
roulette at Harrah's Tahoe would ignore
the human (or, more properly, human
and animal) element of the race. Unlike a
game of chance, one horse REALLY IS
better than another, as anyone who has
put his or her money on a "dog" can
attest.
For those who truly love the track, for
those to whom the names of the horse
ranches and jockeys listed in the prog
ram mean something, the weekend
often represents time off.

"I never go when I can't see the horses
for all the cotton candy in the kids'
hands," says one bettor, a retired South
ern Pacific railroad worker who spends a
good deal of time — and a large portion
of a meager pension — at the track.
"I can't afford the grandstand and the
ramp is just too damned crowded on
Saturday," he says, referring to the area
in front of the grandstand and just be
hind the track's fence where most of the
"regulars" do their betting and watch
ing.
At the larger tracks, those which run
"meets" when there is no county or state
fair underway, the ramp is provided with
benches, but on the "fair circuit" you
find your seat on the cement between
the cigar butts and the chewing gum.

In the New Deal days, the average
ramp person on weekdays would have
been called "the common man." And,
most of those at Bay Meadows last Friday
probably remember Franklin Roosevelt.
