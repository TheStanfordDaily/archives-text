## Theater/karen caesar CAT brings 'Sam' to life 
### 
Sometimes we forget that
Woody Allen hasn't only done
movies, movies, movies. Al
though through them he has be
come inordinately famous and
disgustingly rich, his career did
not always revolve around the
cinema. Woody Allen wrote for
television (yes, television) and
he still writes short stories (usu
ally tor The New Yorker) and he
has written books and even
plays. Indeed, after seeing the
California Actors Theater (CAT)
production of Allen's "Play It
Again, Sam" in their theater in
Old Town (Los Gatos), my sus
picion has been confirmed:
"Play It Again, Sam," the play,
has infinitely more appeal than
"Play It Again, Sam," the movie.
Allen wrote the play first, of
course, and starred in it on
Broadway. Like most other Allen
vehicles, it follows a neurotic
schlemiei who has problems de
aling with women and fending
off loneliness.
Insufficient laughter
Allan Felix is the schlemiei in
"Play It Again, Sam," an intros
pective film reviewer whose
wife, Nancy, wants to leave him
because he's no fun ("insuffi
cent laughter," as Allan de
scribes her grounds fordivorce).
His best friend Dick, the quin
tessential businessman who
calls his exchange every five mi
nutes to leave the phone num
bers where he will be for the
next five minutes, and Dick's
wife, Linda, a pill-popping

neurotic like Allan, then cometo
take his mind off Nancy and in
troduce him to some new wo
men.
Allan of course flops dismally
with each of the ladies, giving
him reason to appeal to the au
dience with plaintive
monologues on his ineptitude in
the area of "relationships."
"What's the matter with me?
Why can't I be cool? What's the
secret?" he moans.
Enter Humphrey Bogart. Into
Allan's apartment Bogey ambles
to give soothing counsel and
comfort to the desperate
schlemiei. After all, one of the
things this play is, is a paen to
Bogart, the paragon of couth
and class when it comes to hand
ling women.
They fall in love
After spending a lot of time
together walking and talking,
Allan and Linda fall in love, and
all is well. Allan realizes that he
doesn't have to be Bogart or
anyone else when trying to woo,
and Linda decides that she has to
stay with her husband because
he needs her and because she
really does love him. Their one
night affair gives them both the
strength and the self-confidence
to go on and make their own "re
lationships" work.
Along with the humor in
"Sam," there is an unsubtle
comment on our appearance
oriented materialistic society as
well as a subtle undertone of
sweet sentimentality and ten

derness. Allan OD's on Binaca
and Canoe and Lavoris to try to
impress his female visitors. But
he also scratches his records,
kicks over the coffee table,
mumbles and perspires, and so
they are not impressed. Yet he
can't be rude or cruel or macho
or uncaring. He can't success
fully hide the fact that he is a
klutz, so instead he comes to
terms with it. And once he
comes to terms with it, he is a
transformed man, relaxed and
charming and no longer embar
rassingly uncoordinated.
Intimate
This is an intimate play. Allan
is onstage confiding to us for the
entire performance. The set
never changes; it is the living
room of a New York apartment,
casual and comfortable, almost
like a dorm room (but consider
ably larger). Yet this living room
becomes a disco, an art
museum, Central Park — with
out lights ever dimming or addi
tional props appearing. This is
the charm of the play — it never
leaves Allan's living room. There
are no distracting beach scenes
or prolonged strolls down
streets and through parks; there
is just Allan and Linda, or Allan
and Dick or Allan and whoever.
We see him in all these places,
but the physical realities are left
for our imaginations to conjure
up.
Martin Ferrero is an excellent
Allan, a master of the affecta
tions of the true neurotic. He

whines, he complains, he even
looks like Woody Allen. As
Bogey, Kurtwood Smith has a
compelling lisp, but looks no
thing like the rugged film star.
As Linda, Leslie Harrell is
about as far away from Diane
Keaton as you can get. Although
she is believeable as a spacey
neurotic, she is girlish and inno
cent; Keaton, in the movie, is
somewhat more trendy and
sophisticated. Stephen Troy, as
Harrell's obnoxious money
minded husband, has a boom
ing voice best suited for an out

door amphitheater, but is still ef
fective and obnoxious and
thoroughly destestable like he is
supposed to be.
CAT did a remarkable job of
staging"Sam." Itis performed t in
a lovely (and relatively small)
theater by a lively and compe
tent cast. CAT is serious compet
ition for ACT.
"Sam" runs through Monday,
August 13. See it if you can;
you'll enjoy the intimacy of the
theater and of the play. ACT isn't
the only "real" theater company
in the Bay Area, you know.

comes to terms with it, he is a
transformed man, relaxed and
charming and no longer embar
rassingly uncoordinated.
Intimate
This is an intimate play. Allan
is onstage confiding to us for the
entire performance. The set
never changes; it is the living
room of a New York apartment,
casual and comfortable, almost
like a dorm room (but consider
ably larger). Yet this living room
becomes a disco, an art
museum, Central Park — with
out lights ever dimming or addi
tional props appearing. This is
the charm of the play — it never
leaves Allan's living room. There
are no distracting beach scenes
or prolonged strolls down
streets and through parks; there
is just Allan and Linda, or Allan
and Dick or Allan and whoever.
We see him in all these places,
but the physical realities are left
for our imaginations to conjure
up.
Martin Ferrero is an excellent
Allan, a master of the affecta
tions of the true neurotic. He

whines, he complains, he even
looks like Woody Allen. As
Bogey, Kurtwood Smith has a
compelling lisp, but looks no
thing like the rugged film star.
As Linda, Leslie Harrell is
about as far away from Diane
Keaton as you can get. Although
she is believeable as a spacey
neurotic, she is girlish and inno
cent; Keaton, in the movie, is
somewhat more trendy and
sophisticated. Stephen Troy, as
Harrell's obnoxious money
minded husband, has a boom
ing voice best suited for an out

door amphitheater, but is still ef
fective and obnoxious and
thoroughly destestable like he is
supposed to be.
CAT did a remarkable job of
staging"Sam." Itis performed t in
a lovely (and relatively small)
theater by a lively and compe
tent cast. CAT is serious compet
ition for ACT.
"Sam" runs through Monday,
August 13. See it if you can;
you'll enjoy the intimacy of the
theater and of the play. ACT isn't
the only "real" theater company
in the Bay Area, you know.

Woody Allen look-alike Martin Ferrero and his two leading ladies, |an
Steiger as ex-wife Nancy and Leslie Harrell as good friend Linda in "Play
It Again, Sam" at CAT.
Sometimes we forget that
Woody Allen hasn't only done
movies, movies, movies. Al
though through them he has be
come inordinately famous and
disgustingly rich, his career did
not always revolve around the
cinema. Woody Allen wrote for
television (yes, television) and
he still writes short stories (usu
ally tor The New Yorker) and he
has written books and even
plays. Indeed, after seeing the
California Actors Theater (CAT)
production of Allen's "Play It
Again, Sam" in their theater in
Old Town (Los Gatos), my sus
picion has been confirmed:
"Play It Again, Sam," the play,
has infinitely more appeal than
"Play It Again, Sam," the movie.
Allen wrote the play first, of
course, and starred in it on
Broadway. Like most other Allen
vehicles, it follows a neurotic
schlemiei who has problems de
aling with women and fending
off loneliness.
Insufficient laughter
Allan Felix is the schlemiei in
"Play It Again, Sam," an intros
pective film reviewer whose
wife, Nancy, wants to leave him
because he's no fun ("insuffi
cent laughter," as Allan de
scribes her grounds fordivorce).
His best friend Dick, the quin
tessential businessman who
calls his exchange every five mi
nutes to leave the phone num
bers where he will be for the
next five minutes, and Dick's
wife, Linda, a pill-popping

neurotic like Allan, then cometo
take his mind off Nancy and in
troduce him to some new wo
men.
Allan of course flops dismally
with each of the ladies, giving
him reason to appeal to the au
dience with plaintive
monologues on his ineptitude in
the area of "relationships."
"What's the matter with me?
Why can't I be cool? What's the
secret?" he moans.
Enter Humphrey Bogart. Into
Allan's apartment Bogey ambles
to give soothing counsel and
comfort to the desperate
schlemiei. After all, one of the
things this play is, is a paen to
Bogart, the paragon of couth
and class when it comes to hand
ling women.
They fall in love
After spending a lot of time
together walking and talking,
Allan and Linda fall in love, and
all is well. Allan realizes that he
doesn't have to be Bogart or
anyone else when trying to woo,
and Linda decides that she has to
stay with her husband because
he needs her and because she
really does love him. Their one
night affair gives them both the
strength and the self-confidence
to go on and make their own "re
lationships" work.
Along with the humor in
"Sam," there is an unsubtle
comment on our appearance
oriented materialistic society as
well as a subtle undertone of
sweet sentimentality and ten

derness. Allan OD's on Binaca
and Canoe and Lavoris to try to
impress his female visitors. But
he also scratches his records,
kicks over the coffee table,
mumbles and perspires, and so
they are not impressed. Yet he
can't be rude or cruel or macho
or uncaring. He can't success
fully hide the fact that he is a
klutz, so instead he comes to
terms with it. And once he
comes to terms with it, he is a
transformed man, relaxed and
charming and no longer embar
rassingly uncoordinated.
