## 'Leonce and Lena'-good show with a few bugs 
### 
After only a month in preparation, the
Drama Department's summer produc
tion "Leonce and Lena," a fairy tale
comedy by Georg Buchner, is being pre
sented in the Old Union Nitery this
Wednesday through Saturday, Aug.
9-12.
The play concerns a bored prince
whose impending marriage to a princess
he has never seen prompts him to head
for Italy in search of a woman of infinite
beauty and infinite ignorance, with the
court jester as his companion. Of course
he meets a lovely maiden in the wood,
who of course turns out to be the prin

cess he has been fated to marry and they
fall in ignorant love, of course, and live
happily ever after.
In his Stanford acting debut, John Rut
tenberg, who only recently defected to
drama from the hard sciences, shows a
lot of promise as Leonce. However, he
does not seem comfortable in many of
his speeches or in his dimple-kneed
tights. He is often coat-hanger stiff in his
movements, though at times he flexes
his talents and relaxes into his part very
nicely.
Lena (Donna Marie) moves about the
stage with a romantic elegance which

charmingly betrays that her first calling is
dance. As a lead, she has relatively few
lines compared to Leonce, but her fluid
motion and classic profile make her a
very strong and pleasant presence.
John Martinelli plays Volario, the wise
fool whose jaded fatalism comes from
life itself rather than the youthful bore
dom from which Leonce's comes.
Martinelli portrays the hard-knocks ex
perience of his character very well, giv
ing him the required age to become the
necessary foil of Ruttenberg's Leonce.
"Leonce and Lena" is directed by Ron
Davies, a third year doctoral candidate.

Davies was able to complete the produc
tion in a very short time with reasonable
success. The staging is superb. The
players are always in places and posi
tions which enchance the aesthetique of
the production. Much work still needs to
be done on the speeches of the actors.
Too much stress is put on the sighing
melancholic delivery which results in a
lot of plaintive, dull rhapsodizing.
Many of the shortcomings may have
righted themselves, and the play will
most likely improve as the actors be
come more used to an audience.
