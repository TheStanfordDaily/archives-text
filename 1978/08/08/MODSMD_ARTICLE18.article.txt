Assembly kills Nazi bill
Sacramento — Despite emotional pleas
from Jewish war veterans, an Assembly
committee killed a bill yesterday that
would have restricted public wearing of
swastika-adorned Nazi uniforms.
Heeding warnings that the bill would
violate the First Amendment, the Crimi
nal Justice Committee refused to ap
prove SB 1781 by Sen. Aian Robbins
(D-Van Nuys).
"I strongly feel that we either believe
in free speech or not ... I strongly be
lieve that the First Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution should be observed or
we're lost," said Assemblyman John
Knox (D-Richmond).
A motion to approve the Senate
passed bill was made by Assemblyman
Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), who said
some of his relatives were killed in Nazi
Europe. The motion died when no one
seconded it.
Nuclear foes arrested
San Luis Obispo — About 500 oppo
nents of nuclear power were in custody
yesterday after two days of nonviolent
demonstrations at the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant.
The demonstrators, most charged with
trespassing on the Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. site, were being held at the Califor
nia Men's Colony near San Luis Obispo,
about 10 miles west of the reactor. The
misdemeanor charge carries a maximum
penalty of six months in jail and a $500
fine.
Future protest plans were uncertain,
but fewer than 50 people remained at the
plant entrance and on nearby beaches at
midday yesterday.
PC&E had earlier obtained a temporary
court order forbidding demonstrators
from interrupting work at Diablo Ca
nyon, a two-unit nuclear plant that is
nearing completion.
The Abalone Alliance, which spon
sored the protest, said demonstrators
chose to ignore the Superior Court order
and invite arrest to dramatize their fear of
nuclear energy.
Brown proposes tax cuts
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown prop
osed an election year tax cut yesterday

along with his previously announced
plan for spending limits on state and
local government.
The Democratic governor said he will
propose cuts in either the state income
or sales tax or both as part of his tax
limitation proposal.
Brown did not give specifics of the tax
cut plan in an Associated Press interview,
but legislative sources said the proposal
under discussion would reduce the six
cent state sales tax by one penny per
dollar and adjust state income tax brac
kets with inflation.
A penny cut in the sales tax would save
taxpayers $1 billion annually. Savings
from the income tax cut, known as "in
dexing," would depend on the rate of
inflation.
Brown said his tax limitation proposal
would put a lid on both state and local
government spending, but that it would
give the Legislature authority in
emergencies to override the lid by a
two-thirds vote.
Mid-East negotiations
Alexandria, Egypt — Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance launched a last-ditch effort
yesterday to keep flickering Mideast
peace hopes alive by trying to persuade
President Anwar Sadat to reopen face
to-face negotiations with Israel.
"We are steadfast in our search for a
just, lasting and comprehensive peace
and we will devote all our efforts to reach
that end," Vance said.
It was not known how long Vance
would remain in Egypt. U.S. officials said
it depended on his meeting with Sadat.
Vance could fly home today or see Sadat
again and return to Washington tomor
row.
Vance made no statement after his
meeting with Kamel, but State Depart
ment spokesman Hodding Carter de
scribed the talks as a "general review of
the basic question of how to get the
peace process moving."
"We had good and useful talks," said
Kamel. "We've always used frankness as
the basis of our discussions. Both the
United States and Egypt are committed to
peace."
FTC looks at life insurance
Washington — Consumers often pay
more than they have to for life insurance

because of a lack of price competition
among insurors, according to a Federal
Trade Commission investigation.
"Cost variations of over 100 percent for
essentially identical coverage are not un
common," Albert Kramer, director of the
FTC's bureau of consumer protection,
said yesterday.
In figuring the cost of a whole life pol
icy, too many consumers consider only
the annual premium cost, and do not
take into account how much money will
be earned on the policy through invest
ments by the insurance company, he
said.
The FTC staff is preparing a report on
life insurance pricing for the five
member commission to act on around
the end of the year. The staff feels the
FTC should cooperate with state insur
ance regulators in requiring price disclo
sure, rather than enact a federal regula
tion, Kramer said.
The prime need is for consumers to be
told the rate of return on the savings part
of their whole life insurance policies,
Kramer testified.
Tax protestor sentenced
Springfield, 111. — Robert Awerkamp
has been sentenced to a year in prison
for taking the Fifth Amendment on his
federal income tax returns. He says
answering questions about them would
prove he had broken the law.
"I have engaged in activities that were
illegal but not immoral," Awerkamp, 38,
said in an interview. "That's what I'm try
ing to prevent telling about."
Awerkamp's tax returns are splashed
with references to the amendment,
which provides a constitutional guaran
tee against self-incrimination.
The tax form asks him to name his de
pendent children. Awerkamp replies:
"Unable to answer and protect the rights
guaranteed to me by the sth Amend
ment. . . ."
Cross income? "sth," he writes.
Balance due the IRS? "sth."
Taxes overpaid? "sth."
In addition to the year in prison, Awer
kamp was sentenced last week to five
years' probation for failing to file proper
income tax returns for 1971 through 1974.
U.S. District Judge Waldo Ackerman,
who sentenced Awerkamp, said "gov
ernment depends on voluntary contribu

tion of taxes . . . Something has to hap
pen as a deterrent to other people."
Awerkamp, meanwhile, says he is tak
ing his case to the federal appeals court
at Chicago.
Hearings begin on tires
Washington — A 7-year-old girl who
lost her right leg, her motherand an aunt
in an auto accident clutched at a doll
yesterday as attorneys for her family con
tended that the wreck was caused by a
defective Firestone 500 steel-belted ra
dial tire.
The attorneys for Selana Lee Clement
of Churchland, N.C., were the lead-off
witnesses as the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration opened hearings
on whether Firestone should recall about
13 million of the tires.
Clement's attorneys claimed the acci
dent was caused when the right rear tire
failed and the tread peeled away, wrap
ping around the axle housing.
On July 7 the safety agency said the 500
has safety defects and should be recalled
by the company. That recommendation
was made after federal engineers said
they analyzed more than 6000 reports
from consumers alleging "more than
14,000 individual tire failures, 29 deaths,
more than 50 injuries and hundreds of
property-damage accidents."
Firestone said it does not believe a re
call is justified and claims that the prob
lems reported by consumers are due
largely to improper inflation of the tire,
which has been phased out of produc
tion gradually over the last two years.
Firestone is scheduled to make its pre
sentation today.
A recall would cost Firestone hundreds
of millions of dollars because, under
fed°ral regulations, every tire sold within
the Lst three years would have to be
replaceH by the company free of charge.
Those so'd more than three years ago
would be replaced with the owner pay
ing a pro rata replacement fee.
