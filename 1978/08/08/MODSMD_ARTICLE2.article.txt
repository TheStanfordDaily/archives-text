# Libel suit filed against Elsen

### Joel Dickholtz 
A $3.75 million libel suit has
been filed in San Jose against Al
bert Elsen, art history professor
and one of the world's leading
experts on French sculptor Au
guste Rodin, by George Schattle
of Menlo Park.
The suit, which was filed in
Santa Clara County superior
court, centers around four
sculptures owned by Schattle
which he says are works of Ro
din. Schattle claims that Elsen's
public comments about the
sculptures libeled him and pre
vented him from selling the
pieces.
Elsen had been called to au
thenticate the pieces, but he de
termined that they were defi
nitely not works of Rodin.
Elsen allegedly went on to
write a letter to KGO-TV news
man Jerry Jensen, in which he
claimed that Schattel and a San
lose man had been attempting
to sell the false works to
businessmen passing through
the area for $1 million.
In the letter, which is attached
to the suit as "Exhibit A," Elsen
wrote that the two men were
"trying to con unsuspecting
businessmen into buying four
reputedly unique Rodin
sculptures'' which were actually
"outright fakes."
He also said that even if they
were authentic they would be
worth no more than about

$75,000.
According to the lawsuit, the
remarks in Elsen's letter were
"untrue, libelous and defamat
ory."
Schattle said that whether or
not the sculptures were actually
done by Rodin was not the basis
of the lawsuit.
"The authenticity of the
sculptures is not the question,"
he said. "They could be made of
peanut butter, for that matter,
but that's not the point. Check
with Charlie Hawkins, my
lawyer."
Stanford Alumnus Hawkins
said "Elsen claims — for some
very ambiguous reason — that
the pieces are not authentic.
He's entitled to his opinion, but
he's not entitled to slander my
client . . . Besides this, I under
stand he only viewed two of the
statues."
Elsen was contacted by the
Daily, but declined to comment
on the letter or any aspect of the
lawsuit. He also refused to re
spond to Hawkins claim that he
had only viewed two of the four
sculptures.
"I haven't even seen the
charges against me yet . . . and
until I do all I know about this
case is what I read in the pap
ers."
Elsen did, however, stand fast
on his original appraisal of the
sculptures, saying that in his
