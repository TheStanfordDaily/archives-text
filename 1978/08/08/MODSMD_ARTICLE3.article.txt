# Pope's body lies in state

Vatican City (AP) — Clad in
red, lying on a green velvet bier,
the body of Pope Paul VI, "in
deep and serene sleep," was
viewed by thousands of mourn
ing faithful at the papal summer
palace yesterday.
At the Vatican, a senior prince
of the church, 85-year-old Car
dinal Carlo Confalonieri,
wielded a hammer and chisel
and smashed Paul's Ring of the
Fisherman, marking the end of
his reign.
The cardinals, flying in from
around the world, must go into
secret conclave within 14 days to
choose a new pope, 263 rd pon
tiff of the Roman Catholic
Church and successor to the
Fisherman, St. Peter.
One possible candidate, 73-
year-old Austrian Cardinal Franz
Koenig, quickly expressed his

reluctance, telling a Vienna
radio interviewer he does not
"deem myself suitable," and
suggesting that a younger man is
needed and that a black or Asian
pope is a "possibility."
Three Italian cardinals, an
Argentine and a Dutchman are
among the others prominently
mentioned as potential succes
sors to Paul, who died Sunday
night, 51 days before his 81st
birthday, after a heart attack at
the summer palace in Castel
Gandolfo.
The body of the man who led
the world's 550 million Roman
Catholics for 15 years lay in state
yesterday in the Swiss Room of
the palace in the Alban Hills just
south of Rome.
The body was clad in red
robes, white miter and red
shoes. A rosary was entwined in
the fingers of his crossed hands.
Four Swiss Guards, in their
Michelangelo-designed
yellow-and-blue striped un
iforms, stood locked at attention
around the body. A nine-foot
white candle was on the right
and a silver cross on the left.
By late afternoon more than
10,000 persons had filed across
the marble floors and past the
tapestried walls of the 90-by-30-
foot salon to view the body.
Thousands of others stood in
line outside, six abreast, many
singing hymns, braving occa
sional thundershowers and
strong gusts of wind.
