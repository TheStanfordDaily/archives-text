# Compulsory service denies basic rights
## 
### 
David Miller

It is tempting to read David
Sartoris' call for compulsory na
tional service (Daily, Aug. 4) as a
piece of (perhaps unintentional)
satire.
Sartoris is simplyfollowingthe
conventional wisdom in ignor
ing the obvious contradiction
between the military draft or
compulsory civilian service and
the 13th Amendment prohibi
tion of involuntary servitude.
But he ascends to the heights of
absurdity when he suggests that
government-enforced involun
tary servitude might produce
"greater respect for our democ
ratic system and the personal
freedoms it affords."
The most basic human right is
the right to use one's labor in
pursuit of one's own ends; the
defining characteristic of a slave
is that he is forced to labor to
serve another's ends. To take
from a young American a year or
two years of his life will teach
him only that he lives under a
government which has no sin
cere concern for human rights.
The only government worthy
of respect is that which obtains
its support not through coercion
but through convincing its citi
zens that it is worthy of their vol
untary and freely-given support.
The only just powers possessed
by government are those de
rived from the free consent of
the governed.
The central political problem
of our time is whether govern
ment can be forced to submit to
the same standards of morality
obeyed by nearly everyone else.

The resistance to the military
draft and the Vietnam War, the
current popular revolt against
taxation, the slowly growing op
position to the legislation of
morality and lifestyles and to
laws against victimless crimes —
all suggest that the American
public has begun to grasp the
moral imperative of restraining
the power of government.
That Sartoris is oblivious to this
imperative and supports a posi
tion worthy of a Richard Nixon
or a Hubert Humphrey or a Lyn
don Johnson is unfortunate.
If Sartoris' suggestion for
compulsory national service is
ever enacted as law, it should be
resisted by all Americans (and
especially those young adults di
rectly affected) by every means
possible — through the electoral
process, through peaceful civil
disobedience, and, if necessary,
through violent resistance.
