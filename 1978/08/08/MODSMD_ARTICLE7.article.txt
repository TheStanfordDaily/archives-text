# Cheerleaders bring life to Farm

For the past several nights in a
row, my scholarly musings have
been interrupted by sounds
most uncharacteristic of Stan
ford, and most alien to my cul
tured, finely-attuned, elite
intellectual ears and sen
sibilities. On these occasions, I
have looked up from the careful
perusal of ancient tomes and

classical texts, such as Issac
Asimov's Science Fiction
Magazine, Conan comics and
the July Penthouse, to hear the
approaching sounds of . . .
what?
Wailings, screams, caterwaul
ing, all the acoustic underpin
nings of a Bacchic revel. Have
the Russians finally landed? Is
the local vigilante group warning
of the impending doom? Are the
nighttime rites of the local Druid
cultists in progress, or even
worse, has Hare Krishna decided
to try the direct approach in its
recruitment efforts? Is it a Close
Encounter of the Third Kind?
Ah, but here they come! It is
none of those, it is actually just
the sound of that pinnacle of
American popular culture, the
. . . cheerleaders? Three or four
hundred CHEERLEADERS?
All I know about this group is
that they bill themselves as the
Cada Spirit Camp, and are head
quartered in the Stern and Wil
bur Housing complexes. They
seem to come in smaller units,
these high-school-age girls, of
perhaps half a dozen to a dozen.
Each unit attires itself in shorts
and tank tops of a uniform color
combination, no, a kandy-kolor
kombination, like the paint jobs
on those hot rods and custom
made cars of the '60s, the very
same cars that first became
popular in California. What is it

about Californians and bright
flashy colors?
But so much bare flesh visible!
Is this California, conservative,
prudish, S.I. Hayakawa-Howard
Jarvis-Evelle Younger CALIFOR
NIA?
And the noise! Banshees
howling down some drafty Cel
tic castle are no match for their
sheer volume, the sheer inten
sity of noise. A stadium full of
screaming Beatles (or Rolling
Stones or John Denver) teeny
boppers, which no doubt this
group overlaps with, cannot
match their enthusiasm.
Are there among this number,
future Dallas cowgirls, future
Charlie's Angels?
As I watch the streaming pro
cession of every color combina
tion known stream past like a
rainbow that has lost its integ
rity, like a steam of sugar
coated, multi-colored syrup, es
caping from a confectionary exp
losion, someone in my resi
dence turns on some disco
music — LOUD!
The noise, the flow is barely
abated. Some of the buds cease
their Druid-like but animated
chanting and start dancing,
twisting, writhing and undulat
ing to the music as they stream a
long. A few wave at the residents
watching them from windows.
(Not at me, though.) Some turn
cartwheels, some jump up and
down. But the stream continues.
Now my scholarly brain, long
deluged by and submerged
under this constant acoustic
wave disturbance begins,
slowly, to crank once again. And
that white elephant of a mind,

beseiged by this assault on its
intellectual orderliness and
acuity thinks thus: "What is it all
for? What right do these cheer
leaders and their cheerleader's
leaders have to invade peaceful,
sleepy, scholarly Stanford-in-
Summer with their outburst of
youthful exuberance, their chil
dish glee? How dare they disturb
the scholarly sleep of centuries
(metaphorical, not literal) and
my own sleep (quite literal, not
metaphorical; have YOU ever
read through an entire Conan
comic without falling asleep at
least once?)?
"Is this what American culture
and all the high hopes and
dreams of the Jeffersonians have
come to?"
Is it a symbol of false values,
empty, meaningless lives,
status-seeking and one
upmanship, middle to upper
class affluence and the narcis
sist's generation?
Bah! Mephisto banishes
Sartre and scholarly pretension
ceases. We need our fun as well
as our Angst. Let existentialism
be silent for now, and let the
voices of the young be raised in
praise of youth and life.
I'm "not prudish, nor do I seri
ously object to the noise. On the
contrary, it's what Stanford
needs. The scholars and the in
tellects should wake up, for a
brief while at least, and be re
minded that somewhere — Out
There — people are living life,
imperfectly perhaps, selfishly
perhaps, but living life, while we
are merely studying it.
