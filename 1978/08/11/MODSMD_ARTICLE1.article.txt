## Lyman reviews African journey 
### John Nielsen Jim Tranquada 
Back from a 12 day trip to
South Africa, President Richard
Lyman said yesterday that "my
opinion has not greatly changed
about what we can and should
do" regarding the role of the Un
ited States in that country.
Speaking informally before a
Stanford Alumni college sym
posium, Lyman said that al
though none of his previous
opinions had been radically al
tered, the trip had strengthened
his view that "American corpo
rations could and ought to make
noise about the migratory labor
policy so basic to their means of
operation."
Lyman returned from South
Africa on Wednesday, where he
attended a multiracial, multina
tional conference on the future
of that country, co-sponsored by
the World Peace Foundation of
Boston and the South African In
stitute of International Affairs.
Among those attending were
corporate executives from IBM
and Ford, New Jersey Con
gressman Andy McCuire,
NAACP legal defense chairman
Jack Creenburg, three members
of the South African parliament,
and Percy Quiboza, the promi
nent black South African news
paper editor.
Those at the conference "dis
cussed a lot of options, and
came to agreement on none,"
Lyman said. Personally, he
"doesn't see a way out that
shows a great deal of promise."
Lyman, questioned by mem
bers of the audience, said that it
is difficult to "get black South
Africans to readily declare them
selves strongly" on the issue of
U.S. investments in that coun
try, largely due to an umbrella

law on subversive criticism of
the state and its pol cies.
Lyman said that he did push to
discuss the issue, however.
Some "fairly militant blacks"
said in private conversation that
they understood why the U.S.
corporations couldn't withdraw,
but declared that they shouldn't
expand, and should continue to
use their leverage with the gov
ernment, he said.
Many, he said, didn't under
stand what a University presi
dent has todowith investments.
While stressing that "I am no
kind of expert on South Africa
and its manifold and possibly
disastrous problems," Lyman
spoke out most strongly against
South African migratory labor
policy, according to which black
males are transported from their
tribal homelands to urban work
camps.
"Urban blacks are the rock on
which the government keeps
stumbling," he said. "They have
become so integrated into the
South African economy they
cannot be extruded, while to
give them full political tights
means turning over the country
to a black majority."
While "superficially" there
appeared to be "a large number
of people living a free life,"
Lynan said, "If there is a South
African that feels entirely free, I
didn't meet one." Lyman said
that he travelled widely after the
conference was over, and that
he had been relatively free to go
where he wanted.
Lyman visited Pretoria, Johan
nesburg (including a trip to
Soweto), theTranskei, King Wil
liams Town (where he met with
the sister of the late black activist
Steve Biko) and Capetown.
