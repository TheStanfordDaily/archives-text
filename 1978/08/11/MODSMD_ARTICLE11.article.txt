# Showers to last through weekend
## Meteors to fill skies 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Americans will be treated this Saturday to a
display of celestial fireworks as hundreds of shooting stars zip
across the predawn sky.
The event is the Perseid meteor shower, which returns each
year to dot the sky with flares and brilliant trails of light.
A careful observer almost anywhere in North America might
see as many as 60 meteors an hour when the shower peaks early
Saturday, said astronomer Paul Rogues of Los Angeles' Griffith
Observatory.
He said most action probably will be in the northeastern sky,
but the best way to hunt for meteors is to lie flat on your back on
the ground and scan the sky.
The meteors are the result of rocky debris scattered by a comet
called Swift-Tuttle 1862 111.
Rogues said the comet apparently has broken apart, leaving a
trail of gravel-sized particles in a long, looping orbit about the
sun. The earth, as it circles the sun, passes through the trail each
year and the result is the Perseid shower.
Meteors — or shooting stars — occur when a particle no
larger than a pea and often as small as a grain of sand leaves the
emptiness of space and enters Earth's atmosphere at more than
125,000 miles an hour.
Friction causes the speck to burn up about 50 miles above the
surface.
Rogues said the show normally lasts about five days and peaks
about Aug. 12.
