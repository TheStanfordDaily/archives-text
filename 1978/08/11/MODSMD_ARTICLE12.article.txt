# Eight weeks of work and play for $6250
## Executives kept busy on the Farm 
### Donna DePue 
If you think a year's tuition
puts a dent in your budget, how
would you like to spend $6250
for eight weeks of instruction?
That's exactly what 186 top
management personnel from
around the world pay to come to
Stanford's Executive Program.
What do they get for their
money?
"A mental sabbatical," stated
Pete Standbridge, president of
this year's class. "The environ
ment here requires total atten
tion to what you're doing."
In addition, they also get a
schedule that keeps them busy
from6:4s a.m. to9p.m. Atypical
day starts with breakfast in
Lagunita Court's dining hall,
then on to the business school
for three 70-minute class ses
sions. Classes are in such fields
as financial management,
economics and marketing.
There is an hour lunch break at
12:30 and then more classes
until 3:15 p.m. The rest of the
afternoon is planned for indi
vidual study and physical ac
tivities, which are encouraged to
balance the mental exercises.
Tennis and golf are the favorites
among the executives.
Evenings are set aside for
small group discussions of the
day's instructions and for ex

changing ideas and experiences.
The schedule keeps the
executives busy, but the objec
tives of the program demand a
high degree of participation.
The objectives are to "help
executives broaden their busi
ness perspectives and develop
the decision making skill re
quired for effective top man
agement performance," stated
Arjay Miller, dean of the
Graduate School of Business.
Obviously, these objectives
are being met and the program's
expansion is indicative of this
success. From its origin in 1952
with 37 participants, the prog
ram has grown to its present en
rollment of 186. As Standbridge
stated, "The program is good for
all because it is such a total
change of pace. The academics
force us to use the dormant part
of our minds."
However, despite the various
classes and activities the prog
ram provides for the executives,
they still manage to organize and
fraternize outside the schedule.
Such events as the Golfers
BBQ and a luau, given by the
kitchen staff at Lagunita, have
helped the executives unwind.
Some ethnic organizing has
emerged with the Tex-Mex party
last Sunday and the Australian
beer blast last night.

Foreign participation in the
program is limited to one-third
of the total enrollment. "The
executives prefer it that way,"
stated Fran Rinaldi, assistant di
rector of the program. "The
foreign executives want a U.S.
program; they are interested in
American ideas and opinions."
Alex Falls, of BOCM Sylcock
Ltd. in England said the wide
range of members with such var
ied backgrounds make for in
teresting discussion groups. The
American image is often rede
fined as Falls found that Ameri
cans are much friendlier than he
originally thought. "Americans
are very open and likeable, and
frank in their discussions," he

said.
On the other side of the coin,
American participants get a
closer look at the citizens from
abroad. Clark Miller of Brooks
Scanlon said he is impressed by
the foreigners' knowledge of
world affairs and that they are
more aware than the American
participants.
Bftth Falls and Scanlon stated
that the interchange of ideas be
tween participants and the good
balance of contents make the
program most enjoyable.
Next week, being the last
week of the program, is
"Spouse's Week." Participants
areinvited tobringtheirspouses
to Stanford to instruct them on

what the program has been
doing with their mates. A
number of classes are being held
for them while they are here.
Topics include Body Language,
U.S. Economy in the Seventies
and Women in the Labor Force.
Other activities include a
cocktail party and dinner dance
at the Palo Alto Golf and Country
Club next Wednesday evening.
The program ends on August
17 with the awarding of certifi
cates of completion at 11 a.m. in
the courtyard of the Graduate
School of Business. The execu
tives then become alumni of the
School of Business and are eligi
ble to join the Business School
Alumni Association.


But while the primary purpose of the program is educational, those
here for eight weeks also find time for some of the finer things in life, as
this man did at yesterday's Australian Beer bash.

Participants in the Stanford Executive Program spend a considerable time each day in class room
situations which will help them after the summer with their corporation. For $6250, there's a lot of
learning to be had for these people.
