# Cosmonauts fighting blues

Moscow (AP) â€” Two Soviet cosmonauts nearing
their eighth week in space are fighting boredom
and the blues. The ordeal is lightened with diver
sions that include talks with their families and
movie stars, television variety shows and daily
newscasts.
The Soviet space program is placing increased
importance on "cosmic psychology" and has in
cluded many diversions to relieve the tedium of
the flight for Commander Vladimir Kovalenok and
flight engineer Alexander Ivanchenkov.
But the depression that afflicts men in orbit is
still a problem.
The mental, stresses of prolonged space flight
and attempts to overcome them were discussed in
the Communist Party newspaper Pravda Wednes
day by Deputy Minister of Health Avadalik Burna
zyan and Alexei Yeliseyev, a former cosmonaut
who heads the ground control for the Soyuz 29-
Salyut 6 mission underway.
"It turns out that long stays in closed living

quarters, as well as separation from usual ground
conditions, can cause changes in the general
psyche of a man," they wrote.
The article says most information on psycholog
ical problems of prolonged space flight came
from the Soyuz 26 mission in which cosmonauts
Yuri Romanenko and Ceorgy Crechko were aloft
for a world record 96 days and 10 hours. Since
then the Soviets have broken the American record
of 937.6 man-days in space.
Pravda said menus, music and their daily exer
cise routines take into account the tastes and pre
ferences of the two cosmonauts.
The television provides the two with a wide
choice of entertainment, the article says. Espe
cially popular is a variety show called "The Magic
Lamp," which resembles American shows.
"This steady interest is a good confirmation that
they are feeling psychologically well," Burnazyan
and Yeliseyev claim.
