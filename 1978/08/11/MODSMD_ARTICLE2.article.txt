# Hospital billing legislation may be delayed till 1979
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Stanford Hospital adminis
trators are considering waiting
until next year to submit legisla
tion that would legalize hospital
billing practices which are cur
rently under investigation.
"It's a matter of timing," ac
cording to Larry Horton, as
sociate director of governmental
relations for the hospital.
Charges made against the hospi
tal are "serious and unjustified,"
and administrators want to en
sure that there is "enough time
to have an adequate hearing,
which they feel might not be av
ailable at the end of a legislative
session, an incredibly hectic
time," Horton said.
The legislation is an amend
ment to Assembly Bill 1551, in
troduced by Assemblyman Gor
don Duffy (R-Hanford). The
amendment would make it legal
for a private non-profit univer
sity medical school to charge
professional fees for services
rendered to patients by faculty
physicians.
Stanford hospital currently
operates on this basis, but the
legality of the practice is cur
rently under investigation by the
State Bureau of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA).

The investigation was brought
about by formal charges filed by
the Union of American Physi
cians (UAP). The UAP alleges
that the Medical Center billing
procedures violate section 2008
of the California Business Code,
which states that medical
schools and institutions may
make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered pa
tients."
The UAP, who filed their
charges last October, claim the
hospital violates this section be
cause it effectively bills patients

twice for services rendered.
Supervising physicians allegedly
bill patients when all the work
has been performed by interns
and residents, whose services
are covered in the hospital's
basic rate.
The hospital maintains that it
is not violating section 2008, that
it uses the same billing system as
most medical schools, and that
the system is routinely subjected
to audit by government agen
cies.
The amendment is not the first
attempt by the University to get
legislation passed to "clarify"
section 2008. Stanford's first at
tempt — an amendment to AB
1781, introduced by Assembly
man Lawrence Kapiloff (D-San
Diego) — was quashed by the
state Health Department.
The Health Department,
which sponsored AB 1781, prob
ably has many reasons for quash
ing the amendment, according
to Horton. One of these was the
controversial aspect of the
amendment might have
threatened the passage of the
whole bill, he said.
Hospital administrators, pro
vided they get what they feel is
an adequate hearing, are confi
dent they will have no problem
this time around. "We remain
wholly committed to the cor
rectness of the amendment, and
confident that when it's brought
out the merits of the case will
win handily," Horton said.
Horton got back yesterday
from four days in Sacramento,
where he spoke to Assembly
man Duffy. Duffy, who Horton
described as "a distinguished
legislator in the health area," has
"no problem with the merits of
the bill."
The bill is scheduled for sub
mission to the Senate Business
and Profession Committee next
Wednesday. Hospital adminis
trators will decide before then
whether or not to submit the
amendment along with the bill.

The charges against the hospi
tal date back to last year, but the
question of whether Stanford's
billing procedures might not be
entirely legal was raised as early
as 1965 when William Rowland,
then the business manager for
the Medical Center, wrote to
Stanford counsel Cordon
Weber asking if the University
was violating section 2008.
The issue resurfaced in
January 1977, when Dr. Eugene
Dong, associate professor of
cardiovascular surgery, filed a
complaint after being billed
himself following minor surgery
at the hospital.

"no problem with the merits of
the bill."
The bill is scheduled for sub
mission to the Senate Business
and Profession Committee next
Wednesday. Hospital adminis
trators will decide before then
whether or not to submit the
amendment along with the bill.

The charges against the hospi
tal date back to last year, but the
question of whether Stanford's
billing procedures might not be
entirely legal was raised as early
as 1965 when William Rowland,
then the business manager for
the Medical Center, wrote to
Stanford counsel Cordon
Weber asking if the University
was violating section 2008.
The issue resurfaced in
January 1977, when Dr. Eugene
Dong, associate professor of
cardiovascular surgery, filed a
complaint after being billed
himself following minor surgery
at the hospital.
