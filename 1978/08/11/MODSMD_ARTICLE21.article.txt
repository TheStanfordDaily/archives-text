## theater/karen caesar 'Colored Girls': an emotional roller coaster 
### 
"For Colored Girls Who Have
Considered Suicide/When the
Rainbow is Enuf" is a joyful, de
pressing, colorful, black-and
white, serious and hilarious
emotional roller-coaster ride
that is guaranteed to move you
in no less than 15 different direc
tions.
Currently at the Geary Theatre
in San Francisco, the show de
buted on Broadway in the fall of
1976 and has been amazing au
diences around the country ever
since. It spans every color of the
emotional rainbow, its seven
enormously talented black
actress-dancers clad each in her
own expressive hue, doing her
own thing, be it wistful reminisc
ing, cruel mimicry or explosive,
high-spirited dance.
There is no plot, just 22
"choreopoems" that deal with
everything from high school
graduation night to murder. But
author Ntozake Shange does re
volve her multi-faceted poems
around a basic theme: "the an
guish black women suffer at the
hands of black men."
Rage
In "i used to livein the world,"
a young girl recalls her life away
from New York, then assesses
the area around her and con
demns it bitterly. "I used to live
in the world, and then I moved
to Harlem. My universe is six
blocks . . ." Her rage boils
barely below the surface as she
speaks of walking purposefully
down the street, the target of
rude whistles, jeers and shouts,
being called "bitch and
"mama" and various other
epithets by men she doesn't
know or care to know. Just be
cause she is a woman, and black,
and lives in Harlem.
In "a nite with beau willie

brown," undoubtedly the best
segment in the show, Latanya
Richardson as the Lady in Red
gives a heart-wrenching perfor
mance as a young black woman
whose would-be husband has
come back from Viet Nam in a
deranged stated of mind. She
has had two children by him;
now he insists on marrying her
even though he has beaten her
and abused her love. He grabs
her two young children, de
mands that she marry him, and
brings the poem to a devastating
climax. Remember, though, he
is not physically there.
Richardson makes us see him.
The effect on the audience is
paralyzing.
Richardson, standing on stage
with the other women sitting in a
loose circle about her, is riveting
and overwhelming; the spell she
casts over the audience is almost
tangible. We laugh with her as
she flaunts her cockiness and
independence; we are dragged
down with her when she loses
what she has loved most in the
world.
Laughter
In spite of the depression
generated by some of the
"heavier" episodes, you will not
spend the entire evening fishing
for kleenex. There is a lot of
laughter in "Colored Girls." The
women bounce with considera
ble vigor to Motown's "Dancin'
In the Streets," shaking with an
enviable lack of self
consciousness, oblivious to ev
erything but the beat. Young
and vital and ready to take on the
world, they are unformed, they
are free. Once the world grabs
hold, they may suffer, and be
shackled to men who mistreat
them, but they do not fall apart.
The humor is always there —

wry, cool, even mean. They
mercilessly imitate their men
and recount every excuse
they've ever heard from them
for not coming home. There is
total empathy; they share each
other's pain, they can makeeach
other laugh. As a group, these
women blend together exquis
itely. After an hour and a half on

this emotional roller coaster
ride, the realization is finally
born: those aren't just actresses
up there, singing and dancing
their hearts out; they're real
people.
Exhaustion
"For Colored Girls" is an
exhausting spectacle to watch.
Sometimes it is hard to un
derstand (the acoustics are less
than perfect and the performers
are not always careful about
enunciating) and sometimes it
borders on trite, but what it says
it says with passion and convic
tion.
When the actresses are all on
stage comforting Richardson
after the traumatic "beau willie
brown" scene, they perform a
healing "laying on of hands,"
and it is softly done and it is
beautiful.

But when they begin to sing "I
Found God in Myself and I Love
Her," one's first inclination is to
throw up — this worn-out cliche
is out of place. One must ignore
that first inclination, though,
and listen and reflect. This play is
about exceptional people.
They are not mindlessly scream
ing that Cod is a Woman. They
are rejoicing because they
have found Cod exists inside
each one of them. There is no
thing inherently evil about being
a woman and being black. Cod
accepts them, they can accept
themselves, and so they can face
anything life gives them.
