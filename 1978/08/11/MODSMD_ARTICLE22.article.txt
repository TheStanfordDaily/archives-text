## And there he is, the great fraternal life force 
### 
Seeing Animal House is like
reading .in entire cop\ of Na
tional Lampoon in one sitting
Their movie like each is>ue or
their magazine has a near
theme or target and both attack
the subject matter with every
weapon imaginable As a result
Animal House is nearly every
kind ot tunny \ou could hope tor
.i mov te to be it uses most ot its
weapons well and some ot them
nearK pertectly and it hardl\
ever -lows the pace ot its furious
Lite Brigade charge.
However
This - not entirelv a good
thing: L nlike a magazine vou
cannot put a movie down when
vou reach the saturation point —
\ou can not -kip over sections
that do not catch vour interest
and reread those which do A
magazine can get awav with
never mak ng up it- mind on its
pci nt but movies are difterent
and -ooner or later thev need to
sett e rnto a form and keep it.

The point
The problem with this mov ie is
that it never quite tigures out
w here >t wants to go with itselt. It
races back and forth between its
various and sundrx victims,
stabbing and kicking each ot
them with panache, but it never
settle* down and winds up and
takes a shot It never decapi
tates, or even mortally
wounds am of our enemies or
patent ons — it never puts it all
nto * single blow at an underly
r.>j theme. It has a procedural
<ilimax, and even a Samuraj War

nor but too many of the enemy
escape this picture unscathed.
Animal House has no umv
and its lack of unitx doesn t hold
up on its own.
Irony
This - ironic because Animal
House features the Great
Samurai himseff. Had more been
made o T lohn Belushi more
could have been made ot the
picture as a \shole — he could
have been to Animal House
what Gary Buses was to The
Buddv Holly Story or what
Travolta was to Saturday Night
Fever Those ot course are
terrible analogies in that thev
imply that nearly everything in
Animal House outside of Be
ush was shit but its somewhat
useful to use them when trying
to guess at hov\ much better

than perfect Belushi could have
been.
Asitstands heismerelv unbe-
Ilev able. Only perfect. Partially
flawless. As |ohn Blutarskv the
Grendel ot the Delt House Be
lushi puts everything going on
around him to use — the chaos
in the picture sloshes around in
his beer bellv and boils up into
the stubble on his face. And
there he is. the great fraternal
lite force standing in a cafeteria
line eating halt a sandwich and
putting it back putting awav en
tire hamburgers in one cram
When the Delt- attack at the end
he climbs a building and stands
above it waving a sword in the
air and bellowing out NOOOOO
Prisoners The other actor- in
the movie are good but their
guns are pointed in one direc

tion and none can carry the pic
ture alone (they couldn t do to
gether for that matter!.
But that's too harsh. The other
performers in Animal House
play their parts excellently.
Stephen Furst. as Flounder, is
one of the finest fat freshman
geeks in the history of film and
Tim Watheson's Eric Stratton is
the archtvpal lovable sexist,
hornv, abrasive Frat Bro. No
one. in fact, is bad at all. Its |ust
that everybody in the movie
other than Belushi has thier own
theater of operations — all ap
proach the thing with a slightly
different kind of comic
technique and sometimes thev
don t mix with each other. It
doesn t quite work when Strat
ton hits ROTC commander and
Hitler Nouth Doug Neider
mever s horse with a golf ball
for example, because it means
that Stratton has to break with
his essential believability for a
minute and step into the world
of Mel Brooks. Not even the
most lovable of all lovable and
hornv frat bros could hit a Hitler
Youth with a golf ball from that
distance — it doesn't work be
cause it means that one kind ot
comedv has to give wav to
another. In short everybody in
this mov ie has their own lev el —
for all their strengths onlv one
among them succeeds
everywhere at once
It is Belushi. Belushi is capable
of everything, and at one point
he turns to the camera and
acknowledges that he knows
that he is — had thev given more
ot the picture to him thev would
not have regretted it.
But thev didn t. The movie
uses Belushi sparingly wander

it - at precisely these point- that
it loses it- direction and con
