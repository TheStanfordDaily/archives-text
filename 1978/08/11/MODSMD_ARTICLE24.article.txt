## A 						fast glance at Landis 
### 
He did 26 separate
interview/promotion /public
appearance "things" that day
alone, which made 106 so far,
which gets worse if one keeps
in mind that all but 15 of them
were "exceedingly dull." He'd
been all over the country on
behalf of "Animal House," ex
cept to Oregon, Baltimore and
Deniver, and he was on his way
there as soon as San Francisco
ran out of questions. He was
very pleasant, patient even,
but he did have a tendency to
announce from time to time
that (quote) I hate these god
dam things (unquote).
John Landis is the director of
"Animal House" and he "will
do anything" to get people to
see it."I like this movie," he
says while speaking at a rate
slightly faster than the speed of
sound — "I think that a lot of it
is incredibly good."
Yet we should pause at this
point for a few quick disclaim
ers. John Landis' energy
should not be seen as a nega
tive trait. The man is not nuts.
He does jump into the air from
time to time to illustrate an im
portant point, and he does
have a tendency to speak ex
tremely loud, but that's proba

bly the effect of the trip more
than anything else.
'Slime'
The man is clearly not nuts.
He is something of a genius, in
fact, a 26year-old director risen
out of a nowhere of a few years
ago into a very bright critical
spotlight. He made "Slime," a
take off on terrorific monster
movies, and then he made
"Kentucky Fried Movie," and
now he's brought us "Animal
House" with John Belushi.
"Watching this movie is like
going down memory lane with
a blow torch," says Landis.
He's right. The film is stuffed
with more humor than most
can imagine, and as a result it
has been receiving very favor
able critical reaction.
And Landis is pleased. "I
never would have done this
stuff for 'Kentucky Fried,' " he
says."It hardly bothers me that
I feel like I'm acting out a scene
from 'The Candidate.' "
"Animal House" was given
unto Landis by Universal
Studios, after they said " 'Let's
make a National Lampoon
movie!' to themselves." The
writers of "Animal House" are
National Lampoon cronies,
and Landis claims at regular in

tervals to be very impressed by
their work. "We toned it down
a little," he says"the —"the original
plot had to do with Charlie
Manson in high school."
Integrity and spirit?
"Animal House," according
to Landis, is good because it
has "integrity and spirit." It
doesn't help to have Belushi,
who he describes as "totally
larger than life. There's only
one true bad guy in it —
Neidemeyer — the rest of the
characters are basically lova
ble, and there's Belushi, who
will soon be a very big star."
Belushi, according to Landis,
"absolutely loves" the movie
— he is now preparing to make
"a serious film" ('Old Boyf
riends'), and a "bad-guy film"
('Going South'). There are
others, too, but they are "sec
ret."
Landis is currently working
on "The Incredible Shrinking
Woman" with LilyTomlin, after
which he will make "a serious
horror film that will scare the
shit out of everyone." And that
is all well and good, except that
the 4:15 reporter from The
Daily Cal is at the door. Thank
you for your time.
