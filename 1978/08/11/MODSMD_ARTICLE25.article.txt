## White's music: dull stuff 
### 
Funky rhythms and floating
vocal and violin lines created by
Michael White's band filled the
Great American Music Hall in
San Francisco last Friday night.
Even though White's form of
"jazz fusion" does not compare
to Jean Luc-Ponty's well
conceived music, White pro
duced an unexpected variety of
sounds with his violins. Yet the
music was harmonically dull.
The vocalists, dancing in long,
flowing dresses and singing lofty

melodies, caught the crowd's in
terest with their showmanship.
White's back-up band gave a
solid, but not thrilling perfor
mance.
Early in the set, the band,
suited in brown tuxedos and ruf
fled shirts, played George
Duke's "Life is Always Fine."
Energy began to flow after a slow
beginning. Later, "Magic Heart"
moved uptempo with samba and
funk rhythms.
"A Smile in Your Eyes," a
smooth ballad, was highlighted
by an interesting combination of
pizzicato violin, vocals and
synthesizer. Finally, the band
exploded into "Red Planet" and
got the crowd moving.

The bass player and music di
rector, David Daniels, control
led the band's dynamics and
held the band together with his
precise lines. The drummer
complimented the bass player
with an energetic and clean per
formance. The keyboard player
occasionally shone through with
some solo work. Butthe guitarist
was undistinguished and barely
audible except for two brief
solos.
Unfortunately, the diverse
sounds which Michael White
elicited from his violins were
often inappropriate. His sus
tained legato lines lacked the
rhythmic definition which could
have truly distinguished the
band's performance.
