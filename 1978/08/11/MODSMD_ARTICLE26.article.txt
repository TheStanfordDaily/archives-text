On The Beach ★★★
New Varsity
Thursday, August 10-Friday, August 11
What do you do when you are Greg
ory Peck in Austrailia and you hear
that the top half of the world is en
veloped in a nuclear holocaust and
you know that the mushrooms will be
blooming your way as soon as some
one gets around to pushing a button?
If I were with Ava Gardener I could
think of a few things but Scrabble
makes for dull movies. Stanley Kramer
on the other hand, presents us with
some believable episodes and in
sights into the minds of the remnants
of humanity as fhey await the inevita
ble. Sobering With "Dr. Stangelove."

[ Kubrick's excellent black comedy
J about what happens when a psychotic
J Air Force general orders a nuclear
| strike upon the Soviet Union which
neither the Pentagon's "Fail-Safe"
( system, nor the president, himself,
can stop The premise of the movie is
J possible enough fo be a little scary.
[ Peter Sellers, George C. Scott are
[ among the cost of well directed politi
[ cians, diplomats, and generals who
[ even as bunglers are responsible for
j our nation's welfare and the future of
the world To some this may not be a
! til topic of humor but we may as
[ well laugh since there is damn little
| else we can do about it.

, A combination of Sean Connery as a

j ing of T.S. Eliot's "Prutrock" used as
f> both thematic touchstone and
J dialogue tiller make this movie puzzl
y ing, episodic, pretentious, and at

, and reduced to the flippant absurdity
J" spoiled children with nothing to
; look forward to but Eternity. That is
; until Connery enters as a possible
agent of Death (Liberation). With "A
Boy and His Dog" and "Wizards."

Wizards ★★★
New Varsity
Tuesday, August 15-Wednesday, August
16
Bakshi admits that this was a warm
up for his upcoming epic production
of "The Lord of The Rings." Still, until
that is released "Wizards" is comtem
porary America's only foray into the
realm of serious animated fantasy and
Bakshi deserved credit as a pioneer.
The film is good despite some serious
shortcomings in the area of scale, plot
and repetition but the tale of fhe fu
ture contest of "Magic" and
"Technology" is very inventive and
absorbing. With "A Boy and His Dog"
and "Zardoz,"

Madame Rosa ★ ★★★
Aquarius
lust what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film would expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy on
the pathos. Simone Signoret makes
the film worthwhile with her perfor
mance as an aging whore — she easily
overcomes the occasionally dumb
dialogue, and often provides humor
at unexpected moments. With "Dear
Detective."
—|ohn Nielsen
Star Wars ★★★
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly entertain
ing and wildly visual 2) wildly enter
taining and stunningly visual 3) the
kind of movie nobody makes any
more. On second thought it's delib
erately anesthetic; little more than fhe
financial successor to "Jaws." Except
for Alec Guiness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls, or escapees from
episodes of Lassie; though I ucas is to
be praised for avoiding the asinine
political commentary implicit in
things like "Rollerball" and "Logan's
Run" his decision to center fhe action
around the aformentioned members
of the Pepsi Generation rankles and
irks and peeves. True "2001" fans in
sist that for all its visual achievements
"Star Wars" is really very bland —
even though I still don't know what
the hell was going on in Kubrick's
movie I am templed to agree.

The Cheap Detective ★★
Bijou
Cute.
If you haven't seen "Casablanca,"
"To Have and Have Not," "The Big
Sleep" or "The Maltese Falcon,"
some of the subtler points in this pic
ture will go over your skull; if you did
happen to catch them then "Cheap"
will thicken that skull greatly. The
film's cutesiness overshadows Peter
Falk's enjoyable showing, and it al
most keeps you from realizing how
un-Nurse Ratchett-like Louise
Fletcher can be. Ann-Margret's
Rumanian cleavage is much in evi
dence.
—Bill Burger

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★★
Menlo
Gary Busey's upper lip and expressive
eyebrows are as fine as any in the busi
ness; his showing as Buddy Holly
makes this picture worthwhile. Busey
can sing, too, and he also is a marvel
ously idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the end he
holds it all together. "The Buddy Holly
Story" could have been better, and
that's no hooey, but its hard to imagine
afiner hick superstar than the one we
got right now. _ | N
laws II ★
Century 24
More dying, and less life. More acting
by worse actors. An even worse plot,
and a stiffer shark. Better than "Orca
the Killer Whale," but not much.
Gratuitous and boring.
— I.N.

Dear Detective ★ ★★★
Aquarius
A murder mystery. A comedy. A
romance. French. Distinguishable
from grade-B American formulas by a
French charm infused by director Phil
lipe De Broca, the creative genius re
sponsible for the classic "King of
Hearts." Standard mofifs are given
non-standard ironic twists, but it is
difficult at times to distinguish bet
ween formula and parody, between
the assumptions the director shares
with society and the ones he is mock
ing. The leads, though, are consis
tantly good; the direction never lags;
the cinematography is a constant joy.
A murder that is a real mystery and a
romance that is a real comedy —
sometimes the two conflict, but for
the most part the picture works well.
With "Madame Rosa."
