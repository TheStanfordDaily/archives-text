# Law judge dismisses Med Center unfair labor charge
## 
### Bob Rudy 
A charge of unfair labor prac
tices filed against the Stanford
Medical Center has been dis
missed by an administrative law
judge of the National Labor Rela
tions Board (NLRB).
The charges, made by United
Stanford Employees (USE) in
February 1977, stated that the
University had violated the Na
tional Labor Relations Act
(NLRA) by distributing an
employee opinion survey that
was not voluntary and did not
guarantee anonymity.
Judge Stanley Gilbert dismis
sed the complaint "in its en
tirety," finding all charges with
out merit. Gilbert's decision was
not the first regarding this case.
In April 1977, the NLRB regional
office in San Francisco also
found the charges without
merit, and refused to issue a
complaint. USE then appealed
the decision to the NLRB's Gen
eral Counsel in Washington,
D.C. for hearing before an ad
ministrative law judge.
Throughout the case, the
union maintained the position
that the employee survey had
bypassed the union in dealing
with employees that it rep
resented, and that it would un
dermine the union's organiza
tional efforts among unrepre

sented employees.
In his decision, Gilbert noted
that administering the surveys
did not constitute "direct deal
ing" with employees rep
resented by the union. He
added that, "There is nothing in
the record as a whole that would
warrant a finding that the sur
veys were calculated to interfere
with, restrain or coerce
employees in the exercise of
their rights. . .
Martin Eichner, lawyer for
USE, stated that the union will
now appeal its case to the NLRB
as a whole, because "we do not
agree with the judge's legal con
clusions." The board is made up
of five judges, three of which
will hear the case.
The survey, according to Eich
ner, asked hospital workers to
comment on such issues as
wages and their supervisors and,
he added, "definitely weakened
the province of Ihe union."
Ron Twomey, director of per
sonnel at the Medical Center,
had defended the University's
action at the time by saying,
"We're only trying to find out
what the employees think about
conditions where they work,
and we feel its management's
responsibility to find out."
As part of his ruling, the judge
pointed out that as a result of the

survey the Medical Center has
upgraded the quality of food,
expanded the seating capacity of
the cafeteria, improved the
Medical Center "Memo" publi
cation and provided more in
formation about affirmative ac
tion.
