Seabrook approved
Concord, N.H. — The Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission ruled yesterday that
construction of the stalled Seabrook
atomic power plant can resume im
mediately.
The commission vote was 4-0.
The NRC ruled that an Environmental
Protection Agency approval last week of
the plant's cooling tunnels eliminated
the conditions which led to suspension
of the permits.
"We will begin immediately the or
derly process of reassembling the work
force and gearing up construction," said
William Tallman, president of the Public
Service Co., prime builder of the $2.3
billion plant.
But Judy Elliott, a leader of the Clam
shell Alliance, the main organizers of
public opposition to the plant, said the
group was "outraged" by the NRC deci
sion and was making plans to resume its
protests of the facility "almost im
mediately."
Food prices drop
Washington — Wholesale food prices
declined in July for the first time in 10
months, giving consumers the prospect
of relief this fall from ever-rising prices at
grocery store counters, the government
reported yesterday.
While the Labor Department's index of
wholesale food prices decreased by 0.3
percent last month, overall wholesale
prices rose bvo.s percent. Nonetheless,
the overall increase was the smallest in
five months, the department said.
Government officials said that because
of the declining wholesale food prices,
consumers can expect their food bills to
go up more slowly in the next few
months because farmers and processors
are charging less for their products.
"We would expect to see smaller in
creases in retail food prices, probably
within a month or two," said John Layng,
assistant commissioner of labor statis
tics.
Peripheral canal delayed
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
yesterday conceded defeat this year for
his $3.4 billion proposal to build the
Peripheral Canal and three major North
ern California reservoirs.
The Democratic governor's comments

came after Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy (D-San Francisco), refused to
name Assembly members to a new
committee designated to amend the
water projects bill.
"I think that's a fair judgment," Brown
said of McCarthy's comment that the bill
was dead for the year.
"I think that's an item that's going to
take a little more time. It's fairly clear that
those who opposed it in Southern
California have succeeded, at least in de
laying it for this year."
No forced sterilization
San Francisco — Courts have no au
thority to order the involuntary steriliza
tion of a mentally incompetent ward
even if the guardian consents and the
procedure is medically and socially jus
tified, the state Court of Appeal ruled
yesterday.
It rejected arguments that even in the
absence of specific laws, the court
should have the authority to order
sterilization.
The San Mateo County Superior Court
case involved a 1975 case in which a
father asked to have his daughter, 20 last
year and "severely disabled because of
profound mental retardation,"
sterilized.
He contended that because of her in
capacity she was unable to comprehend
her personal needs or to cope with her
menstrual cycle and that it would be in
her best interest to be surgically
sterilized.
Abortions still funded
San Francisco — A Superior Court
judge issued an order yesterday tem
porarily freezing a law which would limit
funds for state-funded abortions.
Judge Francis Mayer granted a tem
porary restraining order on a motion
filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union and several other local groups,
including Equal Rights advocates.
Mayer's order, pending a hearing on a
motion for a preliminary injunction, will
postpone the law which had been
scheduled to take effect Aug. 15.
"Our reaction is one of cautious ela
tion," said Joan Graff, an attorney for
Equal Rights Advocates. "We are pleased
that women will not have to suffer ir
reparable harm and injury now."

Brown criticizes tax plan
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
yesterday refused to support Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy's plan to scrap
property taxes on homes, saying it would
be hard to enact something that com
plex.
Instead, the Democratic governor,
usually a close ally of McCarthy, took a
hands-off stance on the San Francisco
Democrat's plan and stopped just short
of opposing it.
The McCarthy proposal in effect is in
competition with the income and sales
tax cuts proposed by Brown on Monday.
After Brown unveiled his plan, McCar
thy two days later said he was "mulling
over" a different tax cut plan, and then
yesterday said he would make that plan a
formal proposal.
Major provisions of the McCarthy plan
are complete repeal of property taxes for
homeowners, reimposilion of 90 percent
of Proposition 13 tax cuts for business,
repeal of the business inventory tax, $300
annual income tax rebates for renters
and annual adjustments of income tax
rates for inflation.
Prop. 6 foes ask exemption
San Francisco — Opponents of the
anti-gay teachers initiative on Califor
nia's November ballot Wednesday asked
the state Court of Appeal to exempt them
from the political contribution disclo
sure requirements of the 1974 Political
Reform Act.
They claim the law requiring disclo
sure of names of persons making a cam
paign contribution totaling $50 or more,
together with their address, occupation
and employer, violates their rights of free
expression and privacy.
One petitioner, using the name Jane
Doe, said she wants to contribute more
than $50 but disclosure would substan
tially impair her employment oppor
tunities if the initiative passes and also
would subject her to harrassment and
reprisal.
The petition further contends commit
tees seeking funds to fight Proposition 6,
as it is called, find many persons fear
similar effects and thus ultimately con-
Fire threatens Cazadero
Cazadero — Exhausted residents of this
small community waited under clouds of

sun-tinged smoke yesterday for fate and
gusting winds to spare them or bring
back flames to destroy their homes and
businesses.
Fire crews and trucks waited patiently
at both ends of town for any sign of ap
proaching fire from a lightning-sparked
blaze which had devoured 10,000 acres
of brush and timber near this Russian
River community 60 miles north of San
Francisco.
State fire officials had warned resi
dents to be prepared to leave quickly if
winds which were blowing the fire away
shifted later in the day and brought the
flames back.
Illegitimate birth rate rises
Washington — Despite increasingly
more effective methods of birth control,
the annual number of illegitimate births
in the United States more than quin
tupled between 1940 and 1975, the gov
ernment said yesterday.
A new Census Bureau report on fertil
ity shows the annual number of births
occuring outside marriage went from
90,000 or 3.6 percent of all births in 1940
to 448,000 or 14.3 percent of all births in
1975.
"Clearly, there has been a rise in il
legitimacy out of proportion to the num
bers of single women in the population,"
the report says.
Supermarket strike
San Francisco — Sympathizing clerks,
butchers and bakers union members
yesterday honored picket lines set up by
striking, locked-out Teamsters at four
major supermarket chains in the Bay
Area.
)oe Williams, recording secretary of
Local 315, which has been striking Safe
way's Richmond distribution center
since )une 19, claimed the "only people
working at Safeway stores are non
union. Any AFL-CIO Central Laborgroup
members are refusing to cross picket
lines."
Today's weather
Fair through Monday with coastal fog
and low overcast spreading inland nights
and mornings. Continued cool. Lows in
the 50s. Highs near 60 at the beaches to
near 80 inland. Small craft advisory in
cluding Suisun Bay and west delta for
