# Camp David test for Carter
## Peace summit called risky 
### 
Washington (AP) — U.S. officials said Wednes
day that President Carter's Middle East summit at
Camp David is fraught with severe risks but that
the alternative may be an end to the peacemaking
process.
According to officials, there was an atmosphere
of "desperation" in the nation's capital last week
when it appeared that the peace initiative begun
so triumphantly last November by Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat had run its course.
The officials, declining to be identified pub
licly, said there is no certainty the Camp David
summit, at which Carter will be joined by Sadat
and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, will
permit a resumption of Israeli-Egyptian negotia
tions.
But the officials said they were heartened by the
quick acceptance by both leaders to Carter's invi
tation to come to Camp David on Sept. 5.
The quick acceptance suggests that although
Sadat and Begin are loathe to accept the peace
terms of the otherside, both consider the alterna
tive to continued negotiations to be even more
unacceptable, at least for the moment, one offi
cial said.
In inviting the pair to come here, Carter is put
ting his personal prestige on the line. By all ac
counts, no prior agreements were worked out
beforehand to ensure a successful summit, and
officials do not rule out the possibility of total
failure at Camp David, with either Begin or Sadat
angrily stalking out of the negotiations.
Under one "worse case" scenario, a failure at

the summit talks would mean the definitive end to
the peace process and set Israeli-Egyptian rela
tions back to where they were at the time of their
Six Day War in October 1973.
But, as one official put it, the summit will give
both leaders the opportunity to be "statesmen"
and to be responsive to the deep yearnings of
their countrymen for a durable peace. Neither
Begin nor Sadat wants to be perceived as the one
responsible for reviving the prospect of another
war, the official observed.
Begin already has shown signs that he is willing
to try to improve his personal relationship with
Sadat, which has deteriorated steadily since the
two last met in Egypt in December,
Begin said Tuesday night that the recent per
sonal attacks directed against him from Cairo will
play no part in his thinking at Camp David.
According to the U.S. officials, discussion of
the Carter initiative began shortly after Sadat said
10 days ago there will be no more Middle East
peace talks until Israel agrees that all occupied
territories be returned to the Arabs and recog
nizes that the land issue is non-negotiable.
As a first step, the administration decided to
send Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to the Middle
East to try to avert a collapse of the peace initia
tive.
Vance apparently enabled Sadat to make a
graceful retreat from his "no more negotiations"
statement of 10 days ago by stating the willingness
of the United States to become a full partner in
the peace talks.
