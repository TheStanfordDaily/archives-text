## Reflections of a recent Stanford graduate 
### 
Patrick Flinn

I've been graduated from Stan
ford for almost two months now
and I believe that I have the long
view necessary for that objective
look at my education. In four
days I start a real job, at 7:30
every morning, just like a
grown-up. From this vantage
point in the Real World, I can
now reflect back and share my
thoughts with you. The easiest
way to describe them, I guess, is
as a collage of superlatives. After
all, Stanford is a place where we
all excel, even when we screw
up.
My smallest disappointments
and most meager challenges
were in academics. (I feel a sort
of moral obligation to first men
tion scholarship, although I only
spent about a tenth of my time
on it, and it was not the reason I
went to college in the first
place.) It was fine to get a chance
to sit next to and even exchange
a few words with the most suc
cessful scholars in the world. It
was only a little bit disturbing to
me that what they were doing
seemed really dull.
My major complaint about the
faculty is how rarely I saw the
interior of a professor's living
room. Prof. Nan Keohane once
told a group of freshman during
orientation not to expect to see
the inside of many professors'
living rooms because Stanford's
"not that kind of school."
She went on to console the
frosh by saying that professors'
living rooms were pretty much
like everybody else's, with piles
of newspaper lying around. I
thought that was pretty lame, to
be honest; my father is a profes
sor, so I know what their living
rooms are like. However, that
never eased my desire to want to
sit in some professor's house,
holding a brandy and talking
about baseball or something.
There are turning points in the
lives of every college student
(the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies calls them "nodes") and
I had a big one my freshman
year. My big node was getting so
drunk that I threw up. I did it
quietly, in the bathroom one
Saturday night, with only a half
dozen or so witnesses, but still it
was one of the most significant
moments of my life. For the first
time, I began to fear what I could
do to myself.
That fear was only truly
realized when I took the Law
School Admission Test early in
my senior year. With the same
motivation that sends thousands
of students to economics as un
dergrads (that there isn't any
thing better to study) I decided
to look into law school. Every

person who had ever told me
what he or she got on the LSAT
did better than seven hundred,
so I thought that's the least I
could do. I was wrong. I realize
now that I had used a biased
sample; only people who do
better than seven hundred tell
you what their scores were.
My biggest regret was that it
only snowed once here, and
when it did it was sort of a
joke. I almost went to Swar
thmore because I saw this pic
ture in their catalogue of a guy
and a girl walking together in the
snow with books in their arms.
The caption read: "A really
great time at Swarthmore can be
as simple as a walk to class in the
snow with a friend." More than
anything, I wanted to walk in the
snow to class with a friend like
the one in the picture in the
Swarthmore catalogue. The only
picture like it at Stanford is of
two Iranian graduate students
running into each other on
bicycles.
The best joke that was ever
told to me was in Approaching
Stanford, the publication sent to
incoming students that has more
mistakes than the phone num
bers in the Student Directory.
They said that I'd only need
about one hundred and fifty dol
lars a quarter in expenses; fall
quarter my freshman year I
spent three hundred. I didn't
even go on two of the dorm ski
trips and all my dates were
dutch. To feel like you belong to
Stanford, the skill you must de
velop (aside from tennis) is how
to spend money. Fortunately, I
learned quickly and I practice
now whenever I can.
The best relationship I had
was with a girl from my freshman
dorm who is now living with a
television repairman in Palo
Alto. She once told me I was a
"typical Stanford student" (we
were fighting) and that was the
worst insult I was ever given.
This is, you see, the Stanford
Paradox. Here is where the typi
cal student is noted for his or her
individuality and distinctness:
among peers that have no peers.
"This list of best and worsts is,
of course, not nearly complete.
There is, however, a kind of an
"essence" that permeates my
education here; a distinctive
feeling that I am not the same as I
used to be. I can't describe it — it
might be the feeling that I have a
grip on the world, and that I have
the confidence to meet it. On
the other hand, it might be that
frantic gulpofairyou take as you
sway at the edge of a cliff.

and I believe that I have the long
view necessary for that objective
look at my education. In four
days I start a real job, at 7:30
every morning, just like a
grown-up. From this vantage
point in the Real World, I can
now reflect back and share my
thoughts with you. The easiest
way to describe them, I guess, is
as a collage of superlatives. After
all, Stanford is a place where we
all excel, even when we screw
up.
My smallest disappointments
and most meager challenges
were in academics. (I feel a sort
of moral obligation to first men
tion scholarship, although I only
spent about a tenth of my time
on it, and it was not the reason I
went to college in the first
place.) It was fine to get a chance
to sit next to and even exchange
a few words with the most suc
cessful scholars in the world. It
was only a little bit disturbing to
me that what they were doing
seemed really dull.
My major complaint about the
faculty is how rarely I saw the
interior of a professor's living
room. Prof. Nan Keohane once
told a group of freshman during
orientation not to expect to see
the inside of many professors'
living rooms because Stanford's
"not that kind of school."
She went on to console the
frosh by saying that professors'
living rooms were pretty much
like everybody else's, with piles
of newspaper lying around. I
thought that was pretty lame, to
be honest; my father is a profes
sor, so I know what their living
rooms are like. However, that
never eased my desire to want to
sit in some professor's house,
holding a brandy and talking
about baseball or something.
There are turning points in the
lives of every college student
(the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies calls them "nodes") and
I had a big one my freshman
year. My big node was getting so
drunk that I threw up. I did it
quietly, in the bathroom one
Saturday night, with only a half
dozen or so witnesses, but still it
was one of the most significant
moments of my life. For the first
time, I began to fear what I could
do to myself.
That fear was only truly
realized when I took the Law
School Admission Test early in
my senior year. With the same
motivation that sends thousands
of students to economics as un
dergrads (that there isn't any
thing better to study) I decided
to look into law school. Every

person who had ever told me
what he or she got on the LSAT
did better than seven hundred,
so I thought that's the least I
could do. I was wrong. I realize
now that I had used a biased
sample; only people who do
better than seven hundred tell
you what their scores were.
My biggest regret was that it
only snowed once here, and
when it did it was sort of a
joke. I almost went to Swar
thmore because I saw this pic
ture in their catalogue of a guy
and a girl walking together in the
snow with books in their arms.
The caption read: "A really
great time at Swarthmore can be
as simple as a walk to class in the
snow with a friend." More than
anything, I wanted to walk in the
snow to class with a friend like
the one in the picture in the
Swarthmore catalogue. The only
picture like it at Stanford is of
two Iranian graduate students
running into each other on
bicycles.
The best joke that was ever
told to me was in Approaching
Stanford, the publication sent to
incoming students that has more
mistakes than the phone num
bers in the Student Directory.
They said that I'd only need
about one hundred and fifty dol
lars a quarter in expenses; fall
quarter my freshman year I
spent three hundred. I didn't
even go on two of the dorm ski
trips and all my dates were
dutch. To feel like you belong to
Stanford, the skill you must de
velop (aside from tennis) is how
to spend money. Fortunately, I
learned quickly and I practice
now whenever I can.
The best relationship I had
was with a girl from my freshman
dorm who is now living with a
television repairman in Palo
Alto. She once told me I was a
"typical Stanford student" (we
were fighting) and that was the
worst insult I was ever given.
This is, you see, the Stanford
Paradox. Here is where the typi
cal student is noted for his or her
individuality and distinctness:
among peers that have no peers.
"This list of best and worsts is,
of course, not nearly complete.
There is, however, a kind of an
"essence" that permeates my
education here; a distinctive
feeling that I am not the same as I
used to be. I can't describe it — it
might be the feeling that I have a
grip on the world, and that I have
the confidence to meet it. On
the other hand, it might be that
frantic gulpofairyou take as you
sway at the edge of a cliff.
