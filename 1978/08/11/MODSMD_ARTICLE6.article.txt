No booze
Count this Buck Clubber on
the sour side of the Department
of Athletics attempt at behavior
modification â€” namely, ban
ning the venerable six-pack from
the confines of Stanford
Stadium.
Yes, I know all the arguments
to the contrary, but let's be
realistic. I've seen and endured
more drunks and hooligans at
the so-called "dry" facilities like
Berkeley and Los Angeles than
I've ever seen on the Farm.
Thanks to your new rule,
those who used to be content
with a few beers from their port
able coolers will now compete
for booze-smuggling honors. All
you're really doing is lending
new respectability to the hip
flask.
Do us all a favor and repeal
this silly regulation.

Compulsory service
David Sartoris' plea for univ
ersal conscription (Daily, Aug. 4)
is a familiar one made many
times by those who believe that
a reduction of our freedoms is
the soluation to our social and
economic problems. The bot
tom line goes something like

this: "Since democratic
methods don't work, let us try
autocratic methods." This coun
try was founded on a contrary
principle as even a cursory read
ing of the Declaration of Inde
pendence will clearly de
monstrate. Walter Cronkite, in a
recent editorial, called Sartoris'
proposal an old one that had
been "found wanting."
Nonetheless, if one is
seduced by this idea, the very
least he can do is to indicate how
it would be paid for. With 2 mill
ion men coming of age each year

and $10,000 (surely a minimum)
spent per man, the cost would
be $20,000,000,000 annually. If
women were drafted also, the
yearly cost goes to
$40,000,000,000. And for a two
year term of service (as required
by Selective Service in the past),
the total grows to
$80,000,000,000. How, pray tell,
is this "grand experiment" to be
financed?
