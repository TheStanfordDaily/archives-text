# Cardinals prepare to choose another pope

Vatican City (AP) — The Col
lege of Cardinals, as it has done
for centuries, will assemble in
secret conclave Aug. 25 to
choose a new pontiff of the
Roman Catholic Church, the
Vaticag announced yesterday.
Among their number will be a
half-dozen Italian cardinals and
a handful of foreigners consi
dered prime candidates to suc
ceed the dead Pope Paul VI.
As tens of thousands of
people streamed through St. Pe
ter's Basilica yesterday to view
Paul's body, the Vatican also an
nounced arrangements unpre
cedented for a pope's funeral.
The White House has an
nounced that Sen. Edward Ken
nedy of Massachusetts, New
York Gov. Hugh Carey, Rep.
Robert Giaimo (D-Conn.) and
others will accompany first lady
Rosalynn Carter to Rome for the
funeral. Most of the U.S. delega
tion was to leave for Rome late
yesterday by military jet.
Pope Paul died Sunday at age
80 in his summer palace in
nearby Castel Gandolfo. The
body was on public view there
for three days before being
borne to the Vatican Wednes
day.
The Vatican announcement
did not say where the cardinals
will meet to begin casting ballots

for a new pope. But Vatican
sources said that as in the past
the site is expected to be the Vat
ican's 15th-century Sistine
Chapel, where Michelangelo's
renowned frescos look down
from the walls and ceiling.
Of the church's 130 cardinals,
115 are eligible to vote. A decree
issued by Pope Paul barred
those over age 80 from voting.
Forty-three cardinals were
present at yesterday's daily
gathering of the Congregation
of Cardinals, the group that
oversees day-to-day operation
of the church until a new pope is
elected. The congregation
grows steadily as more and more
cardinals arrive in Rome.
American cardinals are not
among the "papabili," or possi
ble popes. Among the Italians
most frequently mentioned are
Cardinals Sebastiano Baggi, Ser
gio Pignedoli, Pericle Felice and
Giovanni Benelli. Foreign
"papabili" are Dutch Cardinal
Johannes Willebrands and
Eduardo Pironio of Argentina.
Some Vatican observers say
chances for a non-Italian pope
are the best they've ever been.
They note that the College of
Cardinals, which was 34 percent
Italian when it elected Paul 15
years ago, is now only 22 percent
Italian.
