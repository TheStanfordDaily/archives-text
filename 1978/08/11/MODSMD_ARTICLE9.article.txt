# Carter outlook dim in polls
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Half of the
American people do not want
President Carter to run for re
election in 1980, compared with
four out of 10 who want him in
the race, an Associated Press-
NBC poll shows.
This substantial opposition to
the White House incumbent has
been built as Americans' rating
of Carter remained at the lowest
levels of his administration, the
poll found.
Carter's job rating has dipped
so far in the last six months that it
is below that which the public
now gives Richard Nixon in look
ing back on his years in the Oval
Office.
More than a third of those
who voted for Carter in 1976 say
they do not want him to run
again in two years, the poll also
showed.
There was at least one bright
spot for the president in the find
ings: the public trust in Carter —

as distinguished from his job rat
ing — rose again this month.
That upward move continues a
trend which began earlier this
summer after 15 months of de
cline.
The latest poll was taken
Monday and Tuesday. The major
ity of the 1600 telephone inter
views were completed before it
was announced that Carter
would meet with Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
at Camp David next month to try
to restart the stalled Middle East
peace talks.
Fifty percent of those ques
tioned said they do not want
Carter to run for re-election in
1980. Thirty-eight percent said
they would like to see him run.
Twelve percent were unde
cided.
The nation's Democrats were
split on a Carter re-election bid.
Half of the members of his own
party said they want Carter to
run for re-election. The remain
ing half were not so sure: 39 per
cent don't want him to run and
11 percent were undecided.
Among Republicans, 26 per
cent would like Carter to run,
with 66 percent saying they don't
want him to run. The rest were
undecided.
The crucial and large group of
independent voters split 53-33
against a Carter re-election bid.
Looking at those who said
they voted for Carter in 1976,
half Of those said they want to
see Carter run for re-election in
1980. But 37 percent of his 1976
supports don't want to see Car

ter try again.
In recent months, AP-NBC
News polls and others have
shown Carter facing trouble
when mached against potential
1980 primary or general election
opponents. But such findings
are a reflection of the potential
opponent's popularity as well as
Carter's.
The finding of this poll is sig
nificant because it shows sub
stantial opposition to a Carter
re-election bid, regardless of
who the opponent is.
Carter's job rating was down
slighly this month, but not sig
nificantly.
Twenty-six percent of the pub
lic gave Carter a "good" or "ex
cellent" job rating. But 73 per
cent labeled his performance
"only fair" or "poor." One per
cent was undecided.
In the June AP-NBC News poll,
27 percent gave Carter good or
excellent marks while 70 percent
rated his work only fair or poor.
Since the error margin for a poll
of 1600 people is 3 percent, one
cannot say the change from June
to August is a significant one.
Four years after Nixon res
igned as president in disgrace,
36 percent of those questioned
rated his performance good or
excellent, 10 points above Car
ter's rating. Sixty-two percent
rated his work only fair or poor.
Two percent was undecided.
While Nixon's rating is over-all
higher than Carter's, 34 percent
rated Nixon as poor, versus 20
percent who gave Carter that rat
ing.
