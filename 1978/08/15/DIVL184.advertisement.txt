I Lie down
and
be counted.
President jimmy CtMv Mgo#d up 51 fi^es
In America, 3% of the people
give 100% of all the blood
that's freely donated
Which means that if only 1 %
more people—maybe you—
became donors, it would add
over thirty percent more blood
to America's voluntary blood
stream, Think of It!
But forget arithmetic. Just
I concentrate on one word.
The word is Easy.
' Giving blood is easy. You
hardly feel it (in fact, some peo
ple say they feel better physi
cally after a blood donation).
And, of course, everybody
i feels better emotionally.
Because it's a great feeling
knowing your one easy blood
donation has helped up to live
i other people to live.
So how about it, 1 % of
America? Are you going to lie
down and be counted?
Call your local Red Cross
Chapter, or your community's
volunteer blood bank We need
you now.
Red Cross
discounting
v j§jn on you.
