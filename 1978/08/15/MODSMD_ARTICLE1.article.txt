# Maxwell: alumna as college trustee
## 
### John Nielsen 
Alumni-elected members of
the Board of Trustees are by no
means second-class citizens
there; they escape none of the
privileges and responsibilities
accorded to appointed mem
bers. Neither are alumni trus
tees as ideologically or racially
distinct from the rest of the
board as they used to be.
Yet there are substantive
ways in which alumni trustees
differ from other trustees —
perhaps the most telling dif
ference is wrapped up in the
relationship between those
who vote and those who are
elected.
Needless to say, alumni trus
tees are elected and must
therefore inevitably deal with
questions raised by this pro
cess — many of these ques
tions turn on the amount of
loyalty owed to voters by those
elected. Should alumni trus
tees feel bound by the opin
ions of the group they repre
sent? What group do they rep
resent? Are students, who do
not vote, to be given any atten
tion? If so, what happens when
their opinions clash with those
of other grouprs?
Do alumni trustees have a
constituency?
Barbara Maxwell, a recently
elected member of the board,

is quick to agree that such
questions are problematic. She
holds, in fact, that in its usual
sense "constituency" is not a
good word in this case. "The
trustee elections are different
from those held in public in
stitutions for instance," she
says. "There are no endorse
ments, and there is no cam
paigning — in its normal politi
cal sense I would say that the
word doesn't fit."
The trustees are different
from, say, school board mem
bers, says Maxwell; though it
remains necessary to keep
lines of communication open
between the trustees and
those concerned with their
workings, there are other con
siderations.
Maxwell, who has served on
the San Marino School Board,
is aware of the complications
that can arise. "Public expo
sure to all stages of process by
which problems are worked
out can complicate matters ter
rifically," she says, as "such
processes inevitably involve
considerable give and take,
and many outside the
decision-making process do
not appreciate the necessity
for this.
Thus is there "a difference
between private and public en
tities," according to Maxwell.

Yet her reasoning here, she in
sists, ought not to be taken as
an argument that the board
should ignore the opinions of
the"voters," or of even of
many non-voters.
"I may be wrong," says
Maxwell," but it seems to me
we have a tremendous respon
sibility to the students, for
example. It seems to me that
one of the reasons we have
elected trustees at all is be
cause of student dissatisfaction
with the state of the board in
the early '70s — some of the
credit has to go to the students,
and we do have a responsibility
to them."
It is a balancing act of sorts,


Barbara Maxwell
then, between the need to
heed outside opinions and the
desire to maintain an effective
decision-making process. Mat
ters are complicated by the dif
ficulties encountered when
alumni trustees attempt to
gauge outside opinions. "Re
member," says Maxwell, "that
alumni don't always agree
among themselves, and that
students do not always agree
with alumni. It appears from
what I've read that there is less
distance between opinions
than there once was, that dif
ferences are not as obvious as
they once were. But we have
considerable disagreements
just the same."
The relationship between
alumni trustees and alumni,
then, is marked both by its
complexity and "private in
stitution" starting point. Yet
Maxwell, for one, does not ap
pear willing to allow the com
plexity to close her off from
outside opinions.
