### 
Washington (AP) — Sen. Wal
ter Huddleston, (D-Ky.), said
yesterday the United States
should consider the cost to itself
of its immigration policies.
In a statement submitted to
the Senate judiciary Commit
tee's subcommittee on immigra
tion, Huddleston called for "a
rational immigration policy
based upon factual knowledge."
"We can no longer continue
to indiscriminately open our
doors to the dissatisfied and
growing population of the world
without considering the possi
ble adverse consequences to
ourselves," he said.
"As a frontier nation, we could
at one time afford the luxury of
inviting and encouraging almost
unlimited immigration.
"However, we have now pass
sed the state of being a frontier
country and, while there is still a
great potential for growth, we
must realize that our resources
are limited."

Huddleston said he was riot
advocating "an isolationist pol
icy which seeks to close the
doors to every immigrant."
"Instead, I am suggesting that
we develop a rational immigra
tion policy based upon factual
knowledge rather than con
tinuing to assume that policies
adopted 25 years ago are still ap
propriate," he said.
"I do not believe that the Un
ited States can continue to act as
a safety valve for other countries
without determining what the
costs are, if any, to our own citi
zens."
Huddleston made the state
ments in testimony on behalf of
a bill he sponsors that would au
thorize the Border Patrol to seize
vehicles being used to smuggle
illegal aliens into the country.
His statement was not deli
vered in person, as he was late
arriving in Washington on a
flight from Louisville, Ky.
