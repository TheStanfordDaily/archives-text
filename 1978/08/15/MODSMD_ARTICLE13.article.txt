## art/elliot klein Looking at Lange today 
### 
You have barely one week to
visit the Oakland Museum's re
trospective show of Dorothea
Lange's photographs. When
Lange died in 1965, over 40,000
of her negatives passed on to the
Oakland Museum, a significant
repository for a photographer
who had spent most of heractive
years in the Bay Area.
The current exhibition is the
first to draw on Oakland's col
lection, and so it contains many
previously unpublished photos
as well as samples of Lange's
most celebrated social
documentary work. A visit to the
Oakland Museum's splendid
show will give you a chance to
experience the evolution of a

key image-maker of modern
times.
Beyond its power to put us
face to face with Dorothea
Lange's work, a comprehensive
show like this is welcome for re
storing the photography to an
original context. First of all,
there is the background of
Lange's development as an artist
and reporter. Thanks to the
chronological and thematic
grouping we can see how Lange
first mastered a studio portrait
esthetic, and then moved
beyond it in favor of a personal
documentary style.
Better appreciate
Also, thanks to the museum's
installation we can better ap

preciate Lange's position within
the events of her own time.
Through the many documents
on display beside the photo
graphs, through the letters and
field notes that Lange wrote, we
get an immediate sense of a
woman working at a specific
time and on specific assign
ments. he organizers of this
show have done a fine job, not
only in sifting through and edit
ing the enormous bequest of
Lange's negatives, but also in
creating a sense of the personal
ity behind the work.
What emerges from this re
trospective is the change in
Lange, of course, but also the

indelible continuity of her best
work. A quality is common both
to the most familiar images —
the migrant workers and the
urban bread lines — and to many
others which ar6 new at this
show. While Lange could imbue
her human subjects with a
statuesque, timeless quality, she
never failed to establish their
rootedness in mundane reality.
Translated into practical terms,
Lange had an eye for the salient
detail — often a feature of dress,
pose, or expression — which
immediately revealed her sub
jects as individuals, people with
feelings. The cliche is essentially
right: Lange had a specially
human way of seeing.
First encounter
It was the political turmoil and
poverty of Depression-torn San

Francisco that brought Dorothea
Lange's camera out of the por
trait studio. Some of the most
powerful images in the Oakland
show date from this first en
counter with the workers,
tramps and police on the city
streets. Lange's photos at this
time often project a distant, sur
reptitious view, as it the photo
grapher, used to the intimate
studio, was not yet ready to in
teract with strangers.
The Oakland show gives
ample attention to the best
known of Lange's work, the
photographs she produced as an
investigative photographer for
state and federal agencies.
These are chiefly portraits of
migrants and rural people perse
rvering in the face of destitution.
Lange often shows her subjects
in repose, in a way that suggests

she has been having an easy
conversation with them. And
her people face the camera
frankly, trusting the photo
grapher to document their con
dition.
A photograph ot migrants ti
tled "Bound for California" care
fully records all the details of a
long journey: a sedan with Kan
sas license plates, a canvas
covered trailer filled with belong
ings, and a goat standing in a pen
which is rigged to the car's run
ning board. But the photograph
is more than an accumulation of
detail. The impeccable composi
tion seems to freeze the figures
into a timeless moment; and in
their rich detail they remain,not
props or symbols, but humble
representatives of eternal
human values.
More than almost any other

medium, documentary photo
graphy demands to be discussed
with explicit regard to the cir
cumstances behind it, and to its
impact. Thus it's important to
know that Lange's photographs
were often successful at getting
government funds for projects
to which they brought attention.
But in the long run, it's more
important to judge these photo
graphs for the richness and
scope they brought to the
medium of documentary photo
graphy. Lange did much of her
work at a time before the
photo-essay had been fully de
veloped in form.
Lange's instinct for detail has a
lot to do with that success. And
so does her willingness to take
risks at the frontier of her
medium, to get close to her sub
jects and to break rules if neces

sary. In her frank effort to por
tray what was there before her,
personal style become a tool for
communication and not an im
position in itself.
Because our culture is clut
tered with simulations and
second-hand images, it is almost
possible to neglect the real
scenes behind these pictures.
But then with a glance at the per
sonal effects of Lange, and a
more alert look at the photo
graphs themselves, it becomes
clear that Lange chose as her
subject the world as she found
it. And she made her photo
graphy a tool for defining a par
ticular moment in history by
stamping it with some human
essence. Her photography fi
nally affirms the real over the
abstract, and individuality over
anonymity.
