## art/elliot klein Looking at Lange today 
### 
You have barely one week to
visit the Oakland Museum's re
trospective show of Dorothea
Lange's photographs. When
Lange died in 1965, over 40,000
of her negatives passed on to the
Oakland Museum, a significant
repository for a photographer
who had spent most of heractive
years in the Bay Area.
The current exhibition is the
first to draw on Oakland's col
lection, and so it contains many
previously unpublished photos
as well as samples of Lange's
most celebrated social
documentary work. A visit to the
Oakland Museum's splendid
show will give you a chance to
experience the evolution of a

key image-maker of modern
times.

face to face with Dorothea
Lange's work, a comprehensive
show like this is welcome for re
storing the photography to an
original context. First of all,

Lange's development as an artist
and reporter. Thanks to the
chronological and thematic
grouping we can see how Lange
first mastered a studio portrait
esthetic, and then moved
beyond it in favor of a personal
documentary style.

Also, thanks to the museum's
installation we can better ap

preciate Lange's position within
the events of her own time.
Through the many documents
on display beside the photo
graphs, through the letters and
field notes that Lange wrote, we
get an immediate sense of a
woman working at a specific
time and on specific assign
ments. he organizers of this
show have done a fine job, not
only in sifting through and edit
ing the enormous bequest of
Lange's negatives, but also in
creating a sense of the personal
ity behind the work.
What emerges from this re
trospective is the change in
Lange, of course, but also the
