## Sex and violence 
### 
She is Faye Dunaway, an ac
tress. This time around she plays
the role of Laura Mars, a con
troversial fashion photographer,
who sells pictures by using sex
and violence as themes.
He is Irvin Kershner, a direc
tor. In his current film, "Eyes of
Laura Mars," he attempts to sell
a film with the lure of sex and
violence as cinematic themes.
Laura Mars is a success as a
photographer. "Eyes of Laura
Mars" is not a success as a
movie.
Basically a murder mystery,
the film stars Miss Dunaway as a
commercial photographer and
"artist" who meticulously takes
models, clothes them in a guise
of bizarre sexuality, surrounds
them with death and destruction
and then takes their pictures for
posterity and profit. Her life be
comes a nightmare when art be
comes reality and her associates
are murdered one by one. To
make it all more terrifying, she
somehow psychically senses
these brutal scenes before they
happen. Tommy Lee Jones plays
the police detective called in to
unravel the perplexing mass be
fore Laura gets done in herself.
Nothing to do with anything
From the start, it is a movie of
endless incongruities. The film

opens with the haunting eyes of
Laura Mars as Barbara Streisand
sings a theme song that has no
thing to do with anything except
the fact that the film's producer,
Jon Peters, is also the singer's
current boyfriend. Self-serving,
but understandable.
A little more incomprehensi
ble is the inconsistency between
Laura Mars' profession and her
personality. Why is it that this
fundamentally friendly, modest
woman decided to make a
career of photographing naked
bodies bathed in blood? Not
only are we not given any ans
wer, we don't even get a clue.
Kershner gives similar non
treatment to the subject of the
protagonist's penchant for pre
cognition. Laura Mars is a poten
tially very interesting character.
Sadly, the director leaves her
unexplored and the actress, who
has some solid past perfor
mances to her credit, leaves her
undeveloped.
As the detective-love
interest-hero, Jones gives us a
portrayl so low-key, it borders
on non-existence.
Doesn't transcend
Somewhere along the line,
perhaps from the enticing tele
vision commercials that have
appeared in abundance, I got

the notion that this film was
going to transcend mere sen
sationalism and make some im
portant social commentary.
Throughout most of the movie, I
kept waiting hopefully. Early on,
Laura Mars states very matter
of-factly, "I'm trying to give an
account of the times in which
I'm living. Times of real, moral
and spiritual murder." An au
spicious beginning, but that one
little morsel of morality is the
only taste we get the whole
evening.

An obviously important
sociological phenonema, sex
and violence in our culture also
seems to be a rich source for
cinematic development. The
fact that "Eyes of Laura Mars"
just barely skims the surface of
this topic is definitely the most
distressing aspect of the film.
Visually, the director has
created some appealing scenes.
But thepaceis slow, the dialogue
flat and the musical score the
most heavy-handed since
"Jaws." Something positive?

This movie, one of unfulfilled
potential, might have been bet
ter off calling itself "Legs of
Laura Mars" and passing itself
off as a satire of the times in
which we live.

The costumes, representing the
latest in New York jet-set fashon,
were a constant source of plea

outfits that Miss Dunaway wore,
especially the silky skirts that al
ways managed to exhibit most of
her legs.
