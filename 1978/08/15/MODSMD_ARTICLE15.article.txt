## No more put-ons 
### 
The real reason why I
went to seethe Dictators at the
Old Waldorf up in San Francisco
last Wednesday was because
Karen (Caesar, the Daily's enter
tainment editor) needed some
copy for the entertainment
page. When she asked me if I
wanted to go she made some
remark to the effect that "we
cover all the biggies, don't we?"
It could have been merely my
compassion for Karen's having
to face those blank pages that
induced me to take the assign
ment. This, however, is unlikely,
it being the end of the quarter
and I, in typical fashion, having
accumulated two papers and a
take home final to do in the last
two weeks. Unbeknownst to
most, the Dictators have come
out with a new album — Blood
brothers, on Asylum — that
made me curious to see them
live.
But I'm warning you. Usually
the first time you read about a
previously unknown band ("un
known" here meaning they've
probably been around for four
years and even cut a couple of
albums, but this is the first time
you've ever heard of them), it is
because the band has precipi
tated a rave review. This is not a

rave review. Much of it, in fact,
could be labeled whiney com
plaints.
In question
The unknown band in ques
tion, the Dictators, is fiveyoung
men from the Bronx who ap
peared four years ago amidst the
New York scene that also
spawned Patti Smith, Television,
the Talking Heads and the
Ramones. Labeled then as punks
— a meaningless phrase that is
even less applicable now — the
Dictators play what they call
simply rock 'n roll, very loud and
very fast, music that is the result
of an amalgamation of influ
ences, with the Who, Kiss, and
the MCS being most evident.
The Dictators' trademark until
recently has been their "unpre
tentious humor," which has fo
cused on the persona of their
lead singer, Handsome Dick
Manitoba. Handsome Dick —
who started out in life as Richard
Blum, a roadie and cook for the
band — is renowned for such
feats as being born and raised in
Co-op City, the largest housing
project in the Bronx, and for his
ability to be loudmouthed, un
inhibited, zany and irrepressi
ble. He also used to be kinda
plump, too, which helped.

In fact at first, the whole band
saw themselves as just a big
put-on. Even today, they are still
living out the fantasy that Adny
Shernoff, bass player and guid
ing force of the band, had when
he was back in the Bronx editing
the Teenage Wasteland Gazette
writing reviews of albums he had
never heard. (Adny's real name,
of course, is Andy — but that's
all part of the put-on, just like
the name of the band.) The Dic
tators, Shernoff says, are just
rock n' roll fans who wanna be
come rock n' roll stars. They're
just out to have a good time.
They came out loud and fast
and loose and laughing at them

selves and put out an album on
Epic, "The Dictators Co Girl
Crazy," which featured Hand
some Dick on the cover (this was
the period when he claimed to
be a professional wrestler).
There are those that think this
album is a brilliant heavy metal
parody, two years ahead of its
time. Actually, it was pretty
awful and it bombed. (A friend
of mine won a copy, listened to
the first side and left it out in the
sun to warp.)
Response to the band live
equaled the response to the re
cord, and the Dictators, while
claiming to be misunderstood,
got scared. The result: their sec
ond album, "Manifest Destiny,"
which was instantly supposed to
strike a responsive chord
among the legions of "let me
hear you say boogie" heavy
metal Grand Funk/Deep
Purple/Kiss fans. All the Dic
tators wore leather and studs for
that one. It didn't go over,
either.
Put-on turns serious
The Dictators have finally
begun to hit their stride with
their third album, Blood

brothers — the put-on has
started to become serious.
Music, not heavy-handed jokes,
has become the preoccupation
of the band. After several per
sonnel changes, the band has
settled into a five-man config
uration that works well, propel
led by the solid rhythm section
of Richie Teeter on drums, Adny
on bass and Top Ten on rhythm
guitar.
When the Dictators settle into
a riff, there is a real confidence
evident in the music; they no
longer have to hide behind an
ear-splitting volume. But there
are still problems. Behind all the
leather, the Dictators are nice
guys and, well, kinda corny.
They sing about cars, girls,
weekends, hamburgers and
other American artifacts with
real affection — Adny is serious
when he talks about America a?
"the epitome of civilization —
air conditioning, hotels, color
TV." Much of the band's idea of
humor has yet to progress
beyond the level of "I think
johnny Carson's real fast and I
don't care if I have to kick your
ass."
