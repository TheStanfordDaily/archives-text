Carter speaks to farmers
Columbia, Mo. — President Carter, in
an upbeat but tough speech yesterday to
a major farmers organization, blamed
what he called "special economic in
terest lobbies" for making the fight
against inflation nearly impossible to
win.
At the same time, the president told
the Mid-Continent Farmers Association
that he wanted to do everything possible
"to get the government out of the farm
business." •
Carter won applause when he said, "I
will not permit unrestricted beef imports
next year." Increased imports could
lower the prices consumers pay for meat
as well as the prices paid to farmers for
livestock.
Combining his report on farming,
which was interrupted for more than a
dozen times by applause, with his attack
on the special interest lobbies, Carter
said:
"These lobbies care absolutely no
thing about the national interest — as
long as they get theirs. We will never win
the fight against inflation unless we help
the Congress resist those pressures."
Assassination hearings
Washington — Martin Luther King Jr.'s
friend and successor told congressmen
yesterday he is convinced the civil rights
leader's assassination was a conspiracy
— and thinks King was told it was com
ing.
"He had a premonition or maybe
some knowledge," the Rev. Ralph David
Abernathy," testified. "I think he had re
ceived some word, from some sources,
that he was going to be assassinated."
Abernathy gave that testimony as the
House Assassinations Committee held
the first public hearings on its $5 million
investigation of the murders of King and
President John F. Kennedy.
Outside the hearing room, Abernathy
told reporters he believes the FBI was
involved in the assassination and told
King in advance "to warn him and to
threaten him both."
Abernathy said he has no evidence to
support that but believes it because of
the FBl's admitted harassment of King
and efforts to disrupt his activities.
Memphis police strike
Memphis, Tenn. — Firefighters joined
striking police on picket lines yesterday
in defiance of court orders and their
mayor, deepening a crisis that already
had Memphis on dush-to-dawn curfew
and has brought out National
Guardsmen in riot gear to help arrest
police.

Mayor Wyeth Chandler, saying the
strikers are trying to close down the city,
announced Memphis is taking applica
tions for their jobs — and that the per
sonnel office had received more than
2000 applications.
As far as he is concerned, he said, the
strikers have quit.
May of the city's 1100 unionized police
officers were defying both a court order
to return to work and a notice that they
would be fired if they stayed out. The
firefighters were resuming a walkout
that began in July but was cut short then
by a court order which is still in effect.
In a pre-dawn sweep Mnday, some 300
National Guard troops in riot helmets
rumbled through town in tracked vehi
cles and trucks, supporting non-striking
and supervisory police in the arrest of
more than 60 picketing officers.
Chandler ordered the action after re
ports that windows had been broken at
precinct stations and that striking offic
ers had blocked working officers' cars at
precinct stations.
Kucinich survives recall
Cleveland — Dennis J. Kucinich, Cleve
land's feisty, 31-year-old mayor, savored
an unofficial 275-vote victory over a re
call drive yesterday, saying "I'm not
going to let the city government be sto
len from the people."
Kucinich said he was prepared to go to
court, if necessary, to defend his victory
but said "there's not going to be any
probelms with those ballots" cast Sun
day.
As he looked to the remainder of his
two-year term, Kucinich, a maverick
Democrat, faced the task of mending
fences with a hostile all-Democratic City
Council. Twenty-four of the 33 council
members supported the recall drive.
The council's cooperation will be
necessary to solve major financial prob
lems. The city faces the prospects of pay
less paydays for its 10,000 employees and
default on $15.5 million in municipal
securities before the year ends.
In Sunday's special election, an unof
ficial count of paper ballots by the
Cuyahoga County Board of Elections
showed Kucinich setting back recall
forces by a margin of 60,308 to 60,033.
Supermarket strike vote
Los Angeles — With Teamster
warehousemen off the job at supermar
ket chains in the San Francisco Bay Area,
70,000 retail clerks vote today on
whether to walk out at every major
supermarket from Bakersfield to the
Mexican border.
Leaders of nine Retail Clerks Union
locals unanimously urged rank-and-file
members to reject the latest proposal by

the Food Employers Council, and a man
agement spokesman conceded a strike
vote was likely.
"We think it was a reasonable offer
with generous increases in each of the
next three years, plus cost-of-living in
creases and other fringe benefits," said
employer spokesman Bob Voigt. "But
our offer and the union's demands are
still far apart, so we cannot be optimis
tic."
In the past few weeks, Voigt said, the
15 major food chains facing the walkout
have hired more than 10,000 persons on
a contingency basis, with the jobs to
begin as soon as a strike is called, Voigt
said.
The supermarket chains involved are
Albertsons, Alpha Beta, Arden-Mayfair,
Boys, Certified Grocers, Hughes, A.M.
Lewis, Lucky Stores, Market Basket,
Ralphs, Safeway, Smiths Food King, Sta
ter Bros., Thrifty Mart and Vons.
"We expect some inconvenience and
some empty spots on the shelves" as the
result of a strike, Voigt said. "But no one
is going to go hungry."
McCarthy pushes tax plan
Sacramento — Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy pressed ahead yesterday with
his proposal to virtually eliminate
homeowner property taxes, after mak
ing concessions to farming interests.
"I'm very encouraged to take the next
step forward," the San Francisco Demo
crat said after meeting with rural Senate
Democrats.
The measure must pass both houses
by Friday to have a chance of reaching
the November ballot. The Legislature
must also vote to extend the deadline for
November ballot measures until Friday.
In related action, a two-house confer
ence committee contingued negotiating
on another ballot measure that would
put a constitutional limit on government
spending.
McCarthy's plan, announced only last
week, would eliminate all but a small
amount of homeowner property taxes;
increase the renter's tax credit from $37
to $300 a year; and adjust income tax
brackets for inflation about three per
cent.
It also would restore taxes on business
and rental property to 90 per cent of the
pre-Proposition 13 level.
Gas leak in Orange
Orange — Up to 3000 people were
evacuated yesterday from a two
square-mile area that included college
dormitories, homes and businesses after
a volatile gas began spewing into the air
at a plastics factory, authorities said.
Ten firemen were treated forexposure
to the gas.

The incident began when styrene
monomer, an unstable liquid and an in
gredient in disposable clear-plastic
drinking glasses, changed chemically
into a gas and forced its way out through
safety valves of a 44,000-gallon storage
tank at Sterling Plastics Corp. It sent
eye-burning, skin-blistering fumes with
the odor of singed plastic into the air,
said Assistant Orange Fire Chief William
Wade.
Nazi organizers beaten
Kansas City, Kansas — Club-wielding
attackers broke into a radio station Sun
day night and beat two Nazi organizers at
the start of a live talk show on which they
were appearing as guests, police re
ported.
Micahel Breda, the Kansas organizer
for the American White Peoples Party,
and an unidentified companion were
slightly injured, receiving head lacera
tions. Two station workers also were in
jured in the attack by about 15 persons,
police said.
Mark Elliott, host of KCKN's talk show
"Community Hot Line," said the entire
incident was broadcast live.
"I heard some commotion, then they
rushed in," Elliott said. He said the attac
kers then began swinging clubs. Police
described the attackers as a group of
blacks and whites.
Walton to Golden State?
Oakland —While there seemed to be
no dispute over Bill Walton's desire to be
traded to Golden State, both the War
riors and the Portland Trail Blazers were
guarded yesterday about whether they
would make a deal for the star center.
Blazers' spokesman John White said
Sunday, "He's not going anywhere un
less we make a deal." The Blazers, who
won the 1977 National Basketball champ
ionship with Walton as its leader, would
say nothing at all Monday. Any team ac
quiring Walton would have to compen
sate Portland.
Apparently, according to Walton as
sociates, the 6-foot-11 center is deter
mined to go to the Warriors, even
though he reportedly was offered more
money by the New York Knicks. He is
said to prefer San Francisco's Bay Area
and its fans.
Today's weather
Friday through Monday fair except
patchy fog on the coast. Temperatures
will average near normal coast and coas
tal valley areas and slightly below normal
in the interior. Highs in the 60s and 70s
near the coast and the 80s and 90s inland
valleys. Lows in the 50s and 60s at low
altitude.
