# Program to study health education

The Stanford Heart Disease Prevention
Program has been awarded a $6.15 million
grant over the next five years to study the
effect of comprehensive health education
programs on the health of California com
munities.
The study will he based on experience
gained from the recently concluded Stan
ford Three Community Study. According to
that study, community-based health educa
tion which relies heavily on mass media can
persuade people to change their life style
and improve their health status.
The study also showed that risk factors
associated with heart disease could be sig
nificantly reduced in communities receiv
ing comprehensive health education.
The new study, which will involve Mon
terey County and other cities and counties
in California, will be known as the Stanford
Community Health Project. Dr. )ohn Far

quhar, professor of medicine and director
of the Heart Disease Prevention Program, is
the principal investigator.
In the study, investigators from the
School of Medicine will develop mass
media education programs to be used in
several cities with populations of 50-
150,000.
The focus of the study, according to Dr.
Peter Wood, another principle investigator,
is to determine for the first time the effect of
such health education campaigns on actual
heart attack and death rates in entire com
munities.
The health of residents will be continu
ously monitored for cardiovascular risk: in
cluding biood pressure, relative weight,
plasma lipoprotein levels and smoking,
exercise and dietary habits.
In addition, a team from the Medical
School will carry out surveillance studies for

death and disability due to cardiovascular
disease. Changes in the community know
ledge, attitudes, and behavior related to
health will also be recorded.
According to Farquhar, researchers will
work with interested organizations within
the cities so that the educational effort will
be run to a considerable extent by the cities
themselves.
A clear decline in U.S. cardiovascular dis
ease rates in recent years, says Farquhar, is
attributed in part to healthful changes in
lifestyle such as reduced tobacco consump
tion, improved dietary habits and increased
exercise levels.
"This important new funding should en
able us to design, strengthen and pretest
cost-effective mass media methods to ac
celerate this welcome national trend to
wards better health," said Farquhar.
