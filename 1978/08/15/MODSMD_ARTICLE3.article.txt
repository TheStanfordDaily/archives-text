# Santa Barbara claims disaster

### 
Santa Barbara (AP — The Santa
Barbara County Supervisors de
clared a local disaster yesterday
and urged the state to follow suit
as residents try to deal with an
estimated $4.5 million in dam
ages from a Sunday earthquake.
Aftershocks, most too weak to
be felt, continued through the
day as scientists tried to pinpoint
the fault responsible for a jolting
earthquake that injured about 60
persons in this coastal city.
Supervisors voted yesterday
afternoon to ask the state to de
clare the county a disaster area
to make loans and other finan
cial assistance available to
homeowners and businessmen,
said Jeff Samsom, assistant
county administrative officer.
He said the $4.5 million dam
age figure was "a very prelimi
nary estimate. Most of it is pri
vate property."
Dozens of mobile homes were
badly damaged although few
houses suffered serious prob
lems, Samson said, adding,
"They were mostly cosmetic
things like cracked plaster and
broken windows and a lot of in
terior damages such as broken
furniture and dishes.
"Most people, I'm afraid,
didn't have earthquake insur
ance."
Dr. Michael Reichle, mean
while, said one of several faults
in the Santa Barbara Channel,
where the quake was centered,

could have caused the temblor.
The most likely candidate is
the Pitas Pointfault, "but itcould
be a new one we haven't map
ped yet," said the University of
California-Santa Barbara seis
mologist.
Reichle said he hopes to find
the exact site of the worst ear
thquake to hit a populated area
in California in several years by
measuring the continuing flurry
of aftershocks. But the task is
complicated because the faults
are underwater.
He said aftershocks measur
ing up to about 3.0 on the Rich
ter scale will probably continue
for "a day or so and they will die
down gradually after that."
Many of those injured during
the 30-second jolt were cut by
flying glass and tumbling dishes,
police said. Others suffered
twisted ankles and similar in
juries while rushing from their
homes.
The Coleta Valley Community
Hospital said four earthquake
victims were hospitalized over
night. Two of them — one with a
dislocated neck and another
with a fractured back — were re
leased yesterday, a spokeswo
man said. The two still in the
hospital yesterday included a
burn victim and a heart attack
patient, she said. Both were
listed in stable condition.
Electric, gas and water lines
were severed as the ground
shifted and twisted but most of
the utilities were restored by
yesterday morning.
"For the most part, it's all back
in operation," said Santa Bar
bara County Sheriff's Deputy
Richard Hansen. "We're pretty
much back to normal. . . .There
are still a couple of gas lines that
have to be repaired, but the gas
was shut off and there were no
leaks," Hansen said.
The Ward Memorial overpass
over the Highway 101 freeway,
the main road into the UC Santa
Barbara campus, remained
closed because of concrete sep
arations of up to two inches. San
Marcos Pass along Highway 154
remained closed because of
rock slides.
Much of the damage was cen
tered in the Goleta area north of
Santa Barbara, where several
mobile home parks were espe
cially hard hit.
