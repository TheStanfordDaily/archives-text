# Israel postpones Jordan outposts

Tel Aviv (AP) — The Israeli
Cabinet, fearing damage to next
month's Mideast peace talks at
Camp David, shelved a plan yes
terday to build five new Jewish
outposts in the occupied West
Bank of the Jordan River at least
until after the summit.
The Cabinet planned the new
Jordan Valley settlements in a
meeting June 28, but by sitting as
the Ministerial Defense Com
mittee it clamped a lid of secrecy
and military censorship on its
decision.
After weeks of rumors, Israeli
state radio on Sunday reported
that such a decision had been
taken and a government
spokesman confirmed it Sunday
night. Sixteen hours after the
confirmation, Cabinet Secretary
Arieh Noar announced the sus

pension of the plans.
"The government decided to
discuss the matter after the
Camp David meeting," Naor
told reporters after the Cabinet
met in Jerusalem.
President Jimmy Carter, trying
to rekindle flickering peace
hopes, has invited Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
to a summit at his retreat in
Camp David, Md., Sept. 5.
Israeli ministers indicated the
government could again change
its mind, depending on the out
come of the summit. But the
swift Cabinet shift — coming be
fore either Washington or Cairo
had a chance to react officially —
indicated Israel's sensitivity to its

Washington sees Israel's more
than 100 civilian and military en

Gaza Strip, Sinai and the Golan
Heights as obstacles to peace.
Egypt demands they be disman

settlements could have under
mined the Camp David talks
even before they began.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance

told reporters yesterday that
Washington had been in touch
with Jerusalem on the settle
ments quesiton. But he refused
to comment on the events of the
past two days. Other officials
said privately that a public re
statement of the U.S. attitude
could lead to inflammatory
headlines and needlessly strain
U.S. relations with Israel.
Deputy Prime Minister Yigael
Yadin, who led the Cabinet
meeting in the absence of the
vacationing Begin, said that on
June 28 he "blocked" the origi
nal decision by asking that it be
taken up again by the Cabinet.
"This was before anyone even
knew about Camp David," Yadin
said in a state radio interview. He
said his Democratic Movement
for Change Party, a minority
member of Begin's right-wing
coalition, favors a buildup of Is
raeli positions in the Jordan Val
ley.
