## Political prisoner 
### 
Maybe Andrew Young was right after all. Myron Farber,
the New York Times reporter who investigated the Dr. X
murders and played a crucial part in prompting the re
opening of the police investigation into the murders, is now
in jail. Regardless of any possibly unethical and self-serving
actions he took after the investigation the plight of Myron
Farber still symbolizes the growing hostility the courts in this
country hold toward the press.
Farber is no martyr to his profession and fully deserves the
full support of its while sacrificing his freedom for a princi
ple dear to his heart and the hearts of all those pledged to
provide the public with the information they expect to re
ceive through the media.
And the Times fully realizes this; it has not left Farber to
the prison guards but is still fighting his most worthy cause.
The $5000 a day fine and $100,000 initial fine are fortunately,
sacrifices the Times can make. But the Times knows most
other newsgathering organizations could not think of pay
ing such a fine and would be unable to fight for everyone's
freedom. So the Times is shouldering the burden just as the
Daily shouldered the burden of fighting to protect news
offices from surprise police searches.
The price must be paid. The Daily has paid it, the Times is
paying it and Myron Farber is paying it. He is a prisoner of a
system which allowed him to believe he was free to pursue
the truth. He did just that and now sits in a New Jersey jail
cell. A political prisoner if one exists in this country.
