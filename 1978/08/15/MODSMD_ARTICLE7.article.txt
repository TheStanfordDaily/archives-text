# Energy crisis requires fresh solutions

In the lobby of the Thermosciences
building there is a stack of copies of an
interview with John McKetta, described
therein as "among the country's most
qualified spokesmen on the subjects of
energy and environment." The article,
published in the Wall Street Journal, is
entitled: "The Energy Crisis: Why the
country is over a barrel and what you can
do about it."
The first part is a harsh statement of the
tragic energy situation in the United
States: a growing rate of imported oil
(now over 45 percent) at increasing costs
— enough to create a most severe reces
sion by 1985 if no drastic steps are taken
now; predictions of U.S. energy demand
for 1985 which continue to spiral upward
while predictions of U.S. energy produc
tion plunge downward; and fuel prices
artificially maintained at a low level so
that no incentives exist for the utility
companies to prospect for new reserves
or for the consumer to switch to solar
energy.
Granted, there is no question that the
situation is tragic and must be changed
now. Prices must be brought back to
their free market level — if one's energy
bill is three times greater, one will cer
tainly start thinking seriously about insu
lation and leaving one's car in the garage
when visiting a friend down the block!
However, I strongly disagree with the
list of solutions proposed by McKetta to
fill the gap between supply and demand:
—Become "reasonable" and eliminate
some of the environmental regulations
which limit the production of coal or the
growth of nuclear energy.
—We must triple our production of
coal by the year 1985.
—"We have no choice but to concen
trate our efforts on hydrocarbons, espe
cially oil and gas, until other sources of
energy are able to share the load, proba
bly around the year 2000."
The trouble is that with all funds going
to nuclear and hydrocarbon energy, the

year 2000 is an optimistic estimate for
alternative sources of energy! Sorry,
folks, but I won't wait that long to switch
to solar energy.
—"We should declare a moratorium
on automotive catalytic converters and
exhaust gas recirculation devices, except
in a few cities with special environment
problems, and put lead back into
gasoline so that we return to more effi
cient engines."
Now this is too much! What about the
simple idea of requiring smaller cars
(which consume less, pollute less and
are less energy intensive to build) and
organizing a much more efficient public
transportation network?
Last week, it took me exactly three
hours to go by bus from Stanford to Ber
keley. While in Berkeley I could not find
a map of the bus routes. (Posting maps in
the streets would probably increase the
popularity of public transportation.) I got
misdirected by a bus driver and ended up
walking two miles. Certainly an experi
ence which would make one stick to
one's car!
McKetta bases his energy policy re
commendations on the assumption that
consumption figures until 1985 can be
extrapolated from the figures of present
and past years. With a very high figure for
the 1985 energy demand he can justify his
recommendation on the need to in
crease the production of fossil fuels
(coal, oil, gas). The effect of energy con
servation measures is completely neg
lected.
Yet, the 1974 Ford Foundation study,
"A Time to Choose," concluded that if
we combine a variety of energy conserva
tion strategies, our energy growth can be
trimmed to about 2 percent a year or, in
time, to zero without adversely affecting
the economy.
Extrapolating from the past to predict
the future is an implicit statement that it
is all right to continue to consume in the
future in the same crazy way as in the

past!
Nothing is said in the article about the
need to change the structure of U.S.
energy consumption. Forms of energy
must be adapted to their end uses. Elec
tricity, for instance, should not be used
to heat a house: to deliver one'unit of
electrical energy the power plant must
"burn" three units of fossil fuel energy.
Thus, when you heat your house with
electricity you consume, in fact, three
times more energy than if you were heat
ing it directly with fossil fuel. Some 28.8
percent of the U.S. energy consumption
is in the form of electricity, and recent
studies have shown that only 8 percent is
justified (for lights, machines, engines).
Thirty-five percent of all energy used is
in the form of heat at less than 210 de
grees fahrenheit. At these low tempera
tures, heat can easily be supplied by con
servation measures, heat reprocessing
— and the sun.
Twenty-two percent of all energy used
is for heating and cooling homes and of
fices. With widespread energy conserva
tion and use of solar energy encouraged
by drastic tax incentives, this number can
easily and economically be reduced by
one-half.
With a wiser use of energy and the
savings generated by energy conserva
tion, nuclear energy ceases to appear
necessary. Today it helps alleviate only 3
percent of the consumption of non
renewable fuels, a very small number
compared to what could be saved with
energy conservation.
Of course, there are people who,
when they think solar, imagine an intri
cate diagram of pumps, check valves,
vacuum breakers, heat exchangers,
back-up furnaces, collectors with freeze
protection, etc.
No, solar energy does not need to be
so complex; it is made simple and effec
tive to orient a house properly: to have
south facing windows insulated by shut
ters at night; to pour a bit more concrete

in the floor for thermal mass; or to add to
the south side a beautiful greenhouse
which would heat the house in the winter
and would provide vegetables to feed
the family.
And, of course, there are insulation
and weather-stripping which pay for
themselves in less than a year.
There are people like Harold Hay, who
put water bags on top of his flat roof, in
Atascadero, Calif. A temperature of 70
degrees is maintained all year round
without any back-up furnace. There is
Steve Baerwho is heatingand coolinghis
house of New Mexico with water drums,
painted black and stacked to form a
south wall.
There are people everywhere — not
even scientists — who are proving that
solar energy is feasible NOW.
Solar energy is not a new idea.
Iranian architects more than 3000 years
ago, designed complex domes which
cooled theirbuildings by creating special
air movements, used evaporative cool
ing, and made from 900 AD ice in the
middle of the summer (by using night
time radiation cooling).
The country is over a barrel and we
must do something about it. But there
are clearly two paths: the first one is to
continue consuming blindly; wasting
energy and relying on scientists to solve
the energy crisis. The other one is to in
dividually become involved in the solu
tion of the crisis by conserving energy
and by using small-scale energy systems
(solar collectors, wind generators, any
thing which harvests a renewable source
of energy) as much as possible. This last
path leads to a greater understanding of
Nature and to better control of our own
lives. Which path would you like to fol
low?
