Brussels, Belgium (AP) — Ten
years after the Soviet invasion
that crushed Czechoslovakia's
brief experiment in liberaliza
tion and took NATO intelligence
by surprise, the 15-nation West
ern defense bloc is finishing an
overhaul aimed at making sure it
isn't caught napping again.
Improved intelligence and
communications, crisis man
agement exercises and better
cooperation among member na
tions are designed to make the
alliance more alert than it was
just before midnight Aug. 20,
1968 when Warsaw Pact troops
rolled into Czechoslavakia.
But NATO still suffers from an
assortment of inefficiencies, in
cluding its need forls-way polit
ical consultation in an
emergency and disparities
among its member armed

forces. Some of these problems
are under study in a "long-term
defense program" for the 1980s.
But others may never be solved
for fear of compromising the in
dependence of member na
tions.
NATO military men for
months had monitored the
Soviet and Warsaw Pact man
euvers near Czechoslovakia that
underlined Soviet displeasure
with the liberal government of
Alexander Dubcek.
When it did happen, the
Soviets scored what American
Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, then
commander of NATO forces,
admitted was a "tactical sur
prise."
In many cases, press reports
of the invasion moved faster
than NATO's own intelligence
and communications.

Once some member coun
treis began receiving informa
tion from their own intelligence
sources, they did not share it
with the alliance for the use of all
member countries. As a result,
NATO officials say, it took 24
hours — until evening on Aug.
21 — for NATO intelligence ex
perts to assemble a cohesive pic
ture of what was happening.
Meanwhile, NATO did noiuse
the information it finally re
ceived on the invasion to make
tentative military preparations
of its own. As 300,000 Warsaw
Pact troops stood in readiness
just across borders from NATO
countries, there was no im
mediate move to put the NATO
armies on alert.
The invasion, which impre
ssed NATO officials with the
Warsaw Pact's ability to mount a
large operation in almost total
secrecy, led to a re-thinking of
NATO's preparations for a sud
den crisis.
The alliance's communica
tions system has been upgraded
sharply and now includes three
communications satellites, with
an expanded voice system in the
works.
