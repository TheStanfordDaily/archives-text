# Renter crusade underway

### Bob Rudy 
Battle lines are being drawn in
what is rapidly becoming the
most volatile of the many post-
Prop. 13 issues: rent relief.
Throughout numerous Noth
ern California communities ten
ants groups have been circulat
ing petitions to get a ren; relief
intiative placed on the Nov. 7
ballot in their areas. For their
part, landlord organizations
have been appealing to their re
spective city councils with alter
native proposals of their own.
Among the several cities that
are considering a variety of rent
reduction ordinances for the Fall
election are San Francisco, Oak
land, Berkeley, Davis, Mountain
View and Palo Alto.
Last Monday night, the Palo
Alto City Council voted unanim
ously to place a "renters" initia
tive on the ballot. The proposal,
presented by the Palo Alto Citi
zens for Rent Relief, was the re
sult of a petition drive that got
over 5700 signatures.
The proposal, if passed,
would provide for rent reduc
tions during 1979 to match the
amount of property tax saved by
landlords under Prop. 13. Land
lords would be able to raise
rents only to offset their own in
creased operating costs and to
receive a "just and reasonable
return" on their investments.
According to Bob Moss, a

member of the Palo Alto Citizens
for Rent Relief, this could mean
as much as $4.4 billion being re
cycled into the local economy.
By a 4 to 4 vote, the council
also decided to leave a
landlord-backed proposal off
the ballot. That plan called for a
rent freeze for the last six
months of this year with renters
getting refunds of anything
charged over and above the rent
they were charged before June
6.
Renters would continue to re
ceive rebate payments equal to
the landlords' tax savings for the
next two years. There would,
however, be no restriction on
the amount of rent landlords
could charge after Jan. 1, 1979.
Proponents of each proposal
called the other's measure "rent
control."
Heading the landlord group is
Gary Grant, director of the Palo
Alto Citizens for Renters Tax Re
bates. Regarding Monday's
council meeting he said, "Quite
frankly, I am dismayed. I had
hoped that they (the council)
would have given voters a
choice." Grant stated that his
group will actively oppose the
renters initiative by waging an ad
campaign through the mail.
In a similar situation, the
Mountain View City Council will
hold a special meeting next

Monday to decide the future of
two rent relief proposals there.
One, presented by the Moun
tain View Citizens for Rent Relief
(which got over 5000 petition
signatures), requires landlords
to rebate Prop. 13 tax savings to
tenants. It permits rent increases
only for documentable in
creased costs actually paid by
landlords.
A landlord-supported plan,
much like its counterpart mea
sure in Palo Alto, will also be
considered.
Both the Palo Alto and Moun
tain View city councils also have
the option of presenting their
own ordinances that, according
to various council members,
would combine features of both
tenant and landlord proposals.
Such a measure would be consi
dered in a special election some
time after Nov. 7.
According to Moss of the
PACRR, an election of this sort
would cost taxpayers at least
$15,000and is not likely to occur.
Meanwhile, in Sacramento
the Legislature is considering
two rent reduction bills of its
own. A tenant-oriented bill is
being offered by Assemblyman
Tom Bates (D-Oakland). It, too,
requires landlords to share their
tax savings and to give clear

Among other liberal causes, Palo Alto Citizens for Renter Relief oc
cupies a smaller office than its political strength justifies. All around the
Bay, renters are pressing for Prop. 13 relief.
