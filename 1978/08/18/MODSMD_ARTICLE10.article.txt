# Voters to decide on shield laws
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Califor
nians will vote on whether re
porters should have the con
stitutional right to refuse to dis
close their news sources to
judges undera measure winning
final passage yesterday.
The state Senate, reversing an
earlier decision, approved a
constitutional amendment that
would put the so-called repor
ters' "shield law" into the state
constitution.
The action sent the amend
ment, ACA 4, to voters for their
consideration, but it was uncer
tain whether it would go on the
November ballot or the June bal
lot in 1980.
A bill extending the deadline
for November ballot measures
until Friday was killed for a sec
ond time by the Senate yester
day, but some extension mea
sure could still be approved in
the next few days.
Yesterday's 27-6 vote on the
reporter measure was the bare
two-thirds majority needed for
passage. The amendment fell
four votes short of approval in
May, but supporters were given
permission to bring it up again.
The amendment was intro
duced by Assemblyman Jerry
Lewis (R-Highland), following
two highly publicized cases in
which newsmen in Los Angeles
and Fresno were jailed for refus
ing to divulge sources.
State law currently prohibits
reporters from being held in

contempt of court for keeping
sources secret, but some judges
have ignored that provision.
Those actions set off a debate
over whether the shield law
should take precedence over
such provisions as the right of
courts to control their proceed
ings and to insure a fair trial.
In both the Los Angeles and
Fresno cases, attorneys or court
officials were suspected of leak
ing information to reporters in
violation of court orders.
Lewis' amendment would ele
vate the shield law to a constitu
tional provision, a move suppor
ters hope will force judges to
consider it on an equal basis
with other constitutional rights.
Lack of such a shield, they
said, would dry up news sources
and cripple reporters' efforts to
keep the public informed.
