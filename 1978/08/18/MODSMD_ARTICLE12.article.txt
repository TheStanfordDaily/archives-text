# Cheerleading-more than just vocal cords

We've got spirit yes we do!
We've got spirit how 'bout you?
Stanford residents that are
awakened to this cheer at 8 a.m.
may question their own spirit
but no one can doubt the en
thusiasm of the 459 cheer and
song leaders attending the
CADA/NCA camps at Stanford
this summer.
These young men and women
come from high schools all over
California to learn cheer and
song leading techniques and
leadership ability. This week's
camp was the second session at
Stanford. Similar camps are held
throughout the state. Each ses
sion lasts five days and costs
every participant $75.
CADA, the California Associa
tion of Directors of Activities, is
composed of teachers from var
ious schools who are intersted in
student leadership. Several
years ago, CADA noticed many
cheerleading camps were
geared to turning out entertain
ers rather than student leaders.
Through the combined efforts of
CADA and the National Cheer
leaders Assocation (NCA) the
CADA camps were formed. The
NCA instructors teach chants,
cheers, songs and stunts and
CADA teaches the students to
related well within the group, to

set goals and to become effec
tive leaders within their schools.
The cheer and song leaders
come to Stanford in their school
squads. "We spend a lot
of time together," said
Lia Keller a J.V. cheerleader at
McClatchy High in Sacramento.
"It's great we get to know each
other much better." "But we
also meet a lot of new people"
added Maria Swensson. "We are
divided into big groups with the
other squads and then we have
mock pep rallys."
When asked how they liked
Stanford one of the girls replied
"It's nice but they work us so
hard I haven't even seen the
bookstore." The squads must be
at breakfast by 7 a.m. then at
tend classes on chants, cheers
and stunts until lunch.
"We get an hour for meals and
only 45 minutes of free time the
whole day," said one spirited
young lady.
Afternoons and even
ings are devoted to evaluating
the cheers learned during the
morningsand to sessions on pep
rallys, intersquad relations and
leadership training. "They teach
us everything — spirit sharp
ness, millions of chants — and
we have awards. We get a spirit
award!" said )ane Mikachich.
Then she added "It's a lot of fun,

but real tiring."
"Sure we work them hard, we
want to teach them everything"
said Kathy McTigh a second-year
instructor for NCA. "They learn
how to work together. They be
come very close." Most of the
instructors arecollege cheerand
song leaders. Some cheer for
professional football teams.
They spend the summer travel
ing throughout California from
camp to camp. "
For most Stanford students
the cheerleaders are a change
from the Cardinal Dollies and
Athletic Supporters. "They're a
throw-back from my high school
days" commented one student.
But Ray Bukaty an R.A. in Wilbur
had a different opinion. "I hate
cheerleaders! They yell about
everything, their blow dryers
sound like a herd of elephants
and I can't take 'Let' roll 'em over
DE-FENSE' at 7 in the morning."
For the casual on-looker,
however the lively vocal group
of high schoolers are a lot of fun.
And they certainly liven up Dead
Week.
