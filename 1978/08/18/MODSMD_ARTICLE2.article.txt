# State claims hospital deficiencies
## 
### John Nielsen 
A California Department of
Health Survey of the Stanford
Hospital's facilities, undertaken
in conjunction with a recently
completed acccreditation pro
cess, has resulted in the is
suance of what that department
calls a "better than average" list
of deficiencies here.
Though under new state law
Title 22 permits to operate the
outpatient, coronary care, in
tensive care and newborn
intensive care services had
to be withheld pending the ac
ceptance of a hospital plan to
correct space and organizational
deficiencies found during the
department's survey in April,
hospital administrator Gary
Mecklenburg viewed the report

as "a positive one," adding that
he saw "no problem wihh licens
ing of the services."
Some 22 deficiencies were
noted in the Department of
Health report, including shor
tages of space in the newborn
intensive care and intensive care
units and failure to comply with
a requirement that all patients
practicing in Stanford's outpa
tient clinics be members of the
hospital medical staff, which
would give them the power to
admit patients to the hospital.
Mecklenberg said that he
could not see the hospital losing
its license, as Stanford has al
ready announced plans to re
model its intensive care nursery,
and has indicated to the Health

Department that it would take
action to fully comply with its
requirements.
When asked to explain how a
list of deficiencies could be seen
as "a positive one," Mecklen
berg said that "I think you have
to consider that hospital codes
and laws are constantly chang
ing," and that Title 22 was "like a
paperback novel with small
type." University Medical
Center News Bureau adminis
trator Bill Snyder added that
"every time a survey team comes
in you have to apply standards of
new laws — even if the hospital
functions well it may not meet
with the new law."
Snyder said that the basic
problem was one of providing
up-to-date services in a physical

plant which doesn't lend itself to
expansion. Stanford Hospital
was built 20 years ago. Cuy Sea
ton, health facilities evaluator at
San Jose, said that other hospi
tals in the area have encoun
tered similar difficulties in
space, and are planning their
own building projects.
Under Title 22 the coronary
care, intensive care, intensive
care and nursery services will
require remodeling. When
asked how long the remodeling
would take, Snyder said that
"we're talking in a matter of
years, but not a tremendously
long time."
The Hospital was recently
granted a full two-year accredita
tion.
