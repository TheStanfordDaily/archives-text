## Theater/karen caesar Show not so fantastick 
### 
Just yesterday,"The Fantas
ticks" did its 7603 rd perfor
mance on Broadway. It is a sim
ple little play, about a boy and a
girl who live next door to each
other and fall in love. It has
lovely music ("Try To Re
member, "Soon It's Gonna
Rain," "Much More," etc.) and
minimal dancing and almost no
scenery or props. It is unpreten
tious and uncomplicated, a
guaranteed crowd-pleaser.
Perhaps this is why it has been
running almost continuously for
about 17 years, and why high
school drama classes and col
lege dormitories feel safe with it.
You can't lose.
But there are Exceptions, and
an Exception is running now at
the Cannery Theater in San
Francisco. The show is stiff and
awkward where it should be
easy and natural, its performers
are capable but lack the neces
sary panache, and at times the
whole production crawls along
at an unbearably s-l-o-w pace.
Chin tucked
Why? Because the direction is
uneven and because sometimes
the actors appear uncertain of
their purpose. Stephen Bradley
as El Gallo, the Narrator, has a
deep and resonant voice which
is pleasing to the ear but which

requires him to keep his chin
tucked in at all times, which is
not pleasing to the eye. He also
has a peculiar delivery and a
slightly maniacal gleam in his
eye. He is self-conscious, more
like an anchor man than a nar
rator, more concerned about
keeping his chin tucked and his
swagger in the right .gear than
about telling a simple story of a
simple love.
As The Girl, Beth Ann Erin is all
bubbles and breathy giggles
which are appropriate but wear
thin after a very short time. Her
voice, too, is unsteady; in some
numbers her soprano soars; in
others, it wavers precariously
and falls flat.
Richard Atchison as The Boy is
the undisputed star of "The Fan
tasticks." He has just the right
mixture of bubbles and
backbone to be a believable
human being. His voice is strong
and sure — what he sings he
sings perfectly. A better Boy
could exist only in your imagina
tion — and maybe not even
there. But'unfortunately, not
even his considerable talent can
save the production.
Mass hysteria
When this show was done in
Toyon Hall two and a half years
ago, there was mass hysteria at
some of the Fathers' antics. But
Morgan Upton as the Boy's
Fatherand jim Beam as the Girls'
father were immensely disap
pointing. At the Cannery show,
the audience could barely crack
a smile. The gentlemen said
what they were supposed to say
and sung well enough, but
didn't ham it up in the irresista
ble, unaffected manner which
imbues the play with so much

charm.
Speaking of ham, Drew
Eshelman as The Actor and
Daniel Timothy Johnson as The
Man Who Dies (they appear in a
skit invented to bring The Girl
and The Boy together forever)
are so obnoxiously long-winded
and slapshticky, they are
enough to make me want my
money back, and I didn't even
pay to see the show. Any time
they are on stage, the play slows
from a comfortable trot to a dead
(and I mean dead) halt. Laundry,
relatives, even past dentist ap
pointments are worthier things
to think about than those two
childish goons romping on
stage.
Camp pic
But the actors are not totally at
fault. Director David Cryer has
contributed by maneuvering
them in an extremely unnatural
fashion. For instance, the very
first scene begins with the actors
meandering onto the stage and
finally assembling themselves as
if they are posing for a camp pic -
ture. After staring at the audi
ence for at least a minute, tl
Gallo, chin tucked, suddenly
bursts into "Try To Remember,"
and the audience bursts into
bewildered laughter because it
all comes as such a surprise, and
looks and sounds so absurd.
Which sums up the basic
problem with "The Fantasticks.'
Too much of it is strained,
mechanical and downright
peculiar. There's too much that
is unintentionally funny, too
many stupid little things to pick
on that keep the show from flow
ing swiftly and the audience
from paying close attention.
Your high school probably put
on a better show.
