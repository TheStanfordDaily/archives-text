## 'Vanities'-required viewing 
### 
Because they are so entertaining, you can al
most forget what a conventional bunch the
characters in "Vanities" are. They're the girls in
high school that everyone was supposed to ad
mire, but secretly despised — the peppy cheer
leaders who always wore tiie right clothes and
could always repeat a nasty rumor about the
trashy girls who let the boys have what they
wanted.
You probably know the types, joanne is the one
who typically buckles her face in a self
deprecating look, certain that she must be uglier
or stupider than her buddies. "One of us has got
to be Queen of the Prom," she coos, "and I sure
hope one of you win."
Kathy is the sassy one, so advanced in her at
titudes that she yawns at parental restrictions.
And Mary is the organizer, the planner, the one
with an inexhaustible repertory of themes for
dances and rallies — at homecoming everyone
will be singing "Over the Rainbow" and eating
rainbow sherbert.
Odd thing
The odd thing is, as loanne, Kathy and Mary
joke and gossip and conspire together, they be
come likeable, if not as real people then at least
as stage characters. That's because they're played
— by Nancy Palmer Jones, Deena Freeman and

Kate Kiley respectively — with such bumptious
energy, and with a mercilessly accurate eye for
the endearing little hypocrisies which we all
share. The girls aren't mean, just effectively
brainwashed into smug conformity.
"Vanities" is set in three scenes, each one
sketching a moment of meeting and transition for
these three girls. When we first see them in a high
school locker room in 1963, they're as alike as
triplets hatched from the same egg. In college
four years later, they think mostly about boys and
sororities; Vietnam is a place where you don't
want your boyfriends to wind up. Joanne has be
come more conservative, Mary is more unsure of
things and Kathy doesn't give a damn in general.
But for the most part, no one talks about anything
of substance, and no one mentions differences or
disagreements, because they've always been
friends and will always remain friends. They swear
it.
Watching them carry on, you can't help longing
forsome wrench to come flyinginto the works, to
smash their insular little world.
Crab dip
And in the last scene, that wrench strikes,
hurled by none other than the girls themselves. In
the course of a disastrous reunion party in 1974,
