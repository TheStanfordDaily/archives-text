## Heroic hilarity 
### 
Our present age is too shal
low, complex, materialistic and
mundane for our human sen
sibilities. With its inflation, re
cession, politics and cruise
missiles, our world has driven us
to seek escape. That escape can
be in comic books, late-night
cheap novels, or perhaps relig
ion. We don't want to quit our
world permanently, we just want
to visit a place where it is once
again easy to tell right from
wrong and good from evil, find
adventure and romance and
know both exalted beauty and
extreme hideousness. Such a
brief sojourn into fantasy re
stores our perspective and re
news our confidence and capac
tiy to deal rationally with our dis
concerted, precarious emo
tional situations. It is good for us
to seek such havens of the im
agination once in a while, even if
it's only to laugh our heads off.
The Hippodrome Theatre/
Restaurant on Broadway in San
Francisco has offered such an
escape for the past three years in
the form of "Bullshot Crum
mond." The production is the
progeny of a comedy revue
group called Low Moan Spec
tacular Productions. Besides
their present project, they sired
"El Grande de Coca Cola" which
ran in New York for two and a
half years and will soon be a mo
tion picture.
Hero
"Bullshot Crummond" is a
hilariously heavy-handed spoof
of Bulldog Drummond, Britain's
hero of comixs, novels and a
cycle of movies in the 20's and
30's. Like the original hero,
Crummond is a match for any
Turk in strength, any Gurka in
fighting spirit and any German in
cunning. He has steely eyes,
iron fists, golden virtue and a
stiff upper-lip. He also has a
damsel in distress and an arch
enemy. And that, plus a pro
fessor's secret formula, is all
there is and need be of a plot.
The play runs roughshod
over every adventure story con
vention and British mannerism
in its path. There are a couple of
hair-breadth escapes with in
volved explanations that are as
masterful and inventive as any
penned by A. Conan Doyle.
Besides Crummond (Cab
Covay) there is Rosemary Fen
ton (Nancy Leehan) who is prim,
pretty and pink. She has the
comedic distinction of being
able to blush and start a laugh

which goes from cute to embar
rassing to grotesque in a period
of a minute and a half. There is
also the vile genius of Baron
Otto von Bruno, a hard-bitten
Prussian who is "the second
most dangerous man in
Europe," and his seductive assis
tant Lenya (Victoria Thatcher)
who is a satin-draped compo
site of Mata Hari and Bullwink
le's Natasha. The five person
cast is completed by Mark
Blankfield, who portrays seven
supporting characters.
Miniature triumph
The entire production is a
triumph of miniaturization. Be
sides the tiny cast there is a set
designed by Mary Moore which,
though compact, handily man
ages to become seven locations.
Through the use of scale mod
els, quick changes and snappy
direction, the set and stars con
vincingly portray bi-planes,
dreadnoughts, car chases and
cliff-top escapes.
While consistently entertain
ing and often very, very funny,
"Crummond" does have its
problems. So much of its impact
is in the parodic realm of exagg
eration that the actors are often
overly melodramatic and the re
sult is sloppy pacing and some
hams that deserve Armour stars.
This is the fault of both a script
that relies too heavily on parody
rather than originality, and lax
directing.
There are also times when
truly fine opportunities for wit
and cleverness are abandoned
for an easy slapstick chuckle. A
couple of gratuitous sex gags
may spoil the evening for some.
At one point, Crummond ap
pears on stage in a bathing outfit
that includes a gargantuan cod
piece. The effect brings some of
the predictable guffaws but is
still as disgusting to one portion
of the audience as it is de
moralizing to another.
On the whole, "Bullshot
Crummond" is an ingenious di
version which, though often a
bit trying, makes for an enter
taining escape into a hilarious
region of fantasy.

Restaurant on Broadway in San
Francisco has offered such an
escape for the past three years in
the form of "Bullshot Crum
mond." The production is the
progeny of a comedy revue
group called Low Moan Spec
tacular Productions. Besides
their present project, they sired
"El Grande de Coca Cola" which
ran in New York for two and a
half years and will soon be a mo
tion picture.
Hero
"Bullshot Crummond" is a
hilariously heavy-handed spoof
of Bulldog Drummond, Britain's
hero of comixs, novels and a
cycle of movies in the 20's and
30's. Like the original hero,
Crummond is a match for any
Turk in strength, any Gurka in
fighting spirit and any German in
cunning. He has steely eyes,
iron fists, golden virtue and a
stiff upper-lip. He also has a
damsel in distress and an arch
enemy. And that, plus a pro
fessor's secret formula, is all
there is and need be of a plot.
The play runs roughshod
over every adventure story con
vention and British mannerism
in its path. There are a couple of
hair-breadth escapes with in
volved explanations that are as
masterful and inventive as any
penned by A. Conan Doyle.
Besides Crummond (Cab
Covay) there is Rosemary Fen
ton (Nancy Leehan) who is prim,
pretty and pink. She has the
comedic distinction of being
able to blush and start a laugh

which goes from cute to embar
rassing to grotesque in a period
of a minute and a half. There is
also the vile genius of Baron
Otto von Bruno, a hard-bitten
Prussian who is "the second
most dangerous man in
Europe," and his seductive assis
tant Lenya (Victoria Thatcher)
who is a satin-draped compo
site of Mata Hari and Bullwink
le's Natasha. The five person
cast is completed by Mark
Blankfield, who portrays seven
supporting characters.
Miniature triumph
The entire production is a
triumph of miniaturization. Be
sides the tiny cast there is a set
designed by Mary Moore which,
though compact, handily man
ages to become seven locations.
Through the use of scale mod
els, quick changes and snappy
direction, the set and stars con
vincingly portray bi-planes,
dreadnoughts, car chases and
cliff-top escapes.
While consistently entertain
ing and often very, very funny,
"Crummond" does have its
problems. So much of its impact
is in the parodic realm of exagg
eration that the actors are often
overly melodramatic and the re
sult is sloppy pacing and some
hams that deserve Armour stars.
This is the fault of both a script
that relies too heavily on parody
rather than originality, and lax
directing.
There are also times when
truly fine opportunities for wit
and cleverness are abandoned
for an easy slapstick chuckle. A
couple of gratuitous sex gags
may spoil the evening for some.
At one point, Crummond ap
pears on stage in a bathing outfit
that includes a gargantuan cod
piece. The effect brings some of
the predictable guffaws but is
still as disgusting to one portion
of the audience as it is de
moralizing to another.
On the whole, "Bullshot
Crummond" is an ingenious di
version which, though often a
bit trying, makes for an enter
taining escape into a hilarious
region of fantasy.
