Madame Rosa ★ ★★★
Aquarius
lust what anyone who has never
seen a foreign film wold expect a
foreign film to be like. Beautifully
acted, with moments of great poig
nancy; also badly edited and heavy on
the pathos. Simone Signoret makes
the film worthwhile with her perfor
mance as an aging whore — she easily
overcomes the occasionally dumb
dialogue, and often provides humor
at unexpected moments With Dear
Detective."

Star Wars ★★★
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly entertain
ing and wildly visual 2i wildly enter
taining and stunningly visual !) the
kind of movie nobody makes any
more. On second thought it's delib
erately anesthetic , little more than the
financial successor to laws fxcept
for Alec Guiness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls, or escapees from
episodes of Lassie: though Lucas is to
be praised for avoiding the asinine
political commentary implicit in
things like "Rollerball and "Logan s

Run" his decision to center the ac tion
around the aformentioned members
of the Pepsi Generation rankles and
irks and peeves. True "2001" tans in
sist that for all its visual achievements
"Star Wars" is really very bland —
even though I still don't know what
the hell was going on in Kubrick's
movie I am tempted to agree.

Dear Detective
Aquarius
A murder mystery. A comedy. A
romance. French Distinguishable

from grade-B American formulas by a
French t harm infused by director Phil
lipe De Broca, the creative genius re
sponsible for the classic "King of
Hearts." Standard motifs are given
non-standard ironic twists, but it is
difficult at times to distinguish bet
ween formula and parody, between
the assumptions the director shares
with society and the ones he is mock
ing. The leads, though, are consis
tantly good; the direction never lags;
the cinematography is a constant joy.
A murder that is a real mystery and a
romance that is a real comedy —
sometimes the two conflict, but for
the most part the picture works well.
With "Madame Rosa."

Animal House
Old Mill 6
Sometimes (unfortunately) seeing
this movie is like reading an entire
copy of "National Lampoon" in one
sitting. At other times (fortunately)
seeing this movie is like reading an
entire copy of "National Lampoon" in
one sitting. Nearly every kind of funny
you could hope for a movie to be, and
this is not entirely good, but who
cares? "Animal House," after all, is
the movie with lohn Belushi in it. As
the Grendel of Faber College's Delta
House, Belushi is nothing less than
perfect, as he alone is able to put ev
erything around him to use. The
chaos in this picture sloshes around in
Belushi's huge beer belly and boils up

into the stubble on his tace — his
warped brilliance makes this uncen
tered movie worth more than a few
rereadings.

Eyes of Laura Mars
Bijou
A movie of endless incongruities.
Starring Faye Dunaway, the famous
actress, as Laura Mars, the famous
fashion photographer. Laura Mars
sells pictures by using sex and vio
lence as themes — her life becomes a
nightmare when art becomes reality
and her associates are murdered one
by one. But there is an incomprehen
sible inconsistency between Laura
Mars' profession and her personality,
and it doesn't help to give non
treatment to the protagonists' pen
chant for precognition. "Laura Mars"
is a potentially interesting character,
but she is unexplored by either direc
tor (Irven Kershner) or actress (Duna
way). Some visual appeal, but the
slow pace, flat dialogue and heavy
handed musical score do "Laura
Mars" in in the end,

The Magic Flute
New Varsity
Friday, August 1H
By all rights a German opera trans
lated into Swedish, made into a film,
and given English subtitles ought to
be a mess! On the contrary, "The
Magic Flute" is a very simple, and
honest tribute to Mozart and his op
era. Bergman has captured the charm
of an actual stage production by show
ing the stage, scenery and scene
changes of a real opera. The camera
seems to do exactly what your eyes
would do, a glance at the set, a ga/e at
the players, and an occasional
glimpse of the rest of the audience. I
must say that looking at the subtitles
might annoy some, but for those who
are even vaguely familiar with the
opera won't need to look at anything
besides the most beautiful film tribute
by one of the greatest directors to one
of the greatest composers. With "I Am
a Dancer."

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★★
Menlo
Gary Busey s upper lip and expressive
eyebrows are as fine as any in the busi
ness; his showing as Buddy Holly
makes this picture worthwhile. Busey
can sing, too, and he also is a marvel
ously idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the end he
holds it all together. "The Buddy Holly
Story could have been better, and
that's no hooey, but its hard to imagine
afiner hick superstar than the one we
got right now.
