## 'The Waterfront' offers dramatic setting

The Waterfront Restaurant
Pier 7 Embarcadero at Broadway
San Francisco
391-2696
Al Falchi has made the most of
an unusual piece of real estate.
Capitalizing on the natural
beauty and historic charm of the
City's waterfront, Falchi has
created a Waterfront' of his
own.
Huge whirling fans overhead,
a massive ship's clock in the
background and an expansive
view of the Bay in the foreg
round have transformed San
Francisco's old Broadway Pier
into a restaurant of visual dis
tinction.

From among a list of 10 ap
petizers we settled on an order
of Steamed Eastern Clams
($5.25). Served with lemon and
melted butter, the clams were
good but not fresh, something
we discovered later that evening
when we both went to bed with
uncomfortably upset stomachs.
At these prices it is not too much
to expect that only the best will
be served.
While we waited for our salads
we sipped a delicately sweet
lohannesberg Riesling from
Robert Mondavi ($7.50 a bottle)
and enjoyed the magnificent
colors of the fading sky. Against
such a backdrop we couldn't

help but feel that we had disco
vered one of the key ingredients
to the Waterfront's success.
Salads incorporate both the
traditional and the gourmet. We
tried one of each and selected
the House Salad with Shrimp
($2.25) and the small Waterfront
Salad ($2.75), an Italian delicacy
of calamari (squid) and shrimp.
An almost too-standard prep
aration of romaine lettuce a few
shrimp and Thousand Island
dressing rendered the House
Salad a 'good but not excep
tional' verdict. The Waterfront
Salad, a more exotic combination,
consisted of ample and tender
portions of calamari and shrimp

beautifully presented on a bed
of crisp greens and tossed in a
simple herb dressing. For the
first time that evening the chef
had commanded the pos
sibilities of his ingredients.
Cups of clam chowder (.50)
recommended by the maitre d'
as the "best in the City" failed to
win the same wide distinction
from us. A heavy potato base
and bland seasoning did not
make this chowder a 'best.'
Placing our confidence in the
'skill of the kitchen' and the
freshness of the catch, we opted
for something different and
chose the Abalone Almondine
($12.95) and the Waterfront

Scampi ($9.25). Although it's a
i great local specialty abalone is
rarely served properly. Delicate
f in flavor it should be thinly
sliced, pounded to translucence
and dipped in a lightly seasoned
I (marjoram or basil) egg batter.
Our particular order managed to
i survive the first two tests but was
i unfortuntely diminished by a
too-heavy egg batter and al
t mondine garnish; this was a case
where simplicity would have
; been artistry — the abalone
should have been allowed to
I stand on its own.
I The Waterfront Scampi is
rated as a specialty of the house
t along with Poached Salmon
($8.25) and Filet of Sole Floren
tine ($7.50). The firm,white meat
of eight to 10 baby lobster tails
enhanced by a liberal treatment
of garlic, leon butter, shallots
and white wine made this a rich
but well-enjoyed preparation.
Needless to say after appetiz
ers, salad, soup and an amply
portioned dinner, dessert was
hardly necessary. However
when our waiter suggested we
try Chocolate Mousse Cake we
couldn't refuse. Baked by "a lit
tle lady over in Oakland" this
dark creation of smooth and
sweet chocolate velvet was fan
tastic. As desserts are not
printed on the menu but are
presented verbally by the waiter
at the end of the meal I suggest
saving room for the unknown.
Dining at the Waterfront is ex
pensive and reflects the appeal
of a dramatic setting rather than
extraordinary cuisine. In a city
where there are at least four or
• five noteworthy seafood re
staurants within a four block
radius of Fisherman's Wharf
there are undoubtedly finer sea
food establishemnents.
