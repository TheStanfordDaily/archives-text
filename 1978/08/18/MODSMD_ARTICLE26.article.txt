# Rosebud's: theater row newcomer
## 
### 
Rosebud's English Pub
370 Geary
San Francisco
433-0183
Less than two blocks west of frantic
shoppers and Union Square pamphleteers
lies an English pub worthy of Charles Dic
kens himself. Rosebud's, one of the new
comers to theater row, has captured the
dignity and Victorian elegance of an English
gentleman's library. Dark wood and
polished brass create a stately atmosphere
and, from tiffanied lamps to tapestried
walls, the "rosebud" emblem is prevalent
throughout this grand, two-leveled restaur
ant.
The menu offers 10 entrees which pro
vide extensive coverage of fowl, fish, veal
and beef dishes. It includes such notable
dishes as Toad in the Hole (beef stew in a
pastry shell, $6.95), Crisp Duckling with
Peaches ($8.95) and Poached Fresh King
Salmon ($9.95).
After thoroughly studying the pos
sibilities, we ordered the Prime Rib ($9.95),
and the less conventional Breast of Chicken
— Tiffany ($7.95). The price of the entree
includes a choice of the daily soup or either

a spinach or house salad.
The soup-of-the-day was steak, a
slightly-seasoned blend of pureed steak
and carrots combined with lots of rich
cream. Although modest in portion, it was
quite flavorful in taste.
At the same time, my companion was
presented with fresh leaves of spinach, tos
sed in a sharp vinegar and oil dressing and
topped with crumbled bits of real bacon
and crunchy croutons. Like the soup, the
spinach salad was a pleasant introduction to
the forthcoming meal.
Adding to the Victorian atmosphere, all
food is served at pewter table settings by
waiters and waitresses in costumes suitable
to this time period.
Prime rib is the house specialty at
Rosebud's. To satisfy every beef eater's
taste, the menu boast three different cuts —
the Rosebud, the English (thinly sliced) and
the End (crusty and brown). Served still on
the bone, the Rosebud's cut was tender,
juicy and cooked to perfection.
Our other, more imaginative selection
consisted of a boned chicken breast stuffed
with bananas and Canadian bacon and
blanketed in a thick orange marmalade

sauce. I thought that the combination was
almost too exotic; perhaps, the absence of
either the bananas or the Canadian bacon
would have been an improvement here. As
it was, the flavor of the tender, white chic
ken seemed to get lost in this fruity concoc
tion.
To end our dinner, we each ordered de
ssert. Crowned with mounds of whipped
cream and sliced almonds, the English Trifle
Pudding ($1.45) had layers of strawberries
and pound cake soaked in rum. Deliciously
rich, I could finish only half of this
wickedly sweet creation. Coupe Gertrude
Lawrence ($1.35) can best be summarized as
excellent French vanilla ice cream in a
chocolate-rum sauce that did not do it jus
tice.
Accustomed to dealing with a time
pressed theater crowd, we found that
throughout our meal, the service was atten
tive and efficient, if not somewhat rushed.
Open from 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. (12:30
p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights) for
luncheon and dinner, Rosebud's offers
spectacular decor and outstanding prime
rib. With that in mind, you ought to try it!
