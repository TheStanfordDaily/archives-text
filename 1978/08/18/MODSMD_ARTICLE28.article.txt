Croatians surrender
Chicago — Two Croatian nationalists
surrendered yesterday, 10 hours after
taking eight hostages at the West Ger
man Consulate and demanding freedom
for a militant countryman imprisoned in
West Germany.
The gunmen, described by police as
"Croatian terrorists" from the Chicago
area, negotiated with consulate officials
and authorities while placing a call to the
prison in Cologne, West Germany,
where Stjepan Bilandzic was being held
awaiting possible extradition to Yugos
lavia.
Fritz Ziefer, press officer for the Ger
man Embassy in Washington, D.C., said
Bilandzic, held in Cologne, West Ger
many, was jailed for "explosive attempts
in Yugoslavia and attacks on Yugoslavian
citizens living in Germany."
Raster said Bilandzic, 39, was con
victed of attempting to murder a Yugos
lav official in Dusseldorf, Germany. Ras
ter said a death sentence issued for
Bilandzic in Yugoslavia apparently had
been commuted to life in prison.
The terrorists had said that if their de
mands were denied, they could deto
nate a bomb powerful enough to destroy
five stories of the downtown building,
which houses the consulate on the 10th
floor.
Six persons had remained captive until
the time of their surrender.
Two hostages had been released ear
lier.
Balloonists make it
WMiserey, France — Three jubilant
Americans eased the Double Eagle 11 into
a wheat field and a riotous welcome 600
yards from this farming hamlet 60 miles
west of Paris yesterday evening, com
pleting the first trans-Atlantic balloon
crossing.
Cheering crowds abandoned their
cars and rushed the balloon to congratu
late its occupants — Maxie Anderson, 44,
Ben Abruzzo, 48, and Larry Newman, 31,
all of Albuquerque, N.M. — as they
jumped from the red-and-yellow gon
dola to secure the balloon in a stiff even
ing breeze.
About 50 policemen stood in an arm
in-arm cordon around the crew after
landing. But before police could restrain
the enthusiastic mob, the balloon's gon
dola was ripped apart and children tore
and bit off pieces of the balloon to take
home as souvenirs.
"The reason we wanted to come to

France was Charles Lindbergh," Ander
son said. "He's an inspiration to many
generations of Frenchmen and Ameri
cans."
The balloon touched down at 7:50
p.m. Paris time, 1:50 p.m. EDT, 137
hours, 18 minutes after it lifted off last
Friday from Presque Isle, Maine.
The balloonists' control center at Bed
ford, Mass., estimated the distance at
3,233 miles, breaking the record of 2,740
set in 1977 by Ed Yost of Sioux Falls, S.D.
who ditched east of the Azores. Yost's
firm manufactured the Double Eagle 11.
Memphis talks continue
Memphis, Tenn. — Officials of police
and firefighters unions talked into the
early morning today with federal
mediators, trying to pin down details of a
contract proposal reported near settle
ment.
A member of the firefighters executive
board, who had asked not to be iden
tified, had said Thursday night that a ten
tative settlement had been reached.
However, Henry Evans, chief adminis
trative officer for the city, said early
today that he had "heard only that the
union leaders are working on some
thing."
Asked who was working on a prop
osal, Evans said, "David Baker president
of the Memphis Police Association,
Kuhron Huddleston president of Local
1784 of the International Firefighters As
sociation and federal mediators."
Members of the executive boards of
both unions lingered Friday at the AFL
CIO Labor Education Center where they
had gathered late yesterday to hear a
new proposal from their union presi
dents. But hours later, the officers were
still behind closed doors in an office
building seven miiles away.
Union officials, Mayor Wyeth Chan
dler, a federal mediator and representa
tives of the Chamber of Commerce had
been closeted in the downtown building
most of yesterday afternoon and even
ing, the second day of talks.
Ray denies murder
Washington — James Earl Ray told
House investigators yesterday he would
taketheblameforDr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s assassination "right here on televi
sion" if they could prove he was in At
lanta three days before.
The House assassinations committee
thendisplayed evidence that he was, but
Raycountered by saying the committee's
evidence was wrong.

"I know I didn't return to Atlanta," Ray
swore under oath, "and if I did, well, I'll
just take responsibility for the King case
right here on TV." Ray, who pleaded
guilty to killing King but recanted three
days later, was referring to live television
coverage of the hearings.
The committee then displayed a huge
blowup of two laundry tickets showing
Eric Gait, the alias Ray agreed he was
using, put clothes in the Piedmont Laun
dry in Atlanta April 1.
Ray said he is sure he put the laundry
in March 25 and that the laundry slip is
either forged or the clerk wrote down
the wrong date.
Tax relief plan imperiled
Sacramento — The state Senate dealt a
potentially fatal blow yesterday to As
sembly Speaker Leo McCarthy's plan to
abolish property taxes on homes.
On a 22-15 roll call, five short of the
required 27-vote majority, the upper
house refused for the second time in a
week to extend the deadline for placing
items on the Nov. 7 ballot.
Despite the Senate setback, McCarthy
wasn't giving up hope of getting his mea
sure on the ballot. A bizarre turn of
events late in the day left a slim chance
that the plan would survive.
A deadline extension that would apply
only to McCarthy's measure was
amended into an unrelated bill in a has
tily summoned conference committee
headed by a McCarthy loyalist, Assemb
lyman Bill Lockyer, D-San Leandro.
McCarthy's measure, a $3.2 billion tax
shift that also promises $1 billion in in
come tax credits for renters, was ap
proved by the Assembly Wednesday
night and sent to the Senate for commit
tee hearings yesterday.
Other provisions of the McCarthy plan
— unveiled last week — would reimpose
$3 billion of the $4 billion in business
property tax cuts triggered by Proposi
tion 13's passage in June. The plan would
also repeal the $415 million-a-year busi
ness inventory tax.
Israel dedicates outposts
Tel Aviv — Israel dedicated two Jewish
outposts on the West Bank of the Jordan
River yesterday, pushing ahead with its
controversial plan to settle occupied
Arab lands whether the Arabs agree or
not.
Israeli officials and the settlers, hoping
to avoid repetition of past criticism from
Washington and the Arab world, em
phasized the settlements had been ap

proved by the governnment in January
and, strictly speaking, were not new.
"This is not a move against the Camp
David summit, a woman who asked not
to be identified told a reporter at
Rapuah, one of the outposts.
The Mideast peace plan proposed by
Begin's government includes a demand
that Jewish settlements remain in the
West Bank. Egypt has rejected the plan
but Jerusalem officials say it will be Is
rael's starting point in the Camp David
negotiations. Sadat has demanded that
the settlements be dismantled.
Mt. Shasta cracks found
Sacramento — Wide, long cracks in the
gorund have been discovered in a Mt.
Shasta area shaken for two weeks by a
series of minor earthquakes, state
Geologist James Davis said yesterday.
Seismologists have said they were not
sure if the earthquakes signaled a poten
tial volcanic eruption of Mt. Shasta. It has
not erupted for 200 years, although it is
still classified as an active volcano.
Davis said in a statement that there are
disontinuous north-south cracks nearly
a mile long, and one large block of
ground sank three feet.
"A "swarm" of hundreds of quakes
ranging from 1 to 4 magnitude on the
Richter scale have occurred in the area
since Aug. 1. The latest quake of 3.25
Richter magnitude occurred early yes
terday.
"The scientific explanation for the ap
parent association of the surface cracks
and the earthquake swarm is not yet un
derstood. The cracks could be due to the
earthquakes or could be caused by other
geologic processes," he said.

Ray denies murder
Washington — James Earl Ray told
House investigators yesterday he would
taketheblameforDr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s assassination "right here on televi

lanta three days before.
The House assassinations committee
thendisplayed evidence that he was, but
Raycountered by saying the committee's
evidence was wrong.

"I know I didn't return to Atlanta," Ray
swore under oath, "and if I did, well, I'll
just take responsibility for the King case
right here on TV." Ray, who pleaded
guilty to killing King but recanted three
days later, was referring to live television
coverage of the hearings.
The committee then displayed a huge
blowup of two laundry tickets showing
Eric Gait, the alias Ray agreed he was
using, put clothes in the Piedmont Laun

Ray said he is sure he put the laundry
in March 25 and that the laundry slip is
either forged or the clerk wrote down
the wrong date.
Tax relief plan imperiled
Sacramento — The state Senate dealt a
potentially fatal blow yesterday to As
sembly Speaker Leo McCarthy's plan to
abolish property taxes on homes.
On a 22-15 roll call, five short of the
required 27-vote majority, the upper
house refused for the second time in a
week to extend the deadline for placing
items on the Nov. 7 ballot.
Despite the Senate setback, McCarthy
wasn't giving up hope of getting his mea
sure on the ballot. A bizarre turn of
events late in the day left a slim chance
that the plan would survive.
A deadline extension that would apply
only to McCarthy's measure was
amended into an unrelated bill in a has
tily summoned conference committee
headed by a McCarthy loyalist, Assemb
lyman Bill Lockyer, D-San Leandro.
McCarthy's measure, a $3.2 billion tax
shift that also promises $1 billion in in
come tax credits for renters, was ap
proved by the Assembly Wednesday
night and sent to the Senate for commit
tee hearings yesterday.
Other provisions of the McCarthy plan
— unveiled last week — would reimpose
$3 billion of the $4 billion in business
property tax cuts triggered by Proposi
tion 13's passage in June. The plan would
also repeal the $415 million-a-year busi
ness inventory tax.
Israel dedicates outposts
Tel Aviv — Israel dedicated two Jewish
outposts on the West Bank of the Jordan
River yesterday, pushing ahead with its
controversial plan to settle occupied
Arab lands whether the Arabs agree or
not.
Israeli officials and the settlers, hoping
to avoid repetition of past criticism from
Washington and the Arab world, em
phasized the settlements had been ap

proved by the governnment in January
and, strictly speaking, were not new.
"This is not a move against the Camp
David summit, a woman who asked not
to be identified told a reporter at
Rapuah, one of the outposts.
The Mideast peace plan proposed by
Begin's government includes a demand
that Jewish settlements remain in the
West Bank. Egypt has rejected the plan
but Jerusalem officials say it will be Is
rael's starting point in the Camp David
negotiations. Sadat has demanded that
the settlements be dismantled.
Mt. Shasta cracks found
Sacramento — Wide, long cracks in the
gorund have been discovered in a Mt.
Shasta area shaken for two weeks by a
series of minor earthquakes, state
Geologist James Davis said yesterday.
Seismologists have said they were not
sure if the earthquakes signaled a poten
tial volcanic eruption of Mt. Shasta. It has
not erupted for 200 years, although it is
still classified as an active volcano.
Davis said in a statement that there are
disontinuous north-south cracks nearly
a mile long, and one large block of
ground sank three feet.
"A "swarm" of hundreds of quakes
ranging from 1 to 4 magnitude on the
Richter scale have occurred in the area
since Aug. 1. The latest quake of 3.25
Richter magnitude occurred early yes
terday.
"The scientific explanation for the ap
parent association of the surface cracks
and the earthquake swarm is not yet un
derstood. The cracks could be due to the
earthquakes or could be caused by other
geologic processes," he said.

Croatians surrender
Chicago — Two Croatian nationalists
surrendered yesterday, 10 hours after
taking eight hostages at the West Ger
man Consulate and demanding freedom
for a militant countryman imprisoned in
West Germany.
The gunmen, described by police as
"Croatian terrorists" from the Chicago
area, negotiated with consulate officials
and authorities while placing a call to the
prison in Cologne, West Germany,
where Stjepan Bilandzic was being held
awaiting possible extradition to Yugos
lavia.
Fritz Ziefer, press officer for the Ger
man Embassy in Washington, D.C., said
Bilandzic, held in Cologne, West Ger
many, was jailed for "explosive attempts
in Yugoslavia and attacks on Yugoslavian
citizens living in Germany."
Raster said Bilandzic, 39, was con
victed of attempting to murder a Yugos
lav official in Dusseldorf, Germany. Ras
ter said a death sentence issued for
Bilandzic in Yugoslavia apparently had
been commuted to life in prison.
The terrorists had said that if their de
mands were denied, they could deto
nate a bomb powerful enough to destroy
five stories of the downtown building,
which houses the consulate on the 10th
floor.
Six persons had remained captive until
the time of their surrender.
Two hostages had been released ear
lier.
Balloonists make it
WMiserey, France — Three jubilant
Americans eased the Double Eagle 11 into
a wheat field and a riotous welcome 600
yards from this farming hamlet 60 miles
west of Paris yesterday evening, com
pleting the first trans-Atlantic balloon
crossing.
Cheering crowds abandoned their
cars and rushed the balloon to congratu
late its occupants — Maxie Anderson, 44,
Ben Abruzzo, 48, and Larry Newman, 31,
all of Albuquerque, N.M. — as they
jumped from the red-and-yellow gon
dola to secure the balloon in a stiff even
ing breeze.
About 50 policemen stood in an arm
in-arm cordon around the crew after
landing. But before police could restrain
the enthusiastic mob, the balloon's gon
dola was ripped apart and children tore
and bit off pieces of the balloon to take
home as souvenirs.
"The reason we wanted to come to

France was Charles Lindbergh," Ander
son said. "He's an inspiration to many
generations of Frenchmen and Ameri
cans."
The balloon touched down at 7:50
p.m. Paris time, 1:50 p.m. EDT, 137
hours, 18 minutes after it lifted off last
Friday from Presque Isle, Maine.
The balloonists' control center at Bed
ford, Mass., estimated the distance at
3,233 miles, breaking the record of 2,740
set in 1977 by Ed Yost of Sioux Falls, S.D.
who ditched east of the Azores. Yost's
firm manufactured the Double Eagle 11.
Memphis talks continue
Memphis, Tenn. — Officials of police
and firefighters unions talked into the
early morning today with federal
mediators, trying to pin down details of a
contract proposal reported near settle
ment.
A member of the firefighters executive
board, who had asked not to be iden
tified, had said Thursday night that a ten
tative settlement had been reached.
However, Henry Evans, chief adminis
trative officer for the city, said early
today that he had "heard only that the
union leaders are working on some
thing."
Asked who was working on a prop
osal, Evans said, "David Baker president
of the Memphis Police Association,
Kuhron Huddleston president of Local
1784 of the International Firefighters As
sociation and federal mediators."
Members of the executive boards of
both unions lingered Friday at the AFL
CIO Labor Education Center where they
had gathered late yesterday to hear a
new proposal from their union presi
dents. But hours later, the officers were
still behind closed doors in an office
building seven miiles away.
Union officials, Mayor Wyeth Chan

Richter magnitude occurred early yes

"The scientific explanation for the ap
parent association of the surface cracks
and the earthquake swarm is not yet un
derstood. The cracks could be due to the
earthquakes or could be caused by other
geologic processes," he said.

Croatians surrender
Chicago — Two Croatian nationalists
surrendered yesterday, 10 hours after
taking eight hostages at the West Ger
man Consulate and demanding freedom
for a militant countryman imprisoned in
West Germany.
The gunmen, described by police as
"Croatian terrorists" from the Chicago
area, negotiated with consulate officials
and authorities while placing a call to the
prison in Cologne, West Germany,
where Stjepan Bilandzic was being held
awaiting possible extradition to Yugos
lavia.
Fritz Ziefer, press officer for the Ger
man Embassy in Washington, D.C., said
Bilandzic, held in Cologne, West Ger
many, was jailed for "explosive attempts
in Yugoslavia and attacks on Yugoslavian
citizens living in Germany."
Raster said Bilandzic, 39, was con
victed of attempting to murder a Yugos
lav official in Dusseldorf, Germany. Ras
ter said a death sentence issued for
Bilandzic in Yugoslavia apparently had
been commuted to life in prison.
The terrorists had said that if their de
mands were denied, they could deto
nate a bomb powerful enough to destroy
five stories of the downtown building,
which houses the consulate on the 10th
floor.
Six persons had remained captive until
the time of their surrender.
Two hostages had been released ear
lier.
Balloonists make it
WMiserey, France — Three jubilant
Americans eased the Double Eagle 11 into
a wheat field and a riotous welcome 600
yards from this farming hamlet 60 miles
west of Paris yesterday evening, com
pleting the first trans-Atlantic balloon
crossing.
Cheering crowds abandoned their
cars and rushed the balloon to congratu
late its occupants — Maxie Anderson, 44,
Ben Abruzzo, 48, and Larry Newman, 31,
all of Albuquerque, N.M. — as they
jumped from the red-and-yellow gon
dola to secure the balloon in a stiff even
ing breeze.
About 50 policemen stood in an arm
in-arm cordon around the crew after
landing. But before police could restrain
the enthusiastic mob, the balloon's gon
dola was ripped apart and children tore
and bit off pieces of the balloon to take
home as souvenirs.
"The reason we wanted to come to

France was Charles Lindbergh," Ander
son said. "He's an inspiration to many
generations of Frenchmen and Ameri
cans."
The balloon touched down at 7:50
p.m. Paris time, 1:50 p.m. EDT, 137
hours, 18 minutes after it lifted off last
Friday from Presque Isle, Maine.
The balloonists' control center at Bed
ford, Mass., estimated the distance at
3,233 miles, breaking the record of 2,740
set in 1977 by Ed Yost of Sioux Falls, S.D.
who ditched east of the Azores. Yost's
firm manufactured the Double Eagle 11.
Memphis talks continue
Memphis, Tenn. — Officials of police
and firefighters unions talked into the
early morning today with federal
mediators, trying to pin down details of a
contract proposal reported near settle
ment.
A member of the firefighters executive
board, who had asked not to be iden
tified, had said Thursday night that a ten
tative settlement had been reached.
However, Henry Evans, chief adminis
trative officer for the city, said early
today that he had "heard only that the
union leaders are working on some
thing."
Asked who was working on a prop
osal, Evans said, "David Baker president
of the Memphis Police Association,
Kuhron Huddleston president of Local
1784 of the International Firefighters As
sociation and federal mediators."
Members of the executive boards of
both unions lingered Friday at the AFL
CIO Labor Education Center where they
had gathered late yesterday to hear a
new proposal from their union presi
dents. But hours later, the officers were
still behind closed doors in an office
building seven miiles away.
Union officials, Mayor Wyeth Chan
dler, a federal mediator and representa
tives of the Chamber of Commerce had
been closeted in the downtown building
most of yesterday afternoon and even
ing, the second day of talks.
Ray denies murder
Washington — James Earl Ray told
House investigators yesterday he would
taketheblameforDr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s assassination "right here on televi
sion" if they could prove he was in At
lanta three days before.
The House assassinations committee
thendisplayed evidence that he was, but
Raycountered by saying the committee's
evidence was wrong.

"I know I didn't return to Atlanta," Ray
swore under oath, "and if I did, well, I'll
just take responsibility for the King case
right here on TV." Ray, who pleaded
guilty to killing King but recanted three
days later, was referring to live television
coverage of the hearings.
The committee then displayed a huge
blowup of two laundry tickets showing
Eric Gait, the alias Ray agreed he was
using, put clothes in the Piedmont Laun
dry in Atlanta April 1.
Ray said he is sure he put the laundry
in March 25 and that the laundry slip is
either forged or the clerk wrote down
the wrong date.
Tax relief plan imperiled
Sacramento — The state Senate dealt a
potentially fatal blow yesterday to As
sembly Speaker Leo McCarthy's plan to
abolish property taxes on homes.
On a 22-15 roll call, five short of the
required 27-vote majority, the upper
house refused for the second time in a
week to extend the deadline for placing
items on the Nov. 7 ballot.
Despite the Senate setback, McCarthy
wasn't giving up hope of getting his mea
sure on the ballot. A bizarre turn of
events late in the day left a slim chance
that the plan would survive.
A deadline extension that would apply
only to McCarthy's measure was
amended into an unrelated bill in a has
tily summoned conference committee
headed by a McCarthy loyalist, Assemb
lyman Bill Lockyer, D-San Leandro.
McCarthy's measure, a $3.2 billion tax
shift that also promises $1 billion in in
come tax credits for renters, was ap
proved by the Assembly Wednesday
night and sent to the Senate for commit
tee hearings yesterday.
Other provisions of the McCarthy plan
— unveiled last week — would reimpose
$3 billion of the $4 billion in business
property tax cuts triggered by Proposi
tion 13's passage in June. The plan would
also repeal the $415 million-a-year busi
ness inventory tax.
Israel dedicates outposts
Tel Aviv — Israel dedicated two Jewish
outposts on the West Bank of the Jordan
River yesterday, pushing ahead with its
controversial plan to settle occupied
Arab lands whether the Arabs agree or
not.
Israeli officials and the settlers, hoping
to avoid repetition of past criticism from
Washington and the Arab world, em
phasized the settlements had been ap

proved by the governnment in January
and, strictly speaking, were not new.
"This is not a move against the Camp
David summit, a woman who asked not
to be identified told a reporter at
Rapuah, one of the outposts.
The Mideast peace plan proposed by
Begin's government includes a demand
that Jewish settlements remain in the
West Bank. Egypt has rejected the plan
but Jerusalem officials say it will be Is
rael's starting point in the Camp David
negotiations. Sadat has demanded that
the settlements be dismantled.
Mt. Shasta cracks found
Sacramento — Wide, long cracks in the
gorund have been discovered in a Mt.
Shasta area shaken for two weeks by a
series of minor earthquakes, state
Geologist James Davis said yesterday.
Seismologists have said they were not
sure if the earthquakes signaled a poten
tial volcanic eruption of Mt. Shasta. It has
not erupted for 200 years, although it is
still classified as an active volcano.
Davis said in a statement that there are
disontinuous north-south cracks nearly
a mile long, and one large block of
ground sank three feet.
"A "swarm" of hundreds of quakes
ranging from 1 to 4 magnitude on the
Richter scale have occurred in the area
since Aug. 1. The latest quake of 3.25
Richter magnitude occurred early yes
terday.
"The scientific explanation for the ap
parent association of the surface cracks
and the earthquake swarm is not yet un
derstood. The cracks could be due to the
earthquakes or could be caused by other
geologic processes," he said.
