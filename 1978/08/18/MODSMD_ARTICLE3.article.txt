# Carter: Risky Mideast summit
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” President
Jimmy Carter said yesterday a
rapid deterioration in the search
for Middle East peace left him no
choice but to convene an admit
tedly risky summit at Camp
David. But he conceded that fai
lure "could result in a new con
flict" in the area.
"It is a very high risk thing for
me politically," the president
said in his first public comment
on the summit scheduled to
begin at the presidential retreat
on Sept. 5.
At a nationally televised news
conference, Carter also took a
tough line with Congress, an
nouncing a veto of a $37 billion
military authorization bill, his
fifth presidential veto, and hint
ing of several more vetoes to

come.
Carter said he was "absolutely
convinced" both Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
want peace. Both men swiftly
accepted invitations to the
summit, showing their good
faith, the president added.
"We do not have any assur
ance of success," Carter said.
Since Sadat's historic vicit to
jerusalem last year, Carter said
peace initiatives have "broken
down completely." He said he
sent both leaders a letter outlin
ing a framework of working to
ward peace.
He said he was rejecting the
weapons bill because it con
tained $2 billion for a new nuc
lear aircraft carrier the nation did
not need. "This is not a question
of money," Carter said. "It's a
question of how that money is
going to be spent."
Carter said he wanted more
money spent on U.S. forces in
NATO, research and develop
ment and maintenance of con
ventional forces.
After Carter passed the word
to key lawmakers, House
Democaratic Leader Jim Wright
of Texas said he doubted that
Congress would override the
veto.
