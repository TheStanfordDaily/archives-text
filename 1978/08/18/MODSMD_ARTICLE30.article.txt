# For the second time ever—Dean Fred admits all
## 
### 
Editor's note: Although Fred Hargadon's
"two unfulfilled ambitions in life" involve
"being a pilot for American Airlines and
owning a small town newspaper," he is
apparently more than satisfied with his
current position as Dean of Admission at
Stanford. More than satisfactory too, many
would add.
Last month, for the first time in nearly
one year, Dean Fred agreed to sit through a
behemoth Daily interview in which he
answered several familiar questions for the
umpteenth time. After considering his re
sponses carefully, we are pleased to an
nounce that admission seems in order. It
went as follows:
by John Nielsen
Ifs been said that this office isn't your every
day admissions organization - that its
methods of operation are unlike those of any
other such group. Is that true? What distin
guishes this place from others in the same
business?
I absolutely hate the term "laid back." I
hate it partly because its a term that almost
everybody who does a survey of colleges
uses to describe southern California,
which they think of as the entire west
coast, and partly because . . . well, I really
don't like it very much.
Yet I suppose that this office is distin
guishable from others for something ap
proaching "laid-backness" — we we draw
the line at just how seriously we can take
ourselves. We try to be fairly realistic
about representing the University to stu
dents, forexample — I don't think that we
take the position that this is the only pos
sible school that people can attend and
obtain a good education and graduate
from and do well as a result of having gone
here and so forth. . . .
There are schools that do thatf
Yea. We run across them all the time,
where someone says, "You ABSOLUTELY
have to go here." They will bend stu
dents' arms at some places, and the
alumni will spend an awful lot of time cal
ling candidates up and saying "my god,
you've got to be a Yale man and wear a
blue blazer." Things like that. I think its to
our credit that we'll say "look we've done
our job and offered you admission, its up
to you now to decide where to go, you've
got to actively decide that, we're not going
to bend your arm, and we won't tell you
that you're the greatest person in the
world, or that we are the greatest institu
tion." That does work negatively for some
students, but it works postively for others.
There are candidates who decide not to
come to Stanford because we haven't
spent a lot of time begging them to come,
while other colleges have, and I suppose
their impression has been that we haven't
wanted them as much. But I would not like
to be in the business of begging 17 or 18
year-olds to attend a school as if it were
the only one in the world.
Yet this year you've got more people in the
freshman class than was expected. How
come?
Every year its kind of a guessing game
around here. You make an estimate of
how many you need to admit in order to
have 1500 enrolled, and usually the best
guide to that is the percentage that ac
cepted our offers of admission the year
before. This year we figured "well yes, 63
or 64 percent of those admitted last year
said that they were coming as freshmen,
but now tuition is four or five hundred
dollars more, and we should have a
slightly lower percentage."
But it didn't happen. The fact is, this
year fewer people got sick, fewer people
got off wait lists elsewhere, and hardly
anybody decided to defer. Because of
that, and possibly because of the fact that
we aren't doing a bad job, a lot of people
are showing up.
What do you think of the Bakke decision?
How will the Supreme Court's ruling in that
case affect admissions policies here?

At the undergraduate level the Bakke
decision doesn't really affect us that
much. We keep referring to it as "the"
Bakke decision, but if you read the case,
you realize that the court is split all over
the place. One person, in effect, decided
the case — Justice Powell. As for his deci
sion, we don't have quotas, so the fact that
you can't have them doesn't affect us. We
have made it a practice to consider minor
ity candidates along with all others — we
have recognized that they are minority
candidates, but according to the decision
that'sfine. Itwould be a little difficult to be
concerned on the one hand that we have
minority representation and pretend on
the other hand that we can't tell who is a
minority studentand who isn't. There's no
way to take minority background into
consideration unless we can identify it as
such.
I think everybody made too much of
that case. I tink too much emphasis is put
upon college admissions as the way to
solve educational problems for minority
students. The real problems are of course
way down in elementary and secondary
education. That's either where fractions of
the population get a good start in educa
tion, so that when they're applying to col
lege no special preference has to be given,
or it's where they don't.
Nobody in the country seems to want to
tackle that issue. All they want to do is
tackle the colleges, as if it really doesn't
matter what happens up to that point so
long as the colleges can be pressured to
be representative in some way.
i would not be surprised if 10 years from
now we're still dealing with the question
of minority admissions. No one is doing
the things that have to be done to create a
minority applicant pool which wouldn't
need any preference.

Some people say that there are geographic
quotas here, and that that's what accounts
for the huge number of Californians. Yes?
No. Absolutely not. We don't know
whom we've admitted from where until
we reach the end of the admissions pro
cess. We don't read by geography. We
don't know how many people are from a
given state until all the letters are mailed
out. The reason half the students here are
from California is simply that California is
roughly the equivalent of all the mid-
Atlantic and New England states. There
isn't any college in the United States that
doesn't have half its freshman class from
within about 400 miles.
Half our applicant group is from
California in a given year. And you should
remember that a student from the north
ernmost part of California is about as simi
lar to a student from LA as a student from
NY is to someone from Georgia.
So it doesn't help to be from anyplace in
particular when you apply?
It doesn't really. Indirectly it may help of
course, because the kind of person you
are is certainly influenced by the area that
you grew up in — if somebody grows up
on a tarm that might make the candidate
seem particularly interesting — but there
are no geographic quota. Nebraska per se
doesn't help. Farms per se don't help.
Other than the fact that there are more
women in the class of '80 that are interested
in becoming engineers, there don't appear to
be any appreciable differences between this
year's incoming freshmen and those pre
ceeding them. Is that true?
Yea. I don't think that there are any re
markable differences between this one
and those immediately preceding it. There
are some really interesting students in the
class, and I could go on for a long time
telling you about those I'd like to get to

know better, but when you speak in
aggregate terms I'd say that the class of '81
is nothing more than another run-of
the-mill outstanding freshman class. The
problem is that they're all good classes,
and I have trouble finding adjectives to
describe them that I didn't use last year. As
I've said before, there are probably some
incoming freshmen that I would notlike to
room with, but I imagine that there are a
fair number that would not like to room
with me.
I'm sure they'll dojust fine — they seem
very qualified and ready to go. My only
hope is that nobody saw "Animal House"
over the summer.
A few years ago a professor here wrote an
unsolicited letter to graduate school telling
them not to admit a student. Do you ever get
letters like thatf
I think that in all the years I've done
admissions maybe I've gotten two or three
letters like that. We tend to look at them as
crank letters and ignore them, and they
will always stand out as being from some
body who appears to have a grudge.
But normally we don't get that kind of
letter at all. Our problem is that every
body's made out to be a saint to us. Ac
cording to our letters of recommendation
we corner the market on saints. There are
ways of doing that, and we keep notes
every year on some of the favorite
techniques. For instance, a teacher will
say that "this is the best student I've had in
the last 12 years," one year and next year
we're pretty sure they're going to come up
with the best student they've had in 13.
And then 14. We get the kinds of letters
that say "Gee, if you don't take this person
you will be turning down someone better
than students that you have taken in the
past." They hold that out to us and in that
sense try to put us on the defensive from
the start.
And sometimes people unwittingly will
say nice things about somebody that . . .
well, one of our favorites is "John is
among the top 90 percent of all students
I've ever taught." People come up with
very positive ways to say things — after
reading day and night for too long you
tend to pick up the gloss, and work
through them very carefully.
Do you read every application?
Almost. They get read by at least three
people, one of whom is almost always me.
We want to make sure that somebody
catches what may miss,
and I think that if somebody pays a $25 fee
they ought to be read by as many people
as possible, including the dean.
Do you think that that is a common
philosophy? Do most schools pay that much
attention to applications?
I don't think so — except for a few of the
schools with which we overlap I think very
few schools look at the applications as
carefully as we do. We look at transcripts
very carefully, for instance — I would
think that that is the one thing that it is
most difficult for people to understand.
We look yery carefully, and cross off
courses that we think are not solid, and we
re-count the number of A's and B's and
C's. People with a 4.0 an end up at a disad
vantage in our process, if they obtain it in a
relatively small number of courses. This
year, for example, of the 11,000 that
applied here there were well over 1500
straight A averages — nothing less than an
A ever in high school — but a lot of those
straight A averages were achieved in what
we like to/efer to as "relatively light prog
rams."
We get clobbered every now and then
by a newspaper when we turn down a
super-athlete for that reason, because the
newspapers have heard from the athlete
what his CPA was. People forget the dif
ference between "soft courses" and solid
ones. We can't point that out in any indi
vidual case, so we never respond, but we
do kind of get raked over the coals now

and then.
What sort of rpessures does your office get
from coaches, trustees and other influential
people, and just where do these pressures
leadf
Surprisingly few pressures, in the sense
of that term. We get an awful lot of in
quiries, and a lot of people, as you can
imagine, write, putting forth candidates.
Most of the time, they're simply well
meaning. They really do like the student,
and would like to see them at Stanford.
All we do is acknowledge the letter, and
thank them for it. We do, when asked, tell
them that we don't get any letters that
aren't positive, so it's a little hard to use
that.
We've never been told to admit any
body. That is, the administration, or the
trustees or the president has never said,
"We just have to have this person." That's
fortunate.
With the coaches, I would pressure me
if I were them. Because in some sense,
they have got to be very interested in the
skills and talents of the athletes that are
going to play for them.
But we have a pretty clear understand
ing that when it comes down to the deci
sion whether to admit or not, that's really
our decision. We would like it to be nn
informed one, in the sense of the abilities
of the student, that they're really of the
caliber that, all things being equal, we can
take that talent into consideration.
And we ask the Athletic Department,
and the Music Department and the Art
Department to let us know about excep
tionally talented students. Now, we don't
take every exceptionally talented student,
obviously.
They'obviously get disappointed by a lot
of our decisions, and they're probably
happy about some of them. Here, they
operate under far more restriction than
most of .he schools we compete against
in, say, athletics.
That is, this is actually one of the few
places where student/athletes actually
have to fill out applications and be admit
ted like everybody else.
Its been reported that phoney diplomas can
be mail-ordered these days, and that people
in admissions departments get their share of
phoney applications. How often does this
happen at Stanford? Do you think that
you've ever been fooledf
It would be hard for us to get fooled, but
its not impossible. You remember the
case at Yale a few years ago where a guy
turned a false application in and got all the
way into the middle of his freshman year
before he decided not to take exams and
admitted that he had falsified everything
from his high school records on up. We've
usually had one candidate a year that has
tried something like that. We had a gem of
a case a year ago where a young man sent
in a transcript with hundreds of A's in solid
subjects listed — he also had something
like 48 varsity letters. That kinda made us
laugh, the 48 varsity letters, and the mis
spelled course listings seemed pretty ob
viously bogus, but the disturbing thing
about it is that when checking with the
other colleges to which he had applied we
found that he had been admitted
everywhere, and given big scholarships.
Again, that's rare, but it is worrisome. It
makes you wonder what colleges are
doing if they commit themselves to candi
dates like that.
You've said that you didn't grow up thinking
about being a dean of admissions, and that
now that you've got the job you don't spend
much time wondering how long you'll stay at
it. Is that still true? You ever feel like quitting,
Fred?
Well there are times during the admis
sion process each year when I wonder if
I'm going to make it through to May, but
there are other times when its hard to
conceive of a job more interesting than
this one. I try not to think about it more
than a year in advance.

everybody who does a survey of colleges
uses to describe southern California,
which they think of as the entire west
coast, and partly because . . . well, I really
don't like it very much.
Yet I suppose that this office is distin
guishable from others for something ap
proaching "laid-backness" — we we draw
the line at just how seriously we can take
ourselves. We try to be fairly realistic
about representing the University to stu
dents, forexample — I don't think that we
take the position that this is the only pos
sible school that people can attend and
obtain a good education and graduate
from and do well as a result of having gone
here and so forth. . . .
There are schools that do thatf
Yea. We run across them all the time,
where someone says, "You ABSOLUTELY
have to go here." They will bend stu
dents' arms at some places, and the
alumni will spend an awful lot of time cal
ling candidates up and saying "my god,
you've got to be a Yale man and wear a
blue blazer." Things like that. I think its to
our credit that we'll say "look we've done
our job and offered you admission, its up
to you now to decide where to go, you've
got to actively decide that, we're not going
to bend your arm, and we won't tell you
that you're the greatest person in the
world, or that we are the greatest institu
tion." That does work negatively for some
students, but it works postively for others.
There are candidates who decide not to
come to Stanford because we haven't
spent a lot of time begging them to come,
while other colleges have, and I suppose
their impression has been that we haven't
wanted them as much. But I would not like
to be in the business of begging 17 or 18
year-olds to attend a school as if it were
the only one in the world.
Yet this year you've got more people in the
freshman class than was expected. How
come?
Every year its kind of a guessing game
around here. You make an estimate of
how many you need to admit in order to
have 1500 enrolled, and usually the best
guide to that is the percentage that ac
cepted our offers of admission the year
before. This year we figured "well yes, 63
or 64 percent of those admitted last year
said that they were coming as freshmen,
but now tuition is four or five hundred
dollars more, and we should have a
slightly lower percentage."
But it didn't happen. The fact is, this
year fewer people got sick, fewer people
got off wait lists elsewhere, and hardly
anybody decided to defer. Because of
that, and possibly because of the fact that
we aren't doing a bad job, a lot of people
are showing up.
What do you think of the Bakke decision?
How will the Supreme Court's ruling in that
case affect admissions policies here?

At the undergraduate level the Bakke
decision doesn't really affect us that
much. We keep referring to it as "the"
Bakke decision, but if you read the case,
you realize that the court is split all over
the place. One person, in effect, decided
the case — Justice Powell. As for his deci
sion, we don't have quotas, so the fact that
you can't have them doesn't affect us. We
have made it a practice to consider minor
ity candidates along with all others — we
have recognized that they are minority
candidates, but according to the decision
that'sfine. Itwould be a little difficult to be
concerned on the one hand that we have
minority representation and pretend on
the other hand that we can't tell who is a
minority studentand who isn't. There's no
way to take minority background into
consideration unless we can identify it as
such.
I think everybody made too much of
that case. I tink too much emphasis is put
upon college admissions as the way to
solve educational problems for minority
students. The real problems are of course
way down in elementary and secondary
education. That's either where fractions of
the population get a good start in educa
tion, so that when they're applying to col
lege no special preference has to be given,
or it's where they don't.
Nobody in the country seems to want to
tackle that issue. All they want to do is
tackle the colleges, as if it really doesn't
matter what happens up to that point so
long as the colleges can be pressured to
be representative in some way.
i would not be surprised if 10 years from
now we're still dealing with the question
of minority admissions. No one is doing
the things that have to be done to create a
minority applicant pool which wouldn't
need any preference.

Some people say that there are geographic
quotas here, and that that's what accounts
for the huge number of Californians. Yes?
No. Absolutely not. We don't know
whom we've admitted from where until
we reach the end of the admissions pro
cess. We don't read by geography. We
don't know how many people are from a
given state until all the letters are mailed
out. The reason half the students here are
from California is simply that California is
roughly the equivalent of all the mid-
Atlantic and New England states. There
isn't any college in the United States that
doesn't have half its freshman class from
within about 400 miles.
Half our applicant group is from
California in a given year. And you should
remember that a student from the north
ernmost part of California is about as simi
lar to a student from LA as a student from
NY is to someone from Georgia.
So it doesn't help to be from anyplace in
particular when you apply?
It doesn't really. Indirectly it may help of
course, because the kind of person you
are is certainly influenced by the area that
you grew up in — if somebody grows up
on a tarm that might make the candidate
seem particularly interesting — but there
are no geographic quota. Nebraska per se
doesn't help. Farms per se don't help.
Other than the fact that there are more
women in the class of '80 that are interested
in becoming engineers, there don't appear to
be any appreciable differences between this
year's incoming freshmen and those pre
ceeding them. Is that true?
Yea. I don't think that there are any re
markable differences between this one
and those immediately preceding it. There
are some really interesting students in the
class, and I could go on for a long time
telling you about those I'd like to get to

know better, but when you speak in
aggregate terms I'd say that the class of '81
is nothing more than another run-of
the-mill outstanding freshman class. The
problem is that they're all good classes,
and I have trouble finding adjectives to
describe them that I didn't use last year. As
I've said before, there are probably some
incoming freshmen that I would notlike to
room with, but I imagine that there are a
fair number that would not like to room
with me.
I'm sure they'll dojust fine — they seem
very qualified and ready to go. My only
hope is that nobody saw "Animal House"
over the summer.
A few years ago a professor here wrote an
unsolicited letter to graduate school telling
them not to admit a student. Do you ever get
letters like thatf
I think that in all the years I've done
admissions maybe I've gotten two or three
letters like that. We tend to look at them as
crank letters and ignore them, and they
will always stand out as being from some
body who appears to have a grudge.
But normally we don't get that kind of
letter at all. Our problem is that every
body's made out to be a saint to us. Ac
cording to our letters of recommendation
we corner the market on saints. There are
ways of doing that, and we keep notes
every year on some of the favorite
techniques. For instance, a teacher will
say that "this is the best student I've had in
the last 12 years," one year and next year
we're pretty sure they're going to come up
with the best student they've had in 13.
And then 14. We get the kinds of letters
that say "Gee, if you don't take this person
you will be turning down someone better
than students that you have taken in the
past." They hold that out to us and in that
sense try to put us on the defensive from
the start.
And sometimes people unwittingly will
say nice things about somebody that . . .
well, one of our favorites is "John is
among the top 90 percent of all students
I've ever taught." People come up with
very positive ways to say things — after
reading day and night for too long you
tend to pick up the gloss, and work
through them very carefully.
Do you read every application?
Almost. They get read by at least three
people, one of whom is almost always me.
We want to make sure that somebody
catches what may miss,
and I think that if somebody pays a $25 fee
they ought to be read by as many people
as possible, including the dean.
Do you think that that is a common
philosophy? Do most schools pay that much
attention to applications?
I don't think so — except for a few of the
schools with which we overlap I think very
few schools look at the applications as
carefully as we do. We look at transcripts
very carefully, for instance — I would
think that that is the one thing that it is
most difficult for people to understand.
We look yery carefully, and cross off
courses that we think are not solid, and we
re-count the number of A's and B's and
C's. People with a 4.0 an end up at a disad
vantage in our process, if they obtain it in a
relatively small number of courses. This
year, for example, of the 11,000 that
applied here there were well over 1500
straight A averages — nothing less than an
A ever in high school — but a lot of those
straight A averages were achieved in what
we like to/efer to as "relatively light prog
rams."
We get clobbered every now and then
by a newspaper when we turn down a
super-athlete for that reason, because the
newspapers have heard from the athlete
what his CPA was. People forget the dif
ference between "soft courses" and solid
ones. We can't point that out in any indi
vidual case, so we never respond, but we
do kind of get raked over the coals now

and then.
What sort of rpessures does your office get
from coaches, trustees and other influential
people, and just where do these pressures
leadf
Surprisingly few pressures, in the sense
of that term. We get an awful lot of in
quiries, and a lot of people, as you can
imagine, write, putting forth candidates.
Most of the time, they're simply well
meaning. They really do like the student,
and would like to see them at Stanford.
All we do is acknowledge the letter, and
thank them for it. We do, when asked, tell
them that we don't get any letters that
aren't positive, so it's a little hard to use
that.
We've never been told to admit any
body. That is, the administration, or the
trustees or the president has never said,
"We just have to have this person." That's
fortunate.
With the coaches, I would pressure me
if I were them. Because in some sense,
they have got to be very interested in the
skills and talents of the athletes that are
going to play for them.
But we have a pretty clear understand
ing that when it comes down to the deci
sion whether to admit or not, that's really
our decision. We would like it to be nn
informed one, in the sense of the abilities
of the student, that they're really of the
caliber that, all things being equal, we can
take that talent into consideration.
And we ask the Athletic Department,
and the Music Department and the Art
Department to let us know about excep
tionally talented students. Now, we don't
take every exceptionally talented student,
obviously.
They'obviously get disappointed by a lot
of our decisions, and they're probably
happy about some of them. Here, they
operate under far more restriction than
most of .he schools we compete against
in, say, athletics.
That is, this is actually one of the few
places where student/athletes actually
have to fill out applications and be admit
ted like everybody else.
Its been reported that phoney diplomas can
be mail-ordered these days, and that people
in admissions departments get their share of
phoney applications. How often does this
happen at Stanford? Do you think that
you've ever been fooledf
It would be hard for us to get fooled, but
its not impossible. You remember the
case at Yale a few years ago where a guy
turned a false application in and got all the
way into the middle of his freshman year
before he decided not to take exams and
admitted that he had falsified everything
from his high school records on up. We've
usually had one candidate a year that has
tried something like that. We had a gem of
a case a year ago where a young man sent
in a transcript with hundreds of A's in solid
subjects listed — he also had something
like 48 varsity letters. That kinda made us
laugh, the 48 varsity letters, and the mis
spelled course listings seemed pretty ob
viously bogus, but the disturbing thing
about it is that when checking with the
other colleges to which he had applied we
found that he had been admitted
everywhere, and given big scholarships.
Again, that's rare, but it is worrisome. It
makes you wonder what colleges are
doing if they commit themselves to candi
dates like that.
You've said that you didn't grow up thinking
about being a dean of admissions, and that
now that you've got the job you don't spend
much time wondering how long you'll stay at
it. Is that still true? You ever feel like quitting,
Fred?
Well there are times during the admis
sion process each year when I wonder if
I'm going to make it through to May, but
there are other times when its hard to
conceive of a job more interesting than
this one. I try not to think about it more
than a year in advance.


Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
Editor's note: Although Fred Hargadon's
"two unfulfilled ambitions in life" involve
"being a pilot for American Airlines and
owning a small town newspaper," he is
apparently more than satisfied with his
current position as Dean of Admission at
Stanford. More than satisfactory too, many
would add.
Last month, for the first time in nearly
one year, Dean Fred agreed to sit through a
behemoth Daily interview in which he
answered several familiar questions for the
umpteenth time. After considering his re
sponses carefully, we are pleased to an
nounce that admission seems in order. It
went as follows:
by John Nielsen
Ifs been said that this office isn't your every

ling candidates up and saying "my god,
you've got to be a Yale man and wear a
blue blazer." Things like that. I think its to
our credit that we'll say "look we've done
our job and offered you admission, its up
to you now to decide where to go, you've
got to actively decide that, we're not going
to bend your arm, and we won't tell you
that you're the greatest person in the
world, or that we are the greatest institu
tion." That does work negatively for some
students, but it works postively for others.
There are candidates who decide not to
come to Stanford because we haven't
spent a lot of time begging them to come,
while other colleges have, and I suppose
their impression has been that we haven't
wanted them as much. But I would not like
to be in the business of begging 17 or 18
year-olds to attend a school as if it were
the only one in the world.
Yet this year you've got more people in the
freshman class than was expected. How
come?
Every year its kind of a guessing game
around here. You make an estimate of
how many you need to admit in order to
have 1500 enrolled, and usually the best
guide to that is the percentage that ac
cepted our offers of admission the year
before. This year we figured "well yes, 63
or 64 percent of those admitted last year
said that they were coming as freshmen,
but now tuition is four or five hundred
dollars more, and we should have a
slightly lower percentage."
But it didn't happen. The fact is, this
year fewer people got sick, fewer people
got off wait lists elsewhere, and hardly
anybody decided to defer. Because of
that, and possibly because of the fact that
we aren't doing a bad job, a lot of people
are showing up.
What do you think of the Bakke decision?
How will the Supreme Court's ruling in that
case affect admissions policies here?

At the undergraduate level the Bakke
decision doesn't really affect us that
much. We keep referring to it as "the"
Bakke decision, but if you read the case,
you realize that the court is split all over
the place. One person, in effect, decided
the case — Justice Powell. As for his deci
sion, we don't have quotas, so the fact that
you can't have them doesn't affect us. We
have made it a practice to consider minor
ity candidates along with all others — we
have recognized that they are minority
candidates, but according to the decision
that'sfine. Itwould be a little difficult to be
concerned on the one hand that we have
minority representation and pretend on
the other hand that we can't tell who is a
minority studentand who isn't. There's no
way to take minority background into
consideration unless we can identify it as
such.
I think everybody made too much of
that case. I tink too much emphasis is put
upon college admissions as the way to
solve educational problems for minority
students. The real problems are of course
way down in elementary and secondary
education. That's either where fractions of
the population get a good start in educa
tion, so that when they're applying to col
lege no special preference has to be given,
or it's where they don't.
Nobody in the country seems to want to
tackle that issue. All they want to do is
tackle the colleges, as if it really doesn't
matter what happens up to that point so
long as the colleges can be pressured to
be representative in some way.
i would not be surprised if 10 years from
now we're still dealing with the question
of minority admissions. No one is doing
the things that have to be done to create a
minority applicant pool which wouldn't
need any preference.

Some people say that there are geographic
quotas here, and that that's what accounts
for the huge number of Californians. Yes?
No. Absolutely not. We don't know
whom we've admitted from where until
we reach the end of the admissions pro
cess. We don't read by geography. We
don't know how many people are from a
given state until all the letters are mailed
out. The reason half the students here are
from California is simply that California is
roughly the equivalent of all the mid-
Atlantic and New England states. There
isn't any college in the United States that
doesn't have half its freshman class from
within about 400 miles.
Half our applicant group is from
California in a given year. And you should
remember that a student from the north
ernmost part of California is about as simi
lar to a student from LA as a student from
NY is to someone from Georgia.
So it doesn't help to be from anyplace in
particular when you apply?
It doesn't really. Indirectly it may help of
course, because the kind of person you
are is certainly influenced by the area that
you grew up in — if somebody grows up
on a tarm that might make the candidate
seem particularly interesting — but there
are no geographic quota. Nebraska per se
doesn't help. Farms per se don't help.
Other than the fact that there are more
women in the class of '80 that are interested
in becoming engineers, there don't appear to
be any appreciable differences between this
year's incoming freshmen and those pre
ceeding them. Is that true?
Yea. I don't think that there are any re
markable differences between this one
and those immediately preceding it. There
are some really interesting students in the
class, and I could go on for a long time
telling you about those I'd like to get to

know better, but when you speak in
aggregate terms I'd say that the class of '81
is nothing more than another run-of
the-mill outstanding freshman class. The
problem is that they're all good classes,
and I have trouble finding adjectives to
describe them that I didn't use last year. As
I've said before, there are probably some
incoming freshmen that I would notlike to
room with, but I imagine that there are a
fair number that would not like to room
with me.
I'm sure they'll dojust fine — they seem
very qualified and ready to go. My only
hope is that nobody saw "Animal House"
over the summer.
A few years ago a professor here wrote an
unsolicited letter to graduate school telling
them not to admit a student. Do you ever get
letters like thatf
I think that in all the years I've done
admissions maybe I've gotten two or three
letters like that. We tend to look at them as
crank letters and ignore them, and they
will always stand out as being from some
body who appears to have a grudge.
But normally we don't get that kind of
letter at all. Our problem is that every
body's made out to be a saint to us. Ac
cording to our letters of recommendation
we corner the market on saints. There are
ways of doing that, and we keep notes
every year on some of the favorite
techniques. For instance, a teacher will
say that "this is the best student I've had in
the last 12 years," one year and next year
we're pretty sure they're going to come up
with the best student they've had in 13.
And then 14. We get the kinds of letters
that say "Gee, if you don't take this person
you will be turning down someone better
than students that you have taken in the
past." They hold that out to us and in that
sense try to put us on the defensive from
the start.
And sometimes people unwittingly will
say nice things about somebody that . . .
well, one of our favorites is "John is
among the top 90 percent of all students
I've ever taught." People come up with
very positive ways to say things — after
reading day and night for too long you
tend to pick up the gloss, and work
through them very carefully.
Do you read every application?
Almost. They get read by at least three
people, one of whom is almost always me.
We want to make sure that somebody
catches what may miss,
and I think that if somebody pays a $25 fee
they ought to be read by as many people
as possible, including the dean.
Do you think that that is a common
philosophy? Do most schools pay that much
attention to applications?
I don't think so — except for a few of the
schools with which we overlap I think very
few schools look at the applications as
carefully as we do. We look at transcripts
very carefully, for instance — I would
think that that is the one thing that it is
most difficult for people to understand.
We look yery carefully, and cross off
courses that we think are not solid, and we
re-count the number of A's and B's and
C's. People with a 4.0 an end up at a disad
vantage in our process, if they obtain it in a
relatively small number of courses. This
year, for example, of the 11,000 that
applied here there were well over 1500
straight A averages — nothing less than an
A ever in high school — but a lot of those
straight A averages were achieved in what
we like to/efer to as "relatively light prog
rams."
We get clobbered every now and then
by a newspaper when we turn down a
super-athlete for that reason, because the
newspapers have heard from the athlete
what his CPA was. People forget the dif
ference between "soft courses" and solid
ones. We can't point that out in any indi
vidual case, so we never respond, but we
do kind of get raked over the coals now

and then.
What sort of rpessures does your office get
from coaches, trustees and other influential
people, and just where do these pressures
leadf
Surprisingly few pressures, in the sense
of that term. We get an awful lot of in
quiries, and a lot of people, as you can
imagine, write, putting forth candidates.
Most of the time, they're simply well
meaning. They really do like the student,
and would like to see them at Stanford.
All we do is acknowledge the letter, and
thank them for it. We do, when asked, tell
them that we don't get any letters that
aren't positive, so it's a little hard to use
that.
We've never been told to admit any
body. That is, the administration, or the
trustees or the president has never said,
"We just have to have this person." That's
fortunate.
With the coaches, I would pressure me
if I were them. Because in some sense,
they have got to be very interested in the
skills and talents of the athletes that are
going to play for them.
But we have a pretty clear understand
ing that when it comes down to the deci
sion whether to admit or not, that's really
our decision. We would like it to be nn
informed one, in the sense of the abilities
of the student, that they're really of the
caliber that, all things being equal, we can
take that talent into consideration.
And we ask the Athletic Department,
and the Music Department and the Art
Department to let us know about excep
tionally talented students. Now, we don't
take every exceptionally talented student,
obviously.
They'obviously get disappointed by a lot
of our decisions, and they're probably
happy about some of them. Here, they
operate under far more restriction than
most of .he schools we compete against
in, say, athletics.
That is, this is actually one of the few
places where student/athletes actually
have to fill out applications and be admit
ted like everybody else.
Its been reported that phoney diplomas can
be mail-ordered these days, and that people
in admissions departments get their share of
phoney applications. How often does this
happen at Stanford? Do you think that
you've ever been fooledf
It would be hard for us to get fooled, but
its not impossible. You remember the
case at Yale a few years ago where a guy
turned a false application in and got all the
way into the middle of his freshman year
before he decided not to take exams and
admitted that he had falsified everything
from his high school records on up. We've
usually had one candidate a year that has
tried something like that. We had a gem of
a case a year ago where a young man sent
in a transcript with hundreds of A's in solid
subjects listed — he also had something
like 48 varsity letters. That kinda made us
laugh, the 48 varsity letters, and the mis
spelled course listings seemed pretty ob
viously bogus, but the disturbing thing
about it is that when checking with the
other colleges to which he had applied we
found that he had been admitted
everywhere, and given big scholarships.
Again, that's rare, but it is worrisome. It
makes you wonder what colleges are
doing if they commit themselves to candi
dates like that.
You've said that you didn't grow up thinking
about being a dean of admissions, and that
now that you've got the job you don't spend
much time wondering how long you'll stay at
it. Is that still true? You ever feel like quitting,
Fred?
Well there are times during the admis
sion process each year when I wonder if
I'm going to make it through to May, but
there are other times when its hard to
conceive of a job more interesting than
this one. I try not to think about it more
than a year in advance.


Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
Editor's note: Although Fred Hargadon's
"two unfulfilled ambitions in life" involve
"being a pilot for American Airlines and
owning a small town newspaper," he is
apparently more than satisfied with his
current position as Dean of Admission at
Stanford. More than satisfactory too, many
would add.
Last month, for the first time in nearly
one year, Dean Fred agreed to sit through a
behemoth Daily interview in which he
answered several familiar questions for the
umpteenth time. After considering his re
sponses carefully, we are pleased to an
nounce that admission seems in order. It
went as follows:
by John Nielsen
Ifs been said that this office isn't your every
day admissions organization - that its
methods of operation are unlike those of any
other such group. Is that true? What distin
guishes this place from others in the same
business?
I absolutely hate the term "laid back." I
hate it partly because its a term that almost
everybody who does a survey of colleges
uses to describe southern California,
which they think of as the entire west
coast, and partly because . . . well, I really
don't like it very much.
Yet I suppose that this office is distin
guishable from others for something ap
proaching "laid-backness" — we we draw
the line at just how seriously we can take
ourselves. We try to be fairly realistic
about representing the University to stu
dents, forexample — I don't think that we
take the position that this is the only pos
sible school that people can attend and
obtain a good education and graduate
from and do well as a result of having gone
here and so forth. . . .
There are schools that do thatf
Yea. We run across them all the time,
where someone says, "You ABSOLUTELY
have to go here." They will bend stu
dents' arms at some places, and the
alumni will spend an awful lot of time cal
ling candidates up and saying "my god,
you've got to be a Yale man and wear a
blue blazer." Things like that. I think its to
our credit that we'll say "look we've done
our job and offered you admission, its up
to you now to decide where to go, you've
got to actively decide that, we're not going

the only one in the world.
Yet this year you've got more people in the
freshman class than was expected. How
come?
Every year its kind of a guessing game
around here. You make an estimate of
how many you need to admit in order to
have 1500 enrolled, and usually the best
guide to that is the percentage that ac
cepted our offers of admission the year
before. This year we figured "well yes, 63
or 64 percent of those admitted last year
said that they were coming as freshmen,
but now tuition is four or five hundred
dollars more, and we should have a
slightly lower percentage."
But it didn't happen. The fact is, this
year fewer people got sick, fewer people
got off wait lists elsewhere, and hardly
anybody decided to defer. Because of
that, and possibly because of the fact that
we aren't doing a bad job, a lot of people
are showing up.
What do you think of the Bakke decision?
How will the Supreme Court's ruling in that
case affect admissions policies here?

At the undergraduate level the Bakke
decision doesn't really affect us that
much. We keep referring to it as "the"
Bakke decision, but if you read the case,
you realize that the court is split all over
the place. One person, in effect, decided
the case — Justice Powell. As for his deci
sion, we don't have quotas, so the fact that
you can't have them doesn't affect us. We
have made it a practice to consider minor
ity candidates along with all others — we
have recognized that they are minority
candidates, but according to the decision
that'sfine. Itwould be a little difficult to be
concerned on the one hand that we have
minority representation and pretend on
the other hand that we can't tell who is a
minority studentand who isn't. There's no
way to take minority background into
consideration unless we can identify it as
such.
I think everybody made too much of
that case. I tink too much emphasis is put
upon college admissions as the way to
solve educational problems for minority
students. The real problems are of course
way down in elementary and secondary
education. That's either where fractions of
the population get a good start in educa
tion, so that when they're applying to col
lege no special preference has to be given,
or it's where they don't.
Nobody in the country seems to want to
tackle that issue. All they want to do is
tackle the colleges, as if it really doesn't
matter what happens up to that point so
long as the colleges can be pressured to
be representative in some way.
i would not be surprised if 10 years from
now we're still dealing with the question
of minority admissions. No one is doing
the things that have to be done to create a
minority applicant pool which wouldn't
need any preference.

Some people say that there are geographic
quotas here, and that that's what accounts
for the huge number of Californians. Yes?
No. Absolutely not. We don't know
whom we've admitted from where until
we reach the end of the admissions pro
cess. We don't read by geography. We
don't know how many people are from a
given state until all the letters are mailed
out. The reason half the students here are
from California is simply that California is
roughly the equivalent of all the mid-
Atlantic and New England states. There
isn't any college in the United States that
doesn't have half its freshman class from
within about 400 miles.
Half our applicant group is from
California in a given year. And you should
remember that a student from the north
ernmost part of California is about as simi
lar to a student from LA as a student from
NY is to someone from Georgia.
So it doesn't help to be from anyplace in
particular when you apply?
It doesn't really. Indirectly it may help of
course, because the kind of person you
are is certainly influenced by the area that
you grew up in — if somebody grows up
on a tarm that might make the candidate
seem particularly interesting — but there
are no geographic quota. Nebraska per se
doesn't help. Farms per se don't help.
Other than the fact that there are more
women in the class of '80 that are interested
in becoming engineers, there don't appear to
be any appreciable differences between this
year's incoming freshmen and those pre
ceeding them. Is that true?
Yea. I don't think that there are any re
markable differences between this one
and those immediately preceding it. There
are some really interesting students in the
class, and I could go on for a long time
telling you about those I'd like to get to

know better, but when you speak in
aggregate terms I'd say that the class of '81
is nothing more than another run-of
the-mill outstanding freshman class. The
problem is that they're all good classes,
and I have trouble finding adjectives to
describe them that I didn't use last year. As
I've said before, there are probably some
incoming freshmen that I would notlike to
room with, but I imagine that there are a
fair number that would not like to room
with me.
I'm sure they'll dojust fine — they seem
very qualified and ready to go. My only
hope is that nobody saw "Animal House"
over the summer.
A few years ago a professor here wrote an
unsolicited letter to graduate school telling
them not to admit a student. Do you ever get
letters like thatf
I think that in all the years I've done
admissions maybe I've gotten two or three
letters like that. We tend to look at them as
crank letters and ignore them, and they
will always stand out as being from some
body who appears to have a grudge.
But normally we don't get that kind of
letter at all. Our problem is that every
body's made out to be a saint to us. Ac
cording to our letters of recommendation
we corner the market on saints. There are
ways of doing that, and we keep notes
every year on some of the favorite
techniques. For instance, a teacher will
say that "this is the best student I've had in
the last 12 years," one year and next year
we're pretty sure they're going to come up
with the best student they've had in 13.
And then 14. We get the kinds of letters
that say "Gee, if you don't take this person
you will be turning down someone better
than students that you have taken in the
past." They hold that out to us and in that
sense try to put us on the defensive from
the start.
And sometimes people unwittingly will
say nice things about somebody that . . .
well, one of our favorites is "John is
among the top 90 percent of all students
I've ever taught." People come up with
very positive ways to say things — after
reading day and night for too long you
tend to pick up the gloss, and work
through them very carefully.
Do you read every application?
Almost. They get read by at least three
people, one of whom is almost always me.
We want to make sure that somebody
catches what may miss,
and I think that if somebody pays a $25 fee
they ought to be read by as many people
as possible, including the dean.
Do you think that that is a common
philosophy? Do most schools pay that much
attention to applications?
I don't think so — except for a few of the
schools with which we overlap I think very
few schools look at the applications as
carefully as we do. We look at transcripts
very carefully, for instance — I would
think that that is the one thing that it is
most difficult for people to understand.
We look yery carefully, and cross off
courses that we think are not solid, and we
re-count the number of A's and B's and
C's. People with a 4.0 an end up at a disad
vantage in our process, if they obtain it in a
relatively small number of courses. This
year, for example, of the 11,000 that
applied here there were well over 1500
straight A averages — nothing less than an
A ever in high school — but a lot of those
straight A averages were achieved in what
we like to/efer to as "relatively light prog
rams."
We get clobbered every now and then
by a newspaper when we turn down a
super-athlete for that reason, because the
newspapers have heard from the athlete
what his CPA was. People forget the dif
ference between "soft courses" and solid
ones. We can't point that out in any indi
vidual case, so we never respond, but we
do kind of get raked over the coals now

and then.
What sort of rpessures does your office get
from coaches, trustees and other influential
people, and just where do these pressures
leadf
Surprisingly few pressures, in the sense
of that term. We get an awful lot of in
quiries, and a lot of people, as you can
imagine, write, putting forth candidates.
Most of the time, they're simply well
meaning. They really do like the student,
and would like to see them at Stanford.
All we do is acknowledge the letter, and
thank them for it. We do, when asked, tell
them that we don't get any letters that
aren't positive, so it's a little hard to use
that.
We've never been told to admit any
body. That is, the administration, or the
trustees or the president has never said,
"We just have to have this person." That's
fortunate.
With the coaches, I would pressure me
if I were them. Because in some sense,
they have got to be very interested in the
skills and talents of the athletes that are
going to play for them.
But we have a pretty clear understand
ing that when it comes down to the deci
sion whether to admit or not, that's really
our decision. We would like it to be nn
informed one, in the sense of the abilities
of the student, that they're really of the
caliber that, all things being equal, we can
take that talent into consideration.
And we ask the Athletic Department,
and the Music Department and the Art
Department to let us know about excep
tionally talented students. Now, we don't
take every exceptionally talented student,
obviously.
They'obviously get disappointed by a lot
of our decisions, and they're probably
happy about some of them. Here, they
operate under far more restriction than
most of .he schools we compete against
in, say, athletics.
That is, this is actually one of the few
places where student/athletes actually
have to fill out applications and be admit
ted like everybody else.
Its been reported that phoney diplomas can
be mail-ordered these days, and that people
in admissions departments get their share of
phoney applications. How often does this
happen at Stanford? Do you think that
you've ever been fooledf
It would be hard for us to get fooled, but
its not impossible. You remember the
case at Yale a few years ago where a guy
turned a false application in and got all the
way into the middle of his freshman year
before he decided not to take exams and
admitted that he had falsified everything
from his high school records on up. We've
usually had one candidate a year that has
tried something like that. We had a gem of
a case a year ago where a young man sent
in a transcript with hundreds of A's in solid
subjects listed — he also had something
like 48 varsity letters. That kinda made us
laugh, the 48 varsity letters, and the mis
spelled course listings seemed pretty ob
viously bogus, but the disturbing thing
about it is that when checking with the
other colleges to which he had applied we
found that he had been admitted
everywhere, and given big scholarships.
Again, that's rare, but it is worrisome. It
makes you wonder what colleges are
doing if they commit themselves to candi
dates like that.
You've said that you didn't grow up thinking
about being a dean of admissions, and that
now that you've got the job you don't spend
much time wondering how long you'll stay at
it. Is that still true? You ever feel like quitting,
Fred?
Well there are times during the admis
sion process each year when I wonder if
I'm going to make it through to May, but
there are other times when its hard to
conceive of a job more interesting than
this one. I try not to think about it more
than a year in advance.


Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
Editor's note: Although Fred Hargadon's
"two unfulfilled ambitions in life" involve
"being a pilot for American Airlines and
owning a small town newspaper," he is
apparently more than satisfied with his
current position as Dean of Admission at
Stanford. More than satisfactory too, many
would add.
Last month, for the first time in nearly
one year, Dean Fred agreed to sit through a
behemoth Daily interview in which he
answered several familiar questions for the
umpteenth time. After considering his re
sponses carefully, we are pleased to an
nounce that admission seems in order. It
went as follows:
by John Nielsen
Ifs been said that this office isn't your every
day admissions organization - that its
methods of operation are unlike those of any
other such group. Is that true? What distin
guishes this place from others in the same
business?
I absolutely hate the term "laid back." I
hate it partly because its a term that almost
everybody who does a survey of colleges
uses to describe southern California,
which they think of as the entire west
coast, and partly because . . . well, I really
don't like it very much.
Yet I suppose that this office is distin
guishable from others for something ap
proaching "laid-backness" — we we draw
the line at just how seriously we can take
ourselves. We try to be fairly realistic
about representing the University to stu
dents, forexample — I don't think that we
take the position that this is the only pos
sible school that people can attend and
obtain a good education and graduate
from and do well as a result of having gone
here and so forth. . . .
There are schools that do thatf
Yea. We run across them all the time,
where someone says, "You ABSOLUTELY
have to go here." They will bend stu
dents' arms at some places, and the
alumni will spend an awful lot of time cal
ling candidates up and saying "my god,
you've got to be a Yale man and wear a
blue blazer." Things like that. I think its to
our credit that we'll say "look we've done
our job and offered you admission, its up
to you now to decide where to go, you've
got to actively decide that, we're not going
to bend your arm, and we won't tell you
that you're the greatest person in the
world, or that we are the greatest institu
tion." That does work negatively for some
students, but it works postively for others.
There are candidates who decide not to
come to Stanford because we haven't
spent a lot of time begging them to come,
while other colleges have, and I suppose
their impression has been that we haven't
wanted them as much. But I would not like
to be in the business of begging 17 or 18
year-olds to attend a school as if it were
the only one in the world.
Yet this year you've got more people in the
freshman class than was expected. How
come?
Every year its kind of a guessing game
