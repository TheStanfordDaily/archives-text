# Stanford's learning assistance center
## 'A remedial program for the bright' 
### 
At Stanford, where the aver
age high school CPA of enter
ing freshmen is 3.8, one of the
most popular groups of classes
is taught by the Learning Assis
tance Center (LAC).
The center, which opened in
1972, offers courses in study
skills improvement, reading,
vocabulary, peer counseling
and tutoring, as well as
methods of tackling term pap
ers and theses.
According to LAC director
Michael McHargue, "Stanford

students are so bright they ha
ven't had to develop effective
learning skills. They have
achieved high marks without
such instruction."
He explains that poor learn
ing skills develop because
most students have had no
formal instruction in reading
since elementary school.
The challenges present in
the environemnt here — peer
pressure, competition for ad
mission to graduate and pro
fessional schools and personal

expectations formed in high
school — have led students to
the realization that efficiency
will be what distinguishes
them from other students of
equal intelligence.
Besides offering the learning
skills improvement classes,
LAC was instrumental in de
veloping departmental tutor
ing programs such as the
Physics Reference Frame, the
Chemistry Information Room
and the Math Comsulting
Center.

Individual tutoring is hand
led by undergraduates who en
roll in the tutor training course
and earn credit for both their
training and the tutoring ser
vices.
In 1974, LAC received a grant
of $6000 from the Exxon Educa
tion Foundation to plan, de
velop and evaluate a peer
counseling program aimed at
improving study skills.
The peer counselors them
selves must take the LAC-1 "Ef
fective Learning Skills" class to
reinforce their knowledge of
learning skills. After viewing
the success of the LAC peer
counseling program, former
Undergraduate Studies Dean
James Gibbs allowed LAC to
become the accrediting agency
for all campus peer counseling
programs.
The LAC program was the
subject of a Time article two
years ago, and was labeled a
"remedial program for the
bright." McHargue takes a
slightly different approach,
wanting to "make it clear that
people don't have to get into
an academic jam in order to
use our services. Stanford stu
dents have a lot of difficulty ac
cepting help — but everyone
including graduate students
and faculty use our program."
The techniques of the LAC
seem to be effective. McHar
gue reports that after taking
one or more LAC courses,
grades, units completed, and
academic reading rates all im
prove.
The Learning Assistance
Center is located in Meyer 123.
