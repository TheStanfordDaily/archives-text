# AICâ€”advisers and advice
## On what to do about the academic questions 
### 
At some point during his or
her Stanford career, nearly
every study is sure to en
counter an academic question
to which no one seems to have
an answer. More often than
not, the Academic Information
Center (AIC), housed on the
third floor of Old Union, can
provide a satisfactory solution.
The AIC exists to help un
dergraduate students define
and achieve their academic
and educational goals. The
center serves as a clearin
ghouse of information dealing
with academic affairs.
One of the most frequently
used AIC services is the im
mense collection of literature
from various colleges, univer
sities and graduate schools.
They have information about
scholarships at other institu
tions, plus those available

specifically to women and
minorities. Here, too, can be
found applications to the stag
gering array of graduate school
admissions examinations:
MCAT, LSAT, GRE and others.
Another AIC program in
volves preprofessional coun
seling, available for students in
any field, but especially those
in pre-med, pre-law and pie
business.
Because of specific curricula
requirements, pre-med stu
dents are assigned individual
advisors, most of whom are
physicians. Because of less
specific requirements, other
preprofessonal advising is less
structured. '
However, the AIC does not
stress preprofessionalism. Ac
cording to former Center Di
rector Robert Hamrdla, . .

there is nothing further from
our minds. The service exists
because students feel the need
for it."
In addition, the AIC offers
preprofessional (rather than
just pre-med or pre-law) advis
ing in order to encourage stu
dents to consider other career
alternatives within their major
field.
For students outside the
preprofessional areas, the AIC
primarily offers help in dealing
with advisors and advising. All
undergraduates who have not
declared a major and all inter
departmental majors are under
the supervision of the AIC.
The AIC also is in charge of
all transfer advising and keeps
track of writing and de
partmental distribution re
quirements for every student.
