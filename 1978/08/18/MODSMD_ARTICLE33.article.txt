# A 						little recycling advice
## 
### 
Don't throw this Daily away
â€” recycle it! And do the same
with all your cans, bottles, and
other paper. Why? Because
America's solid waste load is
presently increasing at twice
the rate of the population. Each
year we throw away 50 billion
cans, 27 billion bottles and jars
four million tons of plastic, 7.6
million television sets, seven
million vehicles and 30 million
tons of paper. To bring things
cloer to home, the Palo Alto
landfill, recipient of the 680
tons per month of solid waste
generated by the Stanford
community, is only a few short
years away from being full. Re
cycling not only saves landfill
space, but also saves energy
and natural resources and re
duces polulution.
The ASSU Recycling Center,
in operation since January
1978, has recycled over 200
tons of paper, 60 tons of glass
and 8000 pounds of aluminum.
The center, which was initially
funded by a two-quarter fee as

sessment, is completely
student-run and -organized. A
staff of six to 10 students, work
ing six days a week, will con
tinue on-campus pick-ups of
recycling drums which are lo
cated in all residences and
many administrative areas as
well as at the Medical Center
and the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. Full drums
are replaced by empty and are
taken by the staff to the center,
located on Pampas Lane in the
Plant Services yard.
To aid in processing, the Re
cycling Center staff asks that
glass be clean and unbroken
when placed in drums but it is
not necessary to remove labels
and metal neck rings. Papers
need not be bundled and can
include all types of paper ex
cept magazines, carbon paper,
cardboard and any other glossy
paper. Cans should be rinsed
out and have the labels re
moved. All of these materials
may be placed in the labelled
green recycling drums, easily

identified by the white logo
painted on them, which are in
every residence. In addition to
on-campus pickups the Re
cycling Center is open to fa
culty, staff, and students living
off campus on Tuesdays from
2p6 p.m. and Saturdays from 11
a.m.p4 p.m. for drop off of re
cyclables.
The Recycling Center also
needs people to volunteser as
residence coordinators, a job
requiring about 10 minutes a
week. Residence coordinators
are responsible for notifying
the center when the drums in
their residence are ready for a
pcik-up and also for promoting
recycling in general in their re
sidence. The center is also in
the process of hiring staff for
1978-79, a job involving 10 to 12
hours a week. Anyone in
terested in either of these posi
tions should contact the Re
cycling Center Office located
in the ASSU Offices in Tresid
der Union for more informa
tion, or call 497-4331.
