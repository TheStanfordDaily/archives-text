# The 						choosing of roommates: how you got what you got
## 
### 
Every year the rumor goes
around that freshman room
mates are assigned on the basis
of height. But there's a lot
more to it than that, according
to the staffers at the Academic
Information Center (AIC) who
do the assigning.
"Height is the most com
monly overridden factor," said
Freshman Coordinator Joan
Trusty. "If that was the only
thing roommates had in com
mon we could assign the entire
freshman class in a day and a
half."
Instead, using academic,
cultural and extracurricular
factors, Trusty, together with
Freshman Coordintor Shawn
Hoover, former AIC Director
Robert Hamrdla and current
Director Elizabeth Meyer spent
two to three weeks assigning
roommates within dorms.
"Students have a lot of mis
conceptions about the way
roommates are assigned," said
Hamrdla, now Director of Trus
tee Affairs. "It's a pretty com
plex process."
The staffers try to assign
matches which are diversified,
but where some common in
terests and background are

shared. Hobbies, community
activities, sports interests, and
academic major are all consi
dered.
Californians are traditionally
paired with non-Californians.
"Often out-of-staters will spec
ifically ask to be assigned with
someone from California —
with the idea that maybe they'll
know more what's going on,"
said Meyer. Meyer has been
Assistant Director of the AIC
for five years and became Di
rector in August of 1977.
'Nuclear medicine'
Two people with the same
specific academic interests —
"say, nuclear medicine" — are
not assigned together, accord
ing to Meyer. Nor would two
varsity athletes in the same
sport be put in the same room.
"We don't like to encourage
intra-room competition."
Trusty pointed out that "little
things can make a lot of differ
ence. One thing we'd consider
is taste in music. We find a lot
of people who have played in
symphony orchestras. There
could be a conflict if we put
them with someone who plays
hard-driving rock at all hours of
the night."

Triples and quads, in dorms
like Branner, Roble and Toyon,
are filled differently than dou
bles. "We tried to make sure
each person had something in
common with at least one
other person in the room,"
said Trusty. "But you'll find
more diversity in a triple or a
quad than you'll probably find
in a double."
The staffers try to accommo
date students with special re
quests. The exception is a re
quest for a specific roommate.
"These often occur because
that's the only person they
know at Stanford," said Meyer.
"We'll generally put friends
who've requested a room to
gether in the same complex or
the same side of campus, if
other factors don't override."
"It's a value judgment," said
Hamrdla. "We believe it's im
portant for freshmen to be ex
posed to someone of a diffe
rent background who they've
never met before."
No smoking
The most common student
request is for a non-smoking
roommate.
Roommate conflicts can
force a person to be more out
going, said Meyer. "They may
have to reevaluate their pre
conceived ideas, and growth
occurs."
"I hear people say things like
'so-and-so is a good dorm,' or
'you're stuck in a lousy dorm,' <
said Trusty. "That can be very
misleading. You get a new
group of people every year, so •
you can't really say that a cer- .
tain dorm is going to be bad.
"Everything is done with the
idea of widening a freshman's
horizons," said Trusty. "They
experience new and different ,
things — and they enjoy them-"
most of the time."
