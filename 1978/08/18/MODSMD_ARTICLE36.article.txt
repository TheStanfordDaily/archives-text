# Where to go when you want to study
## 
### 
Perhaps libraries were origi
nally intended solely as re
positories of printed knowledge
and experience. It is a fact of na
ture, however, that students
seeking that knowledge and ex
perience are inclined to settle
themselves in its physical midst.
Thus libraries have a dual func
tion: they are storehouses of in
formation and temples of com
munion with that information.
The Main (or as it's known in
its new incarnation, the Cecil B.
Green) Library is a good example
of a library predominantly
storehouse in conception. It
does an excellent job of keeping
a great many books (almost a
million at last count) dry and free
from the depradations of hungry
rodents, but most find it rela
tively non-conducive to serious
study. It is full of echos and
winter-time drafts (both aggra
vated if not caused by the high
ceilings of the study areas), and
the chairs and tables belong to
an older, less upholstered age.
Meyer
The undergraduate library,
Meyer, appears, in contrast, to
be considered by many superla
tive in its function as a temple of
communion. One can go in, for
example, on a typical Sat
urday afternoon and find almost
as many students there as
books, all raptly communing,
barely able to tear themselves
away as closing time nears.
Most of the other libraries on
campus fall somewhere bet
ween these extremes. Some,
small and intimate, have highly
variable atmospheres. The Clas

sics Library, for example, is at
times an excellent place to
study, quiet and with the smell
of erudition in the air, while at
other times some of the physical
fixtures of the department such
as the graduate students make it
wholly inhospitable.
Many of the departmental lib
raries (the Math, Psychology and
Philosophy Libraries, for exam
ple) fall into this category.
Some of the middle-sized lib
raries strike the best balance be
tween the two functions. Nota
ble in this respect are the
Architecture Library v
Cubberley Library, also in the
middle-sized category, is very
similar in general atmosphere to
the Main Library reference room
and thus has similar drawbacks.
Earth Sciences
The Earth Sciences Library
(study areas well-integrated
among the books with comfort
able furniture, although the
height of the ceiling and the
large windows keep the temper
ature cool, especially in the
winter), and the Biology Library
(large and varied study areas as
well as outside patios) are both
among the University's finest.
Also in this category are the
graduate school libraries. These
include the Business Library
(well-furnished and comforta
ble), the Law School Library
(plush, although frequently suf
fering from extremes of temper
ature) and Lane Medical Library
(not the best facility for study).
