# Career decision? ask the CCCP
## 
### 
The essential purpose of the
Career Planning and Ph< â€¢>-
ment Center (CPPC) is I Ip
students make decisions >out
their careers, and to help mem
find jobs after graduation.
One measure of the success
of this aim is the fact that with
the exception of one year,
CPPC has consistently in
creased its job placement rate
for the past 11 years. This con
trasts with the opposite trend
in the job placement of college
graduates in general.
CPPC Director Ralph Keller
said he "does not know of any
center (at another college) that
has a career planning program
as extensive as this one."
"We help individuals get
their act together so they have
as good a chance as possible"
to get the jobs they want, he
added.
Serves students, alumni
CPPC, located between the
Bookstore and Green (Main)
Library, serves currently enrol
led students, student spouses
and alumni.
Potential careers
The CPPC helps guide stu
dents toward potential careers,
but "we don't tell a student
what to do, or decide for them
what their needs are," Keller
said. CPPC tries to respond "in
terms of what they (students)
perceive their needs to be," he
added.
CPPC organizes about 90
seminars and workshops each
year. The seminars deal with
career options and oppor
tunities, job hunting, resume
writing techniques, and self as
sessment, according to Keller.
The center also offers indi
vidual counseling from per

manent staff members and
trained peer counselors, and
has a library stocked with
career information.
Individuals registered with
CPPC receive a weekly list of
jobs available in their area of
specialization, compiled from
continual research by the
center.
Employment files
A person registered with
CPPC can also maintain a file.
On request CPPC will send the
file to prospective employers.
"We send over 25,000 confi
dential files each year," Keller
said. "We have taken a lot of
pride in our placement files so
that when they go out from
here, they look better than
anybody else's."
CPPC also facilitates campus
interviews and recruiting by
companies. CPPC does this
because "students want to talk
to them about employment,"
Keller said.
Last year representatives
from about 500 companies vis
ited campus and 15,000 inter
views were held.
Student Employment Office
The Student Employment
Office (SEO), a section of
CPPC, is located in a separate
office adjacent to the main of
fice. SEO handles part time and
temporary employment for
students. SEO lists available
jobs and offers employment
counseling.
