# National service program justified

The following comments are
in response to John Hancock's
rebuttal to my recent editorial
concerning compulsory service.
In the first place I do not believe
that a reduction of our freedoms
is the solution to our social and
economic problems.
I do however believe that a
greater sense of respect for
those freedoms is in order, one
which would be fostered by a
compulsory service system. At
present there is no sense of
unity or team spirit in America,
and nationalistic pride is a thing
of the past.
We share common goals yet
our system pits us against each
other as we strive to attain them.
At the same time modern
technology has made us the
most spoiled population on
Earth.
Oblivious to the fact that we
enjoy freedoms and luxuries
unknown to most of the world's
people most of us can barely
muster the effort to stand when
the national anthem is played let
alone wing. By making the
American lifestyle something
that every citizen must work for
via a selective service system
perhaps we would appreciate it.
Hancock's second criticsm
concerned the inferred imprac
ticality of financing selective

service. Though I am a medical
student with limited knowledge
of economics I do know that the
money came from somewhere
during such worthless efforts as
the Korean and Vietnamese con
flicts. Why is it that sufficient
funds seem always available for
destructive endeavors but not
constructive ones?
For example one recently
suggested strategy for keeping
astride the Russians in the arms
race involves construction of
empty missile silos and periodic
shuffling of warheads so that the
location of our striking power
remains a mystery. If American
tax dollars can be justifiably
spent on such nuclear non
sense, then they certainly can fi
nance worthwhile public pro
jects undertaken by an inducted
work force.
Finally I object to use of the
term "grand experiment" in de
scribing my proposal. Hancock
is correct in stating that our na
tion was founded on democratic
principles which came about
only as a result of idealism and
the guts to try something new. If
we are consistently afraid to try
new approaches social and
economic problems in America
can only worsen.
