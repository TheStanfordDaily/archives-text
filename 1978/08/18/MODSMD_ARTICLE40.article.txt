# Stanford University: the rise to prominence and the fall from innocence
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
Once upon a time, life was
simple, good and bad
were clearly defined and Stan
ford University was a small but
honest institution of higher
learning. Free enterprise,
democracy, the United States,
industry and a college educa
tion were all considered emi
nently worthwhile things. Few
people doubted that what was
good for an American univer
sity was good for America was
good for the world.
Then a world war occurred.
Ripples of change which had
been lapping at the pilings of
habit and tradition were
gathered by that event into a
great wave of innovation,
transformation and renova
tion. Most of the swimmers in
the sea of human endeavor did
not see the wave coming. It
caught them unawares, as they
paddled randomly about, and
it gave them several bad mo
ments of disorientation as they
struggled against its uncon
trollable surge. A very few
swimmers, however, spotted
the swell before it had
gathered much momentum.
They were able to point them
selves in the wave's direction
of advance and take a few
strokes before it was upon
them. The most adept among
them caught the full force of
the wave and used it to their
advantage. Within this latter
group was Stanford University.
Placed by luck and foresight in
the perfect position to catch
the swell, Stanford rode the
crest as few others were able
to, now catching an especially
fast burst forward, now hang
ing back to avoid a hazardous
obstacle.
As the wave rolled on, life
lost its simple character. Good
was mixed with bad into a froth
of confusion. Stanford Univer
sity was no longer small norun
impeachably honest. Free en
terprise, democracy, the Un
ited States, industry and a col
lege education had become
debased in value. And the sim
ple equation lost its force for
many people: what was good
for an American university may
or may not have been good for
America; what was good for
America was obtained at the
expense of the rest of the
world.
Even now Stanford sits atop
the wave's crest as it crashes
into the future. The character
of life, the quality, the per
ceived integrity of the Univer
sity are still influx. New values,
new equations flourish and
wither according to uncom
prehended laws. And if we
want to make any sense of the
future, historians tell us, we
must examine the past.
Given the magnitude of the
changes which have oc
curred over the last 40 years, it
is perhaps surprising how eas
ily the old Stanford, the small
but-honest institution of
higher learning, is conjured up
out of the memories of the
alumni, administrators and fa

culty members who were ac
quainted with the University
before the second world war.
One man whose recollections
include experiences both as a
student and as a teacher is Rix
ford Snyder. At present the di
rector of alumni attitude re
search, Dr. Snyder's involve
ment with Stanford started in
1926 when he enrolled as a
freshman. Ten years after
graduating, he took his docto
rate in history, and joined the
History Department's faculty.
Following the war, he was
asked by President J.E. Wallace
Sterling to take charge of the
fledgling Admissions Office.
Recalling his early days at

Once upon a time, life was simple,
good and bad were clearly defined,
and Stanford University was a small
institution of higher learning. Then
there was a war, and there were
changes .

Stanford, Dr. Snyder told me
recently: "In 1926 it was a diffe
rent world — transportation
wise, economically. A different
world and a more stable one
perhaps. Students didn't go
great distances to college in
those days. I think even among
the undergraduates at Stanford
at that time, the idea of a na
tional reputation wasn't really
much of a concern. In 1926,
Stanford was considered to be
a very fine regional university.
In our thinking it was the best
on the Pacific Coast and that
was as far as our thinking went.
In no way did we think of rank
ing Stanford with Harvard or
Princeton or Yale or MIT.
"After I became Dean of
Admissions I learned a lot
about past admissions. I think
it's fair to say that all the men
candidates who applied in the
'20s who had B averages or bet
ter and had good strong re
commendations were admit
ted. This was not true for the
girls. There were sometimes as
many as four or five candidates
for each place. But then there
was a period in the '30s during
the depression years when
even the basic minimum was
bent because they were
scratching for students."
A man whose experiences
with pre-World War II Stanford
include not only those of stu
dent and teacher, but adminis
trator as well, is Frederick Ter
man. From the time it was first
heard on campus some years
before the First World War
until his retirement in 1965,
Terman's name assumed ever
increasing importance in the
University's affairs. He began
his professional career teach
ing radio engineering in the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment, went on to become head
of that department and even
tually Dean of the School of
Engineering. He finally became
Provost and Vice President of
the University under Wallace

Sterling.
Dr. Terman has been, by his
own account, in residence at
Stanford longer than anyone
else, having been absent for
only two relatively brief
stretches since 1912. I asked
him not long ago about his
early recollections of Stanford
and he said: "Of course the
University was very much smal
ler then — physically, the size
of the student body, the size of
the faculty. Most of the faculty
lived on the campus and the
academic setup was smaller.
"We had a good general
reputation. We were well re
garded but not as a great scho
larly institution. But a nice

place for a school. We did have
a number of people, just a li
mited number, who were well
regarded and we had a few
points of national distinction.
But it wasn't a star-studded fa
culty the way Harvard's was."
The fortunes of Stanford
were at a low ebb in the
years preceding and during
World War 11. The depression
had occurred at a time when
the young University was just
starting to feel confident in its
future. The crash of '29 in
flicted many types of doubts on
many types of individuals, by
no means the least of which
were those pertaining to
money. The University's en
dowment began to look smal
ler and smaller and income
from the handful of other
sources which existed at that
time — tuition, private philan
thropy, bequests — reflected
the hard times. The lack of
ready funds not only prohi
bited expansion of the Univer
sity facilities, but also limited
the maintenance of those al
ready in existence. The lib
raries began to fall behind in
acquisitions; the science and
engineering laboratories were
unable to acquire new equip
ment. Faculty morale began to
suffer and enrollment dipped
ominously.
When the War came, it put
the country back on its feet but
did little for Stanford. As Fre
derick Terman, who was ab
sent for the duration, was later
to write: "Stanford emerged
from World War II as an un
derprivileged institution. It
had not been significantly in
volved in any of the exciting
engineering activity associated
with the war. Although the
klystron tube had been in
vented at Stanford in 1937 by
Russell Varian, this activity
moved east in early 1941. As a
result, when (I) returned to
Stanford in January 1946 to take

over as Dean of Engineering, (I)
started from scratch, without
forward momentum."
Where did Dr. Terman go at
that critical juncture in Stan
ford's history, when the vigor
of his alma mater was on the
decline; when the same forces
that were challenging an entire
country were testing the Uni
versity's resources as they had
never been tried before; when
the need for dynamic leader
ship was in such clear demand ?
"I fought the war as a Har
vard man," he told me. "I was
asked to organize a research
project — countermeasures
against enemy radar. But when
I was there I got to know the
Harvard setup pretty well. I
learned a lot from Harvard.
How they did things and why
they did things. Many of the
procedures were different at
Harvard than any other school
and I learned why. The trea
surer of Harvard was my boss
and he lived right across the
street from us. We were close
personal friends."
The location of Dr. Terman's
loyalties, however, was never
seriously in doubt. He had
gone to Harvard because that
was where he could be most
useful to his country. Even be
fore the conclusion of the hos
tilities, he said, he knew he
would be going back to Stan
ford. "I was appointed Dean of
the Engineering School, to take
office when I returned," he
told me. "So I knew what my
responsibilities were going to
be a year or so ahead of time. I
thought about the situation in
the School of Engineering and
concluded that there would be
a post-war continuation of the
war research. I walked across
the street to my neighbor —
the treasurer of Harvard — and
asked him. And Harvard in its
usual way — they had already
been discussing the subject for
some time. They had arrived at
their post-war policies. So I
learned how Harvard was
going to deal with this. I had
lots of friends at MIT and I
nosed around there. I found
that everyone in Cambridge
agreed that there was going to
be a continuation of the Uni
versity research that had been
so valuable to the military."
For those of us who have
grown up in a world in which
large-scale government spend
ing is one of the given condi
tions of life, in the same rank as
death and taxes, the revolutio
nary nature of federally
supported research is hard to
appreciate. Writing retrospec
tively, 17 years later, Dr. Ter
man explained the reasoning
which led him to perceive a de
velopment which many other
shrewd men missed: "As the
end of the war approached, it
was clear that the government
would support this research in
universities for two main
reasons: the war effort involv
ing university scientists had
paid off handsomely in radar,
proximity fuses, rocket and jet
propulsion, the atom bomb,
etc., and the continuation of

such defense-related research
was necessary to maintain our
future military position. Even
then one could see a troubled
world ahead."
The result of his foresight,
Dr. Terman told me, together
with the contacts he had made
at Harvard, "was that Stanford
got really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every
other university in the country
in this research activity."
Enter Dr. J.E. Wallace Sterl
ing. A Canadian by birth, Dr.
Sterling received his B.A. at
McGill and arrived at Stanford
in 1930 to work on his Ph.D. He
stayed for eight years, assisting
at what was to become the
Hoover Institution and lectur
ing in the History Department
in addition to studying for his
doctorate. He held a variety of
jobs during the War and was
chosen for the University pres
idency in 1949.
As soon as he took office, Dr.
Sterling said in a speech he
gave shortly before stepping
down from the Presidency in
1968, he devoted himself to
improving the University's fi
nancial condition. He was con
siderably aided in this en
deavor by the new prosperity
which was one of the most ob

it crashes into the future. The
character of life, the quality, the per
ceived integrity of the University are
still in flux . . .

vious characteristics of the
wave of change. Government
research contracts — which
Dr. Sterling called "a hidden
form of federal aid" — were
coming in such numbers that
the faculty of some depart
ments were able to pick and
choose among a large variety.
In 1963, Princeton University
won a ruling from the New Jer
sey Supreme Court which held
that corporations could give
money to educational institu
tions without risking sharehol
der's suits. The decision was to
have a particularly beneficial
effect on Stanford since a
number of local corporations
were becoming increasingly
grateful to the University and
were increasingly in a position
to show their gratitude in dol
lars and cents.
And then there was the ques
tion of Stanford's land. Until
Dr. Sterling took office, very
little had been done to develop
the erstwhile ranch beyond the
construction of academic
buildings. The first step to
exploit its economic potential
was taken in 1951 when the
master plan for the Stanford
Industrial Park was drawn up.
During the next two decades
one project after another was
undertaken to make the land
more economically productive
— including the Stanford
Shopping Center and a handful
of housing complexes. Income

from rents and leases is par
ticularly valuable since its use
is wholly unrestricted. Thus
the $1 million or so which is
derived annually from Indust
rial Park leases makes an im
portant contribution in balanc
ing the University's budget.
Finally, and most signific
antly, was a Ford Foundation
matching grant program
which, under the inspiring ac
ronym PACE (Plan for Action
for a Challenging Era), brought
the University $115 million and
the closest thing to long-lasting
financial security it had known
since the turn of the century.
The breakneck surge which
Stanford had experienced
on the wave of progress during
the '50s had abated somewhat
by the early 19605, but had left a
heady sense of accomplish
ment and a feeling of unlimited
promise in its wake. The shoals
which were soon to make the
going rough were not yet in
view; the only sights which of
fered themselves for contem
plation were the myriad mar
kers of success.
One particularly conspicu
ous set of such markers were
the objective measurements of
student quality. In 1954, the
most impressive fact the Uni-

versity News Service could
muster with regard to that
year's incoming freshmen was
that a third of them "made an
'A' average in high school, and
every last one of them was ac
tive in extra-curricular student
affairs." In 1963, however, the
News Service reported that "60
young women with straight-A
high school records" were on
the waiting list for the follow
ing fall's freshman class and
"the median grade point aver
age (for those admitted) is 3.8
for men and 3.9 for women."
An executive assistant to the
President lamented the fact
that although the University
was selecting "from the top
five percent of the nation's
high school graduates, (it was)
able to enroll only one out of
five applicants."
"When I first went into ad
missions," Dr. Snyder told me,
explaining the dramatic
metamorphosis in the student
body, "there were barely
enough candidates — enough
qualified candidates — to rill
the class. Well, it helped a lot
when the birth rate picked up.
But just as important, I think,
was the fact that we began a
conscious program for the first
time of seeking to get candi
dates from all over the United
States. When I first went into
admissions, about 72 percent
of all students came from
California. By the time I left, it

was below 50 percent. So we
did do, I think, a very satisfac
tory job in attracting not only a
very diverse student body
geographically, but also in at
tracting obviously better stu
dents."
Things were looking equally
bright in the graduate schools.
In 1961, the News Service re
ported that "the University's
continuing effort to recruit top
talent from all sections of the
country has reaped an espe
cially rich harvest from Har
vard, Princeton and Yale —
traditionally regarded as the
country's top three prestige
colleges."
On the faculty front too,
great inroads had been made.
Quantitatively, the number of
faculty members above the
rank of instructor rose from 615
in 1960 to 729 just three years
later. Qualitatively, the $100
million plus raised by the PACE
program put Stanford by 1963
in "a position where it can now
compete for faculty with the
best universities in the coun
try," according to a member of
the administration at that time.
Average faculty salaries were
among the top 10 nationally, he
said, and "very close to the first
five."
Another conspicuous set of
success markers was the na
tional rankings of university
departments conducted by the
American Council on Educa
tion. In 1925, Stanford placed
only two departments —
psychology and geology —
among the top 10 in the coun
try. By 1957, that number had
risen to five and in 1964 it had
gone up six-fold to 12.
Economics had gone from fif
teenth to a tie for fourth to
sixth; psychology from
seventh to fifth to second; and
physics from thirteenth to sixth
to fifth.
All of these positive
signposts were doubtless very
welcome, but the measure of
success most likely to inspire
the University's stewards with
a full-bellied feeling of satisfac
tion was the exponential in
crease in gifts and bequests. As
recently as 1943, the annual
total of donations was less than
$1 million and in 1950, it failed
to exceed $2.5 million. Shortly
thereafter, though, a scarcely
believable acceleration began:
in 1956, nearly 12,000 con
tributors donated more than
$10.5 million; in 1963, Stan
ford's coffers were enriched to
the tune of $38.5 million, the
largest such sum received by
any private University in the
country that year. Harvard was
firmly relegated to second
place, a full $2.5 million be
hind.
The most conspicuous suc
cess marker of them all,
however, occupies an area in
excess of one hundred square
miles. Known as the "Silicon
Valley," this particular marker
consists of the thousand or so
"pioneering technology com
panies" which Fortune

magazine described as "form
ing the densest concentration
of innovative industry that
exists anywhere in the world."
The creation, in less than 30
years, of a $2.5 billion-a-year
center of technology which
maintains an entire county of
nearly 1.5 million people at an
above-average level of pros
perity, would seem to be such
a prodigious task that no single
institution, much less single
individual, could be believably
credited with it. Agreement is
general though, that the Sili
con Valley is as much a product
of Stanford's science and en
gineering departments as the
technologies which made pos
sible radar, the electron mic
roscope and many of the ad
vances of modern chemistry;
and no one disputes that those
departments are to a very large
degree the product of Fre
derick Terman.
The glowing accolades to his
vision which have appeared in
such journals as Science,
Reader's Digest and Fortune
notwithstanding, Dr. Terman
attributes Santa Clara County's
electronics boom to the fed
eral government's post-war
support of university research.
"The rise of research-oriented
growth industries in the San
Francisco Bay area can be
traced to 1946, the year in
which Stanford received its
first three major research con
tracts from the federal gov
ernment," he wrote in 1963.
"One of these aborted, but the
other two proved of lasting im
portance. With government
support, Dr. Felix Bloch was
able to exploit the results of a
remarkably new discovery,
nuclear magnetic resonance.
This work brought him a Nobel

Prize and laid the groundwork
for Stanford's rise to promi
nence in physics.
"The second productive
contract was in electronics —
the forerunner of a $5 million
annual federally-sponsored re
search program at the Univer
sity which has helped attract
200 electronics firms within a
50-mile radius of Stanford."
The story of the Silicon Val
ley's meteoric rise in part con
sists of the arrival of big names
such as General Electric, Lock
heed and IBM, and in part of

the growth of little names such
as Watkins Johnson, Hewlett-
Packard and Varian Associates.
And this latter part is indissol
ubly linked with Stanford In
dustrial Park. Established in
formally in 1950 with the leas
ing of 10 of the University's
8800 acres to the Varian
brothers, the Park grew stead
ily through the '50s and '60s
and now is spread out over 700
acres. By 1959 20 firms had
taken up residence on the site,
by 1964 the figure had in
creased t043, and 10 years after
that it had reached 55. These
firms combined gave employ
ment to 17,000 people and
produced $1 million annually
in unrestricted income for the
University.
The intimacy between indus
try and the University which
Dr. Terman d_'" elysetout
to engendr ms success in
that endeavor represented by
the Industrial Park in particular
and the Silicon Valley in gen
eral, have produced a variety of
consequences. Among the
most positive, Dr. Terman has
written, was the symbiosis be
tween the University and local
firms: "The same companies
that have benefitted from their
proximity to Stanford have also
helped to make the University
a stronger and better place.
They have done this in many
ways. They have helped pro
vide the Peninsula with an ex
citing environment that aids in
the recruiting of faculty, and
they have helped Stanford's
competitive position by pro
viding attractive consulting
opportunities for faculty
members."
Equally positive, at least from
the point of view of Stanford
trained engineers, were the as
tonishing prospects for mate

rial success which they en
countered after completing
their educations. 1n,1965, for
example, a University survey
revealed that more than half of
all the recipients of engineer
ing bachelor's degrees in 1940
had gone on to become the
presidents or vice presidents
of their firms. In 1976, a
statistically-minded author
journalist wrote that "the suc
cess rate for company found
ers is so high that there are at
least 100 millionaires — possi
bly as many as 500 — in Santa

Clara County. Many of them
are in their early 305." And sev
eral of them, according to Dr.
Terman, are on the Stanford
faculty.
But the wave's nature is
ceaseless, all-pervasive
change, and even as the old
problems were giving way to
reseate solutions, new ones
were surfacing in their stead.
Increasing complexity being
the rule of the age, the
second-generation challenges
were neither as susceptible to
solution nor as rewarding to
confront. "The problems I had
to wrestle with were so diffe
rent from the ones Dr. Lyman

had when he took office," Dr.
Sterling told me at one point in
our conversation. "They were
problems you could really get
your teeth into."
The new problems began to
manifest themselves in the late
1950s but did not come fully
into their own until the mid
'6os. Their intractability could
be accounted for partly by their
tangled interpenetrations and
partly by the entrenched and
diverse interests to which the
old problems had given rise.
The obnoxious underbelly of
one of the great first
generation solutions — the
flow of government money
into the University and local
industry — could be invoked to
explain many, but by no means
all of the new ills. Among other
things, spawned what was at
the time termed "excessive
dependence" on fickle federal
spending. This in turn led to
financial insecurity, both for
faculty members engaged in
sponsored research and in
dustrial concerns engaged in
federal contracting. It also led
to a worry which was voiced by
Dr. Sterling in 1960: that "be
cause so much money for this
science and technology is
supplied by the federal gov
ernment, the question has
been raised as to whether or
not the federal government is
moving into the area of educa
tion with a possible danger of
controlling it, on the theory
that he who pays the piper will
call the tune."
For the length of the gov
ernment's career in supporting
university research and the
economies of entire regions,
the tunes it had called had
most often been composed in
a martial key. Such military
music, it is true, was assured of
a receptive audience during
the Cold War. Frederick Ter
man was far from alone in feel
ing that "basic research in sci

ence arid technology . . . must
be considered in terms of the
needs and the welfare of the
whole nation, and this means
the federal government.
Whatever one's views may be
on 'big government,' the fact
remains that whether or not
the United States has a re
search program adequate for
its security and for its
economic aspirations and
adequate to meet the chal
lenge of Russia, depends on
the federal government. In this
situation, where science and
technology are so vital to the
national welfare, universities
have acquired new impor
tance."
But in 1954, the military con
sumed nearly 60 percent of
Santa Clara County's industrial
output. In 1959 the San lose
News reported that "the North
County's technical industry is
characteristically dependent
on military projects (and) very
few of the firms are engaged in
production of consumer
goods." This meant that the
strong approbation for the
government's bellicose incli
nations would turn to trepida
tion as soon as the shifting for
tunes of politics caused even a
minor perturbation in the flow
of funds from Washington. In
addition, at a time when Santa
Clara County's busy
electronics-missile-space in
dustry will be grossing more
than $2 million a day, the end
of the Cold War was feared as a
"potential threat to the
boom." In a situation where
the price of prosperity is per
petual fear and paranoia, and
even a modest belt-tightening
on the part of the Pentagon
could lead to large-scale lay
offs, many people began to
question the fiscal wisdom of
waging technological war
against the USSR.
The uncertain flow of gov
ernment money to University
and industry, the directions in
which that flow tended to push
University researchers, the
dominance of science and
technology over the arts and
letters fostered by the unba
lanced distribution of federal
funds, the vested interest in
prolonging the Cold War
created by heavy dependence
on defense contracts — all
these brought the voices of the
University, industry and soci
ety into momentary harmony.
Together they called for the
diversion of talent and funds
away from weapons develop
ment and production and their
reapplication to the country's
great social problems.
I A /ho foresaw in that spring
r rand summer of 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about
civil rights? Who foresaw that in
so short a time these problems
would impinge so forcefully on
the American dream of "liberty
and justice for all?" The olid
order has indeed changed,
yielding place to the new, and
we probe and ponder ways of
dealing with the new.
It is not surprising that this
probing and pondering goes
on in a university. That is after
all, part of a university's pur
pose and mission. The modern
university is not insulated from
the world and its affairs.
Among the university's persis
tent problems is this one: How
to respond effectively to socie
ty's increasing demands that
the university become in
volved in the affairs of the
world while preserving that de
tachment and independence
which are essential to its free
pursuit of learning.
Dr. J.E. Wallace Sterling gave
utterance to those words in

1968, shortly before stepping
down from the University's
presidency. The 'probing and
pondering' to which he refer
red had taken a wide variety of
forms during the decade pre
ceding, all the time becoming
more insistent, less easily al
layed. In the years which fol
lowed, agitation for change
became more intense still and,
at its extreme, aspired not only
to modify both the old and new
orders alike, but to destroy
them outright.
A new war had fractured the
brief unanimity of opinion re
garding the University's place
in the country, and the coun
try's place in the world. The
post-war order had grown
prosperous from a certain ap
proach to the world, and for a
short time, it had appeared wil
ling and eager to change that
approach in order to assure the
continuation not only of its
prosperity but also its self
image as an agent of good. The
old order seemed to reason
thus: we have found the for
mula of success in the addition
of a strong, centralized, active
government to the basic tools
of free enterprise and democ
racy. There is every reason to
believe that this formula will be
proof against all the ills of the
world. If the Communists will
cease to threaten the subjuga
tion of the human race, then
we should embark on the
world's salvation — starting of
course, at home, but with a
benevolent eye on the under
privileged everywhere.
The war in Indochina, how
ever, looked distressingly
much like the long-feared start
of the Communist bid for univ
ersal hegemony and so the old
approach was given a new
lease on life. But the new vision
had come too far in the world
to fade away peaceably. A new
generation, numerically strong
and without a direct monetary
stake in preserving the war in
dustry, was arriving on college
campuses to champion the
new order. It was a force fired
by the spirit of righteous re
form and the vision of global
unity. With ominous accuracy,
one faculty member at Stan
ford described the freshmen of
1967 as "extraordinarily com
petent, hard-working, and al
most too well behaved." In
short, it was a force of con
sequence, and with the poten
tial to explode.
//"The progress of the '50s
I continued to a degree in
the early '605," Dr. Sterling told
me, "but with the outbreak
and escalation of the Viet
namese War, what was
euphemistically called 'social
unrest' developed. Contem
poraneously, there was the
strong development of the civil
rights movement. My own
son-in-law went to Selma,
Alabama and was thrown into
the jug and beaten up. I don't
know what future historians
will say. If it had just been the
war, or just civil rights . . . but
the two together intensified
the social unrest. Things got
out of hand. It was a rough time
world-wide — sit-ins in Tokyo,
and the Free University in Ber
lin. Weweren'tthe only ones. I
don't know how to evaluate
the results of the anti
establishment movement. The
establishment was blamed for
so much: the war, injus
tice. . .
More specifically, in the
words of journalist and essayist
John Walsh: "A revisionist
view of the (University's) ex
pansion was put forward based
on assertions that Stanford's
links with the federal govern
ment and industry had per
verted the University and that
the very growth of the institu
tion was proof of the perver
sion. The radical analysis at



Stanford led to insistence that
the University cease not only
all classified research but all
'war research.' The University
was accused of conducting
'counterinsurgency' research
against people in underde
veloped nations and against
minority groups in the United
States."
Dr. Sterling is generally cre
dited with a knack for discern
ing subtle currents of change
before they become mass
movements. His reputation in
this area rests in part on the fact

that he began to include stu
dents in some phases of Uni
versity policy-making in the
late 19505, before the students
themselves felt much need for
such participation. Dr. Sterl
ing's clairvoyance acquired ex
treme significance several
years later when the banner of
social conscience was hoisted
on campus and the clamor for
new University policies be
came tumultuous. For by then,
the concept of student and fa
culty input into matters which
had once been the exclusive
concern of the administration
was institutionalized. It
seemed a safe bet that the
more extreme advocates of the
new order could be headed off
by the formation of commit
tees to examine the Universi
ty's relationship to itself and
the rest of society. Thus SES, or
the Study of Education at Stan
ford, was born in 1967. More
than 200 individuals from all
phases of University life con
tributed in some way to the
study, and over the course of a
year it developed into an in
tense, all-encompassing effort
of introspection.
The results of the study are
contained in 10 thin volumes,
one of which is concerned with
teaching and research at Stan
ford. Some of the conclusions
in a chapter entitled, "Gov
ernment and University Re
search" gave support to those
who believed the University's
image to be tarnished. At the
start of the chapter, the au
thors state that "on the whole
our conclusions are that the
net effects of federal support
of University research are
favorable . . . (but) at the same
time we recognize certain
hazards in overdependence of
the University upon the gov
ernment for research sup
port. . .
An excerpt from a speech by
Sen. William Fulbright (D-Ark.)
brings a focus to the authors'
reservations: "The universities
might have formed an effective
counterweight to the military
industrial complex by
strengthening their emphasis
on the traditional values of our
democracy, but many of our
leading universities have in
stead joined the monolith, ad
ding greatly to its power and
influence. . . ."
Thus the authors conclude,
"The subcommittee finds it dif
ficult to give any complete
answers to such questions as
'Are we keeping research in
proper balance with our teach
ing function?' or 'What impact
does the research we do have
on society?'... It believes that
at present the University can
not be said to have a research
policy, but rather that the re
search now being done . . .
appears to be largely the result
of a sequence of historical ac
cidents. . . . The committee
also notes recent widespread
criticism of the result of this
laissez faire. On the negative
side: many persons believe
that much is done in the name
of the University that would

not be done if the faculty had
been consulted before insti
tutes and projects were begun;
they further feel that some of
these projects may or could
derogate from the good name
of the University by associating
it with forms of applied re
search that are either irrelevant
to the traditional primary con
cern of academic institutions
or concern activities of a
primarily military, intelligence
or propagandist nature. On the
positive side: the committee
believes that there are many
areas of social relevance in

which the University could
make a valuable contribution if
an effective instrumentality for
initiating such work were set
up."
Still, SES and other attempts
at institutionalized reform
were not able to stem the tide
of campus militancy at Stan
ford, and a series of sit-ins,
demonstrations, violent
clashes and acts of vandalism
disturbed the University's
peace well into the present de
cade. A conversion to the new
order seemed to be taking
place at a snail's pace, if at all,
despite such statements of
bravado as the claim in 1969 by
a student activist that "We're
shutting down the Pentagon of
the West."
In 1970, Science magazine
reported that "about two-fifths
of the manufacturing jobs in
the state (of California) are in
defense-related industries,
arid in Santa Clara County,
three-fifths of all jobs in man
ufacturing or about 70,000
people are in defense or space
work."
Later in the same article, the
author points out that the
college-trained professional's
"education and development
in his profession represent a
national investment." He con
tinues, "The value of work in
defense and space industries
has been under sharp attack
from some quarters, but there
can be little argument that the
talents of unemployed aeros
pace and electronics profes
sionals constitute a national re

source which is largely going to ;
waste. By and large there are •
no mechanisms to use their ta- !
lents to help solve environ
mental and social problems."
In 1971, the Stanford Work- !
shop on Political and Social Is
sues released a report which
charged that "Stanford's fiscal ;
policies, combined with the >
DOD's (Department of De- 1
fense) well-managed program
of supporting research and de-«
velopment with high military
potential, have skewed the
academic development of sig
nificant portions of the Univer-

sity, particularly engineering,
applied physics and computer
science." J
And in 1973, a group of law
and business students formed
the Citizens Conversion*
Committee, an organization*
whose express purpose was to
convince leaders of Santa Clara-
County industry that contract-?
ing with the Department of De
fense was not good business — ■
an idea which had first become"
current a decade and a half be-"
fore.
The wave of change moved
on, however. Some people*
feel that the conditions which
produced the social unrest
have been ameliorated; others*
feel that the student move-"
ment toppled under its own;
weight, or died some other*
natural death; still others per-2
ceive the inevitability of such
flux under any circumstances*
— it is simply the nature of the
age. ;
Dr. Snyder expressed this"
sentiment toward the end of«
my conversation with him. "I»
have often thought that I've*
lived too long," he told me/
"Because one of the things that
has been coming to my think-C
ing in recent years is that you'
have to have lived in an era to
understand what was going on.
You can be very critical of the,:
past if you haven't experienced
it. But if you know the facts,
then you understand that the.
climate of opinion at any time
molded our actions. It's a little
unfair to thrust our own pre
sent situation back into the,
past."
