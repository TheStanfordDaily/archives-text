# Stanford University: the rise to prominence and the fall from innocence
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
Once upon a time, life was
simple, good and bad
were clearly defined and Stan
ford University was a small but
honest institution of higher
learning. Free enterprise,
democracy, the United States,
industry and a college educa
tion were all considered emi
nently worthwhile things. Few
people doubted that what was
good for an American univer
sity was good for America was
good for the world.
Then a world war occurred.
Ripples of change which had
been lapping at the pilings of
habit and tradition were
gathered by that event into a
great wave of innovation,
transformation and renova
tion. Most of the swimmers in
the sea of human endeavor did
not see the wave coming. It
caught them unawares, as they
paddled randomly about, and
it gave them several bad mo
ments of disorientation as they
struggled against its uncon
trollable surge. A very few
swimmers, however, spotted
the swell before it had
gathered much momentum.
They were able to point them
selves in the wave's direction
of advance and take a few
strokes before it was upon
them. The most adept among
them caught the full force of
the wave and used it to their
advantage. Within this latter
group was Stanford University.
Placed by luck and foresight in
the perfect position to catch
the swell, Stanford rode the
crest as few others were able
to, now catching an especially
fast burst forward, now hang
ing back to avoid a hazardous
obstacle.
As the wave rolled on, life
lost its simple character. Good
was mixed with bad into a froth
of confusion. Stanford Univer
sity was no longer small norun
impeachably honest. Free en
terprise, democracy, the Un
ited States, industry and a col
lege education had become
debased in value. And the sim
ple equation lost its force for
many people: what was good
for an American university may
or may not have been good for
America; what was good for
America was obtained at the
expense of the rest of the
world.
Even now Stanford sits atop
the wave's crest as it crashes
into the future. The character
of life, the quality, the per
ceived integrity of the Univer
sity are still influx. New values,
new equations flourish and
wither according to uncom
prehended laws. And if we
want to make any sense of the
future, historians tell us, we
must examine the past.
Given the magnitude of the
changes which have oc
curred over the last 40 years, it
is perhaps surprising how eas
ily the old Stanford, the small
but-honest institution of
higher learning, is conjured up
out of the memories of the
alumni, administrators and fa

culty members who were ac
quainted with the University
before the second world war.
One man whose recollections
include experiences both as a
student and as a teacher is Rix
ford Snyder. At present the di
rector of alumni attitude re
search, Dr. Snyder's involve
ment with Stanford started in
1926 when he enrolled as a
freshman. Ten years after
graduating, he took his docto
rate in history, and joined the
History Department's faculty.
Following the war, he was
asked by President J.E. Wallace
Sterling to take charge of the
fledgling Admissions Office.
Recalling his early days at

Once upon a time, life was simple,
good and bad were clearly defined,
and Stanford University was a small
institution of higher learning. Then
there was a war, and there were
changes .

Stanford, Dr. Snyder told me
recently: "In 1926 it was a diffe
rent world — transportation
wise, economically. A different
world and a more stable one
perhaps. Students didn't go
great distances to college in
those days. I think even among
the undergraduates at Stanford
at that time, the idea of a na
tional reputation wasn't really
much of a concern. In 1926,
Stanford was considered to be
a very fine regional university.
In our thinking it was the best
on the Pacific Coast and that
was as far as our thinking went.
In no way did we think of rank
ing Stanford with Harvard or
Princeton or Yale or MIT.
"After I became Dean of
Admissions I learned a lot
about past admissions. I think
it's fair to say that all the men
candidates who applied in the
'20s who had B averages or bet
ter and had good strong re
commendations were admit
ted. This was not true for the
girls. There were sometimes as
many as four or five candidates
for each place. But then there
was a period in the '30s during
the depression years when
even the basic minimum was
bent because they were
scratching for students."
A man whose experiences
with pre-World War II Stanford
include not only those of stu
dent and teacher, but adminis
trator as well, is Frederick Ter
man. From the time it was first
heard on campus some years
before the First World War
until his retirement in 1965,
Terman's name assumed ever
increasing importance in the
University's affairs. He began
his professional career teach
ing radio engineering in the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment, went on to become head
of that department and even
tually Dean of the School of
Engineering. He finally became
Provost and Vice President of
the University under Wallace

Sterling.
Dr. Terman has been, by his
own account, in residence at
Stanford longer than anyone
else, having been absent for
only two relatively brief
stretches since 1912. I asked
him not long ago about his
early recollections of Stanford
and he said: "Of course the
University was very much smal
ler then — physically, the size
of the student body, the size of
the faculty. Most of the faculty
lived on the campus and the
academic setup was smaller.
"We had a good general
reputation. We were well re
garded but not as a great scho
larly institution. But a nice

place for a school. We did have
a number of people, just a li
mited number, who were well
regarded and we had a few
points of national distinction.
But it wasn't a star-studded fa
culty the way Harvard's was."
The fortunes of Stanford
were at a low ebb in the
years preceding and during
World War 11. The depression
had occurred at a time when
the young University was just
starting to feel confident in its
future. The crash of '29 in
flicted many types of doubts on
many types of individuals, by
no means the least of which
were those pertaining to
money. The University's en
dowment began to look smal
ler and smaller and income
from the handful of other
sources which existed at that
time — tuition, private philan
thropy, bequests — reflected
the hard times. The lack of
ready funds not only prohi
bited expansion of the Univer
sity facilities, but also limited
the maintenance of those al
ready in existence. The lib
raries began to fall behind in
acquisitions; the science and
engineering laboratories were
unable to acquire new equip
ment. Faculty morale began to
suffer and enrollment dipped
ominously.
When the War came, it put
the country back on its feet but
did little for Stanford. As Fre
derick Terman, who was ab
sent for the duration, was later
to write: "Stanford emerged
from World War II as an un
derprivileged institution. It
had not been significantly in
volved in any of the exciting
engineering activity associated
with the war. Although the
klystron tube had been in
vented at Stanford in 1937 by
Russell Varian, this activity
moved east in early 1941. As a
result, when (I) returned to
Stanford in January 1946 to take

over as Dean of Engineering, (I)
started from scratch, without
forward momentum."
Where did Dr. Terman go at
that critical juncture in Stan
ford's history, when the vigor
of his alma mater was on the
decline; when the same forces
that were challenging an entire
country were testing the Uni
versity's resources as they had
never been tried before; when
the need for dynamic leader
ship was in such clear demand ?
"I fought the war as a Har
vard man," he told me. "I was
asked to organize a research
project — countermeasures
against enemy radar. But when
I was there I got to know the
Harvard setup pretty well. I
learned a lot from Harvard.
How they did things and why
they did things. Many of the
procedures were different at
Harvard than any other school
and I learned why. The trea
surer of Harvard was my boss
and he lived right across the
street from us. We were close
personal friends."
The location of Dr. Terman's
loyalties, however, was never
seriously in doubt. He had
gone to Harvard because that
was where he could be most
useful to his country. Even be
fore the conclusion of the hos
tilities, he said, he knew he
would be going back to Stan
ford. "I was appointed Dean of
the Engineering School, to take
office when I returned," he
told me. "So I knew what my
responsibilities were going to
be a year or so ahead of time. I
thought about the situation in
the School of Engineering and
concluded that there would be
a post-war continuation of the
war research. I walked across
the street to my neighbor —
the treasurer of Harvard — and
asked him. And Harvard in its
usual way — they had already
been discussing the subject for
some time. They had arrived at
their post-war policies. So I
learned how Harvard was
going to deal with this. I had
lots of friends at MIT and I
nosed around there. I found
that everyone in Cambridge
agreed that there was going to
be a continuation of the Uni
versity research that had been
so valuable to the military."
For those of us who have
grown up in a world in which
large-scale government spend
ing is one of the given condi
tions of life, in the same rank as
death and taxes, the revolutio
nary nature of federally
supported research is hard to
appreciate. Writing retrospec
tively, 17 years later, Dr. Ter
man explained the reasoning
which led him to perceive a de
velopment which many other
shrewd men missed: "As the
end of the war approached, it
was clear that the government
would support this research in
universities for two main
reasons: the war effort involv
ing university scientists had
paid off handsomely in radar,
proximity fuses, rocket and jet
propulsion, the atom bomb,
etc., and the continuation of

such defense-related research
was necessary to maintain our
future military position. Even
then one could see a troubled
world ahead."
The result of his foresight,
Dr. Terman told me, together
with the contacts he had made
at Harvard, "was that Stanford
got really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every
other university in the country
in this research activity."
Enter Dr. J.E. Wallace Sterl
ing. A Canadian by birth, Dr.
Sterling received his B.A. at
McGill and arrived at Stanford
in 1930 to work on his Ph.D. He
stayed for eight years, assisting
at what was to become the
Hoover Institution and lectur
ing in the History Department
in addition to studying for his
doctorate. He held a variety of
jobs during the War and was
chosen for the University pres
idency in 1949.
As soon as he took office, Dr.
Sterling said in a speech he
gave shortly before stepping
down from the Presidency in
1968, he devoted himself to
improving the University's fi
nancial condition. He was con
siderably aided in this en
deavor by the new prosperity

character of life, the quality, the per
ceived integrity of the University are

vious characteristics of the
wave of change. Government
research contracts — which
Dr. Sterling called "a hidden
form of federal aid" — were
coming in such numbers that
the faculty of some depart
ments were able to pick and
choose among a large variety.
In 1963, Princeton University
won a ruling from the New Jer
sey Supreme Court which held
that corporations could give
money to educational institu
tions without risking sharehol
der's suits. The decision was to
have a particularly beneficial
effect on Stanford since a
number of local corporations
were becoming increasingly
grateful to the University and
were increasingly in a position
to show their gratitude in dol
lars and cents.
And then there was the ques
tion of Stanford's land. Until
Dr. Sterling took office, very
little had been done to develop
the erstwhile ranch beyond the
construction of academic
buildings. The first step to
exploit its economic potential
was taken in 1951 when the
master plan for the Stanford
Industrial Park was drawn up.
During the next two decades
one project after another was
undertaken to make the land
more economically productive
— including the Stanford
Shopping Center and a handful
of housing complexes. Income

from rents and leases is par
ticularly valuable since its use
is wholly unrestricted. Thus
the $1 million or so which is
derived annually from Indust
rial Park leases makes an im
portant contribution in balanc
ing the University's budget.
Finally, and most signific
antly, was a Ford Foundation
matching grant program
which, under the inspiring ac
ronym PACE (Plan for Action
for a Challenging Era), brought
the University $115 million and
the closest thing to long-lasting
financial security it had known
since the turn of the century.
The breakneck surge which
Stanford had experienced
on the wave of progress during
the '50s had abated somewhat
by the early 19605, but had left a
heady sense of accomplish
ment and a feeling of unlimited
promise in its wake. The shoals
which were soon to make the
going rough were not yet in
view; the only sights which of
fered themselves for contem
plation were the myriad mar
kers of success.
One particularly conspicu
ous set of such markers were
the objective measurements of
student quality. In 1954, the
most impressive fact the Uni-

versity News Service could
muster with regard to that
year's incoming freshmen was
that a third of them "made an
'A' average in high school, and
every last one of them was ac
tive in extra-curricular student
affairs." In 1963, however, the
News Service reported that "60
young women with straight-A
high school records" were on
the waiting list for the follow
ing fall's freshman class and
"the median grade point aver
age (for those admitted) is 3.8
for men and 3.9 for women."
An executive assistant to the
President lamented the fact
that although the University
was selecting "from the top
five percent of the nation's
high school graduates, (it was)
able to enroll only one out of
five applicants."
"When I first went into ad
missions," Dr. Snyder told me,
explaining the dramatic
metamorphosis in the student
body, "there were barely
enough candidates — enough
qualified candidates — to rill
the class. Well, it helped a lot
when the birth rate picked up.
But just as important, I think,
was the fact that we began a
conscious program for the first
time of seeking to get candi
dates from all over the United
States. When I first went into
admissions, about 72 percent
of all students came from
California. By the time I left, it

was below 50 percent. So we
did do, I think, a very satisfac
tory job in attracting not only a
very diverse student body
geographically, but also in at
tracting obviously better stu
dents."
Things were looking equally
bright in the graduate schools.
In 1961, the News Service re
ported that "the University's
continuing effort to recruit top
talent from all sections of the
country has reaped an espe
cially rich harvest from Har
vard, Princeton and Yale —
traditionally regarded as the
country's top three prestige
colleges."
On the faculty front too,
great inroads had been made.
Quantitatively, the number of
faculty members above the
rank of instructor rose from 615
in 1960 to 729 just three years
later. Qualitatively, the $100
million plus raised by the PACE
program put Stanford by 1963
in "a position where it can now
compete for faculty with the
best universities in the coun
try," according to a member of
the administration at that time.
Average faculty salaries were
among the top 10 nationally, he
said, and "very close to the first
five."
Another conspicuous set of
success markers was the na
tional rankings of university
departments conducted by the
American Council on Educa
tion. In 1925, Stanford placed
only two departments —
psychology and geology —
among the top 10 in the coun
try. By 1957, that number had
risen to five and in 1964 it had
gone up six-fold to 12.
Economics had gone from fif
teenth to a tie for fourth to
sixth; psychology from
seventh to fifth to second; and
physics from thirteenth to sixth
to fifth.
All of these positive
signposts were doubtless very
welcome, but the measure of
success most likely to inspire
the University's stewards with
a full-bellied feeling of satisfac
tion was the exponential in
crease in gifts and bequests. As
recently as 1943, the annual
total of donations was less than
$1 million and in 1950, it failed
to exceed $2.5 million. Shortly
thereafter, though, a scarcely
believable acceleration began:
in 1956, nearly 12,000 con
tributors donated more than
$10.5 million; in 1963, Stan
ford's coffers were enriched to
the tune of $38.5 million, the
largest such sum received by
any private University in the
country that year. Harvard was
firmly relegated to second
place, a full $2.5 million be
hind.
The most conspicuous suc
cess marker of them all,
however, occupies an area in
excess of one hundred square
miles. Known as the "Silicon
Valley," this particular marker
consists of the thousand or so
"pioneering technology com
panies" which Fortune
