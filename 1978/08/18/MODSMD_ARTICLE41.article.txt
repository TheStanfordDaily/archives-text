# A 						conversation with President Richard Lyman
## 
### John Nielsen 
Richard Lyman has been
President of Stanford Univer
sity since 1970. He is also cur
rently a trustee of the Roc
kefeller foundation, a
member of the National
Council for the Humanities, a
member of the National
Committee on United
States-China relations, vice
chairman of the National As
sociation of American Uni
versities, and a Trustee of the
Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching.
Needless to say, each of these
positions carries with it a bur
den of reading, travel, speak
ing, arguing, confronting and
what-not - Lyman admits to
being "a bit overcommitted at
the moment," as many of his
jobs could do with 24-hour a
day attention and still require
further effort.
Yet the most striking thing
about President Lyman is his
ability to forcefully address
every issue even remotely
connected with education on
a moment's notice. It is all but
impossible to catch the man
off guard, and verbal mistakes
are unheard of; without a
doubt this power to articulate
is Lyman's greatest strength.
Occasionally, to some minds,
this eloquence is used to
avoid answering inopportune
questions, or to anaesthesize
answers, but more often it
simply makes a strong posi
tion seem invincible.
The ability to deal with un
expected and expected-but
difficult questions, and to
think in what appear to be
several paragraph segments -
it probably had much to do
with Lyman's selection as
President of the University,
and certainly weighs consid
erably with successes at
tained therein.
Last month President
Richard Lyman met with the
Daily to address some issues
of major concern here - what
follows is from a tape record
ing of the conversation that
ensued:
You said once that "a Univer
sity of our size and complexity
will never achieve the sense of
intellectual community of the
best liberal arts colleges."
What did you mean by thati
I think in the best liberal
arts colleges — Swarthmore,
Hereford, Bryn Mawr,
Amherst, Reed, Williams —
there is a coherence of the
entire community that cannot
exist in a University of this
size and complexity. I guess I
feel that especially strongly
because I went to one of the
best liberal colleges (Swar
thmore; BA '47), and it was a
very intense experience. I
won't say that every student
at Swarthmore college in the
forties was a serious intellec
tual, but an amazingly high
percentage at least tried to
be, and it was the fashionable
thing to do so. I can re
member some complaints
that the good, honest C stu
dent was not appreciated.
There are also drawbacks in
that kind of a liberal arts col
lege — it tends to be intros
pective, isolated, and some
times is a bit complacent
about itself. That can get a lit
tle precious at times. And I
also think that a good Univer
sity tends to have more intel
lectual excitement, if you
want to look for it. Now,

many Stanford students don't
want to look for it, but I'm
always impressed by those
who do.
The ASSU Senate and Council
of Presidents here have often
been criticized as having no
power. Recently you decided
to bypass an ASSU boycott of
the Committee on Investment
Responsibility by randomly
selecting students to serve on
it. Would you say that this deci
sion damages the credibility of
student governmenti
It might have, but I would
also say that the boycott dam
aged the image of the ASSU
Senate to some extent ... I
certainly don't think the
episode taken as a whole was
good for student govern
ment. It seemed like a move
made by a student govern
ment that lacked confidence
in its ability to take reasona
ble or interim steps. I think it
sort of advertised the difficul
ties the Senate had in exercis
ing the influence it wanted to
have. It brought on our sys
tem of random selection be
cause we felt we were on the
horns of a dilemma, and that
it had been the intent of the
ASSU Senate to put us there.
We were left with two alterna
tives. One way was to have no
students. The other was to do
something like we did. The
best judgment we could mus
ter was that it was better to
have students than not to
have them.
Do the COP and Senate fulfill a
role that justifies their exis
tence?
I assume the reason why (a
group of students have taken
the position that the Senate
ought to be abolished, and all
power given to the ASSU). . .
involved a realization that
student government does
serve some important pur
poses, and if we didn't have
one we'd have to invent
it. . . . Perhaps the most ob
vious of those purposes from
the administration's
standpoint is providing the
mechanism for student rep
resentation on University
committees of all sorts, but
there are many others of im
portance. . . . I see it more as
a move aimed at the seeming
inability of successive years
of ASSU Senates to do more
than pass rhetorical resolu
tions than a move aimed at
doing away with student gov
ernment completely. It cer
tainly would focus a lot of re
sponsibility on a few people.
But I know at colleges where
student government has
been abolished there has
been a fair amount of diffi
culty in trying to find ways in
which the administration and
sometimes the faculty could
relate to organized or unor
ganized studentdom.
This last May the trustees voted
in favor of a shareholder's re
solution recommending attack
ing corporations whose deal
ings in South Africa had been
exceptionally below par. Does
that type of decision indicate
that the Trustees have made a
final compromise with the de
mands of those favoring di
vestment? If this is true, how
will thi' trustees deal in the fu
ture with what recent events
have indicated is a considera
ble amount of student concern
with South Africa?
I think, and I can only
speculate about this, as we

don't have enough hard evi
dence to tell — I have the dis
tinct impression that, on the
South African issue, a reason
why last year did not produce
anything like the huge de
monstrations of the previous
year was that many more stu
dents have decided that in
deed the issues are rather
complex.
I think the Trustees clearly
last year undertook to judge
each proxy issue individually.
Of course when you begin to
do that you begin to make re
ferences back and forth
among the things you've
done. As a committee talks
about it they're going to say
"Well now remember the
case of X company, we did
such and such." So its never
completely the case that you
came to each proxy de novo,
as if that was the first proxy in
this area you had ever seen.
But I think that they were
making a fairly genuine effort
to make individual judgments
rather than produce a policy
juch as was voted by a major
ity of the CIR, for example,
that barring exceptionally
meritorious records of be
havior in South Africa, a cor
poration ought to be asked to
withdraw. The trustees didn't
make a generalization like
that. They didn't make the
contrary generalization,
either, exactly, although that
was pretty much how their
votes seemed to add up. I
can't predict what they are
going to do — how the trus
tees will judge things this
year. Several other Univer
sities have published policy
statements of varying de
grees of specificity, but I can't
predict whether our trustees
will want to do that. Perhaps
they will feel that we have
been dealing with these is
sues long enough, that it
would be useful to try and
make some kind of sum
marizing statement that
another University has made
... I can see that there might
be some advantage in that,
because I think last year the
trustees had a hard time get
ting across the fact that they
were in fact doing things. It
was relatively easier than it

should have been to charac
terize their behavior as sim
ply non-responsive.
Do you think that the height of
student activism has passed?
That's very hard to say . . .
as the memory of a year ago
last May begins to fade (Ed:
294 students were arrested in
an Old Union sit-in at that
time) . . . then I suppose its
entirely possible that the
pendulum could swing back
toward a greater willingness
to take part in more dramatic
action. I've never been a very
good prophet as to the future
trends of what is sometimes
called student activism — I
wish there were a better
phrase than that; it seems to
me that there are all kinds of
varieties of student activism
— I don't think that I or most
other University Presidents
have been any good at
prophesying those things.
But then on the other hand
neither have the student
leaders been very good
prophets. Several times all of
us have expected things to go
in a direction they didn't go.
Stanford is currently re
examining its position towards
the study of the Humanities -
one of the results of this re
examination will apparently
involve a reinstitution of a
Western Culture requirement.
How soon will such changes be
institutedi
The clock is supposed to be
running towards the year
after next on Western Cul
ture. Next year is supposed to
be . . . the year in which
some courses are tried out,
so to speak, and developed,
and judgment as to whether
there will be a requirement
and what its exact terms will
be will await until after there
has been some chance to see
those courses in action.
Would you tell us a little more
about what to expect? Is there a
particular direction in which
the study is headed?
Well the Faculty Senate's
original resolution declared
its intent to move toward a
requirement in the history of
Western Culture — they pur
posely left it quite unclear
whether this meant a single
course everyone would take,

or a group of courses from
which you would select, or a
range of things already in the
curriculum which would
somehow qualify, and so on.
And they've been trying tc
come to grips with those
kinds of questions (ever
since). We seem now to be
headed in the direction —
partly for financial reasons,
and partly for reasons of edu
cational philosophy — of a set
of courses that are given the
seal of approval as courses by
the taking of which you com
plete the Western Civilization
requirement. But even that
will require the development
of some courses that didn't
exist.
Does it seem to you that there is
support building for changes
beyond these, such as the
reinstitution of a language re
quirement, or the institution of
stricter science requirements?
I haven't sensed much of
that. Obviously there's still
strong feeling in the language
departments about language
requirements, but I don't
sense much appetite for a lot
more extension of require
ments or specification of
them. I think one reason why
it has taken us so long to get
where we are now in relation
to the Western Culture re
quirement is that while the
faculty is not nearly as nerv
ous as students are about the
word "requirement," neither
is there a great enthusiasm
among the faculty for a great
increase in the requirements
for a student. I myself would
hate to see us get back to the
days of the so-called "green
sheet," when the require
ments were quite specific but
degenerated into an
arithmetical game, and there
was a lot of nervousness
about whether you got your
requirements for golfing be
fore you graduated. I don't
think we are in the mood to
go back to that.
It has been argued that a West
ern Civ requirement puts a far
greater burden on those in
terested in the sciences than
on, say English majors, who ap
parently can get by taking
something as broad as "physics

for poets." Do you agree with
that?
To the extent that that is
true, I would prefer to regard
it less as a question of equity
between engineers and
humanities majors. I think
that when you start to look at
education in that way you re
ally constrain yourself in an
undesirable way. Nobody
pretends that it is the same
kind of life here to be an En
glish major as it is to be an
Engineer major, and I don't
see any reason why it has to
be. But what's serious is the
undoubted fact that being
enumerate is much more
widespread than being illiter
ate, to use both terms slightly
hyperbolically. There is evi
dence that humanities majors
do in fact take less that is re
ally far afield from their major
than science majors do. And I
think that's true all through
society, and if you get to the
highest levels of scientific
achievement you often en
counter people who are very
broadly educated.
I'm concerned about the
apparent great difficulty of
getting people not in the sci
ences adequately serious ex
posure to the scientific
method, then, but I don't see
it as a problem of equity. I
don't think I have pat answers
for that question. (As for in
stituting stricter mathemati
cal and scientific require
ments) . . . I'm not really
clear that that is necessarily
the best answer. In the first
place I'm not certain in my
own mind that the way to get
greater awareness of the role
of science and the scientific
method is to force people to
take a full year of orthodox
science courses designed for
majors in the field. I keep
being intrigued by the notion
that it may make more sense
for the humanities or social
science majors to have an ex
posure to science policy or to
scientific impact on society,
and so forth and not worry
too much about whether. . .
well it will be interesting to
see whether pressure really
develops along that line. I ha
ven't heard of any from the
faculty yet. What will really
count is how many faculty are
willing to put their backs into
it — to what extent the de
partments will be willing to
see their faculty members
spend some of their time
teaching these classes and
count it as fully worthy activ
ity.
You've expressed considerable
concern over the expansion of
the part played by the federal
government in University af
fairs, indicating that we may be
headed toward something of a
crisis in that area. Last year, for
example, the Medical School
refused a federal grant because
it was contingent upon man
datory acceptance of certain
kinds of students. Do you ex
pect an increasing number of
incidents of this kind?
We really are quite heavily
dependent on federal monies
in many areas, particularly in
graduate education and re
search. And there is a limit to
how many self-abnegating
roles like that one we can take
and still have a program
strong enough to do the job. I
am worried about that,
maybe I am a little obsessed

at times, as it seems to me
that Congress and the state
legislatures have begun to
adop i style of approaching
real problems which is very
ominous; that is, to keep ex
panding the area of human
rights without providing re
sources with which to do that
which is implied by that ex
tension. The best example is
the handicapped regulations
(recently instituted). . . .
Very considerable burdens of
expenditure and effort and so
on have been placed upo all
institutions, and only a hand
ful of money has been given
out from Washington to help,
and that's a tactic which only
a society which still imagines
itself to be limitlessly rich can
afford to take on. Why should
every University and college
in the country be accessible
to all kinds of human hand
icapped? Granted, that any
human being with a handicap
ought to have accessible to
him or her education in all of
its various forms and levels,
but that needn't mean that
every college and every uni
versity be prepared for every
handicap. That sort of ap
proach seems to take place all
the time. There was just re
cently in Sacramento — so it's
not just a federal problem —
there was just recently in Sac
ramento a bill requiring col
leges and universities to have
a grievance mechanism for
every student who received a
failing grade, ora "marginally
passing grade," and the grie
vance procedure was spelled
out in some detail and would
have to involve outside ex
perts, and so on. So you can
just imagine what that would
have begun to entail, and yet
the procedure was seriously
proposed.
I do worry about that — it
is, paired with my worry
about tuition, my number
one concern.
Are the two concerns insepar
able? Is tuition rising because
of federal intervention?
No. It has nothing to do
with that. It is the strongly
held view in most states that
the public sector ought to be
either free or as close to free
as possible to all comers, and
the subsidizing of the private
sector goes on apace. Now
there may be some reversals
of that — Proposition 13, as it
hits the country, may push
the private sector in the direc
tion of higher tuition. I think
it is almost inevitable. So that
maybe something will hap
pen that slows the growth of
that (tuition) down. And ac
tually I prefer to see the
growth of the gap slowed by
providing more help to stu
dents who would want to go
to private sector institutions
than I would by seeing the
public sector raise it's prices
drastically, if only because
they're not usually all set up
where you're able to give
scholarship help. They've
lived on a tradition of low tui
tion and not very well de
veloped scholarship and fi
nancial aid offices. If they
suddenly have to shift to con
siderable tuition they may not
be able to develop their fi
nancial aid system adequately
to keep pace, as we have. We
and colleges like us have had
elaborate and expensive fi
nancial aid operations for a
long time.
