# The 						Gay People's Union
## An active alternative to the conventional wisdom 
### 
"I feel good that I go to Stan
ford. There's almost no op
pression here. It's a good place
to be gay."
P.hio Hiersch of Beatty, Nev.,
explains why Stanford pro
vides a supportive environ
ment for gay people. "Many
people like to be near to San
Francisco." (San Francisco is
acknowledged by gay-activist
and homophobe alike as "the
homosexual capital of the
world.") "And Stanford offers
an excellent education in addi
tion to a pleasant environ
ment."
Hiersch is one of 100 mem
bers of the Gay People's Un
ion, located near Tresidder
Union in the old firehouse.
"The Gay People's Union con
sists of three different groups.
There's the women's collec

tive, which meets Tuesdays at 8
p.m.; the men's social group,
meeting on Wednesdays at
8:30; and the student collec
tive, which meets Thursdays at
8 p.m."
According to Hiersch, the
Wednesday socials attract from
10 to 20 people, while the
Thursday meetings draw from
15 to 45. The GPU is "over
whelmingly male," he con
cedes. "Most lesbians prefer to
work within the women's
movement, finding it more re
warding and less sexist than
the gay liberation movement.
The GPU works hard to keep
women involved, bet some of
the members act sexist and
alienate them."
Freshmen at Stanford, as at
most colleges and universities,
have problems distinct from

those of upperclassmen.
"Freshmen," says Hiersch,
"are much more in the closet.
They haven't come to grips
with their own sexuality. They
remember the oppression of
high school, and are afraid to
come out." The GPU is making
a special effort to get freshmen
to join this year, Hiersch said.
"We want to make (the GPU)
look like an attractive place to
come where one can meet
people one's own age and with
similar interests."
The GPU also offers a social
alternative to the classic gay
milieu: the gay bar. Although
hundreds of gay bars exist in
the Bay Area, the GPU may
offer a more congenial atmos
phere for many, especially
those who do not drink or
smoke or are under 21.
Hiersch says that one prob

lem for gay people at the Farm
is an unwarranted fear of ostra
cism and oppression. "When I
came out," he said, "I ex
pected lots of harassment and
got none. People are afraid to
come out because they fear
oppression that isn't there."
This is especially true for
freshmen, he claims. "In my
freshmen dorm I knew at least
five other gay people, all very
much in the closet." Some of
them were afraid to be seen
with Hiersch after he came out
during his first year here.
Last year the GPU's agenda
was active: movies ("one that
was embarassingly porno
graphic," says Hiersch), talks, a
concert by lesbian singers and
dances. The GPU will hold a
meeting during freshman
orientation week; for informa
tion, call the GPU at 497-1488.
