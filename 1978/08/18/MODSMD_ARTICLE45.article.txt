## Education outside the classroom 
### 
"I never let my schooling in
terfere with my education."
Mark Twain said it, and what's
more, he was right. One of the
pitfalls of a rigorous academic
program is that formal
classwork is just that: work in
the classroom. And insofar as a
classroom is detached from the

real world, so an education
based on formal classwork
alone leads to a poor under
standing of reality.
The Office of Extra De
partmental Programs is there
to correct the potential imba
lance. Through four
programs sponsored by the
Dean of Undergradutate
Studies, the EDP has the
facilities to round out the
academic education of Stan
ford undergradutes. The four
programs range from research
opportunities to studen
initiated studies; from work in
the community to work in the
chemistry building.
The Student Center for In
novation in Research and Edu
cation is unique in that it does
not offer a specific roster of
courses. SCIRE offers, instead,
student-initiated individual or
group projects for credit. The
professional co-director, Maria
Chacon, notes that a fund of
$4,000 to help finance innova
tive ideas exists.
SCIRE's other main function
is to offer internships with cre
dit. In the winter, 1978 quarter
the following were included in
SCIRE's list: elementary educa
tion; the Sierra Club; the Palo
Alto city manager's office;
child care; adolescent counsel
ing; work for NASA in biomed
ical and enzyme research; so
cial work and voter education;

and community action. SCIRE
will publish a list of offerings
for the fall.
The Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities program
offers students a chance to do
professional research for a
Stanford professor in a number
of fields. The six general
categories under which re
search jobs are filled are: en
gineering, social sciences,
humanities, education/
psychology the physical sci
ences and biology/medicine.
Biology/medicine is the most
popular, drawing 3 tudents
in 1977-78. The total i .itnher of
research positions offered is
around 120. Credit is offered at
the rate of one unit per three
hours' work per week; "about
five percent of the positions
are paid," said program direc
tor Laura Selznick. Selznick, a
1468 graduate of Smith College
in Massachusetts, can be
reached at 497-3828.
Selznick is also in charge of
the Undergraduate Special
Program, a free university with
more legitimacy and backing
than most free universities
traditionally enjoy. The
courses in the USP (not to be
confused with United States
Pharmacopoeia) go "from here
to there and back again," to
quote a famous movie idol of
the twentieth century. That is,
they are large in number. Pos

sibilities for this fall include,
. but are not limited to, "Geol
ogy of the Grand Canyon,"
"Stock Options," "Urban In
dia," "The Corporation and
Society," "Jewish Biblical in
terpretation," and so forth.
Last spring saw "A New Citizen
Looks at the United States,"
"Advanced Speech Theory and
Practice," "Contraceptive
Counseling," "Landscape/The
Art of Watercolor Painting,"
"Life After Death: The Empiri
cal Evidence" ("Some know
ledge of psychic phenomena
may be helpful"), Italy from the
Unification to Fascism, "The
Detective Novel,"andsoforth.
Any student who wishes either
to teach a course or to have a
course taught should contact
Selznick.
The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues was
initiated by students in 1969.
The founders wanted to in
volve Stanford students in ac
tively investigating urgent so
cial arrd political problems.
SWOPSI's two fields of in
volvement are clinical place
ment and community action.
For example, SWOPSI work
shops planned for the fall in
clude working with excep
tional children; a
workshop on the role of
women in local government,
and teaching swimming to
handicapped children nearby.
