## Old and crusty Hal recalls the Band in days of yore 
### 
Editor's note: In addition to being one of the
more intelligent, humorous and good
natured persons on the face of the earth, Hal
Mikelson is the announcer for the Stanford
Band. Recently the Daily exposed Hal to a
tape recorder and attempted to capitalize on
his eloquence - what follows is an edited
account.
by John Nielsen
Daily: How do you work this thing?
Hal: Push P and R, and then ask if I think the
Band has changed.
Daily: P and R. Hmm. P and R . . . I think the
batteries are dead.
Hal: No that's not it. Put the tape in first.
Daily: I was supposed to bring a tape?
Hal: OK. Never mind. I'll do it myself . . .
there. Now, did you ask if thought the
Band had changed? Cood question. Yes, in
deed it did, and I'll tell about it.
The most visible change — if someone had
been in the Aleutians for six or eight years
and was just now returning — would be that
women are now members of the Band. In
the fall of '69 when I first became involved
with them that would have been incom
prehensible. In the fall of '69 the Band con
sisted of males, who used it as a substitute
for cold showers or for shooting baskets on a
Saturday night. It was a form of sublimation
— a male release of sexual tension. A night
out with the Band was a night out with the
boys, and I have to say that much of our
behavior today reflects that arrested stage of
development.
Daily: What?
Hal: I said, much of our behavior today re
flects that arrested stage of development,
which implies that women haven't had all
that radical an effect. I will elaborate. In a
way that is incomprehensible to me, women
have followed the old patterns of behavior,
even though the reasons for doing so no
longer exist. Because there are coed dorms
on campus, because the Band itself is coed,
because the Band does not consist of the
losers it consisted of when I was an under
graduate, the need for the kind of sublima
tion and release I have spoken of has rather
passed us by.
Daily: Is this on?
Hal: Still, some things have changed, be
haviorally speaking. For instance, in the old
days the Band was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and that is no
longer the case. In the old days a central
focus of activity was to guard the Band Shak
and, by extension, the campus in Big Came
week, as we had to keep the Cal weenies
from acts of vandalism. People then ran
around with walkie-talkies, or slept over
night in the Shak to keep the weenies from
breaking in and stealing things.

These days the Band frankly hasn't the time
for those kinds of activities. They've become
much more a part of the mainstream of cam
pus life, and in that sense they've become
part of the campus establishment.
That in itself is a turnaround. When I was a
freshman the campus establishment was the
Ax Comm (Axe Committee), which con
sisted of all these cashmere-sweater types
from La Jolla and Pasadena and Piedmont.
The Band got the turkeys and the slide-rule
carriers and bookish and retiring types (or
unbookish but nevertheless unsociable
types) who wouldn't have been part of the
social establishment.
Well, those fashionable folks are gone
now, and in their stead the Band — and I
hate to say it — has become the fashionable
establishment. The paramilitary types with
their walkie talkies are no longer, as alumni
rallies have taken their place.
Daily: Maybe I should get an extension
chord.
Hal: Perhaps some personal data would be
in order at this point.
I came to Stanford in the fall of '67, and
though I couldn't stand the taste of beer
when a freshman or sophomore and didn't
care much for bands or parties either (I was
more inclined than aything else to strut off to
the undergraduate library on a Friday or
Saturday night); despite all this I was a Band
groupie all along. During my junior year the
then-announcer, a fellow named Don Piatt,
was called away on a MacNamara Fellow
ship. I filled in, and that began an eight-year

association.
I can tell you that the first year I did it I was
of pretty poor quality — the whole first year I
didn't know how to work the microphone.
And I don't mean learning to speak into it for
greatest effect either, I mean working the
switch that turns it on. I had trouble holding
the switch open. . . .
Daily: Is there any more beer around here?
Hal: I really wouldn't know. I absolutely
never drink.
Daily: Shit.
Hal: That reminds me.
Marching into the Rose Parade certainly
ranks among great moments in Band his
tory. It provided the final proof of the advan
tages that accrue from being other than a
precision-oriented marching band. You see,
the predominant sensation one gets in the
Rose Parade is the sensation of following
horses — horses tht tend to leave tangible

and olifactory evidence of their passage be
hind them. Others had trouble, but we were
able to stride through the steaming mounds
with relative ease.
There are other memorble incidents, of
course — another of my favorites involves a
Band visit to Disneyland. As far as I know we
are no longer allowed within the confines of
thhe Magic Kingdom — they appear in
terested in catering to a more clean-cut au
dience — but we did hit it full force once.
After wandering around in knots of three
or four for the most part of the day, the
Bandsmen gathered at a relatively obscure
attraction called the Storybook Canal Ride.
Being a "g" or "h" ticket there wasn't much
competition, and when the young lady that
normally narrates the ride saw that she had
only Band people (and no real human be
ings), she turned the microphone over to
them.
I was then forced by peer pressure to take
the instrument into my humble and tremb
ling hands and thereupon to describe the
scenery from a slightly different perspective.
After all, when you consider Snow White
alone in the forest with seven dwarfs the
possibilities are really stagggering.
Daily: That's pretty funny. You must be
pretty funny up there in the press box.
Hal: In a way, perhaps, but the funniest an
nouncers to watch have been the middle
aged speech teachers who do halftimes for
such schools as Ohio State. As I recall, the
Ohio State band announcer dressed up in
grey militaristic Ohio State band regalia, in

eluding the big hairbrush on the front of his
cap, and he had an assistant tapping him on
the shoulder to cue him to talk. They also
tend to have gorgeous ring-bound
notebooks with graph paper diagramming
each formation. Also elegantly lyped scripts.
I enjoy watching that, even though I prefer
writing my script on the back of an envelope
sometime around a half hour before the
game starts.
