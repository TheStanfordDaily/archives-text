# PR man gives true facts
## LSJUMB concurs 
### 
(Editor's note: The following introduc
tion to the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band was written,
edited, and compiled by the public rela
tions lackey of that organization.)
Until 1963, the Band was strictly nor
mal. They marched in straight lines,
they kept the inside of their left feet on
the outer right edge of the hash marks,
the drum section wore clothes like
everybody else, and nobody painted
anything insulting on the bells of the
tubas. In short, they did everything cor
rectly, and were accorded due respect.
No one wrote hate mail, no one
threatened to bulldoze the University,
and no one withdrew multimillion dol
lar contributions already earmarked for
the medical school. The LSJUMB was a
class organization at that time — they
were a class organzation and a credit to
undergraduate education.
But everything changed in '63. In '63
the Band was taken over by zealots and
hoodlums, and by an occasional musi
cian. They went on strike at the begin
ning of the football seasoon, and the
University threatened initially to put the
whole crew to work in nearby coal
mines, but the zealots stuck by their
guns until the authorites submitted.
And now there are no straight lines.
There are no disappearing diamonds.
We do not play the theme from

"Rocky," or the theme from "Star
Wars." We do not play "You Light Up
My Life." Everything we do is sick, no
thing we do is tasteful, and some of us
drink and stay out doing god knows
what until very late at night. We go on
trips, and we do rallies late at night that
keep people out of law school. We go to
the Rose Bowl once or twice very several
hundred years, we make loud noises
when you least expect it, and we hate
USC, and we hate Cal.
We believe that you have secret un
fulfilled desires, that certain things in life
are very embarrassing, and that justice
is a kick in the groin. Remember when
you woke up, sweating in the night, do
you think that no one heard you
scream? When you turned your back on
the poor and oppressed, are you sure
that no one saw? You probably thought
you were escaping those things when
you came to Stanford, didn't you? You
thought that no one would catch on to
your little fetishes, your little whims,
your little sicknesses. You did, didn't
you?
Think again, Jack. We know who you
are. We know all about what you've
done, and where you've been, and next
Saturday we're going to put it on the
field in front of 50,000 people. You
won't forget us.
