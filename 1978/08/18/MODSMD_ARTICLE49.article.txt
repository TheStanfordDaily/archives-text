# Cardinal football '78
## It looks like it may be a high-flying season 
### Brad Brockbank 
To the millions of disciples who congre
gate at stadiums in Columbus, Birmingham,
South Bend and hundreds of other campus
towns across America every Saturday each
autumn, college football is religion. And at
Stanford, the main tenet of that faith is the
pass. The arms of such superb throwers as
Frankie Albert, John Brodie, Jim Plunkett
and Guy Benjamin have consecrated Stan
ford Stadium. As well, the faith has a new
high priest, Cardinal coach Bill Walsh.
John Ralston, the chief prelate for the pass
here during the 1960s and early '70s, led
Stanford to Rose Bowl triumphs in 1971 and
'72 using the passing gifts of Plunkett and
Don Bunce and an arsenal of receivers that
included Bob Moore, Randy Vataha and
John Winesberry. Ralston, however, de
parted to the NFL and Stanford settled down
to five seasons of ho-hum football.
Then Walsh arrived. An assistant to
Ralston at Stanford from 1963 to '75, Walsh
then spent 10 years honing his coaching
skills before returning to Palo Alto, this time
as the head man.
He transformed a team quagmired by a
continuing identity crisis at quarterback (no
one knew who he was) and sometimes inept
recruiting into a 9-3 Sun Bowl championship
squad ranked No. 15 in the nation.
Walsh and his staff have revitalized the
entire football program, but it is on offense
that Walsh has left his personal stamp. He
melded an unused wide receiver, a 168-
pound freshman and a Zen quarterback into
his multi-set, pro-style offense and emerged
with the seventh leading offense in the na
tion, an offense which rolled to 431.8 yards a
game.
In the three seasons before Walsh's arrival
here, quarterback Guy Benjamin bounced
between the starting lineup and the reserves
like a pinball, much to the chagrin of almost
everyone on the South Peninsula. But as
soon as Walsh set up shop in the second
floor of the brick building which houses the
Athletic Department, he made it clear that
Benjamin was his quarterback. Period. No
ifs. No buts. No maybes.
A consensus Ail-American, Benjamin led
the nation in passing last year but more im
portantly led the Cards to their best season
in six years. He now plies his trade for the
Miami Dolphins.
For three years James Lofton made quite a
name for himself on Stanford's track team.
He showed promise as a potential Olympic
medalist in the long jump. On the gridiron,
however, he was an anonymous quantity.
The previous coaching regime had seen fit to
let the 6-foot-3 speedster stagnate on the
bench. Walsh, however, immediately rec
ognized the unlimited potential of Lofton.
Before the season last year he said the suc
cess of the '77 team would in large part de
pend on the success of Lofton. Lofton
caught 53 passes for 12 touchdowns, includ
ing three game-winners. He now works for
the Green Bay Packers.
Stanford has been playing football since
Benjamin Harrison was President, but the
Cardinals had never had a runner rush for
1000 yards in one season. That didn't matter,
however, because the gospel of football ac
cording to Leland didn't mention the run.
But last year, lightning-quick Darrin Nelson
gave Stanford fans a dimension once re
served for USC partisans. Nelson not only
surpassed 1000 yards but snagged 50 passes
to become the first player in NCAA history to
accomplish both feats in the same season.
Nelson returhs this season. In fact he will
return twice again. One of only four starters
returning on offense, Nelson will be
counted on to provide the big play excite
ment he excelled at last year.
Nelson returns this season, and Walsh
says collegiate track experience has made
the explosive running back even faster. Al
though Nelson is one of only four starters
returning on offense, the defense returns
seven starters and Walsh says he believes
this year's team may be even better than the
1977 model.
"At some point," Walsh says, "our team
will be a real factor in the Pac-10. I don't
know if it will come early or not. I think this
year's team will be an improved team over
last year's. The problem is that our oppo
nents will be stronger also."
With the addition of Arizona and Arizona
State to the conference, the round robin
schedule was discontinued. This year each
team will play seven or eight conference
games. Under the old Pac-8 schedule, the
Cardinals would have faced anemic Oregon
at home. Instead of roasting the Ducks,
Stanford must travel to Tempe to play fanati

cal Frank Kush's Sun Devils.
"To play Arizona State on the road instead
of Oregon at home, it could be the differ
ence between a winning season and a losing
season or something along those lines,"
Walsh says. "By the time we play them, they
may be weak and Oregon may be strong, but
I kind of doubt that." The Arizona State
game is still a long way off (Nov. 11), how
ever, and Walsh has his mind on a myriad of
more immediate concerns. The Cards won
all six of their home games last season, a feat
last accomplished by the 1940 Wow Boys.
But this year Stanford hosts three '77 bowl
teams, all ranked among the top dozen
teams in the nation.
Stanford opens the season with Big Eight
champions Oklahoma Sooners. Four weeks
later the Cards open the Pac-10 season
against UCLA and then play defending Rose
Bowl champ Washington in Stanford
Stadium. The Huskies ran all over Stanford
en route to a 45-21 victory last year in a loss
which eventually kept the Cards out of the
Rose Bowl and the Huskies in.
UCLA ran all over Stanford, too, but the
Cards did some running of their own and
downed the Bruins, 32-28. Steve Dils, play
ing in the place of the injured Guy Benjamin,
passed for 287 yards against the Bruins, in
cluding the winning toss to Lofton, with 37
seconds remaining.
This year Stanford plays the Bruins in Los
Angeles. The Card quarterback this year will
be — guess who? — Steve Dils. Fullback Phil
Francis will team with Dils and Nelson in the
backfield. Wide receivers Lofton and Bill Kel
lar have departed for the pros, but Ken
Margerum, Andre Tyler and Vince Mulroy
will step in at flanker and split end and a trio
of veteran tight ends — Mitch Pleis, Pat
Bowe and Marty Smith — give Stanford an
awesome air strike capability. But with Nel
son and Francis in the backfield, Walsh says
he wants to concentrate more on the run
ning game this year.
"We could lead the nation in passing at
our choosing," Walsh says. "We could have
the best passing attack simply by throwing a
lot of passes — we execute quite well. But,
the only thing that really matters is the score,
so from a winning standpoint, we have to
run well."
"I think our best chance of having a suc
cessful year depends on our running game,"
he adds.
A shift to develop the running game will
not be the only change in the Stanford of
fense.
"We won't be quite as much a drop-back
oriented team as we were with Guy," Dils
says. "That's about all we did except for
play-actions. We didn't do much roll-action;
we will do more of that this year.
"Last season," he says, "we didn't go into
the year planning on having a Darrin Nelson

— we didn't know he'd be as good as he was.
This season, we know he's going to be great,
and Phil Francis is in better shape than he's
ever been in, so we'll run the ball a little bit
more than we have in the past."
Changes on the Stanford defense will be
less cosmetic. Last year Stanford's defense
was ranked ahead only of lowly Oregon. To
capitalize on a well of talent at linebacker,
The Cardinals have switched from a 4-3
alignment to the 3-4 set, current rage of the
NFL.
"Our defense will have more mobility and
excellent linebackers," Walsh says.
"Linebacker is the deepest position on the
team." Walsh says the Cards have seven
linebackers who can already play top col
legiate ball and are also developing some
more promising prospects.
Anchoring the linebacking corp will be
Gordy Ceresino who set a single season
Stanford record for tackles last year with 174.
Sophomores make up the remainder of the

starting linebacking unit with Steve
Budinger inside with Ceresino and Milt
McColl and Tom Hall slotted to start on the
outside.
Returning starters Dean Wilson and
Chuck Evans hold down the ends of the de
fensive line while sophomore Marty Fuentes
will start at nose guard.
"It's been a little trouble adjusting to the
3-4," Ceresino says. "I'm used to a 4-3. I'm a
middle linebackerat heart and that'sthe way
I like to play ball. But, we've run close to 60
practices in the 3-4, and I'm a linebacker, I
can adjust to it."
For the Cards, stopping the other teams
means stopping running backs such as
USC's Charles White, UCLA's Theotis
Brown and Washington's Joe Steele.
"What you want to do against runners like
that is to stop them before they get to the
line of scrimmage and break away," Cere
sino says. "That's the key to this defense —

not letting people cross that line of scrim
mage."
Opponents completed nearly 60 percent
of their passes against the Card defense last
year, but the Stanford staff hopes that the
secondary has been shored up with added
experience and speed. Junior Keith Bur
cham joins returning starters Savann
Thompson, Rick Parker and Robby Chap
man in the defensive backfield.
"Overall, I think we'll have a better de
fense this year, statistically," Walsh says,
"but it isn't really enough to say that,
though, because it wouldn't take much to
improve upon last year's statistics. But, we
should be markedly better on defense and
our defense will be in the top five in the
Pac-10. I expect our offense to be in the top
two."
An improved defense notwithstanding,
Stanford football in 1978 will still be just a
passing fancy.

Stanford to Rose Bowl triumphs in 1971 and
'72 using the passing gifts of Plunkett and
Don Bunce and an arsenal of receivers that
included Bob Moore, Randy Vataha and
John Winesberry. Ralston, however, de
parted to the NFL and Stanford settled down
to five seasons of ho-hum football.
Then Walsh arrived. An assistant to
Ralston at Stanford from 1963 to '75, Walsh
then spent 10 years honing his coaching
skills before returning to Palo Alto, this time
as the head man.
He transformed a team quagmired by a
continuing identity crisis at quarterback (no
one knew who he was) and sometimes inept
recruiting into a 9-3 Sun Bowl championship
squad ranked No. 15 in the nation.
Walsh and his staff have revitalized the
entire football program, but it is on offense
that Walsh has left his personal stamp. He
melded an unused wide receiver, a 168-
pound freshman and a Zen quarterback into
his multi-set, pro-style offense and emerged
with the seventh leading offense in the na
tion, an offense which rolled to 431.8 yards a
game.
In the three seasons before Walsh's arrival
here, quarterback Guy Benjamin bounced
between the starting lineup and the reserves
like a pinball, much to the chagrin of almost
everyone on the South Peninsula. But as
soon as Walsh set up shop in the second
floor of the brick building which houses the
Athletic Department, he made it clear that
Benjamin was his quarterback. Period. No
ifs. No buts. No maybes.
A consensus Ail-American, Benjamin led
the nation in passing last year but more im
portantly led the Cards to their best season
in six years. He now plies his trade for the
Miami Dolphins.
For three years James Lofton made quite a
name for himself on Stanford's track team.
He showed promise as a potential Olympic
medalist in the long jump. On the gridiron,
however, he was an anonymous quantity.
The previous coaching regime had seen fit to
let the 6-foot-3 speedster stagnate on the
bench. Walsh, however, immediately rec
ognized the unlimited potential of Lofton.
Before the season last year he said the suc
cess of the '77 team would in large part de
pend on the success of Lofton. Lofton
caught 53 passes for 12 touchdowns, includ
ing three game-winners. He now works for
the Green Bay Packers.
Stanford has been playing football since
Benjamin Harrison was President, but the
Cardinals had never had a runner rush for
1000 yards in one season. That didn't matter,
however, because the gospel of football ac
cording to Leland didn't mention the run.
But last year, lightning-quick Darrin Nelson
gave Stanford fans a dimension once re
served for USC partisans. Nelson not only
surpassed 1000 yards but snagged 50 passes
to become the first player in NCAA history to
accomplish both feats in the same season.
Nelson returhs this season. In fact he will
return twice again. One of only four starters
returning on offense, Nelson will be
counted on to provide the big play excite
ment he excelled at last year.
Nelson returns this season, and Walsh
says collegiate track experience has made
the explosive running back even faster. Al
though Nelson is one of only four starters
returning on offense, the defense returns
seven starters and Walsh says he believes
this year's team may be even better than the
1977 model.
"At some point," Walsh says, "our team
will be a real factor in the Pac-10. I don't
know if it will come early or not. I think this
year's team will be an improved team over
last year's. The problem is that our oppo
nents will be stronger also."
With the addition of Arizona and Arizona
State to the conference, the round robin
schedule was discontinued. This year each
team will play seven or eight conference
games. Under the old Pac-8 schedule, the
Cardinals would have faced anemic Oregon
at home. Instead of roasting the Ducks,
Stanford must travel to Tempe to play fanati

cal Frank Kush's Sun Devils.
"To play Arizona State on the road instead
of Oregon at home, it could be the differ
ence between a winning season and a losing
season or something along those lines,"
Walsh says. "By the time we play them, they
may be weak and Oregon may be strong, but
I kind of doubt that." The Arizona State
game is still a long way off (Nov. 11), how
ever, and Walsh has his mind on a myriad of
more immediate concerns. The Cards won
all six of their home games last season, a feat
last accomplished by the 1940 Wow Boys.
But this year Stanford hosts three '77 bowl
teams, all ranked among the top dozen
teams in the nation.
Stanford opens the season with Big Eight
champions Oklahoma Sooners. Four weeks
later the Cards open the Pac-10 season
against UCLA and then play defending Rose
Bowl champ Washington in Stanford
Stadium. The Huskies ran all over Stanford
en route to a 45-21 victory last year in a loss
which eventually kept the Cards out of the
Rose Bowl and the Huskies in.
UCLA ran all over Stanford, too, but the
Cards did some running of their own and
downed the Bruins, 32-28. Steve Dils, play
ing in the place of the injured Guy Benjamin,
passed for 287 yards against the Bruins, in
cluding the winning toss to Lofton, with 37
seconds remaining.
This year Stanford plays the Bruins in Los
Angeles. The Card quarterback this year will
be — guess who? — Steve Dils. Fullback Phil
Francis will team with Dils and Nelson in the
backfield. Wide receivers Lofton and Bill Kel
lar have departed for the pros, but Ken
Margerum, Andre Tyler and Vince Mulroy
will step in at flanker and split end and a trio
of veteran tight ends — Mitch Pleis, Pat
Bowe and Marty Smith — give Stanford an
awesome air strike capability. But with Nel
son and Francis in the backfield, Walsh says
he wants to concentrate more on the run
ning game this year.
"We could lead the nation in passing at
our choosing," Walsh says. "We could have
the best passing attack simply by throwing a
lot of passes — we execute quite well. But,
the only thing that really matters is the score,
so from a winning standpoint, we have to
run well."
"I think our best chance of having a suc
cessful year depends on our running game,"
he adds.
A shift to develop the running game will
not be the only change in the Stanford of
fense.
"We won't be quite as much a drop-back
oriented team as we were with Guy," Dils
says. "That's about all we did except for
play-actions. We didn't do much roll-action;
we will do more of that this year.
"Last season," he says, "we didn't go into
the year planning on having a Darrin Nelson

— we didn't know he'd be as good as he was.
This season, we know he's going to be great,
and Phil Francis is in better shape than he's
ever been in, so we'll run the ball a little bit
more than we have in the past."
Changes on the Stanford defense will be
less cosmetic. Last year Stanford's defense
was ranked ahead only of lowly Oregon. To
capitalize on a well of talent at linebacker,
The Cardinals have switched from a 4-3
alignment to the 3-4 set, current rage of the
NFL.
"Our defense will have more mobility and
excellent linebackers," Walsh says.
"Linebacker is the deepest position on the
team." Walsh says the Cards have seven
linebackers who can already play top col
legiate ball and are also developing some
more promising prospects.
Anchoring the linebacking corp will be
Gordy Ceresino who set a single season
Stanford record for tackles last year with 174.
Sophomores make up the remainder of the

starting linebacking unit with Steve
Budinger inside with Ceresino and Milt
McColl and Tom Hall slotted to start on the
outside.
Returning starters Dean Wilson and
Chuck Evans hold down the ends of the de
fensive line while sophomore Marty Fuentes
will start at nose guard.
"It's been a little trouble adjusting to the
3-4," Ceresino says. "I'm used to a 4-3. I'm a
middle linebackerat heart and that'sthe way
I like to play ball. But, we've run close to 60
practices in the 3-4, and I'm a linebacker, I
can adjust to it."
For the Cards, stopping the other teams
means stopping running backs such as
USC's Charles White, UCLA's Theotis
Brown and Washington's Joe Steele.
"What you want to do against runners like
that is to stop them before they get to the
line of scrimmage and break away," Cere
sino says. "That's the key to this defense —

not letting people cross that line of scrim
mage."
Opponents completed nearly 60 percent
of their passes against the Card defense last
year, but the Stanford staff hopes that the
secondary has been shored up with added
experience and speed. Junior Keith Bur
cham joins returning starters Savann
Thompson, Rick Parker and Robby Chap
man in the defensive backfield.
"Overall, I think we'll have a better de
fense this year, statistically," Walsh says,
"but it isn't really enough to say that,
though, because it wouldn't take much to
improve upon last year's statistics. But, we
should be markedly better on defense and
our defense will be in the top five in the
Pac-10. I expect our offense to be in the top
two."
An improved defense notwithstanding,
Stanford football in 1978 will still be just a
passing fancy.

To the millions of disciples who congre
gate at stadiums in Columbus, Birmingham,
South Bend and hundreds of other campus
towns across America every Saturday each
autumn, college football is religion. And at
Stanford, the main tenet of that faith is the
pass. The arms of such superb throwers as
Frankie Albert, John Brodie, Jim Plunkett
and Guy Benjamin have consecrated Stan
ford Stadium. As well, the faith has a new
high priest, Cardinal coach Bill Walsh.

He transformed a team quagmired by a
continuing identity crisis at quarterback (no
one knew who he was) and sometimes inept
recruiting into a 9-3 Sun Bowl championship
squad ranked No. 15 in the nation.
Walsh and his staff have revitalized the
entire football program, but it is on offense
that Walsh has left his personal stamp. He
melded an unused wide receiver, a 168-
pound freshman and a Zen quarterback into
his multi-set, pro-style offense and emerged
with the seventh leading offense in the na
tion, an offense which rolled to 431.8 yards a
game.
In the three seasons before Walsh's arrival
here, quarterback Guy Benjamin bounced
between the starting lineup and the reserves
like a pinball, much to the chagrin of almost
everyone on the South Peninsula. But as
soon as Walsh set up shop in the second
floor of the brick building which houses the
Athletic Department, he made it clear that
Benjamin was his quarterback. Period. No
ifs. No buts. No maybes.
A consensus Ail-American, Benjamin led
the nation in passing last year but more im
portantly led the Cards to their best season
in six years. He now plies his trade for the
Miami Dolphins.
For three years James Lofton made quite a
name for himself on Stanford's track team.
He showed promise as a potential Olympic
medalist in the long jump. On the gridiron,
however, he was an anonymous quantity.
The previous coaching regime had seen fit to
let the 6-foot-3 speedster stagnate on the
bench. Walsh, however, immediately rec
ognized the unlimited potential of Lofton.
Before the season last year he said the suc
cess of the '77 team would in large part de
pend on the success of Lofton. Lofton
caught 53 passes for 12 touchdowns, includ
ing three game-winners. He now works for
the Green Bay Packers.
Stanford has been playing football since
Benjamin Harrison was President, but the
Cardinals had never had a runner rush for
1000 yards in one season. That didn't matter,
however, because the gospel of football ac
cording to Leland didn't mention the run.
But last year, lightning-quick Darrin Nelson
gave Stanford fans a dimension once re
served for USC partisans. Nelson not only
surpassed 1000 yards but snagged 50 passes
to become the first player in NCAA history to
accomplish both feats in the same season.
Nelson returhs this season. In fact he will
return twice again. One of only four starters
returning on offense, Nelson will be
counted on to provide the big play excite
ment he excelled at last year.
Nelson returns this season, and Walsh
says collegiate track experience has made
the explosive running back even faster. Al
though Nelson is one of only four starters
returning on offense, the defense returns
seven starters and Walsh says he believes
this year's team may be even better than the
1977 model.
"At some point," Walsh says, "our team
will be a real factor in the Pac-10. I don't
know if it will come early or not. I think this
year's team will be an improved team over
last year's. The problem is that our oppo
nents will be stronger also."
With the addition of Arizona and Arizona
State to the conference, the round robin
schedule was discontinued. This year each
team will play seven or eight conference
games. Under the old Pac-8 schedule, the
Cardinals would have faced anemic Oregon
at home. Instead of roasting the Ducks,
Stanford must travel to Tempe to play fanati

cal Frank Kush's Sun Devils.
"To play Arizona State on the road instead
of Oregon at home, it could be the differ
ence between a winning season and a losing
season or something along those lines,"
Walsh says. "By the time we play them, they
may be weak and Oregon may be strong, but
I kind of doubt that." The Arizona State
game is still a long way off (Nov. 11), how
ever, and Walsh has his mind on a myriad of
more immediate concerns. The Cards won
all six of their home games last season, a feat
last accomplished by the 1940 Wow Boys.
But this year Stanford hosts three '77 bowl
teams, all ranked among the top dozen
teams in the nation.
Stanford opens the season with Big Eight
champions Oklahoma Sooners. Four weeks
later the Cards open the Pac-10 season
against UCLA and then play defending Rose
Bowl champ Washington in Stanford
Stadium. The Huskies ran all over Stanford
en route to a 45-21 victory last year in a loss
which eventually kept the Cards out of the
Rose Bowl and the Huskies in.
UCLA ran all over Stanford, too, but the
Cards did some running of their own and
downed the Bruins, 32-28. Steve Dils, play
ing in the place of the injured Guy Benjamin,
passed for 287 yards against the Bruins, in
cluding the winning toss to Lofton, with 37
seconds remaining.
This year Stanford plays the Bruins in Los
Angeles. The Card quarterback this year will
be — guess who? — Steve Dils. Fullback Phil
Francis will team with Dils and Nelson in the
backfield. Wide receivers Lofton and Bill Kel
lar have departed for the pros, but Ken
Margerum, Andre Tyler and Vince Mulroy
will step in at flanker and split end and a trio
of veteran tight ends — Mitch Pleis, Pat
Bowe and Marty Smith — give Stanford an
awesome air strike capability. But with Nel
son and Francis in the backfield, Walsh says
he wants to concentrate more on the run
ning game this year.
"We could lead the nation in passing at
our choosing," Walsh says. "We could have
the best passing attack simply by throwing a
lot of passes — we execute quite well. But,
the only thing that really matters is the score,
so from a winning standpoint, we have to
run well."
"I think our best chance of having a suc
cessful year depends on our running game,"
he adds.
A shift to develop the running game will
not be the only change in the Stanford of
fense.
"We won't be quite as much a drop-back
oriented team as we were with Guy," Dils
says. "That's about all we did except for
play-actions. We didn't do much roll-action;
we will do more of that this year.
"Last season," he says, "we didn't go into
the year planning on having a Darrin Nelson

— we didn't know he'd be as good as he was.
This season, we know he's going to be great,
and Phil Francis is in better shape than he's
ever been in, so we'll run the ball a little bit
more than we have in the past."
Changes on the Stanford defense will be
less cosmetic. Last year Stanford's defense
was ranked ahead only of lowly Oregon. To
capitalize on a well of talent at linebacker,
The Cardinals have switched from a 4-3
alignment to the 3-4 set, current rage of the
NFL.
"Our defense will have more mobility and
excellent linebackers," Walsh says.
"Linebacker is the deepest position on the
team." Walsh says the Cards have seven
linebackers who can already play top col
legiate ball and are also developing some
more promising prospects.
Anchoring the linebacking corp will be
Gordy Ceresino who set a single season
Stanford record for tackles last year with 174.
Sophomores make up the remainder of the

starting linebacking unit with Steve
Budinger inside with Ceresino and Milt
McColl and Tom Hall slotted to start on the
outside.
Returning starters Dean Wilson and
Chuck Evans hold down the ends of the de
fensive line while sophomore Marty Fuentes
will start at nose guard.
"It's been a little trouble adjusting to the
3-4," Ceresino says. "I'm used to a 4-3. I'm a
middle linebackerat heart and that'sthe way
I like to play ball. But, we've run close to 60
practices in the 3-4, and I'm a linebacker, I
can adjust to it."
For the Cards, stopping the other teams
means stopping running backs such as
USC's Charles White, UCLA's Theotis
Brown and Washington's Joe Steele.
"What you want to do against runners like
that is to stop them before they get to the
line of scrimmage and break away," Cere
sino says. "That's the key to this defense —

not letting people cross that line of scrim
mage."
Opponents completed nearly 60 percent
of their passes against the Card defense last
year, but the Stanford staff hopes that the
secondary has been shored up with added
experience and speed. Junior Keith Bur
cham joins returning starters Savann
Thompson, Rick Parker and Robby Chap
man in the defensive backfield.
"Overall, I think we'll have a better de
fense this year, statistically," Walsh says,
"but it isn't really enough to say that,
though, because it wouldn't take much to
improve upon last year's statistics. But, we
should be markedly better on defense and
our defense will be in the top five in the
Pac-10. I expect our offense to be in the top
two."
An improved defense notwithstanding,
Stanford football in 1978 will still be just a
passing fancy.

To the millions of disciples who congre
gate at stadiums in Columbus, Birmingham,
South Bend and hundreds of other campus
towns across America every Saturday each
autumn, college football is religion. And at
Stanford, the main tenet of that faith is the
pass. The arms of such superb throwers as
Frankie Albert, John Brodie, Jim Plunkett
and Guy Benjamin have consecrated Stan
ford Stadium. As well, the faith has a new
high priest, Cardinal coach Bill Walsh.
John Ralston, the chief prelate for the pass
here during the 1960s and early '70s, led
Stanford to Rose Bowl triumphs in 1971 and
'72 using the passing gifts of Plunkett and
Don Bunce and an arsenal of receivers that
included Bob Moore, Randy Vataha and
John Winesberry. Ralston, however, de
parted to the NFL and Stanford settled down
to five seasons of ho-hum football.
Then Walsh arrived. An assistant to
Ralston at Stanford from 1963 to '75, Walsh
then spent 10 years honing his coaching
skills before returning to Palo Alto, this time
as the head man.
He transformed a team quagmired by a
continuing identity crisis at quarterback (no
one knew who he was) and sometimes inept
recruiting into a 9-3 Sun Bowl championship
