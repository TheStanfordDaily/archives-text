# But first, a few words on stadium etiquette
## 
### Emilie Deutsch 
On several Saturdays during Autumn
Quarter, a strange din arises from a building
surrounded by trees and chain linking and
ticket booths on the northeast side of cam
pus. The commotion reminds you of a lot of
drunk people having a good time. If you
look closer, it is a lot of drunk people having
a good time. The reason? — as if one's
needed — it's that time of the year again.
Stanford footbal' is back and the run for the
roses is on. But more importantly, the op
portunity is here again to turn the otherwise
stately, sedate Stanford campus into a circus
... or a fair ... or one big party. In any
event, bring out the team, bring on the tail
gating, and get ready for another show of
Stanford football.
This year, a new ruling restricting cans,

bottles, large thermoses and alcoholic be
verages will be in effect for the first time to
dissuade rambunctious behavior. To some,
this simply means new, ingenious devices
must be employed to smuggle the necessary
contraband into the stadium. To others, it
means sitting through a whole Stanford
football game in sweltering 87 degree
weather in complete sobriety. To others,
however, this restriction only intensifies the
need to imbibe a healthier amount of bever
age before reaching the stadium (if the
stadium can even be reached by then). But
the attitude of the majority of Stanford fans
is to refuse to let the new ruling limit their
own ability to have a good time. The show
will still be a success.
It will probably always be a success be
cause . . . well, because Stanford is unique.

Stanford is not boring. Stanford hates other
schools' bands and football teams and fans.
Because, even though we lose sometimes,
we have FUN.
For the alums that have graduated or those
people that once went to Cal and have since
switched their allegiance or for those that for
some reason or another cannot sit in the
student section (though many of them
wouldn't risk their lives anyway), the day
begins with widespread tailgating covering
an area from the doors of the stadium to the
dorm fields and beyond. Some of the parties
are quite simple — a case of beer, a fifth of
whiskey and a couple of bags of potato
chips. But others are more elaborate, com
plete with a full bar, tables with tableclothes,
linen napkins, fresh flowers, candles, and a
meal that would serve the entire team.
A typical student day is different. The stu
dents usually get there early enough to drag
kegs, coolers and cases of booze into the
stands. Or, they havein the past. Fraternities
and dorms often section off the bleachers.
And the drinking begins. (In other words,
the fun begins.) Before the appearance of
the team or the band, students amuse them
selves with the Daily and by getting settled
and with the sun which shines directly onto
the student section of the stadium for the
entire game.
The team comes out onto the field to
warm up and the stands go crazy. The band
starts marching down the hill into the
stadium and they go crazier. The dollies
jump up and down frenetically and the
cavemen garb of the drummers adds a note
of savagery to the entire expedition as they

sound their battle cry and run onto the field
screaming like banshies, playing "All Right
Now" and making lewd formations they exp
lain uneffectively.
Don't expect marching. Don't expect
marching music. And don't expect tolerance
of the other bands. "Boooooring! Booooor
ing! Booooooring!" is the cry that greets the
opposing bands, yell leaders and fans.
As the excitement lessens and the water
balloons flung through huge slingshots
made from crutches and surgical tubing
have finished cascading onto the dignified
fronts and backs of the other band (whoever
they may be), the football team is a good
diversion. They know how to play with the
best of them, and they utilize an exciting
passing game with expertise. Some people
call them the main attraction.
At the end of the game, you have alter
natives — stay and watch the concert the
Band gives after each game, go to a post
game party and drink until you pass out,
nurse your headache and your sunburn at
the "O" or join the trek back to the locker
room with the team and the little kids who
cluster around the big guys in Cardinal col
ors to get autographs for their parents.
The show is over for another week. And
even though the guards searched you at the
gate, patrolled the stands, stared at you
ominously and tried in every possible way to
dissuade you from altering your state of con
sciousness and enjoying the game, you
probably succeeded anyway. I mean, you
have to be a little sauced to appreciate the
band fully, right?

As the excitement lessens and the water
balloons flung through huge slingshots
made from crutches and surgical tubing
have finished cascading onto the dignified
fronts and backs of the other band (whoever
they may be), the football team is a good
diversion. They know how to play with the
best of them, and they utilize an exciting
passing game with expertise. Some people
call them the main attraction.
At the end of the game, you have alter
natives — stay and watch the concert the
Band gives after each game, go to a post
game party and drink until you pass out,
nurse your headache and your sunburn at
the "O" or join the trek back to the locker
room with the team and the little kids who
cluster around the big guys in Cardinal col
ors to get autographs for their parents.
The show is over for another week. And
even though the guards searched you at the
gate, patrolled the stands, stared at you
ominously and tried in every possible way to
dissuade you from altering your state of con
sciousness and enjoying the game, you
probably succeeded anyway. I mean, you
have to be a little sauced to appreciate the
band fully, right?

On several Saturdays during Autumn
Quarter, a strange din arises from a building
surrounded by trees and chain linking and
ticket booths on the northeast side of cam
pus. The commotion reminds you of a lot of
drunk people having a good time. If you
look closer, it is a lot of drunk people having
a good time. The reason? — as if one's
needed — it's that time of the year again.
Stanford footbal' is back and the run for the
roses is on. But more importantly, the op
portunity is here again to turn the otherwise
stately, sedate Stanford campus into a circus
... or a fair ... or one big party. In any
event, bring out the team, bring on the tail
gating, and get ready for another show of
Stanford football.
This year, a new ruling restricting cans,

bottles, large thermoses and alcoholic be
verages will be in effect for the first time to
dissuade rambunctious behavior. To some,
this simply means new, ingenious devices
must be employed to smuggle the necessary
contraband into the stadium. To others, it
means sitting through a whole Stanford
football game in sweltering 87 degree
weather in complete sobriety. To others,
however, this restriction only intensifies the
need to imbibe a healthier amount of bever
age before reaching the stadium (if the
stadium can even be reached by then). But
the attitude of the majority of Stanford fans
is to refuse to let the new ruling limit their
own ability to have a good time. The show
will still be a success.
It will probably always be a success be
cause . . . well, because Stanford is unique.

Stanford is not boring. Stanford hates other
schools' bands and football teams and fans.
Because, even though we lose sometimes,
we have FUN.
For the alums that have graduated or those
people that once went to Cal and have since
switched their allegiance or for those that for
some reason or another cannot sit in the
student section (though many of them
wouldn't risk their lives anyway), the day
begins with widespread tailgating covering
an area from the doors of the stadium to the
dorm fields and beyond. Some of the parties
are quite simple — a case of beer, a fifth of
whiskey and a couple of bags of potato
chips. But others are more elaborate, com
plete with a full bar, tables with tableclothes,
linen napkins, fresh flowers, candles, and a
meal that would serve the entire team.
A typical student day is different. The stu
dents usually get there early enough to drag
kegs, coolers and cases of booze into the
stands. Or, they havein the past. Fraternities
and dorms often section off the bleachers.
And the drinking begins. (In other words,
the fun begins.) Before the appearance of
the team or the band, students amuse them
selves with the Daily and by getting settled
and with the sun which shines directly onto
the student section of the stadium for the
entire game.
The team comes out onto the field to
warm up and the stands go crazy. The band
starts marching down the hill into the
stadium and they go crazier. The dollies
jump up and down frenetically and the
cavemen garb of the drummers adds a note
of savagery to the entire expedition as they

sound their battle cry and run onto the field
screaming like banshies, playing "All Right
Now" and making lewd formations they exp
lain uneffectively.
Don't expect marching. Don't expect
marching music. And don't expect tolerance
of the other bands. "Boooooring! Booooor
ing! Booooooring!" is the cry that greets the
opposing bands, yell leaders and fans.
