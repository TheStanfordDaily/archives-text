# Who's who in Stanford coaching
## 
### 
• Some are sons of the Stan
ford red.
• Others hail from the vau
nted crimson and gold of
down-south rival USC.
• One is in his first year on
the farm.
• Three have coached teams
to NCAA titles.
• One headed a U.S. team at
the 1968 Olympic Games in
Mexico City.
Stanford's varsity coaches
are as diverse and talented as
the student body from which
they draw their athletes. They
can be as low-key as gymnas
tics coach Sadao Hamada, or as
hard-sell as tennis mogul Dick
Gould.
Some work with as many as
10 assistants, and with budgets
that could finance a moon
landing. Others do with less,
and work by themselves. Some
are untested, and some are
proven; some are practically
worshipped.
It is indeed a varied group.
DEAN CLARK — An All-
American at Washington State
University and a coach at Ore
gon State for three years, Clark
comes south this season to
co-coach Stanford's cross
country program. Clark will be
working with Laura Treon, the
women's cross-country coach;
the two of them will be replac
ing Marshall Clark, who left
Stanford last year after a de
cade as head of the cross
country program. Treon re
ceived her B.A. and a master's
degree from Stanford, and
coached women's track and
cross-country at UC-Santa Bar
bara. Last year's men's track
team won the Pac-8 southern
division conference.
DANTE DETTAMANTI —
Second-year Cardinal mentor
Dettamanti is at the helm of a
perennial powerhouse Stan
ford water polo team, a team
that won the NCAA Champion
ships in 1976. The 34-year-old
UC-Davis graduate led last
year's squad to a 20-8 record
and a third-place NCAA finish.
In 1976, when coaching the
UC-Santa Barbara water polo
team, he topped a three-year
42-29 record with a fourth
place national finish.
DICK DIBIASO — Dißiaso
brought a quicker, more ag

gressive style of basketball to
the Farm three years ago, but
the new style of play has not yet
yielded Stanford a winning
basketball season. Last year's
team finished 13-14. In his first
two seasons with the Cards,
Dißiaso led his cagers to iden
tical 3-11 marks in Pacific-8
play. Despite the less-than
outstanding record, his fellow
coaches selected Dißiaso as
the Pac-8 Co-Coach of the Year
in his first season.
Dißiaso was an assistant at
Virginia before moving to
Notre Dame in South Bend,
Ind., where he worked with
Digger Phelps for four years.
Dißiaso came to Stanford from
South Bend.
JIM GAUGHRAN — Gaughran,
Stanford's Director of Swim
ming, begins his nineteenth
year as head of both the men's
and women's swimming prog
rams. Gaughran coached the
Cards to the 1967 NCAA swim
title. Last year, the women's
team finished third in the As
sociation of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW)
nationals. The men carried a
4-6 record in dual meets.
DICK GOULD — During 12 sea
sons on the Farm, Gould has
seen four Stanford tennis
teams reach the NCAA finals:
in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1978.
Last year's NCAA winners were
undefeated, winning 24 games
to earn the title. Gould also has
coached four Card netters to
the collegiate singles crown
and three pairs to the col
legiate doubles title.
The women's team, under
Gould's direction but coached
by his wjfe Anne, won the
AIAW nationals in 1978 with a
record of 21-2. The women's
doubles team of Barbara and
Kathy Jordan, sisters from King
of Prussia, Pa., beat defending
champions Susie Hagey of La
Jolla and Diane Morrison of Los
Angeles at the AIAW nationals
last year. Hagey and Morrison
had held the AIAW title for
Stanford for two years.
SADAO HAMADA — Hamada,
a 1969 graduate of Japan's Nip
pon College, has produced
several outstanding gymnasts
in his six years at Stanford. He
coached three-time NCAA side
horse champion Ted Marcy

and Steve Hug, winner of four
NCAA individual titles and a
competitor for the U.S. Olym
pic Team at Munich and
Montreal.
Under Hamada, last year's
men's gymnastics squad
finished 4-8. Hamada believes
that his young and inchoate
team will do better this year.
PAYTON JORDAN — The dean
of Stanford coaches, now in his
twenty-third year, heads the
men's track team. Jordan's
quarter-century of coaching
track at Stanford was highligh
ted by the Cards second-place
finish at the 1963 NCAA meet.
He was the head coach of the
1968 Olympic track team that
raced in Mexico City. That U.S.
team won more medals and set
more records that year than
any team in Olympic history.
Before joining the coaching
staff, Jordan was a track and
football star at USC. He still
competes in track and holds
innumerable age-group world
records in the sprints. This
year, Jordan's charges held a
2-3 record in dual meets. The
season was highlighted by
James Lofton of Los Angeles,
who won the NCAA champion
ship in the long jump. Lofton is
a starting wide receiver for the
Green Bay Packers this year.
NELSON LODGE — Now in his
second year at the Farm, Lodge
came to Stanford after four
years at Hayward State. Across
the bay, he developed the
Hayward State Pioneers into
the number two collegiate soc
cer team on the west coast. He
earned the distinction of NCAA
Coach of the Year for the west
ern United States in 1975 after
guiding Hayward to an 18-3-2
record and a slot in the NCAA
playoffs. The 1978 Stanford
soccer team performed well
under his tutelage, chalking up
a 10-8-2 record.
BARBARA LONGSTRETH — A
former member of the national
field hockey squad, Longstreth
assumed the reins of the Stan
ford field hockey team in 1976.
Previously she had coached at
Long Beach State. Her field
hockey team turned in a super
lative 9-3-2 tally in 1978, captur
ing second place in the AIAW
western regionals in the pro
cess.
MARK MARQUESS — A stand
out two-sport athlete as a Stan
ford undergraduate, Marquess
guided the Cardinal baseball
team to a school record 43 wins
in 66 dates in his first season as
head coach in 1976. Last year's
record was only slightly di
minished at 35-20-1. (The un
usual tie was a game against the
University of the Pacific in
Stockton that had to be called
and was never completed.)
A three-year football letter
man, Marquess earned All-
America honors in baseball
while leading the Cardinals to
the college baseball World
Series in 1967 with a .404 bat
ting average.
DOTTIE McCREA — McCrea's
women's basketball team im
proved its performance from
an even 7-7 in her first season
to 16-12 last year. Her squad
won a berth in the AIAW west
ern regionals in 1978.
The athletic department
granted its first scholarship to a
woman basketball player in
1977, and McCrea hopes that
the increased support will
further the progress of the
team.
Twice an AAU All-American
in basketball, McCrea partici

pated in five sports at Mon
mouth College in West Long
Branch, N.J., before graduat
ing in 1973.
FRED STURM — Fred Sturm's
first season as Stanford's vol
leyball coach will see him try to
maintain the fast pace held by
the volleyball team under Art
Lambert. Under Lambert, the
women's team won 19 meets
and lost only six; the men's
team won seven and lost four.
Both won the northern
California championships.
Sturm, the assistant vol
leyball coach last year, suc
ceeds Lambert as the full-time
coach. Lambert resigned to go
into private business. Highly
respected, well liked and tech
nically proficient, Sturm has
been highly skilled both as a
coach and a player.
BRUCE SUMMERHAYS —
Summerhays, who was
graduated from the University
of Utah, led last year's men's
golf team to the fourteenth
spot in the NCAA champion
ships. Sally Boss of Bethesda,
Md., paced Stanford's wo
men's team, taking seventh in
the AIAW juniors last year.
Summerhays, who has signed
top players for the golf team,
won the Utah Amateur Champ
ionship and the Western Athle
tic Conference in 1966. In 1974
he placed third in the Bing
Crosby Pro-Am.

JACKIE WALKER — Walker is
still laying the groundwork for
the Farm's women's gymnas
tics team. The squad's perfor
mance in 1978 was 4-6. Before
coming to Stanford, Walker
was the coach at Louisiana
State University (LSU). She led
the LSU Tigers to three con
secutive AIAW Region IV titles.
BILL WALSH — Walsh's im
plementation of one of the
most sophisticated and com
plicated offenses in college
football bodes well for the
Cardinals this season. Last year
the Cards' record was 9-3.
Walsh, the Pacific-8 confer
ence's Coach of the Year, led
the Cardinals to a 24-14 upset
of Louisiana State University in
the Sun Bowl. Stanford also
beat California, 21-13, in the
classic "Big Came," which
took place at Stanford last year.
The most thrilling game of the
season was against UCLA,
which lost to the Cards, 32-28,
after a last-minute Stanford
touchdown.
Walsh spent eight seasons
under Paul Brown and a season
each at Oakland and San Diego
developing the skills which
have given him one of foot
ball's sharpest offensive
minds. A graduate of San Jose
State, he served as an assistant
at California and Stanford be
fore going to the National
Football League.

mance in 1978 was 4-6. Before
coming to Stanford, Walker
was the coach at Louisiana
State University (LSU). She led
the LSU Tigers to three con
secutive AIAW Region IV titles.
BILL WALSH — Walsh's im
plementation of one of the
most sophisticated and com
plicated offenses in college
football bodes well for the
Cardinals this season. Last year
the Cards' record was 9-3.
Walsh, the Pacific-8 confer
ence's Coach of the Year, led
the Cardinals to a 24-14 upset
of Louisiana State University in
the Sun Bowl. Stanford also
beat California, 21-13, in the
classic "Big Came," which
took place at Stanford last year.
The most thrilling game of the
season was against UCLA,
which lost to the Cards, 32-28,
after a last-minute Stanford
touchdown.
Walsh spent eight seasons
under Paul Brown and a season
each at Oakland and San Diego
developing the skills which
have given him one of foot
ball's sharpest offensive
minds. A graduate of San Jose
State, he served as an assistant
at California and Stanford be
fore going to the National
Football League.


Norb Hecker and Bill Walsh
• Some are sons of the Stan
ford red.
• Others hail from the vau
nted crimson and gold of
down-south rival USC.
• One is in his first year on
the farm.
• Three have coached teams
to NCAA titles.
• One headed a U.S. team at
the 1968 Olympic Games in
Mexico City.
Stanford's varsity coaches
are as diverse and talented as
the student body from which
they draw their athletes. They
can be as low-key as gymnas
tics coach Sadao Hamada, or as
hard-sell as tennis mogul Dick
Gould.
Some work with as many as
10 assistants, and with budgets
that could finance a moon
landing. Others do with less,
and work by themselves. Some
are untested, and some are
proven; some are practically
worshipped.
It is indeed a varied group.
DEAN CLARK — An All-
American at Washington State
University and a coach at Ore
gon State for three years, Clark
comes south this season to
co-coach Stanford's cross
country program. Clark will be
working with Laura Treon, the
women's cross-country coach;
the two of them will be replac
ing Marshall Clark, who left
Stanford last year after a de

year's squad to a 20-8 record
and a third-place NCAA finish.
In 1976, when coaching the
UC-Santa Barbara water polo
team, he topped a three-year
42-29 record with a fourth
place national finish.
DICK DIBIASO — Dißiaso
brought a quicker, more ag

gressive style of basketball to
the Farm three years ago, but
the new style of play has not yet
yielded Stanford a winning
basketball season. Last year's
team finished 13-14. In his first
two seasons with the Cards,
Dißiaso led his cagers to iden
tical 3-11 marks in Pacific-8
play. Despite the less-than
outstanding record, his fellow
coaches selected Dißiaso as
the Pac-8 Co-Coach of the Year
in his first season.
Dißiaso was an assistant at
Virginia before moving to
Notre Dame in South Bend,
Ind., where he worked with
Digger Phelps for four years.

to earn the title. Gould also has
coached four Card netters to
the collegiate singles crown
and three pairs to the col
legiate doubles title.
The women's team, under
Gould's direction but coached
by his wjfe Anne, won the
AIAW nationals in 1978 with a
record of 21-2. The women's
doubles team of Barbara and
Kathy Jordan, sisters from King
of Prussia, Pa., beat defending
champions Susie Hagey of La
Jolla and Diane Morrison of Los
Angeles at the AIAW nationals
last year. Hagey and Morrison
had held the AIAW title for
Stanford for two years.
SADAO HAMADA — Hamada,
a 1969 graduate of Japan's Nip

staff, Jordan was a track and
football star at USC. He still
competes in track and holds
innumerable age-group world
records in the sprints. This
year, Jordan's charges held a
2-3 record in dual meets. The
season was highlighted by
James Lofton of Los Angeles,
who won the NCAA champion
ship in the long jump. Lofton is
a starting wide receiver for the
Green Bay Packers this year.
NELSON LODGE — Now in his
second year at the Farm, Lodge
came to Stanford after four
years at Hayward State. Across
the bay, he developed the
Hayward State Pioneers into

America honors in baseball
while leading the Cardinals to
the college baseball World
Series in 1967 with a .404 bat
ting average.
DOTTIE McCREA — McCrea's
women's basketball team im
proved its performance from
an even 7-7 in her first season
to 16-12 last year. Her squad
won a berth in the AIAW west
ern regionals in 1978.
The athletic department
granted its first scholarship to a
woman basketball player in
1977, and McCrea hopes that
the increased support will
further the progress of the
team.
Twice an AAU All-American
in basketball, McCrea partici

pated in five sports at Mon
mouth College in West Long
Branch, N.J., before graduat
ing in 1973.
FRED STURM — Fred Sturm's

maintain the fast pace held by
the volleyball team under Art
Lambert. Under Lambert, the
women's team won 19 meets
and lost only six; the men's
team won seven and lost four.
Both won the northern
California championships.
Sturm, the assistant vol
leyball coach last year, suc
ceeds Lambert as the full-time
coach. Lambert resigned to go
into private business. Highly
respected, well liked and tech
nically proficient, Sturm has
been highly skilled both as a
coach and a player.
BRUCE SUMMERHAYS —
Summerhays, who was
graduated from the University
of Utah, led last year's men's
golf team to the fourteenth
spot in the NCAA champion
ships. Sally Boss of Bethesda,
Md., paced Stanford's wo
men's team, taking seventh in
the AIAW juniors last year.
Summerhays, who has signed
top players for the golf team,
won the Utah Amateur Champ
ionship and the Western Athle
tic Conference in 1966. In 1974
he placed third in the Bing
Crosby Pro-Am.

JACKIE WALKER — Walker is
still laying the groundwork for
the Farm's women's gymnas
tics team. The squad's perfor
mance in 1978 was 4-6. Before
coming to Stanford, Walker
was the coach at Louisiana
State University (LSU). She led
the LSU Tigers to three con
secutive AIAW Region IV titles.
BILL WALSH — Walsh's im
plementation of one of the
most sophisticated and com
plicated offenses in college
football bodes well for the
Cardinals this season. Last year
the Cards' record was 9-3.
Walsh, the Pacific-8 confer
ence's Coach of the Year, led
the Cardinals to a 24-14 upset
of Louisiana State University in
the Sun Bowl. Stanford also
beat California, 21-13, in the
classic "Big Came," which
took place at Stanford last year.
The most thrilling game of the
season was against UCLA,
which lost to the Cards, 32-28,
after a last-minute Stanford
touchdown.
Walsh spent eight seasons
under Paul Brown and a season
each at Oakland and San Diego
developing the skills which
have given him one of foot
ball's sharpest offensive
minds. A graduate of San Jose
State, he served as an assistant
at California and Stanford be
fore going to the National
Football League.


Norb Hecker and Bill Walsh
• Some are sons of the Stan
ford red.
• Others hail from the vau
nted crimson and gold of
down-south rival USC.
• One is in his first year on
the farm.
• Three have coached teams
to NCAA titles.
• One headed a U.S. team at
the 1968 Olympic Games in
Mexico City.
Stanford's varsity coaches
are as diverse and talented as
the student body from which
they draw their athletes. They
can be as low-key as gymnas
tics coach Sadao Hamada, or as
hard-sell as tennis mogul Dick
Gould.
Some work with as many as
10 assistants, and with budgets
that could finance a moon
landing. Others do with less,
and work by themselves. Some
are untested, and some are
proven; some are practically
worshipped.
It is indeed a varied group.
DEAN CLARK — An All-
American at Washington State
University and a coach at Ore
gon State for three years, Clark
comes south this season to
co-coach Stanford's cross
country program. Clark will be
working with Laura Treon, the
women's cross-country coach;
the two of them will be replac
ing Marshall Clark, who left
Stanford last year after a de
cade as head of the cross
country program. Treon re
ceived her B.A. and a master's
degree from Stanford, and
coached women's track and
cross-country at UC-Santa Bar
bara. Last year's men's track
team won the Pac-8 southern
division conference.
DANTE DETTAMANTI —
Second-year Cardinal mentor
Dettamanti is at the helm of a
perennial powerhouse Stan
ford water polo team, a team
that won the NCAA Champion
ships in 1976. The 34-year-old
UC-Davis graduate led last
year's squad to a 20-8 record
and a third-place NCAA finish.
In 1976, when coaching the
UC-Santa Barbara water polo
team, he topped a three-year
42-29 record with a fourth
place national finish.
DICK DIBIASO — Dißiaso
brought a quicker, more ag

gressive style of basketball to
the Farm three years ago, but
the new style of play has not yet
yielded Stanford a winning
basketball season. Last year's
team finished 13-14. In his first
two seasons with the Cards,
Dißiaso led his cagers to iden
tical 3-11 marks in Pacific-8
play. Despite the less-than
outstanding record, his fellow
coaches selected Dißiaso as
the Pac-8 Co-Coach of the Year
in his first season.
Dißiaso was an assistant at
Virginia before moving to
Notre Dame in South Bend,
Ind., where he worked with
Digger Phelps for four years.
Dißiaso came to Stanford from
South Bend.
JIM GAUGHRAN — Gaughran,
Stanford's Director of Swim
ming, begins his nineteenth
year as head of both the men's
and women's swimming prog
rams. Gaughran coached the
Cards to the 1967 NCAA swim
title. Last year, the women's
team finished third in the As
sociation of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW)
nationals. The men carried a
4-6 record in dual meets.
DICK GOULD — During 12 sea
sons on the Farm, Gould has
seen four Stanford tennis
teams reach the NCAA finals:
in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1978.
Last year's NCAA winners were
undefeated, winning 24 games
to earn the title. Gould also has
coached four Card netters to
the collegiate singles crown
and three pairs to the col
legiate doubles title.
The women's team, under
Gould's direction but coached
by his wjfe Anne, won the
AIAW nationals in 1978 with a
record of 21-2. The women's
doubles team of Barbara and
Kathy Jordan, sisters from King
of Prussia, Pa., beat defending
champions Susie Hagey of La
Jolla and Diane Morrison of Los
Angeles at the AIAW nationals
last year. Hagey and Morrison
had held the AIAW title for
Stanford for two years.
SADAO HAMADA — Hamada,
a 1969 graduate of Japan's Nip
pon College, has produced
several outstanding gymnasts
in his six years at Stanford. He
coached three-time NCAA side
horse champion Ted Marcy

and Steve Hug, winner of four
NCAA individual titles and a
competitor for the U.S. Olym
pic Team at Munich and
Montreal.
Under Hamada, last year's
men's gymnastics squad
finished 4-8. Hamada believes
that his young and inchoate
team will do better this year.
PAYTON JORDAN — The dean
of Stanford coaches, now in his
twenty-third year, heads the
men's track team. Jordan's
quarter-century of coaching
track at Stanford was highligh
ted by the Cards second-place
finish at the 1963 NCAA meet.
He was the head coach of the
1968 Olympic track team that
raced in Mexico City. That U.S.
team won more medals and set
more records that year than
any team in Olympic history.
Before joining the coaching
staff, Jordan was a track and
football star at USC. He still
competes in track and holds
innumerable age-group world
records in the sprints. This
year, Jordan's charges held a
2-3 record in dual meets. The
season was highlighted by
James Lofton of Los Angeles,
who won the NCAA champion
ship in the long jump. Lofton is
a starting wide receiver for the
Green Bay Packers this year.
NELSON LODGE — Now in his
second year at the Farm, Lodge
came to Stanford after four
years at Hayward State. Across
the bay, he developed the
Hayward State Pioneers into
the number two collegiate soc
cer team on the west coast. He
earned the distinction of NCAA
Coach of the Year for the west
ern United States in 1975 after
guiding Hayward to an 18-3-2
record and a slot in the NCAA
playoffs. The 1978 Stanford
soccer team performed well
under his tutelage, chalking up
a 10-8-2 record.
BARBARA LONGSTRETH — A
former member of the national
field hockey squad, Longstreth
assumed the reins of the Stan
ford field hockey team in 1976.

out two-sport athlete as a Stan
ford undergraduate, Marquess
guided the Cardinal baseball
team to a school record 43 wins
in 66 dates in his first season as
head coach in 1976. Last year's
record was only slightly di
minished at 35-20-1. (The un
usual tie was a game against the
University of the Pacific in
Stockton that had to be called
and was never completed.)
A three-year football letter
man, Marquess earned All-
America honors in baseball
while leading the Cardinals to
the college baseball World
Series in 1967 with a .404 bat
ting average.
DOTTIE McCREA — McCrea's
women's basketball team im
proved its performance from
an even 7-7 in her first season
to 16-12 last year. Her squad
won a berth in the AIAW west
ern regionals in 1978.
The athletic department
granted its first scholarship to a
woman basketball player in
1977, and McCrea hopes that
the increased support will
further the progress of the
team.
Twice an AAU All-American
in basketball, McCrea partici

pated in five sports at Mon
mouth College in West Long
Branch, N.J., before graduat
ing in 1973.
