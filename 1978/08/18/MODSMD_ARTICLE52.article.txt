# 'Other' fall sports: what to expect
## 
### Bob Rudy 
Boasting the best winning
percentage in the nation over
the past three years, the Stan
ford water polo squad will
begin the 1978 season with a
combination of experienced
veterans and some highly
touted freshmen.
During the past three years,
the Cardinals have compiled a
60-9 record (an .870 winning
percentage) that has included
three Pacific-8 conference
championships and NCAA
finishes of fourth (1975), first
(1976) and third (1977).
In his first year as coach,
Dante Dettamanti directed the
Cardinal club to the country's
best regular season record
(18-2) in 1977.
Stanford finished third in the
NCAA tournament after losing
9-7 to UC-lrvine in the semi
finals.
Six of the top eight players
from last year's 20-3 squad are
back, including First Team
All-America sophomore goalie
John Gansel and the Cardinals'
three leading scorers, seniors
Doug Burke, Tom Angelo and
Robby Arnold.
Gansel, a member of the
U.S. Junior National Team, led
the defense as he gobbled up
182 saves for a 7.9 per game
average.
"We will anchor our defense
around Gansel," stated De
ttamanti. "He was just sensa
tional last year, and it's a com
forting thought to know he'll
be around for three more
years."
Burke, another First Team
All-America, is considered by
his coach to be an outstanding
defender and accurate scorer
(36 goals in 1977).
Angelo was the team's lead
ing scorer with 45 goals and
was named to the Second
Team All-America. According
to Dettamanti he will once
again be the key to the Cardinal
offense.
Arnold scored only one less
goal than Angelo last year and
was an All-America honorable
mention.
Despite an abundance of
veterans to call on, Dettamanti

seems especially pleased by
the 16 high school players he
has recruited. Ten of them
were prep All-Americas.
According to Dettamanti,
Stanford's main competition
this year for the NCAA title will
come from defending champ
ion and rival California. He
sees UC-lrvine, USC and UC-
Santa Barbara as other national
threats.
Regarding his team's
chances for another champ
ionship, Dettamanti made the
following assessment:
"To make a run at the NCAA
title, we must do two things.
First, we must quickly integrate
our freshmen into the varsity
and get everybody playing to
gether. The success of our
team this year will depend on
how well our freshmen re
spond to the college level.
"Second, I have to imple
ment my system of play — a
system I feel comfortable with
— into the program. Last year, I
inherited a veteran team and
didn't want to break that up.
Now we must make that trans
formation. I think it's essential
for a national championship."

"He's authentic. We've got a
real money player. Without a
doubt," says Stanford soccer
coach Nelson Lodge, "he must
be considered one of the best
young players in the nation."
Such superlatives were used
by the Cardinal coach to de
scribe his prize high school re
cruit, Ted Rafalovich of
Saratoga. Rafalovich was a
member of the U.S. Undpr-19
Team in 1977 and one of only
three prep All-Americas on the
west coast last year.
Lodge is optimistic that his
newest and youngest player
will help improve last year's
team, which amassed a 10-8-2
record and a third place finish
in the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence behind NCAA runner-up
USF and national qualifier
California.
Eleven lettermen return
from last year's squad which
won nine of its last 12 matches
in 1977.
Leading the list of returning

veterans is midfielder Dan
McNevin. McNevin, the team's
leading scorer (30 points on
nine goals and 12 assists), was
named to the 1977 First Team
All-Pacific Soccer Conference
as a freshman. According to
Lodge, McNevin is a likely can
didate for the U.S. Olympic
Team in 1980.
Regarding his two most
talked-about players, Lodge
said, "In McNevin and
Rafalovich, we have two of the
finest young players in the
country. I predict that they will
become Stanford's first soccer
All-Americas before they
graduate."
McNevin and Rafalovich will
be the mainstays of the of
fense, while the Cardinals' de
fense will be focused around
the "Stanford Swirl," a pres
sing alignment patterned after
the "Dutch Whirl" used by
Holland in the 1974 World Cup.
The Cards will also depend
on the services of forward Paul
Kozachenko and goalie Craig
Ueland, both AII-PSC honora
ble mention choices last year.
Kozachenko was the team's
second leading scorer with 25
points, while Ueland gathered
up 119 saves and tied for the
conference lead in shutouts
with seven.

Coaches Dean Clark and
Laurel Treon will head impres
sive casts for the men's and
women's cross-country teams
in 1979. The top returnee on
the men's team is Roy Kissin of
Danville. Kissin's stalwart per
formance on the 1978 track
team in distance running au
gers well for the men's squad,
as does the arrival of Rod Berry
from Redwood High School in
Larkspur, Calif. Berry won the
2-mile event at the Prep Inter
national track meet in Chicago
in 1977. Other returning men
are Jerry Emory, a senior; Bill
Gail and Bill Haldeman, both
juniors, and Tom Lobsinger
and Tom O'Neil, both sopho
mores.
The torch-bearer of the
women runners last year was
junior Ann Thrupp, who won
all-America honors at the

AIAW nationals. She finished
the 5000-meter course in 18:02,
for eleventh place out of 233.
Stanford finished 18 out of 23
as a team. Other top women
are Joanne Ernst and Annette
Mungai, both sophomores.

Despite a good showing in
her initial season in 1978, field
hockey coach Barbara
Longstreth predicted that,
"We should be greatly im
proved from last year."
The Cardinals will have nine
letter-winners returning from
last year's team, including five
seniors who will comprise the
nucleus of the 1978 club. They
are goalkeeper Buffie Berger,
links Jessie Cerrard and Sukie
Jackson, and forwards Alison
King and Amanda Read.
Also coming back will be
junior back Nancy White and
sophomore forward Kelly Wes
terwick. Considered by her
coach to be the best individual
talent on the team, White was a
member of the U.S. National
Team that toured Trinidad last
year. Westerwick was the
squad's leading scorer a year
ago with 11 goals.
"There's much more com
petition for starting spots,"
said Longstreth, "and I think all
the players are dedicated to
winning."
San Jose State (ranked fourth
nationally in 1977) and Califor
nia will once again be the favo
rites in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Con
ference race, according to the
Cardinal coach.
But Longstreth, whose team
placed third with a 3-2-1 NCIAC
record last year, claims that the
entire leaguewill be more chal
lenging in 1978.
"The level of college hockey
in the West is improving
dramatically," she said.
"Everyone is so much better
than a year ago that it's difficult
to predict just how well we will
do."
The Cardinals' home opener
is set for September 27. They
will take on Chico at Roble
Field.

Coming within near reach of
a national women's volleyball
ranking in 1977, the Stanford
volleyballers posted a fifth
place finish in the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) Regionals.
This season, claims new head
coach Fred Sturm, the Cardi
nals will reach the coveted
rankings.
"With everybody returning,
I can't imagine us not being
ranked in the nation's top 10,"
said Sturm. "In fact, if we play
up to our capabilities, I think
we have a shot at the top five."
To reach that goal, the Stan
ford women will be relying on
veteran setters Shawn Fioover
and Chris Anderson, and
letter-winning hitter Liz
Hughes.
The Cardinal club, which a
year ago earned a share of the
Northern California Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference
championship along with San
Jose State, will also depend on
returnees Sherry Norman,
Cindy Whitaker, Carol
Doughtery and Sandy FJarris.
Among new freshmen
players, Jan Linden (Los
Angeles) could be a standout.
The 5-9 setter was considered
one of the best high school
players in the country last year.
