# Arts and Entertainments on the Stanford campus...
## Gillespie, Pilobolus, Albee & more: a lively season from The Lively Arts 
### Stephen Penico 
To those new to this area's
performing arts, welcome to
The Lively Arts at Stanford. In
the course of the coming year,
The Lively Arts will bring to
campus an assortment of the
world's finest performing ar
tists. For its 9th season, The
Lively Arts is sponsoring a total
of 37 performances, adding
jazz, mime, soprano, and thea
ter to its customary classical
music, and dance offerings.
For starters, the San Fran

cisco Symphony Orchestra will
present a special benefit con
cert at 4 p.m. Sunday, October
1 in Frost Amphitheater for the
Lively Arts at Stanford and
CAPA (Council for the Arts Palo
Alto and Midpeninsula Area).
Calvin Simmons, assistant
director of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, will lead the
Symphony in an all-Beethoven
program featuring the Over
ture to "Fidelio," Concerto for
Violin and Orchestra in D
Major, Op. 61 and the "Pas

toral" Symphony.
But there's more to musical
life than the classics, right?
In keeping with the growing
demand for good jazz, this
year's series will feature the Bill
Taylor Trio, guitarist Laurindo
Almeida, and the immortal
trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie.
The best-known of these
three is certainly Gillespie.
During his four decades on the
musical circuit, his fame has
come to assume legendary
proportions. Together with
Charlie Parker, Gillespie re
volutionzed the jazz world of
the 1940's with the music called
"bebop." The list of groups he
played with include the bands
of Cab Calloway, Ella
Fitzgerald, Benny Carter, and
Woody Herman. Today, Gil
lespie's distinctively-shaped
trumpet and witty grace con
tinue to produce the charged
atmosphere of the big-band
era.
Billy Taylor
No less impressive is jazz
composer-pianist Billy Taylo.
Taylor has composed for such
greats as Ethel Smith and Char
lie Parker (not to mention, for
"Sesame Street" and"The
Electric Company.") At the
keyboard, Taylor's music is a
smooth synthesis of diverse
musial forms, reflecting the in
fluences of — get this — Fats
Waller, Ravel, and Bach.
Guitarist Laurindo Almeida
completes the jazz. He brings
to the stage an interesting
combination of talents. Long
respected for his classical
guitar performances, Almeida
also pioneered bossa nova — a
natural merging of jazz with
the folk music of his native
Brazil.
If its dance you prefer, then
look forward to an exciting and
varied year with Pilobolus,
mimes Houle and Wilbaux,
Aman, and the Kathryn Posin
Dance Company.
Pilobolus ranks as perhaps
the greatest of the modern
dance companies. Since their

start at Dartmouth in 1971, the
troupe of four males and two
females has rewritten the rules
of dance. To call them creative
understates their genius. Their
innovation borders on
radicalism. While some
troupes emphasize ballet
moves, Pilobolus emphasizes
gymnastics. While some are
tied to music, Pilobolus may
use no music at all. They de
emphasize the standard and
overworked role of the male
who lifts and carries females,
then drops them in favor of
bounding leaps and space
consuming whirls. Instead,
Pilobolus creates a communal
feeling. Their movements are
often simple, often clever, and
always superbly executed.
Houle and Wilbaux
In contrast to Pilobolus we
have the more individualistic
and traditional mime of Bert
Houle and Sophie Wibaux.
They bring due credit to this
sophisticated and sybolic form
which lies in the gray area bet
ween dance and acting. Their
movements are exact, their
poses scultpuresque and the
topics they choose reflect their
accute observation of seem
ingly commonplace actions.
The Kathyrn Posin Dance
Company offers a less radical
modern dance alternative to
Pilobolus. Aman, a.k.a. the
American International Folk
Ballet, presents folk dances
from the Balkans, Middle East,
North Africa, and the U.S.,
complete with authentic cos
tumes and exotic instruments.
If you think you don't like
sopranos, drag yourself along
to the performance by Clamma
Dale. You'll be agreeably
dumstruck. A Juilliard
graduate, Ms. Dale finished
this last season with a much
acclaimed portrayl of Bess in
the Huston Grand Opera
Company's production of
"Porgy and Bess" on Broadway
and throughout North
America. Since 1975, her ap
pearances with tne New York
City Opera have included lead
parts in "Tales of Hoffmann,"
"Pagliacci," and"The Magic
Flute."
She has not, however, re
stricted herself to one life.
While not operizing, she can
be found at the Manhattan
Theater Club, singing songs
like "Sophisticated Lady," "J'ai
deux amours," "Play It Again,
Sam," and "So Much Tender
ness."
She's also tall and beautiful.
Albee
English playwright Edward
Albee, of "Who's Afraid of Vir
ginia Woolfe" fame, will direct
and discuss two of his one-act
plays, "The Zoo Story" and
"The American Dream." Little
more need be said except that

every seat, save perhaps a park
bench, will be taken. I.E. get
tickets early.
Gilbert and Sullivan fans will
have an opportunity to ogle
two performances by artists
from the famous D'Oyly Carte
Opera Company who will ap
pear in conjunction with the
Stanford Savoyards. The prog
ram consists of some of G&S's
finest tunes and patter.

"Classical" music is also ad
mirably represented in this
year's series. In a nutshell here
it is: the Guarneri (get your tic
kets NOW), Juilliard, and
Tokyo String Quartets (all
superb), the Bartok Quartet
(near dieties), the Vienna
Chamber Musicians, the
Greenwood Consort (ostensi
bly for medieval and Renais
sance buffs only). Igor Kipnis (a

funny-looking man who playsa
mean harpsichord), three
pianists, two soloists, and, of
course, more.
Edward Albee starts the
Lively Arts Series on October
8; guitarist Michael Lorimer
finishes it on May 4. Other
dates and tickets may be found
at Tresidder Ticket Office on
the second floor of Tresidder
Union.
