Peter, Paul and Mary,
Tower of Power, George
Duke and John Handy, the
Atlanta Rhythm section —
these are all notable perfor
mers who might — repeat
MICHT — make an appear
ance at Stanford this year.
ASSU Special Events co
ordinator Brian Becker is
waiting for the go-ahead
from a handfui of ultra
famous people who hope
fully will grace a Stanfod

stage sometime this year. So
far, the only performer to
answer with a definite yes is
guitarist Leo Kottke, who will
play in Memorial Auditorium
on October 20. Competiti
ton for the acts is tough.
Becker has bids out to sev
eral performers but hasn't
heard from most of them yet.
Sound quality at the con
certs, which has been heav
ily criticized, will be up
graded. "We're spending a

lot more money on sound
than we have in the past,"
says Becker. Most of the
concerts will either be in
Memorial Auditorium,
which has fair acoustics, or
Maples Pavilion, which
sounds like what it is — a
gym.
Anyone who would like to
help with setting up these
and other Special Events, in
cluding the Second Annual
Stanford jazz Festival in May,
should call Brian at 497-4331.
