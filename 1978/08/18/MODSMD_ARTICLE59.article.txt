# A 						Committee on Black Performing Arts
## 
### 
Contrary to popular belief, the Committee On Black Per
forming Arts is alive, well and functioning at Harmony House,
located at 561 Lomita Drive. The Committee was formed in the
Spring of 1973 with the purpose of bringing Black cultural
activities to the Stanford community. This has been ac
complished in two ways.Courses have been offered in Black
music, drama and dance. In addition the Committee has pre
sented productions in these three areas both on campus and
in the surrounding communities. These productions have in
cluded musicals such as "Carmen )ones," and "Purlie,"
dramatic plays such as "The Sty Of The Blind Pig," and "Black
Girl," dance productions including "The Evolution of Black
Dance" and "Black American Dance," and the musical concert
entitled "Jazzesque."
Over the past couple of years the Committee experienced
difficulties which almost led to it's dissolution. These difficul
ties resulted in part from the Committee's isolation from other
campus organizations, and from structural weaknesses within
the Committee itself. All of this led to a declining enrollment in
Committee courses and a decline in student support of the
Committee
However, during the 1977-78 shcool year Black students
took the initiative to organize and present cultural activities.
The Stanford University Gospel Choir was formed as well as
the Ujamaa Dancers, and African dance troupe. In addition a
play entitled "The Trial of Dedan kimathi" was presented
during Winter quarter.
After the success of "Dedan Kimathi," students met with the
administration to express their concerns regarding the future
of Black performing arts at Stanford. It was agreed that there is
a need for a Black cultural organization at Stanford, and a new
Committee was formed. The new Committee consists of Pro
fessors Sylvia Wynter, Chairperson of African and Afro-
American Studies, Irvin Brown, Psychology, and ]ohn Cochran
of Drama who serves as the Committee's Chairman. The two
student representatives on the Committee are Kim Euell and
Clinton Killian.
To kick off the new school year, the Committee On Black
Performing Arts will present an evening of Congolese music
and dance with Fua Dia Congo, on September 26, at 7 p.m.
