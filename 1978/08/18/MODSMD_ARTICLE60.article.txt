The fare ranges from vintage
'30s sophisticated comedies to
soon-to-be classics of the 70s.
The films run in double bills,
and for a little less than you'd
have to pay to see one film in a
first-run house. The facilities
with these fine features are the
New Varsity and the Festival
Cinema in downtown Palo
Alto.
Both theatres offer an alter
native to regular moviehouse
programming. Attending the
showings at these theatres
gives you the chance to refine
your movie tastes with the clas
sics — from Bogart to Nichol
son, from Lubitsch to Hitch
cock, and when available, the
Varsity features new art films
from Germany, France, Russia
and more.
Not unusual
It is not unusual to find
capacity crowds at both
theatres, and the reason is
simple — they offer bills that
are entertaining, and often
challenging, bills that meet the
discerning tastes of an edu
cated audience. To those
who've not yet refined their
movie tastes (especially if the
only theatre in your home
town has just finished a nine
month engagement of Orca
the Killer Whale) then a selec
tion of films like Casablanca,
Harold and Maude, The Lion in
Winter or The Philadelphia
Story by the great directors
from Griffith to Kubrick, pro
vides the best base for becom
ing a true cinephile.
During the great cinema
years of the ' 30s and '40s,
movie-goers attended ornate,
grand theatres where football
field sized curtains swung back
to reveal the silver screen.
Though the trend now is to
split these halls into three or
more "movie closets," the
New Varsity staff has success
fully maintained a theatre facil
ity built in the 10s that seats
700, recreating the style and
experience of the old movie
palaces.
Since its rebirth from a first
run cinema to a repertory
theatre in May, 1974, the Var
sity has expanded its range of
films from the old favorites like
The Maltese falcon, The Wizard

of (Jz and recent classics and
"cult" films like Annie Hall, Dr.
Strangelove and The Discreet
Charm of the Bourgeoisie to
include new art movies like
Chushingura, Renaldo and
Clara and The Serpent's Egg.
According to Randy Lutge,
general manager of the New
Varsity, "Peopleliketoseeabit
of change here. There is not so
much repertory product that
you can keep showing. So it is
nice to bring in new movies
and art movies and be able to
play them in a nice house like
the Varsity."
In addition, Friday and
Saturday evenings draw the
late-night crowds with mid
night shows of recent rock
films and super cult hits like
Yessongs, The Song Remains
the Same and The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.
Those enjoying the cinema
tic fare who desire more than
popcorn and soda to abate the
pangs of hunger will also enjoy
the restaurant and bar oper
ated in the theatre. The menu
ranges from Veal Picatta to a
wide assortment of crepes with
a general price of $5 to $8. With
every dinner over $5, you can
attend the film for only $1 in
stead of the regular admission
of $2.75.
Explorers of downtown Palo
Alto will discover the Festival
Cinema, 475 Hamilton Avenue,
within a block of the New Var
sity, 456 University Avenue (the
two theatres back up to the
same paiking lot). Described
by owner Lawrence Rockwell
as a "classic, revival, reper
tory" cinema with "new-used,
used-new movies," the Festival
shows the great films of the
JOs, '40s and '50s, with a few
ringers thrown in for flavor.
Formerly a theatre specializ
ing in lesser-known musicals
(the old owners almost starved
on a diet of old Alice Faye-Don
Ameche films according to
Ro< kwell) the Festival has been
running week-long engage
ments of vintage films since
|une, 197}. Rockwell and his
associates strive to select dou
ble bills which complement
each other well, and fit the
tastes of the local public.
Among the most popular
bills are double Hitchcock fea

tures. A recent engagement of
Notorious and Rebecca drew
turn-away crowds every night.
Thirties sophisticated com
edies like Dinner at Eight and
Ninotchka do quite well as do
the English films of the '50s like
The Lavender Hill Mob and The
Importance of Being Earnest.
The terrific part of attending
these films is that you may
often find you'll enjoy the ac
companying feature which you
may never have heard of as
much or more than the old
standard you went to see.
Rockwell admits to throwing

in a little known offbeat film as
a second feature once in a
while. Two horror classics, The
Mummy and The Rride of Fran
kenstein were recently shown
together with Nosferatu, a si
lent feature done in Germany
in 1922 by F.W. Murnau which
is one of the earliest film treat
ments of Bram Stokers'
Dracula. Surprisingly, the
German feature proved to be
the drawing factor for most
who attended the engage
ment.
"There's a definite hard-core
of maybe 500 people," says

Rockwell, "who are regular
enough that they come in on a
specific night." The bulk of the
crowd, though, is in the 21 to
35 age group, but Rockwell
comments that there are few
undergraduates who attend. "I
don't think most undergrads
have their movie tastes well
honed. So if they think about
seeing a movie, they think
about a movie, as opposed to
the movie."
The snack bar is well-stocked
with popcorn (its one of the
few houses that still uses real
butter), soda, candy, and the

other usual staples, plus an as
sortment of natural-type
snacks. A big favorite is bagels
and cream cheese which al
ways go fast.
Another thing that goes fast,
unfortunately, are the seats in
the theatre. With a capacity of
only 100, the theatre sells out
very quickly during popular
bills, so it is often best to arrive
when the box-office opens,
usually one half-hour before
the first feature begins.
The college-town commun
ity provides the perfect atmos
phere for the survival of these

theatres. Schedules of the
coming two or three months'
films are printed and distri
buted by both houses and are
available at the theatres and
around the community and on
campus.
So, put down your books,
discover the true meaning of
cinema, get out, have tun, eat
some popcorn. If you go
through four years of college
without visiting these fine es
tablishments, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but soon and for
the rest of your lives.

two theatres back up to the
same paiking lot). Described
by owner Lawrence Rockwell
as a "classic, revival, reper
tory" cinema with "new-used,
used-new movies," the Festival
shows the great films of the
JOs, '40s and '50s, with a few
ringers thrown in for flavor.
Formerly a theatre specializ
ing in lesser-known musicals
(the old owners almost starved
on a diet of old Alice Faye-Don
Ameche films according to
Ro< kwell) the Festival has been
running week-long engage
ments of vintage films since
|une, 197}. Rockwell and his
associates strive to select dou
ble bills which complement
each other well, and fit the
tastes of the local public.
Among the most popular
bills are double Hitchcock fea

tures. A recent engagement of
Notorious and Rebecca drew
turn-away crowds every night.
Thirties sophisticated com
edies like Dinner at Eight and
Ninotchka do quite well as do
the English films of the '50s like
The Lavender Hill Mob and The
Importance of Being Earnest.
The terrific part of attending
these films is that you may
often find you'll enjoy the ac
companying feature which you
may never have heard of as
much or more than the old
standard you went to see.
Rockwell admits to throwing

in a little known offbeat film as
a second feature once in a
while. Two horror classics, The
Mummy and The Rride of Fran
kenstein were recently shown
together with Nosferatu, a si
lent feature done in Germany
in 1922 by F.W. Murnau which
is one of the earliest film treat
ments of Bram Stokers'
Dracula. Surprisingly, the
German feature proved to be
the drawing factor for most
who attended the engage
ment.
"There's a definite hard-core
of maybe 500 people," says

Rockwell, "who are regular
enough that they come in on a
specific night." The bulk of the
crowd, though, is in the 21 to
35 age group, but Rockwell
comments that there are few
undergraduates who attend. "I
don't think most undergrads
have their movie tastes well
honed. So if they think about
seeing a movie, they think
about a movie, as opposed to
the movie."
The snack bar is well-stocked
with popcorn (its one of the
few houses that still uses real
butter), soda, candy, and the

other usual staples, plus an as
sortment of natural-type
snacks. A big favorite is bagels
and cream cheese which al
ways go fast.
Another thing that goes fast,
unfortunately, are the seats in
the theatre. With a capacity of
only 100, the theatre sells out
very quickly during popular
bills, so it is often best to arrive
when the box-office opens,
usually one half-hour before
the first feature begins.
The college-town commun
ity provides the perfect atmos
phere for the survival of these

theatres. Schedules of the
coming two or three months'
films are printed and distri
buted by both houses and are
available at the theatres and
around the community and on
campus.
So, put down your books,
discover the true meaning of
cinema, get out, have tun, eat
some popcorn. If you go
through four years of college
without visiting these fine es
tablishments, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but soon and for
the rest of your lives.


The fare ranges from vintage
'30s sophisticated comedies to
soon-to-be classics of the 70s.
The films run in double bills,
and for a little less than you'd
have to pay to see one film in a
first-run house. The facilities
with these fine features are the
New Varsity and the Festival
Cinema in downtown Palo
Alto.
Both theatres offer an alter
native to regular moviehouse
programming. Attending the
showings at these theatres
gives you the chance to refine
your movie tastes with the clas
sics — from Bogart to Nichol
son, from Lubitsch to Hitch
cock, and when available, the
Varsity features new art films
from Germany, France, Russia
and more.
Not unusual
It is not unusual to find
capacity crowds at both
theatres, and the reason is
simple — they offer bills that
are entertaining, and often
challenging, bills that meet the
discerning tastes of an edu
cated audience. To those
who've not yet refined their
movie tastes (especially if the
only theatre in your home
town has just finished a nine
month engagement of Orca
the Killer Whale) then a selec
tion of films like Casablanca,
Harold and Maude, The Lion in
Winter or The Philadelphia
Story by the great directors
from Griffith to Kubrick, pro
vides the best base for becom
ing a true cinephile.
During the great cinema
years of the ' 30s and '40s,
movie-goers attended ornate,
grand theatres where football
field sized curtains swung back
to reveal the silver screen.
Though the trend now is to
split these halls into three or
more "movie closets," the
New Varsity staff has success
fully maintained a theatre facil
ity built in the 10s that seats
700, recreating the style and
experience of the old movie
palaces.
Since its rebirth from a first
run cinema to a repertory
theatre in May, 1974, the Var
sity has expanded its range of
films from the old favorites like
The Maltese falcon, The Wizard

of (Jz and recent classics and
"cult" films like Annie Hall, Dr.
Strangelove and The Discreet
Charm of the Bourgeoisie to
include new art movies like
Chushingura, Renaldo and
Clara and The Serpent's Egg.
According to Randy Lutge,
general manager of the New
Varsity, "Peopleliketoseeabit
of change here. There is not so
much repertory product that
you can keep showing. So it is
nice to bring in new movies
and art movies and be able to
play them in a nice house like
the Varsity."
In addition, Friday and
Saturday evenings draw the
late-night crowds with mid
night shows of recent rock
films and super cult hits like
Yessongs, The Song Remains
the Same and The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.
Those enjoying the cinema
tic fare who desire more than
popcorn and soda to abate the
pangs of hunger will also enjoy
the restaurant and bar oper
ated in the theatre. The menu
ranges from Veal Picatta to a
wide assortment of crepes with
a general price of $5 to $8. With
every dinner over $5, you can
attend the film for only $1 in
stead of the regular admission
of $2.75.
