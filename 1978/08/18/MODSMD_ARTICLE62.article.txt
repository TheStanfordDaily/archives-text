# The 						City's Herb Caen ain't your everyday curmudgeon
## "After all" quoth he, "it's not just some kind of lumpy Salinas" 
### 
Herb Caen, a colurnist for the San 112 ran
tisco Chronicle, is to his paper what Jim
Murray is to 1 he I os Angeles Times, or what
Jimmy Breslin is to The New York Daily
News. Everyone reads him, and most enjoy
the experience.
Of course there are considerable prob
lems with this analogy, not the least of which
being that Herb Caen is the last c olumnist in
the country to write six times a week, at a
thousand words a shot. Most of his in-trade
peers do three, or sometimes tour sue h
pieces, but no one without ghost writers
does six anymore, except Herb Caen.
"I used to do seven," he says from his
c hair in his fourth floor San Franc isc o office
with a view . "Seven was ridiculous six is still
madness, but I'm sort of .1 workaholic, so it
doesn't bother me that much. Someone's
got to keep all those myths alive.''
Herb Caen is not your everyday curmud
geon. He's very interested in wfi.it people
think about his column. "After all, its my
bread and butter," he says."I understand
that it's a turkey it it doesn't make people
look up from their c offee. I try most of .ill to
be entprt.iinini> IhiriL's like blind items

those that expose people — those are always
secondary unless something's been really
disastrous or somebody's been really rep
rehensible, and I'm the only one that knows
about it. I try to be entertaining, then, if that
doesn't work then the whole thing is usually
a bummer."
One worthy secretary
Caen writes his columns at his desk in the
mornings. "Luckily I can rap it out because I
am able to write fast." Between himself and
one worthy" secretary all phone calls and
letters are dealt with. That too distinguishes
him from most other major columnists. "I'm
very accessible," lie says."I want to be."
"I don't want people to think Herb Caen is
a corporation, or something like Prudence
Penny or Carrie Cash, so I sit here and ans
wer the phone and then people don't be
lieve me. They're so used to the voice of
American Express or a third assistant that it
takes 10 minutes to convince them, and then
iliey blurt out a story that I don't use anyway
and they end up hating me.
"Those are the phone calls. I also get
about a thousand letters a week. Half of
them have stories in them, and the other halt

say 'you stink,' or when are you going to
quit,' or 'my grandfather read your column,
and so did his grandfather, and they hate
you.' I like those kinds of letters in a way
because they let me know people are still
reading.
"As for getting in trouble, I've only been
sued a couple of times in 40 years, and that's
not a bad record. I've been wrong many
times, Lord knows, but so far there's only
been one invasion of privacy and one libel.
That's pretty good. I don't know what my
batting average is. I hope its over 500. It
should be 1000, but it never is."
Herb Caen is appreciative ol the help he is
often offered, but he doesn't think he has
any sort of a stoolie network established. "I
don't have that many informants,' actually.
It's mostly just a matter of my calling people
up frantically in the morning saying it's dead
line time, quick, whadda ya know!' The few
'formal' informants I have don't get paid or
anything; they've just been friends for so
long that they know they're supposed to be
looking for stories.
"I also get a lot of tips from strangers. They
call in with what they think is a funny story,

or something nasty about their friends, or
they say I can't give you my name but you
can go and check this out.'
"Most anonymous messages are true;
they'll be from the police department, or
from a sensitive job. A lot of it is too self
serving, but most of it is true."
Caen does not want his column to get
flabby. "Entertainment needs opinions, and
I have a lot of those. I've always been
opinionated, outspoken and misguided,
and I think people like to read those things
rather than have me be a complete mystery.
Remember, it is very important to know
what motivates someone before you decide
to hate them or not."
The City is sensitive
How has the city changed?
"It is harder to write about now. Even
though it's still relatively small in population
the demographics are different, and that
makes it harder. Great word, 'demog
raphics.' The city is sensitive now. A lot of
San Francisco doesn't like to read anything
that could be construed as being remotely
critical of them or the way they live, so there
are whole areas of the city that I have to

ignore.
"It was like one continual party, it seemed
to me, when I was young. I used to go to
eight or 10 places a night, and stay up for IH
out of 24 hours. It's harder now than when
we had the phony feeling that we were just
one big happy family on the edge of the
Pacific. Then you could kid anyone and get
away with it."
Does this mean Caen thinks the city has
passed him by?
"Maybe. Part of it has. I'm not as conserva
tive as the old timers were, but there's no
thing worse than pretending to be young.
But then again, if anybody thinks they can do
a better job than me I'd he happy to turn
over my typewriter.
"I do some talking about the cold gray city
of hate and the warm gray city of love, and
the heartstrings of the bridge, but I'm pretty
tired of it and I only do it to keep the franch
ise.
"People expect me to reminisce about old
San Francisco, but I only do it every now and
then. After all, it is San Francisco. It's not just
some lumpy Salinas."

geon. He's very interested in wfi.it people
think about his column. "After all, its my
bread and butter," he says."I understand
that it's a turkey it it doesn't make people
look up from their c offee. I try most of .ill to
be entprt.iinini> IhiriL's like blind items

those that expose people — those are always
secondary unless something's been really
disastrous or somebody's been really rep
rehensible, and I'm the only one that knows
about it. I try to be entertaining, then, if that
doesn't work then the whole thing is usually
a bummer."
One worthy secretary
Caen writes his columns at his desk in the
mornings. "Luckily I can rap it out because I
am able to write fast." Between himself and
one worthy" secretary all phone calls and
letters are dealt with. That too distinguishes
him from most other major columnists. "I'm
very accessible," lie says."I want to be."
"I don't want people to think Herb Caen is
a corporation, or something like Prudence
Penny or Carrie Cash, so I sit here and ans
wer the phone and then people don't be
lieve me. They're so used to the voice of
American Express or a third assistant that it
takes 10 minutes to convince them, and then
iliey blurt out a story that I don't use anyway
and they end up hating me.
"Those are the phone calls. I also get
about a thousand letters a week. Half of
them have stories in them, and the other halt

say 'you stink,' or when are you going to
quit,' or 'my grandfather read your column,
and so did his grandfather, and they hate
you.' I like those kinds of letters in a way
because they let me know people are still
reading.
"As for getting in trouble, I've only been
sued a couple of times in 40 years, and that's
not a bad record. I've been wrong many
times, Lord knows, but so far there's only
been one invasion of privacy and one libel.
That's pretty good. I don't know what my
batting average is. I hope its over 500. It
should be 1000, but it never is."
Herb Caen is appreciative ol the help he is
often offered, but he doesn't think he has
any sort of a stoolie network established. "I
don't have that many informants,' actually.
It's mostly just a matter of my calling people
up frantically in the morning saying it's dead
line time, quick, whadda ya know!' The few
'formal' informants I have don't get paid or
anything; they've just been friends for so
long that they know they're supposed to be
looking for stories.
"I also get a lot of tips from strangers. They
call in with what they think is a funny story,

or something nasty about their friends, or
they say I can't give you my name but you
can go and check this out.'
"Most anonymous messages are true;
they'll be from the police department, or
from a sensitive job. A lot of it is too self
serving, but most of it is true."
Caen does not want his column to get
flabby. "Entertainment needs opinions, and
I have a lot of those. I've always been
opinionated, outspoken and misguided,
and I think people like to read those things
rather than have me be a complete mystery.
Remember, it is very important to know
what motivates someone before you decide
to hate them or not."
The City is sensitive
How has the city changed?
"It is harder to write about now. Even
though it's still relatively small in population
the demographics are different, and that
makes it harder. Great word, 'demog
raphics.' The city is sensitive now. A lot of
San Francisco doesn't like to read anything
that could be construed as being remotely
critical of them or the way they live, so there
are whole areas of the city that I have to

ignore.
"It was like one continual party, it seemed
to me, when I was young. I used to go to
eight or 10 places a night, and stay up for IH
out of 24 hours. It's harder now than when
we had the phony feeling that we were just
one big happy family on the edge of the
Pacific. Then you could kid anyone and get
away with it."
Does this mean Caen thinks the city has
passed him by?
"Maybe. Part of it has. I'm not as conserva
tive as the old timers were, but there's no
thing worse than pretending to be young.
But then again, if anybody thinks they can do
a better job than me I'd he happy to turn
over my typewriter.
"I do some talking about the cold gray city
of hate and the warm gray city of love, and
the heartstrings of the bridge, but I'm pretty
tired of it and I only do it to keep the franch
ise.
"People expect me to reminisce about old
San Francisco, but I only do it every now and
then. After all, it is San Francisco. It's not just
some lumpy Salinas."

Herb Caen, a colurnist for the San 112 ran
tisco Chronicle, is to his paper what Jim

Jimmy Breslin is to The New York Daily

the experience.
Of course there are considerable prob
lems with this analogy, not the least of which
being that Herb Caen is the last c olumnist in
the country to write six times a week, at a

does six anymore, except Herb Caen.
"I used to do seven," he says from his

got to keep all those myths alive.''
