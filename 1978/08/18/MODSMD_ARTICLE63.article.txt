San Francisco probably has more to
recommend it than any other city in
the United States. It has so much geo
graphical, cultural and ideological di
versity, so many unique aspects, so
many positive attractions, that it is dif
ficult to think of a city which rivals it.
Many students have made the City
their favorite Friday or Saturday night
destination. Some go up to drink,
some go up to dance, but the majority
go up just to "cruise around."
Everyone has his favorite street or
square but the following are among
the most frequently visited attrac
tions:
Cable Cars: Three different lines
serve the City. The fare is 25 cents, and
you can ask for a transfer, which is
good on any cable car, street or bus.
Powell-Hyde starts at the turntable
at Powell and Market, climbs Nob Hill,
turns west and turns around at Victo
rian Park, next to Ghiradelli Square.
Powell-Mason starts at Market
Street, goes up Nob Hill and through
North Beach to Bay Street, near
Fisherman's Wharf.
California Street travels in a straight
line from California and Market to Van
Ness, going through the Financial Dis
trict and Chinatown.
Chinatown: An area best traveled on
foot. Located on a section of Grant

Ave., near Union Square, it includes
many gift shops, groceries and herb
dealers, and a fortune cookie factory.
Coit Tower: At the top of Telegraph
Hill, this is one of the city's best look
out spots, with a panoramic view of
the Bay. Get there by following Lom
bard Street up the hill.
Fisherman's Wharf: Fishing boats,
seafood, museums, T-shirt shops,
amusement arcades, the Ripley's "Be
lieve It or Not" establishment, street
artists, street musicians and lots of as
sorted interesting characters. Not to
be missed, even if all you do is walk
around and stare. The main intersec
tion isTaylorand Jefferson Street, and
it is a short walk from either the Can
nery or Ghirardelli Square.
49-Mile Drive: If you've got at least
three hours free and lots of gas in your
tank, you might like this scenic drive,
which winds through the city, passing
many of the more popular parts of
town. Follow the signs with the sea
gull on them.
Ghirardelli Square (and the Cannery
and Victorian Park): Many more
shops, galleries, singers, restaurants
and unemployd musicians.
Golden Gate Bridge: The country's
most visited landmark, the bridge
joins the Peninsula with Marin County
and points north. The best view is

from the parking plaza, and if you
want to walk across on foot, it won't
cost you anything.
Golden Gate Park: A surprisingly
well-kept park in the middle of the
city. It covers more than 1000 acres
and extends from Arguello Boulevard
to the ocean. Filled with bike and bri
dle paths, lakes, meadows and play
ing fields.
Haight Street: Remember the good
old days of Haight-Ashbury? This is
where it all started. It's changed now,
of course, but you can still find in
teresting stores, people and atmos
phere. Go from Haight and Stanyan to
Haight and Masonic.
japantown: An area filled with
lapanese groceries, import stores, re
staurants, newspapers, temples and
shrines. Visit Japan Center, too,
which includes a lapanese-style hotel,
restaurants, manufacturers' show
rooms and a theatre. It is bounded by
Geary, Post, Laguna and Fillmore
Streets.
Nob Hill: An area rich in beautiful
architecture, it used to be the home of
San Francisco's elite crowd, which in
cluded Leland Stanford Sr. Take Sac
ramento Street up from Chinatown.
North Beach: Lots of entertainemnt
and night life. Theatres, Italian re
staurants.
