# Fog, solitude, undertow and the Coastal Commission...
## 
### 
Early morning. Or late
evening. Or midday. The time
is indeterminate. A light breeze
stirs the mist. The sound of
waves is hushed against the
sand, pronounced against the
rocks, amplified out of all
proportion to the cause of the
sound. The water creates an in
finity of wet noise: trickles,
gurgles, splashes, drops. A
crab picks its way across a bed
of limp seaweed. A flock of
seagulls huddle together on a
patch of sand.
The 60-mile coastline bet
ween San Francisco and
Santa Cruz has little to distin
guish it from the other 500 or so
miles of Northern California
coastline. This is perhaps its
most surprising attribute.
About two and a half million
people, or slightly more than
one per cent of this country's
population, can reach the
shore in less than an hour. Yet
on most days, at most places,
humanity is not rpuch in evi
dence. Solitude is not hard to
come by if it is desired: a half a
mile walk from any of the

beaches is usually enough to
separate the reclusive from ev
erything but the rocks and the
sea.
The coast road between San
Francisco and Santa Cruz,
within sight of the Pacific for
about four fifths of its length, is
a popular drive. Most of those
who make it, however, rarely
leave their cars. Between
towns there are virtually no re
freshment stands or tourist
parks to encourage them to
stop.
Three factors conspire to
keep the coast in its sparsely
populated, undeveloped
state: the climate, the cliffs and
the California Coastal Com
mission. The development of
other coastlines in other parts
of the country has typically
taken place as soon as enough
people and enough capital
have accumulated in a nearby
urban area to create a demand
for "summer estates" for the
rich and "summer cottages"
for the not-so-rich. This pro
cess has occurred around such
cities as New York and Boston,
and is continuing near Charles
ton, New Orleans and Hous
ton, to name just a few.
It was not a lack of either
people or capital which pre
vented this from happening
near San Francisco. Acombina
tion of chronic fog, cool tenip
eratures and steep terrain
along the coast in addition to
the availability of the bayshore
as a desirable alternative
spared the ocean front the

mansions and bungalows.
And just when unrelenting
population pressure was start
ing to turn developers eyes to
ward the Pacific waves, fog or
no fog, the Coastal Commis
sion was created.
The Presidio, known also to
members of the United
States Army as Fort Winfield
Scott, occupies the north
ernmost tip of San Francisco's
Pacific coast. Part of the Scenic
49 Mile drive through the City
follows Lincoln Boulevard and
El Camino del Mar through the
military installation and out
into Lincoln Park and to Point
Lobos. Located along this
stretch, Baker and James D.
Phelan State Beaches do not
offer much beyond uninviting
gray sand and excellent views
of the Golden Gate.
The Sunset District borders
the ocean between Golden
Gate and Harding Parks. Said
one ex-resident: "It can be a
really miserable place to life if
you're close to the beach. You
go down there on a sunny day
and you think it's great, so
close to the park and the beach
and the rents aren't that high.
But when you move in you get
nothing but fog and drizzle and
sand. Especially sand. You
think you're living in a desert.
Except it's so cold and wet."
San Francisco's five mile

long Ocean Front Beach is by
far the longest for many miles
in both directions. It is posted
with terse signs: "No swim
ming. Undertow." A gap in the
migratory mounds of sand en
croaching on the parking lot is
labelled "Sand control." Most
cars which are pulled off the
road along the beach have
people in them. Through salt
streaked windshields they con
template the grayness before
them and the hardier types
who brave the grit and the
damp for a stroll by the break
ers.
A dozen blocks inland, sun
shine is frequently visible.

. . . coastal fog is so much a normal state of

Coastal fog is so much the
normal state of affairs dur
ing the spring, summer and fall
that its absence indicates un
settled weather, according to
Meteorologist Bill Hackel of
the National Weather Service's
Redwood City office.
Explaining the phenome
non, Hackel said, "The
California current flows from
the Japanese islands, toward
the Aleutians and drives down

the west coast past
Washington down to Califor
nia. The normal winds along
the coast — all year but in par
ticular in the spring, summer
and fall — are westerly. This
means that they're blowing
perpendicular to the current
going down the coast.
"It's a little difficult to exp
lain in terms of oceanography
but this causes a phenomenon
known as upwelling. This
brings colder water up from
several hundred feet below the
surface close in to the coast,
from, say, five to 50 miles out.
"Farther out the water is
warmer so the air is quite

humid. When this air is blown
across the colder water, it
cools and the moisture con
denses into fog or low over
cast. When there's no fog, this
indicates a break in the prevail
ing winds and the prevailing
weather."
Differential heating of the
ocean and the interior by the
sun is responsible for on-shore
breezes, the fog is swept in
land by the paths of least resis
tance — breaks in the hills such
as the Golden Gate.
Just north of the San Mateo
County line Harding Munici-

pal Golf Course slopes down
toward the waves. One golfer
there described it as "a real ex
citing place to play-" Adjacent
to the links are the San Fran
cisco Zoological Gardens, Old
Fort Funston and the San Fran
cisco Police Department Pistol
Range.
The most arresting sight in
the area, however, is the pro
fusion of air-born hang
gliders. Fanning out from the
launching area just south of the
golf course, the 10 yard wing
spans can be observed in flight
far out over the cliffs and beach
below.
Daly City and Pacifica inter-

pose themselves between San
Francisco and the start of the
unspoiled coast. The former,
straddling the seaside hills, is
notable chiefly because of its
myriad rows of small, uniform
houses which follow the con
tours of the terrain in densely
packed lines.
The Sharp Park district of
Pacifica lies at the foot of the
hills and incorporates a mod
erately sized beach. There is lit
tle to recommend the locality
save a beach-side restaurant
called "Hamburgers" which
serves hamburgers.

//If we had more granite,
I there would be some re
ally spectacular cliffs,"
Emeritus Professor Benjamin
Page said, discussing the geol
ogy of the coastal terrain.
"The coast ranges are largely
made of sedimentary rocks,
though, so they aren't as steep
and high as they might have
been. But they do create some
spectacular steep slopes."
The plate tectonics theory of
global geology has gained
general acceptance only in the
last half dozen years, yet
geologists have been quick to
recognize its applicability in
almost every aspect of geol
ogy. It has been postulated that
the mountain ranges of the
western United States were
formed by an interaction of
two parts of the earth's crust
known as the Pacific Ocean
plate and the North American
plate. According to the theory,
these sections of crust have
moved, and continue to move,
relative to each other.
At some time in the recent
geologic past, Page said, the
Pacific plate was moving "be
neath and against" the North
American plate. "I think it was
that that produced at least the
beginnings of the coast
ranges," he said.
"The coast ranges are
geologically young," he con
tinued, "because the plate in
teractions which produced
them were relatively recent,
geologically speaking.
"That's caused a good many
local uplifts and caused steep
