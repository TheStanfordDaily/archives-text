topography."
The same forces which built
the cliffs, however, will un
doubtedly have a hand in tear
ing them down. Page
explained that the relative
movements of the plates has
changed since the moutnains
were formed. "The relative
motion today is that if you hold
the North American plate still,
the Pacific plate is moving to
the northwest. That is what
makes the San Andreas fault
operate."
The road enters a eucalyptus
grove and climbs abruptly
away from civilization. The
trees quickly give way to grass
which in turn gives way to ex
posed rock. This takes on the
look of untreated mining slag
near the summit of the hills and
appears likely to slide momen
tarily into the ocean below.
The stretch is, in fact, named
Devil's Slide and offers a
windswept but admirable
view.
The hamlets Montara, Moss
Beach and Princeton follow in
quick succession. At El
Granada the Half Moon Bay
airport can be found as well as
Half Moon Bay Harbor and
some of Half Moon Bay's best
restaurants. The town of Half
Moon Bay sticks up at the other
end of the smile-shaped coas
tal configuration like a broken
tooth.
Squash, pumpkin and ar
tichoke fields line the road in
this vicinity. A dairy farm is
operating just outside the Half
Moon Bay city limits. The barns
and sheds associated with
these agricultural undertak
ings were built of wood in a
more forested age and are
weathered to silver-gray. The
recently constructed buildings
associated with the Half Moon
Bay Golf Links are covered with
yellow stucco.
Agrarian enterprises con
tinue to crop up at odd inter

vals down the coast south of
Half Moon Bay, sometimes
spread over broad plateaus a
hundred feet or more above
the ocean waves, sometimes
stretching back into valleys
where the cliffs flatten out and
the waves roll onto unim
proved beaches.

. . . and just when unrelenting population
pressure began turning developers' eyes,
the CC (Coastal Commission) was created

In 1972, 55 per cent of the
California electorate helped
give Richard Nixon has "man
date." At the same time, how
ever, an equal percentage cast
their ballots in favor of Proposi
tion 20, known as the coastal
initiative.
Following years of ever
increasing concern about the
despoiling of the ocean front,
first on the part of a few "radi
cal" conservationists, late on
the part of a broad coalition of
citizens' groups, the bill was
conceived amidst a storm of
controversy.
The two opposing camps
were divided along predictable
lines. State Building and Con
struction Trades Council Pres
ident James Lee became the
"official" spokesman against
the initiative while a host of
"unofficial" conservationists
took it upon themselves to de
fend the proposal.
Lee argued that the proposi
tion was unnecessary since 65
per cent of the coastal land was
undeveloped and 54 per cent
was already in public owner
ship. The bill's advocates re
plied that these figures were
"misleading" since the one
third already developed was
concentrated largely within 100
feet of the high tide mark.

Lee charged that "Proposti
ion 20 is a power grab — and a
land grab — by those who
would by-pass the democratic
process," and that local con
trol of the land would be lost.
His opponents replied that no
thing could be more democra
tic than an initiative and that

the bill as written called for
close consultation with local
groups and public hearings.
Lee stated that the proposi
tion would lead to an annual
loss of $25 million in tax re
venues. This was met with
charges that the figure was
"unsubstantiated."
Finally, Lee asked the electo
rate, "Will the elitists who want
to grab our coastline for their
own purposes then be after
our mountans, our lakes and
streams and our farmlands?"
This was dismissed as "patently
absurd."
The proposition, as passed,
put restrictions on coastal de
velopment until a comprehen
sive study could be carried out
and a long-range plan pre
pared. Immediately created
were six regional commis
sions, half of the members of
which were to be officials
elected locally, the other half
to be citizens appointed by the
governor and legislature.
These bodies were to make re
commendations regarding
their regions while a central
state commission coordinated
the program.
The final recommendations
were submitted to the governor
and legislature in fall, 1975.
After several months of legisla

tive processing, they emerged
in a somewhat modified form
as the 1976 Coastal Act. The
policies contained therein
went into effect on the first of
this year.
It is up to the communities of
the coast to make the next
move. Working within the

guidelines established by the
legislature, each community
must draw up a plan for its sec
tion of shoreline. This com
pleted, all proposals must pass
through an 11 step review prior
to certification. The commis
sion hopes to see this stage of
the program completed by
1979. In the meantime, coastal
development will proceed at a
minimal rate.
The houses to the south of
San Gregorio State Beach
stand close to the road but at
great distances from each
other. They are low, Sea
Ranch-style structures for the
most part, and frequently in
corporate exotic features in
their architecture. One home
is adorned with red rafters re
miniscent of a Chinese
pagoda. They share their lots
with wild flowers in the sum
mer.
Down on the beaches, the
waves have hollowed out the
soft rock to form caves and
natural arches.
The Pigeon Point lighthouse
stands on a prominent head
land visible for several miles
along the coast in both direc
tions. A beacon with a past, the
tower was named for a ship
which ran aground in 1852 and

recently celebrated its 105 th
birthday.
In the winter, male elephant
seals gather for a pre-mating
fraternal bash at Ano Nuevo
Point, the next headland down
the coast. The imposing
bachelors are among the rela
tively wide variety of aquatic
mammals which live in the
coastal waters.
Much of the land between
Ano Nuevo and Santa Cruz, 15
miles to the south, is given
over to agriculture of one type
or another. Having survived
from an age of extravagant land
grants, many of the Spanish
named rancheros occupy large
tracts and raise a diversity of
crops from artichokes to beef
cattle.
Fishing tends to improve to
ward the south. Good angling
spots include Greyhound Rock
and Davenport Landing.
Ocean perch are the most
common quarry.

Davenport is the last "town"
before the "city" of Santa
Cruz. A cement plant, the
largest industrial enterprise
along the coast for many miles,
stands just outside the 200 per
son village. The tall, gray to
wers, apparently dusted with
their own product, seem
slightly surreal in the otherwise
empty landscape.
A railroad line joins the ce
ment plant with the Southern
Pacific freight terminal in Santa
Cruz. Since the right-of-way
runs between the road and the
shore, access to the water is
difficult to obtain. The fields
along this stretch are planted
with Brussels sprouts and
cauliflower.
The turnoff to Natural
Bridges State Beach leads

down to West Cliff Drive. This
winding road along the
shoreline bluffs ends up in
Santa Cruz center near the
small crafts harbor.
7 he late afternoon sun lays
down a path of brilliant,
dynamic gold across the
boundless expanse of water.
Some people shake sand off
their towels before folding
them; some remain supine
under dark glasses. In the park
ing lot, small groups walk gin
gerly over the sharp-pointed
stones. Vans, pickups, station
wagons start grudgingly with a
roar and a cloud of exhaust.
Cars line up at the exit, waiting
for a break in the steady stream
of traffic.
