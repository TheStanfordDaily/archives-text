# The
						performing arts—a metamorphosis
## 
### 
The California Reflex, that
quick glance over the shoulder
to see what the East Coast is up
to, is on the decline among the
producers of San Francisco's
performing arts. In the past,
the word "provincial" on the
lips of visiting New Yorkers or
Bostonians was enough to start
heads turning toward the tradi
tional centers of culture. Now,
however, the city's music and
drama community is on the
verge of transforming the Bay
Area into one of the world's
capitals of the performing arts.
The Symphony, the Ballet
and the Opera have all been in
San Fancisco for more than
fourdecades. Duringthis time,
none of them has been com
pletely devoid of brilliance, but
neither have they consistently
inspired ecstatic reviews. The
problem took the form of a vic
ious circle of belief creating
fact creating belief; top calibre
artists would not risk their
careers by venturing out into
what they considered a cultural
trough and so assured that the
area would remain in the
depths of philistinism.
The Symphony was founded
in 1911 by members of the
small but influential commun
ity of classical music patrons
which had existed almost since
the City's birth.
During the next 50 years the
Orchestra went through a
number of artistic ups and

downs. Josef Krips, appointed
music director in 1963, started
the Symphony on the road to
permanent improvement. Seiji
Ozawa took the reins in 1970
and held them until this last
season.
The Dutch-born Edo De
Waart, formerly a principle
guest conductor, begins his
second season as music direc
tor in November.
The Ballet has the distinction
of bing the oldest classical bal
let company in the United
States. Founded in 1933, the
company has suffered, and still
suffers, in the opinion of many,
although to an ever-decreasing
degree, in comparison with the
American Ballet Company of
New York.
The Ballet is directed by Lew
Christensen and Michael
Smuin.
Opera
The Opera has presented
2105 performances since it was
founded in 1923. The company
has been in the forefront of
American opera consistently,
having staged 18 United States
premieres as well as two world
premieres and having pro
vided American opera debut of
the likes of Renata Tebaldi and
SirGeorg Solti. General Direc
tor Kurt Herbert Adler has been
the major force in opera in the
western United States for many
years and has played a impor
tant role in forming offshoots

of the Opera such as the West
ern Opera Theater and the
Brown Bag Opera.
The most dramatic recent
improvement in San Francis
co's performing arts has taken
place in the realm of theatre.
Writing in San Francisco
Theatre, Berkeley Repertory
Theatre Associate Director
Douglas lohnson says that "20
years ago, when I was about to
leave high school to pursue a
career in theatre, the Bay Area
was a wasteland, theatrically
speaking." He constrasts this
condition with the present
state, which he calls "a verita
ble boom of theatrical activity
— one whose qualitty and
quantity rivals most of the
major metropolitan centers in
the country."
Leading the way in this
bloom of dramatic activity has
been the American Conser
vatory Theatre (ACT), perhaps
the City's strongest candidate
for a superlative rating when
compared with similar com
panies across the country. Wil
liam Ball, the troupe's founder,
first conceived of ACT while he
was in England studying reper
tory theatre. Disenchanted on

his return with what he calls
"those cold, icy New York per
formances," he founded the
company 12 years ago in
Pittsburgh. In 1966 the troupe
set out looking for a new home
and, after brief stops in
Westport, Chicago, Phoenix
and the Stanford Summer Fes
tival, it came to rest in the
Geary Theater.
It took four seasons for the
company to become firmly es
tablished (i.e. fiscally sound),
but since it has been solvent,
the company has continued to
improve, refine and innovate.
It is now the largest company
of its kind in the country, with
roughly 10 plays in repertory at
any one time and an annual
budget of $4 million.
Civic Light Opera
The Civic Light Opera, now
in its 40th year, brings four
Broadway musicals to the City
each year. Founded by Homer
Curran, for whom the Curran
Theatre is named, and Edward
Lester in both Los Angeles and
San Franciso, the Light Opera
has been a consistently suc
cessful enterprise.
About 80 other theatre
troupes make their home in

the Bay Area. These range from
the New City Theatre ("We
present works of social and
political vision from the work
ing class point of view and par
ticipate culturally in the strug
gles of all people for a better
life,") to the Chamber Theatre
Croup ("Eight to 10 people
who wish to present an integra
tion of music and choir in per
formances of Sacred
Theatre,") to the Alameda Lit
tle Theatre ("Five shows are
presented each year with open
auditions held approximately
seven weeks prior to open
ing,") to the Action Theatre
("improvisational, spontane
ous, physical theatre").
Some of the better known
companies of the Bay Area in
clude the Berkeley Mime
Troupe, the Berkeley Reper
tory Company, California Ac
tors Theatre, and the San Fran
cisco Mime Troupe. In addi
tion, a number of companies
are oriented toward specific
racial or cultural groups. In
cluded in this cateogry are the
Asian American Theatre Work
shop, the Black Repertory
Croup, Teatro Latino and the
Women's Ensemble.
