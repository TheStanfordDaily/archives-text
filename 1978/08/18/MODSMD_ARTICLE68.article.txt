# A 						fast introduction to, and overview of, the better-known concert localities extant

### 
The Bay Area is a favorite
stomping ground of the
music industry. Artists and
groups of every width and
breadth include stops here
on their itinerary. Accord
ingly, we have more than
our share of concert
facilities to choose from -
what follows is a laundry list
of the more important
spots.
Winterland
Post and Steiner
San Francisco
Bill Graham, the mother
nature of Bay Area rock
promotion, holds the lease
on this place. It follows that
the groups that play here
are almost always rock
oriented, and that almost
every rock-oriented group
has played here at one time
or another. Acoustics are
OK to less-than-OK to un
important, depending on
your sense of priorities —
spectating possibilities in
clude a balcony with chairs
and a large standing area in
the front of the stage. Ap
proximate capacity: 4000.
The Cow Palace
Geneva and Santos
San Francisco
Only major acts with large
drawing capacity play the
Cow Palace due to its large,
multi-purpose, basketball
variety status. Bill Graham,

again, tends to use the place
more than most other
promoters. Parking and traf
fic are a colossal pain. Ap
proximate capacity: 13,000.
Oakland Stadium
Hegenberger Rd. and Hwy.
17
Oakland
Great on warm days, but
stadium just the same.
Mother ship of Bill
Graham's "Days on the
Green." Approximate
capacity: 60,000.
Otikland Coliseum
Hegenburger Rd. and Hwy.
17
Oakland
The basketball/hockey
half of the stadium/
coliseum complex — not
unlike the Cow Palace,
though nicer and newer.
Approximate capacity:
16,000.
Zellerbach Auditorium
UC Berkeley Campus
Berkeley
An acoutstically superb
auditorium that tends to
feature groups who can take
advantage of that virtue.
Approximate capacity:
3500.
Greek Theater
UC Berkeley Campus
Berkeley
So named because its de
sign simulates an ancient
Greek amphitheater, which
means the building stone

has a tendency to bounce
the sound around. Uncom
fortable on hot days. Ap
proximate capacity: 9000.
Paramount Theater
Broadway and West Grand
Oakland
Extremely comfortable,
very enjoyable, a lot of good
music. One of the best. In
the heart of the heart of
Oakland. Approximate
capacity: 3100.
Berkeley Community Theater
Ashton and Gove
Berkeley
Newer than the
Pramount, not as new as
Zellerbach, just as good as
either. Excellent acoustics.
Approximate capacity:
3500.
Concord Pavillion
Kirker Pass Road
Concord
An intersting combina
tion of outdoor reserved
and "festival" seating — in
cludes a covered section of
seats with a surrounding
and separated grass area.
Sometimes sound that is
pleasing to the "festival"
seats can be a bit much for
those in the area reserved.
Approximate capacity:
5000.
San Jose Civic Auditorium
Market and West Carlos
San Jose
When not catering to the
needs of basketball, boxing

and wrestling fans, this
place functions as a sort of
lower Peninsula Winterland
(considerable acoustic
similarities, and the layout is
much the same). Approxi
mate capacity: 2750.
Center for the Performing
Arts
Almaden and Park
San lose
In many opinions, the
best auditorium around.
Less than 8 years old, and
looks like it opened yester
day. Approximate capacity:
,5000.
Circle Star Theater
1717 Industrial Road
San Carlos
A revolving stage, which
is either good or bad. Good
acoustics. R&B, soul and
jazz, with occasional acts di
rected at "older" crowds.
No rock. Approximate
capacity: 2000.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium/
Memorial Audiforium/
Frost Amphitheater
Stanford Campus
Stanford
Not bad. Good, in fact.
Can be reached without
using BART. Dink has good
acoustics, Mem Aud is
where you saw the flicks last
weekend, Maples is tolera
ble as basketball facilities
go. And Frost Amphitheater
is far and away the best out
doorfacility in the Bay Area.

are almost always rock
oriented, and that almost
every rock-oriented group
has played here at one time
or another. Acoustics are
OK to less-than-OK to un
important, depending on
your sense of priorities —
spectating possibilities in
clude a balcony with chairs
and a large standing area in
the front of the stage. Ap
proximate capacity: 4000.
The Cow Palace
Geneva and Santos
San Francisco
Only major acts with large
drawing capacity play the
Cow Palace due to its large,
multi-purpose, basketball
variety status. Bill Graham,

again, tends to use the place
more than most other
promoters. Parking and traf
fic are a colossal pain. Ap
proximate capacity: 13,000.
Oakland Stadium
Hegenberger Rd. and Hwy.
17
Oakland
Great on warm days, but
stadium just the same.
Mother ship of Bill
Graham's "Days on the
Green." Approximate
capacity: 60,000.
Otikland Coliseum
Hegenburger Rd. and Hwy.
17
Oakland
The basketball/hockey
half of the stadium/
coliseum complex — not
unlike the Cow Palace,
though nicer and newer.
Approximate capacity:
16,000.
Zellerbach Auditorium
UC Berkeley Campus
Berkeley
An acoutstically superb
auditorium that tends to
feature groups who can take
advantage of that virtue.
Approximate capacity:
3500.
Greek Theater
UC Berkeley Campus
Berkeley
So named because its de
sign simulates an ancient
Greek amphitheater, which
means the building stone

has a tendency to bounce
the sound around. Uncom
fortable on hot days. Ap
proximate capacity: 9000.
Paramount Theater
Broadway and West Grand
Oakland
Extremely comfortable,
very enjoyable, a lot of good
music. One of the best. In
the heart of the heart of
Oakland. Approximate
capacity: 3100.
Berkeley Community Theater
Ashton and Gove
Berkeley
Newer than the
Pramount, not as new as
Zellerbach, just as good as
either. Excellent acoustics.
Approximate capacity:
3500.
Concord Pavillion
Kirker Pass Road
Concord
An intersting combina
tion of outdoor reserved
and "festival" seating — in
cludes a covered section of
seats with a surrounding
and separated grass area.
Sometimes sound that is
pleasing to the "festival"
seats can be a bit much for
those in the area reserved.
Approximate capacity:
5000.
San Jose Civic Auditorium
Market and West Carlos
San Jose
When not catering to the
needs of basketball, boxing

and wrestling fans, this
place functions as a sort of
lower Peninsula Winterland
(considerable acoustic
similarities, and the layout is
much the same). Approxi
mate capacity: 2750.
Center for the Performing
Arts
Almaden and Park
San lose
In many opinions, the
best auditorium around.
Less than 8 years old, and
looks like it opened yester
day. Approximate capacity:
,5000.
Circle Star Theater
1717 Industrial Road
San Carlos
A revolving stage, which
is either good or bad. Good
acoustics. R&B, soul and
jazz, with occasional acts di
rected at "older" crowds.
No rock. Approximate
capacity: 2000.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium/
Memorial Audiforium/
Frost Amphitheater
Stanford Campus
Stanford
Not bad. Good, in fact.
Can be reached without
using BART. Dink has good
acoustics, Mem Aud is
where you saw the flicks last
weekend, Maples is tolera
ble as basketball facilities
go. And Frost Amphitheater
is far and away the best out
doorfacility in the Bay Area.
