# A 						gonzo guide to the wild side
## Only the truest of geeks ignore nightclubs...

Newark has discos. Cleve
land has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has dis
cos.
Houston has a stadium cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton. Los Angeles has a
stadium capable of accomodat
ing Peter Frampton. Los
Angeles has two stadiums cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton if you count
Anaheim, (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied qual
ity. Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave lowa in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get
what you want, but you get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except night
clubs, that is. San Francisco's
nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Kil
ler, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community
outside the New York State
lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance,
which holds somewhere near
eight times as many human be
ings, and it offers more variety
than L.A., for example, which
holds eight times as many
human beings. No one knows
why this is true, of course, ex
cept for the occasional smar
tass who argues that San Fran
ciscans are a race of supremely
intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason it remains
a True Fact that nightclubs here
are thriving.
There are, again, many
species in the nightclub genus.
We got, for example, sleazy
dives where you can simulate
living in Detroit, and more than
our share of establishments
catering to the Carol Doda
crowd. And if you went to Exe
ter, no need to worry, there are
exclusive places, where ob
loquy and scorn await a fool
without a tie.
And between these ex
tremes — hold your breath —
the City has upwards of a bill
ion zillion "miscellaneous"
nightclubs, ranging all the way
from the red-velvet-and-
Frank-Corshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the Jump
up-and-down -paralyzed-for
life -what-kind-of-funny
-pills-did-you-say -they-were
oh-my-god -they're-turning
into-reptiles contentment of
Mabuhey Gardens. San Fran

cisco, in short, has many, many
establishments designed to
provide you with
entertainment and/or dancing
and/or grounds for imbition at
night.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't know where to go.
It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs ifyour
orientation issue doesn't in
cludea guideto the good ones.
On that note we begin to

draw the noose . . .
Did I happen to hear some
one out there ask for night
club advise? You in the back
with the calculator? Very good.
There are several such estab
lishments between here and
Marin that could do with spe
cial mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the
location of a few. The Great
American Music Hall, the Old
Waldorf, the Keystone Ber

keley, the Keystone Palo Alto,
Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind
— that leaves out a few but
we'll probably get to them in
just an instant or two. (Most
obviously, the list above
doesn't include The Boarding
House, which deserves to
stand alone, and does, to your
upper right). Oh yes, and
there's the Bistro, and the
Palms, and . . .
Excuse me, do I see another

hand? You inthewarm-upsuit?
Yes, I do suppose it's true that a
laundry list won't help much,
owing to considerable diver
sity as to what in reality consti
tutes a truely mythic experi
ence beyond anyone's wildest
dreams. I see your point. Some
people do value dancing space
more than they value perfect
acoustics, and that does make
it difficult to give worthwhile
advice. Almost impossible, in
fact.
But wait. Most people here
have not even been to a
nightclub, and for that reason
it would do you good if I listed
what you should look for.
There are immutable princi
ples in any business. So what
do you say you grab a pencil,
and write down all of the fol
lowing, or else beat up an old
lady and take her copy of the
paper off to Kinko's. What fol
lows are the rules by which one
should judge a nightclub
(examples included).
Ahem.
Rule number one of night
club choosery specifically pro
hibits parties of the first part
from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quo
tient stars generally end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that night
clubs depend on medium
small entertainers. "Medium
small" generally has to do only
with album sales, however, as
does "high fame quotient" —
the point is that you ought not
wait all year for your favorite
group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so
what a true clubber ought to do
is experiment with his ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two
is tough for most college stu
dents. It requires that you
admit the existence of a flaw.
Yet it is important, and we
should shed our misconcep
tions eventually. So remember
this — despite the popularity of
component stereo systems
with multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is

unabletotell a good sound sys
tem from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that, that
though sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
The Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their
shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever
hear anyone complain about
it? At the Old Waldorf — a
favority haunt of Peter Tosh/
Patti Smith/Warren Zevon
types — at the Waldorf it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed ("mixing" is related to
amplification which has to do
with electricity. OK?). And
Great American's beautiful
gold-leaf interior can some
times send a trumpet solo into
an ear in a disconcerting man
ner. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics,
because there are very few per
fect ears — those so blessed
can find what they need at
nearly every jazz club. (Keys
tone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and jazz
places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have
it because they need it, but
other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans
— it doesn't make much differ
ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
k ext, it is absolutely essential
IN to know what kind of
crowd you like. There's a world
of difference between Mabu
day Gardens-variety crowds
and the rest of mankind as we
know it, for example — you
gots to know which ilk you like
orelseitcould ruinanevening.
And Mabuhay is a perfect
example. There is music, to be
sure, though neo-fascist prefer
to call it "sick punk rock crap"
— but sometimes it seems as if
the music is less of an attrac
tion than the seething masses
themselves. They have a dis
tinctive crowd, to say the least,

and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music
does attain near-mythic statue
with a greater than average
frequency, but if you're look
ing for an evening free of flying
ashtrays this simply isn't your
place. CAMH is calm, the Keys
tones are relatively Bohemian,
and the Waldorf is rowdy-but
controlled, and surprisingly
even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations. It
doesn't mean that Herb Albert
could play Mabuhay and bring
the world to an end, or that
Johnny Rotten wouldn't notice
that things were quieter in the
Venetian Room, but certain
clubs do have certain types of
crowds, and they tend to be
distinctive.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And differences in drink and
food prices begat rule number
six. And 10, the multitudes
were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required
when return is made to Palo
Alto, and they were told that
they would be sore afraid if
they had to sleep in an alley.
And the multitudes adhered to
the commandments of the
golden calf of tuition, and cal
led in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number seven, everybody
got The Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and you like it,
go back. Frequent the places
that treat you like you want to
be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID
check and a jerk who laughs
and says you don't look 13 can
be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space
might also turn things around.
Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition
of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of
these places out. It could be
edifying, maybe. Sooner or
later your myth is bound to
come up.

loquy and scorn await a fool
without a tie.
And between these ex
tremes — hold your breath —
the City has upwards of a bill
ion zillion "miscellaneous"
nightclubs, ranging all the way
from the red-velvet-and-
Frank-Corshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the Jump
up-and-down -paralyzed-for
life -what-kind-of-funny
-pills-did-you-say -they-were
oh-my-god -they're-turning
into-reptiles contentment of
Mabuhey Gardens. San Fran

cisco, in short, has many, many
establishments designed to
provide you with
entertainment and/or dancing
and/or grounds for imbition at
night.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't know where to go.
It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs ifyour
orientation issue doesn't in
cludea guideto the good ones.
On that note we begin to

draw the noose . . .
Did I happen to hear some
one out there ask for night
club advise? You in the back
with the calculator? Very good.
There are several such estab
lishments between here and
Marin that could do with spe
cial mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the
location of a few. The Great
American Music Hall, the Old
Waldorf, the Keystone Ber

keley, the Keystone Palo Alto,
Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind
— that leaves out a few but
we'll probably get to them in
just an instant or two. (Most
obviously, the list above
doesn't include The Boarding
House, which deserves to
stand alone, and does, to your
upper right). Oh yes, and
there's the Bistro, and the
Palms, and . . .
Excuse me, do I see another

hand? You inthewarm-upsuit?
Yes, I do suppose it's true that a
laundry list won't help much,
owing to considerable diver
sity as to what in reality consti
tutes a truely mythic experi
ence beyond anyone's wildest
dreams. I see your point. Some
people do value dancing space
more than they value perfect
acoustics, and that does make
it difficult to give worthwhile
advice. Almost impossible, in
fact.
But wait. Most people here
have not even been to a
nightclub, and for that reason
it would do you good if I listed
what you should look for.
There are immutable princi
ples in any business. So what
do you say you grab a pencil,
and write down all of the fol
lowing, or else beat up an old
lady and take her copy of the
paper off to Kinko's. What fol
lows are the rules by which one
should judge a nightclub
(examples included).
Ahem.
Rule number one of night
club choosery specifically pro
hibits parties of the first part
from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quo
tient stars generally end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that night
clubs depend on medium
small entertainers. "Medium
small" generally has to do only
with album sales, however, as
does "high fame quotient" —
the point is that you ought not
wait all year for your favorite
group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so
what a true clubber ought to do
is experiment with his ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two
is tough for most college stu
dents. It requires that you
admit the existence of a flaw.
Yet it is important, and we
should shed our misconcep
tions eventually. So remember
this — despite the popularity of
component stereo systems
with multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is

unabletotell a good sound sys
tem from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that, that
though sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
The Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their
shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever
hear anyone complain about
it? At the Old Waldorf — a
favority haunt of Peter Tosh/
Patti Smith/Warren Zevon
types — at the Waldorf it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed ("mixing" is related to
amplification which has to do
with electricity. OK?). And
Great American's beautiful
gold-leaf interior can some
times send a trumpet solo into
an ear in a disconcerting man
ner. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics,
because there are very few per
fect ears — those so blessed
can find what they need at
nearly every jazz club. (Keys
tone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and jazz
places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have
it because they need it, but
other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans
— it doesn't make much differ
ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
k ext, it is absolutely essential
IN to know what kind of
crowd you like. There's a world
of difference between Mabu
day Gardens-variety crowds
and the rest of mankind as we
know it, for example — you
gots to know which ilk you like
orelseitcould ruinanevening.
And Mabuhay is a perfect
example. There is music, to be
sure, though neo-fascist prefer
to call it "sick punk rock crap"
— but sometimes it seems as if
the music is less of an attrac
tion than the seething masses
themselves. They have a dis
tinctive crowd, to say the least,

and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music
does attain near-mythic statue
with a greater than average
frequency, but if you're look
ing for an evening free of flying
ashtrays this simply isn't your
place. CAMH is calm, the Keys
tones are relatively Bohemian,
and the Waldorf is rowdy-but
controlled, and surprisingly
even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations. It
doesn't mean that Herb Albert
could play Mabuhay and bring
the world to an end, or that
Johnny Rotten wouldn't notice
that things were quieter in the
Venetian Room, but certain
clubs do have certain types of
crowds, and they tend to be
distinctive.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And differences in drink and
food prices begat rule number
six. And 10, the multitudes
were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required
when return is made to Palo
Alto, and they were told that
they would be sore afraid if
they had to sleep in an alley.
And the multitudes adhered to
the commandments of the
golden calf of tuition, and cal
led in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number seven, everybody
got The Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and you like it,
go back. Frequent the places
that treat you like you want to
be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID
check and a jerk who laughs
and says you don't look 13 can
be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space
might also turn things around.
Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition
of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of
these places out. It could be
edifying, maybe. Sooner or
later your myth is bound to
come up.

Newark has discos. Cleve
land has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has dis
cos.
Houston has a stadium cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton. Los Angeles has a
stadium capable of accomodat
ing Peter Frampton. Los
Angeles has two stadiums cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton if you count
Anaheim, (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied qual
ity. Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave lowa in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get
what you want, but you get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except night
clubs, that is. San Francisco's
nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Kil
ler, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community
outside the New York State
lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance,
which holds somewhere near
eight times as many human be
ings, and it offers more variety
than L.A., for example, which
holds eight times as many
human beings. No one knows
why this is true, of course, ex
cept for the occasional smar
tass who argues that San Fran
ciscans are a race of supremely
intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason it remains
a True Fact that nightclubs here
are thriving.
There are, again, many
species in the nightclub genus.
We got, for example, sleazy
dives where you can simulate
living in Detroit, and more than
our share of establishments
catering to the Carol Doda
crowd. And if you went to Exe
ter, no need to worry, there are
exclusive places, where ob
loquy and scorn await a fool
without a tie.

Yes, I do suppose it's true that a
laundry list won't help much,
owing to considerable diver
sity as to what in reality consti
tutes a truely mythic experi
ence beyond anyone's wildest
dreams. I see your point. Some
people do value dancing space
more than they value perfect
acoustics, and that does make
it difficult to give worthwhile
advice. Almost impossible, in
fact.
But wait. Most people here
have not even been to a
nightclub, and for that reason
it would do you good if I listed
what you should look for.
There are immutable princi
ples in any business. So what
do you say you grab a pencil,
and write down all of the fol
lowing, or else beat up an old
lady and take her copy of the
paper off to Kinko's. What fol
lows are the rules by which one
should judge a nightclub
(examples included).
Ahem.
Rule number one of night
club choosery specifically pro
hibits parties of the first part
from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quo
tient stars generally end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that night
clubs depend on medium
small entertainers. "Medium
small" generally has to do only
with album sales, however, as
does "high fame quotient" —
the point is that you ought not
wait all year for your favorite
group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so
what a true clubber ought to do
is experiment with his ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two
is tough for most college stu
dents. It requires that you
admit the existence of a flaw.
Yet it is important, and we
should shed our misconcep
tions eventually. So remember
this — despite the popularity of
component stereo systems
with multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is

unabletotell a good sound sys
tem from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that, that
though sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
The Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their
shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever
hear anyone complain about
it? At the Old Waldorf — a
favority haunt of Peter Tosh/
Patti Smith/Warren Zevon
types — at the Waldorf it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed ("mixing" is related to
amplification which has to do
with electricity. OK?). And
Great American's beautiful
gold-leaf interior can some
times send a trumpet solo into
an ear in a disconcerting man
ner. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics,
because there are very few per
fect ears — those so blessed
can find what they need at
nearly every jazz club. (Keys
tone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and jazz
places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have
it because they need it, but
other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans
— it doesn't make much differ
ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
k ext, it is absolutely essential
IN to know what kind of
crowd you like. There's a world
of difference between Mabu
day Gardens-variety crowds
and the rest of mankind as we
know it, for example — you
gots to know which ilk you like
orelseitcould ruinanevening.
And Mabuhay is a perfect
example. There is music, to be
sure, though neo-fascist prefer
to call it "sick punk rock crap"
— but sometimes it seems as if
the music is less of an attrac
tion than the seething masses
themselves. They have a dis
tinctive crowd, to say the least,

and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music
does attain near-mythic statue
with a greater than average
frequency, but if you're look
ing for an evening free of flying
ashtrays this simply isn't your
place. CAMH is calm, the Keys
tones are relatively Bohemian,
and the Waldorf is rowdy-but
controlled, and surprisingly
even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations. It
doesn't mean that Herb Albert
could play Mabuhay and bring
the world to an end, or that
Johnny Rotten wouldn't notice
that things were quieter in the
Venetian Room, but certain
clubs do have certain types of
crowds, and they tend to be
distinctive.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And differences in drink and
food prices begat rule number
six. And 10, the multitudes
were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required
when return is made to Palo
Alto, and they were told that
they would be sore afraid if
they had to sleep in an alley.
And the multitudes adhered to
the commandments of the
golden calf of tuition, and cal
led in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number seven, everybody
got The Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and you like it,
go back. Frequent the places
that treat you like you want to
be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID
check and a jerk who laughs
and says you don't look 13 can
be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space
might also turn things around.
Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition
of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of
these places out. It could be
edifying, maybe. Sooner or
later your myth is bound to
come up.

Newark has discos. Cleve
land has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has dis
cos.
Houston has a stadium cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton. Los Angeles has a
stadium capable of accomodat
ing Peter Frampton. Los
Angeles has two stadiums cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton if you count
Anaheim, (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied qual
ity. Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave lowa in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get
what you want, but you get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except night
clubs, that is. San Francisco's
nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Kil
ler, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community
outside the New York State
lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance,
which holds somewhere near
eight times as many human be
ings, and it offers more variety
than L.A., for example, which
holds eight times as many
human beings. No one knows
why this is true, of course, ex
cept for the occasional smar
tass who argues that San Fran
ciscans are a race of supremely
intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason it remains
a True Fact that nightclubs here
are thriving.
There are, again, many
species in the nightclub genus.
We got, for example, sleazy
dives where you can simulate
living in Detroit, and more than
our share of establishments
catering to the Carol Doda
crowd. And if you went to Exe
ter, no need to worry, there are
exclusive places, where ob
loquy and scorn await a fool
without a tie.
And between these ex
tremes — hold your breath —
the City has upwards of a bill
ion zillion "miscellaneous"
nightclubs, ranging all the way
from the red-velvet-and-
Frank-Corshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the Jump
up-and-down -paralyzed-for
life -what-kind-of-funny
-pills-did-you-say -they-were
oh-my-god -they're-turning
into-reptiles contentment of
Mabuhey Gardens. San Fran

cisco, in short, has many, many
establishments designed to
provide you with
entertainment and/or dancing
and/or grounds for imbition at
night.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't know where to go.
It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs ifyour
orientation issue doesn't in
cludea guideto the good ones.
On that note we begin to

draw the noose . . .
Did I happen to hear some
one out there ask for night
club advise? You in the back
with the calculator? Very good.
There are several such estab
lishments between here and
Marin that could do with spe
cial mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the
location of a few. The Great
American Music Hall, the Old
Waldorf, the Keystone Ber

keley, the Keystone Palo Alto,
Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind
— that leaves out a few but
we'll probably get to them in
just an instant or two. (Most
obviously, the list above
doesn't include The Boarding
House, which deserves to
stand alone, and does, to your
upper right). Oh yes, and
there's the Bistro, and the
Palms, and . . .
Excuse me, do I see another
