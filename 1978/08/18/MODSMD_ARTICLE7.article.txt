# Stanford needs openness
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Times

Stanford University has appa
rently been stymied in its second
attempt to get its medical school
teaching clinic billing practices
legalized through state legisla
tion — while an investigation of
those practices is underway by
the Board of Medical Quality As
surance.
The problem, basically, isabil
ling procedure that may run
afoul of the state Business and
Profession Code Section 2008,
which bars clinics with salaried
physicians from charging
professional-physician fees.
The BMQA is probing whether
Stanford is doing that, or fits the
definitions of the law. There are
numerous complications in the
case, along with a separate issue
relating to Stanford's sending
out one bill for the medical in
stitution and another in the
name of the teaching physician,
who is on a salary and doesn't
get any of the fee except thtat
part which filters through the
Stanford budget.
On the Section 2008 problem,
Stanford's first attempt to
change the law instead of its bil
ling practices was sort of slipped
into other legislation — but it

was found out and dropped out.
For the second attempt, Stan
ford officials recruited Assemb
lyman Gordon Duffy (R-
Hanford), to carry the amend
ment, without enlightening him
about the prior attempt or about
the controvery surrounding the
matter, or the BMQA investiga
tion.
Duffy was generous with Stan
ford. "I just didn't ask the right
questions," he said, adding that
now he has a few.
Regardless, the omission of
highly pertinent information by
Stanford in its contacts with
Duffy make the whole thing ap
pear to be underhanded and
dubious.
Stanford, as a private, non
profit institution, clearly needs
funds to run its medical school
and hospital, which also serves
the Palo Alto community and
other areas. Clearly, it is having
problems generating the
needed medical-service re
venues under the provisions of
present law — although its prac
tices have not yet been declared
illegal.
Its forays to the legislature
demonstrate some nervousness

about that point, however.
Perhaps it's time for the uni
versity and medical school to
re-examine its practices, do
what's needed to either change
them or win legislative support
for a change in the law and
otherwise seek an open ex
change of ideas about how it can
resolve the problem.
That openness should extend
to legislators, especially.
