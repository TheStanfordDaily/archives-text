David Allen runs the Board
ing House, the finest club in
San Francisco. There are other
clubs and other owners who
damn-near hold their own
with Allen, but for now he
holds the market on the near
perfect building-run-by-a
patriarch-of-the-stars market.
Aftefall, either the man or his
edifice has helped launch the
careers of Kenny Rankin, Lilly
Tomlin, Richard Pryor, Richard
Klein and Steve Martin — the
BH has frequently been de
scribed as "the perfect comedy
room," and its reputation is
deserved.
The Boarding House is a
dumpy-looking place with
dirty walls that sits between
and underneath some
dumpy-looking buildings on
Bush Street, in San Francisco.
Yet once a show starts there all
architectural grumbling

ceases. The funny walls, it be
comes apparant, are funny be
cause they are acoustically per
fect, so much so that even the
deafest amoung us will marvel
at the sound. The BH is a rela
tively small club, seating only a
little over 200 persons, yet last
year along it was the sight of
performances by Neil Young
and Steve Martin. And when
Allen needed to raise huge
sums of money last year for a
hard liquor license, a group
called "Friends of the Boarding
House" held a benefit at the
San Francisco Civic center. The
"Friends" appeared free, and
they included the same Steve
Martin, Martin Mull, Joan
Baez, Jimmy Buffett and Mel
lisa Manchester (also Loudon
Wainright 111, Billy Crystal and
Robin Williams).
Boarding House tickets gen
erally run about $6 a show,
though they vary according to

the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing —
Allen runs a restaurant
downstairs for those who wish
to bribe their way into front
row seats. (Eat first, sit close to
the stage. It works like that.) In
addition to comedy the BH fea
tures nearly everything else
that moves — they got rock,
rock-folk, and folk-inflected
rock-soul; they got occasional
bad acts and generally good
acts, and a lot of sleeper sensa
tions.
And if this reads like an A-1
exercise in Korean influence
peddling to you, well tough.
Every critic has his favorite, and
this place deserves one hell of
a plug. So here it is — THE
BOARDING HOUSE, ON
BUSH STREET, IS A QUALITY
NIGHTCLUB. ALL SELF RE
SPECTING NIGHTCLUB
GROUPIES WILL SWEAR BY IT.
GO THERE.
