# Korean wrongdoing denied

### 
Washington (AP) — Rep. John
McFall (D-Calif.), former Demo
cratic whip in the House, asked
yesterday that misconduct alle
gations stemming from his as
sociation with Korean rice dealer
Tongsun Park be dropped be
cause they are groundless.
McFall and three colleagues
filed papers with the House
ethics committee in response to
statements outlining alleged vio
lations issued by the committee
last month.
The four members of Con
gress, all of whom claimed inno
cence, were Reps. McFall; Ed
ward Roybal (D-Calif.), Edward
Patten (D-N.J.), and Charles Wil
son (D-Calif.). The committee
said last month it had no evi
dence that any of them knew
Seoul was trying to buy favors.
The committee has another 30

days in which to recommend
further action to the House if
further investigation supports
the initial statements. Punish
ment could range from a re
primand to expulsion.
Rep. John Flynt (D-Ga.),
chairman of the ethics commit
tee, has said that public hearings
on the committee's investiga
tion are likely, but he did not
suggest a time.
In McFall's documents, the
congressman acknowledged, as
he has before, that he accepted
cash and favors from Park.
But McFall contended that in
his "brief" and "inconsequen
tial encounters" with Park he
was unaware of any attempt to
sway his views.
Patten denied that he contri
buted a total of $1000 Tongsun
Park allegedly had given him to a

New Jersey Democratic party
organization. He blamed the in
cidents on erroneous financial
reporting by an associate.
Roybal's and Wilson's state
ments were not immediately av
ailable. But a committee source
said that responses from all four
members have been received.
The ethics committee said that
Roybal failed to report $1000 he
accepted from Park and failed to
tell the truth about the contribu
tion to the committee.
The committee alleged that
Wilson received $600 from Park
and failed to tell the truth about
it.
