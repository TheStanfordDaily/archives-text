# Confident Dils steps in
## 
### Chris Haft 
Most people blink when
they emerge from the
shadows. Steve Dils doesn't.
Except for one brief, won
derful day, Dils dwelled for
four years in the dark obscurity
of Stanford's bench, escaping
only to hold for placekicks.
Yet Dils endured it all and
today he eagerly enters the
public spotlight as the Cardi
nals' starting quarterback, a
position that has given fame to
men such as Frankie Albert,
John Brodie, Jim Plunkett and
Guy Benjamin.
The departure of Benjamin,
who guided Stanford last year
to a 9-3 record, which included
a Sun Bowl victory, combined
with the weighty tradition of
Card quarterback greatness
might be expected to induce
Dils towards doubt-ridden in
trqspection.
External pressures, how
ever, bounce off Steve like bul
lets off Superman. Dils isn't
bothered by his predecessors'
legends. "There's no tension,"

he says. "It's nice to come from
a school with a lot of great
quarterbacks."
Nor does Dils worry about
replacing Benjamin. He did it
last season, replacing an in
jured Guyand leading Stanford
to a 32-28 victory over UCLA.
On that sparkling day against
the Bruins Dils completed 24 of
37 passes f0r287 yards and one
touchdown. Similar perfor
mances in each game this year
would certainly produce a suc
cessful campaign, but Dils
realizes that not every Saturday
will be a spectacular one.
"Some days you're gonna be
off," acknowledges Steve. "If I
have a bad game, I'll just go
back and get 'em next week. I
vyon't press myself."
The Cards are certain that
success will be the rule rather
than the exception with Dils in
control.
"Steve is a top quarterback,"
affirms wide receiver Vince
Mulroy. "He has a strong arm,
and he's a better runner and
ballhandler than Benjamin
was."
Dils' leadership abilities,
however, remain his greatest
asset. His perseverance as a
substitute helped him win fol
lowers.

Dils' ample supply of confi
dence provides a basis for his
leadership. "When he comes
in the huddle, everyone's con
fident," says Mulroy.
Another reason why Dils is
respected is his patience with
his teammates. Mulroy says,
"Beyond Steve's physical ta
lents, he's very easy to work
with. He understands a re
ceiver; he's not the type of guy
who if you drop a pass yells at
you or even looks at you
funny."
"I just don't want people to
get down on themselves," Dils
says.
Dils will definitely never get
down on himself. Even the
formidable task of opening
1978 with powerhouse Ok
lahoma fails to shake him.
"The first game doesn't
make the season," he main
tains. "Coach iBill) Walsh tells
us about teams he's been on
that have won their first two
games and losttheir next six.
"I think it's more important
to be strong throughout the
year."
Being strong should be no
thing new to Steve Dils. That's
what it takes to survive inactiv
ity, ignore pressure and win re
spect.
