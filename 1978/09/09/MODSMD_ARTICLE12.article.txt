five additional Sooners. We
clambered onto Embarcadero
and waited for a bus to take the
group to Fisherman's Wharf,
the boosters passing out
enough quarters to get us all
on the bus and back 20 times.
"Get down in your football
stance," the others yelled to
the one man in the group who
had played football at OU.
With a little more prodding, he
executed the maneuver excel
lently. "This guy used to play
for Bud Wilkinson," came the
explanation for the strange re
quest. "Bud once said if he
could ever get him to get out of
his stance, he'd win a Heisman
trophy. But he stayed there so

long his knee atrophied and he
couldn't get up."
We climbed out on Fisher
man's Wharf and headed al
most directly to Scoma's. "I'm
so hungry I could eat a whale,"
said a housing developer in the
group. Then he looked at us
writing away furiously. "Put
that in," he said, "Okie eats
whale."
Football is vital to Oklaho
mans because it provides a
common interest.
There is no tolerance in Ok
lahoma when it comes to los
ing. Ever since Bud Wilkinson
won 47 straight games as head
Sooner coach between 1952
and 1957, the entire state has
been unaccustomed to a

scoreboard that is lit in favor of
the other team whoever that
may be. The Texas game is one
though, that must be won to
make each season a success.
"There are more high
schools in Texas than people in
Oklahoma" and that is where
the bulk of the Oklahoma re
cruits come from. When the
players that choose to go to
OU return to their home state
to play the game, an emotional
buildup precedes the game.
The ri ,iry was epitomized
this year when Texas neglected
to ask two star prep players to
partic e in the Oil Bowl, the
all-star game between
graduated high school seniors
from OklahomaandTexas. The

two had signed letters of intent
to play for OU.
"We're supposed to be rabid
fans who assault people," the
laywer informed us. "From
coast to coast we have the
reputation as the worst football
fans there are. And you know
what? It's mostly deserved."
Don't you believe it. The
Sooners are just having fun the
best way they know. Said one
fan: "I've seen every game but
one for the past 10 years. My
favorite is the time we beat
Texas 53-14. After that game,
you could walk out of there
and gladly die knowing you'd
seen everything you'd ever
want to."
"We're trying to explain
courteously that we're going to
humiliate y'all."
Oklahomans thrive on
Sooner football; the game is
literally the lifeblood of the
state. Corporate decisions are
secondary to its existence. Di
vorce cases can't be settled be
cause neither party wants to re
linquish the tickets. Life-long
friendships are made and de
istroyed under the Sooner
scoreboard and lives are
threatened if the Sooner reign
is opposed.
But the southwesterners
have a certain charm that dis
tinguishes their preoccupation
with the sport from rabid
fanaticism. Perhaps it's their
southern drawl and the way
they make you feel at home in
your own city. It might be their
good-natured apologies ("I'm
sorry for what we're gonna do
to y'all"). Or maybe it's their
unabashed pride in everything
that's Oklahoman. ("We'vegot
cattle, oil and football.") Prob
ably the element that makes
them enjoyable, though, is
their determination to have
fun. And football is the Ok
lahoman way of doing just that.
One group of Sooner root
ers checked into the Hyatt Re
gency in San Francisco, their
luggage proudly plastered with
'Barry Switzer' stickers and Ok
lahoma buttons. Nothing else
belied the fact that they had

just stepped off the plane from
the southwest except their
irrepressible good humor.
They were here to enjoy them
selves.
No sooner had the group of
10 deposited their bags in their
rooms than they were ready to
"hook it" to Fisherman's Wharf
where, it seemed, the other
8000 fans that had made the trip
would congregate sooner or la
ter. "I'll meet you down at the
thingie," yelled one as he
headed for the cable car.
We had managed to clear up
a few fundamental feelings
about the upcoming game be
fore we left the hotel. "You've
got 'em scared to death," said
one, a lawyer from Oklahoma
City. "You've got a great
thrower and good receivers.
You've got 'em unnerved."

the plane and hotel reserva

out of the southwest," he said.
"Oklahoma is as tough as any

the bulk of the Oklahoma re
cruits come from. When the
players that choose to go to
OU return to their home state
to play the game, an emotional
buildup precedes the game.
The ri ,iry was epitomized
this year when Texas neglected
to ask two star prep players to
partic e in the Oil Bowl, the
all-star game between
graduated high school seniors
from OklahomaandTexas. The

two had signed letters of intent
to play for OU.
"We're supposed to be rabid
fans who assault people," the
laywer informed us. "From
coast to coast we have the
reputation as the worst football
fans there are. And you know
what? It's mostly deserved."
Don't you believe it. The
Sooners are just having fun the
best way they know. Said one
fan: "I've seen every game but
one for the past 10 years. My
favorite is the time we beat
Texas 53-14. After that game,
you could walk out of there
and gladly die knowing you'd
seen everything you'd ever
want to."
"We're trying to explain
courteously that we're going to
humiliate y'all."
Oklahomans thrive on
Sooner football; the game is
literally the lifeblood of the
state. Corporate decisions are
secondary to its existence. Di
vorce cases can't be settled be
cause neither party wants to re
linquish the tickets. Life-long
friendships are made and de
istroyed under the Sooner
scoreboard and lives are
threatened if the Sooner reign
is opposed.
But the southwesterners
have a certain charm that dis
tinguishes their preoccupation
with the sport from rabid
fanaticism. Perhaps it's their
southern drawl and the way
they make you feel at home in
your own city. It might be their
good-natured apologies ("I'm
sorry for what we're gonna do
to y'all"). Or maybe it's their
unabashed pride in everything
that's Oklahoman. ("We'vegot
cattle, oil and football.") Prob
ably the element that makes
them enjoyable, though, is
their determination to have
fun. And football is the Ok
lahoman way of doing just that.
One group of Sooner root
ers checked into the Hyatt Re
gency in San Francisco, their
luggage proudly plastered with
'Barry Switzer' stickers and Ok
lahoma buttons. Nothing else
belied the fact that they had

just stepped off the plane from
the southwest except their
irrepressible good humor.
They were here to enjoy them
selves.
No sooner had the group of
10 deposited their bags in their
rooms than they were ready to
"hook it" to Fisherman's Wharf
where, it seemed, the other
8000 fans that had made the trip
would congregate sooner or la
ter. "I'll meet you down at the
thingie," yelled one as he
headed for the cable car.
We had managed to clear up
a few fundamental feelings
about the upcoming game be
fore we left the hotel. "You've
got 'em scared to death," said
one, a lawyer from Oklahoma
City. "You've got a great
thrower and good receivers.
You've got 'em unnerved."
The man that had made all
the plane and hotel reserva
tions a year in advance to as
sure the group's attendance at
the opener was not as quick to
complimentthe Cardinal team.
"Y'all haven't seen running
backs like we have that come
out of the southwest," he said.
"Oklahoma is as tough as any
body in the country. We've got
a bunch of flyers."
Even the elevator ride from
the seventeenth floor was an
event. Five of us boarded the
glass enclosure originally, but
by the time we reached the
lobby, we'd picked up four or

five additional Sooners. We
clambered onto Embarcadero
and waited for a bus to take the
group to Fisherman's Wharf,
the boosters passing out
enough quarters to get us all
on the bus and back 20 times.
"Get down in your football
stance," the others yelled to
the one man in the group who
had played football at OU.
With a little more prodding, he
executed the maneuver excel
lently. "This guy used to play
for Bud Wilkinson," came the
explanation for the strange re
quest. "Bud once said if he
could ever get him to get out of
his stance, he'd win a Heisman
trophy. But he stayed there so

long his knee atrophied and he
couldn't get up."
We climbed out on Fisher
man's Wharf and headed al
most directly to Scoma's. "I'm
so hungry I could eat a whale,"
said a housing developer in the
group. Then he looked at us
writing away furiously. "Put
that in," he said, "Okie eats
whale."
Football is vital to Oklaho
mans because it provides a
common interest.
There is no tolerance in Ok
lahoma when it comes to los
ing. Ever since Bud Wilkinson
won 47 straight games as head
Sooner coach between 1952
and 1957, the entire state has
been unaccustomed to a

scoreboard that is lit in favor of
the other team whoever that
may be. The Texas game is one
though, that must be won to
make each season a success.
