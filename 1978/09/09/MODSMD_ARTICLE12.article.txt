# Oklahoma invades the Bay Area

five additional Sooners. We
clambered onto Embarcadero
and waited for a bus to take the
group to Fisherman's Wharf,
the boosters passing out
enough quarters to get us all
on the bus and back 20 times.
"Get down in your football
stance," the others yelled to
the one man in the group who
had played football at OU.
With a little more prodding, he
executed the maneuver excel
lently. "This guy used to play
for Bud Wilkinson," came the
explanation for the strange re
quest. "Bud once said if he
could ever get him to get out of
his stance, he'd win a Heisman
trophy. But he stayed there so

long his knee atrophied and he
couldn't get up."
We climbed out on Fisher
man's Wharf and headed al
most directly to Scoma's. "I'm
so hungry I could eat a whale,"
said a housing developer in the
group. Then he looked at us
writing away furiously. "Put
that in," he said, "Okie eats
whale."
Football is vital to Oklaho
mans because it provides a
common interest.
There is no tolerance in Ok
lahoma when it comes to los
ing. Ever since Bud Wilkinson
won 47 straight games as head
Sooner coach between 1952
and 1957, the entire state has
been unaccustomed to a

scoreboard that is lit in favor of
the other team whoever that
may be. The Texas game is one
though, that must be won to
make each season a success.
"There are more high
schools in Texas than people in
Oklahoma" and that is where
the bulk of the Oklahoma re
cruits come from. When the
players that choose to go to
OU return to their home state
to play the game, an emotional
buildup precedes the game.
The ri ,iry was epitomized
this year when Texas neglected
to ask two star prep players to
partic e in the Oil Bowl, the
all-star game between
graduated high school seniors
from OklahomaandTexas. The

two had signed letters of intent
to play for OU.
"We're supposed to be rabid
fans who assault people," the
laywer informed us. "From
coast to coast we have the
reputation as the worst football
fans there are. And you know
what? It's mostly deserved."
Don't you believe it. The
Sooners are just having fun the
best way they know. Said one
fan: "I've seen every game but
one for the past 10 years. My
favorite is the time we beat
Texas 53-14. After that game,
you could walk out of there
and gladly die knowing you'd
seen everything you'd ever
want to."
