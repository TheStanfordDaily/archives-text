# Oklahoma backfield has a Lott on the run
## 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Thomas Lott led the Big Eight in touchdown passes
last year. He threw four.
The senior from San Antonio, Texas, says he's in
the wrong position. Throwing only 48 passes in his
two years at the helm of Oklahoma's offense, Lott has
carried the pigskin 282 times for 1690 yards and 19
TDs.
"Actually I'm a running back in a quarterback posi
tion," Lott says. "I played halfback most of my life,
then in high school our quarterback got hurt. They
taught me how to toss the ball and moved me there in
the middle of the game. But I knew I wasn't a quarter
back."
Apparently Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer
doesn't know the same things as Lott. "He's the best
wishbone quarterback to ever play at Oklahoma,"
Switzer says. "He's a fine passer who can hurt you
that way too."
The 5-foot-11, 204-pound Lott didn't go to Ok
lahoma to pass, however. "I went to a wishbone
school so I'd have a chance to run," he said. "I was
recruited by most of the schools in the country but
narrowed it down to three wishbone schools Ok
lahoma, Texas A&M and Texas. Oklahoma's one of
the best schools ever to play football at."
So Lott has settled temporarily in Norman and
spends every August on the practice field and every
autumn terrorizing the other schools in the Big Eight.
This past week he's been preparing to face the Cardi
nals.
The opener against Stanford is "a good game as far

as getting the team together," said the soft-spoken
QB. "This will be the first year I've started the first
game. OU hasn't started out its season well the past
few years and I'm looking forward to changing
things."
Maybe, for Stanford's sake, that won't be the case.
In any event, Lott is looking forward to the California
excursion and to playing a team which is, offensively,
quite different from his own.
"Stanford's defense is geared more to stop pas
sing," he said. "It's hard to evaluate a team you've
never played before, and we haven't seen many films.
All we can do is try."
How important is winning that first encounter of
the season?
"Very important. A win builds up a team's tempo.
It's good to start winning early because the sooner
you get your tempo, the better your season will be."
Will Lott be nervous in his debut performance of
the '7B season?
"I won't be nervous, I enjoy playing," Lott said
modestly. "I just go out there and do my best so, no -
matter what, I can leave the field with my head up."
Lott is a psychology major at OU and though sev
eral NFL teams are looking at him as a pro prospect,
he'll never depend on football.
What he can depend on, however, is the support of
the Oklahoma fans thousands of them that
follow the Sooners from town to town.
Who knows how many may make the short
jaunt to California?
"The fans are great," Lott said. "It's nice to have
people know and respect you wherever you go to
play. Our fans are a good group, but sometimes they
get carried away. They think you have to win every
game by so many points."
Apparently Oklahomans aren't content with just
winning. Perhaps that is why the Sooners are consis
tently rated in the top five nationally. This year the
Associated Press has placed them in the No. 4 spot in
the pre-season ratings. Lott agrees.
"Our defense is looking good," he said. "Every
body came back ready to play. But it's difficult to
evaluate the team in practice. We need to play
another team to really know how good we are."
About the coaching situation (three Sooner
coaches left the staff last spring) Lott said, "We still
have the nucleus of our staff. And we're a close,
experienced team we've been playing together for
two years and when you play together that long, you
already know almost everything.','
Lott obviously knows the game thoroughly. And
unlike Sports Illustrated , he's not opposed to the
inherent violence in football.
"That's the game," said Lott. "Today it's played
bigger and faster than it used to be. If you take out the
little things, it won't be football anymore. Most
players enjoy the contact, it makes it exciting."
But doesn't Lott ever look at those linemen bearing
down on him and long to turn and run toward the

opposite goal?
"No, I like the challenge of seeing how many I can
get by."
The challenge of adjusting from a metropolis to a
small town is a different story, however.
"It's a quiet town," Lott said, "not a lot of violence.
It's a good place to raise a family and settle down."
Is the QB ready to settle down, though?
"Hell, no," he laughed. "I'm ready to get out of
here. I know there's more out there for me."

Although Lott plays under the deceptive title of quarterback,
his options in the Sooner offense allow him to do
what he likes best run. Lott is certain that the 1978
season will see more aerial activity, but the 5-foot-11
Texan is satisfied pretending he's a running back.

another team to really know how good we are."
About the coaching situation (three Sooner
coaches left the staff last spring) Lott said, "We still
have the nucleus of our staff. And we're a close,
experienced team we've been playing together for
two years and when you play together that long, you
already know almost everything.','
Lott obviously knows the game thoroughly. And
unlike Sports Illustrated , he's not opposed to the
inherent violence in football.
"That's the game," said Lott. "Today it's played
bigger and faster than it used to be. If you take out the
little things, it won't be football anymore. Most
players enjoy the contact, it makes it exciting."
But doesn't Lott ever look at those linemen bearing
down on him and long to turn and run toward the

opposite goal?
"No, I like the challenge of seeing how many I can
get by."
The challenge of adjusting from a metropolis to a
small town is a different story, however.
"It's a quiet town," Lott said, "not a lot of violence.
It's a good place to raise a family and settle down."
Is the QB ready to settle down, though?
"Hell, no," he laughed. "I'm ready to get out of
here. I know there's more out there for me."

Although Lott plays under the deceptive title of quarterback,
his options in the Sooner offense allow him to do
what he likes best run. Lott is certain that the 1978
season will see more aerial activity, but the 5-foot-11
Texan is satisfied pretending he's a running back.

Today's contest against Oklahoma will be the first
opener that quarterback Thomas Lott will start for the
Sooners. Although Lott is a senior, he didn't win the
starting bid until later in the season his sophomore year,
and was plagued with injuries last season.
Thomas Lott led the Big Eight in touchdown passes
last year. He threw four.
The senior from San Antonio, Texas, says he's in
the wrong position. Throwing only 48 passes in his
two years at the helm of Oklahoma's offense, Lott has
carried the pigskin 282 times for 1690 yards and 19
TDs.
"Actually I'm a running back in a quarterback posi
tion," Lott says. "I played halfback most of my life,
then in high school our quarterback got hurt. They
taught me how to toss the ball and moved me there in
the middle of the game. But I knew I wasn't a quarter
back."
Apparently Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer
doesn't know the same things as Lott. "He's the best
wishbone quarterback to ever play at Oklahoma,"
Switzer says. "He's a fine passer who can hurt you
that way too."
The 5-foot-11, 204-pound Lott didn't go to Ok
lahoma to pass, however. "I went to a wishbone
school so I'd have a chance to run," he said. "I was
recruited by most of the schools in the country but
narrowed it down to three wishbone schools Ok
lahoma, Texas A&M and Texas. Oklahoma's one of
the best schools ever to play football at."
So Lott has settled temporarily in Norman and
spends every August on the practice field and every
autumn terrorizing the other schools in the Big Eight.
This past week he's been preparing to face the Cardi
nals.
The opener against Stanford is "a good game as far

as getting the team together," said the soft-spoken
QB. "This will be the first year I've started the first
game. OU hasn't started out its season well the past
few years and I'm looking forward to changing
things."
Maybe, for Stanford's sake, that won't be the case.
In any event, Lott is looking forward to the California
excursion and to playing a team which is, offensively,
quite different from his own.
"Stanford's defense is geared more to stop pas
sing," he said. "It's hard to evaluate a team you've
never played before, and we haven't seen many films.
All we can do is try."
How important is winning that first encounter of
the season?
"Very important. A win builds up a team's tempo.
It's good to start winning early because the sooner
you get your tempo, the better your season will be."
Will Lott be nervous in his debut performance of
the '7B season?
"I won't be nervous, I enjoy playing," Lott said
modestly. "I just go out there and do my best so, no -
matter what, I can leave the field with my head up."
Lott is a psychology major at OU and though sev
eral NFL teams are looking at him as a pro prospect,
he'll never depend on football.
What he can depend on, however, is the support of
the Oklahoma fans thousands of them that
follow the Sooners from town to town.
Who knows how many may make the short
jaunt to California?
"The fans are great," Lott said. "It's nice to have
people know and respect you wherever you go to
play. Our fans are a good group, but sometimes they
get carried away. They think you have to win every
game by so many points."
Apparently Oklahomans aren't content with just
winning. Perhaps that is why the Sooners are consis
tently rated in the top five nationally. This year the
Associated Press has placed them in the No. 4 spot in
the pre-season ratings. Lott agrees.
"Our defense is looking good," he said. "Every
body came back ready to play. But it's difficult to
evaluate the team in practice. We need to play
another team to really know how good we are."
