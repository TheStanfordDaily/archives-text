# Ralphie: Band's alter ego
## LSJUMB buffaloes public 
### John Nielsen 
To the Incomparables, there
may be but one analogy. Col
orado University's mascot,
known only as "Ralphie the
Buffalo," uncannily resembles
Stanford's own beast, the
LSJUMB. Like LSJUMB, Ralphie
tends to leave in his wake tan
gible and olfactory evidence of
his passage.
Like Ralphie, the Band is
loathed and feared by all who
cross its path. These two or
ganisms frequently defy their
handlers, and find it their onus
to defile even the most sacred
territories and traditions. Ral
phie is perversely lovable; so is

the Stanford Band. Both are
hulking, ugly, reeking embod
iments of the dark side of
human nature.
Yet this all pales beside the
central achievement, an
achievement that sets LSJUMB
and Ralphie apart from other
mild and sundry pretenders to
gridiron legitimacy. That
achievement, of course, is yc
lept Inspiration. Ralphie and
LSJUMB do not merely mollify
their audience and convince
them to contribute to the
Alumni Association; they whip
a crowd into a mindless frenzy
that borders on the apocalyp
tic. Seeing either creature at its
height is a truly unforgetable

experience. It makes believers
of all members incorporate in
the Great Chain of Collegiate
Being. It is an orgiastic, primal
paroxysm, an illimitable cauld
ron of angst there exists,
you'll see, no higher state.
(Editor's note: John Nielsen
used to be a Boy Scout. He
used to play Little League
baseball. Friends used to enjoy
taking him home to their pa
rents. Last year the Daily sent
John to cover the Band. He has
never been the same. We're
sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Nielsen.)

It is a widespread misconception that the average intelligence,
etiquette, couth and redeeming social value of the Stanford student
body is reflected in their band. It's not the band is above average.

Even though they aren't musicians (all the time), the LSJUMB tries to
display SOME talent when they're in front of all those contributing
alumni. They pound on kegs, play dead, play the fiddle and act like
drunken loonies, be drunken loonies and act like they can play the
fiddle and spell words on the field. Sometimes.
