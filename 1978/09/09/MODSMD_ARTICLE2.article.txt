# Cards take on tough opener at home
## Can Stanford break OU wishbone? 
### Bruce Anderson 
Welcome to the Stanford
football team's yearly baptism
by fire, the annual ritual in
which the Cardinals seek out
the most difficult team availa
ble with which to open the sea
son, then take the field confi
dent and full of hope, and later
leave it wishing they had stayed
back at the Ramada Inn and
watched cartoons.
This early September rite is
so brutal that it usually trans
pires in the privacy of College
Park, Pa., or Boulder, Colo.
But this year, for the benefit
of hordes of neophyte Stan
ford fans, the Cardinals have
decided to bring the quickest,
stingiest, orneriest eleven they
could find into Stanford
Stadium for the opener.
Hard to please
They found a team which
plays serious football. They
found a team whose suppor
ters scoff at five straight Big
Eight titles, laugh at last year's
No. 7 ranking and bellyache
about a 10-2 record. They
found a team with the best re
cord (51-5-2) in college football
over the past five seasons.
They found a team whose fans
will come 9000 strong to
California for a nonconference
game. In short, theyfound Ok
lahoma.
Oklahoma was a great
choice for the annual
masochistic pounding en
dured by the Cards in the sea
son opener. The Sooners re
turn 15 starters from last year's
Orange Bowl squad, including
four Ail-Americans linebac
kers George Cumby and Daryl
Hunt, nose guard Reggie Kin
law and offensive guard Greg
Roberts and quarterback
Thomas Lott, the man Sooner
head coach Barry Switzer calls

"the best wishbone quarter
back ever to play at Ok
lahoma."
All this notwithstanding,
Stanford remains calm. The
Cards, despite a 27-21 loss in
the opener to Colorado last
season, finished the season 9-3
after downing LSU 24-14 in the
Sun Bowl.
"There is a great deal of
pride on this team after last
season," Stanford quarterback
Steve Dils said Monday. "No
one on our team is out to make
this game the whole season. If
we win, it'savery, very bigwin,
but win or lose it's not the sea
son."
Dils is right. Last year is tes
timony to the fact that one
game, particularly the first,
does not a season make. He is
also right when he says a win
would be very big. The Cards
have not won the season
opener since 1972 when they
opened with a 44-0 whitewash
of San Jose State.
Oklahoma!
But it is not San Jose State the
Cardinals open with this after
noon. It is Oklahoma, a five
time national championship
team. It is Oklahoma, a team
which built championships on
the granite defense of. Ail-
Americans like Rod Shoate,
Zack Henderson and the Sel
mon brothers Dewey, Luci
ous and Leroy. It is Oklahoma,
a team which has exploited the
pyrotechnic possibilities of the
wishbone offense to a greater
extent than any other team.
The Sooners rushed for an
NCAA record 472.4 yards per
game in 1971. Last year they led
the nation in rushing with a
much more modest average of
328.9 yards per contest.
Sooner quarterback Thomas
Lott directs one of the fastest

backfields anywhere. Lott not
only exercises the options of
the wishbone and directs ball
flow, but with 760 yards and 12
TDs was the top rusher on a '77
squad which included Elvis
Peacock. Walsh said the Cards
expect Sooner fullback Kenny
King, a 5-foot-11, 203-pound
Texan, to carry 20 or 30 times
today. Last year he plowed his
way to 640 yards with a 5.6 av
erage.
Reduced air rates
The Sooners only go to the
air for surprise they aver
aged more than 20 yards a re
ception and when the
ground game falters, which
isn't often seeing as OU threw
little more than six times a
game last year. If the Sooners
do bog down within proximity
of the Stanford goal line, the
Sooners will not hesitate to
send in placekicker Uwe Von
Schamman. The German-born
Texan laced the uprights on all
47 PAT attempts last season and
converted on 14 of 23 field go
als, including one from 58
yards against Oklahoma State.
The Sooners will attack a
Stanford defense which only
ranked ahead of anemic Ore
gon last year in the Pac-8. But
with improved speed, added
experience and a switch to a 3-4
defense, the Cardinals hope to
close down the Sooner rushing
attack in the same manner they
shut off LSU in the second half
of the Sun Bowl. The key to
Stanford's defensive fortunes
will be the mixing of defensive
sets, execution of one-on-one
tackles and the play of the
linebackers.
Senior linebacker Gordy
Ceresino set a Stanford record
for tackles, with 174 last year,


Oklahoma wishbone and Stanford air game notwithstanding, today's
contest between-the Sooners and the Cardinals features some top
defensive players. Stanford linebacker Gordy Ceresino (No. 95
above) was named the Most Valuable Lineman in the Sun Bowl last
December. Sooner middle guard Reggie Kinlaw (No. 62 below) is a
returning All-American who spearheads the Oklahoma defense.
