# OU coach rides tempest
## Controversy doesn't buck Switzer 
### Bruce Anderson 
In his first five seasons as the
head football coach at Ok
lahoma, Barry Switzer has led
the Sooners to two national
championships and five Big
Eight titles while compiling a
51-5-2 record that is un
matched over those five years.
Yet last spring speculation
swept the Oklahoman flatlands
like a Sooner duststorm that
the University of Oklahoma
was going to ask Switzer to res
ign in the wake of the unex
pected resignations of three of
his assistant coaches, resigna
tions that had Norman seeth
ing with rumors. Switzer, how
ever, survived the maelstrom
as he had the others which
have punctuated his brilliant
but turbulent tenure at Ok
lahoma.
Raised in an impoverished
family in Crossett, Ark.,
Switzer earned a scholarship to
the University of Arkansas after
being selected the high school
lineman of the year for the
state. At Fayetteville he cap
tained the 1959 Razorback
squad.
After a year in the Army,
Switzer joined Frank Broyle's
staff at Arkansas. In 1966
Switzer became an assistant
coach at OU. When Sooner
head coach Chuck Fairbanks
left Oklahoma after the '72 sea
son to coach the New England
Patriots, Switzer, who had in

stalled the dramatically suc
cessful wishbone offense
while offensive coordinator,
was the unanimous choice of
an OU search committee to re
place Fairbanks.
Less than three months after
Switzer assumed the reins, OU
was placed on probation for
the third time in 20 years.
It was not a good cir
cumstance under which to
debut as head coach. But
Switzer seems to prosper with
adversity. Ineligible for bowl
berths or national TV appear
ances appearances often
vital to successful recruiting
the Sooners finished with a
10-0-1 record and the brides
maid spot in the postseason
poll.
Hard-pressed to improve
upon his freshman coaching
performance, Switzer did so
anyway. In his second season
the Sooners swept away all op
position on the way to a perfect
11-0 mark.
In 1975 OU went through the
regular season with the
only blemish on their re
cord a 23-3 upset loss to Kan
sas. Oklahoma brushed aside
Michigan 14-6 in the Orange
Bowl to finish 11-1 and repeat
as national champions, an ac
complishment achieved only
once before by Bud Wilkin
son Oklahoma teams in 1955
and '56.
The next season Switzer's

Sooners went 8-2-1, beat
Wyoming 41-7 in the Fiesta
Bowl and kept the nation's
presses fueled with conflict.
First, Darrell Royal, an OU
turncoat who coached at Texas
for more than two decades,
leveled spying charges at
Switzer and his top assistant.
But the incident that really
stoked the fires and aroused
the flames of passion in many
OU fans was a front page story
in the Oklahoma City Times
which reported that the NCAA
was conducting another inves
tigation of the Sooner football
program.
The story was true. A week
and a half after the Times ran
the story, the NCAA confirmed
the existence of such an inves
tigation. Switzer and his team
were in the cauldron again.
But there were no cries for
the football program to clean
up. It was churning out vic
tories as it was supposed to.
The outrage against the Times,
however, was volcanic. Frank
Boggs, one of two writers who
uncovered the investigation,
required a police escort for
four days.
The clouds of controversy
seem always to be gathered on
the Norman horizon. This
spring they brought with them
the biggest storm to disrupt the
OU campus since Switzer be
came head coach. And this

Barry Switzer, 40, has coached the Sooners to a remarkable 51-5-2
record in five years at Norman but his tenure has been anything but a
calm one. Through it all Switzer has weathered the storms and now
seeks to bring OU its sixth national championship.
