# Oklahoma football is no laughing matter to Sooners, but the head man at Norman keeps a sense of humor anyway
## 
### 
In spite of the seriousness
with which Oklahomans
take their football and the
turmoil which seems to
routinely engulf the football
program at Norman, 40-
year-old head coach Barry
Switzer has kept his sense of
humor.
The Arkansas native is an
eloquent man who is a favo
rite with both the press,
with whom he talks in
quotes, and the banquet
circuit, where he is both a
humorous and forceful
speaker.
A few Switzer pearls fol
low.
On his ambition to be
come the first permanent
all-star football head coach:

"You have a good time, play
golf in the morning and a
week after the game no
body remembers who won
or who coached the
loser."
On Oklahoma's run
oriented wishbone offense:
"When our receivers do
cartwheels coming out of
the huddle you know it's
going to be a pass."
After being told that
the date of the Arizona
State-UCLA football game in
1976 was changed because it
originally coincided with
Arizona's primary election:
"In Oklahoma we would
have changed the date of
the election."
Switzer speaks freely.

"I always give an honest
answer but sometimes this
is a mistake. But I can live
with an honest mistake."
His speaking talents make
Switzer a formidable recrui
ter and enhance his ability
to arouse Sooner teams for
games.
"The key to our program
is individual pride and moti
vation," Switzer says.
"Players knowing who they
are, knowing they are play
ingforOklahoma, generally
is enough motivational rein
forcement.
"Theyfeel a responsibility
to play to their optimum,
meeting the challenge of
those who came before and
played here."
