# The 						original Okie-D
## Cardinals debut with new defense 
### Bob Rudy 
When Stanford opens its
football season today against
Oklahoma, it will be trying
to stop the Sooner's pewerful
running attack by using the
"Oklahoma defense."
The "Oklahoma defense,"
or "Okie D," was a special de
fensive alignment used by Ok
lahoma's opponents in the
early and mid-1950s to contain
the highly successful Bud Wil
kinson teams of those days. It
is now more descriptively cal
led the 3-4 defense.
By whatever name, this de
fense deploys three linemen
and four linebackers. Until re
cently, most college and pro
teams were using four linemen
(remember the "Fearsome
Foursome?") and three
linebackers. It was called, ap
propriately enough, the 4-3 de
fense.
Several teams have changed
to the 3-4 because it gives their
defense more flexibility and
unpredictability. With four
men standing up and back

from the line of scrimmage in
stead of three, it is easier to see
what the offense might do and
is supposedly easier to pursue
the ball. As opposed to the 4-3,
which relies on brute strength
and a certain amount of ag
gressiveness, the 3-4 is de
signed for speed and decep
tion.
As Fred vonAppen, Stan
ford's defensive line coach,
puts it, "It's the Brer Rabbit
concept you invite them to
run someplace, but it's not as
inviting as it might look."
After considering all its ad
vantages, and taking a close
look at their personnel, the
Cardinal coaches decided that
they, too, will give the 3-4 a try
in 1978.
"We decided to use our
linebackers because we have
so many good ones," says de
fensive coordinator Norb
Hecker. "We'll put four in the
ball game. In some cases we
might even putfive or six in the
ball game."
Both staff and players are op

timistic about the new system.
They are hoping to improve a
defense that finished seventh
in the Pacific-8 Conference in
both rushing defense (226
yards per game) and total de
fense (401 yards per game).
When the coaches ap
proached the team with plans
for the change, most players
had little or no trouble accept
ing it. "First of all," says Hecker
describing the process, "the
coaches have to be sold on the
defense. Then we sell it to the
players, like a product. If
you're sold on the .product,
then it's easy to sell the
players."
Although he plans to be
ready for the season debut,
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
hasn't quite bought the whole
package yet. "From a personal
standpoint," Ceresino says,
"no, I don't like it. I'm a 4-3
linebacker."
Ceresino, an All-America
prospect who made a school
record 174 tackles last season,
readily admits though, that the
new alignment will be better
for the team as a whole.
According to the staff, Cere
sino will be the key to the de
fense. Head coach Bill Walsh
has said that, "it's hard for me
to imagine a better college
linebacker than Ceresino."
But, admits the 6-foot-2
senior, "I'm still not ready for it
yet. I've gone through 20 prac

tices in the spring, I've gone
through 40 out here (fall prac
tice), so I've been through 60
practices and I'm still not ready
to run it."
Ceresino may be a "genuine
4-3 linebacker,"- agrees
Hecker, but the rest of the
linebacking crew are definitely
3-4 men. Steve Budinger, Milt
McColl, Bo Boxold and Tom
Hall all played the 3-4 in high
school and are comfortable
with it.
To say that the Stanford
coaching staff is pinning its
hopes on its linebackers is no
understatement. "Our overall
success in 1978," emphasizes
Walsh, "may hinge on an excel
lent performance by our
linebackers."
Another key position in the

new defense is that of nose
guard, the man who plays the
middle spot on the defensive
line. His job is to neutralize the
center of the offensive line and
allow the linebackers to then
flow to the ball. If executed
well, the nose guard will usu
ally draw a double-team from
the opposition. This can tend
to put the nose guard- in a
somewhat vulnerable position.
Some professional nose
guards have come to think of
themselves as "sacrificial
lambs" because, according to
some, they do all the dirty work
so the linebackers can make
the tackles (and, they allege,
the headlines).
Hesitant to put it in such
stark terms, Hecker nonethe
less concedes, "I don't want to
use 'sacrificial lamb,' but
sometimes you have to give up
your body to make things
work."
The man most likely to be
making "sacrifices" for the
Cardinals at nose guard is
sophomore Marty Fuentes.
Fuentes is 6-foot-2 and 220
pounds, which vonAppen de
scribes as "a little undersized."
According to the line coach,
however, what he lacks in size
he more than makes up for in
speed and quickness.
Maintaining that he could
understand why others might
consider themselves "sacrifi
cial," Fuentes quickly noted
that he likes his position and
that, "I'll get my share of
plays."
Regarding the efficiency of
the new defense as opposed to
the old one, the nose guard
says, "We knew right away it
was going to work better."
Displaying few, if any, reser
vations himself, vonAppen
mentioned an appealing as
pect of the 3-4 system. "I think
anytime you have the capacity
to put people in the position
where they can see the flow of
the offense . . . and you get a
lot of folks to the football, then
it has a tendency to ignite your
people defensively."
Considering that Oklahoma
led the nation in rushing in
1977 (329 yards per game), the
Cardinals will need all the igni
tion they can muster.
