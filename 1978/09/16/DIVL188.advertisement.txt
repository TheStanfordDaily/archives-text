Chinese
can't be wrong.
According to an old Chinese saying,
"For the good life, it is best to be born
in Soo Chow, to live in Hang Chow,
and to eat in Canton." Soo Chow for
its beautiful people; Hang Chow for its
spectacular landscape; and Canton
for its unmatched excellence in food.
No small distinction in a country
as devoted to the culinary arts as
China. So it is with Ming's of Palo
Alto. For over 22 years, we have
consistently presented the highest
examples of Cantonese food—served
by a meticulous staff in a simple,
elegant atmosphere—and have de
servedly earned the reputation as
"an Institution on the Peninsula."
Stop by Ming's and find out for
yourself why Cantonese cooking is
the best of all Chinese cuisines.
