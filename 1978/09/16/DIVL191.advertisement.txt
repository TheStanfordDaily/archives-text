HANDHELD CALCULATORS:
WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
BEFORE YOU BUY.
Your college work habits will
surely influence your professional
work habits. If you're in science,
engineering or business, a hand
held calculator will be an
essential element in molding
those habits. That's why it's
so important to make the correct
choice of a calculator now.
Which is why we prepared a
brochure entitled, "The Student's
Choice... The Professional's
Choice... The Logical Choice!' In
it, you'll read about every
thing you should consider before
buying your college calculator.
Things like calculator construc
tion, ease-of-use, logic systems
and more. Pick up a free copy at
your bookstore or nearest
Hewlett-Packard dealer. For the
address, CALL TOLL-FREE
800-648-4711 except from Hawaii
or Alaska. In Nevada call
800-992-5710. And do it soon.
Because we think buying a
calculator should be one of your
most carefully calculated decisions.
