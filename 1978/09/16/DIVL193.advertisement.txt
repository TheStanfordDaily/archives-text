Serving the freshest
tasting pizza around!
Everything tastes fresh on a Round Table pizza. First our
dough is made and rolled fresh daily. Then, when you
order, your pizza is prepared right before your eyes.
Choose from 17 varieties, including garden grown mush
rooms, green peppers, tomatoes, and lots, lots more. Our
meats are lean and tender and, of course, there's plenty
of glorious golden cheese. Fresh tasting pizza... that's
why The Round Table's first with pizza people!
