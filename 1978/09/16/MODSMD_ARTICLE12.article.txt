# Band tries to cash in on TV appearance
## LSJUMB seeks fall series 
### John Nielsen 
The Band has a chance to be
on TV today and this has
caused considerable excite
ment among the musical types
who frequent the Bank Shak.
Provided we come up with
an appropriately "action
packed, chiller-thriller for
you" (chorus, fanfare, mul
timilliondollar logo shot with
cut to lead-pipe and chain
segment of Starsky and
Hutch); provided we think up a
halftime feature that takes full
advantage of the artistic and
conceptual innovations
achieved by such industry
breakthroughs as Mr. Ed, My
Mother the Car (a 1928 Porter),
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., The
Dating Game, The All-New Dat
ing Game and The Full-Frontal
Nudity Dating Game with
Charo, Paul Lynde, Richard
Dawson, Orson Welles, plus
your host Mr. Tim Conway;
provided we work out a five
minute skit cutting at the very
moral fiber of all American
tradition; provided we do all
that and at the same time no
body mentions Fred Silver
man, we think that this could
be a very big break.
If the Band gets on the tube
and is favorably received by
whatever portion of the TV au
dience is not watching Star
Trek reruns, then we can get a
game show of our own, or

maybe even bated breath
a series.
The game show, it has been
suggested, will be called Battle
of the Handicapped Celebrities
and will feature different col
ored doors and boxes contain
ing either medieval weaponry
or poisonous snakes de
pending upon whether or not
participants remember to
make sure their answers are in
the form of a question.
And the series, well, itwill be
a situation comedyâ€”of course
in which a rollicking band of
fun-loving musicians search
out crime and excitement. If
that doesn't work we will be
willing to play the lead in any
contemplated spin-offs from
The Partridge Family, The Brady
Bunch or Lost in Space, or
make a cameo appearance as a
mysterious stranger in Love of
our Lost Lives.
The point is that we want to
do this right. This halftime
show is very important. We
need a big crowd reaction
more than anything else so as
to get ABC's attention away
from the Dollies. And in that
sense, it doesn't matter what
the show is about, or what we
play. Never mind the descrip
tion of what we have arranged.
All you have to do is follow the
cue cards and we're on our
way.
Charlie's Angels , move over.

With typical optimism, the Band is already planning the series it will be starring in soon after its TV
appearance today. Of course, the more obscene, explicit and perverted the show the better, but it may
have to settle for a remake of something as culturally worthwhile as "Celebrity Bowling."
