# Cards remember San Jose State
## Looking for first win, Stanford recalls near debacle of 1977 
### Bruce Anderson 
Remember San Jose State?
It's that funky former
teachers' college walled in by
six-lane highways and gas sta
tions.
Remember? It gave us Harry
Edwards, the sociology profes
sor who started the black
athletes' movement during the
'6os. And it gave us the chief
Edwards disciple Spartan
Tommie Smith, the bad-boy
sprinter who raised his fist dur
ing the national anthem at the
1968 Olympics as an expres
sion of racial solidarity.
The first Togo's sandwich
shop sprouted up on the edge
of the Spartan campus. Re
member the sorority girls that
Stanford guys are always trying
to hustle? Right. They come
from San Jose State.
Ittakes no prodding for Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh to re
member San Jose State. He
graduated from the South Bay
campus in 1954. More recent
than graduation, however,
Walsh remembers last year's
Stanford-San Jose State foot
ball game. The Cards' narrow
31-26 victory permeates his
thoughts about this year's
game.
"If this is an errorless game,
or the errors are kept to a
minimum, we should win,"
Walsh said. "We'll have to be
penalized on touchdowns,
make some crucial fumbles,
throw some interceptions and
have a trick play work against
us to lose this game. That al
most happened last year."
For those who don't re
member last year's game, a lit
tle more prodding.
Stanford, ahead 24-6 at the
end of the third quarter, gave
up 20 points in the final period
and did not put the game away
until linebacker Ray Cardinalli
snagged an Ed Luther pass in

Stanford territory with less
than 20 seconds remaining.
The Cards dissected the
Spartan defense for 561 yards
and didn't punt once the entire
game. Instead they gave up the
ball on six turnovers three
interceptions and three fum
bles.
It was a game in which a San
Jose State TD brought an ova
tion from the Stanford rooting
section. The reason? The scor
ing strike came on a 35-yard
double-reverse flea flicker. It
brought the Spartans to within
five points, 24-19.
It was also a game in which
Darrin Nelson broke all sorts of
Stanford rushing records and
San Jose State quarterback Ed
Luther went wild throwing in
the second half.
When the Cards and Spar
tans last met, Spartan coach
Lynn Stiles' squad was struggl
ing in a futile effort to reach
.500, coming into the game at
4-5, while the Cards were tot
ing an impressive 6-3 mark.
This year roles are reversed
with the Spartans 1-0 after a
31-14 clobbering of Idaho State
and the Cards still looking for
their first win after dropping
their opener 35-29 to
Okalahoma (rated No. 2 and
No. 3 in the two national polls
this week).
"We have so many things to
be improved that we're not a
complete team yet," Walsh
said. "But by the end of this
game we may very well be
one."
The Stanford coaching staff
capitalized on the fact that
school has not yet reconvened
and ran two-a-day practices
early this week.
"We're not going to overlook
this game, nor are we going to
worry about the fact that we
might get beat," Walsh said.
"I thought it would be to our

advantage to play Stanford
early in the season/' Stiles
said. "I thought they would gel
later in the season. After seeing
the Oklahoma game, however,
we realize they are much
further along than we ex
pected."
Contrasting his Spartans to
the Sooners Stanford faced a
week ago, Stiles said, "We
have more of an open attack
and we will not be as effective
as Oklahoma at keeping the
ball away from Stanford's of
fense. It could end up being a
track meet if both offenses live
up to their potentials."
Walsh disagrees.
"I don't expect a high

scoring game," Walsh said. "I
would be disappointed if it
were. I'm looking for an im
proved defense over last sea
son."
Which coach will be right?
For Stiles to be correct his
quarterback, junior Ed Luther,
will have to improve over last
week when he completed 10 of
27 for 194 yards.
"Ed Luther had four passes
dropped Saturday," Stiles said.
"He also had to throw several
out of bounds because of an
intensive pass rush. All in all, I
felt he played a courageous
game. Of course, he is capable
of playing better."
How well the Cards know

that. In the second half of last
year's game he completed 13 of
17 passes for 200 yards.
Against Idaho State last week
one of Luther's passes was a
69-yard TD strike to Jewerl
Thomas, the offensive star of
the opener. A transfer from
UCLA, the 5-foot-11, 217-
pound halfback rushed for 101
yards and one touchdown on
15 carries and grabbed two
passes for 73 yards. He was
named the PCAA offensive
player of the week.
The Stanford defense, which
yielded 375 yards to the Ok
lahoma running attack last
Saturday, will have to contain

fullback Kevin Cole as well as
Thomas. Cole rushed for 72
yards on 11 carries and caught
three passes for 43 yards
against Idaho State.
Last week the Cards revealed
their much talked of 3-4 de
fense, but went to a five
linebacker alignment much of
the game contest.
"We will go back to a more
conventional defense this
week as we face-a more con
ventional offense," Walsh
said.
Who knows what kind of de
fense Stiles will try to come up
with to stop the Card attack?
No matter what the defense,
senior linebacker Frank Man
umaleuna will anchor it. "The
Mowin' Samoan" had 15 tack
les last week, including 10
solos, and was named RCAA
defensive player of the week.
Fie will face a much sterner
challenge than Idaho State to
day.
With 32 completions in 48 at
tempts last week for 299 yards
and three touchdowns, Stan

ford quarterback Steve Dils
leads the nation in passing.
Fullback Phil Francis, with nine
catches, shares the national
lead for receptions. Francis
also rushed for 62 yards on 12
carries prompting Walsh to
say, "Francis played his best
game ever at Stanford."
Ken Margerum, starting his
first game at wide receiver,
hauled in six passes for 74 yards
and two touchdowns.
Senior flanker Vince Mulroy,
who missed the opening game

because of a sprained ankle, is
expected to see action against
the Spartans.
But the man the Spartan de
fense must stop is Darrin Nel
son.
'I hope we can contain Dar
rin Nelson better than last
year," Stiles said.
Last year Nelson set a Stan
ford single-game record by
carving through the Spartan
defense for 211 yards on 20 car
ries.

Ittakes no prodding for Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh to re
member San Jose State. He
graduated from the South Bay
campus in 1954. More recent
than graduation, however,
Walsh remembers last year's
Stanford-San Jose State foot
ball game. The Cards' narrow
31-26 victory permeates his
thoughts about this year's
game.
"If this is an errorless game,
or the errors are kept to a
minimum, we should win,"
Walsh said. "We'll have to be
penalized on touchdowns,
make some crucial fumbles,
throw some interceptions and
have a trick play work against
us to lose this game. That al
most happened last year."
For those who don't re
member last year's game, a lit

Stanford, ahead 24-6 at the
end of the third quarter, gave
up 20 points in the final period
and did not put the game away
until linebacker Ray Cardinalli
snagged an Ed Luther pass in

Stanford territory with less
than 20 seconds remaining.
The Cards dissected the
Spartan defense for 561 yards
and didn't punt once the entire
game. Instead they gave up the
ball on six turnovers three
interceptions and three fum
bles.
It was a game in which a San
Jose State TD brought an ova
tion from the Stanford rooting
section. The reason? The scor
ing strike came on a 35-yard
double-reverse flea flicker. It
brought the Spartans to within
five points, 24-19.
It was also a game in which
Darrin Nelson broke all sorts of
Stanford rushing records and
San Jose State quarterback Ed
Luther went wild throwing in
the second half.
When the Cards and Spar
tans last met, Spartan coach
Lynn Stiles' squad was struggl
ing in a futile effort to reach
.500, coming into the game at
4-5, while the Cards were tot
ing an impressive 6-3 mark.
This year roles are reversed
with the Spartans 1-0 after a
31-14 clobbering of Idaho State
and the Cards still looking for
their first win after dropping
their opener 35-29 to
Okalahoma (rated No. 2 and
No. 3 in the two national polls
this week).
"We have so many things to
be improved that we're not a
complete team yet," Walsh
said. "But by the end of this
game we may very well be
one."
The Stanford coaching staff
capitalized on the fact that
school has not yet reconvened
and ran two-a-day practices
early this week.
"We're not going to overlook
this game, nor are we going to
worry about the fact that we
might get beat," Walsh said.
"I thought it would be to our

advantage to play Stanford
early in the season/' Stiles
said. "I thought they would gel
later in the season. After seeing
the Oklahoma game, however,
we realize they are much
further along than we ex
pected."
Contrasting his Spartans to
the Sooners Stanford faced a
week ago, Stiles said, "We
have more of an open attack
and we will not be as effective
as Oklahoma at keeping the
ball away from Stanford's of
fense. It could end up being a
track meet if both offenses live
up to their potentials."
Walsh disagrees.
"I don't expect a high

scoring game," Walsh said. "I
would be disappointed if it
were. I'm looking for an im
proved defense over last sea
son."
Which coach will be right?
For Stiles to be correct his
quarterback, junior Ed Luther,
will have to improve over last
week when he completed 10 of
27 for 194 yards.
"Ed Luther had four passes
dropped Saturday," Stiles said.
"He also had to throw several
out of bounds because of an
intensive pass rush. All in all, I
felt he played a courageous
game. Of course, he is capable
of playing better."
How well the Cards know

that. In the second half of last
year's game he completed 13 of
17 passes for 200 yards.
Against Idaho State last week
one of Luther's passes was a
69-yard TD strike to Jewerl
Thomas, the offensive star of
the opener. A transfer from
UCLA, the 5-foot-11, 217-
pound halfback rushed for 101
yards and one touchdown on
15 carries and grabbed two
passes for 73 yards. He was
named the PCAA offensive
player of the week.

Saturday, will have to contain

three passes for 43 yards
against Idaho State.
Last week the Cards revealed
their much talked of 3-4 de

the game contest.
"We will go back to a more
conventional defense this
week as we face-a more con

said.
Who knows what kind of de

with to stop the Card attack?

With 32 completions in 48 at

and three touchdowns, Stan

ford quarterback Steve Dils

Fullback Phil Francis, with nine
catches, shares the national
lead for receptions. Francis
also rushed for 62 yards on 12
carries prompting Walsh to
say, "Francis played his best

Ken Margerum, starting his
first game at wide receiver,
hauled in six passes for 74 yards
and two touchdowns.
Senior flanker Vince Mulroy,
who missed the opening game

because of a sprained ankle, is
expected to see action against
the Spartans.
But the man the Spartan de
fense must stop is Darrin Nel
son.

Last year Nelson set a Stan
ford single-game record by
carving through the Spartan
defense for 211 yards on 20 car
