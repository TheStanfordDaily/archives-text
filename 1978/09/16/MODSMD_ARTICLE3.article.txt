# Gridders ply talents in fine arts
## Card back knows all the strings 
### Chris Haft 
The talents of Stanford freshman
LaMott Atkins spread from American
gridirons to European concert halls.
As a halfback who gained 1054 yards
last year at Lake Washington High in
Kirkland, Wash., Atkins comes to the
Farm as one of coach Bill Walsh's top
rushing prospects for the future.
However, Atkins has already known
huge success as a concert violinist.
LaMott was also a member of the Na
tional Youth Choir which toured
Europe in the summer of 1976 and per
formed at Carnegie Hall on the nation's
Bicentennial.
In both his athletic and musical en
deavors, Atkins continues to practice
and learn.
Atkins began playing the violin in the
fourth grade. Then, says LaMott, "I was
at the age where you'll do something if

people just ask you to," Atkins said.
"So one day some of my teachers said,
'You'd make a good violinist. . . .' "
Atkins' parents always encouraged
him in music, though they chose to ig
nore their son's initial scrapings, re
legating LaMott to the bathroom
whenever he practiced.
LaMott had the advantage of living
near Seattle, the cultural center of the
Northwest. As his violin playing im
proved, Atkins discovered the benefits
that the Seattle area had to offer for
youngsters inclined towards the arts.
"There were all kinds of groups you
could get into," he said. "Youth sym
phony, orchestras, an all-state sym
phony, and church organizations."
The fact that Atkins was an ac
complished musician and a fine foot
ball player made him a special figure.

Freshman LaMott Atkins relaxes after practice by playing his violin. The gifted
musician also plays the viola and piano, dabbles with the cello and guitar, and
performs as often in the concert hall as on the football field.
"People always said of me,
'What a unique person' that
sort of thing," LaMott said
modestly.
He also plays the viola and
piano, and dabbles with the
cello and guitar. He enjoys all
kinds of music, but prefers
playing classical on the violin
and pop and jazz on the piano.
An average practice session
for LaMott lasts about an hour,
though he often plays for two
or even three hours.
Joy, he said, is the reason
why he plays. "It makes me
happy. When I'm down and
out, I play music to feel good.'
Other people smoke to relax; I
have the violin."
Public performances remain
troublesome for Atkins,
though he knows the basis for
this problem. "With my ex
perience, I shouldn't be nerv
ous. It's just a case of concen
trating more on what I'm do
ing."
One such performance,

however, produced laughs
rather than anxiety for the
Cards' music man. One year in
high school, the guys bet the
girls that they couldn't come to
school for a day without
makeup.
The girls lost, and had to take
the guys out to dinner. Atkins
helped make this a memorable
occasion by dressing in a
tuxedo and serenading
everyone.
LaMott is glad to be in the
San Francisco area and plans to
take advantage of its cultural
scene. He looks forward to at
tending plays, concerts and re
citals. "There's a lot more here
than even in Washington," he
said.
Now that he's here, Atkins
hopes that Stanford will help
further his musical develop
ment. "I'd like to get into some
kind of group that will teach
me more about entertaining
and its procedures," he said.
Atkins, who also enjoys act
ing, wants to continue as an en

tertainer after college. "I'd re
ally like to get into acting
where I perform musically
movies, musicals, maybe
nightclub singing," he said. He
would remain strictly a vio
linist, he explained, only if he
became good enough to be a
solo performer.
During college, of course,
LaMott will be playing a con
siderable amount of football.
This year he is pegged for bac
kup duty behind Darrin Nelson
and Billy Anderson, though he
should see more action as the
season goes on.
"I'm very pleased with
LaMott," said running back
coach Dennis Green. "He has
tremendous speed (9.7 in the
100) and good instincts.
"Basically, LaMott's biggest
problem right now is catching
the football," Green said. "His
team in high school ran a
wishbone, so he didn't have
the opportunity to catch too
many passes. He realizes this,
and he's working hard as a re

ceiver."
Thus, Atkins the musician
will have to yield somewhat to
Atkins the football player. "I've
been broadening myself out so
much I haven't been practicing
the violin as much as I should,"
he conceded.
Yet LaMottwill never experi
ence a real conflict between
the two activities.
"At football practice, I'm
physically working hard, I'm
tense throughout, and gener
ally kind of hyper," he said.
"Then I come to my room and
play the violin. It's a good way
to finish off the day."
Occasionally, Atkins added,
music blends with football.
"Sometimes when I'm working
hard on the field, I think of a
concerto or another piece of
music building up to a climax.
Then the climax comes when. I
score a touchdown."
LaMott Atkins knows the
rage of the football field and
the peace of the music room
and revels in both.

scene. He looks forward to at
tending plays, concerts and re
citals. "There's a lot more here
than even in Washington," he
said.
Now that he's here, Atkins
hopes that Stanford will help
further his musical develop
ment. "I'd like to get into some
kind of group that will teach
me more about entertaining
and its procedures," he said.
Atkins, who also enjoys act
ing, wants to continue as an en

tertainer after college. "I'd re
ally like to get into acting
where I perform musically
movies, musicals, maybe
nightclub singing," he said. He
would remain strictly a vio
linist, he explained, only if he
became good enough to be a
solo performer.
During college, of course,
LaMott will be playing a con
siderable amount of football.
This year he is pegged for bac
kup duty behind Darrin Nelson
and Billy Anderson, though he
should see more action as the
season goes on.
"I'm very pleased with
LaMott," said running back
coach Dennis Green. "He has
tremendous speed (9.7 in the
100) and good instincts.
"Basically, LaMott's biggest
problem right now is catching
the football," Green said. "His
team in high school ran a
wishbone, so he didn't have
the opportunity to catch too
many passes. He realizes this,
and he's working hard as a re

ceiver."
Thus, Atkins the musician
will have to yield somewhat to
Atkins the football player. "I've
been broadening myself out so
much I haven't been practicing
the violin as much as I should,"
he conceded.
Yet LaMottwill never experi
ence a real conflict between
the two activities.
"At football practice, I'm
physically working hard, I'm
tense throughout, and gener
ally kind of hyper," he said.
"Then I come to my room and
play the violin. It's a good way
to finish off the day."
Occasionally, Atkins added,
music blends with football.
"Sometimes when I'm working
hard on the field, I think of a
concerto or another piece of
music building up to a climax.
Then the climax comes when. I
score a touchdown."
LaMott Atkins knows the
rage of the football field and
the peace of the music room
and revels in both.
The talents of Stanford freshman
LaMott Atkins spread from American
gridirons to European concert halls.
As a halfback who gained 1054 yards
last year at Lake Washington High in
Kirkland, Wash., Atkins comes to the
Farm as one of coach Bill Walsh's top
rushing prospects for the future.
However, Atkins has already known
huge success as a concert violinist.
LaMott was also a member of the Na
tional Youth Choir which toured
Europe in the summer of 1976 and per
formed at Carnegie Hall on the nation's
Bicentennial.
In both his athletic and musical en
deavors, Atkins continues to practice
and learn.
Atkins began playing the violin in the
fourth grade. Then, says LaMott, "I was
at the age where you'll do something if

people just ask you to," Atkins said.
"So one day some of my teachers said,
'You'd make a good violinist. . . .' "
Atkins' parents always encouraged
him in music, though they chose to ig
nore their son's initial scrapings, re
legating LaMott to the bathroom
whenever he practiced.
LaMott had the advantage of living
near Seattle, the cultural center of the
Northwest. As his violin playing im
proved, Atkins discovered the benefits
that the Seattle area had to offer for
youngsters inclined towards the arts.
"There were all kinds of groups you
could get into," he said. "Youth sym
phony, orchestras, an all-state sym
phony, and church organizations."
The fact that Atkins was an ac
complished musician and a fine foot
ball player made him a special figure.

Freshman LaMott Atkins relaxes after practice by playing his violin. The gifted
musician also plays the viola and piano, dabbles with the cello and guitar, and
performs as often in the concert hall as on the football field.
"People always said of me,
'What a unique person' that
sort of thing," LaMott said
modestly.
He also plays the viola and
piano, and dabbles with the
cello and guitar. He enjoys all
kinds of music, but prefers
playing classical on the violin
and pop and jazz on the piano.
An average practice session
for LaMott lasts about an hour,
though he often plays for two
or even three hours.
Joy, he said, is the reason
why he plays. "It makes me
happy. When I'm down and
out, I play music to feel good.'
Other people smoke to relax; I
have the violin."
Public performances remain
troublesome for Atkins,
though he knows the basis for
this problem. "With my ex
perience, I shouldn't be nerv
ous. It's just a case of concen
trating more on what I'm do
ing."
One such performance,

however, produced laughs
rather than anxiety for the
Cards' music man. One year in
high school, the guys bet the
girls that they couldn't come to
school for a day without
makeup.
The girls lost, and had to take
the guys out to dinner. Atkins
helped make this a memorable
occasion by dressing in a
tuxedo and serenading
everyone.
LaMott is glad to be in the
