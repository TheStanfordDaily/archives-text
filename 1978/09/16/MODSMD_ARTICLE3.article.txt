# Gridders ply talents in fine arts
## Card back knows all the strings

The talents of Stanford freshman
LaMott Atkins spread from American
gridirons to European concert halls.
As a halfback who gained 1054 yards
last year at Lake Washington High in
Kirkland, Wash., Atkins comes to the
Farm as one of coach Bill Walsh's top
rushing prospects for the future.
However, Atkins has already known
huge success as a concert violinist.
LaMott was also a member of the Na
tional Youth Choir which toured
Europe in the summer of 1976 and per
formed at Carnegie Hall on the nation's
Bicentennial.
In both his athletic and musical en
deavors, Atkins continues to practice
and learn.
Atkins began playing the violin in the
fourth grade. Then, says LaMott, "I was
at the age where you'll do something if

people just ask you to," Atkins said.
"So one day some of my teachers said,
'You'd make a good violinist. . . .' "
Atkins' parents always encouraged
him in music, though they chose to ig
nore their son's initial scrapings, re
legating LaMott to the bathroom
whenever he practiced.
LaMott had the advantage of living
near Seattle, the cultural center of the
Northwest. As his violin playing im
proved, Atkins discovered the benefits
that the Seattle area had to offer for
youngsters inclined towards the arts.
"There were all kinds of groups you
could get into," he said. "Youth sym
phony, orchestras, an all-state sym
phony, and church organizations."
The fact that Atkins was an ac
complished musician and a fine foot
ball player made him a special figure.

Freshman LaMott Atkins relaxes after practice by playing his violin. The gifted
musician also plays the viola and piano, dabbles with the cello and guitar, and
performs as often in the concert hall as on the football field.
