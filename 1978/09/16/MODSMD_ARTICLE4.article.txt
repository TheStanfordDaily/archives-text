# Thespian Anderson fills the bill

I'll take my leave,
And leave you to the hearing of the
cause,
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip
them all.
-Measure for Measure
A cheerleading chant from Shakes
peare? Not likely. There really is no
documented proof that the Bard was
ever a football fan. But there is a foot
ball player who definitely is a long-time
fan of Shakespeare.
Billy Anderson, running back and
kick return specialist for Stanford, be
came interested in Shakespearean act
ing about the same time he became in
volved with football.
As a sophomore in high school, An
derson had just begun to develop his
talent for football. At the same time, as
a result of an intensive study of Shakes

peare's works and the theories behind
them, he decided to develop his talent
for Shakespearean drama.
An unusual combination of interests,
Anderson noted that these two areas of
activity are not without their
similarities. "In order to play a part (or
position)," he said, "you have to be in
total control of yourself. You have to
know your limitations. You have to
know what direction you are going to
take."
Anderson's credits include As You
Like It and the lead role in Richard 11.
Both were performed while still in high
school. During that time he was also a
member of the Berkeley Shakespeare
Company.
Anderson's involvement with non-
Shakespearean acting spans quite a few
years. As an early teen he was part of

Like It.
the American Conservatory Theatre
Youth Program. More recently, he was
part of the cast of Blue Beard, presented
at Stanford a few springs ago.
Anderson's enthusiasm for the
medium is apparent by the way he
speaks about it. "It's a creative outlet,"
he said, "and I think it's the best crea
tive outlet there is from a personal
standpoint. It allows you to direct your
energies in a direction that gives you a
greater understanding and control of
yourself."
Being both an actor and football
player simultaneously is not without its
problems. Anderson mentioned that
there just doesn't seem to be enough
time for both. He also spoke of the reac
tion he gets from his peers. "It gener
ally surprises a lot of people," he said.

"When I was in high school it was really
a big joke. Football players would laugh
at me for being an actor, and the actors
would shut me off as being a jock."
Anderson did, however, note that
the attitude among his current team
mates is much better.
Regarding the future, Anderson, who
is a senior, plans to go into motion pic
ture production. He has already made
some short films and, ultimately, would
like tb become a director.
At present, Anderson is concentrat
ing on football. He is the Cardinals'
third running back, playing behind
Darrin Nelson and Phil Francis. At
5-foot-9 and 180 pounds, he has the
speed and strength to play both
halfback and fullback.
Anderson doesn't mind being the

No. 3 running back and would probably
agree with Shakespeare who said, "A
substitute shines brightly as a king."
Putting it i n his own words, Anderson
said, "I think I can play a major role this
year. In order to have successful run
ning backs, you just can't run two run
ning backs into the ground."
Due to "the slings and arrows of out
rageous fortune," Anderson will be
sidelined this Saturday with an injured
ankle. He predicts he will be back in
action for the Cardinals' game against
Illinois on Sept. 23, but for now he will
be:
Like one that stands upon a promintory,
And spies a far-off shore where he
would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his
eye.

Due to "the slings and arrows of out
rageous fortune," Anderson will be
sidelined this Saturday with an injured
ankle. He predicts he will be back in

Like one that stands upon a promintory,
And spies a far-off shore where he
would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his
eye.
-Henry VI
