Rugby may be the main ath
letic diversion in Western
Samoa, but for California
transplanted Frank Man
umaleuna, football holds at
least an equal attraction.
The 6-foot-3, 245-pound
linebacker is currently leading
the defense at San Jose State,
but his beginnings hardly
prophesized what Man
umaleuna would be doing by
the time he was 22. A hut in
Western Samoa served as
maternity ward for the Spar
tan; an aunt played obstetri
cian. Three years later, when
Samoa received statehood,
Manumaleuna received his
birth certificate.
Last year he received certifi
cates for all sorts of things:
first-team All-PCAA, second
team, All-Coast, SJS defensive
player of the year, among
others. But the Spartans aren't
the only team to have benefit
ted from the athletic
capabilities of the "Mowin'
Samoan."
At Banning High in Wil
mington, Manumaleuna lit up
not only the gridiron, but the
basketball court, baseball
diamond and track as well. No

position was beyond his grasp
three cage positions, left
field and shot put-long jump
were all mastered by the
talented senior. So Michigan,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and USC
each rolled out the red carpet,
but nevertheless, Man
umaleuna became a UCLA
Bruin.
Even in college, the four
sport athlete refused to reduce
his participation to a singular
event, and played on the
freshman basketball team as
well as on the Bruin gridiron.
A neck injury cut his UCLA
career short, though, and he
was advised to never play
again.
"But I liked the game," said
Manumaleuna, "so I went to
DeAnza Junior College. My in
jury doesn't bother me now
I'm alive and well." At De Anza
the versatile athlete played
fullback averaging an amazing
15 yards per carry.
The inspiration for the man
who was voted outstanding de
fensive player for the Spartans
in 1977 to transfer up north was
provided by a close family
friend. Lynn Stiles, the SJSU

who played on the Bruin football and basketball teams his freshman year. An injury shortened the
linebacker's stint at UCLA, though. After some thought and a year at De Anza junior College, the defensive
standout decided to play at SJSU.
