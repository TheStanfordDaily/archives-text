# Manumaleuna's mission is on the field
## Mowin' Samoan stars at SJSU

Rugby may be the main ath
letic diversion in Western
Samoa, but for California
transplanted Frank Man
umaleuna, football holds at
least an equal attraction.
The 6-foot-3, 245-pound
linebacker is currently leading
the defense at San Jose State,
but his beginnings hardly
prophesized what Man
umaleuna would be doing by
the time he was 22. A hut in
Western Samoa served as
maternity ward for the Spar
tan; an aunt played obstetri
cian. Three years later, when
Samoa received statehood,
Manumaleuna received his
birth certificate.
Last year he received certifi
cates for all sorts of things:
first-team All-PCAA, second
team, All-Coast, SJS defensive
player of the year, among
others. But the Spartans aren't
the only team to have benefit
ted from the athletic
capabilities of the "Mowin'
Samoan."
At Banning High in Wil
mington, Manumaleuna lit up
not only the gridiron, but the
basketball court, baseball
diamond and track as well. No

position was beyond his grasp
three cage positions, left
field and shot put-long jump
were all mastered by the
talented senior. So Michigan,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and USC
each rolled out the red carpet,
but nevertheless, Man
umaleuna became a UCLA
Bruin.
Even in college, the four
sport athlete refused to reduce
his participation to a singular
event, and played on the
freshman basketball team as
well as on the Bruin gridiron.
A neck injury cut his UCLA
career short, though, and he
was advised to never play
again.
"But I liked the game," said
Manumaleuna, "so I went to
DeAnza Junior College. My in
jury doesn't bother me now
I'm alive and well." At De Anza
the versatile athlete played
fullback averaging an amazing
15 yards per carry.
The inspiration for the man
who was voted outstanding de
fensive player for the Spartans
in 1977 to transfer up north was
provided by a close family
friend. Lynn Stiles, the SJSU
head football coach contacted

who played on the Bruin football and basketball teams his freshman year. An injury shortened the
linebacker's stint at UCLA, though. After some thought and a year at De Anza junior College, the defensive
standout decided to play at SJSU.
Manumaleuna and urged him
to attend De Anza, then trans
fer to San Jose State if he plan
ned to play ball again. Wisely
enough, Manumaleuna took
his advice and has emerged as
one of the premier linebackers
in the nation. He's aware of the
elements that combine to
make a good linebacker and he
uses the recipe himself.
"Aggressiveness and alert
ness are important," he said.
"A linebacker must be mental,
he must know his assignment
and be aware of the offensive
players."
Manumaleuna has some ad
vantages to playing that posi
tion. "I'm heavier than most of
the guys," he said modestly.
"My speed is alright I sup
pose it's average."
But the points the radio-TV
major cited as his weaknesses
would hardly be considered as
such by most collegiate
players. "I was cut from the of
fensive line," said the defen
sive standout. "I need to de
velop my weight-strength
more. But I don't really like of
fense," he added. "There's too
much running."
Manumaleuna is still incred
ibly close to his family though
two brothers are on missions
for the Mormon church in dif
ferent areas of the nation, and
his parents and another
brother live in Southern
California. He attributed his
close ties to maintaining the
Samoan way of life, even while
residing in the United States.
"I don't remembertoo much
of Samoa other than what I've
heard from my parents," said
Manumaleuna, who left when
he was still a young child. "The

customs, traditions and
families are strong. We spoke
Samoan when we came home
from school and were taught to
accept a lot of responsibility.
Plus, my older brother is a
juvenile counselor in Carson
and we have Samoans staying
with us all the time."
The Mormon religion is
another important aspect of his
life and, though he won't be
going on a traditional mission
for the church, he has some
original ideas for helping
others.
"Ideally, I'd like to help
needy people with the benefits
and achievements from my ath
letic ability," he said. "That
seems to be my mission in life.
My folks said if I like what I'm
doing, I should keep it up and
keep striving for what's
beyond."
Probably what's beyond for
Manumaleuna is a permanent
return to Western Samoa. He
visits often they have a
house in a back village of the
islands but the "paradise" is
not necessarily for everyone.
"The Samoan traditions be
nefit the elderly," he said.
"Most of the younger genera
tion come to the states, though
in the end, everybody re
turns."
The fundamental reason the
sensitive athlete would like to
return to football as a profes
sional after graduation is to
"get a financial base, I'd like to
establish my career and help
my folks and my family."
Undeniably, Manumaleuna
has already established himself
at SJSU. He's made the choice
to return to the game and, with
his Samoan sense of responsi
bility, is doing an excellent job.
