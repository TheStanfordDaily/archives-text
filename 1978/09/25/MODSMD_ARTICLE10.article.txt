Welcome back home to Stanford!
To the 3000 of you who are new to
campus, enjoy your new experience
in earnest.
All of us on the Daily staff are hop
ing to bring you an exciting and in
vigorating newspaper this academic
year, and we hope you can help us in
this endeavor.
By keeping us informed of campus
events, or by actually joining our staff,
the Daily will become a better product
for the whole Stanford community.
During this week, the Daily has
scheduled seven open houses to be
used as a vehicle of meeting potential
new staff members. However,
everyone is welcome to attend to
learn more about the inside opera
tions of the Daily. Staff editors Mike
Charlson and John Nielsen are hoping
all freshmen and transfers make a
special point of attending. More in
formation about these open houses
can be found on page 5.
The staff is hard working, young and
bright and is very willing to always be
of service to you. They will answer all
Daily policy questions you might
have. We believe our policy to be
reasonable, well-thought out, and
when asked, we will be happy to ex
plain it to you.
Never be afraid to call us to task if

something printed is inaccurate. In
tentional mistakes will obviously be
avoided, but please remember, the
Daily is a student newspaper. We are
continuously training new people,
and like any student newspaper, we
do have a high staff turnover.
Please forgive us for the few mis
takes we are inevitably going to make,
and the Daily will make every attempt
to correct inaccuracies that warrant
clarification.
The Daily is not an advocacy news
paper, and never expect us to be. The
Daily will approach the stage of advo
cacy only in articles dealing with obvi
ous wrongdoing.
However, advocacy will always be
allowed on this page, the opinions
section of your morning Daily. I
strongly encourage everyone in the
Stanford community to contribute to
this section.
One* closing comment. We at the
Daily are always here to help you.
Please make use of this opportunity.
The only way the Daily will be a great
newspaper is by you keeping us in
formed. Give us a call at 497-4632 or
stop by at any of our seven open
houses this week. Our door is always
open to you, the Stanford community.
