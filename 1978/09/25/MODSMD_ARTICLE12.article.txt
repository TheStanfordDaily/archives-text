## Foreign students face problems 
### 
Each year a large number of new foreign
students descends upon virtually every
college and university in the U.S. Apart
from the obvious and necessary adjust
ments and the "cultural shock," the
foreign student has a priori certain
peculiarities that distinguish him/her from
the rest of the student body. This article
will attempt to deal with some of them. In
this effort a certain amoung of generaliza
tion is unavoidable. The author begs the
forgiveness of his reader both on this as
pect and also on the fact that many of the
thoughts that follow are prima face true;
yet they are frequently ignored.
Foreign students in general have a much
more limited scope of study and career
objectives; and rightly so. To understand
this, one must examine their background.
Most of them come from societies where
to attend college is an accomplishment of
major proportions; to do so in the U.S.
constitutes an even rarer feat. Therefore
foreign students in this country are either
very wealthy or very bright. They are rep
resentatives of a much more select group
than the average American student.
The term "developing countries," one
that encompasses almost every country
outside Europeand North America, means
exactly that. These countries require a
large number of technocrats. It is not then
surprising that almost 90 percent of

foreign students are either in engineering
or in the sciences. In a large number of
countries, to be an engineer is probably
the most prestigious and financially re
warding job. Many view the U.S., with
its highly advanced scientific enterprise,
as the Mecca of their ambitions.
The foreign student who succeeds in the
almost "impossible," normally comes
here unprepared. The characteristics of
the American academic system ellude
him. He is, more importantly, alien to his
future profession. Few foreign students
embark on a U.S. academic career with
any clear cut objectives. They know only
that they generally want to be engineers.
What sort of an engineer they do not
know. Their background does not provide
enough information.
In the 1940s and '50s when the U.S. was
in the midst of a technological boom and
when the "brain drain" was a very real
phenomenon, a majority of foreign stu
dents stayed here upon graduation. That
demand has, of course, tapered off, and
although some foreign graduates still re
main, it is becoming more difficult to do
so. In some fields it is virtually impossible
since there is an oversupply of American
graduates. This fact cannot be ignored by
foreign students. "Labor certificates" are
rapidly becoming an item of the past.
The conditions and needs of their coun

try's technological establishment have to
be .jken into account. This is one item in
which many foreign students fail. Drawn
many times by reputation, they will try
very hard to enter one of the prestigious
universities in the U.S. However, many
department "ratings" are based on things
such as publications and number of Ph.D.
and M.S. produced. These same depart
ments may also be quite indifferent not
only to a foreign student's future pros
pects but also to the American realities.
The fact that an engineering department at
Stanford is rated "number one" in the
country it does not make it a good place
for a foreign student to attend. It may very
well be one of the worst.
Foreign students should weigh all fac
tors before accepting a project for
graduate work (if he is given the choice). If
they are unsuccessful they have the option
to transfer to another department or
another university. The law allows such
transfers after the completion of a term in
the institution that appears on their visa.
The thrust of this article was to make
clear some points that may not be too ob
vious to a newly arrived foreign stvdent.
The purpose is to optimize the student's
stay in the U.S. and to help avoid future
disappointments.
