## Proposition 5 unjustified 
### 
In recent weeks, the media has been
filled with advertisements condemning
Proposition 5, and justifiably so. This
proposal to ban smoking in public places
unless separate areas are provided for
smokers and non-smokers is a clear viola
tion of equal rights. Furthermore, it
threatens to divert more taxpayer dollars
away from useful services and into what
would ultimately prove to be an absurd
and wasteful endeavor.
Supporters of Proposition 5 maintain
that smoking is hazardous to bystanders as
well as those who indulge in the habit
themselves. They argue that while smok
ing is an individual freedom, it ought not
be allowed in public areas where it
threatens the right of others to breathe
clean air. If one accepts this reasoning,
then driving motor vehicles should also be
banned. Here is an activity which, like
smoking, is indulged in by a fraction of the
population and is clearly hazardous to the
health of society as a whole. The extent to
which cigarette, cigar and and pipe smoke
contribute to our overall air pollution
problem is bound to be infinitesimal.
In addition, Proposition 5 is a clear re
flection of the inappropriate attitude

which non-smokers have toward smokers.
Modern medicine has long made public
the evidence that smoking is a predispos
ing factor in the development of lung and
throat cancer, emphysema, and other re
spiratory ailments. Few smokers would at
tempt to deny these facts, and most would
probably quit immediately if such action
were not so difficult. Hence, the chronic
smoker ought to be looked upon as an
individual with a handicap; that is, we
should sympathize with rather than os
tracize he or she who finds it necessary to
light up habitually. Proposition 5 does no
thing but create animosity between
people who do not happen to share the
same vice.
Mention should also be made of the
chaos which would result from the re
quirement tha« private enterprises create
separate areas for smokers and non
smokers. For a shopowner to do this vol
untarily in order to satisfy his non-smoking
clientele is one thing; to make such action
mandatory is quite another. Here is a sec
ond aspect of Proposition 5 which
threatens the rights of individual citizens,
in this case the opportunity to establish
and operate a business to one's liking.
Despite the fact that I am a non-smoker

with a deep concern for preventive
medicine, I find it impossible to support
Proposition 5. It simply does nothing to
help decrease the incidence of smoking in
America; if passed, few individuals are
likely to kick the habit. The money which
this proposal hopes to utilize for NO
SMOKING signs and remodeling of public
places could be used to far greater advan
tage. For example, most smokers get
started during the peer pressure years
when they do not realize its hazards; sev
eral pack-years and coughs later, they are
forced to struggle against an ingrained
habit. A better approach would be to fund
anti-smoking campaigns aimed at young
people in school, so as to insure fewer
adult smokers in the future.
In closing, I must agree that it is some
times annoying to find oneself on a bus or
in a restaurant seated near an individual
who happens to be smoking excessively.
However, this alone should not be
grounds to hold a grudge against the per
son. As a society, we must strive to over
look small differences in our mannerisms
rather than emphasize them to the point of
creating animosity.
