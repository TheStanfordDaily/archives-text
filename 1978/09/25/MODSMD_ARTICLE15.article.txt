## A 						guideline for freshmen 
### 
What every freshman
should know:
That the most precious
commodity here is time. We
worry — though not
enough — about not wast
ing water and gas and elec
tricity. Howaboutourtime?
That Wilbur Hall never
has been a military barracks
or a prison.
That professors and TA's
and administrators and
Trustees and advisors are
just like freshmen; they
have strengths and weak
nesses and likes and dislikes
and good days and bad
days. That they are worth
knowing, and above all that
it takes effort to do that.
That his or her life will be
the richer for:
—taking a few minutes once
a month to visit an unfamil
iar building or a place on
campus (how many people
graduate from here without
ever seeing SLAC?)

—reading about the history
of this place and con
templating what the Stan
fords have wrought and
how it stacks up with their
vision.
That there are many ways
to express individuality, not
all of which are inexorably
flamboyant.
That the things most
people lose most easily at
Stanford is the ability to
laugh at themselves.
That the Daily really
should be read before being
adapted to other more
mundane uses.
That to cast others,
whether individuals or
groups, in unwarranted im
ages is dehumanizing.
That a couple of old
platitudes are particularly
appropirate on the Farm:
You only get out of it what
you put into it. You are your
own worst enemy.
That the ability to com

mu nicate well with others of
all ages, in all lands, and in
every language, by the spo
ken or written word, pre
sumes a system in which
both parties acknowledge a
common, proper place
ment of words and a mutu
ally understood meaning.
That Stanford has its own
peculiar laws of nature:
—Everyone in your dorm
will be done with finals be
fore you are.
—All the classes you want
are taught at the same hour.
—The more midterms you
have, the more likely they
will be given in the same
week. (Newton's Corollary:
if you have more than three
midterms, they will all be
given on Monday after a
long weekend.)
—Everyone has more smarts
than you.
