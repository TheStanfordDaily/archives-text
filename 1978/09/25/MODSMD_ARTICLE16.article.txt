## Rent relief means tax equity for all renters 
### 
During July a group of Palo Alto citi
zens used the initiative process to qual
ify a rent relief ordinance for the
November 7 ballot.
The proposed ordinance, Measure H
on the Palo Alto ballot, would give each
tenant his or her pro-rated share of the
landlord's property tax savings from
Proposition 13, which was enacted dur
ing the June 6 election in California.
Stanford students who live in Palo
Alto can effect the results of the elec
tion if they remember to register to vote
at their current address by October 9.
Prepaid post card registration forms are
available at any Post Office and at the
City Clerk's office on the seventh floor
of the Palo Alto Civic Center, 250 Hamil
ton Avenue.
Why Rent Relief?
Over the past several years, rents in
Palo Alto have climbed dramatically. An
important component of that increase
has been higher property taxes. Land
lords use rents to pay their property
taxes.
The passage of Proposition 13 has
greatly reduced the landlords' property
tax obligations, but only a few landlords
have promised to pass on the full sav
ings.
Many owners have said that they may
pass on some savings, and many more

have said nothing. Some landlords
have even announced large rent in
creases since the passage of Proposi
tion 13. Nevertheless, tenants suffer
the same service cutbacks, and may
eventually pay the same high alternate
taxes, as other residents.
For this reason, Citizens for Rent Re
lief designed an ordinance to pass on

the Proposition 13 tax savings to tenants
for 1979.
How Large Will Reductions Be?
Beginning January 1979, for 12
months, tenants will pay reduced rents,
assuming that the renters' relief ordi
nance is passed in November and that
the courts uphold Jarvis-Gann tax sav

ings.
Each tenant's montly rent for 1979 will
be approximately 10 percent less than
the June, 1978 rent for the same apart
ment or house, because each tenant
will receive his or her pro-rated share of
the landlord's property tax savings.
Although the landlord is responsible
for calculating the rebate, he or she will

be required to disclose rent and tax in
formation to all tenants, so that the ten
ants can verify the landlord's calcula
tions.
Can Rents Be Increased?
During the 12 months of reductions,
landlords may raise rents for three
reasons: (1) increased operating costs;

(2) capital improvements; and (3) hard
ship. In all three cases, landlords will be
required to provide tenants with justify
ing documents and receipts.
To show hardship, landlords must
show that they are not making a
reasonable rate of return, including net
income, tax benefits and property ap
preciation.
While most property owners will
comply with the ordinance, Measure H
does authorize tenants to go to court
and/or to withhold a portion of their
rent without threat of eviction. In addi
tion, property owners refusing to
cooperate with the ordinance will be
committing a misdemeanor.
To avoid the establishment of a new
administrative bureaucracy, the courts
will be responsible for enforcing the
ordinance.
Tax Equity For Renters
Homeowners are receiving the be
nefits of Proposition 13 tax reductions.
Tax equity requires that renters receive
the same benefits, because their rents
are used to pay landlords' property
taxes.
Measure H means tax equity for
renters. Vote FOR Measure H.
