# You know where to turn for the news... Help the Daily bring it to you!

### 
Each of us has a special reason for making
Stanford his or her home for four years. For
some, it is the hope of becoming "a member
of the family of educated men and women,"
as one eastern school puts it. For others, it is
the promise of financial success. Still others
choose Stanford because "Dad (or Mom)
went here," or because it's near the romance
and verve of San Francisco.
Students who join the staff of the Stanford
Daily also have a variety of reasons and
ambitions. A school newspaper may be the
most familiar-looking place on campus for a
freshman who worked on his high school
paper. For those interested in journalism or
writing as a career, the Daily is, as a professor
in the Communications Department has said,
"the most realistic communications lab
around." Daily alumni have gone on to work
with such newsgathering organizations as
The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles
Times, The Washington Post, The Boston
Globe, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and
various wire services, to name just a few.
After a few days on the staff, the friendship
and cameraderie of Storke Publications
Building can become important reasons to

work for the Daily. There is something
uniquely rewarding about working with other
people in a collective enterprise, especially
one which is published five days a week. The
lure of the Daily as a place to hang out in your
spare time is contageous.
Finally, for those who commit a little time to
the Daily and are willing to learn some of the
tricks of the trade, becoming an editor will
mean helping to make decisions for the
independent Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, an organization whose annual
budget exceeds $300,000.
In addition, as a former editor put it,
working for the Daily can give a student "a
feeling that he knows what's happening here
and (that he) can influence events." As much
as students and staff may criticize the Daily,
they listen.
