# Not considered 'remedial'
## Learning Assistance Center teaches skills 
### BOB RUDY 
The stereotypical Stanford student is a bright and
intelligent student. But according to Carrie Walker of
the Learning Assistance Center (LAC), that "typical"
student is not necessarily an efficient one.
"An awful lot of students," Walker said, "come
here having been so good in high school that they
never learned or needed to learn to budget their time
or study effectively."
One of the goals of LAC is to help solve that prob
lem. The center, created in 1972, offers accredited
courses in five areas of study; writing, learning skills,
tutoring, reading improvement afid peer counseling.
LAC's primary goal is to make people more effec
tive learners, Walker said.
The center is "not just for students with academic
trouble," she added. Responding to a 1975 Time

magazine article that called LAC "a remedial program
for the bright," Walker said she believes the word
"remedial" is a misnomer.
"Students here are not attracted to something
which is considered remedial."
Approximately 1000 students took LAC courses last
year, according to Walker. She reported that
freshmen represented a substantial portion of that
total. About 10 percent were graduate students.
The most popular class on the LAC list, Walker said,
was "Rapid Reading Improvement." Most students in
this course doubled their reading speed. Another
class with high enrollment was the "Effective Learn
ing Skills" course which covers such topics as time
management, note taking, research and writing
techniques, and memory and concentration.
Patrick Von Bargen, a LAC instructor, used writing

skills as an example to emphasize the advantages of
LAC courses. "Rather than teaching writing in con
junction with a literature course,'' he said, "we ad
dress skills very specifically and talk about those skills
so they can be used in any number of courses later
on."
In addition to their classes, LAC offers free indi
vidual or small group academic tutoring for under
graduate courses. The tutors are undergraduates
who are enrolled in the Center's "Tutoring
Techniques and Practicum" course, LAC also pro
vides free consultations with trained peer counselors
about a variety of academic skills.
Registration for LAC courses will take place Mon
day and Tuesday in Maples Pavilion. Students want
ing further information can contact the Center's of
fice in Meyer Undergraduate Library.

Despite the maps and instructions placed on campus to help guide
lost students, it's no wonder people get confused when the University
posts directional signs like this one found near the history depart
ment.
