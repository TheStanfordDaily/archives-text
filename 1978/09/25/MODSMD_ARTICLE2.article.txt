# Search law signed by Brown
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law
Saturday a bill that will outlaw police
searches of newsrooms in California.
The measure, AB 512, is a response
to the decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court in May of this year in the case
involving a 1971 search of the offices
of The Stanford Daily by Palo Alto
police. In the ruling, the justices re
fused to extend the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment to include a pro
hibition of searches of parties not in
volved in a crime and said that free
dom of the press would not be cur
tailed by the possibility of unan
nounced searches of newsrooms.
The justices did leave room for
legislative remedies for such
searches at both the state and federal
level. The California bill will prohibit
newsroom searches, but allows law
enforcement agencies to subpoena
unpublished film, documents and
other materials. The validity of sub
poenas can, however, be challenged
in court and authorities can be
forced to specify clearly what infor
mation is being sought and to de
monstrate its relevance to a criminal
investigation.
Brown said, "ASupreme Court de
cision in effect opened the door to
police searches. Now that door is
closed by other branches of govern
ment."
Brown also said the measure will
counter "the chilling effect" on con
fidential sources that unannounced
searches could create.
The current editor of The Daily,
Craig Dennis, said in a letter to
Brown, "(W)e feel your action par
tially vindicates our efforts to pro
hibit future surprise searches, such
as the one that occurred in our of
fices in 1971.
"Since the U.S. Supreme Court
failed to uphold our belief that third
party searches are unconstitutional,
statutory law was the next logical

step," the letter said.
Similar legislation has been intro
duced in the U.S. House of Rep
resentatives, and its Committee on
Government Operations has issued a
report that favors some type of legis
lation to limit third party searches,
including newsroom searches.
It appears that this is the first state
law that specifically outlaws searches
of newspapers and television and
radio stations. The bill will go into
effect )an. 1.
