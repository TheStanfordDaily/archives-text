# Search law signed by Brown

### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law
Saturday a bill that will outlaw police
searches of newsrooms in California.
The measure, AB 512, is a response
to the decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court in May of this year in the case
involving a 1971 search of the offices
of The Stanford Daily by Palo Alto
police. In the ruling, the justices re
fused to extend the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment to include a pro
hibition of searches of parties not in
volved in a crime and said that free
dom of the press would not be cur
tailed by the possibility of unan
nounced searches of newsrooms.
The justices did leave room for
legislative remedies for such
searches at both the state and federal
level. The California bill will prohibit
newsroom searches, but allows law
enforcement agencies to subpoena
unpublished film, documents and
other materials. The validity of sub
poenas can, however, be challenged
in court and authorities can be
forced to specify clearly what infor
mation is being sought and to de
monstrate its relevance to a criminal
investigation.
Brown said, "ASupreme Court de
cision in effect opened the door to
police searches. Now that door is
closed by other branches of govern
ment."
Brown also said the measure will
counter "the chilling effect" on con
fidential sources that unannounced
