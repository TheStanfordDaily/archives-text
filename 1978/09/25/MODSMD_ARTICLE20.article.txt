# Frontlash sponsors voter-reg drive
## 
### MONIKA GUTTMAN 
Voter registration tables will be set up in
Maples Pavilion and in White Plaza today and
tomorrow as part of an intense registration drive
by the non-partisan national organization
Frontlash.
"In the early part of a campaign, when you
have to register, no one knows about it," said
Eric Miethke, county coordinator for the youth/
voter registration group.
"Campaigns start cooking around the middle
of October, and by then it's too late," for the
Oct. 9 registration deadline, he said. "We're try
ing to offset this."
"Polls show that most students, if they are re
gistered, tend to be more aware and to vote,"
said Janet Rappaport, another student involved
in the Frontlash program. "It only takes two mi
nutes to fill out the registration card," she added.
Door-to-door
Frontlash has also organized the first ever
door-to-door registration drive here to be held

later this week. Two volunteers will cover each
dorm in an effort to reach those who missed the
Maples and White Plaza registration.
Past efforts at registering students here have
been carried out by the League of Women Vot
ers, but the campaigns were never as aggressive
as Miethke said he plans this one to be.
"Frontlash is trying to get participation from
the 18-to-24-year-olds, who are chronically un
represented," Miethke said.
Frontlash has established a goal of 2000 newly
registered members of the Stanford community
before the Oct. 9 registration deadline.
The Frontlash drive is supported by many dif
ferent political campaigns, from gubernatorial
candidates to national and state congressional
candidates. The ASSU also has backed and en
dorsed the effort.
According to Miethke, registering to vote in
this community in no way commits a voter to
permanent California voter status.
"Registration only means you consider Stan

ford your home for a period of time," he said.
"You can even change registration again after the
election."
Concern students
"But when you live some place for eight
months out of the year, then a lot of the mea
sures of the ballot affect you," he said. Miethke
cited Proposition 5 — the smoking initiative, and
Proposition 6 — the homosexual teaching initia
tive, as examples of measures which directly
concern students.
"The 26th Amendment gave the vote to 18-to
-24-year-olds, and this was supposed to 'swing the
vote' of the nation," said Rappaport. "But youth
turnout was surprisingly low."
Rappaport said she thought the feeling of
many people that one individual vote doesn't
have much influence is a very real concern.
"But if all of a sudden 100,000 people don't
vote because they feel they don't count, then
that's a big block," she said. "If your vote doesn't
count, then whose vote are they counting?"
