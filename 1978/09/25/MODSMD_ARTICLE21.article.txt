# DeLeeuw eighth campus murder
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Since 1933 there have been eight murders here includ
ing the most recent killing of Mathematics Prof. Karel
deLeeuw.
That number is about even with the national average
for a community of this size, according to Detective
Chuck Gillingham of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office.
Of the eight killings, four have yet to be solved. Those
four cases, which all occurred in 1973 and 1974, are still
open. The murder cases "never stop being worked on/'
said Gillingham, who is assigned to the case involving
the 1974 slaying of Arlis Perry, 19, the wife of an under
graduate here in Memorial Church.
The other unsolved cases are as follows:
— The body of Leslie Perlov, 21, who had graduated
from the University in 1972 was found strangled near
Foothill Expressway on Feb. 16, 1973.
— On Sept. 11, 1973, David Levine, a 20-year-old
physics undergraduate, was found stabbed to death in
back of Meyer Undergraduate Library.
— On March 25, 1974, janet Taylor was found strang
led about a mile from the spot where Perlov's body was

discovered. She apparently had been hitchhiking home
from campus when abducted.
The other murder cases are:
— On May 30, 1933 Arlene Lamson was found beaten
to death in the bathtub of her campus cottage.
— On Feb. 25, 1958 Deena Bonn, 17, of Palo Alto was
fatally shot on the Stanford campus. Her youthful slayer
surrendered.
— On Dec. 20, 1969 Dr. Leslie Kulhanek died of three
bullet wounds in the chest after he was shot at the
Stanford Medical Center. The gunman surrendered.
Cillingham said that he and his office still follow up
leads they are in the cases. Although some paral
lels have been drawn between the four slayings here and
the so-called Zebra murders that have taken place in the
Bay Area, no firm connection has been found, said Cil
lingham.
Although no suspects have been found in the cases,
this does not necessarily mean that the murders were of
the so-called "stranger" type, in which the victim and
the assailant have no connection, Cillingham explained.
Sometimes murderers confess many years after the act,
or connections and motives come to light only after a
long investigation.
