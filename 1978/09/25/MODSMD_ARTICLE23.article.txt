# Fighting Illini kayoed by Stanford punch
## Cards' miserly defense, potent attack knock fight out of Illini 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Champaign-Urbana, ill. —
Like a diesel tractor with a
22-man harrow, the Stanford
Cardinals plowed the Fighting
lllini under the Midwestern
flatland 35-10 Saturday before
43,143 people at Memorial
Stadium.
The Cardinals disked the ll
lini Astroturf for 439 yards, led
by the laser-straight passing of
Steve Dils and the rushing his
trionics of Darrin Nelson. The
stingy Stanford defense
yielded only 141 yards total of
fense, much of that coming in
the fourth quarter against Card
reserves.
The lllini band used an
l-formation to march down
Zuppke Field during its pre
game show and had better suc
cess with it than its blue-and
orange gridiron counterpart
did during 60 minutes of foot
ball.
Illinois gained 434 yards in its
37-24 loss to the Cards last sea
son, but faced a shored-up de
fense Saturday.
"Defensively, I think we're a
much better team than a year
ago," said Stanford coach Bill
Walsh, now 2-1 on the season.
"We have different personnel
with a freshman nose guard
(Doug Rogers) starting as well
as three sophomore linebac
kers.
"A year ago we had to ask
men back who had graduated
to play on our defensive line.
This year we have a group with
more athletic ability. It makes
us a better football team."
The lllini, held scoreless in
their previous two games this
season and limited to one
touchdown in their last five
outings, erased the zero from
their side of the scoreboard
with a 47-yard Dave Finzer field
goal early in the first period.
The three points not
withstanding, Stanford held
the struggling lllini to minus six
yards total offense in the first
quarter and just 47 yards in the
first half.
The ignomony of relinguish
ing the first points to the lllini
belonged to the Stanford of
fense. On the game's second
play from scrimmage, Dils shot
a pass through the out
stretched hands of Nelson into
the waiting hands of Illinois de
fensive back Derwin Tucker
who hit the artificial surface —
ball intact — at the Stanford 27.
It was Dils' eighth interception
of the season.
"I thought Dils played a real
poised game," Walsh said,
"other than his first pass,
which was forced and un

necessary. After that he
steadied up and played as he
had in the Oklahoma game and
the UCLA game of last year."
Dils completed 24 of 30 pas
ses on the afternoon for 240
yards, including 17 of 20 for 160
yards in the first half.
Befuddled by penalties in
the early going, Stanford grab
bed a 7-3 advantages with 15
seconds remaining in the first
quarter. The Cards began their
first scoring drive on the lllini
26 after Card linebacker Terry
Rennaker recovered an errant
punt snap to Finzer. Six plays
later, Nelson took a pitch from
Dils and followed a block by
fullback Phil Francis to reach

the end zone standing up.
In the second quarter Dils
dissected the lllini defense,
completing nine of 10 passes
for 113 yards. Mixing passes to
tight end Mitch Pleis and wide
receiver Gordon Banks with
runs by Nelson and Francis,
Dils moved the Cards to the ll
lini 14 early in the quarter. He
then found tight end Pat Bowe
open at the five-yard line on
the left side, and the 6-foot-7
junior bulled his way to his first
Stanford touchdown.
"The touchdown came on a
new play we just put in this
week — a sprint right Y sneak,"
Bowe said. "The whole offense
sprints right while I dive inside

and look like I'm blocking.
Then I come out late — rather
deceptively. It worked the way
it was supposed to and I just
had to get through one man to
get to the end zone.
With less than four minutes
left in the second period, the
Cards took over on their 12 and
Dils went to work again. Mov
ing to the lllini 38 where the
Cards faced fourth-and-one,
Dils called time out and talked
to Walsh. He came to the line,
faked a give to the right, then
bootlegged around left end for
five yards and the first down.
Sideline passes to Francis
and Nelson moved the ball to
the eight. With first and goal,

Stanford went into a three tight
end offense and Francis
squirted through left tackle,
stretching across the goal line
to give Stanford a 21-3 halftime
lead.
The Cards, ranked 15th in
the nation in scoring going into
the game, wasted no time get
ting on the scoreboard in the
second half. After sophomore
linebacker Milt McColl reco
vered his fourth fumble of the
season — this one on the Il
linois 23 — Dils needed just
five plays to direct the Cards to
paydirt, sending Francis over
right guard form one yard out.

opens up to reveal Stanford in possession. OU went on to win 35-29, but not before the Cardinals
made a show of talent uncharacteristic of the young, inexperienced team they were made out to
be.
