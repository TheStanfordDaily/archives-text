# Footballers split first contests
## Late rally scares Sooners 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
Oklahoma came to Stanford for the season opener Sept. 9
with 8000 fans and a No. 2 national ranking. They left with a
35-29 victory, but only after the Cards put on a brilliant offen
sive exhibition and almost upset the Sooners with eight sec
onds remaining in the game.
Steve Dils, the latest in a long line of outstanding Stanford
quarterbacks, led the nation in passing at the close of the first
game with 32 completions on 48 attempts for 299 yards. If Dils
had completed his 48th pass, the Cards would have had a
victory, but an interception in the end zone on the last play of
the game saved the Sooners from a loss.
Since that drizzly Saturday, neither team has looked back.
Oklahoma pulverized West Virginia 52-10 and Rice University
66-7. Stanford executed San Jose State 38-9 and Illinois 35-10.
Although Walsh often cites his team's inexperience, the
Cards played like veterans against the wishbone attack that
characterizes OU.
"Some of our players had never played in a game for us
before," Walsh said. "I think they played with poise through
out the game and executed quite well for inexperienced
people."
The majority of that superior execution came in the second
half of the game as the teams left the field at halftime with
Oklahoma in command 28-10, scoring two touchdowns in
each of the first two quarters. The first play of the game
foreshadowed a possible rout as Stanford's Gordon Banks
fumbled the opening kickoff. Jerry Saunders, an OU
freshman, recovered and after only 1:26, the Sooners had
seven points on the board. The Sooners had their share of
turnovers too, though, losing four of their eight fumbles and
having one pass pirated.
A 70-yard bomb from Oklahoma quarterback Thomas Lott to
split end Steve Rhodes gave the Sooners their second TD. The
Cardinal outlook midway through the first quarter was almost
as bleak as the weather endured by 66,000 fans, Stanford's
largest home-opening crowd ever.
It was hardly an endurance test, however, as Stanford came
back into the game with a seven-yard pass from Dils to split
end Ken Margerum and a 42-yard field goal by Card kicker Ken
Naber, making the score 14-10.
But the Sooners, who rushed for 375 yards on 67 carries,
shredded the Stanford defense for two more TDs before the
half.
Lott, Oklahoma's top rusher on last year's Orange Bowl
team gained 81 yards on 12 carries. He also completed 5 of 12
passes for 121 yards.
