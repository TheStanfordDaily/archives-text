Boring.
In a word, Stanford's 38-9 victory over hapless San Jose State
was boring. It may have been the least well played 29-point
victory in Stanford annals.
ABC-TV televised the game regionally for the benefit of
West Coast insomniacs. For the benefit of the 42,500 fans who
showed up to watch the soporific contest, the mid-September
sun was strong enough to provide some last-minute summer
color.
The one redeeming quality of the game was the play of the
Stanford defense. It played well. It had to. The Stanford of
fense suddenly became the Cards' greatest defensive liability.
With third and three from the Stanford 20 in the first quarter,
Cardinal quarterback Steve Dils fired a swing pass to fullback
Phil Francis on the right flat. Spartan cornerback Steve Hines
stepped in front of Francis to grab the pass and continued
running untouched into the Stanford end zone.
It was the first of five turnovers for the Cards. The Spartans,
however, in a pique of one-upmanship, or in this case, five
upmanship, made a hell-bent effort to break the PCAA tur
nover record with 10 — five fumbles and five interceptions. It
was a 22-man greased pig catching contest with no winner.
With the Cards down 6-0 after San Jose muffed the PAT,
Darrin Nelson returned a 52-yard line drive punt for 74 yards
before being hauled down by Cully Williamson on the San
Jose 7-yard line. Two plays later Dils found tight end Mitch
Pleis on the right side of the end zone.
Early in the second quarter the Cards moved to the San Jose
5 before Dils was thrown for a six-yard loss attempting to pass,
giving Stanford fourth-and-goal from the 11. Ken Naber came
in to kick a field goal but Dils took the snap, sprung to his feet
and slung a pass to running back Jim Brown. The ever-present
Mr. Hines pirated the pass and raced 70 yards before Naber
stopped him from scoring his second touchdown. Hines was a
unanimous pressbox choice as the San Jose State offensive
player of the game.
San Jose stalled and had to settle for a 39-yard field goal.
Stanford took the ensuing Spartan kickoff and drove 68 yards
in 10 plays with Dils finding Nelson completely alone in the
middle of the end zone with a 4-yard TD toss.
Continuing with the inept motif of the afternoon, Naber,
who missed only three PATs all last season, missed the first of
three errant PATs. Walsh absolved Naber of responsibility
after the contest, however, saying that the kicking mistakes
resulted from poor snaps and placements.
The magnanimous Spartans, outdoing themselves to be
even more charitable than the host Cardinals, threw a pass to
Stanford cornerback Rick Parker which gave the Cards the ball
on the San )ose 36. Seven plays later Dils pitched to Nelson
who took the ball around left and across the goal line to give
the Cards a 20-9 halftime advantage.
The two teams doubled their efforts in the second half and
managed 10 turnovers between them. The Cardinal offense,
however, contained Hines in the second half as the offense
shut out the Spartans.
When the crowd awoke from its stupor as the Band took the
track for its postgame show, the new scoreboard told them
Stanford had won, 38-9.
It's a good thing the scoreboard had stayed awake to record
the final tally for gridiron posterity. Not everyone else man
aged to keep their eyes open.
