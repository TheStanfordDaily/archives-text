## Poloists retain No. 1 form 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
Despite the absence of of
fensive standout Robby Ar
nold, the Stanford water polo
team established itself as the
No. 1 team in the nation by de
feating all challengers in the
UC-lrvine tournament over the
Sept. 15-17 weekend.
Saturday, the Cards followed
up their Irvine success with a
14-6 thrashing of San lose State
at deCuerre pool.
Arnold, the team's second
leading scorer last year, is
awaiting a decision on scholar
ship funds and did not play in
either the tournament or the
San lose State game.
In Irvine, Stanford won five
games and lost none, chalking
up victories against UCLA, Cal
Poly-Pomona, California, USC
and UC-lrvine.
The Cards breezed through
their first two games, drowning
the Bruins 8-1 and defeating
Pomona 10-2. Against rival Cal,
the Cards see-sawed with the
lead and were tied 5-5 with 30
seconds left in the game. Then,
two of Stanford's newest arri
vals won it for the Cards as
freshman Alan Mouchawar
scored off a pass from
classmate Chris Kelsey to net a
6-5 Stanford victory.
After Cal, the Cards defeated
USC by an identical 6-5 score,
then avenged their 1977 NCAA
semifinal defeat by edging the
Irvine Anteaters, 10-8.
Senior Tom Angelo, the
team's top scorer last year,
played in four of the five tour
nament games and scored 10
goals to pace the Cardinal at
tack. Other top Stanford scor
ers included Doug Burke with
seven goals, Kelsey with six
and junior Randy Kalbus with
five.
Against the Spartans Satur
day, Burke led a balanced Car
dinal offense with four goals
and an assist.
Stanford played a very
slow-paced first quarter and an
inspired San lose State team

battled the Cards to a 2-2 tie at
the end of the period. The
Cards, however, came out of
their trance in the second quar
ter and erupted for five goals
while holding the Spartans
scoreless.
"Our counterattack worked
well against them," Cardinal
coach Dante Dettamanti said,
"but human nature being what
it is, you have a tendency to
play down to the level of your

opponents. We played a very
lackadaisical game, especially
on defense. We have a very
good defense, but we didn't
show it out there today."
Looking towards the Pac-10
season, which the Cards open
Thursday against Arizona at
deCuerre, Stanford may be
fielding one of the most talent
laden teams in Cardinal his
tory. Should Arnold play, he
would be one of six starters re

turning from last year's team.
The seventh starting position
will be filled by freshman, Jody
Campbell, whom Dettamanti
regards as "the best hole-man
prospect Stanford has had
since (Rick) Massimino in the
late '605."
Sharing the hole duties with
Campbell will be senior Dave
Egan. All-America sophomore
)ohn Gansel will once again de
fend the Cardinal goal.
