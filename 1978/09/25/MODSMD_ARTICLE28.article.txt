# Stanford athletes excel over summer
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Whether churning through
the water in Berlin or hitting
groundstrokes in Burlingame,
Stanford athletes gave good
account of themselves this
summer.
Capping summer perfor
mances by Stanford athletes
were the gold-medal victories
of freshman Linda Jezek and
senior Mike Bruner at the
World Aquatic Games in West
Berlin.
Jezek established herself as
the top women's backstroker
in the world by capturing the
gold in the 100- and 200-meter
backstroke in Berlin, winning
the 200 in world-record time.
The 18-year-old freshman
from Santa Clara added a third
gold with a backstroke leg in
the 400-medley relay. Prior to
Germany, Jezek had set Ameri
can records while winning the
two backstroke races at the
AAU championships in Texas.
Bruner retained his crown as
the top 200-butterfly swimmer
in the world when he fell just
short of his own world record
while winning the gold in Ber
lin. Bruner, the '76 Olympic 200
fly champ, was coming off a
disappointing year of col
legiate swimming.
Waterpolo
Senior Robby Arnold, in
Germany since early last
winter, was also a big splash in
Berlin pools. The second
leading scorer on Stanford's
water polo team last season,
Arnold spent the last eight
months playing for the West
Berlin Water Polo Club.

Arnold's Stanford team
mates Chris Kelsey, Jody
Campbell, Randy Kalbus and
Vince Vanelli played for the
U.S. Junior National team
which toured Europe in June.
The international experience
should be a major strengthen
ing factor on this year's Stan
ford team.
Baseball
While the poloists were
treading foreign waters, three
Stanford baseball players were
hitting singles overseas. Senior
Larry Reynolds played for a
U.S. delegation which toured
Japan. Junior Paul Zuvella and
senior Mike Codiroli both had
successful seasons playing
semi-pro ball in Alaska before
being selected to a team which
represented the United States
in a 10-team international
tournament in Italy.
Soccer
A number of other Stanford
athletes worked out with na
tional and regional teams
which never left the country.
Freshman striker Ted
Rafalovich worked out at the
Olympic training center in
Squaw Valley with the national
under-19 soccer team. Card
teammate midfielder Dan
McNevin, the Cards leading
scorer in 1977, was also at the
Olympic center working out
with the national men's team.
Basketball
Freshmen cagers Jean Ruark
and Angie Paccione both high
school All-Americans last year,
played in the National Sports
Festival during the last week of
July. Ruark played on theSouth
squad, Paccione played for the
East team. '
Golf
On the country club circuit,
Stanford golfers and tennis
players went on a tear. Senior
Sally Voss devoured Eastern

seaboard fairwa 's, capturing
the District of Columbia and
Maryland stat i women's
championships. Doug Clarke
advanced throjgh several
rounds of the I .S. Amateur.
He also succeeded to the
round of 32 in I he California
state amateur cl ampionships
at Cypress Poinj and Pebble
Beach Golf Courses along with
Steve Schrodei and David
Games.
Tenn s
The tennis te;m, however,
was by far the nost prolific
Stanford repres ;ntation this
summerin terms )f honors and
titles won. Natior al titles alone
fill nearly a page
Barb and Kath" Jordan's pa
rents in King of Prussia, Pa.,
must be hard-p essed to ac
commodate all ihe hardware
the sisters have b ought home.
Barb won the national 21 and
under singles titl? and the na
tional 21 hardcou rt crown. She
also won a tourn jment on the
Missouri Valley summer cir
cuit. Her most irr pressive feat,
however, was tcking Martina
Navritolova to the third set at
Wimbledon before losing that
last set, 6-4. Navrjtlova won the
women's championship at
Wimbledon.
Kathy won three titles at the
national amatejr claycourt
championships — singles,
doubles and mi ced doubles.
She also won he national
junior hardcourt :itle in Burlin
game.
Freshman Alycia Moulton
finished fifth in the national
junior tournamet t, behind the
likes of such won len players as
Tracy Austin and Pam Shriver.
On the men'! side of the
court, Peter Ren lert and Matt
Mitchell played he American
Express circu t. Rennert
teamed with Tex is' Kevin Cur

ren to win three straight dou
bles titles, before losing con
secutive finals to Card team
mate Mitchell and '78 Stanford
grad Bill Maze. Jim Hodges,
John Rast and Lloyd Bourne all
played the Missouri Valley cir
cuit, with Bourne winning one
MV tournament this summer.
Sophomore Greg Hing
teamed with classmate Kathy
Jordan to win the mixed dou
bles title at the national
amateur claycourt competi
tion. Freshman Tim Mayotte
won the national junior
claycourt title while Scott Bon
derhant captured the national
junior doubles titles on both
clay and hardcourts. John
Corse played on the Junior
Davis Cup team this summer.
From Olympic training to in
ternational competition, Car
dinal athletes have undoub
tedly matured with their sum
mer experiences. With their re
turn to intercollegiate compet
ition, Stanford should reap the
benefits from their summers at
play.

months playing for the West
Berlin Water Polo Club.

Arnold's Stanford team
mates Chris Kelsey, Jody
Campbell, Randy Kalbus and

Stanford baseball players were
hitting singles overseas. Senior
Larry Reynolds played for a
U.S. delegation which toured

successful seasons playing
semi-pro ball in Alaska before
being selected to a team which
represented the United States
in a 10-team international
tournament in Italy.
Soccer
A number of other Stanford
athletes worked out with na

which never left the country.
Freshman striker Ted
Rafalovich worked out at the
Olympic training center in
Squaw Valley with the national
under-19 soccer team. Card
teammate midfielder Dan
McNevin, the Cards leading

On the country club circuit,
Stanford golfers and tennis

seaboard fairwa 's, capturing
the District of Columbia and

advanced throjgh several

Barbara Jordan (above) and Larry Reynolds (below) were two athletes that took advantage of the summer
months to participate in their sports year round. Jordan won several tennis crowns in national competi

domestic and international opposition in their athletic endeavors. From those returning to the Farm,

Whether churning through
the water in Berlin or hitting
groundstrokes in Burlingame,
Stanford athletes gave good
account of themselves this
summer.
Capping summer perfor
mances by Stanford athletes
were the gold-medal victories
of freshman Linda Jezek and
senior Mike Bruner at the
World Aquatic Games in West
Berlin.
Jezek established herself as
the top women's backstroker
in the world by capturing the
gold in the 100- and 200-meter
backstroke in Berlin, winning
the 200 in world-record time.
The 18-year-old freshman
from Santa Clara added a third
gold with a backstroke leg in
the 400-medley relay. Prior to
Germany, Jezek had set Ameri
can records while winning the
two backstroke races at the
AAU championships in Texas.
Bruner retained his crown as
the top 200-butterfly swimmer
in the world when he fell just
short of his own world record
while winning the gold in Ber
lin. Bruner, the '76 Olympic 200
fly champ, was coming off a
disappointing year of col
legiate swimming.
Waterpolo
Senior Robby Arnold, in
Germany since early last
winter, was also a big splash in
Berlin pools. The second
