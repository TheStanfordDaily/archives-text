Yes folks, the rumors are
fact: In the same vein as taking
Anita Bryant away from orange
juice, O.J. Simpson out of the
airport or the raisins out of
your morning, the vast
bureaucratic voice form above
has handed down an edict
prohibiting cans, bottles, large
vacuum containers and cool
ers, and (OH NO!!!) alcoholic
beverages inside Stanford
Stadium. So leave your case of
Coors at home and buy a hip
flask — or face the unthinkable
atrocity of sitting through a
sweltering Stanford game en
tirely sober.
Have a real good time.
