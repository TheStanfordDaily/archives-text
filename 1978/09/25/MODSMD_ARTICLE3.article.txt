Field Day draws freshman crowd
The first annual freshman Field Day, a new addition to Orientation Week,
drew over 1500 people yesterday afternoon to the deGuerre pool complex
vicinity to participate in a wide range of activities, including a human
pyramid. Soccer, swimming, frisbees, the Band in the pool, or any other
sport you could imagine marked the busy day.
