# Card spikers win opener
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
"Aggressive serving and excellent middle of
fense" provided a win for the Cardinal volleybal
lers Tuesday against UC-lrvine in the first match
of the season, said Fred Sturm, women's vol
leyball coach.
The women have participated in two tourna
ments in addition to>the Irvine match and Sturm,
in his debut season as head coach for the Stan
ford team, is optimistic.
"We're progressing at the rate which I ex
pected," said Sturm. "We're working primarily
on offense because in volleyball losing is a mat
ter of beating yourself. Winning means not sur
rendering any points."
Sturm cited the setting and outside spiking
positions as the strengths of the team. Stanford
has "four of the finest setters in Northern
California and three seniors playing outside
spiker who provide a great deal of leadership,"
Sturm said.
To test those strengths so far this year, Stan
ford has entered two tournaments — UC Davis
on Sept. 16 and the San lose State Invitational
Friday and Saturday.
In Davis Sturm split the team in two and the
Cards monopolized thewinningbrackets taking
first and second, with an 11-1 record for the day.
The San lose tournament was more challenging
for Stanford and the Cards finished fourth be
hind University of the Pacific, San lose State and
Cal.
The San lose Invitational was "more like an
endurance contest," said Sturm. "We played 13
matches in two days, but we accomplished our
objective" — to play together as a team and get
"tuned-up for the league" which opens against
San lose State Oct. 5 at Stanford.
The San lose Tournament featured what
Sturm considers the top four teams in the
Northern California Conference of which Stan
ford is a member. Sturm said University of the
Pacific, San lose, and Cal should offer Stanford
the stiffest competition, and those predictions
came true in the pre-season with the results of
the tourney.

The tournament was run with double elimina
tion and Stanford progressed from their initial
group of four to the final rounds of competition
Saturday. To accomplish that the Cards defeated
the San Jose State junior varsity in two games,
15-5,15-7. They dropped the next set to Cal 15-9,
13-15,13-15 in a close game that was riddled with
inconsistency.
The Cards were up 7-1 in the second game
after beating Cal in the first, 15-9. Up 13-11, the
Cards yielded their lead as the Bears scored 4
straight points to take the match.
In the next set the Cards jumped to another
early lead, 6-0. The tenacious Bears crawled
back to within one point at 13-12. Cal then
stymied the Cardinal offense while reeling off
three straight points to win the set and the
match.
Sturm said that the tendency to give up
"streaks of points is the primary weakness in the
Cardinal game. "We should improve," Sturm
said. "Using our own time schedule, we should
be playing our best near the finals, but it's a
tough progression.
During the first round of the second day of
competition at San lose, Stanford beat Cal
State-North ridge in three games, then lost to Cal
State-Long Beach 3-15, 15-7, 12-15. The Cards
went on to the loser's bracket where they took
on the San Jose State junior varsity for the sec
ond time repeating the win by beating them in
two games. University of the Pacific was the next
contender, managing to put the Cards out of the
tournament with a three-game victory. Stanford
finished fourth overall.
Sturm had praise for the nine returners on the
squad saying they're playing as good now as at
the end of last season. "We've taken off this year
where we left off last year," he said.
Sturm noted Chris Anderson, who switched
from setter to spiker, Shawn Floover and Liz
Hughes as having excellent games. '
More aggressive serving and excellent middle
offense should propel the team into contention
for the AIAW title.

match of the season. Stanford went on to win the opener in three games. The Cards enter the 1978 season
with a 22-win, 8-loss record from last year, nine returners and a new head coach, Fred Sturm.
"Aggressive serving and excellent middle of
fense" provided a win for the Cardinal volleybal
lers Tuesday against UC-lrvine in the first match
of the season, said Fred Sturm, women's vol
leyball coach.
The women have participated in two tourna
ments in addition to>the Irvine match and Sturm,
in his debut season as head coach for the Stan
ford team, is optimistic.
"We're progressing at the rate which I ex
pected," said Sturm. "We're working primarily
on offense because in volleyball losing is a mat
ter of beating yourself. Winning means not sur
rendering any points."
Sturm cited the setting and outside spiking
positions as the strengths of the team. Stanford
has "four of the finest setters in Northern
California and three seniors playing outside
spiker who provide a great deal of leadership,"
Sturm said.
To test those strengths so far this year, Stan
ford has entered two tournaments — UC Davis
on Sept. 16 and the San lose State Invitational
Friday and Saturday.
In Davis Sturm split the team in two and the
Cards monopolized thewinningbrackets taking
first and second, with an 11-1 record for the day.
The San lose tournament was more challenging
for Stanford and the Cards finished fourth be
hind University of the Pacific, San lose State and
Cal.
The San lose Invitational was "more like an
endurance contest," said Sturm. "We played 13
matches in two days, but we accomplished our
objective" — to play together as a team and get
"tuned-up for the league" which opens against
San lose State Oct. 5 at Stanford.
The San lose Tournament featured what
Sturm considers the top four teams in the
Northern California Conference of which Stan
ford is a member. Sturm said University of the
Pacific, San lose, and Cal should offer Stanford
the stiffest competition, and those predictions
came true in the pre-season with the results of
the tourney.

The tournament was run with double elimina
tion and Stanford progressed from their initial
group of four to the final rounds of competition
Saturday. To accomplish that the Cards defeated
the San Jose State junior varsity in two games,
15-5,15-7. They dropped the next set to Cal 15-9,
13-15,13-15 in a close game that was riddled with
inconsistency.
The Cards were up 7-1 in the second game
after beating Cal in the first, 15-9. Up 13-11, the
Cards yielded their lead as the Bears scored 4
straight points to take the match.
In the next set the Cards jumped to another
early lead, 6-0. The tenacious Bears crawled
back to within one point at 13-12. Cal then
stymied the Cardinal offense while reeling off
three straight points to win the set and the
match.
Sturm said that the tendency to give up
"streaks of points is the primary weakness in the
Cardinal game. "We should improve," Sturm
said. "Using our own time schedule, we should
be playing our best near the finals, but it's a
tough progression.
During the first round of the second day of
competition at San lose, Stanford beat Cal
State-North ridge in three games, then lost to Cal
State-Long Beach 3-15, 15-7, 12-15. The Cards
went on to the loser's bracket where they took
on the San Jose State junior varsity for the sec
ond time repeating the win by beating them in
two games. University of the Pacific was the next
contender, managing to put the Cards out of the
tournament with a three-game victory. Stanford
finished fourth overall.
Sturm had praise for the nine returners on the
squad saying they're playing as good now as at
the end of last season. "We've taken off this year
where we left off last year," he said.
Sturm noted Chris Anderson, who switched
from setter to spiker, Shawn Floover and Liz
Hughes as having excellent games. '
More aggressive serving and excellent middle
offense should propel the team into contention
for the AIAW title.
