Napa, Calif. (AP) — Stanford
graduate Tom Watson, playing
on the course where he
launched his professional golf
career seven years ago, shot
into the lead with an eagle on
the fifth hole yesterday and
coasted to his fifth tournament
title of the year with a final
round 67 in Napa's $200,000
tour event.
The 29-year-old Watson led
by six strokes after posting his
fifth birdie of the day at the
15th hole, took his second
bogey at the 16th and parred
the final two holes in finishing
with a 72-hole total of 18-
under-par 270, three strokes
ahead of Ed Sneed, who closed
with a 70.
Watson was under 70 on all
four rounds at the 6870-yard,
par-72 Silverado Country Club.
His 270 total was one over the
tournament record set by 1971
winner Billy Caspar.
Watson received a $40,000
first-place check, increasing
his 1978 tour earnings to
$343,429, virtually clinching a

second consecutive money
winning title. He has won
$1,182,391 since joining the
tour by playing in Napa's 1971
tournament.
Barry Jaeckel, winner of the
Tallahassee Open earlier this
year, finished third at 275. Bob
Zender, Bob Gilder, Orville
Moody and D.A. Weibring tied
for fourth at 276.
Watson, who won $310,000
on the tour last year, already
has put together the best two
consecutive financial seasons
by a golfer. With a good finish
in next weekend's $300,000
World Series of Golf in Akron,
Ohio, he would break johnny
Miller's PGA single-season
money-winning record of
$353,021.
Miller is going through hard
times now and his troubles
were compounded yesterday
when he disqualified himself
from the tournament on his
home course. The former tour
star has won just $17,440 this
year.
