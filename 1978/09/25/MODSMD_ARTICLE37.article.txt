# Soccer team nips Portland
## 
### 
Freshman Jack McGannon, a
substitute late in the game,
drove home the only goal of
the contest with less than six
minutes left to lift the Stanford
soccer team to a 1-0 victory
over Portland Saturday at Harry
Maloney Field.
The goal, 84 minutes, 20 sec
onds into the game, gave the
Cards their third win — not in
cluding their 2-1 triumph over
the alumni — of the season,
keeping alive a string begun

with a comeback 4-3 victory
over UOP and a 3-1 pasting of
Oregon.
Despite the early season
successes of the Cards — a
marked contrast to last year
when Stanford won only one of
its first eight games — soccer
coach Nelson Lodge said the
team still has a lot of work to
do.
"Our counter-attack move
ment is too predictable,"
Lodge said. "We don't have

enough crossing up front. Our
strikers are running straight
down the field."
The defense picked up its
first shutout of the season.
Whitewash notwithstanding,
Lodge said the "defensive
marking was shabby at times."
Lodge said that although he
felt the team had it all together
during the Oregon match,
Saturday's sultry weather
drained both teams and limited
performance.
"i felt we were better than
Portland with 15 minutes left in
the contest," Lodge said. "I
just saw the films today and it
looked like we were really
pressing with 15 minutes left
and they were beginning to fal
ter."
Lodge said the Portland goal
keeper kept the visitors in the
game. Three Stanford shots
bounced off the goal bars,
another factor which kept the
game low-scoring.
Stanford's conditioning
superiority at the end of the
game may have resulted partly
from the five extra practice
days the University gave the
soccer team this autumn.
Lodge said the early practice
and freshman striker Ted
Rafalovich are key factors in
the reversal of early-season
fortunes for the Cardinals.
Rafalovich, a high school
All-American last year in
Saratoga, has four goals this
season counting his goals in
the alumni game.
Tomorrow the Cards host
UC-Davis at 2 p.m. The nation
ally ranked San Jose State Spar
tans invade Harry Maloney
Field Friday and Stanislaus
State plays here Saturday at 10
a.m. before the Tulane-
Stanford football game.
