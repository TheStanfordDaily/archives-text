# At Board of Trustees meeting
## Controversial land deal approved 
### MIKE CHARLSON 
Senior staff writer
The Board of Trustees have given
final approval to a controversial plan
to sell 694 acres of land, paving the
way for a closing on the deal this
week.
At its September 12 meeting, the
board approved plans to sell the so
called Black Mountain Ranch land to
the Mid-Peninsula Regional Open
Space District (MPROSD) for
$475,000, or about $684 per acre. The
board approved the plan despite
charges that the University was sel
ling the land for below market price
and giving MPROSD a "sweetheart
deal."
The terms of the sale are substan
tially the same as those approved by
the board at its meeting last February
14, according to Vice President for
Businessand Finance William Massy.
But Massy said the deed will be
altered to make explicit agreements
that the land will not be developed
and that the University will retain the
right to use the land for educational
purposes.
Underselling land
In May, University alumnus and
Palo Alto attorney Harry Aine
charged that the University was un
derselling the land by somesl.6 mill
ion. An independent appraisal au
thorized by Aine valued the land at
about $3000 per acre.
Aine had charged in March that the
University was giving MPROSD a
"sweetheart deal." Aine said he had
ordered the appraisal himself after
he learned that details of the sale had
been reached without an appraisal of
the land.
At that time Aine said he wrote the
University a letter urging an appraisal
and heard nothing. He said he then
wrote another letter offering to pay
for the appraisal and heard nothing.
Finally he said he went ahead with
the appraisal on his own. The report
from independent appraiser Edward
laynes placed theValue of the land at
$2.08 million. '
Massy said that price might be ac
curate if the land could be de
veloped. "Land which must be held
forever as undeveloped, however, is
not worth nearly as much as land

which could be developed," Massy
said.
'Maximum development'
He said the laynes assessment as
sumed the "maximum development
possible" under Palo Alto zoning
regulations and restrictions.
The laynes appraisal was done
without University or MPROSD ap
proval.
Aine was not available for com
ment on the board action. Massy said
the University has notified him of the
board action, has heard nothing
from him, and plans to close the sale
this week.
The property is located along Page
Mill Road near Foothill Park and
forms a link between two parcels al
ready owned by the MPROSD. When
connected, the land will form a

6000-acre continuous corridor of
open space spanning the area from
Saratoga Gap to Page Mill Road and
Foothill Park.
Remain undeveloped
Massy said, however, that Morell
requested that the land remain un
developed, and that the sale will
honor his wishes. In addition, the
sale retains the land for University
educational use.
"Given the restrictions involved in
the sale," Massy said, "I stand by my
statement of last February that the
sale price is fair and reasonable."
In other trustee action, the board
approved a $2.1 million plan to com
plete the third floor of the Sherman
Fairchild Science Building at the
Medical Center.
