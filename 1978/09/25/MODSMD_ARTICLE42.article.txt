cording to Evered.
"Freshmen are unique in
that they're untainted by
academics and are ready to try
anything whatsoever, whether
social or academic."
"In fact, freshmen paint
things brighter colors than
they really are. They are overly
impressed by some things, like
by the wisdom of the resident
staff, for instance," Robinson
said.
But, in being naive,
freshmen also come off to
others as "understandably
simple, not complex in their
thinking."
"They talk happy, hear
happy, look happy," one up
perclassman said, "but they'll
wake up soon enough, and be

dents, the frosh are still mostly
human."
