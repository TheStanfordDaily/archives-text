Assad vetoes peace plan
Damascus, Syria — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance completed his five-day Middle East
tour yesterday by meeting with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad and flew home without
gaining the Arab support he sought for the
Camp David peace accords.
Speaking privately, U.S. officials said
Vance had hoped only to persuade Assad to
soften his opposition to the Camp David ag
reements so other Arab governments might
find it easier to accept them. But senior Sy
rian sources said Assad told Vance it was
impossible for Syria to change its position.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli
Cabinet approved the Camp David accords,
which are to be submitted to Parliament for
ratification later this week.
In Kuwait, the daily Al-Qabas newspaper
reported that Assad and Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation, plan to go to Saudi Arabia to brief
Saudi leaders on last week's anti-Camp
David summit in Damascus.
Somoza quashes uprising
Managua, Nicaragua — President Anas
tasio Somoza used troops, tanks and
warplanes to quell the latest and bloodiest
uprising against his rule, but the fight to oust
him appears far from over.
Somoza said he unleashed his military
forces on Esteli and three other major cities
to save the nation from communism, which
he claims is being imported by Cuban
trained Sandinista guerrillas.
One Red Cross spokesman estimated 2000
people may have died in Esteli alone, al
though firm figures have been impossible to
obtain. Red Cross spokesmen estimate
more than 1000 died in earlier fighting in
Leon, Chinandenga and Masaya, and that

10,000 people may have fled the country idur
ing the violence.
The nationwide rebellion was
spearheaded by the Sandinista National Lib
eration Front, a group named after a Nicara
guan rebel of the 19305. The group was
formed by a Cuban-trained Marxist, Carlos
Fonseca Amador, who was killed by Somoza
troops in a mountain battle about two years
ago.
Busing plan continues in L.A.
Los Angeles — White students are attend
ing Los Angeles public schools in slightly
higher numbers since the start of an integra
tion program this fall, but opponents of
court-ordered busing say white attendance
will fall far short of school officials' expecta
tions.
The busing of 62,000 fourth-through
eighth graders in the nation's second-largest
school district began peacefully Sept. 12 as
part of an integration plan that emerged
after court cases spanning 15 years.
At first the buses carried only a few white
youngsters across the 711-square-mile
school district, from the predominantly
white San Fernando Valley to inner-city
minority schools. Since then attendance by
white students has increased daily, but the
district's own figures released last week in
dicate thousands are staying at home or are
illegally enrolled in neighborhood schools.
Paper strike talks to resume
New York — Negotiations aimed at ending
a pressmen's strike that has closed New
York's three major newspapers for 46 days
move to Washington today.
Kenneth Moffett, a federal mediator, re
quested that the talks be moved and the
publishers, after first rejecting the idea, ag

reed Saturday.
Theodore Kheel, adviser to the 8500
members of other unions idled by the strike
called by 1550 pressmen, tried to induce
both sides Monday to reach an accord that
would get the New York Times, Daily News
and New York Post back in publication.
The pressmen struck Aug. 9, months after
most newspaper contracts expired here
March 30, following a unilateral change of
work rules by the publishers. The changes
were aimed at pressroom "overstaffing and
featherbedding" that the publishers said
were destroying their ability to compete
with suburban papers.
Senate slates gas bill vote
Washington — Senate leaders are confi
dent a natural gas pricing compromise can
win passage this week, and they are trying to
make sure nothing gets in the way of the
expected victory for President )immy Car
ter's energy plan.
During a rare Saturday morning session,
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd resorted
to parliamentary maneuvering to avert a
threat of delaying tactics against the natural
gas bill by supporters of a proposed dead
line extension for the Equal Rights Amend
ment.
Byrd's action put the ERA extension bill in
•a position to be brought up at any time,
although no firm date was set, and cleared
the way for a final Senate vote Wednesday
on a natural gas bill.
The compromise bill would permit steady
increases in the price of newly discovered
gas until 1985 when price controls would be
lifted.
The House-passed ERA extension legisla
tion would give ERA backers until 1982 to
secure approval of the required 38 state
legislatures. The extension was being

jeopardized by the crush of legislative busi
ness as the target adjournment date of Oct.
14 approached.
Bakke to start med school
Davis — Allan Bakke, whose name has be
come a symbol of the conflict over equal
opportunity for minorities, starts classes at
the University of California Medical School
today, five years after he first applied for
admission.
Bakke, a 38-year-old white engineer, is
being admitted to the medical school at
Davis under the U.S. Supreme Court order
in June that struck down the school's prefe
rential admissions program for minorities.
The court ruled on a 5-4 vote that the prog
ram, which reserved 16 places in each class
of 100 for low-income minority group mem
bers, violated Bakke's constitutional rights.
But the court also ruled on a separate 5-4
vote that race could be taken into account to
maintain diversity in admissions.
That portion of the ruling was hailed by
many civil-rights groups as the preservation
of affirmative action programs.
Teacher strike plague U.S.
An end to the teachers' strike in
Bridgeport, Conn., where more than 260 in
structors have been jailed and classes dis
rupted for 19 days, appeared possible yes
terday as agreement was reached on binding
arbitration during a long weekend bargain
ing session.
The city's school board and the city
council still have to approve a binding
proposal by State Labor Commissioner Peter
Reilly to end the strike.
Reilly said Bridgeport public schools
could reopen this morning, and the striking
teachers jailed at a National Guard facility in

Windsor Locks could be released if the dis
pute is settled.
The Bridgeport strike is one of several af
fecting nearly 500,000 students in seven
states.
Meanwhile, walkouts by teachers in
Washington's two largest districts — Seattle
and Tacoma — are entering their fourth
week.
Dayton, Ohio, teachers and non-certified
school employees have refused to obey a
back-to-work order despite threats of fines.
They began their protest on Sept. 6.
The 37,000-pupil system there is one of
five districts in Ohio still affected by strikes.
School officials in Cleveland said classes
for that city's 100,000 pupils would be closed
again today because of financial problems.
