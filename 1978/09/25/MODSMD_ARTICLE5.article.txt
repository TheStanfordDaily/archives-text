# DeLeeuw memorial set; murder suspect arraigned
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
A memorial service for Karel de-
Leeuw, a professor of mathematics
here who was murdered last month
while working in his University of
fice, will be held at 4 p.m. Oct. 6 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Theodore Streleski, a part-time
graduate student here, will be tried
for murder in the case which is
scheduled to begin on Nov. 29.
DeLeeuw was discovered dead in
his office in the late afternoon of
Aug. 18, by a janitor making cleaning
rounds. Early the next morning,
Streleski turned himself in to Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies.
At that time Streleski told de
puties, "I am concerned about an in
dividual on the Stanford campus who
is seriously injured or dead. I want
his relatives to know or be notified. I
hit him over the head with a hammer.
It's in the bag over there near the
door. There's some blood on it. It's
in a plastic bag. There is also a roll of
Scotch tape which I used to place a
sign on his doorway entrance."
Only statement
This has been Streleski's only
statement to authorities, according
to Sheriff's Sgt. Gary Meeker.
An examination of deLeeuw's
body revealed that his skull had been
crushed by repeated blows with a
blunt instrument. A small sign writ
ten on a 3-by-5 card which read "No
office hours today. Family
Emergency" had been attached to
deLeeuw's office door with tape, ac
cording to Meeker. Deputies disco
vered a small sledgehammer, a roll of
tape and some 3-by-5 cards in the bag
Streleski brought with him to the
sheriff's office.
Tests are still being conducted to
determine whether blood and hair
on the hammer match those of the
victim and whether the tape in the
bag matches that which was used to
put up the sign found on deLeeuw's
door, according to Meeker.
A motive for the killing has yet to
be established. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Halsey Royden,
Streleski's current dissertation ad
viser, said he noticed nothing un
usual about the graduate student
during their last meeting. Royden
said he had noticed that Streleski felt
"a little unhappy about some per
ceived unfair treatment" from the
mathematics department in the past.
However, he called the murder
"completely inexplicable."
Slight connection
Paul Berg, vice-chairman of the
mathematics department, explained
that Streleski had only a slight con

nection with deLeeuw in the past.
DeLeeuw had been Streleski's
course adviser about 10 years ago,
but there had been no connection
between the two since Streleski
finished his course work in the mid
'6os. Streleski began working on his
dissertation in the early 70s under a
different adviser.
Streleski, 42, lived on 46th Avenue
in San Francisco until about 1975. His
current residence is unknown, and
his only given address is a post office
box in San Francisco. Streleski's pub
lic defender acknowledged that he
knew the graduate student's address
but would not divulge it.
According to the Palo Alto Times,
Streleski was employed until last
April at an electronics firm in Hay
ward. No one there knew where he is

living now or what he has been doing
since the time he left the job. Rela
tives, including Streleski's ex-wife,
have not seen him for some time
either, according to the Times.
Rarely around
Berg said Streleski was rarely
around th? department and did not
associate with the other graduate
students.
Streleski also had worked previ
ously as a mathematics instructor, at
San Francisco State, according to the
Sari lose Mercury.
The Palo Alto Times recently car
ried a story about conversations
Streleski had with Phoebe Sease, an
employee at The Brewing Pot, a cof
feehouse in Palo Alto. According to
that story, Streleski c?me to see
