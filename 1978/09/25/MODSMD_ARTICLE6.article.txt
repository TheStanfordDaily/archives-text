The Santa Clara District Attorney's
Office used a search warrant last
week to obtain material from the of
fice of the county's public defender
in the case of Theodore Streleski, the
man who is charged with the murder
of Stanford Mathematics Prof. Karel
deLeeuw.
Some of the materials that the
Santa Clara County Public Defen
der's Office had gathered in prepara
tion for Streleski's defense were
seized during the third party search,
according to Howard Seigal, chief as
sistant public defender.
Questions raised by this search of
a non-suspect are similar to those
raised in the recent U.S. Supreme

Court case involving a 1971 search of
the offices of The Stanford Daily by
police. In both cases the search was
initiated against a third party not in
volved in the crime and in both cases
certain special considerations were
involved, including freedom of the
press and the attorney-client
privilege.
Seigal said he will challenge the
validity of the search in court, asking
that the evidence obtained be sup
pressed and requesting that all mate
rials seized be returned to his pos
session.
Spokesmen for the District Attor
ney's Office could not be reached for
comment.
Seigal said that as far as he knows
