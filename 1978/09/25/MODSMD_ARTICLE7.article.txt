# Miller resigns as provost, joins GSB
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
William Miller, the soft-spoken
vice president arid provost of the
University for the past eight years,
resigned last week to accept a
Graduate School of Business pro
fessorship.
Miller, in his role as second
ranking academic officer here,
has been widely acclaimed for
re-establishing a balanced operat
ing budget at the University while
maintaining a high level of faculty
morale and program quality.
Miller has accepted an ap
pointment as first recipient of the
newly established Herbert
Hoover Professorship in Public
and Private Management at the
GSB. He said he will divide his
time equally with the Computer
Science Department where he has
held a full professorship since
1965.
The Hoover professorship was
endowed with a $1 million be
quest from the estate of Flora
Hewlett, a trustee from 1975 until
her death last year.
According to Raymond Bac

chetti, vice provost for budget
and planning, the model tells ad
ministrators the likely outcome of
a course of action given a set of
assumptions and allows for
"trade-off experimentation."
Heavily involved
Miller was also heavily involved
in the $300 million Campaign for
Stanford, which ended success
fully last April. Miller served as the
head liaison with foundations and
corporations during the five-year
drive, the largest of its kind ever
completed.
As one of his chief respon
sibilities, Miller worked closely
with faculty on the Commission of
the Professoriate at Stanford mak
ing decisions on faculty appoint
ments, promotions and appor
tionment.
Pinpointing library costs as one
of two spiraling costs in the
operating budget, Miller recom
mended and now heads a task
force studying long-term trends in
library services.
He is noted for decisions to
strengthen Hopkins Marine Sta
tion, which is a biology depart

ment facility in Pacific Grove and
the chemistry and German de
partments.
Miller announced the phase
out of the undergraduate ar
chitecture program and came
under fire from students for a
substantial budget reduction for
the overseas study program.
New challenge
"I really enjoyed what I was do
ing, but. . . I'm the type who feels
I need new challenges every once
in a while," Miller said. "And this
new position has lots of new chal
lenges."
Miller drew praise from Presi
dent Richard Lyman, who called
Miller's work as provost "simply
extraordinary."
During Miller's years as pro
vost, he was responsible for im
plementing the Budget Adjust
ment Program and the Budget
Equilibrium Program, a successful
$10 million belt-tightening prog
ram completed last year, which
brought the University's operat
ing budget into balance.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig lauded the

budget cutting itself, but felt it
most significant that Miller "pul
led it (the budget cutting) off with
a minimum of disruption and hard
feelings," a "substantial achieve
ment."
Miller said, "The biggest job
was rebuilding faculty confidence
and morale and keeping the prog
ram quality high."
Praised by students
Miller was praised by students,
however, when he reversed a pro
fessor's decision in a grade dis
pute with a student.
History Prof. Peter Stansky,
former chairman of the Faculty
Senate, said although some of
Miller's decisions weren't popular
with the entire faculty, relations
with the provost were "excel
lent." Stansky said Miller was al
ways "clear and open to questions
from the faculty." He charac
terized Miller as "firm, but
reasonable."
Lyman will personally head the
search committee to find a re
placement for Miller, but Assis

tant to the President Jean Fetter
said no specific decisions about
the committee have been made
yet. She said an announcement
about the search is likely within "a
week or so."
Rosenzweig said, "Odds would
favor an internal candidate" as a
replacement because there would
be more continuity, and that per
son would have the confidence of
the faculty.
Miller's resignation is effective
Jan. 1, 1979.
