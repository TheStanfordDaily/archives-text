# What happened here during the summer session
## 
### JOHN NIELSEN Senior Staff Writer 
It was a newsworthy summer
at the University.
The Bakke decision received
largely positive responses from
the administration here ... re
sults of the alumni-trustee
elections showed the lowest
turnout ever . . . University
President Richard Lyman re
turned from a 12-day trip to
South Africa and said that his
"opinion has not greatly
changed about what we can
and should do" in that coun
try. . .
Former President Gerald
Ford, Oregon Sen. Mark Hat
field, former California Gov.
Ronald Reagan, and former
Secretary of the Treasury Wil
liam Simon met on the steps of
Hoover Tower for the dedica
tion of the Herbert Hoover
Federal Memorial Building . . .
the Stanford Hospital averted a
strike by registered nurses with
a new two-year contract. . .
Events sure to influence the
course of campus affairs occur
red with regularity, and long
standing issues took new
shapes and directions. What
follows is an overview of what
happened while you were
gone.
Medical Center
denied funds
June 30 — The California Sup
reme Court refused to review a
lower court decision which
had held it unconstitutional for
the state to pay the University
for expanding its enrollment.
That move cost the University
$448,000 in state funds.
In 1973 Stanford agreed to
increase its Medical School en
rollment in return for more
state funds. However, during
the 1975-76 school year the
state controller's office de
cided the payments were il
legal and refused to continue
the funding. The Court of Ap
peals agreed with the control
ler's decision.
Officials respond to
Bakke decision
June 30 — Most campus ad
ministrators reacted optimisti
cally to a Supreme Court deci

sion ordering a University of
California Medical School to
admit Allan Bakke on the
grounds that he had been a vic
tim of discrimination. Al
though Stanford, along with
Columbia, Harvard, and the
University of Pennsylvania,
had filed an amicus curiae brief
supporting the U.C. Davis
Medical School admissions
program, the decision abolish
ing quota systems prompted
fewer loud disagreements than
many had expected.
Law Prof. Gerald Cunther
said that "Bakke had won —
but so have most minority ad
missions programs in use in
America's colleges and
graduate schools."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon noted that "while
ruling out quotas, which Stan
ford has not used, it apparently
allows us to continue to take
the background of students
into consideration in our at
tempts to bring together a stu
dent body," Hargadon added
that Stanford's enrollment of
blacks, Chicanos, and native
Americans at the under
graduate level reached a re
cord high last year.
Maria Baeza, assistant to the
president for Chicano affairs,

said the distinction drawn bet
ween quota systt ms and other
methods of takin »race into ac
count should en< ure that Stan
ford's policies will be mini
mally affected.
Black Media Ir stitute Direc
tor William Strcud said that
while many p< rsons were
"shocked" by the decision, it
apparently "leaves the door
open for affirmative action."
Nurses OK contract
July 7 — Registered nurses at
the Stanford Hoipital reached
final agreement on a two-year
contract with hospital adminis
trators.
The nurses, represented by
CRONA (Committee for Rec
ognition of Nur; ing Achieve
ments), settled on a contract
providing for a seven percent
wage increase fo the first year
and an addition.il adjustment
of equal size in 1980.
CRONA members who had
announced their intention to
go on strike if ; n agreement
was not reached by July 2 had
been dissatisif ?d with the
handling of nego iations by the
Hospital. Specif c complaints
include a lack of discussion of
salaries and reti ement prog
rams until nearlya month after

the contract discussion bad
begun.
The agreement averted a
possible repetition of a
CRONA-led strike four years
ago, when the6lB-bed hospital
reduced its patient load from
more than 500 to a low of 72.
Burglary
rate drops
July 11 — The Department of
Public Safety reported that
"aggressive patrolling" and a
"heavy crime prevention prog
ram" have kept the University
burglary rate law. Thefts from
University structures and fa
culty houses have leveled off
after dropping 46 percent from
the rate two years ago.
Captain William
Wullschleger, head of the field
operations division, reported
that the burglary rate here was
running even with that of the
previous summer, down con
siderably from the 1975-76 rate.
In contrast, sharp increases
in the burglary rate have occur
red in nearby communities
such as Los Altos, Palo Alto, Los
Gatos and Campbell.
Election turnout
prompts review
July 14 — A steady decline in
the number of returned ballots
for the alumni-trustee election
prompted the Stanford Alumni
Association Executive Commit
tee (AEC) to plan a formal re
view of the election process.
Since 1970, alumni have
been elected every two years
to serve a four-year term on the
Board of Trustees. Ballots are
mailed to all Stanford
graduates.
Of the 110,995 ballots mailed
in last May's election, only
16,859 were returned.
Alumni Association Director
William Stone reported that
the AEC and the trustees were
"in complete agreement as to
the value of a review" involving
"a long, serious look at the
whole process."
Hoover Memorial
dedicated
July 21 — One former presi
dent paid tribute to another as

Gerald Ford formally dedicated
the Herbert Hoover Federal
Memorial Building in a cere
mony on the steps of Hoover
Tower. The five-story building,
which houses offices, the arc
hives and special collections of
the Hoover Institution Press, is
the latest addition to the In
stitution, founded by Hoover
in 1919.
As president, Ford has
signed legislation three years
ago designating the memorial
and approving federal funding
for the new building. It is the
nation's sole memorial to
Hoover.
Oregon Senator and Stan
ford alumnus Mark Hatfield,
who introduced the Hoover
Memorial bill in Congress, also
spoke in appreciation of
Hoover's life and accomplish
ments. The audience of over
1000 included former Califor
nia Gov. Ronald Reagan,
former Secretary of the Treas
ury William Simon and Shirley
Temple Black.
Hospital accredited
July 31 — The Stanford Hospi
tal received full two-year ac
creditation from the Joint
Committee on Accreditation of
Hospitals (JCAH), indicating
that significant progress had
been made towards the correc
tion of deficiencies cited in
previous JCAH reports.
The decision, which fol
lowed three consecutive one
year accreditations, was based
on a survey conducted by
members of the JCAH, the
California Department of
Health, and the California
Medical Association.
Libel suit
filed
AugustB — A 53.75 million libel
suit was filed against Art His
tory Prof. Albert Elsen, one of
the world's leading experts on
French sculptor Auguste Ro
din.
The suit, filed in Santa Clara
County superior court by
George Schattle of Menlo Park,
concerns four sculptures
owned by Schattle, which
Elsen determined were defi
nitely not by Rodin.

Schattle claims that Elsen's
public comments about the
sculptures libeled him and
prevented him from selling the
pieces.
Elsen allegedly wrote a letter
to KGO-TV newsman Jerry Jen
sen, in which he claimed that
Schattle and another man were
"trying to con unsuspecting
businessmen into buying four
reputedly unique Rodin
sculptures" which were actu
ally "outright fakes."
Lyman reviews
trip
August 10 — Back from a 12-day
trip to South Africa, President
Richard Lyman told an alumni
symposium that "my opinion
has not greatly changed about
what we can and should do"
regarding the role of the Un
ited States in that country.
Lyman had attended a multi
racial, multinational confer
ence on the future of South Af
rica, co-sponsored by the
World Peace Foundation of
Boston and the South African
Institute of International Af
fairs.

Lyman said that those at the
conference "discussed a lot of
options, and came to agree
ment on none/' and that he
personally "doesn't see a way
out that shows a great deal of
promise."
He spoke out most strongly
against the South African mig
ratory labor policy, which re
quires that black African males
be transported from theirtribal
homelands to urban work
camps.
"Urban blacks are the rock
on which the government
keeps stumbling," said Lyman.
"They have become so integ
rated into the South African
economy they cannot be ex
truded while to give them full
political rights means turning
over the country to a black
majority."
Lyman visited Pretoria,
Johannesburg (including a trip
to Soweto), the Transkei, King
Williams Town and Capetown.
He concluded that while "sup
erficially" there appeared to be
"a large number of people liv
ing a free life ... if there is a
South African that feels en
tirely free, I didn't meet him."

ministrators reacted optimisti
cally to a Supreme Court deci

sion ordering a University of
California Medical School to
admit Allan Bakke on the
grounds that he had been a vic
tim of discrimination. Al
though Stanford, along with
Columbia, Harvard, and the
University of Pennsylvania,
had filed an amicus curiae brief
supporting the U.C. Davis
Medical School admissions
program, the decision abolish
ing quota systems prompted
fewer loud disagreements than
many had expected.
Law Prof. Gerald Cunther
said that "Bakke had won —
but so have most minority ad
missions programs in use in
America's colleges and
graduate schools."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon noted that "while
ruling out quotas, which Stan
ford has not used, it apparently
allows us to continue to take
the background of students
into consideration in our at
tempts to bring together a stu
dent body," Hargadon added
that Stanford's enrollment of
blacks, Chicanos, and native
Americans at the under
graduate level reached a re
cord high last year.
Maria Baeza, assistant to the
president for Chicano affairs,

said the distinction drawn bet
ween quota systt ms and other
methods of takin »race into ac
count should en< ure that Stan
ford's policies will be mini
mally affected.
Black Media Ir stitute Direc
tor William Strcud said that
while many p< rsons were
"shocked" by the decision, it
apparently "leaves the door
open for affirmative action."
Nurses OK contract
July 7 — Registered nurses at
the Stanford Hoipital reached
final agreement on a two-year
contract with hospital adminis
trators.
The nurses, represented by
CRONA (Committee for Rec
ognition of Nur; ing Achieve
ments), settled on a contract
providing for a seven percent
wage increase fo the first year
and an addition.il adjustment
of equal size in 1980.
CRONA members who had
announced their intention to
go on strike if ; n agreement
was not reached by July 2 had
been dissatisif ?d with the
handling of nego iations by the
Hospital. Specif c complaints
include a lack of discussion of
salaries and reti ement prog
rams until nearlya month after

the contract discussion bad
begun.
The agreement averted a
possible repetition of a
CRONA-led strike four years
ago, when the6lB-bed hospital
reduced its patient load from
more than 500 to a low of 72.
Burglary
rate drops
July 11 — The Department of
Public Safety reported that
"aggressive patrolling" and a
"heavy crime prevention prog
ram" have kept the University
burglary rate law. Thefts from
University structures and fa
culty houses have leveled off
after dropping 46 percent from
the rate two years ago.
Captain William
Wullschleger, head of the field
operations division, reported
that the burglary rate here was
running even with that of the
previous summer, down con
siderably from the 1975-76 rate.
In contrast, sharp increases
in the burglary rate have occur
red in nearby communities
such as Los Altos, Palo Alto, Los
Gatos and Campbell.
Election turnout
prompts review
July 14 — A steady decline in
the number of returned ballots
for the alumni-trustee election
prompted the Stanford Alumni
Association Executive Commit
tee (AEC) to plan a formal re
view of the election process.
Since 1970, alumni have
been elected every two years
to serve a four-year term on the
Board of Trustees. Ballots are
mailed to all Stanford
graduates.
Of the 110,995 ballots mailed
in last May's election, only
16,859 were returned.
Alumni Association Director
William Stone reported that
the AEC and the trustees were
"in complete agreement as to
the value of a review" involving
"a long, serious look at the
whole process."
Hoover Memorial
dedicated
July 21 — One former presi
dent paid tribute to another as

Gerald Ford formally dedicated
the Herbert Hoover Federal
Memorial Building in a cere
mony on the steps of Hoover
Tower. The five-story building,
which houses offices, the arc
hives and special collections of
the Hoover Institution Press, is
the latest addition to the In
stitution, founded by Hoover
in 1919.
As president, Ford has
signed legislation three years
ago designating the memorial
and approving federal funding
for the new building. It is the
nation's sole memorial to
Hoover.
Oregon Senator and Stan
ford alumnus Mark Hatfield,
who introduced the Hoover
Memorial bill in Congress, also
spoke in appreciation of
Hoover's life and accomplish
ments. The audience of over
1000 included former Califor
nia Gov. Ronald Reagan,
former Secretary of the Treas
ury William Simon and Shirley
Temple Black.
Hospital accredited
July 31 — The Stanford Hospi
tal received full two-year ac
creditation from the Joint
Committee on Accreditation of
Hospitals (JCAH), indicating
that significant progress had
been made towards the correc
tion of deficiencies cited in
previous JCAH reports.
The decision, which fol
lowed three consecutive one
year accreditations, was based
on a survey conducted by
members of the JCAH, the
California Department of
Health, and the California
Medical Association.
Libel suit
filed
AugustB — A 53.75 million libel
suit was filed against Art His
tory Prof. Albert Elsen, one of
the world's leading experts on
French sculptor Auguste Ro
din.
The suit, filed in Santa Clara
County superior court by
George Schattle of Menlo Park,
concerns four sculptures
owned by Schattle, which
Elsen determined were defi
nitely not by Rodin.

Schattle claims that Elsen's
public comments about the
sculptures libeled him and
prevented him from selling the
pieces.
Elsen allegedly wrote a letter
to KGO-TV newsman Jerry Jen
sen, in which he claimed that
Schattle and another man were
"trying to con unsuspecting
businessmen into buying four
reputedly unique Rodin
sculptures" which were actu
ally "outright fakes."
Lyman reviews
trip
August 10 — Back from a 12-day
trip to South Africa, President
Richard Lyman told an alumni
symposium that "my opinion
has not greatly changed about
what we can and should do"
regarding the role of the Un
ited States in that country.
Lyman had attended a multi
racial, multinational confer
ence on the future of South Af
rica, co-sponsored by the
World Peace Foundation of
Boston and the South African
Institute of International Af
fairs.

Lyman said that those at the
conference "discussed a lot of
options, and came to agree
ment on none/' and that he
personally "doesn't see a way
out that shows a great deal of
promise."
He spoke out most strongly
against the South African mig
ratory labor policy, which re
quires that black African males
be transported from theirtribal
homelands to urban work
camps.
"Urban blacks are the rock
on which the government
keeps stumbling," said Lyman.
"They have become so integ
rated into the South African
economy they cannot be ex
truded while to give them full
political rights means turning
over the country to a black
majority."
Lyman visited Pretoria,
Johannesburg (including a trip
to Soweto), the Transkei, King
Williams Town and Capetown.
He concluded that while "sup
erficially" there appeared to be
"a large number of people liv
ing a free life ... if there is a
South African that feels en
tirely free, I didn't meet him."

Medical Center
denied funds
June 30 — The California Sup

lower court decision which
had held it unconstitutional for
the state to pay the University
for expanding its enrollment.

In 1973 Stanford agreed to

ments), settled on a contract
providing for a seven percent
wage increase fo the first year
and an addition.il adjustment
of equal size in 1980.
CRONA members who had
announced their intention to
go on strike if ; n agreement
was not reached by July 2 had
been dissatisif ?d with the
handling of nego iations by the
Hospital. Specif c complaints
include a lack of discussion of
salaries and reti ement prog
rams until nearlya month after

the contract discussion bad
begun.
The agreement averted a
possible repetition of a
CRONA-led strike four years
ago, when the6lB-bed hospital
reduced its patient load from
more than 500 to a low of 72.
Burglary
rate drops
July 11 — The Department of
Public Safety reported that
"aggressive patrolling" and a
"heavy crime prevention prog
ram" have kept the University
burglary rate law. Thefts from
University structures and fa
culty houses have leveled off
after dropping 46 percent from
the rate two years ago.
Captain William
Wullschleger, head of the field
operations division, reported
that the burglary rate here was
running even with that of the
previous summer, down con
siderably from the 1975-76 rate.
In contrast, sharp increases
in the burglary rate have occur
red in nearby communities
such as Los Altos, Palo Alto, Los
Gatos and Campbell.
Election turnout
prompts review
July 14 — A steady decline in
the number of returned ballots
for the alumni-trustee election
prompted the Stanford Alumni
Association Executive Commit
tee (AEC) to plan a formal re
view of the election process.
Since 1970, alumni have
been elected every two years
to serve a four-year term on the
Board of Trustees. Ballots are
mailed to all Stanford
graduates.
Of the 110,995 ballots mailed
in last May's election, only
16,859 were returned.
Alumni Association Director
William Stone reported that
the AEC and the trustees were
"in complete agreement as to
the value of a review" involving
"a long, serious look at the
whole process."
Hoover Memorial
dedicated
July 21 — One former presi
dent paid tribute to another as

Gerald Ford formally dedicated
the Herbert Hoover Federal
Memorial Building in a cere
mony on the steps of Hoover
Tower. The five-story building,
which houses offices, the arc
hives and special collections of
the Hoover Institution Press, is
the latest addition to the In
stitution, founded by Hoover
in 1919.
As president, Ford has
signed legislation three years
ago designating the memorial
and approving federal funding
for the new building. It is the
nation's sole memorial to
Hoover.
Oregon Senator and Stan
ford alumnus Mark Hatfield,
who introduced the Hoover
Memorial bill in Congress, also
spoke in appreciation of
Hoover's life and accomplish
ments. The audience of over
1000 included former Califor
nia Gov. Ronald Reagan,
former Secretary of the Treas
ury William Simon and Shirley
Temple Black.
Hospital accredited
July 31 — The Stanford Hospi
tal received full two-year ac
creditation from the Joint
Committee on Accreditation of
Hospitals (JCAH), indicating
that significant progress had
been made towards the correc
tion of deficiencies cited in
previous JCAH reports.
The decision, which fol
lowed three consecutive one
year accreditations, was based
on a survey conducted by
members of the JCAH, the
California Department of
Health, and the California
Medical Association.
Libel suit
filed
AugustB — A 53.75 million libel
suit was filed against Art His
tory Prof. Albert Elsen, one of
the world's leading experts on
French sculptor Auguste Ro
din.
The suit, filed in Santa Clara
County superior court by
George Schattle of Menlo Park,
concerns four sculptures
owned by Schattle, which
Elsen determined were defi
nitely not by Rodin.

Schattle claims that Elsen's
public comments about the
sculptures libeled him and
prevented him from selling the
pieces.
Elsen allegedly wrote a letter
to KGO-TV newsman Jerry Jen
sen, in which he claimed that
Schattle and another man were
"trying to con unsuspecting
businessmen into buying four
reputedly unique Rodin
sculptures" which were actu
ally "outright fakes."
Lyman reviews
trip
August 10 — Back from a 12-day
trip to South Africa, President
Richard Lyman told an alumni
symposium that "my opinion
has not greatly changed about
what we can and should do"
regarding the role of the Un
ited States in that country.
Lyman had attended a multi
racial, multinational confer
ence on the future of South Af
rica, co-sponsored by the
World Peace Foundation of
Boston and the South African
Institute of International Af
fairs.

Lyman said that those at the
conference "discussed a lot of
options, and came to agree
ment on none/' and that he
personally "doesn't see a way
out that shows a great deal of
promise."
He spoke out most strongly
against the South African mig
ratory labor policy, which re
quires that black African males
be transported from theirtribal
homelands to urban work
camps.
"Urban blacks are the rock
on which the government
keeps stumbling," said Lyman.
"They have become so integ
rated into the South African
economy they cannot be ex
truded while to give them full
political rights means turning
over the country to a black
majority."
Lyman visited Pretoria,
Johannesburg (including a trip
to Soweto), the Transkei, King
Williams Town and Capetown.
He concluded that while "sup
erficially" there appeared to be
"a large number of people liv
ing a free life ... if there is a
South African that feels en
tirely free, I didn't meet him."

President Richard Lyman re
turned from a 12-day trip to
South Africa and said that his
"opinion has not greatly
changed about what we can
and should do" in that coun

Secretary of the Treasury Wil

Hoover Tower for the dedica
tion of the Herbert Hoover
Federal Memorial Building . . .
the Stanford Hospital averted a
strike by registered nurses with
a new two-year contract. . .
Events sure to influence the
course of campus affairs occur
red with regularity, and long
standing issues took new
shapes and directions. What
follows is an overview of what
happened while you were
gone.
Medical Center
denied funds
June 30 — The California Sup
reme Court refused to review a
lower court decision which
had held it unconstitutional for
the state to pay the University
for expanding its enrollment.
That move cost the University
$448,000 in state funds.
In 1973 Stanford agreed to
increase its Medical School en
rollment in return for more
state funds. However, during
the 1975-76 school year the
state controller's office de
cided the payments were il
legal and refused to continue
the funding. The Court of Ap
peals agreed with the control
ler's decision.
Officials respond to
Bakke decision
June 30 — Most campus ad
ministrators reacted optimisti
cally to a Supreme Court deci

sion ordering a University of
California Medical School to
admit Allan Bakke on the
grounds that he had been a vic
tim of discrimination. Al
though Stanford, along with
Columbia, Harvard, and the
University of Pennsylvania,
had filed an amicus curiae brief
supporting the U.C. Davis
Medical School admissions
program, the decision abolish
ing quota systems prompted
fewer loud disagreements than
many had expected.
Law Prof. Gerald Cunther
said that "Bakke had won —
but so have most minority ad
missions programs in use in
America's colleges and
graduate schools."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon noted that "while
ruling out quotas, which Stan
ford has not used, it apparently
allows us to continue to take
the background of students
into consideration in our at
tempts to bring together a stu
dent body," Hargadon added
that Stanford's enrollment of
blacks, Chicanos, and native
Americans at the under
graduate level reached a re
cord high last year.
Maria Baeza, assistant to the
president for Chicano affairs,

said the distinction drawn bet
ween quota systt ms and other
methods of takin »race into ac
count should en< ure that Stan
ford's policies will be mini
mally affected.
Black Media Ir stitute Direc
tor William Strcud said that
while many p< rsons were
"shocked" by the decision, it
apparently "leaves the door
open for affirmative action."
Nurses OK contract
July 7 — Registered nurses at
the Stanford Hoipital reached
final agreement on a two-year
contract with hospital adminis
trators.
The nurses, represented by
CRONA (Committee for Rec
ognition of Nur; ing Achieve
ments), settled on a contract
providing for a seven percent
wage increase fo the first year
and an addition.il adjustment
of equal size in 1980.
