# Ill-tempered chimpanzees replaced
## Study to understand human behavior continues 
### EMILY SACHAR 
Noisy chimps. Quiet
chimps. Friendly chimps. Shy
chimps. Chimps as varied in
their personalities as human
beings. Chimps that are, in
fact, quite similar to human be
ings — which is why for four
years, humans here have
studied chimps to learn more
about people.
But a combination of cir
cumstances from politics in Af
rica to practical difficulties
working with the chimps has
forced the only program of its
kind to shut its doors. The
Stanford Outdoor Primate
Facility will be housed with 40
animals of a newbreed, Rhesus
macaque monkeys.

These new monks will be
subjects for the same kind of
research on social behavior
and development that has
been underway with the
chimps. Researchers will be
looking at childrearing trends,
sexual attitudes and social pat
terns of the new monkeys, just
as they did with the chimpan
zees.
Tracing human roots
As conceived, the program
was to trace roots for human
behavior in the actions and at
titudes of the chimps.
"We weren't looking for
some miracle discovery, like
the cure for cancer would be,"
said Christopher Coe, field di
rector of the primate facility

here.
"But we did find some excit
ing facts that may lead to an
understanding of human be
havior and its evolutionary pat
terns," Coe continued.
"Just as an example, we
found that chimp indepen
dence from the mother is due
to positive reassuring behavior
from the mother, not from re
jection. We also learned that
display behavior, where the
adult male chimp charges
other animals, hair erect, is a
method for communicating
certain dominant social pat
terns within ihe chimp group."
Two-lab concept
To do the research which led
to these insights, two lab sta
tions were established. Pri
mate specialist Jane Coodall
worked at Gombe National
Park in Tanzania while a group
of researchers here manned
the Stanford facility.
Researchers in Tanzania
examined chimps "in their
natural environment and
habitat," according to Coe.
"Then we were able to make
comparisons with the chimps

housed at Stanford. They had
been removed from natural
surroundings."
According to Dr. Seymour
Levine, director of the Stanford
facility, students working here
formed hypotheses about
chimps' actions and their rela
tionships to human behavior.
Theories were then tested in
Tanzania.
African peril
But, three years ago, un
pleasant events occurred at the
African station. In May 1975,
rebel troops from neighboring
Zaire made their way into
Coodall's field research station
and carried off the Stanford
students and researcher work
ing there. The hostages were
held for more than two months
while the rebels demanded
$460,000 ransom, arms, am
munition and the release of
their comrades from Tanzanian
jails. On July 25, 1975, the last
of the captives was released for
a settlement, the terms of
which have never been re
leased.
Following the episode, the
African research facility was

ordered closed by the Tanza
nian government. Only Dr.
Goodall was allowed to re
main.
"Once we lost the natural
field as a backdrop for our
studies, we lost at least half of
the project," Coe said.
Still more problems
The concept for the research
changed dramatically after the
incident, according to Levine.
Work continued, but many dif
ficulties with the chimps
further complicated the situa
tion.
"Handling a 150 pound
chimp is difficult. Some are
quite strong and temperamen
tal. Drawing the necessary
blood for hormone tests was
sometimes next to impossi
ble," Coe said.
"Also, the individual differ
ences between chimps made
our work very difficult. Draw
ing generalizations on the
species as a whole can be quite
hard, when you're working
with only 15 chimps," Coe
said.
Hopes that the chimp popu
lation would expand rapidly

were dashed when one of the
six adult females delivered a
stillborn baby this year and
another suffered pregnancy
complications. The chimp
population never expanded at
the necessary rate, Coe said.
Rhesus monks won't present
these problems, researchers
hope. They are small, seldom
exceeding two pounds each.
They can produce four babies
in the time a chimp bears a
single infant.
Departing sorrov>
But, even if the monks will
be easier to work with, resear
chers appear glum over losing
the chimps.
"We're losing the intelli
gence of the chimp and we're

losing the personalities that
have made the research fun,"
Coe said.
Also, the macaque is a more
distant relative to man than is
the chimpanzee. As a result,
drawing comparisons between
monks and humans may be
even more difficult.
But, researchers plan to con
tinue mainly the same kind of
work that h.is been underway
for the | .1 few years. The four
people hi,inning the primate
faiclity will still take check
sheets and pens in hand, exa
mining mother and child,
drawing blood samples and
checking social interaction —
continuing the search to find
the roots of human behavior.


Our ancestors protect their young, just as we humans do. Mother
chimps play with the infants, hold them and transport them around
the primate facility.


Chimps use ladders like the one at right to climb to napping boxes atop the cage. Tires and other toys are
scattered throughout the enclosure. Chimps are also free to roam about on dry land.

Love the one you're with, says an old Beatles tune. This male chimp
agrees, resting to hug himself before continuing the day's activities.
