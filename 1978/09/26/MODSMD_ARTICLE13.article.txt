# James seeking big play in man-to-man coverage
## 
### Alicia Kent Staff writer 
With the Stanford student
body and football faithful return
ing to campus this week, the Car
dinal football team is looking for
its first win of the season in
today's game against San Jose
State.
Now 0-2 on the year (0-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play), the
Cardinal hopes to score often
enough against the aggressive
Spartan defensive squad to coun
tervail the offensive firepower of
San Jose State quarterback Mike
Perez.
Wide receiver Jeff James will
be a key to that offensive effort.
Because San Jose State, using
the 46 defensive set made
popular by the Chicago Bears of
the NFL, places more of its
defense up front as linebackers to
put pressure on the quarterback
with blitzes, James will be
guarded by only one Spartan de
fensive back instead of attracting
the double-team attention he
usually gets.
"It will be a challenge between
the defensive back and me," said
James, a fifth-year senior from
Beverly Hills.
Although the Spartans' blitzing
linebacker corps may be a bit
daunting to Cardinal quarterback
Greg Fnnis. it will give James a
chance to get open downfield and
add to his career totals of 122 re
ceptions, 1,799 yards and 14
touchdowns.
According to James, a Stan
ford veteran starting his fourth
year of play after redshirting his
freshman year, the Cardinal's
success will hinge on whether
"the back line (of blockers) can
pick up the blitz and give the
quarterback time."
If Knnis gets time to throw,
he'll likely find James open.
"1 pride myself on getting open
all the time," said the 6-foot, 185-
pound James. "Theoretically, 1
should get open all the time, and
I'm not satisfied (with myself)
unless I am."
High expectations like this
have won James accolades from
the media and his coaches and
respect from his opponents. A
Second-Team All-Pac-10 selec
tion and Honorable Mention All-
America last year, James was
third in the Pac-10 in receiving
with 52 catches.

In addition, going into this year
he had a remarkable streak of
catching at least one pass in each
of the last 21 Stanford games.
That made James "the man to
isolate" in the season opener
Sept. 5 at Washington, according
to Husky Coach Don James.
The special attention the
Washington secondary lavished
on him was flattering for James,
hut made life difficult. He failed
to catch any passes, ending the
two-season-long streak.
"Actually, I wasn't aware of
it." James said of the reception
streak. "I expect to catch halls
each game. When it ends you
notice it. It was frustrating. I
should have got open more."
James had better luck last Sat
urday against Colorado, pulling
in five passes for 50 yards, in
cluding a seven-yard touchdown

reception. Although the Cardinal
suffered its second loss of the
year. James called the Colorado
contest "a relatively good
game."
But the bruised hip bone that
James suffered in the 31-17 loss
to the Buffaloes wasn't even
relatively good. It was downright
bad. forcing him to sit out several
practices this week.
He is optimistic that the injury
won't hamper his play in today's
game, however.
"Hopefully my hip won't
bother me," he said. "It's the
kind of thing I expect to get bet
ter. I don't want it to interfere
with my play."
James hopes that today's home
game will give the Cardinal a
chance to redeem itself."We
want to prove that we are not as
bad as we looked (in the last two

games)," James said. " Now we
have a couple of games under our
belt and the new young guys are
getting settled."
After playing with former
quarterback John Paye for three
seasons and working with him
year-round during that time, this
year James has had to adjust to
Ennis, the new starting quarter
back. The adjustments, however,
have been minor.
"The offense is just a system.
As long as the ball is coming to
me, I can do my part in the sys
tem. Greg (Ennis) is learning it
(the system)," James said.
James says that the Cardinal is
not only ready to win, but has the
ability to win: "San Jose State is
a good, talented team, but it is
our turn to win. There is a fire in
the guys' hearts because this is
one we need to win."

And there seemingly has al
ways been a fire in James' heart
when it comes to playing foot
ball. "I put a lot of pressure on
myself," he said. "When I'm not
playing (football), I'm watching
it, reading it, or thinking about
it."
James' immediate goals in
clude improving last year's
record of 8-4. After this season,
his last, James will be glad to
graduate. "I hope to play pro
football, but it's hard to say; it's
an uncertain profession," said
James, an economics major who
plans to finish his last two eco
nomics classes either this quarter
or in the winter.
"If things don't happen, there
are things 1 can do. But it's hard
because 1 haven't really had a
job. Football and sports have
been my job," James said.

streak. "I expect to catch halls
each game. When it ends you
notice it. It was frustrating. I
should have got open more."
James had better luck last Sat
urday against Colorado, pulling
in five passes for 50 yards, in
cluding a seven-yard touchdown

reception. Although the Cardinal
suffered its second loss of the
year. James called the Colorado
contest "a relatively good
game."
But the bruised hip bone that
James suffered in the 31-17 loss
to the Buffaloes wasn't even
relatively good. It was downright
bad. forcing him to sit out several
practices this week.
He is optimistic that the injury
won't hamper his play in today's
game, however.
"Hopefully my hip won't
bother me," he said. "It's the
kind of thing I expect to get bet
ter. I don't want it to interfere
with my play."
James hopes that today's home
game will give the Cardinal a
chance to redeem itself."We
want to prove that we are not as
bad as we looked (in the last two

games)," James said. " Now we
have a couple of games under our
belt and the new young guys are
getting settled."
After playing with former
quarterback John Paye for three
seasons and working with him
year-round during that time, this
year James has had to adjust to
Ennis, the new starting quarter
back. The adjustments, however,
have been minor.
"The offense is just a system.
As long as the ball is coming to
me, I can do my part in the sys
tem. Greg (Ennis) is learning it
(the system)," James said.
James says that the Cardinal is
not only ready to win, but has the
ability to win: "San Jose State is
a good, talented team, but it is
our turn to win. There is a fire in
the guys' hearts because this is
one we need to win."

And there seemingly has al
ways been a fire in James' heart
when it comes to playing foot
ball. "I put a lot of pressure on
myself," he said. "When I'm not
playing (football), I'm watching
it, reading it, or thinking about
it."
James' immediate goals in
clude improving last year's
record of 8-4. After this season,
his last, James will be glad to
graduate. "I hope to play pro
football, but it's hard to say; it's
an uncertain profession," said
James, an economics major who
plans to finish his last two eco
nomics classes either this quarter
or in the winter.
"If things don't happen, there
are things 1 can do. But it's hard
because 1 haven't really had a
job. Football and sports have
been my job," James said.

can move into sixth place on the Stanford all-time career receiving list
with seven catches todav.
With the Stanford student
body and football faithful return
ing to campus this week, the Car
dinal football team is looking for
its first win of the season in
today's game against San Jose
State.
Now 0-2 on the year (0-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play), the
Cardinal hopes to score often
enough against the aggressive
Spartan defensive squad to coun
tervail the offensive firepower of
San Jose State quarterback Mike
Perez.
Wide receiver Jeff James will
be a key to that offensive effort.
Because San Jose State, using
the 46 defensive set made
popular by the Chicago Bears of
the NFL, places more of its
defense up front as linebackers to
put pressure on the quarterback
with blitzes, James will be
guarded by only one Spartan de
fensive back instead of attracting
the double-team attention he
usually gets.
"It will be a challenge between
the defensive back and me," said
James, a fifth-year senior from
Beverly Hills.
Although the Spartans' blitzing
linebacker corps may be a bit
daunting to Cardinal quarterback
Greg Fnnis. it will give James a
chance to get open downfield and
add to his career totals of 122 re
ceptions, 1,799 yards and 14
touchdowns.
According to James, a Stan
ford veteran starting his fourth
year of play after redshirting his
freshman year, the Cardinal's
success will hinge on whether
"the back line (of blockers) can
pick up the blitz and give the
quarterback time."
If Knnis gets time to throw,
he'll likely find James open.
"1 pride myself on getting open
all the time," said the 6-foot, 185-
pound James. "Theoretically, 1
should get open all the time, and
I'm not satisfied (with myself)
unless I am."
High expectations like this
have won James accolades from
the media and his coaches and
respect from his opponents. A
Second-Team All-Pac-10 selec
tion and Honorable Mention All-
America last year, James was
third in the Pac-10 in receiving
with 52 catches.

In addition, going into this year
he had a remarkable streak of
catching at least one pass in each
of the last 21 Stanford games.
That made James "the man to
isolate" in the season opener
Sept. 5 at Washington, according
to Husky Coach Don James.
The special attention the
Washington secondary lavished
on him was flattering for James,
hut made life difficult. He failed
to catch any passes, ending the
two-season-long streak.
"Actually, I wasn't aware of
it." James said of the reception
streak. "I expect to catch halls
each game. When it ends you
notice it. It was frustrating. I
should have got open more."
