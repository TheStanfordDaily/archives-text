# Pac-10 looks to be nation's toughest conference
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Last year, any and all doubts
about which college football con
ference is the strongest in the
country were laid to rest. Unfor
tunately, the now-undisputed
champion of NFL farm team
leagues is the division in which
Stanford has to compete.
That automatically gives the
Cardinal one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. Even
Washington State and Oregon
State (teams which perenially
complain about how difficult it is

to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) aren't certain wins. And
last-place California managed to
win two games last year — sadly
for Stanford, one of those wins
came in Big Game.
The Pac-10 sent a record six
teams to postseason play last
year, and four teams — UCLA,
Washington, Arizona State and
USC — have already been
ranked in the top 20 in wire ser
vice polls this season.
After three weeks of play,
here's a look at Stanford's com
petition in this powerhouse
league:

UCLA
The Bruins tied for second in
the conference last season, hut
this year almost everyone is
favoring the men in powder blue
and gold to wind up in their own
home stadium come New Year's
Day.
UCLA has history on its side.
Terry Donahue's squad earned
bowl game victories in each of
the last five years and won the
Pac-10 title, and subsequently
the Rose Bowl, three times
during that span.
Frighteningly, this year's
vintage of the Bruins may be bet

ter than any UCLA unit in those
five years. Led by their Heisman
Trophy-hopeful running back
Gaston Green, the Bruins are
loaded with talent, especially in
the backfield and on defense.
Green led the league in rushing
last year, averaging 113.9 yards
per game, and scored 17 touch
downs. The tailback ran for three
touchdowns and set a major
college bowl record by chalking
up 266 yards on the ground in
UCLA's 31-10 win over BYU in
the Freedom Bowl.
But the senior had a string of
eight consecutive 100-yard rush
ing games snapped in the Bruins'
second game of the 1987 season,
tallying just 46 yards in a 42-33
loss to No. 2 Nebraska.
As if Green wasn't enough, the
Bruins also have junior running
back Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl Player of the Game, back
from injuries to join fullbacks
James Primus and Mel Farr in a
formidable stable of backs.
Quarterback Troy Aikman, a
transfer from Oklahoma, will
have the pleasure of handing the
ball off to his large, speedy backs
and also will have the opportu
nity to throw to senior receivers
Willie "Flipper"' Anderson and
Paco Craig. In his First two starts,
Aikman has averaged nearly 2(H)
yards passing a game and has
not been intercepted: however,
he has yet to throw a touchdown
pass.
The offensive line is young,
with only tackle John Kidder
back. SMU transfer David Ric
hards should play a key role at
tackle, while senior Doug Wassel
moves from the defensive line to
center.
The defensive line is led by
All-Pac-10 nose guard Terry
Tumey and senior tackle Jim
Wahler. Overall, the defense
returns seven starters, including
leading tackier Ken Norton Jr. at
inside linebacker and junior cor
nerback Darryl Henley, who will
also return punts and kicks. Spe
cial teams should be solid, with
sophomore kicker Alfredo
Velasco and junior punter Harold
Barkate.
Washington
Off to a good start with a
league win over Stanford already
in their pocket, the Huskies also
have a non-conference win over
Purdue to go with a loss to Texas
A & M. Senior quarterback Chris
Chandler is another Heisman
candidate, as he demonstrated in
winning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for his 314-yard
passing performance against the
Cardinal three weeks ago. For
the season, Chandler has over
6(H) yards passing and four touch
down tosses.
Most of those passes have
been directed to senior Darryl
Franklin, who had eight recep
tions for 209 yards against Stan
ford, and junior Brian Slater.
Tailback Vince Weathersby is
also a threat coming out of the
backfield. Other backs include
Steve Jones and fullbacks Tony
Covington and Aaron Jenkins.
The very large men protecting
Chandler and opening up holes
for the backs were plagued by in
juries last year. Still, the offen
sive line is bigger than the line of
that other Seattle football team,
the Seahawks. Junior guards
Brett Wiese and Mike Zandofsky
anchor the line.
The defensive line has been
more of a concern for head coach
Don James, as all of last year's
line, including Ail-American
tackle Reggie Rogers, graduated.
The linebacking corps — led by
David Rill. Tom Frlandson and
Bo Yates — is superb. The sec
ondary features numerous veter
ans including Tony Zachery, Art
Malone and Darryl Hall.
Bandy Brownlee, another
SMU transfer, is softening the
sting ol the the graduation of
kicker Jeff Jaeger, the Huskies'
all-time leading scorer.

Brownlee connected on three
field goals against Stanford and
has not missed an extra point at
tempt this year.
Arizona State
The Sun Devils are the defend
ing Rose Bowl champions and
will likely make another run for
the roses, if for no other reason
than the ease of their schedule.
ASU not only doesn't play
Stanford or USC, it also does
play all the patsies of the Pac-10
— Oregon, Oregon State and
California. The Sun Devils have
already licked one cupcake,
Pacific, 31-10. beaten up on Illi
nois. one of the least frightening
of the Big Ten teams, and they're
probably less than apprehensive
about the prospect of taking on
Western Athletic Conference
doormat Texas-El Paso later in
the year.
The only real football schools
on the ASU agenda this year are
UCLA. Nebraska and arch-rival
Arizona. The Devils could just
slide their way right to Pasadena
without much difficulty.
But Coach John Cooper's team
returns just 11 members from last
year, and there are many un
answered questions. The first is
at quarterback. Junior Dan Ford
seems to be holding down the
spot vacated by Jeff Van Raap
horst, but Paul Justin and John
Walker may also see action.
There's no cause for concern
in the backfield, though. Darryl
Harris and Channing Williams
combined for 18 TDs last year,
and AII-Pac-10 split end Aaron
Cox also returns after leading the
conference in reception yardage.
The other receiver spot and the
tight end spot are up for grabs.
Todd Kalis and All-American
Randall Me Daniel are the best
pair of guards in the nation, but
the rest of the offensive line is in
experienced. The only returnee
on the defensive line is Shawn
Patterson, but linebackers Greg
Clark and Stacy Harvey are back
at the inside linebacker posts.
The defensive backs are in good
shape, with Anthony Parker,
Eric Allen and Jeff Joseph.
Kicker Kent Bostrum and punter
Mike Schuh give the Devils a
strong kicking game.
Ari/.ona
The Wildcats were the only
team to beat Arizona State last
year, but that should come as no
surprise: Arizona has a particular
fondness for beating up on its
Tempe enemy.
The Cats could be hard
pressed to win their version of
the Big Game this year, though.
Most of last season's offense is
gone, including the second
leading passer (Alfred Jenkins)
and the second-leading receiver
(Jon Horton) in Arizona history.
Also departed is AII-Pac-10 tail
back David Adams.
Another of those much
coveted SMU transfers may have
won the job at quarterback. Bob
Watters, the Mustang starter last
year, tossed two first half touch
downs against New Mexico
before leaving with a bruised hip.
There is some depth at tailback
and receiver, with backs Art
Greathouse, David Eldridge and
Charles Webb, and flankers
Derek Hill and Jeff Fairholm.
The offensive line, anchored
by center Joe Tofflemire, is a def
inite strength. The only non-
Wildcat veteran on the line is
Kevin McKinney, a transfer
from — you guessed it — SMU.
Another Mustang-turned-
Wildcat, Toby Watts, may join a
defensive line that consists of
veterans George Hinkle, Dana
Wells and Reggie Gaddis.
Although Boomer Gibson
resumes his place at outside
linebacker, Arizona still has to
find a replacement for 19K6 Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Byron Evans. The Singleton
twins, Chris and Kevin, may mir
