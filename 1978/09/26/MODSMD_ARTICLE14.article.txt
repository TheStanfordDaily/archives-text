# Pac-10 looks to be nation's toughest conference
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Last year, any and all doubts
about which college football con
ference is the strongest in the
country were laid to rest. Unfor
tunately, the now-undisputed
champion of NFL farm team
leagues is the division in which
Stanford has to compete.
That automatically gives the
Cardinal one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. Even
Washington State and Oregon
State (teams which perenially
complain about how difficult it is

to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) aren't certain wins. And
last-place California managed to
win two games last year — sadly
for Stanford, one of those wins
came in Big Game.
The Pac-10 sent a record six
teams to postseason play last
year, and four teams — UCLA,
Washington, Arizona State and
USC — have already been
ranked in the top 20 in wire ser
vice polls this season.
After three weeks of play,
here's a look at Stanford's com
petition in this powerhouse
league:

UCLA
The Bruins tied for second in
the conference last season, hut
this year almost everyone is
favoring the men in powder blue
and gold to wind up in their own
home stadium come New Year's
Day.
UCLA has history on its side.
Terry Donahue's squad earned
bowl game victories in each of
the last five years and won the
Pac-10 title, and subsequently
the Rose Bowl, three times
during that span.
Frighteningly, this year's
vintage of the Bruins may be bet

ter than any UCLA unit in those
five years. Led by their Heisman
Trophy-hopeful running back
Gaston Green, the Bruins are
loaded with talent, especially in
the backfield and on defense.
Green led the league in rushing
last year, averaging 113.9 yards
per game, and scored 17 touch
downs. The tailback ran for three
touchdowns and set a major
college bowl record by chalking
up 266 yards on the ground in
UCLA's 31-10 win over BYU in
the Freedom Bowl.
But the senior had a string of
eight consecutive 100-yard rush
ing games snapped in the Bruins'
second game of the 1987 season,
tallying just 46 yards in a 42-33
loss to No. 2 Nebraska.
As if Green wasn't enough, the
Bruins also have junior running
back Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl Player of the Game, back
from injuries to join fullbacks
James Primus and Mel Farr in a
formidable stable of backs.
Quarterback Troy Aikman, a
transfer from Oklahoma, will
have the pleasure of handing the
ball off to his large, speedy backs
and also will have the opportu
nity to throw to senior receivers
Willie "Flipper"' Anderson and
Paco Craig. In his First two starts,
Aikman has averaged nearly 2(H)
yards passing a game and has
not been intercepted: however,
he has yet to throw a touchdown
pass.
The offensive line is young,
with only tackle John Kidder
back. SMU transfer David Ric
hards should play a key role at
tackle, while senior Doug Wassel
moves from the defensive line to
center.
The defensive line is led by
All-Pac-10 nose guard Terry
Tumey and senior tackle Jim
Wahler. Overall, the defense
returns seven starters, including
leading tackier Ken Norton Jr. at
inside linebacker and junior cor
nerback Darryl Henley, who will
also return punts and kicks. Spe
cial teams should be solid, with
sophomore kicker Alfredo
Velasco and junior punter Harold
Barkate.
Washington
Off to a good start with a
league win over Stanford already
in their pocket, the Huskies also
have a non-conference win over
Purdue to go with a loss to Texas
A & M. Senior quarterback Chris
Chandler is another Heisman
candidate, as he demonstrated in
winning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for his 314-yard
passing performance against the
Cardinal three weeks ago. For
the season, Chandler has over
6(H) yards passing and four touch
down tosses.
Most of those passes have
been directed to senior Darryl
Franklin, who had eight recep
tions for 209 yards against Stan
ford, and junior Brian Slater.
Tailback Vince Weathersby is
also a threat coming out of the
backfield. Other backs include
Steve Jones and fullbacks Tony
Covington and Aaron Jenkins.
The very large men protecting
Chandler and opening up holes
for the backs were plagued by in
juries last year. Still, the offen
sive line is bigger than the line of
that other Seattle football team,
the Seahawks. Junior guards
Brett Wiese and Mike Zandofsky
anchor the line.
The defensive line has been
more of a concern for head coach
Don James, as all of last year's
line, including Ail-American
tackle Reggie Rogers, graduated.
The linebacking corps — led by
David Rill. Tom Frlandson and
Bo Yates — is superb. The sec
ondary features numerous veter
ans including Tony Zachery, Art
Malone and Darryl Hall.
Bandy Brownlee, another
SMU transfer, is softening the
sting ol the the graduation of
kicker Jeff Jaeger, the Huskies'
all-time leading scorer.

Brownlee connected on three
field goals against Stanford and
has not missed an extra point at
tempt this year.
Arizona State
The Sun Devils are the defend
ing Rose Bowl champions and
will likely make another run for
the roses, if for no other reason
than the ease of their schedule.
ASU not only doesn't play
Stanford or USC, it also does
play all the patsies of the Pac-10
— Oregon, Oregon State and
California. The Sun Devils have
already licked one cupcake,
Pacific, 31-10. beaten up on Illi
nois. one of the least frightening
of the Big Ten teams, and they're
probably less than apprehensive
about the prospect of taking on
Western Athletic Conference
doormat Texas-El Paso later in
the year.
The only real football schools
on the ASU agenda this year are
UCLA. Nebraska and arch-rival
Arizona. The Devils could just
slide their way right to Pasadena
without much difficulty.
But Coach John Cooper's team
returns just 11 members from last
year, and there are many un
answered questions. The first is
at quarterback. Junior Dan Ford
seems to be holding down the
spot vacated by Jeff Van Raap
horst, but Paul Justin and John
Walker may also see action.
There's no cause for concern
in the backfield, though. Darryl
Harris and Channing Williams
combined for 18 TDs last year,
and AII-Pac-10 split end Aaron
Cox also returns after leading the
conference in reception yardage.
The other receiver spot and the
tight end spot are up for grabs.
Todd Kalis and All-American
Randall Me Daniel are the best
pair of guards in the nation, but
the rest of the offensive line is in
experienced. The only returnee
on the defensive line is Shawn
Patterson, but linebackers Greg
Clark and Stacy Harvey are back
at the inside linebacker posts.
The defensive backs are in good
shape, with Anthony Parker,
Eric Allen and Jeff Joseph.
Kicker Kent Bostrum and punter
Mike Schuh give the Devils a
strong kicking game.
Ari/.ona
The Wildcats were the only
team to beat Arizona State last
year, but that should come as no
surprise: Arizona has a particular
fondness for beating up on its
Tempe enemy.
The Cats could be hard
pressed to win their version of
the Big Game this year, though.
Most of last season's offense is
gone, including the second
leading passer (Alfred Jenkins)
and the second-leading receiver
(Jon Horton) in Arizona history.
Also departed is AII-Pac-10 tail
back David Adams.
Another of those much
coveted SMU transfers may have
won the job at quarterback. Bob
Watters, the Mustang starter last
year, tossed two first half touch
downs against New Mexico
before leaving with a bruised hip.
There is some depth at tailback
and receiver, with backs Art
Greathouse, David Eldridge and
Charles Webb, and flankers
Derek Hill and Jeff Fairholm.
The offensive line, anchored
by center Joe Tofflemire, is a def
inite strength. The only non-
Wildcat veteran on the line is
Kevin McKinney, a transfer
from — you guessed it — SMU.
Another Mustang-turned-
Wildcat, Toby Watts, may join a
defensive line that consists of
veterans George Hinkle, Dana
Wells and Reggie Gaddis.
Although Boomer Gibson
resumes his place at outside
linebacker, Arizona still has to
find a replacement for 19K6 Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Byron Evans. The Singleton
twins, Chris and Kevin, may mir

ror each other at the other
outside spot, while Blake Custer
and Jerry Beasley are a good bet
to nail down the inside lineback
ing duties.
All-Pac-10 safety Chuck Cecil,
the man who returned an inter
ception MX) yards against ASU
last year, is the star of the
defense. Eugene Hardy and

James Deßow also bolster the
secondary.
Kicker Gary Costen led the
Pac-10 and was second in the na
tion in field goals last year as a
freshman. New head coach Dick
Tomey likes junior Brett Holley
at punter.
IJSC
Former Arizona coach Larry
Smith moves over a few states to
take over the reins of the Trojan
horses, and he might be in for a
rough first year.
To begin with, there's the

schedule USC has already
beaten Boston College, but lost
to Michigan State and still has to
face Notre Dame and every Pac
-10 school except ASU.
The good news is that USC has
14 starters back. The bad news is
that this is a team that lost to
Washington State last year, and
didn't come up with many big
wins apart from a victory over
Washington.
Multi-talented quarterback
Rodney Peete, who took some
time off from spring ball to field
grounders as the shortstop of the

Trojan baseball team, is a threat
both running and passing. Peete,
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Week last week for his perform
ance against Boston College, has
some quality receivers to throw
to, including split end Ken Henry
and flanker Randy Tanner, both
of whom are dangerous with the
ball.
Paul Green will be the tight
end. Tailback Ryan Knight has
been (JSC's leading rusher the
past two seasons, and sopho
more Leroy Holt is at fullback.
Jeff Brecel is now with the

49ers, hut three other starters are
back on the offensive line, in
cluding senior tackle Dave
Cadigan. On the other side of the
hall, tackle Tim Ryan, a Fresh
man All-American last year, and
nose guard Dan Owens are
proven performers.
The USC linebackers, led by
All-Pac-I() selection Marcus Cot
ton, are an outstanding unit.
Three members of the secondary
departed, but a number of
prospects will be ready to step in.
Freshman Quin Rodriguez has won the kicking job,
and incumbent punter Chris Sperle returns.
Oregon
For the second straight year, the Ducks upset
Colorado and thereby served notice that Oregon
may once again reign supreme . , . among the Bot
tom Four, the group of schools which perenially
bring up the rear in the Pac-10. (Sometimes —
when Stanford has a bad year — this group
becomes the Bottom Five.)
Oregon has one of the hardest schedules in the
nation (facing 1986 bowl teams in seven of its first
eight games) and no longer has All-Pac-10 quarter
back Chris Miller. But the defense, which gave up a
whopping 30 points a game last year, surrendered
just one touchdown to the Colorado wishbone and
forced five turnovers, while the offense, led by red
shirt freshman Bill Musgrave, managed to outscore
the Buffaloes by a field goal, 10-7.
The key for Rich Brooks' squad will be the
defense, which is switching from the 4-3 "flex" set
to the more common 3-4 alignment. Nose tackle
Rollin Putzier will be the key to stopping the run —
something Oregon failed to do against Colorado,
which rolled up 2% yards on the ground. Only one
veteran, Anthony Newman, returns to the second
ary, but the Duck defense held the Buffaloes to just
87 yards passing.
Washington State
Coach Jim Walden has gone to lowa State, and
new coach Dennis Erickson inherits an enigma:
The Cougars beat USC and tied ASU last year, but
lost to California, Oregon and Oregon State.
This season, WSU is 2-1, having defeated peren
nially strong Fresno State and tough Wyoming, and
falling only to powerful Michigan. The Cougars are
scoring at a rate of 42 points per game — a pretty
impressive showing from a team that finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year.
I he C ougar attack looks balanced, averaging
over 200 yards a game passing and nearly that
much rushing. Sophomore signal caller Timm
Rosenbach can throw to receivers Tim Stallworth
and Victor Wood or hand off to running backs
Steve Broussard and Richard Calvin, who has been
a pleasant surprise while leading the Cougars in
rushing.
Three starters return to the offensive line.
The Cougars' weakness is defense. The unit gave
up 423.5 yards per game last year and is around that
mark in the first two games of this season. Six
starters are back, including outstanding senior
linebacker Brian Forde. The secondary is the big
gest concern, with just Shawn Landrum returning.
Fresno State and Wyoming piled up nearly 3(H)
passing yards apiece against the WSU coverage.
Oregon State
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has been touting the
Beavers' self-styled "Air Express" offense for
three years now, and this year Oregon State may
even have a defense to go with the powerful offense
that led the Pac-10 in passing last season.
Junior quarterback Erik Wilhelm threw for 353
yards in a 41-7 loss to Georgia in the team's opener,
but on the ground, the team looked like Beavers
out of water, gaining just 18 yards on 14 carries
against a top-notch Bulldog defense. Last week,
Wilhelm threw two TD passes in leading OSU over
San Jose State, breaking the Spartans' 11-game
winning streak.
Watch for Wilhelm to connect with tight end Phil
Ross and receiver Robb Thomas. Trey Nicholson

Brian Taylor and Eric Montgomery are in the back
field, and the offensive line, led by senior center
Dave Orndorff, should be fairly solid.
Defensively, the Beavers are improved, with
eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.
Sophomore Troy Taylor, who has seven TD
passes to his credit already this season (two more
than Bear quarterbacks had all last season) looks
like the California quarterback for the next few
years. Running back Chris Richards has run for
over 100 yards in all three games. Former quarter
back Brian Bedford has 16 receptions, and sopho
more Mike Ford has a lot of speed at receiver.
The major problem for the Bear offense is the
line, which has three men back but not much talent
or depth.
Noseguard Majett Whiteside is Cal's most
talented player, and the defensive line could be the
best unit on the team. Ken Harvey is an excellent
linebacker, and David Ortega also returns at an
inside linebacker spot. The secondary has two men
back, but after giving up 421 yards passing to San
Jose State, it is clearly still a concern.

II Stanford quarterback (,reg hnnis can j»et good protection from his offensive line today, he should find receivers open
downfield against the Spartans' man-to-man defense.
Last year, any and all doubts

ference is the strongest in the
country were laid to rest. Unfor

eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.
Sophomore Troy Taylor, who has seven TD
passes to his credit already this season (two more
than Bear quarterbacks had all last season) looks
like the California quarterback for the next few
years. Running back Chris Richards has run for
over 100 yards in all three games. Former quarter
back Brian Bedford has 16 receptions, and sopho
more Mike Ford has a lot of speed at receiver.
The major problem for the Bear offense is the
line, which has three men back but not much talent
or depth.
Noseguard Majett Whiteside is Cal's most
talented player, and the defensive line could be the
best unit on the team. Ken Harvey is an excellent
linebacker, and David Ortega also returns at an
inside linebacker spot. The secondary has two men
back, but after giving up 421 yards passing to San
Jose State, it is clearly still a concern.

II Stanford quarterback (,reg hnnis can j»et good protection from his offensive line today, he should find receivers open
downfield against the Spartans' man-to-man defense.
Last year, any and all doubts
about which college football con
ference is the strongest in the
country were laid to rest. Unfor
tunately, the now-undisputed
champion of NFL farm team
leagues is the division in which
Stanford has to compete.
That automatically gives the
Cardinal one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. Even
Washington State and Oregon
State (teams which perenially
complain about how difficult it is

to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) aren't certain wins. And
last-place California managed to
win two games last year — sadly
for Stanford, one of those wins
came in Big Game.
The Pac-10 sent a record six
teams to postseason play last
year, and four teams — UCLA,
Washington, Arizona State and
USC — have already been
ranked in the top 20 in wire ser
vice polls this season.
After three weeks of play,
here's a look at Stanford's com
petition in this powerhouse
league:

UCLA
The Bruins tied for second in
the conference last season, hut
this year almost everyone is
favoring the men in powder blue
and gold to wind up in their own
home stadium come New Year's
Day.
UCLA has history on its side.
Terry Donahue's squad earned
bowl game victories in each of
the last five years and won the
Pac-10 title, and subsequently
the Rose Bowl, three times
during that span.
Frighteningly, this year's
vintage of the Bruins may be bet

ter than any UCLA unit in those
five years. Led by their Heisman
Trophy-hopeful running back
Gaston Green, the Bruins are
loaded with talent, especially in
the backfield and on defense.
Green led the league in rushing
last year, averaging 113.9 yards
per game, and scored 17 touch
downs. The tailback ran for three
touchdowns and set a major
college bowl record by chalking
up 266 yards on the ground in
UCLA's 31-10 win over BYU in
the Freedom Bowl.
But the senior had a string of
eight consecutive 100-yard rush
ing games snapped in the Bruins'
second game of the 1987 season,
tallying just 46 yards in a 42-33
loss to No. 2 Nebraska.
As if Green wasn't enough, the
Bruins also have junior running
back Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl Player of the Game, back
from injuries to join fullbacks
James Primus and Mel Farr in a
formidable stable of backs.
Quarterback Troy Aikman, a
transfer from Oklahoma, will
have the pleasure of handing the
ball off to his large, speedy backs
and also will have the opportu
nity to throw to senior receivers
Willie "Flipper"' Anderson and
Paco Craig. In his First two starts,
Aikman has averaged nearly 2(H)
yards passing a game and has
not been intercepted: however,
he has yet to throw a touchdown
pass.
The offensive line is young,
with only tackle John Kidder
back. SMU transfer David Ric
hards should play a key role at
tackle, while senior Doug Wassel
moves from the defensive line to
center.
The defensive line is led by
All-Pac-10 nose guard Terry
Tumey and senior tackle Jim
Wahler. Overall, the defense
returns seven starters, including
leading tackier Ken Norton Jr. at
inside linebacker and junior cor
nerback Darryl Henley, who will
also return punts and kicks. Spe
cial teams should be solid, with
sophomore kicker Alfredo
Velasco and junior punter Harold
Barkate.
Washington
Off to a good start with a
league win over Stanford already
in their pocket, the Huskies also
have a non-conference win over
Purdue to go with a loss to Texas
A & M. Senior quarterback Chris
Chandler is another Heisman
candidate, as he demonstrated in
winning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for his 314-yard
passing performance against the
Cardinal three weeks ago. For
the season, Chandler has over
6(H) yards passing and four touch
down tosses.
Most of those passes have
been directed to senior Darryl
Franklin, who had eight recep
tions for 209 yards against Stan
ford, and junior Brian Slater.
Tailback Vince Weathersby is
also a threat coming out of the
backfield. Other backs include
Steve Jones and fullbacks Tony
Covington and Aaron Jenkins.
The very large men protecting
Chandler and opening up holes
for the backs were plagued by in
juries last year. Still, the offen
sive line is bigger than the line of
that other Seattle football team,
the Seahawks. Junior guards
Brett Wiese and Mike Zandofsky
anchor the line.
The defensive line has been
more of a concern for head coach
Don James, as all of last year's
line, including Ail-American
tackle Reggie Rogers, graduated.
The linebacking corps — led by
David Rill. Tom Frlandson and
Bo Yates — is superb. The sec
ondary features numerous veter
ans including Tony Zachery, Art
Malone and Darryl Hall.
Bandy Brownlee, another
SMU transfer, is softening the
sting ol the the graduation of
kicker Jeff Jaeger, the Huskies'
all-time leading scorer.

Brownlee connected on three
field goals against Stanford and
has not missed an extra point at
tempt this year.
Arizona State
The Sun Devils are the defend
ing Rose Bowl champions and
will likely make another run for
the roses, if for no other reason
than the ease of their schedule.
ASU not only doesn't play
Stanford or USC, it also does
play all the patsies of the Pac-10
— Oregon, Oregon State and
California. The Sun Devils have
already licked one cupcake,
Pacific, 31-10. beaten up on Illi
nois. one of the least frightening
of the Big Ten teams, and they're
probably less than apprehensive
about the prospect of taking on
Western Athletic Conference
doormat Texas-El Paso later in
the year.
The only real football schools
on the ASU agenda this year are
UCLA. Nebraska and arch-rival
Arizona. The Devils could just
slide their way right to Pasadena
without much difficulty.
But Coach John Cooper's team
returns just 11 members from last
year, and there are many un
answered questions. The first is
at quarterback. Junior Dan Ford
seems to be holding down the
spot vacated by Jeff Van Raap
horst, but Paul Justin and John
Walker may also see action.
There's no cause for concern
in the backfield, though. Darryl
Harris and Channing Williams
combined for 18 TDs last year,
and AII-Pac-10 split end Aaron
Cox also returns after leading the
conference in reception yardage.
The other receiver spot and the
tight end spot are up for grabs.
Todd Kalis and All-American
Randall Me Daniel are the best
pair of guards in the nation, but
the rest of the offensive line is in
experienced. The only returnee
on the defensive line is Shawn
Patterson, but linebackers Greg
Clark and Stacy Harvey are back
at the inside linebacker posts.
The defensive backs are in good
shape, with Anthony Parker,
Eric Allen and Jeff Joseph.
Kicker Kent Bostrum and punter
Mike Schuh give the Devils a
strong kicking game.
Ari/.ona
The Wildcats were the only
team to beat Arizona State last
year, but that should come as no
surprise: Arizona has a particular
fondness for beating up on its
Tempe enemy.
The Cats could be hard
pressed to win their version of
the Big Game this year, though.
Most of last season's offense is
gone, including the second
leading passer (Alfred Jenkins)
and the second-leading receiver
(Jon Horton) in Arizona history.
Also departed is AII-Pac-10 tail
back David Adams.
Another of those much
coveted SMU transfers may have
won the job at quarterback. Bob
Watters, the Mustang starter last
year, tossed two first half touch
downs against New Mexico
before leaving with a bruised hip.
There is some depth at tailback
and receiver, with backs Art
Greathouse, David Eldridge and
Charles Webb, and flankers
Derek Hill and Jeff Fairholm.
The offensive line, anchored
by center Joe Tofflemire, is a def
inite strength. The only non-
Wildcat veteran on the line is
Kevin McKinney, a transfer
from — you guessed it — SMU.
Another Mustang-turned-
Wildcat, Toby Watts, may join a
defensive line that consists of
veterans George Hinkle, Dana
Wells and Reggie Gaddis.
Although Boomer Gibson
resumes his place at outside
linebacker, Arizona still has to
find a replacement for 19K6 Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Byron Evans. The Singleton
twins, Chris and Kevin, may mir

ror each other at the other
outside spot, while Blake Custer
and Jerry Beasley are a good bet
to nail down the inside lineback
ing duties.
All-Pac-10 safety Chuck Cecil,
the man who returned an inter
ception MX) yards against ASU
last year, is the star of the
defense. Eugene Hardy and

James Deßow also bolster the
secondary.
Kicker Gary Costen led the
Pac-10 and was second in the na
tion in field goals last year as a
freshman. New head coach Dick
Tomey likes junior Brett Holley
at punter.
IJSC
Former Arizona coach Larry
Smith moves over a few states to
take over the reins of the Trojan
horses, and he might be in for a
rough first year.
To begin with, there's the

schedule USC has already
beaten Boston College, but lost
to Michigan State and still has to
face Notre Dame and every Pac
-10 school except ASU.
The good news is that USC has
14 starters back. The bad news is
that this is a team that lost to
Washington State last year, and
didn't come up with many big
wins apart from a victory over
Washington.
Multi-talented quarterback
Rodney Peete, who took some
time off from spring ball to field
grounders as the shortstop of the

Trojan baseball team, is a threat
both running and passing. Peete,
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Week last week for his perform
ance against Boston College, has
some quality receivers to throw
to, including split end Ken Henry
and flanker Randy Tanner, both
of whom are dangerous with the
ball.
Paul Green will be the tight
end. Tailback Ryan Knight has
been (JSC's leading rusher the
past two seasons, and sopho
more Leroy Holt is at fullback.
Jeff Brecel is now with the

49ers, hut three other starters are
back on the offensive line, in
cluding senior tackle Dave
Cadigan. On the other side of the
hall, tackle Tim Ryan, a Fresh
man All-American last year, and
nose guard Dan Owens are
proven performers.
The USC linebackers, led by
All-Pac-I() selection Marcus Cot
ton, are an outstanding unit.
Three members of the secondary
departed, but a number of
prospects will be ready to step in.
Freshman Quin Rodriguez has won the kicking job,
and incumbent punter Chris Sperle returns.
Oregon
For the second straight year, the Ducks upset
Colorado and thereby served notice that Oregon
may once again reign supreme . , . among the Bot
tom Four, the group of schools which perenially
bring up the rear in the Pac-10. (Sometimes —
when Stanford has a bad year — this group
becomes the Bottom Five.)
Oregon has one of the hardest schedules in the
nation (facing 1986 bowl teams in seven of its first
eight games) and no longer has All-Pac-10 quarter
back Chris Miller. But the defense, which gave up a
whopping 30 points a game last year, surrendered
just one touchdown to the Colorado wishbone and
forced five turnovers, while the offense, led by red
shirt freshman Bill Musgrave, managed to outscore
the Buffaloes by a field goal, 10-7.
The key for Rich Brooks' squad will be the
defense, which is switching from the 4-3 "flex" set
to the more common 3-4 alignment. Nose tackle
Rollin Putzier will be the key to stopping the run —
something Oregon failed to do against Colorado,
which rolled up 2% yards on the ground. Only one
veteran, Anthony Newman, returns to the second
ary, but the Duck defense held the Buffaloes to just
87 yards passing.
Washington State
Coach Jim Walden has gone to lowa State, and
new coach Dennis Erickson inherits an enigma:
The Cougars beat USC and tied ASU last year, but
lost to California, Oregon and Oregon State.
This season, WSU is 2-1, having defeated peren
nially strong Fresno State and tough Wyoming, and
falling only to powerful Michigan. The Cougars are
scoring at a rate of 42 points per game — a pretty
impressive showing from a team that finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year.
I he C ougar attack looks balanced, averaging
over 200 yards a game passing and nearly that
much rushing. Sophomore signal caller Timm
Rosenbach can throw to receivers Tim Stallworth
and Victor Wood or hand off to running backs
Steve Broussard and Richard Calvin, who has been
a pleasant surprise while leading the Cougars in
rushing.
Three starters return to the offensive line.
The Cougars' weakness is defense. The unit gave
up 423.5 yards per game last year and is around that
mark in the first two games of this season. Six
starters are back, including outstanding senior
linebacker Brian Forde. The secondary is the big
gest concern, with just Shawn Landrum returning.
Fresno State and Wyoming piled up nearly 3(H)
passing yards apiece against the WSU coverage.
Oregon State
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has been touting the
Beavers' self-styled "Air Express" offense for
three years now, and this year Oregon State may
even have a defense to go with the powerful offense
that led the Pac-10 in passing last season.
Junior quarterback Erik Wilhelm threw for 353
yards in a 41-7 loss to Georgia in the team's opener,
but on the ground, the team looked like Beavers
out of water, gaining just 18 yards on 14 carries
against a top-notch Bulldog defense. Last week,
Wilhelm threw two TD passes in leading OSU over
San Jose State, breaking the Spartans' 11-game
winning streak.
Watch for Wilhelm to connect with tight end Phil
Ross and receiver Robb Thomas. Trey Nicholson

Brian Taylor and Eric Montgomery are in the back
field, and the offensive line, led by senior center
Dave Orndorff, should be fairly solid.
Defensively, the Beavers are improved, with
eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.
Sophomore Troy Taylor, who has seven TD
passes to his credit already this season (two more
than Bear quarterbacks had all last season) looks

years. Running back Chris Richards has run for
over 100 yards in all three games. Former quarter

scoring at a rate of 42 points per game — a pretty
impressive showing from a team that finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year.
I he C ougar attack looks balanced, averaging
over 200 yards a game passing and nearly that
much rushing. Sophomore signal caller Timm
Rosenbach can throw to receivers Tim Stallworth
and Victor Wood or hand off to running backs
Steve Broussard and Richard Calvin, who has been
a pleasant surprise while leading the Cougars in
rushing.
Three starters return to the offensive line.
The Cougars' weakness is defense. The unit gave
up 423.5 yards per game last year and is around that
mark in the first two games of this season. Six
starters are back, including outstanding senior
linebacker Brian Forde. The secondary is the big
gest concern, with just Shawn Landrum returning.
Fresno State and Wyoming piled up nearly 3(H)
passing yards apiece against the WSU coverage.
Oregon State
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has been touting the
Beavers' self-styled "Air Express" offense for
three years now, and this year Oregon State may
even have a defense to go with the powerful offense
that led the Pac-10 in passing last season.
Junior quarterback Erik Wilhelm threw for 353
yards in a 41-7 loss to Georgia in the team's opener,
but on the ground, the team looked like Beavers
out of water, gaining just 18 yards on 14 carries
against a top-notch Bulldog defense. Last week,
Wilhelm threw two TD passes in leading OSU over
San Jose State, breaking the Spartans' 11-game
winning streak.
Watch for Wilhelm to connect with tight end Phil
Ross and receiver Robb Thomas. Trey Nicholson

Brian Taylor and Eric Montgomery are in the back
field, and the offensive line, led by senior center
Dave Orndorff, should be fairly solid.
Defensively, the Beavers are improved, with
eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.
Sophomore Troy Taylor, who has seven TD
passes to his credit already this season (two more
than Bear quarterbacks had all last season) looks
like the California quarterback for the next few
years. Running back Chris Richards has run for
over 100 yards in all three games. Former quarter
back Brian Bedford has 16 receptions, and sopho
more Mike Ford has a lot of speed at receiver.
The major problem for the Bear offense is the
line, which has three men back but not much talent
or depth.
Noseguard Majett Whiteside is Cal's most
talented player, and the defensive line could be the
best unit on the team. Ken Harvey is an excellent
linebacker, and David Ortega also returns at an
inside linebacker spot. The secondary has two men
back, but after giving up 421 yards passing to San
Jose State, it is clearly still a concern.


■r c Susan Fox/Daily
II Stanford quarterback (,reg hnnis can j»et good protection from his offensive line today, he should find receivers open
downfield against the Spartans' man-to-man defense.
Last year, any and all doubts
about which college football con
ference is the strongest in the
country were laid to rest. Unfor
tunately, the now-undisputed
champion of NFL farm team
leagues is the division in which
Stanford has to compete.
That automatically gives the
Cardinal one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. Even
Washington State and Oregon
State (teams which perenially
complain about how difficult it is

to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) aren't certain wins. And
last-place California managed to
win two games last year — sadly
for Stanford, one of those wins
came in Big Game.
The Pac-10 sent a record six
teams to postseason play last
year, and four teams — UCLA,
Washington, Arizona State and
USC — have already been
ranked in the top 20 in wire ser
vice polls this season.
After three weeks of play,
here's a look at Stanford's com
petition in this powerhouse
league:

UCLA
The Bruins tied for second in
the conference last season, hut
this year almost everyone is
favoring the men in powder blue
and gold to wind up in their own
home stadium come New Year's
Day.
UCLA has history on its side.
Terry Donahue's squad earned
bowl game victories in each of
the last five years and won the
Pac-10 title, and subsequently
the Rose Bowl, three times
during that span.
Frighteningly, this year's
vintage of the Bruins may be bet

ter than any UCLA unit in those
five years. Led by their Heisman
Trophy-hopeful running back
Gaston Green, the Bruins are
loaded with talent, especially in
the backfield and on defense.
Green led the league in rushing
last year, averaging 113.9 yards
per game, and scored 17 touch
downs. The tailback ran for three
touchdowns and set a major
college bowl record by chalking
up 266 yards on the ground in
UCLA's 31-10 win over BYU in
the Freedom Bowl.
But the senior had a string of
eight consecutive 100-yard rush
ing games snapped in the Bruins'
second game of the 1987 season,
tallying just 46 yards in a 42-33
loss to No. 2 Nebraska.
As if Green wasn't enough, the
Bruins also have junior running
back Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl Player of the Game, back
from injuries to join fullbacks
James Primus and Mel Farr in a
formidable stable of backs.
Quarterback Troy Aikman, a
transfer from Oklahoma, will
have the pleasure of handing the
ball off to his large, speedy backs
and also will have the opportu
nity to throw to senior receivers
Willie "Flipper"' Anderson and
Paco Craig. In his First two starts,
Aikman has averaged nearly 2(H)
yards passing a game and has
not been intercepted: however,
he has yet to throw a touchdown
pass.
The offensive line is young,
with only tackle John Kidder
back. SMU transfer David Ric
hards should play a key role at
tackle, while senior Doug Wassel
moves from the defensive line to
center.
The defensive line is led by
All-Pac-10 nose guard Terry
Tumey and senior tackle Jim
Wahler. Overall, the defense
returns seven starters, including
leading tackier Ken Norton Jr. at
inside linebacker and junior cor
nerback Darryl Henley, who will
also return punts and kicks. Spe
cial teams should be solid, with
sophomore kicker Alfredo
Velasco and junior punter Harold
Barkate.
Washington
Off to a good start with a
league win over Stanford already
in their pocket, the Huskies also
have a non-conference win over
Purdue to go with a loss to Texas
A & M. Senior quarterback Chris
Chandler is another Heisman
candidate, as he demonstrated in
winning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for his 314-yard
passing performance against the
Cardinal three weeks ago. For
the season, Chandler has over
6(H) yards passing and four touch
down tosses.
Most of those passes have
been directed to senior Darryl
Franklin, who had eight recep
tions for 209 yards against Stan
ford, and junior Brian Slater.
Tailback Vince Weathersby is
also a threat coming out of the
backfield. Other backs include
Steve Jones and fullbacks Tony
Covington and Aaron Jenkins.
The very large men protecting
Chandler and opening up holes
for the backs were plagued by in
juries last year. Still, the offen
sive line is bigger than the line of
that other Seattle football team,
the Seahawks. Junior guards
Brett Wiese and Mike Zandofsky
anchor the line.
The defensive line has been
more of a concern for head coach
Don James, as all of last year's
line, including Ail-American
tackle Reggie Rogers, graduated.
The linebacking corps — led by
David Rill. Tom Frlandson and
Bo Yates — is superb. The sec
ondary features numerous veter
ans including Tony Zachery, Art
Malone and Darryl Hall.
Bandy Brownlee, another
SMU transfer, is softening the
sting ol the the graduation of
kicker Jeff Jaeger, the Huskies'
all-time leading scorer.

Brownlee connected on three
field goals against Stanford and
has not missed an extra point at
tempt this year.
Arizona State
The Sun Devils are the defend
ing Rose Bowl champions and
will likely make another run for
the roses, if for no other reason
than the ease of their schedule.
ASU not only doesn't play
Stanford or USC, it also does
play all the patsies of the Pac-10
— Oregon, Oregon State and
California. The Sun Devils have
already licked one cupcake,
Pacific, 31-10. beaten up on Illi
nois. one of the least frightening
of the Big Ten teams, and they're
probably less than apprehensive
about the prospect of taking on
Western Athletic Conference
doormat Texas-El Paso later in
the year.
The only real football schools
on the ASU agenda this year are
UCLA. Nebraska and arch-rival
Arizona. The Devils could just
slide their way right to Pasadena
without much difficulty.
But Coach John Cooper's team
returns just 11 members from last
year, and there are many un
answered questions. The first is
at quarterback. Junior Dan Ford
seems to be holding down the
spot vacated by Jeff Van Raap
horst, but Paul Justin and John
Walker may also see action.
There's no cause for concern
in the backfield, though. Darryl
Harris and Channing Williams
combined for 18 TDs last year,
and AII-Pac-10 split end Aaron
Cox also returns after leading the
conference in reception yardage.
The other receiver spot and the
tight end spot are up for grabs.
Todd Kalis and All-American
Randall Me Daniel are the best
pair of guards in the nation, but
the rest of the offensive line is in
experienced. The only returnee
on the defensive line is Shawn
Patterson, but linebackers Greg
Clark and Stacy Harvey are back
at the inside linebacker posts.
The defensive backs are in good
shape, with Anthony Parker,
Eric Allen and Jeff Joseph.
Kicker Kent Bostrum and punter
Mike Schuh give the Devils a
strong kicking game.
Ari/.ona
The Wildcats were the only
team to beat Arizona State last
year, but that should come as no
surprise: Arizona has a particular
fondness for beating up on its
Tempe enemy.
The Cats could be hard
pressed to win their version of
the Big Game this year, though.
Most of last season's offense is
gone, including the second
leading passer (Alfred Jenkins)
and the second-leading receiver
(Jon Horton) in Arizona history.
Also departed is AII-Pac-10 tail
back David Adams.
Another of those much
coveted SMU transfers may have
won the job at quarterback. Bob
Watters, the Mustang starter last
year, tossed two first half touch
downs against New Mexico
before leaving with a bruised hip.
There is some depth at tailback
and receiver, with backs Art
Greathouse, David Eldridge and
Charles Webb, and flankers
Derek Hill and Jeff Fairholm.
The offensive line, anchored
by center Joe Tofflemire, is a def
inite strength. The only non-
Wildcat veteran on the line is
Kevin McKinney, a transfer
from — you guessed it — SMU.
Another Mustang-turned-
Wildcat, Toby Watts, may join a
defensive line that consists of
veterans George Hinkle, Dana
Wells and Reggie Gaddis.
Although Boomer Gibson
resumes his place at outside
linebacker, Arizona still has to
find a replacement for 19K6 Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Byron Evans. The Singleton
twins, Chris and Kevin, may mir

ror each other at the other
outside spot, while Blake Custer
and Jerry Beasley are a good bet
to nail down the inside lineback
ing duties.
All-Pac-10 safety Chuck Cecil,
the man who returned an inter
ception MX) yards against ASU
last year, is the star of the
defense. Eugene Hardy and

James Deßow also bolster the
secondary.
Kicker Gary Costen led the
Pac-10 and was second in the na
tion in field goals last year as a
freshman. New head coach Dick
Tomey likes junior Brett Holley
at punter.
IJSC
Former Arizona coach Larry
Smith moves over a few states to
take over the reins of the Trojan
horses, and he might be in for a
rough first year.
To begin with, there's the

schedule USC has already
beaten Boston College, but lost
to Michigan State and still has to
face Notre Dame and every Pac
-10 school except ASU.
The good news is that USC has
14 starters back. The bad news is
that this is a team that lost to
Washington State last year, and
didn't come up with many big
wins apart from a victory over
Washington.
Multi-talented quarterback
Rodney Peete, who took some
time off from spring ball to field
grounders as the shortstop of the

Trojan baseball team, is a threat
both running and passing. Peete,
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Week last week for his perform
ance against Boston College, has
some quality receivers to throw
to, including split end Ken Henry
and flanker Randy Tanner, both
of whom are dangerous with the
ball.
Paul Green will be the tight
end. Tailback Ryan Knight has
been (JSC's leading rusher the
past two seasons, and sopho
more Leroy Holt is at fullback.
Jeff Brecel is now with the

49ers, hut three other starters are
back on the offensive line, in
cluding senior tackle Dave
Cadigan. On the other side of the
hall, tackle Tim Ryan, a Fresh
man All-American last year, and
nose guard Dan Owens are
proven performers.
The USC linebackers, led by
All-Pac-I() selection Marcus Cot
ton, are an outstanding unit.
Three members of the secondary
departed, but a number of
prospects will be ready to step in.
Freshman Quin Rodriguez has won the kicking job,
and incumbent punter Chris Sperle returns.
Oregon
For the second straight year, the Ducks upset
Colorado and thereby served notice that Oregon
may once again reign supreme . , . among the Bot
tom Four, the group of schools which perenially
bring up the rear in the Pac-10. (Sometimes —
when Stanford has a bad year — this group
becomes the Bottom Five.)
Oregon has one of the hardest schedules in the
nation (facing 1986 bowl teams in seven of its first
eight games) and no longer has All-Pac-10 quarter
back Chris Miller. But the defense, which gave up a
whopping 30 points a game last year, surrendered
just one touchdown to the Colorado wishbone and
forced five turnovers, while the offense, led by red
shirt freshman Bill Musgrave, managed to outscore
the Buffaloes by a field goal, 10-7.
The key for Rich Brooks' squad will be the
defense, which is switching from the 4-3 "flex" set
to the more common 3-4 alignment. Nose tackle
Rollin Putzier will be the key to stopping the run —
something Oregon failed to do against Colorado,
which rolled up 2% yards on the ground. Only one
veteran, Anthony Newman, returns to the second
ary, but the Duck defense held the Buffaloes to just
87 yards passing.
Washington State
Coach Jim Walden has gone to lowa State, and
new coach Dennis Erickson inherits an enigma:
The Cougars beat USC and tied ASU last year, but
lost to California, Oregon and Oregon State.
This season, WSU is 2-1, having defeated peren
nially strong Fresno State and tough Wyoming, and
falling only to powerful Michigan. The Cougars are
scoring at a rate of 42 points per game — a pretty
impressive showing from a team that finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year.
I he C ougar attack looks balanced, averaging
over 200 yards a game passing and nearly that
much rushing. Sophomore signal caller Timm
Rosenbach can throw to receivers Tim Stallworth
and Victor Wood or hand off to running backs
Steve Broussard and Richard Calvin, who has been
a pleasant surprise while leading the Cougars in
rushing.
Three starters return to the offensive line.
The Cougars' weakness is defense. The unit gave
up 423.5 yards per game last year and is around that
mark in the first two games of this season. Six
starters are back, including outstanding senior
linebacker Brian Forde. The secondary is the big
gest concern, with just Shawn Landrum returning.
Fresno State and Wyoming piled up nearly 3(H)
passing yards apiece against the WSU coverage.
Oregon State
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has been touting the
Beavers' self-styled "Air Express" offense for
three years now, and this year Oregon State may
even have a defense to go with the powerful offense
that led the Pac-10 in passing last season.
Junior quarterback Erik Wilhelm threw for 353
yards in a 41-7 loss to Georgia in the team's opener,
but on the ground, the team looked like Beavers
out of water, gaining just 18 yards on 14 carries
against a top-notch Bulldog defense. Last week,
Wilhelm threw two TD passes in leading OSU over
San Jose State, breaking the Spartans' 11-game
winning streak.
Watch for Wilhelm to connect with tight end Phil
Ross and receiver Robb Thomas. Trey Nicholson

Brian Taylor and Eric Montgomery are in the back
field, and the offensive line, led by senior center
Dave Orndorff, should be fairly solid.
Defensively, the Beavers are improved, with
eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.

All-Pac-I() selection Marcus Cot
ton, are an outstanding unit.
Three members of the secondary
departed, but a number of
prospects will be ready to step in.
Freshman Quin Rodriguez has won the kicking job,
and incumbent punter Chris Sperle returns.
Oregon
For the second straight year, the Ducks upset
Colorado and thereby served notice that Oregon
may once again reign supreme . , . among the Bot
tom Four, the group of schools which perenially
bring up the rear in the Pac-10. (Sometimes —
when Stanford has a bad year — this group
becomes the Bottom Five.)
Oregon has one of the hardest schedules in the
nation (facing 1986 bowl teams in seven of its first
eight games) and no longer has All-Pac-10 quarter
back Chris Miller. But the defense, which gave up a
whopping 30 points a game last year, surrendered
just one touchdown to the Colorado wishbone and
forced five turnovers, while the offense, led by red
shirt freshman Bill Musgrave, managed to outscore
the Buffaloes by a field goal, 10-7.
The key for Rich Brooks' squad will be the
defense, which is switching from the 4-3 "flex" set
to the more common 3-4 alignment. Nose tackle
Rollin Putzier will be the key to stopping the run —
something Oregon failed to do against Colorado,
which rolled up 2% yards on the ground. Only one
veteran, Anthony Newman, returns to the second
ary, but the Duck defense held the Buffaloes to just
87 yards passing.
Washington State
Coach Jim Walden has gone to lowa State, and
new coach Dennis Erickson inherits an enigma:
The Cougars beat USC and tied ASU last year, but
lost to California, Oregon and Oregon State.
This season, WSU is 2-1, having defeated peren
nially strong Fresno State and tough Wyoming, and
falling only to powerful Michigan. The Cougars are
scoring at a rate of 42 points per game — a pretty
impressive showing from a team that finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year.
I he C ougar attack looks balanced, averaging
over 200 yards a game passing and nearly that
much rushing. Sophomore signal caller Timm
Rosenbach can throw to receivers Tim Stallworth
and Victor Wood or hand off to running backs
Steve Broussard and Richard Calvin, who has been
a pleasant surprise while leading the Cougars in
rushing.
Three starters return to the offensive line.
The Cougars' weakness is defense. The unit gave
up 423.5 yards per game last year and is around that
mark in the first two games of this season. Six
starters are back, including outstanding senior
linebacker Brian Forde. The secondary is the big
gest concern, with just Shawn Landrum returning.
Fresno State and Wyoming piled up nearly 3(H)
passing yards apiece against the WSU coverage.
Oregon State
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has been touting the
Beavers' self-styled "Air Express" offense for
three years now, and this year Oregon State may
even have a defense to go with the powerful offense
that led the Pac-10 in passing last season.
Junior quarterback Erik Wilhelm threw for 353
yards in a 41-7 loss to Georgia in the team's opener,
but on the ground, the team looked like Beavers
out of water, gaining just 18 yards on 14 carries
against a top-notch Bulldog defense. Last week,
Wilhelm threw two TD passes in leading OSU over
San Jose State, breaking the Spartans' 11-game
winning streak.
Watch for Wilhelm to connect with tight end Phil
Ross and receiver Robb Thomas. Trey Nicholson

Brian Taylor and Eric Montgomery are in the back
field, and the offensive line, led by senior center
Dave Orndorff, should be fairly solid.
Defensively, the Beavers are improved, with
eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.
Sophomore Troy Taylor, who has seven TD
passes to his credit already this season (two more
than Bear quarterbacks had all last season) looks
like the California quarterback for the next few
years. Running back Chris Richards has run for
over 100 yards in all three games. Former quarter
back Brian Bedford has 16 receptions, and sopho
more Mike Ford has a lot of speed at receiver.
The major problem for the Bear offense is the
line, which has three men back but not much talent
or depth.
Noseguard Majett Whiteside is Cal's most
talented player, and the defensive line could be the
best unit on the team. Ken Harvey is an excellent
linebacker, and David Ortega also returns at an
inside linebacker spot. The secondary has two men
back, but after giving up 421 yards passing to San
Jose State, it is clearly still a concern.


■r c Susan Fox/Daily
II Stanford quarterback (,reg hnnis can j»et good protection from his offensive line today, he should find receivers open
downfield against the Spartans' man-to-man defense.
Last year, any and all doubts
about which college football con
ference is the strongest in the
country were laid to rest. Unfor
tunately, the now-undisputed
champion of NFL farm team
leagues is the division in which
Stanford has to compete.
That automatically gives the
Cardinal one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. Even
Washington State and Oregon
State (teams which perenially
complain about how difficult it is

to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) aren't certain wins. And
last-place California managed to
win two games last year — sadly
for Stanford, one of those wins
came in Big Game.
The Pac-10 sent a record six
teams to postseason play last
year, and four teams — UCLA,
Washington, Arizona State and
USC — have already been
ranked in the top 20 in wire ser
vice polls this season.
After three weeks of play,
here's a look at Stanford's com
petition in this powerhouse
league:

UCLA
The Bruins tied for second in
the conference last season, hut
this year almost everyone is
favoring the men in powder blue
and gold to wind up in their own
home stadium come New Year's
Day.
UCLA has history on its side.
Terry Donahue's squad earned
bowl game victories in each of
the last five years and won the
Pac-10 title, and subsequently
the Rose Bowl, three times
during that span.
Frighteningly, this year's
vintage of the Bruins may be bet

ter than any UCLA unit in those
five years. Led by their Heisman
Trophy-hopeful running back
Gaston Green, the Bruins are
loaded with talent, especially in
the backfield and on defense.
Green led the league in rushing
last year, averaging 113.9 yards
per game, and scored 17 touch
downs. The tailback ran for three
touchdowns and set a major
college bowl record by chalking
up 266 yards on the ground in
UCLA's 31-10 win over BYU in
the Freedom Bowl.
But the senior had a string of
eight consecutive 100-yard rush
ing games snapped in the Bruins'
second game of the 1987 season,
tallying just 46 yards in a 42-33
loss to No. 2 Nebraska.
As if Green wasn't enough, the
Bruins also have junior running
back Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl Player of the Game, back
from injuries to join fullbacks
James Primus and Mel Farr in a
formidable stable of backs.
Quarterback Troy Aikman, a
transfer from Oklahoma, will
have the pleasure of handing the
ball off to his large, speedy backs
and also will have the opportu
nity to throw to senior receivers
Willie "Flipper"' Anderson and
Paco Craig. In his First two starts,
Aikman has averaged nearly 2(H)
yards passing a game and has
not been intercepted: however,
he has yet to throw a touchdown
pass.
The offensive line is young,
with only tackle John Kidder
back. SMU transfer David Ric
hards should play a key role at
tackle, while senior Doug Wassel
moves from the defensive line to
center.
The defensive line is led by
All-Pac-10 nose guard Terry
Tumey and senior tackle Jim
Wahler. Overall, the defense
returns seven starters, including
leading tackier Ken Norton Jr. at
inside linebacker and junior cor
nerback Darryl Henley, who will
also return punts and kicks. Spe
cial teams should be solid, with
sophomore kicker Alfredo
Velasco and junior punter Harold
Barkate.
Washington
Off to a good start with a
league win over Stanford already
in their pocket, the Huskies also
have a non-conference win over
Purdue to go with a loss to Texas
A & M. Senior quarterback Chris
Chandler is another Heisman
candidate, as he demonstrated in
winning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for his 314-yard
passing performance against the
Cardinal three weeks ago. For
the season, Chandler has over
6(H) yards passing and four touch
down tosses.
Most of those passes have
been directed to senior Darryl
Franklin, who had eight recep
tions for 209 yards against Stan
ford, and junior Brian Slater.
Tailback Vince Weathersby is
also a threat coming out of the
backfield. Other backs include
Steve Jones and fullbacks Tony
Covington and Aaron Jenkins.
The very large men protecting
Chandler and opening up holes
for the backs were plagued by in
juries last year. Still, the offen
sive line is bigger than the line of
that other Seattle football team,
the Seahawks. Junior guards
Brett Wiese and Mike Zandofsky
anchor the line.
The defensive line has been
more of a concern for head coach
Don James, as all of last year's
line, including Ail-American
tackle Reggie Rogers, graduated.
The linebacking corps — led by
David Rill. Tom Frlandson and
Bo Yates — is superb. The sec
ondary features numerous veter
ans including Tony Zachery, Art
Malone and Darryl Hall.
Bandy Brownlee, another
SMU transfer, is softening the
sting ol the the graduation of
kicker Jeff Jaeger, the Huskies'
all-time leading scorer.

Brownlee connected on three
field goals against Stanford and
has not missed an extra point at
tempt this year.
Arizona State
The Sun Devils are the defend
ing Rose Bowl champions and
will likely make another run for
the roses, if for no other reason
than the ease of their schedule.
ASU not only doesn't play
Stanford or USC, it also does
play all the patsies of the Pac-10
— Oregon, Oregon State and
California. The Sun Devils have
already licked one cupcake,
Pacific, 31-10. beaten up on Illi
nois. one of the least frightening
of the Big Ten teams, and they're
probably less than apprehensive
about the prospect of taking on
Western Athletic Conference
doormat Texas-El Paso later in
the year.
The only real football schools
on the ASU agenda this year are
UCLA. Nebraska and arch-rival
Arizona. The Devils could just
slide their way right to Pasadena
without much difficulty.
But Coach John Cooper's team
returns just 11 members from last
year, and there are many un
answered questions. The first is
at quarterback. Junior Dan Ford
seems to be holding down the
spot vacated by Jeff Van Raap
horst, but Paul Justin and John
Walker may also see action.
There's no cause for concern
in the backfield, though. Darryl
Harris and Channing Williams
combined for 18 TDs last year,
and AII-Pac-10 split end Aaron
Cox also returns after leading the
conference in reception yardage.
The other receiver spot and the
tight end spot are up for grabs.
Todd Kalis and All-American
Randall Me Daniel are the best
pair of guards in the nation, but
the rest of the offensive line is in
experienced. The only returnee
on the defensive line is Shawn
Patterson, but linebackers Greg
Clark and Stacy Harvey are back
at the inside linebacker posts.
The defensive backs are in good
shape, with Anthony Parker,
Eric Allen and Jeff Joseph.
Kicker Kent Bostrum and punter
Mike Schuh give the Devils a
strong kicking game.
Ari/.ona
The Wildcats were the only
team to beat Arizona State last
year, but that should come as no
surprise: Arizona has a particular
fondness for beating up on its
Tempe enemy.
The Cats could be hard
pressed to win their version of
the Big Game this year, though.
Most of last season's offense is
gone, including the second
leading passer (Alfred Jenkins)
and the second-leading receiver
(Jon Horton) in Arizona history.
Also departed is AII-Pac-10 tail
back David Adams.
Another of those much
coveted SMU transfers may have
won the job at quarterback. Bob
Watters, the Mustang starter last
year, tossed two first half touch
downs against New Mexico
before leaving with a bruised hip.
There is some depth at tailback
and receiver, with backs Art
Greathouse, David Eldridge and
Charles Webb, and flankers
Derek Hill and Jeff Fairholm.
The offensive line, anchored
by center Joe Tofflemire, is a def
inite strength. The only non-
Wildcat veteran on the line is
Kevin McKinney, a transfer
from — you guessed it — SMU.
Another Mustang-turned-
Wildcat, Toby Watts, may join a
defensive line that consists of
veterans George Hinkle, Dana
Wells and Reggie Gaddis.
Although Boomer Gibson
resumes his place at outside
linebacker, Arizona still has to
find a replacement for 19K6 Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Byron Evans. The Singleton
twins, Chris and Kevin, may mir

ror each other at the other
outside spot, while Blake Custer
and Jerry Beasley are a good bet
to nail down the inside lineback
ing duties.
All-Pac-10 safety Chuck Cecil,
the man who returned an inter
ception MX) yards against ASU
last year, is the star of the
defense. Eugene Hardy and

James Deßow also bolster the
secondary.
Kicker Gary Costen led the
Pac-10 and was second in the na
tion in field goals last year as a
freshman. New head coach Dick
Tomey likes junior Brett Holley
at punter.
IJSC
Former Arizona coach Larry
Smith moves over a few states to
take over the reins of the Trojan
horses, and he might be in for a
rough first year.
To begin with, there's the

schedule USC has already
beaten Boston College, but lost
to Michigan State and still has to
face Notre Dame and every Pac
-10 school except ASU.
The good news is that USC has
14 starters back. The bad news is
that this is a team that lost to
Washington State last year, and
didn't come up with many big
wins apart from a victory over
Washington.
Multi-talented quarterback
Rodney Peete, who took some
time off from spring ball to field
grounders as the shortstop of the

Trojan baseball team, is a threat
both running and passing. Peete,
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Week last week for his perform
ance against Boston College, has
some quality receivers to throw
to, including split end Ken Henry
and flanker Randy Tanner, both
of whom are dangerous with the
ball.
Paul Green will be the tight
end. Tailback Ryan Knight has
been (JSC's leading rusher the
past two seasons, and sopho
more Leroy Holt is at fullback.
Jeff Brecel is now with the

49ers, hut three other starters are
back on the offensive line, in
cluding senior tackle Dave
Cadigan. On the other side of the
hall, tackle Tim Ryan, a Fresh
man All-American last year, and
nose guard Dan Owens are
proven performers.
The USC linebackers, led by
All-Pac-I() selection Marcus Cot
ton, are an outstanding unit.
Three members of the secondary
departed, but a number of
prospects will be ready to step in.
Freshman Quin Rodriguez has won the kicking job,
and incumbent punter Chris Sperle returns.
Oregon
For the second straight year, the Ducks upset
Colorado and thereby served notice that Oregon
may once again reign supreme . , . among the Bot
tom Four, the group of schools which perenially
bring up the rear in the Pac-10. (Sometimes —
when Stanford has a bad year — this group
becomes the Bottom Five.)
Oregon has one of the hardest schedules in the
nation (facing 1986 bowl teams in seven of its first
eight games) and no longer has All-Pac-10 quarter
back Chris Miller. But the defense, which gave up a
whopping 30 points a game last year, surrendered
just one touchdown to the Colorado wishbone and
forced five turnovers, while the offense, led by red
shirt freshman Bill Musgrave, managed to outscore
the Buffaloes by a field goal, 10-7.
The key for Rich Brooks' squad will be the
defense, which is switching from the 4-3 "flex" set
to the more common 3-4 alignment. Nose tackle
Rollin Putzier will be the key to stopping the run —
something Oregon failed to do against Colorado,
which rolled up 2% yards on the ground. Only one
veteran, Anthony Newman, returns to the second

nially strong Fresno State and tough Wyoming, and
falling only to powerful Michigan. The Cougars are

Kicker Gary Costen led the
Pac-10 and was second in the na
tion in field goals last year as a
freshman. New head coach Dick
Tomey likes junior Brett Holley
at punter.
IJSC
Former Arizona coach Larry
Smith moves over a few states to
take over the reins of the Trojan
horses, and he might be in for a
rough first year.
To begin with, there's the

schedule USC has already
beaten Boston College, but lost
to Michigan State and still has to
face Notre Dame and every Pac
-10 school except ASU.
The good news is that USC has
14 starters back. The bad news is
that this is a team that lost to
Washington State last year, and
didn't come up with many big
wins apart from a victory over
Washington.
Multi-talented quarterback
Rodney Peete, who took some
time off from spring ball to field
grounders as the shortstop of the

Trojan baseball team, is a threat
both running and passing. Peete,
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Week last week for his perform
ance against Boston College, has
some quality receivers to throw
to, including split end Ken Henry
and flanker Randy Tanner, both
of whom are dangerous with the
ball.
Paul Green will be the tight
end. Tailback Ryan Knight has
been (JSC's leading rusher the
past two seasons, and sopho
more Leroy Holt is at fullback.
Jeff Brecel is now with the

49ers, hut three other starters are
back on the offensive line, in
cluding senior tackle Dave
Cadigan. On the other side of the
hall, tackle Tim Ryan, a Fresh
man All-American last year, and
nose guard Dan Owens are
proven performers.
The USC linebackers, led by
All-Pac-I() selection Marcus Cot
ton, are an outstanding unit.
Three members of the secondary
departed, but a number of
prospects will be ready to step in.
Freshman Quin Rodriguez has won the kicking job,
and incumbent punter Chris Sperle returns.
Oregon
For the second straight year, the Ducks upset
Colorado and thereby served notice that Oregon
may once again reign supreme . , . among the Bot
tom Four, the group of schools which perenially
bring up the rear in the Pac-10. (Sometimes —
when Stanford has a bad year — this group
becomes the Bottom Five.)
Oregon has one of the hardest schedules in the
nation (facing 1986 bowl teams in seven of its first
eight games) and no longer has All-Pac-10 quarter
back Chris Miller. But the defense, which gave up a
whopping 30 points a game last year, surrendered
just one touchdown to the Colorado wishbone and
forced five turnovers, while the offense, led by red
shirt freshman Bill Musgrave, managed to outscore
the Buffaloes by a field goal, 10-7.
The key for Rich Brooks' squad will be the
defense, which is switching from the 4-3 "flex" set
to the more common 3-4 alignment. Nose tackle
Rollin Putzier will be the key to stopping the run —
something Oregon failed to do against Colorado,
which rolled up 2% yards on the ground. Only one
veteran, Anthony Newman, returns to the second
ary, but the Duck defense held the Buffaloes to just
87 yards passing.
Washington State
Coach Jim Walden has gone to lowa State, and
new coach Dennis Erickson inherits an enigma:
The Cougars beat USC and tied ASU last year, but
lost to California, Oregon and Oregon State.
This season, WSU is 2-1, having defeated peren
nially strong Fresno State and tough Wyoming, and
falling only to powerful Michigan. The Cougars are
scoring at a rate of 42 points per game — a pretty
impressive showing from a team that finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year.
I he C ougar attack looks balanced, averaging
over 200 yards a game passing and nearly that
much rushing. Sophomore signal caller Timm
Rosenbach can throw to receivers Tim Stallworth
and Victor Wood or hand off to running backs
Steve Broussard and Richard Calvin, who has been
a pleasant surprise while leading the Cougars in
rushing.
Three starters return to the offensive line.
The Cougars' weakness is defense. The unit gave
up 423.5 yards per game last year and is around that
mark in the first two games of this season. Six
starters are back, including outstanding senior
linebacker Brian Forde. The secondary is the big
gest concern, with just Shawn Landrum returning.
Fresno State and Wyoming piled up nearly 3(H)
passing yards apiece against the WSU coverage.
Oregon State
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has been touting the
Beavers' self-styled "Air Express" offense for
three years now, and this year Oregon State may
even have a defense to go with the powerful offense
that led the Pac-10 in passing last season.
Junior quarterback Erik Wilhelm threw for 353
yards in a 41-7 loss to Georgia in the team's opener,
but on the ground, the team looked like Beavers
out of water, gaining just 18 yards on 14 carries
against a top-notch Bulldog defense. Last week,
Wilhelm threw two TD passes in leading OSU over
San Jose State, breaking the Spartans' 11-game
winning streak.
Watch for Wilhelm to connect with tight end Phil
Ross and receiver Robb Thomas. Trey Nicholson

Brian Taylor and Eric Montgomery are in the back
field, and the offensive line, led by senior center
Dave Orndorff, should be fairly solid.
Defensively, the Beavers are improved, with
eight men back, including all four defensive backs
plus former all-conference cornerback Lavance
Northington, who missed the 1986 season with in
juries.
California
Big Game aside, California was the joke of the
Pac-10 last year. But three of the biggest targets of
abuse last season have departed. Controversial
coach Joe Kapp was fired. Freshman sensation
Marc Hicks, who slumped both on the field and in
the classroom his sophomore year, left for Ohio
State. Flamboyant linebacker Hardy Nickerson,
meanwhile, went to the NFL.
That leaves new coach Bruce Snyder with the
job of picking up the pieces. The outlook for the
Bears is not bright, despite a 42-0 thrashing of a
weak Pacific team in the season opener and narrow
losses to San Jose State and Minnesota the past
two Saturdays. There is a lot of rebuilding to be
done.
Sophomore Troy Taylor, who has seven TD
passes to his credit already this season (two more
than Bear quarterbacks had all last season) looks
like the California quarterback for the next few
years. Running back Chris Richards has run for
over 100 yards in all three games. Former quarter
back Brian Bedford has 16 receptions, and sopho
more Mike Ford has a lot of speed at receiver.
The major problem for the Bear offense is the
line, which has three men back but not much talent
or depth.
Noseguard Majett Whiteside is Cal's most
talented player, and the defensive line could be the
best unit on the team. Ken Harvey is an excellent
linebacker, and David Ortega also returns at an
inside linebacker spot. The secondary has two men
back, but after giving up 421 yards passing to San
Jose State, it is clearly still a concern.

II Stanford quarterback (,reg hnnis can j»et good protection from his offensive line today, he should find receivers open
downfield against the Spartans' man-to-man defense.
