# Kerr's SJSU recruits return to haunt him
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Parting is such sweet sorrow,
the saying goes, and Larry Kerr
knows all about that.
Four years ago, when Jack El
way left San Jose State to assume
head football coaching duties at
Stanford, Kerr abdicated his post
as the Spartans' recruiting direc
tor to become the Cardinal
linebacker coach, leaving behind
a talent-laden freshman class that
he had hand-picked for San Jose
State.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Kerr performed his recruiting
duties a little too well, and three
members of the SJS recruiting
class of 1983 have come back to
haunt him. Offensive tackle Mike
Barnard, punter Tom Diehl and
fullback Rich Harbison have
moved from obscurity to
prominence while contributing to
the success of Kerr's alma mater
and former employer.
"Leaving (the program at San
Jose State) was hard to a certain
extent," Kerr said. "You like to
coach the kids you recruit.
"I don't look forward to
playing them. Playing them is
hard, because I know them and
their families," he added.
Kerr is far from lamenting his
losses, however. "Working for
Jack has been great for me
professionally," he said. "The
chance to move to Stanford was
professionally the best."
But Kerr also had to face the
prospect of leaving behind
several players he had recruited
— players who would be on the
other side of the field in future
games.
"At first it was a big deal,"
Barnard said of playing against
the man who recruited him.
"Now that's kind of blown over,
(but) I'd still like to beat him."
Barnard, the Spartans' only re
turning offensive lineman, has
logged more playing time than
any of his SJS teammates. The
Sebastopol, Calif., native has
started in 25 games, playing both
left and right tackle with a brief
stint at left guard.
Kerr spotted Barnard's talent
and all but stole the player from
the paws of California. After a
Golden Bears coach cancelled a
planned recruiting visit during
Barnard's senior year, Kerr
seized the opportunity and went
with Elway to the Barnard home
for dinner.
"He presented the school very
well and he told me a lot about
it," Barnard said. "He's a good
recruiter."

Diehl, Barnard's high school
classmate and another Kerr
recruit, has blossomed into one
of the top punters in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association. He
finished second in the conference
in his specialty, averaging 40.7
yards per punt in 1986 with a
season's best of 76 yards. Diehl
was selected second-team All-
PC A A last year.
"I really like Larry a lot," he
said of Kerr, "It would be all the
better to go up there and beat
him, because I know he would be
proud of me if I had a good game.
"I want to beat Stanford
anyway, but I think that would
make it sweeter," Diehl added.
Perhaps the most pleasant

surprise in San Jose State's class
of '88 is Harbison. Recruited by
Kerr as a quarterback, the Spar
tan senior has since played seven
positions, including fullback,
tight end, outside linebacker,
backup quarterback and several
special team assignments.
Harbison has been most af
fected by Kerr's departure.
"When the coaches who
recruited you are here, they
know you better," the senior
said. "When the new coaches
came, there was new re
recruiting."
So although Harbison came to
San Jose State as a quarterback,
Coach ( iaude Gilbert turned him
into a jack-oi-all-trades, making
his road to success all that much
more challenging.
"It is difficult to get a good
grasp on a new position," Har
bison said. However, the com
mon denominator to all of the
positions he has played is that
"you need to react to what's
going on out there," he said.
Though clearly happy at San
Jose State, Harbison remembers
a time in high school when Stan
ford topped his list of colleges.
"Stanford is a great school, and I
wanted to go there," he said. "In
my mind, I thought 'If only I left
(high school) one year later.' "

wanted to go there," he said. "In
my mind, I thought 'If only I left
(high school) one year later.' "

Parting is such sweet sorrow,
the saying goes, and Larry Kerr
knows all about that.
Four years ago, when Jack El
way left San Jose State to assume
head football coaching duties at
Stanford, Kerr abdicated his post
as the Spartans' recruiting direc
tor to become the Cardinal
linebacker coach, leaving behind
a talent-laden freshman class that
he had hand-picked for San Jose
State.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Kerr performed his recruiting
duties a little too well, and three
members of the SJS recruiting
class of 1983 have come back to
haunt him. Offensive tackle Mike
Barnard, punter Tom Diehl and
fullback Rich Harbison have
moved from obscurity to
prominence while contributing to
the success of Kerr's alma mater
and former employer.
"Leaving (the program at San
Jose State) was hard to a certain
extent," Kerr said. "You like to
coach the kids you recruit.
"I don't look forward to
playing them. Playing them is
hard, because I know them and
their families," he added.
Kerr is far from lamenting his
losses, however. "Working for
Jack has been great for me
professionally," he said. "The
chance to move to Stanford was
professionally the best."
But Kerr also had to face the
prospect of leaving behind
several players he had recruited
— players who would be on the
other side of the field in future
games.
"At first it was a big deal,"
Barnard said of playing against
the man who recruited him.
"Now that's kind of blown over,
(but) I'd still like to beat him."
Barnard, the Spartans' only re
turning offensive lineman, has
logged more playing time than
any of his SJS teammates. The
Sebastopol, Calif., native has
started in 25 games, playing both
left and right tackle with a brief
stint at left guard.
Kerr spotted Barnard's talent
and all but stole the player from
the paws of California. After a
Golden Bears coach cancelled a
planned recruiting visit during
Barnard's senior year, Kerr
seized the opportunity and went
with Elway to the Barnard home
for dinner.
"He presented the school very
well and he told me a lot about
it," Barnard said. "He's a good
recruiter."

Diehl, Barnard's high school
classmate and another Kerr
recruit, has blossomed into one
of the top punters in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association. He
finished second in the conference
in his specialty, averaging 40.7
yards per punt in 1986 with a
season's best of 76 yards. Diehl
was selected second-team All-
PC A A last year.
"I really like Larry a lot," he
said of Kerr, "It would be all the
better to go up there and beat
him, because I know he would be
proud of me if I had a good game.
"I want to beat Stanford
anyway, but I think that would
make it sweeter," Diehl added.
Perhaps the most pleasant

surprise in San Jose State's class
of '88 is Harbison. Recruited by
Kerr as a quarterback, the Spar
tan senior has since played seven
positions, including fullback,
tight end, outside linebacker,
backup quarterback and several
special team assignments.
Harbison has been most af
fected by Kerr's departure.
"When the coaches who
recruited you are here, they
know you better," the senior
said. "When the new coaches
came, there was new re
recruiting."
So although Harbison came to
San Jose State as a quarterback,
Coach ( iaude Gilbert turned him
into a jack-oi-all-trades, making
his road to success all that much
more challenging.
"It is difficult to get a good
grasp on a new position," Har
bison said. However, the com
mon denominator to all of the
positions he has played is that
"you need to react to what's
going on out there," he said.
Though clearly happy at San
Jose State, Harbison remembers
a time in high school when Stan
ford topped his list of colleges.
"Stanford is a great school, and I
wanted to go there," he said. "In
my mind, I thought 'If only I left
(high school) one year later.' "
