# Stanford meets SJSU in Card home debut
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
While the college football na
tional championship will not he
decided for some months, a title
of another sorts is up for grabs in
Stanford Stadium today. When
Stanford and San Jose State take
the field at 3:20 p.m., it will be
the 44th meeting between the two
teams. And as always when the
Cardinal plays the Spartans, the
unofficial title of the South Bay
will be at stake.
Both teams will be looking to
rebound from losses last
weekend, but the two squads are
in different situations.
Stanford comes in with a mark
of 0-2, having lost 31-21 in its
opener at Washington on Sept. 5,
and 31-17 last weekend at
Colorado. The Cardinal will be
looking to halt its skid and gather
some momentum for the rest of
the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule.
San Jose State, meanwhile, is
off to a 2-1 start, having beaten
Eastern Illinois 24-3 and Califor
nia, 27-25, before losing last Sat
urday to Oregon State, 36-34.
Today's game is the Spartans'
final non-league game and they
would like to carry a 3-1 record
into their Pacific Coast Athletic
Association opener next week at
Fullerton State.
Both teams' reputations are
built on their offenses, and Stan
ford and San Jose State have
combined for an average of 50
points a game each of the last
eight times they have met. The

game will showcase the talents of
a pair of Heisman-caliber offen
sive players: San Jose State quar
terback Mike Perez, off to a tor
rid start, and Cardinal tailback
Brad Muster, looking to bounce
back from a nagging ankle injury
that kept him out of most of the
Washington game and all of the
Colorado contest
But defense will probably
make the difference in this year's
South Bay showdown. If either
team can slow down the other's
offense, that should provide a
margin for victory.
Last year, Stanford was led by
its defense, which allowed less
than 15 points per game, second
in the Pac-10. The challenge for
defensive coordinator Dick Man
nini this year is to replace five
graduates, including NFL
draftees Dave Wyman, Tony
Leiker and Toi Cook. The
defense also has to deal with inju
ries to two returning starters.
Left inside linebacker Barry
McKeever has yet to play after
seriously injuring his right knee
during spring drills. He had sur
gery way back on April 29, but
is still questionable for today's
contest. Also injured is corner
back Alan Grant, who hurt his
ankle in the season opener Sept.
5 at Washington. Coach Jack El
way said both are on a "day-to
day" basis.
The Spartan defense was also
strong last year. They were
second only to Oklahoma in
rushing defense, allowing only
