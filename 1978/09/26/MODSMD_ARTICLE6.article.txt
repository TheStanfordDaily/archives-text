# Stanford meets SJSU in Card home debut
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
While the college football na
tional championship will not he
decided for some months, a title
of another sorts is up for grabs in
Stanford Stadium today. When
Stanford and San Jose State take
the field at 3:20 p.m., it will be
the 44th meeting between the two
teams. And as always when the
Cardinal plays the Spartans, the
unofficial title of the South Bay
will be at stake.
Both teams will be looking to
rebound from losses last
weekend, but the two squads are
in different situations.
Stanford comes in with a mark
of 0-2, having lost 31-21 in its
opener at Washington on Sept. 5,
and 31-17 last weekend at
Colorado. The Cardinal will be
looking to halt its skid and gather
some momentum for the rest of
the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule.
San Jose State, meanwhile, is
off to a 2-1 start, having beaten
Eastern Illinois 24-3 and Califor
nia, 27-25, before losing last Sat
urday to Oregon State, 36-34.
Today's game is the Spartans'
final non-league game and they
would like to carry a 3-1 record
into their Pacific Coast Athletic
Association opener next week at
Fullerton State.
Both teams' reputations are
built on their offenses, and Stan
ford and San Jose State have
combined for an average of 50
points a game each of the last
eight times they have met. The

game will showcase the talents of
a pair of Heisman-caliber offen
sive players: San Jose State quar
terback Mike Perez, off to a tor
rid start, and Cardinal tailback
Brad Muster, looking to bounce
back from a nagging ankle injury
that kept him out of most of the
Washington game and all of the
Colorado contest
But defense will probably
make the difference in this year's
South Bay showdown. If either
team can slow down the other's
offense, that should provide a
margin for victory.
Last year, Stanford was led by
its defense, which allowed less
than 15 points per game, second
in the Pac-10. The challenge for
defensive coordinator Dick Man
nini this year is to replace five
graduates, including NFL
draftees Dave Wyman, Tony
Leiker and Toi Cook. The
defense also has to deal with inju
ries to two returning starters.
Left inside linebacker Barry
McKeever has yet to play after
seriously injuring his right knee
during spring drills. He had sur
gery way back on April 29, but
is still questionable for today's
contest. Also injured is corner
back Alan Grant, who hurt his
ankle in the season opener Sept.
5 at Washington. Coach Jack El
way said both are on a "day-to
day" basis.
The Spartan defense was also
strong last year. They were
second only to Oklahoma in
rushing defense, allowing only

l'ree safety Bruce Richardson will he severely tested today hy the right arm of San Jose State Heisman
I rophy candidate Mike Perez. Richardson is second on the Cardinal with 24 tackles so far this season.
65.8 yards per game, but they
only have five starters back.
I hey are led by roverback Greg
Cox, last year s leading tackier,
and inside linebackers Barry
Kidney and Yepi Pauu, this
year's two top tacklers.
San Jose State plays an ag
gresive defense, similar to the
"46" defense made famous by
the 1985 NFL champion Chicago
Bears. The approach is based on
a strong forward push from both
the linemen and the linebackers.
I hey hope to plug all the holes
and penetrate into the backfield
against the run, and generate a
strong rush against the pass.
There are ways to beat the 46
defense. With so many men rush
ing the passer, receivers are
usually covered man-to-man.
I his means that if the quarter
back can get some time, someone
will get open.
I he type of defense they
play, you have to have poise on
the offense," Elway said, adding
that he will not be able to have
every man blocked on every
play, but he hopes for a few big
plays, often possible against an
attacking, gambling defense like
the one the Spartans operate.

Elway also said he plans to use
the short passing game to take
advantage of blitzing lineback
ers, and he will have senior quar
terback Greg Ennis in planned
roll-outs to slow down the rush.
"Greg did a good job (at
Colorado)," Elway said about
Ennis' third career start for the
Cardinal. " He had a better game,
used some good judgment. I have
a whole lot of confidence in
him."
Ennis will likely look to senior
wide receiver Jefl James for big
plays today. James did not catch
a ball against Washington (only
the third time in his Stanford
career that he has gone without
at least one reception), but

rebounded with five catches for
50 yards and a touchdown
against the Buffaloes. He is now
ninth on the Stanford career re
ceptions list, and sixth in career
receiving yardage.
James is looking forward to the
man-to-man coverage expected
from the Spartans. "It's easier to
beat one guy than find the holes
in a zone (defense)," he said.
"The key. of course, is giving the
quarterback enough time."
Elway also places a lot of im
portance on the performance of
the offensive line, which returns
three starters from last year, in
cluding Ail-American candidate
Andy Sinclair at center.
"They're doing fine," Elway
said. "They'll get the acid test

this weekend."
Regarding Stanford's ground
game, injuries is the key word.
Muster won t be at full speed and
both of his backups, sophomores
Jon Volpe and Charlie Young, are
also hurt. But Muster will
definitely play and the other two,
both listed as "day-to-day," may
see action, too. Senior Marshall
Dillard and junior Scott Eschel
man will also join Ennis in the
backfield, especially if the others
remain on the sidelines.
San Jose State's offense is led
by Perez, one of the nation's top
passers. Perez spent two years as
a second-stringer at Taft College,
a school with a running-oriented
offense. After transferring to San
Jose State and redshirting his

first year as a Spartan, he earned
the starting berth last year and
went on to lead the nation in total
offense.
He hasn't slowed down. A
fifth-year senior this season, he is
again atop the NCAA total of
fense list. Perez is averaging 314
yards per game this season and
is one of only two people ever to
average more than 300 yards of
total offense per game for his
career.
His favorite target is slotback
Guy Liggins, who led the Spar
tans with 80 receptions last year,
good for sixth in the country. The
ground attack will he led by
Kenny Jackson, who rushed for
1135 yards last year and caught
52 passes for 356 more yards.

contest. Also injured is corner
back Alan Grant, who hurt his
ankle in the season opener Sept.
5 at Washington. Coach Jack El
way said both are on a "day-to
day" basis.
The Spartan defense was also
strong last year. They were
second only to Oklahoma in
rushing defense, allowing only

l'ree safety Bruce Richardson will he severely tested today hy the right arm of San Jose State Heisman
I rophy candidate Mike Perez. Richardson is second on the Cardinal with 24 tackles so far this season.
65.8 yards per game, but they
only have five starters back.
I hey are led by roverback Greg
Cox, last year s leading tackier,
and inside linebackers Barry
Kidney and Yepi Pauu, this
year's two top tacklers.
San Jose State plays an ag
gresive defense, similar to the
"46" defense made famous by
the 1985 NFL champion Chicago
Bears. The approach is based on
a strong forward push from both
the linemen and the linebackers.
I hey hope to plug all the holes
and penetrate into the backfield
against the run, and generate a
strong rush against the pass.
There are ways to beat the 46
defense. With so many men rush
ing the passer, receivers are
usually covered man-to-man.
I his means that if the quarter
back can get some time, someone
will get open.
I he type of defense they
play, you have to have poise on
the offense," Elway said, adding
that he will not be able to have
every man blocked on every
play, but he hopes for a few big
plays, often possible against an
attacking, gambling defense like
the one the Spartans operate.

Elway also said he plans to use
the short passing game to take
advantage of blitzing lineback
ers, and he will have senior quar
terback Greg Ennis in planned
roll-outs to slow down the rush.
"Greg did a good job (at
Colorado)," Elway said about
Ennis' third career start for the
Cardinal. " He had a better game,
used some good judgment. I have
a whole lot of confidence in
him."
Ennis will likely look to senior
wide receiver Jefl James for big
plays today. James did not catch
a ball against Washington (only
the third time in his Stanford
career that he has gone without
at least one reception), but

rebounded with five catches for
50 yards and a touchdown
against the Buffaloes. He is now
ninth on the Stanford career re
ceptions list, and sixth in career
receiving yardage.
James is looking forward to the
man-to-man coverage expected
from the Spartans. "It's easier to
beat one guy than find the holes
in a zone (defense)," he said.
"The key. of course, is giving the
quarterback enough time."
Elway also places a lot of im
portance on the performance of
the offensive line, which returns
three starters from last year, in
cluding Ail-American candidate
Andy Sinclair at center.
"They're doing fine," Elway
said. "They'll get the acid test

this weekend."
Regarding Stanford's ground
game, injuries is the key word.
Muster won t be at full speed and
both of his backups, sophomores
Jon Volpe and Charlie Young, are
also hurt. But Muster will
definitely play and the other two,
both listed as "day-to-day," may
see action, too. Senior Marshall
Dillard and junior Scott Eschel
man will also join Ennis in the
backfield, especially if the others
remain on the sidelines.
San Jose State's offense is led
by Perez, one of the nation's top
passers. Perez spent two years as
a second-stringer at Taft College,
a school with a running-oriented
offense. After transferring to San
Jose State and redshirting his

first year as a Spartan, he earned
the starting berth last year and
went on to lead the nation in total
offense.
He hasn't slowed down. A
fifth-year senior this season, he is
again atop the NCAA total of
fense list. Perez is averaging 314
yards per game this season and
is one of only two people ever to
average more than 300 yards of
total offense per game for his
career.
His favorite target is slotback
Guy Liggins, who led the Spar
tans with 80 receptions last year,
good for sixth in the country. The
ground attack will he led by
Kenny Jackson, who rushed for
1135 yards last year and caught
52 passes for 356 more yards.
While the college football na
tional championship will not he
decided for some months, a title
of another sorts is up for grabs in
Stanford Stadium today. When
Stanford and San Jose State take
the field at 3:20 p.m., it will be
the 44th meeting between the two
teams. And as always when the
Cardinal plays the Spartans, the
unofficial title of the South Bay
will be at stake.
Both teams will be looking to
rebound from losses last
weekend, but the two squads are
in different situations.
Stanford comes in with a mark
of 0-2, having lost 31-21 in its
opener at Washington on Sept. 5,
and 31-17 last weekend at
Colorado. The Cardinal will be
looking to halt its skid and gather
some momentum for the rest of
the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule.
San Jose State, meanwhile, is
off to a 2-1 start, having beaten
Eastern Illinois 24-3 and Califor
nia, 27-25, before losing last Sat
urday to Oregon State, 36-34.
Today's game is the Spartans'
final non-league game and they
would like to carry a 3-1 record
into their Pacific Coast Athletic
Association opener next week at
Fullerton State.
Both teams' reputations are
built on their offenses, and Stan
ford and San Jose State have
combined for an average of 50
points a game each of the last
eight times they have met. The

game will showcase the talents of
a pair of Heisman-caliber offen
sive players: San Jose State quar
terback Mike Perez, off to a tor
rid start, and Cardinal tailback
Brad Muster, looking to bounce
back from a nagging ankle injury
that kept him out of most of the
Washington game and all of the
Colorado contest
But defense will probably
make the difference in this year's
South Bay showdown. If either
team can slow down the other's
offense, that should provide a
margin for victory.
Last year, Stanford was led by
its defense, which allowed less
than 15 points per game, second
in the Pac-10. The challenge for
defensive coordinator Dick Man
nini this year is to replace five
graduates, including NFL
draftees Dave Wyman, Tony
Leiker and Toi Cook. The
defense also has to deal with inju
ries to two returning starters.
Left inside linebacker Barry
McKeever has yet to play after
seriously injuring his right knee
during spring drills. He had sur
