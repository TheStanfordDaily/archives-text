# Ennis: the latest edition in Stanford QB tradition
## 
### Ken Stevens Editorial staff 
With the likes of John Brodie, Jim
Plunkett, John Elway and John Paye
having guided the Stanford football team
during the past three decades, it is no
wonder that the Cardinal quarterback has
consistently been the most visible player
on the gridiron each Saturday afternoon.
So when Stanford dropped its first two
games of the 1987 season after entering
the campaign with renewed enthusiasm
— the Cardinal was 8-4 in 1986 and com
peted in its first bowl game in eight years
— it was not surprising that the creden
tials of senior quarterback Greg Ennis
became a topic of discussion.
Never mind that running back Brad
Muster, the Pacific 10 Conference Player
of the Year last season, reinjured his left
ankle in the first quarter of the opening
game at Washington and has not played
since.
Never mind that both games have been
on the road against formidable oppo
nents.
Never mind that while Ennis hasn't
made people forget his predecessors, he
has averaged 236.5 yards passing per
game and leads all Cardinal rushers with
an average of 5.4 yards per carry.
Despite all these facts, the search for
an explanation for the Cardinal's
mediocre start inevitably ends up at No.
10, and Ennis himself offers no excuses.
In fact, he may well be his most relentless
critic.
"I haven't played well," Ennis said.
"Even if Brad's out or J.J. (wide receiver
Jeff James) goes out. we've got good
people behind them who can play."
Ennis gives credit to nearly all of his
teammates, saying that the Cardinal has
"great backs," receivers who run good
routes and catch the ball well, and an of
fensive line that has "really kept it to
gether."
He has been frustrated this season by
his own mistakes — namely bad deci
sions which have resulted in four inter
ceptions. "My position's more mental
than it is physical," Ennis said. "I expect
to do the right thing every play, have no
mistakes."
The only thing more important to Ennis
than playing a flawless game is outscoring
the opponent. "If I throw for two yards
and win a game, then I think I was a suc
cess." he said.
Of course, he is now 0-3 in games he

has started at Stanford (including a 27-21
loss to Clemson in last year's Gator
Bowl), and hence the criticism keeps
coming and there are rumors that the Car
dinal coaching staff may replace Ennis in
the starting lineup.
"That's the coaches' decision," Ennis
said. "I'm just out there working on
myself. I'm not worried about it. If
people want to talk about it, that's their
prerogative. I don't think about it.
"If people want to criticize, they can
criticize. I take it with a grain of salt.
About the only people I really listen to
are my head coach and myself."
If Ennis were to listen to his
teammates, he would find that they are
not among his critics.
"You've got to understand that Stan
ford's been blessed with tremendous
quarterbacks, and the fans, they're going
to expect a certain level of play." senior
center Andy Sinclair said. "Greg's come
here, and he's learned the system, and
he's done a good job. He's the guy, and
as far as criticism. . the team supports
him, and the team knows he's the guy.
That's pretty much the bottom line."
The Cardinal's 0-2 start can be attrib
uted to inconsistency across the board,
not solely at the quarterback position, ac
cording to Sinclair. "He (Ennis) has done
the job. and then other people let down.
And then he's let down. It goes back and
forth. We all have to play at the same
level."
Ennis may not be looking over his
shoulder fearing demotion, but he
realizes that a win today against San Jose
State is almost essential for Stanford.
"Our backs are against the wall," he
said. "We want to go out and get a win,
play like we can play. The last two games
we beat ourselves."
With Muster and sophomore Charlie
Young returning to the backfield and
James healthy after missing the fourth
quarter against Colorado with a hip
pointer, Ennis' job should be easier
today. He knows, however, that he. as
well as his teammates, will have to per
form better than they have so far this
season if they are to defeat the Spartans.
"San Jose State lives for this game."
he said. "They're going to come in three
feet off the ground, so it's going to be in
teresting. It's going to be a war."
And having lost his first three battles
while serving as the commander-in-chief
of the Cardinal, Ennis is certainly ready
for a victory.

In fact, he may well be his most relentless
critic.
"I haven't played well," Ennis said.
"Even if Brad's out or J.J. (wide receiver
Jeff James) goes out. we've got good
people behind them who can play."
Ennis gives credit to nearly all of his
teammates, saying that the Cardinal has
"great backs," receivers who run good
routes and catch the ball well, and an of
fensive line that has "really kept it to
gether."
He has been frustrated this season by
his own mistakes — namely bad deci
sions which have resulted in four inter
ceptions. "My position's more mental
than it is physical," Ennis said. "I expect
to do the right thing every play, have no
mistakes."
The only thing more important to Ennis
than playing a flawless game is outscoring
the opponent. "If I throw for two yards
and win a game, then I think I was a suc
cess." he said.
Of course, he is now 0-3 in games he

has started at Stanford (including a 27-21
loss to Clemson in last year's Gator
Bowl), and hence the criticism keeps
coming and there are rumors that the Car
dinal coaching staff may replace Ennis in
the starting lineup.
"That's the coaches' decision," Ennis
said. "I'm just out there working on
myself. I'm not worried about it. If
people want to talk about it, that's their
prerogative. I don't think about it.
"If people want to criticize, they can
criticize. I take it with a grain of salt.
About the only people I really listen to
are my head coach and myself."
If Ennis were to listen to his
teammates, he would find that they are
not among his critics.
"You've got to understand that Stan
ford's been blessed with tremendous
quarterbacks, and the fans, they're going
to expect a certain level of play." senior
center Andy Sinclair said. "Greg's come
here, and he's learned the system, and
he's done a good job. He's the guy, and
as far as criticism. . the team supports
him, and the team knows he's the guy.
That's pretty much the bottom line."
The Cardinal's 0-2 start can be attrib
uted to inconsistency across the board,
not solely at the quarterback position, ac
cording to Sinclair. "He (Ennis) has done
the job. and then other people let down.
And then he's let down. It goes back and
forth. We all have to play at the same
level."
Ennis may not be looking over his
shoulder fearing demotion, but he
realizes that a win today against San Jose
State is almost essential for Stanford.
"Our backs are against the wall," he
said. "We want to go out and get a win,
play like we can play. The last two games
we beat ourselves."
With Muster and sophomore Charlie
Young returning to the backfield and
James healthy after missing the fourth
quarter against Colorado with a hip
pointer, Ennis' job should be easier
today. He knows, however, that he. as
well as his teammates, will have to per
form better than they have so far this
season if they are to defeat the Spartans.
"San Jose State lives for this game."
he said. "They're going to come in three
feet off the ground, so it's going to be in
teresting. It's going to be a war."
And having lost his first three battles
while serving as the commander-in-chief
of the Cardinal, Ennis is certainly ready
for a victory.

Senior quarterback (ireg Funis is making his first start at Stanford Stadium today. Knnis
is third in the Pacific 10 Conference in total offense, averaging 274 yards per game.
With the likes of John Brodie, Jim
Plunkett, John Elway and John Paye
having guided the Stanford football team
during the past three decades, it is no
wonder that the Cardinal quarterback has
consistently been the most visible player
on the gridiron each Saturday afternoon.
So when Stanford dropped its first two
games of the 1987 season after entering
the campaign with renewed enthusiasm
— the Cardinal was 8-4 in 1986 and com
peted in its first bowl game in eight years
— it was not surprising that the creden
tials of senior quarterback Greg Ennis
became a topic of discussion.
Never mind that running back Brad
Muster, the Pacific 10 Conference Player
of the Year last season, reinjured his left
ankle in the first quarter of the opening
game at Washington and has not played
since.
Never mind that both games have been
on the road against formidable oppo
nents.
Never mind that while Ennis hasn't
made people forget his predecessors, he
has averaged 236.5 yards passing per
game and leads all Cardinal rushers with
an average of 5.4 yards per carry.
Despite all these facts, the search for
an explanation for the Cardinal's
mediocre start inevitably ends up at No.
10, and Ennis himself offers no excuses.
In fact, he may well be his most relentless
critic.
"I haven't played well," Ennis said.
