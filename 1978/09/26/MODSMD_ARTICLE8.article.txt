# San Jose State — Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
San Jose State

Spartan quarterback Mike
Perez has thrown for 928 yards in
three games this year, and will be
looking to add to that number
today. He will be facing a Stan
ford secondary with only two re
turning starters — Brad
Humphreys and Alan Grant. The
starters in the other two spots are
senior Bruce Richardson and
junior Brad Cook. Cook is
making his third start for Stan
ford after transferring from Snow
College in Ephraim, Utah.
Having already faced Washing
ton gunslinger Chris Chandler
and now going against Perez, he
is getting a very quick introduc
tion to major-college football.

The key to stopping Perez is
t'oreing him to get rid of the hall
before he wants to. A good Stan
ford rush, led by junior taekle
Lester Arehambeau (who piled
up a team-high 17 tackles versus
Colorado), should make the
Stanford secondary's task easier.
San Jose State right guard An
thony Galiegos will see a lot of
Arehambeau today. Galiegos
redshirted as a freshman last year
and is playing in only his third
college game.

Cardinal quarterback Greg En
nis will be making his first start at
Stanford Stadium. He will be
going against a tough Spartan
defense led by senior roverbaek
Greg Cox, San Jose State's
leading tackier last year. Cox will
likely do everything from blitzing
to covering receivers deep; if Kn
nis docs not keep track of him.
the Cardinal offense could be in
for a long day.

Barry Kidney is the Spartans'
leading tackier this year, and
teaming with the other inside
linebacker, Yepi Fauu, is very
tough against the run. Because of
injuries to key players, Stan
ford's running game has almost
disappeared this season, but
much-heralded tailback Brad
Muster, trying to come back
from an ankle sprain, will proba
bly start today. The Heisman
Trophy candidate is capable of
carrying the ball 35 times a game
and can take a lot of pressure off
the passing game.

San Jose State's last two
games have been decided in the
last minute of play, and if today's
game is also close, a placekicker
may decide the outcome. The
Spartans have senior Sergio
Olivarez, who finished 14th in
the nation in kicking last year
with 16 field goals. Stanford will
send out freshman John Hop
kins, who took the starting job
away from senior David
Sweeney. Hopkins is known for
very deep kickofTs and converted
a 27-yard field goal in his only at
tempt against Colorado.

The noscguard anchors the de
fensive line, and the Spartans'
noseguard is senior Larry
Sandson. He is the only returning
starter in San Jose State's defen
sive line, but he will have to go
against Stanford senior Andy
Sinclair. Sinclair is a two-year
starter and was a preseason
Sport Magazine All-America
pick.
