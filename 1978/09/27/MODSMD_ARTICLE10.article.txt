# New Daily cartoonist replaces Peanuts
## 
### 
The Daily is happy to
bring to its readers a new
cartoon strip called
Dupie. This new strip will
replace Peanuts, which
was canceled yesterday
by United Features due
to an exclusivity claim by
the San Francisco
Chronicle.
The originator of
Dupie is Gil Morales, a
sophomore member of
the Alpha Delt House.
The strip will run daily
and is an exclusive of The
Stanford Daily. We hope
you enjoy Dupie and we
invite your response to
this new feature.
