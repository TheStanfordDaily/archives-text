## David Miller Third party vote not wasted 
### 
Those voters who suspect that Jerry Brown is
more style than substance and who doubt
whether Evelle Younger possesses either style
or substance might seriously consider voting for
a third-party candidate in the up-coming
California gubernatorial election.
There is a common feeling that to vote for a
third party is to throw away one's vote. The
reality is more nearly the precise opposite:
votes for a third party can have an influence far
out of proportion to their numbers.
Third parties can introduce new issues and
ideas into political disucssion: e.g., it is often
remarked that many of the Socialist planks at the
turn of the century were eventually accepted by
both major parties.
If a third party succeeds in holding the ba
lance of power or if it is perceived as articulating
rising mass discontent, its effective power can
even surpass that of larger parties, 112 or good or
ill, those who voted for George Wallace in 196W
have had greater influence ori recent history
than those who voted for either Nixon or Hum
phrey.
Nor should it be forgotten that the tenure of
the major parties need not be eternal. It is pos
sible for a minor party to replace one of the
major parties — as happened when the Republi
cans supplantecJ the Whigs.
The Democratic coalition of the New Deal era
is collapsing; Jimmy Carter propped it up only
by using the ties of sentiment to draw back
Southern whites. The COP's voter identification
is pitifully small; its prospective chances for
gaining control of either house of Congress are
nil.
We may, in short, be in a period, like that of
century ago, involving major political realign
ments. One of today's minor parties may be one
of the major parties of tomorrow.
An especially intersting third-party candidate
in the coming California gubernatorial election
is the Libertarian Party's Fd Clark; Clark is the
first gubernatorial candidate in California his
tory to acheive ballot status through popular
petition.
Put crudely, a libertarian is a person who finds

George McGovern too conservative on civil
liberties and foreign policy and Ronald Reagan
too liberal on economic and fiscal matters.
Clark (unlike Brown or Younger) and other
libertarians were strong supporters of Proposi
tion 11 well before its overwhelming victory in
June; San Francisco libertarians are co-sponsors
of that city's November referendum calling for
non-enforcement of the marijuana laws in the
city.
Since its founding in 1971 during the depths of
the Nixon regime, the Libertarian Party has been
the nation's fastest growing political party.
Among those parties running a Presidential
candidate in 1976, the Liberatarians were sur
passed in the popular vote only by the Republi
cans and Democrats. (Gene McCarthy ran as an
independent without party affiliation.)
The Libertarians see themselves as a party of
principle and as the only party unswervingly de
dicated to human rights. Their 1978 national
platform calls for the abolition of taxation, the
repeal of all laws against victimless crimes (drug
use, prostitution, gambling, etc.) and the par
don of all persons currently imprisoned under
such laws, the cessation of involuntary mental
hospitalization, an end to the harassing of illegal
aliens and to restrictions on immigraiton, and
the dismantling of the economy of privilege —
protective tariffs and quotas, government sub
sidies, government-enforced monopolies and
cartels — so beloved of American businessmen.
Liber tarians insist that each person has an ina
lienable right to attempt to live his life in accord
with his own values and that the only just powers
possessed by government are those ceded it by
the free consent of the governed. They demand
only that agents of government be compelled to
show the same respect for human rights that is
routinely shown by nearly everyone else.
For an electorate which increasingly sees gov
ernment as intrusive and unresponsive and
which is beginning to reject the paternalism of
both conservatives and liberals, the Libertarians
seem to have the potential of offering a real
alternative.
