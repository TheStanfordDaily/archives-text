## Congress should adopt Carter energy plan 
### 
It will demand the best of us, ourvision, our dedica
tion, our courage and our sense of common purpose.
President Jimmy Carter
April 18, 1977
Today, Wednesday September 27, 1978, a mere 17
months after President Carter declared the "moral
equivalent of war" against our energy crisis, the U.S.
Senate is scheduled to register its final vote on a
natural gas bill. This compromise bill may finally set
forth Carter's long awaited national energy plan.
Why must Americans accept the President's for
boding demand to conserve, work for efficiency and
in a phrase "use less and pay more"? Why this sense
of urgency today?
The immediate result of the 1973 crisis was not to
conserve but rather to seek out the cause of this
inconvenient occurence. Americans dreamed up
three potential vidians. First, the "greedy Arabs"
were trying to deprive America of its natural right to
oil. Then the giant oil conglomerates were plotting to
raise the price of gasoline (which may well be true).
And more recently the blame has shifted to big gov
ernment and the Washington bureaucrats who work
at the mercy of special interest groups and constantly
interfere with the flawless free market.
No doubt, each of these three groups have had
some effect upon the current energy pinch (most
notably the quadrupling of foreign oil prices by OPEC
in 1973). However, in each case the real villain has
escaped recognition, and so we are faced today with
the harsh realization that energy is scarce because we
Americans wasted it and continue to waste it and
because we Americans have yet to comprehend that
this is a world of limited resources.
Accepting the fact that we do live in a world of
diminishing and limited resources, the question is
how to limit demand and achieve optimal conserva
tion and use of energy. Three potential answers are
commonly offered: (1) free market price equilibrium,
(2) egalitarian methods of rationing, and (3) increased
government excise taxes and subsidies.
The first answer is the standard laissez-faire
economic solution. It is propounded by Stanford's
Milton Friedman. Friedman reiterates the old warn
ing — TANSTAAFL (There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch). If we want more energy, we'll have to pay the
price. Friedman further suggests that we just let the
free market take care of conservation. Let prices rise
unhampered by government regulation and sub
sidies, and the much heralded laws of supply and
demand will squeeze out energy inefficiency. Unfor
tunately, as good an economist as Milton Friedman is,
he forgets that such a "cold-turkey" (Paul Samuel
son's phrase) move back to the free market would be
political and economic suicide. The American

people, organized labor, and business would not
stand for it. The poor would be the first and the
hardest hit. Unemployment would skyrocket in all
industries which require oil for production and the
entire economy would spiral into chaos. The argu
ment is that a rising tide raises all ships.
The proposal for rationing has not been widely
accepted as it raises serious questions of efficiency
and fairness. Even if rationing could be established
without problems of enforcement, bureaucratic
waste, and black markets, the question stil! arises
over who's to get how much and on what basis.
Granted, rationing could limit consumption to avail
able supplies by depriving all consumers and indus
tries equally, but it would most likely maintain the
present artificially low prices and merely forestall the
necessary adjustments to the energy situation.

... we are faced today with the
harsh realization that energy is
scarce because we Americans
wasted it and continue to waste it
.. . because we Americans have
yet to comprehend that this is a
world of limited resources.

Increasing the use of government excise taxes and
subsidies provides a partial answer to the problem of
conservation and efficiency. Tax subsidies and re
bates can be used to encourage efficient uses of
energy, while prohibitory taxes can be used to dis
courage energy abuse and waste. This answer sounds
simple but in fact it becomes quite complex. An intri
cate web of measures and counter-measures must be
enacted. Indeed each tax can have manifold reper
cussions. For example, the formerly proposed 5 cent
stand-by gasoline tax might have ended up becoming
a disincentive to the poor alone, requiring another
system of tax refunds and subsidy assistance.
The free market, rationing, tax incentives or any
single program in itself cannot offer a viable answer
to the energy problem. An effective national energy
policy calls for a complex, interwoven combination of
many policies tying together the efficiency of the free
market, the egalitarianism of a rationing system and
the workabiltiy of taxes. This brings us to the Carter
proposal presently debated in Congress.
Carter's plan is clearly a policy of "use less, pay
more" to be achieved through a combination of pat

riotic appeal and economic incentives. Calling forth
the resevoirs of American energy stored within our
sense of patriotism, the President warned America,
"This is the greatest challenge our nation will face in
our lifetime."
Symbolic challenges are fine, but Carter realizes
that when it comes to actual action, you can't beat
dollars and cents motivation. Through tax rebates the
President's plan would encourage small car sales and
insulation of both businesses and homes as well as
installation of home solar-heating equipment. Re
strictive taxes would be used to discourage the pro
duction and sale of the famed gas guzzler.
Oil price restrictions will be gradually decreased
allowing the price of "old oil" ($5.17 a barrel) to reach
the world price of about $15 by 1980 and the price of
newly discovered oil ($11.28 a barrel) to reach the
1977 world price level over a three-year period. In-,
terstate and intrastate natural gas price discrepancies
would eventually be eliminated.
Utilities would be forced to phase out "promo
tional rates" which provide discounts for large
energy users and encourage waste. In addition, Car
ter promises to use highly prohibitive taxes to en
courage industry and utility plants to convert from oil
and natural gas to coal.
The plan provides slow and incremental steps to
ward gasoline price deregulation and a gradual return
to freemarket price levels for most energy sources.
Furthermore, there are provisions to insure that the
poor receive tax subsidies and assistance to help
them adjust to the higher energy prices.
The Carter plan is clearly far from flawless. There is
little emphasis on increasing energy supplies or en
couraging production and development of new
energy sources. The issues of protecting the envi
ronment has been ignored as evidenced by the provi
sion which would increase production of highly pol
luting coal by 400 million tons per year. The President
also wishes to increase economic growth to 6 percent
while decreasing the annual energy consumption
growth rate to two percent — these two goals may
prove to be directly in conflict.
The President's plan is, however, a step in the right
direction. For the first time in our history the nation
has an attempt of a comprehensive national energy
policy. Carter has attacked the problem of conserva
tion with a two-sided sword — with both substance
and style.
It can only be our hope that today will mark the end
of that debate, that the substance of the President's
plan be adopted and practiced, that we accept the
urgency of our energy problems and that together we
work toward their solution.
