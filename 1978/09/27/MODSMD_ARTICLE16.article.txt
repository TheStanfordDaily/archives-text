## District of Columbia not a state 
### 
The issue of just representation for the citizens of Washington,
D.C., has been around since 1800, and is based on well-founded
notions of "simple justice" and "human rights." However, Con
gress badly botched the job when it addressed the problem last
month.
In 1800 Congress created the District of Columbia from parts of
Maryland and Virginia, and unjustifiably removed the right to
vote from its residents. For years, residents lacked a voice in both
national and local affairs. Finally, in 1961, District residents were
allowed to vote for President. In 1970, the District was allotted
one non-voting delegate in Congress; it has also been allowed
some measure of home rule, though Congress still retains exclu
sive jurisdiction over all District affairs.
Congress sought to remedy this unfair situation by proposing a
constituional amendment that would grant the District con
gressmen, senators, and ratification rights of proposed constitu
tional amendments; for these purposes, "the district. . .shall be
treated as though it were a state." The exercise of these rights is to
"be by the people of the district. . .
The amendment, as proposed, is badly written and ambiguous.
For example, ratification of constitutional amendments is nor
mally done by state legislatures, but the District has none. Would
the City Council now be like a state legislature, or would the
residents vote directly on such proposals? Both procedures
would be unprecedented.
The amendment also may conflict with Article V of the Con
stitution, which provides that "no state, without its consent, shall
be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate." Though the
thrust of this provision is to prohibit the removal or addition of
senators to and from states, granting voting rights to a non-state
arguably also upsets the equal suffrage of the states.
More fundamentally, there is no reason to grant the Distict —
as the District — two senators, etc. The initial reasons for giving
two senators to every state does not apply, and the District lacks
the legal and diverse characteristics of other states that would
give it an equitable claim to state status.
The granting of two senators to each state, regardless of popu
lation, was the result of a political compromise necessary to form
the Union. The District was artificially (and rather irrationally)
carved out of two states after that compromise, and without any
reference to it; the raison d'etre for two senators per state is
simply inapplicable. Giving the District, because it is the District,
two senators is as logical as carving out the 11 more populous
cities than the District and granting them each two senators. The
p oposed amendment artificially expands an irrelevant political
compromise to an artificial and irrational creation.

Furthermore, the District is not the legal equivalent of any
other state. It does not have sovereignty over its own affairs, as do
states. The constitution grunts Congress the "power to exercise
exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such dis
trict. . . The District governs itself only at the suffrance of
Congress; any District Senators would be captives of the majority
party. Nor is the District recognized by the full faith and credit
clause, the reserved powers of Article X, the restrictions of the
14th Amendment, etc.
Finally, the District lacks the diversity that characterizes most
other states. It has no agriculture, manufacturing, or other regu
lar business. Rather, its sole function is the bureaucratic regula
tion of American life. And unlike states, the District has no ba
lance between taxpayers and taxtakers: 64 percent of the voting
age residents are federal employees, others are District
employees, and still others receive federal employees, others are
District employees, and still others receive federal transfer pay
ments.

The District lacks the . . . characteristics
that would give it . . . state status.

Thus the proposed amendment is simply the wrong way to go
— an irrational creation is to be treated like a state even though
the reasons for granting two Senators to every state are inapplic
able, the District has none of the legal attributes or the
sovereignty of states, and it lacks the diverse make-up of most
states.
Flowever, the problem of just representation remains. The
most reasonable solution would be to eliminate the initial artifi
ciality of 1800 and retrocede the area to Maryland (or Virginia).
Residents would then have voting rights equivalent to everyone
else — at the local, state, and national levels. Or the District could
be kept under federal jurisdiction and be granted a Con
gressman, with the residents voting for Senators in any state they
choose. Other alternatives are also available, and could be consi
dered.
The real issue is not whether District residents deserve the right
to vote for congressman and senators— they have for 178 years.
Rather, the conflict is over the method of granting such represen
tation. Congress blew it, and should be forced to come back with
a more reasonable approach.
