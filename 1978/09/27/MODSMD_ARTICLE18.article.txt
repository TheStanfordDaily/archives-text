# Mideast summit talks end
## Opinions differ on chance for success 
### HRI WEISS 
Agreements produced at the
Camp David summit talks have
brought hope to the stale
mated peace initiative begun
by Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat last November during his
trip to Jerusalem.
Whether the two agree
ments, signed by Sadat, Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and President Carter,
will bring peace to the Middle
East is a question only to be
answered in time.
Thirteen days of negotia
tions produced a framework
for peace and for future
negotiations. The first agree
ment presents a general
framework that would enable
Israel, Jordan, and the Palesti
nians to resolve, over a five
year period, the final status of
the West Bank and Gaza strip
occupied by Israel during the
1967 war.
The second agreement is a

separate peace treaty between
Israel and Egypt. Israel pledged
to withdraw completely from
occupied Sinai in exchange for
full diplomatic recognition by
the Egyptian government.
Unsettled issues
Despite these agreements,
major issues remain unresol
ved. Jerusalem, a city of three
religious faiths, is claimed by
Israel. Sadat, however, insists
that East Jerusalem be returned
to Arab sovereignty. The fate of
the homeless Palestinians scat
tered throughout Arab ter
ritories remains unresolved. In
addition, the future of the
Golan Heights, an Israeli
occupied area of strategic im
portance within Syria, was not
discussed.
Reactions here to the sum
mit developments have been
mixed. Rabbi Mark Cartun, di
rector of Stanford Hillel, ag
rees with other Jewish leaders
that Israel is unlikely to give up

Jerusalem or any of the 65 set
tlements on the West Bank.
He also said that he cannot
"conceive of either Israel or
any Palestinian state without
Jerusalem."
Several students here agree
with this sentiment. "Israel
would never abandon the right
of Jews to settle in Jerusalem.
Why can't the Palestinians go
somewhere else? Why should
Israel suffer?" said Moshe Ael
ion, an Israeli graduate stu
dent.
Jerusalem concern
The unresolved Jerusalem
question and other undecided
issues concern many foreign
policy experts who sense that
disagreements will again sur
face before problems are sol
ved.
However, Professor Alexan
der George, a specialist here in
foreign policy and diplomacy,
said he sees the willingness to
leave issues unsolved as a sign

of Sadat's and Begin's maturity.
"They are able to set aside
major problems for future re
solution rather than letting
them become stumbling
blocks to the negotiation pro
cess as in the past," George
said.
Hoover Institution specialist
on the Mideast Michel Nabti,
a native of Lebanon, disagreed.
"Between the three leaders,
major differences remain.
Beyond the gestures, truth is
going to show. Differences will
soon emerge," Nabti said.
Nabti said he believes the
Palestinian question was com
pletely ignored at the summit
talks.
"You just cannot ignore the
Palestinians," he said.
Cartun and Seymour Martin
Lipset, professor of political
science and sociology here,
agree that Sadat and Begin are
ready to assure peace in the
Mideast.

"Once Sadat signs a peace
treaty, then it will be all over.
Sadat would not have gone so
far in the summit talks if he did
not intend to sign a peace tre
aty," Cartun said.
"Begin's assumption that
Egypt wanted peace has paid
off," Lipset said.
Arab participation
Though the initial reaction to
the Camp David talks has been
negative in Arab parts of the
world, some feel Jordan-and
Saudi Arabia may participate in
the agreements eventually.
"Why should these Aral)
states jump on an agreement
when they can use their, bar
gaining leverage to keep Israel
from backtracking?" Professor
George said.
"There will be ups and
downs in the peace process.
But at least it is now two steps
forward and one step back
ward and not the other way
around," George added.

Maybe they're cooling off after waiting in the long lines at Memorial
Auditorium. Or perhaps these girls are just enjoying the last days of
summer before homework days set in. They all seem to agree that
Tanner Fountian should be more than something to look at.
