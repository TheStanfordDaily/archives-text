# Twins born of different fathers
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The birth
of twins, doctors say, is a rare
event — an 80-1 longshot. But
twins were born near here re
cently under circumstances
virtually unchronicled in medi
cal history. Each child was
fathered by a different man.
The bizarre case came to
light because the twins'
mother filed a paternity suit
against one of the men. To
prove he had fathered the
twins, she consulted Dr. Paul
Terasaki, a UCLA im
munologist who uses an ad
vanced tissue typing system to
determine fatherhood.
Since developing his tissue
typing method, Terasaki has
used it to settle more than 2500
paternity cases. This one
seemed routine.
The doctor matched the al
leged father's tissue "finger
prints," identifying keys called
antigens found in the white
blood cells, with one of the
twins. But the antigens of the
second twin did not match.
"This was the first time we've
ever encountered it," Terasaki
said in an interview last Wed
nesday. "We haven't been ex
pecting that. I was surprised."
The odds against his system
being wrong, he said, were
140,000-to-1.
The phenomenon of twins
having different fathers, called
superfecundity, requires very
special circumstances.
For twins to be sired by sepa
rate fathers requires the eggs
to be released hours apart dur
ing separate acts of inter
course.
