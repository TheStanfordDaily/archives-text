# Use of fictitious name permits rescinded for Stanford Hospital
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
MediCal reimbursements are still
being made to Stanford University
Hospital even though permits au
thorizing these payments have been
rescinded by the Board of Medical
Quality Assurance (BMQA).
MediCal workers today confirmed
that group provider numbers for
nine of the hospital's clinics are still
active and that reimbursements are
being made to the Hospital on a regu
lar basis.
Spokesmen added that no Medi-
Cal investigations into the Hospital's
practices are currently underway and
that MediCal's last investigations
into the Hospital's billing procedures
occurred from 1966 to 1970. No exp
lanation of the investigations were
given.
The Hospital's fictitious name
permits, which have enabled the
Hospital to bill MediCal through de
partmental names instead of through
individual physicians' names, were
rescinded by the BMQA last week
because the University had not com
pleted its application form.
"We had already issued the per
mits when we discovered Stanford
had not completed one portion of
the application and subsequently,
we rescinded those permits," said
Robert Rowland, executive director
of the BMQA.
He added that issuing fictitious
name permits is usually "a very
routine clerical job."
The blank spot in the University's
application deals with a controversial
topic being investigated by the
BMQA â€” is the medical practice at
the University wholly owned and
controlled by practicing faculty
physicians?
"In my opinion we could have said
yes to that question," Hitchner said.
"The faculty determines who they
see, when they see and when they
bill. However, certain faculty mem
bers might say otherwise."
So instead of answering the ques
tion) University officials left that por

tion of the application blank and
explained the situation in a space
provided.
The University has a choice of fil
ling in the blank portion and resub
mitting the application or changing
the entire billing system to an indi
vidual provider account.
"In this case we would send a
separate invoice for each physician
who sees the patient instead of bil
ling by department," Hitchner said.

"There wouldn't be any change in
amounts of reimbursements, there
would just be more invoices sent."
Hitchner said it would cost the
University more to bill for each indi
vidual physician and added it would
"probably be more expensive for
MediCal too."
A decision on which billing proce
dure to use will be made in about two
weeks, Hitchner said.
