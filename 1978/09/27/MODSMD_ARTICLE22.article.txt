# SAT scores decline again in California
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — California
high school seniors scored
slightly below the national av
erage last spring on a standar
dized college entrance exami
nation, state officials reported
last week.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) results showed Califor
nia students two points below
the national average in both
verbal skills — grammar, read
ing comprehension, and voc
abulary — and mathematics.
The multiple-choice test,
taken by most college-bound
12th-graders, is scored from
200 to 800. The national aver
age was 429 in verbal skills, the
same as last year, and 468 in
mathematics, down two points
from last year.
California scores were 427
in verbal skills, unchanged
from last year and 466 in
mathematics, down four
points. The state Department
of Education said about 100,000
California students took the
test.
Boys outscored girls in each
category. In California boys
averaged 432 in verbal to 423
for girls, and 496 in math to 440
for girls. Nationally the figures
were 433-425 in verbal and
494-444 in math.
Officials said SAT scores
have been declining in Califor
nia as well as nationally for
more than 11 years. The last
time state scores were above
the national level in both
categories was in the spring of
1975.
The findings are consistent
with scores of other tests,
given to all students whether
college-bound or not, showing
California behind national
norms in the sixth and 12th
grades but above them in sec
ond and third g-udes.
State school Superintendent
Wilson Riles said the current
difference between the state
and national figures was "in
significant" statistically, but he
was disturbed by the scores.
