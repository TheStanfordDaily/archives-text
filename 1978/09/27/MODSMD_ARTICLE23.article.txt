# Starting year two at 500 watts KZSU continues to expand
## 
### JOHN NIELSEN Senior staff writer 
Until late last year, KZSU broadcast at 10 watts.
Their range was limited to Stanford, Palo Alto
proper and the fringes of Mountain View. Recep
tion in a car was mediocre at best, very few per
sons outside the University community had a
chance to pay attention, and the ZOO was first and
foremost a "college" radio station.
Things have changed.
In May of 1978, KZSU went to 500 watts â€” to
South San Francisco, most of San Jose, across the
bay to Hayward, and north into Berkeley. The LA
radio dial is not threatened by 500 watts, as major
stations run closer to 50,000, but a 50-fold increase
is considerable, and it has had a considerable ef
fect.
"The focus of what we did was a lot smaller
then," explained Chief Announcer Bob Svikhart.
"Stanford was our only committment, and our
only responsibility in the eyes of the Federal
Communications Commission. Now we reach
more communities, and its been necessary to en
large our attentions some to adjust to the change
in audience. Its not like we have to play Muzak all
the time, but there's been considerable reorgani
zation."

A glance at the KZSU office under the Drama
Department at the northeast end of the campus
illustrates the "considerable" in Svikhart's com
ment. To make way for expanding news and public
affairs departments, the station recently played a
huge game of "musical rooms," the result being
that nearly everything is in the process of becom
ing something else. What used to be a news office
will soon house a greatly expanded record library,
and a large former lounge will soon be converted
to a newsroom. Walls are being ripped out, or up,
to accommodate the new floor plan, and there
have been rumors that a second broadcast booth
is only a few years off.
Station Manager Tom Price was the first to admit
that such things cost.
"We'll certainly be needing more money," he
said, "and since we're still a non-profit station
we'll have to get a large part of it from the stu
dents." To get that money, KZSU began gathering
petitions last Monday for a special one-dollar
winter fee assessment to appear on the October
ballot.
"If the COP approves the whole thing, it has a
good chance of passing," said Price. "We haven't
had much trouble getting signatures."
Changes in student interest in working at KZSU

indicate that the station's expansion is having an
effect outside the office.
"Everybody wants to work here," said Price.
"Far more tha. in recent years. And more people
have been coming in from off-campus as well.
Ve've increased our profile, I guess, and the size
of our audience. Apparently many more people
want to be a part of that."
The change to 500 watts has also helped bring
more attention from the radio industry and from
those interested in holding the interest of the
radio industry.
"Bill Graham called and wants to establish a
regular ticket giveaway," said Programming Direc
tor Mike Lopez, 'and we've been contacted by
every candidate for a locally relevant political of
fice. Promoters are stepping up their contacts. The
record industry is in better contact. We're defi
nitely getting more attention."
And Lopez, Svikhart and Price agree that the
most important result of the power change at
KZSU has been in its usefulness as a stepping
stone for those interested in media careers. "We
already have a long list of alumni who've been
successful in the media," said Lopes, "from local
radio stations to CBS News, and the changes tak
ing place are sure to make it longer."

KZSU, 90.1 FM, is currently preparing to enter its first
full year as a 500 watt radio station. Tne power increase
has been accompanied by much reorganization. Soon
the news office (above left) will house a record library
triple the present size. The changes are designed to
enable "the Zoo" to more effectively serve a potential
audience of nearly two million. Station Manager Tom
Price (below left), who announced yesterday that KZSU
will seek a special winter quarter fee assessment, is
shown at work in the station's broadcasting booth be
neath the Little Theater. Those interested in working for
KZSU are encouraged to attend the station's first organi
zational meeting today, at 7:30 p.m. in Bishop Au
ditorium in the business school or to drop by the station.
