# Margerum takes the field with dedication
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
Most football players are known for
the yardage they compile in a game,
the number of points they wrack up
on the board or the key blocks they
throw in the field.
Although Cardinal split end Ken
Margerum has gained recognition for
the usual accomplishments, he's
known best to his teammates by his
nickname Buffy, and the enlarged
index finger that garnishes his left
hand.
"No one even knows my real name
on the team," Margerum said.
"(James) Lofton started calling me
Buffy last year because I looked like
the guy on Family Affair
The enlarged finger that Margerum
said, jokingly, makes him catch bet
ter, was acquired when the sopho
more from Fountain Valley caught his
finger in a car door years ago.
So with his trademarks established
and his nickname bestowed,
Margerum is out to build his own
reputation.
Following two superior receivers
that were drafted into the pros (Bill
Kellar went to the Kansas City Chiefs
and Lofton to the Green Bay Packers),
Margerum is more appreciative than'
disappointed that he didn't play much
his freshman year. "I learned a lot
from watching," he said. "I picked up
the instincts of receiving, to learn the
best routes against the coverage and
how to find openings." This year
Margerum is learning by doing.
During the summer, the 6-foot-1,
185 pounder practiced two hours a

night, Monday through Friday, with
Stanford quarterback Steve Dils. He
sacrificed his summer vacation,
caught about 200 passes each day and
came onto the field in August feeling
comfortable with Dils' soft passes he
can catch with his hands rather than
his whole body.
With the same dedication,
Margerum has hit the weights hard for
the last three years so "I can take the
punishment." Now benching 325
pounds, Margerum said the weights
have undoubtedly helped with his
blocking strength — which he needs
on those plays where the backs re
ceive the passes rather than the split
end.
His enthusiasm to excel originated
in high school and has been essential
in driving Margerum always toward
the win.
"Losing, I hate," he said. "Even
after the Oklahoma game (where he
caught six passes for 74 yards and two
TDs) it was hard to face my parents
and friends. It's so much easier to talk
about a win." That attitude benefited
the four-sport star in high school
where he won every track event he
entered and excelled in football, bas
ketball and baseball. He's competing
in track in college also as the Card's
No. 1 hurdler and an alternate in the
400 relay. "I realize it's almost impos
sible to go undefeated in college, but I
never want to get used to losing."
That's why when Margerum drops a
pass (which he's only done once this
year), he wants "to dig a hole. If I drop
one pass, no matter how well I've

played I don't think I've had a good
game."
Margerum was especially gratified
in the San Jose State game when he
caught a TD pass in the face of a direct
challenge from his defender.
"The guy who was covering me said
'you're not going to catch one off of
me.' So I told coach Walsh,"
Margerum said with a smile, "and he
gave me a chance. He knew the play I
wanted to run so he let me run it and I
scored a touchdown."
That relationship with head coach
Bill Walsh is the primary reason
Margerum came to the Farm over the
other schools that recruited him.
"Walsh really cares off the field too,"
said Margerum with respect. "I don't
regret coming here at all. The teachers
are great, the people are great, the
football's great."
Walsh is also a major factor in the
football scheme that the communica
tion major is looking forward to. "I
definitely want to play pro ball. I'm
just a sophomore and I still have to
prove myself, but I have a deep feel
ing that I'm capable of playing profes
sionally — I've put so much time into
it the last eight years."
That time includes an incredible
senior year in high school when
Margerum broke his back in the first
game, missed the next one and played
the rest of the season.
"It was the only way I could go to
college," he explained modestly. That
sort of dedication is rare.
Margerum, who's interested after
football in public relations, is dedi

cated to several other things too: his
high school coaches ("My high school
coach was the one that convinced me
that I could go somewhere with my
athletic ability"); his parents ("My
dad's scrapbooks really motivated me
toward football and I got some of my
athletic ability from my mother who
was a gymnast and a cheerleader");
and his afternoon naps ("I can get by
with little sleep at night but even if I
have an extra half an hour in the after
noon, I crash").
In the three games he's played so
far in his first starting year for Stan
ford, Margerum has caught 14 passes
for 194 yards and three TDs.
The Orange County Athlete of the
Year in 1977, Margerum is modest
enough to realize his limitations on
the field in the midst of his
capabilities. "I have to run the pass
route like the coach wants it. I need to
discipline myself, to go all-out on
every play instead of reserving my
energy in case I have to make a big
run."
So Margerum, who can't wait for
games because he's so excited to play,
who takes vitamin B-15 pills from his
"mom the nutrition nut," who enjoys
people so much he greets practically
everyone that walks by with a grin, is a
star on the field as well as off.
And even though he keeps working
toward the athletic excellence that
eventually gains national recognition,
he'll probably always be known to his
teammates as Buffy with the big finger
rather than Margerum with the ball in
the end zone.

Most football players are known for
the yardage they compile in a game,
the number of points they wrack up
on the board or the key blocks they
throw in the field.
Although Cardinal split end Ken
Margerum has gained recognition for
the usual accomplishments, he's
known best to his teammates by his
nickname Buffy, and the enlarged
index finger that garnishes his left
hand.
"No one even knows my real name
on the team," Margerum said.
"(James) Lofton started calling me
Buffy last year because I looked like
the guy on Family Affair
The enlarged finger that Margerum
said, jokingly, makes him catch bet
ter, was acquired when the sopho
more from Fountain Valley caught his
finger in a car door years ago.
So with his trademarks established
and his nickname bestowed,
Margerum is out to build his own
reputation.
Following two superior receivers
that were drafted into the pros (Bill
Kellar went to the Kansas City Chiefs
and Lofton to the Green Bay Packers),
Margerum is more appreciative than'
disappointed that he didn't play much
his freshman year. "I learned a lot
from watching," he said. "I picked up
the instincts of receiving, to learn the
best routes against the coverage and
how to find openings." This year
Margerum is learning by doing.
During the summer, the 6-foot-1,
185 pounder practiced two hours a

night, Monday through Friday, with
Stanford quarterback Steve Dils. He
sacrificed his summer vacation,
caught about 200 passes each day and
came onto the field in August feeling
comfortable with Dils' soft passes he
can catch with his hands rather than
his whole body.
With the same dedication,
Margerum has hit the weights hard for
the last three years so "I can take the
punishment." Now benching 325
pounds, Margerum said the weights
have undoubtedly helped with his
blocking strength — which he needs
on those plays where the backs re
ceive the passes rather than the split
end.
His enthusiasm to excel originated
in high school and has been essential
in driving Margerum always toward
the win.
"Losing, I hate," he said. "Even
after the Oklahoma game (where he
caught six passes for 74 yards and two
TDs) it was hard to face my parents
and friends. It's so much easier to talk
about a win." That attitude benefited
the four-sport star in high school
where he won every track event he
entered and excelled in football, bas
ketball and baseball. He's competing
in track in college also as the Card's
No. 1 hurdler and an alternate in the
400 relay. "I realize it's almost impos
sible to go undefeated in college, but I
never want to get used to losing."
That's why when Margerum drops a
pass (which he's only done once this
year), he wants "to dig a hole. If I drop
one pass, no matter how well I've

played I don't think I've had a good
game."
Margerum was especially gratified
in the San Jose State game when he
caught a TD pass in the face of a direct
challenge from his defender.
"The guy who was covering me said
'you're not going to catch one off of
me.' So I told coach Walsh,"
Margerum said with a smile, "and he
gave me a chance. He knew the play I
wanted to run so he let me run it and I
scored a touchdown."
That relationship with head coach
Bill Walsh is the primary reason
Margerum came to the Farm over the
other schools that recruited him.
"Walsh really cares off the field too,"
said Margerum with respect. "I don't
regret coming here at all. The teachers
are great, the people are great, the
football's great."
Walsh is also a major factor in the
football scheme that the communica
tion major is looking forward to. "I
definitely want to play pro ball. I'm
just a sophomore and I still have to
prove myself, but I have a deep feel
ing that I'm capable of playing profes
sionally — I've put so much time into
it the last eight years."
That time includes an incredible
senior year in high school when
Margerum broke his back in the first
game, missed the next one and played
the rest of the season.
"It was the only way I could go to
college," he explained modestly. That
sort of dedication is rare.
Margerum, who's interested after
football in public relations, is dedi

cated to several other things too: his
high school coaches ("My high school
coach was the one that convinced me
that I could go somewhere with my
athletic ability"); his parents ("My
dad's scrapbooks really motivated me
toward football and I got some of my
athletic ability from my mother who
was a gymnast and a cheerleader");
and his afternoon naps ("I can get by
with little sleep at night but even if I
have an extra half an hour in the after
noon, I crash").
In the three games he's played so
far in his first starting year for Stan
ford, Margerum has caught 14 passes
for 194 yards and three TDs.
The Orange County Athlete of the
Year in 1977, Margerum is modest
enough to realize his limitations on
the field in the midst of his
capabilities. "I have to run the pass
route like the coach wants it. I need to
discipline myself, to go all-out on
every play instead of reserving my
energy in case I have to make a big
run."
So Margerum, who can't wait for
games because he's so excited to play,
who takes vitamin B-15 pills from his
"mom the nutrition nut," who enjoys
people so much he greets practically
everyone that walks by with a grin, is a
star on the field as well as off.
And even though he keeps working
toward the athletic excellence that
eventually gains national recognition,
he'll probably always be known to his
teammates as Buffy with the big finger
rather than Margerum with the ball in
the end zone.
