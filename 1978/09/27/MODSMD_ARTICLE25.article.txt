## Soccer team rips Davis, 5-1; victory skein runs 4 games 
### DFAN EYRE 
Stanford's soccer team con
tinued its winning ways by re
cording a 5-1 victory over UC-
Davis yesterday afternoon. The
win not only left the Cardinals
undefeated in four league ap
pearances, but it was also the
best performance of the young
season, according to head
coach Nelson Lodge.
"I'm really pleased," Lodge
said. "It's our best win ever
though we have five of them
(including the alumni match
up)."
The Cards took a I -0 lead five
minutes after the halftime
break on a goal by junior
fullback Greg Delgado. lack
McGannon and Dan McNevin
each scored once while
freshman Ted Rafalovich
added two goals.
Mark Self put in the lone goal
for the Aggies with seven mi

nutes remaining in the game.
In assessing the win, Lodge
credited the team with "a great
deal of poise. We penetrated,
we put the ball in the net in the
second half, and we back pas
sed well, bringing the (Davis)
defenders forward.
"They were a good oppo
nent, it's just that we had a
good day — we outplayed
them," he added.
The big difference between
the scoreless first half and the
five-goal explosion in the sec
ond was "finishing."
"To move the ball around is
just not enough. We were
shootingat the wrong time and
losing the ball in the air. We
were making too many passes
in the (goal) area," explained
Lodge.
To overcome those first
period shortcomings, McNe
vin was put in the forward line

with Rafalovich to help distri
bute the ball and spread out
Davis.
Such strategies are a result of
the learning experience from
previous games, especially
from the 1-0 victory over Port
land. "We were able to vid
eotape the Portland game and
just analyze it to death," Lodge
said in describing the McNevin
switch.
In contrasting this season
with last year, when the Cards
had but one victory in their first
eight games, the main factor is
experience.
The Cards will put that ex
perience to an acid test in to
morrow's match-up with San
Jose State at 3:30 p.m. on
Maloney Field. The Spartans
beat Stanford 3-0 last year and
have been the South Bay soc
cer power in recent years.


Freshman Jack McGannon (20), fights with a UC-Davis player for
control of the ball in yesterday's 5-1 victory over the Aggies. McGan
non, who fired in the winning goal in the Cards' 1-0 triumph over
Portland last Saturday, came off the bench again to score as Stanford
