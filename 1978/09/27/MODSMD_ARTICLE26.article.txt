# Superfight at the Superdome
## The
						boxing wasn't the main event 
### IVAN MAISEL 
As I walked out of the Super
dome after the fight, the
hucksters were lined up en
masse. "You've seen history!"
they cried. I approached one
and asked the price of a T-shirt.
"Ten dollars," he replied. "Ten
dollars!" I exclaimed. "They
were only six before the fight."
"But," the entrepreneur logi
cally explained, "you've seen
history."
Such was the attitude in New
Orleans on the fifteenth of
September. The occasion was
the Heavyweight Champion
ship of the World, a fight bet

ween the Champion, Leon
Spinks, and the Challenger,
Muhammad Ali. In case you
have been holed up in the
Andes for the last two weeks
(thus out of Howard Cosell's
vast range), Ali won a unanim
ous decision over Spinks, be
coming the first man in history
to win the title on three diffe
rent occasions.
I was one of the 70,000-plus
who invaded New Orleans for
the fight. The city, to say the
least, prepared for the inva
sion.
The total live gate for the
fight was over $7 million, with

seats starting at $200 for
ringside. When they said
ringside, they weren't exactly
accurate. It was more like
ring-vicinity, with there being
13,000 "ringside" seats. Furth
ermore, the seats were folding
chairs, which made for many a
sore backside and grumbling
as the night wore on.
On the other end of the
spectrum were the $25 seats.
Rumor had it that oxygen
masks and airsick bags were
included in the price, but I
never ventured up there.
The stars shone bright inside
the Dome that Friday night; the

movie stars, that is. Stallone,
Minnelli and Travolta were
there, among others. I hap
pened to walk in at the same
time as Larry Holmes, the
"other" heavyweight champ
ion. (Boxing is renowned for
having more than one champ
ion in a particular class. It adds
to the confusion which reigns
supreme in the sport.) With
Holmes was promoter Don
King.
King once served time in the
Ohio State Penitentiary. He
talks fast and works faster, and
is now recognized by many as
the top boxing promoter in the
world. He is a flashy man, with
a rock on his finger the size of
an Adam's apple and his hair
stretching towards the moon.
I made my way to my seat but
not with the help of an aisle.
The aisles were long ago lost as
the sea of people crashed to
wards the ring. In addition,
there were no conces
sionaires. They might have
been hired, but there was no
way for them to get around.
The preliminary fights were
all exciting, the best fight being
the one in which Mike
Rossman of New Jersey won
the light-heavyweight crown.
Rossman's nickname is the
"Jewish Bomber," a monicker
which endeared him to me and
thousands of others, including
one fan who kept yelling, "Hit
him with a bagel, Mikala."
Rossman's fight was the
most exciting, but it certainly
wasn't the best knockout. That
honor went to one Edy Wil
liams, a Grade-B actress who
showed the Superdome crowd
that she has a Grade-A body
(for reference, please turn to
page 21 of this week's Sports
Illustrated).
Williams snuck into the ring
and began to do a striptease
which caught the eye of
everyone in the crowd but no
one in security. When they fi

nally noticed her, she was
broadsided — excuse the ex
pression — tackled and taken
out of the ring. The boos were
heard in Memphis.
It was 9:10 p.m. and time for
the fighters. Those of us in the
crowd could not see either
fighter as he approached the
ring. All one could see was a
mass of people moving to
wards the ring, only to stop at
the ropes and regurgitate the
fighter and his handlers.
The fight itself was anticlima
tic. From the start one could
see and feel that Ali wanted it
more than did Spinks. Ali
squeezed every drop of
know-how out of 20 years of
boxing and gave Mr. Spinks
one helluva boxing lesson.
After the fight, everyone
began to file out of the
stadium. The door we went out
of was right past the door to
Spink's dressing room. Leon's
brother Michael, a promising
boxer in his own regard, was
talking to the crowd as it pas
sed the door. Someone yelled
at him, "Hey, Leon fought al
right." Michael smiled, and
then a glint of seriousness
came to his eyes. "We was
whupped," he said softly, "but
we'll be back. Leon's gon' be a
two-time champion. We'll be
back."
