U.S. withholds letter on Israeli bases
Washington — The Carter administration is withholding the
transmission of a letter that promises American aid to build
two new Israeli airbases until the issue of Israel's commitment
to halt settlements on the West Bank is decided, officials said
yesterday.
But the officials, who declined to be identified, said the
delay in releasing the airbase aid agreement is not an effort to
pressure Israel into accepting the U.S. view of agreements
reached during the Camp David summit meeting.
The U.S. position is that Israel agreed that new settlements
on the West Bank of the Jordan River are prohibited for five
years. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin says his recol
lection is that the settlement freeze was to last only three
months.
The settlement issue was one of several at Camp David that
were handled separately from the published frameworks for
peace signed by Carter, Begin and Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat. Those issues were to be handled in later exchanges of
letters.
U.S., Soviets to renew SALT talks
United Nations — The United States and the Soviet Union
open a new round of strategic arms limitation negotiations
today — nearly a full year since President Jimmy Carter, in a
burst of optimism, said a new treaty was just around the
corner.
Prospects for an accord are uncertain, although U.S. offi
cials claim differences between the two superpowers have
been narrowing steadily.
And a recent improvement in relations between
Washington and Moscow could brighten the atmosphere for a
treaty, which is intended to limit strategic bombers and long
range missiles.
The major sticking point remains "modernization" — that
is, how many new missile systems the United States and Russia
may build during the life of the treaty and how many existing
systems may be improved.
Labor dispute paralyzes rail service
Washington — Freight and commuter rail service was
paralyzed across most of the country yesterday when a clerks'
union expanded its strike against a Virginia-based railroad to
43 other rail carriers.
The striking Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks said
early morning picketing had shut down or curtailed opera
tions at two-thirds of the nation's major railroads, affecting
every part of the nation except for some portions of the heavily

traveled Northeast corridor.
According to union estimates, more than 330,000 of the
nation's half-million railroad workers honored picket lines
and stayed off the job.
The union said the picketing was aimed at companies that
had been lending equipment and personnel to the strike
bound Norfolk & Western Railway, based in Roanoke, Va.
Union President Fred Knoll said in a statement that the
picketing was intended to "bring increasing pressure" on the
N&W to settle a contract dispute with the union, which struck
the railroad on July 10.
Industry lawyers, contending the picketing was illegal, went
to federal courts wherever there were pickets. They obtained
temporary injunctions in several locations orderingthe picket
ing to stop.
Consumer prices rise 0.6 percent
Washington —Grocery shoppers got some relief from rising
food prices in August but the cost of housing and medical care
kept the inflation rate climbing steadily, the Labor Department
said yesterday.
Food purchased at the grocery store remained at about the
same price in August while overall consumer prices were
going up 0.6 percent, the department said.
The average worker lost ground to inflation during the
month because his pay increases failed to keep up with rising
prices, the department said.
Administration economists were encouraged by the August
price figures, however, because the increases were smaller
than at the start of the year.
Ruby claims he acted alone, brother says
Washington — Earl Ruby testified yesterday that his brother
Jack insisted to his death that he acted on an impulse and
without help when he barged through Dallas police lines and
shot Lee Harvey Oswald.
Ruby told the House assassinations committee that he asked
his brother why he shot Oswald, the accused assassin of Presi
dent John Kennedy, and that Jack Ruby told him:
"When I saw him come through there with that smirk on his
face as though he were happy he killed the president, I just lost
control of myself."
Ruby also testified that his brother maintained he had never
known Oswald before the shooting.
Jack Ruby was convicted by a Texas state court of murdering
Oswald. He was sentenced to death. But the conviction was
overturned by the Texas Supreme Court and Ruby was await
ing a new trial when he died of cancer on Jan. 3, 1967.

Ruby said his brother insisted to his death that he alone was
responsible for Oswald's murder — an event witnessed on
television by millions of horror-stricken Americans two days
after Kennedy's assassination.
Gas bill survives; approval expected
Washington — The natural gas legislation sought by the
Carter administration survived another attempt to scuttle it
yesterday, all but assuring its Senate passage when a final vote
is taken today.
By a 55-36 vote, the Senate rejected a .second move by
opponents to return the gas price decontrol bill to committee
for redrafting.
A week ago, a similar motion was rejected on a 59-39 vote.
Opponents now are conceding that the measure, which
would lift federal price controls from mojt natural gas by 1985,
will be approved by a comfortable margin at a scheduled 10
a.m. PDT vote today.
President ends Turkish arms embargo
Washington — President Jimmy Carter formally ended a
3-year-old embargo on arms shipments to Turkey yesterday.
Carter did so by making a formal finding that Turkey "is
acting in good faith to achieve a just and peaceful settlement of
the Cyprus problem."
The White House made public a Carter memo to Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance that was a prerequisite to renewed arms
shipments.
This coincided with an announcement that Carter had
signed into law the $2.8 billion foreign military aid authoriza
tion act that empowered him to lift the Turkish arms embargo
if he determined Turkey was seeking a Cyprus solution.
Congress imposed a total embargo on arms sales to Turkey
in 1975 in retaliation for that country's use of U.S.-supplied
arms in a 1974 invasion of Cyprus.
