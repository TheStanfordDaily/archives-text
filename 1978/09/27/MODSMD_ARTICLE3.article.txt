# Lyman reveals concerns to Band
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
President Richard Lyman spoke to members of the
Stanford Band for about 20 minutes at their Monday
night rehearsal, sharing his concerns about the faltering
quality of half-time shows over the last several years.
Lyman said he talked to the Band "to get across that
the Band is locked in a tradition with less and less vital
ity."
That seems a strange thing to say about a group that
exhibits such a great amount of physical activity on the
field, he said, but he told the group that past shows have
been, on occasion, insensitive or reaching for laughs.
Alex Jardetzky, manager of the Band, said the group
has been aware of the problem.
"He (Lyman) didn't tell us anything we didn't already
know,"he said.
Positive criticism
Lyman read mail he had received that was critical ot
the Band, but drummer Bruce Heiman described the talk
as "not negative to us at all." Heiman said Lyman offered
much more in the way of positive criticism than anything
negative.
Jardetzky said Lyman "was fair, he was willing to listen
to our comments and he's our biggest backer."
The Stanford Band is known throughout the nation for
its crazy and unorthodox style, and in the past, Lyman's
mail has been evenly divided between those who were
thoroughly shocked by their shows and those who
wouldn't attend a Stanford football game for any other
reason than to see them.
Last night, Lyman told the Band that his mail over the
last two years has been from people who don't want a
band with uniforms and straight lines, but who did have
specific and serious complaints.
Among these complaints were the excessive use of
obscene language, and a formation defamatory to a San
Jose City Councilman.

Jardetzky said one of the problems is the difficulty of
devising a clever new show each week. But the Band
found a possible solution to this difficulty before Ly
man's talk had ended.
SMUT
The Band plans its shows in SMUT (Stanford Marching
Unit Thinkers) meetings after their Monday rehearsals.
Allen Thompson, a veteran drummer, said only a few
people showed up for the normal SMUT meeting over
the last year, and so, new, creative ideas became scarce.
Monday night, over 30 members attended the more
successful SMUT meeting.
"Bigger SMUTs are a step in the right direction,"
Heiman said. "(Monday's) was loud, boisterous and we
even had some freshman women there."
Jardetzky seemed confident that new members will
improve the Band's performances.
"We've got some freshmen who are just outrageous
people," he said, although he added he was worried
about the effect Lyman's visit might have on their en
thusiasm.
"It puts a little awe into the freshmen to see the presi
dent of the University come and talk to the Band," he
said. "I don't want to inhibit them."
Speaking in terms of the whole Band he added that the
visit "may get people's mind off sex, but I don't want to
get people's mind off the risque."
In the past, the Stanford Band has thrived on its wil
lingness to tackle controversial issues in a lighthearted
and comical way.
Forewarned
Lyman's visit was not inspired by any one incident.
Jardetzky had talked to him as early as last springand was
aware some weeks ago that he was coming.
This was, however, the first time Lyman has ever spo
ken to the Band as a whole, according to Thompson.
Despite the situation, the Band did display some of its
tendency to attack campus issues.
