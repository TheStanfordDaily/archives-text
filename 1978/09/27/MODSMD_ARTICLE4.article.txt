# PSA pilot may have been confused by second plane

### 
San Diego (AP) — A second small
plane may have confused the pilot of
a Pacific Southwest Airlines jetliner
that collided with a single-engine
Cessna 172 in clear skies in the na
tion's worst air disaster, a federal
safety expert said here yesterday.
Phillip Hogue, who is overseeing
the National Transportation Safety
Board investigation of the Monday
crash that took at least 150 lives, said
both the jetliner and an unidentified
twin-engine Cessna had been
cleared for landing on the same run
way at Lindbergh Field here.
Hogue noted that the PSA pilot had
acknowledged a traffic control warn
ing of another plane near him but
may not have noticed the single en
gine Cessna that collided with the
crowded Boeing 727.
"Listening to the tower (tape), it's
apparent that the twin-engine plane
was making its approach," Hogue
said. "They had made their approach
before the single engine one. The
pilot said, 'They passed,' but we're
unsure what plane he was referring
to. The (PSA) pilot probably was con
fused."
Unaware of Cessna
Hogue said cockpit and traffic con
trol tower tape recordings may mean
the PSA pilot, a 17-year veteran, was
aware of the first Cessna, which au
thorities now think was ahead of
him, but did not see the smaller
Cessna.
He said investigators are attempt
ing to determine who had piloted the
second plane, which apparently
landed safely.
"It was just another aircraft in the
traffic pattern," Hogue said. "How
far ahead it was of the other (Cessna),
I can't say."
Hogue said he has recommended

that a public hearing be held in San
Diego on the crash after the NTSB
concludes its investigation.
Hogue said investigators could not
determine if the Cessna that crashed
had communicated with traffic con
trollers.
"There was no transmission from
the Cessna that I'm aware of," Hogue
said. "But I could be wrong."
"There's been so much public in
terest in this and public concern be
cause it's such a major disaster,"
Hogue said.
Gravely crippled
Hogue said the PSA pilot appa
rently realized his plane had been
gravely crippled after the collision
but showed no emotion and re
mained calm.
"He said, 'We're going down' and
he said it in the softest of tones,"
Hogue said after listening to the
tower tapes. "I couldn't believe he
said it in such soft tones. There was
no sign of panic, no hint of terror."
Possible aversion
Rep. John Burton (D-Calif.) made
the statement in opening hearings by
a Government Operations subcom
mittee into airline safety. He said the

disaster might have been prevented
if the government required a prop
osed collision avoidance system for
aircraft.
Elwood Driver, acting chairman of
the National Transportation Safety
Board, said the collision occured as:
— A light aircraft was ascending
from a practice instrument approach
and a Pacific Southwest Airlines' Boe
ing 727 was landing.
Frequency switch
— Pilots of both aircraft were
switching from one radio frequency
to another to communicate with dif
ferent air traffic control stations. >
Driver said that even though the
weather was good, the pilot of the
single-engine Cessna plane was
practicing using instruments for
landing in foul weather. The Cessna
was'approaching a runway and then
pulled up without touching the run
way, he said.
The collision rekindled a dormant
controversy over the field's location.
Critics complain the aircraft ap
proach path is too close to populous
neighborhoods and downtown
buildings.
