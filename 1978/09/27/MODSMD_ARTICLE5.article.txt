# Could plane crash threaten campus?
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Could a plane crash similar to
Monday's disaster in San Diego hap
pen above the Stanford campus?
Although San Francisco Interna
tional is one of the busiest airports in
the world, federal aviation adminis
trators on 'he peninsula say that be
cause of special controls in effect
throughout the bay area, a catas
trophe like San Diego's would be
"highly improbable."
But a local retired military pilot dis
agrees.
"The same accident that occurred
in San Diego could happen any day
here," said Peter Faulkner, a 14-year
Palo Alto resident who has flown
more than 3000 hours in the U.S. Air
Force.
Faulkner argues that because of
heavy jumbo jet traffic combined
with small private plane traffic and
training flights, the Stanford campus
is a sure target for a plummeting
wrecked aircraft.
"Even if a head-on collision occur
red over Stanford's uninhabited
lands, the momentum of the wreck
would force debris to land in inha
bited areas," he said.
And a head-on collision is a real
danger in the skies above the Univer
sity because of heavy jet and small
plane traffic, he added.
Yet aviation administrators and
private plane owners say a fatal crash
between a jumbo jet and a small
plane is virtually impossible because
the two crafts are rarely in the same
airspace.
"The bay area has a TCA (terminal
control area) which prevents such
accidents," explained Frank Boone,
deputy chief at the air traffic control
terminal in San Francisco Interna
tional.
A TCA, or upside-down wedding
cake as many pilots call it, is a tiered

imaginary line spreading from the
airport to San lose and over the
ocean. Jets can fly above this line,
which marks 4000 feet above sea
level at Stanford and 2000 feet above
sea level at the San Mateo bridge. But
private planes may not exceed these
designated altitudes unless they
meet certain criteria.
"Planes must have an incoding al
timeter which shows altitude and
speed on radar scopes and they must
be in constant communication with
the air traffic control tower," Boone
said "All aircraft are separated
within the confines of a TCA."
Although it is a federal regulation
for planes to follow TCA plans,
Faulkner said his hilltop home per
mits him to have a clear view of the
peninsula skies, revealing some
jumbo jets flying above the campus
at 2500 feet.
And it's at that elevation that train
ing pilots do much of their flying.
"We usually practice at 2500 to
3500 feet above sea level and rarely
go up to 4000," said Linda Haun, a
pilot with the Spirit of Palo Alto train
ing school.
But she added, "I've never had to
compete with the jumbo jets for
airspace."
jerry Egan, assistant chief in the
control tower at Palo Alto Municipal
Airport said the airspace above cam
pus and its uninhabited lands is "not
a problem" because Stanford is too
far from San Francisco International.
Haun agreed, but added the flying
area above the San Francisco Bay is a
danger spot because smaller aircraft
equipped with the special instru
ments converge with the jumbo jet
traffic.
Monday's holocaust in San Diego
involved a PSA jetliner which col
lided with a Cessna 172 while they
were being cleared for landing.
