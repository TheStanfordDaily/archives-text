# Califano announces crackdown on 'croakers'
## 
### BILL BURGER 
Stating that he wanted to make the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare
"a symbol of manageability, not the un
manageability of government," HEW Sec
retary Joseph Califano yesterday announced
launching of a drive to crack down on doc
tors who prescribe drugs to pushers with
forged or stolen Medicaid cards.
Califano, addressing a special meeting of
the Commonwealth Club of California at San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel, said
"crackdown teams" should be working in 10
large cities nationwide "by the end of next
month." The first such team is being estab
lished in Philadelphia, he said. The cities
where the groups are to be located were not
immediately disclosed.
The teams will be composed of federal,
state and local personnel and will "plan ac
tion against doctors, druggists and Medicaid
clients who are defrauding the Medicaid
program." Califano called the targets of the
plan "croakers."
The 41-year-old former special assistant to
President Lyndon Johnson told the crowd of
more than 500 that he thought "some of the
motivation behind Proposition 13 was un
derstandable." He illustrated his point by
giving an account of the "inattention, confu
sion and mismanagement that had led to
400,000 student loan defaults in the

government-based Guaranteed Student
Loan Program."
Califano attributed the 13 percent default
rate on such loans to the fact that only a few
of the defaulting students had been billed by
the federal government as of last November.
"I don't know about you," Califano said,
"but I rarely, if ever, can remember myself
paying any bills I don't receive."
The campus-based loan program had an
even worse default rate of 20 percent, ac
cording to Califano. More than 600,000 stu
dents have defaulted on notes totaling $600
million.
Califano added that HEW has found "dis
turbing evidence of inadequate administra
tive controls on campuses, outright fraud in
some schools and inept monitoring by the
government" in this program.
The secretary blamed HEW's management
responsibility structure, which was frag
mented among three different offices in two
different bureaus for the problems sur
rounding student aid programs.
"There was virtually no communication
among Washington and the regions," he
said.
"The backlog of suspected fraud cases in
the student loan programs amounted to
three years of work for the available staff of
investigators and each week the backlog in
creased by one full month.

"Such an atmosphere of chaos and confu
sion was an invitation to outright fraud, and
there were plenty ready to accept the invita
tion."
To remedy the myriad of problems,
Califano said six separate student aid prog
rams were consolidated under a single gov
erning bureau and the regional links were
strengthened to facilitate communication,
all within 90 days of his taking office.
The department then began to screen ap
plications by computer, tightened the re
quirements on participating institutions, in
stalled a computerized billing system and
billed all known defaulters, and cross
checked lists of defaulters against lists of
federal employees.
He reported that 110,000 default cases had
been "cleared up" by Sept. 1, with 80,000 of
those now having paid in full or on a regular
payment schedule.
Califano also said that for the first time in
the 10-year history of the program, the de
fault backlog is decreasing and is expected
to be eliminated by the end of 1980.
Califano also spoke of two other programs
HEW has initiated to cut down on waste in
programs it funds with its more than $182
billion yearly budget. Project Integrity is a
broad-based national review of the
Medicaid program of which the crackdown
teams are a part. It is funded by legislation

passed last December and fraud units have
been set up in 16 states, including California,
New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and Michigan. These six states accounted for
62 percent of the Medicaid payments in
1977.
Project Match is an effort to identify which
of the five million federal employees are il
legally receiving welfare payments. Califano
said out of 33,000 names appearing as both
federal employees and welfare recipients,
HEW has so far identified about 23,000
names "which warrant further investiga
tion."
Out of the first 4800 cases investigated,
Califano said 2000 have been discovered to
involve ineligibility or overpayment.
"Because I had a part in launching so many
of these programs earlier," Califano said, "I
want to see them work with maximum effec
tiveness now."
He said he was determined, upon assum
ing his post 21 months ago, that the depart
ment whose budget amounts to 36 percent
of the total federal budget "should become
a symbol not only of compassion but of
competence.
"Public programs, born of compassion,
must grow up in efficiency. The generous
commitment of our citizens to social prog
rams must be matched by prudent and
tough-minded management from those of
us who govern," Califano said.

motivation behind Proposition 13 was un
derstandable." He illustrated his point by
giving an account of the "inattention, confu
sion and mismanagement that had led to
400,000 student loan defaults in the

government-based Guaranteed Student
Loan Program."
Califano attributed the 13 percent default
rate on such loans to the fact that only a few
of the defaulting students had been billed by
the federal government as of last November.
"I don't know about you," Califano said,
"but I rarely, if ever, can remember myself
paying any bills I don't receive."
The campus-based loan program had an
even worse default rate of 20 percent, ac
cording to Califano. More than 600,000 stu
dents have defaulted on notes totaling $600
million.
Califano added that HEW has found "dis
turbing evidence of inadequate administra
tive controls on campuses, outright fraud in
some schools and inept monitoring by the
government" in this program.
The secretary blamed HEW's management
responsibility structure, which was frag
mented among three different offices in two
different bureaus for the problems sur
rounding student aid programs.
"There was virtually no communication
among Washington and the regions," he
said.
"The backlog of suspected fraud cases in
the student loan programs amounted to
three years of work for the available staff of
investigators and each week the backlog in
creased by one full month.

"Such an atmosphere of chaos and confu
sion was an invitation to outright fraud, and
there were plenty ready to accept the invita
tion."
To remedy the myriad of problems,
Califano said six separate student aid prog
rams were consolidated under a single gov
erning bureau and the regional links were
strengthened to facilitate communication,
all within 90 days of his taking office.
The department then began to screen ap
plications by computer, tightened the re
quirements on participating institutions, in
stalled a computerized billing system and
billed all known defaulters, and cross
checked lists of defaulters against lists of
federal employees.
He reported that 110,000 default cases had
been "cleared up" by Sept. 1, with 80,000 of
those now having paid in full or on a regular
payment schedule.
Califano also said that for the first time in
the 10-year history of the program, the de
fault backlog is decreasing and is expected
to be eliminated by the end of 1980.
Califano also spoke of two other programs
HEW has initiated to cut down on waste in
programs it funds with its more than $182
billion yearly budget. Project Integrity is a
broad-based national review of the
Medicaid program of which the crackdown
teams are a part. It is funded by legislation

passed last December and fraud units have
been set up in 16 states, including California,
New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and Michigan. These six states accounted for
62 percent of the Medicaid payments in
1977.
Project Match is an effort to identify which
of the five million federal employees are il
legally receiving welfare payments. Califano
said out of 33,000 names appearing as both
federal employees and welfare recipients,
HEW has so far identified about 23,000
names "which warrant further investiga
tion."
Out of the first 4800 cases investigated,
Califano said 2000 have been discovered to
involve ineligibility or overpayment.
"Because I had a part in launching so many
of these programs earlier," Califano said, "I
want to see them work with maximum effec
tiveness now."
He said he was determined, upon assum
ing his post 21 months ago, that the depart
ment whose budget amounts to 36 percent
of the total federal budget "should become
a symbol not only of compassion but of
competence.
"Public programs, born of compassion,
must grow up in efficiency. The generous
commitment of our citizens to social prog
rams must be matched by prudent and
tough-minded management from those of
us who govern," Califano said.

Stating that he wanted to make the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare
"a symbol of manageability, not the un
manageability of government," HEW Sec
retary Joseph Califano yesterday announced
launching of a drive to crack down on doc
tors who prescribe drugs to pushers with
forged or stolen Medicaid cards.
Califano, addressing a special meeting of
the Commonwealth Club of California at San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel, said
"crackdown teams" should be working in 10
large cities nationwide "by the end of next
month." The first such team is being estab
lished in Philadelphia, he said. The cities
where the groups are to be located were not
immediately disclosed.
The teams will be composed of federal,
state and local personnel and will "plan ac
tion against doctors, druggists and Medicaid
clients who are defrauding the Medicaid
program." Califano called the targets of the
plan "croakers."
The 41-year-old former special assistant to
President Lyndon Johnson told the crowd of
more than 500 that he thought "some of the
