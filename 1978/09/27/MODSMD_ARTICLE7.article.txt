# Scholarships for overseas study ...

### LEAH HALPER 
Just eight months before her
graduation from Stanford,
Mary W. went to a meeting
which led to travel, study ab
road, and a broadened percep
tion of the world around her.
At the urging of a friend who
knew she was interested in
traveling to Britain, Mary went
to a gathering at the Bechtel
International Center. Given in
formation on a number of
scholarships available for over
seas study, Mary applied for a
Rhodes Scholarship, and ulti
mately became one of just 32
students nationwide chosen to
travel to Oxford, England to do
post-graduate work in her cho
sen field.
Mary W., a hypothetical
scholarship winner, was a
good student, active in athle
tics and had good recommen
dations from faculty members.
Tonight, the l-Center is hold
ing an informational meeting
for students interested in the

Rhodes, Marshall or Churchill
scholarships.
Also at the l-Center tomor
row night, information about
the 500-some Fulbright grants
available to students who will
have completed their under
graduate studies by next sum
mer will be distributed. Ful
brights are not available to stu
dents with doctoral degrees,
and this restriction also applies
to the Rhodes, Marshall and
Churchill scholarship appliac
ants.
According to l-Center Direc
tor Lee Zeigler, students here
often have won these scholar
ships in the past.
"We do pretty well because
we have good candidates,"
Zeigler said. He defined a good
candidate as "someone who
has a good academic
background, clear appealing
study habits and good recom
mendations."
A Fulbright scholarship pays
for round-trip transportation,
language or orientation
courses, tuition, books,
maintenance, and insurance.
Applicants choose one of 50
nations in which to study, rang
ing from Lesotho to the USSR.
Although each participating
nation sets its own require

ments, Ziegler said that candi
dates should have a "working
knowledge" of the language.
Applications for Fulbrights,
due Oct. 13, must include a
study plan, curriculum review,
three letters of reference, and
a report on language profi
ciency.
"The purpose of the Ful
bright is to have an experience
in another country, gathering
information useful to growth,
and experiencing what it is like
to be an American living ab
road," Zeigler said.
Rhodes Scholarships, which
are awarded for at least two
year periods and not more than
three, became available to
women two years ago after
what Zeigler calls, "lots of
pressure" from feminist
groups. In addition to rigorous
academic requirements, the
Rhodes Trust at Oxford, which
administers the funds, re
quires that students display an
interest in athletics.
"That doesn't mean you
have to be captain of the foot
ball, tennis, or golf team,"
Overseas Opportunity Direc
tor Marcia Makino said. "Even
people who participate in in
tramurals get Rhodes. This is
just an outgrowth of (Cecil

John) Rhodes' philosophy that
a strong body fosters a strong
mind."
According to Makino, any
one who wants a Rhodes must
be seriously committed to their
work. "Rhodes excludes mar
ried students because married
scholars would have other
commitments."
Similarly, candidates for one
of the 30 Marshall Scholarships,
each for a two year period,
must have clear goals formu
lated. "You must specify two
universities in Britain and there
is no subject restriction. It is an
excellent idea to choose a uni
versity that would best serve
your interests, so it is good to
do some research.
Letters of recommendation
are practically a must, Makino
added.
The University also influ
ences the choice of Churchill
candidates, who submit appli
cations which are reviewed by
faculty and staff here. Two
Stanford students are then
chosen to compete for the two
Churchills which are awarded
nationally. The winning scho
lars study at Cambridge. Appli
cations for these scholarships
are due next week.

several more months at least, there are a few stu-

for round-trip transportation,
language or orientation
courses, tuition, books,
maintenance, and insurance.
Applicants choose one of 50
nations in which to study, rang
ing from Lesotho to the USSR.
Although each participating
nation sets its own require

ments, Ziegler said that candi
dates should have a "working
knowledge" of the language.
Applications for Fulbrights,
due Oct. 13, must include a
study plan, curriculum review,
three letters of reference, and
a report on language profi
ciency.
"The purpose of the Ful
bright is to have an experience
in another country, gathering
information useful to growth,
and experiencing what it is like
to be an American living ab
road," Zeigler said.
Rhodes Scholarships, which
are awarded for at least two
year periods and not more than
three, became available to
women two years ago after
what Zeigler calls, "lots of
pressure" from feminist
groups. In addition to rigorous
academic requirements, the
Rhodes Trust at Oxford, which
administers the funds, re
quires that students display an
interest in athletics.
"That doesn't mean you
have to be captain of the foot
ball, tennis, or golf team,"
Overseas Opportunity Direc
tor Marcia Makino said. "Even
people who participate in in
tramurals get Rhodes. This is
just an outgrowth of (Cecil

John) Rhodes' philosophy that
a strong body fosters a strong
mind."
According to Makino, any
one who wants a Rhodes must
be seriously committed to their
work. "Rhodes excludes mar
ried students because married
scholars would have other
commitments."
Similarly, candidates for one
of the 30 Marshall Scholarships,
each for a two year period,
must have clear goals formu
lated. "You must specify two
universities in Britain and there
is no subject restriction. It is an
excellent idea to choose a uni
versity that would best serve
your interests, so it is good to
do some research.
Letters of recommendation
are practically a must, Makino
added.
The University also influ
ences the choice of Churchill
candidates, who submit appli
cations which are reviewed by
faculty and staff here. Two
Stanford students are then
chosen to compete for the two
Churchills which are awarded
nationally. The winning scho
lars study at Cambridge. Appli
cations for these scholarships
are due next week.
