# ... and the men behind them

Behind the 564 scholarships
available to American students
for foreign study lurk the
legacies of four brilliant, com
plex men. Their endowments
reflect the thinking of their
eras, and each scholarship has
a rich history behind it.
Rhodes
Cecil John Rhodes, the En
glishman after whom Rhodesia
is named, endowed the
Rhodes Scholarship Trust at
Oxford and played a major role
in the development of south
ern Africa.
After Rhodes graduated

from Oxford, financing his
education with uncut
diamonds he had mineo in
South Africa, he returned to
Africa and attempted to build a
racial hierarchy based on his
vision of a British-occupied
continent. Along with organiz
ing the British South African
Company, Rhodes colonized
large tribal land areas with im
ported white settlers.
Rhodes had another, related
dream â€” he hoped to promote
international communication
and aid the cause of peace by
developing a new world
through molding new leaders.

He wanted to allow young men
to widen their worldly experi
ences so he left a large sum of
money in his 1902 will to fi
nance the education of some
foreign students at Oxford.
At first, Oxford was nervous
and highly dubious about the
possible effects that strange,
even "bizzare," foreigners
would have on their staid in
stitution. But today, a total of
17 nations send about 180 scho
lars to Oxford each year for a
two-study term, where they are
accorded both prestige and
status.
Churchill
"I support with enthusiasm
this program," Sir Winston
Churchill said when the Chur
chill Scholarships program was
first set up in 1959. "I am hon
ored that it should bear my
name."
Always interested in science
and technology, Churchill
found his interest grew during
World War 11, when he served
as Britain's prime minister. He
believed that scientific and
technological innovation were
the key to victory in this gener
ation's sophisticated warfare.
Churchill was disappointed
that a relatively small number
of Anglo students were in
terested in these areas.
After the war, he came to be
lieve that English-speaking
people can and must work to
gether in a technological prog
ram. Even though Churchill
had attended Harrow and San
dhurst colleges, Churchill Col
lege at Cambridge was chosen
for the endowment because of
its excellent scientific reputa
tion.
Marshall
The Marshall Scholarships
also were born of the peace
that followed World War 11.
The massive Marshall Plan,
named after the late American
General George Marshall, was
approved by the U.S. Congress
to rebuild war-torn Europe.
Some of the millions of dollars
spent to rejuvenate these na
tions were diverted for the
purpose of educating young
people to understand human
solidarity, as Marshall said in a
1947 speech.
Fulbright
James William Fulbright,
who chaired the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,
made good use of the foreign
money received by the U.S.
from the sale of surplus war
properties abroad as the fiscal
basis for the Fulbright grant
program. Originating the
program in 1946 as a way to get
students to other nations, Ful
bright was able to amend and
strengthen his legislation in
1961, when he and another
senator sponsored the Mutual
Education and Cultural Ex
change Act, or the Fulbright
scholarships.
