# Attrition patterns studied in science, math courses
## 
### EMILY SACHAR 
Most undergraduates here
who major in math, engineer
ing, chemistry or physics have
to prod through a core of
courses in their field. Every
year, there are the whizzes in
Chemistry 31 and the aces in
Math 41 who score in the top
one percent of their class and
see all A's when grades are dis
tributed.
Another group of students
never makes it through these
classes. Some move to a lower
tracked series in the same field
or department, taking Math
10-11, for example, instead of
Math 41-42-43. Some take the
same class again, a quarter la
ter. Some never register for a
similar course again.
The student organization,
Women in Science and En
gineering (WISE), is surveying
this last group of students to
discover the attrition rates
among students in introduc
tory math and science courses
here.
The classes surveyed are:
Chemistry 31-33-35; Physics
51-53-55; Engineering 3-4-5;
and Calculus 5-6-7, 10-11-21-
22-23, 41-42-43.
Suited to needs
"The purpose of our study is
to investigate ways of reducing
attrition in these courses, to
examine the effectiveness of
current programs, and to have
students propose other prog
rams that would be more
suited to their needs," Mary
Lou Allen, Assistant Director of
the Stanford Instructional
Television Network, and WISE
advisor, said.
Allen also plans to monitor
the different attrition rates be
tween men and women.
Another study, conducted
by Allen and Adrienne Payne, a
teaching fellow here, will
examine how women compare
with men in general prepared
ness for majors in science and
mathematics.
"For a large random sample
of last year's 1500 freshmen, we
collected the number of years
of high school math taken and
the student's SAT math scores
and correlated these with the
choice of a tentative major.
"We want to see how
women compare with men in
general preparedness for
majors in engineering, sci
ences and math," Allen added.
Early results
None of the data from either
study has been completely
analyzed yet. However, several
facts are known from the attri
tion study, Allen said.
"We found that 140 students
who enrolled in Chem 31 last
autumn did not register for
Chem 33. They either dropped
in the middle of Chemistry 31
or just didn't continue in the
series. That's obviously a
large number of students, con

sidering 830 started in Chem
31," Allen said.
But Allen did not find sig
nificantly more women drop
ping than men. "We were sur
prised by this," Allen added.
Also, 25 percent of the stu
dents who enrolled in En
gineering 3 did not continue
on in the series.
"That is quite a discouraging
figure. Surprisingly, in this
case, actually more men drop
ped between quarters than
women, 19 men and only 3
women," Allen said.
"Percentage-wise, 12 percent
of women dropped; 23 percent
of the men dropped."
This year, only Engineering 3
will be taught. Engineering 4
and 5 have been dropped from
the engineering curriculum.
Allen and Payne compiled
the names of students to re
ceive surveys from lists sec
ured from the Registrar.
For the first study, which

looked at the attrition rates in
various classes, surveys were
sent to any student who drop
ped a class or received a "no
credit."
Feelings
"In order to get some of the
feelings of these students we
asked such quesitons as Do
you think there was sufficient
student/instructor interac
tion?' or 'Do you think the class
size was too large?' " Allen
said.
Surveys were distributed to
students in classes taught last
year. Payne is currently coding
the data for entry intoa compu
ter which will correlate and
analyze the results, according
to Allen. A report describing
the project and results will be
submitted at the end of au
tumn quarter to President
Richard Lyman's Committee
tor the Education and Employ
ment of Women for re
view.

general preparedness for
majors in engineering, sci
ences and math," Allen added.
Early results
None of the data from either
study has been completely
analyzed yet. However, several
facts are known from the attri
tion study, Allen said.
"We found that 140 students
who enrolled in Chem 31 last
autumn did not register for
Chem 33. They either dropped
in the middle of Chemistry 31
or just didn't continue in the
series. That's obviously a
large number of students, con

sidering 830 started in Chem
31," Allen said.
But Allen did not find sig
nificantly more women drop
ping than men. "We were sur
prised by this," Allen added.
Also, 25 percent of the stu
dents who enrolled in En
gineering 3 did not continue
on in the series.
"That is quite a discouraging
figure. Surprisingly, in this
case, actually more men drop
ped between quarters than
women, 19 men and only 3
women," Allen said.
"Percentage-wise, 12 percent
of women dropped; 23 percent
of the men dropped."
This year, only Engineering 3
will be taught. Engineering 4
and 5 have been dropped from
the engineering curriculum.
Allen and Payne compiled
the names of students to re
ceive surveys from lists sec
ured from the Registrar.
For the first study, which

looked at the attrition rates in
various classes, surveys were
sent to any student who drop
ped a class or received a "no
credit."
Feelings
"In order to get some of the
feelings of these students we
asked such quesitons as Do
you think there was sufficient
student/instructor interac
tion?' or 'Do you think the class
size was too large?' " Allen
said.
Surveys were distributed to
students in classes taught last
year. Payne is currently coding
the data for entry intoa compu
ter which will correlate and
analyze the results, according
to Allen. A report describing
the project and results will be
submitted at the end of au
tumn quarter to President
Richard Lyman's Committee
tor the Education and Employ
ment of Women for re
view.

Most undergraduates here
who major in math, engineer
ing, chemistry or physics have
to prod through a core of
courses in their field. Every
year, there are the whizzes in
Chemistry 31 and the aces in
Math 41 who score in the top
one percent of their class and
see all A's when grades are dis
tributed.
Another group of students
never makes it through these
classes. Some move to a lower
tracked series in the same field
or department, taking Math
10-11, for example, instead of
Math 41-42-43. Some take the
same class again, a quarter la
ter. Some never register for a
similar course again.
The student organization,
Women in Science and En
gineering (WISE), is surveying
this last group of students to
discover the attrition rates
among students in introduc
tory math and science courses
here.
The classes surveyed are:
Chemistry 31-33-35; Physics
51-53-55; Engineering 3-4-5;
and Calculus 5-6-7, 10-11-21-
22-23, 41-42-43.
Suited to needs
"The purpose of our study is
to investigate ways of reducing
attrition in these courses, to
examine the effectiveness of
current programs, and to have
students propose other prog
rams that would be more
suited to their needs," Mary
Lou Allen, Assistant Director of
the Stanford Instructional
Television Network, and WISE
advisor, said.
Allen also plans to monitor
the different attrition rates be
tween men and women.
Another study, conducted
by Allen and Adrienne Payne, a
teaching fellow here, will
examine how women compare
with men in general prepared
ness for majors in science and
mathematics.
"For a large random sample
of last year's 1500 freshmen, we
collected the number of years
of high school math taken and
the student's SAT math scores
and correlated these with the
choice of a tentative major.
"We want to see how
women compare with men in
general preparedness for
majors in engineering, sci
ences and math," Allen added.
