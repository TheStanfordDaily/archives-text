# Sororities to contend with challenges of their first full year
## 
### PAN DEMETRAKAKES 
This is the first full academic year for Stanford
sororities, and the women who pledged last year now
face the task of making sororities work.
Last December the Board of Trustees rescinded the
34-year-old ban on sororities, and by March six na
tional sororities had organized colonies here. The
new groups formed an Inter-Sorority Council, and
began their first big project — planning a two-week
rush to be held in April.
By the end of rush, one sorority had dropped out,
another had started, and the total number of sorority
pledges had doubled to more than 200.
One of the biggest problems faced by the sororities
now is logistics. Because of the shortage of on
campus housing and policy conflicts between the
University and the sororities' national organizations,
if campus housing ever does exist for sororities, it will
be at least two or three years away.
Ownership conflict
One of the major conflicts concerns who will own
the house. The national sororities have a policy that
the sorority must own and operate its house. How
ever, the University policy dictates that all on-campus
houses must be owned by the Universityand bea part
of the residential education system — which would
include sororities.
At the same time, the University disapproves of the
requirement by some sororities that each pledge be
recommended for membership by an existing
member or an alumna.

"Decisions regarding what University resources
students have access to should not be made by
people who are not a part of the University," Residen
tial Education Director Norm Robinson said.
Houses not necessary
He also said that housing for sororities "seems a
couple of years down the road," but added that they
do not necessarily have to have houses to be success
ful.
Inter-Sorority Council President Tammy Ritchey
agrees.
"A sorority doesn't have to be a house at all,"
Ritchey said. "The only thing we need is a place to
meet."
Two sororities are filling that need, for this year at
least, by renting off-campus apartments and using
the apartment building's recreation rooms as meet
ing places. However, both Nancy Hoffman, president
of Kappa Alpha Theta, and Jill Liscom, president of Pi
Beta Phi, say that they do not yet know whether these
arrangements will be permanent.
Student response to last spring's rush varied from
50 members for Kappa Alpha Theta to only nine for
Chi Omega. However, Ritchey said that the figures
may reflect certain sororities' desire to limit their size
as well as student enthusiasm.
Ritchey said that sororities will help fill a gap in the
social lives of women here. "I see it as an opportunity
for women to meet each other," she said. "It's hard to
form lasting relationships with women at Stanford."


What a rush!
Women attend the Theta rush last spring in Larkin hall. There are now 50 Theta pledges.
