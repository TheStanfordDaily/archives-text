# Argentina, Chile feud over islands
## 
### 
Santiago, Chile (AP) — A
century-old dispute between
Argentina and Cnile over own
ership of three tiny islands off
the tip of South America has
heated up to the point that
many on both sides fear war.
Negotiators for the two
South American neighbors
held a round of talks recently in
Santiago, working against a
backdrop of rumored troop
clashes, an accidental incur
sion by Argentine soldiers two
weeks ago, a sharp decline in
bilateral trade and expulsion of
many Chileans working in
Argentina.
The islands of Picton, Len
nox and Nueva, south of Tierra
del Fuego, have been held by
Chile since the last century.
Argentina has claimed them
almost as long.
The nations are more con
cerned about the surrounding
ocean than the islands because
there are unconfirmed reports
of petroleum resources
nearby.

An arbitration commission
to resolve the dispute was ap
pointed by the British govern
ment in 1971. It ruled last year
that under the 1881 limits treaty
between Chile and Argentina
the islands belonged to Chile.
Argentina argues that while
the 1881 treaty does concede
all Pacific islands south of the
Beagle Canal to Cape Horn are
Chile's, the disputed islands
are in the Atlantic and there
fore belong to Argentina. But it
is not clear if the islands are in
the Atlantic or the Pacific.
Argentina rejected the island
arbitration decision early this
year and sent its entire navy
sailing through the area. And it
was doublv irritated when
Chile said it planned to claim a
200-mile territorial limit ex
tending east of the islands, well
into the Atlantic.
The Roman Catholic bishops
of Chile and Argentina met for
two days recently in Mendoza,
Argentina, then issued a joint

plea "to avoid whatever con
frontation, which besides
being absurd, would be
suicide."
Brazil was brought into the
dispute recently when Argen
tina prohibited for several
weeks the passage its
territory of Brazilian-made
trucks sold to Chilean dealers.
Brazil reacted by blocking a re
ported 200 Argentine cargo
trucks from entering Brazil
with fruit and other goods for
sale.
Presidents Rafael Videla of
Argentina and Augusto
Pinochet of Chile, both army
generals, held a summit meet
ing last February in the south
ern Chilean lake region and ag

reed to appoint negotiating
commissions to discuss territo
rial sea limits near the islands.
But Pinochet said the discus
sions would not include the is
lands, which he said were not
negotiable. Videla said Argen
tina was not changing its posi
tion.
So it is not clear what high
level negotiating groups have
been talking about in tneir fre
quent sessions here and in
Buenos Aires. After each round
they issue brief statements
which say little.
Argentine military officers
have been making strong off
the-record remarks to Argen
tine newspapers calling for sei
zure of the islands.
