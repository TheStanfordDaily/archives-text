# Bakke goes to school

### 
Davis (AP) — In an interview
with a reporter who posed as a
fellow student, Allan Bakke
said he hopes the furor over his
presence at the University of
California Medical School
doesn't last long.
"I haven't felt any hostility —
I just got here — but I'll be glad
when all the activity is over
with," the 38-vear-old white
student, central figure in a his
toric U.S. Supreme Court rul
ing on minority admissions,
said Monday during his first
class.
"I expected it,"he said of the
demonstration outside the
building. "I'll be glad for
everyone's sake when it ceases
soon."
The account of Bakke's first
day as a medical student also
said those who shook his hand
and welcomed him did not in
clude any of the class' black or
Mexican-American students.
The publicity-shy Bakke has
shunned interviews and had
little to say to reporters who
questioned him Monday as he
entered and left the lecture
hall.
The interview, in a copyright
story in Tuesday's Sacramento
Union, was by Steven Magag

nini, a reporter who entered
the classroom posing as a stu
dent and did not otherwise
identify himself to Bakke.
The university's Davis cam
pus, which rejected Bakke's
application in 1973 and 1974,
admitted him this fall at the or
ders of the U.S. Supreme
Court, which ruled that his civil
rights had been violated by a
minority admissions program.
That program reserved 16
places in each entering class of
100 for low-income minority
group members.
In a separate vote, the court
ruled that race could be consi
dered as one of many criteria in
admissions.
Asked about the long legal
battle that ended in his admis
sion, Bakke said it didn't take
courage, "just a lot of inertia."
"It would have been easier
not to come at this point and
keep doing what I've been
doing for the last 10 or 11
years," said Bakke, who has
been an aerospace engineer in
Sunnyvale, south of San Fran
cisco.
"But I'm glad I'm here. It's
going to be exciting."
