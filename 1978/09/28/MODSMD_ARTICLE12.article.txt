# From philosophy to housing
## Bever discusses new job as Row Director 
### JILL LISCOM 
"The genius of the Row is its
diversity. It makes the Row un
ique in higher education," said
new Row Director Michael Be
ver.
Bever began the job four
months ago when former Row
Director Karen Harrison res
igned. At the same time assis
tant Row Director Tom
Hornbeak resigned and the
Row office secretary transfer
red to another position here.
"The biggest challenge was
starting over with an entirely
new office and people who had
never worked with the Row be
fore," said Bever. "The job is
unique. There's no place you
can get relevant experience."
However, "as for the role it
self, I feel extremely comforta
ble in it," continued Bever, as
he leaned back in his chair with
his hands clasped behind his
head.
"I'm doing things I've done
before, only in a new context,

and sort of putting them all to
gether," heexplained. "I could
tell even after the first day of
the job that the glove fit per
fectly," he added.
Escondido Village
Bever has worked here for
the past two years as manager
of Escondido Village, where he
was involved with the housing
for graduate students and their
families. Bever said he also had
programmatic responsibilities,
"but they were of secondary
importance as the job was de
fined."
Bever got his first housing
job, a combination of residen
tial education and housing
management, at LaVerne Col
lege in Southern California. At
the time Bever was in a Ph.D.
program in ethics at Claremont
Men's College and planning to
teach philosophy of religion.
Bever said he was interested in
the field since both his father
and grandfather were minis
ters.

Born in Princeton, Indiana
and raised in northeastern In
diana, Bever ended up major
ing in American Studies and
history at Anderson College, a
small private school also in In
diana. From there he attended
a seminary in Indianapolis and
continued to Claremont grad
school where he began in a re
ligion and liberal arts program,
but eventually moved into the
ethics program.
"The only reason I didn't
finish was it was becoming
more and more a luxury in that
at Claremont, they make you
sweat blood to get a Ph.D.,
especially in my department,"
Bever explained.
LaVerne College
"It was too expensive and
too difficult in terms of family
life," said Bever, adding that
his wife, Rena, had been work
ing at LaVerne College as assis
tant dean of students to put
him through school.

"When I got my first housing
job, it was right after the war
and people were really in
terested in talking about val
ues, so my job fit in well" with
his interest in philosophy and
ethics, commented Bevers.
"I've always looked for that
teaching component in my
work. One reason why I like
this job so much is because
that teaching element is such a
necessary part of my job."
Before coming to Stanford,
Bever also held the position of
director of resident halls at
Claremont Men's College. Ac
cording to Bever, there are "a
lot of similarities" between
Stanford's and Claremont's
housing systems in that the re
sident halls are relatively small,
separate units, and "each
house has its own character."
Housing system
However, Stanford's hous
ing system is unusual because
it's "very sophisticated," said

Bever.
"There's nothing to compare
to it — it's very responsive to
both students and the com
munity," explained Bever. He
described the University as "a
big enough place and confi
dent enough institution" to
provide a "tone which is con
ducive to finding your own
niche."
Bever said he hasn't "been
around long enough" to be
aware of what problems might
come up with thewide rangeof
houses on the Row, but said
the diversity doesn't bother
him because "my experiences
and interests have been rela
tively broad."
"I like the energy and
idealism that goes into co-ops,
but I also have a lot of respect
for the frats," said Bever.
"They get a lot of ribbing about
the 'Animal House syndrome,'
but that's really not the image
that Stanford frats have."
Thirty-year-old Bever, who
lives on Mayfield Avenue with
his wife and 2-year-old daugh
ter, said he runs 25 to 40 miles
per week. His other hobbies
include music and reading
"the kind of books that are
challenging and make you
think."

Housing system
However, Stanford's hous
ing system is unusual because
it's "very sophisticated," said

Bever.
"There's nothing to compare
to it — it's very responsive to
both students and the com
munity," explained Bever. He
described the University as "a
big enough place and confi
dent enough institution" to
provide a "tone which is con
ducive to finding your own
niche."
Bever said he hasn't "been
around long enough" to be
aware of what problems might
come up with thewide rangeof
houses on the Row, but said
the diversity doesn't bother
him because "my experiences
and interests have been rela
tively broad."
"I like the energy and
idealism that goes into co-ops,
but I also have a lot of respect
for the frats," said Bever.
"They get a lot of ribbing about
the 'Animal House syndrome,'
but that's really not the image
that Stanford frats have."
Thirty-year-old Bever, who
lives on Mayfield Avenue with
his wife and 2-year-old daugh
ter, said he runs 25 to 40 miles
per week. His other hobbies
include music and reading
"the kind of books that are
challenging and make you
think."

"The genius of the Row is its
diversity. It makes the Row un
ique in higher education," said
new Row Director Michael Be
ver.
Bever began the job four
months ago when former Row
Director Karen Harrison res
igned. At the same time assis
tant Row Director Tom
Hornbeak resigned and the
Row office secretary transfer
red to another position here.
"The biggest challenge was
starting over with an entirely
new office and people who had
never worked with the Row be
fore," said Bever. "The job is
unique. There's no place you
can get relevant experience."
However, "as for the role it
self, I feel extremely comforta
ble in it," continued Bever, as
he leaned back in his chair with
his hands clasped behind his
head.
"I'm doing things I've done
before, only in a new context,

and sort of putting them all to
gether," heexplained. "I could
tell even after the first day of
the job that the glove fit per
fectly," he added.
Escondido Village
Bever has worked here for
the past two years as manager
of Escondido Village, where he
was involved with the housing
for graduate students and their
families. Bever said he also had
programmatic responsibilities,
"but they were of secondary
importance as the job was de
fined."
Bever got his first housing
job, a combination of residen
tial education and housing
management, at LaVerne Col
lege in Southern California. At
the time Bever was in a Ph.D.
program in ethics at Claremont
Men's College and planning to
teach philosophy of religion.
Bever said he was interested in
the field since both his father
and grandfather were minis
ters.

Born in Princeton, Indiana
and raised in northeastern In
diana, Bever ended up major
ing in American Studies and
history at Anderson College, a
small private school also in In
diana. From there he attended
a seminary in Indianapolis and
continued to Claremont grad
school where he began in a re
ligion and liberal arts program,
but eventually moved into the
ethics program.
"The only reason I didn't
finish was it was becoming
more and more a luxury in that
at Claremont, they make you
sweat blood to get a Ph.D.,
especially in my department,"
Bever explained.
LaVerne College
"It was too expensive and
too difficult in terms of family
life," said Bever, adding that
his wife, Rena, had been work
ing at LaVerne College as assis
tant dean of students to put
him through school.

"When I got my first housing
job, it was right after the war
and people were really in
terested in talking about val
ues, so my job fit in well" with
his interest in philosophy and
ethics, commented Bevers.
"I've always looked for that
teaching component in my
work. One reason why I like
this job so much is because
that teaching element is such a
necessary part of my job."
Before coming to Stanford,
Bever also held the position of
director of resident halls at
Claremont Men's College. Ac
cording to Bever, there are "a
lot of similarities" between
Stanford's and Claremont's
housing systems in that the re
sident halls are relatively small,
separate units, and "each
house has its own character."
