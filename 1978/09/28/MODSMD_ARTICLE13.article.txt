# Working for fun, money, sanity
## Many more women now taking on second jobs 
### Associated Press 
Betty Rogam of New York has
two jobs as "a matter of survi
val."
)ean Seiler of Pierre, S.D.,
took a second job because "I
wanted to buy a car."
Pam Ashley of Kansas City
works extra hours so "I can
open a savings account."
And Ellen Frank of Pittsburgh
juggles family life, two jobs and
graduate studies "out of love."
The four are among a rapidly
growing number of women
who hold more than one pay
ing job. Labor Department fi
gures show that from May 1976
to May 1977, the number of
women multiple jobholders
rose by more than one-third to
more than 1.2 million.
Men still account for most of
the multiple jobholders, but
the picture is changing. In May
1977, women represented 27
percent of all multiple jobhol
ders. Seven years earlier, they
represented 1b percent. Half
the female multiple jobholders
are married; 69 percent are be
tween the ages of 20 and 45.
Why do they do it?
"I've got more bills than I've
got money," said Susie Wil
liams, 21, who works during
the week for the Nashville,
Tenn., Police Department and
spends six hours every Sunday
giving directions and informa
tion to customers at a new
shopping mall.
Labor Department figures
show 53.8 percent of the
women holding more than one
job do so for financial reasons.
About one-third need the extra
work to meet regular ex
penses; the others want to buy
something special, save for the

future or, like Williams, pay off
debts.
Here is a look at what work
ing two jobs can mean:
Betty Rogam — her name
and some of the details of her
life are disguised at her request
— earns about $8000 a year as a
teacher at a private,
Montessori-method school in
Bayonne, N.J., about an hour's
drive from her home in Man
hattan. Three nights a week,
she is a waitress in a restaurant
in New York's theater district.
She works from 4:30 p.m. to 8
p.m. Thursdays and from 4:30
p.m. to 1 a.m. Fridays and
Saturdays, earning $150 to $180
a week.
Rogam, 30, says teaching is
"something that I really love"
and she plans to continue after
she gets married sometime
next year. She does not feel the
same about the restaurant
work. "There's such anxiety.
This is the most horrible job in
the whole world."
Rogam works two jobs "be
cause I'm on my own. It's . . .
survival." The extra money
helps make ends meet, but the
two jobs mean she spends
more than she otherwise
would. "I never clean my own
house. I hire a maid . . . Trans
portation costs $100 a month
. . Rogam's biggest regret is
"that I didn't have time to start
a family earlier." Is she looking
forward to marriage and the
prospect ot quitting her job as
a waitress? "I can't wait."
lean Seiler, 22, spends eight
hours a day, five days a week as
an offset printer for the state of
South Dakota, earning $7800 a
year. She works at least 16
hours a week as night manager

at a Super Duper grocery store,
earning $3.50 an hour and ad
ding a minimum of abouts3ooo
to her annual income.
Seiler says two jobs "really
cut down on your social life,"
but she manages to find time to
play softball on a team spon
sored by a local business.
"You've just got to watch what
you do."
Seiler started at the super
market in April 1977 so she
could buy a car. The car is paid
for, but she will keep both
jobs. "I'm getting used to the
money. It's almost worth it. It's
the first time I don't have to sit
around worrying about where
the money will come from if
the car needs repairs or won
dering about what happens if I
get sick."
Pam Ashley, 25, spends her
days as a speech therapist for
the Kansas City school system,
earning $10,500 a year. From 6
p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Tuesdaysand
Thursdays, she tends bar at
Blayney's Restaurant, making
$3 an hour, plus $40 to $70 a
night in tips.
Ashley worked as a teacher
after graduation from college,
then quit. She got the job at
Blayney's and, when she went
back to teaching, did not want
to give it up. "You develop
friends that you work with and
they've really become impor
tant to me."
The extra money also is im
portant. "I can save a lot
more," she says, noting that
she spent 10 days in the Virgin
Islands this summer. Ashley
has a boyfriend she sees regu
larly and she works out at a
health club three afternoons a
week. Can she keep it up?
Probably, she says."I might

just play it by ear."
Ellen Frank, 34, is the host of
"Woman Is," a weekly half
hour talk show on KDKA-TV in
Pittsburgh. She does research
in the psychiatry department of
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic and is studying for a
Ph.D. in clinical psychology.
She is married with two
daughters, 7 and 9; three
stepdaughters and a stepson
visit several times a week.
Frank spends "probably 50

hours a week at the hospital."
The TV show, taped Thursdays
and aired Saturdays, takes four
or five hours. She prefers not
to reveal her income, but says
the TV work accounts for about
a fourth of it."I love everything
that I'm doing," she says."I
have always been the kind of
person who is happier the
more I have to do. . . . This is
really out of love."
How does she manage? A
housekeeper comes in two

mornings a week and a univer
sity student who lives witli the
family helps out. "My kids are
very understanding and my
husband is extremely suppor
tive. I also have an ex-husband
with whom we have a very . . .
cooperative relationship and
he spends a good amount of
time each week with my
daughters." Can she see going
on this way indefinitely?
"Well," she says, "I'll be real
relieved when I'm done with
my Ph.D."

the money will come from if
the car needs repairs or won
dering about what happens if I
get sick."
Pam Ashley, 25, spends her
days as a speech therapist for
the Kansas City school system,
earning $10,500 a year. From 6
p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Tuesdaysand
Thursdays, she tends bar at
Blayney's Restaurant, making
$3 an hour, plus $40 to $70 a
night in tips.
Ashley worked as a teacher
after graduation from college,
then quit. She got the job at
Blayney's and, when she went
back to teaching, did not want
to give it up. "You develop
friends that you work with and
they've really become impor
tant to me."
The extra money also is im
portant. "I can save a lot
more," she says, noting that
she spent 10 days in the Virgin
Islands this summer. Ashley
has a boyfriend she sees regu
larly and she works out at a
health club three afternoons a
week. Can she keep it up?
Probably, she says."I might

just play it by ear."
Ellen Frank, 34, is the host of
"Woman Is," a weekly half
hour talk show on KDKA-TV in
Pittsburgh. She does research
in the psychiatry department of
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic and is studying for a
Ph.D. in clinical psychology.
She is married with two
daughters, 7 and 9; three
stepdaughters and a stepson
visit several times a week.
Frank spends "probably 50

hours a week at the hospital."
The TV show, taped Thursdays
and aired Saturdays, takes four
or five hours. She prefers not
to reveal her income, but says
the TV work accounts for about
a fourth of it."I love everything
that I'm doing," she says."I
have always been the kind of
person who is happier the
more I have to do. . . . This is
really out of love."
How does she manage? A
housekeeper comes in two

mornings a week and a univer
sity student who lives witli the
family helps out. "My kids are
very understanding and my
husband is extremely suppor
tive. I also have an ex-husband
with whom we have a very . . .
cooperative relationship and
he spends a good amount of
time each week with my
daughters." Can she see going
on this way indefinitely?
"Well," she says, "I'll be real
relieved when I'm done with
my Ph.D."
Betty Rogam of New York has
two jobs as "a matter of survi

Pam Ashley of Kansas City

And Ellen Frank of Pittsburgh
juggles family life, two jobs and
graduate studies "out of love."
The four are among a rapidly
growing number of women
who hold more than one pay
ing job. Labor Department fi
gures show that from May 1976
to May 1977, the number of
women multiple jobholders
rose by more than one-third to
more than 1.2 million.
Men still account for most of
the multiple jobholders, but
the picture is changing. In May
1977, women represented 27
percent of all multiple jobhol
ders. Seven years earlier, they
represented 1b percent. Half
the female multiple jobholders
are married; 69 percent are be
tween the ages of 20 and 45.
Why do they do it?
"I've got more bills than I've
got money," said Susie Wil
liams, 21, who works during
the week for the Nashville,
Tenn., Police Department and
spends six hours every Sunday
giving directions and informa
tion to customers at a new
shopping mall.
Labor Department figures
show 53.8 percent of the
women holding more than one
job do so for financial reasons.
About one-third need the extra
work to meet regular ex
penses; the others want to buy
something special, save for the

future or, like Williams, pay off
debts.
Here is a look at what work
ing two jobs can mean:
Betty Rogam — her name
and some of the details of her
life are disguised at her request
— earns about $8000 a year as a
teacher at a private,
Montessori-method school in
Bayonne, N.J., about an hour's
drive from her home in Man
hattan. Three nights a week,
she is a waitress in a restaurant
in New York's theater district.
She works from 4:30 p.m. to 8
p.m. Thursdays and from 4:30
p.m. to 1 a.m. Fridays and
Saturdays, earning $150 to $180
a week.
Rogam, 30, says teaching is
"something that I really love"
and she plans to continue after
she gets married sometime
next year. She does not feel the
same about the restaurant
work. "There's such anxiety.
This is the most horrible job in
the whole world."
Rogam works two jobs "be
cause I'm on my own. It's . . .
survival." The extra money
helps make ends meet, but the
two jobs mean she spends
more than she otherwise
would. "I never clean my own
house. I hire a maid . . . Trans
portation costs $100 a month
. . Rogam's biggest regret is
"that I didn't have time to start
a family earlier." Is she looking
forward to marriage and the
prospect ot quitting her job as
a waitress? "I can't wait."
lean Seiler, 22, spends eight
hours a day, five days a week as
an offset printer for the state of
South Dakota, earning $7800 a
year. She works at least 16
hours a week as night manager

at a Super Duper grocery store,
earning $3.50 an hour and ad
ding a minimum of abouts3ooo
to her annual income.
Seiler says two jobs "really
cut down on your social life,"
but she manages to find time to
play softball on a team spon
sored by a local business.
"You've just got to watch what
you do."
Seiler started at the super
market in April 1977 so she
could buy a car. The car is paid
for, but she will keep both
jobs. "I'm getting used to the
money. It's almost worth it. It's
the first time I don't have to sit
around worrying about where
the money will come from if
the car needs repairs or won
dering about what happens if I
get sick."
