# Annual rate increase sought by Pacific phone company
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Pacific
Telephone Co. is seeking an
annual rate increase of $471
million but the Public Utilities
Commission staff urged earlier
this week that current rates be
cut by $234 million instead.
The utility also has asked for
$26 million in additional direc
tory advertising revenue and
$20 million more in Centrex
rates to put the total request
before the PUC at $517 million.
The spread between what
Pacific Telephone wants and
PUC staff members recom
mend is $751 million.
The differences will be the
subject of a large number of
exhibits and thousands of
words of testimony and argu
ments in the technical phase of
the rate hearing which got un
derway Tuesday before PUC
Administrative Law )udge Or
ville Wright and will continue
into )anuary. Public witnesses
testified earlier in the case as
signed to Commissioners
Claire Dedrick and Richard
C ravel le.
The PUC staff said its re
commendations were based
on estimates using revenues,
expenses and rate of return on
Pacific Telephone's current
rates for a 1979 test year.
These projections, the staff
said, would provide Pacific
with a rate of return on its in
trastate rate base of 11.16 per
cent. The staff has recom
mended 9.4 percent and the
current authorized rate is 8.843
percent.
The difference between the
projected and recommended
rate of return is 1.76 percent
which translates into $234 mill
ion.

L.R. Waters, Pacific Tele
phone vice president for reg
ulatory matters, said the staff
recommendation does not
necessarily represent views of
the five PUC members who will
determine the outcome.
He also said the staff report
has a "number of major
shortcomings," with revenue
estimates "greatly overstated,"
1979 expense estimates
"grossly understated," and
certain estimates based on
programs and technology
which won't be available until
1980 or later.

"While revenues have gone
up so have our expenses, a fac
tor the PUC staff seems to have
ignored. Inflation continues to
impact heavily on our busi
ness," Waters said.
The official said the 1978
construction program had to
be increased from $1.4 billion
to a record $1.8 billion and a
similar increase is planned for
next year.
He said if the PUC adopts its
staff's recommendations,
"Pacific Telephone's ability to
provide California with mod
ern communications service
would be severely affected."
