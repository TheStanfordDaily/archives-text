## Rob Docters Open ballots desirable 
### 
Why do you support secret ballots? I do not,
and I would accuse you of being self serving,
patronizing or a sniveling coward if you do.
I would suggest that being able to exercise a
power (i.e. something that affects other
people) without ever having to be individually
accountable is the definition of irresponsible.
If my neighbor down the street casts a ballot
that costs me more taxes, restricts a freedom
or may even send me off to fight in a war, I
believe that I should be able to find that out —
if I choose — and speak to him/her about it. I
may even choose to mete out reprisals, and
never say a civil word to that person again.
Perhaps, then they will think twice before rais
ing my taxes again (or, even, lowering them, if
I disapprove of that).
This may prompt an objection to open bal
lots in the minds of many people: Is it right
that I give this sort of feedback? I would
suggest yes. That person certainly receives
comments on many of the other things he or
she does.
With open ballots there will — for some
voters — certainly be new (and perhaps even
major) costs associated with voting, but that
does not deprive them of any real rights, and I
ask: are these new costs bad?
For the last several elections in my home
state, the American Nazi party has consis
tently received several hundred votes. I find it
unfortunate that they receive any. However,
had there been open balloting, I doubt they
would have received a dozen votes, and I find
that positive. Granted, this would actually
have made little different e regarding how my
state is run, but I present the example as a
simplistic illustration that positive potential
exists with open ballots.
And the negative? Clearly there is some.
The scenario typically posted is: Won't
employers fire employees if the latter vote for
opposed interests? The answer is clear: un
doubtedly some would. Hut three observa
tions must be made in that connection.
First, it one believes in private property and
private ownership, one must concede that as
the right of the owners. Anything less would
be a compromise of the idea of fully private
ownership. You may favor such a com
promise, but do recognize it as a com

promise, and that this creates various prob
lems of its own.
Second, it is highly unlikely that such large
scale reprisals will occur, if for no other
reason than (despite slack economies) it is
very expensive to find and train new
employees. Further, there are extremely
powerful unions (often ideologically dis
tanced from management) to block such
voting-inspired hirings and firings.
Third, a minor point. With open ballots, it
may well be harder to practice political
machine vote-fraud, simply as one can gain an
absolute account of where nearly every vote
came from. While this may make it easier for
machines to enforce voter "discipline, that,
while unfortunate, must be a minor effect.
But to summarize a few of the significant
positive effects:
—Voters would have to take individual re
sponsibility for their actions. While today the
costs an irresponsible voter incurs are almost
negligible to himself, with open ballots
people would realize more was at stake than a
single vote. People would have to behave re
sponsibly — or face possible criticism.
—The people affected by the outcomes of
elections/referenda, etc. (all of us, really)
could face, quite directly, the people
controlling/influencing their lives.
—On a micro level (e.g. people talking to
one another), information and criticisms
could be channeled more effectively, for gre
ater optimality of results.
—We would have the beginnings of true
openness in government. The voter is, after
all, the first level o! government. Little wonder
government is secretive if its foundations are
too.
Perhaps the final comment is a shade odd in
connection with the above writing. Given
that, until recently, America had open ballots
in most states, and there was no social
political revolution with the introduction of
the secret ballot, we should not expect one
with the reverse process. In other words, this
proposal is not one for radical change. I would
only suggest that, in subtle yet meaningful
ways, the changes would be for the better.

lems of its own.
Second, it is highly unlikely that such large
scale reprisals will occur, if for no other
reason than (despite slack economies) it is
very expensive to find and train new
employees. Further, there are extremely
powerful unions (often ideologically dis
tanced from management) to block such
voting-inspired hirings and firings.
Third, a minor point. With open ballots, it
may well be harder to practice political
machine vote-fraud, simply as one can gain an
absolute account of where nearly every vote
came from. While this may make it easier for
machines to enforce voter "discipline, that,
while unfortunate, must be a minor effect.
But to summarize a few of the significant
positive effects:
—Voters would have to take individual re
sponsibility for their actions. While today the
costs an irresponsible voter incurs are almost
negligible to himself, with open ballots
people would realize more was at stake than a
single vote. People would have to behave re
sponsibly — or face possible criticism.
—The people affected by the outcomes of
elections/referenda, etc. (all of us, really)
could face, quite directly, the people
controlling/influencing their lives.
—On a micro level (e.g. people talking to
one another), information and criticisms
could be channeled more effectively, for gre
ater optimality of results.
—We would have the beginnings of true
openness in government. The voter is, after
all, the first level o! government. Little wonder
government is secretive if its foundations are
too.
Perhaps the final comment is a shade odd in
connection with the above writing. Given
that, until recently, America had open ballots
in most states, and there was no social
political revolution with the introduction of
the secret ballot, we should not expect one
with the reverse process. In other words, this
proposal is not one for radical change. I would
only suggest that, in subtle yet meaningful
ways, the changes would be for the better.
