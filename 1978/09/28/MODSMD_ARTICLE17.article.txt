## ASSU Senate: powerlessness is problem 
### 
Editor s note: is the first part of an open
letter given to a II prospective ASSU senate
candidates. A second part will be printed
tomorrow.
As you are probably aware, the ASSU
Senate is under siege as one of the rep
resentative institutions in the Student
Government. The ballot proposal submit
ted by the Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politit (is (CRAP) would abolish the Senate.
The legislation does not provide for any
body to fulfill the Senate's present func
tions in toto. However, the Constitutional
Amendments proposed by CRAP would
shitt most of the Senate's duties to the
Council of Presidents. This state of affairs
places a special responsibility on the
shoulders of the candidates in this year's
Senate race. Obviously, if you are running
for a seat on the Senate, you must have
some reason to believe that this body
should exist as a forum for political deci
sion making. Therefore, in your campaign
you are essentially obligated to de
monstrate not only why you believe that
you would make a good Senator, but also
why you believe that the Senate should be
retained bv the electorate.
The proposal by CRAP did not manifest
itself in a vacuum. There are reasons why
people are frustrated with the perfor
mance of the Senate. As last year's Senate
Chairperson, I saw some of the follies of
this legislative body as well as some of the
potential that the Senate had, has, and will
have if the voters decide to defeat the
Constitutional Ammendments on this
Fall's ballot. I et me take a few moments of
your time to delineate some of my obser
vations. I hope that this little expose will

help you to decide whether or not it is
worth your time and energy to run out and
knock on freshpeople's doors. If you are
already committed tothis course of action,
then I hope this description of some of the
realities at the ASSU will aid you in your
campaign.
The Senate is composed of 20 voting
members and 20 non-voting alternates.
These seats are evenly divided between
the graduate and undergraduate con
stituencies. In essence, this means that if
the Senate should have perfect attendance
there would be 40 people who have the
privilege of debate. Last year, and in other
past years, there was hardly perfect atten
dance. Usually there would be but five
Graduate Senators — including alternates
— who would attend meetings. And yet
the meetings were long and tedious.
Everybody had to say something about ev
erything. Agendas would invariably be left
unfinished, and business would be carried
over to the next meeting.
One of the contributing factors to the
continually long meetings was the poor
attendance at Committee meetings. In
fact, the By-Law Committee never met dur
ing the Senate's term. I would contend
that if Senators were more prepared for
meetings of the Senate, if the elected rep
resentatives of the Student Body had regu
larly done substantial amounts of the Se
nate's work in Committee instead of on
the Senate floor, and if Senators had been
more professional and responsible in their
debate, the Senate could have been (and
very well might be in the future) a more
efficient and effective legislature. Unfor
tunately, many people who decide to run

for the Senatedo not realize the amount of
time that the office will take from their
other life activities. Thus, when these
people are elected they do not carry their
share of the workload. This tends to
"burn-out" those people who do take
their responsibilities as a Senator reason
ably seriously. Those who would be
Senators must be prepared to work hard
both during Senate meetings and outside
of the Senate "chambers" if the Senate is
going to be decisive in its action.
The primary problem with the ASSU Se
nate and the whole of Student Govern
ment is powerlessness. The Administra
tion of this University has basically main
tained strict control over the decision mak
ing processes in this institution. The Ad
ministration pays lip-service to the ideal of
student input in University affairs mainly
through its "generous" allowance of stu
dent participation in the University Com
mittee system. I believe that this year the
ASSU must shed some public light on the
absolute farce that this system is in the
context of who really has power, who re
ally makes the decisions. At the same time
the ASSU must make it known that the
Student Government really has very little
control over anything. At many other in
stitutions of higher learning across the na
tion the student governments play a more
crucial role in the formulation of Univer
sity policies as well as the delivery of stu
dent services. This, in essence, gives these
students more control over their educa
tional experience as well as the environ
ment in which they pursue their educa
tional goals.
(Fred Crcthel is chairman of the existing
ASSU senate.)
