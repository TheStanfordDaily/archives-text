## Energy, jobs, and environment 
### 
Must we sacrifice jobs to clean our envi
ronment? The worker has been asked to
make a choice between his livelihood and
dying of cancer as industry claims that the
cost of environmental controls are too ex
pensive and havean "inflationary impact."
Industry claims that protective equipment
will replace jobs and if regulations are too
tough, they will close or move to other
areas or nations where the "industrial cli
mate is more favorable."
Our government and major energy in
dustries seem to be more concerned
about the "inflationary impact" of pollu
tion control than they are concerned
about their debilitating effects on the
worker and community. Americans are
being told that public health must be sac
rificed to maintain and maximize high cor
porate profits.
The worker and community need not
yield to this "environmental blackmail" of
choosing between cleaning up the envi
ronment and jobs, if protection of
people's health and environmental quality
becomes the primary objective, rather
than maximization of corporate profits.
It is simply not true that environmen
talists are job destroyers — for far more
jobs are won than lost as a result of pollu
tion abatement. Environmental regula
tions have displaced only .02 percent of
the nation's work force in the last eight
years. A total of 20,000 jobs were lost be
cause the industrial plants could not meet
water or air pollution standards. These
same laws and regulations which cost
20,000 jobs, at the same time created one
million new jobs in a brand new pollution
control industry. In tact, each billion dol
lars of environmental protection creates
between 40,000 and 80,000 jobs.
Energy industries and government
agencies have been trying for years to
convince the public: that more energy will
be needed to fuel the economy and gen
erate eniployment. But the economy can
improve and employment increase with
out an increase in energy use or produc
tion. Last year in California, the electricity
growth rate declined 50 percent, yet per
sonal income rose 12.5 percent, and nearly
500,000 new jobs were created.
Most of our energy needs until the year
2000 could be met simply by increasing the
efficiency of already existing facilities
through conservation, cogeneration, and
recycling. In energy-efficient West Ger
many, Sweden, and Switzerland, half as

much energy per captia is used, yet their
standard of living matches ours and there
is less unemployment.
A large percentage of U.S. energy is lost
as waste or through inefficient conver
sion. President Carter announced last year
"that our energy waste in transportation is
85 percent, in generating electricity 65
percent. Overall, 50 percent of our energy
is wasted."
Energy efficiency programs are cheaper
than energy production projects and pro
vide far more jobs. The Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA) estimates in a recent
study that high-impact conservation prog
rams create more jobs than building new
power plants to generate an equivalent
amount of energy. Furthermore, the costs
to deliver the equivalent amount of energy
through conservation are one-sixth the
cost of delivery from a new thermal power
plant]
The Senate Commerce Committee staff
has estimated that $1.6 billion in interest
subsidies and loan guarantees for conser
vation retrofits would generate 400,000
jobs.
If U.S. industry would cogenerate —
make electricity from industrial steam —
one-half of all their electricity needs by
1985 would be met and $20-50 billion in
investments would be saved. This would
conserve the equivalent of 2-.i million bar
rels of oil per day and obviate the need for
50 large nuclear reactors.
There is overwhelming evidence today
that solar technologies — biomass, small
hydro, and wind power — are technically
viable, economically competitive, en
vironmentally attractive and most impor
tantly provide more and safer jobs. Gov
ernor Brown has already identified the de
velopment of renewable energy sources
and the creation of new jobs as the "major
priority of his administration." Brown's
goal of 20 percent of all California water
and space heating systems in residences
and commercial buildings fueled by the
sun in 1985 would result in the employ
ment of more than 50,000 people.
With solar energy, Americans will be
come more energy independent and can
be assured that enough safe energy will be
available and that the people will be able
to control its production and use. New
employment opportunities that are safet
will exist for low and semi-skilled workers
as well as for skilled buildings trades
people like machinist, architects, and en

gineers in the development of solar
technologies.
Solar technologies do not pollute the
workplace or environment as much, pro
duce no bombgrade materials, are less
vulnerable to attack or breakdown, are
easily adapted to local conditions, labor,
and materials, and they make available
money through energy savings and quick
investment return.
Recent testimony before the Senate
Energy Subcommittee form the California
state Employment Development Depart
ment indicates that the solar-conservation
equivalent to nuclear energy provided
about six times as many jobs and 3-4 times
the number of person years of work.
Yet as a nation we are not moving politi
cally toward solar and this year 40 percent
of ERDA's budget increase will be ab
sorbed by nuclear fusion. Altogether four
times the money will be directed to fission
and fusion technologies as compared to
solar and conservation technologies.
The large energy systems proposed hy
ERDA and DOE will absorb by 1985 nine
hundred to one trillion dollars in invest
ments. This represents about three quar
ters of all private investment capital in the
U.S. This leaves little money for invest
ments in other areas which serve people's
needs, provide more jobs per dollar, con
sume less energy and resources, and do
not have an adverse impact on people or
the environment.
It is time the public advocated conserva
tion and the development of solar as a
means of creating employment. As citi
zens we must compare the impact of
energy technologies in terms of health,
employment, quality of life, safety, and
economic equity.
An alliance between students, commun
ity, labor unions, consumers, and en
vironmentalists can influence decisions
being made today in government about
what options are most socially desirable in
terms of maximizing human welfare.
Every individual can assist by reducing
their energy waste and is encouraged to
actively express their concern politically
overdecisions relating toenergy, the envi
ronment, and jobs.
Energy sufficiency with safe energy
supplying technologies and full employ
ment with jobs that are environmentally
benign is a goal in the common interest of
all citizens.

about six times as many jobs and 3-4 times
the number of person years of work.
Yet as a nation we are not moving politi
cally toward solar and this year 40 percent
of ERDA's budget increase will be ab
sorbed by nuclear fusion. Altogether four
times the money will be directed to fission
and fusion technologies as compared to
solar and conservation technologies.
The large energy systems proposed hy
ERDA and DOE will absorb by 1985 nine
hundred to one trillion dollars in invest

ters of all private investment capital in the
U.S. This leaves little money for invest
ments in other areas which serve people's
needs, provide more jobs per dollar, con
sume less energy and resources, and do
not have an adverse impact on people or
the environment.
It is time the public advocated conserva

means of creating employment. As citi
zens we must compare the impact of
energy technologies in terms of health,
employment, quality of life, safety, and
economic equity.

Must we sacrifice jobs to clean our envi
ronment? The worker has been asked to
make a choice between his livelihood and
dying of cancer as industry claims that the
cost of environmental controls are too ex
pensive and havean "inflationary impact."
Industry claims that protective equipment
will replace jobs and if regulations are too
tough, they will close or move to other
areas or nations where the "industrial cli
mate is more favorable."
Our government and major energy in
dustries seem to be more concerned
about the "inflationary impact" of pollu
tion control than they are concerned
about their debilitating effects on the
worker and community. Americans are
being told that public health must be sac
rificed to maintain and maximize high cor
porate profits.
The worker and community need not
yield to this "environmental blackmail" of
choosing between cleaning up the envi
ronment and jobs, if protection of
people's health and environmental quality
becomes the primary objective, rather
than maximization of corporate profits.
It is simply not true that environmen
talists are job destroyers — for far more
jobs are won than lost as a result of pollu
tion abatement. Environmental regula
tions have displaced only .02 percent of
the nation's work force in the last eight
years. A total of 20,000 jobs were lost be
cause the industrial plants could not meet
water or air pollution standards. These
same laws and regulations which cost
20,000 jobs, at the same time created one
million new jobs in a brand new pollution
control industry. In tact, each billion dol
lars of environmental protection creates
between 40,000 and 80,000 jobs.
Energy industries and government
agencies have been trying for years to
convince the public: that more energy will
be needed to fuel the economy and gen
erate eniployment. But the economy can
improve and employment increase with
out an increase in energy use or produc
tion. Last year in California, the electricity
growth rate declined 50 percent, yet per
sonal income rose 12.5 percent, and nearly
500,000 new jobs were created.
Most of our energy needs until the year
2000 could be met simply by increasing the
efficiency of already existing facilities
through conservation, cogeneration, and
recycling. In energy-efficient West Ger
many, Sweden, and Switzerland, half as

much energy per captia is used, yet their
standard of living matches ours and there
is less unemployment.
A large percentage of U.S. energy is lost
as waste or through inefficient conver
sion. President Carter announced last year
"that our energy waste in transportation is
85 percent, in generating electricity 65
percent. Overall, 50 percent of our energy
is wasted."
Energy efficiency programs are cheaper
than energy production projects and pro
vide far more jobs. The Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA) estimates in a recent
study that high-impact conservation prog
rams create more jobs than building new
power plants to generate an equivalent
amount of energy. Furthermore, the costs
to deliver the equivalent amount of energy
through conservation are one-sixth the
cost of delivery from a new thermal power
plant]
The Senate Commerce Committee staff
has estimated that $1.6 billion in interest
subsidies and loan guarantees for conser
vation retrofits would generate 400,000
jobs.
If U.S. industry would cogenerate —
make electricity from industrial steam —
one-half of all their electricity needs by
1985 would be met and $20-50 billion in
investments would be saved. This would
conserve the equivalent of 2-.i million bar
rels of oil per day and obviate the need for
50 large nuclear reactors.
There is overwhelming evidence today
that solar technologies — biomass, small
hydro, and wind power — are technically
viable, economically competitive, en
vironmentally attractive and most impor
tantly provide more and safer jobs. Gov
ernor Brown has already identified the de
velopment of renewable energy sources
and the creation of new jobs as the "major
priority of his administration." Brown's
goal of 20 percent of all California water
and space heating systems in residences
and commercial buildings fueled by the
sun in 1985 would result in the employ
ment of more than 50,000 people.
With solar energy, Americans will be
come more energy independent and can
be assured that enough safe energy will be
available and that the people will be able
to control its production and use. New
employment opportunities that are safet
will exist for low and semi-skilled workers
as well as for skilled buildings trades
people like machinist, architects, and en

gineers in the development of solar
technologies.
Solar technologies do not pollute the
workplace or environment as much, pro
duce no bombgrade materials, are less
vulnerable to attack or breakdown, are
easily adapted to local conditions, labor,
and materials, and they make available
money through energy savings and quick
investment return.
Recent testimony before the Senate
Energy Subcommittee form the California
state Employment Development Depart
ment indicates that the solar-conservation
equivalent to nuclear energy provided
about six times as many jobs and 3-4 times
the number of person years of work.
