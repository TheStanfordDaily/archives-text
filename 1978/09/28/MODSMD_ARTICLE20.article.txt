## Can the PLO be ignored? 
### 
Amidst the climate of
euphoria in which the Camp
David accord was sealed,
signed and presented to the
American people, everyone
seems to forget a more funda
mental issue: that the
of the Middle East conflict is in
fact the Palestinian problem.
Egypt ar, d Israel might never
have come to conflict had it not
been for the Palestinians.
II is understandable that Is
rael may want to ignore the
Palestinians. Former Prime
Minister Golda Meirattempted
to eradicate even reference to
their existence with her fam
ous 1969 aphorism: "There was
no such thing as Palestinians
when we came here."
For the U.S., the Palestinians
always posed a bothersome
complication. The "geniuses"
at the state department would
like to simplify the Mid-East
problem into a series of reg
ional conflicts.
Many Americans equate the
Palestinians to the PLO, which
is presented as a rutheless,
bloodthirsty terrorist organiza
tion. Depending, of course, on
one's viewpoint, the PLO
could be and has been charac
terized in diametrically diffe
rent terms. In either case, the
PLO cannot be ignored. It en
joys widespread support in the
Arab world. This, indirectly,
provides the PLO with substan
tial power. Even in oil rich
Saudi Arabia, a country under
considerable U.S. influence, it
is viewed as the "only legiti
mate representative" of the
Palestinians. Throughout the
world, including many western
countries, the PLO is consi
dered a bonafide resistence
organization, with quite re
spectable aims.
At the end of last week Presi
dent Carter provided a flagrant
example of this ignorant and
amateurish attitude towards
the PLO. Asked in a town meet
ing why this organization is al
lowed to maintian an informa
tion office in the U.S., he said
that the Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan
and the Communist Party have
the same privilege. Fie pro

ceeded to add that this is co
vered by the First Amendment
to the Constitution. The Com
munist Party aside, to put the
Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in
the same category as the PLO
could not sit very well in the
Arab capitals.
The irony of the situation is
that his own secretary of state
was at the same time trying
very hard to drum up support
for the Camp David accords in
a whirlwind tour of Arab capi
tals. To undercut Cyrus Van
ce's efforts, a mountainous
task to begin with, is incom
prehensible. Carter once again
proved his inability to conduct
credible foreign policy.
Any Middle East agreement
that doesn't take the Palesti

nians into account and also ig
nores the PLO is doomed to
fail. In fact agreements for
separate peace could pose ad
ditional dangers, since the
Palestinians (aided by other
powers) may intensify the vio
lence if they feel the carpet pul
led from under their feet.
It is not unusual for "ter
rorists" to come to a confer
ence table. Yesterday's ter
rorist is tomorrow's statesman.
It is imperative for Israel toface
the reality of the Palestinians
and the PLO. For the U.S. and
President Carter, a little more
prudence, study and mouth
control could not hurt.
