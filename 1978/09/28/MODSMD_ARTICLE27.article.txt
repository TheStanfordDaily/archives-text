# Lively arts performers assist in outreach efforts
## 
### LEAH HALPER 
When Vicky Holt, Director of Stanford's Of
fice of Public Events, gets her way, fourth grad
ers groove to the music of the Billy Taylor trio.
Senior citizens savor Baroque arrangements
of flute and guitar. Stanford students meet ar
tists like Clamma Dale, a six-foot tall soprano, at
the airport. And dorm parties offer a unique
opportunity for sipping sherry with such nota
bles as Igor Kipnis, today's foremost
harpsichordist.
All of this is an outgrowth of Holt's philosophy
that artists who perform at Stanford under the
auspices of the Lively Arts program should also
donate some time and talent to the surrounding
community. This program is called Community
Outreach, Holt said.
"I believe a university should be in the per
forming arts business because it's educational,"
she said. With that goal in mind, Holt piloted the
Community Outreach Program in December,
and the success of the program has allowed for
its expansion this year.
Take off
"There has been a great guns take off," Holt
said. "This year we will sponsor 57 events from
Cupertino to Redwood City in an effort to get
the fine arts to the people in the community so
people can have richer contact with artists."
Craig Leitner, Community Outreach Coor
dinator, agrees. "They are not creatures who
walk on and off concert stages," he said. "We
need to make artists more human."
This season, many of the dozens of dancers,
mimes, and musicians who will visit Stanford
University will also travel to local schools, senior
citizen centers, the Jewish Community Center,
the Children's Hospital and East Palo Alto. A
number of events, open to the public, are also
planned. Workshops, parties and department
sponsored seminars will be offered for any Stan
ford students interested in meeting playwright
Edward Albee, mimes Bert Houle and Sophie
Wibaux, or a number of other artists.
Student input
Holt said that student input is important, and
points out that student requests for more jazz
and dance programs have led to an increased
number of jazz and dance series.

"We have formed a student commission for
the lively arts," she said. "Freshmen who are
interested in joining should come by this office
right now to apply." The office is located next to
the Old Firehouse in the News and Publications
building.
The 15-member Public Events Board oversees
and aids the artist program.
For those who would rather just attend the
series, Holt said that there are a number of ad
vantages this year.
"For just $3.50 you can buy the best seat in the
house. In fact," she smiled, "student atten
dance percentages are up already this year."
Attributing this to good publicity, Holt also
praised the taste of students, who are very
knowledgeable about the fine arts, she said.
"I have often heard very sophisticated student
discussions in the lobby about the programs,"
she said. "Right now chamber music is a really
hot item. I have a feeling that if I put four string
players in Dinkelspiel Auditorium and yelled,
'String quartet!' it would sell out."
Student rates
For students who wish to attend a majority of
the program offerings in one of seven series, a
season subscription is offered at a 30 percent
discount. Dance, theatre, mime, and music
programs will range in price from $13.50 to
$39.50 for several performances in any one
series.
The artists are paid by the contributions of
students who attend, sponsoring patrons, and,
in the case of Outreach artists, a special grant.
Sometimes extra money is needed to entice ar
tists to participate in Outreach, but Holt said this
is not always necessary.
In some cases, the reward to an artist is no
thing more than the appreciation of the Palo
Alto community.
"With Proposition 13, participation in the arts
has dropped," Leitner said. "Some schools
don't have the money for this kind of thing, but
the community response has gone very well,
especially from senior citizens and schools."
Information about subscriptions, program of
ferings, and the Outreach Program can be ob
tained by calling Leitner at 497-2551.

The Juillard Quartet will be one of many musical groups to perform as part of the Lively Arts program this

points out that student requests for more jazz
and dance programs have led to an increased
number of jazz and dance series.

"We have formed a student commission for
the lively arts," she said. "Freshmen who are
interested in joining should come by this office
right now to apply." The office is located next to
the Old Firehouse in the News and Publications
building.
The 15-member Public Events Board oversees
and aids the artist program.
For those who would rather just attend the
series, Holt said that there are a number of ad
vantages this year.
"For just $3.50 you can buy the best seat in the
house. In fact," she smiled, "student atten
dance percentages are up already this year."
Attributing this to good publicity, Holt also
praised the taste of students, who are very
knowledgeable about the fine arts, she said.
"I have often heard very sophisticated student
discussions in the lobby about the programs,"
she said. "Right now chamber music is a really
hot item. I have a feeling that if I put four string
players in Dinkelspiel Auditorium and yelled,
'String quartet!' it would sell out."
Student rates
For students who wish to attend a majority of
the program offerings in one of seven series, a
season subscription is offered at a 30 percent
discount. Dance, theatre, mime, and music
programs will range in price from $13.50 to
$39.50 for several performances in any one
series.
The artists are paid by the contributions of
students who attend, sponsoring patrons, and,
in the case of Outreach artists, a special grant.
Sometimes extra money is needed to entice ar
tists to participate in Outreach, but Holt said this
is not always necessary.
In some cases, the reward to an artist is no
thing more than the appreciation of the Palo
Alto community.
"With Proposition 13, participation in the arts
has dropped," Leitner said. "Some schools
don't have the money for this kind of thing, but
the community response has gone very well,
especially from senior citizens and schools."
Information about subscriptions, program of
ferings, and the Outreach Program can be ob
tained by calling Leitner at 497-2551.
