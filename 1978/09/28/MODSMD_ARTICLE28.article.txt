## Movies/ron lillejord Woody Allen painfully searches with 'Interiors' 
### 
While I don't think that
Woody Allen's Interiors is a
great movie, honest and
deeply felt effort obviously
went into making it, and there
is something great (and, sadly,
rare) in that.
Without question, Woody
Allen was risking tremendous
critical and financial failure in
making Interiors. For Interiors
is a 'serious film,' and I can
merely echo other critics'
praise for Allen's courage in
departing so markedly from his
past work, especially on the
heels of his most successful
comedy, Annie Hall.
Of course, Interiors also rep
resents a tremendous artistic

challenge for writer-director
Allen. Clearly Bergman influ
enced, but with an American
sensibility, Interiors explores
the interrelationships within
an upper class, well-educated
family whose central figures
are the mother, Eve (Geraldine
Page) and her three grown
daughters, Renata (Diane
Keaton), |oey(Marybeth Hurt)
and Flyn (Kristen Griffith). A
very controlled, very precise
woman, Eve has highly de
veloped artistic talents. Her
personality has strongly influ
enced her three daughters;
they also have very strong crea
tive desires, but because of the
constrictive atmosphere of
their upbringing, they all have
problems dealing with the out
side world and with each
other.
Shattering separation
When the family's father, Ar
thur (E.G. Marshall), tells Eve
that he wants a "trial separa
tion," Eve's tightly constructed
world is shattered.
In Arthur's mind, the separa
tion is a permanent one, but
Eve cannot deal with this real
ity, and very rapidly, she falls
into madness. This type of ina
bility to cope with change is
central to Interiors, and is im

portant to understanding its
characters.
Additional change comes in
the form of Pearl (Maureen
Stapleton), whom Arthur mar
ries in the second half of the
film. An earthy, very open wo
man, Pearl lacks Eve's intellec
tual and artistic capacities, but
she provides the warmth pre
viously missing from Arthur's
life.
The three daughters have
great difficulties with Pearl
(joey calls her a "vulgarian"),
but they all finally give their
approval to the marriage. But
for Eve, Arthur's marriage
leaves her life in a shambles,
and she commits suicide as

joey tries to save her. And it is
only with this loss that the
three daughters can begin to
find hope, however bleak that
hope may be.
Complexity
I discuss Interiors plotting in
detail in order to demonstrate
the complexity in this work (at
least in comparison to Allen's
other movies), and also to give
a sense of just how different a
subject Interiors is for Allen.
Interiors' characterization is
often forced, too worked out,'
and the individual scenes,
which are essentially confes
sional in nature, sometimes
seem to be just a beat too long,
their timing out of sync, un
natural.
What is surprising is that In
teriors is not more so, espe
cially since this is truly a first
attempt. If Allen tries this form
again, he should forget about
worked out Bergman and
Chekhov references and con
centrate on his own concep
tion.
It works
When Interiors works, and it
often does, brilliantly, the per
formances are usually the
reason why. Even though
Woody claims that all he does
with actors is say "more, more,

muie," he must be doing
something more than that, be
cause it takes solid direction
for this kind of ensemble cast
ing to be a success.
Maybe all Woody does is to
pick the right actors; here he
gives them some strong con
trasts to play against, and they
go at it with real energy. As Eve,
Geraldine Page gives the best
preformance of her movie
career. Page has always been a
superb stage actress, and in In
teriors, she captures the
simplicity and directness that
drive her acting in the theatre.
An actress with great emo
tional range, Page gives Eve
depth as well as dignity.
Marybeth Hurt is brilliant as
joey, a very important charac
ter in Interiors, and one that is
probably the closest to Allen's
own personality. )oey con
stantly doubts herself and
questions her responsibility to
her mother. Many other ac
tresses would let this character
wallow in self-pity, but Hurt
gives Joey some balance in
what is an extraordinarily
naturalistic performance.
Keaton
In the less important role of
Renata, Diane Keaton gets to
show off her diverse talents as
an actress, especially her abil
ity to be tender when you really
don't expect it. Casting Keaton
in less than the major role and
not casting himself at all indi
cate just how hard Allen tried
to be different with Interiors.
And, finally, Maureen
Stapleton, as Pearl, gives a sun
lit performance that provides
the contrast that the film so de
sperately needed. Allen is
gently satiric with Pearl, and
Stapleton's acting perfectly
matches this mood.
But on the whole, Interiors
broods obsessively, and Allen
complements this mood with
very spare, rigid direction.
Gordon Willis' lean color
Khotography serves to
eighten this feeling of rigid
ity.
While Interiors is strongly di
rected and often exhibits in
sight in both writing and per
formance, the movie never
quite finds itself. Like the
characters contained in it, In
teriors is searching for some
thing, but it never quite finds
it.
And, finally, I wonder if it is
this constant search which
drives Woody Allen to the pain
which we have only seen
glimpses of before and which
dominates Interiors, a movie
which, like Allen, appears to
still be searching.
