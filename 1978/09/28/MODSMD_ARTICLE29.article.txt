## 'Girl Friends': seductive fluff 
### 
Cirl Friends, Claudia Weil's
first feature is a light entertain
ing film which suggests prom
ise but fails to deliver. The film
is about a young Jewish photo
grapher (Melanie Mayron) try
ing to make it as an indepen
dent career woman in New
York.
The heroine, Susan
Weinblatt is unceasingly
touching, funny and lovable —
so much so that ultimately she
is simply too wonderful to
stomach. She is too witty, too
talented and too slick to be be
lievable.
Weil seems to be trying
hard to portray a realistic view
of a beginning artist but falls
prey to over-romanticism. Al
though Susan lives in a grungy
empty apartment and cannot
afford to pay her electric bill in
the middle of a cold New York
winter, she takes this so skill
fully in stride and is so amaz
ingly resilient in the face of all
her problems that I would ex
change all wordly wealth in

order to possess such cheery,
artistic poverty.
College appeal
The main theme of Cirl
Friends concerns the difficul
ties facing a beginning artist,
namely that of maintaining her
self-belief and independence
without the recognition of her
professional peers.
The subject matter has an
obvious college appeal since
Susan's situation is not unlike
what many students will face in
a year or two. It is unfortuante,
however, that the film's cute
ness blurs any of the insights
Weil might have intended to
share. The resulting film is
more touching "fluff and
stuff" than profundity.
The beginning of the movie
chronicles Susan's struggles —
one gets the impression that
these last about a month at
which point she is miracul
ously "discovered," gets her
man and even manages to re
tain her feminist indepen
dence in the bargain. Not bad
for starters. If only we could all

be so lucky.
Cirl Friends reminds me of
An Unmarried Woman remade
to appeal to the "younger set."
In both films the heroines are
such superwomen that one
loses any possible indentifica
tion with them or sympathy for
their dilemmas.
In fact, I border on despising
their slick ability to handle
themselves in any trauma. I
have a sadistic desire to see
them bleed. If only Susan
could have suffered a bit more
before all her dreams came
true, she might have been an
interesting character.
Instead, the depth of her
suffering never seems to ex
tend beyond Mayron's sulking
face which is more reminiscent
of a spoiled child than a young
artist suffering a frightening
period of self-doubt.
The amazing facility with
which Susan picked herself up
after her many rejections,
leads one to question the
depth of her sensitivity. Her
over-night success, both pro
fessionally and personally, de
prive us of any of the wisdom
she might have gained had
events gone less splendidly.
Weil seems to suggest that
after of month of "despair,"
Susan has earned the right to a
life of bliss.
Weil's reason for entitling

her film Girl Friends is not en
tirely clear. Susan
does have a sometimes-close,
more often-strained, friend
ship with a would-be writer
Anne, played by Anita Skinner.
(Although the fact that one is
Jewish and the other Gentile is
stressed at every possibility, its
significance in their relation
ship remains a mystery.) The
rapport between them never
seems strong enough to justify
being touted as the major
theme of the film.
Rather, it almost seems as if
Weil includes the more de
pendent, married character,
Anne, to contrast with inde
pendent career-minded Su
san, thereby demonstrating
the intrinsic preferability of in
dependence. Rah! Rah
feminism! A mite simplistic, it
seems.
Whenever the two are com
pared, Susan always comes out
ahead. She flourishes in every
aspect whereas Anne does lit
tle more than vegetate. Unable
to write because of all her fam
ily responsibilities, Anne is re
duced to confiding her
deepest secrets to her baby.
As Andrew Sarris suggests,
the film might more aptly have
been titled "The Girl Who
Needed NoOneandEndedUp
With Everything." A charming
fantasy, but not very illuminat
ing.
