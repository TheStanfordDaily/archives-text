# Prop. 5 could segregate smokers here
## 
### MONIKA GUTTMAN 
Proposition 5: Regulation of Smoking Initiative
Statute. Makes smoking unlawful in certain en
closed areas. Requires signs designating non
smoking areas in public places.
This is one ot the most important measures on
the November ballot in terms of its effect on the
University. Administration and staff agree that if
Proposition 5 is approved by California voters, it
will have a significant impact on some aspects of
the University's operation.
"It would definitely affect the University," said
)ack Sidlow, manager of University Safety and
Health. "It covers all enclosed places and all work
ing areas."
"It'll take a lot of cooperation to deal with it,"
said Susan Kirk, administrative assistant of
Facilities and Properties, "without setting off the
smokers against the non-smokers."
Sidlow, Kirk, Ellen McNiel of Employee Rela
tions and Susan Schofield of the Vice Provost's
office met recently as an ad hoc group to deter
mine what the effects would be.
"Our general conclusion was that Stanford is
includecfin the law," said Schofield, "and if the
law passes, then most of our facilities will become
non-smoking."

Schofield added that the law mainly would affect
the parts of campus that are used as employee
offices.
"The side of the University that the student sees
will not really be affected," she said. "It's more for
Stanford as an employer that the law applies."
The group made only what members called a
"general assessment" of the impact the new law
would have.
"There are 90 days before the law would be
come effective, and in that time we'd have a lot of
work to do," said Schofield.
This would include a survey of thp number of
smokers working in the University and where their
offices are.
"The law is fairly broadly written," said Kirk. "It
mentions smoking is all right in a private office —
but what, exactly, is a private office?"
Sidlow mentioned a few motivational problems
the new law would create.
"Some people smoke now and don't take a
break. Now they'll want to take a break to smoke.
What'll this do to employment?" he said. "It'll
definitely be more than just a matter of putting up
signs and issuing statements.','
According to Schofield, it has been University
policy for many years to prohibit smoking in clas
srooms and laboratories.

"In that regard it's only the enforcement impli
cations which change, since it becomes a state
law," she said.
But in other areas, the University may even have
to build special smoking areas, depending upon
the interpretation of the law.
"In this light, we'd have to build all new smoking
lounges in the Quad," said Kirk, "and that would
be tough."
"But, she added, "it's foolish to get cost esti
mates now if we don't know what the law really
entails. We'll have to be as sensible as possible."
The group said it felt the law would not have
much effect on students in the dorms.
"If a smoker and a non-smoker are put together
in one room, there couldn't be any smoking," said
Schofield. "But to the best of my knowledge the
University housing never puts a smoker in with a
non-smoKer anyway."
Group members said they were uncertain
whether the law will pass.
"There's a possibility it could," Schofield said.
"The polls seem to indicate that it will," added
Kirk. "And an awful lot of people who work here
smoke. We'll have to get a firm handle on what
functions are performed by smokers vs. non
smokers in what types of rooms."
