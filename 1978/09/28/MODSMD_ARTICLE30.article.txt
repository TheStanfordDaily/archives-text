A picture says a thousand words, so we'll just say a few more.
Strange things happen in the midnight sun, and in the Cow
Palace, and at the Hookers' Ball. COYOTE'S annual self benefit
on October 20th from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. is certain to be no
exception to the rule. The theme of the evening is "rubber ball,"
whatever that means — expect a liberal interpretation of both
the "rubber" and the "ball" from most of the dignitaries in
attendance. Expect also a large number of famous faces, glazed
expressions, close encounters and noise. Expect to be there.
Expect to be scarred for life.
