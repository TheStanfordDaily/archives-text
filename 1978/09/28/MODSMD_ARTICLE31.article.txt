## Foreigner's 'Double Vision' disappointing 
### 
Foreigner
Double Vision
Atlantic
When Foreigner's first
album appeared on the shelves
last year, critics hailed it as one
of the year's better releases, a
favorable mixture of Boston,
Kansas and Bad Company. Its'
sprite vocals, competent musi
cianship, and hook-laced
tunes helped hurl the album
on to the year's best sellers list.
It was expected that if
Foreigner's follow-up albums
were anything like the debut,
they would definitely bea band
to be reckoned with.
Unfortunately Double Vis
ion, Foreigner's newest offer
ing, falls far short of the expec
tations set by the first album.
True, the overall production is
slicker, but this positive
characteristic of the album is
overcompensated for by the
album's faults.
Sterile lyrics
First, the album is so sterile,
they'd probably allow it in the
operating room. These guys
must have flunked out of Jac
queline Suzanne's school of
writing. Lyrics such as
You treat me like a fool
But you're so wrong,
I'm gonna send you back
Where you belong.
I put my trust in you
But I was wrong,
I'm gonna send you back

Where you belong.
and
Hot blooded
Check it and see,
Got a fever
Of 103,
Come on baby
Do you do more than dance?
I'm hot hlooded.
adorn the album. They make
sense, but then so do five year
olds, most of whom could
write better stuff than this.
Even ELO's moronic lyrics,
some of the worst, are more
palatable; at least Jeff Lynne
(ELO's writer) admits the lyrics
are empty and that he's just
concerned with the music. But
Foreigner is supposed to be

writing songs. In addition, the
delivery on most of these
songs is on a par with the lyrics.
Sutures anyone?
Music strikes out
Were the music good
enough, perhaps the banality
and sterility which surround
the lyrics and delivery could be
overlooked. It worked with the
first album (though the lyrics
and vocals on that album were,
at times, decent). But it's here
that Foreigner strikes out com
pletely.
"Hot Blooded" — you may
have heard it if you've recently
turned your radio on AM for
more than 20 seconds — is
dull. Bad Comapny, and prac

tically every other "refined"
hard rock group, has done this
kind of stuff before; it usually
winds up on the "B" side of
some obscure single.
"Love has Taken its Toll"
sounds like "Hot Blooded," a
minuscule only a bit more
melodic. The rocker "Double
Vision" is another wet noodle,
saved only by a melodic and
moderately enjoyable chorus.
"Tramontane," the album's
instrumental, sounds like an
out-take from The Alan Parsons
Project; a progressive piece of
musical brilliance, marred by
only two things: it's not very
interesting and it sounds like a
hundred other dull progres

sive works. "I Have Waited So
Long" contains a pleasant sax
solo, but it's so predictable that
the impact is all but lost.
The remainder of the album
varies from fair to poor, with
the exception of two tunes:
"Back Where You Belong," an
intoxicating piece of pop with a
good chorus and "Lonely Chil
dren," which recalls the rock
ing effervescence of the first
album.
If Foreigner expects to retain
its mass following, it had better
produce something better next
time around. Buy the first al
bum. As for "Double Vision,"
it's not worth a second glance.
