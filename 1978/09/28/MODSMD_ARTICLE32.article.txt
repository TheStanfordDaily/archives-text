## Flanagan offers worthy tribute in 'James Joyce's Women' 
### 
James Joyce's Women, a
one-woman tribute to James
Joyce, conceived, written and
acted by Fionnula Flanagan is
an unusual piece of theatre. It
is a woman's love affair with
James Joyce and his writings
that began, says Flanagan,
while she was growing up in
Dublin.
Fionnula Flanagan is an
Emmy award-winning actress
and co-star of ABC-TV's "How

The West Was Won." She has
previously appeared as two
characters from Joyce's Ulys
ses: Gerty MacDowell in
Joseph Stick's film of the novel
and Molly Bloom in the 1974
revival of Burgess Meredith's
adaptation, Ulysses in Night
town with Zero Mostel.
Six Women
Here, Flanagan portrays six
women who have played an
important role in Joyce's life,

three of them from his own im
agination.
Flanagan transforms herself
into Harriet Shaw Weaver, the
editor of the English literary re
view, The Egoist, who helped
Joyce to get started as a writer
by publishing A Portait of An
Artist As A Young Man. Then by
putting on a shawl that she
selects from a basket, she be
comes the Washerwoman
from Joyce's Finnegan's Wake.
The Washerwoman episode
shows Joyce's arrogance and
faith in his own genius. That
genius enabled him to survive
the hardship, poverty and ig
norance he had to fight all his
life in a world of struggling ar
tists who have since become
the century's literary giants.
His struggle is the major theme
of the production.
The Washerwoman episode
contains the names of 250 riv
ers and puns in over 11 lan
guages and is incomprehensi
ble to anyone except the dusty
scholar.
Joyce's wife
Later, Flanagan ages 30 years
to become Joyce's wife Nora,
an uneducated and simple
woman who never read her
husband's works and who

wanted him to become a
singer. But Joyce remained
loyal to her all his life, and she
was the source of many of his
characters.
The second half of the even
ing begins with Flanagan as
Sylvia Beach, the proprietress
of the Paris bookstore Shakes
peare and Co. who undertook
the difficult task of publishing
Joyce's Ulysses. The published
book became Beache's birth
day present for Joyce with
major literary figures such as
Hemingway and Fitzgerald
present. The audience is urged
to sing "Happy birthday dear
Mr. Joyce."
Captivating
The truly captivating part of
the evening comes toward the
end when Flanagan puts on a
straw hat and becomes the red
haired young beauty, Gerty
MacDowell, from Ulysses. The
1920 cou rt case that ban ned the
book in the U.S. centered
around this character. The
young girl fantasizes about a
stranger on a beach who is
watching her intently. She de
scribes her fantasies, which
range from erotic to comical. It
is a wonderful human scene
ending in her ecstasy as she

watches fireworks.
Flanagan is at her best when
she closes the evening with
Molly Bloom, a famous
stream-of-consciousness sol
iloquy from Ulysses.
Privacy
Dressed in a night gown
Molly plops herself onto a
chamberpot and talks about
the monthly difficulties of
womanhood, checking period
ically to see whether some
thing has come out. Satisfied,
Flanagan stands up, and as if
she were completely alone,
takes off her nightgown. She
lies on the huge brass bed and
examines her breasts, in awe of
her sexuality. Flanagan does

this in a way that seems per
fectly natural so her privacy is
not disturbed as she speaks of
her lust for men and the mira
cle of love.
The audience became very
quiet at this point. Some obvi
ously felt a tension, perhaps
the kind that Joyce fought all
his life.
Flanagan's performance is
exceptional. It is not easy to be
six different women of diffe
rent ages and walks of life all in
one evening.
Differences
There are a few problems.
Flanagan's writing cannot
match Joyce's and so differ

ences of quality between
characterizations are evident.
The first half of the evening is a
little lengthy and perhaps the
overall purpose of the play not
clear. But these are minor
problems.
The evening should interest
both James Joyce's scholars
and those of us more ignorant
who get a glimpse of the life of
the century's most important
writers through the sensitive
eyes of Fionulla Flannagan.

view, The Egoist, who helped
Joyce to get started as a writer
by publishing A Portait of An
Artist As A Young Man. Then by
putting on a shawl that she
selects from a basket, she be
comes the Washerwoman
from Joyce's Finnegan's Wake.
The Washerwoman episode
shows Joyce's arrogance and
faith in his own genius. That
genius enabled him to survive
the hardship, poverty and ig
norance he had to fight all his
life in a world of struggling ar
tists who have since become
the century's literary giants.
His struggle is the major theme
of the production.
The Washerwoman episode
contains the names of 250 riv
ers and puns in over 11 lan
guages and is incomprehensi
ble to anyone except the dusty
scholar.
Joyce's wife
Later, Flanagan ages 30 years
to become Joyce's wife Nora,
an uneducated and simple
woman who never read her
husband's works and who

wanted him to become a
singer. But Joyce remained
loyal to her all his life, and she
was the source of many of his
characters.
The second half of the even
ing begins with Flanagan as
Sylvia Beach, the proprietress
of the Paris bookstore Shakes
peare and Co. who undertook
the difficult task of publishing
Joyce's Ulysses. The published
book became Beache's birth
day present for Joyce with
major literary figures such as
Hemingway and Fitzgerald
present. The audience is urged
to sing "Happy birthday dear
Mr. Joyce."
Captivating
The truly captivating part of
the evening comes toward the
end when Flanagan puts on a
straw hat and becomes the red
haired young beauty, Gerty
MacDowell, from Ulysses. The
1920 cou rt case that ban ned the
book in the U.S. centered
around this character. The
young girl fantasizes about a
stranger on a beach who is
watching her intently. She de
scribes her fantasies, which
range from erotic to comical. It
is a wonderful human scene
ending in her ecstasy as she

watches fireworks.
Flanagan is at her best when
she closes the evening with
Molly Bloom, a famous
stream-of-consciousness sol
iloquy from Ulysses.
Privacy
Dressed in a night gown
Molly plops herself onto a
chamberpot and talks about
the monthly difficulties of
womanhood, checking period
ically to see whether some
thing has come out. Satisfied,
Flanagan stands up, and as if
she were completely alone,
takes off her nightgown. She
lies on the huge brass bed and
examines her breasts, in awe of
her sexuality. Flanagan does

this in a way that seems per
fectly natural so her privacy is
not disturbed as she speaks of
her lust for men and the mira
cle of love.
The audience became very
quiet at this point. Some obvi
ously felt a tension, perhaps
the kind that Joyce fought all
his life.
Flanagan's performance is
exceptional. It is not easy to be
six different women of diffe
rent ages and walks of life all in
one evening.
Differences
There are a few problems.
Flanagan's writing cannot
match Joyce's and so differ

ences of quality between
characterizations are evident.
The first half of the evening is a
little lengthy and perhaps the
overall purpose of the play not
clear. But these are minor
problems.
The evening should interest
both James Joyce's scholars
and those of us more ignorant
who get a glimpse of the life of
the century's most important
writers through the sensitive
eyes of Fionulla Flannagan.

Garrett O'Connor is the interviewer to Fionnula Flanagan's portrayal of Nora Barnacle Joyce, the lon]
suffering wife to literary genius lames Joyce, in lames loyce's Women, directed by Burgess Meredith.
James Joyce's Women, a
one-woman tribute to James
Joyce, conceived, written and
acted by Fionnula Flanagan is
an unusual piece of theatre. It
is a woman's love affair with
James Joyce and his writings
that began, says Flanagan,
while she was growing up in
Dublin.
Fionnula Flanagan is an
Emmy award-winning actress
and co-star of ABC-TV's "How

The West Was Won." She has
previously appeared as two
characters from Joyce's Ulys
ses: Gerty MacDowell in
Joseph Stick's film of the novel
and Molly Bloom in the 1974
revival of Burgess Meredith's
adaptation, Ulysses in Night
town with Zero Mostel.
Six Women
Here, Flanagan portrays six
women who have played an
important role in Joyce's life,

three of them from his own im
agination.
Flanagan transforms herself
into Harriet Shaw Weaver, the
editor of the English literary re
view, The Egoist, who helped
Joyce to get started as a writer
by publishing A Portait of An
Artist As A Young Man. Then by
putting on a shawl that she
selects from a basket, she be
comes the Washerwoman
from Joyce's Finnegan's Wake.
