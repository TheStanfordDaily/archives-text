Action threatened in rail strike
Washington — The Carter administration vowed
yesterday to step in and "start the trains running
again" by noon today if the railroads and a striking
union fail to settle the dispute that has crippled
much of the nation's rail system for two days.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall ordered officials
from the striking Brotherhood of Railway and Air
line Clerks (BRAC) and the Norfolk & Western
Railway (N&W) to begin a marathon, 24-hour bar
gaining session with the help of a federal mediator
at the Labor Department.
The parties began meeting at noon, and Mar
shall said he would keep them meetingaround the
clock in an effort to reach a settlement.
Otherwise, Marshall warned yesterday, "We'll
take action at noon tomorrow to start the trains
running again."
The clerks' union, which struck the Virginia
based N&W 80 days ago, escalated the strike to 40
other carriers Tuesday by throwing up picket lines
that were honored by mure than 500,000 railroad
employees.
Third plane not likely in crash
San Diego — The chief investigator of the na
tion's worst air disaster said yesterday that it now
"appears remote" that a third plane played any
part in the collision of a jetliner and a small plane.
The third plane, a twin-engine Cessna, has been
located and was eight miles west of the area where
the Pacific Southwest Airlines Boeing 727 and a
single-engine Cessna 172 collided on approach to
Lindbergh Field Monday morning, said inves
tigator Phillip Hogue.
All 135 persons aboard the PSA jet died, both
persons in the 172 were killed and at least 13 per
sons on the ground died when flaming debris

rained down on a residential neighborhood <000
feet below.
Yesterday's setback in the probe lor what
caused the tragedy returns investigators to the
slow process of scouring tapes and records sur
rounding the collision.
Institute wants Laetrile testing
Washington — The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) wants to test Laetrile on several hundred
advanced cancer patients in an effort to resolve
"once and for all" the debate about the controver
sial substance, the institute's direc tor announced
Wednesday.
Dr. Arthur Upton said a human trial was justified
in the wake of a recent, inconclusive review of the
medical records of patients who used Laetrile,
which some claim is a cancer cure.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which
has led a federal fight against Laetrile, still must
approve the Cane er Institute's plan to use Laetrile
in the human experiment. FDA Commissioner
Donald Kennedy said he did not believe the insti
tutes review of the 22 cases "demonstrates any
effectiveness of Laetrile."
Pope gets laughs from audiences
Vatican City —Within a month after his election,
Pope John Paul I has transformed the normally
sedate papal audiences into informal gatherings,
peppered with his personal anecdotes and broken
up with rip-roaring laughter from his guests.
Yesterday, when the weekly general audience
was divided into two groups because of an over
flow of pilgrims, the 65-year-old pontiff acted as a
master of ceremonies. He called up a sth grade
Rome student from the crowd and interviewed
him in front of the 10,000 persons packing the
Vatican's audience hall.

"Do you always want to be in the sth grade?" the
pope asked Daniele Bravo, lowering the mic
rophone to the boy's height.
"Yes," the youth replied to the laughter of the
crowd, "so that I don't have to change teachers."
"Well, you are different from the pope," the
pontiff remarked. "When I was in 4th grade, I
worried about making it to the sth and when in the
sth, about passing to the 6th."
Anthony dollar gets final OK

the Treasury, the House gave final congressional

The new coin, which will be a little bigger than a
quarter, could be in circulation by mia-1979.

Pope gets laughs from audiences
Vatican City —Within a month after his election,
Pope John Paul I has transformed the normally
sedate papal audiences into informal gatherings,
peppered with his personal anecdotes and broken
up with rip-roaring laughter from his guests.
Yesterday, when the weekly general audience
was divided into two groups because of an over
flow of pilgrims, the 65-year-old pontiff acted as a
master of ceremonies. He called up a sth grade
Rome student from the crowd and interviewed
him in front of the 10,000 persons packing the
Vatican's audience hall.

"Do you always want to be in the sth grade?" the
pope asked Daniele Bravo, lowering the mic
rophone to the boy's height.
"Yes," the youth replied to the laughter of the
crowd, "so that I don't have to change teachers."
"Well, you are different from the pope," the
pontiff remarked. "When I was in 4th grade, I
worried about making it to the sth and when in the
sth, about passing to the 6th."

Action threatened in rail strike
Washington — The Carter administration vowed
yesterday to step in and "start the trains running
again" by noon today if the railroads and a striking
union fail to settle the dispute that has crippled
much of the nation's rail system for two days.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall ordered officials
from the striking Brotherhood of Railway and Air
line Clerks (BRAC) and the Norfolk & Western
Railway (N&W) to begin a marathon, 24-hour bar
gaining session with the help of a federal mediator
at the Labor Department.
The parties began meeting at noon, and Mar
shall said he would keep them meetingaround the
clock in an effort to reach a settlement.
Otherwise, Marshall warned yesterday, "We'll
take action at noon tomorrow to start the trains
running again."
The clerks' union, which struck the Virginia
based N&W 80 days ago, escalated the strike to 40
other carriers Tuesday by throwing up picket lines
that were honored by mure than 500,000 railroad
employees.
Third plane not likely in crash
San Diego — The chief investigator of the na
tion's worst air disaster said yesterday that it now
"appears remote" that a third plane played any
part in the collision of a jetliner and a small plane.
The third plane, a twin-engine Cessna, has been
located and was eight miles west of the area where
the Pacific Southwest Airlines Boeing 727 and a
single-engine Cessna 172 collided on approach to
Lindbergh Field Monday morning, said inves
tigator Phillip Hogue.
All 135 persons aboard the PSA jet died, both
persons in the 172 were killed and at least 13 per
sons on the ground died when flaming debris

rained down on a residential neighborhood <000
feet below.
Yesterday's setback in the probe lor what
caused the tragedy returns investigators to the
slow process of scouring tapes and records sur
rounding the collision.
Institute wants Laetrile testing
Washington — The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) wants to test Laetrile on several hundred
advanced cancer patients in an effort to resolve
"once and for all" the debate about the controver
sial substance, the institute's direc tor announced
Wednesday.
Dr. Arthur Upton said a human trial was justified
in the wake of a recent, inconclusive review of the
medical records of patients who used Laetrile,
which some claim is a cancer cure.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which
has led a federal fight against Laetrile, still must
approve the Cane er Institute's plan to use Laetrile
in the human experiment. FDA Commissioner
Donald Kennedy said he did not believe the insti
tutes review of the 22 cases "demonstrates any
effectiveness of Laetrile."
