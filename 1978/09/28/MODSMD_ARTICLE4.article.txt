# Israeli parliament approves Camp David peace accords
## 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — The Israeli parli
ament opened the way to a peace
treaty with Egypt by voting over
whelmingly early today to endorse
the Camp David Mideast accords and
remove the Jewish settlements in the
Sinai Peninsula.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
whose speech closed out more than
17 hours of debate, said before the
vote: "I call on this chamber, without
any difference in party, to unite. I
don't deny that there are dangers. I
don't deny it's painful. Let us ac
cept."
The vote was 84 in favor and 19
against, with 17 abstentions. Many
"no" votes and abstentions came
from Begin's ruling Likud coalition,
whose right-wing nationalists firmly
opposed disbanding the Sinai set
tlements.
In Washington, President Carter,
who brought Begin and Egyptian

President Anwar Sadat together to
work out the accords at a two-week
summit at Camp David, described
the vote as "a great step forward."
He said it was "indeed good news
and it's sure proof of the tremendous
courage of Prime Minister Begin and
the Israeli Knesset."
End to rule
The vote cleared the way for a new
round of peace talks leading to a tre
aty with Egypt within three months
and an eventual end to Israel's 11-
year military rule of the West Bank of
the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip.
Begin, the last speaker in the de
bate, began his appeal to the Knesset
at 2:15 a.m. local time — 8:15 p.m.
EDT — more than 16 hours after the
debate began.
"Twelve days and 12 nights we
didn't cease explaining to tne U.S.
president and his aides the necessity
of these settlements," Begin said. He
said Carter and Sadat could not ac
cept the Israeli position, and "if
Camp David would have exploded in
this way, Israel would not have stood
it. . . . All the democratic countries
would have called us an obstacle to
peace."
Surrender
Had Camp David failed, he said,
"just because of the settlements, Is
rael would not have stood, and then
one day Israel really would have had
to sign a surrender."
"If Egypt gets out of the cycle of
war, Syria can't attack because they'll
know it's suicide," Begin said. "Jor
dan can't attack because the Hashe
mite king Hussein will lose his
crown. This may bring peace for five
years, for 10 years, for 50 years. This
is a historic moment."
Begin said without Knesset ap
proval "everything we achieved ai
Camp David will be null and void.
"I will say to the Knesset and to the
people, this is the first practical

chance for peace," Begin said. "This
peace we achieved is first of all from
our blood. We sacrificed 12,000 of
our best sons. We want to put a stop
to this. This is the opportunity. This is
the time. This is the chance."
New era
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman
said Israel was entering "a new era
with Egypt that is difficult for some of
us to imagine . . . peaceful relations
between us and the largest Arab
state."
However, there is still a significant
disagreement between Carter and
Begin on the issue of Israeli settle
ments on the West Bank of the Jor
dan River.
Carter was described by the
Washington Post as saying tne Is
raelis agreed to an effective five-year
West Bank moratorium in return for
the dropping of a demand that exist
ing settlements not be expanded.
Carter confirmed that he was the ar
chitect of that compromise and
termed it a "good tradeoff."
"My belief is that Begin did agree
not to start any new settlements dur
ing the time the negotiations on the
West Bank-Gaza Strip self
government were being conducted,
and that the status of tne future set
tlements would be determined by
the negotiations."
However, Begin has steadfastly
maintained he agreed to a
moratorium on new settlements for
only the three-month period of di
rect Israeii-Egyptian negotiations
over a separate peace treaty.
Carter warned that there would be
"very serious" problems if Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin in
sists that the moratorium on Israeli
settlements on the West Bank last
only three months.
Carter's warning was his first pub
lic statement on the disparity bet
ween the American and Israeli posi
tions.
