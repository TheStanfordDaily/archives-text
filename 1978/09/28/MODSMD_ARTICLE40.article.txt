The ASSU Council of Presidents

lected more than enough signatures

An enterprising student
In case you didn't realize it, stu
dents here are smart. During a final
exam some time ago, a chemistry

protessor warned his 400 students
that tie would accept no late blue
books. One student attempted to
turn in his test 10 minutes late. The
professor refused it, and the student
pleaded to no avail. Finally the stu
dent asked, "Do you know who I
am?" When the professor admitted
he didn't the student quickly stuck
his blue book in the huge pile of
exams and ran out the door.
