# Booze, bottles, cans banned from stadium
## 
### JILL LISCOM 
Both students and alumni have
criticized the new rule against bring
ing alcohol, cans, bottles and con
tainers larger than one quart into the
football stadium. However, Asst.
Athletic Director Ray Young claims
there are good reasons for the rule.
Referring to the alcohol ban,
Young said, "All teams in the Pac-10
have these same rules. With other
college parks, most of them now
have gone to no alcoholic beverages,
too."
Young said he thinks the student
criticism of the rules is "overreac
tion, as if this is prohibition on every
thing."
"We do have problems with the
drunks," he said. "The students tend
to think they're the only ones the
rules are directed at, ana that's not
true." With a crowd of 70,000, the
student section s only a minority, and
"we're directing the rule at the
majority," he said.
Alternative
Containers brought into the
stadium now will be limited to one
quart vacuum containers. That ex
ception was made because "we're
trying to allow an alternative" to br
inging in larger containers such as
beer kegs and ice chests, Young said.

Young said cans and bottles are
banned not because people throw
them, but because "people drop
them wherever they use them,"
causing a safety hazard, especially if
the bottles break when they hit the
ground or the stadium steps.
"At one game we had two inci
dents when two spectators slipped
on dropped bottles" and had to be
taken to the hospital to be treated for
severe cuts, said Young.
Young said the problem of people
throwing things in the stadium has
been "minimal" in the past, although
there were several incidents at tne
San lose State game, including an in
cident when "a can full of mustard
was thrown into the reserved sec
tion."
Young said the decision to enforce
the new ban was made last spring,
although it was not announced be
fore school ended in June. The new
rules were included in ticket applica
tions and news releases were sent to
local newspapers.
Soft drinks in cans will continue to
be sold inside the stadium for the
remainder of the season due to a
previous contract which does not
expire until |an. 1, but Young said a
new contract fordrinks in papercups
will be arranged next year.
