# Victory for Carter
## Senate lifts controls on natural gas prices 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Senate
handed President Jimmy Carter the
first major victory on his energy
program in more than a year yester
day, approving 57-42 a compromise
bill to lift federal price controls from
natural gas by 1985.
The legislation, which the White
House has depicted as the most im
portant remaining part of the energy
plan, now goes to the House. A battle
also is expected there, but suppor
ters of the measure appear to have
the upper hand.
House leaders hope to combine
the gas-pricing bill with a number of
other, less controversial parts of Car
ter's energy plan and pass the entire
package just before the scheduled
mid-October congressional ad
journment.
Carter expressed optimism the
House would go along with the mea
sure. "I think it proves to our own
nation and the rest of the world that
we, in this government, particularly
Congress, can courageously deal
with an issue, and one that tests our
national will and ability," he said.
George Lawrence, president of the
American Gas Association, said the
Senate vote "is one more important
step toward adopting a national
energy policy which will provide U.S.

consumers with sufficient supplies
of gas energy."
But James Flug, director of Energy
Action Educational Foundation, said
in a statement, "If this monstrosity
ever becomes law it will be a disas
ter."
Carter asked Congress in April
1977 to join him in declaring "the
moral equivalent of war" on the
energy crisis by approving a package
designed to conserve scarce fuels by
making them more expensive and
taxing their inefficient use.
The House passed most of what
Carter requested in August 1977. But
until Wednesday's vote, that was the
last congressional victory the Carter
program enjoyed as the Senate
began systematically dismantling the
plan's major provisions.
Senate passage of the gas-pricing
bill followed an intensive White
House lobbying effort. Administra
tion officials portrayed the plan as
crucial to U.S. energy policy and sta
bility of the dollar.
Supporters said the measure
would allow enough new gas to be
found to reduce oil imports by about
1.5 million barrels a day by 1985 —
going a long way to meeting the re
duction of two million barrels a day
Carter vowed at last)uly's economic
summit in Bonn.
However, opponents of the com
promise— a coalition of liberals who
called it too costly for consumers and
conservatives who complained it
doesn't deregulate quickly enough
— claimed the measure would not
have any appreciable effects on
either gas production or oil imports.
Congressional economists esti
mate the proposal will cost consum
ers who heat with gas about $16 bill
ion in higher gas bills through 1985.
Supporters claim the measure will

add about $25 a year to the average
family's heating bill. I iberal oppo
nents argue that the additional cost
will be $100 or more a year.
The vote came on the anniversary
of the first all-night Senate session in
more than a decade — during a
filibuster on an earlier version of the
same piece ot legislation that passed
today.
Foes of the measure conceded in
advance of today's vote that they
would lose. They blamed it on the
administration's all-out lobbying ef
forts.
