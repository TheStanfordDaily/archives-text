# Picture-filled Life magazine now monthly

### 
New York (AP) — A reincar
nated Life magazine goes on
sale this week with the same
logo, the same glossy, over
sized pages and the same
attention-grabbing pictures
that fascinated a generation of
readers.
But it "will not be the Life
that people remember," says
Ralph Craves, managing editor
of the earlier magazine and
now a corporate editor.
Managing editor Philip
Kunhardt says the main thing
that remains from the old days
is "the ability to surprise read
ers with pictures."
The price is now $1.50, mak
ing Life no longer the "biggest
and best package of pictures
for a dime," as creator Henry
Luce boasted when it first ap
peared at news stands on Nov.
23, 1936.
Editors say the magazine,
which ceased publication six
years ago after 1864 weekly is
sues, will still have what Luce
called "picture-magic: to as
tonish, to teach, to delight, to
touch."
The October issue features
ballooning, family reunions,
the Shah of Iran, Antarcticaand
fashion designer Halston.
There are pictures of Jackie
Kennedy Onassis, snapped by
Alfred Eisenstaedt, now 79 and
one of four original Life photo
graphers.
The magazine will be
monthly this time instead of
weekly.
The first issue has a press run
of 700,000 — compared to a 5.6
million circulation in 1972. And
56 of its 140 pages are filled
with advertising, for a total
$848,000 revenue. That's a re
cord for any first issue of a
magazine.
