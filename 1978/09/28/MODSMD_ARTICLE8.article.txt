The fate of the Sacramento house Le
land Stanford once lived in has been set
tled for the time being. The historic build
ing, whose purchase was approved July 14
by the state Public Works Board, is tenta
tively planned for restoration and trans
formation into a tourist attraction "similar
to the Governor's Mansion," said a
spokesman from the state Parks and Re
creation Department.
Exhibits of California history may be fea
tured, a spokesman said, possibly includ
ing a special display on "the life and times
of Leland Stanford." However, he said that
the department probably would not take
possession of the land until next July.
Stanford owned the house from 1861 —
the year he was elected governor — until
1874 when he built a mansion on San Fran
cisco's Nob Hill, according to asst. Univer
sity archivist Roxanne Nilan. Besides serv

ing a two-year term as governor during this
period, Stanford was deeply involved with
the planning and construction of the first
transcontinental railroad. Stanford was
the president of the Central Pacific Rail
road, which was founded in 1861. His rail
road met the Union Pacific Railroad at
Promontory Point in 1869. Stanford him
self drove in the "Golden Spike" which
marked the completion of the rail cor
ridor.
According to a San Jose Mercury article,
Stanford and three other prominent
businessmen, Charles Crocker, Collis
Huntington and Mark Hopkins met fre
quently in the house to plan the railroad.
However, Nilan said the bulk of the plan
ning took place in the nearby store owned
by Huntington and Hopkins.
The house was kept in the Stanford fam
ily until 1900, when widow )ane Stanford

gave it to the Church to use as an orphan
age or "home for wayward girls," Nilan
said. The present owner of the house, the
Catholic Diocese of Sacramento agreed to
the sale because of the high cost of
maintenance. '
Nilan described the house as interesting
from an architectural point of view. She
said it was "one of the few left from that
period in Sacramento." "The interior is in
reasonably good shape" and features
widespread use of railroad motifs, she ad
ded.
The house was worth only $510,000 a few
years ago, according to the San Jose Mer
cury. Nilan attributed the recent purchase
price of $1.3 million to the mounting "in
terest in Victorian artifacts."
The four-story Victorian house has 44
rooms and is located on nearly an acre of
land two blocks from the Capitol.


This Sacramento landmark, Leland Stanford's home from 1861 to 1874, has been tentatively approved for reconstruction by the state
Public Works Board.
