# $54.6 million last year
## University donations 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
Stanford received gifts and
donations totaling $54.6 mill
ion during the fiscal year end
ing Aug. 31, President Richard
Lyman reported at the Sep
tember meeting of the Board of
Trustees.
According to Abbie von
Schlegell, associate director of
development, these gifts come
from a number of sources.
One-quarter of the alumni give
annual donations. Last year
these gifts amounted to $5.5
million. They are solicited by
phone, letters and personal
solicitation.
Major gifts of $25,000 or
more are solicited from both
individuals and corporations.
More often than not, these
gifts are given for a restricted
purpose, according to von
Schlegell.
"If an alumnus went through
school on scholarship, he may
donate a major gift for the pur
pose of scholarship. Likewise,
a patient who has had his life
saved at Stanford Hospital may
donate a major gift to be used
within the hospital only."
She added that because of
these contraints the unre
stricted annual gifts can be of
greater use. The average an
nual gift is about $191.
Last spring the Student De
velopment office began the
Senior Pledge Program, ac
cording to program spokes
man Wendy Bennett.
Students involved in the
program asked seniors to give
pledges to the University. This
program was quite effective
within the dorms, when one
resident appealed to another.
However, off-campus stu
dents were more difficult to
approach, Bennett said — they

received letters in the mail. In
cluding a special solicitation of
engineering students, the
senior students who gave
pledged amounted to 18 per
cent of the class of 1978.
"Our goal," explained Ben
nett, "is to raise people's con
sciousness. We need to edu
cate people about the needs of
the University and everybody
can help out with time or
money."
Bennett said that although
tuition seems like a lot of
money, it covers only about 50
percent of the cost of a Stan
ford education, and the other
half must come from dona
tions. Although graduating
students may not be able to af
ford to give a large gift, Bennett
said, "If they can donate a dol
lar, we want to accept that dol
lar."
In another fund-raising
program, the Heritage Fund,
students go to small local com
panies to ask for donations.
Bennett said in the Heritage
Fund program, "not only ao
the students give to the Uni
versity, but they gain business
experience and the knowledge
of how fund raising works."
Von Schlegell said that there
are a number of reasons why
people donate gifts to Stan
ford. Appreciative alumni,
civic minded community
members and grateful parents
are among those who contri
bute to the gift fund.
Denying the notion that
those who give heavily may be
rewarded with student admis
sion, von Schlegell said,
"When donors ask about ad
missions of children, they are
frankly told that their gift
doesn't make any difference."
