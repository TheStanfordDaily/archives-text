# Stanford bids for NASA site
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Saff write 
Stanford is competing with
hundreds of other research insti
tutions for a NASA contract
which, if granted, would estab
lish a space engineering research
center on campus. If selected,
Stanford would become one of
eight private sector research
centers that NASA plans to es
tablish next year, according to
Elliott Levinthal, professor of
mechanical engineering at Stan
ford.
The center, which would
receive $500,000 its first year and
as much as $2,000,000 in future
years, would not involve the con
struction of a new building, but
rather would utilize existing
facilities, Levinthal said.
Levinthal, who also serves as
director of the Stanford Institute
for Manufacturing and Automa
tion, said that NASA officials ex
pect about 500 proposals for the
centers to come in from institu
tions all over the country.
The proposals, which are due
Nov. 6, are expected to cover a
wide variety of space research
areas, Levinthal said.
To get a better understanding
of what NASA was looking for
before submitting Stanford's bid.
Levinthal and other interested
scientists in the space engineer
ing field watched an hour-long
videotape at the NASA Ames
Research Center in Mountain
View .
Levinthal noted that since
Stanford does such a wide vari
ety of space research, there
might be more than one proposal
coming from the University.
He declined to speculate on
the specifics of these proposals,
or about who might be preparing
them.
