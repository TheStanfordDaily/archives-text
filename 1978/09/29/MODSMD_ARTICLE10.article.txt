Schroeder declines to run in 1988
DENVER — Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado tearfully
bowed out of the 1988 presidential race yesterday, telling
stunned hometown supporters that her late start dashed all hope
of capturing the Democratic nomination.
"1 cannot run a campaign that would let you down," she told
a noon rally in Denver's Civic Park, her family flanking her
beneath an arch of blue and yellow balloons in a sun-washed
amphitheater.
Schroeder, 47, did not immediately endorse any of the party's
six remaining contenders and ruled out the possibility of becom
ing a candidate for vice-president with a characteristically quick
comeback: "Are you kidding?"
Her decision came after a four-month exploratory campaign
that failed to raise even half of the $2 million goal she had set,
despite an early pledge of $350,000 from the National Organiza
tion for Women.
Nevertheless, the eight-term congresswoman appeared to be
warmly received and widely respected as she stumped across
the country promising voters "a rendezvous with reality."
Even before her exploratory campaign, she found her way
into the headlines with quotable quips; she is the one who
coined the term "Teflon presidency" to describe the Reagan ad
ministration.
B-l bomber crashes in Colorado
A U.S. Air Force B-l bomber on a simulated bombing raid
crashed onto a Colorado mesa yesterday, killing three crew
members, seconds after several birds were sucked into the
engines and one engine burst into flames, according to Pentagon
officials.
Three members of the six-man crew parachuted out of the dis
abled bomber and were rescued by a local police officer,
Colorado police officials said.
Seconds before the gray-green jet plunged to the ground, a
crew member radioed a distress call that the aircraft had
"multiple bird strikes," and said the plane had "lost engines
three and four, with an engine on fire," according to a Pentagon
spokesman. "We're going down," was the final transmission,
officials said.
"There are no recognizable remains of the plane," Virgil
Cochran, a reporter for the Lamar Daily News who flew over
the crash site, told The Associated Press. "All we could see was
a black spot on the ground and a hole in the ground."
It was the first crash of an operational B-l, the Air Force's
newest long-range bomber which has been plagued by problems
with its sensitive terrain-following radar, flight controls and
electronic countermeasures systems. Officials said there is no
evidence that any of those problems contributed to yesterday's
crash.
Each of the bombers cost about $283 million.
Bush affirms support of Solidarity
WARSAW, Poland —Vice President George Bush spoke on
Polish national television here yesterday, invoking the name of
Solidarity and suggesting to Poles that progress for their country
lies in the direction of "respect for human rights" and the "right
to form independent and self-governing organizations."
As his Polish television hosts pointec c .<> was the first time
an American vice president had spoken on the state-controlled
news broadcast, and Bush was careful in his remarks to give
equal time to his meetings with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski and other Polish officials. Nevertheless, his reference
to Lech Walesa marked one of the rare mentions of the
Solidarity leader's name on national television.
It was in Walesa's company that Bush began his day here,
visiting an important Solidarity shrine, the churchyard grave of
Father Jerzy Popieluszko, the Roman Catholic priest who was
slain in 1984 by Polish secret police.
Walesa joined Bush in laying a wreath on the grave as about
3,000 spectators lined the streets around the church in a residen
tial section of Warsaw, chanting Solidarity slogans and waving
American flags.
Peres says Mideast talks imminent
LOS ANGELES — Israel and its neighbors "are very close"
to convening Middle East peace talks under the auspices of the
United Nations "and yet terribly short of time," Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres said yesterday.
The resolve of Both the United States and Israel to pursue
Mideast peace is likely to be diverted by their 1988 elections, he
warned.
In a Los Angeles news conference and a speech to the World
Affairs Council of Los Angeles, Peres repeated a theme that he
has invoked for months: Successful arms negotiations between
the United States and the Soviet Union, combined with the
cooperative attitude of Egypt and Jordan, have set the stage for
an international Middle East peace conference, to be called by
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council —
Britain, France, China, the United States and the Soviet Union.
"There are so many factors moving in the direction of
peace," said Peres, who is scheduled to fly to New York to ad
di ess the U.N. General Assembly today. "I know today we are
as close to meaningful negotiations as ever before.'. 1
However, he added, "if nothing shall happen in the next three
or four months, we shall face a long interruption .... If we
should miss the boat this time, God knows when we will get an
other opportunity."
U.S. warship reports mines in Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain — U.S. warships warned commercial
vessels away from a major Persian Gulf shipping route yester
day after the U.S. destroyer Kidd reported sighting several
mines off the coast of Dubai at the southern end of the water
way.
It was the first time that mines have have been sighted so far
south in the gulf and their appearance clearly posed a new chal
lenge to the Reagan administration's avowed aim of safeguard
ing freedom of navigation through the vital waterway, diplomats
said.
Gulf-based shipping sources said the mines were sighted Sun
day about 20 miles north of Dubai in a deep-water channel used
by nearly all oil-laden supertankers leaving the gulf. They added
that the mines were anchored to the seabed, suspended beneath
the surface at a depth where a deep-draft tanker might strike
them.
"Clearly, they were meant to be hit by a tanker. They were
not meant merely as a warning," one gulf-based shipping source
said.
There were conflicting reports, however, about the number of
mines involved and the progress of the U.S. Navy's efforts to
locate and dispose of them.
The shipping sources snid that up to six mines had been
sighted and that U.S. warships had fished three of them out of
the water by late yesterday.
