# Hearing postponed in drug-testing case
## 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
A hearing scheduled for
today to determine whether a
preliminary injunction should
be imposed against the
NCAA's drug-testing program
has been delayed for two
weeks at the consent of
lawyers on buth sides.
The hearing is now set for 9
a.m. Oct. 13. Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Conrad Rushing will hear ar
guments that student athletes
be allowed to compete in inter
collegiate athletics without un
dergoing tests for drug use.
Attorneys for the NCAA as
well as those for two Stanford
athletes seeking a preliminary
injunction against the NCAA's
drug-testing program appar
ently had scheduling conflicts
that required the date to be
changed, according to football
player Barry McKeever, one
of the athletes involved with
the suit.
McKeever, soccer player
Jennifer Hill and the Univer
sity are challenging the drug
testing rule in a joint suit
against the NCAA.
The attorneys were un
available for comment last
night.

Because of a temporary
restraining order issued by
Rushing on Aug. 26. Stanford
students are exempted from
the NCAA rule requiring that
collegiate athletes sign a drug
testing consent form before
being allowed to compete.
The restraining order will
remain in effect at least until
the Oct. 13 hearing.
The order was issued in
response to the suit brought
against the NCAA by Hill and
McKeever. The suit, which is
being handled by the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, was
joined by the University on
July 21.
The current suit against the
NCAA grew out of a similar
case initiated late last year by
former Stanford diver Simone
LeVant, who argued that the
NCAA drug-testing program
was degrading and was an in
vasion of her right to privacy
under the California Constitu
tion. LeVant won an injunc
tion allowing her to compete
throughout the course of the
trial, but graduated in June
before the trial's completion.
Hill had joined the suit in
February in order to see that it
was carried through, and
McKeever became an addi
tional plaintiff in July.
