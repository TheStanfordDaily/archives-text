# Kitchen fire damages frat house
## 
### James Mokhiber 
Damages from a Saturday afternoon
kitchen fire at the Kappa Sigma fraternity
house may total between $3,500 and $4,(XK),
University Fire Marshal Raymond Gamma
estimated yesterday.
The fire was apparently caused by a Pop
Tart jammed inside a toaster. Gamma said.
The flames were quickly controlled by two
residents who were present.
Portions of the walls and ceiling, as well as
some furniture in the University-owned
residence will have to be replaced, Gamma
reported.
Sophomore Byron Burson discovered the
flames and was able to control the fire with

two portable extinguishers, while another
resident, Daniel Young, called fire authorities
to the scene.
Gamma said detection of the fire may have
been hindered by the absence of most resi
dents, who were attending the Stanford foot
ball game.
Automatic fire detectors did not sound un
til smoke escaped from the dining hall and en
tered the residence section of the house.
Gamma noted that such systems would give
false alarms too often if installed in cooking
areas. He added that it was the actions of
Burson and Young that prevented a serious
blaze.
University fire insurance will cover the

damages, which include repainting the dining
area and repairing the adjacent wall and over
head beams. Kappa Sigma president Rich
Kushel said he expected the repairs to be
completed "within a week' and noted that
no fraternity member was negligent.
Fraternity member Burson was unaware
anyone had been preparing food in the dining
area and only discovered the problem when
he entered the room and found it already
filled with smoke. After attempting to put out
the fire with an extinguisher, he woke Young,
who called the fire department. With the aid
of a second extinguisher, the two residents
succeeded in dousing the flames before the
fire truck's arrival.
