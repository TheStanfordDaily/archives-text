## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper A 						clear alcohol policy 
### 
Ten Stanford students were arrested at Satur
day's football game for entering the stadium with
alcohol, an incident that ought to worry every
one who cares about Stanford's approach to al
cohol use.
True, the students in question were under 21.
But their arrest marked the first time in several
years that police systematically checked IDs at
the stadium gates.
If Saturday's arrests signal a new policy which
calls for the police to look over the shoulder of
every student who takes a drink, then the Uni
versity is taking a big step backward.
Instead of treating students as adults, such ac
tions presume them all to be irresponsible. In ad
dition, cracking down with a heavy hand snuffs
out all chance for teaching responsibility about
drinking. It may even make alcohol more allur
ing.
Traditionally, the University has taken an ed
ucational approach to alcohol use. In his speech
to the freshmen Sept. 25, President Kennedy
called the University a proper environment for
learning to handle alcohol responsibly but gave a
stern warning against binge drinking.

Similarly, in a recent report examining the al
cohol use at Stanford, Assistant to the Provost
Michael Jackson suggested that the University
can best educate by tolerating social drinking but
disciplining drunken behavior that infringes on
the rights of others.
Saturday's arrests must make everyone
wonder what Stanford's real alcohol policy is.
Will Stanford police be at every function where
alcohol might be consumed by freshmen or
sophomores? Last spring, police entered a few
fraternity parties to check IDs, but by no means
did they visit all parties.
As it is obviously not feasible to card every
student at every party or sporting event on
campus, any sort of crackdown must necessarily
be sporadic or even random.
Obnoxious drunken behavior has no place at
Stanford. But the University needs to decide
whether it wants to play a positive and educa
tional role concerning alcohol use or a negative,
coercive one. Above all, students have a right to
know what to expect. It's time for the University
to put forward a clear and consistent alcohol
policy.
