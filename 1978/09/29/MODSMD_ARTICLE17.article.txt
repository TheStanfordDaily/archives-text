## The 						changing of the Card 
### 
I don't like the name Cardinal,
and I think it should be changed.
It is an abstract noun without his
tory or meaning for Stanford.
Even the most peppy of Stanford
fans are probably not very at
tached to it.

Worse, it's a pale imitation of
Harvard, whose sports teams are
also named after a shade of red.
Now, Harvard is a fine school
and all that, but when it comes to
athletics, most of its teams would
get blown out by Stanford's. It's
kind of unseemly for us to be
copying their nickname.
Besides, cardinal is not even as
good a shade of red as Harvard's
crimson. Crimson is the color of
blood, which is pretty poetic
(though I don't really associate
spilt blood with Harvard athle
tics), while cardinal is the color
of certain male birds and officials
of the Catholic church.
The bird thing is bothersome
since it causes constant confu
sion over plurals. For those who

are picky, it should be, "Lo, two
members of the Cardinal," not
"Lo, two Cardinals." But Cardi
nal is a fine name compared to
the abbreviation sportswriters
use: the Card. A card is a flat,
stiff, rectangular piece of some
thing or other. It just doesn't sing
to me.
If the name Cardinal seems
like it was picked out by a com
mittee with other things on its
mind, it was. The change was a
response to a student movement
(in the golden age of student
movements) to eliminate the old
nickname of the Indians. No, I
don't think we should change
back to the Indians. The Fighting
Irish notwithstanding, it just
doesn't seem right to name a
team after an ethnic group.
When you think about it, it's
pretty amazing that Washing
ton's football team is named the
Redskins. Suppose you were a
Native American and someone
said to you, "Excuse me,
redskin, what time is it?" Would
you find it offensive? Would the
term be less offensive if it were
broadcast into millions of homes
on Monday Night Football?
But I digress. The replacement

that the students came up with
for Stanford was the Robber
Barons. This seems like a great
name to me, but the trustees
thought it was disrespectful to
the founders. I think they should
reconsider. The Progressive Era
has been over for a long time.
Robber Baron has long since
ceased to be a potent political in
sult and has become a historical
curiosity. The fact that I like the
name Robber Barons doesn't
mean that I have anything against
Leland Stanford Sr. The good he
did in helping to keep California
in the Union, founding this uni
versity, and adding to the
prosperity of this country seems
to me to far outweigh the slightly
shady means he used to raise
capital for the Central Pacific
Railroad. If I thought he would
be hurt by the name, I wouldn't
use it because I don't think he is
one of the villains of history.
But Leland Stanford is dead. It
doesn't matter to him anymore.
We could call ourselves the Stan
ford Shoplifters for all he cares.
So what's so good about the
name? First, it shows a self
effacing sense of humor. There is
a not entirely unjustified feeling

in the area that Stanford students
think that the world revolves
around them. Maybe poking a
little fun at ourselves would help
undo the damage that all those
"We got in" buttons have done.
Second, Robber Barons has a
sense of history to it. Sure, we
could solve the blandness prob
lem by calling ourselves the
"Violent People with Very Large
Swords," or something like that,
but it wouldn't have anything to
do with Stanford. Stanford is not
just a market where buyers come
for incredibly expensive educa
tional services, it is also a com
munity with a history. Cardinal is
not a bad school color, but every
school has a school color.
How many schools turn their
maps upside down so that you
look at the University from the
perspective of the railroad sta
tion?
None of this is to take away
from the athletes themselves.
They work long hours, achieve
incredible results and are under
appreciated. They deserve better
than the Card.
