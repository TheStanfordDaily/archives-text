## Bug Me is back! He's bristling over a Bangle and a Barrymore 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
The Bug is back! After a
glorious summer attempting to
divorce sockeye salmon from
the frozen waters of Alaska,
the Bug has returned to answer
those tricky questions that
have been burning on your va
cant brain during the summer.

Many thanks to KathrynVer
Ploeg for her job as the Bug last
volume. But, as in the Miss
America Pageant, once your
year is over the fame is fleeting.
Unless, of course, you pose
nude. Stay tuned for the Pent
house Bug-of-the-Month.
Kathryn?
For those of you new to
Stanford or to reading, Bug Me
is your column to get those

answers to the little questions
that have been, well, bugging
you.
Want to know how much
they mark up the shampoo at
the Store?
Write to the Bug.
Curious about how to build a
thermonuclear device for under
fifty dollars? Write to the
Bug.
Need the answers to tomor
row's Western Culture final?
Write to the Bug.
Really, there are absolutely
no limits to what you can ask.
Traditionally, questions to the
Bug have focused largely on
Stanford, Palo Alto and the sur
rounding areas, but please
don't limit your inquiring minds
to such narrow venues. The
Bug is ready and willing to an
swer your questions on sci
ence, etiquette, sex, cooking,
consumer safety or anything
else that pops inexplicably into
your heads during a poli sci
lecture.
Questions sent to Bug Me in
the past have ranged from the
idiotic (What is the maximum
velocity attainable by the com
mon housefly?) to the just
downright stupid (What is the
name of Dudley Do-Right's
horse?).
Why, you ask, does the Bug
go to such Herculean efforts to

answer your poignant ques
tions in a lively — yet timely —
manner? Because the Bug can t
get a date with Susanna Hoffs
of the Bangles. That's why.
And if the Bug can't have a
Bangle, what else is there to do
with life?
Also, you may ask, why does
the Bug refer to himself in the
third person, taking the consid
erable risk of being mistaken
for Miss Manners? Because if
the Bug referred to himself in
the second person he would be
labeled schizophrenic and
hauled off to the Abnormal
Psychology Department.
YOU'VE gotta send in the
questions. Every question in
this column comes from a real
person; they are not made up.
Without the questions, there
can be no answers. So send
your questions to:
Bug Me
Stanford Daily
Storke Building
Stanford, CA 94305
Or bring your questions to
the Daily in person. Or, even
better, send your questions via
the LOTS computer system to
Bug-Me. Not B.Bug-Meor Bug
Me. Sending e-mail to Bug-Me
is a great way to break the
