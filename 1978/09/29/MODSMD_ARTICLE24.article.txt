# Roving reporter rambles through registration

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
When I awoke yesterday morning 1
knew something big was going on, but I
wasn't sure what it was. I found the an
swer quickly as I rode my bicycle down
Mayfield Avenue and into White Plaza.
Just as I passed by the new speaker's
rostrum I came to a screeching halt to
avoid crashing into the wall of people
that suddenly appeared in front of me. It
would later become clear that they were
waiting for parking permits, but first . . .

As if a light bulb appeared atop my
head, I realized it was registration day,
or reg day in the language of the Farm
that doesn't permit any word other than
Tresidder to have more than one
syllable. Registration is such a special
time — 13,0()0 people waiting on 13,000
lines for something like 13,000 hours.
My first stop was at the booths of two
competing long distance companies. I
asked a representative of the first com
pany, the smaller of the two, why I

should choose the company whose ser
vice he was hawking.
He told me something about savings
on every call versus you-know-who. I
pointed out that a consumer group just
said the savings were minimal. He curtly
mentioned something about "volume
discounts" as I headed away.
Next, I went over to the you-know
who booth. You-know-who used to han
dle the whole kit and kaboodle as far as
telephones went. Ah, those were the
days.
Anyway, you-know-who told me they
could offer operator assistance, instant
credit for wrong numbers and all sorts of
other goodies. They added that those
"other guys" don't really save you all
that much after all.
I returned to the representative for the
"other guys" with my new body of
knowledge and they told me you-know
who was trying to do you-know-what to
me . I decided I knew nothing more than
when I started and that I'd flip a coin
when I was ready to pick a phone com
pany.
My next stop was the Patio Grill,
Tresidder's outdoor barbecued food ser
vice. 1 asked someone on the burger line
why he chose not to eat the chicken,
which I find delicious, and he told me he
was a freshman. "He'll learn," I
thought.

I then asked the woman in front of me
why she was going for the chicken —
what a devil's advocate I can be — and
she cited health reasons. When I brought
up the fact that recent studies show that
all barbecued food is unhealthy, she
decided poultry was the lesser of two
evils.

My chicken sandwich and I followed
the mellow jazz sounds we heard to the
Tresidder patio. As I enjoyed the music
of the Bob Murphy Trio (No, they're not
all named Bob Murphy) 1 reckoned that
these noon concerts were one of the
most underappreciated things on
campus.

1 made my way up the spiral staircase
to the place where one pays one's bills.
Since my checkbook told me I had
$3,000 less than I needed to pay my bill,
I asked how I could defer part of my
payment. I mentioned to the woman at
the deferment desk that since the lines
were long it probably made sense to
defer anyway, to avoid the long wait.
She told me 1 must be an impatient
Californian. I replied that I was actually
an impatient New Yorker. She later ex
plained that she was a New Zealander
and found most Americans to be impa
tient.
I then headed toward a line labelled
"No Clue" to try to figure out what it
was. After I stood there for a few mo
ments a man identified himself as the
"No Clue" person. He was answering
questions on the "Quick Answers" line.
I waited for five minutes as he gave
someone a rather lengthy answer. I gave
up all hope about getting a clue about
"No Clue" after all.
I went outside to the information table
which was manned by two good friends
of mine, Tom and Rob. I asked them to
tell me the most difficult question that
had been posed to them all day. "What
was the fastest land animal," Tom said.

He added that he knew the an
swer was the cheetah.
Then 1 happened by a room
with a "Financial Aids" sign
hung outside. The four people
there weren't quite sure why
they had no line outside their
door when everyone else did.
The line to talk to the meal
card people seemed especially
long. One woman told me she
had been waiting for over an hour
to get her meal card, which she
found out that she needed after
waiting two-and-one-half hours
to open a bank account. She
added that she got up early to
sign up for classes and didn't
even get the English class she
wanted.
She was a freshman and part of
me wanted to tell her it gets
easier. Another part of me inter
vened and said "Why lie?" In
stead, I wished her luck and
headed down to class sign-ups.
Sign ups were in LOTS 11, the
old bowling alley, and the
monstrous line of people barely
fit into the building. I asked a su
pervisor if she thought the com
puters they were using helped
speed things up. As she was ex
tolling their virtues and com
menting on their reliability, I dis
covered the system had gone
down — that's computerese for:
It's stopped working altogether
— and would remain down for
another 30 minutes.
The excuse was something
about how the after-lunch rush to
use computers slows things
down. If that's reliability I think
we should go back to Old Union
and break out those sign-up
books that have worked for so
many years.
While waiting, I saw my friend
Nettie, who spent the summer
working as a physical therapist, a
job she had hoped to make her
career. She discovered she hated
it and now, with one quarter of
college to go, she is in the midst

of a what-am-I-going-to-do-with
my-life crisis.
While the delay continued I
talked to one of the people who
was working with the computers.
My obvious question was: Do
you get to sign yourself up first?
She said yes, hut added that she
had to work 36 hours over four
days to get that privilege.
On my way to the Bookstore I
ran into Dineen, who 1 had first
met on the deferment line. She
deferred payment of almost as
much money as I did.
I stopped briefly at the parking
permit line. A transfer student
who is from Los Angeles told me
she had been waiting for quite a
while. I asked if she thought it
was difficult to park at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, her
former school, but she didn't
know because she didn't have a
car when she was there.
Then I checked in at Old Un
ion. Unbelievably, people were
waiting nearly two hours just to
get valid ID cards. They could
then take those ID cards and go
wait on more lines of nearly the
same length. "How truly
bizarre," I thought to myself.
1 finally reached the Bookstore
and thus surprised to find out
that the lines were moving
swiftly.
I went up to the textbook sec
tion, where 1 explained to a
slightly confused freshman that
his English book was under "F"
for Freshman Engligh not "E,"
as logic would dictate. He appre
ciated my assistance.
On my way out I saw my friend
Shelly. She lives all the way up in
Hurlburt, but 1 actually went up
there a few nights ago to visit.
Neither she nor Tracy, her
roommate and another friend of
mine, was home, and they had no
pad on which I could leave a
note.
I didn't know when I'd have a
chance to make the trek up to
visit them, but I did know it
would take me less time than
waiting on nearly any of the lines
I came across today.

As if a light bulb appeared atop my
head, I realized it was registration day,
or reg day in the language of the Farm
that doesn't permit any word other than
Tresidder to have more than one
syllable. Registration is such a special
time — 13,0()0 people waiting on 13,000
lines for something like 13,000 hours.
My first stop was at the booths of two
competing long distance companies. I
asked a representative of the first com
pany, the smaller of the two, why I

should choose the company whose ser
vice he was hawking.
He told me something about savings
on every call versus you-know-who. I
pointed out that a consumer group just
said the savings were minimal. He curtly
mentioned something about "volume
discounts" as I headed away.
Next, I went over to the you-know
who booth. You-know-who used to han
dle the whole kit and kaboodle as far as
telephones went. Ah, those were the
days.
Anyway, you-know-who told me they
could offer operator assistance, instant
credit for wrong numbers and all sorts of
other goodies. They added that those
"other guys" don't really save you all
that much after all.
I returned to the representative for the
"other guys" with my new body of
knowledge and they told me you-know
who was trying to do you-know-what to
me . I decided I knew nothing more than
when I started and that I'd flip a coin
when I was ready to pick a phone com
pany.
My next stop was the Patio Grill,
Tresidder's outdoor barbecued food ser
vice. 1 asked someone on the burger line
why he chose not to eat the chicken,
which I find delicious, and he told me he
was a freshman. "He'll learn," I
thought.

I then asked the woman in front of me
why she was going for the chicken —
what a devil's advocate I can be — and
she cited health reasons. When I brought
up the fact that recent studies show that
all barbecued food is unhealthy, she
decided poultry was the lesser of two
evils.

My chicken sandwich and I followed
the mellow jazz sounds we heard to the
Tresidder patio. As I enjoyed the music
of the Bob Murphy Trio (No, they're not
all named Bob Murphy) 1 reckoned that
these noon concerts were one of the
most underappreciated things on
campus.

1 made my way up the spiral staircase
to the place where one pays one's bills.
Since my checkbook told me I had
$3,000 less than I needed to pay my bill,
I asked how I could defer part of my
payment. I mentioned to the woman at
the deferment desk that since the lines
were long it probably made sense to
defer anyway, to avoid the long wait.
She told me 1 must be an impatient
Californian. I replied that I was actually
an impatient New Yorker. She later ex
plained that she was a New Zealander
and found most Americans to be impa
tient.
I then headed toward a line labelled
"No Clue" to try to figure out what it
was. After I stood there for a few mo
ments a man identified himself as the
"No Clue" person. He was answering
questions on the "Quick Answers" line.
I waited for five minutes as he gave
someone a rather lengthy answer. I gave
up all hope about getting a clue about
"No Clue" after all.
I went outside to the information table
which was manned by two good friends
of mine, Tom and Rob. I asked them to
tell me the most difficult question that
had been posed to them all day. "What
was the fastest land animal," Tom said.

He added that he knew the an
swer was the cheetah.
Then 1 happened by a room
with a "Financial Aids" sign
hung outside. The four people
there weren't quite sure why
they had no line outside their
door when everyone else did.
The line to talk to the meal
card people seemed especially
long. One woman told me she
had been waiting for over an hour
to get her meal card, which she
found out that she needed after
waiting two-and-one-half hours
to open a bank account. She
added that she got up early to
sign up for classes and didn't
even get the English class she
wanted.
She was a freshman and part of
me wanted to tell her it gets
easier. Another part of me inter
vened and said "Why lie?" In
stead, I wished her luck and
headed down to class sign-ups.
Sign ups were in LOTS 11, the
old bowling alley, and the
monstrous line of people barely
fit into the building. I asked a su
pervisor if she thought the com
puters they were using helped
speed things up. As she was ex
tolling their virtues and com
menting on their reliability, I dis
covered the system had gone
down — that's computerese for:
It's stopped working altogether
— and would remain down for
another 30 minutes.
The excuse was something
about how the after-lunch rush to
use computers slows things
down. If that's reliability I think
we should go back to Old Union
and break out those sign-up
books that have worked for so
many years.
While waiting, I saw my friend
Nettie, who spent the summer
working as a physical therapist, a
job she had hoped to make her
career. She discovered she hated
it and now, with one quarter of
college to go, she is in the midst

of a what-am-I-going-to-do-with
my-life crisis.
While the delay continued I
talked to one of the people who
was working with the computers.
My obvious question was: Do
you get to sign yourself up first?
She said yes, hut added that she
had to work 36 hours over four
days to get that privilege.
On my way to the Bookstore I
ran into Dineen, who 1 had first
met on the deferment line. She
deferred payment of almost as
much money as I did.
I stopped briefly at the parking
permit line. A transfer student
who is from Los Angeles told me
she had been waiting for quite a
while. I asked if she thought it
was difficult to park at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, her
former school, but she didn't
know because she didn't have a
car when she was there.
Then I checked in at Old Un
ion. Unbelievably, people were
waiting nearly two hours just to
get valid ID cards. They could
then take those ID cards and go
wait on more lines of nearly the
same length. "How truly
bizarre," I thought to myself.
1 finally reached the Bookstore

my-life crisis.
While the delay continued I
talked to one of the people who
was working with the computers.
My obvious question was: Do
you get to sign yourself up first?
She said yes, hut added that she
had to work 36 hours over four
days to get that privilege.
On my way to the Bookstore I
ran into Dineen, who 1 had first
met on the deferment line. She
deferred payment of almost as
much money as I did.
I stopped briefly at the parking
permit line. A transfer student
who is from Los Angeles told me
she had been waiting for quite a
while. I asked if she thought it
was difficult to park at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, her
former school, but she didn't
know because she didn't have a
car when she was there.
Then I checked in at Old Un
ion. Unbelievably, people were
waiting nearly two hours just to
get valid ID cards. They could
then take those ID cards and go
wait on more lines of nearly the
same length. "How truly
bizarre," I thought to myself.
1 finally reached the Bookstore
and thus surprised to find out
that the lines were moving
swiftly.
I went up to the textbook sec
tion, where 1 explained to a
slightly confused freshman that
his English book was under "F"
for Freshman Engligh not "E,"
as logic would dictate. He appre
ciated my assistance.
On my way out I saw my friend
Shelly. She lives all the way up in
Hurlburt, but 1 actually went up
there a few nights ago to visit.
Neither she nor Tracy, her
roommate and another friend of
mine, was home, and they had no
pad on which I could leave a
note.
I didn't know when I'd have a
chance to make the trek up to
visit them, but I did know it
would take me less time than
waiting on nearly any of the lines
I came across today.
