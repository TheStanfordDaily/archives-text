# Roving reporter rambles through registration

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
When I awoke yesterday morning 1
knew something big was going on, but I
wasn't sure what it was. I found the an
swer quickly as I rode my bicycle down
Mayfield Avenue and into White Plaza.
Just as I passed by the new speaker's
rostrum I came to a screeching halt to
avoid crashing into the wall of people
that suddenly appeared in front of me. It
would later become clear that they were
waiting for parking permits, but first . . .

As if a light bulb appeared atop my
head, I realized it was registration day,
or reg day in the language of the Farm
that doesn't permit any word other than
Tresidder to have more than one
syllable. Registration is such a special
time — 13,0()0 people waiting on 13,000
lines for something like 13,000 hours.
My first stop was at the booths of two
competing long distance companies. I
asked a representative of the first com
pany, the smaller of the two, why I

should choose the company whose ser
vice he was hawking.
He told me something about savings
on every call versus you-know-who. I
pointed out that a consumer group just
said the savings were minimal. He curtly
mentioned something about "volume
discounts" as I headed away.
Next, I went over to the you-know
who booth. You-know-who used to han
dle the whole kit and kaboodle as far as
telephones went. Ah, those were the
days.
Anyway, you-know-who told me they
could offer operator assistance, instant
credit for wrong numbers and all sorts of
other goodies. They added that those
"other guys" don't really save you all
that much after all.
I returned to the representative for the
"other guys" with my new body of
knowledge and they told me you-know
who was trying to do you-know-what to
me . I decided I knew nothing more than
when I started and that I'd flip a coin
when I was ready to pick a phone com
pany.
My next stop was the Patio Grill,
Tresidder's outdoor barbecued food ser
vice. 1 asked someone on the burger line
why he chose not to eat the chicken,
which I find delicious, and he told me he
was a freshman. "He'll learn," I
thought.

I then asked the woman in front of me
why she was going for the chicken —
what a devil's advocate I can be — and
she cited health reasons. When I brought
up the fact that recent studies show that
all barbecued food is unhealthy, she
decided poultry was the lesser of two
evils.

My chicken sandwich and I followed
the mellow jazz sounds we heard to the
Tresidder patio. As I enjoyed the music
of the Bob Murphy Trio (No, they're not
all named Bob Murphy) 1 reckoned that
these noon concerts were one of the
most underappreciated things on
campus.

1 made my way up the spiral staircase
to the place where one pays one's bills.
Since my checkbook told me I had
$3,000 less than I needed to pay my bill,
I asked how I could defer part of my
payment. I mentioned to the woman at
the deferment desk that since the lines
were long it probably made sense to
defer anyway, to avoid the long wait.
She told me 1 must be an impatient
Californian. I replied that I was actually
an impatient New Yorker. She later ex
plained that she was a New Zealander
and found most Americans to be impa
tient.
I then headed toward a line labelled
"No Clue" to try to figure out what it
was. After I stood there for a few mo
ments a man identified himself as the
"No Clue" person. He was answering
questions on the "Quick Answers" line.
I waited for five minutes as he gave
someone a rather lengthy answer. I gave
up all hope about getting a clue about
"No Clue" after all.
I went outside to the information table
which was manned by two good friends
of mine, Tom and Rob. I asked them to
tell me the most difficult question that
had been posed to them all day. "What
was the fastest land animal," Tom said.
