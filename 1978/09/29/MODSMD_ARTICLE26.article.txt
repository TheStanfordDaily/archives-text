## Stark may start at QB 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
With the Stanford football
team off to its worst start in his
three-year tenure. Coach Jack
Elway is thinking about making
changes — and the move he may
make could put a sophomore
quarterback without a down of
college football experience in the
starting spot against powerful
UCLA this Saturday.
At yesterday's weekly press
conference, Elway announced he
may start Scott Stark against the
Bruins in place of incumbent
quarterback Greg Ennis, but a
final decision will not be made
until the end of the week. "We're
going through the process of de
ciding if we'll make a quarter
back change," Elway said.
Elway emphasized that he is
not pinning blame for Stanford's
poor start on Ennis. "I've told
Greg Ennis that he's not respon
sible for us being 0-3 .... It's al
most unfair sometimes the role
the quarterback has in the overall
scheme. It's never black and
white; there are subjective
aspects. Like I told Greg, he
doesn't have anything to do with
a dive play from the 2 that
doesn't work, or a missed
audible or a bad snap.
"It's never any one thing," El
way added. "When you analyze
a football game, you analyze
many facets. We've got the
capacity to get a whole lot of
points. It's just in excellent field
position too many times we came
away without any points."
Elway also likes Stark's arm.
"He's a more accurate passer.
He's got a good release and a
good strong arm. They're both
competitiors. Greg Ennis is a
competitor and a very tough guy.

It's just a matter of percentages
and throwing the football", he
said.
Ennis, who is among the na
tional leaders in total offense,
said the announcement was a
"shock," but he understands the
reasons for any possible move.
"I had the opportunity and I had
the chance to produce," the
senior said. "I'm not going to
make any excuses."
The 6-foot-2, 190-pound Stark,
from Mission Viejo, led Califor
nia in passing his senior year at
Capistrano Valley High School
and is the second leading passer
in state history. He completed 69
percent of his passes for over
3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns.
Stark also performed well during
spring drills, completing 53 per
cent of his passes for 333 yards
and four touchdowns, the most
of any of the five quarterbacks
who were competing for the
starting spot.
"Coach Elway really didn't
say anything to me," Stark said.
"I just came out to practice and
he let me go with the first team.
I'm kind of excited, because
that's what I've been shooting
for — to play — and now it seems
like the opportunity is there."
Stark doesn't seem fazed
about the prospect of starting
against nationally ranked UCLA.
"I know they're a great team,"
he said. "It would be a great
challenge. I can't pick and
choose who we play against."
For the same reason, Elway
said he wouldn't have any hesita
tion giving Stark the call. "After
all, we're playing a tough
schedule," Elway said. "At this
level, they're all rough spots.
We're not going to play anyone
who's not rough."
Whatever the final decision is

Saturday, the team will support
the move. "We're all going to
rally around whoever's in the
game," linebacker Kevin Rich
ardson said. "I've talked to
Greg, and there are no hard
feelings on his part. He'll
practice just as hard and fight to
keep his job. We all want to win
games, and we'll stick together
as a team."
"1 can't pout around and be
sore," Ennis said. "I'm going to
go out and be positive and try to
help Scott. I've got some experi
ence that might benefit him . . . .
I'm not going to go in the tank,
and I'm not going to stop com
peting. It's a long season."

Card notes
Following Saturday's game, San
Jose State running backs Kenny
Jackson and James Saxon compared
Stanford unfavorably with California
and Oregon State, the two other Pac
-10 schools the Spartans have faced
this season. Both believed Cal was
better than the Cardinal and that
Oregon State has "more spirit."
