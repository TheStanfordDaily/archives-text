# Stanford squares off with Cal
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
If it's true that adversity builds char
acter, the Stanford women's volleyball
team will build a lot tonight. The No. 5
probably without the
services or sen for ft res a Smith, faces
California at 7:30 p.m. at Harmon
Gym.
The Golden Bears are 5-5 overall and
tied for fifth place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a 2-2 mark, while Stanford
is 7-3 on the season and 3-1 in Pac-10
play. A win would put the Cardinal all

alone in second place, behind Pac-10
leader Oregon.
Smith, a 6-foot outside hitter, injured
her ankle Friday night against Wash
ington State, and while she remained in
the match, she was unable to play Sat
urday against Washington. The First-
Team All-America left-side hitter will
be replaced by sophomore Jenny Chaf
fee, who had 14 kills in a starting role
against the Huskies.
Picked to finish sixth in the confer
ence in a preseason coaches' poll, Cal
is off to a solid start. The Bears lost in
four games to No. 16 USC, then lost

last week in three close games to No. 4
UCLA. Cal had more luck at home,
however, beating both Washington and
WSU.
Stanford is also on a two-match win
ning streak after beating both Washing
ton schools la.st weekend.
The Cardinal is led by seniors Nancy
Reno, Wendi Rush and Smith. Reno
leads the team in kills, with 110, and in
total blocks, with 32. Rush has 370 as
sists already this year, putting her on a
pace to break the Cardinal season
