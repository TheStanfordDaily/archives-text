# Card 1-2 on East swing

### Robert Portnoy Editorial staff 
Despite going 1-2 last week, the
Stanford field hockey team proved it
belongs among the nation's powers.
The No. 6 Cardinal opened
Thursday with a hard-fought 2-0 loss at
No. 2 Westchester University, then
Saturday absorbed a bitter 1-0 defeat
at 17th-ranked Delaware. Stanford
came back with a vengeance Sunday,
however, handing St. Joseph s a 1-0
defeat in Philadelphia. The Cardinal

now stands at 5-3 for the season.
Stanford's No. 6 ranking is its high
est national position in the history of
the Cardinal program.
"We felt we should have won the
Delaware game. We had some chances
to score but we just couldn't put it in.
It was our most consistent game,"
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
In the Cardinal's win over St.
Joseph's, the game's lone score came
from junior forward/midfielder Missy
Jolley. Junior midfielder Dana
Fleming leads the team in scoring
with four goals and one assist.
The offense was hurt by inju
ries to two of its key players.
Junior forwards Kat Thomas and
I.aura Gartland both were unable
to compete in all three games.
The two players were the team's
top scorers, respectively, on last
year's NCAA playoff team.
"We had hoped to win two out
of the three games." Johnson
said. "We had problems with our
final scoring. We were taking a
lot of shots, but the ball wasn't
going in for us.'
The Cardinal sports three na
tionally regarded players. Junior
goalkeeper Karen Jones has been
named to the West Regional All-
America team the last two
seasons. Fleming and Thomas
also earned that honor in 1986.
If Stanford is to repeat its
NCAA performance of last
season, it needs to be in top form
as the month of October draws
near. The next three games are
home matches against NorPac
rivals San Jose State (Oct. 3),
California (Oct. 10) and Pacific
(Oct. 14).
Last season Stanford split a
home-and-home series with
SJSU and swept UOP with
identical 1-0 scores. Against Cal
last year, ( the Cardinal came
away with a 1-1 draw in
Berkeley, then throttled the
Bears 4-2 at home.
