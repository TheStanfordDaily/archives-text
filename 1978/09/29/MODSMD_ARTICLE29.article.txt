The People's Republic of China's na
tional golf team met the Stanford men's
and women's golf teams yesterday in a
goodwill match at the Stanford Golf
Course.
Comprised of athletes from 18 to 22
years old, the Chinese national team is
a government-sponsored program in its
fourth year of existence. Players are
selected to the team on the basis of
their potential golf ability.
"It was an opportunity for people
over here to get to know people from

mainland China," Stanford women's
golf coach Tim Baldwin said of the
goodwill match. "This was the first
competitive match that the Chinese na
tional team has ever played."
The Cardinal women won 7.5:4.5
and the Stanford men were 12.5:5.5
victors in match-play competition.
Three points were awarded per match,
with one point going to the winner of
the front nine holes, one point to the
back-nine winner and one point to the
overall winner.
Despite only having played golf for
three years, China's Wong Li Xia shot
a 75, — the lowest score of any of the

women golfers. Freshman Michele
Lyford recorded the Cardinal's best
round with a 76 total. Junior Roger
Miraglia was the top male finisher,
shooting a 70.
"They (the Chinese national team
members) are terrific golfers,'
Baldwin said. "The match play was
very competitive. I think when they
come back next year the score will be
even Steven."
The exhibition with the Chinese na
tional team kicks off a sparse fall
season for Baldwin's team as it looks to
repeat last season's appearance in the
NCAA Championships.
