# Report: phone rates vary little
## 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
Despite the advertising claims made by long
distance phone companies, there is little differ
ence in the rates charged by American Tele
phone & Telegraph Co. and its major competi
tors on most long-distance calls, a San
Francisco-based consumer advocacy group re
ported.
However, students may be able to cut down
on their phone bills if they qualify for the Pacific
Bell Lifeline Service, according to a survey
released earlier this month by Consumer Ac
tion.
Julie Griesert, staff researcher for Consumer
Action, said that students should consider
travel features, volume discount plans, installa
tion costs, international calls and any other spe
cial features the companies may offer when
choosing a long-distance carrier, "since the
rates are so similar."
For out-of-state calls, the charges for the six
different long-distance services listed on the
student phone application form are nearly
identical, Griesert said.
However, the survey found that there is a
slight range between carriers for intrastate
calls. Griesert said the survey showed that
there is a 29-cent range among the carriers for a
5-minute, 40-second daytime call from San
Francisco to Los Angeles. The prices start at
$1.56 for American Network, climbing only to
$1.81 for MCI and peaking at $1.84 for AT&T.

Griesert said that the time of the day students
make the most calls and the distance they are
calling are both factors to be considered when
selecting long-distance service.
"We're telling consumers to decide what
types of calls they make and then call the indi
vidual companies for sample rates. That way
they can make an accurate comparison," she
said.
Students who qualify for the Lifeline Service
in California can obtain telephone service for as
low as $1.48 per month, according to Dick
Fitzmaurice, manager of media relations for
Pacific Bell. This price includes 60 untimed lo
cal calls per month.
The Lifeline Service entitles students to sig
nificantly lower installation fees that are only
one-half of the regular charge. Also, installation
time for Lifeline Service is the same as for regu
lar Pacific Bell service, about three business
days.
Fitzmaurice said that qualification for
Lifeline Service depends on a person's income.
For a household or dorm room of one or two
people, annual gross income can be no more
than $12,1(H) to qualify.
Only income from jobs, scholarship money
and spending money provided by parents are
counted in the $12,100 cciling. Money for tui
tion provided by parents and student loans do
not count in the figure.
In addition, the student applying for the
Lifeline Service cannot be claimed as a depen
dent on anyone else's income tax return,
Fitzmaurice said.
