# Sand Hill plan winning support
## 
### Nick Anderson Staff writer 
A controversial initiative to extend
Sand Hill Road east to El Camino Real
is gathering support from representa
tives of Stanford. Menlo Park and Palo
Alto.
The Sand Hill link, which has been
proposed several times in the last 50
years, would route traffic around the
parking lot of the Stanford Shopping
Center. Currently, the road ends in the
middle of the parking lot. and cars must
wind through to the lot entrance to
reach HI Camino Real.
A six-member task force to study de
velopment of the land between the
Stanford Shopping Center and San
Francisquito Creek was established in
late July with the joint backing of the
Palo Alto City Council, the Menlo Park

City Council and the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
The task force, composed of two
representatives from each community,
met in late July and will meet again in
October, according to Boh Freelen,
Stanford vice president for Public Af
fairs and a member of the task force.
Freelen said that although the proj
ect is "long range," he was optimistic
about its success.
"The extension will improve ingress
and egress to the shopping center, take
traffic off the streets of Menlo Park,
and improve safety for Stanford resi
dents who use the road," Freelen said.
Freelen said there was no time frame
established for completion of a pro
posal. in part because of the political
difficulties that must be overcome.
"No one's daring enough to give it a
time frame," he said, adding that a
"thorough" exploration of "new for

mulations" was needed before an ef
fective environmental impact report
could be prepared.
Palo Alto City Manager William
Zaner, who organized the task force,
said in July that the road will be con
structed eventually. "We can reconcile
the very different interests of Stanford.
Palo Alto and Menlo Park." he said.
The most recent proposal was killed
in court in when Menlo Park resi
dents along San Francisquito Creek
successfully challenged the environ
mental impact report prepared by Stan
ford, claiming that erosion problems
were not taken into account.
But Menlo Park council woman Jan
La Fetra, another task force member,
said yesterday that the "no growth"
advocates in her community are now
outweighed bv those who recognise the
value of reduced traffic conges
tion along Sand Hill and Willow
roads.
La Fetra cautioned that resi
dents are still concerned about
the environment. "We want to
make sure that Stanford protects
the creek," she said, noting that
the current construction repair
ing University drainage systems
next to San Francisquito creek is
a concern to Menlo Park.
Menlo Park and Palo Alto have
both traditionally criticized the
proposed link, while Stanford
has always been in favor of com
pleting the road.
One sticking point is whether
the road should continue through
HI Camino and connect with
Alma Street in Palo Alto. Menlo
Park officials advocate the move.

but Palo Alto officials wishing to
protect the residential area east
of El Camino Real strongly
oppose it. La Fetra predicted a
compromise on the issue would
be worked out through the task
force.
"The obstacles exist mostly in
people's minds and they are poli
tically hot," she said. "We want
light instead of heat."
Other members of the task
force include William Massy,
Stanford vice president for Busi
ness and Finance; Palo Alto
Mayor Gail Woolley; Palo Alto
Councilman Leland Levy; and
Menlo Park Councilman Calvin
Jones.
