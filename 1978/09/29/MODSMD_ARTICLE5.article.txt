Comedians, the Stanford Hand and
the rock group The Tubes will kick oft*
a campus-wide celebration Thursday
night designed as a first step to improve
the image of this year's four Council of
Presidents (COP) members.
According to council member Maria
Canas, the COP wants to be more ac
cessible to students and"the party will
help the image of the ASSU in gen
eral."
Running on a platform last spring
which emphasized improved communi
cation with the student body, Jim
Durkin, Leonard Adler, Maria Canas
and Roechelle Smith, this year's COP
members, see the ASSU-sponsored
dance as one step in their active effort
to change the ASSU's image.
"We don't want to be seen as a
bunch of petty bureaucrats. We want

students to have a better idea of what
the ASSU is doing," Durkin said.
According to Durkin, the party,
called the "Welcome Back to The
Farm, Go Stanford, Beat UCLA, First
Big All Campus Party," is so large
scale that the ASSU is the only student
organization with the financial capabil

put up the money, no one will." Durkin
said.
According to Adler, $10.(KM) will be
spent on the party. Adler stressed that
the money does not come from student
fees but from accumulated ASSU prof

Agreeing with Durkin, Adler said the
party will kick the year off with
aplomb. "It will show that we re here
to help the students," Adler said.
In addition to staging the party, the
COP hopes to research student inter
ests by establishing a straw poll.

"We'll poll the student body every two
weeks over the phone." Durkin said,
adding that over KM) hours of research
in statistical methods were spent this
summer to set up an accurate polling
system.
To further strengthen the COP's link
to students, each COP member plans to
attend one dorm meeting per week.
The COP will also schedule weekly of
fice hours in White Plaza to talk with
students on the run. "We held five
(office times) during the main part of
summer term. Now we'll probably hold
them on Wednesdays from II to I,"
Durkin said, emphasizing that final
times have not yet been determined.
Freshmen were also targeted by the
COP's communication campaign. Ori
entation packets contained ASSU
handouts. Adler said that many fresh-
