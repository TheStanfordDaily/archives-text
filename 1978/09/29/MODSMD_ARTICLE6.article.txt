# Fatality may spur dry stadium rule

### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
The University is "abso
lutely" prepared to ban alcohol
in Stanford Stadium if behavioi
of spectators at Saturday's
UCLA-Stanford football game is
not better than it was at last
week's game. Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said yesterday.
"We're going to watch care
fully," Geiger said. "If it's a zoo,
then we'll admit that we have
failed, and we'll change."
Geiger's pledge came two days
after a game marked by the pos
sibly alcohol-related death of one
spectator, 10 citations of un
derage Stanford students for pos
session of alcohol, and at least
six fights involving spectators
who had been drinking.
Geiger, who said he was
"disappointed" by Saturday's
events, said the UCLA game is a
"last chance" for spectators to
show that they can drink respon
sibly at the stadium. In past dis
cussions of the stadium alcohol
policy, the University has main
tained that students should be
allowed to decide for themselves
the kind of behavior that is ac
ceptable in the stands.
"Once again, we're going to
appeal to this community to
please don't throw things at other
people, please don't abuse alco
hol, and please have considera
tion for those sitting next to you
and around you," Geiger said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of Student Affairs
for Residential Education, ex
pressed support for Geiger's ul
timatum, asserting that students
have had ample opportunity to
show that they can drink respon
sibly in the stadium.
Stanford, the only member of
the Pacific 10 Conference to al
low alcohol in its stadium,
decided after a lengthy review of
the policy last spring to continue
on a probationary basis its

longstanding policy of allowing
alcohol in the stadium.
The University Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation said in May that
its decision represented a "trial
continuation" of its policy and
that a more permanent decision
to allow drinking was contingent
on improved behavior by specta
tors.
The committee will hold a reg
ularly scheduled meeting in the
weeks between Saturday's game
and Stanford's next home game
on Oct. 20 and will decide
whether spectator conduct this
year warrants a continuation of
the policy, University officials
said. The committee makes rec
ommendations to University
President Donald Kennedy, who
has final authority.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said police will con
tinue to check identification of
students carrying alcohol into
games. "Anybody under the age
of 21 should understand that they
run the risk of being cited," he
said.
"Underage drinking has just
been too open," said Herrington.
"Last year, it was even being
flaunted in front of my officers.
We've got to do something to cut
it down."
Herrington said, however, that
despite the effort to check identi
fication. last Saturday's incidents
marked another escalation in un

ruly behavior in the student sec
tion at football games.
Herrington described the fol
lowing incidents:
•San Jose resident Matthew
Carlyle died, apparently of
alcohol-related causes, while jog
ging back to his car at halftime to
get beer to bring into the
stadium.
• Police issued citations to 10 stu
dents under the age of 21 for pos
session of alcohol after warning
students lined up outside the
stadium that they would be at the
gates to check identification
cards of those carrying alcohol.
The 10 were issued citations at
the stadium gate and released on
the spot. It is likely that they will
receive fines.
•Police broke up six fights —
three of them in the student sec
tion — and evicted a handful of
people. All the scuffles appeared
to involve people who had been
drinking.
• Police received six calls from
people complaining about specta
tors throwing bottles, cans and
other debris.
• Several Palo Alto residents
complained to police about noisy
gatherings of students who
camped outside the stadium

Friday night in order to get the
best seats.
•One spectator, who was not a
student, drank so heavily he ex
perienced convulsions. Police
took him to the Stanford Hospital
emergency room, where he
recovered.
Debate over stadium alcohol
policy followed a 1986 football
season marked by increased un
ruliness in the stands. During last
year's games, several spectators
and a member of the Dollies were
hit by debris thrown by rowdy
fans, and complaints about
drunken behavior increased sub
stantially.
Reactions from two fraternity
officers varied widely. Beta
Theta Pi House Manager Scott
Forest said student behavior in
the stands has not reached the
point where alcohol should be
banned, and he questioned
whether underage drinking was
causing the problems.
Kappa Alpha House Manager
Chris Erlin said, however, that
the police activity was a fair
response to problems in the
stands and that the atmosphere at
last Saturday's game was calmer
than usual. Other fraternity offi
cers could not be reached for
comment.
