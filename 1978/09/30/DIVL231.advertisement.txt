A steaming cauldron appears at your table, as
if by magic, and its delicious contents never run
dry! All the magnificent soup you want is just
the introduction to your dinner, to be followed
by fresh finger salad and then the entree of your
choice accompanied by a basket of hot finger
able potato wedges! But don't hurry; take your
sweet time to savor your meal, your surround
ings and your companions. That, after all, is
why we created Tomfoolery's!
