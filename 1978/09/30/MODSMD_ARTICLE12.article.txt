# Band looks for a new peace

Tra la. Trees erupt in a color
explosion. The fur-parka'd
throngs gather outside the
stadium, reddened noses grow
ing ever redder through pre
game tail-gately preparation.
Days at the beach just a memory,
the excited students huddle to
gether, warding off inhibitions
and the academic grind at the
weekly fall ritual known as
Saturday Football. Yes, its game
time in New England.
Meanwhile ... out at Stanford
U. on the Waste Coast...
Hi. A glorious many happy re
turns is wisht upon our student
friends, and you new faces up
there should seek out any
needed assistance in the use of
the special Hospitality and
Travel Kits provided for your
enjoyment.
glad to see us, or is that just the
fruit of the Wild Turkey? Un
sightly bulges in clothing are
back in style as students
gracelessly acknowledge that D.
of A.'s new Rules of Order. The
first airlifted kegs should be
dropping into the stadium any
minute. But smoking is permit
ted, for those into that vice.
Excuse us if we of the Band (or,
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, as youAve/us/they please)
stay standing, but we're recover
ing from a lashing and we're
sore. We're so misunderstood.

Really, we never mean to offend.
Anything seeming to be "dirty"
or "offensive" in our formations
is entirely the product of a sick
mind. Yours.
To the show . ..
As the New Wave of students
descends upon Stanford, the
LSJUMB celebrates the fresh
start by forming the traditional
Chain Saw, inspiring lumber
jacks everywhere with the 'Scalp
Song." (In the neck, theneck
thenecktheneck.)
As a service to new students,
the Band next offers two selec
tions from their new, improved
Course Guide. Occasionally,
even Band members have free

hours to attend classes, but
time-motion research has been
employed to choose properly
challenging classes. As students
of the comic tradition, we occa
sionally take a "Micky Mouse"
course. "Don't You Worry 'Bout
A Thing," because similarly chal
lenging courses abound
throughout the course catalog.
Inadequate high school prep
aration is sometimes a problem.
In courses like Human Sexuality,
regular home study is a must.
Contents of seminar shared with
laboratory experience should
overcome any backwards train
ing in earlier prep school years,
the "Uptight" old days.

Arthur P. Barnes, man about
town and a remarkable com
eback story himself, leads the
always stirring salute to our
sponsor.
Halftime brings a temporary
stopping of hostilities on the
field. The Band salutes grander
scale efforts at peace abroad,
with a little help from US friends.
We begin Saturday's show by
portraying the honkers sniffing
out a line to permanent peace,
possibly "Two Tickets to
Paradise." BIG TALK is cheap at
any price, if only we may soon
"Sing A Song" of peace. Look to
J.C. to provide the answer. The
star of Camp David who turns

swords in to plowshares has spur
red optimism such that it "Feels
Like the First Time" that the
pair-a-mid Easterners may walk
hand-in-hand along the Jordan
River.
On the West Bank, however,
large green armored rolling
things (you're welcome) remind
us of another role America plays
in settling wars and "Stuff Like
That."
Finally, the hands of fate and
time march to a fitting climax,
celebrated by the seers and doers
of the Band as we invited you to
share in the "Fun-Fun-Fun."
