# New scoreboards highlight Stanford Stadium
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
In what may be the best addi
tion to Cardinal football since
the arrival of head coach Bill
Walsh, the Cards have acquired
two new football scoreboards
for Stanford Stadium; and ac
quired them at no cost.
The scoreboard system, first
used against Oklahoma Sept. 9,
includes a one line message
board on the north scoreboard
which can give scores and stats,
lead cheers, and recognize out
standing achievements.

According to Associate Athle
tic Director Bob Young, one of
the driving forces behind the ac
quisition, American Sign and In
dicator Corporation manufac
tured and gave Stanford the
scoreboards under the terms of a
10-year contract.
Young says, "The scoreboard
has been granted to Stanford for
the privilege of selling the
Scoreboard's advertising for 10
years in association with the
name of Stanford football, with
Stanford retaining advertising

approval.
"In addition the University re
ceives $5OOO in expenses per
year for 10 years to help pay for
maintenance."
American Sign and Indicator
has also made scoreboards for,
among others, California,
Washington, Arizona State and
the Rose Bowl. Besides the two
football scoreboards, two new
basketball scoreboards are going
into Maples Pavilion.
From the fan's viewpoint, the
key feature of the new system
will be the message board, which
is run from the press box by
former Stanford students Rich
Domich and Larry Goldman.
According to Goldman the
message board operates through
a computer terminal.
"It is a terminal where I type
messages into the computer," he
says. "I p re-prog ram messages
before the game which remain in
the memory until the power goes
off. During the game I can call
for them when the appropriate

times arise."
Domich says one of his favo
rite messages so far has been
"Way To Go Junior" with
"Junior" referring to sophomore
running back Darrin Nelson.
This message is typed into the
computer before the game and,
if Nelson breaks off a long run or
scores a touchdown,- it can be
called and flashed across the
message board.
Except for the required adver
tisements and a few special mes
sages, Domich and Goldman are
free to use their own material.
Domich says they are "always
looking for more messages and
fans with ideas should turn them
in at the Sports Information Of
fice at the Athletic Department.
Although there is only one line
for messages, Goldman says he
feels only the surface has been
scratched in what can be ac
complished with the new boards.
"I would like somehow to
coordinate what the band does
on the field with what we do up

in the booth," he says. "There is
only one line, but the potential is
limitless."
The scoreboard should defi
nitely improve the game for the
fans.
According to Young, "It adds a
complete new dimension that
we've never had. The message
center adds to the enjoyment of
the games, to the spirit of the
fans, and gives us a chance to
recognize people for outstand
ing achievement."
Assistant Publicity Director
Nancy Peterson says, "It gives
Stanford Stadium a new atmos
phere; it makes it feel more like a
home stadium."
With seven wins in eight home
games during the Walsh era, op
ponents probably feel an even
greater home field edge is the
last thing the Cards need.

These artist's renderings of the
new scoreboards (if you want to
see the real thing, take a seat in
the stadium and look around),
show the artist's opinion of the
outcome of a certain Big Game.
46-20 is certainly believable, but
what about the time left?
