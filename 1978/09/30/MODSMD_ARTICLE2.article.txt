# Will the Green Wave crash today?
## Cardinals ready for high tide 
### IVAN MAISEL 
New Orleans is the mouth of
the Mississippi, right? But
whoever heard of "crashing"
green waves on the muddy,
lazy Mississippi?
The Tulane Green Wave
rolls, or rather trickles into
Cardinal country today to meet
head coach Pill Walsh's Stan
ford squad the Wave beset
by inconsistency and frustra
tion as both football teams
enter their fourth games.
On the other hand, Stanford,
after the heartbreaking loss to
Oklahoma, has slowly been
building up steam as they
cruise toward the Pac-10 wat
ers.
The Cardinal defense has
outdone the wildest dreams of
just about everyone, while the
offense is in the top echelons
of the corporate accounting
world of football the statis
tics.
Stanford ranks sixth in the
country in scoring, averaging
34 points per game. In passing
offense, they are seventh, av
eraging 249.7 yards per outing,
and in total offense, 15th. The
Cardinals are staking out 399
yards of real estate a game.
Individually, Steve Dils and
halfback Darrin Nelson are
vying to see whose name can
appear the most in the NCAA
weekly release. Dils leads the
country in passes completed
per game with 24.7. He is
fourth in total offense, grab
bing 245.3 yards per game on

his own.
Nelson is fourth nationally in
returning punts, getting 24.8
per return, including the
majestic 74-yarder against San
Jose State. He ranks sixth in the
country in receiving with six
passes per game.
Two spots behind Nelson is
Stanford fullback Phil Francis.
Francis has made 5.7 grabs per
game.
Tulane head coach Larry
Smith heaped praise on Dils,
calling him "every bit as
dangerous as Benjamin (pro
rookie Guy Benjamin who led
the Cardinals to last year's 9-3
record). As a matter of fact,"
Smith said, "Dils is more
dangerous because of his con
sistency."
Smith also had high ac
colades for others on the Stan
ford offense. "The three tight
ends (Marty Smith, Mitch Pleis
and Pat Bowe) are a considera
ble asset."
Smith is almost disbelieving
when the subject of the Stan
ford offense comes up. Quite
logically, he gives all the credit
to Walsh.
"Coach Walsh has one of the
finest offensive minds in the
country," Smith said. "He
proved it in the pros. When it
comes to offense, he could
squeeze mud out of a turnip."
Speaking of vegetables, re
member the old Stanford de
fense? The defense that USC
scored 49 on? If you don't re
member it, too bad, for it is lost
to the ages. The new, im
proved Stanford defense is
here the defense that has
only given up 290.3 yards per

game, the defense that has
begrudged only two
touchdowns in the second half
all year. Where did it come
from?
"We are much better defen
sively than we were last year,"

said linebacker coach Norb
Hecker. One key factor is the
installation of the 3-4 defense.
"We have outstanding out
side linebackers. You attack a
good quarterback by applying
pressure. They (Milt McColl,
Tom Hall) can do it," Hecker
said. "The inside linebackers
are basically defenders against
the run.
"The secondary has an ad
vantage," Hecker continued.
"During the week they work
against some of the best in the
country in Dils and the receiv
ers."
Tulane is 0-3 so far this sea
son, and Smith is perplexed.
"The feelings of the team
now are of frustration. In pre
season practice we thought we
would have a good season,"
Smith explained.
Smith blamed Tulane's
schedule as the primary cul
prit. "Of our first four oppo
nents, three won bowl games
last year," Smith said.
Tulane's opening game was
against Maryland, the champ
ion of the 1977 Hall of Fame
Classic (which they won by
posting a 17-7 win over Min
nesota). The score of the 1978
season opener: Maryland 31,
Tulane 7.
The next week, the Wave
hosted the Pittsburgh Panth
ers. Pittsburgh demolished
Clemson In last year's Gator
Bowl, 34-3. The score of game
two: Pittsburgh 24, Tulane 6.
Of course, today they play
the Sun Bowl Champs, Stan
ford. The score -- ?
On top of that, Tulane has

been on the road three of the
last four weeks at Maryland,
Georgia Tech and
Stanford. But Tulane has the
talent. The quarterback, junior
Roch (pronounced "Rock")
Hontas led the nation in com
pletions last year with a 63.4
percent success rate. He was
mentioned in preseason publi
cations this year as an All-
American candidate.
By looking at his statistics,
Hontas hasn't performed up to
those expectations, though.
Tulane has, only scored 30
points this season and Hontas
is averaging a grand total of
95.7 yards passing. His spe
cialty, completion percentage,
shows him with only a 51.2 per
cent mean (21-41-5 for 287
yards).
Smith defended Hontas very
quickly. "Against Maryland,
there was a breakdown in the
line. In the Pitt game, there was
a breakdown in the backfield.
These breakdowns punctured
Roch's confidence and caused
some inconsistency in his play
last week," Smith said.
Smith also admitted that
"our pass defense is the
weakest part of our defense.
We've given up 180 yards a
game in passing."
Okay, it sounds as if this will
be a comedy in four acts. After
all, Stanford's offense marches
up and down the field, while
the defense is merciless. Oh
my gosh, look at Tulane.
They're 0-3, the defense is
barely adequate, and the of
fense can't get untracked.

Inside linebacker Steve Budinger (62) fights off a futile block by Oklahoma fullback Kenny King (30) to
stand halfback Billy Sims (20) straight up. Linebacker Milt McColl (80) moves in to assist Budinger in the
tackle. Budinger has proved the perfect complement inside to Stanford all-star Gordy Ceresino in
patrolling linebacker's territory: that area right behind the front line.

Dean Wilson (91), George Norris (90), and Chuck Evans (89), the three mainstays of the Stanford
defensive line, close in on San Jose State halfback Kevin Cole (32). The defense held superbly n that
contest as Stanford won 38-9. Watch this threesome today as they try to shut down the running of Marv
Christian, Tulane's speedy tailback.
Stanford could shower and
leave at halftime and still win
48-0. Pack up the kids, Harriet.
Let's go watch reruns of Star
Trek.
Sorry, but Tulane is no
pushover. Ask Bill Walsh.
"Tulane has better offensive
tools than either San Jose State
or Illinois," Walsh said. "They
run the option well and they
have an excellent passing
game."
In addition, Tulane is raven
ously searching for a win.
Smith called it "frustrating"
they are crazed for the taste of
victory. In a bit of underestima
tion, Walsh called them "a very
dangerous opponent for us
this week."
"We are not going to unde
restimate Tulane," Hecker
said. "We did last year and we
barely hung on to win."
Stanford escaped the Mardi
Gras city with a 21-17 victory
over the Greenies. Behind the
running of tailback Marvin
Christian (142 yards, 2 TDs) and
inspired defense, Tulane led
Stanford 17-6 with nine mi
nutes left. A fumble recovery
on the Tulane 38 sparked two
quick touchdown drives and a
victory for the Cards.
Hecker realizes as well as
anyone the bad luckTulanehas
had.
"Maryland and Pittsburgh
are two tough opponents,"
Hecker explained. "Tulane has
been in two of their losses until
late in the game." Maryland is

the only team to have put them
away early.
Hecker, as linebacker coach,
has a healthyrespect for Hon
tas' skills.
"The key to stopping Hontas
is not to give him time to set
up. He's better when given
time to look and when he
scrambles. If we can make him
hurry, he'll make mistakes."
Hecker also noted that
Tulane's offense "has out
standing speed at the flanks
(receivers Darrel Griffin and
Alton Alexis). With this speed,
they are capable of breaking it
open in one play like Ok
lahoma did" end Billy
Rhodes look a screen pass 70
yards for a touchdown against
Stanford.
On defense, the Green
Wave is led by sophomore
Wilfred Simon, a 6-2, 212-
pound middle guard. Simon
made 14 tackles against Geor
gia Tech, and is Tulane's lead
ing tackier. Look for his quick
ness in corraling Darrin Nel
son.
At first glance, no lifejackets
are needed for these waves.
The Cardinals should have no
problems. Stanford is a 15-
point favorite. But this is ear
thquake country, and
everyone knows the theory
about earthquakes causing
tidal waves.
Lifejacket, anyone?
