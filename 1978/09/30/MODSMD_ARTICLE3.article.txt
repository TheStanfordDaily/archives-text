# Fullback Francis
## Light approach to serious game 
### RICH MARTINEZ 
"I believe in having a good
time on the field," Stanford
fullback Phil Francis says.
"Practices are rough, but come
Saturday, I'm ready to play
hard and enjoy myself while
I'm doing it."
Known for his light disposi
tion on and off the field, Fran
cis is playing unhampered by
injuries for the first time in two
years and finally has a reason to
chuckle.
"Sure, I laugh a bit on the
field," Francis says. "I'm hav
ing fun and it also helps to stay
loose. Besides, it's hard to
maintain when you see a funny
looking guy like Darrin Nelson
across from you in the hud
dle."
Bothered by a rash of minor
injuries as well as tendinitis in
sophomore and junior years, a
healthy Francis is playing sup
erbly and has become a large
factor in the success of the
Stanford offense. Through
three games the 6-foot-2, 210-
pound fullback has rushed 39
times for 187 yards and a 4.8
yard average while also catch
ing 17 passes for 121 yards.
In addition, the communica
tions major ranks eighth in the
nation with 5.7 catches per
game.
Francis doesn't put much
emphasis on his statistics,
though, as he says he feels so
many accomplishments of a
fullback do not appear on any
stat sheets. One statistic does

remain firmly implanted in his
mind, though.
"All I know is that last year at
this time I had rushed once for
three yards," he says. "Right
now I'm just playing game to
game, trying to stay healthy
and trying to keep injuries out
of my mind."
With the departure of john
Finley, last year's senior
fullback, Francis assumed
more of a workload. "I never
felt an intense amount of com
petition between the two of
us," Francis recalls. "I enjoyed
John coming in when I needed
a rest, and replacing him when
he needed a breather. Fullback
is a very physically demanding
position but I trained pretty
seriously during the summer
and I have enough stamina to
last the whole game."
Francis has no regrets about
playing beside his highly pub
licized backfield partner Darrin
Nelson.
Tulane head coach Larry
Smith commented that "Fran
cis is an excellent complement
to Nelson. He makes him that
much more explosive."
The two have been friends
since their first day together at
last year's training camp, and
they've been known to keep
the atmosphere loose with
their constant joking. Francis
says he feels that no one on the
team places an undue amount
of emphasis upon personal

publicity.
"None of the guys get off on
any ego trips because they
make the papers," he said.
"We're basically a low-key,
team-oriented ball club."
When asked about his plans
for the future and their relation
to football, Francis says that he
didn't like to look that far into
the future. "I've talked to some
scouts and pro football would
definitely hold priority," he
says.
"But right now I'm just cen
tering my thoughts on Tulane. I
don't want to think too much
about next year and not con
centrate enough on our up
coming games."
With the presence of a
sound Phil Francis in Stanford's
backfield, the Cards should
have one of the most volatile
tandems in the Pac-10. Explo
sive is the word to describe
Stanford's offense, which is
averaging 34 points a game,
sixth best in the NCAA.
"The best is yet to come,"
Francis said. "Even though
we're scoring that many points
a game, I feel the offense still
hasn't reached its full potential
yet."
With the Cards' offense and
Francis, in particular, reaching
their full potentials, Stanford
fans should have good reason
to do plenty of cheering, how
ever soberly they may yell.
And Phil Francis, healthy
once again, should have plenty
of fun with a good reason to
smile and maybe even chuckle.

against Oklahoma when the Cards fell 35-29. Plagued by injuries last
year, the senior fullback has had few problems this season, carrying
the ball 39 times for 187 yards and catching 17 passes for an addi
tional 121 yards.
