# On the field and with the books Hontas proves himself a winner!

Look out Jack Armstrong,
here comes Roch Hontas. Be
sides starting his third year as
Tulane's No. 1 quarterback,
Hontas happens to be modest,
smart, and just an all-around
good guy. As a matter of fact, if
the Cardinals aren't careful on
Saturday, he could give them
more than just a hard time.
Born and raised in Canton,
Ohio, Hontas has played foot
ball continuously since he was
eight, first in Little League,
then for McKinley High. Re
cruited by some of the top
schools in the nation, includ
ing Ohio State, Hontas finally
settled on Tulane.
One might ask why he chose
Tulane over a football school
like Ohio State.
"I have an older brother in
med school here," Hontas
said, "and I had another
brother working in the city. At
the time that was important,
being the close family that we
are. It just offered lots of small
things that add up. I've had a
tremendous amount of fun
playing at Tulane."
While he's having all that fun,
Hontas is also breaking a lot of
records. He was the only pas
ser last year (his sophomore
year) with a higher completion
percentage than Stanford's
own Guy Benjamin, complet
ing 63.4 percent as opposed to
Benjamin's 63 percent. Against
SMU he completed 33 of 42
passes for 374 yards, which
were Tulane game records.
His season totals of 118 com
pletions in 186 passes for 1277
yards were Tulane season re
cords. His career totals are 179
completions in 300 attempts
for 1974 yards, seven
touchdowns and only 17 inter
ceptions.
His 31-yard-run against Stan
ford last year was the longest
by a Tulane rusher in 1977, and
he was named player of the
week on offense for his per
formance. Not bad for a pre
med student who carries a 3.5
grade point average.
It is obvious that a football
star who's a pre-med with such
a high grade point average is a

rarity. One wonders if Hontas
does anything but study and
play football. Apparently not,
but he doesn't seem to mind.
"You putas much time into it
as you want to be good," Hon
tas said. "The better you want
to be, the more time its going
to take. Duringthefall all I do is
play football and study.
"Sometimes you see your
buddies going off to do some
thing and you wish you could
go. But the grass is always
greener on the other side of
the fence. If I was doing some
thing else, no matter what it
was, I'd be wishing I was start
ing against Stanford on Satur
day."
Hontas also wishes to go to
med school. It is obvious that
he is serious about both his
studies and his football; in fact
he's not quite sure which one
he's more serious about.
"Of course, anyone who
even puts on a college football
uniform has pro ball in the
back of their mind at one time
or another, but it's still a long
way off. A lot of things can
happen between now and
then," Hontas said. "But if the
opportunity ever came up I
would think about it . . . med
school is maybe more impor
tant right now, because you
never know how long a foot
ball career can last. I mean, I'll
play football for a couple of
more years, and then maybe a
couple more, but after that you
need a career."
As for right now, regardless
of last year's record, Hontas
feels that there is more than
enough room for improve
ment. "I had a fairly good year
last year; not great. I set a
foundation to build on," he
said. "I'd like to keep up my
completion average percen
tage this year, maintain what I
have and improve my weak
points. I'd like to be a more
effective runner. Last year we
didn't try the long ball so
much. This year we've tried
some and it's coming along
fairly well."
This year Hontas' comple
tion average is down to 51.-2
percent. "He's had a hard time

getting started this year,"
Tulane coach Larry Smith said.
"Like the rest of the team, all
he needs is a little confidence,
a little momentum."
Hontas concurred with
Smith. "If I look at my statistics
for the games we've played,
they're not nearly as good as I
thought they would be. Coach
Smith is absolutely right. I have
had three fair games. I have yet
to play a good game, and by no
means a great game."
Hontas certainly played a
great game last year against
Stanford, but when asked
about it he had more to say
about Guy Benjamin than him
self. He admitted that it was a
thrill to beat Benjamin statisti
cally.
"It did feel great, you know,
because we played them down
here," Hontas said. "Benjamin
started real slow, but then he
started throwing the ball

Junior Roch Hontas eyes the opposing defense before taking the snap
from center in a game last year. This year Hontas sports a new
number 7 but will present an old problem for the Cards. Last
year he dissected the Stanford defense, completing eight of nine
passes.
