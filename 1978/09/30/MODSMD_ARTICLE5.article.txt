# Cornerback, outfield
## Reynolds plays two sports for the fun of it! 
### WALT HERRING 
Surprisingly, one of Stan
ford's best cornerbacks was
not on the field in this year's
opening game against Ok
lahoma. In fact, Larry Reynolds
(the only man in Stanford his
tory to letter in both football
and baseball as a freshman)
was not even a member of the
team. However, Cardinal fans
will see the 5-foot-11, 175-
pound senior return to the
field in today's game.
"I injured my back two years
ago playing semi-pro baseball
in Alaska and wasn't sure if I
was ready to play earlier in the
season," the soft-spoken
Reynolds explained. The injury
virtually eliminated Reynolds
from the entire 1977 season.
He only saw action against
Oregon State.
"I didn't want to start right
into football this year and then
have second thoughts later,"
Reynolds continued. "But I
talked to coach Bill Walsh and

coach Mark Marquess (head
coach of varsity baseball) and
we worked out the problem.
That's from the business
standpoint. Personally, I'm
here to have fun and football is
something I really enjoy." As a
result of his late decision,
Reynolds returned to the
squad after the San Jose game
and saw action last week
against Illinois.
There is no doubt that
Reynolds return will be a shot
in the arm for the Cardinal's
sagging pass defense a de
fense which left much to be
desired last year. "Reynolds is
an excellent pass defender,"
commented linebacker coach
Norb Hecker. "He will see
more and more game time as
the season progresses and we
begin to play the big passing
teams."
Defensive back coach
George Seifert echoed similar
sentiments. "Larry is a fine de
fensive back. He's quick and

intelligent. Anytime you get a
player with those abilities he's
going to help."
Reynold's decision to resume
play was entirely his own. The
coaching staff applied little or
no pressure. "He knew we
would like to have him out.
He'd been to a couple of prac
tices earlier, but it was his deci
sion whether or not to return,"
Siefert stated. "The whole
point was whether he was
physically ready to play. He
feels he's ready to play and
we'll stand by that decision."
Understandably, Reynolds is
looking out for his baseball
career, since he is one of the
most sought after collegiate
outfielders in the nation. Ear
lier this summer he toured
Japan and Hawaii as a member
of the U.S. All-Star team. As a
high school senior from Cor
vallis, Oregon, Reynolds was
chosen by the Minnesota
Twins in the Bth round. Last
year as a junior at Stanford, he

was drafted in the4th round by
the San Diego Padres.
"I come from a family of
eight kids (I'm third from the
bottom) and they're all pretty
athletic," Reynolds related.
"Watching my older brother
Don play little league baseball
got me interested in the game.
And I've got a younger brother
still in high school, who is a
really good athlete." Don
Reynolds is now playing
baseball for the Padres.
Reynolds has rejected all
pro offers to date. "Pro
baseball is something I've al
ways wanted to do but it's not
something you just jump right
into if you're not sure.
"There are a lot of considera
tions to be taken into account
â€”the team, the minor leagues,
management, salary, etc. I fi

gured finishing school at Stan
ford was my best bet. After this
year I won't have school to
worry about."
Reynolds admits very hon
estly and very humanly that "if
they had made me a better
offer I might have gone ahead
and signed."
In this day and age it's a plea
sure to find an athlete who
looks upon sports not as a
money making proposition but
as a form of personal enjoy
ment and fulfillment.
"Baseball is an individual
sport. I like to hit the ball and
it's just me against the
pitcher," Reynolds said.
"Football is pure team. I do like
the team aspect though. You
can develop a lot of friendships
from working together;
friendships that will last."

The Cards are smiling about the return of Larry Reynolds (above),
who joined the team two weeks ago. Reynolds started in the Stanford
secondary his freshman and sophomore years, but sat out most of last
season with a back injury. Defensive coordinator Norb Hecker calls
Reynolds "an outstanding pass defender."
