# The
						striped shirt speaks up
## One man's way to spend a Saturday afternoon 
### CHRIS HAFT 
College football rosters often
consist of 70 men or more. Each
squad is directed by nearly a
dozen coaches. Games are
watched by tens of thousands of
fans. These people are significant
in their own way, but when the
game begins, their fortunes and
feelings are determined by the
six men on the field wearing
black-and-white striped shirts—
the officials.
As today's referee, John Pre
sley of Spokane, Wash, is the
most important member of the

officiating sextet. Essentially, he
is the man in charge of the game.
A referee's immediate duty is
to call fouls occurring in the of
fensive backfield. Yet whenever
two other officials interpret a
certain play differently, it is the
referee's responsibility to re
solve the conflict.
"You say to yourself, AMio
was in the most advantageous
spot to make the call?' " Presley
explained. "As referee, you must
make the final decision."
Judgment calls, obviously
enough, cause the most diffi
culty. Presley stated, "For the re
feree, the toughest call is rough
ing the kicker. Another hard one
is intentional grounding. Pass in
terference is always difficult for
the back and field judges."
Minutiae such as determining
whether or not a player stepped
out of bounds, stopping the clock
and marking the position of the
ball, not to mention the major
chore of calling penalties, de
mand excessive concentration
from the officials. "Before each
play," Presley said, "every offi
cial probably goes through his
own little routine to remind him
self what to do."

Good officials generally are
not bothered by external factors
that might impede their perfor
mance. For example, Presley
claimed that crowd size is no
problem.
He did allow that weather is a
big factor. Officials, like
coaches, must consider weather
and the resulting field conditions
in doing their job.
The game's importance defi
nitely affects the officials, said
Presley. "The more important
the game, the easier it is to work.
In the case of a big game, all the

players know it's important, so
they try to not affect the game
negatively by committing penal
ties."
Presley went on to give his ver
sion of the "ideal game" in
which to work. "It would be
low-scoring, have no fouls and
would include a lot of thrills."
Whereas low-scoring games
might not be interesting for the
fans, they are better for the offi
cials, he added. "The tempo in
low-scoring games is a little fas
ter, there are no problems with
stopping the clock, and players
don't get too wild."
Officiating is by no means a
full-time occupation. No
Pacific-10 official could live on
the $250 he receives for each
game.
Rather, Presley said, it is a un
ique and pleasant avocation.
"Most people officiate for the
fun they get out of it. Don't get
the wrong idea from the word
it's work, but it's a labor of
love."
Yet it behooves all officials to
stay in good physical shape at all
times. Presley called it a year
round obligation.
"The Pac-10 supervisor of of
ficials (Jack Sprenger) is a physi

cal nut," Presley said. "We have
an annual clinic in Palo Alto, and
if you come there a little paun
chy, he makes very snide re
marks. He keeps everybody

physically conscious."
"The perfect official," said
Presley, "would be highly un
emotional. He should hustle
constantly, but should not go too
fast."
Surprisingly, Presley claimed
that there is no difference in
quality between rookie and vete
ran officials. "I've worked with
men doing their first game who
performed just as well as the ex
perienced guys," he said.
Objectivity remains the most
paramount trait of a good offi
cial. Presley remembers this
whenever he steps on the field.
"I just block a lot of things out of
my mind," he explained. "I
never think about which team
was supposed to win the game.
I've got a job to do, and if I see a
foul, I throw a flag.
"You must be objective, or
you won't be a good ref," he ad
ded. "And you can't get to the
college level unless you're
good."
Presley prefers to confront
players who don't like one of his
calls. "I give them a father-and
son talk," he said. "Basically, I
tell them, 'Knock it off,' and usu
ally they will. If somebody comp
lains more, I ask him if he's
rather sit on the bench than play.
They often settle down after
that."
Occasionally, Presley said,
something happens to relieve the
tension. One such occurrence
took place in the 1974
Stanford-UCLA game.
On a third-down situation in
the second quarter, the Bruins
appeared close to a first down.
Presley asked Stanford defensive
captain Drew Palin, "You can
have a measurement, but if you
refuse it, I'm going to call a first
down."
Palin requested a measure
ment, and the nose of the ball
just barely exceeded the marking
stick. "It would take the eyes of
an eagle to call that one," Presley
remarked to Palin.

Later in the game the same
situation arose, and Presley gave
Palin the same option. "No, I
don't want a measurement," said
Palin. "You've got the eyes of an
eagle."
Another experience Presley
recalls is working the 1971 Rose
Bowl, in which Stanford de
feated Ohio State 27-17. It was
hig biggest thrill as an official,
because, he said, "In collegiate
football, there's no place higher
to go than the Rose Bowl."
It is often speculated that offi
cials "protect" star players by
preventing them from receiving
late hits or experiencing an
undue amount of contact.
Presley, for his part, shuns this
practice. "In fact," he related, "I
have been accused by several
coaches of not protecting
players."
The truly outstanding athletes,
Presley emphasized, do not ex
pect any favors. "Real stars don't
say anything; they just get up and
do it again. O.J. Simpson never
once screamed in the two years I
saw him, and all other good
ballplayers are the same way."
John Underwood's three-part
series in Sports Illustrated and
the Darryl Stingley tragedy have
awakened concern over brutal
ity in football. The officials, who
enforce the rules during the
game, obviously bear much of
the responsibility for curbing
gridiron violence.
Presley is aware of this, and
notes an improvement in 1978
over past years.
"This season I've had three
Saturdays of football with six dif
ferent teams, and I'm happy to
say that the play has been
exemplary," he said. "Players
have been outstanding in their
conduct— I've had no bad
mouthing and no late hits in the
games I've worked."
A boy's love for the game and a
man's sense of discipline— those
are the qualities that officials
bring to college football.
