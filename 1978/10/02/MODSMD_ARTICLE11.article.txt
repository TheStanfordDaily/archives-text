## David Steuer Gun control needed 
### 
The tragic death of California Angels outfiel
der Lyman Bostock is yet another testament to
the insanity of a society which refuses to commit
itself to the control of lethal weapons.
There is a gun lobby in this country, powerful
and often reactionary, which has an almost
neurotic obsession with the retention of
firearms. An example of the irrationality so pre
valent among gun proponents was given by Sen.
John Stennis who argued against gun control
even after being shot in the street.
Bostock's death is clearly the result of a gun
placed in the hands of the wrong person at the
wrong time. In a moment of passion, Bostock s
alleged assailant, Leonard Smith, fired a shot
gun blast through a closed car window. The gun
lobby's chant, "guns don't kill; people do,"
rings hollow here. Certainly a knife could not
have been thrown through the window. Only
the availability of a gun allowed the alleged
murder to occur.
Guns are the tools of crime. They make vio
lent crime possible and infinitely simpler. For
example, in 1975, over 12,000 people were mur
dered by guns, representing approximately
two-thirds of all murders. Of course, guns are
used for crimes other than murder; they are
routinely used in assaults, rape, and robbery.
The majority of gun deaths are inflicted by
people who know their victims personally.
These crimes are acts of passion which without a
gun would probably not end in death. The re
cord of gun use in this country does not support
the contention that guns, when used, are used
for necessary self defense. Granted, guns may
be held for the intended purpose of self de
fense, but in practice they are not used legiti
mately, except by hunters and sportsmen.
Even when not used in crime, guns can yet

yield death. In 1970, over 2,000 people died as a
result of firearms accidents.
Another gun lobby slogan to deal with is out
law guns and only outlaws will have guns. Well,
outlaws already have guns, and you would be
fooling yourself in an unhealthy way if you be
lieved that your gun was faster than theirs. Basi
cally honest people carry guns which cause
tragedy because of emotional crises. Further
more, if only outlaws had guns, we would know
who the outlaws are, and could get them out of
society.
The constitutional argument against gun con
trol does not appear solidly based. The second
amendment is speaking of "the right to bear
arms" in the context of the right to a national
militia. The framers of the Constitution were not
trying to combat gun control, although this may
be a factor of their inability to foresee gun con
trol as a political issue.
In any case, should the second amendment
actually forbid gun control, which is doubtful,
then it should be repealed or rewritten. This
might be considered heretical, but as a society
we can no longer tolerate an armed citizenry.
The nations of Europe and Japan have instituted
rigorous policies of gun control, resulting in
violent crime rates which are a tiny fraction of
ours. It's no coincidence. If gun control means
taking the guns aw-y from murderers then it's
well worth the surrender of weapons by respon
sible citizens as well.
A prudent gun control policy would call for
the banning of all pistols and shotguns, with all
rifles registered through a national hunting club
which would be the sole source of ammunition.
To make a violent society less violent, it is im
perative to remove the tools of violence.
