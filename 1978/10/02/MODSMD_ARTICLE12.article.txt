Consider Cambodia
I am writing to suggest that
the time has come for the Stan
ford community to begin tak
ing some kind of systematic in
terest in Cambodia, and in the
unprecedented genocide and
ethnocide that is occurring
there.
The present regime of Pol
Pot has abolished cities, and
forcibly moved people into an
utterly controlled, dawn-to
dusk agricultural regime. It has
also abolished the use of
money, thus making under
ground resistance extremely
difficult. And it has
criminalized all religion —
even minor rituals of worship
area capital offense — thus ex
terminating a gentle and civiliz
ing Theravada Buddhism.
Estimates of outright exter
mination of supposed or real
resisters (not counting those
who have simply given up liv
ing out of sheer hopelessness)
run to and beyond one million
Cambodians out of a total of
some seven million. Translated
into American terms, this

would be something like
executing every last human
being in California, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Nevada,
and Arizona — all for the
cause of course. Whether the
true figure is one million or
one-half million is irrelevant.
What is important is that ways
be found to outlaw this sort of
genocide and ethnocide from
the face of the earth.
While the U.S. government
as such cannot do much about
all this, because of its recent
role in helping to destroy the
sociopolitical fabric of Cam
bodia, individuals or groups at
places like Stanford certainly
can make themselves heard.
There is some hope that the
government of China — the
only foreign government with
real influence in Phnom Penh
— can somehow be induced to
perform a constructive role. In
any case, some attention to
Cambodia is appropriate at a
world university such as ours.

Sooner or later it is certain
we will be hit by the big ear
thquake experts have been
predicting for this region — it
won't always stay away in Santa
Barbara or Los Angeles. It
would be folly not to prepare
for it better.
For example: Stanford
should appoint a Defense
Coordinator; a sheet of in
structions should be issued;
first aid and fire-fighting aids
should be located around
campus; a hot-line to the Ear
thquake Center in Menlo Park
could give us a little advance
warning relayed to our fire de
partment which could give
some prearranged public sig
nal.
Maybe these things are al
ready being done or con
templated but I haven't heard.

Pot has abolished cities, and
forcibly moved people into an
utterly controlled, dawn-to
dusk agricultural regime. It has
also abolished the use of
money, thus making under
ground resistance extremely
difficult. And it has
criminalized all religion —
even minor rituals of worship
area capital offense — thus ex
terminating a gentle and civiliz
ing Theravada Buddhism.
Estimates of outright exter
mination of supposed or real
resisters (not counting those
who have simply given up liv
ing out of sheer hopelessness)
run to and beyond one million
Cambodians out of a total of
some seven million. Translated
into American terms, this

would be something like
executing every last human
being in California, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Nevada,
and Arizona — all for the
cause of course. Whether the
true figure is one million or
one-half million is irrelevant.
What is important is that ways
be found to outlaw this sort of
genocide and ethnocide from
the face of the earth.
While the U.S. government
as such cannot do much about
all this, because of its recent
role in helping to destroy the
sociopolitical fabric of Cam
bodia, individuals or groups at
places like Stanford certainly
can make themselves heard.
There is some hope that the
government of China — the
only foreign government with
real influence in Phnom Penh
— can somehow be induced to
perform a constructive role. In
any case, some attention to
Cambodia is appropriate at a
world university such as ours.

Earthquake
preparation
Sooner or later it is certain
we will be hit by the big ear
thquake experts have been
predicting for this region — it
won't always stay away in Santa
Barbara or Los Angeles. It
would be folly not to prepare
for it better.
For example: Stanford
should appoint a Defense
Coordinator; a sheet of in
structions should be issued;
first aid and fire-fighting aids
should be located around
campus; a hot-line to the Ear
thquake Center in Menlo Park
could give us a little advance
warning relayed to our fire de
partment which could give
some prearranged public sig
nal.
Maybe these things are al
ready being done or con
templated but I haven't heard.
