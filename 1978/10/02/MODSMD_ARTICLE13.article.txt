## SCOPE teaches awareness 
### 
Stanford students are
supposed to be among the
best informed people in the
country in terms of political
issues and current events.
Are you "politically aware"?
The Stanford Committee On
Political Education (SCOPE)
would like to challenge you
with the following short
quiz. The questions don't
require any special know
ledge, beyond an occasional
reading of a newspaper or
newsweekly or a basic un
derstanding of current
domestic and international
affairs. Please take a few mi
nutes to test yourself. You
don't even have to obey the
Honor Code. . .
1. What is the difference
between a Public Law and a
Private Law?
2. What did the 25th
Amendment give to Stanford
students?
3. Why did Congress re
cently hold hearings in con
nection with the Stanford
Daily?
4. Who is most likely to
succeed Thomas P. O'Neill
at his job?
5. What was the first prim
ary that Jimmy Carter won in
1976?
6. Who finished second to
Carter in the 1976 conven
tion?
7. Who does Howard Jarvis
represent?
8. What does Myron
Farber knowabout curare
that he won't tell a New Jer
sey judge?
9. Jack Kemp is best known
for: A. His ideas about capi
tal gains, B. His ideas about
income taxes, C. His candi
dacy for President in 1980, D.
The forward pass.
10. Why did Bobby Baker
go to jail?
11. True or False: The
Neutron Bomb will destroy

people but not buildings.
12. Who does Yassir Arafat
rely upon to pay the rent?
13. What happened in
"Black September" of 1971?
14. Who is Joshua Nkomo
and what does he want?
15. How many people do
Western observers think
were killed in Cambodia last
year? (To the nearest mill
ion.)
16. What is the percentage
of the white population in
South Africa: five percent, 15
percent or 25 percent?
17. Why did the U.S. Con
gress originally vote to put
an embargo on U.S. arms
shipments to Turkey? (Was it
effective?)
18. Who is Frank Snepp?
Why won't a federal judge let
him collect the royalties
from his latest book?
19. Name three dissidents
who were thrown into Soviet
jails this summer.
20. What is the importance
of a "political education"?
The members of SCOPE
hope that by the end of the
year we will have sponsored
programs that explore the is
sues that this list has touched
upon.
In the past, we have
brought speakers to Stan
ford who are not only ex
perts on domestic and inter
national affairs, but who play
direct roles in influencing
current events. A partial list
includes: columnist David
Broder, U.N. Human Rights
Ambassador, Allard K. Low
enstein, editor Ben Bradlee,
Senator Frank Church,
Senator John Tunney,
Senator Lowell Weicker,
Rep. Pete McCloskey and
David Harris.
SCOPE conducted a voter
registration drive in the last
presidential election and the

poll of Stanford students that
we initited was reported by
Time magazine as an indi
cator of student opinion on
the candidates and issues.
In addition, we have
brought a number of politi
cal films to Stanford, which
we feel help illustrate an is
sue, beyond the power of a
speaker's voice or an ac
count in a book. Among
them have been: Hearts and
Minds, The Candidate, Z
and All The President's Men.
SCOPE was originally
formed by a few students
who felt that for a university
of Stanford's stature and
reputation, far too few polit
ical leaders and analysts ever
were given a chance to ex
press themselves before the
Stanford student body.
The membership of
SCOPE still believes that this
goal has yet to be achieved.
Now, because of the fee as
sessment we were voted by
the student body last spring,
we feel an additional obliga
tion to bring quality speakers
and programs to Stanford.
SCOPE has always made it
possible for students with an
idea for a program to join the
organization and try to bring
that idea to life. To that end,
new members are always
welcome. If you are in
terested, contact any
member of SCOPE or look
for announcements of
SCOPE meetings in Once
Around the Quad.
And if you want to know
the answers to any of the
questions on our quiz (or
argue about interpreta
tions), please feel free to
"grill" the membership of
SCOPE at our first meeting.

ing in political science, is

The members of SCOPE
hope that by the end of the
year we will have sponsored
programs that explore the is
sues that this list has touched
upon.
In the past, we have
brought speakers to Stan
ford who are not only ex
perts on domestic and inter
national affairs, but who play
direct roles in influencing
current events. A partial list
includes: columnist David
Broder, U.N. Human Rights
Ambassador, Allard K. Low
enstein, editor Ben Bradlee,
Senator Frank Church,
Senator John Tunney,
Senator Lowell Weicker,
Rep. Pete McCloskey and
David Harris.
SCOPE conducted a voter
registration drive in the last
presidential election and the

poll of Stanford students that
we initited was reported by
Time magazine as an indi
cator of student opinion on
the candidates and issues.
In addition, we have
brought a number of politi
cal films to Stanford, which
we feel help illustrate an is
sue, beyond the power of a
speaker's voice or an ac
count in a book. Among
them have been: Hearts and
Minds, The Candidate, Z
and All The President's Men.
SCOPE was originally
formed by a few students
who felt that for a university
of Stanford's stature and
reputation, far too few polit
ical leaders and analysts ever
were given a chance to ex
press themselves before the
Stanford student body.
The membership of
SCOPE still believes that this
goal has yet to be achieved.
Now, because of the fee as
sessment we were voted by
the student body last spring,
we feel an additional obliga
tion to bring quality speakers
and programs to Stanford.
SCOPE has always made it
possible for students with an
idea for a program to join the
organization and try to bring
that idea to life. To that end,
new members are always
welcome. If you are in
terested, contact any
member of SCOPE or look
for announcements of
SCOPE meetings in Once
Around the Quad.
And if you want to know
the answers to any of the
questions on our quiz (or
argue about interpreta
tions), please feel free to
"grill" the membership of
SCOPE at our first meeting.

brought speakers to Stan
ford who are not only ex
perts on domestic and inter
national affairs, but who play
direct roles in influencing
current events. A partial list
includes: columnist David
Broder, U.N. Human Rights
Ambassador, Allard K. Low
enstein, editor Ben Bradlee,
Senator Frank Church,
Senator John Tunney,
Senator Lowell Weicker,
Rep. Pete McCloskey and
David Harris.
SCOPE conducted a voter
registration drive in the last
presidential election and the

poll of Stanford students that
we initited was reported by
Time magazine as an indi
cator of student opinion on
the candidates and issues.
In addition, we have
brought a number of politi
cal films to Stanford, which
we feel help illustrate an is
sue, beyond the power of a
speaker's voice or an ac
count in a book. Among
them have been: Hearts and
Minds, The Candidate, Z
and All The President's Men.
SCOPE was originally
formed by a few students
who felt that for a university
of Stanford's stature and
reputation, far too few polit
ical leaders and analysts ever
were given a chance to ex
press themselves before the
Stanford student body.
The membership of
SCOPE still believes that this
goal has yet to be achieved.
Now, because of the fee as
sessment we were voted by
the student body last spring,
we feel an additional obliga
tion to bring quality speakers
and programs to Stanford.
SCOPE has always made it
possible for students with an
idea for a program to join the
organization and try to bring
that idea to life. To that end,
new members are always
welcome. If you are in
terested, contact any
member of SCOPE or look
for announcements of
SCOPE meetings in Once
Around the Quad.
And if you want to know
the answers to any of the
questions on our quiz (or
argue about interpreta
tions), please feel free to
"grill" the membership of
SCOPE at our first meeting.

ing in political science, is
co-director of SCOPE.)
