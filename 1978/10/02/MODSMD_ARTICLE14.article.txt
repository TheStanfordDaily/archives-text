## Time to accept the challenge 
### 
Charles Elliot, a past president of Har
vard University, was once visiting with a
small group of his fellow educators at a
dinner in his honor, and one of his com
rades offered the following compliment.
"Permit me to congratulate you on the
miracles you have performed at the uni
versity," remarked the admiring profes.
sor. "Since you became president, Har
vard has become a storehouse of know
ledge."
"That is true," laughed Elliot, "but I
scarcely deserve credit forthat. It is simply
that the freshmen bring so much know
ledge in, while the seniors take so little
out."
In his own satirical way, Elliot brought to
surface a realism that was in no way con
fined to the University student of Elliot's
era, for so often Stanford Univeristy seems
to have the unfortunate capability to breed
this sort of unnecessary deterioration of
varied human interest. In a nutshell, what
happens is that a student who excelled in
many areas during high school is very
often subjected to a large amount of pre
orientation "do's and don'ts" of college
life.
The incoming freshman is forewarned
about "pressure that he's never had to
handle before," "classes far too hard to
make an acceptable grade in," or "profes
sors who >pend so much time garbling
easy information that they preclude any
real learning." The obvious result is that
students who were, to some extent, al
ready used to bearing a heavy course load
while still living an active extra-curricular
life suddenly experience a heavy reduc
tion in confidenceand begin tofearall that
this campus has to offer, rather than utiliz
ing its opportunities..
Any student who is admitted to Stanford
must have already exhibited the confi
dence to accept the difficult curriculum
offered, but more importantly, he must
also have demonstrated a certain degree
of excellence in non-academic endeavors

which he can explore and share with his
fellow students. Living solely an academic
life on this campus is comparable to living
the life of the seagull who once told the
adventurous Jonathan Livingston Seagull
that he was content to "get-by" with a life
of continual head-to-head competition in
the rough, competitive life of an ordinary
gull.
What we need to do is follow the exam
ple of the adventurous Jonathan, who
began to take notice of the many oppor
tunities awaiting him. All of these oppor
tunities remained in his own sphere of
existence. In the same fashion, students at
Stanford need not be frightened by
pseudo-realistic worries which abound in
freshmen dorms during the first nights of
orientation. Here, within our own "sphere
of existence," lies a myriad of stepping
stones to opportunities and fulfillment
found in university life apart from the
academic angle.
One look at "Once Around the Quad"
in the Daily, a five minute gaze at a nearby
bulletin board, or a quick walk through
Tresidder or Old Union is enough to open
anyone's eyes to the realization that for
perhaps the only time in our lives, we are
able to satiate our finicky tastes in hobbies
or interests with little or no effort. We can
experience new challenges with "no
strings attached," and perhaps we have
the opportunity to open that one "new
door" to an experience which we might
never have had before.
Fortunately, the majority of these prog
rams are set up in such a way that they
conform to a rigorous academic schedule,
and offer a unique "escape" from the
woes of blue books, typewriters and
notepads. Many offer ideas or counseling
on how to better cope with such daily
anathemas, many simply offer relaxation
or entertainment, but they all have the in
herent capability of broadening talents,
knowledge, and enjoyment.. To forego
these opportunities in favor of a uniform

academic four-year college career is an af
front to whomever must eventually pay
the high quarterly bills.
The sponsors of these organizations
have made a highly commendable effort to
reveal the existence of these options to
every student, and it is now time to accept
the challenge of our admission to Stan
ford, to reach out beyond the limitation of
academics, and to take full advantage of
what we have before us.
Like a young child on his very first trip to
the neighborhood candy store, we have
the chance to gaze at what lies all around
us and choose that which best satisfies our
interests. It is time to leave to history the
college student of Charles Elliot's day, and
instead join in pushing our confidence
and abilities to their limits in the hope of
attaining "true satisfaction." At Stanford,
our universe is an endless sphere.
