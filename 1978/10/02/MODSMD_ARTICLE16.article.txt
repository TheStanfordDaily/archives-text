## Exchange is sign of revisionism 
### 
This quarter, Stanford University will host some students from
the People's Republic of China. The mere fact that these are the
first students ever sent to the U.S. from such a large Communist
country which was closed off from the West for nearly a quarter
century is itself worth noting. But the really interesting questions
are — why now and why Stanford?
A few years ago this would have given Americans on campus an
exciting opportunity to learn about China and the tremendous
advances being made under the rule of the working class. But in
those times, China would never have sent students to Stanford.
In fact, the new revisionists who have seized power in China are
themselves eager to learn from the capitalist West and this is why
they are planning to send hundreds of students to the U.S. this
year.
When Mao Tse-tung, the late chairman of the Chinese Com
munist Party, was still alive, the Chinese lambasted U.S. aggres
sion in Indochina, the vicious oppression of blacks and other
minorities in the U.S. and said, "It's right to rebel against reac
tionaries,"calling on the people of the world to fight for revolution
and against imperialism. The Chinese Revolution itself, especially
the Cultural Revolution, was put forward as an example for all
mankind. *
During the Cultural Revolution, Chinese education in particu
lar made a clean break with the practice of educating only
the"best and brightest" — the children whose relatively
privileged backgrounds made it possible for them to rate highest
on the Chinese version of the SAT. Instead, during theCultural
Revolution, the universities were radically changed by the stu
dents and the workers. Students began to be admitted on the
basis of how much good their education would do for the people.
For example, the workers and peasants in a factory or on a
commune would pick someone from among them to be trained
gtthe university — someone who not only had interest and ability
but most importantly, someone with political consciousness who
would use what they learned to benefit the working people.
Mao called this "putting proletarian politics in command" and
consciously used it to prevent the formation of an intellectual
elite. So why is the new regime in Peking, starting with six science
students, sending "the cream of the crop" to Stanford? They say
they want to pick up advanced techniques in science, social
sciences, and management. What better campus to learn from
than the home of the Stanford Research Institute which was so
rightfully attacked during the anti-war movement for its role in
war research; the home of the Stanford School of Business whose
advanced management techniques help capitalists all over the
world in their desperate attempts to make workers their obedient
— and productive — slaves?
Chairman Hua — who has recently been picking up some good
tips from the Shah of Iran — indeed has much to learn from all
this. Vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping, who has proclaimed that "all
workers must not leave their production posts," will find that
Stanford's "advanced" management techniques are just the tic
ket. In fact, the well-known Stanford dictum "Study, Work Hard,
Get Rich" has already replaced "Serve the People" as the watch

word of China's new leadership.
But China's new rulers are walking a very thin rope. Those who
would "revise" Mao Tse-tung's thought will not only face the
wrath of the "lowly" Chinese workers and peasants they are
exploiting, but also the indignation of the Chinese intellectuals as
they increasingly realize what role they are being forced to play.
Unlike the University heads who are gloating over the fact that
China's new leadership has come over to their way of thinking,
we revolutionary students will build off the advances of Socialist
China under Mao's leadership and carry on the fight for the day
when there is no exploitation and oppression in society — in
China, America and the whole world.
