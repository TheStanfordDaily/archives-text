# Late TDs lift Cards to rerun victory, 17-14
## Nelson, Margerum star as Stanford repeats win over Tulane 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
With a script stolen from last
year's game in the Louisiana
Superdome, Stanford scored
two touchdowns in the fourth
quarter Saturday to overcome
an 11-point third-ouarter de
ficit and quell tne upset
minded Tulane Green Wave.
The setting changed to Stan
ford Stadium for the produc
tion of Stanford-Tulane 11, but
no one bothered to rewrite the
story.
As was last year, the Cardi
nals, now 3-1, fell behind
lightly regarded Tulane 14-3 in
the first half before rescuing
fair-heart Victory from the
clutches of the dastardly Green
Wave, the villainous foe who
was deadly intent on taking her
back to the bayous.
While Tulane had the same
actors as last year in the princi
pal roles, sophomores Darrin
Nelson and Ken Margerum
starred in the leads for the
white-helmeted good guys.
Nelson rushed for 200 yards
on 17 carries, including a 22-
yard burst over the right side
which gave Stanford its first TD
early in the fourth quarter.
Margerum defied Newtonian
physics to snag a 22-yard pass
from Steve Dils with little more
than 7Va minutes left to save
Victory from pending doom.
Everyone knows how the
first half goes. The local heroes
play well but just can't get the
ball in the end zone. They rol
led to 215 yards total offense in
the first half but have only a
41-yard Ken Naber field goal to
show for their effort.
Lapses of concentration, an
interception in the end zone
and breakdowns in pass pro
tection all stymied the Stanford
offense in the first half.
The defense, meanwhile,
was having trouble with two
old foes — quarterback Roch
Hontas and tailback Marv
Christian. The pair nearly
proved the undoing of the
Cards last year. And they
would have undone Stanford
this year if the Cardinals had
not stopped the Wave twice at
the Stanford one-yard line in
the first quarter.
In the second quarterTulane
bent the Card defense to the
breaking point as the Wave
crashed through the Cards,

running a sprint draw in which
Hontas rolled out and then
handed off to Christian.
The delay provided the
5-foot-H, 198-pound senior
with ample time to read the
holes in the Stanford defense.
Midway through the second
quarter, Christian plunged
over the left side of the line
from two yards out to give the
Wave a 7-3 lead. The score
caused an eruption from the
Tulane supporters — both of
them.
With less than a minute re
maining in the first half Hontas
flipped a screen pass out to
Christian on the right flat and
he proceeded to ramble 55
yards through the Stanford de
fense for a TD.
"The screen passes were
ridiculous," Stanford defen
sive tackle Dean Wilson said.
"Our first half tackling was
atrocious," linebacker Milt
McColl said. "We must have

missed 10 tackles on that
touchdown (the screen to
Christian). Everyone had a shot
at him."
Taxed by intense heat and a
long first quarter, several Stan
ford defensive players hyper
ventilated before halftime.
In the second half the brea
thing problems all belonged to
Tulane as the Stanford defense
suffocated the Green Wave,
limiting the visitors to just 67
yards total offense.
The defense, led by inside
linebackers Gordy Ceresino
with 22 tackles and Steve
Budinger with 21, went about
its job and waited patiently for
the offense. On the first play of
the fourth quarter, Stanford
fullback Phil Francis ran
through the middle of the line,
broke free and churned 16
yards before being stopped at
the 7-yard line. On the next
play Francis burst through the
right side for an apparent

touchdown.
With the Band blaring All
Right Now and the sidelines
exploding in joyous uproar,
the yellow handkerchief on the
left side of the field nearly went
unnoticed. An official called
holding on tight end Marty
Smith. Instead of 14-10, it was
14-3 with first and goal from the
22.
Dils pitched to Nelson on a
sweep, guard Jim Stephens
executed a key block, and the
brilliant sophomore halfback
was spinning through the
Tulane defense into the end
zone.
"It's a whole lot of fun to
block for Darrin," Stephens
said. "If our blocking can get
him past the line of scrimmage,
few players can tackle him
one-on-one once he gets into
the secondary."
"The running play we used
today was devised by Paul

Nelson rushed for 200 yards on 17 carries. It was only the third time a Stanford runner has readied the
two-century mark in one game. Nelson has one of the other two 200-yard games, a 211-yard effort
against San Jose State last year.
