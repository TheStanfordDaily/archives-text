# Pope's death mourned by thousands in pouring rain

Vatican City (AP) — Tens of
thousands of mourners braving a
driving rain yesterday filed solemnly
through St. Peter's Square to view
the body of Pope John Paul I in a
massive outpouring of affection for
the "smiling pontiff."
Cardinals arriving from around the
world for Wednesday's funeral and
the conclave to elect a new pope that
begins Oct. 14, made clear they will
be seeking a man with the same pas
toral background and down-to-earth
traits that endeared Pope John Paul
to millions even though he reigned a
mere 34 days.
Cardinal Humberto Medeiros of
Boston said Pope John Paul, who
died of a heart attack last Thursday at
age 65, had quickly "won the hearts
of men and was very valuable to the
church."
Long lines of mourners formed at
dawn for the opening of St. Peter's
Basilica at 7 a.m. Seven abreast, they
stood patiently in line through the
day, with upwards of an hour's wait,
a river of umbrellas stretching a
half-mile under the colonnades of
the great piazza.
Brother views
Among the first to view the body
was the pope's brother, Edoardo Lu
ciani, 62, who had been in Australia
on a business trip when the pontiff
was stricken.
The Congregation of Cardinals,
running the 700-million-member
church in the period between popes,
took yesterday off and will meet
again today. It has scheduled an
open-air funeral on the steps of St.
Peter's, the site of John Paul's instal
lation as 263 rd pontiff just four weeks
ago and of the funeral of Pope Paul VI
three weeks before.
Workmen have begun preparing a
marble sarcophagus opposite Pope
Paul Vl's tomb in the basilica's grot
toes. Pope Paul was buried "in the
simple earth," according to his
stated wishes.
Pope John Paul in his 34-day pon
tificate apparently drew up no such
detailed instructions on how he
wanted to be buried, and the deci
sion thus fell on the Vatican.
Testament written
However, Vatican Radio reported
he may have written a testament,
even if only notes scribbled in a
book. It said the pontiff had told his

two secretaries his brother had been
enthusiastic about Pope Paul's tes
tament, but that he, John Paul, plan
ned to write a shorter one —14 or 15
lines.
Since the papal apartments are sea
led and put under watch by the Swiss
Guards immediately upon the death
of a pope, the existence of any such
testament may not be known until a
new pope is elected.
Most widely mentioned "papa
bili," or possible popes, are those
with the basic characteristics that
brought an overwhelming vote to
Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice in
his election as Pope John Paul.
Five Italian cardinals with pastoral
experience rather than a bureaucra

tic background in the Roman
Catholic curia are regarded as top
prospects in the guessing game of
who will be the next pope.
Pastoral pope
"If the cardinal electors wanted a
pastoral pope from Italy only five
weeks ago, there should be no
reason for them to change in such a
short time," a Vatican expert com
mented.
However, observers also
cautioned that papal elections often
are unpredictable, as was shown in
the surprise and speedy election of
Cardinal Albino Luciani, the patriach
of Venice, as Pope John Paul I on the
first day of voting Aug. 26.
