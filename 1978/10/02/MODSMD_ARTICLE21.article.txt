# Cal, Stanford share Nor Cal title
## Card poloists battle to draw 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
The football game had just ended Satur
day when the deciding contest of the Nor-
Cal Invitational water polo tournament be
tween California and Pepperdine began at
deGuerre pool.
That morning, Stanford had beaten
Pepperdine 14-10 and tied Cal 10-10 in the
finals, so if Cal could beat the Waves by
more than four goals, the Bears would
break the tie with the Cards, claiming the
tournament title for themselves.
Final score: Cal 14, Pepperdine 10. Stan
ford and Cal remained tied for first with
identical 3-0-1 records in the tournament.
The unpredictable tournament began
Friday. The Cards opened by embarrassing
a helpless UC-Santa Barbara team, 14-4.
Senior Tom Angelo, junior Randy Kal
bus, sophomore Bill Taylor and freshmen
Jody Campbell and Alan Mouchawar all
scored two goals in the game to provide a
balanced attack. The Cards jumped out to
a 5-0 first quarter lead, stretching it to 8-1
by halftime as the defense completely shut
the Cauchos down.
"We had them pegged," said Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti. "We knew

exactly what they were going to do. Our
defense was just super."
Never was that more evident than in the
third quarter when sophomore goalie
John Cansel stopped three close-range
Caucho shots in three seconds.
"We're starting to get it together," said
Dettamanti.
After dispensing with the Cauchos,
Stanford continued its dominance by
crushing UC-Davis, 10-3. Campbell scored
three for the Cards and Doug Burke and
Steve Smith each scored two.
Against Pepperdine Saturday morning,
Campbell again scored three goals, giving
him eight for the tournament, to lead the
Cards victory over the Waves. Burke also
netted a hat trick for Stanford and Taylor,
Angelo and Robby Arnold each accounted
for two more apiece.
Then came Cal.
Like almost every Stanford-Cal water
polo matchup in recent history, the game
was close all the way. After a 2-2 first quar
ter score, Arnold scored on a fast break
halfway through the second period and
Mouchawar added two more before
halftime, resulting in a 5-3 Stanford lead.

The Bears, with help from two Mike
Loughlan goals, fought back to trail 8-7
going into the final period. Both of
Loughlan's goals came on man-up situa
tions for Cal, and Kevin Robertson added
another in that same quarter, also in a
6-on-5 situation.
Before 30 seconds had elapsed in the
fourth quarter, Arnold scored his second
goal of the game, giving Stanford a 9-7
lead. But two more 6-on-5 goals for Cal —
one by Loughlan and one by Robertson —
knotted the score. With a minute and a
half left, Kalbus gave the Cards a 10-9 ad
vantage with a driving pop shot.
Then, with one minute left, Stanford's
defense finally managed to hold off
another Cal 6-on-5 attempt, and things
looked bright for the Cards. However,
with six seconds left, another Stanford
kickout and a quick shot by the Bears'
Kevin Ward left the audience stunned at
the final outcome — Stanford 10, Cal 10.
"On the extra-man situation, we just did
not make a good adjustment," Dettamanti
said. "They kept going to the same guy
every time. It's the goalie's responsibility
to adjust to that, but he didn't."
