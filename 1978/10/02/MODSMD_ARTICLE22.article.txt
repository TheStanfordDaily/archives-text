The Stanford men's and women's cross-country teams were in
Fresno this weekend, battling not only some of the tougher
schools in the state, but rough weather conditions as well.
With the temperature close to 90 degrees, the men's team was
able to pull out a respectable third-place finish on the 10,000-
meter course, behind Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and Nevada-
Reno. The women didn't fair quite as well, however, and finished
fifth out of 12 schools.
"For our first meet of the season, I'm pleased with our condi
tioning and our work as a team," men's coach Dean Clark said.
Clark added that the team is looking forward to improving greatly
in the coming weeks.
"Because of the weather conditions and the fact that we've only
been training together for one week, it was a tough opener for
us," women's coach Laurel Treon said.
The men, running well as a group during the first 3000 meters of
the race, spread out later, with senior Roy Kissin the first Card to

cross the finish line. Kissin, who finished ninth, ran true to form
(he also finished ninth a year ago) in a time of 32:36.6. Freshman
Rod Berry finished second for the Cards and 13th with a time of
32:59. Sophomore Tom Lobsinger, primarily a middle distance
runner, finished 14th. The rest of the Card runners finishing in
overall order were freshmen Scott Slovic, 32nd; junior Craig
Corey, 49th, and senior Jerry Emory, 54th.
The men would have finished higher if Mitch Wasterlain, run
ning in 20th place, had not had to drop out with heat exhaustion
only 300 yards from the finish line.
Senior Ann Thrupp led the way for the Card women, placing
17th in the three-mile race with a time of 18:17.6. Freshman Susan
Bragdon finished 29th in a time of 19:13.4. The other top finishers
for the women were Annette Mungi, 44th; joanne Ernst, 52nd
and Kyle Chapman, 63rd.
The women run in Berkeley this weekend, while the men host
Humboldt State in a dual meet at the Stanford Golf Course Satur
day. Clark said, "Man for man we should be able to beat them."
