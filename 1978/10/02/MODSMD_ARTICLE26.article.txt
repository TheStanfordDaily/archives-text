# Booters win, 8-2
## Cards rip Stanislaus 
### DEAN EYRE 
Until Saturday, the Cardinal
soccer squad had just been
snacking with their opponents,
but when hosting Stanislaus
State, they got downright
"hungry," swallowing the
Warriors with an 8-2 win.
In the course of the
onslaught, both Dan McNevin
and Ted Rafalovich earned hat
tricks and second-string
players were freely substituted
in the second half.
Even though Stanford domi
nated the game, Stanislaus
drew first blood with a goal by
Dave Harrison 12 minutes into
the game.
"We were surprised that
they scored the first goal so
quickly on us, but we needed
thattoget us going," explained
Card head coach Nelson
Lodge. "Otherwise it could
have been 0-0. Sometimes this
team needs a kick in the pants
before it gets moving."
Senior forward Paul
Kozachenko attributed the
Warriors' early lead to "playing
too cautiously." Stanford
picked up momentum and
quickly took the lead on two
goals by Rafalovich, the first on
an assist by Peter Phillips and
the second coming on an indi
rect free kick.
Then it was McNevin's turn
for a pair of scores, the first
with an assist by Kozachenko
and Rafalovich. Rafalovich got
his hat trick with 38 seconds
remaining in the half, giving
the Cards a 5-1 lead.
McNevin earned his hat trick
five minutes into the second
half after getting a key pass

from Rafalovich. The two for
wards made their presence felt
and, combined with more fluid
teamwork to support them, are
proving invaluable to the of
fense.
"I think what was most im
portant is that they showed
their strengths working with
one another — it's obvious be
cause they both scored three
goals apiece," Lodge said.
"Also the fact that our wing
play was able to generate more
area for them to work with was
good. In the last game we
learned that our wings were
taking away the space for these
two strikers to work with. Now
they're staying wide and you
can see what's happening with
our attack," he added.
Rafalovich commented upon
the differences he saw in
Saturday's play. "It's the first
game where we kind of broke it
open — it's the best first half
we've had. I was going to the
goal much harder than I have
before. I got myself up for this
game much better. I was really
flat (before) — all these games I
really haven't put it together
until now," he said.
As for his three goals,
Rafalovich said, "I like it. I'm

especially trying to get hungry
as far as scoring. I want more of
them (hat tricks) and I think I'll
get some more."
Juan Ramirez scored the
Warriors' last goal almost half
way through the final period.
Stanford's final two goals were
tallied by freshmen. Mike Mul
cahy scored with an assist by
Hal Washburn with less than
five minutes to play. Washburn
got his chance for glory, put
ting in a shot with nine seconds
left, assisted by Mark Shore.
Assistant coach Phil Wright
was pleased to give the new
members of the team some
playing time. "Their (Stanis
laus') coach was very generous
and waived the rule of 18
players, allowing us to get this
groupof eight freshmen in.
Stanford, now 5-1, hosts San
Francisco State on Wednesday
at 3 p.m.
"They're going to be really
tough," Lodge said. "They beat
us last year in overtime 2-1 and
they've got most of the team
back. They have a new coach
who's really up on it and I think
it's going to be an exciting
game — I think 1-0 possibly;
hopefully it will be our 1-0."

the differences he saw in
Saturday's play. "It's the first
game where we kind of broke it
open — it's the best first half
we've had. I was going to the
goal much harder than I have
before. I got myself up for this
game much better. I was really
flat (before) — all these games I
really haven't put it together
until now," he said.
As for his three goals,
Rafalovich said, "I like it. I'm

especially trying to get hungry
as far as scoring. I want more of
them (hat tricks) and I think I'll
get some more."
Juan Ramirez scored the
Warriors' last goal almost half
way through the final period.
Stanford's final two goals were
tallied by freshmen. Mike Mul
cahy scored with an assist by
Hal Washburn with less than
five minutes to play. Washburn
got his chance for glory, put
ting in a shot with nine seconds
left, assisted by Mark Shore.
Assistant coach Phil Wright
was pleased to give the new
members of the team some
playing time. "Their (Stanis
laus') coach was very generous
and waived the rule of 18
players, allowing us to get this
groupof eight freshmen in.
Stanford, now 5-1, hosts San
Francisco State on Wednesday
at 3 p.m.
"They're going to be really
tough," Lodge said. "They beat
us last year in overtime 2-1 and
they've got most of the team
back. They have a new coach
who's really up on it and I think
it's going to be an exciting
game — I think 1-0 possibly;
hopefully it will be our 1-0."

Senior Robby Arnold looks for an opening in the goal before firing a shot in Stanford's 10-3 victory over
UC-Davis Friday in the NorCal Invitational. Stanford and California battled to a 10-10 tie Saturday and
shared the tournament crown.
Until Saturday, the Cardinal
soccer squad had just been
snacking with their opponents,
but when hosting Stanislaus
State, they got downright
"hungry," swallowing the
Warriors with an 8-2 win.
In the course of the
onslaught, both Dan McNevin
and Ted Rafalovich earned hat
tricks and second-string
players were freely substituted
in the second half.
Even though Stanford domi
nated the game, Stanislaus
drew first blood with a goal by
Dave Harrison 12 minutes into
the game.
"We were surprised that
they scored the first goal so
quickly on us, but we needed
thattoget us going," explained
Card head coach Nelson
Lodge. "Otherwise it could
have been 0-0. Sometimes this
team needs a kick in the pants
before it gets moving."
Senior forward Paul
Kozachenko attributed the
Warriors' early lead to "playing
too cautiously." Stanford
picked up momentum and
quickly took the lead on two
goals by Rafalovich, the first on
an assist by Peter Phillips and
the second coming on an indi
rect free kick.
Then it was McNevin's turn
for a pair of scores, the first
with an assist by Kozachenko
and Rafalovich. Rafalovich got
his hat trick with 38 seconds
remaining in the half, giving
the Cards a 5-1 lead.
McNevin earned his hat trick
five minutes into the second
half after getting a key pass

from Rafalovich. The two for
wards made their presence felt
and, combined with more fluid
teamwork to support them, are
proving invaluable to the of
fense.
"I think what was most im
portant is that they showed
their strengths working with
one another — it's obvious be
cause they both scored three
goals apiece," Lodge said.
"Also the fact that our wing
play was able to generate more
area for them to work with was
good. In the last game we
learned that our wings were
taking away the space for these
two strikers to work with. Now
they're staying wide and you
can see what's happening with
our attack," he added.
Rafalovich commented upon
the differences he saw in
Saturday's play. "It's the first
game where we kind of broke it
open — it's the best first half
