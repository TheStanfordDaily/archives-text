# Scotchers lose 1 in smog, tie 2
## 
### JULIE HILL 
Extremely smoggy condi
tions in Southern California
hampered play by the Stanford
field hockey team in three
matches at Cal Poly-Pomona
over the weekend as the Cards
lost one and tied two.
"It was like being in hell,"
Stanford coach Barbara
Longstreth said. "Southern
California is a pit."
The first match Friday saw
Stanford succumb to a much
improved Long Beach State
team, 3-1. Standout junior
Nancy White had so much
trouble seeing and breathing
that she was unable to return
for the second half, Longstreth
said.
The lone Stanford goal was
scored by Jessie Gerrard.
Longstreth said of the first
game, "We never played our

kind of hockey."
Saturday morning, still
forced to endure the smoggy
conditions, Stanford tied San
Diego State 1-1, with Paula
Mishima scoring for the Cards.
In that match, Longstreth
found the team "still struggling
to find its own style of play,"
and noted the absence of
domination on the field by
either the Aztecs or the Cards.
Stanford met host Cal Poly-
Pomona for its final match. Al
though Pomona was rested,
not having had a morning
match, it could only manage to
tie a determined Stanford
squad. The Cardinals, stricken
with fits of coughing and re
duced vision, came from be
hind to knot the game at 1-1.
Longstreth, proud of her
team's determination to play
enthusiastically the entire sec
ond game despite the smog,
said she believed the team
finished "on a good note." She
said she felt the women began
to cope with the environment,
worked together and upheld
their confidence while facing
an unexpected opponent in
the atmosphere.
The scotchers face San Jose
State Saturday at 10 a.m. on
Roble Field. The Spartans
finished last season ranked
fourth in the nation.
