# Mandatory evaluation for classes initiated
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Beginning this fall, students and
professors here will participate in a
new, sweeping plan to evaluate
every course on campus regularly.
In all classes with eight or more
enrolled, professors will be expected
to supply their students with evalua
tion forms at the end of the quarter.
There are several reasons for this
universal course evaluation plan, but
the primary goal is to improve teach
ing, said Education Prof. Robert Cal
fee, chairman of the Faculty Senate's
subcommittee on the Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching (SCEIT).
"Some people are natural
teachers, others must work at it,"he
said. Calfee, who is also assistant
dean of the school of education, said
he sees course evaluations as an im
portant part of a larger program to
improve teaching here.
Student feedback
Quarterly student feedback, along
with programs such as videotaping of
classes and visits by alumni and
emeriti, can help professors discover
their teaching strengths and weak
nesses, according to Calfee.
Other reasons for course evalua
tions include assisting departments
in tenure and salary decisions, and
providing "consumer information"
to students through the ASSU

Course Guide, Calfee said.
In May 1977, the Faculty Senate
approved a resolution calling for
"universal student evaluations of
teaching at Stanford." Last year, Cal
fee's subcommittee tested a pilot
evaluation program using the prop
osed forms in several classes.
The SCEIT report which will direct
the full-scale evaluation program this
fall, was approved by the senate last
May. After the program is "running
smoothly," the subcommittee will
make its final report, according to
Calfee.
Large-scale operation
The scale of the operation is much
greater than anything tried here be
fore, Calfee said. More than 40,000
forms will be collected each quarter.
The subcommittee expects that all of
the data will be analyzed by the regis
trar's office and the results returned
within four to six weeks after the end
of each quarter, he said.
The forms contain both quantita
tive and qualitative questions. The
quantitative section requires the
student to answer questions with a
numerical ranking, while the qualita
tive questions require a verbal exp
lanation or comment.
Answers to the quantitative ques
tions will be statistically analyzed and
the results will be given, along with
the original forms, to the instructors
and their department chairmen. This
information will also be released to
the ASSU Course Guide for publica
tion unless the instructor requests at
the beginning of the quarter that it be
withheld.
The Qualitative answers will be av
ailable to the instructors and the de
partment heads when they look over
the original forms. Because this in
formation is more sensitive, Calfee
said that it will not be released unless
the professor so requests.
Alternative systems allowed
While the committee has designed
a form it feels is applicable to most
classes, the program allows depart
ments or schools already using an
evaluation system to retain it. Calfee
said he was "surprised and pleased
with the quality of evaluation sys
tems we found (in various schools
within the University)."
For the evaluation program to be
effective it must be used by almost all
of the piofessors, according to Cal
fee. However, in certain cir
cumstances, information will only be
released to the instructor. These
situations include experimental
courses and those taught by first
year professors.
Calfee said it is important that
these types of courses are evaluated
but that in these situations the in
structor should also be protected
during a "time of risk."
Calfee said, "there has been in
credible support" of the evaluation
plan from the faculty and he expects
the program to be successful. But he
added that responsible student sup
port of course evaluations is equally
important.

The scale of the operation is much
greater than anything tried here be
fore, Calfee said. More than 40,000
forms will be collected each quarter.
The subcommittee expects that all of
the data will be analyzed by the regis
trar's office and the results returned
within four to six weeks after the end
of each quarter, he said.
The forms contain both quantita
tive and qualitative questions. The
quantitative section requires the
student to answer questions with a
numerical ranking, while the qualita
tive questions require a verbal exp
lanation or comment.
Answers to the quantitative ques
tions will be statistically analyzed and
the results will be given, along with
the original forms, to the instructors
and their department chairmen. This
information will also be released to
the ASSU Course Guide for publica
tion unless the instructor requests at
the beginning of the quarter that it be
withheld.
The Qualitative answers will be av
ailable to the instructors and the de
partment heads when they look over
the original forms. Because this in
formation is more sensitive, Calfee
said that it will not be released unless
the professor so requests.
Alternative systems allowed
While the committee has designed
a form it feels is applicable to most
classes, the program allows depart
ments or schools already using an
evaluation system to retain it. Calfee
said he was "surprised and pleased
with the quality of evaluation sys
tems we found (in various schools
within the University)."
For the evaluation program to be
effective it must be used by almost all
of the piofessors, according to Cal
fee. However, in certain cir
cumstances, information will only be
released to the instructor. These
situations include experimental
courses and those taught by first
year professors.
Calfee said it is important that
these types of courses are evaluated
but that in these situations the in
structor should also be protected
during a "time of risk."
Calfee said, "there has been in
credible support" of the evaluation
plan from the faculty and he expects
the program to be successful. But he
added that responsible student sup
port of course evaluations is equally
important.
Beginning this fall, students and
professors here will participate in a
new, sweeping plan to evaluate
every course on campus regularly.
In all classes with eight or more
enrolled, professors will be expected
to supply their students with evalua
tion forms at the end of the quarter.
There are several reasons for this
universal course evaluation plan, but
the primary goal is to improve teach
ing, said Education Prof. Robert Cal
fee, chairman of the Faculty Senate's
subcommittee on the Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching (SCEIT).
"Some people are natural
teachers, others must work at it,"he
said. Calfee, who is also assistant
dean of the school of education, said
he sees course evaluations as an im
portant part of a larger program to
improve teaching here.
Student feedback
Quarterly student feedback, along
with programs such as videotaping of
classes and visits by alumni and
emeriti, can help professors discover
their teaching strengths and weak
nesses, according to Calfee.
Other reasons for course evalua
tions include assisting departments
in tenure and salary decisions, and
providing "consumer information"
to students through the ASSU

Course Guide, Calfee said.
In May 1977, the Faculty Senate
approved a resolution calling for
"universal student evaluations of
teaching at Stanford." Last year, Cal
fee's subcommittee tested a pilot
evaluation program using the prop
osed forms in several classes.
The SCEIT report which will direct
the full-scale evaluation program this
fall, was approved by the senate last
May. After the program is "running
smoothly," the subcommittee will
make its final report, according to
Calfee.
Large-scale operation
The scale of the operation is much
greater than anything tried here be
fore, Calfee said. More than 40,000
forms will be collected each quarter.

the data will be analyzed by the regis
