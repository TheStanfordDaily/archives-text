# Mandatory evaluation for classes initiated
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Beginning this fall, students and
professors here will participate in a
new, sweeping plan to evaluate
every course on campus regularly.
In all classes with eight or more
enrolled, professors will be expected
to supply their students with evalua
tion forms at the end of the quarter.
There are several reasons for this
universal course evaluation plan, but
the primary goal is to improve teach
ing, said Education Prof. Robert Cal
fee, chairman of the Faculty Senate's
subcommittee on the Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching (SCEIT).
"Some people are natural
teachers, others must work at it,"he
said. Calfee, who is also assistant
dean of the school of education, said
he sees course evaluations as an im
portant part of a larger program to
improve teaching here.
Student feedback
Quarterly student feedback, along
with programs such as videotaping of
classes and visits by alumni and
emeriti, can help professors discover
their teaching strengths and weak
nesses, according to Calfee.
Other reasons for course evalua
tions include assisting departments
in tenure and salary decisions, and
providing "consumer information"
to students through the ASSU

Course Guide, Calfee said.
In May 1977, the Faculty Senate
approved a resolution calling for
"universal student evaluations of
teaching at Stanford." Last year, Cal
fee's subcommittee tested a pilot
evaluation program using the prop
osed forms in several classes.
The SCEIT report which will direct
the full-scale evaluation program this
fall, was approved by the senate last
May. After the program is "running
smoothly," the subcommittee will
make its final report, according to
Calfee.
Large-scale operation
The scale of the operation is much
greater than anything tried here be
fore, Calfee said. More than 40,000
forms will be collected each quarter.
The subcommittee expects that all of
the data will be analyzed by the regis
trar's office and the results returned
within four to six weeks after the end
of each quarter, he said.
The forms contain both quantita
tive and qualitative questions. The
quantitative section requires the
student to answer questions with a
numerical ranking, while the qualita
tive questions require a verbal exp
lanation or comment.
Answers to the quantitative ques
tions will be statistically analyzed and
the results will be given, along with
