# New buses may mean you'll have to walk
## New Gutenberg rules limit undergraduate use 
### BILL POWEL 
Last year the Gutenberg Express library
shuttle between Stanford and UC-Berkeley
was almost an alternate student transporta
tion route to the East Bay. A Stanford ID
practically guaranteed a seat on one of the
four daily trips between the two campuses in
an old 33-passenger bus.
But this year, there are new smaller buses
and new rules which eliminate under
graduate use. This has been done in an at
tempt to limit the service to patrons on lib
rary business, according to program offi
cials.
Ann Seeley, coordinator of the UC-
Berkeley/Stanford Research Library Prog
ram, said that under the new regulations
only faculty, academic personnel and
graduate students (for whom the shuttle
service was originated) with both a reserva
tion and a special identification card can use
the library shuttle.
New vans
The new limitations on passengers were
necessary because smaller 11-passenger

vans were bought to replace the less reliable
"Flexi-Buses." The older vehicles often
broke down and left passengers stranded on
both campuses, according to Seeley. She
said that to handle sufficiently the eligible
faculty and graduate students who need
specific research material found at the other
campus, there must be restrictions on the
numbers of passengers. Seeley also said that
the program originally was not intended for
undergraduates anyway.
Under the old system, many Stanford stu
dents and faculty used the buses to com
mute between the campuses, according to
Ann Lipow, UC-Berkeley library program
coordinator.
"The library couldn't foot the bill for stu
dents who used the bus as transportation to
work, or for those who wanted to take clas
ses or visit friends, she said.
Public transportation inadequate
Lipow said that a side-effect of the shut
tle's operation has been to highlight the in
adequate public transportation between the

two campuses. Undergraduates who for
merly used the bus for research or commut
ing must now take a circuitous route to get to
Cal. BART and the San Mateo Transit System
are no match for the fast, convenient non
stop service of the Gutenberg, according to
Lipow.
Next August, the $580,000 grant used to
run the program will be exhausted. Program
officials are uncertain whether the shuttle
will be continued next year. But Lipow said
she hopes that the inter-campus exchange
of books and material will continue longer.
'Rule infractions'
Even with the new regulations, she said
she feels that some people still are not using
the shuttle exclusively for library work.
"Some are and some aren't on legitimate
research," Lipow said, but added that at
tempts to "crackdown on rule infractions"
will continue.
The Gutenberg Express was organized
nearly two years ago to facilitate the move
ment of specialized books and expensive
microfilms between the two campuses. Pro

fessors can obtain expensive, low-use re
search materials within 48 hours from the
"sister" library with the shuttle service.
The Express is part of a larger program
designed to increase communication and
cooperation among some Northern Califor
nia libraries by establishing a joint computer
filing system.
Vans nearly full
Since the stricter system took effect at the
beginning of September, the vans have been
nearly full for the morning and afternoon
runs, said Susan McCoy, privileges-service
division supervisor here. She added that the
required reservations have been filling
quickly for the Gutenberg — even a week in
advance for some runs. The Gutenberg
leaves Meyer Library at the corner of Escon
dido and Galvez at 8:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m.,
1:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. Monday through
Friday and arrives at Doe (Main) Library at
Berkeley about 1 hour and 15 minutes later.

Cal. BART and the San Mateo Transit System
are no match for the fast, convenient non
stop service of the Gutenberg, according to
Lipow.
Next August, the $580,000 grant used to
run the program will be exhausted. Program
officials are uncertain whether the shuttle
will be continued next year. But Lipow said
she hopes that the inter-campus exchange
of books and material will continue longer.
'Rule infractions'
Even with the new regulations, she said
she feels that some people still are not using
the shuttle exclusively for library work.
"Some are and some aren't on legitimate
research," Lipow said, but added that at
tempts to "crackdown on rule infractions"
will continue.
The Gutenberg Express was organized
nearly two years ago to facilitate the move
ment of specialized books and expensive
microfilms between the two campuses. Pro

fessors can obtain expensive, low-use re
search materials within 48 hours from the
"sister" library with the shuttle service.
The Express is part of a larger program
designed to increase communication and
cooperation among some Northern Califor
nia libraries by establishing a joint computer
filing system.
Vans nearly full
Since the stricter system took effect at the
beginning of September, the vans have been
nearly full for the morning and afternoon
runs, said Susan McCoy, privileges-service
division supervisor here. She added that the
required reservations have been filling
quickly for the Gutenberg — even a week in
advance for some runs. The Gutenberg
leaves Meyer Library at the corner of Escon
dido and Galvez at 8:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m.,
1:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. Monday through
Friday and arrives at Doe (Main) Library at
Berkeley about 1 hour and 15 minutes later.
Reservations can be made at the Green Lib
rary service desk.
Last year the Gutenberg Express library
shuttle between Stanford and UC-Berkeley
was almost an alternate student transporta
tion route to the East Bay. A Stanford ID
practically guaranteed a seat on one of the
four daily trips between the two campuses in
an old 33-passenger bus.
But this year, there are new smaller buses
and new rules which eliminate under
graduate use. This has been done in an at
tempt to limit the service to patrons on lib
rary business, according to program offi
cials.
Ann Seeley, coordinator of the UC-
Berkeley/Stanford Research Library Prog
ram, said that under the new regulations
only faculty, academic personnel and
graduate students (for whom the shuttle
service was originated) with both a reserva
tion and a special identification card can use
the library shuttle.
New vans
The new limitations on passengers were
necessary because smaller 11-passenger

vans were bought to replace the less reliable
"Flexi-Buses." The older vehicles often
broke down and left passengers stranded on
both campuses, according to Seeley. She
said that to handle sufficiently the eligible
faculty and graduate students who need
specific research material found at the other
campus, there must be restrictions on the
numbers of passengers. Seeley also said that
the program originally was not intended for
undergraduates anyway.
Under the old system, many Stanford stu
dents and faculty used the buses to com
mute between the campuses, according to
Ann Lipow, UC-Berkeley library program
coordinator.
"The library couldn't foot the bill for stu
dents who used the bus as transportation to
work, or for those who wanted to take clas
ses or visit friends, she said.
Public transportation inadequate
Lipow said that a side-effect of the shut
tle's operation has been to highlight the in
adequate public transportation between the

two campuses. Undergraduates who for
merly used the bus for research or commut
ing must now take a circuitous route to get to
