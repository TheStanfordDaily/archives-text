Mideast negotiations to begin Oct. 12
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian government sources confirmed yes
terday that Egyptian, American and Israeli negotiators will meet
in Washington Oct. 12 to begin talks leading to the signing of an
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
The sources, who would not be identified, said the location
was changed from the Suez Canal city of Ismailia to Washington
so participating American officials would be more available.
The negotiators will try to work out a timetable for a two
phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Sinai Peninsula. They also
will seek ways to replace the Israeli military rule on the West
Bank of the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip with a local
Palestinian administration.
The talks are the next step outlined by the Camp David
agreements signed by President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
last month. They hope the accords will end 30 years of Mideast
warfare.
Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Aqaba, near Israel's southeastern
corner, an Israeli gunboat sank a Palestinian guerrilla boat
whose crew intended to blast the Israeli port of Eilat with
rockets, the military said.
Arms limitation discussions suspended
Washington —The United States and the Soviet Union failed
to reach agreement yesterday on the remaining obstacles
blocking a new arms limitation treaty and decided to suspend
negotiations for three weeks.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Cromyko met for 2Vi hours in an unusual Sunday ses
sion, and both reported their discussion was "intense and
useful."
But neither side claimed that progress was made. Officials
had expressed hope that the two countries would be able to

reach the broad outlines of an agreement during the current
round of talks, which began Wednesday.
The talks appeared to be at a critical stage as yesterday's
session began. Officials said the talks were in a "trade-off"
phase in which one side would agree to concessions in one area
only if the other did so on a different issue.
Vance announced that he will go to Moscow in the second
half of October, probably during the third week of the month,
to resume the negotiations. He said he remains hopeful that the
two sides will be able to reach an agreement before the year's
end, which has been the administration's target.
Gov. report reveals pilot's struggle
San Diego — The pilot of a Pacific Southwest Airlines 727
struggled for 30 seconds to right his craft after a mid-air colli
sion which resulted in the nation's worse air crash, the head of a
government investigation team told The Associated Press.
"The pilot's last words, 'We'fe going down,' were very
casual. It indicates that he may have thought he still had some
hope of controlling the airplane," said Rudolph Kapustin, who
heads the National Transportation Safety Board's 100-man team
investigating the cause of the crash.
There was some indication that the collision which damaged
the jetliner's right wing apparently didn't knock out it's steering
mechanism entirely, Kapustin said. He explained that a hinged
section along the trailing edge of the airplane's right wing,
which enables a pilot to control the rolling movements of the
plane, was fully deflected and pointing upward.
Trains moving following court order
Trains are moving across the United States again as the na
tion's railroads get back to full operation after nearly the entire
rail system was shut down for four days by picketing clerks.
The Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, complying

with a federal court order, removed its pickets, and rail workers
began going back to their jobs Saturday. Trains began rolling
within hours, but normal operations on the nation's 200,000
miles of rail lines were not expected for several more days.
President Jimmy Carter stepped into the dispute Thursday
and ordered the clerks back to work as the movement of man
ufactured goods, raw materials and agricultural products
ground to a halt, and many commuter and Amtrak passengers
had to find other means of travel.
Tentative newspaper agreement reached
New York — The New York Post and striking pressmen
reached tentative agreement last night on a new contract, sub
ject to union ratification, a Post attorney said.
Howard Squadron, legal counsel to the Post, said the after
noon tabloid could be back on the newsstands by Wednesday.
Squadron announced the accord after eight hours of bargain
ing.The Post pulled out of joint negotiations with the other two
newspapers and the pressmen last week.
The 7'/2-week strike that began Aug. 9 with a pressman's
walkout shut down the Post and the city's other two major
newspapers, the morning New York Times and Daily News.
ThePost agreement, if ratified, is expected to put pressure on
the other papers to settle with the pressmen and other unions
that have struck or have been respecting picket lines.

sion which resulted in the nation's worse air crash, the head of a
government investigation team told The Associated Press.
"The pilot's last words, 'We'fe going down,' were very
casual. It indicates that he may have thought he still had some
hope of controlling the airplane," said Rudolph Kapustin, who
heads the National Transportation Safety Board's 100-man team
investigating the cause of the crash.
There was some indication that the collision which damaged
the jetliner's right wing apparently didn't knock out it's steering
mechanism entirely, Kapustin said. He explained that a hinged
section along the trailing edge of the airplane's right wing,
which enables a pilot to control the rolling movements of the
plane, was fully deflected and pointing upward.
Trains moving following court order
Trains are moving across the United States again as the na
tion's railroads get back to full operation after nearly the entire
rail system was shut down for four days by picketing clerks.
The Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, complying

with a federal court order, removed its pickets, and rail workers
began going back to their jobs Saturday. Trains began rolling
within hours, but normal operations on the nation's 200,000
miles of rail lines were not expected for several more days.
President Jimmy Carter stepped into the dispute Thursday
and ordered the clerks back to work as the movement of man
ufactured goods, raw materials and agricultural products
ground to a halt, and many commuter and Amtrak passengers
had to find other means of travel.
Tentative newspaper agreement reached
New York — The New York Post and striking pressmen
reached tentative agreement last night on a new contract, sub
ject to union ratification, a Post attorney said.
Howard Squadron, legal counsel to the Post, said the after
noon tabloid could be back on the newsstands by Wednesday.
Squadron announced the accord after eight hours of bargain
ing.The Post pulled out of joint negotiations with the other two
newspapers and the pressmen last week.
The 7'/2-week strike that began Aug. 9 with a pressman's
walkout shut down the Post and the city's other two major
newspapers, the morning New York Times and Daily News.
ThePost agreement, if ratified, is expected to put pressure on
the other papers to settle with the pressmen and other unions
that have struck or have been respecting picket lines.

Mideast negotiations to begin Oct. 12
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian government sources confirmed yes
terday that Egyptian, American and Israeli negotiators will meet
in Washington Oct. 12 to begin talks leading to the signing of an
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
The sources, who would not be identified, said the location
was changed from the Suez Canal city of Ismailia to Washington
so participating American officials would be more available.
The negotiators will try to work out a timetable for a two
phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Sinai Peninsula. They also
will seek ways to replace the Israeli military rule on the West
Bank of the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip with a local
Palestinian administration.
The talks are the next step outlined by the Camp David
agreements signed by President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
last month. They hope the accords will end 30 years of Mideast
warfare.
Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Aqaba, near Israel's southeastern
corner, an Israeli gunboat sank a Palestinian guerrilla boat
whose crew intended to blast the Israeli port of Eilat with
rockets, the military said.
Arms limitation discussions suspended
Washington —The United States and the Soviet Union failed
to reach agreement yesterday on the remaining obstacles
blocking a new arms limitation treaty and decided to suspend
negotiations for three weeks.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Cromyko met for 2Vi hours in an unusual Sunday ses
sion, and both reported their discussion was "intense and
useful."
But neither side claimed that progress was made. Officials
had expressed hope that the two countries would be able to

reach the broad outlines of an agreement during the current
round of talks, which began Wednesday.
The talks appeared to be at a critical stage as yesterday's
session began. Officials said the talks were in a "trade-off"
phase in which one side would agree to concessions in one area
only if the other did so on a different issue.
Vance announced that he will go to Moscow in the second
half of October, probably during the third week of the month,
to resume the negotiations. He said he remains hopeful that the
two sides will be able to reach an agreement before the year's
end, which has been the administration's target.
