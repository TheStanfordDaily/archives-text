# How will Bakke affect Stanford's admission policies?
## What now at Stanford? 
### DAN JACOBS 
Since June 1978, the question
"What next?" has been upper
most in the minds of students, fa
culty and admissions officers who
now must implement the recent
decision made by the U.S. Sup
reme Court on the controversial
Bakke case.
The Court agreed that Bakke
was a victim of racial discrimina
tion but it upheld the use of race
as a legitimate factor in university
admissions decisions — uphold
ing the legality of university affir
mative action programs in gen
eral. But the court did call the use
of racial quotas in the admissions
process unconstitutional.
Every indicator points to the
continuation of the status quo
here. Admissions deans at all
levels suggest that affirmative ac
tion programs will continue "full
force." While the medical school
here will replace a program of
dubious legality, even it will reaf
firm its commitment to affirmative
action.
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon said undergraduate admis
sions policy will remain the same.
'Don't have quotas'
"We don't have quotas," Har
gadon said, "so the fact you can t
have them doesn't affect us. The
decision allows us to continue to
take the background of students
into account."
There will also be no change in
Law School admissions policy
here. "Our policy is lawful. We
will continue to take race into ac
count," said William Cohen,
chairman of law school admis
sions.
"Bakke has won, but so have
most minority admissions prog
< rams," said Law Professor Gerald
Gunther.
The medical school, however,
has been asked by the medical
school Faculty Senate to review
their admissions policy. The
school has a minimum goal of 20

percent minority enrollment. The
senate feared this was the legal
equivalent of a quota and thus
would be unconstitutional follow
ing the Court's decision in the
Bakke case.
'Minimum goal'
According to Dean of Minority
Admissions James McClenahan,
the "minimum goal" system of
selecting minority candidates will
be altered to comply with the
Court's prohibition of admissions
quotas. Current dual admissions
committees for majority and
minority candidates will be re
structured into a single body to
make admissions decisions on all
candidates.
Race will continue to be consi
dered as a factor in admissions in
accordance with a recommenda
tion made by the Medical School
Senate, McClenahan said.
"I would anticipate that next
year's freshman med school class
will have a significant number of
minorities and that we will main
tain our commitment to affirma
tive action," he said.
Despite these promises of con
tinued affirmative action, black
students here fear a "lessening
commitment."
Decision ambiguous
"The decision was ambiguous.
We are still questioning how the
decision will be interpreted in
terms of specific policy," Black
Student Union President Diane
Burbie said.
"The Bakke decision is really a
step backwards," president of the
Black Graduate Students Associa
tion Lynn Burbridge, said.
But Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs Thomas Massey said,
"Stanford University has kept its
commitment to affirmative action.
There definitely are universities
which feel that the Bakke decision
is a way out of affirmative action
programs whicfh they established
in the 19605. We are not one of
those."

has been asked by the medical
school Faculty Senate to review
their admissions policy. The
school has a minimum goal of 20

percent minority enrollment. The
senate feared this was the legal
equivalent of a quota and thus
would be unconstitutional follow
ing the Court's decision in the
Bakke case.
'Minimum goal'
According to Dean of Minority
Admissions James McClenahan,
the "minimum goal" system of
selecting minority candidates will
be altered to comply with the
Court's prohibition of admissions
quotas. Current dual admissions
committees for majority and
minority candidates will be re
structured into a single body to
make admissions decisions on all
candidates.
Race will continue to be consi
dered as a factor in admissions in
accordance with a recommenda
tion made by the Medical School
Senate, McClenahan said.
"I would anticipate that next
year's freshman med school class
will have a significant number of
minorities and that we will main
tain our commitment to affirma
tive action," he said.
Despite these promises of con
tinued affirmative action, black
students here fear a "lessening
commitment."
Decision ambiguous
"The decision was ambiguous.
We are still questioning how the
decision will be interpreted in
terms of specific policy," Black
Student Union President Diane
Burbie said.
"The Bakke decision is really a
step backwards," president of the
Black Graduate Students Associa
tion Lynn Burbridge, said.
But Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs Thomas Massey said,
"Stanford University has kept its
commitment to affirmative action.
There definitely are universities
which feel that the Bakke decision
is a way out of affirmative action
programs whicfh they established
in the 19605. We are not one of
those."
Since June 1978, the question
"What next?" has been upper
most in the minds of students, fa
culty and admissions officers who
now must implement the recent
decision made by the U.S. Sup
reme Court on the controversial
Bakke case.
The Court agreed that Bakke
was a victim of racial discrimina
tion but it upheld the use of race
as a legitimate factor in university
admissions decisions — uphold
ing the legality of university affir
mative action programs in gen
eral. But the court did call the use
of racial quotas in the admissions
process unconstitutional.
Every indicator points to the
continuation of the status quo
here. Admissions deans at all
levels suggest that affirmative ac
tion programs will continue "full
force." While the medical school
here will replace a program of
dubious legality, even it will reaf
firm its commitment to affirmative
action.
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon said undergraduate admis
sions policy will remain the same.
'Don't have quotas'
"We don't have quotas," Har
gadon said, "so the fact you can t
have them doesn't affect us. The
decision allows us to continue to
take the background of students
into account."
There will also be no change in
Law School admissions policy
here. "Our policy is lawful. We
will continue to take race into ac
count," said William Cohen,
chairman of law school admis
sions.
"Bakke has won, but so have
most minority admissions prog
< rams," said Law Professor Gerald
Gunther.
