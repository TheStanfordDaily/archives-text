# The 						Bakke case â€” its implications are unclear
## 
### MITCH WASTERLAIN 
During the summer, tne supreme ujuh ui
the United States settled the controversial
Bakke case in a confusing and ambiguous deci
sion. The Court ordered the UC-Davis Medical
School to accept Allan Bakke, while upholding
the use of affirmative action programs in gen
eral.
Although the Court has made its decision,
some of the reasons behind the ruling, and its
potential impacts, still may be uncertain.
The controversy began in 1973 when Allan
Bakke applied to and was rejected by the Davis
Medical School for the second consecutive
year. Bakke believed that he would have been
accepted were it not for Davis affirmative ac
tion program. The program reserved 16 of 100
medical school openings for "disadvantaged
applicants, but in practice, none of the students
accepted in the "disadvantaged" category were
white.
Bakke charged the university with racial dis
crimination and sued the regents of the Uni
versity of California on the grounds that the
program deprived him of his rights under the
14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A
lower county court agreed with Bakke, decid
ing that the program was unconstitutional be
cause it discriminated against whites.
Regents appealed
The California Supreme Court to which the
case was appealed, also decided in favor of
Bakke. The regents appealed once again, this
time to the Supreme Court of the United States.
On June 28, 1978, the Court handed down its
decision in favor of Bakke.
Because of the widely differing views of the
nine justices, the Court issued two 5-4 deci
sions. Six different opinions were written.
The Court's first decision ruled that the UC-
Davis program was unconstitutional because it
relied on a strict numerical quota based on
race. Thus, the Court said Allan Bakke should
be admitted. However, the Court also ruled
that race can be considered as a factor in admis
sion policy as long as no applicant is totally
excluded because of race.
The unusual decision occurred because of
the justices' differing views on how to define
the issues and their varying interpretations of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI
Title VI states that no person . . shall, on
the ground of race ... be excluded from par

ticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination . . under
federally-funded programs. The Davis Medical
School, like most universities, receives federal
financial assistance.
In considering the Bakke case, the justices
settled on two issues: the legality of the Davis
program specifically and the legality of affirma
tive action programs in general.
Justice John Paul Stevens, in a joint opinion
with Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Potter
Stewart and Chief Justice Warren Burger, de
clared that the UC-Davis program violated Title

VI by excluding white students, and that Bakke
should be admitted to medical school.
The same four justices also decided that the
question whether race could be considered in
admission policies for other affirmative action
programs should not be an issue.
Valid means
Justices William Brennan, Jr., Harry
Blackmun, Thurgood Marshall and Byron
White argued that the Davis program was a
valid means of redressing past discrimination
because previous Supreme Court decisions
and federal regulations enacted to enforce Title
VI had demonstrated that "race-conscious ac
tion is not only permitted but required to ac
complish the remedial objectives of Title VI."
Furthermore, these justices reasserted the
legality of affirmative action programs in gen
eral, even those using quota systems.
Justice Lewis Powell, whose opinion ulti
mately became the deciding one, straddled
both sides of the issues. Powell argued that
considering race as a factor in admissions was
permissible, but maintained that UC-Davis use
of quotas was not. Powell singled out Harvard
University's admissions program as closest to
his ideal. Harvard rates applicants on a scale of
one to six, giving minority applicants a "plus"
on this scale.
Many educators and lawyers feel that the
Bakke decision will not have a significant im

pact on admission policies.
According to J.W. Peltason, president of the
American Council on Education, only 10 or 12
schools use admissions' systems with quotas.
Harry Wellington, Dean of the Yale Law School,
said that .. it sounds as if (the decision) will
have almost no effect at all on minority admis
sions programs as they now exist at most
places."
Others, such as Herbert Reid, law professor
at Howard University, worry that the decision
will discourage affirmative action because uni
versities will be unsure about the legality of
their programs. Reid stated that . . all but
those administrators who are firmly committed
. . . are going to find that the easiest way out of
this problem is not to have an affirmative action
program."
Broader issue
In June, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald Gunther
said he feels that "it is more important than ever
to remember that while all attention has been
focused on Allan Bakke, the broader issue has
been the fate of preferential admissions prog
rams and of affirmative action generally."
Gunther concurred with the opinion of Jus
tice Lewis Powell, saying that "universities can
legitimately strive to increase the diversity of
their student bodies as an aspect of their First
Amendment academic freedom rights, so that
promoting diversity is a compelling interest.
"In short, though Bakke wins, minority ad
missions programs also win."
Stanford, along with Columbia, Harvard and
Pennsylvania Universities, filed an amicus
curiae brief supporting the UC-Davis Medical
School affirmative action program.
But after the decision was announced, ad
ministrators were optimistic about the future of
Stanford's efforts.
The Court was praised for "judicial states
manship" and condemned for an "absolutely
absurd" decision in the wake of its ruling.
Alan Derschowitz, a law professor at Har
vard, said the decision "is an act of judicial
statesmanship . . . that will go down in history
not for what it did, but for what it didn t do. It
neither legitimized racial quotas nor put down
affirmative action programs. The decision will
make the job of admissions offices a lot harder.
It will make them look at people as persons, not
as members of a group and not as com
puterized ciphers."

14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A
lower county court agreed with Bakke, decid
ing that the program was unconstitutional be
cause it discriminated against whites.
Regents appealed
The California Supreme Court to which the
case was appealed, also decided in favor of
Bakke. The regents appealed once again, this
time to the Supreme Court of the United States.
On June 28, 1978, the Court handed down its
decision in favor of Bakke.
Because of the widely differing views of the
nine justices, the Court issued two 5-4 deci
sions. Six different opinions were written.
The Court's first decision ruled that the UC-
Davis program was unconstitutional because it
relied on a strict numerical quota based on
race. Thus, the Court said Allan Bakke should
be admitted. However, the Court also ruled
that race can be considered as a factor in admis
sion policy as long as no applicant is totally
excluded because of race.
The unusual decision occurred because of
the justices' differing views on how to define
the issues and their varying interpretations of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI
Title VI states that no person . . shall, on
the ground of race ... be excluded from par

ticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination . . under
federally-funded programs. The Davis Medical
School, like most universities, receives federal
financial assistance.
In considering the Bakke case, the justices
settled on two issues: the legality of the Davis
program specifically and the legality of affirma
tive action programs in general.
Justice John Paul Stevens, in a joint opinion
with Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Potter
Stewart and Chief Justice Warren Burger, de
clared that the UC-Davis program violated Title

VI by excluding white students, and that Bakke
should be admitted to medical school.
The same four justices also decided that the
question whether race could be considered in
admission policies for other affirmative action
programs should not be an issue.
Valid means
Justices William Brennan, Jr., Harry
Blackmun, Thurgood Marshall and Byron
White argued that the Davis program was a
valid means of redressing past discrimination
because previous Supreme Court decisions
and federal regulations enacted to enforce Title
VI had demonstrated that "race-conscious ac
tion is not only permitted but required to ac
complish the remedial objectives of Title VI."
Furthermore, these justices reasserted the
legality of affirmative action programs in gen
eral, even those using quota systems.
Justice Lewis Powell, whose opinion ulti
mately became the deciding one, straddled
both sides of the issues. Powell argued that
considering race as a factor in admissions was
permissible, but maintained that UC-Davis use
of quotas was not. Powell singled out Harvard
University's admissions program as closest to
his ideal. Harvard rates applicants on a scale of
one to six, giving minority applicants a "plus"
on this scale.
Many educators and lawyers feel that the
Bakke decision will not have a significant im

pact on admission policies.
According to J.W. Peltason, president of the
American Council on Education, only 10 or 12
schools use admissions' systems with quotas.
Harry Wellington, Dean of the Yale Law School,
said that .. it sounds as if (the decision) will
have almost no effect at all on minority admis
sions programs as they now exist at most
places."
Others, such as Herbert Reid, law professor
at Howard University, worry that the decision
will discourage affirmative action because uni
versities will be unsure about the legality of
their programs. Reid stated that . . all but
those administrators who are firmly committed
. . . are going to find that the easiest way out of
this problem is not to have an affirmative action
program."
Broader issue
In June, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald Gunther
said he feels that "it is more important than ever
to remember that while all attention has been
focused on Allan Bakke, the broader issue has
been the fate of preferential admissions prog
rams and of affirmative action generally."
Gunther concurred with the opinion of Jus
tice Lewis Powell, saying that "universities can
legitimately strive to increase the diversity of
their student bodies as an aspect of their First
Amendment academic freedom rights, so that
promoting diversity is a compelling interest.
"In short, though Bakke wins, minority ad
missions programs also win."
Stanford, along with Columbia, Harvard and
Pennsylvania Universities, filed an amicus
curiae brief supporting the UC-Davis Medical
School affirmative action program.
But after the decision was announced, ad
ministrators were optimistic about the future of
Stanford's efforts.
The Court was praised for "judicial states
manship" and condemned for an "absolutely
absurd" decision in the wake of its ruling.
Alan Derschowitz, a law professor at Har
vard, said the decision "is an act of judicial
statesmanship . . . that will go down in history
not for what it did, but for what it didn t do. It
neither legitimized racial quotas nor put down
affirmative action programs. The decision will
make the job of admissions offices a lot harder.
It will make them look at people as persons, not
as members of a group and not as com
puterized ciphers."
During the summer, tne supreme ujuh ui
the United States settled the controversial
Bakke case in a confusing and ambiguous deci
sion. The Court ordered the UC-Davis Medical
School to accept Allan Bakke, while upholding
the use of affirmative action programs in gen
eral.
Although the Court has made its decision,
some of the reasons behind the ruling, and its
potential impacts, still may be uncertain.
The controversy began in 1973 when Allan
Bakke applied to and was rejected by the Davis
Medical School for the second consecutive
year. Bakke believed that he would have been
accepted were it not for Davis affirmative ac
tion program. The program reserved 16 of 100
medical school openings for "disadvantaged
applicants, but in practice, none of the students
accepted in the "disadvantaged" category were
white.
Bakke charged the university with racial dis
crimination and sued the regents of the Uni
versity of California on the grounds that the
program deprived him of his rights under the
14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A
lower county court agreed with Bakke, decid

the issues and their varying interpretations of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI
Title VI states that no person . . shall, on
the ground of race ... be excluded from par

ticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination . . under
federally-funded programs. The Davis Medical
School, like most universities, receives federal
financial assistance.
In considering the Bakke case, the justices
settled on two issues: the legality of the Davis
program specifically and the legality of affirma
tive action programs in general.
Justice John Paul Stevens, in a joint opinion
with Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Potter
Stewart and Chief Justice Warren Burger, de
clared that the UC-Davis program violated Title

VI by excluding white students, and that Bakke
should be admitted to medical school.
The same four justices also decided that the
question whether race could be considered in
admission policies for other affirmative action
programs should not be an issue.
Valid means
Justices William Brennan, Jr., Harry
Blackmun, Thurgood Marshall and Byron
White argued that the Davis program was a
valid means of redressing past discrimination
because previous Supreme Court decisions
and federal regulations enacted to enforce Title
VI had demonstrated that "race-conscious ac
tion is not only permitted but required to ac
complish the remedial objectives of Title VI."
Furthermore, these justices reasserted the
legality of affirmative action programs in gen
eral, even those using quota systems.
Justice Lewis Powell, whose opinion ulti
mately became the deciding one, straddled
both sides of the issues. Powell argued that
considering race as a factor in admissions was
permissible, but maintained that UC-Davis use
of quotas was not. Powell singled out Harvard
University's admissions program as closest to
his ideal. Harvard rates applicants on a scale of
one to six, giving minority applicants a "plus"
on this scale.
Many educators and lawyers feel that the
Bakke decision will not have a significant im

pact on admission policies.
According to J.W. Peltason, president of the
American Council on Education, only 10 or 12
schools use admissions' systems with quotas.
Harry Wellington, Dean of the Yale Law School,
said that .. it sounds as if (the decision) will
have almost no effect at all on minority admis
sions programs as they now exist at most
places."
Others, such as Herbert Reid, law professor
at Howard University, worry that the decision
will discourage affirmative action because uni
versities will be unsure about the legality of
their programs. Reid stated that . . all but
those administrators who are firmly committed
. . . are going to find that the easiest way out of
this problem is not to have an affirmative action
program."
Broader issue
In June, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald Gunther
said he feels that "it is more important than ever
to remember that while all attention has been
focused on Allan Bakke, the broader issue has
been the fate of preferential admissions prog
rams and of affirmative action generally."
Gunther concurred with the opinion of Jus
tice Lewis Powell, saying that "universities can
legitimately strive to increase the diversity of
their student bodies as an aspect of their First
Amendment academic freedom rights, so that
promoting diversity is a compelling interest.
"In short, though Bakke wins, minority ad
missions programs also win."
Stanford, along with Columbia, Harvard and
Pennsylvania Universities, filed an amicus
curiae brief supporting the UC-Davis Medical
School affirmative action program.
But after the decision was announced, ad
ministrators were optimistic about the future of
Stanford's efforts.
The Court was praised for "judicial states
manship" and condemned for an "absolutely
absurd" decision in the wake of its ruling.
Alan Derschowitz, a law professor at Har
vard, said the decision "is an act of judicial
statesmanship . . . that will go down in history
not for what it did, but for what it didn t do. It
neither legitimized racial quotas nor put down
affirmative action programs. The decision will
make the job of admissions offices a lot harder.
It will make them look at people as persons, not
as members of a group and not as com
puterized ciphers."
During the summer, tne supreme ujuh ui
the United States settled the controversial
Bakke case in a confusing and ambiguous deci
sion. The Court ordered the UC-Davis Medical
School to accept Allan Bakke, while upholding
the use of affirmative action programs in gen
eral.
Although the Court has made its decision,
some of the reasons behind the ruling, and its
potential impacts, still may be uncertain.
The controversy began in 1973 when Allan
Bakke applied to and was rejected by the Davis
Medical School for the second consecutive
year. Bakke believed that he would have been
accepted were it not for Davis affirmative ac
tion program. The program reserved 16 of 100
medical school openings for "disadvantaged
applicants, but in practice, none of the students
accepted in the "disadvantaged" category were
white.
Bakke charged the university with racial dis
crimination and sued the regents of the Uni
versity of California on the grounds that the
program deprived him of his rights under the
14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A
lower county court agreed with Bakke, decid
ing that the program was unconstitutional be
cause it discriminated against whites.
Regents appealed
The California Supreme Court to which the
case was appealed, also decided in favor of
Bakke. The regents appealed once again, this
time to the Supreme Court of the United States.
On June 28, 1978, the Court handed down its
decision in favor of Bakke.
Because of the widely differing views of the
nine justices, the Court issued two 5-4 deci
sions. Six different opinions were written.
The Court's first decision ruled that the UC-
Davis program was unconstitutional because it
relied on a strict numerical quota based on
race. Thus, the Court said Allan Bakke should
be admitted. However, the Court also ruled
that race can be considered as a factor in admis
sion policy as long as no applicant is totally
excluded because of race.
