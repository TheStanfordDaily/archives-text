# Few undergrads go to Commons
## Campus eatery serves beer 
### ROBIN MILLINGTON 
Last year, Encina Commons received the first
liquor license permitted on campus here. De
spite the fact that the Commons now serves
beer, very few undergraduates frequent the
facility.
According to Dan Williams, associate dean of
student affairs and director of Tresidder, "En
cina Commons was not designed primarily for
students." Williams said the Commons is too far
away from the undergraduate housing to be eas
ily accessible to students, but it does offer the
faculty and staff in that section of campus an
eatery close to where they work.
Williams said that the only liquor license on
campus was not installed at Encina to attract
more students, but because "that was where we
could get the license."
According to Williams, a food management
company called PDS was hired five years ago to
manage the food service. PDS was granted a
liquor license and the company chose the cam
pus location where liquor would be served.
The Commons was chosen because it is a
small area where the effects of liquor on campus
could be observed, and also where the use of
liquor could be best controlled, Williams said.
Enticement to students
However, a number of patrons and Commons
staff believe that the beer had been introduced
as an enticement to encourage more student
business.
Staff member Catherine Voegtlin said that
"the beer didn't work out. Adults are going to go
somewhere else for serious drinking and not
that many students are over 21."
Both Voegtlin and fellow staff member Kevin

Jones said they thought that "business would
pick up" if the Commons opened in the Â®y en "
ings to serve beer and snacks in a "pub-like'
atmosphere.
Tresidder 'spartan'
Senior Rick Weissbourd said he preferred the
atmosphere of the Commons to other eating
facilities because "the Coffeehouse is too trite,
and Tresidder is too spartan."
He said he was not attracted to the Commons
simply because it offered beer, and believes that
few other students would use the Commons
during the day for that reason either.
Weissbourd added though, that if the Com
mons were open at night, and "if it was known
as a pub, it would do a booming business."
According to Ellen Oppenheim, assistant di
rector of Tresidder, the Commons was opened
during the evenings for a few weeks spring quar
ter, but few patrons took advantage of the ex
tended hours.
Fall special programs
This fall, in addition to the Commons' regular
hours, Monday through Friday from7:3oa.m. to
3 p.m., a number of special programs will be
held on various weekends through fall quarter.
ASSU Director of Special Events Brian Becker
said that he would like to see "top-notch name
entertainment" at the Commons.
Thomas Moore, assistant director, said the
ASSU is trying to achieve a "club atmosphere."
There will be table service and beer will be
served to people over the age of 21, but
everyone is encouraged to come. Moore said he
hopes this will attract more of the under
graduate community than has frequented the
Commons in the past.
