# Amnesty International seeks to aid prisoners

### RUTHANN RICHTER 
"Every person has the right to
hold and to express his convic
tions and has an obligation to
extend the same freedom to
others."
This phrase is the byword of
Amnesty International, an in
dependent human rights
movement formed in 1961 to
aid in the release of what the
group calls "prisoners of con
science" — those who have
been incarcerated solely be
cause of their political beliefs,
color, ethnic origin or religion.
In the United States there are
about 2000 Amnesty organiza
tions, including a Stanford
group that is now beginning its
1978-79 program.
Last year, about 25 students
and local community members
actively participated in the
Stanford Amnesty program,
writing letters and articles, dis
tributing leaflets and raising
funds on behalf of its
"adopted" prisoners.
The group's efforts appa
rently paid off — their Indone
sian "adoptee," Bujung Saleh,
was released last December
along with 10,000 other prison
ers, presumably because of the
government's concern over its
deteriorating image abroad,
according to group co-leader
Steve Tappel.
"Amnesty's chief weapon is
the force of international pub
lic opinion,"which the group
attempts to mobilize, Tappel
added. In general, Tappel said,

it is difficult to measure the ac
tual effect of the group's ef
forts. He said that in half of the
cases in which Amnesty is in
volved, an improvement is
seen, although a direct con
nection between the group
and the result cannot always be
assumed.
This year, the Stanford group
will concentrate on two indi
vidual cases. One concerns a
Czechoslovakian prisoner,
Miloslav Cerny, who was ar
rested in 1977 for distributing
materials criticizing the Czech
government's human rights
practices. Cerny's case is com
plicated by his epileptic condi
tion, for which prison au
thorities have denied him
medication, Tappel said.
The group's South Korean
"adoptee," Whang Hon-Sung,
has been sentenced to 15 years
in prison because of his affilia
tion with a political party op
posing the then-current re
gime. In Whang's case, the
Amnesty group has had the
unusual success of making di
rect contact with the warden of
Whang's prison as well as
Whang himself.
Last year, the group sent
$500 to Whang's family, using
funds raised through locally
sponsored activities. Such ac
tivities are the group's primary
source of support, though
some money is provided
through subscriptions and do
nations, Tappel added.

volved, an improvement is
seen, although a direct con
nection between the group
and the result cannot always be
assumed.
This year, the Stanford group
will concentrate on two indi
vidual cases. One concerns a
Czechoslovakian prisoner,
Miloslav Cerny, who was ar
rested in 1977 for distributing
materials criticizing the Czech
government's human rights
practices. Cerny's case is com
plicated by his epileptic condi
tion, for which prison au
thorities have denied him
medication, Tappel said.
The group's South Korean
"adoptee," Whang Hon-Sung,
has been sentenced to 15 years
in prison because of his affilia
tion with a political party op
posing the then-current re
gime. In Whang's case, the
Amnesty group has had the
unusual success of making di
rect contact with the warden of
Whang's prison as well as
Whang himself.
Last year, the group sent
$500 to Whang's family, using
funds raised through locally
sponsored activities. Such ac
tivities are the group's primary
source of support, though
some money is provided
through subscriptions and do
nations, Tappel added.
"Every person has the right to
hold and to express his convic
tions and has an obligation to
extend the same freedom to
others."
This phrase is the byword of
Amnesty International, an in
dependent human rights
movement formed in 1961 to
aid in the release of what the
group calls "prisoners of con
science" — those who have
been incarcerated solely be
cause of their political beliefs,
color, ethnic origin or religion.
In the United States there are
about 2000 Amnesty organiza
tions, including a Stanford
group that is now beginning its
1978-79 program.
Last year, about 25 students
and local community members
actively participated in the
Stanford Amnesty program,
writing letters and articles, dis
tributing leaflets and raising
funds on behalf of its
"adopted" prisoners.
The group's efforts appa
rently paid off — their Indone
sian "adoptee," Bujung Saleh,
was released last December
along with 10,000 other prison
ers, presumably because of the
government's concern over its
deteriorating image abroad,
according to group co-leader
Steve Tappel.
"Amnesty's chief weapon is
the force of international pub
lic opinion,"which the group
attempts to mobilize, Tappel
added. In general, Tappel said,

it is difficult to measure the ac
tual effect of the group's ef
forts. He said that in half of the
cases in which Amnesty is in
volved, an improvement is
seen, although a direct con
nection between the group
and the result cannot always be
assumed.
