Should the justices extend

civil rights suits.
I he court also will decide
whether non-contributory
pension plans covering mill
ions of ac tive and retired
workers .ire subject to federal
securities laws.
A lower court said they are,
providing enhanced protec
tion to workers.
Bui in its appeal, the Teams
ter Pension Trust Fund told the
justices that the ruling "creates

immediate and serious difficul
ties for the financial stability
and administration of the en
tire private pension system."
That system had a reported
aggregate asset value at the
end of 1975 of $145.6 billion.
Here are some of the other
issues the justices have agreed
to decide this term:
Sexual equality
— Whether state laws pro
viding alimony payments
only for women foster uncon
stitutional sex discrimination.
The test case, watched
closely by women's rights
groups, challenges Alabama's
alimony laws. Eleven other
states provide no possibility for
men to collect alimony. Those

states are Arkansas, Georgia,
Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Nevada, New York, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Ten
nessee and Wyoming.
Abortion
— Whether a state may re
quire all doctors to carefully
determine before performing a
requested abortion whether
the fetus is capable of surviving
outside the woman's body
and, if so, try to abort the fetus
alive.
Pennsylvania had such a law
but it was struck down by a
federal court in Philadelphia.
The Supreme Court would
have to alter significantly its
controversial 1973 ruling
legalizing abortions if it was to

reinstate the state law.
Free press
— Whether public officials
suing for libel may force jour
nalists to tell what their
thoughts, opinions and con
clusions were while preparing
a news story.
A divided federal appeals
court said in a case involving a
report on CBS' 60 Minutes
television news show that such
inquiries violate free press.

issues the justices have agreed

Sexual equality
— Whether state laws pro

only for women foster uncon
stitutional sex discrimination.
The test case, watched
closely by women's rights
groups, challenges Alabama's
alimony laws. Eleven other
states provide no possibility for
men to collect alimony. Those

states are Arkansas, Georgia,
Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Nevada, New York, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Ten
nessee and Wyoming.
Abortion
— Whether a state may re
quire all doctors to carefully
determine before performing a
requested abortion whether
the fetus is capable of surviving
outside the woman's body
and, if so, try to abort the fetus
alive.
Pennsylvania had such a law
but it was struck down by a
federal court in Philadelphia.
The Supreme Court would
have to alter significantly its
controversial 1973 ruling
legalizing abortions if it was to

reinstate the state law.
Free press
— Whether public officials
suing for libel may force jour
nalists to tell what their
thoughts, opinions and con
clusions were while preparing
a news story.
A divided federal appeals
court said in a case involving a
report on CBS' 60 Minutes

Should the justices extend
the intentional bias require
ment, it could make it much
more ditfic ult to file successful
civil rights suits.
I he court also will decide
whether non-contributory
pension plans covering mill
ions of ac tive and retired
workers .ire subject to federal
securities laws.
A lower court said they are,
providing enhanced protec
tion to workers.
Bui in its appeal, the Teams
ter Pension Trust Fund told the
justices that the ruling "creates

immediate and serious difficul
ties for the financial stability
and administration of the en
tire private pension system."
That system had a reported
aggregate asset value at the
end of 1975 of $145.6 billion.
Here are some of the other
issues the justices have agreed
to decide this term:
Sexual equality
— Whether state laws pro
viding alimony payments
only for women foster uncon
stitutional sex discrimination.
The test case, watched
closely by women's rights
groups, challenges Alabama's
alimony laws. Eleven other
states provide no possibility for
men to collect alimony. Those

states are Arkansas, Georgia,
Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Nevada, New York, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Ten
nessee and Wyoming.
Abortion
— Whether a state may re
quire all doctors to carefully
determine before performing a
requested abortion whether
the fetus is capable of surviving
outside the woman's body
and, if so, try to abort the fetus
alive.
Pennsylvania had such a law
but it was struck down by a
federal court in Philadelphia.
The Supreme Court would
have to alter significantly its
controversial 1973 ruling
legalizing abortions if it was to

reinstate the state law.
Free press
— Whether public officials
suing for libel may force jour
nalists to tell what their
thoughts, opinions and con
clusions were while preparing
a news story.
A divided federal appeals
court said in a case involving a
report on CBS' 60 Minutes
television news show that such
inquiries violate free press.
