Seismic Data Collection, Processing and Interpretation. This organization is the world leader in
the search for oil. Seismic services (both land and marine) include three-dimensional (3D) geo
physical data gathering and processing, an important new approach in delineating petroleum
bearing formations, pioneered by TI.
Ecological-Environmental Services. This operation conducts studies designed to evaluate and '
■ improve our environment. Programs range from infrared "mapping" of heat loss from homes on
a state-wide basis to studies of the ecological impact of power generation on the Hudson River.
