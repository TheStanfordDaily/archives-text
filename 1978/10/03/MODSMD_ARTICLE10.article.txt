## Editorial Diversify Senate 
### 
Today marks the closing of the fil
ing period for ASSU Senate candi
dates. Yet these candidates may find
themselves elected to a non
existent body if a proposed constitu
tional amendment abolishing the
senate passes in next week's elec
tion.
While the Daily will reserve judg
ment on the Committee to Retire
Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) amend
ment to abolish the senate until later
this week, there is a strong ne£d for
a spirited campaign for those candi
dates who believe the ASSU Senate
is a viable body.
The mere introduction of the
CRAP proposal points to the need
for serious discussion about the po
tential for senate reform in its or
ganization and the structuring of
annual elections. Each voter should
strongly question senate candidates
this year about the need for reform
and what that should include.
Absent in recent years has been
the lack of diversification and indi
viduality on the part of senate mem
bers which the body so desperately
needs.
With large slates, including the
Hammer and Coffin and the Stan
ford Organizing Committee (SOC)
dominating the senate in recent
years, it is easy to understand why a
majority of students might feel un
represented by the senate.
Ideally the senate should repre
sent all interests of the student
community. Yetwiththedominance
of slates in recent years, this rep

resentation never materialized.
The advantages given any large
slate in its campaign for election are
dangers well documented. By or
ganizing into groups up to 10 candi
cated, slates can spend conceivably
up to $500 to make all their names
known. However, that one indi
vidual who wants to run unattached
has just $50 to spend. A senate elec
tion is just a name contest, anyway.
An election is too short and has too
many candidates to develop a seri
ous discussion of issues.
The danger in large slates is inhe
rent and the advantages few and in
significant. The Daily will refuse to
support any individual member of
what might be a dominant slate.
The future out-lawing of slates is a
viable alternative. When a senator
from SOC was elected by less than
10 percent of all undergraduates last
year, you seriously have to question
whether that constitutes true rep
resentation.
With a constitutionally required
two-thirds vote required for ap
proval, CRAP supporters have a
tough battle in front of them if they
expect passage of their amendment.
However, even if CRAP fails, the
very serious need for senate im
provement is not diminished.
Any type of reform should en
courage a senate of individuals and
diversification. That reform should
start with this year's election with an
absence of dominant slates when fil
ing closes later today.

up to $500 to make all their names
known. However, that one indi
vidual who wants to run unattached
has just $50 to spend. A senate elec
tion is just a name contest, anyway.
An election is too short and has too
many candidates to develop a seri
ous discussion of issues.
The danger in large slates is inhe
rent and the advantages few and in
significant. The Daily will refuse to
support any individual member of
what might be a dominant slate.
The future out-lawing of slates is a
viable alternative. When a senator
from SOC was elected by less than
10 percent of all undergraduates last
year, you seriously have to question
whether that constitutes true rep
resentation.
With a constitutionally required
two-thirds vote required for ap
proval, CRAP supporters have a
tough battle in front of them if they
expect passage of their amendment.
However, even if CRAP fails, the
very serious need for senate im
provement is not diminished.
Any type of reform should en
courage a senate of individuals and
diversification. That reform should
start with this year's election with an
absence of dominant slates when fil
ing closes later today.
Today marks the closing of the fil
ing period for ASSU Senate candi
dates. Yet these candidates may find
themselves elected to a non
existent body if a proposed constitu
tional amendment abolishing the
senate passes in next week's elec
tion.
While the Daily will reserve judg
ment on the Committee to Retire
Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) amend
ment to abolish the senate until later
this week, there is a strong ne£d for
a spirited campaign for those candi
dates who believe the ASSU Senate
is a viable body.
The mere introduction of the
CRAP proposal points to the need
for serious discussion about the po
tential for senate reform in its or
ganization and the structuring of
annual elections. Each voter should
strongly question senate candidates
this year about the need for reform
and what that should include.
Absent in recent years has been
the lack of diversification and indi
viduality on the part of senate mem
bers which the body so desperately
needs.
With large slates, including the
Hammer and Coffin and the Stan
ford Organizing Committee (SOC)
dominating the senate in recent
years, it is easy to understand why a
majority of students might feel un
represented by the senate.
Ideally the senate should repre
sent all interests of the student
community. Yetwiththedominance
of slates in recent years, this rep

resentation never materialized.
The advantages given any large
slate in its campaign for election are
dangers well documented. By or
ganizing into groups up to 10 candi
cated, slates can spend conceivably
up to $500 to make all their names
known. However, that one indi
vidual who wants to run unattached
has just $50 to spend. A senate elec
tion is just a name contest, anyway.
