## Women and public life 
### 
This fall five women's col
leges in the country will, with
the aid of a grant from the Car
negie Foundation, inaugurate
programs aimed at increasing
the interest in and participa
tion by women in public life.
The motivation for the effort
came from Frances Farenthold,
former Texas state representa
tive and currently president of
Wells College. Capsuling her
idea, she wrote in the Christian
Science Monitor the other day,
"Traditionally, liberal arts col
leges have been charged with
developing leadership for a
democratic society. Why not
relate the traditional charge to
women?"

There is, of course, no
reason why not. Increased par
ticipation by women in politi
cal life would not only advance
women's issues; more basi
cally it would expand the po
tential pool of leadership on all
issues from which the country
could benefit. Yet, a recent
issue of Congressional Quar
terly contains an article which
raises serious doubts whether
a lagging of women's interest
and participation in politics is
really the cause for their rela
tive rarity in public office.
While the number of women
in state legislatures has in
creased from 344 in 1971 to 702
now, it still amounts to less

than 10 percent of the total, ac
cording to CQ. Further, there
are only 18 women in the US
House — the number may well
decline after the fall elections
— and only two currently sit
ting in the Senate, both of
whom were appointed to fill
the seats of their deceased
husbands.
It is almost inevitable that
women's roles in public life
will increase over time. But that
participation will probably in
crease in all institutions of our
society. In a democracy, poli
tics tends more to reflect soci
ety than to transform it.
