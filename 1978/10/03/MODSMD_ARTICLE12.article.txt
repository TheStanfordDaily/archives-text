## A 						lesson in the San Diego crash 
### 
Thanks to the Daily for spotlighting the
Stanford airspace controversy (September
27,1978). Unfortunately, statements by av
iation administrators quoted in the article
were both off the point and misleading.
Jet aircraft descending to San Francisco
International (SFO) tend occasionally to
drop below the Terminal Control Area
(TCA) minimum altitude of 4000 feet while
private aircraft use the same airspace over
Stanford lands. Frank Boone, SFO deputy
chief, alleged in the article that the TCA
prevents accidents like the San Diego col
lision. This is not the same as saying that
jets never violate Stanford airspace below
the TCA, however, and our views conflict
precisely on this point. He's right that the
TCA system ought to prevent collisions as
long as pilots strictly observe TCA separa
tion altitudes. But on close inspection, his
statement amounts to a tautology: "All will
go perfectly if everyone obeys regula
tions." They don't. Mr. Boone doesn't live
where I do, he hasn't observed aircraft
here for as long as I have, and his assur
ance is not the least convincing. For the
real world, and especially the frequently
traveled airspace over Stanford, is inha
bited by fallible people (including pilots)
well out of sight of Mr. Boone and SFO
tower operators.
Now, compare what he alleges with the
facts of the San Diego accident. Mr. Boone
is confusing the world as it is with the
world as he would like it to be when he
emphasizes that "all aircraft are separated
within the confines of a TCA," that "planes
must have an encoding altimeter (display
ing position and altitude on SFO radar)"
and that they "must be in constant com
munication with the tower." First, both
San Diego aircraft were operating pre
sumably by some or all of these standards
when thev collided, which confirms that
neither TCAs, radar nor sophisticated
radios in various combinations always
prevent accidents. Second, he neglects to
mention that all Stanford airspace from
ground level to 4000 feet above sea level is
excluded from the SFO Terminal Control
Area, is uncontrolled by SFO tower
operators and continuously used by pri
vate aircraft. Until his office specifically
denies my allegations, you may also as
sume that this uncontrolled airspace is
penetrated occasionally by commercial
jets that slip below the 4000-foot TCA
minimum. Nor are private aircraft flying
through the uncontrolled airspace over

the University required to have encoding
altimeter-transponders. As for his refer
ence to continuous contact between air
craft and tower, imagine the pan
demonium in the SFO tower if operators
there had to monitor radio transmissions
from all private aircraft in uncontrolled
airspaces below TCAs in addition to those
from controlled aircraft.
The key issue here is not how many reg
ulations define the TCA or how much ex
pensive equipment is on board enroute
aircraft. The issue is, instead the carrying
capacity of peninsula airspace.
For more than 10 years I've lived in
homes overlooking the campus and
watched the paths and altitudes of jet air
craft descending from the west on base leg
to intersect SFO final approach over the
bay. Most of these aircraft are flying at
reduced power in the TCA airspace (at
4000 feet or above) while the crew may be
busy in the cockpit with prelanding duties.
But once or twice a month, a 747 or a DC-10
slips below the TCA minimum of 4000 feet.
At least six times this year I've noticed
jumbos between 3000 and 2500 feet, air
craft that have descended perhaps faster
than their aircrews planned, at minimum
power and flat glide angle, trying to lose
excess speed before intersecting the SFO
approach path. If the flights are from Asia
or the southwest Pacific, the crews are no
doubt relieved to see land again and eager
to get home. A few hundred feet below
altitude minimums on a clear day or night
and with the field in sight means little to
aircrews who are tired and have been over
water for 10 or 20 hours.
The problem lies partly with these jets
and partly with private flying school
operators and private pilots who claim
equal right to the airspace over Stanford
and westward lands, much of which are
uninhabited but which climb gradually
from about 100 feet above sea level at the
Stadium to 500 feet and more in the
Skyline foothills. These private aircraft,
uncontrolled by SFO approach radar, are
sandwiched between ascending terrain
and descending commercial jets. Many are
high-wing aircraft with restricted rearward
and upward visibility. At the same time,
the jumbos are so designed that their
pilots' visibility is restricted forward and
below. As if that were not bad enough,
pilots of both commercial and private air
craft may be busy with cockpit duties while
outside vigilance suffers.

Besides variable-sized aircraft on ran
dom headings at vastly different speeds
with minimal vertical separation piloted by
preoccupied aircrews, we have an addi
tional problem: the 4000-foot TCA zone
over Stanford abruptly steps down to 2500
feet approximately above El Camino Real.
This downward shift of controlled airspace
is designed partly to allow jets to descend,
without gaining excess speed, to the SFO
final approach path. It is natural, then,
for a 747 pilot to shave a few hundred feet
and begin descending to 2500 feet after he
passes over Skyline. Consequently, more
than a few jumbo jets can be fixed over
Stanford at altitudes below 4000 feet, even
though most Stanford land is supposedly
protected by the 4000-foot TCA minimum
overhead.
Obviously, prohibiting most private fly
ing over Stanford will force San Carlos and
Palo Alto flying schools to spend more
time to reach distant practice areas. This
will increase the cost of lessons and may
drive the schools out of town or out of
business. It will also require some
minor rerouting of cross-country flights
otherwise planned over Stanford lands.
But if these considerations are grave
enough to warrant exposing commercial
airline passengers to air collisions and
Stanford students, employees and resi
dents to aircraft falling from the sky, then
what the FAA and the vested interests are
really saying is that society exists merely to
serve its economy.
The risks to Stanford citizens can be
minimized tomorrow without interfering
with commercial SFO traffic. Simply ban
all flying above Stanford lands between
ground level and 3000 feet above the
ground. Require TCA control of all aircraft
above 3000 feet. Establish a "prohibited"
airspace region above Stanford lands with
stiff fines to ensure that the restriction is
respected. And provide federal assistance
to private flying school operators who
must relocate. These and other costs to
taxpayers and the private flying sector are
a small price to pay to prevent a repeat of
the San Diego crash. Less rigorous steps
suggest that the prevailing system of
power in this society requires us to have an
accident in order to prevent one.

officer with the Strategic Air Command,
Peter Faulkner received his graduate de
gree at Stanford where he now teaches in
the SWOPSI program.)

than their aircrews planned, at minimum
power and flat glide angle, trying to lose
excess speed before intersecting the SFO
approach path. If the flights are from Asia
or the southwest Pacific, the crews are no
doubt relieved to see land again and eager
to get home. A few hundred feet below
altitude minimums on a clear day or night
and with the field in sight means little to
aircrews who are tired and have been over
water for 10 or 20 hours.
The problem lies partly with these jets
and partly with private flying school
operators and private pilots who claim
equal right to the airspace over Stanford
and westward lands, much of which are
uninhabited but which climb gradually
from about 100 feet above sea level at the
Stadium to 500 feet and more in the
Skyline foothills. These private aircraft,
uncontrolled by SFO approach radar, are
sandwiched between ascending terrain
and descending commercial jets. Many are
high-wing aircraft with restricted rearward
and upward visibility. At the same time,
the jumbos are so designed that their
pilots' visibility is restricted forward and
below. As if that were not bad enough,
pilots of both commercial and private air
craft may be busy with cockpit duties while
outside vigilance suffers.

Besides variable-sized aircraft on ran
dom headings at vastly different speeds
with minimal vertical separation piloted by
preoccupied aircrews, we have an addi
tional problem: the 4000-foot TCA zone
over Stanford abruptly steps down to 2500
feet approximately above El Camino Real.
This downward shift of controlled airspace
is designed partly to allow jets to descend,
without gaining excess speed, to the SFO
final approach path. It is natural, then,
for a 747 pilot to shave a few hundred feet
and begin descending to 2500 feet after he
passes over Skyline. Consequently, more
than a few jumbo jets can be fixed over
Stanford at altitudes below 4000 feet, even
though most Stanford land is supposedly
protected by the 4000-foot TCA minimum
overhead.
Obviously, prohibiting most private fly
ing over Stanford will force San Carlos and
Palo Alto flying schools to spend more
time to reach distant practice areas. This
will increase the cost of lessons and may
drive the schools out of town or out of
business. It will also require some
minor rerouting of cross-country flights
otherwise planned over Stanford lands.
But if these considerations are grave
enough to warrant exposing commercial
airline passengers to air collisions and
Stanford students, employees and resi
dents to aircraft falling from the sky, then
what the FAA and the vested interests are
really saying is that society exists merely to
serve its economy.
The risks to Stanford citizens can be
minimized tomorrow without interfering
with commercial SFO traffic. Simply ban
all flying above Stanford lands between
ground level and 3000 feet above the
ground. Require TCA control of all aircraft
above 3000 feet. Establish a "prohibited"
airspace region above Stanford lands with
stiff fines to ensure that the restriction is
respected. And provide federal assistance
to private flying school operators who
must relocate. These and other costs to
taxpayers and the private flying sector are
a small price to pay to prevent a repeat of
the San Diego crash. Less rigorous steps
suggest that the prevailing system of
power in this society requires us to have an
accident in order to prevent one.

Thanks to the Daily for spotlighting the
Stanford airspace controversy (September
27,1978). Unfortunately, statements by av
iation administrators quoted in the article
were both off the point and misleading.
Jet aircraft descending to San Francisco
International (SFO) tend occasionally to
drop below the Terminal Control Area
(TCA) minimum altitude of 4000 feet while
private aircraft use the same airspace over
Stanford lands. Frank Boone, SFO deputy
chief, alleged in the article that the TCA
prevents accidents like the San Diego col
lision. This is not the same as saying that
jets never violate Stanford airspace below
the TCA, however, and our views conflict
precisely on this point. He's right that the
TCA system ought to prevent collisions as
long as pilots strictly observe TCA separa
tion altitudes. But on close inspection, his
statement amounts to a tautology: "All will
go perfectly if everyone obeys regula
tions." They don't. Mr. Boone doesn't live
where I do, he hasn't observed aircraft
here for as long as I have, and his assur
ance is not the least convincing. For the
real world, and especially the frequently
traveled airspace over Stanford, is inha
bited by fallible people (including pilots)
well out of sight of Mr. Boone and SFO
tower operators.
Now, compare what he alleges with the
facts of the San Diego accident. Mr. Boone
is confusing the world as it is with the
world as he would like it to be when he
emphasizes that "all aircraft are separated
within the confines of a TCA," that "planes
must have an encoding altimeter (display
ing position and altitude on SFO radar)"
and that they "must be in constant com
munication with the tower." First, both
San Diego aircraft were operating pre
sumably by some or all of these standards
when thev collided, which confirms that
neither TCAs, radar nor sophisticated
radios in various combinations always
prevent accidents. Second, he neglects to
mention that all Stanford airspace from
ground level to 4000 feet above sea level is
excluded from the SFO Terminal Control
Area, is uncontrolled by SFO tower
operators and continuously used by pri
vate aircraft. Until his office specifically
denies my allegations, you may also as
sume that this uncontrolled airspace is
penetrated occasionally by commercial
jets that slip below the 4000-foot TCA
minimum. Nor are private aircraft flying
through the uncontrolled airspace over

the University required to have encoding
altimeter-transponders. As for his refer
ence to continuous contact between air
craft and tower, imagine the pan
demonium in the SFO tower if operators
there had to monitor radio transmissions
from all private aircraft in uncontrolled
airspaces below TCAs in addition to those
from controlled aircraft.
The key issue here is not how many reg
ulations define the TCA or how much ex
pensive equipment is on board enroute
aircraft. The issue is, instead the carrying
capacity of peninsula airspace.
For more than 10 years I've lived in
homes overlooking the campus and
watched the paths and altitudes of jet air
craft descending from the west on base leg
to intersect SFO final approach over the
bay. Most of these aircraft are flying at
reduced power in the TCA airspace (at
4000 feet or above) while the crew may be
busy in the cockpit with prelanding duties.
But once or twice a month, a 747 or a DC-10
slips below the TCA minimum of 4000 feet.
At least six times this year I've noticed
jumbos between 3000 and 2500 feet, air
craft that have descended perhaps faster
than their aircrews planned, at minimum
power and flat glide angle, trying to lose
excess speed before intersecting the SFO
approach path. If the flights are from Asia

27,1978). Unfortunately, statements by av
iation administrators quoted in the article
were both off the point and misleading.
Jet aircraft descending to San Francisco
International (SFO) tend occasionally to
drop below the Terminal Control Area
(TCA) minimum altitude of 4000 feet while
private aircraft use the same airspace over
Stanford lands. Frank Boone, SFO deputy
chief, alleged in the article that the TCA
prevents accidents like the San Diego col
lision. This is not the same as saying that
jets never violate Stanford airspace below
the TCA, however, and our views conflict
precisely on this point. He's right that the
TCA system ought to prevent collisions as
long as pilots strictly observe TCA separa
tion altitudes. But on close inspection, his
statement amounts to a tautology: "All will
go perfectly if everyone obeys regula
tions." They don't. Mr. Boone doesn't live
where I do, he hasn't observed aircraft
here for as long as I have, and his assur
ance is not the least convincing. For the
real world, and especially the frequently
traveled airspace over Stanford, is inha
bited by fallible people (including pilots)
well out of sight of Mr. Boone and SFO
tower operators.
Now, compare what he alleges with the
facts of the San Diego accident. Mr. Boone
is confusing the world as it is with the
world as he would like it to be when he
emphasizes that "all aircraft are separated
within the confines of a TCA," that "planes
must have an encoding altimeter (display
ing position and altitude on SFO radar)"
and that they "must be in constant com
munication with the tower." First, both
San Diego aircraft were operating pre
sumably by some or all of these standards
when thev collided, which confirms that
neither TCAs, radar nor sophisticated
radios in various combinations always
prevent accidents. Second, he neglects to
mention that all Stanford airspace from
ground level to 4000 feet above sea level is
excluded from the SFO Terminal Control
Area, is uncontrolled by SFO tower
operators and continuously used by pri
vate aircraft. Until his office specifically
denies my allegations, you may also as
sume that this uncontrolled airspace is
penetrated occasionally by commercial
jets that slip below the 4000-foot TCA
minimum. Nor are private aircraft flying
through the uncontrolled airspace over

the University required to have encoding
altimeter-transponders. As for his refer
ence to continuous contact between air
craft and tower, imagine the pan
demonium in the SFO tower if operators
there had to monitor radio transmissions
from all private aircraft in uncontrolled
airspaces below TCAs in addition to those
from controlled aircraft.
The key issue here is not how many reg
ulations define the TCA or how much ex
pensive equipment is on board enroute
aircraft. The issue is, instead the carrying
capacity of peninsula airspace.
For more than 10 years I've lived in
homes overlooking the campus and
watched the paths and altitudes of jet air
craft descending from the west on base leg
to intersect SFO final approach over the
bay. Most of these aircraft are flying at
reduced power in the TCA airspace (at
4000 feet or above) while the crew may be
busy in the cockpit with prelanding duties.
But once or twice a month, a 747 or a DC-10
slips below the TCA minimum of 4000 feet.
At least six times this year I've noticed
jumbos between 3000 and 2500 feet, air
craft that have descended perhaps faster
than their aircrews planned, at minimum
power and flat glide angle, trying to lose
excess speed before intersecting the SFO
approach path. If the flights are from Asia
or the southwest Pacific, the crews are no
doubt relieved to see land again and eager
to get home. A few hundred feet below
altitude minimums on a clear day or night
and with the field in sight means little to
aircrews who are tired and have been over
water for 10 or 20 hours.
The problem lies partly with these jets
and partly with private flying school
operators and private pilots who claim
equal right to the airspace over Stanford
and westward lands, much of which are
uninhabited but which climb gradually
from about 100 feet above sea level at the
Stadium to 500 feet and more in the
Skyline foothills. These private aircraft,
uncontrolled by SFO approach radar, are
sandwiched between ascending terrain
and descending commercial jets. Many are
high-wing aircraft with restricted rearward
and upward visibility. At the same time,
the jumbos are so designed that their
pilots' visibility is restricted forward and
below. As if that were not bad enough,
pilots of both commercial and private air
craft may be busy with cockpit duties while
outside vigilance suffers.

Besides variable-sized aircraft on ran
dom headings at vastly different speeds
with minimal vertical separation piloted by
preoccupied aircrews, we have an addi
tional problem: the 4000-foot TCA zone
over Stanford abruptly steps down to 2500
feet approximately above El Camino Real.
This downward shift of controlled airspace
is designed partly to allow jets to descend,
without gaining excess speed, to the SFO
final approach path. It is natural, then,
for a 747 pilot to shave a few hundred feet
and begin descending to 2500 feet after he
passes over Skyline. Consequently, more
than a few jumbo jets can be fixed over
Stanford at altitudes below 4000 feet, even
though most Stanford land is supposedly
protected by the 4000-foot TCA minimum
overhead.
Obviously, prohibiting most private fly
ing over Stanford will force San Carlos and
Palo Alto flying schools to spend more
time to reach distant practice areas. This
will increase the cost of lessons and may
drive the schools out of town or out of
business. It will also require some
minor rerouting of cross-country flights
otherwise planned over Stanford lands.
But if these considerations are grave
enough to warrant exposing commercial
airline passengers to air collisions and
Stanford students, employees and resi
dents to aircraft falling from the sky, then
what the FAA and the vested interests are
really saying is that society exists merely to
serve its economy.
The risks to Stanford citizens can be
minimized tomorrow without interfering
with commercial SFO traffic. Simply ban
all flying above Stanford lands between
ground level and 3000 feet above the
ground. Require TCA control of all aircraft
above 3000 feet. Establish a "prohibited"
airspace region above Stanford lands with
stiff fines to ensure that the restriction is
respected. And provide federal assistance
to private flying school operators who
must relocate. These and other costs to
taxpayers and the private flying sector are
a small price to pay to prevent a repeat of
the San Diego crash. Less rigorous steps
suggest that the prevailing system of
power in this society requires us to have an
accident in order to prevent one.
