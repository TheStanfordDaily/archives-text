## The 						PLO need not be included in agreement 
### 
In his Daily editorial of September 28
Michael Economides poses the ques
tion "Can the PLO be ignored?" in re
ference to'the peace initiative which
emerged from the Camp David Sum
mit. Economides answers his own
question with a firm "ho" and in the
process makes the following assump
tions:
1. Israel wants to ignore the Palesti
nians.
2. Golda Meir once denied the exis
tence of the, Palestinians. (And
Economides "quotes" her on this.)
3. That it is a biased judgement to
conclude that the PLO is a "ruthless,
bloodthirsty terrorist organization."
4. That the PLO "enjoys widespread
support in the Arab world."
5. That any peace agreement in the
Middle East that "ignores the PLO is
doomed to fail."
Should we accept these assumptions
on face value? I believe that a careful
examination of the subject matter reve
als quite a different set of facts, one that
casts Israel in a much better light and
one which proves that President Carter
is on the right track in disregarding the
PLO.
To begin with, Economides is wrong
when he suggests that Israel wants to
ignore the Palestinians. He must be un
aware that in 1974 the Israeli Govern
ment passed a resolution which read,
"The peace will be founded on the exis
tence of two independent states only—
Israel, with united Jerusalem as its capi
tal, and a Jordanian-Palestinian Arab
state, east of Israel, within borders to
be determined in negotiations between
Israel and Jordan." Economides must
also be unaware of the countless Israeli
proposals to settle the Palestinians and

provide them with a permanent income
and government services such as health
care. He must also choose to ignore the
long history of neglect by the Arab na
tions for their own brothers. Their mo
tive is to maintain the deplorable condi
tions of the refugee camps in order to
keep the issue alive as a source of an
tagonism against Israel.
Clearly, Israelis are divided on the
question of just how the Palestinian
issue can be resolved. Prominent lead
ers such as Abba Eban have recognized
that should Israel continue to rule Gaza
and the West Bank, it will eventually
cease to be a secular Jewish state. The
emerging consensus in the Knesset
seems to support autonomy for the
Palestinians, as long as Israel's security
needs are provided for.
Economides' second assumption, his
alleged quotation by Golda Meir, re
calls the history of the creation of the
Palestinian Arab refugee problem.
What Mrs. Meir actually said was
quoted in the New York Times, )anuary
14,1976; "There is no Palestine people.
There are Palestinian refugees." The
difference is not semantic. For years
Arab nationalists excluded the possibil
ity of a separate Palestinian Arab
movement. Mrs. Meir continued to
note that, "The majority of the refugees
never left Palestine; they are settled on
the West Bank and in Jordan, the major
ity of whose population is Palestinian.
Whatever nomenclature is used, both
the people involved and the territory
on which they live are Palestinian."
Perhaps Economides needs to be re
minded that Israel only came into pos
session of the West Bank and Gaza
when it was threatened on all sides by
its Arab neighbors.

Economides' third assumption, that
the PLO is not a ruthless, bloodthirsty
terrorist organization, is most astonish
ing.
Economides should speak with the
relatives of the more than 250 Israelis,
Europeans and Americans that have
been murdered by the PLO since 1977.
Can memory be so short? Or does he
choose not to remember the slaying of
Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics or
the killing of innocent schoolchildren
in Maalot, or of innocent bus passen
gers on the beaches outside Tel Aviv,
just last year?
These are the heroic exploits of a true
national liberation movement,
Economides would have us believe. I
think that he would be less willing to so
glibly suggest that the PLO be a partner
to a negotiated peace agreement if he
had ever read the PLO national coven
ant which denies that Jews are a na
tional people with a right to statehood
(Article 20) and which calls for Arabs to
"purge the Zionist presence from
Palestine."
I would not be surprised if
Economides doesn't know that during
Secretary Vance's trip to the Middle
East in the summer of 1977, a delegation
of West Bank Palestinian leaders pre
sented him with a petition which firmly
stated that the PLO does not represent
West Bank residents.
Does the PLO "enjoy widespread
support in the Arab world," as
Economides claims? King Hussein, who
threw the PLO out of Jordan in bloody
fighting in 1971, would scarcely agree.
Neither would Hafez Assad of Syria,
who controls several strong factions
within the Palestinian movementwhich
have previously clashed with Arafat.

Nor would the Iraquis, who have re
cently directed a number of terrorist
acts and assassinations against Arafat
loyalists in Europe and the Middle East.
East.
For all their hugging and kissing be
fore the cameras of the Western Press,
if one cares to look beyond the cosme
tics, he finds deep splits between the
PLO and those Arab nations which pay
lip service to its authority.
One is then led to question; if Israel
recognizes the plight of the Palestinians
and wants to help, if the PLO is not
representative of the Palestinian Arab
population — indeed if it deserves the
censure of civilized men and women —
and if its political support in the Arab
world is truly dubious; then how can
Economides' final suggstion, that a
peace that ignores the PLO "is doomed
to fail," be valid?
I am discouraged to hear the opinion
that the PLO cannot be ignored, espe
cially when President Carter and Sadat
and Begin have recently made such
progress in their efforts towards peace.
No one denies that complicated and
difficult questions arise regarding the
issues of Jerusalem's status, Israeli set
tlements on the West Bank, and details
of Palestinian autonomy and Israeli
security arrangements. But at least we
now have a framework.
In the midst of the Arab celebration
of Ramadan, and at the outset of the
Jewish New Year, it is a particularly ap
propriate time to support the efforts of
men like Carter, Sadat and Begin, to
cast aside prejudices, and to say a silent
prayer for the peoples of the Middle
East ... a prayer for peace.
