Who Are You
The Who
MCA Records
With their new album, Who
Are You, the Who once again
justify their longevity in the
rock world, and at the same
time indirectly pronounce it. It
is not surprising that, on this
album, many of the songs re
call the general "sounds" of
their other albums. After all, a
band can only progress in so
many ways before it finds it
necessary to revert to some of,
its older styles. Of course,
there are a multitude of new
directions in which the Who
could have progressed on this
album: jazz; classical/ rock fu
sion; Muzak/rock fusion; etc.
But these ideas are akin to the
idea of Rubenstein giving rock
piano recitals.
Not thoroughly stymied,
though, the Who has for the
first time introduced promi
nent orchestrations to some of
their songs. In addition, they
have de-emphasized the lyrics.
That is not to say that Peter
Townshend's best lyrics aren't
as biting and personal and de
fiant as they always were.
Rather, the lyrics seem to have
been washed out in the mixing
of the album. On every track,
the chorus is highly intelligi
ble, and it stands out against
the instrumentation, butlisten
ing to the remainder of the
lyrics is quite difficult. Though
the vocals are relatively clear,
they seem to be overdomi
nated by the music. It appears
that the Who has decided to
emphasize the musical struc
ture of each song, a move they
can successfully make only be
cause they are as strong musi
cally as lyrically (quite an
achievement in the face of
Tommy, often considered a
classic for its lyrical theme).

The album opens with "New
Song," its weakest tune.
There's enough rock and roll
here to keep interest, though,
until the next track, "Had
Enough." "Had Enough,"
one of three tunes written by
bassist John Entwistle (making
Entwistle's writing contribu
tion to this album greater than
to any other Who album) re
calls the musical currents of
Who's Next, though it pales
when compared to the
stronger passages on that al
bum. Light strings along with
some interesting horn work by
Entwistle interweave with the
basic band to create a pleasant
sounding light rocker. Who's
Next is again brought to mind
by the balladic "Love is Com
ing Down," which is reminis
cent of "Behind Blue Eyes" (in
terestingly, it appears in the
same place on this album that
"Behind Blue Eyes," appeared
on Who's Next- third song,
second side). "Love is Coming
Down," however, is even more
mild, and is enhanced by
prominent and well arranged
orchestration.
Characteristic
"Sister Disco" is in the style
of Quadrophenia, though not
as introspective. A solid, sort of
pop-ish tune, lacking the rock
ing energy of the Who in full
force, but characteristic of
much of their better material.
The Quadrophenia sound is
also heard both on the quieter
passages of "Guitar and Pen,"
a ballad rocker which also re
calls Tommy, in both melody
and the current of alienation in
its theme, and on "Music Must
Change," a song which moves
quickly from blues to rock, and
which contains a clear example
of Townshend's tendency to
place a slow pretty bridge in a
hard rocking passage.

While Entwistle's "Trick of
the Light" is somewhat in
teresting, in the same vein as
"Won'tCet Fooled Again," but
inferior to it, his "905" is one of
the album's gems. Starting
with a great bassline, the song,
which is not unlike "Put the
Money Down" from the Odds
and Sods album, builds into a
mild-mannered funky ballad
rocker compromise. Entyistle
also sings this one (Roger Dal
try sings all the other tunes)
and proves that though he
generally does not sing much
on Who albums and his voice
lacks the drive of Daltrey's,
he's quite an adequate singer.
Finally, the album closes
with "Who Are You," which
may become the Who's biggest
hit ever. Its smooth chorus
leads into passages which are
much in the Who's defiant
style, and the (relatively) quiet
passage in the middle makes
for an interesting variation.
Not exactly like anything
they've done before, but un
mistakably the Who.
Which is, then, much like
the whole album: songs which
tread many of the Who's
beaten paths but which widen
them in the process. And when
you've been around so long
that you've already nearly
cleared the field with your
paths', that's about as good as
you can do.
