# Tuition tax credit supporters ponder new legislative strategy

### 
Washington (AP) — Backers of tax credits for college
tuition, facing a mounting veto threat, may try to save
their proposal by imbedding it in the general tax cut bill.
This strategy was being discussed as Joseph Califano,
secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, told repor
ters at the White House yesterday he would advise Pres
ident Jimmy Carter to veto the $1 billion program.
In a compromise version worked out by Senate and
House conferees, the bill would allow tax credits against
tuition paid to institutions above high school. The cre
dit, to be subtracted directly from taxes owed, could be
up to 35 percent of tuition. The maximum would be $100
this year, $150 in 1979 and $250 in 1980.
The conference dropped provisions for tax credits for
tuition to private elementary and secondary schools,
proposals which had drawn Carter's strongest fire.
But Califano made it clear the measure, which he
called ineffective and inequitable, is still unacceptable
to the administration. It would not do as much for
middle-income families as the administration alterna
tive, he contended.
However, if backers succeed in attaching the tuition
credits to the main tax cut bill, which the Senate is
scheduled to begin debating this week, Carter would be
presented with a dilemma: let the credits stand or veto

the tax relief voters have been promised.
Instead of giving tuition tax credits, Carter favors ex
panding the present federal programs of grants and
loans for college tuition and making families earning up
to $25,000 eligible. The program Carter favors also would
cost about $1 billion.
The Senate has passed the bill that Carter wants but
House leaders have held it up, waiting to see how the
dispute would be solved. The budget adopted by Con
gress for 1979 has room for either tax credits or the
Carter plan, but not both.
Since the conferees have agreed on a bill, it could be
changed now only if it were rejected by one house or the
other and a new compromise worked out. This would be
a time-consuming process unlikely in the pre
adjournment crush.
Califano said the measure produced by the confer
ence committee would provide significantly less help to
middle-income families than the Carter plan.
"A family of four earning $20,000 a year, with one child
in college, would receive $666 in a grant from HEW
under its grant program," he said. "It would receive
only, at a maximum, the $250 tax credit under the tuition
tax credit legislation."
