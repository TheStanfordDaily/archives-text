## Tarot cards provide unique poetry base 
### 
In 1664 the Italian engraver
Gioseppe Mitelli produced a
deck of lavishly detailed Tarot
cards. These engravings serve
as the subject of a fascinating
series of poems by Frederick
Morgan entitled The Tarot of
Cornelius Agrippa.
Some 20 years ago, T.S. Eliot
apologized for sending his
readers on a "wild goose chase
after Tarot cards and Holy
Grails," after having given the
deck considerable promi
nence in his notes to the Waste
Land. Nonetheless, the idea of
using the Tarot deck as the
springboard for a longer poem
remained an intriguing one
which no one attempted.
Brief meditations
The subject would seem
ideal for one of our local San
Franciscan poet-prophets (I
have no one in particular in
mind here, although there are
several who fit the descrip
tion). Frederick Morgan, how
ever, embarks on a much more
engaging approach by eschew
ing much of the foggy mysti
cism that the topic could har
bor. The poems in Morgan's
collection are brief medita
tions, each poem revolving
around a specific card in the
deck.

Morgan writes in that nebul
ous region known as the prose
poem. My past experience
with prose poems has been
somewhat disconcerting. Like
a piece of cotton-candy, which
evaporates as soon as one puts
it into his mouth, the poetry in
most "prose poems" seems to
disappear whenever one tries
to pin it down.
Pointed imagery
I am much more content
with Morgan's efforts in the
form. The poems are above all
poetic; Morgan's approach
makes room for a good deal of
pointed imagery which Mor
gan uses to its best advantage.
It is poetry of sound, smell,
touch and sight. Far from being

top-heavy with adjectives, the
prose form allows Morgan to
stretch out his impressions
over the course of several
lines.
In my dreams I have often
found myself staring across a
desolate meadow and out over
the waves of an immense iris
blue ocean extending peace
fully to the horizon. The
meadow is un-kempt, path
less, and dotted with occa
sional wild-flowers - white or
blue - adrift in the tangles of
weed and long grass.
The poems are refreshing
and rebel against being
pigeon-holed in prevailing
poetic schools. Morgan is
more reminiscent of some of

the more poetic prose writers
— Proust, or at times Aesop or
Boccaccio.
A bear who had for many
years roamed wild and free
over his native mountains was
caught one day in a clever
snare, bound fast with ropes,
and sent back to the capital,
where he waSsold to a traveling
showman.
Story form
The poems are often in story
form, but are never anecdotal.
They possess, rather, the
meditative quality one as
sociates with the biblical para
bles orzen stories. The poems
were obviously intended to
stand as a whole, but certainly
they can be read and enjoyed

on an individual basis.
The production of the vol
ume is also impressive. Each
poem is accompanied by a re
production of Mitelli's engrav
ing on the subject, while the
typesetting and paper selec
tion were done with extremfr
care. The book possesses
(which is a rarity when one
considers most of the poetry
published today) an attractive
format to match the high qua|.- (
ity of the writing.
The volume may be difficult
to find except in specialty
stores — still the effort is worth
making. The Tarot of Cornelius

sional wild-flowers - white or
blue - adrift in the tangles of
weed and long grass.
The poems are refreshing
and rebel against being
pigeon-holed in prevailing
poetic schools. Morgan is
more reminiscent of some of

the more poetic prose writers
— Proust, or at times Aesop or
Boccaccio.
A bear who had for many
years roamed wild and free
over his native mountains was
caught one day in a clever
snare, bound fast with ropes,
and sent back to the capital,
where he waSsold to a traveling
showman.
Story form
The poems are often in story
form, but are never anecdotal.
They possess, rather, the
meditative quality one as
sociates with the biblical para
bles orzen stories. The poems
were obviously intended to
stand as a whole, but certainly
they can be read and enjoyed

on an individual basis.
The production of the vol
ume is also impressive. Each
poem is accompanied by a re
production of Mitelli's engrav
ing on the subject, while the
typesetting and paper selec
tion were done with extremfr
care. The book possesses
(which is a rarity when one
considers most of the poetry
published today) an attractive
format to match the high qua|.- (
ity of the writing.
The volume may be difficult
to find except in specialty
stores — still the effort is worth
making. The Tarot of Cornelius
Agrippa is one of the most strik
ing collections of new poems I
have seen in many months.
In 1664 the Italian engraver
Gioseppe Mitelli produced a
deck of lavishly detailed Tarot
cards. These engravings serve
as the subject of a fascinating
series of poems by Frederick
Morgan entitled The Tarot of
Cornelius Agrippa.
Some 20 years ago, T.S. Eliot
apologized for sending his
readers on a "wild goose chase
after Tarot cards and Holy
Grails," after having given the
deck considerable promi
nence in his notes to the Waste
Land. Nonetheless, the idea of
using the Tarot deck as the
springboard for a longer poem
remained an intriguing one
which no one attempted.
Brief meditations
The subject would seem
ideal for one of our local San
Franciscan poet-prophets (I
have no one in particular in
mind here, although there are
several who fit the descrip
tion). Frederick Morgan, how
ever, embarks on a much more
engaging approach by eschew
ing much of the foggy mysti
cism that the topic could har
bor. The poems in Morgan's
collection are brief medita
tions, each poem revolving
around a specific card in the
deck.

Morgan writes in that nebul
ous region known as the prose
poem. My past experience
with prose poems has been
somewhat disconcerting. Like
a piece of cotton-candy, which
evaporates as soon as one puts
it into his mouth, the poetry in
most "prose poems" seems to
disappear whenever one tries
to pin it down.
Pointed imagery
I am much more content
with Morgan's efforts in the
form. The poems are above all
poetic; Morgan's approach
makes room for a good deal of
pointed imagery which Mor
gan uses to its best advantage.
It is poetry of sound, smell,
touch and sight. Far from being

top-heavy with adjectives, the
prose form allows Morgan to
stretch out his impressions
over the course of several
lines.
In my dreams I have often
found myself staring across a
desolate meadow and out over
the waves of an immense iris
blue ocean extending peace
fully to the horizon. The
meadow is un-kempt, path
less, and dotted with occa
sional wild-flowers - white or
blue - adrift in the tangles of
weed and long grass.
