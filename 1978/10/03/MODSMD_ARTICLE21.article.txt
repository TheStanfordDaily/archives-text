## Lyrics set Jefferson jazz apart 
### 
Eddie Jefferson, who will appear at the
Stanford Commons on October 7, opened
his engagement at the Keystone Korner
with an exciting, well-paced set.
lefferson has made a career out of adapt
ing lyrics to jazz standards; his lyrics range
from the witty and biting to the romantic
and serious, while his choice of tunes
shows a keen sense of discrimination. In
choosing his material, Jefferson has always
eschewed passing fads and trends and has
concentrated instead on presenting what
is simply the best music he can make.
Perhaps I am unjust in emphasizing Jef
ferson's ability as a lyricist. Jefferson's ta
lent as a singer and entertainer is doubt
less the main cause of his success. He is

constant movement on the stage — he
sings, he conducts, he dances, he scats.
His compelling appearance is further ac
centuated by his amazing voice.
He takes chances with his singing, and
as a consequence produces a wonderful
variety of tones and textures. He is not
afraid of sinking low into the bass register,
or attempting the highest falsetto. He is
one of those few performers (Stevie Won
der is another) who knows his vocal range
and then promptly forgets it. He is always
attempting the near impossible; and this
tension adds a great deal to his mag
netism.
His opening set at the Keystone dis
played some of this diversity. After several

excellent numbers by Richie Cole (an
amazing saxophonist who will be very big
in a few years) Jefferson joined the group
for the old Cannonball Adderley number
"leanine." Then they attempted a rockish
version of "Night in Tunisia," which was
followed by a trio of Charlie Parker blues
("Now's The Time," "Billie's Bounce," and
"Parker's Mood").
Richie Cole provided consistently
thoughtful sax solos during the set. His
technique is sure and fast, but never be
comes an end in itself. He plays in what is
generally classified as the "mainstream,"
and his playing crosses- over the paths
forged by those such as Sonny Stitt and
Phil Woods.
