# DEAD WEEK POLICY STATEMENT
## 
### 
Following i\a Dead Week Policy Statement adopted by the
Senate of the Academic Council on September 28, 1978 on
recommendation of the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement.
Dead Week is a period of reduced social and extra
curricular activity preceding final examinations. Its pur
pose is to permit students to concentrate on academic work
and to prepare for final examinations.
In Autumn, Winter and Spring Quarters, Dead Week be
gins on the Sunday that begins the last week of classes. In
Spring Quarter, final examinations begin on Friday; no
classes should be held on Thursday, the day before. In
Summer Quarter. Dead Week consists of the weekend and
the four class days preceding the final examinations, which
take place on Friday and Saturday of the eighth week..
During Dead Week, classes are regularly scheduled and
assignments made; this regular class time is used by in
structors in whatever way seems best suited to the comple
tion and summation of course material. Instructors should
neither make extraordinary assignments nor announce ad
ditional course meetings in order to "catch up" in course
presentations that have fallen behind. They are free, how
erver, and even encouraged to conduct optional review
sessions and to suggest other activities that might seem
appropriate for students preparing for final examinations.
No graded homework assignments, mandatory quizzes or
examinations should be given during Dead Week except:
a. In classes where graded homework assignments or
quizzes are routine parts of the instruction process;
b. In classes with laboratories where the final examina-

tion will not test the laboratory component. In such a case,
the Dead Week laboratory session(s) may be used to
examine students on that aspect of the course.*
Major papers or projects about which the student has had
reasonable notice may be called due in Dead Week.
Take-home final examinations given in place of the offi
cially scheduled in-class examination, may be distributed
in Dead Week. Although the instructor may ask students to
return take-home examinations early in the final examina
tion period, the instructor may not call them due until the
end of the regularly scheduled examination time for that
course. Such a policy respects the principle that students'
final examinations are to be scheduled over a period of
several days.
Individual circumstances may warrant alternative in
class examinations either preceding or following the for
mally scheduled examination period. Nonetheless, instruc
tors are strongly discouraged from making use of the Dead
Week period for final examinations, which not only reduces
the instruction time available for that particular course but
also substantially diminishes students' opportunities for
extensive review and synthesis of their other courses.
During Dead We*?k, no musical, dramatic or athletic
events involving compulsory student participation should
be scheduled, nor should routine committee meetings be
scheduled (such as those of the ASSU, the Senate of the
Academic Council, or the committees of the President of the
University) when such meetings normally would involve
student participation.
â€¢Note: Distinct courses of fewer than three units are covered hy the extant examination
policy, which states "examinations in one or two unit courses must foe completed by the
end of the next-to-last week of classes."
