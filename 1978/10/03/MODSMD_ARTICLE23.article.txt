## 'Fua Dia Congo' impressive opening for Black Arts 
### 
A powerful and colorful per
formance by Fua Dia Congo, an
African dance troupe from East
Palo Alto, opened Stanford's
Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts Series. It was an even
ing of African culture not soon
to be forgotten by the Stanford
community.
Led by Malonga Cas
quelourd, former lead dancer
of the National Congolese
Dance Company in Brazzaville,
the dancers responded to the
forceful rhythm of the drums.
They jumped and turned and
moved their bodies in an end
less variety of ways.
Biza Sompa, a special guest
from the Congo, was pheno
menal as he rotated his body
and agily moved across the
stage.

Not only did they dance but
there was singing as well. Their

deep voices filled the au
ditorium, creating a musical
harmony that was penetrat
ingly beautifully.
The dancers have an im
mense amount of energy that
bursts forth every minute they
are on stage. Their ability to
communicate this energy
brought an audience of ap
proximately 200 to their feet.
Dressed in traditional Afri
can garb, the dancers never
seemed to tire under the in
tense physical exertion. Each
member of the troupe has a un
ique personality and yet they
all communicate in unison.
The performance consisted
of traditional dances from the
Congo and Central Africa. The
spirit and energy of this type of
dancing is unique and
thoroughly entertaining.
Fua Dia Congo, meaning
Congolese heritage, has been

together for about two years
and has performed throughout
the Bay Area. The group came
out of a bi-weekly Congolese
dance class taught by Malonga
Casquelourd at the Nairobi In
stitute of Cultural Arts for the
Youth Services Program.
Its members are house
wives, working mothers, stu
dents and professionals. Most
of the people in the group have
never been dancers. Faye
Knox, one of the dancers of the
group, said they are a unique
synthesis of African and
American born peoples and
that hopefully, with their per
formance, relations would be
improved between the Stan
ford and East Palo Alto com
munities.
On October 11, the Commit
tee on Black Performing Arts
will present Clamma Dale, sop
rano.

moved their bodies in an end
less variety of ways.
Biza Sompa, a special guest
from the Congo, was pheno
menal as he rotated his body
and agily moved across the
stage.

Not only did they dance but
there was singing as well. Their

deep voices filled the au
ditorium, creating a musical
harmony that was penetrat
ingly beautifully.
The dancers have an im
mense amount of energy that
bursts forth every minute they
are on stage. Their ability to
communicate this energy
brought an audience of ap
proximately 200 to their feet.
Dressed in traditional Afri
can garb, the dancers never
seemed to tire under the in
tense physical exertion. Each
member of the troupe has a un
ique personality and yet they
all communicate in unison.
The performance consisted
of traditional dances from the
Congo and Central Africa. The
spirit and energy of this type of
dancing is unique and
thoroughly entertaining.
Fua Dia Congo, meaning
Congolese heritage, has been

together for about two years
and has performed throughout
the Bay Area. The group came
out of a bi-weekly Congolese
dance class taught by Malonga
Casquelourd at the Nairobi In
stitute of Cultural Arts for the
Youth Services Program.
Its members are house
wives, working mothers, stu
dents and professionals. Most
of the people in the group have
never been dancers. Faye
Knox, one of the dancers of the
group, said they are a unique
synthesis of African and
American born peoples and
that hopefully, with their per
formance, relations would be
improved between the Stan
ford and East Palo Alto com
munities.
On October 11, the Commit
tee on Black Performing Arts
will present Clamma Dale, sop
rano.
