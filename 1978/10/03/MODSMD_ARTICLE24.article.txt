Sadat invites Carter to Egypt
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said
yesterday President Jimmy Carter has accepted an invita
tion to come to Egypt for the signing of an Egyptian-
Israeli peace treaty resulting from the historic Camp
David accords.
The White House said Carter wants to attend the sign
ing, but press secretary Jody Powell said he did not know
if it will be held in Egypt.
Authorities said any Carter visit to Egypt depends on
how quickly Egypt and Israel can forge a treaty to end 30
years of war in the Mideast. The talks are to open at the
ministerial level in Washington Oct. 12 with a projected
settlement by Dec. 17. The United States will be a full
participant, Powell said.
Sadat also had harsh words for Arab leaders critical of
the Camp David accords and who call him a traitor for
signing the agreement with Israel.
He called Col. Moammar Khadafy of Libya "a crazy
child.
He invited King Hussein of Jordan to "assume his
responsibilities. I invite Syrian officials to take part in the
talks so as to deal with the Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights," he said.
Heavy fighting continues in Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Under the cover of one of Beirut's
fiercest artillery and rocket attacks in recent memory,
Syrian troops yesterday rescued 50 fellow soldiers who
had been trapped for two days by Christian militiamen.
Rightists said 32 Lebanese were killed and more than
200 wounded in the clashes. Sixteen buildings were de
molished and 61 apartments were set on fire as the
Syrians advanced.
The heavy barrage of artillery rockets, mortars and
machine guns subsided at daybreak, but all routes into
Christian East Beirut were blocked by the Syrian
roadblocks and sniper fire.
Supreme Court begins new term
Washington — The Supreme Court, beginning its new
term by taking action in more than 800 legal disputes,
said yesterday it will decide whether police may stop
motorists to make random checks for driver licenses and
car registrations.
In one of the busiest days in its 188-year history, the
nation's highest court also:
— Refused to disturb an Illinois law barring prospec
tive fathers from the hospital delivery room when their
wives' giving birth involves surgery.
— Cleared the way for reputed Mafia figure Anthony
Ciacalone, a prominent figure in FBI investigations into
the 1975 disappearance of former Teamsters boss Jimmy
Hoffa, to be imprisoned for tax evasion.
— Left intact a court-ordered plan that forces the
Philadelphia Police Department to hire one woman for
every four men.
— Indicated that it sees constitutional problems in
state laws that ban virtually all advertising by veterina
rians and veterinary clinics.

Landslide rocks Laguna Beach homes
Laguna Beach — A massive landslide jolted this fash
ionable seaside resort yesterday, sending at least 24 ex
pensive homes cascading down hillsides and leaving
others teetering precariously on crumbling cliffs.
Several persons were injured and dozens of families
were forced to flee their homes in nightclothes when the
rumbling, predawn slide shattered the stillness of mist
shrouded Blue Bird Canyon.
About 24 homes in the $100,000 to $300,000 range were
destroyed and at least six others were damaged, said
police officials after surveying the devastated neighbor
hood. Several more homes were possibly endangered
by the mysterious slide, which struck at 5:50 a.m. and
continued to creep throughout the day.
Huey Newton bail request denied
Oakland — The judge who sat through a verbal tirade
by Huey Newton this weekend denied the Black Panther
leader's bid to be released on bail pending sentencing
on his conviction of illegal gun possession.
Judge Joseph Karesh of Alameda County Superior
Court said his decision to keep Newton in jail was not
based on Newton's outburst in court Friday. Judge
Karesh said it was "routine" for a defendant to be held in
custody after conviction and prior to sentencing.
Newton was convicted Friday of being an ex-felon in
possession of a handgun.
When Karesh ordered Newton jailed, the 36-year-old
defendant called the judge a "racist Southern cracker"
during a 20-minute outburst.
Newton is scheduled to stand trial next month in the
1974 fatal shooting of a 16-year-old Oakland prostitute.
Yankees win A.L. East playoff
Boston — Bucky Dent rallied the New York Yankees
with a three-run homer in the seventh inning and Reggie
Jackson applied the finishing touch with a home run in
the eighth as the 1977 World Series champions hung on
for a 5-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox and won the
American League East title in a playoff yesterday.
The Yankees, East champions for the third straight
year, will begin the best-of-five AL championship playoff
series at Kansas City against the Royals tonight.
Stock rise moderate in quiet session
New York — Bluechip and glamor issues led the stock
market to a moderate gain yesterday in the quietest
session in nearly three months.
Analysts said activity was limited partly by the obser
vance of the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashana.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 5.54
to 871.36.
Today's weather
Cooler. Fair through tomorrow except fog or low
clouds along the coast extending locally inland late night
and morning. Lows in the 50s to low 60s. Highs in the 60s
near the coast to the 80s inland. Westerly winds to 20
mph afternoons and evenings.
