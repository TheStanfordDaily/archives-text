# New laws to forbid searches
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer News analysis 
The decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court not to rehear the Stanford
Daily case "tells Congress it's their
turn to do something," Daily editor
Craig Dennis said yesterday.
While the U.S. Supreme Court has
refused to interpret the First and
Fourth Amendments as prohibiting
newsroom or other non-suspect
searches, it did leave room for legis
lative measures to limit such
searches at both the federal and state
levels.
In fact, the California state legisla
ture did not wait for the final word in
the case which was handed down by
the court yesterday. On Sept. 23
Governor Jerry Brown signed into
law a bill which effectively outlaws
newsroom searches.
Similar bills pending
Bills similar to the California mea
sure are pending in the U.S. House
of Representatives and the U.S. Se
nate, though it is unlikely they will be
acted upon until next year.
Prior to the enactment of the
California law, newsmen had been
protected by Section 1070 of the
State Evidence Code from contempt
citations for failing to comply with a
subpoena for any "unpublished
materials" or for failing to disclose
the identity of a news source.
Perhaps because of these restric
tions and because of fears that evi
dence could be destroyed or hidden,
district attorneys have resorted to
using search warrants on news or
ganizations in recent years.
It was Louis Bergna, district attor
ney for Santa Clara County, who ob
tained the warrant which was used to
search Daily offices seven years ago.
He admitted fears that any photo
graphic evidence the Daily might
have had concerning the 1971 de
monstration at the Stanford Hospital
wOuld be destroyed. "This had a lot
to do with how we proceeded in the
case," he said in a recent interview.
While it previously had been the
policy of the Daily to destroy poten
tially incriminating photographs,
Bergna was not aware at the time of
the search that the policy had been
changed. In any event, the Daily has
always contended that it has never
been its policy to destroy evidence
under subpoena.
Subpoenas hard to obtain
Bergna explained, however, that
subpoenas cannot be issued under
California law unless there is an ac
tion pending. If thereare no suspects
in a case, it becomes very difficult to

obtain a subpoena.
When Bergna obtained the war
rant to search the Daily offices he was
still looking for suspects and hoped
to find them in photographs that
Daily photographers had taken dur
ing the demonstration.
Now, because of the recently ap
proved California law, not only are
California newsmen exempt from
contempt citations for not complying
with a subpoena for "unpublished
materials," but news offices in this
state cannot be searched for these
materials. "Unpublished informa
tion" is defined as "all notes, photo
graphs, tapes, or other data of what
soever sort not itself disseminated,"
according to the state Evidence
Code.
This covers "anything you would
obtain during your work as a repor
ter," according to Bill Siemer of the
California Newspaper Publishers'
Association who lobbied for the bill.
'Limited to news media'
Siemer said some thought had
been given to expanding protection
from such searches to all non
suspect third parties, but that the
bill, known as AB 512, was "specifi
cally limited to news media."
Illinois also has introduced a simi
lar measure to protect newsmen, but
a legislative aide for Governor James
Thompson, said the measure is
probably dead for this session. The
aide added she was not sure it would
be reintroduced next session.
The U.S. Department of Justice has
pledged itself to restraint in cases
where they wish to obtain informa
tion from news organizations. It is
their policy not to issue search war
rants against print and broadcast
media, but rather to obtain evidence
through subpoenas despite the court
ruling which allows searches.
Federal legislators nevertheless
are working on bills that would limit
federal and possibly state law en
forcement agencies in searches of
non-suspect third parties.
House subcommittee recommends
The House Subcommittee on
Government Information and Indi
vidual Rights issued a report in Au
gust recommending that any legisla
tion that is intended to curtail the
effects of the Daily case should in
clude the following principles:
— A search warrant should not be
issued against any third party when
there is not reasonable cause to be
lieve that person has committed a
crime or that the person will destroy
or hide evidence.
— The law should apply to state
and local officials as well as federal

law enforcement officials, if this is
constitutionally feasible.
— The protection against un
reasonable third-party searches
should extend to all citizens, not just
newsmen or others with professional
privileges.
18 bills introduced
So far 18 separate bills have been
introduced in the House this year,
according to an aide for Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Calit.).
McCloskey was one of the first to
introduce a bill of this type. His press
secretary Michele Farrar said that
getting his bill or one like it through
Congress is his number one priority
in 1979. Farrar noted that it is doubt
ful Congress will get to any such
legislation this session.
The majority of the bills protect
only the print or broadcast media,
though McCloskey, among others,
has introduced bills that also protect
private citizens from such searches.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lndiana) also
has introduced a bill similar to
McCloskey's in the Senate,
Some journalists relieved
Some people, especially jour
nalists, are relieved that legislation is
pending that would curtail the ef
fects of the Stanford Daily case.
However, some fear that measure
such as statutory law cannot possibly
protect their freedoms permanently,
since such laws can be more easily
changed than constitutions.
Many law enforcement officials,
on the other hand, see legislatures
denying them rights they always had.
For them, the new bills are again
placing obstacles in their path which
prevent them from catching "the bad
guys."
