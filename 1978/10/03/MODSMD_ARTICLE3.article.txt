# Locals oppose plans for 'Sand Hill Expressway'
## 
### ANDREA JAMES ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writers 
Palo Alto citycouncilmen last night
heard arguments against the prop
osed expansion of Sand Hill Road
from a two-lane thoroughfare into a
four-lane expressway.
"There is insufficient justification
for the project," claimed Palo Alto
engineer Joseph Carleton. "The vol
ume of traffic on Sand Hill Road will
increase but the intersections on that
road will still have a backup."
In January, the council approved
the $6.6 million project which in
cludes separate bike-pedestrian
paths on both sides of the proposed
four-lane road between the Sand
Hill-Santa Cruz intersection in Menlo
Park to El Camino Real in Palo Alto.
Defects in report
However, Carleton and another
Palo Alto citizen subsequently filed
suit charging defects in the environ
mental impact report (EIR). Coun
cilmen are scheduled to vote on the
supplemental EIR next Tuesday
night.
If the project is approved, the Uni
versity has agreed to pay for the ex
tension of Campus Drive from the
Medical Center to Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
In addition, the University has
pledged to use a 46-acre parcel of
land off Sand Hill Road between the
Oak Creek Apartments and the Chil
dren's Hospital for a housing com
plex which will help ease the local
shortage.
Citizens claim backup
But citizens speaking before the
council last night were generally op
posed to the widening of the road,
claiming the project will simply cause
a four-lane backup rather than a
two-lane traffic jam at the bottleneck
Santa Cruz-Sand Hill Road intersec

tion.
"The bottleneck is at this intersec
tion and is not the two-lane road,"
Carleton said.
Residents also said the plan did not
take into consideration the Universi
ty's planned construction of the Sand
Hill Road apartments.
Original plans for the expansion
stated the road would ease conges
tion along Sand Hill Road and would
provide easier access to local
facilities, namely the 190,000 square
foot enlargement of Stanford Shop
ping Center.
Increased traffic flow
Residents of Oak Creek Apart
ments say this increased flow of traf
ficwould decrease the quality of life.
Resident Lou Fine even suggested
the Oak Creek Apartments be de
clared a "negative assessment dis
trict," with the city paying landlords'
depreciation costs.
"The project will increase traffic,
noise and air pollution but will keep
congestion the same," Fine said.
Consultants argue that air quality
will improve whether or not the pro
ject is approved.
"Air quality is getting better all the
time simply because of the congres
sionally mandated emission control
standards," said Doug Donaldson of
the Environmental Impact Planning
Corporation.
Other spokesmen for the consult
ing firm said they agreed with citi
zens' comments that the intersec
tions were a major problem but
added thattheiranalysis had showed
it was not the entire cause of conges
tion.
Consultants also reported that dur
ing peak times the increased traffic
caused by the four-lane road would
congest the intersections, but that
during non-rush hours, traffic flow
would be enhanced.
