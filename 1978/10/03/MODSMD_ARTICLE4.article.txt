# Supreme Court refuses Daily rehearing motion
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday
ended the seven-year litigation in
volving a search of the offices of The
Stanford Daily by Palo Alto police by
denying the Daily's petition to re
consider its ruling that police
searches of newsrooms are legal.
"There's nothing else we can do
(in the courts)," Daily editor Craig
Dennis said. He added that he was
disappointed the court "didn't pay
serious enough attention to the ar
guments in our petition. I will always
hold that the search of our offices
was an unreasonable one."
Last May, the high court ruled
against the Daily, saying the 1971
search of Daily offices by police was
legal, and that neither news organi
zations nor any other third party not
accused of a crime are protected
from police searches under the
Fourth Amendment. The decision
reversed two lower court rulings
which had labeled such searches un
constitutional.
The rehearing petition filed by
Daily lawyers asked the court to re
consider its original conclusions, but
if the court were unwilling to do that,
at least to answer the question of
whether this particular search was
reasonable. The Daily lawyers felt

that the court had neglected this part
of the case.
In their brief Daily lawyers argued
that before the lower court rulings
can be reversed there must be "an
examination of this search on these
facts to determine whether it — and
not simply the idea of third party
searches — passes constitutional
muster."
The Supreme Court's decision also
stated, "Hazards of such (third party
search) warrants can be avoided by a
neutral magistrate . . . for he has
ample tools at his disposal to confine
warrants to search within reasonable
limits."
Daily lawyers, however, ques
tioned the ability of local judges:
— to decide on the "reasonable
ness" of third party searches and,
— to limit the scope of such
searches to the documents or items
sought
No specific guidelines
Daily lawyers, however, ques
tioned the ability of local judges:
— to decide on the "reasonable
ness" of third party searches
and,
— to limit the scope of such
searches to the documents or
items sought,
because the court's opinion provides
no specific guidelines for judges to

follow under such circumstances.
The justices in their May 31 opin
ion explained, "Properly adminis
tered, the preconditions for a war
rant — probable cause, specificity
with respect to the place to be
searched and the things to be seized,
and overall reasonableness —
should afford sufficient protection
against the harms that are assertedly
threatened by warrants for searching
newspaper offices."
Unannounced searches disruptive
The Daily contended that such un
announced searches disrupted nor
mal operations and allowed police to
see unrelated and potentially confi
dential information during their
search. Because of this, the Daily ar
gued that such searches imperiled
freedom of the press.
In the arguments and briefs pre
sented to the Supreme Court the
Daily contended that searches of
third parties such as newspapers,
lawyers, doctors, psychiatrists and
private citizens not involved in the
commission of a crime should not be
allowed, except under very unusual
circumstances.
The Federal District and Appellate
Courts set the standards for such
warrants saying they could be ob
tained for third parties only if (1)
there were a clear showing that evi
dence in their possession would be
destroyed, hidden or otherwise re
moved from the court's jurisdiction
and (2) that a restraining order would
be futile. In all other cases, a sub
poena, which can be challenged in
court, was to be used.
'Sweeping revision'
The Supreme Court, however, re
jected this conclusion calling it a
"sweeping revision of the Fourth
Amendment."
The Supreme Court's action does
not prohibit other legislative efforts
to control third party searches.
California recently passed a bill
which outlaws such newsroom
searches. National legislation is also
pending to prohibit newsroom and
other third party searches.
Although the Daily is not required
to pay attorneys' fees for the oppos
ing side, they will be required to pay
court and printing costs for the Sup
reme Court phase of the litigation
which amounts to almost $4400.
Of this amount about $2000 has al
ready been paid, according to De
nnis. The money has so far come
from donations to the Daily's legal
defense fund, Dennis said.
Daily lawyers have worked without
a fee during the entire seven-year
litigation.
