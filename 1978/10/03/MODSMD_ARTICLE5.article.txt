# Med School alters admissions policy
## 
### 
Last night the Medical School
Faculty Senate voted to change its
minority admissions policy, effec
tive beginning the 1978-79
academic year.
Responding to the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Bakke
case, the senate attempted to
"sustain its commitment to minor
ity admissions" and comply with
new federal regulations by
eliminating its Minority Admis
sions Committee (MAC) in favor
of a single, expanded central Ad
missions Committee.
According to a Med Center
news release describing the old
policy, the Med School Faculty
Senate had "set as a minimal goal
the admission of at least 20 per
cent of each entering class" from
minority groups, specifically
blacks, Chicanos and native

Americans. MAC had been re
sponsible for the separate proces
sing, screening and accepting of
these minority students into the
entering class.
The recent Supreme Court rul
ing, however, outlawed the use of
strict racial quotas in admissions
policies, although it upheld affir
mative action programs in gen
eral. The Med School feared that
their 20 percent goal might be
considered a quota under the
court's decision and thus be un
constitutional.
The newly established commit
tee will now consider all applic
ants as a group. Also, while the
earlier committee had 12 faculty
members and three student
members, the new group can in
addition have up to 15 faculty
members.
