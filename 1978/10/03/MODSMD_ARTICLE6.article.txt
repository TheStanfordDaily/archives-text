# Carnegie plant research may benefit you

### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
"Devoted to improving man
kind" is a popular phrase on col
lege campuses today. It is evident
in university statements of
philosophy and in "think tanks"
like Hoover Institution.
Similarly, the Washington D.C.
Carnegie Institute was founded in
1902 to spread knowledge for the
improvement of mankind. And
while studying photosynthesis in
plants may seem an unlikely way
to carry out this goal, research at
Carnegie's Institute of Plant Biol
ogy here indeed may be carrying
on the "improvement of man
kind" philosophy of philan
thropist Andrew Carnegie.
Since 1929, Stanford has leased
10 acres of land near Searsville
Road to the plant biology
laboratories for $100 a month. Al
though this landlordship is the
University's only official connec
tion with Carnegie, several
graduate and 12 post doctoral
students here work at the insti
tute. In addition, some Carnegie
faculty-staff members have cour
tesy professorships on campus.
Three areas of study
"Our seven full-time faculty
members are exploring three dif
ferent areas of plant biology,"
said the institute's director and
Stanford Biological Science Prof.
Winslow Briggs. "Areas include
plant physiological ecology, the
organization of plant DNA and the
influence of light on plant de
velopment, namely photo
tropism."
In Carnegie's three laboratory
buildings and mobile lab, faculty
members study temperature
stress on plants, searching for the
chemicals and plant structures
which enable some organisms to

thrive in climates such as Death
Valley and Bodega Bay. Here, the
mobile lab becomes a necessity.
The mobile lab is a remodeled
Winnebago presently connected
to the permanent buildings at the
institute. At times, the "motor
lab" is taken off Stanford land for
on-the-spot research.
No moral problems
The study of plant DNA "hardly
contains" the moral and ethnical
problems inherent in research of
animal DNA, Briggs said.
"We certainly won't get a P-2
security facility to study plant
DNA," he laughed. "Cloning
plants has already been done.
We're more interested in under
standing the translation of genetic
materials."
The scientists are also research
ing phototropism — the move
ment of plants toward a light
source — and other ways in which
light affects plant biology.
The three laboratory buildings
are adjacent to a seminar room
and several specialized
greenhouses, which can dupli
cate almost any environmental
condition, Briggs said.
Open fields used
Several acres of open fields are
also used by the Carnegie faculty
for plant research.
"One of the best subjects for
plant research is the oleander,"
Briggs said. Miles of oleander
bushes next to California's high
ways have shown little damage
over the past several years, prov
ing that the plant is a sturdy,
adaptable organism, he added.
The Carnegie Institute of Plant
Biology hosts about 100 interna
tional scientists on its grounds
each year. "We're small, but
well-known," Briggs said with
pride.

condition, Briggs said.
Open fields used
Several acres of open fields are
also used by the Carnegie faculty
for plant research.
"One of the best subjects for
plant research is the oleander,"
Briggs said. Miles of oleander
bushes next to California's high
ways have shown little damage
over the past several years, prov
ing that the plant is a sturdy,
adaptable organism, he added.
The Carnegie Institute of Plant
Biology hosts about 100 interna
tional scientists on its grounds
each year. "We're small, but
well-known," Briggs said with
pride.

"Devoted to improving man
kind" is a popular phrase on col
lege campuses today. It is evident
in university statements of
philosophy and in "think tanks"
like Hoover Institution.
Similarly, the Washington D.C.
Carnegie Institute was founded in
1902 to spread knowledge for the
improvement of mankind. And
while studying photosynthesis in
plants may seem an unlikely way
to carry out this goal, research at
Carnegie's Institute of Plant Biol
ogy here indeed may be carrying
on the "improvement of man
kind" philosophy of philan
thropist Andrew Carnegie.
Since 1929, Stanford has leased
10 acres of land near Searsville
Road to the plant biology
laboratories for $100 a month. Al
though this landlordship is the
University's only official connec
tion with Carnegie, several
graduate and 12 post doctoral
students here work at the insti
tute. In addition, some Carnegie
faculty-staff members have cour
tesy professorships on campus.
Three areas of study
"Our seven full-time faculty
members are exploring three dif
ferent areas of plant biology,"
said the institute's director and
Stanford Biological Science Prof.
Winslow Briggs. "Areas include
plant physiological ecology, the
organization of plant DNA and the
influence of light on plant de
velopment, namely photo
tropism."
In Carnegie's three laboratory
buildings and mobile lab, faculty
members study temperature
stress on plants, searching for the
chemicals and plant structures
which enable some organisms to

thrive in climates such as Death
Valley and Bodega Bay. Here, the
mobile lab becomes a necessity.
The mobile lab is a remodeled
Winnebago presently connected
to the permanent buildings at the
institute. At times, the "motor
lab" is taken off Stanford land for
on-the-spot research.
No moral problems
The study of plant DNA "hardly
contains" the moral and ethnical
problems inherent in research of
animal DNA, Briggs said.
"We certainly won't get a P-2
security facility to study plant
DNA," he laughed. "Cloning
plants has already been done.
We're more interested in under
standing the translation of genetic
materials."
The scientists are also research
ing phototropism — the move
ment of plants toward a light
source — and other ways in which
light affects plant biology.
The three laboratory buildings
are adjacent to a seminar room
and several specialized
greenhouses, which can dupli
cate almost any environmental
condition, Briggs said.
