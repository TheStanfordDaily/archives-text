# Youth robs bank with unloaded gun, fake bomb
## 'Confused jury' acquits student in 'fluke case' 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior Staff Writer News Analysis 
Last November, six months
after giving a valedictorian
speech to his senior class, a
young man from Palo Alto at
tempted to rob Wells Fargo
Bank in Menlo Park of $75,000.
"Armed" with an unloaded
gun and fake bomb, he
threatened to blow up the
building if he did not receive
the money. He got the cash,
but was caught by police as he
backed out of the bank head
ing for his getaway car.
About two weeks ago, a
San Mateo County jury acquit
ted 19-year-old Steven
Masover. Meanwhile,
Masover's accomplice and
get-away-car driver, 21-year
old Mark Hopkins of Cuper
tino, had pleaded guilty in a
federal court to aiding and
abetting an unarmed bank
robbery. While Masover is cur
rently attending University of
California-Berkeley as a
freshman, Hopkins is working
400 hours as a community vol
unteer and is serving five years
probation.
This case was, by all stan

dards, a fluke. The decision by
the county jury could not have
been reached had it not been
for superb defense arguments,
an indadequate prosecution
and a confused jury, admitted
William Larsen, chief criminal
deputy district attorney of San
Mateo County.
Larsen and Masover's attor
ney, Read Ambler, agreed the
jury's decision came as a result
of two points. First, psychiat
rists testing Masover showed
he intended to give the money
back, with earned interest,
after he had invested it in the
stock market, made "a fortune
and started an altruistic found
ation devoted to colonizing the
stars." "Earned interest must
equal the amount the money
would have earned had it been
invested in a savings account,
Larsen said. One provision in
the statutes concerning robbery
states that property must be
taken with the intention of
"permanently depriving" the
victim.
Second, Ambler attempted
to convince the jury that
Masover was of "diminished
capacity" at the time of the
robbery. Three of four

psychoanalyists testifying dur
ing the trial agreed that
Masover was indeed of di
minished capacity, particularly
in his "ability to determine re
ality," they said.
Ambler also said the jury was
swayed by Masover's charac
ter.
"Steve debated heavily with
himself as to whether he
wanted to become a rabbi or a
physicist," Amber said in an in
terview last week. "He was an
indealistic boy on all terms, but
he was honest. The kids liked
him and didn't see him as
being too straight."
Moreover, Masover is bril
liant. As a national merit semi
finalist, he had a choice of at
tending any one of several uni
versities across the country. He
could have, and may still have,
a future of tremendous suc
cess. The jury evidently saw
him as a model teenager with a
few mental problems.
Ambler said diminished
capacity probably influenced
the jury more than the "per
manent deprivation" aspect of
the case.
"One of the psychiatrists
who tested Steve just a few

days after the robbery testified
that he was normal in all re
spects except in his ability to
determine reality, which
ranked below the fifth percen
tile," Ambler said.
Masover is now undergoing
psychiatric treatment while at
tending college and has al
ready shown a marked im
provement in his reality tests,
Ambler said.
"Our psychiatrist tests were
so convincing that the case was
thrown out of a federal court
because the federal prosecutor
was so sure he didn't even have
a case," Ambler said. "Only
one psychiatrist testified Steve
was a perfectly normal kid with
some grandiose political
schemes."
That psychiatrist, Dr. Richard
Fisch, of Palo Alto, saw
Masover for about one hour,
six months after the robbery.
"Steve was not mentally dis
turbed at the time of the rob
bery, but is instead an idealis
tic, overzealous boy with gran
diose ideas," Fisch said last
week. "In any legal sense,
Masover was not mentally in
capable during the robbery."
Another psychiatrist's tes

timony, that of Dr. James
Misset, strengthened the case
for Masover's defense. After
revealing Masover's plans for
the money, Misset was asked
by Phil Cronin, district attorney
and prosecutor in the case, if
Masover's plans included
using the bank's money during
the next 20 years. Misset
answered "yes" and Cronin
went on to try to prove this
meant "permanent depriva
tion."
The jury was totally con
fused. The foreman asked the
presiding judge for an exact
meaning of permanent depri
vation. All parties, including
Cronin, agreed the jurors must

decide for themselves upon an
exact meaning.
Cronin is no longer with the
district attorney's office. Lar
sen admitted friction occurred
between he and Cronin regard
ing the case.
"Cronin did not adequately
inform the jury on all aspects of
the case," Larsen said. "Cronin
should have insisted that the
jury be told permanent depri
vation means putting the
money to substantial tisk,
which I consider the stock
market to be."
Larsen also said that Cronin
should have properly in
structed the jury on testimony
given by both the psychiatrists

and by the accomplice, Hop
kins, that Masover intended to
give the money back.
"All that was hearsay tes
timony," Larsen said.
Since the jury didn't have
those instructions, the student
was acquitted because he said
he was going to return the
money.
Now rumor might indicate
that in the United States, if you
rob a bank and are caught in
the process you can be acquit
ted if you say you intended to
return the money with interest.
Don't bet on it. The road to
Hell, and to prison, is paved
with good intentions.

Steven Masover, a Palo Alto youth who attempted to rob Wells Fargo Bank in Menlo Park of $75,000 last
November, presently attends University of California-Berkeley as a freshman. His recent acquittal by a
San Mateo County jury was deemed 'a fluke.'
Last November, six months
after giving a valedictorian
speech to his senior class, a
young man from Palo Alto at
tempted to rob Wells Fargo
Bank in Menlo Park of $75,000.
"Armed" with an unloaded
gun and fake bomb, he
threatened to blow up the
building if he did not receive
the money. He got the cash,
but was caught by police as he
backed out of the bank head
ing for his getaway car.
About two weeks ago, a
San Mateo County jury acquit
ted 19-year-old Steven
Masover. Meanwhile,
Masover's accomplice and
get-away-car driver, 21-year
old Mark Hopkins of Cuper
tino, had pleaded guilty in a
federal court to aiding and
abetting an unarmed bank
robbery. While Masover is cur
rently attending University of
California-Berkeley as a
freshman, Hopkins is working
400 hours as a community vol
unteer and is serving five years
probation.
This case was, by all stan

dards, a fluke. The decision by
the county jury could not have
been reached had it not been
for superb defense arguments,
an indadequate prosecution
and a confused jury, admitted
William Larsen, chief criminal
deputy district attorney of San
Mateo County.
Larsen and Masover's attor
ney, Read Ambler, agreed the
jury's decision came as a result
of two points. First, psychiat
rists testing Masover showed
he intended to give the money
back, with earned interest,
after he had invested it in the
stock market, made "a fortune
and started an altruistic found
ation devoted to colonizing the
stars." "Earned interest must
equal the amount the money
would have earned had it been
invested in a savings account,
Larsen said. One provision in
the statutes concerning robbery
states that property must be
taken with the intention of
"permanently depriving" the
victim.
Second, Ambler attempted
to convince the jury that
Masover was of "diminished
capacity" at the time of the
robbery. Three of four

psychoanalyists testifying dur
ing the trial agreed that
Masover was indeed of di
minished capacity, particularly
in his "ability to determine re
ality," they said.
Ambler also said the jury was
swayed by Masover's charac
ter.
"Steve debated heavily with
himself as to whether he
wanted to become a rabbi or a
physicist," Amber said in an in
terview last week. "He was an
indealistic boy on all terms, but
he was honest. The kids liked
him and didn't see him as
being too straight."
Moreover, Masover is bril
liant. As a national merit semi
finalist, he had a choice of at
tending any one of several uni
versities across the country. He
could have, and may still have,
a future of tremendous suc
cess. The jury evidently saw
him as a model teenager with a
few mental problems.
Ambler said diminished
capacity probably influenced
the jury more than the "per
manent deprivation" aspect of
the case.
"One of the psychiatrists
who tested Steve just a few

days after the robbery testified
that he was normal in all re
spects except in his ability to
determine reality, which
ranked below the fifth percen
tile," Ambler said.
Masover is now undergoing
psychiatric treatment while at
tending college and has al
ready shown a marked im
provement in his reality tests,
Ambler said.
"Our psychiatrist tests were
so convincing that the case was
thrown out of a federal court
because the federal prosecutor
was so sure he didn't even have
a case," Ambler said. "Only
one psychiatrist testified Steve
was a perfectly normal kid with
some grandiose political
schemes."
That psychiatrist, Dr. Richard
Fisch, of Palo Alto, saw
Masover for about one hour,
six months after the robbery.
"Steve was not mentally dis
turbed at the time of the rob
bery, but is instead an idealis
tic, overzealous boy with gran
diose ideas," Fisch said last
week. "In any legal sense,
Masover was not mentally in
capable during the robbery."
Another psychiatrist's tes

timony, that of Dr. James
Misset, strengthened the case
for Masover's defense. After
revealing Masover's plans for
the money, Misset was asked
by Phil Cronin, district attorney
and prosecutor in the case, if
Masover's plans included
using the bank's money during
the next 20 years. Misset
answered "yes" and Cronin
went on to try to prove this
meant "permanent depriva
tion."
The jury was totally con
fused. The foreman asked the
presiding judge for an exact
meaning of permanent depri
vation. All parties, including
Cronin, agreed the jurors must

decide for themselves upon an
exact meaning.
Cronin is no longer with the
district attorney's office. Lar
sen admitted friction occurred
between he and Cronin regard
ing the case.
"Cronin did not adequately
inform the jury on all aspects of
the case," Larsen said. "Cronin
should have insisted that the
jury be told permanent depri
vation means putting the
money to substantial tisk,
which I consider the stock
market to be."
Larsen also said that Cronin
should have properly in
structed the jury on testimony
given by both the psychiatrists

and by the accomplice, Hop
kins, that Masover intended to
give the money back.
"All that was hearsay tes
timony," Larsen said.
Since the jury didn't have
those instructions, the student
was acquitted because he said
he was going to return the
money.
Now rumor might indicate
that in the United States, if you
rob a bank and are caught in
the process you can be acquit
ted if you say you intended to
return the money with interest.
Don't bet on it. The road to
Hell, and to prison, is paved
with good intentions.

Steven Masover, a Palo Alto youth who attempted to rob Wells Fargo Bank in Menlo Park of $75,000 last
November, presently attends University of California-Berkeley as a freshman. His recent acquittal by a
San Mateo County jury was deemed 'a fluke.'
Last November, six months
after giving a valedictorian
speech to his senior class, a
young man from Palo Alto at
tempted to rob Wells Fargo
Bank in Menlo Park of $75,000.
"Armed" with an unloaded
gun and fake bomb, he
threatened to blow up the
building if he did not receive
the money. He got the cash,
but was caught by police as he
backed out of the bank head
ing for his getaway car.
About two weeks ago, a
San Mateo County jury acquit
ted 19-year-old Steven
Masover. Meanwhile,
Masover's accomplice and
get-away-car driver, 21-year
old Mark Hopkins of Cuper
tino, had pleaded guilty in a
federal court to aiding and
abetting an unarmed bank
robbery. While Masover is cur
rently attending University of
California-Berkeley as a
freshman, Hopkins is working
400 hours as a community vol
unteer and is serving five years
probation.
This case was, by all stan

dards, a fluke. The decision by
the county jury could not have
been reached had it not been
for superb defense arguments,
an indadequate prosecution
and a confused jury, admitted
William Larsen, chief criminal
deputy district attorney of San
Mateo County.
Larsen and Masover's attor
ney, Read Ambler, agreed the
jury's decision came as a result
of two points. First, psychiat
rists testing Masover showed
he intended to give the money
back, with earned interest,
after he had invested it in the
stock market, made "a fortune
and started an altruistic found
ation devoted to colonizing the
stars." "Earned interest must
equal the amount the money
would have earned had it been
invested in a savings account,
Larsen said. One provision in
the statutes concerning robbery
states that property must be
taken with the intention of
"permanently depriving" the
victim.
Second, Ambler attempted
to convince the jury that
Masover was of "diminished
capacity" at the time of the
robbery. Three of four

psychoanalyists testifying dur
ing the trial agreed that
Masover was indeed of di
minished capacity, particularly
in his "ability to determine re
ality," they said.
Ambler also said the jury was
swayed by Masover's charac
ter.
"Steve debated heavily with
himself as to whether he
wanted to become a rabbi or a
physicist," Amber said in an in
terview last week. "He was an
indealistic boy on all terms, but
he was honest. The kids liked
him and didn't see him as
being too straight."
Moreover, Masover is bril
liant. As a national merit semi
finalist, he had a choice of at
tending any one of several uni
versities across the country. He
could have, and may still have,
a future of tremendous suc
cess. The jury evidently saw
him as a model teenager with a
few mental problems.
Ambler said diminished
capacity probably influenced
the jury more than the "per
manent deprivation" aspect of
the case.
"One of the psychiatrists
who tested Steve just a few

days after the robbery testified
that he was normal in all re
spects except in his ability to
determine reality, which
ranked below the fifth percen
tile," Ambler said.
Masover is now undergoing
psychiatric treatment while at
tending college and has al
ready shown a marked im
provement in his reality tests,
Ambler said.
"Our psychiatrist tests were
so convincing that the case was
thrown out of a federal court
because the federal prosecutor
was so sure he didn't even have
a case," Ambler said. "Only
one psychiatrist testified Steve
was a perfectly normal kid with
some grandiose political
schemes."
That psychiatrist, Dr. Richard
Fisch, of Palo Alto, saw
Masover for about one hour,
six months after the robbery.
"Steve was not mentally dis
turbed at the time of the rob
bery, but is instead an idealis
tic, overzealous boy with gran
diose ideas," Fisch said last
week. "In any legal sense,
Masover was not mentally in
capable during the robbery."
Another psychiatrist's tes

timony, that of Dr. James
Misset, strengthened the case
for Masover's defense. After
revealing Masover's plans for
the money, Misset was asked
by Phil Cronin, district attorney
and prosecutor in the case, if
Masover's plans included
using the bank's money during
the next 20 years. Misset
answered "yes" and Cronin
went on to try to prove this
meant "permanent depriva
tion."
The jury was totally con
fused. The foreman asked the
presiding judge for an exact
meaning of permanent depri
vation. All parties, including
Cronin, agreed the jurors must

decide for themselves upon an
exact meaning.
Cronin is no longer with the
district attorney's office. Lar
sen admitted friction occurred
between he and Cronin regard
ing the case.
"Cronin did not adequately
inform the jury on all aspects of
the case," Larsen said. "Cronin
should have insisted that the
jury be told permanent depri
vation means putting the
money to substantial tisk,
which I consider the stock
market to be."
Larsen also said that Cronin
should have properly in
structed the jury on testimony
given by both the psychiatrists

and by the accomplice, Hop
kins, that Masover intended to
give the money back.
"All that was hearsay tes
timony," Larsen said.
Since the jury didn't have
those instructions, the student
was acquitted because he said
he was going to return the
money.
Now rumor might indicate
that in the United States, if you
rob a bank and are caught in
the process you can be acquit
ted if you say you intended to
return the money with interest.
Don't bet on it. The road to
Hell, and to prison, is paved
with good intentions.
