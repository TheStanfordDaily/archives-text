# Classes offered for alumni

### LINDA WANG 
A Stanford education
doesn't necessarily end with
graduation. For 11 years, the
Alumni Association has offered
courses to all alumni and
others through its Continuing
Education Program.
According to Continuing
Education Program Director
Marian Player, the program
sponsors some 25 courses and
conferences each year.
"Our main mission," Player
said, "is to maintain the educa
tional relationship between
the University and its
graduates and to advertise the
excellence of the faculty." The
program is a valuable comple
ment to the more traditional
social alumni activities, accord
ing to Player.
The program attempts to
provide a varied selection of
offerings in order to "reach, in
some way, as many people as
possible," Player said. Recent
topics designed to appeal to a
variety of interests have in
cluded a Design Conference, a
workshop entitled "On Being
Single," a summer alumni col
lege entitled "The African
Mosaic" and executive man
agement seminars. The classes
range in duration from single
lectures to a 10-day residential
conference.
According to Player, the to
pic, cost, professors, location
and promotion all affect the
type of people who are at
tracted to the program.
A seminar conducted in Es
condido Village attracted many
student spouses, while a re
cent morning course was
popular with retired people.
The program also brings
continuing education to those
who have left the local area by
sponsoring seminars led by fa
culty at Stanford Clubs
throughout the country.
Although the majority who
enroll in the programs are
alumni, Playersaid that current
students, theirspousesandthe
local community also partici
pate. In addition, the program
tries to attract student partici

pation in organizing and con
ducting the various activities,
which "has been very reward
ing to both students and
alumni," Player said.
One of the greatest assets of
the program, according to
Player, is "the tremendous
support and enthusiasm of the
faculty." The interdisciplinary
nature of many of the confer
ences, as well as the satisfac
tion in teaching adults, attracts
the faculty.
The program, which is finan
cially self-supporting, relies
heavily on the "thousands of
ideas" generated by alumni
and others in developing fu
ture offerings, Player said. A
number of new programs are
now being considered at pre
sent, among them summer
courses at the Overseas Cen

ters. According to Player, this is
a "year of evaluating and
exploring new opportunities
for continuing education."
This year's Great Scholars
Forum will be held from 10
a.m. to noon on Tuesdays,
Oct. 3 to Nov. 7. Each lecture
will focus on a particular play
whose authors will include
Aeschylus, Sophocles,

sen. Tuition, including books,

this fall, Oct. 16 to Nov. 27, at 8
p.m. Tuition is $25 for mem
