# Courses in Bobangi, Ewe, Efik
## Obscure languages taught 
### JOHN DEAN 
Every quarter students fight to get
into overcrowded French, Spanish and
German classes here. Meanwhile there
are plenty of openings in some of the
other language course offerings — in
cluding classes on Bobangi, Parji, Efik
and Maori.
These are some of the "uncommonly
taught languages" offered here under
the auspices of the Linguistics Depart
ment Special Language Program, said
Jerry Lind, program coordinator.
Starting in 1971 with 12 languages,
the program now accommodates
nearly 150 students each quarter in
about 21 languages, among them Ton
gan, Ewe, Danish, Swedish, Yiddish
and Sign languages.

Students make requests for a lan
guage to Lind, who then finds a teacher
for that particular language. Reasons
for the requests range from an interest
in ethnic backgrounds, professional
reasons or just a wish to investigate a
"neglected language," Lind said. In
structors for the courses are usually na
tive speakers doing post-graduate or
graduate work here or wives of foreign
students.
Lind helps as many students for as
many different languages as he can find
teachers for. He said that under the
program, there are no fixed class sizes
so that even if only one student re
quested a specific language, Lind
would make every effort to find a
teacher for that one student.

Type of instruction varies according
to the class size. For example, the Mod
ern Creek class, with 10 students, has a
more structured, formal classroom
than the Mauritian Creole class.
The languages can be taken for cre
dit, usually three to five units, and the
pass/fail option is available. According
to Lind, the language courses are
scheduled "at the convenience of stu
dents."
Conversation is emphasized in all of
the special languages. A student is
guaranteed two years of instruction in
the language.
Lind said students can still make re
quests and enroll in a language prog
ram. Most of the classes will hold their
first meeting tomorrow or Thursday.
