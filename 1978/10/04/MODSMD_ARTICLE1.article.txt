# Libertarian Clark sees party close to 'balance of power'
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Legalizing both marijuana and
prostitution and lowering the drink
ing age to 18 are some of the reforms
Ed Clark, libertarian candidate for
governor, wants to see in California.
Clark, a 48-year-old Los Angeles
lawyer, discussed the present ad
ministration and the controversial
measures on November's ballot,
with about 50 students in White Plaza
yesterday.
"The Libertarians believe every
person should have the right to live
their lives in any way they choose, as
long as they don't use fraud or force
to violate the rights of others," he
explained.
People's rights
Clark said he advocates legalizing
marijuana and lowering the drinking
age, because "people have the right
to put any substances they want into
their bodies.
"I don't think lowering the drink
ing age will drastically affect the al
coholism rate in this country," Clark
said, before his noon speech.
"Alcohol has been the most com
mon drug in this country and for
hundreds of years has been subject
to abuse. It will continue to be so.
"But, I think 18-year-olds should
have the chance to test and develop
their own lifestyles."
Prostitution, for both males and
females, is a "victimless crime" and
should be legalized for consenting
adults, Clark said.
'Vicious weapon'
The Libertarians view Proposition
6, the "Anti-gay teacher's initiative,"
as a "vicious weapon," which stu
dents can use to get rid of teachers
who will fail them, Clark said.
He accused Sen. John Briggs, the
initiative's author, of using the prop
osition to divert the public's atten
tion from the deplorable state of
education.
"In reality, the problem lies bet
ween heterosexual male teachers
and female students," he said. "If
Proposition 6 passes, students can
overrun the educational system of
the country."
This educational system is already
grossly deficient, Clark added. He
proposes an $800 tax credit for all
parents who enroll their children in
private schools, forcing competition
between the private and public
schools and prompting the public
school system to improve its prog
rams.
Tax credits
Other tax credits, designed to help
low-income families, should include

a one-third reduction in sales taxes
and a $500 tax credit for renters, he
said.
The Libertarian party was or
ganized in 1972 and has grown in
recognition and power since then,
Clark said.
"Our goal this year is to make
Libertarianism the balance of power
in California and make it a balance of
power on the national level in 1980,''
Clark said. "The two-party system
has come to be as American as God,
motherhood and apple pie.
"But now we're number three in
political party recognition, coming
up from number 13 in 1972," he said.
"We've only got two more to go."

People's rights
Clark said he advocates legalizing
marijuana and lowering the drinking
age, because "people have the right
to put any substances they want into
their bodies.
"I don't think lowering the drink
ing age will drastically affect the al
coholism rate in this country," Clark
said, before his noon speech.
"Alcohol has been the most com
mon drug in this country and for
hundreds of years has been subject
to abuse. It will continue to be so.
"But, I think 18-year-olds should
have the chance to test and develop
their own lifestyles."
Prostitution, for both males and
females, is a "victimless crime" and
should be legalized for consenting
adults, Clark said.
'Vicious weapon'
The Libertarians view Proposition
6, the "Anti-gay teacher's initiative,"
as a "vicious weapon," which stu
dents can use to get rid of teachers
who will fail them, Clark said.
He accused Sen. John Briggs, the
initiative's author, of using the prop
osition to divert the public's atten
tion from the deplorable state of
education.
"In reality, the problem lies bet
ween heterosexual male teachers
and female students," he said. "If
Proposition 6 passes, students can
overrun the educational system of
the country."
This educational system is already
grossly deficient, Clark added. He
proposes an $800 tax credit for all
parents who enroll their children in
private schools, forcing competition
between the private and public
schools and prompting the public
school system to improve its prog
rams.
Tax credits
Other tax credits, designed to help
low-income families, should include

a one-third reduction in sales taxes
and a $500 tax credit for renters, he
said.
The Libertarian party was or
ganized in 1972 and has grown in
recognition and power since then,
Clark said.
"Our goal this year is to make
Libertarianism the balance of power
in California and make it a balance of
power on the national level in 1980,''
Clark said. "The two-party system
has come to be as American as God,
motherhood and apple pie.
"But now we're number three in
political party recognition, coming
up from number 13 in 1972," he said.
"We've only got two more to go."

Libertarian candidate for governor Ed Clark made his pitch for support in White
Plaza yesterday.
Legalizing both marijuana and
prostitution and lowering the drink
ing age to 18 are some of the reforms
Ed Clark, libertarian candidate for
governor, wants to see in California.
Clark, a 48-year-old Los Angeles
lawyer, discussed the present ad
ministration and the controversial
measures on November's ballot,
with about 50 students in White Plaza
yesterday.
"The Libertarians believe every
person should have the right to live
their lives in any way they choose, as
long as they don't use fraud or force
to violate the rights of others," he
explained.
