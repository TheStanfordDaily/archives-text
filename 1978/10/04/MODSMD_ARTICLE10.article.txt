## Thoughts on Stanford 
### 
To all incoming freshmen and transfers, wel
come to Stanford!
Late one night during the summer I was di
gesting a few thoughts about Stanford and
wrote this description of developing the Stan
ford complex and a commonly concomitant
pre-med syndrome.
Most of you are arriving here from an envi
ronment in which you were, in one way or
another, considered very special. Your everyday
life was probably tinged with an air of confi
dence. As a student and perhaps also as an
athlete, artist, musician or simply the progeny of
wealthy and powerful parents, you were noticed
and respected for your particular distinctions.
Many of you probably never even thought about
this consciously, but nevertheless it had a pro
found effect on the way you saw yourself, par
ticularly as you saw yourself in relation to your
peers.
Well, now you've all been brought together in
one place and the game from this point on
changes radically. Particularly if you're the com
petitive type you will soon find yourself seeing
the world through a very different lens. If you're
introspective and carefully monitor changes in
the way you perceive the world you'll notice
how the lens has changed, but more likely you
won't be able to put a finger on it or explicitly
understand or describe it.
The first thing you'll notice, and it's probably
no surprise, is that virtually everyone else
around you has somehow distinguished
himself/herself. The conspicuous ones are read
ily apparent: the football star down the hall, the
name of the girl across the corridor that's some
how familiar ("Oh, your name is Wrigley? And
you're from Chicago? I see . . ."). Word gets
around quickly about the nationally-known, but
as time passes more recondite distinctions will
come to your attention, especially academic
ones that don't appear anywhere or get broad-'
cast quite so publicly. About half way through
the quarter you might be talking to your room
mate about his old high school and it will come
out that he was valedictorian of the class, or
perhaps the only one in his high school that ever
scored an "800" on his math SAT. And even
though you only knew a handful of people be
fore now who held such distinctions, at Stanford
they are considered ho-hum, and, in time,
passe. (No pun intended.) Not only does this
sort of thing quickly deflate egos, it's also un
natural. For outside these verdant acres of con
centrated excellence and hard-won achieve
ments is plain old society.
After the first flush of excitement at getting to
know all your new neighbors and discovering
how loaded with talent, and especially academic
talent, Stanford is, you will come to realize, al
most certainly without admitting it to yourself or
perhaps even consciously realizing it, just what
a small fish you are in this bouillabaisse of pis
catorial grandeur. If you're like most people
here, your reaction at some point is going to be a
certain degree of anxiety as to how the hell

you'll be able to distinguish yourself here.
Looking specifically at academics, what seems
to happen is this: virtually everyone here is ac
customed to getting very good grades. Many
had straight A's through most of high school.
Years of academic self-confidence has been
built up and all too many Stanford students have
made up their minds, frequently with a little
parental prodding, to cash in those academic
blue chips for that pinnacle of prestige: Medical
School. Ah yes, Medical School. To gain admis
sion to this inner sanctum of academia there are
certain basic qualifications, the most fundamen
tal and crucial of which are extremely good
grades. Being responsible and intelligent young
people, Stanford students reckon that, because
they had such success in the past at getting high
grades, the trend will continue.
For a tiny minority, whose mental proces
ses I have yet to fathom, the straight As keep
coming without much perceptible strain. For a
larger minority, they keep coming, but as a re
sult of marathon study and near-fanatic effort
and dedication. But for the majority of the
people who are reading this, they don't come.
Massive effort is put forth and the outcome is a
scarcely-respectable B.
As the quarterly cycle renews itself, a large
number of these frustrated "pre-meds" re
plenish their resolve, rationalize the previous
quarter's poor performance and gird them
selves for the challenge again. But Chem 33 will
not budge, Clac 42 is like a stubborn mule, and
Physics, well, Physics renders them mute. Lec
tures proceed in what seems to be almost ran
dom order and test questions leave you wonder
ing if you bought the right text book. Maybe all
these questions came from the footnotes at the
back of the book, you will say to yourself. The
truly masochistic will vaguely think that if they
were really diligent they would check out all
those books in the bibliography at the end of
each chapter and try to read them. After all, why
else would the University have four million vol
umes?
All this should not discourage you, though. If
you happen to want to go to medical school, that
is your decision and by all means you should
give it your best crack. But don't ruin your years
here with anxiety and frustration. I am not a
pre-med and never have been, but I am accus
tortied to getting good grades and the frustra
tion of missing an A or three has shaken me up.
What I've had to resign myself to after two years
of college is that I am here above all to glean
some of the more elegant things in life . . .
calmly reasoned thought, articulate expression,
appreciation of finer aesthetic sensibilities than
my own, etc. â€” what faculty and administrators
lump under the general title of "liberal educa
tion." Some people can get these things from
pre-professional undergrad courses. The
people who do best in these courses are usually
the ones who see them as ends in and of them
selves, rather than as means to some other end.
