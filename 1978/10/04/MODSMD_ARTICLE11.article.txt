## LSJUMB old hat? 
### 
Dissatisfaction with various
aspects of University life is to
be expected. I c an readily take
complaints about the Daily;
what is a newspaper for, if not
complaint? But the growing
dissatisfaction with the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
(LS)UMB) worries me. The
Daily can always be changed.
The Band has nowhere to go.
The LSJUMB is in its fifteenth
year. It had plenty to satirize in
the '60s and early 70s: itself,
other schools, politics and the
various social revolutions of
the time. Few entertainment
groups last past 10 years.
The Band entertained its au
dience, which it stole from the
team, by offering unique
shows every week, both pre
game and halftime. The mem
bers of the LSJUMB protested
the times with humor and out
rageousness.
The war ended, Watergate
got boring. The fans forced the
Band to find other ways to titil
late. The better a performance,
the more the students would
demand of it the next time. The
cyclical relationship continues.
Until a few months ago, stu
dents were thrilled by sexual
innuendo and general offen
siveness. Political shows were
reduced to bits about minor
scandals or to famous dead
people, such as Mao Tse-tung.
The Band is losing its
momentum because of two
factors. The first is a dearth of
ideas. International events are
somewhat calmer now. The
LSJUMB has formed every con
ceivable phallic symbol.
The second is a growing con
servatism on this campus.

Many students now find the
halftime shows offensive,
whereas before they loved it
when the Band dared to ex
press an opinion or was raun
chy.
The Incomparables have
been reduced to groping for its
former gallant image, because
of its age, pressure to be in
novative, the new student se
dateness and the desensitiza
tion (inability to shock or to
surprise) of most of the popu
lation.
One alternative is for the
Band to continue in its present
form. Unfortunately, this will
take great and consistent sup
port from all fans. To continue
to be funny while playing
charts well takes innovation
and experimentation. Inevita
bly, some formations will fall
flat; entire shows may be sour.
Another alternative is to
create a traditional military
band out of the shambles of
the present group. Maybe stu
dents would prefer this, now
that the new sedateness has
settled onto the campus. Such
a band would be much better
musically â€” intonation and
dynamics. A traditional Stan
ford Band could offer marvel
ously executed shows; for
example: "Broadway show
stoppers."
Traditional bands are an ac
cepted part of the weekly sport
ritual. Their fans clap for them
enthusiastically and go for
soda, popcorn and weenies
during halftime.
A third alternative is for the
Band to disband. Maybe it is
time.
