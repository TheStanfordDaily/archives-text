"Being an intern on a University committee is
the most powerful position a freshman can hold
on campus," said Brett Kingstone, who served
as a freshman intern on lastyear's Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation
(CAPER).
As part of his intern experience, Kingstone led
the formation of the Small Sports Committee, a
subcommittee on CAPER. The subcommittee
supports non-revenue producing sports.
University committees are usually composed
of an equal number of faculty members, ad
ministrators, and students who work together to
make many of the decisions that affect the
community here, )anet Rappaport, last year's
coordinator of committee activities, said.
One student on each of the committees is
either a freshman, transfer, or first-year
graduate student. The student intern is a non
voting member of the committee.
Though the intern may not vote, he is still an
integral part of the committee, "contributing his
insights on the matters under consideration,"
according to Ina Coleman, last year's Commit
tee ori Undergraduate Studies' intern.
"The committee experience gave me a better
awareness of how this school works and how

decisions are made. I was able to rub elbows
with some of the most important people on the
Stanford campus," Coleman said.
"An intern experience gives the freshman a
good chance to get involved with the administ
ration and faculty. It's very surprising how much
one person can do if he works hard and is ex
tremely persistent when voicing his views,"
Kingstone said.
The intern experience requires "a good deal
of work and preparation on the part of the in
tern," Robert Hamrdla, chairman of the Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation, said.
"The success of a committee depends primar
ily on the committee chairman and adminis
trators. A student can only accomplish so much
on his own. The rest is not in his hands," Kings
tone said.
Freshmen, transfer students or first-year
graduate students interested in applying for
committee internships may pick up applications
in the ASSU office on the second floor of Tresid
der Union. Applications are due in about two
weeks, according to Rappaport.
Applications are reviewed by the ASSU
Senate-appointed Nominations Committee,
which then interviews qualified applicants.
