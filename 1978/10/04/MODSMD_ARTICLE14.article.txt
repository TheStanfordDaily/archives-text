# After 70 years of 'maleness'
## El Toro eating club goes coed 
### NONNIE GERBER 
As the only male eating club
here, El Toro had earned a
reputation not unlike that of a
rowdy fraternity. Members
were proud of their unique
all-male surroundings and
were not eager to join the
ranks of numerous clubs, col
leges and societal groups who
had admitted women in their
midsts.
But last spring, in the face of
economic hardship, El Toro
was forced to follow a long line
of predecessors and leave its

70-year tradition of "maleness"
behind.
As El Toro opened its doors
two weeks ago to admit au
tumn quarter members,
women waited in the lines to
"sign up." In fact, El Toro's
membership now totals 50
women and 60 men.
In the days of male exclu
siveness, only 80 students be
longed. This past summer, the
club spent $4500 to expand the
physical size of the interior sur
roundings, making room for
the additional 30 members ac
cepted to join El Toro this fall.

In spite of the increased
membership, 30 to 40 people
were turned away this year be
cause of limited space, accord
ing to Bill Davis, the club's bus
iness man,iger. Lastyear, only a
handful more people applied
than could be accepted, Davis
said.
"There just has been a dying
interest in all-male clubs," Tim
Irby, club president, said.
El Toro's previous reputation
has been quickly discarded, as
coeducation seems to be suc
cessful so far. Though most of
the returning members said

they agreed to let the club go
coed only because of financial
problems, they still look op
timistically at the club's trans
formation.
"We sacrificed one big tradi
tion to maintain all the others,"
Rik Williams, grad student and
second-year member of El
Toro, said.
Members agree that the club
has lost some of its all-male
camaraderie and spirit. "We
just don't say half the things we
used to say around the club,"
George Kerekes, third-year
member said.
"And yet," )im Cettenbauer,
senior and third-year member,
said, "coeducation has instil
led a new spirit in the club."
According to Kerekes, El
Toro has maintained certain
traditions such as a moment's
silence before dinner, creative
meal announcements and or
dered business meetings, de
spite worry from male mem
bers that "with women, all
things would change."
Another tradition in past
years required that club mem
bers douse people with water
on their birthdays. Last week,
the fate of the tradition was
tested. Both a male member
and a female member had
birthdays. Following tradition,
the male was doused with wa
ter. Members waited in antici
pation to see whether the wo
man's fate would be identical.
The club president ap
proached, water in hand. But
when he reached her, he pul
led a bright red rose from be
hind his back.
A new tradition was
"crowned." A new era in the
annals of El Toro began.

women and 60 men.
In the days of male exclu
siveness, only 80 students be
longed. This past summer, the
club spent $4500 to expand the
physical size of the interior sur
roundings, making room for
the additional 30 members ac
cepted to join El Toro this fall.

In spite of the increased
membership, 30 to 40 people
were turned away this year be
cause of limited space, accord
ing to Bill Davis, the club's bus
iness man,iger. Lastyear, only a
handful more people applied
than could be accepted, Davis
said.
"There just has been a dying
interest in all-male clubs," Tim
Irby, club president, said.
El Toro's previous reputation
has been quickly discarded, as
coeducation seems to be suc
cessful so far. Though most of
the returning members said

they agreed to let the club go
coed only because of financial
problems, they still look op
timistically at the club's trans
formation.
"We sacrificed one big tradi
tion to maintain all the others,"
Rik Williams, grad student and
second-year member of El
Toro, said.
Members agree that the club
has lost some of its all-male
camaraderie and spirit. "We
just don't say half the things we
used to say around the club,"
George Kerekes, third-year
member said.
"And yet," )im Cettenbauer,
senior and third-year member,
said, "coeducation has instil
led a new spirit in the club."
According to Kerekes, El
Toro has maintained certain
traditions such as a moment's
silence before dinner, creative
meal announcements and or
dered business meetings, de
spite worry from male mem
bers that "with women, all
things would change."
Another tradition in past
years required that club mem
bers douse people with water
on their birthdays. Last week,
the fate of the tradition was
tested. Both a male member
and a female member had
birthdays. Following tradition,
the male was doused with wa
ter. Members waited in antici
pation to see whether the wo
man's fate would be identical.
The club president ap
proached, water in hand. But
when he reached her, he pul
led a bright red rose from be
hind his back.
A new tradition was
"crowned." A new era in the
annals of El Toro began.

A year ago, the scene above would not have existed. Eating club El Toro, due to financial difficulties,
decided last spring to accept women members this year. Even with this major change in its character, El
Toro still maintains old traditions.
As the only male eating club
here, El Toro had earned a
reputation not unlike that of a
rowdy fraternity. Members
were proud of their unique
all-male surroundings and
were not eager to join the
ranks of numerous clubs, col
leges and societal groups who
had admitted women in their
midsts.
But last spring, in the face of
economic hardship, El Toro
was forced to follow a long line
of predecessors and leave its

70-year tradition of "maleness"
behind.
As El Toro opened its doors
two weeks ago to admit au
tumn quarter members,
women waited in the lines to
"sign up." In fact, El Toro's
membership now totals 50
women and 60 men.
