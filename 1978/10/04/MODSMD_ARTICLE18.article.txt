# Freshman fits in with team
## Card booters score with Rafalovich 
### ROBERT REED 
Three years ago, Stanford
soccer was almost dropped as a
varsity-level sport due to lack
of quality coaching, lack of
quality players and a general
lack of interest. But in each of
the three years since its brush
with death, Stanford varsity
soccer has taken the steps
necessary to gain its place in
the sun.
The first year, the squad ob
tained a quality coach, Nelson
Lodge, who at once led Stan
ford to its finest season in
years. In the second year, Stan
ford found its first true quality
player in forward Danny
McNevin, who proceeded to
lead the Cards to a third-place
finish in the tough Pacific Soc
cer Conference. And in this,
the third year, Stanford varsity
soccer has found an item of
particular interest. That item is
one Theodore Spiro Rafalovich
111.
Freshman Rafalovich, the
first high school All-American
ever to play soccer at Stanford,
has led the Cards in scoring
since the beginning of the sea

son. Whether this is coinci
dence or not, no one can say,
but Stanford, at 5-1, is off to its
best start ever. Rafalovich's
addition to the squad gives the
Cards something they've never
had before — credability.
"His (Rafalovich's) addition
gives us credability up front
. . . We've never had more
than one striker up front,"
Lodge said. "Now, we have
two. Rafalovich and McNevin."
But what of Rafalovich? Why
is he so special? What has he
done?
Honors
Well, Ted Rafalovich has
done just about everything. In
addition to his first-team high
school All-America selection,
Rafalovich, a four-year starter
in high school, won all the All-
League and All-Coast honors
one can think of. The 6-foot-1,
18-year-old forward from
Saratoga also recently com
pleted a 2Vi-week training ses
sion with the U.S. Junior Na
tional Team at Squaw Valley's
Olympic Center, where he
emerged as one of the group's
top scoring threats.

Many believe Rafalovich was
simply the best high school
soccer player California had to
offer and Lodge will never
deny this. "He's authentic," he
said. "We've got a real money
player. Without a doubt, he
must be considered one of the
best young players in the na
tion."
There you have it, folks. Ted
Rafalovich is great. But one of
the problems with greatness is
the pressure that goes along
with it.
Being the hot shot All-
American out of loe Blow High,
Ted naturally became the vic
tim of a certain amount of
skepticism and resentment
from some of the older players.
And being the "new kid on the
block," a freshman trying to
adjust to a new coach, a new
school and a new environment
did not help matters. As former
Stanford player and current as
sistant coach, Phil Wright said
"Ted had problems finding his
role at first. Fie grew tense,
putting a lot of pressure on
himself."
This is the same pressure
with which many have found
themselves incapable of cop
ing. But Rafalovich was capa
ble. Fie relieved the internal
pressure by proving that he
was worthy of all the accolades
he'd received. He began scor
ing goals.

"Because of his position, he
focused that pressure on scor
ing," said Wright. Now that
he's proven himself, the pres
sures and the tensions are sub
siding. "Teddy's loosening up
now," added Wright. "He's
proven. Now he can just play
good soccer." And that he
does.
The future
The handsome freshman is a
complete player who passes as
well as he shoots. Playing since
he was 12 under the tutelage of
his father, who now coaches
the striker's younger twin
brothers, Rafalovich has been
lucky enough never to have
suffered any major injuries. He
sees both a professional career
and the 1980 Olympics as fu
ture possibilities, but his prim
ary goal is ". . . to be happy in
whatever I'm doing." He is, as
Wright put it, "pretty much the
typical Stanford student, who
likes his diversity." Like many
freshmen, the young star is ac
tually sort of shy, though this
has not kept him from getting
along well with the team.
A leader
"Ted's fitting in real well with
the team," said junior midfiel
der Billy Hoffenburg. "He's
kinda quiet, but he's a pretty
nice guy."
Just being a "pretty nice
guy" wouldn't make him an in
tegral part of the team, though.

There's more, said Mark
Graham, Rafalovich's longtime
friend and teammate. "Ted al
ways plays hard."
Rafalovich gives his all, and
his teammates respect him for
this. Hoffenburg reiterated,
"He's a real team player." But
that's not all. Ted Rafalovich is
a leader.
"Teddy's a quiet type of
leader," Wright said. "Just his
excitement, his caring for
others, picks the team up.
There was a problem, though,
at the beginning. He seemed
only to be able to pick the team
up when he was scoring. But
he has matured a little. He has
realized now that he doesn't
have to score."
Rafalovich is capable now of
picking the club up just as
much with his all-out effort and
passing as with his goal
scoring. Rafalovich said he en
joys "distributing" the ball
more now. But whether he has
to score or not is a matter of
opinion.
Different breed
"Teddy, like all strikers, is a
different breed of ballplayer,"
said Lodge. "He wants to
score. Heneeds to score — the
only problem being that he
gets mad when he doesn't."
This may be a sign of his age,
Lodge suggested. "He takes it
all a little hard on himself . . .
he needs a year."
Lodge explained that the
pressure of playing varsity soc
cer at the NCAA level is gruel
ing, and that the level of com
petition is "good and tough."
Outlook
"Teddy wants to learn," said
Lodge. "He wants to become
better. He wants to benefit the
team. And he'll do anything."
The future is unlimited for an
athlete with this type of at
titude. When asked what
Rafalovich's chances of making
All-Pacific Conference are,
Lodge replied, "Well, so far, he
has four All-America votes!"
But the fundamental ques
tion remains. Why in the world
would an All-American soccer
prospect, who was recruited
by virtually all the major pow
ers on the West Coast and sev
eral on the East, come to Stan
ford?
"Well, academics," said
Rafalovich. "Good atmos
phere. And I like the people."
Even so, tell me, did Ted
Rafalovich make the right
choice? "Sure. No doubt about
it. Here, I can grow."
Yes, Ted Rafalovich can
grow. And so can Stanford var
sity soccer.
