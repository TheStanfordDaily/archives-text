# Grad senate deadline extended
## 
### ROBIN QUATE 
A lack of graduate candidates
for the ASSU Senate prompted
Elections Commission Will Nixon
to extend the deadline for
graduate petitions from yesterday
to 4 p.m. Friday.
ASSU elections are next Thurs
day and Friday.
Only five graduate students had
filed by the deadline, Nixon said.
Three of the candidates are run
ning on the Committee to Retire
Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) slate.
CRAP supports a constitutional
amendment, which would elimi
nate the senate and establish a
five-student Finance Committee,
appointed by the ASSU Nomina
tions Committee. That group
would administer the budget, but
report to the Council of Presi
dents (COP), which would take
over all other senate powers and
duties.
'Inside' job
CRAP slate candidate Mike
Roberts said, if the amendment
fails, senators elected from the
CRAP slate would work "inside"
to replace the senate with a Fi
nance Committee.
According to the ASSU Con
stitution, 10 graduate senators
and alternates must be elected.
Last year, only nine filed by the
deadline. Eleven more filed after
an extension.
This candidate dropoff also has

hit undergraduates. Thirty peti
tions have been filed this year for
20 seats, down from 43 last fall and
80 in 1976.
Other items on the ballot are a
fee assessment, referendum and a
possible election of members to
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
KZSU assessment
The $1 fee assessment, due
winter quarter, would finance im
provements for KZSU.
The referendum polls students
on whether student investment
money should be handled sepa
rately from the University's,
Nixon said, instead of their cur
rent joint treatment.
The CRAP-backed amendment
requires a two-thirds vote to pass,
subject to approval by the Board
of Trustees.
For a fee assessment to pass, 20
percent of registered students
must vote.
Nixon said he expects to have a
pamphlet on candidates' plat
forms and issues ready for dis
tribution next week.
Elections statements
The Elections Commission has
also distributed a statement to
each of the candidates, which
clarifies the election rules in the
ASSU Constitution and bylaws.
After last year's election, two
senators were disqualified and
one suspended for a quarter for

failing to comply with election
rules.
A debate among the senate
candidates will be broadcast live
from the American Studies House
by KZSU this Sunday from 3 to 5
p.m.
COP member Fred Estes said he
is attempting to schedule a candi
dates' night in Escondido Village
for the benefit of graduate stu
dents.
Grad vote low
In the past, graduate voter
turnout has been consistently
low. Estes said this may be be
cause the graduate community is
fragmented.
"Many live off campus and
don't feel a high sense of identifi
cation. I'd like to see this re
versed," he said.
Ballots will be mailed to the

overseas campuses today. "Al
though the percentage of over
seas students is small," Nixon
said, "their vote can make a dif
ference." For example, last spring
the overseas vote made up the dif
ference required to pass three fee
assessments.
Assessments fail
However, eight other fee as
sessments on the spring ballot did
not pass because they missed the
20 percent minimum. A special
election was held, which drew a
record 3400 voters to pass the as
sessments.
This broke the previous record
set last fall, when 3306 students
voted out of an estimated 11,920
registered students.
Elections Commissioner Nixon
said he predicts "a good turnout
this year."

A lack of graduate candidates
for the ASSU Senate prompted
Elections Commission Will Nixon
to extend the deadline for
graduate petitions from yesterday
to 4 p.m. Friday.
ASSU elections are next Thurs
day and Friday.
Only five graduate students had
filed by the deadline, Nixon said.
Three of the candidates are run
ning on the Committee to Retire
Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) slate.
CRAP supports a constitutional
amendment, which would elimi
nate the senate and establish a
five-student Finance Committee,
appointed by the ASSU Nomina
tions Committee. That group
would administer the budget, but
report to the Council of Presi
dents (COP), which would take
over all other senate powers and
duties.
'Inside' job
CRAP slate candidate Mike
Roberts said, if the amendment
fails, senators elected from the
CRAP slate would work "inside"
to replace the senate with a Fi
nance Committee.
According to the ASSU Con
stitution, 10 graduate senators
and alternates must be elected.
Last year, only nine filed by the
deadline. Eleven more filed after
an extension.
This candidate dropoff also has

hit undergraduates. Thirty peti
tions have been filed this year for
20 seats, down from 43 last fall and
80 in 1976.
Other items on the ballot are a
fee assessment, referendum and a
possible election of members to
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
KZSU assessment
The $1 fee assessment, due
winter quarter, would finance im
provements for KZSU.
The referendum polls students
on whether student investment
money should be handled sepa
rately from the University's,
Nixon said, instead of their cur
rent joint treatment.
The CRAP-backed amendment
requires a two-thirds vote to pass,
subject to approval by the Board
of Trustees.
For a fee assessment to pass, 20
percent of registered students
must vote.
Nixon said he expects to have a
pamphlet on candidates' plat
forms and issues ready for dis
tribution next week.
Elections statements
The Elections Commission has
also distributed a statement to
each of the candidates, which
clarifies the election rules in the
ASSU Constitution and bylaws.
After last year's election, two
senators were disqualified and
one suspended for a quarter for

failing to comply with election
rules.
A debate among the senate
candidates will be broadcast live
from the American Studies House
by KZSU this Sunday from 3 to 5
p.m.
COP member Fred Estes said he
is attempting to schedule a candi
dates' night in Escondido Village
for the benefit of graduate stu
dents.
Grad vote low
In the past, graduate voter
turnout has been consistently
low. Estes said this may be be
cause the graduate community is
fragmented.
"Many live off campus and
don't feel a high sense of identifi
cation. I'd like to see this re
versed," he said.
Ballots will be mailed to the

overseas campuses today. "Al
though the percentage of over
seas students is small," Nixon
said, "their vote can make a dif
ference." For example, last spring
the overseas vote made up the dif
ference required to pass three fee
assessments.
Assessments fail
However, eight other fee as
sessments on the spring ballot did
not pass because they missed the
20 percent minimum. A special
election was held, which drew a
record 3400 voters to pass the as
sessments.
This broke the previous record
set last fall, when 3306 students
voted out of an estimated 11,920
registered students.
Elections Commissioner Nixon
said he predicts "a good turnout
this year."
