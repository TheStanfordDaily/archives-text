## Sticking to your guns while being shot down

The sports editor of the Arizona
State State Press and a sportswriting
cohort drove up to the Mogollom
Rim northeast of Tempe in August to
the Sun Devil summer football camp
to gather material for the initial fall
issue of the campus paper.
Amused by the locaf sports media
during their short stay in Rogollom,
the pair filed a humorous story about
central Arizona sportswriting after
trekking back down the mountain.
The story drew laughs in most cor
ners, but drew an explosive reaction
from one. When Walter Berry, the
State Press sports editor who co
authored the story, stopped by the
sports information office to pick up
press passes for the ASU football
games, information director Moon
Mullins dropped a bomb.
At the insistence of Dr. Fred Miller,
ASU athletic director, the State Press
was removed from Sun Devil road
trips, Mullins told Berry. Miller said
that the column poking fun at the
media had been"the last straw."

The tenuous financial condition of
most campus papers prevent them
from being able to afford to send re
porters on the road to cover away
football games. Many athletic de
partments, including Stanford's, un
derstand these economic constraints
and generously pay for one student
reporter to travel with the team, pick

ing up the tab for flights and lodging.
Student writers appreciate the sub
sidization but nonetheless view it
apprehensively.
Collegiate reporters realize that
many athletic administrators expect
that, in exchange for the free trips
and hotel rooms, the reporter will
become another cog in the athletic
department publicity machinery.
And any reporter worth his weight in
salt tablets feels queasy about ac
cepting a situation which may com
promise his or her objectivity.
At Arizona State, the sports de
partment did not compromise its ob
jectivity. Instead, it lost its seat on the
team plane. The State Press pub
lished players' grades, embarrassing
the athletic department by writing
about football players who had grade
point averages resembling Blutars
ki's — 0.00. It reported that recruits
and freshmen were taken to the dog
races and had bets placed for them
by department friends. While local
papers chose to overlook these inci
dents, the State Press was deter
mined not to yield to what they called
the "B.N.K. Policy" of boost, not
knock.
Arizona State is not an isolated
case. Just down the Bayshore, the
San Jose State Spartan Daily has also
run into roadblocks while trying to
report sports without relinquishing

its journalistic responsibilities.
Last spring, sports editor Anne
Brennan and another Spartan
sportswriter did an investigative
piece on under-the-table money sift
ing from the hands of alums to those
of a few football players. A red-faced
Bob Murphy, former Stanford sports
information director who is currently
the athletic director at SJSU, rushed
to the San lose Mercury-News and
soft-sold them with a story that the
athletic department knew about the
"illegal loans" to three players and
was taking care of it.
To get the information fortheSpar
tan Daily, Brennan and her co-writer
had guaranteed anonymity to
players. This had weakened the
punch of their piece.
The paper was rewarded for its in
vestigative journalism by being re
moved from the San Jose road trips
and with new seats for home games
— they are now tucked away with TV
and radio, removed from the work
ing press section.
Now Murphy will not talk to repor
ters from the Spartan Daily. San Jose
football coach Lynn Stiles has told his
players that they must first check
with him before speaking with repor
ters from the Spartan Daily.
Chuck Hilldebrand, one of the
football writers from the paper, said
he understood Stiles' feelings.
"If he doesn't win nine this year,

it's his ass," Hilldebrand said. "He
doesn't want us undermining his
players.
"I try to work around it (the
check-with-coach-first rule). I want
to cooperate."

Berry and the State Press have
reacted in a much different manner
than their counterparts in San Jose.
By an overwhelming vote of the staff,
the Sfafe Press has undergone a
boycott of the first four ASU games.
The sports section has run the final
score of the games. Period. No pic
tures. No stories. A fr w features, and
some of these on opposing players.
Before the ASU-Brigham Young
game, Berry wrote a feature on BVU
quarterback Marc Wilson.
"Look," Berry said, "it was the last
straw for us too. Some see it as my
personal vendetta, but most of the
staff supports our effort.
"Some say it is childish. But we're
just trying to uphold journalistic trad
ition."

Both San Jose State and Arizona
State have undergraduate journalism
schools. It is difficult to be told in a
classroom to strive for objectivity, to
search for both the bad and good
sides of any subject, and then be
penalized by another department
within the same school for pursuing
that goal.
