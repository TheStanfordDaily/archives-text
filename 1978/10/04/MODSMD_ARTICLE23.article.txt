Carter will veto public works bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday he will veto the $10.2 billion public works bill
passed by Congress because it is inflationary and wastes
the taxpayers' money.
Democratic leaders predicted in advance they could
muster sufficient votes in Congress to override Carter s
veto, but the president told reporters in his Oval Office
he is determined to make it stick.
"It is important that I and the Congress set an example
for the rest of the nation in controlling inflation. This
public works bill is exactly the wrong example," Carter
said in a brief statement.
The measure passed both houses of Congress by mar
gins much larger than the two-thirds majorities needed
to put it into effect without the president's signature.
Former CIA official's body found
Baltimore — Authorities said yesterday that a body
dragged from Chesapeake Bay belted with divers'
weights was that of a former high-ranking Central Intel
ligence Agency official. Police said he had been shot in
the head.
The decomposing body of John Paisley, 55, of
Washington, was identified through dental charts by the
state medical examiner. It had Deen found Sunday.
Paisley's death could have been suicide or murder,
according to Bill Clark of the state police.
Paisley retired in 1974 after serving as deputy director
of the ClA's Office of Strategic Research. For the past six
months, he was a consultant to the accounting firm
Coopers & Lydrand.
A CIA spokesman refused comment on the case
beyond saying that "we are not involved in the investiga
tion in any way but we will cooperate if asked."
Physician had warned pope
Vatican City — Pope John Paul I's physician said yes
terday he told the pontiff a few days before his death that
he could not continue such a strenuous pace. And an
ultra-conservative Roman Catholic group has demanded
"a judicial inquiry" into the cause of the pope's death.

Dr. Antonio de Ros, Pope john Paul's personal physi
cian when he was Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of
Venice, told the AP in a telephone interview that the
burden of the pontificate and the sensitivity of Luciani
possibly were contributing factors in his heart attack.
An organization called Civilta Cristiana, said it has filed
a formal petition with the Vatican Courts of Justice to
"open a judicial inquiry to ascertain the true causes" of
the pope's death.
But Cardinal Silvio Oddi said the Sacred College "will
not even discuss the issue. We know for certain that the
death of John Paul I was because his heart ceased to beat
due to natural causes."
Refinery explosion kills three
Denver — A series of fiery explosions felt for 30 miles
killed at least three workers at an oil refinery yesterday,
authorities said. Plant officials said a malfunctioning
valve may have leaked gases into the air, triggering the
blasts.
The explosions at the Continental Oil Co. facility
created brilliant orange fireballs and sent thick black
smoke thousands of feet into the air. Pieces of twisted
and charred metal were found up to two miles from the
plant.
Hospitals in the area reported that eight plant
employees and three other persons were injured, sev
eral of them critically burned.
Plant manager Robert Alexander said damage might
run to between $5 and $10 million unless the equipment
within the fire area could be salvaged.
Politics contributes to GSA scandal
Washington — The man hi red to clean up corruption in
the General Services Administration told a House panel
yesterday that high-level agency officials and "politics"
are involved in the scandal.
GSA special counsel Vincent Alto would not say how
high in the agency the scandal might reach, but added:
"What we've seen is just the beginning." He also said
politics has contributed to the corruption.
Asked later to elaborate on his reference to "politics,"
Alto told a reporter that "some congressmen over the

past 25 years may have benefited (from GSA dealings)
when they shouldn't have."
However, he declined to name any congressmen or to
say whether current political figures are under investiga
tion in connection with the scandal.
Sadat effects military shake-up
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shook up his military
leadership yesterday to put "new blood" in a revised
government that is to be sworn in tomorrow.
In a speech Monday to parliament about the Camp
David accords, Sadat said he planned to direct himself to
internal matters once a peace treaty was signed with
Israel, but made no mention of the military changes.
Meanwhile, there were reports in Nicosia that Saudi
Arabia and Jordan have joined ranks with the oil-rich
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in
backing Iraq's call Sunday for a pan-Arab summit to
counter the Camp David agreements.
Brown, Younger file reports
Sacramento — A month before the November elec
tion, Gov. Jerry Brown has collected and spent twice as
much money as his Republican opponent, Attorney
General Evelle Younger, according to financial state
ments released yesterday.
Both are pouring half of their expenditures into televi
sion and radio advertisements, the statements show.
Younger's statement, received by the secretary of
state's office here, showed the Younger Campaign
Committee received $323,543.74 from contributors and
$321,500 transferring from the related Younger-Curb
California Committee. The YCC spent $576,237.63.
Brown's statement was not available yesterday in the
Sacramento secretary of state's office, because he filed
in Los Angeles.
However, Brown's campaign press secretary, Barbara
Metzger, said the campaign received $1.6 million and
spent $1.1 million between June 30 and Sept. 23. She did
not detail contributions.
N.Y. pressmen end walkout
New York — Striking pressmen overwhelmingly
ratified a new contract with the New York Post yesterday,
ending their union's eight-week walkout at the after

noon daily, a union official said.
However, it was not immediately clear whether the
Post would be able to publish today. Typographers, who
have a long-term contract with the Post, had returned to
their jobs before the pressmen took their vote, but three
other unions remain on strike.
The Post's action puts the publishers of the Times and
the Daily News under pressure to come to quick terms
with pressmen and other unions.
Senate rejects ERA rescissions
Washington — The Senate rejected by a 64-26 vote
yesterday the first of two proposals to let state legisla
tures withdraw their approval of the Equal Rights
Amendment if other states are given additional time to
ratify it.
The Senate will vote today on a less far-reaching
amendment by Sen. Jake Carn (R-Utah) which would
apply only to future votes to rescind approval of the ERA.
The deadline for ERA backers to win ratification votes
from three-fourths of the states is next March 22. The
House has approved extending the deadline to June 30,
1982.
The ERA has been ratified by 35 legislatures, but those
of Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska and Tennessee have
voted to rescind their actions.

he could not continue such a strenuous pace. And an
ultra-conservative Roman Catholic group has demanded
"a judicial inquiry" into the cause of the pope's death.

Dr. Antonio de Ros, Pope john Paul's personal physi
cian when he was Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of
Venice, told the AP in a telephone interview that the
burden of the pontificate and the sensitivity of Luciani
possibly were contributing factors in his heart attack.
An organization called Civilta Cristiana, said it has filed
a formal petition with the Vatican Courts of Justice to
"open a judicial inquiry to ascertain the true causes" of
the pope's death.
But Cardinal Silvio Oddi said the Sacred College "will
not even discuss the issue. We know for certain that the
death of John Paul I was because his heart ceased to beat
due to natural causes."
Refinery explosion kills three
Denver — A series of fiery explosions felt for 30 miles
killed at least three workers at an oil refinery yesterday,
authorities said. Plant officials said a malfunctioning
valve may have leaked gases into the air, triggering the
blasts.
The explosions at the Continental Oil Co. facility
created brilliant orange fireballs and sent thick black
smoke thousands of feet into the air. Pieces of twisted
and charred metal were found up to two miles from the
plant.
Hospitals in the area reported that eight plant
employees and three other persons were injured, sev
eral of them critically burned.
Plant manager Robert Alexander said damage might
run to between $5 and $10 million unless the equipment
within the fire area could be salvaged.
Politics contributes to GSA scandal
Washington — The man hi red to clean up corruption in
the General Services Administration told a House panel
yesterday that high-level agency officials and "politics"
are involved in the scandal.
GSA special counsel Vincent Alto would not say how
high in the agency the scandal might reach, but added:
"What we've seen is just the beginning." He also said
politics has contributed to the corruption.
Asked later to elaborate on his reference to "politics,"
Alto told a reporter that "some congressmen over the

past 25 years may have benefited (from GSA dealings)
when they shouldn't have."
However, he declined to name any congressmen or to
say whether current political figures are under investiga
tion in connection with the scandal.
Sadat effects military shake-up
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shook up his military
leadership yesterday to put "new blood" in a revised
government that is to be sworn in tomorrow.
In a speech Monday to parliament about the Camp
David accords, Sadat said he planned to direct himself to
internal matters once a peace treaty was signed with
Israel, but made no mention of the military changes.
Meanwhile, there were reports in Nicosia that Saudi
Arabia and Jordan have joined ranks with the oil-rich
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in
backing Iraq's call Sunday for a pan-Arab summit to
counter the Camp David agreements.
Brown, Younger file reports
Sacramento — A month before the November elec
tion, Gov. Jerry Brown has collected and spent twice as
much money as his Republican opponent, Attorney
General Evelle Younger, according to financial state
ments released yesterday.
Both are pouring half of their expenditures into televi
sion and radio advertisements, the statements show.
Younger's statement, received by the secretary of
state's office here, showed the Younger Campaign
Committee received $323,543.74 from contributors and
$321,500 transferring from the related Younger-Curb
California Committee. The YCC spent $576,237.63.
Brown's statement was not available yesterday in the
Sacramento secretary of state's office, because he filed
in Los Angeles.
However, Brown's campaign press secretary, Barbara
Metzger, said the campaign received $1.6 million and
spent $1.1 million between June 30 and Sept. 23. She did
not detail contributions.
N.Y. pressmen end walkout
New York — Striking pressmen overwhelmingly
ratified a new contract with the New York Post yesterday,
ending their union's eight-week walkout at the after

noon daily, a union official said.
However, it was not immediately clear whether the
Post would be able to publish today. Typographers, who
have a long-term contract with the Post, had returned to
their jobs before the pressmen took their vote, but three
other unions remain on strike.
The Post's action puts the publishers of the Times and
the Daily News under pressure to come to quick terms
with pressmen and other unions.
Senate rejects ERA rescissions
Washington — The Senate rejected by a 64-26 vote
yesterday the first of two proposals to let state legisla
tures withdraw their approval of the Equal Rights
Amendment if other states are given additional time to
ratify it.
The Senate will vote today on a less far-reaching
amendment by Sen. Jake Carn (R-Utah) which would
apply only to future votes to rescind approval of the ERA.
The deadline for ERA backers to win ratification votes
from three-fourths of the states is next March 22. The
House has approved extending the deadline to June 30,
1982.
The ERA has been ratified by 35 legislatures, but those
of Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska and Tennessee have
voted to rescind their actions.

Carter will veto public works bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday he will veto the $10.2 billion public works bill
passed by Congress because it is inflationary and wastes
the taxpayers' money.
Democratic leaders predicted in advance they could
muster sufficient votes in Congress to override Carter s
veto, but the president told reporters in his Oval Office
he is determined to make it stick.
"It is important that I and the Congress set an example
for the rest of the nation in controlling inflation. This
public works bill is exactly the wrong example," Carter
said in a brief statement.
The measure passed both houses of Congress by mar
gins much larger than the two-thirds majorities needed

Former CIA official's body found
Baltimore — Authorities said yesterday that a body
dragged from Chesapeake Bay belted with divers'
weights was that of a former high-ranking Central Intel
ligence Agency official. Police said he had been shot in
the head.
The decomposing body of John Paisley, 55, of
Washington, was identified through dental charts by the
state medical examiner. It had Deen found Sunday.
Paisley's death could have been suicide or murder,
according to Bill Clark of the state police.
Paisley retired in 1974 after serving as deputy director
of the ClA's Office of Strategic Research. For the past six
months, he was a consultant to the accounting firm
Coopers & Lydrand.
A CIA spokesman refused comment on the case
beyond saying that "we are not involved in the investiga

yesterday that high-level agency officials and "politics"
are involved in the scandal.
GSA special counsel Vincent Alto would not say how
high in the agency the scandal might reach, but added:
"What we've seen is just the beginning." He also said
politics has contributed to the corruption.
Asked later to elaborate on his reference to "politics,"
Alto told a reporter that "some congressmen over the

past 25 years may have benefited (from GSA dealings)
when they shouldn't have."
However, he declined to name any congressmen or to
say whether current political figures are under investiga
tion in connection with the scandal.
Sadat effects military shake-up
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shook up his military
leadership yesterday to put "new blood" in a revised
government that is to be sworn in tomorrow.
In a speech Monday to parliament about the Camp
David accords, Sadat said he planned to direct himself to
internal matters once a peace treaty was signed with
Israel, but made no mention of the military changes.
Meanwhile, there were reports in Nicosia that Saudi
Arabia and Jordan have joined ranks with the oil-rich
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in
backing Iraq's call Sunday for a pan-Arab summit to
counter the Camp David agreements.
Brown, Younger file reports
Sacramento — A month before the November elec
tion, Gov. Jerry Brown has collected and spent twice as
much money as his Republican opponent, Attorney
General Evelle Younger, according to financial state
ments released yesterday.
Both are pouring half of their expenditures into televi
sion and radio advertisements, the statements show.
Younger's statement, received by the secretary of
state's office here, showed the Younger Campaign
Committee received $323,543.74 from contributors and
$321,500 transferring from the related Younger-Curb
California Committee. The YCC spent $576,237.63.
Brown's statement was not available yesterday in the
Sacramento secretary of state's office, because he filed
in Los Angeles.
However, Brown's campaign press secretary, Barbara
Metzger, said the campaign received $1.6 million and
spent $1.1 million between June 30 and Sept. 23. She did
not detail contributions.
N.Y. pressmen end walkout
New York — Striking pressmen overwhelmingly
ratified a new contract with the New York Post yesterday,
ending their union's eight-week walkout at the after

noon daily, a union official said.
However, it was not immediately clear whether the
Post would be able to publish today. Typographers, who
have a long-term contract with the Post, had returned to
their jobs before the pressmen took their vote, but three
other unions remain on strike.
The Post's action puts the publishers of the Times and
the Daily News under pressure to come to quick terms
with pressmen and other unions.
Senate rejects ERA rescissions
Washington — The Senate rejected by a 64-26 vote
yesterday the first of two proposals to let state legisla
tures withdraw their approval of the Equal Rights
Amendment if other states are given additional time to
ratify it.
The Senate will vote today on a less far-reaching
amendment by Sen. Jake Carn (R-Utah) which would
apply only to future votes to rescind approval of the ERA.
The deadline for ERA backers to win ratification votes
from three-fourths of the states is next March 22. The
House has approved extending the deadline to June 30,
1982.
The ERA has been ratified by 35 legislatures, but those
of Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska and Tennessee have
voted to rescind their actions.

Carter will veto public works bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday he will veto the $10.2 billion public works bill
passed by Congress because it is inflationary and wastes
the taxpayers' money.
Democratic leaders predicted in advance they could
muster sufficient votes in Congress to override Carter s
veto, but the president told reporters in his Oval Office
he is determined to make it stick.
"It is important that I and the Congress set an example
for the rest of the nation in controlling inflation. This
public works bill is exactly the wrong example," Carter
said in a brief statement.
The measure passed both houses of Congress by mar
gins much larger than the two-thirds majorities needed
to put it into effect without the president's signature.
Former CIA official's body found
Baltimore — Authorities said yesterday that a body
dragged from Chesapeake Bay belted with divers'
weights was that of a former high-ranking Central Intel
ligence Agency official. Police said he had been shot in
the head.
The decomposing body of John Paisley, 55, of
Washington, was identified through dental charts by the
state medical examiner. It had Deen found Sunday.
Paisley's death could have been suicide or murder,
according to Bill Clark of the state police.
Paisley retired in 1974 after serving as deputy director
of the ClA's Office of Strategic Research. For the past six
months, he was a consultant to the accounting firm
Coopers & Lydrand.
A CIA spokesman refused comment on the case
beyond saying that "we are not involved in the investiga
tion in any way but we will cooperate if asked."
Physician had warned pope
Vatican City — Pope John Paul I's physician said yes
terday he told the pontiff a few days before his death that
he could not continue such a strenuous pace. And an
ultra-conservative Roman Catholic group has demanded
"a judicial inquiry" into the cause of the pope's death.

Dr. Antonio de Ros, Pope john Paul's personal physi
cian when he was Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of
Venice, told the AP in a telephone interview that the
burden of the pontificate and the sensitivity of Luciani
possibly were contributing factors in his heart attack.
An organization called Civilta Cristiana, said it has filed
a formal petition with the Vatican Courts of Justice to
"open a judicial inquiry to ascertain the true causes" of
the pope's death.
But Cardinal Silvio Oddi said the Sacred College "will
not even discuss the issue. We know for certain that the
death of John Paul I was because his heart ceased to beat
due to natural causes."
Refinery explosion kills three
Denver — A series of fiery explosions felt for 30 miles
killed at least three workers at an oil refinery yesterday,
authorities said. Plant officials said a malfunctioning
valve may have leaked gases into the air, triggering the
blasts.
The explosions at the Continental Oil Co. facility
created brilliant orange fireballs and sent thick black
smoke thousands of feet into the air. Pieces of twisted
and charred metal were found up to two miles from the
plant.
Hospitals in the area reported that eight plant
employees and three other persons were injured, sev
eral of them critically burned.
Plant manager Robert Alexander said damage might
run to between $5 and $10 million unless the equipment
within the fire area could be salvaged.

Committee received $323,543.74 from contributors and
$321,500 transferring from the related Younger-Curb

Sacramento secretary of state's office, because he filed
in Los Angeles.

Metzger, said the campaign received $1.6 million and
spent $1.1 million between June 30 and Sept. 23. She did
not detail contributions.
N.Y. pressmen end walkout
New York — Striking pressmen overwhelmingly
ratified a new contract with the New York Post yesterday,
ending their union's eight-week walkout at the after

noon daily, a union official said.
However, it was not immediately clear whether the
Post would be able to publish today. Typographers, who
have a long-term contract with the Post, had returned to
their jobs before the pressmen took their vote, but three
other unions remain on strike.
The Post's action puts the publishers of the Times and
the Daily News under pressure to come to quick terms
with pressmen and other unions.
Senate rejects ERA rescissions
Washington — The Senate rejected by a 64-26 vote
yesterday the first of two proposals to let state legisla
tures withdraw their approval of the Equal Rights
Amendment if other states are given additional time to
ratify it.
The Senate will vote today on a less far-reaching
amendment by Sen. Jake Carn (R-Utah) which would
apply only to future votes to rescind approval of the ERA.
The deadline for ERA backers to win ratification votes
from three-fourths of the states is next March 22. The
House has approved extending the deadline to June 30,
1982.
The ERA has been ratified by 35 legislatures, but those
of Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska and Tennessee have
voted to rescind their actions.
