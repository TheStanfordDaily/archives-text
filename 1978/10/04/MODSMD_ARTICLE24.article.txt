# Ticketing grace period over
## 
### KATHY ANDREWS 
Campus police ended their post
registration grace period Monday
and began ticketing illegally-parked
cars.
Captain Bill Wullschlegar said
drivers who violated the state vehicle
code by parking in front of fire hyd
rants or crosswalks were cited during
the five-day grace period. The ticket
moratorium only affected drivers
whose cars bore either improper
stickers or none at all.
Parking division secretary Carol
Christiansen said about 19,000 stic
kers are issued to the University
community each year.
"We really don't know how many
of these vehicles are on the campus
at any one time," Christiansen said.
Wullschlegar said the number of

cars ticketed varies daily. Some
times, as many as 300 are issued.
No statistics on the number of
University residents who actually pay
their fines are available, according to
Mary Montoya, Chief Deputy Court
Clerk for the Municipal Court in Palo
Alto.
Montoya explained that the filing
and disposition statistics for the Uni
versity are recorded with tickets is
sued by the Sheriff's Deputies, the
Los Altos Police Department, the
Highway Patrol, and those issued in
Mountain View and at the El Camino
Hospital.
She said in October 1977, 1919 out
of 3403 ticket fines were paid.
The Palo Alto Municipal Court re
ceives $2 per ticket from offenders
who do pay their fines.

"Stanford does not get a rebate on
these tickets like a city does, because
Stanford is private property,"
Wullschlager explained.
The University does profit from the
sale of zone and designated residen
tial stickers, he said. Revenues go to
the Stanford Transportation Fund,
which operates the Marguerite bus
service and supports the bicycle
safety campaign.
Zone stickers are priced according
to the lot's proximity to the central
campus area (A-$6O, B-$4O, and
C-$l5). A stickers are for the closest
zones. Designated dorm, row and
residential stickers cost $15.
Stickers can be purchased bet
ween 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays
at the Department of Public Safety on
Serra Street.
