# Petition deadline on Friday
## SCLC: 'obscure job' 
### VANCE MASON 
The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC), without full
student representation for two
years, will continue that way if no
one applies this week, according
to James Lyons, dean of student
affairs.
Candidates for the three stu
dent positions must submit peti
tions, with 25 signatures, to the
ASSU Office by 4 p.m. Friday.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Will Nixon said yesterday no peti
tions have been filed. The SCLC
petition deadline was arbitrarily
set, he said, because, "There are
almost no provisions regarding
the election procedure or tim
ing."
'Obscure job'
"The problem is that it's an
obscure job and few, if any, know
what the council is," Nixon
explained. Also, "the ASSU
doesn't have a large enough
budget to advertise the student
SCLC positions."
The SCLC is a legislative body,
empowered to alter the Honor
Code and other parts of the legis
lative and judicial charter.
Lyons said no one is running for
the council, because "it's not a

political job and there hasn't been
much activity since it revised the
Honor Code three years ago."
"The Honor Code Commission
does a lot of what the SCLC used
to do anyway," said Andrew Gol
denkranz, Council of Presidents
(COP) member.
The commission was recom
mended by the SCLC, when it re
vised the code.
No 'crying need'
"There isn't a crying need for
the SCLC right now," Lyons said.
"But, something could happen
where we would need the SCLC.
Let's say an off-campus fraternity
starts hazing students.
"Since Residential Education,
which usually controls these types
of situations, has no jurisdiction,
the SCLC would be called upon to
initiate procedures for dealing
with it."
The SCLC is one of three groups
created by the University, under
the Legislative and judicial Char
ter, adopted in 1968.
Current council members in
clude Lyons, COP member Mary
Morimoto, ASSU Senate chair
person Fred Crethel and six fa
culty members.
