# Peer advising may answer student needs
## 
### TOM NEWELL 
Peer advising has started at Tran
cos, an all-freshman dorm, as a new
answer to an old problem — unsatis
factory academic counseling.
The program was launched by stu
dents, who found the current system
inadequate, according to Greg Lar
son, a member of the 1977 Council of
Presidents.
"There can be little doubt that
academic advising is one of Stan
ford's institutional failures," he said.
Instead of turning to their faculty
advisers, Larson said 60 percent of
students turn to other students and
that advice "often is untrained."
Advising associates
"Each freshman not only has been
assigned a regular adviser, but a stu
dent advising associate," said Alison
Ross, one of the program'sfounders.
"We wanted to complement faculty
and staff advising, not replace it."
"There are times when we disag
ree, the adviser and myself, but so
far, we haven't had any problems,"
said student associate Nancy Wilson.
"We both usually get our two bits
in."
Todd Smith, a faculty adviser for
four years, likes the diversity of opin
ion. "There is essentially no overlap
in the services that the two advisers
bring to the group. Their points of
view may coincide, but then again, if
they diverge, that's all the better."
"Two advisers ought to be better
than one," said Ralph Keller, a 13-
year faculty adviser.
"Advisers need to be more atten
tive to their advisees' needs. But only
students have had the real experi
ence in knowing the kinds of prob
lems that students must face on a day

to day basis," he said.
"An advising associate's role is far
stronger during registration because
they are going through it (too)," said
Pat Nabti, a Trancos resident fellow.
"A faculty adviser is more valuable
when it comes to choosing a major,
or deciding whether or not to go to
graduate school or even in looking at
career possibilities."
"Everyone felt much more com
fortable with the advising associates
around," said Michel Nabti, the
other Trancos fellow. "The advisers
welcomed the addition of the stu
dents, and the students felt that it
was not on their shoulders alone."
Advisers less anxious
The Nabtis said that the advisers'
anxiety seemed to be less at the be
ginning of this year than in the past.
"Advisers used to feel that they
had to give answers to questions
even if they were unsure of them
selves," Pat Nabti said.
"There has been a lot of exchange
between the advisers and the advis
ing associates."
Though none of the participants in
this experimental program has
noticed problems so far, University
officials are concerned.
"Peer advising operates under the
same handicaps that all advising op
erates under," said Robert Hamrdla,
a faculty adviser and Larkin resident
fellow. That includes "students hav
ing too many expectations. No one
can be expected to know everything
about the University."
Alexander, Fetter, associate dean of
undergraduate studies, worries
about the financial commitment of a
full-scale program, resembling the

Trancos experiment.
"We're talking about a serious fi
nancial commitment of between
$15,000 and $20,000. The question we
must ask ourselves is whether the
improvement in the advising prog
ram would warrant putting this type
of money into it,"he said.
Choosing associates
Fetter is also worried about prob
lems involved in choosing advising
associates.
"Who is going to select 200 stu
dents to work as advising associates?

This office doesn't have the time or
the personnel to choose them," he
said. •
"The logistics would be stagger
ing." Fetter also expressed concern
about finding enough qualified ad
vising associates.
"This experiment arose out of
spontaneous student interest. I
would like to keep it that way. I
would like to see the student interest
first," Fetter said.
Studies in 1974 and 1977 show dis
satisfaction with the advising system,

Larson said.
A 1974 survey by the Bridge and the
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs
surveyed 613 randomly-selected stu
dents, he said. Twenty-six percent
cited advising as a positive experi
ence and 74 percent complained.
In 1977, the Dean of Under
graduate Studies conducted a survey
on advising. Of the 47 items on the
questionnaire, freshman advising
programs received the lowest aver
age response (2.21 on a scale of 5.0),
Larson said.
