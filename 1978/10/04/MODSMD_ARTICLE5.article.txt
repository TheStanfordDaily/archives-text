# Artists' retreat offers isolation
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
For many artists, creativity requires concentration,
solitude and a large room. But on a bustling college
campus, open spaces and isolation are sometimes hard
to find.
Stanford has solved that problem for seven graduate
art students. Tucked away off Searsville Road in one of
the quietest spots on campus is the so-called Bleeker
Area — three buildings which have been filled with
massive studios and artistic accouterment for more than
10 years.
'Large spaces'
"I need large spaces of time to be alone and do my
work," explained first-year graduate art student Susan
Jacobsen. "This area is ideal because I can come in any
time and paint."
Jacobsen has one of the biggest studios in Bleeker
Hall, the largest of the three buildings. Price and Barnes
halls also contain studios and art storage areas.
Students at Bleeker provide their own materials and
studio furnishings. Remains of a handmade kiln are still
scattered on the grounds, proof of one artist's creative
endeavors.
Most artists, however, are not quite so ambitious.
Except for one sculptor, all of the students at Bleeker are
painters, and so don't need the heavy, bulky equipment

common in printmaking, photography and pottery
fields. While the University's studio program does have
some printmakers and photographers, these craftsmen
prefer to have their "offices" closer to the heart of cam
pus.
Noise problems
Although Bleeker is hidden in the trees off Searsville,
there don't seem to be enough barriers between noise
and interruptions and the studios to satisfy all the artists.
Jacobsen has papered her windows to prevent passersby
from peering into her studio.
"We get a lot of curious people who try to see what's
in these buildings," she said. "You just can't create and
socialize at the same time, so occasionally I just don't
answer the door."
Respect for privacy
In addition, the artists try to respect each other's
needs for privacy, coming together only to help with
grounds maintenance or to share tools.
But these artists are not as hermit-like as they may
appear, Jacobsen added.
"The need for concentration varies among artists,"
she said. "I just need a little more privacy than others."
And while Bleeker Area is off limits to most people,
the artists' colony often opens its doors to the under
graduate, graduate and faculty artists invited to the
weekly seminars and coffees sponsored by the students.
