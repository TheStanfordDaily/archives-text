## Editorial Adieu 
### 
While not surprising, Monday's
U.S. Supreme Court decision not to
reconsider its May 31 Zurcher v. Stan
ford Daily decision allowing surprise
searches of newspapers and other
third parties not suspected of a crime
strikes us, once again, as a disavowal
of the rights thought to be guaran
teed citizens of this country by the
First and Fourth Amendments to the
Constitution.
The Court's ruling not only allows
search warrants to be served on
newspapers and other media, but
also against any individual not sus
pected of a crime. Now, the private
and confidential files, whether in
place of home or business, of
lawyers, doctors, psychiatrists,
businesses and private citizens are
susceptible to search by law en
forcement officials in possession of a
search warrant. This is reality, not
hypothetical theorization.
The Daily filed a petition for re
hearing in late June in the belief the
Court inadequately addressed the
question of reasonableness in the
search of the Daily's offices, even in
light of the guidelines prescribed in
that decision pertaining to third
party searches. The Daily also held
that the Court's reasoning in the
majority opinion written by Justice
Byron White was faulty and mis
directed.
We were hopeful the Court would
see the problems in its opinion and
in its consequences, but hardly ex
pected the Court to reconsider the
case, an action it rarely takes.

So now the court battles are over
for us and for the many groups and
individuals who supported us for the
last seven years. We can only offer
them our thanks in the belief that
what they have done was not in vain.
A ninth-inning loss, coming after vic
tories in Federal District Court and
the U.S. Court of Appeals is hard t6
accept without bitterness, but a
tough loss by no means indicates the
battle wasn't worth fighting.
The refusal of the Court to rehear
the case points the finger at Con
gress and state legislatures as the
bodies able to thwart the consequ
ences of the ruling. The decision in
the case hinted at Congress' power
to legislate against surprise searches
of third parties.
Fortunately, several state legisla
tures and members of the U.S.
House and Senate have introduced
legislation preventing searches of
newspapers and, in some cases, of
any third party not suspected of a
crime.
California became the first state to
prohibit searches of newspapers and
other media offices last week when
Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation
introduced by Assemblyman Terry
Goggin into law. We only hope that
many more such laws will be enacted
around the nation before overzeal
ous law enforcement officials take
advantage of their new-found
privilege to make use of the media or
any other third party as investigatory
tools.
