Secret ballot
supported
Concerning Rob Docters'
column in Thursday's Daily
(Sept. 28); I must vehemently
protest his assertion that open
ballots are desirable.
Docters begins, "I would
suggest that being able to
exercise a power . . . without
having to be individually ac
countable is the definition of
irresponsible." He mentions
voting only as a "power,"
never as an intrinsic right of
men (and women). The Decla
ration of Independence states,
. . To secure these rights
(life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness), Governments are
instituted among men, deriv
ing their just powers from the
consent of the governed. . . ."
Voting is not a power that is
granted to us, it is a right. It is
the responsibility of all of us to
ensure that no one is intimi
dated into voting against his or
her true feelings, lest at some
point in the future we are the
ones who cannot freely exer
cise our rights.
Docters goes on to state that
one of the "positive" points of
open ballots would be the vir
tual extinction of the Nazi party
in his home state. While I also
consider the dissolution of the
Nazi party to be desirable, I
would rather that it come to an

end through voluntary lack of
support on the part of its
members, rather than by sup
pression. It is important to
notice that the only criterion
mentioned by Docters to sup
port his viewpoint is that he
finds it unfortunate that the
party received any votes. I ask,
what other viewpoints does he
find objectionable, and to what
lengths is he willing to go to
ensure that they will not be
supported?
Docters writes, "First, if one
believes in private property
and private ownership, one
must concede that (the firing of
employees by bosses with op
posing political viewpoints) as
the right of the owners." Own
ers? Having a man work foryou
does not in my opinion consti
tute ownership. In addition, it
is possible to believe in private
property and also the human
rights of the employed; they
are not mutually exclusive. For
Docters to take such an
either/or position is overly
simplistic.
Docters states unequivocally
that "it is highly unlikely that
such large scale reprisals (to
employees) will occur. . .
Besides being off the point
(any reprisal to any employee is
still wrong) this statement
shows a lack of perception on
the part of Docters. Only 25
years ago this country experi
enced the McCarthy Era,
perhaps the most frightening

period in our history.
The importance of the secret
ballot is evident; it is abso
lutely necessary to ensure that
each voter can vote as his con
science dictates without fear of
economic or possibly even vio
lent reprisals.

Concerning Rob Docters'
column in Thursday's Daily
(Sept. 28); I must vehemently
protest his assertion that open
ballots are desirable.
Docters begins, "I would
suggest that being able to
exercise a power . . . without
having to be individually ac
countable is the definition of
irresponsible." He mentions
voting only as a "power,"
never as an intrinsic right of
men (and women). The Decla
ration of Independence states,
. . To secure these rights
(life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness), Governments are
instituted among men, deriv
ing their just powers from the
consent of the governed. . . ."
Voting is not a power that is
granted to us, it is a right. It is
the responsibility of all of us to
ensure that no one is intimi
dated into voting against his or
her true feelings, lest at some
point in the future we are the
ones who cannot freely exer
cise our rights.
Docters goes on to state that
one of the "positive" points of
open ballots would be the vir
tual extinction of the Nazi party
in his home state. While I also
consider the dissolution of the
Nazi party to be desirable, I
would rather that it come to an

end through voluntary lack of
support on the part of its
members, rather than by sup
pression. It is important to
notice that the only criterion
mentioned by Docters to sup
port his viewpoint is that he
finds it unfortunate that the
party received any votes. I ask,
what other viewpoints does he
find objectionable, and to what
lengths is he willing to go to
ensure that they will not be
supported?
Docters writes, "First, if one
believes in private property
and private ownership, one
must concede that (the firing of
employees by bosses with op
posing political viewpoints) as
the right of the owners." Own
ers? Having a man work foryou
does not in my opinion consti
tute ownership. In addition, it
is possible to believe in private
property and also the human
rights of the employed; they
are not mutually exclusive. For
Docters to take such an
either/or position is overly
simplistic.
Docters states unequivocally
that "it is highly unlikely that
such large scale reprisals (to
employees) will occur. . .
Besides being off the point
(any reprisal to any employee is
still wrong) this statement
shows a lack of perception on
the part of Docters. Only 25
years ago this country experi
enced the McCarthy Era,
perhaps the most frightening

period in our history.
The importance of the secret
ballot is evident; it is abso
lutely necessary to ensure that
each voter can vote as his con
science dictates without fear of
economic or possibly even vio
lent reprisals.
