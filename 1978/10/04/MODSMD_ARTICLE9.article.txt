## CRAP proposal a weak solution 
### 
Having been asked to write about the
CRAP amendment, I am reminded of Art
Hoppe's usage of "the goose that laid the
golden egg" as a means of explaining the
Proposition 13 phenomenon. Briefly, the
villagers killed the goose to stop her from
shitting all over the place, and realized too
late (alas!) that the occasional golden egg
arrived no more. The saddened residents
had learned their lesson the hard way —
that performing surgery with a meat
cleaver will no doubt have its drawbacks.
CRAP has risen out of a valid concern
that the ASSU Senate is wasting a) their
own time and monev, and b) everyone
else's time and money. It seems that the
basic problem of organizational inertia has
overtaken this body. Concerns about pro
cess, means and media have clouded and
distorted the true ends of the Senate —
namely, to provide meaningful legislation
and a good information flow with respect
to the students in the University commun
ity and the University in the world com
munity. In the rare case in which purpose
ful legislation emerges, there is virtually
no power to implement proposals. The
Senate in its present form simply doesn't
have the kick behind it to make its prog
rams go. Whether it is calculated ineffi
ciency (on the part of those who would
just as soon see the Senate die), or simple
incompetence (on the part of those who
are now involved), that is at the root of the
problem and may give some indication as
to the potential solution. Neither explana
tion excuses the fact that the Senate simply

isn't working.
Faced with the stark reality of an ineffec
tive, indecisive and oscillating Senate,
there are two possible solutions: a) work
for a viable. Senate or b) eliminate it en
tirely. As a result we have been presented
with a variety of proposals for reform or
removal: geographical districting,
academic districting, the"live petition (in
which market forces determine both the
size and composition of the body), more
money, less money, and the subject of
today, simply trashing the whole bunch.
Whether the Senate can function effec
tively is in large part determined, not by
structural factors, bJt simply by the indi
viduals who participate from year to year.
It may very well be, as Deric Jennings
pointed out in the Elections Review Board
report of last spring, that the very process
discourages those people who would be
the most successful as agents of change. In
any event, at least a significant change of
the selection/election process is certainly
needed, in addition to any structural
changes that may be made. And on the
topic of selection, it is worth pointing out
that Doug Bandow, the whistle-blower,
was a senator for two years, and one of the
key characters in the circus he now so
sharply criticizes. He may be merely point
ing out his own inefficiency in office. Out
of good grace I will include the likely re
sponse to that admittedly low blow: Bill
Buckley says of his brother, Sen. )im, "If a
person like him can't make the system
work, then it becomes untenable by defin

ition.
The virtue of CRAP is that it will force
those of us who tare just a little bit to take a
good hard look at the ASSU Senate, at the
ASSU as a whole, and at our relationship as
students with a University that pays sur
prisingly little attention to what we have to
say. It may be that the Senate can't work;
that it is more a barrier to any sort of mean
ingful change than it is an agent of that
change. That is what will be decided next
week — the Senate's future is in your
hands whether you vote or not. So vote. A
25 percent turnout won't be a very good
indication of anything.
At any rate, my choice is made. I will
vote against CRAP for the following
reasons: 1) I'm just naive enough to be
lieve (hope against hope!) that the ASSU is
strong enough to build a functioning, ef
fective Senate that can hold it's own in
University decision-making; 2) I am, I
think, experienced enough to know that
there are some things the Senate is good
forand some things for which itisn't— my
belief is that a judicious use of Senate re
sources is a highly productive activity (or
lat least it can be) — but that expecting too
much will lead to sure dissatisfaction; 3)
we in the COP would get all the (ahem!)
power now vested in the Senate, and I'm
not sure I like that idea, and 4) you don't
carelessly tear something down like this
without offering a viable replacement.
