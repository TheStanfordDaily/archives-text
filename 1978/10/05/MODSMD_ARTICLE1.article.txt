# Lawrence returns
## Pilot completes circumference of U.S. 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
"I'd do it again tomorrow if I
had an excuse," said Palo Alto's
Hal Lawrence as he stepped from
the cockpit of his motor-glider
yesterday after becoming the first
man to pilot an aircraft of any kind
along the entire circumference of
the continental United States.
He was greeted at Palo Alto Air
port by a crowd of cheering and
banner-waving friends and rela
tives bearing numerous gifts and
even more numerous bottles of
champagne.
"I'm glad to be home," he said,
"but I enjoyed all the places I've
been."
He went to quite a few.
Lawrence left Palo Alto Airport
Aug. 15, flew north to the Cana
dian border and followed it east to

Maine. There he turned south,
traveled down the Atlantic coast,
rounded the tip of Florida, and
journeyed west past the Gulf of
Mexico and across Texas. When
he reached the Pacific, he flew
north once again until he arrived
back home seven weeks and
18,000 miles later.
The trip was not without its ad
ventures, Lawrence said. Over
Key West, Florida, the plane was
hit by lightning, but fortunately
was not damaged. Lawrence was
delayed by storms for three days
in Minnesota and six days in
Texas.
Seven co-pilots, located all ac
ross the country, assisted Lawr
ence with the flight. One man
flew in the aircraft while the other
followed on the ground in a
mobile home. They usually met

twice a day, once at lunch to ex
change pilot and driver positions,
and once in the evening when
both retreated to the mobile
home for a night's sleep.
Each co-pilot traveled with
Lawrence for several thousand
miles before returning home,
while another man joined the trip.
However, Lawrence was the only
man to complete the entire jour
ney. His co-pilots occupations
ranged from a former fighter pilot
to a tavern owner.
Lawrence himself is a consul
tant who used to work for a local
advertising agency.
"''m 56 years old, I think," he
said.
Lawrence's plane is the only
one of its kind in the country. It is
a motor-glider with a 60-foot
wingspan and a small Volkswagen

engine in the nose. It was built in
Rumania and Lawrence said he
bought it last year at the Paris air
show with his recent trip in mind.
The craft carries enough gas to
run its engine for only three
hours, but Lawrence said much of
the journey was spent with the
engine off and the plane gliding
gently over the countryside at a
speed of about 70 knots.
On his best day, Lawrence said
he covered 600 miles, but his av
erage was between 300 and 400.
One of his co-pilots reached a
maximum altitude of 15,000 feet.
Lawrence said that all his co
pilots chipped in to help pay for
the flight. He said he wants to sell
the mobile home, which was
bought specifically for the trip,
but he intends to keep his plane.
