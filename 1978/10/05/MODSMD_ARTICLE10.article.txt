# Copyright laws enforced
## 
### BEN POLLOCK 
While most students will not
have to worry about the new
copyright law, faculty mem
bers and librarians may find
that the law makes more work
for them, according to head
Meyer librarian Elizabeth
Salzer.
The law will probably not af
fect students because it does
"provide for an individual to
make one photocopy for per
sonal use," Salzer said.
However, the new law does
require that libraries acquire
permission from the publisher
before copying materials.
Meyer staff are now placing en
tire books on reserve because
it would be too time consum
ing to wait for photocopying
permission for a single article
or chapter, Salzer said.
Faculty members must now
submit reserve material re
quests several weeks in ad
vance to allow enough time for
the library staff to secure
photocopying permission.
Salzer added that any delay
by professors in submitting
their reserve requests may
mean that articles will not be
available at the start of a quar
ter.
The copyright law went into
effect in January — the first
major revision of such laws
since 1909. U.S. copyright laws
are based on a system ap
proved by the British parlia
ment some 200 years ago.
Salzer said the 1909 version
of the law contained no provi

sions for the duplication of
copyrighted material. She said
the rules governing this area
have developed gradually
through various court deci
sions based on "fair use" of
copyright material.
According to an American
Library Association
Washington Newsletter, "fair
use. . .allowscopyingwithout
permission from, or payment
to, the copyright owner where
the use is reasonable and not
harmful to the rights of the
copyright owner."
Salzer said the revision
makes the "fair use" provision
obligatory.
Copyright permission for
more than a specified amount
of a work is required under the
new law. This includes copying
more than 250 words of a poem
or more than 10 percent from a
performable unit of music.
As for royalties, Salzer said
some publishers request them
but others only ask for pay
ment "beyond a certain
number of copies."
Arthur Barnes, director of
the Band, said the Band has felt
"no noticeable change."
"It (the copyright law)
doesn't touch us too much dif
ferently than before, because
we're part of an educational in

stitution."
Barnes added that only re
nted music is subject to royalty
fees. After music is purchased,
it is then legally in the "public
domain" and can be used in
any way.
jerry Persons of the music
library said he uses the same
guidelines employed by the
other campus libraries.
He said, "We have no special
problems just because we loan
music. The music library is part
of the teaching, research and
scholastic environment, too."
Those who violate the new
law can expect to pay (if con
victed) damages up to $50,000
plus court fees. If the court de
termines that the defendant
broke the copyright law for
"personal gain or commercial
advantage," the sentence
would consist of a $10,000 fine
and/or one year's imprison
ment.
Salzer said the library cannot
be held liable for infringe
ments of the law because it has
posted signs stating, "The
copyright law . . . governs the
making of photocopies of
copyrighted material. The per
son using this equipment is li
able for any infringement."
She added that the libraries
do no monitoring.

law can expect to pay (if con
victed) damages up to $50,000
plus court fees. If the court de
termines that the defendant
broke the copyright law for
"personal gain or commercial
advantage," the sentence
would consist of a $10,000 fine
and/or one year's imprison
ment.
Salzer said the library cannot
be held liable for infringe
ments of the law because it has
posted signs stating, "The
copyright law . . . governs the
making of photocopies of
copyrighted material. The per
son using this equipment is li
able for any infringement."
She added that the libraries
do no monitoring.
While most students will not
have to worry about the new
copyright law, faculty mem
bers and librarians may find
that the law makes more work
for them, according to head
Meyer librarian Elizabeth
Salzer.
The law will probably not af
fect students because it does
"provide for an individual to
make one photocopy for per
sonal use," Salzer said.
However, the new law does
require that libraries acquire
permission from the publisher
before copying materials.
Meyer staff are now placing en
tire books on reserve because
it would be too time consum
ing to wait for photocopying
permission for a single article
or chapter, Salzer said.
Faculty members must now
submit reserve material re
quests several weeks in ad
vance to allow enough time for
the library staff to secure
photocopying permission.
Salzer added that any delay
by professors in submitting
their reserve requests may
mean that articles will not be
available at the start of a quar
ter.
The copyright law went into
effect in January — the first
major revision of such laws
since 1909. U.S. copyright laws
are based on a system ap
proved by the British parlia
ment some 200 years ago.
Salzer said the 1909 version
of the law contained no provi

sions for the duplication of
copyrighted material. She said
the rules governing this area
have developed gradually
through various court deci
sions based on "fair use" of
copyright material.
According to an American
Library Association
Washington Newsletter, "fair
use. . .allowscopyingwithout
permission from, or payment
to, the copyright owner where
the use is reasonable and not
harmful to the rights of the
copyright owner."
Salzer said the revision
makes the "fair use" provision
obligatory.
Copyright permission for
more than a specified amount
of a work is required under the
new law. This includes copying
more than 250 words of a poem
or more than 10 percent from a
performable unit of music.
As for royalties, Salzer said
some publishers request them
but others only ask for pay
ment "beyond a certain
number of copies."
Arthur Barnes, director of
the Band, said the Band has felt
"no noticeable change."
"It (the copyright law)
doesn't touch us too much dif
ferently than before, because
we're part of an educational in

stitution."
Barnes added that only re
nted music is subject to royalty
fees. After music is purchased,
it is then legally in the "public
domain" and can be used in
any way.
jerry Persons of the music
library said he uses the same
guidelines employed by the
other campus libraries.
He said, "We have no special
problems just because we loan
music. The music library is part
of the teaching, research and
scholastic environment, too."
Those who violate the new
law can expect to pay (if con
victed) damages up to $50,000
plus court fees. If the court de
