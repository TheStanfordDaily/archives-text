# New liquor license sparks controversy
## 
### PAN DEMETRAKAKES 
A proposed liquor store in
Palo Alto has drawn fire from
its would-be neighbors. Their
complaints prompted the city
council Monday to order a staff
investigation.
Beltramo's Liquors received
a license last August to open a
store at the corner of
Middlefield Road and Bryson
Court.
Bryson Court residents have
appealed the license, filing a
protest with the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board (ABC).
The residents claim that the
store would create traffic prob
lems on their dead-end street.
They also said that there are
too many liquor-selling
businesses in the area.
Bryson Court resident Glenn
Dodds told the council, "We
have a shopping center, three
grocery stores, a pizza parlor
and a 7-11, and all of these
places sell beer."
"The biggest issue is public
safety," Dodds said. "We al
ready have 19,000 cars a day
there. Another thing is, the
only entrance to the liquor
store would be on our road."
Councilman Byron Sher
moved that the city staff

examine these complaints to
decide whether the city should
join the protest to the ABC.
His motion passed, 5-3, with
councilmembers Roy Clay and
Annie Witherspoon and Mayor
Scott Carey dissenting.
Witherspoon said she voted
"no" because, "Beltramo's has
an excellent reputation in
Menlo Park and if we have a
liquor store here it should be
Beltramo's."
Carey pointed out that the
proposed site had recently
been zoned "commercial" and
thatthe new zoning law did not
differentiate between liquor
stores and other businesses.
Councilman Ellen Brenner,
who voted for the motion,
said, "Recognizing that it's
within the zoning laws
suggests to me that the law is
too broad. I hope we could ex
press disapproval of this par
ticular use at this particular
place."
Dodds told the Council that
residents protesting the
license have until today to
submit $600 to the ABC. Then
the appeal process will start, he
said.
