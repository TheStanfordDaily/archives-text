# Editor's perspective
## Have a good laugh! 
### 
Last week, when our contract for
the Peanuts cartoon strip was can
celed by United Features due to
exclustivity claims by the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, all of the Daily staff
were upset at the incident.
Today, our concerns have di
minished precipitously by the reali
zation that the Daily has added two
very talented local cartoonists.
Dupie, a strip by sophomore Gil
Morales, and J. Moist and Company,
created by Menlo Park resident Chris
Jurich, are artistically drawn,

humorous and deserve your atten
tion.
Yesterday our offices rang with
laughter at several of the new strips
by Gil and Chris that will start appear
ing tomorrow.
I encourage you to turn to page 6
today and read their cartoon every
morning. You deserve a good laugh
to start the day. We at the Daily be
lieve these new cartoon features will
give the needed morning boost.
