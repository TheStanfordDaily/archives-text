## ASSU Senate necessary for representation 
### 
After the ballots are counted in the fall elections,
the ASSU Senate may no longer exist. Two other
proposals aimed at reforming the senate failed to
make the ballot mainly because their supporters
started their petition drive too late in the spring. The
senate has its critics and its supporters; the critics
would abolish it, while the supporters are in near
unanimous agreement that profound structural
change is needed.
Foryears, control of the senate has oscillated wildly
between radicals and conservatives. The present
structure gives large slates of candidates a substantial
advantage over individuals or small slates. Thus, a
relatively small but cohesive campus interest group
can field a large slate and win big. Once in office the
temptation to play power politics has often proven
irresistable. No accountability mechanism exists and
there is no incentive to work hard on complex prob
lems such as teaching evaluation and improvement,
housing, and curriculum revision.
Senate prestige hit a new low after last fall's elec
tion in the wake of the ASSU Election Commissioner's
investigation of campaign irregularities. An Election
Review Board, consisting of five students, judged 19
of 40 senators and alternates guilty of campaign viola
tions ranging from lying to obstructing the investiga
tion. Two senators were disqualified, one senator
suspended for a quarter, and 16 others were cen

sured or reprimanded. The obvious comparison with
Watergate was quickly drawn and shadowed the se
nate all year long.
Debate over the fate of the senate should focus on
several fundamental questions. What is the role of
students in the governance of the University? What
role if any should student government play in campus
governance? Indeed, what is the purpose of a student
government?
If the senate is abolished, by what structure or rules
will students organize to participate in decision
making? If the senate is to continue, how can it be
reformed so as to be regarded as legitimate by stu
dents, faculty, administrators, and trustees? What is
sues are appropriate for the senate to address? How
closely should a student senate model itself after the
Faculty Senate? Are there reforms which make a
hard-working, accountable ASSU Senate possible?
How can student government attract more of the
conscientious people who are most often responsi
ble for real accomplishment, and fewer of the self
sen'ing glory-seekers, full of sound and fury, but
signifying nothing?
The report of the Elections Review Board was com
pleted too late in the spring for any impact last year,
but deserves some attention now. This report, availa
ble in the bookstore, explores many of the most seri
ous flaws of the present system and how candidates
run afoul of the elections regulations. Additionally,

the report contains several proposals for senate re
form and an analysis of each. Any serious attempt to
reform the senate must begin with this document.
The fate of the senate is not trivial. Any interest
group, such as students, which is unorganized runs
the risk of being ignored in decision-making; this is
no revelation to anyone at an intellectual level, but
students frequently ignore it in practice. Students
here are already at a disadvantage in the campus
governance system which runs by committee be
cause students are only here for an average of four
years.
Only with solid organizational effort and effectively
directed energy can students compensate for their
inherent handicap in governance. Faculty committee
members and the administrative staff generally know
the work of the committee very well; unless students
are content with being decorative tokens, they must
display above average zeal and sophistication to par
ticipate effectively. The senate in the past has not
served as the intellectual and organizational center of
student participation; it ought to. The chief problem
of the senate is not a powerlessness imposed by fa
culty and administrative repression, but an impo
tence resulting from a lost sense of purpose and a
lack of will to find one.

conscientious people who are most often responsi
ble for real accomplishment, and fewer of the self
sen'ing glory-seekers, full of sound and fury, but
signifying nothing?
The report of the Elections Review Board was com
pleted too late in the spring for any impact last year,
but deserves some attention now. This report, availa
ble in the bookstore, explores many of the most seri
ous flaws of the present system and how candidates
run afoul of the elections regulations. Additionally,

the report contains several proposals for senate re
form and an analysis of each. Any serious attempt to
reform the senate must begin with this document.
The fate of the senate is not trivial. Any interest
group, such as students, which is unorganized runs
the risk of being ignored in decision-making; this is
no revelation to anyone at an intellectual level, but
students frequently ignore it in practice. Students
here are already at a disadvantage in the campus
governance system which runs by committee be
cause students are only here for an average of four
years.
Only with solid organizational effort and effectively
directed energy can students compensate for their
inherent handicap in governance. Faculty committee
members and the administrative staff generally know
the work of the committee very well; unless students
are content with being decorative tokens, they must
display above average zeal and sophistication to par
ticipate effectively. The senate in the past has not
served as the intellectual and organizational center of
student participation; it ought to. The chief problem
of the senate is not a powerlessness imposed by fa
culty and administrative repression, but an impo
tence resulting from a lost sense of purpose and a
lack of will to find one.

After the ballots are counted in the fall elections,
the ASSU Senate may no longer exist. Two other
proposals aimed at reforming the senate failed to
make the ballot mainly because their supporters
started their petition drive too late in the spring. The
senate has its critics and its supporters; the critics
would abolish it, while the supporters are in near
unanimous agreement that profound structural
change is needed.
Foryears, control of the senate has oscillated wildly
between radicals and conservatives. The present
structure gives large slates of candidates a substantial
advantage over individuals or small slates. Thus, a
relatively small but cohesive campus interest group
can field a large slate and win big. Once in office the
temptation to play power politics has often proven
irresistable. No accountability mechanism exists and
there is no incentive to work hard on complex prob
lems such as teaching evaluation and improvement,
housing, and curriculum revision.
Senate prestige hit a new low after last fall's elec
tion in the wake of the ASSU Election Commissioner's
investigation of campaign irregularities. An Election
Review Board, consisting of five students, judged 19
of 40 senators and alternates guilty of campaign viola
tions ranging from lying to obstructing the investiga
tion. Two senators were disqualified, one senator
suspended for a quarter, and 16 others were cen

sured or reprimanded. The obvious comparison with
Watergate was quickly drawn and shadowed the se
nate all year long.
Debate over the fate of the senate should focus on
several fundamental questions. What is the role of
students in the governance of the University? What
role if any should student government play in campus
governance? Indeed, what is the purpose of a student
government?
If the senate is abolished, by what structure or rules
will students organize to participate in decision
making? If the senate is to continue, how can it be
reformed so as to be regarded as legitimate by stu
dents, faculty, administrators, and trustees? What is
sues are appropriate for the senate to address? How
closely should a student senate model itself after the
Faculty Senate? Are there reforms which make a
hard-working, accountable ASSU Senate possible?
How can student government attract more of the
conscientious people who are most often responsi
ble for real accomplishment, and fewer of the self
sen'ing glory-seekers, full of sound and fury, but
signifying nothing?
