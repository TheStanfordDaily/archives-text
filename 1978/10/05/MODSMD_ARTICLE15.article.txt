## ASSU Senate burden on student government 
### 
The Committee to Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP*
collected the signatures of hundreds of students last
spring to place a constitutional amendment, that
would eliminate the ASSU (student) Senate, on the
fall ballot. The amendment would leave the Council
of Presidents (COP) to run the student government.
The amendment was prompted by the dismal per
fomance of the ASSU Senate over the past years. The
senate has oscillated between leftist, rightist, and
leftist control, and has ignored the great majority of
students. It has bogged down in petty infighting,
passed meaningless resolutions, and created phan
tom committees; political grandstanding and resume
building are endemic to the senate. In fact, one is
hard put to think of anything worthwhile that the
senate has accomplished.
These problems stem from the nature of the senate
itself. As an institution, the senate is simply unable to
cope with student problems. The authority of the
senate is too narrow, the time commitment of its
participants too limited, and the mode of election too
unrepresentative.
First, the power of the senate is simply too con
strained to have any real effect on students or ad
ministrators. It will pass resolutions — which are ig
nored, and create committees — which never meet.
It has control over the ASSU budget, but this power is
more theoretical than real. The senate's authority is
restricted by the administration's contributions to the
budget and the recommendations of the Student Fi
nancial Manager; the discretion that it has is severely
limited.
Similarly, the senate approves the committee ap
pointments of the Nominations Committee. But most
appointments are effectively determined by the
Nominations Committee beforehand, because of the

senate's lack of time and expertise. Again, the power
is more apparent than real.
Second, unlike the members of the COP, who
spend a substantial amount of time at their duties,
senators invariabley don't take their responsibilities
seriously. For example, the Rules Committee, with
seven people, was never able to reach a quorum of
four all last year. Without a time commitment, mat
ters are not covered in committee, studied be-

forehand, or correctly understood. As a result,
senators are simply not able to get an effective grasp
of the ASSU, its problems, and possible solutions.
The CRAP amendment would end it, once and for
all, leaving the COP to handle the affairs of the ASSU.
The COP is taken more seriously by the administra
tion, and has proved itself to be a more responsible
and responsive body over the years; among other
things, its majority vote method of election requires
broader representation of students.
Furthermore, the members of the COP spend a sig
nificant amoung of ti me with the ASSU, and have thus
developed the expertise to more adequately cope
with student problems — the significant ASSU initia
tives on tenure and the quality of teaching have come
from the COP, not the senate.
Passage of the CRAP amendment would not over
burden the COP; the amendment specifically creates
a Finance Committee to share the duties. Nor would
the COP be granted too much power. The power of

the senate is simply too limited; the senate is not an
effective check on the COP, and its elimination will
be no loss. The COP really runs things already.
The senate is not simply useless; rather, it is a
significant burden on effective and responsible stu
dent government. Passage of the CRAP amendment
would actually enhance the reputation and effective
ness of the ASSU as a whole, by eliminating a body
that is perceived as a joke by both students and ad
ministrators.
Furthermore, it would channel students toward the
more productive ASSU activities, such as the COP
and the university committees, rather than wasting
their time, money, and energy on a farce. Finally, it
would save the costs of electing and administering
the senate, and the monumental waste of time and
paper during senate elections.
The time for ending this sham is now. Hundreds of
students put the CRAP amendment on the ballot;
please complete the task by voting for it on October
12 and 13. It's time to end the pain of seeing posturing
politicos taking themselves too seriously.
