## Toward a policy for survival 
### 
For many of us, our parents provide us with education. Others
have been trusted in providing us with clothing, electricity, hous
ing, food, water and jobs. In the procurement of these neces
sities many scientists claim we have used technology disastr
ously.
Our institutions instead of insuring our survival now in many
ways threaten it. Sen. Caylord Nelson fears "the institutions we
have created are destroying the live-ability of the world."
Medicine has brought us death control without population con
trol — resulting in overpopulation. Ninety percent of us reside in
urban areas that have been constructed carelessly. Soil is paved
übiquitously with concrete, asphalt, uildings, and our waste ac
cumulates at the expense of more land.
At last cars, roads, and parking facilities own more land than
the people who use these services in this country. Annually we
build 22,000 more miles of road, 2.5 million new houses, and pour
concrete over 1.5 million acres.
Present day methods for supplying and distributing the energy
we use are wasteful and increasingly dangerous. As the popula
tion grows, our needs exceed what natural resources can possi
bly provide. Oceans and fisheries have smaller catches, the
forests can not regenerate at the rate we harvest, and energy fuel
reserves are used at unprecedented rates. Forests are being
cleared and more land is being brought under cultivation in other
countries to compensate for erosion and to insure that cattle
numbers keep abreast of humans. American rivers rarely take
their natural courses and are damned or are diverted to provide
nearby farmers with irrigation water. In the case of the Colorado,
farmers claims to water now exceed the capacity of the river at

peak flow.
In food processing and distribution, products are favored that
are cosmetically attractive rather than selecting foods which are
wholesome, nutritious, and of superior biological quality.
As a country we waste enormous quantities of resources on
warfare and producing a military capable of protecting these
resources we have secured from our fellow men in other coun
tries.
Our value judgments in this country are essentially economic.
We have set technology on the loose and are easily winning our
war against nature but in such a way as to defeat ourselves
completely.
The issue is one of human survival. We have focused too little
on the future prospects of our children in a world which is rapidly
running out of environment.
The land which supports us has been so overworked that we
must restore artificially nutrients in the forms of fertilizers in ever
increasing quantities to compensate for our poor soil conserva
tion and irrigation methods.
Our corporations work at the limits of technology in almost
every area but one, pollution abatement. It is disgraceful that in
the richest and most powerful country, our economy allots the
bare minimum of .005 percent of GNP to environmental quality.
Fresh water distribution, air enrichment, and a finite amount of
arable land are considerations that future Americans will value far
more and for much longer than our economic system now re
flects in its present policies. These dwindling resources are al
ready in critically short supply in many countries including our
own. The greatest gift to America's future is a guarantee that
these natural blessings of earth, once in abundance, w\l\ be
preserved to add the rich quality we enjoy in our lives to theirs.
As a nation we can formulate a policy to protect the common
heritage that we are drawing so heavily on at present. Certain
solutions are simple: we must waste less, value quality of a lasting
sort, and express concern politically in issues which threaten our
environment.
The best way to fortify and protect the U.S. is through stabiliz
ing other countries by giving them tools to use local materials and
skills to begin a healthy life free from daily fear and hunger.
Labor-intensive projects that provide energy, food, and com
munity services like housing are vitally needed; they can ease
employment problems, reduce needs for energy imports, and
increase self-reliance.
At home an appropriate example of population control is the
first step in making our advisory program overseas regarding the
environment, resources, and population seem more credible.
In the U.S. we could stop employing one fourth of all scientists
in researching death and warfare and use them to research life
and peace. Military expenditures of the world in two days exceed
the entire United Nations budget devoted to furthering interna
tional cooperation between nations. Yet by ignoring critical prob
lems like resource scarcity, population growth, the deterioration
of the environment, and ever-widening gaps between rich and
poor we are exacerbating the tensions that lead to war.
Our private institutions and corporations should be encour
aged to .eflect our desire to meet central human needs, such as
the following: safeguarding the quality of our environment, pro
viding wholesome food in quantities and at prices available to
everyone, devising methods to deal with our disposal and trans
portation problems, and supplying us with clean energy which is
safe and abundant for our future.
The survival of our institutions rests on our ability to use them
to achieve unselfish ends which will affirm life, and not destroy it,
and help us to conform to a blueprint of what nature can
reasonably provide.
