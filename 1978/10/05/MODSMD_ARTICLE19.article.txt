For many students, faculty and staff
members, getting around the campus and
its environs presents a bothersome prob
lem. But the perils of travel by foot, bike or
car can be avoided by using the
University-run Marguerite Shuttlebus sys
tem.
The Marguerite is a fleet of medium
sized buses designed to serve a maximum
area of the campus at a minimum cost. In
the spring of 1976, the first experimental
service began with two old, battered buses
running between Escondido Village and
the Medical Center.
This single line service became perma
nent a year ago. The route was so popular
that an additional trial route serving the
student resident areas of the campus was
started last spring, according to Marguer

ite officials. This extension also became
permanent this fall, making the Marguer
ite accessible from most of the central
campus.
The Marguerite Shuttlebus is managed
by Steve Schmidt and John Pipkin of the
Facilities Planning Office. According to
Schmidt, the system has been a success
from the beginning.
"We wouldn't have expanded on a per
manent basis if we weren't confident of
the demand for the buses," he said.
Schmidt also noted the economy and
efficiency of the Marguerite, which oper
ates at a cost of about $250,000 a year. This
money comes from a portion of the Uni
versity parking fees set aside for an alter
nate transportation system.
The value of the Marguerite was recog
nized in an award presented last year by

the Metropolitan Transportation Commis
sion for the development and operation of
an effective, self-financed transportation
system.
The buses run every 10 minutes from
6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. along their regular
route, and every five minutes from the
Medical Center to the Stanford Shopping
Center between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.
Current figures are unavailable, but last
spring about 2500 riders each day were
using the system. Peak hours are the early
morning and late afternoon, said Schmidt.
The service to the shopping center is also
very popular, he added.
The shuttlebus provides connections
with Santa Clara County bus lines at its
Escondido Village terminus, at the front of
the Quad, and at the shopping center.
