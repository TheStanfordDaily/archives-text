# Syrian-Christian violence continues to destroy Beirut
## 
### 
Beirut, Lebanon (AP) —
Syrian-Christian violence has
torn apart this capital city, and
some veterans of the Lebanese
conflict say the fighting now is
worse than any seen during the
worst of the 1975-76 civil war.
The conflict that has de
stroyed much of the Christian
sector of East Bei rut is now spil
ling over into the western en
tertainment and commercial
center, an area that in better
times earned Beirut the name
"Paris of the Middle East."
The Syrians, now the heart of
an Arab League peace-keeping
force stationed here, inter
vened in the civil war that pit
ted leftist Lebanese Moslems
and Palestinians against
right-wing Christians whom
the Moslems thought had too
much political control.
The Syrian move saved the
Christians, but they have now
proved stubbornly resistant to
Syrian attempts to control
them.
No power
The Christian quarter has
been without water and elec
tricity for a week. Tuesday, the
big guns constantly hammer
ing the city knocked out most
of west Beirut's power, plung
ing it into darkness and cutting
all communications with the
outside world.
The blackout proved a
nightmarish backdrop for the
battle waged in the air — fiery
tracer shells and whistling roc
kets from Syrian guns criss
crossed the night sky, landing
with white bursts of fire in the
eastern sector.
The orange glow of a blaze at
an oil depot, partially obscured
by thick smoke, put the eastern
skyline in a ghostly silhouette.
Radio reports
Radio reports from the
Christian sector, completely
cut off by Syrian roadblocks
and sniper fire from the Mos
lem quarter in the west, said
corpses were rotting in streets,
hospitals and homes, deprived
of burial because of the
danger.

Red Cross workers say the
threats of famine and death
from thirst are becoming more
serious by the hour as all
routes of supply to the eastern
sector have been severed. The
right-wing militia campaign to
wrest two strategic bridges
from the Syrians that lead into
east Beirutand out of thecityto
the north could be a push for
an escape route.
In West Beirut, leftist
Lebanese militamen who have
stayed out of this fight — some
say only because of considera
ble pressure from Syria — have
thrown up roadblocks in
neighborhoods they treat as
their own private strongholds.
Identity checks
Armed gunmen check iden
tities of passing drivers and, in
apparent frustration at being
left out of the fight, shoot fus
sillades of machinegun fire
into the night air.
An occasional rocket
propelled grenade swishes to
ward the eastern sector from
an apartment window, tes
timony to the old Beirut cliche
that every building is an ar
mory.
Scores of restaurants and
nightclubs in West Beirut that
reopened after the civil war in
hopes of eventual recovery
have shut their doors once
again.
'For sale'
Hans Maschek, an Austrian
restauranteur who spent
$290,000 refurbishing his war
gutted establishment, put a
"for sale" ad in the newspap
ers.
"This is sheer madness. I've
had it," Maschek said, adding
he is willing to take almost any
loss to sell and get his family
out.
The embattled Christian
quarter, which largely escaped
damage during the civil war,
has been dubbed "Stalingrad,"
a reference to the Russian city
held hostage by German
troops in World War II and al
most depopulated at the end of

the siege.
Streets in the area are im
passable because of the
chunks of concrete, shattered
glass and felled telephone
poles.
Correspondents
On a tour of the East during a
lull early this week, corres
pondents were shown dozens
of unexploded shells, some
weighing 250 pounds.
Officials in the eastern sec
tor believe more than two
thirds of the 600,000 Christians
here have fled to the moun
tains or the country. The re
mainder, mostly poorer resi
dents, have stayed behind to
support the militia or to protect
their property from looting.
"I think this is in some ways
worse than the civil war," said a
British diplomat who was here
during the 19-month conflict.
"These big guns weren't
operating then. It was mostly a
light-arms war."
Syrian guns
Experts say the heavy artil
lery, mortar and rocket bar
rages — mostly from Syrian
guns — are responsible for the
high civilian casualty toll.
More than 700 Lebanese, an
estimated 90 percent civilians,
have been killed in three ex
tended battles since the cur
rent conflict broke out last Feb
ruary. The 1975-76 civil war
took more than 37,000 lives,
many of them combatants, as it
raged through most of the
country.
Northern mountains
The current fighting, which
up to this week was localized in
the eastern sector of the capi
tal, is now being carried to the
northern mountains, the home
of the Maronite Christians who
make up much of the right
wing militia troops.
And veteran observers be
lieve the Syrians may soon
launch an offensive against
Jounieh, the unofficial Christ
ian capital 12 miles north of
Beirut, the only remaining
supply port for the militia.

ruary. The 1975-76 civil war
took more than 37,000 lives,
many of them combatants, as it
raged through most of the
country.
Northern mountains
The current fighting, which
up to this week was localized in
the eastern sector of the capi
tal, is now being carried to the
northern mountains, the home
of the Maronite Christians who
make up much of the right
wing militia troops.
And veteran observers be

launch an offensive against
Jounieh, the unofficial Christ
ian capital 12 miles north of
Beirut, the only remaining
supply port for the militia.
Beirut, Lebanon (AP) —
Syrian-Christian violence has
torn apart this capital city, and
some veterans of the Lebanese
conflict say the fighting now is
worse than any seen during the
worst of the 1975-76 civil war.
The conflict that has de
stroyed much of the Christian
sector of East Bei rut is now spil
ling over into the western en
tertainment and commercial
center, an area that in better
times earned Beirut the name
"Paris of the Middle East."
The Syrians, now the heart of
an Arab League peace-keeping
force stationed here, inter
vened in the civil war that pit
ted leftist Lebanese Moslems
and Palestinians against
right-wing Christians whom
the Moslems thought had too
much political control.
The Syrian move saved the
Christians, but they have now
proved stubbornly resistant to
Syrian attempts to control
them.
No power
The Christian quarter has
been without water and elec
tricity for a week. Tuesday, the
big guns constantly hammer
ing the city knocked out most
of west Beirut's power, plung
ing it into darkness and cutting
all communications with the
outside world.
The blackout proved a
nightmarish backdrop for the
battle waged in the air — fiery
tracer shells and whistling roc
kets from Syrian guns criss
crossed the night sky, landing
with white bursts of fire in the
eastern sector.
The orange glow of a blaze at
an oil depot, partially obscured
by thick smoke, put the eastern
skyline in a ghostly silhouette.
Radio reports
Radio reports from the
Christian sector, completely
cut off by Syrian roadblocks
and sniper fire from the Mos
lem quarter in the west, said
corpses were rotting in streets,
hospitals and homes, deprived
of burial because of the
danger.

Red Cross workers say the
threats of famine and death
from thirst are becoming more
serious by the hour as all
routes of supply to the eastern
sector have been severed. The
right-wing militia campaign to
wrest two strategic bridges
from the Syrians that lead into
east Beirutand out of thecityto
the north could be a push for
an escape route.
In West Beirut, leftist
Lebanese militamen who have
stayed out of this fight — some
say only because of considera
ble pressure from Syria — have
thrown up roadblocks in
neighborhoods they treat as
their own private strongholds.
Identity checks
Armed gunmen check iden
tities of passing drivers and, in
apparent frustration at being
left out of the fight, shoot fus
sillades of machinegun fire
into the night air.
An occasional rocket
propelled grenade swishes to
ward the eastern sector from
an apartment window, tes
timony to the old Beirut cliche
that every building is an ar
mory.
Scores of restaurants and
nightclubs in West Beirut that
reopened after the civil war in
hopes of eventual recovery
have shut their doors once
again.
'For sale'
Hans Maschek, an Austrian
restauranteur who spent
$290,000 refurbishing his war
gutted establishment, put a
"for sale" ad in the newspap
ers.
"This is sheer madness. I've
had it," Maschek said, adding
he is willing to take almost any
loss to sell and get his family
out.
The embattled Christian
quarter, which largely escaped
damage during the civil war,
has been dubbed "Stalingrad,"
a reference to the Russian city
held hostage by German
troops in World War II and al
most depopulated at the end of

the siege.
Streets in the area are im
passable because of the
chunks of concrete, shattered
glass and felled telephone
poles.
Correspondents
On a tour of the East during a
lull early this week, corres
pondents were shown dozens
of unexploded shells, some
weighing 250 pounds.
Officials in the eastern sec
tor believe more than two
thirds of the 600,000 Christians
here have fled to the moun
tains or the country. The re
mainder, mostly poorer resi
dents, have stayed behind to
support the militia or to protect
their property from looting.
"I think this is in some ways
worse than the civil war," said a
British diplomat who was here
during the 19-month conflict.
"These big guns weren't
operating then. It was mostly a
light-arms war."
Syrian guns
Experts say the heavy artil
lery, mortar and rocket bar
rages — mostly from Syrian
guns — are responsible for the
high civilian casualty toll.
More than 700 Lebanese, an
estimated 90 percent civilians,
have been killed in three ex

ruary. The 1975-76 civil war

mainder, mostly poorer resi
dents, have stayed behind to
support the militia or to protect
their property from looting.
"I think this is in some ways
worse than the civil war," said a
British diplomat who was here
during the 19-month conflict.
"These big guns weren't
operating then. It was mostly a
light-arms war."
Syrian guns
Experts say the heavy artil
lery, mortar and rocket bar
rages — mostly from Syrian
guns — are responsible for the
high civilian casualty toll.
More than 700 Lebanese, an
estimated 90 percent civilians,
have been killed in three ex
tended battles since the cur
rent conflict broke out last Feb
ruary. The 1975-76 civil war
took more than 37,000 lives,
many of them combatants, as it
raged through most of the
country.
Northern mountains
The current fighting, which
up to this week was localized in
the eastern sector of the capi
tal, is now being carried to the
northern mountains, the home
of the Maronite Christians who
make up much of the right
wing militia troops.
And veteran observers be
lieve the Syrians may soon
launch an offensive against
Jounieh, the unofficial Christ
ian capital 12 miles north of
Beirut, the only remaining
supply port for the militia.
Beirut, Lebanon (AP) —
Syrian-Christian violence has
torn apart this capital city, and
some veterans of the Lebanese
conflict say the fighting now is
worse than any seen during the
worst of the 1975-76 civil war.
The conflict that has de
stroyed much of the Christian
sector of East Bei rut is now spil
ling over into the western en
tertainment and commercial
center, an area that in better
times earned Beirut the name
"Paris of the Middle East."
The Syrians, now the heart of
an Arab League peace-keeping
force stationed here, inter
vened in the civil war that pit
ted leftist Lebanese Moslems
and Palestinians against
right-wing Christians whom
the Moslems thought had too
much political control.
The Syrian move saved the
Christians, but they have now
proved stubbornly resistant to
Syrian attempts to control
them.
No power
The Christian quarter has
been without water and elec
tricity for a week. Tuesday, the
big guns constantly hammer
ing the city knocked out most
of west Beirut's power, plung
ing it into darkness and cutting
all communications with the
outside world.
The blackout proved a
nightmarish backdrop for the
battle waged in the air — fiery
tracer shells and whistling roc
kets from Syrian guns criss
crossed the night sky, landing
with white bursts of fire in the
eastern sector.
The orange glow of a blaze at
an oil depot, partially obscured
by thick smoke, put the eastern
skyline in a ghostly silhouette.
Radio reports
Radio reports from the
Christian sector, completely
cut off by Syrian roadblocks
and sniper fire from the Mos
lem quarter in the west, said
corpses were rotting in streets,
hospitals and homes, deprived
of burial because of the
danger.

Red Cross workers say the
threats of famine and death
from thirst are becoming more
serious by the hour as all
routes of supply to the eastern
sector have been severed. The
right-wing militia campaign to
wrest two strategic bridges
from the Syrians that lead into
east Beirutand out of thecityto
the north could be a push for
an escape route.
In West Beirut, leftist
Lebanese militamen who have
stayed out of this fight — some
say only because of considera
ble pressure from Syria — have
thrown up roadblocks in
neighborhoods they treat as
their own private strongholds.
Identity checks
Armed gunmen check iden
tities of passing drivers and, in
apparent frustration at being
left out of the fight, shoot fus
sillades of machinegun fire
into the night air.
An occasional rocket
propelled grenade swishes to
ward the eastern sector from
an apartment window, tes
timony to the old Beirut cliche
that every building is an ar
mory.
Scores of restaurants and
nightclubs in West Beirut that
reopened after the civil war in
hopes of eventual recovery
have shut their doors once
again.
'For sale'
Hans Maschek, an Austrian
restauranteur who spent
$290,000 refurbishing his war
gutted establishment, put a
"for sale" ad in the newspap
ers.
"This is sheer madness. I've
had it," Maschek said, adding
he is willing to take almost any
loss to sell and get his family
out.
The embattled Christian
quarter, which largely escaped
damage during the civil war,
has been dubbed "Stalingrad,"
a reference to the Russian city
held hostage by German
troops in World War II and al
most depopulated at the end of

the siege.
Streets in the area are im
passable because of the
chunks of concrete, shattered
glass and felled telephone
poles.
Correspondents
On a tour of the East during a
lull early this week, corres
pondents were shown dozens
of unexploded shells, some
weighing 250 pounds.
Officials in the eastern sec
tor believe more than two
thirds of the 600,000 Christians
here have fled to the moun
tains or the country. The re
mainder, mostly poorer resi
dents, have stayed behind to
support the militia or to protect
their property from looting.
