# Operation SHARE tutor service aids slow learners, other students
## 
### KATHY SHEIL 
"Are you willing to Share . . . your
time, your efforts, yourself?"
This message has been posted re
cently around campus in an effort to
recruit new participants in Operation
SHARE.
The program is a student tutorial or
ganization with several aims; to pro
vide a service to the community, and to
give students here a chance to explore
opportunities in the practical and
theoretical sides of education.
Assignments range from "Big
Brother" helping-type activities to
more specific situations involving slow
learners, foreign students, special edu
cation students and other needs. Par
ticipants can work in the classroom or
on a one-to-one basis with pupils from
kindergarten through grade 12.
'Perennial SHARE student'
"In the past, we've been pretty much
able to fill everyone's needs," said Tim
Quey, one of the coordinators, who
describes himself as a "perennial
SHARE student."
"It's one of the most rewarding
things I've ever done," said one stu
dent, "I'm really enjoying it." Similar
sentiments were echoed by another,
who added that "everyone is really ap
preciative."
"There are not that many oppor

tunities for undergraduates to get ex
perience and learn about the different
fields of education," added SHARE
coordinator Debbie Lillo.
SHARE staff members emphasized
the need for students to participate in
the program, especially since the pas
sage of Proposition 13. Members said
schools are in great need of volunteers.
"The kids don't have enough individual
attention," one explained. "That can
make the difference."
Volunteer or credit work
Those interested in participating in
Operation SHARE have the option of
either working as volunteers or for cre
dit. The requirements for earning two
to three units of credit include spend
ing a minimum number of hours work
ing in the tutorial program, keeping a
journal of experiences, attending and
participating in meetings and seminars
and completing a final project.
Past participants have said they en
countered "no real problem" meeting
the required minimum hours because
they said they "fell in love with the
kids."
Quey said that this year there will be a
change in the concept of meetings with
the participants. Students will be or
ganized in small groups, based at a
school or arranged by special interest.
More emphasis will be placed on the

needs of the groups, using speakers
and practical seminars.
Encourage students
The idea is to encourage students to
discuss their projects, experiences and
reactions with others, Quey said. Also
being discussed are methods to solve
the problems of student evaluation.
Staff members hope that the new
methods will allow for the flexibility
and range of the assignments involved.
There are other obstacles for the Op
eration SHARE staff to overcome. As fa
culty adviser David Tyack said, "Volun
teer work is always a potential conflict."
Teachers have complained that stu
dents do not always carry out the work
they are supposed to do, and students
have argued that some teachers do not
let them do anything more than just "sit
around."
The Operation SHARE staff hopes to
be able to expand its range of activities
by working with other organizations
and programs, such as the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center (CPPC) and
the newly-reinstated Undergraduate
Program in the School of Education
(UPSE).
Students gaining experience in the
tutorial side of education through the
SHARE program also can explore other
aspects of the local schools through the
resources available from UPSE.

cation students and other needs. Par
ticipants can work in the classroom or
on a one-to-one basis with pupils from
kindergarten through grade 12.
'Perennial SHARE student'
"In the past, we've been pretty much
able to fill everyone's needs," said Tim
Quey, one of the coordinators, who
describes himself as a "perennial
SHARE student."
"It's one of the most rewarding
things I've ever done," said one stu
dent, "I'm really enjoying it." Similar
sentiments were echoed by another,
who added that "everyone is really ap
preciative."
"There are not that many oppor

tunities for undergraduates to get ex
perience and learn about the different
fields of education," added SHARE
coordinator Debbie Lillo.
SHARE staff members emphasized
the need for students to participate in
the program, especially since the pas
sage of Proposition 13. Members said
schools are in great need of volunteers.
"The kids don't have enough individual
attention," one explained. "That can
make the difference."
Volunteer or credit work
Those interested in participating in
Operation SHARE have the option of
either working as volunteers or for cre
dit. The requirements for earning two
to three units of credit include spend
ing a minimum number of hours work
ing in the tutorial program, keeping a
journal of experiences, attending and
participating in meetings and seminars
and completing a final project.
Past participants have said they en
countered "no real problem" meeting
the required minimum hours because
they said they "fell in love with the
kids."
Quey said that this year there will be a
change in the concept of meetings with
the participants. Students will be or
ganized in small groups, based at a
school or arranged by special interest.
More emphasis will be placed on the

needs of the groups, using speakers
and practical seminars.
Encourage students
The idea is to encourage students to
discuss their projects, experiences and
reactions with others, Quey said. Also
being discussed are methods to solve
the problems of student evaluation.
Staff members hope that the new
methods will allow for the flexibility
and range of the assignments involved.
There are other obstacles for the Op
eration SHARE staff to overcome. As fa
culty adviser David Tyack said, "Volun
teer work is always a potential conflict."
Teachers have complained that stu
dents do not always carry out the work
they are supposed to do, and students
have argued that some teachers do not
let them do anything more than just "sit
around."
The Operation SHARE staff hopes to
be able to expand its range of activities
by working with other organizations
and programs, such as the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center (CPPC) and
the newly-reinstated Undergraduate
Program in the School of Education
(UPSE).
Students gaining experience in the
tutorial side of education through the
SHARE program also can explore other
aspects of the local schools through the
resources available from UPSE.
"Are you willing to Share . . . your
time, your efforts, yourself?"
This message has been posted re
cently around campus in an effort to
recruit new participants in Operation
SHARE.
The program is a student tutorial or
ganization with several aims; to pro
vide a service to the community, and to
give students here a chance to explore
opportunities in the practical and
theoretical sides of education.
Assignments range from "Big
Brother" helping-type activities to
more specific situations involving slow
learners, foreign students, special edu
cation students and other needs. Par
ticipants can work in the classroom or
on a one-to-one basis with pupils from
kindergarten through grade 12.
