Circle K is the college divi
sion of the Kiwanis club. The
group is dedicated to helping
underprivileged people, work
ing both in surrounding com
munities and on campus. Ac
cording to the president of the
Circle K chapter here, Kathy
McCarthy, the group enjoys
"serving others, but even more
so, we enjoy being together

and serving others."
The Circle K chapter was
started last year by a transfer
student who felt the need for
such a service group. Since
then, members have con
ducted a hypertension screen
ing on campus, operated a
health food booth at the Spring
Crafts Fair, and taken part in a
Kiwanis-sponsored "Kleen-up
Day" in Palo Alto.
Plans for this quarter include
another hypertension screen
ing, an "old sweater drive" for
garments to send to develop
ing nations, and a trick-or-treat
expedition in which they will
lead disadvantaged children
through the dorms on Hallo
ween. The club is also taking

part in an international Circle K
club project under the slogan
"Embrace Humanity."
Members have already
raised more than $70 this quar
ter taking tickets at the football
games. The funds they raise
will be used to finance their
service projects, which are
aimed at the economically un
derprivileged, the elderly and
the handicapped.
Also this quarter, Circle K
has initiated a membership
drive, which included new
member sign-ups at Maples
Pavilion during registration.
Circle K holds weekly meetings
on Thursday nights at 6:30 p.m.
in Tresidder Union.
