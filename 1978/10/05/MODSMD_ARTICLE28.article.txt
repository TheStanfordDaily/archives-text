# Offering more than remedial instruction
## Frosh English encourages creativity 
### ELLIOT KLEIN 
Lately, no one is surprised to hear that college
students can't write. It's been on the cover of every
major newsweekly — students write nonsense, and
don't even know how to spell right.
The truth here is something less horrendous, but
more complex. Time and Newsweek don't mention
the large number of freshmen who write well. But the
fact remains, four-fifths of Stanford's entering class
take two quarters of intensive writing practice known
as freshman English, and most students look forward
to the improvement they expect from it.
For many people, the mention of freshman English
suggests a remedial class, or, worse still, the old
"bonehead" English of diagrammed sentences. But
the Stanford program is different. It allows students a
choice regarding course format. Also, instructors
work individually with students on specific writing
difficulties.
Two types
Nancy Packer, the writer and teacher who directs
freshman English, identified two types of problems
confronting student writers.
"First, there's the student who is paralyzed. He's so
eager to do well that he can't do anything well, be
cause he censors himself so much. He can't find a
place in his writing where intellect and emotion come
together."
In contrast, there's the writer who is "too loose,"
she said. This is the student "who thinks that anything
at all that comes into his head is fine to put on paper,"
Packer said. This person usually has no conception of
argument or organization.
"Freshman English has to be able to handle both
types of problems. My goal is to have each instructor
ready to recognize not merely the problems that
occur on the page, but also the problems that lie
behind, with the person himself. Our staff has to be
flexible enough to help every student confront his

problem."
Freshman English emphasizes two basic proce
dures for good writing. One procedure encourages
the tight student to explore free writing and other
techniques to generate ideas. Use of critical thinking
encourages the looser student to "tighten" his writ
ing, Packer said.
"In trying to tighten up the loose student, we run
the risk of also tightening up students who need the
opposite approach — and visa-versa. Our staff has
got to be flexible and alert. Every faculty member
must be aware of the needs of every student. I think
we have a superlative staff."
Barring only scheduling conflicts, a student is free
to select any writing course that suits him.
"Our philosophy," said Packer, "is that students
should take courses that interest them, because we
believe that students learn best when they're writing
about and being criticized in something they care
about. The first obstacle to good writing is caring."
Format
To translate philosophy into practice, the
Freshman English Program offers three basic course
formats. Its writing workshops center around class
meetings, and focus on discussion of the elements of
good writing. Its thematic writing workshops follow
the same format, but explore a special topic, reflect
ing a particular interest of the instructor. Science
fiction, ecology and popular culture are topics re
cently incorporated into workshops. More
specialized in format are the small group tutorials.
Student and instructor meet for regular conferences
devoted to analyzing the student's written work.
Students who have special problems that can't be
handled in class, may visit the drop-in tutorial center.
Personalized help from faculty is available there.
Many freshmen favor a no-nonsense approach to
writing.
"Our most popular courses for fall were 'Science

Fiction, Basic Writing,' 'How Works Persuade,' and
'Why Do You Think That Way?' " Packer said. "In
other words, three of the courses that look to be the
most basic are also the most popular. Evidently, a lot
of students recognize that they need to write better."
Refined approach
Like any successful program, freshman English gets
better by refining its approach. This year, use of a
standard syllabus by instructors was encouraged by
Packer.
Students learn to arrange ideas, then move on to
finer style discussions. While there is no party line on
the "correct" approach to teaching composition, the
syllabus assures that everyone in the Program moves
in basically the same direction at the same time,
Packer said.
Moved in part by concern about falling standards of
literacy, the English department and administration
here have recently agreed to reinforce a training
program for teaching fellows and assistants. Faculty
members in the English department now take sec
tions of freshman English as part of their teaching
load — a situation unusual at many other schools.
Just how important is the freshman English prog
ram at Stanford? "We're the most important thing at
the University, without a doubt," Packer said. "Every
person is going to have to write some time. You can
know everything in the book, but without good writ
ing skills, it's all useless."
But Packer notes the need for a wider commitment
to good writing at Stanford. "Our obstacle in
freshman English is that we're expected to make
every student achieve good writing skills once and for
all, in just two quarters. But no one can do this job
once and for all. In fact, it's the responsibility of every
instructor at this University to improve basic writing
skills. Some faculty in other areas do care, but there
are not enough who do. At the freshman English
program, we can lay a foundation, but we can't do the
job alone."


Students may consult faculty for assistance and counseling on specific writing prob
lems at the drop-in tutorial center, located in Building 50.


The workshop format allows students to interact with the instructor and with each
other in group discussions.

members in the English department now take sec
tions of freshman English as part of their teaching
load — a situation unusual at many other schools.
Just how important is the freshman English prog
ram at Stanford? "We're the most important thing at
the University, without a doubt," Packer said. "Every
person is going to have to write some time. You can
know everything in the book, but without good writ
ing skills, it's all useless."
But Packer notes the need for a wider commitment
to good writing at Stanford. "Our obstacle in
freshman English is that we're expected to make
every student achieve good writing skills once and for
all, in just two quarters. But no one can do this job
once and for all. In fact, it's the responsibility of every
instructor at this University to improve basic writing
skills. Some faculty in other areas do care, but there
are not enough who do. At the freshman English
program, we can lay a foundation, but we can't do the
job alone."


Students may consult faculty for assistance and counseling on specific writing prob
lems at the drop-in tutorial center, located in Building 50.


The workshop format allows students to interact with the instructor and with each
other in group discussions.

program. Nancy Packer (bottom), chairman of the freshman English
program says,"The first obstacle to teaching is caring."

Lately, no one is surprised to hear that college
students can't write. It's been on the cover of every
major newsweekly — students write nonsense, and
don't even know how to spell right.
The truth here is something less horrendous, but
more complex. Time and Newsweek don't mention
the large number of freshmen who write well. But the
fact remains, four-fifths of Stanford's entering class
take two quarters of intensive writing practice known
as freshman English, and most students look forward
to the improvement they expect from it.
For many people, the mention of freshman English
suggests a remedial class, or, worse still, the old
"bonehead" English of diagrammed sentences. But
the Stanford program is different. It allows students a
choice regarding course format. Also, instructors
work individually with students on specific writing
difficulties.
Two types
Nancy Packer, the writer and teacher who directs
freshman English, identified two types of problems
confronting student writers.
"First, there's the student who is paralyzed. He's so
eager to do well that he can't do anything well, be
cause he censors himself so much. He can't find a
place in his writing where intellect and emotion come
together."
In contrast, there's the writer who is "too loose,"
she said. This is the student "who thinks that anything
at all that comes into his head is fine to put on paper,"
Packer said. This person usually has no conception of
argument or organization.
"Freshman English has to be able to handle both
types of problems. My goal is to have each instructor
ready to recognize not merely the problems that
occur on the page, but also the problems that lie
behind, with the person himself. Our staff has to be
flexible enough to help every student confront his

problem."
Freshman English emphasizes two basic proce
dures for good writing. One procedure encourages
the tight student to explore free writing and other
techniques to generate ideas. Use of critical thinking
encourages the looser student to "tighten" his writ
ing, Packer said.
"In trying to tighten up the loose student, we run
the risk of also tightening up students who need the
opposite approach — and visa-versa. Our staff has
got to be flexible and alert. Every faculty member
must be aware of the needs of every student. I think
we have a superlative staff."
Barring only scheduling conflicts, a student is free
to select any writing course that suits him.
"Our philosophy," said Packer, "is that students
should take courses that interest them, because we
believe that students learn best when they're writing
about and being criticized in something they care
about. The first obstacle to good writing is caring."
Format
To translate philosophy into practice, the
Freshman English Program offers three basic course
formats. Its writing workshops center around class
meetings, and focus on discussion of the elements of
good writing. Its thematic writing workshops follow
the same format, but explore a special topic, reflect
ing a particular interest of the instructor. Science
fiction, ecology and popular culture are topics re
cently incorporated into workshops. More
specialized in format are the small group tutorials.
Student and instructor meet for regular conferences
devoted to analyzing the student's written work.
Students who have special problems that can't be
handled in class, may visit the drop-in tutorial center.
Personalized help from faculty is available there.
Many freshmen favor a no-nonsense approach to
writing.
"Our most popular courses for fall were 'Science

Fiction, Basic Writing,' 'How Works Persuade,' and
'Why Do You Think That Way?' " Packer said. "In
other words, three of the courses that look to be the
most basic are also the most popular. Evidently, a lot
of students recognize that they need to write better."
Refined approach
Like any successful program, freshman English gets
better by refining its approach. This year, use of a
standard syllabus by instructors was encouraged by
Packer.
Students learn to arrange ideas, then move on to
finer style discussions. While there is no party line on
the "correct" approach to teaching composition, the
syllabus assures that everyone in the Program moves
in basically the same direction at the same time,
Packer said.

literacy, the English department and administration
here have recently agreed to reinforce a training

"Our most popular courses for fall were 'Science

Fiction, Basic Writing,' 'How Works Persuade,' and
'Why Do You Think That Way?' " Packer said. "In
other words, three of the courses that look to be the
most basic are also the most popular. Evidently, a lot
of students recognize that they need to write better."
Refined approach
Like any successful program, freshman English gets
better by refining its approach. This year, use of a
standard syllabus by instructors was encouraged by
Packer.
Students learn to arrange ideas, then move on to
finer style discussions. While there is no party line on
the "correct" approach to teaching composition, the
syllabus assures that everyone in the Program moves
in basically the same direction at the same time,
Packer said.
Moved in part by concern about falling standards of
literacy, the English department and administration
here have recently agreed to reinforce a training
program for teaching fellows and assistants. Faculty
members in the English department now take sec
tions of freshman English as part of their teaching
load — a situation unusual at many other schools.
Just how important is the freshman English prog
ram at Stanford? "We're the most important thing at
the University, without a doubt," Packer said. "Every
person is going to have to write some time. You can
know everything in the book, but without good writ
ing skills, it's all useless."
But Packer notes the need for a wider commitment
to good writing at Stanford. "Our obstacle in
freshman English is that we're expected to make
every student achieve good writing skills once and for
all, in just two quarters. But no one can do this job
once and for all. In fact, it's the responsibility of every
instructor at this University to improve basic writing
skills. Some faculty in other areas do care, but there
are not enough who do. At the freshman English
program, we can lay a foundation, but we can't do the
job alone."

lems at the drop-in tutorial center, located in Building 50.

Lately, no one is surprised to hear that college
students can't write. It's been on the cover of every
major newsweekly — students write nonsense, and
don't even know how to spell right.
The truth here is something less horrendous, but
more complex. Time and Newsweek don't mention
the large number of freshmen who write well. But the
fact remains, four-fifths of Stanford's entering class
take two quarters of intensive writing practice known
as freshman English, and most students look forward
to the improvement they expect from it.
For many people, the mention of freshman English
suggests a remedial class, or, worse still, the old
"bonehead" English of diagrammed sentences. But
the Stanford program is different. It allows students a
choice regarding course format. Also, instructors
work individually with students on specific writing
difficulties.
Two types
Nancy Packer, the writer and teacher who directs
freshman English, identified two types of problems
confronting student writers.
"First, there's the student who is paralyzed. He's so
eager to do well that he can't do anything well, be
cause he censors himself so much. He can't find a
place in his writing where intellect and emotion come
together."
In contrast, there's the writer who is "too loose,"
she said. This is the student "who thinks that anything
at all that comes into his head is fine to put on paper,"
Packer said. This person usually has no conception of
argument or organization.
"Freshman English has to be able to handle both
types of problems. My goal is to have each instructor
ready to recognize not merely the problems that
occur on the page, but also the problems that lie
behind, with the person himself. Our staff has to be
flexible enough to help every student confront his

problem."
Freshman English emphasizes two basic proce
dures for good writing. One procedure encourages
the tight student to explore free writing and other
techniques to generate ideas. Use of critical thinking
encourages the looser student to "tighten" his writ
ing, Packer said.
"In trying to tighten up the loose student, we run
the risk of also tightening up students who need the
opposite approach — and visa-versa. Our staff has
got to be flexible and alert. Every faculty member
must be aware of the needs of every student. I think
we have a superlative staff."
Barring only scheduling conflicts, a student is free
to select any writing course that suits him.
"Our philosophy," said Packer, "is that students
should take courses that interest them, because we
believe that students learn best when they're writing
about and being criticized in something they care
about. The first obstacle to good writing is caring."
Format
To translate philosophy into practice, the
Freshman English Program offers three basic course
formats. Its writing workshops center around class
meetings, and focus on discussion of the elements of
good writing. Its thematic writing workshops follow
the same format, but explore a special topic, reflect
ing a particular interest of the instructor. Science
fiction, ecology and popular culture are topics re
cently incorporated into workshops. More
specialized in format are the small group tutorials.
Student and instructor meet for regular conferences
devoted to analyzing the student's written work.
