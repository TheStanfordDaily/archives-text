## movies/ron lillejord Altman's 'Wea[illegible]g': lazy 
### 
In movies, as in any other
form of art, one can sens
when the director simply isn't
getting all that he can out ot
himself, and your fru Station at
this often overwhelms nil your
other impressions ah ut the
film. Sometimes, directors
don't have the courage to go all
the way with a movie; other
times, a director has both the
courage and the skill, but for
some reason, he just won't
make the necessary effort.
A Wedding appears to be an
example of the latter case,
since the movie's writer
director is Robert Altman.
Altman has challenged himself
in the past and has gotten
something original and evoca
tive as a result (M'A*S*H*,
McCabe and Mrs. Miller,
Nashville), but in A Wedding,
he's just plain lazy and it
shows.
In effect a sketch upon
which the required improve
ments were never made, the

movie covers a day's events at a
mammoth wedding, from the
ceremony to the honeymoon
departure.
Distinctions pointless
As the film's day progresses,
Altman tries to set up clear dis
tinctions between myriad
characters, in order to give the
actors something to play
against, I suppose. Yet Altman
really doen't do anything with
these distinctions. For exam
ple, the groom's family, with
their established wealth and

bought culture is contrasted
with the bride's family, who are
uncomtortable with their re
cently acquired wealth. The
movie plays off this contrast for
comedy, but we don't see any
thing very new in it — Altman
doesn't begin to explore it.
Altman is equally lazy with
his characterization. Typically,
he utilizes sharply written
characters to provide a mosiac
type look at his subject, a
technique which exploded
into something very great in
Nashville. But here, Altman's
bare event-subject cannot sus
tain the Nashville-inspired
mass casting of familiar faces,
and the writing is not strong
enough to give the characters
life.
Too thin
We are left with a movie
which spreads itself too thin;
we see nicely comic sketches
of various groupings of charac
ters — but that's all they are,
just sketches, glimpses.

These glimpses often pro
vide good moments, to be
sure. The opening wedding
sequence is handled with gen
tle Altman irreverance, and its
comedy is based so solidly in
truth that the scene comes very
close to documentary.
Also, to see Lillian Cish (who
plays the dying head of the
groom's family) in a movie after
more than a decade away, and
looking so radiant, is a special
joy.
But these moments are iso

lat< ' We are just not sucked
into * Wedding like we were
into, say, M'A'S'H, becuase
there is not much that is arrest
ing here.
Carol Burnett
Except for Carol Burnett.
Altman's improvisational
methods make his actors' jobs
even more demanding, but
perhaps Burnett's experience
in television, where many of
her sketches had to be worked
out in improvisation, gave her
the training necessary to work
for Altman. As Tulip, the
mother of the bride, Burnett is
the best thing in A Wedding —
she dominates the movie, in
fact. As a woman who is ach
ingly weary of being neglected,
Burnett gives a touching,
comic, and completely be
lieveable performance.
As long as we can keep tak
ing things like Carol Burnett's
performance in this movie out
of Bob Altman films, it be
comes almost possible to
overlook the almost haphazard
effort with which he has ap
proached his films since
Nashville. Since then, Altman
has been working often, but
not hard, or at least not hard
enough. Because if Altman is
not going to go all the way,
maybe we shouldn't go at all.
