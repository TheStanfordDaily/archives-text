# Temporary policy
## Med School reacts to Bakke 
### DEBORAH FRANKLIN 
The new, temporary Medical
School admissions program here has
just begun processing applications
for next year's entering class, but
some faculty and students con
cerned with maintaining a substan
tial minority enrollment already are
worried about results.
The 1978-79 temporary admissions
policy was created as an emergency
response to the Bakke ruling, accord
ing to Med School Faculty Senate
chairman Irving Weissman, and will
be reassessed next year.
Commitment to minority admis
sion has not yet been a problem
here, according to lose Arevalo,
third-year medical student and a
member of the Med School Senate
Committee on Admission Policy
(SCAP).
But the obstacle for minority
applicants now, he said, lies in the
U.S. Supreme Court's Bakke deci
sion which banned strict racial
quotas in university admissions,
while upholding affirmative action
programs. As a result, many schools
were left uncertain about the legality
of their admissions policies.
"The change had to come because
we wanted to make sure we were
within legal bounds," Arevalo said,
referring to the new admission pol
icy.
How the former policy could be

changed without damaging what the
senate terms a successful admissions
system was the much-debated sub
ject of several committee reports last
summer and dominated the final
five-hour decision-making meeting
of the Med School Faculty Senate
Monday night.
After the new policy adopted by
the senate eliminated the Minority
Admissions Committee — which
formerly processed minority admis
sions, senate members had to de
termine new ways to maintain pre
sent minority admissions as well as to
ensure minority input in admissions
decisions.
Debated parts of the new policy
include adding two minority seats to
the Central Admissions Committee,
requiring multiple folder reviews for
all applicants and developing a
weighting system by which applic
ants would receive points for minor
ity status, as well as for academic
achievement and physicianly qual
ities.
More reviews
The additional folder reviews
worry Weissman, although Arevalo
said he thinks the new system will
"give everybody a chance."
The past policy has been to offer
two folder reviews by admissions
staff only to the top third of the
applicant pool, while the lower two
thirds each received one review,

based upon a computer sorting
which combined Medical College
Admissions Test scores with under
graduate grade point averages.
"There's a kind of stigma to being
put into the lower group," Arevalo
said, "and this system should take
care of that."
Heavier workload
Weissman, however, said he fears
that two reviews for each of the 5500
annual applicants will greatly in
crease the workload for each panel
member, possibly resulting in less
thorough reviews and less en
thusiasm by faculty members who
are needed, since committee mem
bers have limited amounts of time to
devote to admissions.
Establishing minority faculty input
is a special problem for Med School
Dean Dr. Clayton Rich, who appoints
the Admissions Committee mem
bers. The two appointees must be
minority members, according to the
new policy, bringing the total faculty
membership to 12 to 14, plus three
students.
Stanford essentially has no full
time minority faculty members, ac
cording to Weissman, who said he
believes the two new appointments
to the committee will come either
from community doctors who lec
ture here, or from other University
departments outside the Med
School.

How the former policy could be

changed without damaging what the
senate terms a successful admissions
system was the much-debated sub
ject of several committee reports last
summer and dominated the final
five-hour decision-making meeting
of the Med School Faculty Senate
Monday night.
After the new policy adopted by
the senate eliminated the Minority
Admissions Committee — which
formerly processed minority admis
sions, senate members had to de
termine new ways to maintain pre
sent minority admissions as well as to
ensure minority input in admissions
decisions.
Debated parts of the new policy
include adding two minority seats to
the Central Admissions Committee,
requiring multiple folder reviews for
all applicants and developing a
weighting system by which applic
ants would receive points for minor
ity status, as well as for academic
achievement and physicianly qual
ities.
More reviews
The additional folder reviews
worry Weissman, although Arevalo
said he thinks the new system will
"give everybody a chance."
The past policy has been to offer
two folder reviews by admissions
staff only to the top third of the
applicant pool, while the lower two
thirds each received one review,

based upon a computer sorting
which combined Medical College
Admissions Test scores with under
graduate grade point averages.
"There's a kind of stigma to being
put into the lower group," Arevalo
said, "and this system should take
care of that."
Heavier workload
Weissman, however, said he fears
that two reviews for each of the 5500
annual applicants will greatly in
crease the workload for each panel
member, possibly resulting in less
thorough reviews and less en
thusiasm by faculty members who
are needed, since committee mem
bers have limited amounts of time to
devote to admissions.
Establishing minority faculty input
is a special problem for Med School
Dean Dr. Clayton Rich, who appoints
the Admissions Committee mem
bers. The two appointees must be
minority members, according to the
new policy, bringing the total faculty
membership to 12 to 14, plus three
students.
Stanford essentially has no full
time minority faculty members, ac
cording to Weissman, who said he
believes the two new appointments
to the committee will come either
from community doctors who lec
ture here, or from other University
departments outside the Med
School.
The new, temporary Medical
School admissions program here has
just begun processing applications
for next year's entering class, but
some faculty and students con
cerned with maintaining a substan
tial minority enrollment already are
worried about results.
The 1978-79 temporary admissions
policy was created as an emergency
response to the Bakke ruling, accord
ing to Med School Faculty Senate
chairman Irving Weissman, and will
be reassessed next year.
Commitment to minority admis
sion has not yet been a problem
here, according to lose Arevalo,
third-year medical student and a
member of the Med School Senate
Committee on Admission Policy
(SCAP).
But the obstacle for minority
applicants now, he said, lies in the
U.S. Supreme Court's Bakke deci
sion which banned strict racial
quotas in university admissions,
while upholding affirmative action
programs. As a result, many schools
were left uncertain about the legality
of their admissions policies.
"The change had to come because
we wanted to make sure we were
within legal bounds," Arevalo said,
referring to the new admission pol
icy.
