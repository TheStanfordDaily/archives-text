## Sri Chinmoy concert at Mem Chu 
### 
The renowned Indian mystic
and musician Sri Chinmoy will
present a concert of Indian
esraj music at Stanford's
Memorial Chapel tonight at
'8:30 p.m. Admission is free.
Chinmoy is director of the
United Nations Meditation
Croup and a well-known au
thor, lecturer, artist and poet
— as well as being a master of
the classical Indian esraj. This
Bengali instrument is derived
from the North Indian saranghi
and produces a lovely, haunt
ing melody by means of a bow
and numerous sympathetic
strings.
Chinmoy's concerts are un
usual in that they combine a

spiritual, esoteric music with
silent meditation into a single
experience — a meditation in
sound. "I am not the musi
cian," says Chinmoy. "lam just
an instrument. I am like a
piano, violin or guitar. It is Cod
who is constantly playing on
me, in me, and through me.
God is the supreme musician."
A native of Bengal, birth
place of many famous contem
porary musicians such as
Rabindranath Tagore, Chin
moy has lived in the United
States for the past 15 years. He
is often known as "the musi
cians' Guru" since his students
include a large contingent of
professional musicians, such
as rock star Carlos Santana.

Cinmoy's Stanford perfor
mance will end his fall concert
series which has taken him to
16 of California's major univer
sities. The event is sponsored
by The Bridge.
Recognizing that Chinmoy
has performed such concerts
at universities and concert
halls throughout North
America and Europe, including
Carnegie Hall and Lincoln
Center in New York, the Stan
ford music department will be
making a presentation to him.
Chinmoy's peace-filled music
has been recorded on several
albums, the latest being Fol
ways Records' "Music for
Meditation."

In addition to his musical
compositions of nearly 3,000
songs, Chinmoy has written
360 books about meditation,
spirituality and music. He is
also a prolific artist, having
painted 100,000 paintings in 11
months. Displays of his art are
being exhibited this week in
Tresidder Union.
"I try to offer my dedicated
service to the aspiring human
ity," Chinmoy explains about
his seemingly endless creativ
ity. He says he creates in order
to inspire others and show
what a human being is capable
of when he invokes God, one's
highest consciousness, to
work in and through him or
her.
