## French film survives cuteness to make point 
### 
Porquois Pas (Why Not) asks
the cinematic question "Why
shouldn't three people live and
sleep together as well as two?"
and asks it with an unusually
frank and eloquent angle. The
film, written and directed by
Coline Serreau depicts a very
emotional and reasonably
physical menage-a-trois bet
ween two young French men
and one woman, who live to
gether in a Parisian suburb.
Surprisingly, it conscienti
ously refuses to be self
righteous about these avant
garde ideas, to be juvenile or
melodramatic about its rebel
lious stance. While exploding
sexual stereotypes Porquois
Pas soars way above the super
ficial gloss of the Unmarried
Woman genre of contempor
ary change-of-life movies.
Some serious artistic flaws im
pede the film's momentum
and lower its overall value, but
Serreau deserves praise for an
entertaining and intelligent
movie about youth, sex and
idealism, applicable to France
or America.
Sharing
We meet the three lovers,
Alex (the girl), Fernand and
Louis barely subsisting through
shared pleasures and
neuroses. Fernand, the eldest,
loves to cook, clean, and even
decorate the rooms of the
Alex makes the money
for all three, apparently by
reading the same book over
and over to a senile old wo
man. Louis, a big-eyed, boyish
schizophrenic, plays jazz piano
and electric guitar for most of
his day.
A big change comes into this
idyll when Fernand leaves to
seek out his new love, Sylvie.
He brings her back to the
house, but cannot bear to tell
her of the true nature of these
three musketeers' relation
ship.
She discovers Fernand in
bed with his lovers, and after
some anguish, she decides to
accept them with their limita
tions (which are many) and the
advantages they offer.
Non-conformity
The film offers an interest
ing, if occasionally awkward,

blend of characteristic French
slapstick and serious character
study. The trio, at their best,
rarely slip into contemporary
hip cliches, though Fernand's
Chaplin-esque walk and ob
session with death smack of
Harold and Maude and worse.
One sees some of the genuine
pain and emotion, the loneli
ness which comes with pro
found non-conformity, how
ever.
Unfortunately Porquois Pas
succumbs to some sloppy con
cepts in character and theme.
Not only the three kids, but
their lovable police chief
friend, Sylvieand herenergetic
mother fall prey to puppy-dog,
big brown-eyed cuteness and
adorable dialogue. (Alex
screams to Fernand upon view
ing his newly decorated "nur
sery" which looks like a burial
vault — "It's a two-berth cof
fin!")
Too many yelling arguments
turn abruptly, cutely, into
charming love scenes. The
big-eyed, soft-voiced young
man obsessed with death is not
a dislikable cliche, but when
Fernand becomes too superfi
cial the movie suffers. Alex,
Fernand and Louis, at their
worst, spend too much time
looking about with long faces
and misty eyes, a heart-tugging
litter of cuties who lack indi
viduality and do remind one of
the three musketeers, young
and lost in space.
'Real world'
Serreau attempts to under
score the difference between
the kids and "real world" by
making much of the adult
world look bizarrely insane,
and this hurts her point. She
beautifully photographs a
scene in which Louis' mad
father pours a pitcher of milk
over his own head (he is in an
guish over Louis' mother, who
is hospitalized as catatonic) but
one tends to feel like one is
paying an unnecessary visit to
the looney bin.
The lonely police chief falls
in love, of course, with the
lonely mother, because she
compassionately tells him that
he does not have an "egg-face"
as his cruel former wife said. It

becomes overpowering.
Somehow director Serreau
pulls a touching tale out of this
uneven montage. She has an
excellent eye Tor the human
face and the small glimpses of
emotion which it can reveal. It
is a briskly-paced movie with a
straightforward story, though
Serreau's tone and mood
swings too severely from ab
surd and exaggerated comedy
to quietly poignant narration.
Many of her scenes of con
temporary Parisian society are
silly and burlesque. (Police
chief comes to pick up Fernand
to play ping-pong in the Police
van. The table is inside, "bor
rowed" from the station for
the afternoon.) But she has a
way of making many of them
delightful and surprising.
Serreau also oversees some
excellent cinematography.

Porquois Pas pleases through
unobtrusive but active camera
work,; beautiful, slightly
greyed colours, and some very
warm sunlight sprinkled
suggestively throughout. She
photographs the very limited
sexual scenes between the
ihree with taste and a percep
tive grasp of the emotions in
volved.
Frey as Fernand
Sami Frey as Fernand has the
largest role and manages to
keep himself likable and cohe
rent in the midst of Serrau's
uneven direction. His sombre
Fernand is supported by Chris
tine Murillo as a pleasingly
fierce and rebellious Alex, and
Mario Gonzalez as a slightly
underplayed Louis. Unfortu
nately for Mario, Louis must go
through some very difficult
and hysterical Freudian sei

zures, and Louis has little
character written for him out
side of these fits to fall back
upon.
Generally the cast succeeds
in keeping Porquois Pas from
resembling too much a remake
of another tale of youth in re
bellion, The Monkees.
The rebellion depicted in
Porquois Pas is serious and
worth taking notice of. After a
see-sawing job through much
of the film, the director crystal
lizes her vision at the finish to
convince one of the trio's real
ity and depth. They seem, now
as a quartet, on the way to suc
cess, or rather at least as far
along the way as those of us on
this side of menage-a-trois.

Sharing
We meet the three lovers,
Alex (the girl), Fernand and
Louis barely subsisting through
shared pleasures and
neuroses. Fernand, the eldest,
loves to cook, clean, and even
decorate the rooms of the
Alex makes the money
for all three, apparently by
reading the same book over
and over to a senile old wo
man. Louis, a big-eyed, boyish
schizophrenic, plays jazz piano
and electric guitar for most of
his day.
A big change comes into this
idyll when Fernand leaves to
seek out his new love, Sylvie.
He brings her back to the
house, but cannot bear to tell
her of the true nature of these
three musketeers' relation
ship.
She discovers Fernand in
bed with his lovers, and after
some anguish, she decides to
accept them with their limita
tions (which are many) and the
advantages they offer.
Non-conformity
The film offers an interest
ing, if occasionally awkward,

blend of characteristic French
slapstick and serious character
study. The trio, at their best,
rarely slip into contemporary
hip cliches, though Fernand's
Chaplin-esque walk and ob
session with death smack of
Harold and Maude and worse.
One sees some of the genuine
pain and emotion, the loneli
ness which comes with pro
found non-conformity, how
ever.
Unfortunately Porquois Pas
succumbs to some sloppy con
cepts in character and theme.
Not only the three kids, but
their lovable police chief
friend, Sylvieand herenergetic
mother fall prey to puppy-dog,
big brown-eyed cuteness and
adorable dialogue. (Alex
screams to Fernand upon view
ing his newly decorated "nur
sery" which looks like a burial
vault — "It's a two-berth cof
fin!")
Too many yelling arguments
turn abruptly, cutely, into
charming love scenes. The
big-eyed, soft-voiced young
man obsessed with death is not
a dislikable cliche, but when
Fernand becomes too superfi
cial the movie suffers. Alex,
Fernand and Louis, at their
worst, spend too much time
looking about with long faces
and misty eyes, a heart-tugging
litter of cuties who lack indi
viduality and do remind one of
the three musketeers, young
and lost in space.
'Real world'
Serreau attempts to under
score the difference between
the kids and "real world" by
making much of the adult
world look bizarrely insane,
and this hurts her point. She
beautifully photographs a
scene in which Louis' mad
father pours a pitcher of milk
over his own head (he is in an
guish over Louis' mother, who
is hospitalized as catatonic) but
one tends to feel like one is
paying an unnecessary visit to
the looney bin.
The lonely police chief falls
in love, of course, with the
lonely mother, because she
compassionately tells him that
he does not have an "egg-face"
as his cruel former wife said. It

becomes overpowering.
Somehow director Serreau
pulls a touching tale out of this
uneven montage. She has an
excellent eye Tor the human
face and the small glimpses of
emotion which it can reveal. It
is a briskly-paced movie with a
straightforward story, though
Serreau's tone and mood
swings too severely from ab
surd and exaggerated comedy
to quietly poignant narration.
Many of her scenes of con
temporary Parisian society are
silly and burlesque. (Police
chief comes to pick up Fernand
to play ping-pong in the Police
van. The table is inside, "bor
rowed" from the station for
the afternoon.) But she has a
way of making many of them
delightful and surprising.
Serreau also oversees some
excellent cinematography.

Porquois Pas pleases through
unobtrusive but active camera
work,; beautiful, slightly
greyed colours, and some very
warm sunlight sprinkled
suggestively throughout. She
photographs the very limited
sexual scenes between the
ihree with taste and a percep
tive grasp of the emotions in
volved.
Frey as Fernand
Sami Frey as Fernand has the
largest role and manages to
keep himself likable and cohe
rent in the midst of Serrau's
uneven direction. His sombre
Fernand is supported by Chris
tine Murillo as a pleasingly
fierce and rebellious Alex, and
Mario Gonzalez as a slightly
underplayed Louis. Unfortu
nately for Mario, Louis must go
through some very difficult
and hysterical Freudian sei

zures, and Louis has little
character written for him out
side of these fits to fall back
upon.
Generally the cast succeeds
in keeping Porquois Pas from
resembling too much a remake
of another tale of youth in re
bellion, The Monkees.
The rebellion depicted in
Porquois Pas is serious and
worth taking notice of. After a
see-sawing job through much
of the film, the director crystal
lizes her vision at the finish to
convince one of the trio's real
ity and depth. They seem, now
as a quartet, on the way to suc
cess, or rather at least as far
along the way as those of us on
this side of menage-a-trois.

Sharing
We meet the three lovers,
Alex (the girl), Fernand and
Louis barely subsisting through
shared pleasures and
neuroses. Fernand, the eldest,
loves to cook, clean, and even
decorate the rooms of the
Alex makes the money
for all three, apparently by
reading the same book over
and over to a senile old wo
man. Louis, a big-eyed, boyish
schizophrenic, plays jazz piano
and electric guitar for most of
his day.
A big change comes into this
idyll when Fernand leaves to
seek out his new love, Sylvie.
He brings her back to the
house, but cannot bear to tell
her of the true nature of these
three musketeers' relation
ship.
She discovers Fernand in
bed with his lovers, and after
some anguish, she decides to
accept them with their limita
tions (which are many) and the
advantages they offer.
Non-conformity
The film offers an interest
ing, if occasionally awkward,

blend of characteristic French
slapstick and serious character
study. The trio, at their best,
rarely slip into contemporary
hip cliches, though Fernand's
Chaplin-esque walk and ob
session with death smack of
Harold and Maude and worse.
One sees some of the genuine
pain and emotion, the loneli
ness which comes with pro
found non-conformity, how
ever.
Unfortunately Porquois Pas
succumbs to some sloppy con
cepts in character and theme.
Not only the three kids, but
their lovable police chief
friend, Sylvieand herenergetic
mother fall prey to puppy-dog,
big brown-eyed cuteness and
adorable dialogue. (Alex
screams to Fernand upon view
ing his newly decorated "nur
sery" which looks like a burial
vault — "It's a two-berth cof
fin!")
Too many yelling arguments
turn abruptly, cutely, into
charming love scenes. The
big-eyed, soft-voiced young
man obsessed with death is not
a dislikable cliche, but when
Fernand becomes too superfi
cial the movie suffers. Alex,
Fernand and Louis, at their
worst, spend too much time
looking about with long faces
and misty eyes, a heart-tugging
litter of cuties who lack indi
viduality and do remind one of
the three musketeers, young
and lost in space.
'Real world'
Serreau attempts to under
score the difference between
the kids and "real world" by
making much of the adult
world look bizarrely insane,
and this hurts her point. She
beautifully photographs a
scene in which Louis' mad
father pours a pitcher of milk
over his own head (he is in an
guish over Louis' mother, who
is hospitalized as catatonic) but
one tends to feel like one is
paying an unnecessary visit to
the looney bin.
The lonely police chief falls
in love, of course, with the
lonely mother, because she
compassionately tells him that
he does not have an "egg-face"
as his cruel former wife said. It

becomes overpowering.
Somehow director Serreau
pulls a touching tale out of this
uneven montage. She has an
excellent eye Tor the human
face and the small glimpses of
emotion which it can reveal. It
is a briskly-paced movie with a
straightforward story, though
Serreau's tone and mood
swings too severely from ab
surd and exaggerated comedy
to quietly poignant narration.
Many of her scenes of con
temporary Parisian society are
silly and burlesque. (Police
chief comes to pick up Fernand
to play ping-pong in the Police
van. The table is inside, "bor
rowed" from the station for
the afternoon.) But she has a
way of making many of them
delightful and surprising.
Serreau also oversees some
excellent cinematography.

Porquois Pas pleases through
unobtrusive but active camera
work,; beautiful, slightly
greyed colours, and some very
warm sunlight sprinkled
suggestively throughout. She
photographs the very limited
sexual scenes between the
ihree with taste and a percep
tive grasp of the emotions in
volved.
Frey as Fernand
Sami Frey as Fernand has the
largest role and manages to
keep himself likable and cohe
rent in the midst of Serrau's
uneven direction. His sombre
Fernand is supported by Chris
tine Murillo as a pleasingly
fierce and rebellious Alex, and
Mario Gonzalez as a slightly
underplayed Louis. Unfortu
nately for Mario, Louis must go
through some very difficult
and hysterical Freudian sei

zures, and Louis has little
character written for him out
side of these fits to fall back
upon.
Generally the cast succeeds
in keeping Porquois Pas from
resembling too much a remake
of another tale of youth in re
bellion, The Monkees.
The rebellion depicted in
Porquois Pas is serious and
worth taking notice of. After a
see-sawing job through much
of the film, the director crystal
lizes her vision at the finish to
convince one of the trio's real
ity and depth. They seem, now
as a quartet, on the way to suc
cess, or rather at least as far
along the way as those of us on
this side of menage-a-trois.

val.)
Porquois Pas (Why Not) asks
the cinematic question "Why
shouldn't three people live and
sleep together as well as two?"
and asks it with an unusually
frank and eloquent angle. The

Coline Serreau depicts a very
emotional and reasonably
