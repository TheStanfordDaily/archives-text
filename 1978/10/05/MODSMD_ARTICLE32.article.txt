## S.F. Symphony provided classic afternoon at Frost 
### 
Some say that classical music
is elitist, but this time no one
came to the symphony in
jewels, no black limousines
were parked outside, and no
one had a box seat. Last Sunday
afternoon at Frost Amphithea
ter, over a thousand people,
mostly students, lay on the
grass — eating, drinking, or

seeking the perfect tan —
while the conductor stood
under a beach umbrella, or
chestra members wore straw
hats, and the violinist replaced
his black tuxedo with a casual
white suit. Not a snob in sight.
The program was especially
tailored to the natural beauty
of the setting: an all-
Beethoven concert featuring
the Violin Concerto and the
"Pastoral" Symphony No. 6.
The non-electronic sounds
of classical music often cause
amplification problems at out
door concerts, and Sunday was
no exception. The thin and
metallic timbre sounded like a
mediocre phonograph, and
loose cords caused crackling
before intermission. But once
one got used to it, the overall
effect of the sound system
(provided by Stanford Public
Events) was quite pleasant and
in some cases even enhanced
the sound quality. For exam
ple, the pizzicato string pas
sages in the second movement
of the concerto were striking.
Tight miking is like a mag
nifying glass over the or
chestra; every mistake will be
heard. But the orchestra under
young conductor Calvin Sim
mons rose to the occasion.
Under his firm baton, they ar
ticulated every note crisply and
cleanly.
Simmons directed with

casual elegance, but remained
totally in control, able to mus
ter commanding force when
necessary. A firm beat gave his
interpretation a forward
momentum, often achieved by
highlighting the moving 16th
notes in the middle orchestral
voices, but the sound always
remained tasteful and light,

tending toward the classic
rather than the romantic.
He skillfully avoided the
traps which often snare young
conductors: overinterpreta
tion, imbalance or impatience.
In the Pastoral Symphony,
the Brook (Movement 2)
flowed languidly, but Sim
mons' patience crafted some
beautiful passages, such as the
bassoon/cello solo near the
end. The Merry Gathering
(Movement 3) was sharp and
lively, the Storm (Movement 4)
drove forward with fearsome
urgency, and the Happy Feel
ings (Movement 5) displayed
some beautiful string phrasing.
A local talent, born and raised
in the Bay Area, schooled in

local groups, Calvin Simmons
may be on his way to the top.
Stuart Canin, the regular
concertmaster for the sym
phony, was a brilliant success
as soloist in the Violin Con
certo. The first movement was,
however, a disappointment.
This powerful monument to
19th Century German Roman-

ticism, though a grand emo
tional statement, was simply
too heavy for the occasion.
Canin himself seemed a bit un
comfortable with it, and the re
sulting interpretation was not
quite convincing.
The tempo was pedestrian,
the dynamics halfhearted, and
the phrasing not quite as
arched as one would have
liked. But with the exception of
a scruffy spot in the middle of
his range (perhaps due to prob
lems crossing strings and
perhaps due to the mic
rophones), Canin's technical
performance was awesome.
The sound was bright and
clean, the intonation near per
fect.

The second movement was
suitably peaceful, highlighted
by sensitive pianissimos. But
Canin suddenly came alive in
the final movement and pro
duced one of the finest in
terpretations I have ever
heard. Perhaps the haunting
calls and dance rhythms fitted
the outdoors atmosphere per
fectly, or perhaps Canin simply
felt more confident here, but
the dashing rondo theme rang
out with new assurance and
piano refrain echoed with
good humor.
As he played it, the light
hearted joy of the melody was
utterly convincing and he had
the audience tapping their feet
or singing along. Canin himself
seemed to delight in coaxing
every note, in stark contrast to
the hard working mood of the
first movement.
The audience responded en
thusiastically to the concert
and the players told me after
wards that they enjoyed play
ing at Frost. This was the first
year that the San Francisco
Symphony came to Stanford,
but the new Executive Director
of the Symphony, Peter Pas
treich, hopes to return next
year and plans to work closely
with the Stanford community
in the future. Everyone men
tioned the natural beauty of
Frost. So we can all look for
ward to more such attempts to
take music out of the concert
hall and to the people.

In the Pastoral Symphony,
the Brook (Movement 2)

beautiful passages, such as the
bassoon/cello solo near the

Stuart Canin, the regular
concertmaster for the sym
phony, was a brilliant success
as soloist in the Violin Con
certo. The first movement was,
however, a disappointment.
This powerful monument to
19th Century German Roman-

ticism, though a grand emo
tional statement, was simply
too heavy for the occasion.
Canin himself seemed a bit un
comfortable with it, and the re
sulting interpretation was not
quite convincing.
The tempo was pedestrian,
the dynamics halfhearted, and
the phrasing not quite as
arched as one would have
liked. But with the exception of
a scruffy spot in the middle of
his range (perhaps due to prob
lems crossing strings and
perhaps due to the mic
rophones), Canin's technical
performance was awesome.
The sound was bright and
clean, the intonation near per
fect.

The second movement was
suitably peaceful, highlighted
by sensitive pianissimos. But
Canin suddenly came alive in
the final movement and pro
duced one of the finest in
terpretations I have ever
heard. Perhaps the haunting
calls and dance rhythms fitted
the outdoors atmosphere per
fectly, or perhaps Canin simply
felt more confident here, but
the dashing rondo theme rang
out with new assurance and
piano refrain echoed with
good humor.
As he played it, the light
hearted joy of the melody was
utterly convincing and he had
the audience tapping their feet
or singing along. Canin himself
seemed to delight in coaxing
every note, in stark contrast to
the hard working mood of the
first movement.
The audience responded en
thusiastically to the concert
and the players told me after
wards that they enjoyed play
ing at Frost. This was the first
year that the San Francisco
Symphony came to Stanford,
but the new Executive Director
of the Symphony, Peter Pas
treich, hopes to return next
year and plans to work closely
with the Stanford community
in the future. Everyone men
tioned the natural beauty of
Frost. So we can all look for
ward to more such attempts to
take music out of the concert
hall and to the people.

The non-electronic sounds
of classical music often cause
amplification problems at out

no exception. The thin and
metallic timbre sounded like a
mediocre phonograph, and
loose cords caused crackling

one got used to it, the overall
effect of the sound system
(provided by Stanford Public
Events) was quite pleasant and
in some cases even enhanced
the sound quality. For exam

of the concerto were striking.
Tight miking is like a mag

casual elegance, but remained

hearted joy of the melody was
utterly convincing and he had
the audience tapping their feet
or singing along. Canin himself
seemed to delight in coaxing
every note, in stark contrast to
the hard working mood of the
first movement.
The audience responded en
thusiastically to the concert
and the players told me after
wards that they enjoyed play
ing at Frost. This was the first
year that the San Francisco
Symphony came to Stanford,
but the new Executive Director
of the Symphony, Peter Pas
treich, hopes to return next
year and plans to work closely
with the Stanford community
in the future. Everyone men
tioned the natural beauty of
Frost. So we can all look for
ward to more such attempts to
take music out of the concert
hall and to the people.
