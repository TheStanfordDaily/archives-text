# Controversial sale of land completed
## 
### 
The University has completed "in
all details" the controversial sale of
694 acres of land to the Mid-
Peninsula Regional Open Space Dis
trict, according to Staff Counsel Mike
Hudnall.
At its Sept. 12 meeting, the Board
of Trustees gave final approval to
plans to sell the so-called Black
Mountain Ranch to the MPROSD for
$475,000, or about $684 per acre. The
action came despite charges that the
University was selling the land for
below market price and giving the
district a "sweetheart deal."
The sale includes a provision disal
lowing any development of the land,
located along Page Mill Road near
Foothill Park. In addition, the Uni
versity retains the right to use the
land for educational purposes. Last
spring, University alumnus and Palo
Alto attorney Harry Aine charged that
the University was underselling the
land by some $1.6 million. An inde
pendent appraisal authorized and

paid for by Aine valued the land at
about $3000 per acre.
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy said, however,
that the appraisal "assumed the
maximum development possible'
under Palo Alto zoning regulation
and terrain restrictions.
Massy said the value of the land is
substantially decreased by the re
quirement that it never be de
veloped.
"Given the restrictions involved in
the sale," Massy said last month,
"the sale price is fair and reasona
ble."
Hudnall said that the University
has heard no further objection from
Aine. Aine was unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
The property now gives MPROSD a
6000-acre continuous corridor of
open space spanning the area from
Saratoga Gap to Page Mill Road and
Foothill Park. The land links two par
cels previously owned by the district.
