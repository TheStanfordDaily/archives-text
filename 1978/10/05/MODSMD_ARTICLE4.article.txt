# Trustees could consider new 500 unit dormitory
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
If all goes well, a proposal for a
new dorm on campus should be sent
to the Board of Trustees for consid
eration by the end of the year, said
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons.
Under the current plan, the new
housing would be a complex similar
in size to Wilbur Hall, about 800 to
900 spaces, and probably would be
located in the lot west of Lagunita
Court.
The project is now in the second of
the four planning stages it must
complete before construction could
begin, according to Lyons.
The first "step" occurred when the
Office of Residential Education and
Housing Management determined
that a new dorm was needed. Pre
sently, a joint committee composed
of Lyons' staff and the staff of Vice-
Provost William Massy are doing a
feasibility study. Lyons' staff mem
bers are studying the type of building
that would best serve student needs
now and in the future, while Massy's
staff is studying the project's financ
ing.
If the joint committee produces
what the committee terms a
"reasonable proposal," the project
will move to the thi rd step â€” consid
eration by the Board of Trustees. If
the board grants its approval, the
University Committee on Land and
Building Development will hire the
architect and finalize plans.

Lyons said the planning process
has taken anywhere from three to 10
years in the past. He added that the
final approval of Green Library took a
decade, but that dorms, as they are
generally less complex than libraries,
tend to take less time.
One of the project's major obsta
cles is the cost, Lyons said. "People
don't like to contribute for dorms, so
we have to recover the costs in
rents," he added.
He said the present room and
board costs include money to pay for
several existing residences. Most of
the funds for any new construction
would have to come from increased
room rent and from the operating
budgets of the present dorms.
Even though cost is a problem,
Lyons said he hope:. for what he calls
a quality living situation. "We want
something more than barracks," he
said.
Research by his staff has led him
to believe most students want a living
situation where they can interact
with their housemates, Lyons said.
This implies a small unit, much like a
row house, he added.
The new dorm complex most likely
would be composed of several au
tonomous units of about 60 persons
arranged around a common kitchen,
similar to Florence Moore Hall (Flo
Mo), Lyons said.
He added the common kitchen
might be necessary, because while it
is still economical for groups of 50

students to run an economically
competitive food service, only larger
groups may be able to hold down
costs enough in the future.
One of the advantages of a new
dorm would be more possible ex
perimentation with theme houses,
Lyons said.
Presently, any new theme house
means less housing for other stu
dents, Lyons said. With additional
housing, more requests for special
houses can be granted.
With the extra spaces the new
dorm would provide, Lyons said that
the quota system, which requires
fraternities to fill a certain number of
spaces each year, would become
unnecessary. He predicted that since
men would no longer be inclined to
join a fraternity merely to get good
housing, fraternities here would
probably become "fewer but
stronger."
The new dorm would be the sec
ond part of a housing improvement
program that has been in existence
since 1974. In that year, a study con
cluded that the University would
need 965 new spaces over the next
decade. About 460 of these would
replace the Manzanita Park trailers
and 505 would be new spaces.
Lyons said the Manzanita trailers
would be used for 10 more years,
mainly as graduate housing.
The new residence would bring
the total new housing above the orig
inally recommended 965.
