DES users face cancer risks
Washington — Federal health officials urged four
million to six million American mothers and their
children yesterday to get prompt medical chec
kups because of cancer risks they may face from
exposure to the synthetic estrogen DES during
pregnancy.
DES was widely prescribed from the 1940s until
as late as 1970 for pregnant women to prevent
miscarriages. That has been stopped, although
DES is still prescribed to women for such other
purposes as replacing estrogens during
menopause and as an emergency "morning after"
contraceptive pill in rape or incest cases.
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano Jr. said an HEW task force has concluded
that "an overwhelming majority" of the several
million persons exposed to DES during pregnancy
will not suffer any long-term ill effects, but "some
will have serious health problems."
FBI foils city destruction plot
St. Louis — A plot to steal a nuclear submarine
and possibly destroy an eastern city with a nuclear
missile was broken up with the arrest of two men
last night, the FBI reported.
Roy Klager Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI
office in St. Louis, said a two-month investigation
into the plot resulted in the arrest in St. Louis of
Edward Mendenhall, 24, of Rochester, N.Y., and
Kurtis John Schmidt, 22, formerly of St. Louis and
now of Kansas City, Mo.
Klager said plans furnished to an undercover FBI
agent showed the men planned to steal the U.S.S.
Trepang from its base at New London, Conn., and
turn it over to an unidentified purchaser in the
mid-Atlantic.
In Washington, Navy spokesman Rear Adm.
David Cooney said, "No 12 people off the street
are ever going to operate a submarine like this."
Air crash site has tourist appeal
San Diego — The neighborhood where the na
tion's worst air crash occurred has become a
tourist attraction, and some residents are bitter.
"Why don't you go away and leave us alone,"
reads a sign put up by Vera Knowles, whose home

was undamaged when a Pacific Southwest Airlines
jet and a small Cessna collided in the air and
crashed into the quiet North Park section of this
city on Sept. 25.
Carter to veto public works bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, suddenly
at odds with his most powerful congressional al
lies, dispatched administration leaders to the
Capitol yesterday in an escalation of his drive
against the $10.2 billion public works bill.
Carter has promised a veto of the "inflationary
. . . wasteful . . . absolutely unacceptable" bill by
the end of the week, announcing his intention in a
terse statement to reporters on Tuesday.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill, one of Carter's
staunchest backers, declared that the president
"is putting his head in the sand like an ostrich,"
adding that "if the vote were held today, we would
vote to override."

St. Louis — A plot to steal a nuclear submarine
and possibly destroy an eastern city with a nuclear
missile was broken up with the arrest of two men
last night, the FBI reported.
Roy Klager Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI

ERA deadline may be extended
Washington — The Senate signaled yesterday it
will extend the ratification deadline for the Equal
Rights Amendment and decided that states cannot
use the additional time to take back their approval
of the ERA.
By a 54-44 margin, the Senate rejected a prop
osal by Sen. JakeGarn (R-Utah) to couple an addi
tional 39-month ratification period with an oppor
tunity for ratifying states to rescind their actions.
The vote cleared a major congressional obstacle
facing ERA advocates while dealing a severe blow
to its opponents.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), principal Senate spon
sor of the extension, predicted the Senate would
approve the ERA extension by a healthy margin
when the issue comes to a final vote set for tomor
row.
Rhodesian leaders can visit U.S.
Washington — The State Department an
nounced yesterday it is approving visits to the Un
ited States by Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith
and other members of that country's biracial lead
ership.
The action ended a two-week tug-of-war within
the Carter administration over the propriety of
approving visa applications by leaders of a regime
which the United Nations regards as illegal.
Department spokesman Thomas Reston said the
administration decided to make an "exception" to
U.N. sanctions against Rhodesia because "we be

lieve the visit can contribute to the process of
achieving a settlement."
DES users face cancer risks
Washington — Federal health officials urged four
million to six million American mothers and their
children yesterday to get prompt medical chec
kups because of cancer risks they may face from
exposure to the synthetic estrogen DES during
pregnancy.
DES was widely prescribed from the 1940s until
as late as 1970 for pregnant women to prevent
miscarriages. That has been stopped, although
DES is still prescribed to women for such other
purposes as replacing estrogens during
menopause and as an emergency "morning after"
contraceptive pill in rape or incest cases.
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano Jr. said an HEW task force has concluded
that "an overwhelming majority" of the several
million persons exposed to DES during pregnancy
will not suffer any long-term ill effects, but "some
will have serious health problems."
FBI foils city destruction plot
St. Louis — A plot to steal a nuclear submarine
and possibly destroy an eastern city with a nuclear
missile was broken up with the arrest of two men
last night, the FBI reported.
Roy Klager Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI
office in St. Louis, said a two-month investigation
into the plot resulted in the arrest in St. Louis of
Edward Mendenhall, 24, of Rochester, N.Y., and
Kurtis John Schmidt, 22, formerly of St. Louis and
now of Kansas City, Mo.
Klager said plans furnished to an undercover FBI
agent showed the men planned to steal the U.S.S.
Trepang from its base at New London, Conn., and
turn it over to an unidentified purchaser in the
mid-Atlantic.
In Washington, Navy spokesman Rear Adm.
David Cooney said, "No 12 people off the street
are ever going to operate a submarine like this."
Air crash site has tourist appeal
San Diego — The neighborhood where the na
tion's worst air crash occurred has become a
tourist attraction, and some residents are bitter.
"Why don't you go away and leave us alone,"
reads a sign put up by Vera Knowles, whose home

was undamaged when a Pacific Southwest Airlines
jet and a small Cessna collided in the air and
crashed into the quiet North Park section of this
city on Sept. 25.
Carter to veto public works bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, suddenly
at odds with his most powerful congressional al
lies, dispatched administration leaders to the
Capitol yesterday in an escalation of his drive
against the $10.2 billion public works bill.
Carter has promised a veto of the "inflationary
. . . wasteful . . . absolutely unacceptable" bill by
the end of the week, announcing his intention in a
terse statement to reporters on Tuesday.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill, one of Carter's
staunchest backers, declared that the president
"is putting his head in the sand like an ostrich,"
adding that "if the vote were held today, we would
vote to override."
