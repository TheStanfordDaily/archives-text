# ISC discusses plans for year
## 
### ALEEN ZIMBEROFF 
A street party, sherry hour, support of Women's
Center activities and ushering at the Gaieties were
among the autumn quarter activities suggested at the
first Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) meeting yesterday af
ternoon.
"Our main purpose is to become known on campus as
someone officially here," said ISC President Tammy
Ritchey. The ISC wants "to get into the whole University
life" and "not just social things," she added.
"Many sorority women are interested in pursuing
more serious" activities this quarter, said ISC member
Susan Woolley.
The ISC also discussed open rush and a "hands off"
freshman policy.
Last year the ISC determined that sororities with less
than 50 members may hold open rush at any time during
the year to increase their membership. This total in
cludes sorority women at overseas campuses, the ISC
clarified yesterday.
According to Ritchey, most of the sororities will be
having open rush "sometime during the year." The pro
cedure probably will be "informal get-togethers" for
anyone who the sororities "think is interested."
Although there are no University or ISC rules govern
ing how to conduct rush, Ritchey said the ISC suggests

being "tactful" and "not hurting girls" in open rushing.
"If your group has just a few places, then a big party
won't be fair," she explained.
In addition, the ISC unanimously agreed that
"freshmen shall not be approached or contacted by any
sorority prior to the beginning of spring rush."
At least three other sororities have expressed interest
in starting colonies here, including Delta Gamma, Delta
Delta Delta and Sigma Delta Tau. To become a voting ISC
member, new sorority colonies here must have at least
three members and pay ISC dues.
Additional issues were discussed by Patricia Brandt, a
liaison from the Student Affairs staff. She informed the
group that Dean of Student Affairs' office is conducting
an "in-depth" study which includes a report on
sororities.
Twenty-five sorority women will be chosen at random
and interviewed about their reactions and feelings on
the organizations. Brandt also talked about the pos
sibilities of an on-campus building for sorority func
tions. Presently, two groups are renting apartments at
Oak Creek and holding meetings in the sorority build
ing's recreation room.
Other business at the meeting included distributing
the ISC Constitution and by-laws written by a committee
of ISC and faculty members last spring.
