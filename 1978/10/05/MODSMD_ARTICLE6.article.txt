# Communist brigade criticizes Chinese government
## 
### JONATHAN SLATER 
Members of the Revolutionary Communist
Youth Brigade (RCYB) sharply criticized the
present government of the People's Republic
of China for its alleged return to "reactionary
policies" since the death of Mao Tse-tung at an
open meeting in the Meyer Library forum
room last night.
In a 45 minute speech RCYB member Dick
Reffei accused Chinese leaders of restoring
capitalism and betraying the life-long work and
progress of Mao as well as fundamental
Marxist-Leninist, Maoist ideology.
The Mao Tse-tung Memorial meeting, which
attracted about 50 people, was sponsored by
the RCYB to enable "revolutionary minded
people" to get a better understanding of the
events in China, according to Raffei.
Reffei added that another one of the meet
ing's goals was to expose the fundamental de
partures from Maoist ideology which are pre

sently occurring, in the hope that these
changes will not be able to deter the revolutio
nary progress.
The meeting began with a short introduction
by an unnamed female member of the group,
who noted a reversal of the gains achieved by
the Chinese cultural revolution of the 19605.
She compared China today to the imperialist
and capitalistic activities of the Soviet Union 20
years ago.
Following her talk, a movie entitled "Mao —
The greatest revolutionary of our time" was
shown. The film highlighted many of the
former leader's achievements since the libera
tion of the Chinese proletariat from bourgeois
exploitation in 1949.
Reffei pointed out the progress Chinese soc
iety underwent during Mao's time. He noted
that Mao was able to unite the masses and lead
against the imperialist system. He called the
Cultural Revolution an "unprecedented

event."
Reffei also spoke of persistent attempts by
"capitalists" within the Chinese communist
party during and after Mao's life to integrate
capitalist systems of production and education
into society, and to rebuild a bourgeois class.
Reffei said that these people finally gained
power after Mao's death. He added that they
have worked to replace the separation bet
ween intellectual and manual labor by bring
ing in technological experts to manage the fac
tories — a distinction which Mao worked hard
to eliminate.
During the cultural revolution, intellectuals
worked side by side with the masses in produc
tion, he said. He added that this now is "less
the case."
Chinese society "still contains the soil for
poisonous weeds to develop," he warned, and
added that its leaders are selling China out to
the imperialists in Japan and the United States.

During the question and answer session that
followed, a member of the Revolutionary
Communist Party of the United States outlined
the following changes which he said have re
versed many of the accomplishments of the
Cultural Revolution:
— the modernization of industry combined
with a policy of relying only on experts for
direction,
— the disbanding of committees of workers
in the factories for political and cultural pur
poses,
— the reinstatement of exams in education
to perpetuate a one-sided educational system,
and even
— the importing of Pierre Cardin to design
clothing.
The meeting touched slightly on interna
tional issues. Participants disagreed with the
Chinese government's support of the Chilean
and Iranian regimes.

Members of the Revolutionary Communist
Youth Brigade (RCYB) sharply criticized the
present government of the People's Republic
of China for its alleged return to "reactionary
policies" since the death of Mao Tse-tung at an
open meeting in the Meyer Library forum
room last night.
In a 45 minute speech RCYB member Dick
Reffei accused Chinese leaders of restoring
capitalism and betraying the life-long work and
progress of Mao as well as fundamental
Marxist-Leninist, Maoist ideology.
The Mao Tse-tung Memorial meeting, which
attracted about 50 people, was sponsored by
the RCYB to enable "revolutionary minded
people" to get a better understanding of the
events in China, according to Raffei.
Reffei added that another one of the meet
ing's goals was to expose the fundamental de
partures from Maoist ideology which are pre

sently occurring, in the hope that these
changes will not be able to deter the revolutio
nary progress.
The meeting began with a short introduction
by an unnamed female member of the group,
who noted a reversal of the gains achieved by
the Chinese cultural revolution of the 19605.
She compared China today to the imperialist
and capitalistic activities of the Soviet Union 20
years ago.
Following her talk, a movie entitled "Mao —
The greatest revolutionary of our time" was
shown. The film highlighted many of the
former leader's achievements since the libera
tion of the Chinese proletariat from bourgeois
exploitation in 1949.
Reffei pointed out the progress Chinese soc
iety underwent during Mao's time. He noted
that Mao was able to unite the masses and lead
against the imperialist system. He called the
Cultural Revolution an "unprecedented

event."
Reffei also spoke of persistent attempts by
"capitalists" within the Chinese communist
party during and after Mao's life to integrate
capitalist systems of production and education
into society, and to rebuild a bourgeois class.
Reffei said that these people finally gained
power after Mao's death. He added that they
have worked to replace the separation bet
ween intellectual and manual labor by bring
ing in technological experts to manage the fac
tories — a distinction which Mao worked hard
to eliminate.
During the cultural revolution, intellectuals
worked side by side with the masses in produc
tion, he said. He added that this now is "less
the case."
Chinese society "still contains the soil for
poisonous weeds to develop," he warned, and
added that its leaders are selling China out to
the imperialists in Japan and the United States.

During the question and answer session that
followed, a member of the Revolutionary
Communist Party of the United States outlined
the following changes which he said have re
versed many of the accomplishments of the
Cultural Revolution:
— the modernization of industry combined
with a policy of relying only on experts for
direction,
— the disbanding of committees of workers
in the factories for political and cultural pur
poses,
— the reinstatement of exams in education
to perpetuate a one-sided educational system,
and even
— the importing of Pierre Cardin to design
clothing.
The meeting touched slightly on interna
tional issues. Participants disagreed with the
Chinese government's support of the Chilean
and Iranian regimes.
