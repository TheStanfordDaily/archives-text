# French chef makes pastry treats; Bakery shop 'delights' customers
## 
### MARY WENTWORTH 
A tempting array of
freshly-baked goods, piled
high on the Marcels'
counter by 7 a.m. each
morning, attests to the ex
pertise of a little round, bald
Frenchman who has been
baking here for eight years.
His name is Marcel Behr.
Skillfully lifting, flipping
and shaping delicate dough
in a tiny baking room be
hind the Tresidder Union
kitchen, Marcel creates but
tery croissants and brioche,
cheesecakes, doughnuts
and custom-decorated
cakes. The creations are
sold at a pastry shop bearing
his name in Tresidder Un
ion.
"It's not hard if you know
how," Marcel said, with a
smile, referring to the art of
cake decoration. During his
career as a pastry chef, Mar
cel has created many novel
ties. One, a cake fora celeb
ration of the Golden Gate
Bridge's completion, was
designed to replicate the
bridge. Marcel created
another cake for the tenth

anniversary of United Air
lines' coast-to-coast flights.
The cake featured small
working electric lights that
blinked on a sugary model
United Airlines' mainliner
plane.
"I've never known Marcel
to mess up an order and we
make so many wedding
cakes, 800 dozen
doughnuts at one time,
baked alaska for the whole
football team and many
other items. Of course, we
sometimes run out of
things, but people always
find something else to eat,"
one employee at the bakery
said.
Born in Alsace, France,
Marcel was trained in a
four-year apprenticeship at
Maison Olibier in France.
From the end of his appren
ticeship until his retirement
eight years ago, Marcel
worked as a pastry chef at
the Ambassador Hotel, in
France; the Westchester
Bittmore Country Club and
Pierre Hotel in New York
City, and at the Sir Francis
Drake Hotel in San Fran

cisco. More recently, he ran
bake shops in San Mateo
and Menlo Park.
Marcel integrates both
European and American
styles of baking, fashioning
American pies and
shortcakes as well as Euro
pean eclairs, cream puffs
and tortes. His pastries are

baked fresh from scratch
each morning. Leftovers?
"Anything left over goes
into his famous bread pud
ding," Louise Behr, Mar
cel's wife, said. "Students
love that dish."
Louise is half-owner of
Marcel's pastry shop. She
runs the business side.

"She came to California
fromTexasatagel9, skinny,
very skinny then," Marcel
said. "Now she is a bit
plumper," he added.
For many years, Marcel
arrived at work by 4 a.m.
Now, however, some of the
early morning responsibility
is shouldered by Stuart
Rosse, a junior who is
employed by Marcel as an
"informal apprentice."
Rosse has had experience
working in several other
local bakeries.

runs the business side.

"She came to California
fromTexasatagel9, skinny,
very skinny then," Marcel
said. "Now she is a bit
plumper," he added.
For many years, Marcel
arrived at work by 4 a.m.
Now, however, some of the
early morning responsibility
is shouldered by Stuart
Rosse, a junior who is
employed by Marcel as an
"informal apprentice."
Rosse has had experience
working in several other
local bakeries.

While you sleep, pastry chef Marcel Behr prepares hundreds of
taste treats, including doughnuts, brioche, cheesecakes and
special orders. The pastries are sold at Marcel's bakery in
Tresidder Union.
A tempting array of
freshly-baked goods, piled
high on the Marcels'
counter by 7 a.m. each
morning, attests to the ex
pertise of a little round, bald
Frenchman who has been
baking here for eight years.
His name is Marcel Behr.
Skillfully lifting, flipping
and shaping delicate dough
in a tiny baking room be
hind the Tresidder Union
kitchen, Marcel creates but
tery croissants and brioche,
cheesecakes, doughnuts
and custom-decorated
cakes. The creations are
sold at a pastry shop bearing
his name in Tresidder Un
ion.
"It's not hard if you know
how," Marcel said, with a
smile, referring to the art of
cake decoration. During his
career as a pastry chef, Mar
cel has created many novel
ties. One, a cake fora celeb
ration of the Golden Gate
Bridge's completion, was
designed to replicate the
bridge. Marcel created
another cake for the tenth

anniversary of United Air
lines' coast-to-coast flights.
The cake featured small
working electric lights that
blinked on a sugary model
United Airlines' mainliner
plane.
"I've never known Marcel
to mess up an order and we
make so many wedding
cakes, 800 dozen
doughnuts at one time,
baked alaska for the whole
football team and many
other items. Of course, we
sometimes run out of
things, but people always
find something else to eat,"
one employee at the bakery
said.
Born in Alsace, France,
Marcel was trained in a
four-year apprenticeship at
Maison Olibier in France.
From the end of his appren
ticeship until his retirement
eight years ago, Marcel
worked as a pastry chef at
the Ambassador Hotel, in
France; the Westchester
Bittmore Country Club and
Pierre Hotel in New York
City, and at the Sir Francis
Drake Hotel in San Fran

cisco. More recently, he ran
bake shops in San Mateo
and Menlo Park.
Marcel integrates both
European and American
styles of baking, fashioning
American pies and
shortcakes as well as Euro
pean eclairs, cream puffs
and tortes. His pastries are

baked fresh from scratch
each morning. Leftovers?
"Anything left over goes
into his famous bread pud
ding," Louise Behr, Mar
cel's wife, said. "Students
love that dish."
Louise is half-owner of
Marcel's pastry shop. She
runs the business side.

"She came to California
fromTexasatagel9, skinny,
very skinny then," Marcel
said. "Now she is a bit
plumper," he added.
