# Egyptians want rapid change
## Economy will improve slowly 
### 
Cairo, Egypt (AP) — The average Egyptian
looks at the prospects of peace with Israel and
sees a television set, a working telephone, bet
ter prices, a better salary — indeed, a better life.
He sees an Egyptian-Israeli treaty as the end of
30 years of sacrifice and austerity in the name of
national defense. But economists — both Egyp
tian and Western ones — take a more sober
view.
They predict the economy will improve
gradually but any peace is unlikely to produce
the immediate changes expected by the man in
the street.
The Egyptian government says that four wars
with Israel have cost an estimated $40 billion. As
a result, Egyptians are heavily taxed. A middle
class family of four with a monthly income of
$643, for example, pays $51 a month in national
security and defense taxes.
The same family pays a 12 percent extra de
fense tax on every theater ticket and is allowed
to buy meat only three times a week, in part so
that the army of 500,000 men can be fed.
The man in the street not only expects this
burden to be lifted, but he anticipates an
economic boom as well. And this, he expects,
will improve the roads, telephones and utilities
that have fallen into disrepairas the government
dug deeper for guns and warplanes.
Signs of this optimism are already evident.
Observed Cairo merchant Abdel Aal Hamad,
"The people are happy. Their appetite is whet
ted and they want to buy. People who never paid
their accounts are now paying and business is
up about 20 percent."
The economists, however, fear this optimism
could sour into disillusionment should the
economy not live up to expectations.
They expect taxes to remain high to finance
ambitious development schemes and military
spending, more than $1 billion last year, to con
tinue unchanged because of the need to replace
obsolete weapons and upgrade salaries.

Egypt's economy has already improved since
it reached its nadir at the time of the 1973 Middle
East war. Growth for the next two years is fore
cast at seven percent.
Serious problems remain, however. Inflation
on non-subsidized goods is running at an an
nual rate of 25 percent, urban unemployment is
12 percent and the trade balance is currently
$3.2 billion in the red.
Billions of dollars are needed to meet a hous
ing shortage of 1.1 million units and billions
more to upgrade long-neglected utilities such as
telephone, sewer lines and electricity.
Western economists say peace will provide no
solution to Egypt's population crisis — small
economic improvements have led to bigger
families — nor will peace solve the problem of
declining agricultural productivity that results in
part from migration to the cities.
Egyptian Planning Minister Abdel Rezzak
Abdel Meguid said in an interview, however,
that the proposed peace treaty would have sev
eral positive results:
— Oil from Sinai fields now in Israeli hands
will boost overall output to over one million
barrels a day. Earnings from oil will total $1 bill
ion a year — three times the current level —
within 18 months. And Egypt will qualify for
membership in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
— Foreign investment, $205 million last year,
"could easily be doubled" in an improved busi
ness climate resulting from peace.
— Demobilization of troops would put more
food in the stores for civilians. "This will be the
most visible impact for the average Egyptian,"
he said.
— The return of Sinai will provide a potential
harvest of minerals and a half-million acres of
arable land. But both will require time and siza
ble amounts of capital to develop.

— Demobilization of troops would put more
food in the stores for civilians. "This will be the
most visible impact for the average Egyptian,"
he said.
— The return of Sinai will provide a potential
harvest of minerals and a half-million acres of
arable land. But both will require time and siza
ble amounts of capital to develop.
Cairo, Egypt (AP) — The average Egyptian
looks at the prospects of peace with Israel and
sees a television set, a working telephone, bet
ter prices, a better salary — indeed, a better life.
He sees an Egyptian-Israeli treaty as the end of
30 years of sacrifice and austerity in the name of
national defense. But economists — both Egyp
tian and Western ones — take a more sober
view.
They predict the economy will improve
gradually but any peace is unlikely to produce
the immediate changes expected by the man in
the street.
The Egyptian government says that four wars
with Israel have cost an estimated $40 billion. As
a result, Egyptians are heavily taxed. A middle
class family of four with a monthly income of
$643, for example, pays $51 a month in national
security and defense taxes.
The same family pays a 12 percent extra de
fense tax on every theater ticket and is allowed
to buy meat only three times a week, in part so
that the army of 500,000 men can be fed.
The man in the street not only expects this
burden to be lifted, but he anticipates an
economic boom as well. And this, he expects,
will improve the roads, telephones and utilities
that have fallen into disrepairas the government
dug deeper for guns and warplanes.
Signs of this optimism are already evident.
Observed Cairo merchant Abdel Aal Hamad,
"The people are happy. Their appetite is whet
ted and they want to buy. People who never paid
their accounts are now paying and business is
up about 20 percent."
The economists, however, fear this optimism
could sour into disillusionment should the
economy not live up to expectations.
They expect taxes to remain high to finance
ambitious development schemes and military
spending, more than $1 billion last year, to con
tinue unchanged because of the need to replace
obsolete weapons and upgrade salaries.

Egypt's economy has already improved since
it reached its nadir at the time of the 1973 Middle
East war. Growth for the next two years is fore
cast at seven percent.
Serious problems remain, however. Inflation
on non-subsidized goods is running at an an
nual rate of 25 percent, urban unemployment is
12 percent and the trade balance is currently
$3.2 billion in the red.
Billions of dollars are needed to meet a hous
ing shortage of 1.1 million units and billions
more to upgrade long-neglected utilities such as
telephone, sewer lines and electricity.
Western economists say peace will provide no
solution to Egypt's population crisis — small
economic improvements have led to bigger
families — nor will peace solve the problem of
declining agricultural productivity that results in
part from migration to the cities.
Egyptian Planning Minister Abdel Rezzak
Abdel Meguid said in an interview, however,
that the proposed peace treaty would have sev
eral positive results:
— Oil from Sinai fields now in Israeli hands
will boost overall output to over one million
barrels a day. Earnings from oil will total $1 bill
ion a year — three times the current level —
within 18 months. And Egypt will qualify for
membership in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
— Foreign investment, $205 million last year,
"could easily be doubled" in an improved busi
ness climate resulting from peace.
— Demobilization of troops would put more
food in the stores for civilians. "This will be the
most visible impact for the average Egyptian,"
