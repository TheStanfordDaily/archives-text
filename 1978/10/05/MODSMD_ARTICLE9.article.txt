# Glassblower equipment used for labs, research
## 
### VANCE MASON 
Where do you find an old-fashioned
glassblower at Stanford? Go to the dark,
smelly basement of the Old Chemistry build
ing to visit Jan Van Gastel, one of the last
masters of a dying art.
Van Gastel's workshop is small and tidy.
Broken beakers, tubes and unidentifiable
pieces of glass are piled neatly on metal
shelves. Four-foot high tanks of butane
crowd one corner of the room. Pictures of
two children and a tennis racket lie on his
desk.
Van Gastel learned glassblowing from his
father. "He became a Master Glassblower at
16, the youngest Master ever," Van Gastel
said. "I used to come home from school and
watch him at work, and he taught me every
thing I know."
Van Gastel was born in Amsterdam, Hol
land in 1939. His family moved to South Africa
after World War 11, then to Palo Alto in 1959.
"My father worked tor the Stanford Research
Institute for 18 years. He's retired now. I
started working for Stanford University in
1969."
"I love my work. It lets me use my brains
and hands. Sometimes a research depart
ment needs a piece of equipment but they
don't know exactly what can be done. I look
over the project and see what I can make. I've
made high vacuum systems, diffusion

pumps, electron discharge tubes, many
things.
"I once worked at a factory where I had to
make hundreds and hundreds of the same
piece of glass. I quit after a week.
"You can't find an all-around glassblower
like me anymore. Everyone specializes in
laser tubes or something like that."
A delicate glass spinning wheel three in
ches high sits on Jan's desk. "I'm making that
for my wife," he said. "I make swans and
vases and such in my spare time. Once I gave
a demonstration for a troop of 20 girl scouts
and made glass animals for all of them."
Van Castel has two children, Jeff and Jen
nifer. "I don't know if my son will be a
glassblower. It's up to him. I would rather he
didn't because glassblowers are underrated
these days. They are just as skilled as lawyers
or doctors, but in America you aren't re
spected unless you have a college degree,"
he said.
Deep in the basement of the Old Chemis
try building, Van Gastel works on in solitude
— the only sounds are the noise of his torch
and the hum of generators and air
conditioners that share the basement with
him.
"It does get lonely down here sometimes,"
Van Gastel nods. But he said he likes it there,
and will probably continue to blow glass at
the University until he retires.

a demonstration for a troop of 20 girl scouts

glassblower. It's up to him. I would rather he
didn't because glassblowers are underrated
these days. They are just as skilled as lawyers

he said.
Deep in the basement of the Old Chemis

him.
"It does get lonely down here sometimes,"
Van Gastel nods. But he said he likes it there,
and will probably continue to blow glass at
the University until he retires.

(n his laboratory in the basement of the Old Chemistry build
ing, Jan Van Gastel performs the ancient art of glassblowing.
But it's not his hobby. Van Gastel fashions laboratory equip
ment used for research and instruction here.
Where do you find an old-fashioned
glassblower at Stanford? Go to the dark,
smelly basement of the Old Chemistry build
ing to visit Jan Van Gastel, one of the last
masters of a dying art.
Van Gastel's workshop is small and tidy.
Broken beakers, tubes and unidentifiable
pieces of glass are piled neatly on metal
shelves. Four-foot high tanks of butane
crowd one corner of the room. Pictures of
two children and a tennis racket lie on his
desk.
Van Gastel learned glassblowing from his
father. "He became a Master Glassblower at
16, the youngest Master ever," Van Gastel
said. "I used to come home from school and
watch him at work, and he taught me every
thing I know."
Van Gastel was born in Amsterdam, Hol
land in 1939. His family moved to South Africa
after World War 11, then to Palo Alto in 1959.
"My father worked tor the Stanford Research
Institute for 18 years. He's retired now. I
started working for Stanford University in
1969."
"I love my work. It lets me use my brains
and hands. Sometimes a research depart
ment needs a piece of equipment but they
don't know exactly what can be done. I look
over the project and see what I can make. I've
made high vacuum systems, diffusion

pumps, electron discharge tubes, many
things.
"I once worked at a factory where I had to
make hundreds and hundreds of the same
piece of glass. I quit after a week.
"You can't find an all-around glassblower
like me anymore. Everyone specializes in
laser tubes or something like that."
A delicate glass spinning wheel three in
ches high sits on Jan's desk. "I'm making that
for my wife," he said. "I make swans and
vases and such in my spare time. Once I gave
a demonstration for a troop of 20 girl scouts
and made glass animals for all of them."
