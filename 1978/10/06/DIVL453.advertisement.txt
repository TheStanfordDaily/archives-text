WHY JOHNNY CAN'T
RUN, SWIM, PULL, DIG,
SLITHER, ETC.
A Fairytale for the Young at Mind
A book to love or hate.
Recaptures the avant-garde from the nuts.
Rescues orthodoxy from the conservatives.
Did it ever occur to you
that there could be
an avant-garde orthodoxy?
Look into WHY lOHNNY CANT RUN. SWIM, PULL,
DIC, SLITHER, ETC. and find out that there is an
alternative to alternatives. The story line, a systematic
statement of philosophy, and an art history, all inter
woven, function as an intellectual Rorschach.
Caution: discussion and debate may be harmful to your
social life. On the other hand, it may be extremely
helpful, depending on the sort of person you are and
want your friends to be.
At the campus bookstore; at the best off-campus bookstores; or
from the publisher.
