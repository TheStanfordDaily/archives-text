# Gregorio fights dual houses
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
State Sen. Arlen Gregorio (D-
Menlo Park), campaigning before a
crowd of about 40 in Branner lounge
yesterday afternoon, said he plans to
continue his fight to abolish the two
houses of the California legislature
and replace them with a unicameral
(one-house) system.
Gregorio said he has tried several
times during the eight years he has
been a senator to get unicameral
legislation passed. But he admitted,
"it is not likely the senate will vote to
abolish itself."
Gregorio's plan would create a
single house of 99 members instead
of the present 120 members divided
between the assembly and senate.
Since there would be no overlapping
representation with a single house,

districts could be smaller, he added.
Gregorio said this would allow a
legislator more personal contact with
his constituents and limit the ability
of special interest groups to influ
ence the legislative process.
Gregorio plans to make his next
attempt through the initiative pro
cess, bypassing the legislature and
placing the issue directly on the bal
lot. Gregorio said that Paul Gann,
co-author of Proposition 13, has ex
pressed interest in the measure.
"Imagine," said Gregorio, "Paul
Gann and Common Cause both
fighting on the same side of an is
sue."
Gregorio said his original purpose
in running for the senate was to help
reform it. He mentioned several of
his past successes, including a 1973
bill that forced all senate and assem

bly meetings on the budget to be
held in public. Previous to that time,
Gregorio said some state budgets
had come out of committee never
having been seen by more than a
handful of people.
When asked about the effects of
Proposition 13, Gregorio said that
California's recent economic suc
cess, which is "beyond anyone's wil
dest expectations," has given the
state enough money to offset its los
ses in property taxes. However, he
said that because Prop. 13 cut the
local tax base, local governments
have lost some of their autonomy.
He cited two examples of state en
croachment on local authority. The
state now helps support police and
fire departments, but only if local
governments keep them at state
mandated levels, Gregorio said.

The state will also give funds for
local parks, but only if their
employees' wages are held at 1976
levels.
Cregorio termed both of these
procedures an "unreasonable" in
fringement on local rights.
Gregorio has tried four times to
pass a bill limiting legislators to 12
years in office. If he is re-elected, he
will be serving his third four-year
term. He said that he does not intend
to run again.
Gregorio also favors limiting cam
paign spending and he said he has
never taken contributions from any
large group. He said the largest
amount he has ever received is $1000
from his father-in-law in his first
campaign. He added that he has not
received any donation greater than
