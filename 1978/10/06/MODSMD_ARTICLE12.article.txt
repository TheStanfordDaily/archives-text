### ALISON CARPENTER 
Are there any public shower
ing facilities on campus which
are legally accessible to Stan
ford students on a 24 hour
basis? If so, where are they?
-R.N.
According to Master Planner
Oscar Nelson, there are no
such facilities available, nor
has there ever been any con
sideration of providing that
service. There are shower
facilities in the gyms and hous
ing units, but these of course
are not available on a 24 hour

basis.

What percentage of the stu
dent body lives on campus?
-K.
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs, said 78
percent of the 6500 under
graduates live in University
housing.
Based on last year's figures,
he added, approximately 60 to
65 percent of the total student
body resides on campus.
Whenever I go to put air in
my tires at the Campus Bike

Shop, I notice three houses
along that same row. Nothing
much ever seems to be going
on there. What are they used
for?
-N.P.
The buildings are referred to
as Mariposa, Rogers and Owen
Houses. All three have at one
time served as faculty resi
dences, but currently are used
as office buildings.
For the next three years,
Mariposa and Rogers Houses
will hold the Sociology De
partment offices, according to
Susan Scofield in the Provost's
office. In order that Building
120 in the Quad could be re
constructed, she said, it was
necessary that the department
vacate that building.
Mariposa formerly housed
the Spanish and Portugese De
partment offices and Rogers
served as the base for the
Center for Research in Interna
tional Affairs, Scofield added.
Owen House serves as the
base from which the California
Law Revision Commission
"studies California statuary
and decisional laws," said John
DeMoully, executive secretary
there.
