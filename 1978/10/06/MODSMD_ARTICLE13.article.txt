# Study shows profs prefer teaching to research

### RICH CHIN 
If the typical Stanford pro
fessor is a pipe-smoking intel
lectual committed to research
and publishing, then he's a
minority in the American
academic field, according to
recent surveys conducted by
political science professors
Everett Ladd, Jr. and Seymour
Martin Lipset.
Ladd and Lipset, who are
both senior Hoover fellows
here, have been polling
American professors for the
past nine years. Their latest
findings come from nation
wide surveys of randomly
selected schools conducted in
1975 and 1977.
The survey covered topics
ranging from salaries and work
habits to how professors vie
wed a number of social and
political issues. Stanford pro
fessors were included in the
1975 survey.
The results showed that the
majority of schools and col
leges in the United States are

primarily teaching institutions.
The surveys showed that 70
percent of faculty members ac
ross the country were more in
terested in teaching than in re
search, and 86 percent said
they had produced fewer than
three books or publications.
Research schools
But in major research
schools like Stanford, called
"Tier 1" institutions, 62 per
cent of those surveyed said
they leaned toward research,
59 percent had produced more
than 10 articles, and one in six
had written 50 or more.
But even Tier 1 schools are
marked by some under
achievement and less than
overwhelming enthusiasm for
research, according to the
study's findings. Only 17 per
cent of the respondents from
Tier 1 institutions said they
were "heavily" interested In
research as opposed to teach
ing.
Three quarters of the profes
sors in Tier 1 schools said they
had produced fewer than three
books or monographs. While
they may spend more time with
research, 54 percent of the Tier
1 professors indicated they
prefer teaching to research.
'Publish or perish'
Ladd said his reaction "is that
with all the emphasis on 'pub

lish or perish' and so on, many
faculty, even at Stanford, don't
publish an awful lot and don't
perish."
However, Lipset argued that
here "a very large proportion,
probably a majority of the fa
culty, want to do research."
According to Lipset, "Senior
professors aren't under any
compulsion to do research."
However, for professionals in
other occupations, "Their pos
itions in the field, their stand
ing and their recognition from
their colleagues is related to
their publications â€” their re
search."
No formal rule
Lipset said there is no formal
rule of "publish or perish"
here, but "a faculty member
who comes here and doesn't
do research is unlikely to stay if
he's an untenured person."
Research reputation is also
the main determining factor in
salaries and the rate of promo
tion for professors according
to Lipset.
Professors here agree with
Lipset according to a survey of
only those professors in the
school of Humanities and Sci
ences. The survey was con
ducted in 1976 by Sally Cole, a
graduate student in sociology.
It showed that 90 percent of the

faculty believe that research
and scholarship are "ex
tremely" or "very" important
in rewarding faculty, com
pared to only 12 percent who
see teaching as this important.
Faculty awards
Most of the professors, 58
percent, indicated they favor
no change in the influence of
research on faculty awards, but
32 percent desired a decrease
in the emphasis given to re
search. Over half felt that the
weight given to teaching
should be increased.
Craduate student Larry

Diamond, the head of a
student-appointed task force
on tenure and teaching quality,
said the majority of the faculty
feel the emphasis on research
and teaching should be more
equally balanced, with re
search only somewhat more
emphasized than teaching.
Diamond's 1977 task force
studied both the Stanford and
the Ladd-Lipset surveys.
In addition, Ladd and Lipset
found a strong correlation be
tween the political views of
professors and the make of
cars they drive. Conservatives

tend to buy American cars,
while liberals buy foreign cars.
Swedish cars are preferred by
the most liberal of car owners,
and professors who have no
cars are the most liberal of all.
Politically liberal
Ladd and Lipset also con
firmed the reputation that pro
fessors have for being the most
politically liberal occupational
group in the United States. For
example, the legalization of
marijuana was endorsed by
only 21 percent of the general
public, but by 58 percent of the
professoriate.

The surveys also show that
institutions and individuals
who are more research
oriented are more likely to be
liberal.
In addition, Ladd and Lipset
have found that professors are
satisfied with their lifestyles. A
large majority, 86 percent, said
they would definitely or prob
ably choose to be college pro
fessors if they were to begin
their careers again. Ninety-one
percent said the institution at
which they now work is a "very
good" or "fairly good" place
for them.
