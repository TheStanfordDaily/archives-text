A study by a psychologist
finds that Roman Catholicism's
requirement of celibacy for
priests is hurting the vocation
and keeping more indepen
dent personalities out of it.
Dr. Mark Kane of Adelphi
University's Institute of Ad
vanced Psychological Studies
reports his findings in a new
book, Lions of Cod, Lambs of
Cod.
He says extensive tests ad
ministered to 50 Catholic
priests and 50 Protestant minis
ters show a greater degree of
dependency and passivity in
the Catholic priests than
among Protestant ministers.
However, he says that these
qualities are more pronounced
in clergymen in general than in
people in most other fields. He
saysa majority of clergy display
various similar traits, includ
ing: a tendency toward loneli
ness, a great need to love and
receive love and attention, in
security about abilities, weak
ego strength, inner conflicts
over dependence and author
ity, and inhibition of aggressive
tendencies.
They also manifest a "desire
to expiate an existing sense of
guilt," Kane says, speculating
that this may indicate a kind of
masochism.
He maintains that Catholi
cism's insistence on a celibate
priesthood and its "reliance on
an autocratic nurturing church
structure" is behind the grea
ter degree of passive
receptiveness among its
priests.
"Christian clergymen who
are not obliged to mandatory
celibacy . . . function with gre
ater individual latitude and are
less passive-receptive and less
dependent," he says.
This "implies that organiza
tional changes within the
Roman Catholic priesthood
might possibly attract more
contented and effective candi
dates," he adds.
