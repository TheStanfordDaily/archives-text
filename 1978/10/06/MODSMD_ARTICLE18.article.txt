## Editorial CRAP has made its point 
### 
The ASSU constitutional amend
ment proposed by the Committee to
Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) has
already done more good for the
ASSU and its senate than anything to
hit Stanford in years.
Its proposed solution to the eter
nal problems of the senate are off
base, however, and we cannot sup
port the abolition of the senate and
the transference of its powers to the
Council of Presidents (COP).
A concentration of power in a COP
which is traditionally an executive
body on one mind is a dangerous
proposition. A system of checks and
balances, even on the modest scale
of the ASSU, is far preferable to an
often unrepresentative COP which
controls the ASSU like a mighty
Leviathan.
Granted, the senate desperately
needs reform before it can function
efficiently and intelligently. And for
the first time in years, the primary
issue of the upcoming campaign will
be senate reform. This year's candi
dates realize the tenuous position of
the senate and will hopefully work to
make that body a functional one. We
can only thank CRAP for its coercive
influence on these candidates.
The abolition of the senate will
serve only to lessen the integrity and
power of the ASSU in the minds of
the administration, and open stu
dent government here, in general, to
more ridicule, instead of creating the
support it should have.
But, of course, that is just the in
tent of CRAP. Doug Bandow and
Mike Roberts are carrying the liber
tarian ideals of no government to the

University. In the ASSU as in the Un
ited States, no government is good
government for these men. First, the
senate is abolished and then the
COP. The special projects are not far
behind and before long, a few enter
prising students will be promoting
concerts, publishing course guides
and presenting the Sunday Flicks. Ef
ficient? Maybe. Optimal? Certainly
not.
Good government has its virtues
and bad government doesn't. But
the senate's poor showing in recent
years doesn't prevent it from once
again becoming a significant institu
tion in the University. Whether the
senate can pull itself to its feet again
is up to the students of this Univer
sity.
Some of the candidates running
for the senate this year are serious
about senate reform. Others are not
and simply want to add a title to their
law school application. When a can
didate comes to your door and asks
for your vote, ask that person about
senate reform. The possibilities are
many but will only be considered by
those candidates interested in the
senate and the ASSU, not their ad
mission to law school.
In the end, CRAP may be the
catalyst for senate resurgence.
Without your concern, however,
self-minded candidates will serve
their terms and leave the senate's
fate to next year's senators. But the
threat of CRAP may not die with this
election. And the senate and the
ASSU may not deserve more than
one chance to fix their leaky ship.
