# Arnold frustrated by ethics of political ads

### SAMUEL HOWE 
After almost 20 years of professional involvement in
political campaigns, Bud Arnold says that he is "ready to
get out." Despite successful work as the head of the
national advertising effort for )ohn F. Kennedy's presi
dential campaign in 1960 and subsequent work in
California politics, Arnold feels frustrated by the con
straints now placed on media consultants.
Arnold, who graduated from the University in 1948 as
an English major, told a gathering of students last night
at the American Studies House, "I'm finding it more and
more difficult and distressing to work on political cam
paigns. . . . With hardball commercials now, it doesn't
matter if you misrepresent or mislead. It's just important
to win — the old business of 'the end justifies the
means.' "
The presentation on "Politics and the Media" was
sponsored by the Stanford Committee on Political Edu
cation (SCOPE).
SCOPE'S projects include the presentation of debates,
symposia, lectures, polling drives, vote analysis and dis
cussions such as Arnold's last night, according to Pete
Stamos, a SCOPE co-director.
Arnold, who is founder and president of the Maxwell
Arnold Agency, an advertising firm in San Francisco,
lamented the decline of the media consultant's role in
political adverising, as those involved in campaign man
agement have gradually taken over media respon
sibilities.
Conflicts
The problem, Arnold said, is that there are a number of
conflicts which arise when campaign managers try to
involve themselves in advertising — most noticeably, a
conflict of talent.
Arnold wrote recently in an article titled "Pitchman's
Lament — Do campaign managers belong in the adver
tising business?" published in the California lournal of
Politics, "Campaign management people are usually
lawyers, businessmen, technicians, strategists. They are
seldom creative. They are not professional writers, di
rectors, artists or producers. They are amateurs — of the
most dangerous kind."
The talk was punctuated by several advertising spots

which Arnold helped to create, including ads for Burt
Pines' campaigns for Los Angeles city attorney, Rep. Pete
McCloskey's congressional bids, William Roth's 1974 at
tempt at the governorship and the Proposition 9 anti
corruption bill.
Although Roth's campaign was the only one of these
four which was not ultimately successful, Arnold singled
it out as being significant. Roth started in February 1974
with a recognition rate of less than one percent.
Because of his low standing in the polls, Roth received
virtually no "free media" coverage from either television
or the newspapers, and therefore had to pay large
amounts just to make his name known to the voters.
Arnold illustrated the success of the campaign by point
ing out that by the June primary, Roth had a recognition
rate of almost 50 percent, and also polled 13 percent in
the primary (which was won by then-Secretary of State
jerry Brown).
Impressive results
For a man with such little recognition and therefore
such little coverage, the 13 percent vote was impressive.
It would have been impossible for Roth to have won the
election, Arnold said, because of the importance of
those initial recognition polls. "That is why — with all its
faults — I'm in favor of public funding for political elec
tions," he concluded.
Arnold's work with political campaigns actually began
with the election of 1960.
Advent of video
The Kennedy campaign saw the advent of videotape
spots as opposed to regular film advertising. Videotape
tends to give more of a "live" impression, a sense for the
audience of actually being there, according to Arnold.
However, the choice to use videotape ads instead of film
was not deliberate, Arnold said.
Normal film spots take up to six weeks to produce,
and "we had come to within four weeks of election day,
and not one spot was okayed. So we decided to go to
video — it was simply the quickest way to get on the air."
Existing tapes of Kennedy appearances were taken, such
as those from Kennedy's four debates with Vice-
President Richard Nixon, and those were edited into
one- and five-minute spots.
