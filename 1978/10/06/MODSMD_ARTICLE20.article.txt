PLO supported
Alex Alben's rebuttal (Daily,
Oct. 3) of my column of Sept.
28 warrants a few comments in
response.
Alben's article, although
somewhat passionate, con
tains a number of legitimate
comments on the Middle East
problem. He misses, however,
the essence of the problem,
which is the Palestinian prob
lem. This was the thrust of my
article. The Palestinians cannot
be ignored and the PLO, re
garded as their "legitimate rep
resentative," must be included

A most disturbing element in
Alben's article is the "ad
hominem" style he undertakes,
Expressions such as "if he had
ever read," "I would not be
surprised if Economides does
not know,"and "his alleged
quotation of Golda Meir" do
not promote constructive de
bate. It is unnecessary to try to
prove your debater ignorant. A
case in point is his "correc
tion" of my alleged misquota
tion of Meir's comments. In my
article I refer to a "1969
aphorism" of hers. He, I hope
via an oversight, does not find
those comments in a January,
1976 statement. In June, 1969,

she said:
"There was no such thing as
Palestinians (when the Jews
came to Palestine). Itwas not as
though there was a Palestinian
people and we came and threw
them out and took their coun
try away from them. They did
not exist."
Her comments have been
widely used in a number of
publications here and abroad.
In fact, they appeared only a
few days ago in a Pete Hamill
article reprinted in the San
Francisco Chronicle (Sept. 23,
1978, p. 36).
