## More controls impractical 
### 
The lesson Peter Faulker has chosen to draw
from the San Diego air disaster (Daily, Oct. 3)
indicates a complete lack of understanding of
private aviation. As the owner of a small plane
based at Palo Alto, I think I can provide an
opposing point of view.
First of all, let us put this crash into a
reasonable perspective. Commercial flying is
one of the safest forms of transportation
known. Since mid-air collisions account for
less than 1 percent of all accidents, Faulkner
has proposed some very harsh measures
which, even if totally effective, would have a
very small effect on the overall accident rate.
Most people prefer that public safety be
balanaced against the effects of regulation on
personal freedom and economic progress.
Faulkner's proposals would destroy most of
private aviation, both in the Bay Area and
much of the nation. Essentially, he proposes
that all private aircraft be banned below 3000
feet and be subject to continuous, radar
directed control above that in any region
where there is a remote possibility that airlin
ers and private aircraft could share the same
airspace. This includes most of the major
population centers of the country. (It is
ridiculous to suggest that Stanford be given
special protection.)
What he does not realize is that the capacity
of a positive control system such as he prop
oses is extremely limited, in part by its
enormous cost, but more importantly by the
number of aircraft that can be controlled at
one time on the few radio frequencies availa
ble. (Expanding the system by using many
controllers on many frequencies for the same
airspace would not work at all, for obvious
reasons.) This system is already near capacity
at the biggest centers, servicing only airlines
and occasional private aircraft flying on in
struments. Since there are roughly 100 times

more private aircraft than airliners, Faulkner's
proposal could not work without eliminating
most private flying.
I hope it is clear that any proposal such as
his would severely affect my ability to use and
enjoy my aircraft. Further, what few people
understand is that private aviation is a signific
ant means of transportation. I could easily
document its importance to the efficient
management of decentralized industries. And
as fare competition forces airlines to cut back
less profitable service to small cities, private
aviation will grow in importance.
In my opinion the present terminal control
areas work very well at separating airliners
from slower private aircraft. Faulkner's worry
that jets occasionally stray out of TCA's could
be dealt with better by stringent enforcement
of the present rules. A more difficult problem
is posed by the mix of jets and private planes
at airports such as San Diego or, say, San Jose,
which do not have enough jet traffic to meet
the criteria for establishment of TCA's. This is
of great concern to me. I can easily see and
avoid jets ahead or to the side of me, but the
prospect of being run down from behind, as
was the poor soul flying the Cessna at San
Diego, is understandably chilling.
The proposal that makes the most sense to
me is the establishment at such airports of
well-defined approach corridors for jets. I
would joyously avoid them. The jets would
have the separation they need, and corridors
would be less complex and restrictive than
TCA's. I have little hope for the prospect of an
electronic collision avoidance system which
would be both more effective than the ap
proach corridor idea and still cost me less for
equipment than I paid for my entire airplane.

ble. (Expanding the system by using many
controllers on many frequencies for the same
airspace would not work at all, for obvious
reasons.) This system is already near capacity
at the biggest centers, servicing only airlines
and occasional private aircraft flying on in
struments. Since there are roughly 100 times

more private aircraft than airliners, Faulkner's
proposal could not work without eliminating
most private flying.
I hope it is clear that any proposal such as
his would severely affect my ability to use and
enjoy my aircraft. Further, what few people
understand is that private aviation is a signific
ant means of transportation. I could easily
document its importance to the efficient
management of decentralized industries. And
as fare competition forces airlines to cut back
less profitable service to small cities, private
aviation will grow in importance.
In my opinion the present terminal control
areas work very well at separating airliners
from slower private aircraft. Faulkner's worry
that jets occasionally stray out of TCA's could
be dealt with better by stringent enforcement
of the present rules. A more difficult problem
is posed by the mix of jets and private planes
at airports such as San Diego or, say, San Jose,
which do not have enough jet traffic to meet
the criteria for establishment of TCA's. This is
of great concern to me. I can easily see and
avoid jets ahead or to the side of me, but the
prospect of being run down from behind, as
was the poor soul flying the Cessna at San
Diego, is understandably chilling.
The proposal that makes the most sense to
me is the establishment at such airports of
well-defined approach corridors for jets. I
would joyously avoid them. The jets would
have the separation they need, and corridors
would be less complex and restrictive than
TCA's. I have little hope for the prospect of an
electronic collision avoidance system which
would be both more effective than the ap
proach corridor idea and still cost me less for
equipment than I paid for my entire airplane.

The lesson Peter Faulker has chosen to draw
from the San Diego air disaster (Daily, Oct. 3)
indicates a complete lack of understanding of
private aviation. As the owner of a small plane
based at Palo Alto, I think I can provide an
opposing point of view.
First of all, let us put this crash into a
reasonable perspective. Commercial flying is
one of the safest forms of transportation
known. Since mid-air collisions account for
less than 1 percent of all accidents, Faulkner
has proposed some very harsh measures
which, even if totally effective, would have a
very small effect on the overall accident rate.
Most people prefer that public safety be
balanaced against the effects of regulation on
personal freedom and economic progress.
Faulkner's proposals would destroy most of
private aviation, both in the Bay Area and
much of the nation. Essentially, he proposes
that all private aircraft be banned below 3000
feet and be subject to continuous, radar
directed control above that in any region
where there is a remote possibility that airlin
ers and private aircraft could share the same
airspace. This includes most of the major
population centers of the country. (It is
ridiculous to suggest that Stanford be given
special protection.)
What he does not realize is that the capacity
of a positive control system such as he prop
oses is extremely limited, in part by its
enormous cost, but more importantly by the
number of aircraft that can be controlled at
one time on the few radio frequencies availa
ble. (Expanding the system by using many
controllers on many frequencies for the same
airspace would not work at all, for obvious
reasons.) This system is already near capacity
at the biggest centers, servicing only airlines
