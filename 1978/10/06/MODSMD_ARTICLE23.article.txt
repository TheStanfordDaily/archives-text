## Anti-gay Briggs Initiative unjust 
### 
The issues involved in the Briggs Initia
tive, the measure which would prevent
avowed homosexuals from teaching in the
public schools, have been oversimplified
by both its supporters and its opponents.
Millions of persons opposed to
homosexuality are compelled through ta
xation to support the public schools. Be
cause the state subsidizes public but not
private or parochial schools, many parents
have little choice but to send their children
to the public schools.
Such persons have a right to not have
their children educated by, or their money
used to hire, a person espousing a lifestyle
of which they disapprove.
The opponents of the Briggs Initiative
have unduly ridiculed the view that av
owedly gay teachers may influence their
students. The dogmatic assertion that gays
are born and not made has not been
proven: no one really knows why some
persons are homosexuals. It is not un
reasonable to believe that the orientation
of a teacher could influence some of his
students.
Nor do gay teachers have an inalienable
right to their tax-supported jobs. A person
is employed (whether by government or in
the free sector) to advance some goal of
his employers. If he works against the
purposes of his employers, it is absurd for
him to claim a right to continued employ
ment.
However, the supporters of the Briggs
Initiative are also blind to some of the is
sues involved.

Cays also pay taxes. Some parents are
homosexual or bisexual; others would
welcome a chance for their children to be
exposed to a person of unusual views or
lifestyles.
The Briggs Initiative violates such per
sons' rights as surel / as the status quo viol
ates the rights of anti-gay parents or tax
payers.
Either alternative significantly violates
the rigths of some citizens; within the
framework of the public school system,
there is no just solution.
In a pluralist society embodying widely
divergent values and lifestyles, the exis
tence of a homogenizing institution such
as public education, an institution to
which everyone is forced to contribute
and which most children are forced to at
tend, is a guarantee of social conflict and
injustice.
The central problem raised by the Briggs
Initiative is neither the alleged possible in
fluence of gay teachers as role models nor
the alleged bigotry of Briggs and his sup
porters. The real problem is the rigid sys
tem of government schooling which im
poses a uniform educational system on a
community which encompasses a wide di
versity of views and lifestyles.
Widespared government schooling was
born in the 19th century reaction against
individual liberty. The only real solution to
the dilemma raised by the Briggs Initiative
(and to the other conflicts, divisions, and
injustices which have plagued the schools
in recent years) is the abolition of compul

sory, tax-supported, government
operatied schools and an end to the state
educational monopoly.
Given that such a goal is not im
mediately practicable, how should one
vote on the Briggs Initiative?
The decisive consideration must be that
the public schools are a part of govern
ment, and, because of the overwelming
force possessed by government, the pow
ers and discretion of government must be
severely restrained.
If government is not compelled to be
blind to differences of values and lifestyles
in the government schools, there is a real
danger that it will eventually attempt to
impose the chosen lifestyle or values on
non-governmental instituions and on pri
vate persons (as it has in fact done histori
cally).
Despite the fact that the status quo im
poses an injustice on parents or taxpayers
morally opposed to homosexuality, the
Briggs Initiative should therefore be de
feated.
Instead of attacking a particular minor
ity, the proponents of the Briggs Initiative
(and anyone who values justice and
human rights) should turn their attention
to ending the public school system, to es
tablishing the separation of school and
state, and to creating a freedom and diver
sity in education that would benefit all citi
zens.

of which they disapprove.
The opponents of the Briggs Initiative
have unduly ridiculed the view that av
owedly gay teachers may influence their
students. The dogmatic assertion that gays
are born and not made has not been
proven: no one really knows why some
persons are homosexuals. It is not un
reasonable to believe that the orientation
of a teacher could influence some of his
students.
Nor do gay teachers have an inalienable
right to their tax-supported jobs. A person
is employed (whether by government or in
the free sector) to advance some goal of
his employers. If he works against the
purposes of his employers, it is absurd for
him to claim a right to continued employ
ment.
However, the supporters of the Briggs
Initiative are also blind to some of the is
sues involved.

Cays also pay taxes. Some parents are
homosexual or bisexual; others would
welcome a chance for their children to be
exposed to a person of unusual views or
lifestyles.
The Briggs Initiative violates such per
sons' rights as surel / as the status quo viol
ates the rights of anti-gay parents or tax
payers.
Either alternative significantly violates
the rigths of some citizens; within the
framework of the public school system,
there is no just solution.
In a pluralist society embodying widely
divergent values and lifestyles, the exis
tence of a homogenizing institution such
as public education, an institution to
which everyone is forced to contribute
and which most children are forced to at
tend, is a guarantee of social conflict and
injustice.
The central problem raised by the Briggs
Initiative is neither the alleged possible in
fluence of gay teachers as role models nor
the alleged bigotry of Briggs and his sup
porters. The real problem is the rigid sys
tem of government schooling which im
poses a uniform educational system on a
community which encompasses a wide di
versity of views and lifestyles.
Widespared government schooling was
born in the 19th century reaction against
individual liberty. The only real solution to
the dilemma raised by the Briggs Initiative
(and to the other conflicts, divisions, and
injustices which have plagued the schools
in recent years) is the abolition of compul

sory, tax-supported, government
operatied schools and an end to the state
educational monopoly.
Given that such a goal is not im
mediately practicable, how should one
vote on the Briggs Initiative?
The decisive consideration must be that
the public schools are a part of govern
ment, and, because of the overwelming
force possessed by government, the pow
ers and discretion of government must be
severely restrained.
If government is not compelled to be
blind to differences of values and lifestyles
in the government schools, there is a real
danger that it will eventually attempt to
impose the chosen lifestyle or values on
non-governmental instituions and on pri
vate persons (as it has in fact done histori
cally).
Despite the fact that the status quo im
poses an injustice on parents or taxpayers
morally opposed to homosexuality, the
Briggs Initiative should therefore be de
feated.
Instead of attacking a particular minor
ity, the proponents of the Briggs Initiative
(and anyone who values justice and
human rights) should turn their attention
to ending the public school system, to es
tablishing the separation of school and
state, and to creating a freedom and diver
sity in education that would benefit all citi
zens.

The issues involved in the Briggs Initia

public schools, have been oversimplified
by both its supporters and its opponents.
Millions of persons opposed to
homosexuality are compelled through ta
xation to support the public schools. Be
cause the state subsidizes public but not
private or parochial schools, many parents
have little choice but to send their children
to the public schools.

their children educated by, or their money
used to hire, a person espousing a lifestyle
