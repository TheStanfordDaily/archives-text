## Battle with ourselves continues 
### 
This was going to be a lament
for those good old days of
anti-racist activism, of moral
courage and of the will to win
justice for every woman and
man. These days it's hard to
write such a thing without
sounding inflammatory and
therefore ludicrous, or
hopelessly insipid.
I could have written of the
strength of vision of Martin
Luther King and the other civil
rights leaders of the '60s, and
then struck a mournful, mar
tyred pose, imbued the words
with pathos until they dripped,
and questioned rhetorically
what has happened to civil
rights that racism should still
be so rampant in the United
States.
But you know as well as I
what happened to civil rights
and why racism is still around,
sometimes in a disguised form
and sometimes not, and why
that hypothetical column
would have drawn no response
from you, except for a passing
yawn.
No movement, not even a
violent revolution can ever
maintain an intense, compel
ling thrust forward for any
length of time greater than a
decade or two. Sometimes his
tory is peculiarly like physics;
its movements and trends, im
pelled by the force of a few
charismatic leaders, develop a
momentum and glide on for a
while until inertia brings them
to a slow, dying halt. Many
people may still be ideologi
cally committed to ending pre
judice, but the social upheaval
and the shocks to the American
lifestyle have left everyone,
progressive crusaders in
cluded, burned out.
There is another, more in
sidious dimension to this en
nui. Nothing is harder than
penetrating a self-made illu
sion many of us want to believe
that racism is well on its way to
oblivion. For anyone who has
never been to the South, this
isn't hard to believe. There are
affirmative action programs,
and you see them — 'them'
being minorities of any group
— working in banks, law of
fices, hospitals, and, yes, uni

versities. A number of cities
"even" have black mayors.
But can it really be true? Do
racial prejudices, habits con
ditioned into people from birth
and deeply embedded in the
culture and lifestyles of a soci
ety, really go away after one
wasy?
The question poses its own
answer. Perhaps the overt ra
cial intolerances are no longer
so widespread, butthis doesn't
mean they aren't there; some
hide their feelings out of fear.
Even among the so-called to
lerant, progressive liberals of
the white community (which
has never been noted for its
lack of hypocrisy), there are
doubtless unconscious biases.
We can be so secure in our
self-righteousness that we
need never be aware of them.
Last spring quarter during
Dead Week, members of
Junipero House, the Asian-
American theme house, at
tacked residents of neighbor
ing Madera House with water
balloons. It was a typical col
lege student prank as these
things go. The residents of
responded by playing
a tape which they themselves
prepared, intended as a comic
reprimand and a satire of the
Junipero action. It was in the
form of a news broadcast
which drew the analogy of the
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor
by Japanese forces, even to the
point of imitating, with ap
propriate modifications,
Roosevelt's". . . a day that will
live in infamy," speech.
Having been a witness to this
broadcast, I must confess that
it was very well done, almost
professional in quality. How
ever, the racial slurs included
as part of the broadcast — im
itations of the Japanese lan
guage, and statements like "we
can't wait 'til you pack up your
. . . chopsticks . . . and get the
fuck out," — seem to give lie to
the idea that intolerance is on
its way out.
I don't wish to pass judg
ment on the responsible resi
dents even though this re
counting of the incident
suggests the opposite. In my
mind, it is not clear whether

the broadcast was an outright,
conscious slur or an indiscre
tion of the unconscious mind.
It does suggest to me that
lifetimes of belief cannot be
exorcised during a single
tumultous decade.
The great threat to minorities
in the coming generations is
the hidden one — the simple
misunderstanding of human
nature. Human beings,
perhaps through some biolog
ical imperative, are self
centered creatures. No one
can look after the interests of
others before one sees to one's
own. And the consicous wak
ing mind has less power over
its conditioned beliefs and in
stincts than we would like to
believe.
Minorities cannot begin to
remove social prejudice before
they understand the dominant

group's viewpoint, the feeling
of threat and loss, and stub
born, intractable human na
ture. Whites can never claim to
be progressive and tolerant be
fore they fully understand the
effects of long exposure to the
values of the past.
And both sides have to be on
constant guard against relaps
ing into the old patterns of in
tolerance and conflict politics.
It is no longer a short term war
of rhetoric, civil disobedience
and litigation. It has become a
war for thinking human be
ings, likely to be fought for a
very long time, with very high
stakes, and against ourselves
rather than some nonexistent
enemy.
