# Brimming with seafaring tales
## Local family returns to port 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Few men can carry out their
dreams of a lifetime and even
fewer can feel satiated when
those dreams are filled. But for
a Palo Alto man and his family,
five years of planning and a life
of dreaming because a real and
satisfying adventure.
In August, 1973, Chuck Wil
cox, his wife Dawn and their
two children sailed out of San
Francisco Bay in a 40-foot
F.astport Maine Pinky, equip
ped with four forward bunks, a
galley and plenty of storage
space.
Last summer, the family re
turned to the Redwood City
Yacht Harbor, hungry and
tired, and happy.
"We'd miscalculated how
long it would take to get from
Panama back to California and
we had to ration food and wa
ter," Wilcox said, explaining
his family's underweight,
exhausted condition. "We
were glad we went, but as you
can imagine, after five years we
were glad to be back."
Shipwreck
The trip was not planned to
take five years. After one year
of sailing, the ship hit a reef in
the Fiji Islands and the family
was marooned there foralmost
a year, while the ship was re
paired.
"We really weren't in any
danger at the time of the
wreck, but we sure thought we
were," Wilcox said. "Every
time the tide came in, the boat
filled halfway with water. We
abandoned ship and walked on
the coral to the small island."
After staying one day on the
deserted island, the family was
found by a cruise boat touring
the area. They were picked up
and taken to Fiji, where they
stayed for the next 10 months.
"If you're going to be ship
wrecked anywhere, Fiji is a
nice place to be," Wilcox
laughed. "We could conve
niently, easily and fairly
cheaply get the boat fixed
there.;'
Mrs. Wilcox added that the
cost of living in Fiji was low.

She fed, clothed and housed
her family for about $20 a
week.
Funds for the trip had been
saved since 1968. Before
weighing anchor in 1973, the
family sold all the house fur
nishings and gave Wilcox's
father the power of "attorney
over the house and checking
account," Wilcox said.
"We found that traveler's
checks were liked around the
world except in the Arab coun
tries," Wilcox said. "There's
alscran extensive black market
on money, especially in Su
dan."
Although the Wilcoxes know
French and Spanish, they en
countered language difficul
ties in some areas, especially
where numerous tribes, each
with a different dialect, lived.
But no matter where they
ended up, every merchant
seemed to understand the En
glish words, "How much?"
Mrs. Wilcox laughed.
Stocking up
The family had to purchase
food at almost every port,
sometimes stocking up for
threemonthsatatime. Besides
living on canned foods and
fresh vegetables bought at port
markets, the family caught fish
on long trips.
On the trip from Panama to
California, the Wilcoxes' son
Garth, now 18, caught a small
shark in his net.
"He was docile," Garth said.
"He didn't struggle at all. But
we could only use him for one
meal because we didn't bleed
him immediately and he tasted
like ammonia after one day."
Jaws revisited?
Possible shark appearances
worried the Wilcoxes, espe
cially when the time came to
scrape the barnacles off the
boat's hull. Linda, nowls, kept
a shark watch while the other
family members hung from the
side of the boat and did the
hated task.
"Wefound outthen just how
weak we had become," Wilcox
said. "We had to do a lot of
scraping near Panama and the
Galapagos Islands. The water is

just thick with barnacles in that
area."
The sea life slowed the boat
down tremendously, and the
Wilcoxes didn't have time to
spare on that leg of the jour
ney.
The boat, traveling about 100
miles a day, stopped at 34
countries. Wilcox liked Au
stralia for its solitude, while
Mrs. Wilcox preferred Malta
and the Holy Land area for its
"living history."
"I'd just finished reading the
entire Bible before we got to
the Holy Land so I could see all
the places I'd just read about,"
Mrs. Wilcox explained.
Reading was a favorite
pastime for the sailors. When
they'd finished the books they
had on board, they exchanged
them at the next port with
other travelers.
High seas loneliness
Although they met a lot of
people in the ports, the seas
were desolate.
"A boat just five miles away
can hardly be seen without a
telescope," explained Garth.
"And we didn't travel in the
steamer lanes so we saw very
few ships."
With radio equipment, the
family was able to stay in touch
with world news. They were
anchored off a small island
when word came in about
Richard Nixon's resignation.
"We'd just heard it on the
news when a native came run
ning to the boat telling us
about it," Wilcox said. "He was
more excited about it than we
were."
They even saw news in the
making, visiting with the King
of Tonga and catching a
glimpse of Prince Charles dur
ing his trip to the Fiji Islands.
"We also had some discus
sions with the South Africans.
They don't really feel they're
getting fair press in America,"
Wilcox said. "The situation
seems quite different over
there than newspapers here
are making it out to be."
The travelers were wel
comed by most countries.
They never stopped in Somalia

because rumor had it they, as
foreigners, would be impris
oned on sight. They were also
uneasy while sailing in the Red
Sea.
Home again
Now, after five years of
traveling, the family is having a
difficult time adjusting to the
permanence and convenience
of Palo Alto living.
The two children are now
teenagers. Garth, a freshman,
attends Foothill Junior College
and Linda just entered the
eleventh grade. Garth never
went to high school.
But, the family agrees, it's
Wilcox who changed the most.
He reentered his electronics
engineering job only to find
five years of rapid technologi
cal advancement glaring at
him. The eight-hour-a-day
pace is hard to maintain after
five years of slow and easy sail
ing days.
"It's hard to get back into the
routine," Wilcox admitted.
"But the main thing is that I
ddn't have any life goals any
more. Sure, I have to take care
of Dawn and the kids, but I
don't have any real goals for
myself anymore."

family members hung from the
side of the boat and did the
hated task.
"Wefound outthen just how
weak we had become," Wilcox
said. "We had to do a lot of
scraping near Panama and the
Galapagos Islands. The water is

just thick with barnacles in that
area."
The sea life slowed the boat
down tremendously, and the
Wilcoxes didn't have time to
spare on that leg of the jour
ney.
The boat, traveling about 100
miles a day, stopped at 34
countries. Wilcox liked Au
stralia for its solitude, while
Mrs. Wilcox preferred Malta
and the Holy Land area for its
"living history."
"I'd just finished reading the
entire Bible before we got to
the Holy Land so I could see all
the places I'd just read about,"
Mrs. Wilcox explained.
Reading was a favorite
pastime for the sailors. When
they'd finished the books they
had on board, they exchanged
them at the next port with
other travelers.
High seas loneliness
Although they met a lot of
people in the ports, the seas
were desolate.
"A boat just five miles away
can hardly be seen without a
telescope," explained Garth.
"And we didn't travel in the
steamer lanes so we saw very
few ships."
With radio equipment, the
family was able to stay in touch
with world news. They were
anchored off a small island
when word came in about
Richard Nixon's resignation.
"We'd just heard it on the
news when a native came run
ning to the boat telling us
about it," Wilcox said. "He was
more excited about it than we
were."
They even saw news in the
making, visiting with the King
of Tonga and catching a
glimpse of Prince Charles dur
ing his trip to the Fiji Islands.
"We also had some discus
sions with the South Africans.
They don't really feel they're
getting fair press in America,"
Wilcox said. "The situation
seems quite different over
there than newspapers here
are making it out to be."
The travelers were wel
comed by most countries.
They never stopped in Somalia

because rumor had it they, as
foreigners, would be impris
oned on sight. They were also
uneasy while sailing in the Red
Sea.
Home again
Now, after five years of
traveling, the family is having a
difficult time adjusting to the
permanence and convenience
of Palo Alto living.
The two children are now
teenagers. Garth, a freshman,
attends Foothill Junior College
and Linda just entered the
eleventh grade. Garth never
went to high school.
But, the family agrees, it's
Wilcox who changed the most.
He reentered his electronics
engineering job only to find
five years of rapid technologi
cal advancement glaring at
him. The eight-hour-a-day
pace is hard to maintain after
five years of slow and easy sail
ing days.
"It's hard to get back into the
routine," Wilcox admitted.
"But the main thing is that I
ddn't have any life goals any
more. Sure, I have to take care
of Dawn and the kids, but I
don't have any real goals for
myself anymore."
Few men can carry out their
dreams of a lifetime and even
fewer can feel satiated when
those dreams are filled. But for
a Palo Alto man and his family,
five years of planning and a life
of dreaming because a real and
satisfying adventure.
In August, 1973, Chuck Wil
cox, his wife Dawn and their
two children sailed out of San
Francisco Bay in a 40-foot
F.astport Maine Pinky, equip
ped with four forward bunks, a
galley and plenty of storage
space.
Last summer, the family re
turned to the Redwood City
Yacht Harbor, hungry and
tired, and happy.
"We'd miscalculated how
long it would take to get from
Panama back to California and
we had to ration food and wa
ter," Wilcox said, explaining
his family's underweight,
exhausted condition. "We
were glad we went, but as you
can imagine, after five years we
were glad to be back."
Shipwreck
The trip was not planned to
take five years. After one year
of sailing, the ship hit a reef in
the Fiji Islands and the family
was marooned there foralmost
a year, while the ship was re
paired.
"We really weren't in any
danger at the time of the
wreck, but we sure thought we
were," Wilcox said. "Every
time the tide came in, the boat
filled halfway with water. We
abandoned ship and walked on
the coral to the small island."
After staying one day on the
deserted island, the family was
found by a cruise boat touring
the area. They were picked up
and taken to Fiji, where they
stayed for the next 10 months.
"If you're going to be ship
wrecked anywhere, Fiji is a
nice place to be," Wilcox
laughed. "We could conve
niently, easily and fairly
cheaply get the boat fixed
there.;'
Mrs. Wilcox added that the
cost of living in Fiji was low.

She fed, clothed and housed
her family for about $20 a
week.
Funds for the trip had been
saved since 1968. Before
weighing anchor in 1973, the
family sold all the house fur
nishings and gave Wilcox's
father the power of "attorney
over the house and checking
account," Wilcox said.
"We found that traveler's
checks were liked around the
world except in the Arab coun
tries," Wilcox said. "There's
alscran extensive black market
on money, especially in Su
dan."
Although the Wilcoxes know
French and Spanish, they en
countered language difficul
ties in some areas, especially
where numerous tribes, each
with a different dialect, lived.
But no matter where they
ended up, every merchant
seemed to understand the En
glish words, "How much?"
Mrs. Wilcox laughed.
Stocking up
The family had to purchase
food at almost every port,
sometimes stocking up for
threemonthsatatime. Besides
living on canned foods and
fresh vegetables bought at port
markets, the family caught fish
on long trips.
On the trip from Panama to
California, the Wilcoxes' son
Garth, now 18, caught a small
shark in his net.
"He was docile," Garth said.
"He didn't struggle at all. But
we could only use him for one
meal because we didn't bleed
him immediately and he tasted
like ammonia after one day."
Jaws revisited?
Possible shark appearances
worried the Wilcoxes, espe
cially when the time came to
scrape the barnacles off the
boat's hull. Linda, nowls, kept
a shark watch while the other
family members hung from the
side of the boat and did the
hated task.

ped with four forward bunks, a
galley and plenty of storage
space.
Last summer, the family re
turned to the Redwood City
Yacht Harbor, hungry and
tired, and happy.
"We'd miscalculated how
long it would take to get from
Panama back to California and
we had to ration food and wa
ter," Wilcox said, explaining
his family's underweight,
exhausted condition. "We
were glad we went, but as you
can imagine, after five years we
were glad to be back."
Shipwreck
The trip was not planned to
take five years. After one year
of sailing, the ship hit a reef in
the Fiji Islands and the family
was marooned there foralmost
a year, while the ship was re
paired.
"We really weren't in any
danger at the time of the
wreck, but we sure thought we
were," Wilcox said. "Every
time the tide came in, the boat
filled halfway with water. We
abandoned ship and walked on
the coral to the small island."
After staying one day on the
deserted island, the family was
found by a cruise boat touring
the area. They were picked up
and taken to Fiji, where they
stayed for the next 10 months.
"If you're going to be ship
wrecked anywhere, Fiji is a
nice place to be," Wilcox
laughed. "We could conve
niently, easily and fairly
cheaply get the boat fixed
there.;'
Mrs. Wilcox added that the
cost of living in Fiji was low.

She fed, clothed and housed
her family for about $20 a
week.
Funds for the trip had been
saved since 1968. Before
weighing anchor in 1973, the
family sold all the house fur
nishings and gave Wilcox's
father the power of "attorney
over the house and checking
account," Wilcox said.
"We found that traveler's
checks were liked around the
world except in the Arab coun
tries," Wilcox said. "There's
alscran extensive black market
on money, especially in Su
dan."
Although the Wilcoxes know
French and Spanish, they en
countered language difficul
ties in some areas, especially
where numerous tribes, each
with a different dialect, lived.
But no matter where they
ended up, every merchant
seemed to understand the En
glish words, "How much?"
Mrs. Wilcox laughed.
Stocking up
The family had to purchase
food at almost every port,
sometimes stocking up for
threemonthsatatime. Besides
living on canned foods and
fresh vegetables bought at port
markets, the family caught fish
on long trips.
On the trip from Panama to
California, the Wilcoxes' son
Garth, now 18, caught a small
shark in his net.
"He was docile," Garth said.
"He didn't struggle at all. But
we could only use him for one
meal because we didn't bleed
him immediately and he tasted
like ammonia after one day."
Jaws revisited?
Possible shark appearances
worried the Wilcoxes, espe
cially when the time came to
scrape the barnacles off the
boat's hull. Linda, nowls, kept
a shark watch while the other
family members hung from the
side of the boat and did the
hated task.
"Wefound outthen just how
weak we had become," Wilcox
said. "We had to do a lot of
scraping near Panama and the
Galapagos Islands. The water is

just thick with barnacles in that
area."
The sea life slowed the boat
down tremendously, and the
Wilcoxes didn't have time to
spare on that leg of the jour
ney.
The boat, traveling about 100
miles a day, stopped at 34
countries. Wilcox liked Au
stralia for its solitude, while
Mrs. Wilcox preferred Malta
and the Holy Land area for its
"living history."
"I'd just finished reading the
entire Bible before we got to
the Holy Land so I could see all
the places I'd just read about,"
Mrs. Wilcox explained.
Reading was a favorite
pastime for the sailors. When
they'd finished the books they
had on board, they exchanged
them at the next port with
other travelers.
High seas loneliness
Although they met a lot of
people in the ports, the seas
were desolate.
"A boat just five miles away
can hardly be seen without a
telescope," explained Garth.
"And we didn't travel in the
steamer lanes so we saw very
few ships."
With radio equipment, the
family was able to stay in touch
with world news. They were
anchored off a small island
when word came in about
Richard Nixon's resignation.
"We'd just heard it on the
news when a native came run
ning to the boat telling us
about it," Wilcox said. "He was
more excited about it than we
were."
They even saw news in the
making, visiting with the King
of Tonga and catching a
glimpse of Prince Charles dur
ing his trip to the Fiji Islands.
"We also had some discus
sions with the South Africans.
They don't really feel they're
getting fair press in America,"
Wilcox said. "The situation
seems quite different over
there than newspapers here
are making it out to be."
The travelers were wel
comed by most countries.
They never stopped in Somalia

because rumor had it they, as
foreigners, would be impris
oned on sight. They were also
uneasy while sailing in the Red
Sea.
Home again
Now, after five years of
traveling, the family is having a
difficult time adjusting to the
permanence and convenience
of Palo Alto living.
The two children are now
teenagers. Garth, a freshman,
attends Foothill Junior College
and Linda just entered the
eleventh grade. Garth never
went to high school.
But, the family agrees, it's
Wilcox who changed the most.
He reentered his electronics
engineering job only to find
five years of rapid technologi
cal advancement glaring at
him. The eight-hour-a-day
pace is hard to maintain after
five years of slow and easy sail
ing days.
"It's hard to get back into the
routine," Wilcox admitted.
"But the main thing is that I
ddn't have any life goals any
more. Sure, I have to take care
of Dawn and the kids, but I
don't have any real goals for
myself anymore."
Few men can carry out their
dreams of a lifetime and even
fewer can feel satiated when
those dreams are filled. But for
a Palo Alto man and his family,
five years of planning and a life
of dreaming because a real and
satisfying adventure.
In August, 1973, Chuck Wil
cox, his wife Dawn and their
two children sailed out of San
Francisco Bay in a 40-foot
F.astport Maine Pinky, equip
ped with four forward bunks, a
galley and plenty of storage
space.
