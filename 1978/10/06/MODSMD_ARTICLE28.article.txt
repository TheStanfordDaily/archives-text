# Diverse pope sought by cardinals
## 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — At the
Vatican this coming week, they
get down to the solemn busi
ness of finding the right man to
carry on what the Encyclopedia
Britannica calls the world's
oldest continuing institution:
the papacy.
The job description calls for
an administrator, a com
municator, a linguist, a
motivator, a theologian who is
preferably a canon (lawyer), a
financier, a teacher, a discreet
politician and an able public re
lations practitioner.
Some of the qualifications
would be needed in any top
executive job, but this is not
anything like finding a new
chairman for the Ford Motor
Co.

Ford, a younger institution
by nearly two millenia, doesn't
worry about tradition as much
as the Roman Catholic Church,
whose goals are eternal and
whose prospective clients em
brace all civilization, making
them difficult to program into a
computer.
" Ford could get executive re
cruiters — headhunters,
they're called — to do the look
ing, instead of cardinals.
Even before the conclave
begins Saturday, Oct. 14, the
cardinal recruiters will be look
ing among themselves for a
man of learning, of wit, eloqu
ence, tact, charm and — some
thing not usually sought in in
dustry — piety.
In principle, any male —
even a married one willing to
put his wife in a convent — is
eligible for the post first held
by St. Peter 263 popes ago and
most recently by John Paul I,
who died in his bed only 34
days after his surprise election
as the church's top executive.

In practice — a practice
going back 600 years to Pope
Urban VI — only cardinals, the
princes of the church who do
the electing in secret sessions,
are likely prospects — prefera
bly Italian cardinals.
The last non-Italian to oc
cupy the chair of Peter was
Pope Adrian VI, born Adrian
Florenz in Utrecht, Holland.
Roman mobs hailed his elec
tion by stoning the cardinal
electors after the conclave in
1522.
The right man must not be
too young, since tradition dic
tates wariness toward a papacy
that might last a quarter of a
century. Cardinal Jaime Sin of
Singapore, just 50, is the
youngest elector.
The candidate sought must
not be too old either — John
Paul's fatal heart attack at 65
undoubtedly wiil be a factor
this time in weighing the
"papabili," the papal pos
sibilities, although the average
age of the cardinals eligible to

vote is just a bit over 66.
Pope Paul VI, who died Aug.
6 after a 15-year reign, revised
the 1000-year-old papal elec
tion process to exclude cardi
nals who have passed their
80th birthdayfrom entering the
conclave.
"Health is always a consider
ation," New York's Cardinal
Terence Cooke admitted as he
arrived for his second conclave
in two months, echoing a now
current theme that was not
even discussed with reporters
the last time.
Yet, unlike other big organi
zations, this most pervasive of
all multinationals, dealing with
700 million members in 146
countries, does not insist on a
thorough physical for its top
management prospects or re
quire an annual checkup after
their selection.
In this unique high-rise
world of steeples and cam
panile, there is room at the top
for both a traditionalist and an
innovator.
However, he must not come
on too strong in the beginning,
anyway as a radical reformer or
a hidebound reactionary, since
the Catholic Church in the past
15 years has been heavily buf
feted by the cyclonic winds of
change emanating from the re
forms of Vatican Council 11,
which John XXIII inaugurated
and Paul VI had to carry out.
Ford's River Rouge plant
could easily swallow up the
108-acre Vatican City State and
its 1000-resident population.
Yet the man the recruiters seek
must have a wide knowledge of
the world, without appearing
worldly.
In a job where the pope is
considered infallible in matters
of doctrine, his credibility in
temporal affairs must go
beyond the image Madison
Avenue seeks to create for
other corporate heads.
Pope John Paul I served only
34 days in office, two days
longer than the man who had
the briefest American presi
dency, the almost forgotten
William Henry Harrison, who
died April 4, 1841, from a chill
he caught riding a horse in his
inaugural parade.
Yet John Paul's influence on
the conclave beginning Oct. 14
will be, in Cooke's word, "per
vasive."
The last time the cardinals
met, the pre-election favorites
were all cardinals with long
management experience in the
Curia, the church's central
bureaucracy. But the electors
passed these in favor of Albino
Luciani, the patriarch of Ven
ice, who had no Curia experi
enceand none in the papal dip
lomatic corps when he became
John Paul I.
