# Land value here unknown

The University campus of over 8100 acres
makes it one of the largest private universities in
the United States and an important landowner
in the Bay Area. The undeveloped foothill lands
and open space of the inner campus make the
University look like a veritable island in a sea of
suburbia.
Though the mass is undoubtedly a large one,
however, the actual worth of the lands has never
been figured, according to John Breedlove,
manager ot land resources here.
"The exact value has not been figured be
cause the University has no immediate intention
of development. Therefore we have no real
need to know," Breedlove said.
Nevertheless, the University is making money
on its property. Though the founding grant pre
vents the sale or trade of any of the University's
original lands, leasing is permitted. In past
years, land leased for housing, professional and
office centers, the Stanford Shopping Center
and the industrial park brought in 20 percent of
the University's return on investments, Breed
love said.
When, in the '50s, the University sought to
enlarge the size of the student body here, use of
the lands was seen as "an excellent source of
revenue to provide for the expansion," Breed
love said. Both the industrial park and shopping
center here, occupying 665 acres jointly,
opened on land leased from,the University.
But the University's land use policy statement
for 1973 states that little more undeveloped land
will be leased for commercial purposes in the
future.
Of an 8129 acre land count, close to 5900 acres
have been placed in the "academic reserve, land
in academic use or land held for future academic
use," Breedlove said. This reserve includes an
1100 acre inner campus located between Footh
ill Expressway and El Camino.
Instead of seeking industrial or commercial

users for its property, the University seeks to
attract more educational research projects, like
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
"A large research faculty, proximity to high
technology industries in the surrounding areas
and large expanses of open and undeveloped
land make Stanford a prime site. Such projects
as SLAC bring in specialists, grant money and
prestige," Breedlove said.
But the University's decision to encourage re
search on its property is an expensive one. In its
present tax status, most of the lands are taxed at
the same rate as surrounding suburban lands.
If the University placed the undeveloped
property in a "land bank" in which its use would
be limited to agriculture, property would be
taxed at a lower rate. Thousands of dollars
would be saved, according to Breedlove.
Tax rates for fiscal year 1978-79 have not been
figured yet. "Jarvis-Gann is making the issue of
taxes a difficult one," Zera Coleman, assistant to
the manager for real estate here, said.
In a land bank, property is taxed on the basis
of annual earnings from its use, not on the basis
of potential value.
The University leases some of its land for graz
ing, but only about $37,000 in rental land re
ceipts are returned annually.
Placing land in the land bank is a "cumber
some and bureaucratic procedure. Withdraw
ing the land is often difficult," Breedlove said.
"Putting the land in a land bank requires that
you keep the land there for a number of years.
When you're running an academic institution,
you just aren't free to do that," Coleman said.
Presently, the only major land development is
the possible addition of several hundred homes
to the faculty housing area.
The shopping center, office and industrial
parks and professional centers will not be en
larged, according to Breedlove. Hence, the face
of University lands in 10 years should bear some
resemblance to that of today.
