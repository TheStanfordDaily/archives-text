						new show in L.A. as Cards open Pac-10

### IVAN MAISEL 
Remember last year's
Stanford-UCLA game? The
come-from-behind victory by
the Cardiac Cards, 32-28?
James Lofton's steal of a Steve
Dils pass with 37 seconds left?
The 552 yards of Stanford of
fense, the 408 yards the Bruins
churned out? Keep a mental
picture of it, because tomor
row night's game will be no
thing like it.
Many things can happen in
the football world in one year.
(Witness the fall of Notre Dame
from the football powers.)
Nowhere is that fact more ap
parent than in tomorrow
night's matchup between the
17th-ranked Cardinals and the

16th-ranked Bruins. The explo
sive Veer offense of the Bruins
has been traded in for the
power of the l-formation. So
far, the results have been less
than encouraging.
UCLA head coach Terry
Donahue said that he is puz
zled by the ineptitude of the
Raiin offense They have aver
aged only 281.5 yards, and
scored but 16 points a game.
Their lack of offensive punch
is quite a change from a year
ago. Stanford coach Bill Walsh
is hoping for the Bruins' poor
showing to continue.
"We're hoping for the same
results from their offense —
that they are only marginally ef
fective," Walsh said. "How

ever, they have great speed
and talent. As long as they have
those assets in the game they
can beat you. Last year, we
were containing them, and
boom!"
The engineers of that
"boom!" are back for another
shot. Halfback Theotis Brown
winged it 75 yards for a
touchdown in the first half
against the Cards last year, and
has been one of the few bright
spots for UCLA this season.
Brown leads the team in rush
ing with 373 yards.
In addition, sophomore
Freeman McNeil, who ran 78
yards for a score at Stanford
Stadium last year, is back.
The two big question marks

in the Bruin offense are the two
men who were the main
reasons for the switch to the
l-formation: junior quarter
back Rick Bashore and senior
halfback James Owens.
Owens has been particularly
puzzling. He has run for only
198 yards in four games, an av
erage ui 49.5 per game. His
longest run has been 19 yards,
and he has yet to score.
Bashore has not been the
leader the Bruins expected. His
statistics are mediocre (25-47-2,
300 yards), and backup signal
caller Steve Bukich has not
been effective either.
Mention defense, and the
UCLA Bruins snap to attention.
The Bruins have given up only

38 points all season, and only
three in the second half. Only
one touchdown was scored as
a result of a drive of more than
32 yards.
The defense has been
equally stingy in giving up yar
dage, yielding an average of
but 238 yards per game.
ihey do have outstanding
defensive personnel," con
ceded Walsh. The one thing
the Cards do have in their ad
vantage is that the Bruins have
yet to face a real pass-oriented
offense, and Walsh is the first
to realize that.
"Our style of football could
be troublesome to their de
fense," Walsh said.
Leading the Bruin defense is
senior All-America linebacker
Jerry Robinson. Robinson was
out earlier in the season with
an ankle injury, but came back
last week against Minnesota
and played well enough (20
tackles) to earn recognition
from Sports Illustrated as De
fensive Player of the Week.
Anchoring the defensive line
for the Bruins is senior nose
guard Manu Tuiasosopo. Be
sides leading the nation in syll
ables, Tuiasosopo is the team
leader in tackles with 53, in
cluding three sacks.
Stanford enters the Col
iseum after a tough come
from-behind victory over
Tulane, 17-14.
"We played with a lot of de
termination and poise last
week," Walsh said. "Our
players will not give up."
The defense shown in last
week's scorching sun had two
goal line stands in the first half
and a complete shutdown of
the Tulane offense in the sec
ond.
"Our defense is markedly
improved over a year ago,"
Walsh said, "although how
much I don't know."
Stanford leads the Pacific-10
in offense with an average of
417.3 yards per game.
"We haven't been able to get
the big score yet. The most we
have scored since I've been
here is 38 (against San Jose
State this year)," Walsh said.
He added that he believes it is a
problem of depth.
"Our second team just
hasn't done the job — we don't
have the depth of an
Alabama."
Walsh doesn't expect to
break the scoring record this
week. Both he and Donahue
predict a low-scoring battle.
"Twenty-four points should
win it," Walsh said.
"A loss in this game will have
no lasting effect (on the Pac-10
race)," Walsh said. "I don't
think one loss will eliminate
anyone this early in the sea
son."
One loss for UCLA this early
would hurt them as much as it
would help Stanford. With
Washington next on the Pac-10
menu, Stanford needs all the
help it can get.

Ken Naber (10) drills a 41 -yard field goal out of the hold of Stanford
quarterback Steve Dils to put the Cards on top of Tulane 3-0 in the
first quarter last Saturday. The Cards won 17-14, Naber's three
pointer being difference. The sophomore place kicker is five of
seven on field goal attempts this season and has not missed from 48
yards and in.
