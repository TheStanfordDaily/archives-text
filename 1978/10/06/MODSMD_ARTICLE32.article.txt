# Hargadon picks some more losers
## 
### 
Ask any Stanford undergradute and
he or she will tell you that Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions Fred Hargadon
can really pick winners.
What do undergraduates know?
The Daily, in its most magnanimous
gesture in hours, has invited Dean Fred
back for another shot at our weekly
football forecasts. The University's No.
1 picks man, Hargadon was an abysmal
2-3 last year.
In a mad stab for redemption, here
are Hargadon's choices:
"Egad! It never fails. The Daily has
once again sold more advertising than it
had expected and it now feels obliged to
reach out for professional assistance.
Being of an eleemosynary (hey, where's
the dictionary?) nature, I feel obliged to
oblige.
"I like predicting. I do it all the time. I
am good at it. My predictions do not
always work out, obviously. Look
around you. But it is not my predictions
which are not sound. It is simply the
failure of others to live up to those pre
dictions. As with people, so with teams.
"What I am about to tell you then is
how things should turn out Saturday if
everyone will simply do what they're
supposed to do. Like me, you will be
able to tell whether they did or not by
Sunday.
"Let's start with Oregon State at Min
nesota. I would not buy a ticket to that
game, but since they're going to play it
anyway, I will pick the Gophers by a
score of 20-7. If California has gotten the
coal dust out of its ears, and Roger

Theder calls the plays, I think the Bears
should handily beat Oregon. In fact, if
they get a chance, they'll probably run
the score up. The score should be 35-7.
"Alabama will look silly with all of
those air conditioners behind the
Tide benches at Seattle. Whatever, the
Bear is chagrined (I heard he replaced
the color TVs with black-and-white sets
in the athletic dormitory after the USC
game) and I think they'll frost the Hus
kies 30-10. Northwestern is still trying to
figure out how (and why) Arizona State
got on its schedule. Arizona State
knows why. One of the Pac-10's newest
by a score of 28-0.
"Why is Arizona playing Michigan? Its
share of the gate receipts, of course.
They will earn whatever they get by
being shellacked in front of a hundred
thousand (plus a banc' of thousands)
fans, 44-7.
"Southern Cal will not win this week.
Neither will Washington State. Neither
will either of them lose.
"You're wondering about Stanford-
UCLA by now, aren't you? So am I. But I
do not venture into Southern California
except in disguise and with the most
compelling of reasons. But I will be
there. Obviously I can't give my dis
guise away, but the compelling reason
is the prospect of a repeat of last year's
Stanford victory. We play well under the
lights. We're healthy. We're ready.
After 60 minutes of exciting football, the
Cards on top by a score of 24-21.
"Now if everyone will just live up to
my predictions."
