The women's cross-country
team runs in Berkeley tomor
row, while the men host Hum
boldt State in a dual event here
at the Stanford Golf Course.
The women, who finished
fifth last week in the Fresno In
vitational, take on some of the
tougher schools on the West
Coast. The teams competing in
tomorrow's race include Ore
gon, Oregon State,
Washington, UCLA and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, which all
placed in lastyear's nationals in
Georgetown, Texas. In addi
tion, the Cal runners are ex
tremely strong this year.
The young Cards are paced
by two-time All-American Ann
Thrupp, who finished a solid
17th in last week's three-mile
race. Also running for the
Cards are senior Therese
Lamb, sophomores Annette
Mungi and Joanne Ernst, and
freshmen Beth Harrison, Caro
lyn Layzer, Kyle Chapman and
Karin Pascoe.

The men should have an
easier time against Humboldt
State. However, coach Dean
Clark said the 10,000-meter run
could turn out to be a "very
good meet." Humboldt, with
excellent talent in past years,
runs in a similar style to Stan
ford, which could make for an
interesting match-up.
Seven Card men will be run
ning in tomorrow's event, led
by senior Roy Kissin. Those
running, in addition to Kissin,
are freshman Rod Berry and
sophomore Tom Lobsinger —
both of whom, said Clark, are
running "very well" — and
senior Jerry Emory, junior
Craig Corey, freshman Scott
Slovic and senior Mitch Was
terlain, who seems to have re
covered from last week's
scorcher in Fresno. Wasterlain
was forced to drop out due to
heat exhaustion.
The meet begins at 10 a.m.,
and should prove entertaining
for those not going to the
UCLA-Stanford football game.
