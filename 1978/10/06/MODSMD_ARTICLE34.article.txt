# Cards battle hockey power
## 
### JULIE HILL 
San Jose State's field hockey team heads up
the Santa Clara Valley with its wagon load of
credentials tomorrow to play Stanford at 10 a.m.
on Roble Field.
The undefeated Spartans, 5-1 on the season,
are the top team in AIAW Region 8. San Jose
finished last season ranked No. 4 in the nation.
The Spartans are led by 25-year-old Pommey
McFarland, a player Stanford coach Barbara
Longstreth said gives San Jose "a pro player
coming in."
Amanda Read, captain of the Cardinals, said,
"We're definitely preparing for San Jose and
their strengths. I think that this is one of those
games that no one has trouble getting psyched
for."
Concerning last weekend's disappointing
performance, when Stanford lost one and tied
two in Southern California, Amanda added,
"We're trying to work out problems we had at
Cal Poly-Pomona. I have the utmost confidence
in our personnel; and we can pull it together."
Due to San Jose's high placement at nationals
last season, two teams will represent Region 8

this year at nationals. If Stanford repeats last
season's second-place regional showing, the
Cards will end up competing in the nationals at
Ellensberg, Wash.
Longstreth, although she entered Stanford's
program as coach only last year, noted that the
other Region 8 teams are fast increasing in talent
and competitiveness. She also said University
support for active recruiting is "a definite
part of field hockey now." She feels the J.V.
team is "a great asset to the maintenance of
top-level competition."
One common misconception regarding field
hockey is that the sport is physically rough. The
obstruction rule, which states that the player
with the ball must not come between the ball
and the opponent, prevents legally harsh play.
In fact, the entire atmosphere of the game of
field hockey is one of good will.
There will be a lot of goodwill flowing if Stan
ford knocks off San )ose.
"If we beat San Jose State, it'll be considered
an upset," Longstreth said. "But our team has
confidence that it can win."
