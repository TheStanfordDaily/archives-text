# Sophomore linebacker shows promise
## Budinger completes strong duo 
### ROBERT REED 
Gordy Ceresino! Gordy
Ceresino!
Whenever people speak of
the Stanford defense, the con
versation both begins and ends
vviih the name, Gordy Cere
sino. People rant and rave for
hours about the brilliant ac
complishments of Stanford's
middle linebacker, Gordy
Ceresino.
And while one would be a
fool to suggest that Ceresino
hasn't deserved all the atten
tion he's received, it must be
remembered that in the Cards'
new 3-4 defense, there are two
middle, or more correctly,
there are two inside linebac
kers. And that other Stanford
inside linebacker is damn
good. His name is Steve
Budinger.
Budinger's name has been
hard to recognize because,
though he has moved into a
starting spot next to Ceresino
this season, he spent most of
last year lurking in the shadows
of the Cardinal bench behind
Ceresino. The only bright spot
for Budinger in the 1977 cam
paign came when he took over
early in the Cal game for the
injured Ceresino and led the
Cardinal defense in shutting
off the Bears' attack in a 21-3
victory.
This year Budinger has
moved out of the shadows and
has played brilliantly. So far
this season, Budinger, or
"Bud," as some of his friends
call him, has been in on 44 tack
les, while picking off one inter
ception and grabbing a fumble
recovery. His play has helped
solidify a Cardinal defense that
until the late stages of last
year's campaign was porous at
best.
Budinger has proven himself
worthy of his starting role, and
coach Bill Walsh has lavished
heavy praise upon Budinger by
saying "I expect him
(Budinger) to have a career that
closely parallels Ceresino's
. . ." High praise fora man who
spent last season planted on
the Cardinal bench. But let's
remember why he was there.
Gordy Ceresino.
"Steve's a good linebacker,"
said Ceresino, who at first had
problems adjusting to the 3-4
defense, but explained that
now he's gotten the hang of it
and that Budinger's play has
made things easier for him.
"If both of us have good
games, there's just no penetra
tion in the middle." There
hasn't been much penetration,
and the Cards have been win
ning. But even so, what does
Ceresino think of No. 62, Steve
Budinger? "Steve's a great
guy," Ceresino said. "Never
bitches . . . He's got the mak
ings of a great football player.
And I have a lot of respect for
him." So does Budinger's
coach, Norb Hecker.
"Steve's got a lot of charac
ter," said Hecker, assistant
coach in charge of linebackers.
Hecker talked more readily,
however, about Budinger's
abilities as a football player.
"He's got good quickness,
good football instincts. He's
strong and tough . . . He's got

all the tools to be a real fine
linebacker."
But can he be as good as
Ceresino? "That's not fair to
say," Hecker said. "I don't like
to compare. . . He can be an
outstanding linebacker. He
can be as good as Budinger."
For most people's money,
that would be good enough.
But not for Budinger's. Hecker
explained that because of his
lack of experience, Budinger
doesn't seem to be sure that he
is good enough.
"Steve lacks a little bit of
confidence," Hecker said.
"He's not sure he can do it, but
he can. . ." Yes, he can and he
does. But what is there to this
6-foot-2 215-pound sopho
more linebacker who's not
quite sure of his abilitiies? Who
is he? What is he?
"Well, I'm not the typical
image (of a football player) that
people tend to have. . ~" said
Budinger, who destroys the
myths and misconceptions that
most people hold about foot
ball players in general and
linebackers in particular.
Budinger, though a powerfully
built figure, doesn't go around
crushing beer cans against his
forehead and biting bark off of
trees. Budinger is instead a
quiet, personable individual
who makes friends easily de
spite the fact that he likes his
privacy.
"I kind of like to be by my
self," Budinger said. "I'm not
antisocial, but I enjoy my pri
vacy." The former prep eager
and trackster is a versatile
human being who enjoys"play
ing guitar, swimming and lis
tening to all types of music. A
practical joker of sorts,

Budinger said he sometimes
finds it hard when people re
fuse to take him seriously. The
easygoing 19-year-old from
Tucson, Ariz., also said that at
times the competitiveness ot
football begins to wear him
down, so, "to get my mind off
of football, I like to play sports
where there's not that much
emphasis on winning. Like
frisbee or pinball or pool."
"At first, I kinda felt some
pressure ... I tried to be more
intense," said Budinger, com
menting on his reaction to the
news of the defensive change
last spring. With the pivotal
change, Budinger's name
moved alongside Ceresino's
on the roster, but not in the
press clippings. So how does
Budinger feel about being the
other inside linebacker?
"Well, it's a lot better than
playing behind Ceresino like I
did last year," Budinger said.
"I'm learning a lot playing be
side Gordy."
Who wouldn't? Still, isn't it
tough listening to people go on
and on about the achieve
ments of Gordy Ceresino?
"Not at all. I think he's de
served every honor he's re
ceived. And I'm only a sopho
more, so I can't expect to get
that much recognition right
now."
But he has been recognized
and he has proven himself. So
now might be the time to start
setting some goals. When
questioned about this,
Budinger replied. "Well, I ha
ven't set any statistical goals, so
to speak. I just want to refine
my techniques at linebacker
. . . I want to improve my con
sistency."

Consistency will come with
experience, Budinger will have
time to improve, to be as good
as he wants, maybe as good as
Ceresino. "With a lot of prac
tice, and it I dedicate myself to
the game, I can probably
achieve the same level of play
at which Ceresino is playing
right now." Maybe so. In time.
But right now, Budinger is
content in just quietly doing
his job, working together with
Ceresino to make the Cardinal
middle a no man's land for op
posing running backs and re
ceivers.
And while Ceresino, being
Gordy Ceresino, might still cast
a bit of his shadow on
Budinger, there can be no
rivalry between the two, for, as
Ceresino said, "When you
have two guys playing virtually
the same position, you've got
to work as one." And this,
Ceresino and Budinger, do
well.
