# Cards top SFS; hooters now 6-1
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
After last week's victory over
Stanislaus State, Stanford head
soccer coach Nelson Lodge
predicted Wednesday's match
would be a 1-0 struggle. How
ever, neither San Francisco
State nor the Cardinals were
content with a defensive game
— it was the offense which
stole the limelight again in
Stanford's 5-3 win over the
Gators.
Seemingly as much a tradi
tion as the Cards' second-half
surges, the Dan McNevin-Ted
Rafalovich combination ac
counted for four of Stanford's
five goals.
McNevin put a penalty kick
in the net with seven minutes
elapsed in the first half. The
Cators, not willing to take sec
ond seat in the fireworks,
countered with a goal five mi
nutes later by Nakul Reddy, as
sisted by Tom Harvey. San
Francisco then took the lead
for the only time in the game,
again with a shot from Reddy.
With six minutes remaining
in the period, Rafalovich took a
pass from McNevin and scored
to tie the game. He didn't cool
off during the halftime, getting
an unassisted goal 13 minutes
into the period. Jon Hecht,
with a McNevin assist, in
creased Stanford's lead by
scoring four minutes later.

The Catnrs stayed in the
game with another tally by
Reddy for his hat trick, assisted
this time by Michael Graham. A
final penalty kick by McNevin
put the game out of reach
That was the offensive story,
but what about the defense?
Lodge commented, "The only
thing that bothers me is that we
get scored on. Luckily our of
fense is generating enough
goals so we don't lose games
. . . as a coach this has me a
little concerned because when
it comes to UCLA and teams
like that we can't get scored on
— we have to do the scoring,
we have to hold off."
Regarding shortcomings, as
sistant coach Phil Wright re
plied, "It's a little bit of over
confidence, a little because
they're eager to get up into of
fense, eager to press."
McNevin attributed the
weak defense to the newly im
plemented style of play where
the wings have to cover for the
attacking midfielder. "We're
dealing with a new kind of of
fense that calls for me to play
up. In the second half they only
scored one goal because our
wings were really dropping
back. It gets stronger and
stronger all the time," he said.

record travels to Fresno State

Stanford fullback Greg Delgado battles for the ball with a San Francisco State player during the Cards'
5-3 win over the Gators Wednesday. Tomorrow, the Cardinals, 6-1, travel to Fresno State.
After last week's victory over
Stanislaus State, Stanford head
soccer coach Nelson Lodge
predicted Wednesday's match
would be a 1-0 struggle. How
ever, neither San Francisco
State nor the Cardinals were
content with a defensive game
— it was the offense which
stole the limelight again in
Stanford's 5-3 win over the
Gators.
Seemingly as much a tradi
tion as the Cards' second-half
surges, the Dan McNevin-Ted
Rafalovich combination ac
counted for four of Stanford's
five goals.
McNevin put a penalty kick
in the net with seven minutes
elapsed in the first half. The
Cators, not willing to take sec
ond seat in the fireworks,
countered with a goal five mi
nutes later by Nakul Reddy, as
sisted by Tom Harvey. San
Francisco then took the lead
for the only time in the game,
again with a shot from Reddy.
With six minutes remaining
in the period, Rafalovich took a
pass from McNevin and scored
to tie the game. He didn't cool
off during the halftime, getting
an unassisted goal 13 minutes
into the period. Jon Hecht,
with a McNevin assist, in
creased Stanford's lead by
scoring four minutes later.

The Catnrs stayed in the
game with another tally by
Reddy for his hat trick, assisted
this time by Michael Graham. A
final penalty kick by McNevin
put the game out of reach
That was the offensive story,
but what about the defense?
Lodge commented, "The only
thing that bothers me is that we
get scored on. Luckily our of
fense is generating enough
goals so we don't lose games
. . . as a coach this has me a
little concerned because when
it comes to UCLA and teams
like that we can't get scored on
— we have to do the scoring,
we have to hold off."
Regarding shortcomings, as
sistant coach Phil Wright re
plied, "It's a little bit of over
confidence, a little because
they're eager to get up into of
fense, eager to press."
McNevin attributed the
weak defense to the newly im
plemented style of play where
the wings have to cover for the
attacking midfielder. "We're
dealing with a new kind of of
fense that calls for me to play
up. In the second half they only
scored one goal because our
wings were really dropping
back. It gets stronger and
stronger all the time," he said.
Stanford, now sporting a 6-1
record travels to Fresno State
tomorrow for a 2 p.m. game.
