This isn't the place you'd take the girl of
your dreams. You wouldn't even take the pro
fessor who was giving you the B-plus, but you
would take your parents if you couldn't go to
the City and yet wanted to treat them well.
Five minutes away from campus in
downtown Menlo Park, Dal Baffo Restaurant
hosts a semi-casual atmosphere with excel
lent food. The less than sophisticated decor is
misleading and a poor reflection of the quality
and elegance of the food and service.
The menu offers an impressive selection of
Italian and continental recipes. Appetizers
range from Fresh Melon with Prosciutto
($3.95) to Scampi Bordelaise ($4.45). The
Caponata Siciliana ($2.45), an exquisite cold
vegetable hors d'oeuvre made with eggplant,
olive oil and sweet basil, is appropriately chil
led and served with crusty French bread. The
Cima Genovese ($3.25) is an imaginatively
dressed pate incorporating chicken, egg and
ham. Though this delicacy is over-seasoned, it
merits only praise from the Dal Baffo patrons.
Soups, salads and pasta are also listed a la
carte. The Stracciatella Romana ($1), some
times called Consomme Marsala in southern
Italy, is a hearty chicken stock with thin
lengths of egg and grated Romano cheese. A
different texture and a pleasant taste make
this a nice change from the standard onion or
minestrone preparations. Spaghetti Carbo
nara ($4.50) and Fettucine Alfredo ($4.50) are
included among a half-dozen pasta dishes.
Entrees are organized into fish, rotisserie

and house specialties. With 14 items in each
category, diners are given a large choice.
Coquille St. Jacques ($8.45), Chicken Par
migiana ($7.45), Veal Marsala ($8.75) and Sir
loin Steak Diana ($10.45) name only a few of
the more traditional European recipes.
The Salmon Marinara ($8.50), and the Veal
Piccata ($8.25) stand out as masterful crea
tions. The first dish combines freshly poached
salmon with a blend of tomatoes, onions and
baby shrimp and the Piccata consists of thinly
sliced milk-fed veal sauteed in capers, lemon
and butter.
A Mirassou Johannesberg Reisling ($7 a bot
tle) or any other light dry white dinner wine
compliments both dishes well. Portions are
ample and each entree is served with a color
ful presentation of lightly sauteed shredded
zucchini and stuffed manicotti shells. Other
vegetables such as Artichoke Bottoms
Gratines ($2.20) and Saute Mushrooms ($1.50)
are available separately.
Homemade Spumoni ($1.50), flaming cre
pes and a rich Zabaglione ($6.50 for two)
round out the menu and the meal. An Italian
favorite, the zabaglione is a foamy wine cus
tard made with three egg whites, a little sugar
and a Marsala-like liqueur.
The service at Dal Baffo is professional.
Waiters are attentive without being obtrusive
and helpful without being patronizing.
With everything a la carte the tab can rise
quickly, perhaps a bill of $30-35 for two. Dal
Baffo isn't the place for every occasion; but if
you want elegant food in slightly casual sur
roundings and only have an hour or two to
spend, then Dal Baffo couldn't be more ap
propriate.
