# Poloists go south face USC, UCLA

"This will be the toughest
road trip of the year," said
Stanford water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti, referring to
this weekend's contests
against USC and UCLA in
Southern California.
"It is also the most important
because they are both league
games," he added. "If we win
two down there, it gives us a
very good chance for a berth in
the nationals."
The Cards will face the Tro
jans this afternoon in the Col
iseum pool, then move to
Westwood tomorrow morning
for a match with the Bruins at
the Rec Center on the UCLA
campus.
USC is currently ranked third
in the nation, Dettamanti said,

and recently beat California
in the Irvine tournament. The
last time the Cards and the Tro
jans battled, also in the Irvine
tournament, the Cards
sneaked out with a 6-5 victory.
"(The Trojans) are the most
improved team in the country
this year," said Dettamanti. "I
expect a real tough game. They
have an excellent goalie — Jack
Graham — who was the top
high school goalie in the nation
last year.
While Dettamanti said that
UCLA is a "very young" team,
made up primarily of freshmen
and sophomores, he stressed
that "we can't afford to over
look anybody in our league.
With league games, every one
is important."
