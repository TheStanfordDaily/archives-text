## 
### 
A Philadelphia doctor received his
second heart transplant in 2% years
at the Stanford Hospital this Tuesday
and is recovering there this week.
Dr. Jerome Young, who has his re
sidence in Cherry Hill, N.J., but prac
tices medicine in Philadelphia, re
ceived his first transplant herein May
1976. Problems developed with his
new heart that made it necessary for

him to have a second transplant,
however.
Second transplants at the Hospital
are not unheard of. There have been
nine since 1968, according to a Hos
pital spokesman.
The surgery itself was done in a
five-hour operation two days ago and
was conducted in basically the same
way that first transplants are done.
According to the Palo Alto Times,

Young's problems began with a heart
attack three years ago. After the first
transplant, Young had gotten back
into good physical shape again and
remained on a strict diet.
Young overcame initial rejection
of the first heart, but it later began to
degenerate as his original one had.
The reason for the degeneration is
unknown, but brought Young back
here for a second try.
