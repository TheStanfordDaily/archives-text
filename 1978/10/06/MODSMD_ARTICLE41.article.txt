Gamble. I didandcameoutawinner. An
ad for St. Pierre, "un restaurant francais,"
caught my attention. The graphics were
sophisticated, the neighborhood approp
riate (Pacific and Montgomery, one block
over from Ernie's and Doro's), and the ad
venture right. St. Pierre awaited my sen
sory tastebuds.
Built in the 1860s, Diana's Saloon, which
was reopened two years ago as St. Pierre,
was one of the few survivors of the 1906
earthquake and fire. Today, with its beaut
ifully restored glass-arched doorway and
marvelous red brick walls, St. Pierre has
captured the color of old San Francisco
and the traditions of France.
Green director's chairs, white linen tab
lecloths and red carnations give the small
interior a fresh and open ambiance. Mir
rors and large, airy black and white
sketches cover one length of the restaur
ant while the original wainscoting, now
painted white, spans the other. A well
trained staff provides good service.
A menu of 10 entrees, five of them or
ganized into dinners that include soup or
salad, manage to cover the "basics" of
haute cuisine. Prices are high, starting

with Supreme de Volaille Forestiere
(breast of chicken sauteed with wild mus
hrooms and shallots) at $8.75 a la carte;
Canard Montmorency and Filet au Poivre
Vert are featured at $10.25. Medaillon de
Boeuf carries the top dinner price of
$11.50.
Along with five different salads on the a
la carte side are several appetizers, from
$3.25 for a pate to $4.25 for smoked sal
mon. We settled on something in
between and ordered the Escargots de
Bourgogne listed at $3.75. Baked and
served in special snail dishes, the snails
were small and tender and dripping in a
rich butter sauce. We both agreed a little
more garlic would have made this recipe
complete.
A great beginning always adds excite
ment to a meal, and our next selection of
Salade Verte Maison ($1.75) and Salade de
Cresson ($2.50) succeeded in doing just
that. Lengthy romaine and tender-leafed
butter lettuce with a good vinaigrette and
finely grated blue cheese, made up the
house salad. Even the simple Salade de
Cresson, with its peppery watercress and
fresh tomato slices, was prepared with
finesse.
While we finished our salads and waited
for the main course, Medaillon de Veau
Vallee d'Auge ($10.25) and Saumon au
Champagne ($9.75), we sipped a full

bodied white Burgandy wine from Macon
bottled under St. Pierre's own label ($7).
Both the veal and the salmon were
above average. A change from the creamy
white wine or sherry-sauced veal dishes
usually served, our veal entree was laced
with Calvados, the fiery apple brandy from
the Normandy region. Tender and deli
cately sweet, this eastern white veal dish
was well-received. The salmon, poached
in a smooth white wine and champagne
sauce that verged on the too-rich, was the
evening's specialty.
The desserts listed on the menu were
simple and imaginative. The Canache
($2.25), St. Pierre's own "Chocolate ex
travaganza" and the Coupe Pierrot Gour
mand ($2) should satisfy any rich dessert
connoisseur.
St. Pierre should be approached with an
empty stomach and a full pocketbook.
With most items a la carte, the tab rises
quickly. Nevertheless, the price is rarely
without pleasant and memorable com
pensation.
St. Pierre is open for lunch Tuesday
through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. And for dinner on Tuesday through
Saturdayfrom6tolo:3op.m. Reservations

Gamble. I didandcameoutawinner. An
ad for St. Pierre, "un restaurant francais,"
caught my attention. The graphics were
sophisticated, the neighborhood approp
riate (Pacific and Montgomery, one block
over from Ernie's and Doro's), and the ad
venture right. St. Pierre awaited my sen
sory tastebuds.
Built in the 1860s, Diana's Saloon, which
was reopened two years ago as St. Pierre,
was one of the few survivors of the 1906
earthquake and fire. Today, with its beaut
ifully restored glass-arched doorway and
marvelous red brick walls, St. Pierre has
captured the color of old San Francisco
and the traditions of France.
Green director's chairs, white linen tab
lecloths and red carnations give the small
interior a fresh and open ambiance. Mir
rors and large, airy black and white
sketches cover one length of the restaur
ant while the original wainscoting, now
painted white, spans the other. A well
trained staff provides good service.
A menu of 10 entrees, five of them or
ganized into dinners that include soup or
salad, manage to cover the "basics" of
haute cuisine. Prices are high, starting

with Supreme de Volaille Forestiere
(breast of chicken sauteed with wild mus
hrooms and shallots) at $8.75 a la carte;
Canard Montmorency and Filet au Poivre
Vert are featured at $10.25. Medaillon de
Boeuf carries the top dinner price of
$11.50.
Along with five different salads on the a
la carte side are several appetizers, from
$3.25 for a pate to $4.25 for smoked sal
mon. We settled on something in
between and ordered the Escargots de
Bourgogne listed at $3.75. Baked and
served in special snail dishes, the snails
were small and tender and dripping in a
rich butter sauce. We both agreed a little
more garlic would have made this recipe
complete.
A great beginning always adds excite
ment to a meal, and our next selection of
Salade Verte Maison ($1.75) and Salade de
Cresson ($2.50) succeeded in doing just
that. Lengthy romaine and tender-leafed
butter lettuce with a good vinaigrette and
finely grated blue cheese, made up the
house salad. Even the simple Salade de
Cresson, with its peppery watercress and
fresh tomato slices, was prepared with
finesse.
While we finished our salads and waited
for the main course, Medaillon de Veau
Vallee d'Auge ($10.25) and Saumon au
Champagne ($9.75), we sipped a full

bodied white Burgandy wine from Macon
bottled under St. Pierre's own label ($7).
Both the veal and the salmon were
above average. A change from the creamy
white wine or sherry-sauced veal dishes
usually served, our veal entree was laced
with Calvados, the fiery apple brandy from
the Normandy region. Tender and deli
cately sweet, this eastern white veal dish
was well-received. The salmon, poached
in a smooth white wine and champagne
sauce that verged on the too-rich, was the
evening's specialty.
The desserts listed on the menu were
simple and imaginative. The Canache
($2.25), St. Pierre's own "Chocolate ex
travaganza" and the Coupe Pierrot Gour
mand ($2) should satisfy any rich dessert
connoisseur.
St. Pierre should be approached with an
