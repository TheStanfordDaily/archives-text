Midnight Cowboy
New Varsity
Saturday, October 7-
Monday October 9
Emotionally potent movies
are rarely complex. They gen
erally attack their subject mat
ter with little if any tact, driv
ing a few points home with
extreme regularity — only oc
casionally do they attempt in
tricacy of mood, or sophisti
cation of performance, or in
telligence. This is particularly
true of movies that concern
themselves with "little people
leading hopeless lives." In
most such cases the pathos is
pounded home until the din is
all but deafening.
Midnight Cowboy is the
ranking cinematic exception
to this rule. The picture is
moving in the way that Marty
was moving, in that the
characters and story line are
every bit as pathetic, but no
one will ever accuse director
John Sch'esinger of taking an
easy route here. John Voight
and Dustin Hoffman are ex
tremely sophisticated actors,
and the parts they play allow
us to see both men at their
finest. The picture does not
end as we expect it to end,
and none of its edges are
blunted — no miracles un
ravel this miserable story of
two 42nd street losers. Re
quired viewing. With Coming
Home.

Sleeper
Saturday
Cubberley Auditorium
It is in vogue these days to
rank Woody Allen's movies
according to their fundamen
tal melancholy. The "better"
pictures are held to be those
in which Allen's dark side is
closest to the surface, while
those not so rooted in misery
and fear are proportionately
lacking.
Such a system certainly has
its merits, in that Allen has
clearly developed in such a
way, but attempts to judge his
films by such limited criterion
do him an injustice.
"Sleeper" is a perfect exam
ple. This picture has little if
any dark side, and as such is
very clearly "early Woody,"
but I have considerable trou
ble understanding what the
hell that means. Sleeper is a
funny movie, pure and sim
ple, and it doesn't leave me
unsatisifed — it leaves me in
the aisle convinced that it is
possible to die of excess
laughter. He's a serious,

thoughtful, intelligent man,
and no doubt deserves
Hosannas for those qualities,
but he's also the funniest per
son on the planet. Its hard to
fault Woody Allen for playing
his strength.
Somebody Killed Her Hus
band
Bijou
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is
married to a man who's idea of a
dinner toast is to mumble "my
first today." Close friend Jeff
Bridges is a writer of chil
dren's books who is unpub
lished forall the right reasons.
When the duo find Farrah's
husband stuck to a table with
a knife, they stash the corpse
in the refrigerator for want of
anything better to do. Even
Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this
half-baked non-mystery, and
here the blandness of the
female lead and the ineptness
of director Lamont Johnson
combine to create an enter
tainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.

Coming Home If-if-if.
Varsity
In many ways a mess, Com
ing Home works because it
captures the look, the feel of
1968. Too much of the film's
work was done at the editing
table, too little beforehand,
but you just get the sense
while watching Coming
Home that Jr.ne Fonda, Jon
Voight, and director Hal
Ashby, the movie's driving
creative forces, knew what
the hell some tiny fragment of
our crazy war felt like. Their
triumph is that they manage
to communicate this as well as
they do. Plaing with Midnight
Cowboy, Saturday through
Monday.

Dona Flor and Her Two Hus
bands -kir-k
Aquarius
Dona Flor, a widow who
marries a dependable but
none too exciting druggist,
manages to get the best of two
worlds when her rakish first
husband comes back from the
dead to return romance to her
life. Dona Flor is a warm, often
very funny import from Brazil.

Who is Killing the
Great Chefs of Europe?
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really

easy to dismiss this movie as
just pure fluff handled in a
fake style way, but I enjoyed
the damn thing, and I won't
deny it. Chefs is a great
throwaway movie, and even
though some of its chemistry
never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset
pairing especially), the movie
works on a semi-classy 'what
the hell' level. Robert Morley
overacts so zealousy that you
begin to enjoy it.
Oh God!
Sunday
Mem Aud
Oh God is this a Frank
Capra rip-off. Peace and love
and nirvana for the common
man. The messages in this
thematic-comedy aren't of
fensive; quite the contrary.
It's just that everything has
been reduced to such Ivory
soap blandness that any pos
sible effectiveness that the
movie might have had is
blunted completely, john
Denver is Madison Avenue
Everyman and George Burns,
as we have always known, is
God.

Sunset Boulevard ifififif.
Monday night, Cubberley
Vivid becomes an empty ad
jective when you try to de
scribe Gloria Swanson's truly
unbelievable performance as
Nora Desmond, for whom
time stopped when sound

was introduced into movies.
Swanson just doesn't grab
this role; she rips it apart. Wil
liam Holden plays the broken
young screen writer who is
enveloped by Desmond and
her bizarre fantasy world, and
Erich von Stroheim portrays,
in a performance that must
have been close to his heart,
Desmond's ex-husband/
director who is now only her
butler.

Open City ***¥
Tuesday night, Bishop
The truly great example of
neo-realism. Roberto Rossel
lini's look at Rome under Nazi
occupationis frighteningly
real in ways that only this type
of documentary filmmaking
can achieve. A great example
of going all the way with a
movie, and it was done under
the most difficult conditions
imaginable: the Nazis were
still in Rome as Rossellini shot
the film.
Death on the Nile
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he

slides into seriousness in time
for the patented Agatha Chris
tie climax. A solid mystery,
nicely photographed, well set
out. But perhaps Gulf and
Western (who own
Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put
their 14 million dollars to a dif
ferent use. Or, better yet,
maybe they should keep mak
ing these safe, inoffensive
and generally well made en
tertainments and use the pro
fits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't
happen though; the board of
directors would never allow
it.
—R.L.
Heaven Can Wait ★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber
story without the bite. De
pendant for its success upon
machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue —
if the movie is to work it must
continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty, though
big and strong, has more than
a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinate persistance
and a stubborn sense that he's
been cheated. (Strange as it
sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported 1 by
those of a well-addled sup
porting cast.)

It has been noted
everywhere that the picture is
based on a '41 Robert
Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a re
make as it is an effort to
exume a kind of movie that I'd
thought was dead and gone. It
doesn't just stick old lines into
new faces and play off its in
feriority to the original — this
is a thoughtful reintroduction
to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is
currently the norm. Very
good. Never again will I con
fuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17yearoldsseemore than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you
get Crease, which Stigwood
produced in association with
Allan Carr. Crease is fairly inof
fensive, and I suppose it is pos
sible to have a very good time at
it. But can't we demand a little
bit better than this kind of cal
culated entertainment, presold
like one would sell Ultra-Brite
toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by
Donner last year than I did
watching the movie in the thea
ter; at least the people at Don
ner appeared to be enjoying
themselves.
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they
flash by at a dizzying pace. The
movie also has Dolby sound, so
while watching Crease, I felt
like a 3-year-old kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feel
ing must please some people,
and while Crease is hardly a
good movie, sensations like that
help to make it the ultimate in
pacifiers.

Animal House if.if.if.if.
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which
serves as one big glorification of
white male fantasies. And be
cause of this, this story of vari
ous forms of frat life in '62
works; Animal House's ap

proach fits its subject matter
very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never
quite sure just what drives Be
lushi, but whatever it is, it must
be good stuff.
John Landis, the director of
Animal House, directs as if
there is no speed but fast and no
volume but loud, and while that
doesn't hurt him too much here
(although, because of this ten
dency, Animal House has a de
cidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can
do anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a lit
tle frenzy never hurt anyone,
did it?
—R.L.
Interiors
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors
is sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising
is that it is not more so, since
this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi
ence.
But when Interiors works,
and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen
Stapleton, Diane Keaton and
Marybeth Hurt are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble
are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—Ron Lillejord
A Wedding +*(■
Menlo
Writer-director Robert
Altman returns to Nashville's
style but his subject is not
nearly so arresting. While A
Wedding often exhibits quick
flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements ap
pear to have been left in un
finished form, and the charac
terization is particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages
to create a sharply defined
character, and as a consequ
ence, she dominates the movie
in what is a performance of
great emotional range.
