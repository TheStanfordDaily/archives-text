## Professionalism has limits 
### 
While I suppose that it is
quite possible to respect The
Boys from Brazil for being a
professionally crafted thriller, I
never found myself liking it.
Boys gets it done, but in a very
cold way. The worst dampener
is that you never really get

close enough to get involved
— the movie keeps its dis
tance.
The Boys from Brazil may
well cash in on some healthy
Hitler fear which might still be
lurking about. The plot con
cerns the standard "mad Nazi
scientist," Josef Mengele
(Gregory Peck), who appa
ently is "famous" for his grisly
:xperiments with children at
Auschwitz. Mengele plans to
itart a Fourth Reich (of course),
lis scheme has a cleverly
'izarre twist to it. Laurence
Dlivier plays the aging Jewish
•Jazi hunter (clearly based on
'imon Wisenthal, the
ichmann's captor) who sets
>ut to stop him.
Franklin Schaffner (Patton)
lirected Boys. Like all Schaff
er films, Boys looks great
Henri Decae is the cinematog
»pher) — but other than that,
au don't get the feeling that
e is adding anything to the
:ript.
However, Schaffner does

keep things bouncing along.
Also, this is the first time since
Patton that Schaffner has been
able to make intimate, non
epic scenes work.
Peck and Olivier are both
given chances to star, and
some of the old luster is still

there. Peck has a juicy little
stereotype role — the crazed
old Nazi. Of course, Peck is
"playing against type," but
what makes his performance
so enjoyable to watch is the
feeling we get that Peck is en
joying himself immensely.
Olivier's portrayal of the
Nazi hunter has a surprisingly
good comic sense to it. I don't
think I've ever seen Olivier
look so old in a movie before,
and it is one measure of
Olivier's sense of humor that
he is able to have fun with this.
At certain moments, such as
when you see Olivier or Peck
do something that's just right,
you begin to get immersed in
Boys from Brazil. Then the
movie pulls away. After a while
you feel so damn neutral
watching the film that it begins
to unnerve you.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency
— that the best thrillers have,
and which young directors like

Brian De Palma and Steven
Spielberg infuse into their
movies. I emphasize young
because it is a central issue in
Boys from Brazil. What is old
and tired is its approach, not its
stars. Professionalism can only
do so much.
