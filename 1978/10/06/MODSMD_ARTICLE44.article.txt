## Dreyfuss as a mixed-up detective 
### 
Jeremy Paul Kagan's new movie, The Big
Fix, starring Richard Dreyfuss, contains
three stories. The first story is about Moses
Wine the family man. His ex-wife refuses
to give him custody of their two sons, al
though she doesn't think twice about
dropping them at Moses' doorstep before
running off on an EST training weekend.
The second story is about Moses Wine the
private eye who, despite never having
used a gun, is unwittingly thrust into a
dangerous conspiracy concerning the
gubernatorial election in California. The
third story is about Moses Wine the former
radical Berkeley student who begins to
remember everything and everyone he
once stood for.
To put it another way, The Big Fix is a
love story, a suspense thriller, and a sort of
sociological survey all rolled into one. Un
fortunately, the three stories are just that;
three separate stories not integrated com
ponents. Somehow the levels do not
wholly blend together.
Too ambitious?
Perhaps the movie is too ambitious. The
family story is sacrificed to make room for
the other two plots and becomes little
more than a combination of TV cliches.
Yet the acting covers up for these faults
as we witness many unspoken sparks pas
sing between Moses and his eldest son or,
much more often, between Moses and his
engaging Aunt Sonya (Rita Karin). Indeed,
the family story is at its best when Moses
and Aunt Sonya banter between the poig

nant dialogue.
On the other hand, the detective story is
smooth, suspenseful and would make a
valid movie on its own. Its human and
psychological aspects are more convinc
ing than those of the family story. Still
more touching than Moses' relationship
with his family, and more memorable than
his fight to succeed on the job, is the third
story, through which the movie raises sev
eral questions about the '60s generation in
the '70s. Moses is forced to cope with
cynicism as he discovers what became of
his former radical colleagues and redis
covers his own ideals. This clash of past
and present lifestyles culminates when
Moses, a radically anti-violent man, is re
quired to use his gun.
Th6se scenes, both amusing and sur
prisingly painful, involve some of the
finest irony and most commendable acting
in the film. Particularly worth mentioning
are Rita Karin, who portrays the humor
ously blatant radical aunt, John Lithgow,
who plays the psychologically complex
campaign manager Sebastian, and Murray
Abraham, who steals the movie in a scene
as the former Berkeley radical godhead,
Eppis.
Link
The link between these three stories is
Lila (Sisan Anspach), a former fellow stu
dent, radical and lover. She reappears out
of the Berkeley days to haunt Moses politi
cally and sexually, in turn rekindling the
old flame, hiring Moses on his first true

detective job for her gubernatorial candi
date, and re-introducing him to his politi
cal past. Anspach portrays Lilaas a mature,
politically serious and tender woman with
just enough flakiness, bounce and youth
to confuse Moses as he attempts to recon
cile the past with the present.
Influenced by Lila's earnestness and
charm, the audience wants Moses to re
turn to his past ideals. Yet there is the
other side of the coin in ex-wife (Bonnie
Bedelia) who accuses Moses of dwelling in
the past as she hops from guru to self-help
groups in search of a satisfying Present.
Although the wife is not a likeable person
(and her character is not helped by the
cheap parody the script provides), she is a
figure to be reckoned with. The audience
cannot dismiss her viewpoints because
Moses does not dismiss them and, in the
end, Moses does leave the past for his
present paternal love and duties.
Dreyfuss
As Moses Wine, Richard Dreyfuss once
more proves himself an engaging actor
who manages to bring a different interpre
tation of class to the screen in every film.
This time Dreyfuss is a little less depen
dent on mere wit, a little more willing to
cry, and a lot less neurotically energetic.
Whether you are interested in the '60s
generation today (afterall, it's your genera
tion), want a good detective thriller, or just
like Richard Dreyfuss, The Big Fix is worth

dent, radical and lover. She reappears out
of the Berkeley days to haunt Moses politi
cally and sexually, in turn rekindling the
old flame, hiring Moses on his first true

detective job for her gubernatorial candi
date, and re-introducing him to his politi
cal past. Anspach portrays Lilaas a mature,
politically serious and tender woman with
just enough flakiness, bounce and youth
to confuse Moses as he attempts to recon
cile the past with the present.
Influenced by Lila's earnestness and
charm, the audience wants Moses to re
turn to his past ideals. Yet there is the
other side of the coin in ex-wife (Bonnie
Bedelia) who accuses Moses of dwelling in
the past as she hops from guru to self-help
groups in search of a satisfying Present.
Although the wife is not a likeable person
(and her character is not helped by the
cheap parody the script provides), she is a
figure to be reckoned with. The audience
cannot dismiss her viewpoints because
Moses does not dismiss them and, in the
end, Moses does leave the past for his
present paternal love and duties.
Dreyfuss
As Moses Wine, Richard Dreyfuss once
more proves himself an engaging actor
who manages to bring a different interpre
tation of class to the screen in every film.
This time Dreyfuss is a little less depen
dent on mere wit, a little more willing to
cry, and a lot less neurotically energetic.
Whether you are interested in the '60s
generation today (afterall, it's your genera
tion), want a good detective thriller, or just
like Richard Dreyfuss, The Big Fix is worth
seeing.
Jeremy Paul Kagan's new movie, The Big
Fix, starring Richard Dreyfuss, contains
three stories. The first story is about Moses
Wine the family man. His ex-wife refuses
to give him custody of their two sons, al
though she doesn't think twice about
dropping them at Moses' doorstep before
running off on an EST training weekend.
The second story is about Moses Wine the
private eye who, despite never having
used a gun, is unwittingly thrust into a
dangerous conspiracy concerning the
gubernatorial election in California. The
third story is about Moses Wine the former
radical Berkeley student who begins to
remember everything and everyone he
once stood for.
To put it another way, The Big Fix is a
love story, a suspense thriller, and a sort of
sociological survey all rolled into one. Un
fortunately, the three stories are just that;
three separate stories not integrated com
ponents. Somehow the levels do not
wholly blend together.
Too ambitious?
Perhaps the movie is too ambitious. The
family story is sacrificed to make room for
the other two plots and becomes little
more than a combination of TV cliches.
Yet the acting covers up for these faults
as we witness many unspoken sparks pas
sing between Moses and his eldest son or,
much more often, between Moses and his
engaging Aunt Sonya (Rita Karin). Indeed,
the family story is at its best when Moses
and Aunt Sonya banter between the poig

nant dialogue.
On the other hand, the detective story is
smooth, suspenseful and would make a
valid movie on its own. Its human and
psychological aspects are more convinc
ing than those of the family story. Still
more touching than Moses' relationship
with his family, and more memorable than
his fight to succeed on the job, is the third
story, through which the movie raises sev
eral questions about the '60s generation in
the '70s. Moses is forced to cope with
cynicism as he discovers what became of
his former radical colleagues and redis
covers his own ideals. This clash of past
and present lifestyles culminates when
Moses, a radically anti-violent man, is re
quired to use his gun.
Th6se scenes, both amusing and sur
prisingly painful, involve some of the
finest irony and most commendable acting
in the film. Particularly worth mentioning
are Rita Karin, who portrays the humor
ously blatant radical aunt, John Lithgow,
who plays the psychologically complex
campaign manager Sebastian, and Murray
Abraham, who steals the movie in a scene
as the former Berkeley radical godhead,
Eppis.
Link
The link between these three stories is
Lila (Sisan Anspach), a former fellow stu
dent, radical and lover. She reappears out
of the Berkeley days to haunt Moses politi
cally and sexually, in turn rekindling the
