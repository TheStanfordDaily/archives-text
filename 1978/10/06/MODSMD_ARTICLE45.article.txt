Carter veto sustained by House
Washington — The House yesterday narrowly
sustained President Jimmy Carter's veto of the
$10.2 billion energy and water development bill
after furious White House lobbying overcame
what had loomed as an almost certain override.
With scores of congressmen absent from the
floor, House leaders attempted to re-pass the bill
over the president's objection while the ink was
still wet on his veto message. The Senate was re
garded as sure to override had the House effort
succeeded.
With the Democratic leadership in both the
House and Senate lined up against him, Carter had
dispatched several administration leaders to the
Capitol on Wednesday and again yesterday in a
frantic, and successful, effort to win votes.
American wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm — Isaac Bashevis Singer, the master
Yiddish story-teller whose lively tales of Jewish life
are miniatures of a world of human feeling, was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday.
The 74-year-old Polish-born novelist and short
story writer, a naturalized American citizen, was
cited by the Swedish Academy of Letters for his
"impassioned narrative art which, with roots in a
Polish-Jewish tradition, brings universal human
conditions to life."
Singer, reached in Miami, where he was spend
ing the Jewish holy days, told a reporter, "I'm
grateful but at the same time I am sorry that writers
greater than I did not get it."
He has written a dozen novels, children's
books, memoirs and numerous short stories,
which frequently appear in the magazine The New
Yorker. Almost all of his work was written in Yid
dish, the language of central European Jews, and
was later translated into English, sometimes by
himself with the aid of others.
Warnke says he'll resign soon
Washington — Paul Warnke, the chief U.S. arms
negotiator guiding American attempts to reach a
new SALT agreement with the Soviet Union, will
leave that job "in the very near future," he said last
night.
"There is really no date picked," Warnke said in
a telephone interview.
At the same time, U.S. officials said the two sides
appeared heading toward agreement on allowing
two new missile systems for both the United States
and the Soviet Union during the seven-year life of
the treaty.

This has been one of the major obstacles in the
path of a new accord.
Warnke and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance plan
a trip to Moscow "later this month" to work on
details of the arms agreement.
New York Post back in print
New York — After an eight-week strike, the New
York Post returned to the newsstands yesterday
with a fat 128-page edition, while efforts resumed
to end multi-union walkouts that have kept the
city's two morning newspapers shut down.
Negotiators for the New York Times and Daily
News met with the striking pressmen's union at
federal mediation offices as the Post ended its
57-day shutdown with an edition that included late
news and several reviews of events that occurred
while the paper was silent.
Rupert Murdoch, publisher of the Post, has
largely agreed to go along with contracts agreed to
by the pressmen, the Times and the News.
The Post, with a normal circulation of 620,000,
printed about 1 million copies yesterday, each of
them topped by a "Welcome Back" headline. The
only previous occasions when the Post printed
that many copies were when Sen. Robert Kennedy
was assassinated and when Son of Sam killer David
Berkowitz was caught.
Israeli gunboats shell Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli gunboats shelled west
ern Beirut last night in an apparent warning to
Syrian peace-keeping troops to stop battering
Christian areas in the eastern part of the city.
An Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv said the
vessels fired on a Palestinian guerrilla naval base in
southwest Beirut. The official Lebanese radio said
three gunboats fired on Ramlek Baida — a Moslem
residential quarter — and withdrew when Syrian
artillary opened fire on them. No casualties were
reported.
West Beirut was the stronghold of leftist Mos
lem militaries and the Palestinian guerrillas during
the 19-month civil war that ended in November,
1976. It has remained outside the battle between
Syrian troops and rightist Christian militias in the
eastern sections.
Laguna Beach hillside still sliding
Laguna Beach — The earth began to move again
yesterday in the Bluebird Canyon hillside
neighborhood while residents waited for
geologists to tell them when it will be safe to return
to their devastated property.

"We experienced periodic movement of the
slidefromll p.m. untilsa.m., with tumbling rocks
and breaking glass occurring but there was no
visible further damage to homes," said Police Lt.
Al Olson. 11
Officials said that 40 homes have been declared
uninhabitable as a result of the massive landslide
which began early Monday morning.
Sub stealing deemed 'outlandish'
St. Louis — Three men are in custody today,
accused of a plot many officials said was too fantas
tic to pull off — steal a nuclear submarine, kill the
crew, blow up a ship, put out to sea, sell the sub,
and perhaps fire a nuclear missile at the East Coast.
The Pentagon said it couldn't be done, and an
FBI agent said he hoped that was so. But, the agent
added, the government couldn't afford to dis
count anything "as too outlandish."
Still, the reactions of officials and prospective
victims ranged from "a practical impossibility" to
"funny as hell."
Meanwhile, U.S. Magistrate David Noce set a
preliminary hearing Oct. 13 for Edward Men
denhall, 24, and Kurtis Schmidt, 22, on charges of
conspiring to steal the USS Trepang, based in New
London, Conn. They were arrested Wednesday in
St. Louis.
James Cosgrove, 26, of Ovid, N.Y., was arrested
Wednesday in Geneva, N.Y.

Carter veto sustained by House
Washington — The House yesterday narrowly
sustained President Jimmy Carter's veto of the
$10.2 billion energy and water development bill
after furious White House lobbying overcame
what had loomed as an almost certain override.
With scores of congressmen absent from the
floor, House leaders attempted to re-pass the bill
over the president's objection while the ink was
still wet on his veto message. The Senate was re
garded as sure to override had the House effort
succeeded.
With the Democratic leadership in both the
House and Senate lined up against him, Carter had
dispatched several administration leaders to the
Capitol on Wednesday and again yesterday in a
frantic, and successful, effort to win votes.
American wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm — Isaac Bashevis Singer, the master
Yiddish story-teller whose lively tales of Jewish life
are miniatures of a world of human feeling, was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday.
The 74-year-old Polish-born novelist and short
story writer, a naturalized American citizen, was
cited by the Swedish Academy of Letters for his
"impassioned narrative art which, with roots in a
Polish-Jewish tradition, brings universal human
conditions to life."
Singer, reached in Miami, where he was spend
ing the Jewish holy days, told a reporter, "I'm
grateful but at the same time I am sorry that writers
greater than I did not get it."
He has written a dozen novels, children's
books, memoirs and numerous short stories,
which frequently appear in the magazine The New
Yorker. Almost all of his work was written in Yid
dish, the language of central European Jews, and
was later translated into English, sometimes by
himself with the aid of others.
Warnke says he'll resign soon
Washington — Paul Warnke, the chief U.S. arms
negotiator guiding American attempts to reach a
new SALT agreement with the Soviet Union, will
leave that job "in the very near future," he said last
night.
"There is really no date picked," Warnke said in
a telephone interview.
At the same time, U.S. officials said the two sides
appeared heading toward agreement on allowing
two new missile systems for both the United States
and the Soviet Union during the seven-year life of
the treaty.

This has been one of the major obstacles in the
path of a new accord.
Warnke and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance plan
a trip to Moscow "later this month" to work on
details of the arms agreement.
New York Post back in print
New York — After an eight-week strike, the New
York Post returned to the newsstands yesterday
with a fat 128-page edition, while efforts resumed
to end multi-union walkouts that have kept the
city's two morning newspapers shut down.
Negotiators for the New York Times and Daily
News met with the striking pressmen's union at
federal mediation offices as the Post ended its
57-day shutdown with an edition that included late
news and several reviews of events that occurred
while the paper was silent.
Rupert Murdoch, publisher of the Post, has
largely agreed to go along with contracts agreed to
by the pressmen, the Times and the News.
The Post, with a normal circulation of 620,000,
printed about 1 million copies yesterday, each of
them topped by a "Welcome Back" headline. The
only previous occasions when the Post printed
that many copies were when Sen. Robert Kennedy
was assassinated and when Son of Sam killer David
Berkowitz was caught.
Israeli gunboats shell Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli gunboats shelled west
ern Beirut last night in an apparent warning to
Syrian peace-keeping troops to stop battering
Christian areas in the eastern part of the city.
An Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv said the
vessels fired on a Palestinian guerrilla naval base in
southwest Beirut. The official Lebanese radio said
three gunboats fired on Ramlek Baida — a Moslem
residential quarter — and withdrew when Syrian
artillary opened fire on them. No casualties were
reported.
West Beirut was the stronghold of leftist Mos
lem militaries and the Palestinian guerrillas during
the 19-month civil war that ended in November,
1976. It has remained outside the battle between

Laguna Beach hillside still sliding
Laguna Beach — The earth began to move again

"We experienced periodic movement of the

Officials said that 40 homes have been declared
uninhabitable as a result of the massive landslide
which began early Monday morning.
Sub stealing deemed 'outlandish'
St. Louis — Three men are in custody today,
accused of a plot many officials said was too fantas

crew, blow up a ship, put out to sea, sell the sub,
and perhaps fire a nuclear missile at the East Coast.
The Pentagon said it couldn't be done, and an
FBI agent said he hoped that was so. But, the agent
added, the government couldn't afford to dis
count anything "as too outlandish."
Still, the reactions of officials and prospective
victims ranged from "a practical impossibility" to
"funny as hell."
Meanwhile, U.S. Magistrate David Noce set a
preliminary hearing Oct. 13 for Edward Men
denhall, 24, and Kurtis Schmidt, 22, on charges of
conspiring to steal the USS Trepang, based in New
London, Conn. They were arrested Wednesday in

which began early Monday morning.
Sub stealing deemed 'outlandish'
St. Louis — Three men are in custody today,
accused of a plot many officials said was too fantas
tic to pull off — steal a nuclear submarine, kill the
crew, blow up a ship, put out to sea, sell the sub,
and perhaps fire a nuclear missile at the East Coast.
The Pentagon said it couldn't be done, and an
FBI agent said he hoped that was so. But, the agent
added, the government couldn't afford to dis
count anything "as too outlandish."
Still, the reactions of officials and prospective
victims ranged from "a practical impossibility" to
"funny as hell."
Meanwhile, U.S. Magistrate David Noce set a
preliminary hearing Oct. 13 for Edward Men
denhall, 24, and Kurtis Schmidt, 22, on charges of
conspiring to steal the USS Trepang, based in New
London, Conn. They were arrested Wednesday in
St. Louis.
James Cosgrove, 26, of Ovid, N.Y., was arrested
Wednesday in Geneva, N.Y.

Carter veto sustained by House
Washington — The House yesterday narrowly
sustained President Jimmy Carter's veto of the
$10.2 billion energy and water development bill
after furious White House lobbying overcame
what had loomed as an almost certain override.
With scores of congressmen absent from the
floor, House leaders attempted to re-pass the bill
over the president's objection while the ink was
still wet on his veto message. The Senate was re
garded as sure to override had the House effort
succeeded.
With the Democratic leadership in both the
House and Senate lined up against him, Carter had
dispatched several administration leaders to the
Capitol on Wednesday and again yesterday in a
frantic, and successful, effort to win votes.
American wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm — Isaac Bashevis Singer, the master
Yiddish story-teller whose lively tales of Jewish life
are miniatures of a world of human feeling, was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday.
The 74-year-old Polish-born novelist and short
story writer, a naturalized American citizen, was
cited by the Swedish Academy of Letters for his
"impassioned narrative art which, with roots in a
Polish-Jewish tradition, brings universal human
conditions to life."
Singer, reached in Miami, where he was spend
ing the Jewish holy days, told a reporter, "I'm
grateful but at the same time I am sorry that writers
greater than I did not get it."
He has written a dozen novels, children's
books, memoirs and numerous short stories,
which frequently appear in the magazine The New
Yorker. Almost all of his work was written in Yid
dish, the language of central European Jews, and
was later translated into English, sometimes by
himself with the aid of others.
Warnke says he'll resign soon
Washington — Paul Warnke, the chief U.S. arms
negotiator guiding American attempts to reach a
new SALT agreement with the Soviet Union, will
leave that job "in the very near future," he said last
night.
"There is really no date picked," Warnke said in
a telephone interview.
At the same time, U.S. officials said the two sides
appeared heading toward agreement on allowing
two new missile systems for both the United States
and the Soviet Union during the seven-year life of
the treaty.

This has been one of the major obstacles in the
path of a new accord.
Warnke and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance plan
a trip to Moscow "later this month" to work on
details of the arms agreement.
New York Post back in print
New York — After an eight-week strike, the New
York Post returned to the newsstands yesterday
with a fat 128-page edition, while efforts resumed
to end multi-union walkouts that have kept the
city's two morning newspapers shut down.
Negotiators for the New York Times and Daily
News met with the striking pressmen's union at
federal mediation offices as the Post ended its
57-day shutdown with an edition that included late
news and several reviews of events that occurred
while the paper was silent.
Rupert Murdoch, publisher of the Post, has
largely agreed to go along with contracts agreed to
by the pressmen, the Times and the News.
The Post, with a normal circulation of 620,000,
printed about 1 million copies yesterday, each of
them topped by a "Welcome Back" headline. The
only previous occasions when the Post printed
that many copies were when Sen. Robert Kennedy
was assassinated and when Son of Sam killer David
Berkowitz was caught.
Israeli gunboats shell Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli gunboats shelled west
ern Beirut last night in an apparent warning to
Syrian peace-keeping troops to stop battering
Christian areas in the eastern part of the city.
An Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv said the
vessels fired on a Palestinian guerrilla naval base in
southwest Beirut. The official Lebanese radio said
three gunboats fired on Ramlek Baida — a Moslem
residential quarter — and withdrew when Syrian
artillary opened fire on them. No casualties were
reported.
West Beirut was the stronghold of leftist Mos
lem militaries and the Palestinian guerrillas during
the 19-month civil war that ended in November,
1976. It has remained outside the battle between
Syrian troops and rightist Christian militias in the
eastern sections.
