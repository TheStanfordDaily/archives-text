# Parking spaces lost
## 
### TONY RUPERT 
Construction of the new Margaret
Jacks Hall on Panama Street behind
the Communication Department will
result in a loss of 34 faculty or staff
parking spaces that once occupied
the spot, according to Master Plan
ner Oscar Nelson.
The lost parking spaces will be
made up for by adding 60 new faculty
or staff spaces to the nearby Jordan
lot and a new 250-space lot near
Lagunita Court which will be availa
ble to students, faculty and staff.
Both of these lots are near comple
tion now.

According to Nelson, this is just
pa rtofa larger policy to removepark
ing from the inner areas of the cam
pus and relocate it on the perimeter.
At one time the areas now occupied
by Meyer Undergraduate Library, the
new Green Library and the Hoover
Memorial were engulfed by parking
lots that have since been relocated in
the Hand J lots on Campus Drive.
"No parking program is agreeable
to everyone," said Nelson, "but we
try to provide enough parking for
everyone while making an effort to
keep the campus free of fumes,
noise and congestion."
