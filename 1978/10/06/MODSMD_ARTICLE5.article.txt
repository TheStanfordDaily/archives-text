# Briggs Initiative stirs debate
## 
### RACHEL BAGBY 
Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative,
will be brought before the voters in the state's Nov. 7
general election. If passed into law, it will allow
school boards to refuse employment or to terminate
the employment of "a schoolteacher, a teacher's
aide, a school administrator or a counselor. . . who
engaged in public homosexual activity and/or public
homosexual conduct directed at, or likely to come to
the attention of school children or other school
employees."
The express goal of the initiative is to preserve and
protect "the conjugal family unit."
"When children are constantly exposed to such
homosexual role models, they may well be inclined
to experiment with a lifestyle that could lead to disas
ter for themselves and ultimately for society as a
whole," said State Sen. John Briggs, the proposal's
sponsor, in the Sept. 21 issue of the Daily Nexus.
Homosexuality then becomes "a public harm that
legislatures have a right and duty to proscribe."
The measure's opponents argue that it unnecessar
ily infringes on human rights because narrower exist
ing legislation already addresses the issue.
Sophomore Rhio Hiersch, spokesman for the Gay
People's Union (CPU) here, said Provision No. 44932
of the California Education Code protects pupils from
sexual advances by teachers and proscribes teachers
from promoting their sexual orientation on the job.
Public copulation, both homosexual and

heterosexual, is already forbidden by the California
Penal Code.
Hiersch said the initiative "plays upon ignorance
and fear" and if upheld would only serve to per
petuate harmful stereotypes.
The CPU is registering voters and distributing in
formation about the Briggs Initiative in White Plaza
from noon to 2 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. A
campus-wide coalition for human rights to combat
the Briggs Initiative and other measures deemed "de
trimental to human rights" is being organized.
The initiative defines "public homosexual activity"
as indiscreet or public copulation with any person of
the same sex. "Public homosexual conduct" means
the "advocating or promoting of private or public
homosexual activity" likely to come to school chil
dren's or other employees' attention.
Under the proposed law, employees charged with
engaging in such activity or conduct would be subject
to a school board investigation to determine whether
the alleged actions would render them unfit for ser
vice.
The proposition states that the proximity of the
time and location of the alleged conduct to the
employees' responsibilities, the likelihood that such
conduct would adversely affect students or other
employees and whether the alleged acts would "tend
to encourage, promote, or dispose school children
toward pricate or public homosexual activity" are
among the factors pertinent in a school board deter
mination of unfitness for service.

aide, a school administrator or a counselor. . . who
engaged in public homosexual activity and/or public
homosexual conduct directed at, or likely to come to
the attention of school children or other school
employees."
The express goal of the initiative is to preserve and
protect "the conjugal family unit."
"When children are constantly exposed to such
homosexual role models, they may well be inclined
to experiment with a lifestyle that could lead to disas
ter for themselves and ultimately for society as a
whole," said State Sen. John Briggs, the proposal's
sponsor, in the Sept. 21 issue of the Daily Nexus.
Homosexuality then becomes "a public harm that
legislatures have a right and duty to proscribe."
The measure's opponents argue that it unnecessar
ily infringes on human rights because narrower exist
ing legislation already addresses the issue.
Sophomore Rhio Hiersch, spokesman for the Gay
People's Union (CPU) here, said Provision No. 44932
of the California Education Code protects pupils from
sexual advances by teachers and proscribes teachers
from promoting their sexual orientation on the job.
Public copulation, both homosexual and

heterosexual, is already forbidden by the California
Penal Code.
Hiersch said the initiative "plays upon ignorance
and fear" and if upheld would only serve to per
petuate harmful stereotypes.
The CPU is registering voters and distributing in
formation about the Briggs Initiative in White Plaza
from noon to 2 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. A
campus-wide coalition for human rights to combat
the Briggs Initiative and other measures deemed "de
trimental to human rights" is being organized.
The initiative defines "public homosexual activity"
as indiscreet or public copulation with any person of
the same sex. "Public homosexual conduct" means
the "advocating or promoting of private or public
homosexual activity" likely to come to school chil
dren's or other employees' attention.
Under the proposed law, employees charged with
engaging in such activity or conduct would be subject
to a school board investigation to determine whether
the alleged actions would render them unfit for ser
vice.
The proposition states that the proximity of the
time and location of the alleged conduct to the
employees' responsibilities, the likelihood that such
conduct would adversely affect students or other
employees and whether the alleged acts would "tend
to encourage, promote, or dispose school children
toward pricate or public homosexual activity" are
among the factors pertinent in a school board deter
mination of unfitness for service.
