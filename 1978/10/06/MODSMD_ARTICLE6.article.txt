# Moses describes difficulties of energy information system
## 
### CHERYL ZOLLARS 
Difficulties involved in creating
and organizing a national energy in
formation system were described
Thursday by Dr. Lincoln Moses, ad
ministrator of the federal Energy In
formation Administration (EIA).
"The government has a responsi
bility to provide statistical informa
tion, not otherwise available, which
is useful... to the commerce and to
the citizenry of the country," Moses
said, in the opening lecture of an In
stitute for Energy series.
Fine line
The distinction between providing
energy information for the govern
ment and for the public is a "fine
line," Moses had said in an earlier
interview. He also said he favors ex

panding EIA services to the public.
"The average citizen is not our
primary client," he said. "Some of
our information is important to pub
lic research about energy" such as
data provided to universities.
Moses, a former statistics profes
sor here, left in 1977 to become the
ElA's first administrator. The EIA pro
vides data processing and forecast
ing services for the Department of
Energy, the Congress and the Execu
tive Branch.
Independence
Although he reports directly to
Secretary of Energy James
Schlesinger, Moses emphasized the
independence of EIA operations. He
is legally exempt from obtaining ap

proval for collecting, analyzing and
publishing energy information.
One of his main tasks is organizing
the National Energy Information Sys
tem (NEIS), mandated by the Energy
Conservation and Production Act of
1976.
The NEIS must provide informa
tion enabling an institutional analysis
of: America's energy supply system,
sensitivity of fuel reserves to
economic and other influences, and
international relationships and their
impact on the world energy situa
tion, among other data, he said.
The main difficulties, Moses said,
are determining the scope of the
NEIS and data collection, storage,
classification and access.
"A helpful, but less than decisive,
criterion of usefulness is 'who uses
this and for what?' " he said.
Answers unclear
Sometimes the answers are not
clear-cut, according to Moses.
Citing one example, Moses asked,
"Is this a case of 'Numbers for News
letters?' Is this data system the
backbone of a world-wide synthetic
whale-oil cartel ? Or is it a boon to the
orderly conduct of business in this
necessary line of commerce?"
Another problem involves data for
forecasting related to America's
energy situation. "We have to avoid
saying 'What if. . .?' " Moses said.
Advocacy avoided
Validating information and avoid
ing direct involvement in energy is
sues are other areas of concern for
the EIA, Moses said. "We should
avoid advocating policy," he said,
"but have you ever tried to avoid the
appearance of advocating policy?"
Moses arrived at Stanford in 1939
and became an assistant professor in
1953. Making the transition from
University life to public service was
"not difficult," he said, because he
had "worked with government be
fore and after World War 11 for a short
period of time."
"Being a University professor de
mands the same skills as any other
management task," Moses said.
His goals for the EIA remain the
same as when he first took charge as
administrator. "I would like it to be a
strong statistics agency by the time I
leave," he said, adding that he hoped
it would earn confidence for the in
formation it provides.

proval for collecting, analyzing and
publishing energy information.
One of his main tasks is organizing
the National Energy Information Sys
tem (NEIS), mandated by the Energy
Conservation and Production Act of
1976.
The NEIS must provide informa
tion enabling an institutional analysis
of: America's energy supply system,
sensitivity of fuel reserves to
economic and other influences, and
international relationships and their
impact on the world energy situa
tion, among other data, he said.
The main difficulties, Moses said,
are determining the scope of the
NEIS and data collection, storage,
classification and access.
"A helpful, but less than decisive,
criterion of usefulness is 'who uses
this and for what?' " he said.
Answers unclear
Sometimes the answers are not
clear-cut, according to Moses.
Citing one example, Moses asked,
"Is this a case of 'Numbers for News
letters?' Is this data system the
backbone of a world-wide synthetic
whale-oil cartel ? Or is it a boon to the
orderly conduct of business in this
necessary line of commerce?"
Another problem involves data for
forecasting related to America's
energy situation. "We have to avoid
saying 'What if. . .?' " Moses said.
Advocacy avoided
Validating information and avoid
ing direct involvement in energy is
sues are other areas of concern for
the EIA, Moses said. "We should
avoid advocating policy," he said,
"but have you ever tried to avoid the
appearance of advocating policy?"
Moses arrived at Stanford in 1939
and became an assistant professor in
1953. Making the transition from
University life to public service was
"not difficult," he said, because he
had "worked with government be
fore and after World War 11 for a short
period of time."
"Being a University professor de
mands the same skills as any other
management task," Moses said.
His goals for the EIA remain the
same as when he first took charge as
administrator. "I would like it to be a
strong statistics agency by the time I
leave," he said, adding that he hoped
it would earn confidence for the in
formation it provides.
Difficulties involved in creating
and organizing a national energy in
formation system were described
Thursday by Dr. Lincoln Moses, ad
ministrator of the federal Energy In
formation Administration (EIA).
"The government has a responsi
bility to provide statistical informa
tion, not otherwise available, which
is useful... to the commerce and to
the citizenry of the country," Moses
said, in the opening lecture of an In
stitute for Energy series.
Fine line
The distinction between providing
energy information for the govern
ment and for the public is a "fine
line," Moses had said in an earlier
interview. He also said he favors ex

panding EIA services to the public.
"The average citizen is not our
primary client," he said. "Some of
our information is important to pub
lic research about energy" such as
data provided to universities.
Moses, a former statistics profes
sor here, left in 1977 to become the
ElA's first administrator. The EIA pro
vides data processing and forecast
ing services for the Department of
Energy, the Congress and the Execu
tive Branch.
Independence
Although he reports directly to
Secretary of Energy James
Schlesinger, Moses emphasized the
independence of EIA operations. He
is legally exempt from obtaining ap

proval for collecting, analyzing and
publishing energy information.
