### SUE GOLDFARB 
An increased budget, BigGameac
tivities and sorority relations were
the main topics discussed at the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) meet
ing held Wednesday.
Ken Breitenbach, IFC treasurer,
said, "It's really a must to raise the
dues if the IFC wants to run any kinds
of functions. We're going into this
year without a surplus; in fact, we're
going into this year with nothing, so
we have to raise the dues."
IFC dues have been $200 per year
per fraternity for the last several
years. Since some money has been
carried over from year to year, the
dues increase has been avoided.
"With inflation you can't do much
without raising the dues. The budget
padding last year prevented the
raise, but this year we don't have that
padding. And $250 is not outrage
ous," said Mike Cresto, IFC vice
president.
The extent of IFC-sponsored Big
Game activities largely depends
upon the budget outcome, accord
ing to IFC President Kurt Osen
baugh. "I'd like to have more en
thusiasm in the functions," Osen
baugh said. Possible activities in
clude a party in the City on Friday

night and a non-fire rally.
The IFC position on sorority rela
tions is involvement and help with
out isolating the Greek system.
Cresto said, "We discourage
closed functions. If we got into the
pattern of USC or UCLA we'd be
dragging ourselves down."
He said, however, that the IFC is
willing to help sororities with sugges
tions and use of their houses for oc
casional meetings.
The Rush Chairman and the
Rushbook editor will be selected this
quarter, according to Osenbaugh.
Cresto said this would prevent many
of the last-minute crises that had fi
nancial consequences last year. He
said that this year's Rushbook would
contain advertising to help offset its
production costs.
The IFC also proposed a commit
tee on Residential Education to
examine the alternatives to house as
sociates (RAs) in the fraternity
houses. Cresto explained that with
few exceptions, the RAs are not
members of the houses and don't
know the members well. There is a
general dissatisfaction with RAs, ac
cording to Cresto, and he thinks the
jobs they do can be done by frater
nity members.
