# Tree farm proposed
## 
### GAYLE ASHTON 
Will the scent of pine trees
soon be wafting over Univer
sity land? If University negotia
tions now in process succeed,
144 acres of University land will
be leased for 10 years to
Christmas tree growers. By the
mid-1980s approximately
130,000 trees will be in the
ground.
Plans for the tree farm were
approved by the Board of Trus
tees last spring.
John Breedlove, manager of
real estate, and Robert Sum
mers, assistant manager,
would not yet reveal the iden
tity of the leasee. However, both
men described the prospective
Christmas tree growers as an
experienced partnership with
operations in Washington,
Oregon and California.
Summers said they were "99
percent sure" of the agree
mentwith this firm, butleasing
arrangements will not be for

malized for a few more weeks.
The tree farm site is located
near the corner of Sandhill
Road and Highway 280, and
parallels the linear accelerator.
It is part of approximately 3470
acres of University land used
for agriculture, which accord
ing to Summers has been in a
"historically deficit position."
Agricultural projects in the
foothills began in the 1950s in
an attempt to meet property
taxes, but revenues received
from the various leases have
always fallen far short of cover
ing those taxes, according to
Breedlove.
The financial future of
Christmas trees is brighter,
however. The tree farm will be
planted on land designated for
Interim Development-Short
Term by the University. Plant
ing will begin early in 1979 and
will be staggered, because the
trees will not reach maturity for
four to five years.

This "choose and cut" tree
farm will necessitate few im
provements on the land. Any
water needed by the operation
will have to be brought in, ac
cording to Summers, and ac
cess roads will be made.
The University retains the
right of termination over the
lease however, and has control
over any improvements.
Breedlove said a lease of this
type is usually from 40 to 60
pages long.
Other than a 21-acre Christ
mas tree farm on University
land near Portola Valley, this
144Â»acre site will be the closest
"choose and cut" operation to
campus. Breedlove said that
most other tree farms of this
type were near Skyline Drive.
Human Biology Prof. Herb
Dengler, who teaches a course
on Bay Area history, said he
feels if income is to be derived
from the land, this is probably
"the gentlest kind of treat
ment."
When cattle grazing opera
tions roam the oak woodlands
of these hills they eat all the
small oak seedlings, said De
ngler. Christmas trees, how
ever, should allow for the re
generation of oak trees.
Communities surrounding
the site, including Menlo Park,
Portola Valley and Woodside
also approved of the project.
A large portion of the Uni
versity's agricultural land may
remain in a deficit position.
Much of it, such as the 1990
acre Piers Ranch lease, which
encompasses the radar dish is a
part of Academic Reserve and
is land which must be held for
future academic use.
The horse and cattle grazing
operations on this acreage,
while not money-makers, do
suit the University's so-called
"midnight convertability" re
quirement. This policy limits
land use in the Academic Re
serve to projects which may be
removed easily and within a
short period of time. Long term
leases or ventures involving
capital improvements are not
made in these areas.
The land for the tree farm is
available for longer leases, but
still implies a convertability re
quirement. Summers said if
the lease were terminated, the
firm would have to remove all
trees and stumps, leaving the
land as it was before.
