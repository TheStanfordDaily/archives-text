COMMITTEE ON RESEARCH
OPEN MEETING ON
"EQUALTREATMENT"CLAUSE
IN FOREIGN RESEARCH CONTRACTS
12:30 to 2:30 p.m., Monday, October 9
Forum Room, Meyer Library
BACKGROUND: Stanford University's foreign contracts contain a clause that
the sponsor "will not discriminate against any employee or agent of Stanford
who performs services under this agreement because of race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin."
A foreign country which excludes entry to citizens of several other countries
as a matter of foreign policy questions whether the term "national origin" ap
plies to citizenship as well as place of birth or ancestry.
This might create a conflict between the faculty's right to obtain research
support from a variety of sources and students' rights of access to all
educational and research opportunities at Stanford. Comments are welcome,
both in person at the meeting or in writing prior to the meeting. They should be
addressed to Pat Devaney, c/o Committee on Research, Building one (Ext. 7-
3763).
