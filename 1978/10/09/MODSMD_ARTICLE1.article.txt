# 1400 participate in midday Great Race

### BRADLEY CRYSTAL 
Over 1400 Stanford students, fa
culty and outsiders put on a tre
mendous show of leg power yester
day at the first annual "Great Race"
to benefit the Cardinal Club wo
men's athletic scholarship program.
Tied for first place in the four mile
mini-marathon, sponsored by West
ern Federal Savings Bank, were area
residents Tom Holl, 23, and Ramsey
Thomas, 35, a one-time graduate
student here. They completed the
course which began and ended at the
Stanford Barn, in 19:50.
Thomas, who runs about 60 miles a
week and has clocked the mile at
4:11, called the noon run "brutal."
Thomas said he planned to spend the
remainder of the day resting and vis
iting three of his former students
who are now freshmen here.
Thomas, like most involved with
the race, expressed a great deal of
praise for the Cardinal Club and the
cause of women's athletics in gen

eral. The Club currently provides 33
scholarships in eight varsity women's
sports: basketball, swimming and
diving, volleyball, cross-country,
gymnastics, tennis, golf and field
hockey.
All proceeds earned through entry
fees ($1 for students, $3 for others)
will go to support these programs.
Prizes for first, second and third
place in each of the 12 divisions were
$20, $15 and $10 Stanford Bookstore
gift certificates.
The divisions, which were sepa
rated into mens and womens
categories, included: three different
age groups, separate undergraduate
classes, graduate students, faculty
and staff, and living groups.
Winners in the male divisions
ranged from Thomas and Holl in first
place to Tony Circi who took third
place in the boys 14 and under divi
sion and 114 overall.
