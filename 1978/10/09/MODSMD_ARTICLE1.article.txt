# 1400 participate in midday Great Race
## 
### BRADLEY CRYSTAL 
Over 1400 Stanford students, fa
culty and outsiders put on a tre
mendous show of leg power yester
day at the first annual "Great Race"
to benefit the Cardinal Club wo
men's athletic scholarship program.
Tied for first place in the four mile
mini-marathon, sponsored by West
ern Federal Savings Bank, were area
residents Tom Holl, 23, and Ramsey
Thomas, 35, a one-time graduate
student here. They completed the
course which began and ended at the
Stanford Barn, in 19:50.
Thomas, who runs about 60 miles a
week and has clocked the mile at
4:11, called the noon run "brutal."
Thomas said he planned to spend the
remainder of the day resting and vis
iting three of his former students
who are now freshmen here.
Thomas, like most involved with
the race, expressed a great deal of
praise for the Cardinal Club and the
cause of women's athletics in gen

eral. The Club currently provides 33
scholarships in eight varsity women's
sports: basketball, swimming and
diving, volleyball, cross-country,
gymnastics, tennis, golf and field
hockey.
All proceeds earned through entry
fees ($1 for students, $3 for others)
will go to support these programs.
Prizes for first, second and third
place in each of the 12 divisions were
$20, $15 and $10 Stanford Bookstore
gift certificates.
The divisions, which were sepa
rated into mens and womens
categories, included: three different
age groups, separate undergraduate
classes, graduate students, faculty
and staff, and living groups.
Winners in the male divisions
ranged from Thomas and Holl in first
place to Tony Circi who took third
place in the boys 14 and under divi
sion and 114 overall.

ranged from senior Ann Thrupp who
placed 103 overall, to junior Lisa
Hollman who placed third in her di
vision and 608 overall.
According to Peter Michon, head
of the West Valley Track Club, which
helped oversee the proceedings, 80
percent of the 1400 runners were
men and 75 percent were students
and faculty.
Although the turnout was ex
pected to be less than 1000, the
balmy 80 degree weather drew sev
eral hundred participants who had
not preregistered.
All entrants will be awarded a
Great Race T-shirt, according to
Western Federal officials. Those who
did not receive a shirt Sunday can
obtain one later this week in the
Stanford Barn office.
Western Federal Bank executives

were well represented among the
contestants President Hugh Evans,
Jr., Stanford class of '53 and Vice
President Counsel, Ed Lynch '51,
both wound up with times under 33
minutes. Although they said they
both work out two to three times a
week for up to four miles, neither
had done any running at the Univer
sity.
Some of the most notable faculty
members were on hand for the event
both to compete and officiate. Most
of these said they counted them
selves among the "Angel Field An
cients" a running club of faculty aged
from 35 to 60, founded 15 years ago
by Electrical Engineering Prof. Alan
Waterman and Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Cear.
Two of the strongest "Ancient"
finishers were Slavic Languages Prof.
Richard Schupbach and Heart Dis
ease Prevention Program coor
dinator Peter Wood.
Wood, who came in at 74, said he
runs an average of 35 miles a week. At
50 years old, Wood said he believes
jogging "has become a very good
way to control weight." He terms
obesity a "national problem." Ironi
cally, Wood said he believes the
overweight actually eat less than the
slim. He said he blames lack of exer
cise as a direct cause of weight prob
lems.
Homo sapiens were not the jiiiy
entrants in the race. Sadie, for exam
ple, a female runner in the women's
14 and under division would hardly
take offense if someone called her a
dog. Sadie is a golden retriever,
whose owner, Randy Whitchurch, a
1975 graduate, likes to take her along
on practice runs through Foothill
College.
The "brainchild" of the race was
Western Federal Bank Executive Vice
President Henry Duque, a 1954 Stan
ford graduate. Desiring to promote
an athletic scholarship through a
mini-marathon event, Duque said he
approached retiring Athletic Direc
tor Joe Ruetz to find a suitable be
neficiary. Ruetz said he believed it
appropriate to help the Cardinal
Club in order to balance the de
ficiencies of women's athletics here.
"The Cardinal Club is a struggling
organization which started 44 years
after most men's scholarships here
were developed," said Ruetz.
Duque said his idea to host a race
was based on the success of a similar
race from Los Gatos to Saratoga last
January.
According to Duque, Western
Federal will augment the money
raised in entry fees from this race
with a "four-figure gift," which is as
yet, undetermined.
"I do have a vested interest in wo
men'sathletics," said Duque. "I have
three daughters as does the presi
dent of Western Federal. This has
something to do with our thinking."

mini-marathon event, Duque said he
approached retiring Athletic Direc
tor Joe Ruetz to find a suitable be
neficiary. Ruetz said he believed it
appropriate to help the Cardinal
Club in order to balance the de
ficiencies of women's athletics here.
"The Cardinal Club is a struggling
organization which started 44 years
after most men's scholarships here
were developed," said Ruetz.
Duque said his idea to host a race
was based on the success of a similar
race from Los Gatos to Saratoga last
January.
According to Duque, Western
Federal will augment the money
raised in entry fees from this race
with a "four-figure gift," which is as
yet, undetermined.
"I do have a vested interest in wo
men'sathletics," said Duque. "I have
three daughters as does the presi
dent of Western Federal. This has
something to do with our thinking."
Over 1400 Stanford students, fa
culty and outsiders put on a tre
mendous show of leg power yester
day at the first annual "Great Race"
to benefit the Cardinal Club wo
men's athletic scholarship program.
Tied for first place in the four mile
mini-marathon, sponsored by West
ern Federal Savings Bank, were area
residents Tom Holl, 23, and Ramsey
Thomas, 35, a one-time graduate
student here. They completed the
course which began and ended at the
Stanford Barn, in 19:50.
Thomas, who runs about 60 miles a
week and has clocked the mile at
4:11, called the noon run "brutal."
Thomas said he planned to spend the
remainder of the day resting and vis
iting three of his former students
who are now freshmen here.
Thomas, like most involved with
the race, expressed a great deal of
praise for the Cardinal Club and the
cause of women's athletics in gen

eral. The Club currently provides 33
scholarships in eight varsity women's
sports: basketball, swimming and
diving, volleyball, cross-country,
gymnastics, tennis, golf and field
hockey.
All proceeds earned through entry
fees ($1 for students, $3 for others)
will go to support these programs.
Prizes for first, second and third
place in each of the 12 divisions were
$20, $15 and $10 Stanford Bookstore
gift certificates.
The divisions, which were sepa
rated into mens and womens
categories, included: three different
age groups, separate undergraduate
classes, graduate students, faculty
and staff, and living groups.
Winners in the male divisions
ranged from Thomas and Holl in first
place to Tony Circi who took third
place in the boys 14 and under divi
sion and 114 overall.
Winners in the female divisions

ranged from senior Ann Thrupp who
placed 103 overall, to junior Lisa
Hollman who placed third in her di
vision and 608 overall.
According to Peter Michon, head
of the West Valley Track Club, which
helped oversee the proceedings, 80
percent of the 1400 runners were
men and 75 percent were students
and faculty.
Although the turnout was ex
pected to be less than 1000, the
balmy 80 degree weather drew sev
eral hundred participants who had
not preregistered.
All entrants will be awarded a
Great Race T-shirt, according to
Western Federal officials. Those who
did not receive a shirt Sunday can
obtain one later this week in the
Stanford Barn office.
Western Federal Bank executives

were well represented among the
contestants President Hugh Evans,
Jr., Stanford class of '53 and Vice
President Counsel, Ed Lynch '51,
both wound up with times under 33
minutes. Although they said they
both work out two to three times a
week for up to four miles, neither
had done any running at the Univer
sity.
Some of the most notable faculty
members were on hand for the event
both to compete and officiate. Most
of these said they counted them
selves among the "Angel Field An
cients" a running club of faculty aged
from 35 to 60, founded 15 years ago
by Electrical Engineering Prof. Alan
Waterman and Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Cear.
Two of the strongest "Ancient"
finishers were Slavic Languages Prof.
Richard Schupbach and Heart Dis
ease Prevention Program coor
dinator Peter Wood.
Wood, who came in at 74, said he
runs an average of 35 miles a week. At
50 years old, Wood said he believes
jogging "has become a very good
way to control weight." He terms
obesity a "national problem." Ironi
cally, Wood said he believes the
overweight actually eat less than the
slim. He said he blames lack of exer
cise as a direct cause of weight prob
lems.
Homo sapiens were not the jiiiy
entrants in the race. Sadie, for exam
ple, a female runner in the women's
14 and under division would hardly
take offense if someone called her a
dog. Sadie is a golden retriever,
whose owner, Randy Whitchurch, a
1975 graduate, likes to take her along
on practice runs through Foothill
College.

50 years old, Wood said he believes
jogging "has become a very good
way to control weight." He terms
obesity a "national problem." Ironi
cally, Wood said he believes the
overweight actually eat less than the
slim. He said he blames lack of exer
cise as a direct cause of weight prob
lems.
Homo sapiens were not the jiiiy
entrants in the race. Sadie, for exam
ple, a female runner in the women's
14 and under division would hardly
take offense if someone called her a
dog. Sadie is a golden retriever,
whose owner, Randy Whitchurch, a
1975 graduate, likes to take her along
on practice runs through Foothill
College.
The "brainchild" of the race was
Western Federal Bank Executive Vice
President Henry Duque, a 1954 Stan
ford graduate. Desiring to promote
an athletic scholarship through a
mini-marathon event, Duque said he
approached retiring Athletic Direc
tor Joe Ruetz to find a suitable be
neficiary. Ruetz said he believed it
appropriate to help the Cardinal
Club in order to balance the de
ficiencies of women's athletics here.
"The Cardinal Club is a struggling
organization which started 44 years
after most men's scholarships here
were developed," said Ruetz.
Duque said his idea to host a race
was based on the success of a similar
race from Los Gatos to Saratoga last
January.
According to Duque, Western
Federal will augment the money
raised in entry fees from this race
with a "four-figure gift," which is as
yet, undetermined.
"I do have a vested interest in wo
men'sathletics," said Duque. "I have
three daughters as does the presi
dent of Western Federal. This has
something to do with our thinking."
Over 1400 Stanford students, fa
culty and outsiders put on a tre
mendous show of leg power yester
day at the first annual "Great Race"
to benefit the Cardinal Club wo
men's athletic scholarship program.
Tied for first place in the four mile
mini-marathon, sponsored by West
ern Federal Savings Bank, were area
residents Tom Holl, 23, and Ramsey
Thomas, 35, a one-time graduate
student here. They completed the
course which began and ended at the
Stanford Barn, in 19:50.
Thomas, who runs about 60 miles a
week and has clocked the mile at
4:11, called the noon run "brutal."
Thomas said he planned to spend the
remainder of the day resting and vis
iting three of his former students
who are now freshmen here.
Thomas, like most involved with
the race, expressed a great deal of
praise for the Cardinal Club and the
cause of women's athletics in gen

eral. The Club currently provides 33
scholarships in eight varsity women's
sports: basketball, swimming and
diving, volleyball, cross-country,
gymnastics, tennis, golf and field
hockey.
All proceeds earned through entry
fees ($1 for students, $3 for others)
will go to support these programs.
Prizes for first, second and third
place in each of the 12 divisions were
$20, $15 and $10 Stanford Bookstore
gift certificates.
The divisions, which were sepa
rated into mens and womens
categories, included: three different
age groups, separate undergraduate
classes, graduate students, faculty
and staff, and living groups.
Winners in the male divisions
ranged from Thomas and Holl in first
place to Tony Circi who took third
place in the boys 14 and under divi
sion and 114 overall.

ranged from senior Ann Thrupp who
placed 103 overall, to junior Lisa
Hollman who placed third in her di
vision and 608 overall.
According to Peter Michon, head
of the West Valley Track Club, which
helped oversee the proceedings, 80
percent of the 1400 runners were
men and 75 percent were students
and faculty.
Although the turnout was ex
pected to be less than 1000, the
balmy 80 degree weather drew sev
eral hundred participants who had
not preregistered.
All entrants will be awarded a
Great Race T-shirt, according to
Western Federal officials. Those who
did not receive a shirt Sunday can
obtain one later this week in the
Stanford Barn office.
Western Federal Bank executives

were well represented among the
contestants President Hugh Evans,
Jr., Stanford class of '53 and Vice
President Counsel, Ed Lynch '51,
both wound up with times under 33
minutes. Although they said they
both work out two to three times a
week for up to four miles, neither
had done any running at the Univer
sity.
Some of the most notable faculty
members were on hand for the event
both to compete and officiate. Most
of these said they counted them
selves among the "Angel Field An
cients" a running club of faculty aged
from 35 to 60, founded 15 years ago
by Electrical Engineering Prof. Alan
Waterman and Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Cear.
Two of the strongest "Ancient"
finishers were Slavic Languages Prof.
Richard Schupbach and Heart Dis
ease Prevention Program coor
dinator Peter Wood.
