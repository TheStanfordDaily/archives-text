## ASSU Senate: an overview 
### 
As the ASSU Senate elections approach,
University hacks may once again count on
the fleeting attention of some of us who
watch with a mixture of fascination and
revulsion.
The gush of ideals that swept the Stan
ford Organizing Committee last autumn to
dominance was dashed. Supporters' most
basic expectations were left unsatisfied;
but worse than this lack of a legacy was the
more tangible, bitter aftertaste created by
the continuous haggling and recrimina
tion within the slate itself. The first few
meetings stripped away the apolitical
guise of the new leadership, laying bare an
intense, partisan bias. Because of their
frankly hostile attitude, not only towards
authority, but also to one another, the
SOC leadership, and hence the senate,
became a nonentity, unable and unwilling
to function within the existing power
structure; and the heavy boot of SOC
soon looked more like the naked foot of
an upset infant, kicking spasmodically.
But the dispute and its unilateral, im
posed solution was a judgment not just
against last year's senate, but more cer
tainly about the very framework of student
input at our University. And this is de
cidedly the most basic question facing this
year's ASSU candidates.
For if the senate, and by implication, the
ASSU, cannot determine, or even influ
ence, matters explicitly within the jurisdic
tion of its constitution, what conceivable
impact can such a body, and the students it
purports to represent, have on really con
sequential campus issues like tuition,
minority admissions, faculty tenure, fi
nancial aid, and student housing?
Last winter's clash with Lyman, in the
context of a particularly fatuous and thus
disastrous year for the senate, has unques
tionably left the body more starkly debili
tated than ever before. Most apparent is its
reduced stature as a constitutionally
legitimate expression of student opinion.
And its symbolic, political power, and that

of its members, in working credibly with
other power centers in the University
community, is equally affected.
But more important than either of these
is the serious, negative effect of all of this
on student hopes, if any remain at all,
about the senate and its usefulness to
them. The insidious attitude of those who
instinctively and often unfairly scorn all
student government as ineffective, self
centered, and pointless, has in this past
year been unfortunately bolstered and
even justified.
CRAP is an outgrowth of this bare cyni
cism, and the initial support it has received
reveals another feeling that is more wide
spread: simple disillusion.

How can opportunity arise
from the ashes of disillu
sion and apathy?

Such sentiment is sadly reflected on the
candidate's side, too. The number of un
dergraduate aspirants is down drastically,
to barely more than a third of the level of
only two years ago. Among graduate stu
dents, interest seems even more dismal
than usual: only five people have filed for
the 20 available positons, and three of
those five are running on the CRAP slate.
The few candidates who remain dedi
cated to the concept of a participatory stu
dent government thus suffer a unique
burden. But they also may face a real op
portunity, if they wish to make it so.
How can opportunity arise from the
ashes of disillusion and apathy?
In the first place, it is certainly true that
the great majority of students here would
prefer and appreciate a senate that
functioned effectively in airing their con
cerns, and more importantly, in working
towards a constructive solution rather
than pointless and fruitless confrontation.

To achieve positive results, our next
senators need desperately to free them
selves and the issues they pursue from the
very same infestation that is killing the se
nate as an institution: the infestation of
style, which in the past has utterly disabled
any honest effort to produce substance.
Examples of the essential symbolism of
the senate are only too rampant.
Sharply-worded resolutions on various
world and campus crises have flowed
more or less profusely, depending on
which slate was dominant. But how often
do cordial, backstage meetings take place
among student, faculty, and administra
tive leaders? When did a slate last organize
after election to ensure the passage of a
comprehensive legislative program as
promised? How long has it been since a
senate meeting was free of some axe
grinding idealogues trumpeting the latest
change in the world order?
If the senate were to try, just once, to
assume a bit of political sophistication, to
dig beneath superficiality and invective, to
operate behind the printed word, to work
with rather than against, to listen and
perhaps even to compromise, fiascos such
as last winter's collision with President
Lyman, and extreme proposals such as
CRAP would not be possible.
Just as important, good will on the part
of students toward their senate would al
most certainly be reciprocated by the Uni
versity administration, which in all likeli
hood is only too eager to deal with ra
tional, considerate campus leaders.
There is much to be gained by giving
such methods a fair chance. Success
would not be immediate nor spectacular,
but it might be real, especially if careful
and concrete plans are laid and followed.
And all in all, there is little to lose but the
senate itself, which at this point, is very
little indeed.

intense, partisan bias. Because of their
frankly hostile attitude, not only towards
authority, but also to one another, the
SOC leadership, and hence the senate,
became a nonentity, unable and unwilling
to function within the existing power
structure; and the heavy boot of SOC
soon looked more like the naked foot of
an upset infant, kicking spasmodically.
But the dispute and its unilateral, im
posed solution was a judgment not just
against last year's senate, but more cer
tainly about the very framework of student
input at our University. And this is de
cidedly the most basic question facing this
year's ASSU candidates.
For if the senate, and by implication, the
ASSU, cannot determine, or even influ
ence, matters explicitly within the jurisdic
tion of its constitution, what conceivable
impact can such a body, and the students it
purports to represent, have on really con
sequential campus issues like tuition,
minority admissions, faculty tenure, fi
nancial aid, and student housing?
Last winter's clash with Lyman, in the
context of a particularly fatuous and thus
disastrous year for the senate, has unques
tionably left the body more starkly debili
tated than ever before. Most apparent is its
reduced stature as a constitutionally
legitimate expression of student opinion.
And its symbolic, political power, and that

of its members, in working credibly with
other power centers in the University
community, is equally affected.
But more important than either of these
is the serious, negative effect of all of this
on student hopes, if any remain at all,
about the senate and its usefulness to
them. The insidious attitude of those who
instinctively and often unfairly scorn all
student government as ineffective, self
centered, and pointless, has in this past
year been unfortunately bolstered and
even justified.
CRAP is an outgrowth of this bare cyni
cism, and the initial support it has received
reveals another feeling that is more wide
spread: simple disillusion.

How can opportunity arise
from the ashes of disillu
sion and apathy?

Such sentiment is sadly reflected on the
candidate's side, too. The number of un
dergraduate aspirants is down drastically,
to barely more than a third of the level of
only two years ago. Among graduate stu
dents, interest seems even more dismal
than usual: only five people have filed for
the 20 available positons, and three of
those five are running on the CRAP slate.
The few candidates who remain dedi
cated to the concept of a participatory stu
dent government thus suffer a unique
burden. But they also may face a real op
portunity, if they wish to make it so.
How can opportunity arise from the
ashes of disillusion and apathy?
In the first place, it is certainly true that
the great majority of students here would
prefer and appreciate a senate that
functioned effectively in airing their con
cerns, and more importantly, in working
towards a constructive solution rather
than pointless and fruitless confrontation.

To achieve positive results, our next
senators need desperately to free them
selves and the issues they pursue from the
very same infestation that is killing the se
nate as an institution: the infestation of
style, which in the past has utterly disabled
any honest effort to produce substance.
Examples of the essential symbolism of
the senate are only too rampant.
Sharply-worded resolutions on various
world and campus crises have flowed
more or less profusely, depending on
which slate was dominant. But how often
do cordial, backstage meetings take place
among student, faculty, and administra
tive leaders? When did a slate last organize
after election to ensure the passage of a
comprehensive legislative program as
promised? How long has it been since a
senate meeting was free of some axe
grinding idealogues trumpeting the latest
change in the world order?
If the senate were to try, just once, to
assume a bit of political sophistication, to
dig beneath superficiality and invective, to
operate behind the printed word, to work
with rather than against, to listen and
perhaps even to compromise, fiascos such
as last winter's collision with President
Lyman, and extreme proposals such as
CRAP would not be possible.
Just as important, good will on the part
of students toward their senate would al
most certainly be reciprocated by the Uni
versity administration, which in all likeli
hood is only too eager to deal with ra
tional, considerate campus leaders.
There is much to be gained by giving
such methods a fair chance. Success
would not be immediate nor spectacular,
but it might be real, especially if careful
and concrete plans are laid and followed.
And all in all, there is little to lose but the
senate itself, which at this point, is very
little indeed.

cidedly the most basic question facing this
year's ASSU candidates.
For if the senate, and by implication, the
ASSU, cannot determine, or even influ
ence, matters explicitly within the jurisdic
tion of its constitution, what conceivable
impact can such a body, and the students it
purports to represent, have on really con
sequential campus issues like tuition,
minority admissions, faculty tenure, fi
nancial aid, and student housing?
Last winter's clash with Lyman, in the
context of a particularly fatuous and thus
disastrous year for the senate, has unques
tionably left the body more starkly debili
tated than ever before. Most apparent is its
reduced stature as a constitutionally
legitimate expression of student opinion.
And its symbolic, political power, and that

of its members, in working credibly with
other power centers in the University
community, is equally affected.
But more important than either of these
is the serious, negative effect of all of this
on student hopes, if any remain at all,
about the senate and its usefulness to
them. The insidious attitude of those who
instinctively and often unfairly scorn all
student government as ineffective, self
centered, and pointless, has in this past
year been unfortunately bolstered and
even justified.
CRAP is an outgrowth of this bare cyni
cism, and the initial support it has received
reveals another feeling that is more wide
spread: simple disillusion.

How can opportunity arise
from the ashes of disillu
sion and apathy?

Such sentiment is sadly reflected on the
candidate's side, too. The number of un
dergraduate aspirants is down drastically,
to barely more than a third of the level of
only two years ago. Among graduate stu
dents, interest seems even more dismal
than usual: only five people have filed for
the 20 available positons, and three of
those five are running on the CRAP slate.
The few candidates who remain dedi
cated to the concept of a participatory stu
dent government thus suffer a unique
burden. But they also may face a real op
portunity, if they wish to make it so.
How can opportunity arise from the
ashes of disillusion and apathy?
In the first place, it is certainly true that
the great majority of students here would
prefer and appreciate a senate that
functioned effectively in airing their con
cerns, and more importantly, in working
towards a constructive solution rather
than pointless and fruitless confrontation.

To achieve positive results, our next
senators need desperately to free them
selves and the issues they pursue from the
very same infestation that is killing the se
nate as an institution: the infestation of
style, which in the past has utterly disabled
any honest effort to produce substance.
Examples of the essential symbolism of
the senate are only too rampant.
Sharply-worded resolutions on various
world and campus crises have flowed
more or less profusely, depending on
which slate was dominant. But how often
do cordial, backstage meetings take place
among student, faculty, and administra
tive leaders? When did a slate last organize
after election to ensure the passage of a
comprehensive legislative program as
promised? How long has it been since a
senate meeting was free of some axe
grinding idealogues trumpeting the latest
change in the world order?
If the senate were to try, just once, to
assume a bit of political sophistication, to
dig beneath superficiality and invective, to
operate behind the printed word, to work
with rather than against, to listen and
perhaps even to compromise, fiascos such
as last winter's collision with President
Lyman, and extreme proposals such as
CRAP would not be possible.
Just as important, good will on the part
of students toward their senate would al
most certainly be reciprocated by the Uni
versity administration, which in all likeli
hood is only too eager to deal with ra
tional, considerate campus leaders.
There is much to be gained by giving
such methods a fair chance. Success
would not be immediate nor spectacular,
but it might be real, especially if careful
and concrete plans are laid and followed.
And all in all, there is little to lose but the
senate itself, which at this point, is very
little indeed.
