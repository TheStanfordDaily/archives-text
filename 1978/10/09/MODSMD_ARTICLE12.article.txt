Recent cartoons
distasteful
Your humor ought not to in
sult any group of human be
ings. The recent cartoons by
Chris Juricich ridicule all P.E.
majors. Substitute "Poles,"
"blacks" or "women" for "P.E.
majors" in the cartoons and
you will immediately realize
how distasteful they are. 'Tain't
funny.

No equality
in amendment
I must disagree with Kent Al
len's assertion that the prop
osed constitutional amend
ment would make citizens of
the District of Columbia equal
with citizens of other states. In
fact, the proposed amendment
would:
1) Deny residents of the Dis
trict the protection of the 14th
Amendment.
2) Deny residents of the Dis
trict the right to petition Con
gress for constitutional
amendment under Article V of
the Constitution.
3) Allow Congress to veto vir
tually any action taken by resi
dents of the District since Arti
cle I, Section 17 of the Con
stitution granting Congress the
right of "exclusive legislation"
over the District is untouched
by the amendment.
4) Allow Congress to fill vac
ancies that occur in the con
gressional delegation of the
District.
5) Leave exercise of the Dis
trict's political rights up to the
whims of Congress since the
amendment must be im
plemented by whatever Con
gress deems "appropriate
legislation."
Allen says that "equal is

equal." While I do not wish to
dispute that claim, I certainly
find it hard to believe that this
amendment even comes close
to granting equality to District
residents. If in fact we want to
grant the District the same
rights as residents of the 50
states, then why not simply
admit the District to the Union
as a state? Unfortunately, the
Senate defeated a motion by
Sen. McClure of Idaho to do
just that when it passed the
amendment.
The only other logical way to
give District residents voting
rights is to retrocede the Dis
trict back to Virginia and Mary

land. Allen scores this move as
"irrational." However, there is
a considerable amount of his
torical precedent for such an
action. District residents voted
in these states for the first two
presidential elections in our
history. In the 1860's a substan
tial portion of what was then
the District was retroceded to
Virginia and Maryland. Clearly
retrocession, which would
grant District residents all the
rights of residents of the 50
states, is preferable to per
petuating inequity by adopting
the proposed amendment.

dispute that claim, I certainly
find it hard to believe that this
amendment even comes close
to granting equality to District
residents. If in fact we want to
grant the District the same
rights as residents of the 50
states, then why not simply
admit the District to the Union
as a state? Unfortunately, the
Senate defeated a motion by
Sen. McClure of Idaho to do
just that when it passed the
amendment.
The only other logical way to
give District residents voting
rights is to retrocede the Dis
trict back to Virginia and Mary

land. Allen scores this move as
"irrational." However, there is
a considerable amount of his
torical precedent for such an
action. District residents voted
in these states for the first two
presidential elections in our
history. In the 1860's a substan
tial portion of what was then
the District was retroceded to
Virginia and Maryland. Clearly
retrocession, which would
grant District residents all the
rights of residents of the 50
states, is preferable to per
petuating inequity by adopting
the proposed amendment.

Recent cartoons
distasteful
Your humor ought not to in
sult any group of human be
ings. The recent cartoons by
Chris Juricich ridicule all P.E.
majors. Substitute "Poles,"
"blacks" or "women" for "P.E.
majors" in the cartoons and
you will immediately realize
how distasteful they are. 'Tain't
funny.

No equality
in amendment
I must disagree with Kent Al
len's assertion that the prop
osed constitutional amend
ment would make citizens of
the District of Columbia equal
with citizens of other states. In
fact, the proposed amendment
would:
1) Deny residents of the Dis
trict the protection of the 14th
Amendment.
2) Deny residents of the Dis
trict the right to petition Con
gress for constitutional
amendment under Article V of
the Constitution.
3) Allow Congress to veto vir
tually any action taken by resi
dents of the District since Arti
cle I, Section 17 of the Con
stitution granting Congress the
right of "exclusive legislation"
over the District is untouched
by the amendment.
4) Allow Congress to fill vac
ancies that occur in the con
gressional delegation of the
District.
5) Leave exercise of the Dis
trict's political rights up to the
whims of Congress since the
amendment must be im
plemented by whatever Con
gress deems "appropriate
legislation."
Allen says that "equal is

equal." While I do not wish to
dispute that claim, I certainly
find it hard to believe that this
amendment even comes close
to granting equality to District
residents. If in fact we want to
grant the District the same
rights as residents of the 50
states, then why not simply
admit the District to the Union
