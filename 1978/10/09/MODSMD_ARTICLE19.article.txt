## Spikers nip UOP 
### PETER FINCH 
Stanford coach Fred Sturm
and the women's volleyball
team made Friday night's
match at Pacific as close as they
possibly could, but managed
to escape with a victory.
According to assistant coach
John Bekins, the women won
the first two games fairly easily.
Pacific went down 15-7 in the
first game and lost 15-13 in the
second. "Then," Bekins said,
"we came out expecting to
blow them away."
UOP proceeded to take the
next two games 15-17 and 8-15
from the Cards, and sent the
match into the fifth and deci
sive game. The two losses

were, according to Bekins, due
to passive setting and hitting.
"We kind of expected them to
lay down. We finally realized
that they weren't going to beat
themselves," he said.
The fifth game, with side-out
after side-out, took a full hour
to complete. With solid out
side play from sophomore
Chris Anderson, fine setting by
Shawn Hoover and Jan Linden
and good hitting from Ciridy
Whitaker, the Cards were able
to grab a 19-17 overtime victory
to win the match.
The Card spikers now are 2-1
in dual match play. Their next
match is against Santa Clara
Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
