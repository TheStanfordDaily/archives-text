# Senate hopefuls debate election issues
## 
### VANCE MASON MONIKA GUTTMAN 
Election reform, student involvement in ASSU
Senate activities and the impact of the Committee
to Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) were the major
issues discussed yesterday afternoon at the first
annual press conference for ASSU Senate candi
dates.
Representatives from various campus publica
tions were present to question the candidates dur
ing the debate, which was held in American
S.tudies house and taped for broadcast on KZSU
tonight at 7:30 p.m.
Alex Alben, Tim Draper, Ted Gardenswartz,
Tom Gart, Ron Johnson and Brett Kingstone from
the Kingstone/Gary Fremerman slate were among
the undergraduate candidates present. Others in
cluded John Struthers, Erik Thompson, Mide Wil
key and Ron Sargis of the Sargis/David Stuer slate.
Geoff Baskir was the only graduate candidate pre
sent.
Senate vs. CRAP
In the past, candidates have only had to concen
trate on their own campaigns. But this year, the
candidates have had to defend the existence of the
senate as a viable institution, due mostly to the

controversial CRAP amendment proposal.
The majority maintained that the senate's image
has been hurt by the past performance of large
slates, such as SOC (Stanford Organizing Commit
tee) and Hammer and Coffin, which dominated
senate politics. All candidates stressed the need
for diversity and wide student representation.
"Students have lost faith in the senate," said
Gardenswartz. "Individuals should be given a
chance to prove themselves to the students."
"There should be reform of the senate, not abol
ition," said Struthers.
Most of the candidates stressed the need to get
more students involved.
"I think we ought to put the energy of the cam
paigns back into the dorms so they won't see
senators only during election time," said Alben.
Draper said he has put his phone number and
residence on all his flyers in an effort to encourage
student input into the senate decision-making
process.
Mike Roberts and ex-senator Doug Bandow,
members of the campaign for the CRAP amend
ment, challenged the candidates on their com
mitment and dedication to the senate.
"Sure, you talk of reforms and getting people

interested," said Roberts, "but what if it bombs?
How can we be sure it won't be the same garbage
as last year?"
"That's a crappy question," responded Cart.
"No avenue for student representation at all is
wrong."
"The students need representation," said
Draper. "There should be checks and balances.
The COP (Council of Presidents) is too narrow a
range of opinions."
Other candidates referred to the CRAP amend
ment as a "healthy" influence in the senatorial
campaigns.
"The move to restrict the senate has helped
candidates to define their roles," said Alben. "The
student body needs to reduce its expectations of
the ASSU."
Most candidates said they felt the senate should
concentrate on local issues rather than problems
over which they have no control, such as most
national and global issues.
"We have no time for world affairs," said Gar
denswartz. "If senators have personal opinions
(on these issues) they should express them out
side the ASSU, and save the senate for student
issues."
