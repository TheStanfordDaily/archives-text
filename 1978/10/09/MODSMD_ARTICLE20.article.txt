# Stanford wins big down south
## Poloists rip USC, UCLA 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
The Stanford water polo
team performed its version of
cleaning up Southern Califor
nia over the weekend, crush
ing both USC and UCLA in
their home pools.
Friday afternoon, the Trojans
fell victim to an effective Car
dinal fast-break, bowing to
Stanford, 10-2. Freshman Jody
Campbell led the offensive ef
fort for Stanford, scoring four
times, twice from the hole pos
ition.
"We can always score off our
fast-break," Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamenti said. "We
count on getting two or three
goals a game from it."
The Cardinal defense,
meanwhile, limited USCtoone
goal in each half and helf the
Trojans' two top goal men —
Zarh Stimson and Les Wulk —
scoreless in the contest. Goalie
John Gansel anchored the de
fense with 12 saves, includinga
blocked penalty shot.
"It was John's best game of
the year," Dettamenti said.
At UCLA Saturday morning,
the Cards got off to a slow start,

leading the Bruins 2-1 at the
end of the first quarter. But
three Cardinal goals in the first
three minutes of the second
period gave Stanford a lead
which was never challenged
again. By halftimeitwas 8-2 and
the Cards' second unit, playing
nearly the entire second half,
held the Bruins scoreless while
adding four more goals to the
Stanford total.

"Our second unit could
probably beat three-fouths of
the college teams around,"
Dettamanti said.
The Cardinals called on
"freshman power" once again
to deliver the death stroke to
their opponents. Chris Kelsey,
a freshman from Hermosa
Beach, wielded the knife
against the Bruins, coming off
the bench to score three goals
in the second quarter for Stan
ford.
"In the first quarter, we had
no patience," Dettamanti said.
"We weren't taking good
shots.
"Kelsey came off the bench
and sparked us," he added.
"I just did my job,"
explained Kelsey after the
game.
The two victories give Stan
ford an undefeated 12-0-1 re
cord overall and a 3-0 mark in
Pacific-10 play.
"We're just getting it to
gether now," Dettamanti said.
"When we play the way we're
capable of, we can blow any
body out. That's what hap
pened this weekend."
