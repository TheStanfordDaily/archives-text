# Scotchers fall to San Jose State, 1-0
## 
### JULIE HILL SHARON SILVERSTEIN 
After battling to a standstill for more than an hour, top-ranked
San )ose State handed the Cardinal field hockey team a 1-0 loss in
the last few minutes of Saturday's game.
Despite outshooting Stanford 24-2, the San Jose offense spent
most of the game between the 25 yard line and the striking circle.
Without constant pressure near the goal, netminder Buffie
Berger recorded nine saves.
San Jose began to take charge of the action at the start of the
first half, but Stanford responded and neutralized San Jose
throughout the rest of the game. Freshman Lynn Keyser showed
promise as she provided the team with clutch defensive plays.
However, the Card offense failed to get untracked, relying
heavily on the defense to set up the attack. Their lack of momen
tum was exploited by the aggressive Spartan midfield, led by
sophomore All-America candidate Pommey McFarlane.
"On offense we went to the wings because she is so effective at
clogging up the middle," Stanford coach Barbara Longstreth said.
Captain Amanda Read did an exemplary job of marking McFar
lane throughout the contest.
The general attitude surrounding the Cardinal post-game con
gregation was one of upbeat excitement at the caliber of team
play. Instrumental back Nancy Jackson said enthusiastically,
"We're really excited! We improved 10-fold from last week.
We're gonna go to the nationals."
Their strong showing against traditional rival San Jose bodes
well for the Cards, who will have a chance to avenge their loss in
the regionals. Last year Stanford finished second in the post
season tournament, falling behind only San Jose. The Spartans
have eight veteran seniors returned from their championship
squad, which finished fourth at nationals last year.
The Cards, now 1-1 in NCAC standings, host Pacific Wednesday
at Roble Field.
