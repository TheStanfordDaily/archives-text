# Malmuth to offer dance-culture class
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
"In the United States, dance
is considered solely a form of
recreation, but in other coun
tries, it is actually indispensa
ble to the religious and social
aspects of a nation," said Ann
Malmuth.
Malmuth is teaching a new
course at Stanford that will
explore other aspects of the
art. The class, which is being
sponsored through Bechtel In
ternational Center, will ap
proach cross-cultural dance
through several perspectives,
with the emphasis on learning
other-culture forms of move
ment and utilizing improvisa
tion to explore dancers' own
use of space and weight.
Malmuth herself has been
exposed to quite a few cul
tures. As a freshman at UCLA,
she had contact with Margalit
Oved who helped found the
Inbal Dance Theater of Israel.
Oved encouraged Malmuth to
goto Israel, which she did after
completing her sophomore
year at Stanford. Originally

planning a much shorter slay,
Malmuth spent three years
touring Israel and South
America, learning and per
forming the Yemenite style of
dance.
Upon her return to the Un
ited States, Malmuth re
searched Moroccan and Be
douin cultures and the impact
of dance on them. She also re
turned to Stanford and
graduated with a B.A. in an
thropology. Last year Malmuth
received an M.A. in dance from
Stanford.
The evidence of a society's
impact on its people is appa
rent in the dance that culture
creates. In the case of the
Yemenites, who were confined
in ghettos, the movements are
by necessity adaptable to small
spaces.
The class will be offered at
the International Center every
Tuesday beginning tomorrow
from 5:30 to 7 p.m. The cost is
$12 and no experience is
necessary. Students may sign
up the first day of class.
