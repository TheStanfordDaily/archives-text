# Booters tip Fresno as defense shines

### DEAN EYRE 
Sanger-ln contrast to previous Stanfordvictories, which scores
required two hands worth of fingers or half a sheet of paper to
keep track, Saturday's win over Fresno State was a 1-0 affair.
The victory raises the Cardii al's record to 7-1, while the
Bulldogs drop to 1-5.
After almost 75 minutes of scoreless play, Peter Phillips passed
to senior forward Paul Kozachenko, who placed a shot in the
corner of the net.
"The cross he (Phillips) gave me was perfect, right on the
money,'" three-year letterman Kozachenko said. "He beat three
guys, brought it down and crossed it. You have to have confi
dence to do that. As soon as we started finding out where their
weaknesses were we started exploiting them."
Card assistant coach Phil Wright explained his team's strategy
as being "intelligent — the team did what was right, which is to
stay back and play defense. You don't want to get down 1-0 away
from home."
Stanford head coach Nelson Lodge singled out "finishing" as
the major difference between the two clubs. "They (Fresno)
would bring the ball down and flounder; we would bring it down
and at least strike at the goal. They probably brought the ball
down better than we did but they didn't finish it with a shot," he
said.
Unlike previous games where the Cards' offensive barrage
would outpace the opponents, it was a stellar defense that made
the difference against Fresno.
"Fresno made two excellent strikes at our goal and (Craig)
Ueland did an excellent job of covering himself back there,"
Lodge said.
"Craig did an outstanding job," said Wright. "His best asset is
his speed coming out of the goal — this is a team that played fast
break on a small field and he really snuffed it. (Greg) Delgado
played outstanding — just the way we have been expecting him to
play all season, winning 15 of 16 head balls."
Stanford travels to Hayward State tomorrow for a 3 p.m.
match-up.
