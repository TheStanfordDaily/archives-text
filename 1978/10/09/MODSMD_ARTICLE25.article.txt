# Harriers win at home; women falter on road

Despite near misses with
golf carts and golf balls, the
men's cross country team de
stroyed Humbolt State 17-39 at
the Stanford Golf Course
Saturday.
Three miles into the five
mile race, senior Roy Kissin,
crashed into an angry golfer
and his golf cart on the lower
bridge. Finding no other alter
native, Kissin hurtled over the
cart, and went on to lead the
Cards to their first victory.
Performing up to par, the
Cards finished one, two, three
and four. "It was a real good
team effort," Stanford coach
Dean Clark said. "We ran ac
cording to plan."
The Cards' strategy, said
Clark, was to run as a group for
the first mile and then to take
off. Humbolt did a good job of
sticking with the pack for the
first part of the race, but the
Card runners were too strong
in the end.
A little more than a hundred
yards left in the race, Stan
ford's Bill Haldeman, the sur
prise of the week, summoned
enough energy to pass a Hum
bolt State runner to finish
fourth in a time of 26:30.
Jerry Emory also ran a good

race. In what Emory termed a
"fluke," he finished 54th in the
Fresno Invitational. Saturday,
however, Emory ran confi
dently and finished third with a
time of 26:26.2.
Kissin finished first in a time
of 26:14.6. Kissin, recovering
from a viral infection, has only
been training for three weeks.
Also placing for the Cards
were Rod Berry, second
(26:19.4); and Tom Lobsinger,
seventh (26:40).
The women's team expected
a tough race, and that's exactly
what it got in Berkeley Satur
day.
Stanford finished eighth out
of nine teams.
"I don't think there is
another cross country meet
like this in the nation before
nationals," said coach Laurel
Treon.
Ann Thrupp again finished
first for the Cards in the
three-mile race, and 25th over
all, in a time of 19:15.8. Round
ing out the top five scorers for
Stanford were Susan Bragdon,
37th; Annette Mungai, 56th;
Beth Harrison, 59th and Joanne
Ernst, 65th.
Both the men and the
women will be at home Satur
day, hosting the annual Stan
ford Invitational.

cording to plan."
The Cards' strategy, said
Clark, was to run as a group for
the first mile and then to take
off. Humbolt did a good job of
sticking with the pack for the
first part of the race, but the
Card runners were too strong
in the end.
A little more than a hundred
yards left in the race, Stan
ford's Bill Haldeman, the sur
prise of the week, summoned
enough energy to pass a Hum
bolt State runner to finish
fourth in a time of 26:30.
Jerry Emory also ran a good

race. In what Emory termed a
"fluke," he finished 54th in the
Fresno Invitational. Saturday,
however, Emory ran confi
dently and finished third with a
time of 26:26.2.
Kissin finished first in a time
of 26:14.6. Kissin, recovering
from a viral infection, has only
been training for three weeks.
Also placing for the Cards
were Rod Berry, second
(26:19.4); and Tom Lobsinger,
seventh (26:40).
The women's team expected
a tough race, and that's exactly
what it got in Berkeley Satur
day.
Stanford finished eighth out
of nine teams.
"I don't think there is
another cross country meet
like this in the nation before
nationals," said coach Laurel
Treon.
Ann Thrupp again finished
first for the Cards in the
three-mile race, and 25th over
all, in a time of 19:15.8. Round
ing out the top five scorers for
Stanford were Susan Bragdon,
37th; Annette Mungai, 56th;
Beth Harrison, 59th and Joanne
Ernst, 65th.
Both the men and the
women will be at home Satur
day, hosting the annual Stan
ford Invitational.

Sophomore Tom Lobsinger races across the
Stanford Golf Course during the Cards' 17-39
pasting of Humboldt State Saturday. Lobsinger
finished the five-mile race seventh in a time of
26:20.
Despite near misses with
golf carts and golf balls, the
men's cross country team de
stroyed Humbolt State 17-39 at
the Stanford Golf Course
Saturday.
Three miles into the five
mile race, senior Roy Kissin,
crashed into an angry golfer
and his golf cart on the lower
bridge. Finding no other alter
native, Kissin hurtled over the
cart, and went on to lead the
Cards to their first victory.
Performing up to par, the
Cards finished one, two, three
and four. "It was a real good
team effort," Stanford coach
Dean Clark said. "We ran ac
cording to plan."
