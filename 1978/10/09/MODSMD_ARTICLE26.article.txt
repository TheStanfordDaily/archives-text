Cease-fire holding in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — East Beirut's Christians
emerged cautiously from their basement shelters
for the first time in 10 days yesterday as a Syrian-
Christian cease-fire appeared to be holding, ex
cept for an isolated outbreak of sniper fire.
Beirut police estimated that 1300 Lebanese were
killed and more than 2000 wounded in the 10 days
of fighting. The Syrians have not reported their
casualties.
Political leaders in this half-Moslem, half-
Christian nation were skeptical about the chances
for success of the truce, declared Saturday, unless
the talks between President Elias Sarkis and Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus produce an
overall agreement.
"If we do not reach an agreement here, no one
will," Assad told reporters in Damascus Saturday
night. "We shall continue to try even if it takes us
10 sessions."
The remark was a blow to some Christians who
hope the conflict will be settled not between Sar
kis and Assad in Damascus but by an international
effort.
Liberals promise tax reform
Washington — Liberal tax activists, facing a heavy
schedule of Proposition 13-style initiatives and re
ferenda on Election Day next month, are vowing to
wrestle the tax issue from conservatives.
Their battle cry is a call for "tax justice," essen
tially an increase in corporate tax collections and a
redistribution of the tax burden from lower- and
middle-income families, where property taxes hit
hardest, to wealthier taxpayers.
A weekend tax conference convened by the Na
tional Conference on Alternative State and Local
Public Policies revealed frustration among tax offi
cials faced with across-the-board tax cuts along the
lines of California's Proposition 13.
"Tax cutting is not tax reform," says Byron Dor
gan, the North Dakota tax commissioner. "Tax
limitation has nothing to do with tax justice."
Thus, tax observers are anxiously awaiting the

November votes in at least 10 states where tax
relief measures are on the ballot.
Fear of self-rule stalls treaty
Jerusalem — The framework for a Mideast peace
worked out at Camp David is running into serious
trouble in the Israeli-occupied territories slated to
become an autonomous Palestinian enclave under
the accords.
The Palestinians do not seem to be interested in
the limited autonomy offered by the agreements,
fearing self-rule with a continued Israeli military
presence will kill hopes for independence.
The accords envision elections by the 1.1 million
Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza for a "self
governing authority" to replace the military gov
ernment.
The vehement rejection by the Arabs has sur
prised many Israelis, who thought the Palestinians
would be happy to see an end to 11 years of Israeli
military government and the establishment of a
local administration.
The problem now seems so acute that Egyptian-
Israeli negotiators, scheduled to meet Thursday in
Washington to begin working on a bilateral peace
treaty, also are likely to focus on the Palestinian
issue, Israeli officials say.
Gov. ends civil unrest in Iran
Tehran, Iran — Security forces broke up anti
government demonstrations in nine Iranian cities
yesterday, a day after a bloody clash between sol
diers and protesters in the Caspian Sea city of
Bobol reportedly left one person dead and many
others injured. Several hundred demonstrators,
chanting anti-government slogans, rampaged
through the city, damaging banks and liquor
stores and setting fire to a theater.
In Tehran, meanwhile, workers at state-run
hospitals joined the long list of public employees
to strike for higher pay.
At least 50 other government agencies or com

panies are on strike, including the Ministry of Cul
ture and Art, the justice Ministry, government
owned and operated radio and television stations
and the state railway.
Civil unrest has been spiraling in Iran since
January and has claimed an estimated 1000 lives.
The new government of Prime Minister Jaafar
Sharif-Emami declared martial law in early Sep
tember in Tehran and 10 other cities.
Rhodesia to abolish race laws
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesia's biracial transi
tion government plans to announce the abolition
of all remaining racial segregation laws this week,
published reports said yesterday.
The reports here said Ernest Bulle, black co
minister of justice, made the announcement at a
political rally Saturday.
Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith and the
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, one of the three moder
ate blacks on the ruling executive council, cur
rently are in the United States trying to drum up
support for the transition government.
Black guerrillas say they will accept the plan to
turn Rhodesia over to majority rule after elections
despite their leaders' rejection of the internal set
tlement that has set up a black-shared transition
rule, a black member of the transition government
said yesterday.
This week's announcement is expected to re
move the last vestiges of segregation here: sepa
rate schools, hospitals and residential areas for
whites and blacks.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except for low clouds
and fog nights and mornings. A little cooler today.
Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the mid
60s and 70s. Winds becoming westerly 10 to 20
mph in afternoons.

Fear of self-rule stalls treaty
Jerusalem — The framework for a Mideast peace
worked out at Camp David is running into serious
trouble in the Israeli-occupied territories slated to
become an autonomous Palestinian enclave under
the accords.
The Palestinians do not seem to be interested in
the limited autonomy offered by the agreements,
fearing self-rule with a continued Israeli military
presence will kill hopes for independence.
The accords envision elections by the 1.1 million
Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza for a "self
governing authority" to replace the military gov
ernment.
The vehement rejection by the Arabs has sur
prised many Israelis, who thought the Palestinians
would be happy to see an end to 11 years of Israeli
military government and the establishment of a
local administration.
The problem now seems so acute that Egyptian-
Israeli negotiators, scheduled to meet Thursday in
Washington to begin working on a bilateral peace
treaty, also are likely to focus on the Palestinian
issue, Israeli officials say.
Gov. ends civil unrest in Iran
Tehran, Iran — Security forces broke up anti
government demonstrations in nine Iranian cities
yesterday, a day after a bloody clash between sol
diers and protesters in the Caspian Sea city of
Bobol reportedly left one person dead and many
others injured. Several hundred demonstrators,
chanting anti-government slogans, rampaged
through the city, damaging banks and liquor
stores and setting fire to a theater.
In Tehran, meanwhile, workers at state-run
hospitals joined the long list of public employees
to strike for higher pay.
At least 50 other government agencies or com

panies are on strike, including the Ministry of Cul
ture and Art, the justice Ministry, government
owned and operated radio and television stations
and the state railway.
Civil unrest has been spiraling in Iran since
January and has claimed an estimated 1000 lives.
The new government of Prime Minister Jaafar
Sharif-Emami declared martial law in early Sep
tember in Tehran and 10 other cities.
Rhodesia to abolish race laws
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesia's biracial transi
tion government plans to announce the abolition
of all remaining racial segregation laws this week,
published reports said yesterday.
The reports here said Ernest Bulle, black co
minister of justice, made the announcement at a
political rally Saturday.
Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith and the
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, one of the three moder
ate blacks on the ruling executive council, cur
rently are in the United States trying to drum up
support for the transition government.
Black guerrillas say they will accept the plan to
turn Rhodesia over to majority rule after elections
despite their leaders' rejection of the internal set
tlement that has set up a black-shared transition
rule, a black member of the transition government
said yesterday.
This week's announcement is expected to re
move the last vestiges of segregation here: sepa
rate schools, hospitals and residential areas for
whites and blacks.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except for low clouds
and fog nights and mornings. A little cooler today.
Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the mid
60s and 70s. Winds becoming westerly 10 to 20
mph in afternoons.
Cease-fire holding in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — East Beirut's Christians
emerged cautiously from their basement shelters
for the first time in 10 days yesterday as a Syrian-
Christian cease-fire appeared to be holding, ex
cept for an isolated outbreak of sniper fire.
Beirut police estimated that 1300 Lebanese were
killed and more than 2000 wounded in the 10 days
of fighting. The Syrians have not reported their
casualties.
Political leaders in this half-Moslem, half-
Christian nation were skeptical about the chances
for success of the truce, declared Saturday, unless
the talks between President Elias Sarkis and Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus produce an
overall agreement.
"If we do not reach an agreement here, no one
will," Assad told reporters in Damascus Saturday
night. "We shall continue to try even if it takes us
10 sessions."
The remark was a blow to some Christians who
hope the conflict will be settled not between Sar
kis and Assad in Damascus but by an international
effort.
Liberals promise tax reform
Washington — Liberal tax activists, facing a heavy
schedule of Proposition 13-style initiatives and re
ferenda on Election Day next month, are vowing to
wrestle the tax issue from conservatives.
Their battle cry is a call for "tax justice," essen
tially an increase in corporate tax collections and a
redistribution of the tax burden from lower- and
middle-income families, where property taxes hit
hardest, to wealthier taxpayers.
A weekend tax conference convened by the Na
tional Conference on Alternative State and Local
Public Policies revealed frustration among tax offi
cials faced with across-the-board tax cuts along the
lines of California's Proposition 13.
"Tax cutting is not tax reform," says Byron Dor
gan, the North Dakota tax commissioner. "Tax
limitation has nothing to do with tax justice."
Thus, tax observers are anxiously awaiting the

November votes in at least 10 states where tax
