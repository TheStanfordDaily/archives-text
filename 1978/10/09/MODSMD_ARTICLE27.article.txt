# 2000 enrolled during voter drive

The campus-wide registration
drive conducted from Sept. 25
through today has been very suc
cessful, according to student
coordinators Janet Rappaport and
Eric Miethke.
As of Friday, close to 2000 voters
had been registered for the Nov. 7
general election, said Rappaport.
Since the drive's publicity and re
gistration opportunities were di
rected at students, they consti
tuted the majority of the 2000 re
gistered, she added.
The campaign here is being
conducted by student and local
campaign volunteers working
with a local chapter of Frontlash, a

non-partisan national organiza
tion designed to educate students
and minorities, two "chronically
unrepresented groups," about
campaign issues, according to
Miethke.
Advance work for the drive was
spread through ads, a KZSU an
nouncement, letters to house as
sociates (RAs), posters and the re
gistration and frosh packs. Regist
rations were done on a door-to
door basis and at tables set up at
Maples Pavilion and in White
Plaza.
"We've done everything short
of forcing people to sign registra
tion cards," said Rappaport.
Those who registered at Maples

were very glad to have the non
partisan Frontlash group there,
Miethke said.
Some came to Maples solely for
the purpose of registering to vote,
not to enroll, he added.
Frontlash was funded by the
Council of Presidents, the Vic
Calvo for Assembly campaign, the
Kirsten Olsen for Congress cam
paign and the Arlen Cregorio for
State Senate Committee cam
paign. The Brown campaign do
nated posters in lieu of money,
said Rappaport.
"The whole operation was run
on a shoestring. It cost about
$250," said Miethke.

"That's part of the beauty of the
thing; it took so little to do so
much," he added.
Miethke said he believes stu
dent votes can make a difference
in the upcoming election. He gave
the example of California's last
election, in which 15 of the 43
Congressional Districts reported
margins of victory which were
smaller than the number of col
lege students in the district. He
also said that although students
do not tend to vote as a block,
these results show that a potential
for student political power exists.
Registration will continue today
in White Plaza between 10 a.m.
and 1 p.m.
