# White Plaza rally defends abortion
## 
### CARLA NEASEL 
"Basing the right to choose
abortion on the moral judgment
of a particular religion is a viola
tion of the First Amendment,"
said Betsy Davis at the abortion
and birth control rally held in
White Plaza last Friday at noon.
The hour-long rally was spon
sored by the Stanford Women's
Club.
Davis, along with two other
keynote speakers, addressed the
gathering on the threatened
status of legalized abortion in
America and the legislature which
anti-abortion groups hope will
greatly restrict the availability of
affordable and safe abortions.
Pat Miller, president of a family
planning clinic in Sunnyvale,
spoke briefly on the history of
abortion in America. Miller said
that thanks to a U.S. Supreme
Court decision in 1973 which
legalized abortion nation-wide, a
situation which she termed "dis
criminatory and repressive" was
abolished.
Religious view
John Duryey, a priest who
served as chaplain here from 1961
to 1976, said he feels that religious
factions today tend to repress civil
freedom, and that women "get a
pretty poor deal in western relig
ion."
According to Du ryey, the "Bible
is one of the many expressions of
human wisdom," and we should
respond to moral issues in "the
reality in which we live, not the
reality of past centuries."
Duryey's remarks drew the
loudest and longest applause of
the rally.

Davis, who was the coordinator
for the rally, was skeptical of those
who condemned abortion as an
"out for the irresponsible." Davis
said that by passing "restrictive
legislature on abortion laws,
these people are also limiting the
family planning centers, the
places where people can go to
gain responsibility."
Legislation
All the speakers agreed legisla
tion affecting abortion almost al
ways reflects on family planning
projects. Many of the bills which
are now being considered by
Congress restrict or eliminate
federal funds for those groups
which sanction abortion, regard
less of whether or not the group
practices it.
The Health Services Appropria
tions Bill, better known as Title X,
is the primary source for most of
the dollars which family planning
programs receive, said Miller. The
proposed amendments to this bill
would severely cripple most of
these organizations because of
the supportive policy of these
groups concerning abortion, she
added.
Each of the speakers urged
everyone in the crowd to support
abortion rights for all by writing a
letter to a representative and by
signing the petition which the
raily organizers circulated.
The rally was attended by about
a hundred passers-by, joggers
and cyclists, many of whom were
drawn in by the enthusiastic pre
rally message of Richard Olivas,
an opponent of "pre-natal mur
der" on the grounds that "an
aborted baby is a murdered one."

His remarks, substantiated by
numerous biblical quotations,
were not appreciated by the
crowd, and his emphatic cry that
"What we need is nof birth
control, but self-control" was
greeted with laughter, sarcasm
and only a smattering of applause.
Olivas was out-shouted, how
ever, when a young woman went
to the microphone and led the as
sembled in a chant of "Not the
church, not the state; women
must decide their fate." The into
nation continued until the first
speaker was introduced by Davis.

who condemned abortion as an
"out for the irresponsible." Davis
said that by passing "restrictive
legislature on abortion laws,
these people are also limiting the
family planning centers, the
places where people can go to
gain responsibility."
Legislation
All the speakers agreed legisla
tion affecting abortion almost al
ways reflects on family planning
projects. Many of the bills which
are now being considered by
Congress restrict or eliminate
federal funds for those groups
which sanction abortion, regard
less of whether or not the group
practices it.
The Health Services Appropria
tions Bill, better known as Title X,
is the primary source for most of
the dollars which family planning
programs receive, said Miller. The
proposed amendments to this bill
would severely cripple most of
these organizations because of
the supportive policy of these
groups concerning abortion, she
added.
Each of the speakers urged
everyone in the crowd to support
abortion rights for all by writing a
letter to a representative and by
signing the petition which the
raily organizers circulated.
The rally was attended by about
a hundred passers-by, joggers
and cyclists, many of whom were
drawn in by the enthusiastic pre
rally message of Richard Olivas,
an opponent of "pre-natal mur
der" on the grounds that "an
aborted baby is a murdered one."

His remarks, substantiated by
numerous biblical quotations,
were not appreciated by the
crowd, and his emphatic cry that
"What we need is nof birth
control, but self-control" was
greeted with laughter, sarcasm
and only a smattering of applause.
Olivas was out-shouted, how
ever, when a young woman went
to the microphone and led the as
sembled in a chant of "Not the
church, not the state; women
must decide their fate." The into
nation continued until the first
speaker was introduced by Davis.

"Basing the right to choose
abortion on the moral judgment
of a particular religion is a viola
tion of the First Amendment,"
said Betsy Davis at the abortion
and birth control rally held in
White Plaza last Friday at noon.
The hour-long rally was spon
sored by the Stanford Women's
Club.
Davis, along with two other
keynote speakers, addressed the
gathering on the threatened
status of legalized abortion in
America and the legislature which
anti-abortion groups hope will
greatly restrict the availability of
affordable and safe abortions.
Pat Miller, president of a family
planning clinic in Sunnyvale,
spoke briefly on the history of
abortion in America. Miller said
that thanks to a U.S. Supreme
Court decision in 1973 which
legalized abortion nation-wide, a
situation which she termed "dis
criminatory and repressive" was
abolished.
Religious view
John Duryey, a priest who
served as chaplain here from 1961
to 1976, said he feels that religious
factions today tend to repress civil
freedom, and that women "get a
pretty poor deal in western relig
ion."
According to Du ryey, the "Bible
is one of the many expressions of
human wisdom," and we should
respond to moral issues in "the
reality in which we live, not the
reality of past centuries."
Duryey's remarks drew the
loudest and longest applause of
the rally.

Davis, who was the coordinator
for the rally, was skeptical of those
who condemned abortion as an
"out for the irresponsible." Davis
said that by passing "restrictive
legislature on abortion laws,
these people are also limiting the
family planning centers, the
places where people can go to
