# Card's long faces follow UCLA's last minute field goal
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Los Angeles — Only one
thing was longer than the faces
in the Stanford locker room at
the Coliseum Saturday night. It
was the 38-yard field goal by
UCLA's Peter Boermeester
with 27 seconds left which gave
UCLA a dramatic 27-26 victory.
For a change, smog was not
accountable for the watery
eyes after the Los Angeles con
test. The Stanford locker room
was quieter than the reading
room at the local library. No
one pounded lockers. No one
spoke above a whisper. Even
the showers were quiet.
"This is the hardest loss I've
ever been through,'' Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said in a subdued voice.
"I didn't think of losing,"
wide receiver Ken Margerum
said. "It never crossed my
mind. I still can't believe it."
UCLA embarrassed Stanford
with a blitzing defense in the
first half and the Cards were
fortunate to trail only 14-7 at
halftime.
The Cards made some criti
cal adjustments in the locker
room and grabbed the lead on
three occasions in the second
half, the last time on a 30-yard
field goal by sophomore Ken

Naber with only 3:36 remain
ing in the final period.
A jacked-up Stanford de
fense had not allowed a sus
tained drive in the second half,
UCLA getting its points on a
93-yard Theotis Brown kickoff
return and a 35-yard Boermees
ter field goal.
Kept ajive by a 15-yard
scramble by quarterback Kick
Bashore, the Bruins got a big
break on a questionable
face-masking call against
Robby Chapman which gave
the Bruins the ball at the 25.
Three plays netted the
Bruins five yards. Boermeester
came on the field with 30 sec
onds left and the pompon
waving Bruin fans in hysteria.
The left-footed sidewinder
plugged the uprights. Stanford
got the ball back with 27 sec
onds on the clock. But when
Steve Dils threw a pass to Bruin
linebacker Glenn Windom,
Stanford partisans could only
think of all the ifs which might
have preserved a Stanford vic
tory.
If Stanford could have ad
justed to the blitz before half
time.
If Naber had not missed the
extra point in the third quarter.

Gordy Banks (45) futile attempt to block Peter Boermeester's game
winning field goal with 27 seconds remaining in Stanford's 27-26 loss to
UCLA leaves the Cards 0-1 in the Pac-10 and 3-2 overall.
If Brown and Boermeester
had stayed home. If ... .
"You can't fault anybody in
particular," Ceresino said.
"We play as a team, win as a
team and lose as a team. No
one unit lost this game."
UCLA took the opening kic
koff and drove into Stanford
territory before stalling at the
32. Card linebacker Terry Re
nnaker blocked a Boermeester
field goal attempt and Rick
Parker scooped it up on the 24
and returned it to midfield.
Stanford moved to the UCLA
20 in three plays and then tried
a double-reverse flea flicker
which the Cards showed first in
the Sun Bowl. Like the one in El
Paso, this one fell incomplete.
On third-and-10 from the 20,
Nelson took a pitch around
right end for 11 yards. Two
gives to fullback Phil Francis
moved the ball to the 3. Then
Dils bootlegged right and
launched himself from the 3,
hitting the orange foam goal
line marker and crossing the
plane of the end zone for six
points.
Injuries and the Bruin de
fense stymied the Stanford of
fense the rest of the half. On
Stanford's second possession,
Nelson was dinged and Walsh
said the concussion prevented
the fleet sophomore from re
membering his plays for a
quarter. In the middle of the
second quarter fullback Phil
Francis injured his wrist. The
extent of his injury will not be
known until today.

But what confounded Stan
ford's offense the most was the
heavy, continual UCLA blitz.
"They blitzed the shit out of
us," Dils said. Pouring through
the Stanford line like the Fifth
Army liberating Italy, the
Bruins held Stanford to 122
yards in the first half.
The UCLA offense, on the
other hand, capitalized on
poor Stanford punting and a
Nelson fumble to spring
halfback james Owens for two
TDs. Owens had 92 of his 102
yards during the first half.
At halftime, the Cards ad
justed to handle the blitz.
"I swear to God," Dils said,
"Walsh is a genius. We went in
at halftime and he almost com
pletely junked our game plan."
To cope with the blitz, Stan
ford employed either a
double-tight-end set or a wide
receiver in tight to help with
the blocking. With a rede
signed attack, the Cards began
to pick apart the UCLA de
fense.
Six plays into the half, Dils
threw a quick slant to Andre
Tyler at the UCLA 44. Bruin
strong safety Michael Molina
went for the ball, missed it,
then turned around to see
Tyler racing uncontested to the
end zone with a 55-yard TD.
Midway through the long
third quarter — one Margerum
said "must have lasted eight
hours" — Stanford took over at
the UCLA 38 on a well-timed
interception by linebacker
Steve Budinger. Dils fired a
pass to Margerum who carried

the ball along the left sideline
to the 18. A personal foul
against the Bruins gav<> Stan
ford first-and-1 on the 9.
Nelson picked up three and
Stanford had first-and-goal
from the six. Delay penalties
on consecutive plays moved
the ball back to the 16. Dils,
with a voice already strained,
could not call his audibles over
the thunderous UCLA rooting
section. He said after the game
that he should have asked an
official to quiet the crowd.
A pass interference call at the
7 gave the Cards their third first
down inside the 10. They
picked up only three yards on
three plays, however, and had
to settle for a 21-yard Naber
field goal, taking the lead
17-14. The lead was short-lived.
Brown took the ensuing kic
koff, started up the middle,
then slanted right and dashed
untouched into the end zone.
The Cards, who outgained
the Bruins 224 yards to 16 in the
third quarter, stormed back
late in the period. Starting on
their own 42, the Cards drove
58 yards in three plays with a
13-yard pass from Dils to
Margerum, a 33-yard run
around left end by Nelson and
a perfect 12-yard toss from Dils
to Banks putting Stanford back
on top. Naber, however, mis
sed the PAT — a costly boot for
Stanford.
As it had throughout the
game, field position worked
against the Cards. A 37-yard
Brad Fox punt from the Stan
ford 3 gave the Bruins the ball

at the Card 40. A 16-yard pass
from Bashore to Tim
Wrightman set up a 35-yard
field goal midway through the
quarter.
Three passes from Dils to
Margerum and a personal foul
against the Bruins keyed the
next Stanford drive before the
Cards stalled with fourth-and-1
at the 13. Naber pierced the
uprights with 3:36 remaining.
Then for the first time in the
half, the Bruins put on some
sort of a sustained drive, mov
ing from their own 26 to the
Stanford 20 before calling on
Boermeester to close the lid.
Stanford set up 80 yards from
the UCLA goal line with 27 sec
onds left. But Dils' pass to
Windom extinguished any flic

kering Stanford hopes.
Dils finished the game with
21 completions on 35 throws
for 262 yards, throwing for two
touchdowns and running for
another.
Nelson gained 84 yards on 13
carries while Margerum led
Stanford's receiving corps with
six catches for 79 yards.
"Stanford is a much better
football team than some
people thought," UCLA coach
Terry Donahue said, "and I'm
extremely gratified with our
win."
But no kind of statistic and
no kind of compliment was
going to lift faces in the Stan
ford locker room. It was a long,
quiet flight back to San Fran
cisco.

Nelson was dinged and Walsh
said the concussion prevented
the fleet sophomore from re
membering his plays for a
quarter. In the middle of the
second quarter fullback Phil
Francis injured his wrist. The
extent of his injury will not be
known until today.

But what confounded Stan
ford's offense the most was the
heavy, continual UCLA blitz.
"They blitzed the shit out of
us," Dils said. Pouring through
the Stanford line like the Fifth
Army liberating Italy, the
Bruins held Stanford to 122
yards in the first half.
The UCLA offense, on the
other hand, capitalized on
poor Stanford punting and a
Nelson fumble to spring
halfback james Owens for two
TDs. Owens had 92 of his 102
yards during the first half.
At halftime, the Cards ad
justed to handle the blitz.
"I swear to God," Dils said,
"Walsh is a genius. We went in
at halftime and he almost com
pletely junked our game plan."
To cope with the blitz, Stan
ford employed either a
double-tight-end set or a wide
receiver in tight to help with
the blocking. With a rede
signed attack, the Cards began
to pick apart the UCLA de
fense.
Six plays into the half, Dils
threw a quick slant to Andre
Tyler at the UCLA 44. Bruin
strong safety Michael Molina
went for the ball, missed it,
then turned around to see
Tyler racing uncontested to the
end zone with a 55-yard TD.
Midway through the long
third quarter — one Margerum
said "must have lasted eight
hours" — Stanford took over at
the UCLA 38 on a well-timed
interception by linebacker
Steve Budinger. Dils fired a
pass to Margerum who carried

the ball along the left sideline
to the 18. A personal foul
against the Bruins gav<> Stan
ford first-and-1 on the 9.
Nelson picked up three and
Stanford had first-and-goal
from the six. Delay penalties
on consecutive plays moved
the ball back to the 16. Dils,
with a voice already strained,
could not call his audibles over
the thunderous UCLA rooting
section. He said after the game
that he should have asked an
official to quiet the crowd.
A pass interference call at the
7 gave the Cards their third first
down inside the 10. They
picked up only three yards on
three plays, however, and had
to settle for a 21-yard Naber
field goal, taking the lead
17-14. The lead was short-lived.
Brown took the ensuing kic
koff, started up the middle,
then slanted right and dashed
untouched into the end zone.
The Cards, who outgained
the Bruins 224 yards to 16 in the
third quarter, stormed back
late in the period. Starting on
their own 42, the Cards drove
58 yards in three plays with a
13-yard pass from Dils to
Margerum, a 33-yard run
around left end by Nelson and
a perfect 12-yard toss from Dils
to Banks putting Stanford back
on top. Naber, however, mis
sed the PAT — a costly boot for
Stanford.
As it had throughout the
game, field position worked
against the Cards. A 37-yard
Brad Fox punt from the Stan
ford 3 gave the Bruins the ball

at the Card 40. A 16-yard pass
from Bashore to Tim
Wrightman set up a 35-yard
field goal midway through the
quarter.
Three passes from Dils to
Margerum and a personal foul
against the Bruins keyed the
next Stanford drive before the
Cards stalled with fourth-and-1
at the 13. Naber pierced the
uprights with 3:36 remaining.
Then for the first time in the
half, the Bruins put on some
sort of a sustained drive, mov
ing from their own 26 to the
Stanford 20 before calling on
Boermeester to close the lid.
Stanford set up 80 yards from
the UCLA goal line with 27 sec
onds left. But Dils' pass to
Windom extinguished any flic

kering Stanford hopes.
Dils finished the game with
21 completions on 35 throws
for 262 yards, throwing for two
touchdowns and running for
another.
Nelson gained 84 yards on 13
carries while Margerum led
Stanford's receiving corps with
six catches for 79 yards.
"Stanford is a much better
football team than some
people thought," UCLA coach
Terry Donahue said, "and I'm
extremely gratified with our
win."
But no kind of statistic and
no kind of compliment was
going to lift faces in the Stan
ford locker room. It was a long,
quiet flight back to San Fran
cisco.

Los Angeles — Only one
thing was longer than the faces
in the Stanford locker room at
the Coliseum Saturday night. It
was the 38-yard field goal by
UCLA's Peter Boermeester
with 27 seconds left which gave
UCLA a dramatic 27-26 victory.
For a change, smog was not
accountable for the watery
eyes after the Los Angeles con
test. The Stanford locker room
was quieter than the reading
room at the local library. No
one pounded lockers. No one
spoke above a whisper. Even
the showers were quiet.
"This is the hardest loss I've
ever been through,'' Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said in a subdued voice.
"I didn't think of losing,"
wide receiver Ken Margerum
said. "It never crossed my
mind. I still can't believe it."
UCLA embarrassed Stanford
with a blitzing defense in the
first half and the Cards were
fortunate to trail only 14-7 at
halftime.
The Cards made some criti
cal adjustments in the locker
room and grabbed the lead on
three occasions in the second
half, the last time on a 30-yard
field goal by sophomore Ken

Naber with only 3:36 remain
ing in the final period.
A jacked-up Stanford de
fense had not allowed a sus
tained drive in the second half,
UCLA getting its points on a
93-yard Theotis Brown kickoff
return and a 35-yard Boermees
ter field goal.
Kept ajive by a 15-yard
scramble by quarterback Kick
Bashore, the Bruins got a big
break on a questionable
face-masking call against
Robby Chapman which gave
the Bruins the ball at the 25.
Three plays netted the
Bruins five yards. Boermeester
came on the field with 30 sec
onds left and the pompon
waving Bruin fans in hysteria.
The left-footed sidewinder
plugged the uprights. Stanford
got the ball back with 27 sec
onds on the clock. But when
Steve Dils threw a pass to Bruin
linebacker Glenn Windom,
Stanford partisans could only
think of all the ifs which might
have preserved a Stanford vic
tory.
If Stanford could have ad
justed to the blitz before half
time.
If Naber had not missed the
extra point in the third quarter.

If Brown and Boermeester
had stayed home. If ... .
"You can't fault anybody in
particular," Ceresino said.
"We play as a team, win as a
team and lose as a team. No
one unit lost this game."
UCLA took the opening kic
koff and drove into Stanford
territory before stalling at the
32. Card linebacker Terry Re
nnaker blocked a Boermeester
field goal attempt and Rick
Parker scooped it up on the 24
and returned it to midfield.
Stanford moved to the UCLA
20 in three plays and then tried
a double-reverse flea flicker
which the Cards showed first in
the Sun Bowl. Like the one in El
Paso, this one fell incomplete.
On third-and-10 from the 20,
Nelson took a pitch around
right end for 11 yards. Two
gives to fullback Phil Francis
moved the ball to the 3. Then
Dils bootlegged right and
launched himself from the 3,
hitting the orange foam goal
line marker and crossing the
plane of the end zone for six
points.
Injuries and the Bruin de
fense stymied the Stanford of
fense the rest of the half. On
Stanford's second possession,
Nelson was dinged and Walsh
said the concussion prevented

Boermeester to close the lid.
Stanford set up 80 yards from
the UCLA goal line with 27 sec

Windom extinguished any flic

Dils finished the game with
21 completions on 35 throws
for 262 yards, throwing for two
touchdowns and running for

Nelson gained 84 yards on 13
carries while Margerum led
Stanford's receiving corps with
six catches for 79 yards.
"Stanford is a much better
football team than some
people thought," UCLA coach
Terry Donahue said, "and I'm
extremely gratified with our
win."
But no kind of statistic and
no kind of compliment was
going to lift faces in the Stan
ford locker room. It was a long,
quiet flight back to San Fran
cisco.

Los Angeles — Only one
thing was longer than the faces
in the Stanford locker room at
the Coliseum Saturday night. It
was the 38-yard field goal by
UCLA's Peter Boermeester
with 27 seconds left which gave
UCLA a dramatic 27-26 victory.
For a change, smog was not
accountable for the watery
eyes after the Los Angeles con
test. The Stanford locker room
was quieter than the reading
room at the local library. No
one pounded lockers. No one
spoke above a whisper. Even
the showers were quiet.
"This is the hardest loss I've
ever been through,'' Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said in a subdued voice.
"I didn't think of losing,"
wide receiver Ken Margerum
said. "It never crossed my
mind. I still can't believe it."
UCLA embarrassed Stanford
with a blitzing defense in the
first half and the Cards were
fortunate to trail only 14-7 at
halftime.
The Cards made some criti
cal adjustments in the locker
room and grabbed the lead on
three occasions in the second
half, the last time on a 30-yard
field goal by sophomore Ken

Naber with only 3:36 remain
ing in the final period.
A jacked-up Stanford de
fense had not allowed a sus
tained drive in the second half,
UCLA getting its points on a
93-yard Theotis Brown kickoff
return and a 35-yard Boermees
ter field goal.
Kept ajive by a 15-yard
scramble by quarterback Kick
Bashore, the Bruins got a big
break on a questionable
face-masking call against
Robby Chapman which gave
the Bruins the ball at the 25.
Three plays netted the
Bruins five yards. Boermeester
came on the field with 30 sec
onds left and the pompon
waving Bruin fans in hysteria.
The left-footed sidewinder
plugged the uprights. Stanford
got the ball back with 27 sec
onds on the clock. But when
Steve Dils threw a pass to Bruin
linebacker Glenn Windom,
Stanford partisans could only
think of all the ifs which might
have preserved a Stanford vic
tory.
If Stanford could have ad
justed to the blitz before half
time.
If Naber had not missed the
extra point in the third quarter.

Gordy Banks (45) futile attempt to block Peter Boermeester's game
winning field goal with 27 seconds remaining in Stanford's 27-26 loss to
UCLA leaves the Cards 0-1 in the Pac-10 and 3-2 overall.
If Brown and Boermeester
had stayed home. If ... .
"You can't fault anybody in
particular," Ceresino said.
"We play as a team, win as a
team and lose as a team. No
one unit lost this game."
UCLA took the opening kic
koff and drove into Stanford
territory before stalling at the
32. Card linebacker Terry Re
nnaker blocked a Boermeester
field goal attempt and Rick
Parker scooped it up on the 24
and returned it to midfield.
Stanford moved to the UCLA
20 in three plays and then tried
a double-reverse flea flicker
which the Cards showed first in
the Sun Bowl. Like the one in El
Paso, this one fell incomplete.
On third-and-10 from the 20,
Nelson took a pitch around
right end for 11 yards. Two
gives to fullback Phil Francis
moved the ball to the 3. Then
Dils bootlegged right and
launched himself from the 3,
hitting the orange foam goal
line marker and crossing the
plane of the end zone for six
points.
Injuries and the Bruin de
fense stymied the Stanford of
fense the rest of the half. On
Stanford's second possession,
Nelson was dinged and Walsh
said the concussion prevented
the fleet sophomore from re
membering his plays for a
quarter. In the middle of the
second quarter fullback Phil
Francis injured his wrist. The
extent of his injury will not be
known until today.

But what confounded Stan
ford's offense the most was the
heavy, continual UCLA blitz.
"They blitzed the shit out of
us," Dils said. Pouring through
the Stanford line like the Fifth
Army liberating Italy, the
Bruins held Stanford to 122
yards in the first half.
The UCLA offense, on the
other hand, capitalized on
poor Stanford punting and a
Nelson fumble to spring
halfback james Owens for two
TDs. Owens had 92 of his 102
yards during the first half.
At halftime, the Cards ad
justed to handle the blitz.
"I swear to God," Dils said,
"Walsh is a genius. We went in
at halftime and he almost com
pletely junked our game plan."
To cope with the blitz, Stan
ford employed either a
double-tight-end set or a wide
receiver in tight to help with
the blocking. With a rede
signed attack, the Cards began
to pick apart the UCLA de
fense.
Six plays into the half, Dils
threw a quick slant to Andre
Tyler at the UCLA 44. Bruin
strong safety Michael Molina
went for the ball, missed it,
then turned around to see
Tyler racing uncontested to the
end zone with a 55-yard TD.
Midway through the long
third quarter — one Margerum
said "must have lasted eight
hours" — Stanford took over at
the UCLA 38 on a well-timed
interception by linebacker
Steve Budinger. Dils fired a
pass to Margerum who carried

the ball along the left sideline
to the 18. A personal foul
against the Bruins gav<> Stan
ford first-and-1 on the 9.
Nelson picked up three and
Stanford had first-and-goal
from the six. Delay penalties
on consecutive plays moved
the ball back to the 16. Dils,
with a voice already strained,
could not call his audibles over
the thunderous UCLA rooting
section. He said after the game
that he should have asked an
official to quiet the crowd.
A pass interference call at the
7 gave the Cards their third first
down inside the 10. They
picked up only three yards on
three plays, however, and had
to settle for a 21-yard Naber
field goal, taking the lead
17-14. The lead was short-lived.
Brown took the ensuing kic
koff, started up the middle,
then slanted right and dashed
untouched into the end zone.
The Cards, who outgained
the Bruins 224 yards to 16 in the
third quarter, stormed back
late in the period. Starting on
their own 42, the Cards drove
58 yards in three plays with a
13-yard pass from Dils to
Margerum, a 33-yard run
around left end by Nelson and
a perfect 12-yard toss from Dils
to Banks putting Stanford back
on top. Naber, however, mis
sed the PAT — a costly boot for
Stanford.
As it had throughout the
game, field position worked
against the Cards. A 37-yard
Brad Fox punt from the Stan
ford 3 gave the Bruins the ball

at the Card 40. A 16-yard pass
from Bashore to Tim
Wrightman set up a 35-yard
field goal midway through the
quarter.
Three passes from Dils to
Margerum and a personal foul
against the Bruins keyed the
next Stanford drive before the
Cards stalled with fourth-and-1
at the 13. Naber pierced the
uprights with 3:36 remaining.
Then for the first time in the
half, the Bruins put on some
sort of a sustained drive, mov
ing from their own 26 to the
Stanford 20 before calling on
Boermeester to close the lid.
Stanford set up 80 yards from

winning field goal with 27 seconds remaining in Stanford's 27-26 loss to
UCLA leaves the Cards 0-1 in the Pac-10 and 3-2 overall.
If Brown and Boermeester
had stayed home. If ... .
"You can't fault anybody in
particular," Ceresino said.
"We play as a team, win as a
team and lose as a team. No
one unit lost this game."
UCLA took the opening kic
koff and drove into Stanford
territory before stalling at the
32. Card linebacker Terry Re
nnaker blocked a Boermeester
field goal attempt and Rick
Parker scooped it up on the 24
and returned it to midfield.
Stanford moved to the UCLA
20 in three plays and then tried
a double-reverse flea flicker
which the Cards showed first in
the Sun Bowl. Like the one in El
Paso, this one fell incomplete.
On third-and-10 from the 20,
Nelson took a pitch around
right end for 11 yards. Two
gives to fullback Phil Francis
moved the ball to the 3. Then
Dils bootlegged right and
launched himself from the 3,
hitting the orange foam goal
line marker and crossing the
plane of the end zone for six
points.
Injuries and the Bruin de
fense stymied the Stanford of
fense the rest of the half. On
Stanford's second possession,
Nelson was dinged and Walsh
said the concussion prevented
the fleet sophomore from re
membering his plays for a
quarter. In the middle of the
second quarter fullback Phil
Francis injured his wrist. The
extent of his injury will not be
known until today.

But what confounded Stan
ford's offense the most was the
heavy, continual UCLA blitz.
"They blitzed the shit out of
us," Dils said. Pouring through
the Stanford line like the Fifth
Army liberating Italy, the
Bruins held Stanford to 122
yards in the first half.
The UCLA offense, on the
other hand, capitalized on
poor Stanford punting and a
Nelson fumble to spring
halfback james Owens for two
TDs. Owens had 92 of his 102
yards during the first half.
At halftime, the Cards ad
justed to handle the blitz.
"I swear to God," Dils said,
"Walsh is a genius. We went in
at halftime and he almost com
pletely junked our game plan."
To cope with the blitz, Stan
ford employed either a
double-tight-end set or a wide
receiver in tight to help with
the blocking. With a rede
signed attack, the Cards began
to pick apart the UCLA de
fense.
Six plays into the half, Dils
threw a quick slant to Andre
Tyler at the UCLA 44. Bruin
strong safety Michael Molina
went for the ball, missed it,
then turned around to see
Tyler racing uncontested to the
end zone with a 55-yard TD.
Midway through the long
third quarter — one Margerum
said "must have lasted eight
hours" — Stanford took over at
the UCLA 38 on a well-timed
interception by linebacker
Steve Budinger. Dils fired a
pass to Margerum who carried

the ball along the left sideline
to the 18. A personal foul
against the Bruins gav<> Stan
ford first-and-1 on the 9.
Nelson picked up three and
Stanford had first-and-goal
from the six. Delay penalties
on consecutive plays moved
the ball back to the 16. Dils,
with a voice already strained,
could not call his audibles over
the thunderous UCLA rooting
section. He said after the game
that he should have asked an
official to quiet the crowd.
A pass interference call at the
7 gave the Cards their third first
down inside the 10. They
picked up only three yards on
three plays, however, and had
to settle for a 21-yard Naber
field goal, taking the lead
17-14. The lead was short-lived.
Brown took the ensuing kic
koff, started up the middle,
then slanted right and dashed
untouched into the end zone.
The Cards, who outgained
the Bruins 224 yards to 16 in the
third quarter, stormed back
late in the period. Starting on
their own 42, the Cards drove
58 yards in three plays with a
13-yard pass from Dils to
Margerum, a 33-yard run
around left end by Nelson and
a perfect 12-yard toss from Dils
to Banks putting Stanford back
on top. Naber, however, mis
sed the PAT — a costly boot for
Stanford.
As it had throughout the
game, field position worked
against the Cards. A 37-yard
Brad Fox punt from the Stan
ford 3 gave the Bruins the ball

at the Card 40. A 16-yard pass
from Bashore to Tim
Wrightman set up a 35-yard
field goal midway through the
quarter.
Three passes from Dils to
Margerum and a personal foul
against the Bruins keyed the
next Stanford drive before the
Cards stalled with fourth-and-1
at the 13. Naber pierced the
uprights with 3:36 remaining.
Then for the first time in the
half, the Bruins put on some
sort of a sustained drive, mov
ing from their own 26 to the
Stanford 20 before calling on
Boermeester to close the lid.
Stanford set up 80 yards from
the UCLA goal line with 27 sec
onds left. But Dils' pass to
Windom extinguished any flic

kering Stanford hopes.
Dils finished the game with
21 completions on 35 throws
for 262 yards, throwing for two
touchdowns and running for
another.
Nelson gained 84 yards on 13
carries while Margerum led
Stanford's receiving corps with
six catches for 79 yards.
"Stanford is a much better
football team than some
people thought," UCLA coach
Terry Donahue said, "and I'm
extremely gratified with our
win."
But no kind of statistic and
no kind of compliment was
going to lift faces in the Stan
ford locker room. It was a long,
quiet flight back to San Fran
cisco.

Los Angeles — Only one
thing was longer than the faces
in the Stanford locker room at
the Coliseum Saturday night. It
was the 38-yard field goal by
UCLA's Peter Boermeester
with 27 seconds left which gave
UCLA a dramatic 27-26 victory.
For a change, smog was not
accountable for the watery
eyes after the Los Angeles con
test. The Stanford locker room
was quieter than the reading
room at the local library. No
one pounded lockers. No one
spoke above a whisper. Even
the showers were quiet.
"This is the hardest loss I've
ever been through,'' Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said in a subdued voice.
"I didn't think of losing,"
wide receiver Ken Margerum
said. "It never crossed my
mind. I still can't believe it."
UCLA embarrassed Stanford
with a blitzing defense in the
first half and the Cards were
fortunate to trail only 14-7 at
halftime.
The Cards made some criti
cal adjustments in the locker
room and grabbed the lead on
three occasions in the second
half, the last time on a 30-yard
field goal by sophomore Ken

Naber with only 3:36 remain
ing in the final period.
A jacked-up Stanford de
fense had not allowed a sus
tained drive in the second half,
UCLA getting its points on a
93-yard Theotis Brown kickoff
return and a 35-yard Boermees
ter field goal.
Kept ajive by a 15-yard
scramble by quarterback Kick
Bashore, the Bruins got a big
break on a questionable
face-masking call against
Robby Chapman which gave
the Bruins the ball at the 25.
Three plays netted the
Bruins five yards. Boermeester
came on the field with 30 sec
onds left and the pompon
waving Bruin fans in hysteria.
The left-footed sidewinder
plugged the uprights. Stanford
got the ball back with 27 sec
onds on the clock. But when
Steve Dils threw a pass to Bruin
linebacker Glenn Windom,
Stanford partisans could only
think of all the ifs which might
have preserved a Stanford vic
tory.
If Stanford could have ad
justed to the blitz before half
time.
If Naber had not missed the
extra point in the third quarter.
