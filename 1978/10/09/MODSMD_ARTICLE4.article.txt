# Card's long faces follow UCLA's last minute field goal
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Los Angeles — Only one
thing was longer than the faces
in the Stanford locker room at
the Coliseum Saturday night. It
was the 38-yard field goal by
UCLA's Peter Boermeester
with 27 seconds left which gave
UCLA a dramatic 27-26 victory.
For a change, smog was not
accountable for the watery
eyes after the Los Angeles con
test. The Stanford locker room
was quieter than the reading
room at the local library. No
one pounded lockers. No one
spoke above a whisper. Even
the showers were quiet.
"This is the hardest loss I've
ever been through,'' Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said in a subdued voice.
"I didn't think of losing,"
wide receiver Ken Margerum
said. "It never crossed my
mind. I still can't believe it."
UCLA embarrassed Stanford
with a blitzing defense in the
first half and the Cards were
fortunate to trail only 14-7 at
halftime.
The Cards made some criti
cal adjustments in the locker
room and grabbed the lead on
three occasions in the second
half, the last time on a 30-yard
field goal by sophomore Ken

Naber with only 3:36 remain
ing in the final period.
A jacked-up Stanford de
fense had not allowed a sus
tained drive in the second half,
UCLA getting its points on a
93-yard Theotis Brown kickoff
return and a 35-yard Boermees
ter field goal.
Kept ajive by a 15-yard
scramble by quarterback Kick
Bashore, the Bruins got a big
break on a questionable
face-masking call against
Robby Chapman which gave
the Bruins the ball at the 25.
Three plays netted the
Bruins five yards. Boermeester
came on the field with 30 sec
onds left and the pompon
waving Bruin fans in hysteria.
The left-footed sidewinder
plugged the uprights. Stanford
got the ball back with 27 sec
onds on the clock. But when
Steve Dils threw a pass to Bruin
linebacker Glenn Windom,
Stanford partisans could only
think of all the ifs which might
have preserved a Stanford vic
tory.
If Stanford could have ad
justed to the blitz before half
time.
If Naber had not missed the
extra point in the third quarter.
