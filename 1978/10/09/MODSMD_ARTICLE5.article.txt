# Wife denied tenure here
## Well-liked Bems leave campus 
### ADRIAN TAMIMI 
Returning students flipping
through the autumn quarter time
schedule may have noticed that two
of the best known professors in the
Psychology Department, Daryl and
Sandra Bern, are no longer teaching
courses here.
According to psychology adminis
trator Maxine Aiken, "the Bems have
left Stanford and are now working at
Cornell University." The Bems were
faculty members here for seven
years.
Daryl Bern is now a full professor in
psychology at Cornell University.
Sandra Bern is director of women's
studies and an associate professor in
psychology. Both now have tenure.
At the beginning of the last
academic year, Sandra was denied
tenure here. Although the psychol
ogy department had voted unanim
ously to give Sandra tenure, the Ap
pointment and Promotions Commit
tee overturned the decision. The
chairman of the Appointment and
Promotions Committee, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden, refused to comment on why
the original decision was over
turned.
Zimbardo comments
Philip Zimbardo, a well-known
psychology professor here, said
Sandra had appealed the decision all
year; however, by spring quarter, all
her options had been exhausted.
Sandra was an assistant professor.
According to Zimbardo, if an assis
tant professor is denied tenure, he or
she is "effectively fired." The Uni
versity, however, does give the assis
tant professors a grace period of a
year or so before they must leave.
Zimbardo said the Bems were very
happy here, had many friends and
enjoyed doing research.

The Bems came to the University in
1971 as visiting professors. The
psychology department was impre
ssed with their work and asked them
to stay on as full-time faculty, said
Zimbardo.
Daryl is one of the leading social
psychologists in the country, accord
ing to Zimbardo. Part of his impor
tance has been in his attempt to in
tegrate social psychology and per
sonality theory. He liked to teach
Jarge lectures and was well-liked by
students, Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo said Sandra has been
very important in making people
aware of androgyny and giving it
psychological significance through

her writing and research. She is also
considered one of the leading scho
lars in her field and has always
worked to encourage a healthier
perspective on masculinity and fe
minity, Zimbardo said.
'Up or out'
Sandra had been an assistant pro
fessor here for six years. According
to Zimbardo, after six years as an as
sistant professor, it is either "up or
out."
According to Zimbardo, the Bems
did not want to leave. If Sandra had
received tenure "they probably
would have spent the rest of their
professional lives at Stanford," he
said.

tant professors a grace period of a
year or so before they must leave.
Zimbardo said the Bems were very
happy here, had many friends and
enjoyed doing research.

The Bems came to the University in
1971 as visiting professors. The
psychology department was impre
ssed with their work and asked them
to stay on as full-time faculty, said
Zimbardo.
Daryl is one of the leading social
psychologists in the country, accord
ing to Zimbardo. Part of his impor
tance has been in his attempt to in
tegrate social psychology and per
sonality theory. He liked to teach
Jarge lectures and was well-liked by
students, Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo said Sandra has been
very important in making people
aware of androgyny and giving it
psychological significance through

her writing and research. She is also
considered one of the leading scho
lars in her field and has always
worked to encourage a healthier
perspective on masculinity and fe
minity, Zimbardo said.
'Up or out'
Sandra had been an assistant pro
fessor here for six years. According
to Zimbardo, after six years as an as
sistant professor, it is either "up or
out."
According to Zimbardo, the Bems
did not want to leave. If Sandra had
received tenure "they probably
would have spent the rest of their
professional lives at Stanford," he
said.
Returning students flipping
through the autumn quarter time
schedule may have noticed that two
of the best known professors in the
Psychology Department, Daryl and
Sandra Bern, are no longer teaching
courses here.
According to psychology adminis
trator Maxine Aiken, "the Bems have
left Stanford and are now working at
Cornell University." The Bems were
faculty members here for seven
years.
Daryl Bern is now a full professor in
psychology at Cornell University.
Sandra Bern is director of women's
studies and an associate professor in
psychology. Both now have tenure.
At the beginning of the last
academic year, Sandra was denied
tenure here. Although the psychol
ogy department had voted unanim
ously to give Sandra tenure, the Ap
pointment and Promotions Commit
tee overturned the decision. The
chairman of the Appointment and
Promotions Committee, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden, refused to comment on why
the original decision was over
turned.
Zimbardo comments
Philip Zimbardo, a well-known
psychology professor here, said
Sandra had appealed the decision all
year; however, by spring quarter, all
her options had been exhausted.
Sandra was an assistant professor.
According to Zimbardo, if an assis
tant professor is denied tenure, he or
she is "effectively fired." The Uni
versity, however, does give the assis
tant professors a grace period of a
year or so before they must leave.
