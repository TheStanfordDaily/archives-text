# Hospital patient given third heart transplant
## 
### 
Dr. Jerome Young, 43, became the
first patient ever to undergo three
heart transplant operations as he re
ceived his third heart transplant Fri
day morning at the Hospital.
According to cardiovascular sur
geon, Dr. Edward Stinson, Young
was in stable condition by Friday af
ternoon and now has "fairly good
chances of long-term survival."
Young's three transplant opera
tions were performed within a
period of two and a half years.
Young's own heart was first replaced
in an operation here on May 12,1976,
because of extensive coronary artery
disease.
A second heart transplant was
necessary because of recurrence of
the original disease, so Young un
derwent heart surgery again Oct. 3.

Young's second heart did not func
tion strongly and was not contracting
sufficiently to maintain body func
tions. According to Stinson, this is a
rare problem, although it has occur
red at least once before.
The third heart came from a Los
Angeles donor, and was transported
by plane with Stanford surgeons ac
companying it. Stanford has been
transporting hearts since 197 J.
Since that time, the Hospital has
transported more than 20 hearts. The
heart is flushed with and stored in an
electrolyte solution, then cooled to
near freezing. This technique slows
down the metabolic heart activity
and preserves it during transport.
In the past 10 years, surgeons here
have performed transplants in 155
patients, 66 of whom are still alive.
