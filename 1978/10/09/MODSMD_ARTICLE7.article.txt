## Kurt Osenbaugh Fraternities offer much 
### 
Welcome transfer students and freshmen. Be
fore you even get settled in here, I'm going to
ask you to jump ahead a few years. Imagine
yourself 20 years from now, flipping through the
pages of your Stanford Quad (annual). "Those
were the days," you sigh, as you remember the
highlights of your college life. What thoughts
will come to your mind? Your professors? Your
modern Europe textbooks? No, it will be your
friends and the good times you had together.
Your best friends are usually the people you live
with. That's why every year over 200 men choose
to join, and live in fraternity houses at the Uni
versity.
There are many different living situations av
ailable to University students on campus. In
choosing where to live too many students ig
nore the human element. Some dorms are con
sistantly more difficult to get into than others,
often simply because some dorms are newer or
have a more attractive set-up. The building is the
main consideration — not the people living
there.
Even so, it's the people and how they get
along that make for a good or bad living sitatu
ion. Fraternity men aren't better people than
those in other campus housing; but students
join fraternities because they want to live with
and do things with other members of a house,
creating a more harmonious and active group
than can be found in most other living units.
The best way to learn about the fraternities is
through members that you meet. They're not
straight from the movie Animal House, but the
film,did display the spirit and sense of fun that's
rarely found outside of fraternities. It's true that
we might not take ourselves or our studies with
the grave seriousness you often find at a school
like Stanford. We've got engineers and pre
meds, and even our share of geniuses who do
everyone's physics homework; but they realize
there's more to life than equations and dissect
ing rats. They may not have as much spare time
as some of us, but when they do, they'll have a
house full of people to spend it with.
"What types of people join fraternities?" Not
many people think of themselves as a certain

"type of person" because of their religion or
color — and certainly not because their school
residence has Greek letters on the door. Guys
like you, like your roommate, like the fellow
down the hall are all in fraternities. People who
view the fraternity system as catering to a small
group, "a certain type" of male, don't know
much about the 14 active houses at the Univer
sity. Fraternity activities vary with the tastes of
the members at each house, which may change
from year to year. Some have huge parties every
quarter, some never do. Some houses regularly
buy concert tickets, while some never do any
thing more cultural than watch Monday Night
Football.
What fraternities and their members do share
in common is a certain spirit, though even that is
emphasized to a different degree in each house.
People are living in a house because they want
to be there — nobody stuck them there. Frater
nity functions are geared so the members get to
know each other, as well as others outside their
house. And let's not forget fun. It's our spe
cialty. Fun has a place even at Stanford.
Why write about fraternities now, when rush
is in the spring? Several houses have openings
now, which transfer students could fill. They'll
be in touch. Also, I'd like all males here to keep
their eyes — and minds — open. Formal rush
can be three weeks of chaos if you go into it
blind. Remember, we're a lot more than big
parties on the weekends. And remember that
the kindly senior down the hall, who never
joined a fraternity, but went to a rush party
once, and tells you fraternities "aren't for you,"
probably knows little more about us than a first
quarter freshman.
When you go to the Big Game against Ber
keley, take a look at those older guys with the
University rooter buttons and the cardinal color
coordinated clothes. They're back because they
had so much fun when they were here before.
You can bet they were fraternity men, and you
can bet that their reunions are a whole lot more
fun than the Chemistry Department's.

Fraternity Council.)
