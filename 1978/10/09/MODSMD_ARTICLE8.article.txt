## Population problems 
### 
Why should we care
about population gtowth in
the U.S.? Because popula
tion problems touch all our
lives â€” even at this Univer
sity. They contribute to
highway congestion, hous
ing shortages, pollution,
and loss of scenic areas.
Many delays are caused
when too many people in an
area want the same service
at the same time. Popula
tion growth contributes to
inflation because, as we ex
tract more resources from
the earth, the ones that re
main take more effort to ex
tract, and so prices go up.
And when population den
sity becomes excessive,
there is more job pressure.
Some people denounce
birth control as an interfer
ence with nature. But the
same people do not de
nounce artificial death con
trol through vaccines and
health care. Our planet
simply cannot survive with
ever-increasing human
populations. Resource
exhaustion, erosion, and
war brought about by re
source conflicts, the desp
eration of the poor and the

availability of nuclear bomb
material are threats to survi
val which we all must face
up to in our lifetime^.
Some business people
say that population growth
is needed to keep the
economy strong. But they
do not realize the effects of
resource depletion on ris
ing costs. And ifwe hadzero
population growth (ZPC),
the poor could improve
their lot and consumf
more, and this would maki
up for the lack of increasing
numbers of consumers.
The U.S. should have a
national policy to achieve
ZPC as soon as possible.
This is in our own interest,
and also would provide an
example to other countries.
Because of the large
number of young people in
any growing population,
this will require that some
people have only one or no
children (this would be the
case anyway, because some
people are bound to have
more than two children).
So, just reaching a "re
placement" level of births is
not enough. If we do not
adopt a ZPC policy soon,

our population will grow
from 215 million to 300 mill
ion before stabilizing, with
all the increased use of
energy and resources that
this implies.
Small families and adop
tion should be encouraged
(there are many o.ther chil
dren waiting to be
adopted). Birth control in
formation should be more
widely dispersed, especially
tothepoor. The U.S. should
also offer more birth control
and development assis
tance to developing coun
tries, and offer more aid to
countries with strong birth
control programs. But our
own achievement of ZPC is
necessary to show that we
are not hypocritical.
The world of the future
will be one of international
conflict, inflation, shor
tages, and pollution. So we
must do everything we can
to safeguard the quality of
life. Every person should
consider it a necessity to
limit the size of his family.
ZPC will make this a much
more pleasant world to live
in.
