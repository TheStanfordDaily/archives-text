## Pakistan and the Ali Bhutto trial 
### 
(Some of the information in this article
was obtained during personal communica
tions between the author and former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark. Clark vis
ited 1 Pakistan recently and attended the
trail of Z.A. Bhutto.)
Rarely has a criminal proceeding held
such potential to alter history as does the
trial of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The appeal from
his earlier murder conviction is currently
heard in the supreme court of Pakistan. A
Bhutto execution would most surely gen
erate widespread upheavals in that coun
try where he enjoys overwhelming popu
lar support. A Pakistan in unrest could de
velop devastating geopolitical complica
tions. To understand this notion one
needs only a cursory glance at the map and
a brief review of recent history.
Pakistan, a country with staggering
human problems, such as illiteracy,
hunger and population growth, occupies
one of the world's most sensitive areas.
Guarding (with Oman) the entrance to the
Persian Gulf, it possesses a region in
tensely eyed by numerous foreign pow
ers.
The country was created in a traumatic
separation from British India in 1947.
Composed of a variety of often warring
peoples, joined only by the religion of Is
lam, Pakistan had a hard time from the
beginning. Separatist movements were
abundant in Pakistan's two great land mas
ses, divided by hostile Hindu India. In
1971, after a blood civil war, East Pakistan
seceeded to form Bangladesh.
Apart from the regional and historical
conflicts, Pakistan fits squarely in the
world game among the superpowers. The
Soviet Union, always anxious for access to

the sea, could have intense interest in
Pakistan. Domination of Middle East re
sources is at stake. Influence in Pakistan
would enhance Soviet position towards
India and would result in further encir
clement of China. China views Pakistan as
a buffer to Soviet expansionism. Any move
into Pakistan would most surely develop
intense hostility between the Soviet Union
and China. To the U.S., after the debacle
in Southeast Asia, Pakistan is crucial in the
balance of powers, Middle East oil and the
containment of the Soviet Union.
Bhutto was elected prime minister dur
ing a critical moment in Pakistan's history.
East Pakistan had just declared its inde
pendence and West Pakistan was stunned
by the humiliating defeat in the hands of
India. He immediately embarked on an
ambitious program of economic de
velopment. His educational and land re
forms were promising. As a leader in the
Third World, he commanded widespread
international respect. Suave, charming
and capable, he towered over his potential
rivals.
In July 1977, right after his Pakistan
People's Party swept to victory, a military
coup brought to power a junta under gen
eral Zia ul-Haq. People in Pakistan speak of
CIA activity. The coup and the junta's ac
tions and rhetoric are chillingly reminis
cent of Chile, the Philippines and Greece
(1967-74). The junta has resorted to a reign
of terror. It has among other things intro
duced flogging and amputations. It claims
divine guidance in establishing an exceed
ingly repressive and ruthless regime.
Bhutto was arrested in September of
1977 and charged with conspiracy to mur
der a minor political figure in 1974. Tried in

the high court of Lahore, he was fqund
guilty. The trial was grossly unfair. The
prosecution witnesses were a shady
bunch. Only one witness, under immunity
from prosecution, has linked Bhutto with
ordering the murder.
Prejudicial treatment can be amply de
monstrated. General Zia himself, in an in
terview with foreign journalists, had de
clared Bhutto guilty before such a verdict
was handed down. The controlled press
poisoned the atmosphere with constant
attacks on his character and record. The
chief justice in the case declared Bhutto's
"guilt" outside the courtroom. In his 145-
page opinion Bhutto is labeled as a "com
pulsive liar," "unruly," "hurling threats as
well as insults on us." The incredible thing
is that Bhutto did not present a defense.
Important phases of the trial were con
ducted in camera.
The entire case seems like a cliche
frameup. It is an unfortunate but frequent
event in military dictatorships to charge
dangerous political opponents with crimi
nal law violations.
The trial is currently on appeal in Pakis
tan's supreme court with the proceedings
to last over the next few weeks. Executions
in Pakistan follow the final verdict almost
immediately. Amazingly, the trial of Ali
Bhutto and the potential repercussions of
his execution have escaped the attention
of the Western press. Pakistan, for reasons
already stated, could easily develop into
another Vietnam, even with graver com
plications. At stake is not only the life of a
man but the peace in the area and the
world.
