"Tit in Sons of Different Mothers.''
"This album constitutes a collaboration, experimental in nature,
between Tim and myself. It is an attempt for both of us to move
outside our own recognizable boundaries and try new directions —
new forms of music which ice rarely get to explore on our own. It
is a chance to stretch, an opportunity to grow, and a
hell of a lot of fun." ..
