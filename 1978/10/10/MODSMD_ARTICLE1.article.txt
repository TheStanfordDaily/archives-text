# 'Circle of Gold' chain letter spreads, but authorities say it's illegal
## 
### BILL POWEL 
The "Circle of Gold".
Reports of people receiving as much as
$100,000 through the Bay Area-chain letter
scheme have attracted campus buyers, in
cluding some professors.
However, many don't seem to know the
letters are considered illegal by state and
federal authorities.
The Circle of Gold probably started in
Marin County, according to San Francisco
postal officials.
In recent months, the chain moved down
the peninsula and is spreading like wildfire
here.
How to play
To participate in the Circle of Gold (or
"Circle of Love" as some call it), you must
invest $100. First, you buy a copy of the let
ter, with 12 names attached, for $50. You
send the person at the top of the list $50 in
cash. Then, you cross off the top name, add
yours to the bottom, and sell two more
copies of the letter for $50 each. After you've
broken even, you wait for other people to

sell their letters.
According to the scheme, you should re
ceive $102,400 by the time your name
reaches the top of the list. The letter states
that you start receiving money 12 days after
selling your two copies.
However, in practice, the "pyramid" pro
cess can take up to a month or more, accord
ing to several Stanford community resi
dents, who have entered the chain.
'Tremendous value'
Industrial Engineering Prof. David
Thompson said he joined the circle because
he felt it was of "tremendous educational
value" to sell the chain. He said the whole
process of communicating one's feelings
about the letter was "enlightening and valu
able."
Many students, who normally ignore
chain letters which do not involve money,
have taken an interest in this scheme.
"The best thing about it is that you have
nothing to lose after you've sold your two
letters, said one Circle of Gold participant

here. "Once you've recouped your invest
ment, you just wait for the $50 to start rolling
in."
The key to finding prospective buyers, ac
cording to one chain member, is to avoid
saturated markets and start a "colony" in an
untapped geographic area. He said he plan
ned to find buyers in Southern California.
Faithful
The amount of money a person receives
depends on how faithful successive buyers
are to the chain. That's why Bob Baer, of Palo
Alto, set up a Circle of Gold buyer/seller
service last week. He said he "wanted to
make sure it (the letter) worked," because
"it was getting blocked" by those who
waited several days to sell their letters.
Baer said he started his referral system as a
public service to speed up the time lag bet
ween sales. He said he charges $15 per sale
and added that response had been quite
good so far.
Even though the Circle of Gold letter
states that it "falls within all current laws,"

local authorities said the plan violates both
state and federal statutes. The U.S. Code
states "the use of mails at any time to carry
out a (chain letter) scheme is under federal
jurisdiction," according to San Jose deputy
District Attorney Al Weger.
San Francisco Postal Inspector Richard
Schlueter, who is investigating the Circle of
Gold, said he had received many lists of
names. The evidence he gathers will be
given to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution.
There has never been a prosecuted case
involving a chain letter on the federal level.
The Circle of Gold also violates the
California penal code, which states that any
one, who "contrives, prepares, sets up,
proposes, or operates any endless chain is
guilty of a misdemeanor."
An "endless chain," according to the code
is "any scheme for the disposal or distribu
tion of property whereby a participant pays a
valuable consideration for the chance to re
ceive compensation for introducing one or
more additional persons into participation

in the scheme or for the chance to receive
compensation when a person introduced by
the participant introduces a new particip
ant."
The violation can bring a $500 fine or six
months in jail.
Endless chain
The Circle of Gold qualifies as an endless
chain, according to Palo Alto Police Detec
tive Ed Austin. He said a chain operated by
telephone, mail, or word of mouth, is consi
dered illegal.
Austin added that the problem with chain
letters is that the people, who start them,
usually make large sums of money, but the
people farther down the pyramid lose
money. Those who can't sell their letters are
out of luck, Austin said, since they are
"gambling illegally."
Austin also said those who give letter par
ties to buy and sell letters are also liable for
prosecution. These so-called "Blast-Off"
parties have been operating very success
fully in San Francisco and Marin County.
