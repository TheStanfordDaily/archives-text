# Tension common among students
## 
### EDWIN CERVANTES 
Deciding on a major. Trying
to make friends. Taking mid
term exams. They're common
experiences for all college stu
dents. But they easily create
aggravation, stress and often
uncontrolled tension.
According to counselors at

The Bridge, a peer counseling
office here, tension is "a com
mon frustration among stu
dents."
Students who have procras
tinated in their studies during
freshman year return here
planning to score straight A's
the second time around. They

often don't. Students nurtured
in the freshman dorm, often
live in a new environment dur
ing sophomore year. These
changes and others create
panic-ridden situations for
students, according to Susan
Beil and Peter Salovey, resi
dent counselors at The Bridge.
"During freshman year,
there are lots of people to con
tact, lots of planned activities
and a lot of people watching
over you. All of a sudden it's
sophomore year and you're
out on your own. You come
back sophomore year con
vinced Stanford's going to be
perfect. It just isn't, and you
panic," Beil said.
Among the 50 students who
visitThe Bridge weekly, about
one-third feel academic ten
sions. Many of these tensions
relate to life here. Students
wonder about future plans,
such as graduate school pos
sibilities. They worry about the
proper major to declare or
about changes that must be
made in curriculum or living
situations.
"There is decision-making
throughout the undergraduate
experience. Sometimes there
needs to be a reassessment.
This often leads to stressful

situations," Dr. David Doro
son, directorof counselingand
psychological services at Cow
ell Student Health Center,
said.
Tension may reveal itself in a
number of clinical symptoms
such as headaches, stomach
disorders and sleep problems.
Not uncommon among stu
dents suffering from tension is
a "sense of alienation and loss
of self-esteem," Doroson said.
"A lot of people don't look at
all of the external factors that
could be making them feel
stressed and instead they feel
they have no control over their
own lives. They think they're
failures," Salovey said.
Tension is "statistically nor
mal," Dorosn said. One of the
most debilitating aspects of
tension is that some people
who suffer from stress insist
that no one else can relate to or
understand their problem.
This often increases the inten
sity of an individual's own an
xieties, Doroson added.
There are several ways of de
aling with tension. Many
people relieve mild anxieties
by reading, exercising or talk
ing with friends. Others con
sult The Bridge, which offers
one-to-one peer counseling
and a variety of encounter
workshops. Huston House,
psychological services of Cow
ell, has trained psychiatrists,
social workers and
psychologists to work with
students. Ih addition Huston
House offers stress manage
ment workshops.

Tension may reveal itself in a
number of clinical symptoms
such as headaches, stomach
disorders and sleep problems.
Not uncommon among stu
dents suffering from tension is
a "sense of alienation and loss
of self-esteem," Doroson said.
"A lot of people don't look at
all of the external factors that
could be making them feel
stressed and instead they feel
they have no control over their
own lives. They think they're
failures," Salovey said.
Tension is "statistically nor
mal," Dorosn said. One of the
most debilitating aspects of
tension is that some people
who suffer from stress insist
that no one else can relate to or
understand their problem.
This often increases the inten
sity of an individual's own an
xieties, Doroson added.
There are several ways of de
aling with tension. Many
people relieve mild anxieties
by reading, exercising or talk
ing with friends. Others con

Deciding on a major. Trying
to make friends. Taking mid
term exams. They're common
experiences for all college stu
dents. But they easily create
aggravation, stress and often
uncontrolled tension.
According to counselors at

The Bridge, a peer counseling
office here, tension is "a com
mon frustration among stu
dents."
Students who have procras
tinated in their studies during
freshman year return here
planning to score straight A's
the second time around. They

often don't. Students nurtured
in the freshman dorm, often
live in a new environment dur
ing sophomore year. These
changes and others create
panic-ridden situations for
students, according to Susan
Beil and Peter Salovey, resi
dent counselors at The Bridge.
"During freshman year,
there are lots of people to con
tact, lots of planned activities
and a lot of people watching
over you. All of a sudden it's
sophomore year and you're
out on your own. You come
back sophomore year con
vinced Stanford's going to be
perfect. It just isn't, and you
panic," Beil said.
Among the 50 students who
visitThe Bridge weekly, about
one-third feel academic ten
sions. Many of these tensions
relate to life here. Students
wonder about future plans,
such as graduate school pos
sibilities. They worry about the
proper major to declare or
about changes that must be
made in curriculum or living
situations.
"There is decision-making
throughout the undergraduate
experience. Sometimes there
needs to be a reassessment.
This often leads to stressful

situations," Dr. David Doro
son, directorof counselingand
psychological services at Cow
ell Student Health Center,
said.
