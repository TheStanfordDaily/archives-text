# Cheap air fares available
## ASSU charters may end 
### RACHEL BAGBY 
Flying the "friendly skies" may be more dif
ficult than usual for students here if a recent
decision by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to
deregulate airlines fare and routing is approved
by the U.S. Congress, according to Susan
Maher, assistant manager of the Sequoia Travel
Center here.
CAB's new policy allows airlines to slash fares
by as much as 50 percent in all domestic markets
without CAB approval. This would mean an in
crease in "fair" fare competition which presum
ably would result in lower air fares.
According to Maher, CAB's policy won't be
implemented until it receives approval by Con
gress.
The potential price cuts have been touted as a
boon to the air traveller. However, some effects
of the deregulation may prove to be more of a
bane to students.
Lower fares will probably lead to an increase
in the number of air travellers. According to
Denise O'Leary, manager of the ASSU Travel
Service, airlines will have to use many planes
previously reserved for charters to handle the
increased volume.
"This will result in our paying exhorbitant
prices for the few planes available for charters',"
said O'Leary.
Charter flights compete with other flights for
customers. The ASSU Travel Service offers char
ters to New York, Boston, Chicago and
Washington at approximately 50 percent off
regular coach fares.
In an attempt to reduce competition airlines
have already raised the prices for which services
like ASSU Travel can charter planes. O'Leary
said part of the approximate five to 10 percent

price increase in ASSU's charter fares is attribut
able to the airlines' higher charter rates.
O'Leary projects that ASSU Travel may have to
discontinue its charters after Christmas. There is
a strong possibility that the annual Hawaii char
ter won't "get off the ground this spring," she
said.
Super-saver fares offered by many airlines pro
vide students an alternative to the ASSU service.
The typical super-saver fare affords air travelers
up to 50 percent off regular coach fares. To take
advantage of this discount one must book the
flight and buy tickets at least 30 days in advance.
The super-saver traveller is required to stay at
least 7 days but not more than 45 days at his or
her destination. This is ideal for students who go
home during school recesses.
But there are a limited number of super-saver
seats on each flight. According to Maher, the
super-saver seats for Christmas are "virtually fil
led."
"We are swamped," Maher said. "More stu
dents are coming in earlier to assure themselves
seats."
The airlines are not planning to increase the
percentage of super-saver seats available per
flight, Maher said. If ASSU Travel discontinues
its charter students who usually use that service
and are unable to get super-saver tickets will
have to pay regular coach fares.
The airlines are planning a fare increase "for
all domestic flights in the continental U. 5.," said
Maher. This increase is scheduled to go into
effect in early November.
No one knows what will happen, Maher said.
With all the projections, speculations, increases
and decreases air travel has become "a giant
mess."

With the advent of super-saver airline fares for passengers, ASSU's charter flight rates on domestic
travel may not seem so cheap. In fact, the ASSU Travel Service may be forced to close their charter air
service if current deregulation continues.
