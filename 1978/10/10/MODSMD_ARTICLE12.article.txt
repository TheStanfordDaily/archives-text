# Stanford lends a hand to handicapped students

Getting out of bed, using the bathroom and
going to class are all routine tasks that most
students never think twice about. But what
would life be like if all these routine tasks
suddenly became problems, as they are for
the physically limited students here on cam
pus?
The Advisory Committee on the Physically
Limited, and the Student Affairs Liaison
Committee on Physically Limited Students are
two groups on campus which deal with the
special problems encountered by students
with mobility, visual and hearing limitations.
The advisory committee, composed mostly
of physically limited students, researches
both the mechanical and social problems
facing the physically limited student, and then
attempts to find solutions that will "make
every program usable to the physically limited
here," said Assoc. Provost Wayne Price,
committee chairman.
The student affairs committee, staffed by
representatives from various student ser
vices, such as Tresidder Union, Cowell Health
Center and the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, tries to meet the material needs
of physically limited students.
The initial problem facing the Student Af
fairs Committee is identifying the physically
limited students on campus. Many students
feel that being classified as physically limited
would hurt their learning experience here,
said Boyd.
According to Nick Zirpolo, a physically li
mited graduate student, there are approxi
mately 15 mobility, six visual, and six hearing
limited students on campus.
"University buildings are available for
everybody to use. Anyone qualified to be here

should be able to make use of every prog
ram," said Price.
Each physically limited student faces un
ique problems. A person in a wheelchair re
quires ramps, wider doors that open easily,
relatively straight halls, and special desks and
tables.
A blind student requires reading materials
in Braille or the use of an Optacon, an instru
ment which converts visual print images to
corresponding tactile print which can be read
with the fingers.
Lectures are a problem faced by the deaf.
Special alarms are needed to warn a deaf per
son of a fire.
All new buildings constructed on campus
are "barrier free," so that all parts of the build
ing are accessible to the physically limited.
Buildings already in existence can be made
"readily accessible," with a part of the build
ing accessible to the physically limited for a
cost of one-half of one percent of the original
construction cost, Price said.
Every program on campus is accessible to
the physically limited student, said Price. Al
though not every building is "readily accessi
ble," every class offered here can be
scheduled in an accessible building.
There are special campus maps, convenient
parking spaces and even golf carts available to
aid the physically limited students on campus.
The physically limited students face more
limitations than those their handicap alone
imposes on them. "Normal" people can
create more problems because of their diffi
culty in dealing with the physically limited,
said Zirpolo.
"Disabilities are much less important than
abilities," Zirpolo concluded. "People with
physical limitations are still people."
