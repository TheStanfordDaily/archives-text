# Watch less, learn more
## Study says TV poor teacher in U.S.

"American kids invest more
time, but extract less informa
tion" from television than do
Israeli children, according to
Prof. Gavriel Salomon, re
search associate in the School
of Education here.
A recent experiment con
ducted by Salomon, found
that, because they "made a
greater mental effort," Israeli
nine-year-olds also increased
their mental skills more than a
similar group of Boston
youngsters, through watching
television.
Salomon said one reason for
the difference is that the
American children's attention
is diverted by commercials —
none of which appear on Is
rael's all-public television
broadcasting.
He also said Americans have
a "tremendous choice" in TV
programs.
"If the kids are not excited
on the spot, they shift channels
— but there is only one chan
nel in Israel," Salomon
explained. Thus, Americans
may be more casual viewers,
he said.
"Another reason which gives
an advantage to Israeli children
is that there is only one TV set
in each household. The family
tends to watch it together. We
know from other research that
children gain more — not only
from TV — when their parents

participate with them."
According to Salomon, the
United States and Israel were
chosen for the comparison be
cause they represent two "ex
tremes" in television broad
casting. Also, Salomon is here
on leave from Hebrew Univer
sity in Jerusalem, where he
headed the Graduate Depart
ment of Educational Psychol
ogy-
The experiment was
"peripheral" to a larger study
Salomon had been working on
for seven years, which investi
gated the effect of a medium's
language on mental skills, he

said.
"Different languages — such
as music, movement and
speech — require different
mental abilities to understand
them," explained Salomon. To
understand a painting and a
movie, for example, requires
dissimilar sets of skills, he said.
Another phase of the study
explored the effect the Sesame
Street program has on
youngsters' mental skills. The
show's technique of present
ing many short messages, skits
and animated sequences,
aimed at teaching, develops
different and probably more

mental skills than do other
programs, Salomon said.
However, it was also disco
vered that the program may
reduce children's ability to
persevere through a task,
Salomon said.
Salomon however, did say
that children learn from
Sesame Street but if a gap exists
between two children's mental
skills, the "lesser" one will not
close the gap.
"It is a general educational
phenomenon that those who
haVe a head start will benefit
more than those who begin at a
disadvantage," he said.
