## Editorials Dorm needed now 
### 
It was pleasing to hear Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons say last
week that a proposal to build a large,
new dormitory should be submitted
to the Board of Trustees before the
end of the year.
The Daily believes such a project is
long overdue and strongly recom
mends that the Boad approve plans
to construct a residence complex
west of Lagunita Court to house
more than 800 students.
The University has long taken
pride in its residential education
program. While the serious lack of
on-campus housing by no means
alone prevented the system from
being endeared to its residents, the
effort to alleviate the housing shor
tage will undoubtedly please many
students, and rightly so.
Considerable anxiety exists during
spring housing draws as students vie
for the precious campus spots.
While living off-campus has its ad
vantages, on-campus living is also an

important part of attending Stanford,
and should be available for those de
sirous of it.
Although some argue ttyere is not a
real need for expanded student
housing due to vacancies in resi
dences each spring quarter, this ar
gument should be immediately re
jected.
Once a student is forced off
campus fall quarter, it is hardly
reasonable to expect that student to
go through all the trouble of moving
on-campus for just one quarter.
More than likely, that person is
committed to a full-year lease and
committed roommates.
Such a desire to avoid these time
consuming hassles does not mean
that the openings would not be filled
if they were available in the fall. Now
these spaces will become available in
a few years if the Board of Trustees
gives the go-ahead for what is very
logical and needed construction.
