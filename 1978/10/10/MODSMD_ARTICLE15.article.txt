# Fee Assessment â€” KZSU Yes
## 
### 
KZSU, Stanford's FM radio station,
is requesting a $1 fee assessment to
be collected winter quarter for sta
tion capital improvements. The Daily
unanimously recommends a "Yes"
vote for this proposal.
When KZSU boosted its power
from 50 to 500 watts last spring, addi
tional responsibiltiy accompanied
this increase in potential listenership.
KZSU now reaches from South San
Francisco to south of San Jose and
across the Bay. No longer does KZSU
serve just Stanford and the Palo Alto
area. Additionally, the Federal Com
munications Commission will seri
ously take into consideration this in
crease in service area at license re
newal time.

The over $10,000 collected froni the
proposed winter assessment will be
used for remodeling both the news
office and record library. Other im
provements include replacing out
dated electronic and amplification
equipment and constructing an
eight-foot chain lock fence around
the transmitter for security.
This request is completely reason
able to meet the demands of an in
creased listenership area. A 20 per
cent voter turnout is constitutionally
required for a fee assessment to be
validated. Therefore, realizing KZSU
is almost solely dependent on stu
dent fees for its support, the Daily
encourages a "Yes" vote Thursday
and Friday.
