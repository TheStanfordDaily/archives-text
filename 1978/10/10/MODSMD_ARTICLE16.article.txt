## ASSU Senate unreformable 
### 
We thought your editorial of Oct. 6, on the
CRAP amendment, ignored the practical
realities of the senate. Though agreeing that
"the senate desperately needs reform," you
opposed the abolition of the senate because
that would concentrate too much power in the
COP, and that it would lessen the "integrity and
power" of the ASSU in the minds of the ad
ministration.
As a practical matter, that just isn't true. The
senate simply doesn't haveenough power to act
as a check on the COP. Furthermore, even if it
had the power, senators never gain the exper
tise or experience to effectively use it.
Nor would the abolition of the senate open
the ASSU up for further ridicule. How could the
ASSU sink lower? After years of half-baked re
solutions on yell leaders, "bicycle darwinism,"
and Harp Seals. After years of committees not
meeting. After years of petty infighting. Can the
ASSU really lose respect? That presumes it still
has some.
All the candidates —and the Daily — admit
that the senate needs reform. Yet no one has
proposed a solution to the three fundamental
defects of the senate as an institution: the lack
of power, the lack of time spent by senators, and
the lack of a representative electoral process.
The current candidates are all employing typi
cally unrealistic platforms,, that have met
worked in the past; reform will not come from
them. If these are the best proposals that can
flow from a campaign where senate reform is

the prime issue, the senate deserves destruction
— it has had its chance to reform itself. To bring
about any effective reform, the slate must be
wiped clean. The COP, or volunteer groups (like
CRAP), can then come up with comprehensive
reform proposals.
At the press conference on Sunday, many of
the candidates stated that the senate was the
main focal point for student activism and rep
resentation. This blithely ignores reality. We
should be concerned with the quality — not
quantity — of such representation.
The senate has never achieved anything of
significance on any of the issues that most di
rectly affect students. The COP has dealt with
tenure and the quality of teaching. Volunteer
groups, like SCRIP, have dealt with divestment.
But the senate? What actions of the senate stand
out in past years? Election scandals, resolutions
on foreign affairs, political grandstanding, and
phantom committees. Students need quality
representation — not a farce.
Contrary to the statement in the Daily, the
intention of CRAP is not to open the ASSU to
further ridicule by eliminating the Senate. That's
simply not possible. If student government at
Stanford is to survive as a viable institution,
some fundamental changes are necessary. Un
less CRAP passes, we won't ever see them.

The current candidates are all employing typi
cally unrealistic platforms,, that have met
worked in the past; reform will not come from
them. If these are the best proposals that can
flow from a campaign where senate reform is

the prime issue, the senate deserves destruction
— it has had its chance to reform itself. To bring
about any effective reform, the slate must be
wiped clean. The COP, or volunteer groups (like
CRAP), can then come up with comprehensive
reform proposals.
At the press conference on Sunday, many of
the candidates stated that the senate was the
main focal point for student activism and rep
resentation. This blithely ignores reality. We
should be concerned with the quality — not
quantity — of such representation.
The senate has never achieved anything of
significance on any of the issues that most di
rectly affect students. The COP has dealt with
tenure and the quality of teaching. Volunteer
groups, like SCRIP, have dealt with divestment.
But the senate? What actions of the senate stand
out in past years? Election scandals, resolutions
on foreign affairs, political grandstanding, and
phantom committees. Students need quality
representation — not a farce.
Contrary to the statement in the Daily, the
intention of CRAP is not to open the ASSU to
further ridicule by eliminating the Senate. That's
simply not possible. If student government at
Stanford is to survive as a viable institution,
some fundamental changes are necessary. Un
less CRAP passes, we won't ever see them.

We thought your editorial of Oct. 6, on the
CRAP amendment, ignored the practical
realities of the senate. Though agreeing that
"the senate desperately needs reform," you
opposed the abolition of the senate because
that would concentrate too much power in the
COP, and that it would lessen the "integrity and
power" of the ASSU in the minds of the ad
ministration.
As a practical matter, that just isn't true. The
senate simply doesn't haveenough power to act
as a check on the COP. Furthermore, even if it
had the power, senators never gain the exper
tise or experience to effectively use it.
Nor would the abolition of the senate open
the ASSU up for further ridicule. How could the
ASSU sink lower? After years of half-baked re
solutions on yell leaders, "bicycle darwinism,"
and Harp Seals. After years of committees not
meeting. After years of petty infighting. Can the
ASSU really lose respect? That presumes it still
has some.
All the candidates —and the Daily — admit
that the senate needs reform. Yet no one has
proposed a solution to the three fundamental
defects of the senate as an institution: the lack
of power, the lack of time spent by senators, and
the lack of a representative electoral process.
