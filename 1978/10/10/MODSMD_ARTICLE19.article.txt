## ERA offers justice and equality 
### 
Equalilty of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States
or by any state on account of sex.
Proposed 27th Amendment
On March 22,1972, 49 years after its ini
tial introduction the now celebrated Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) was approved by
the Senate in the language quoted above
with a seven year limit for ratification.
Within one year of Congressional ap
proval, 30 of the necessary 38 states
ratified the Amendment. Last Friday, how
ever, over six and a half years later, the
U.S. Senate adopted a proposal to extend
the ERA's date of ratification, a proposal
without which the Amendment may have
died. And so once again, the now over
half-century old debate continues.
The necessity of adopting the ERA is evi
denced by the considerable remnants of
discrimination that women face. Unfortu
nately discrimination on the basis of sex is
one of the few remaining socially accepta
ble prejudices. Women comprise one
third of the labor force, and yet on the
average they can expect only 60 percent of
the salaries men receive for the same job.
This may be due in part to the less de
veloped job skills of women but the major
part of the differential can be blamed on
past and present discrimination.
Discrimination extends to the political
arena. Women account for the majority of
registered voters and yet they make up a
small minority of national, state and local
officials. The problem is characterized by
1972 presidential candidate Shirley
Chisholm's remark that she faced more
discrimination because she is a woman
than because she is black.
Discrimination is an evil which cannot
be tolerated in a free society. Certain pro
visions such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963

have attempted to ameliorate economic
discrimination but by and large they have
been ineffectual and unenforceable.
The ERA promises to provide a constitu
tional precedent guaranteeing equality
under the law. In principle, the ideal goals
outlined by the ERA cannot be denied — to
extend equal rights to all citizens surely
remains our highest ethical, moral and
constitutional responsibility. In practical
ity, the ERA would offer the federal back
ing so needed to enforce the provisions
and statutes guaranteeing equal oppor
tunity to all Americans. In short, the ERA is
not a movement toward merely "Women's
Lib" but rather toward "People's Lib."
The broad language of the Amendment
itself has proven to be the major area of
opposition as it leaves much room for mis
interpretation. Opponents of the ERA
stress arguments ranging from Senator
Sam Ervin's belief in 1972 that it would
"destroy the social fabric of America," to
the fear of "unisex" public restrooms.
Most of these arguments are unfounded
but, nevertheless, for the sake of argu
ment they deserve mentioning.
Mandatory conscription and other such
arguments are based upon unsubstan
tiated fears. There is no military draft, and
a qualified woman should have as much
right as a man to volunteer for the service
of her country. The current "sex neutral"
physical standards such as rigorous exer
cise, conditioning and endurance qualifi
cations would virtually eliminate the pos
sibility of women reaching active combat
duty. Sen. Marlow Cook added, "Combat
today may be a lady sitting at a computer at
a missile site in North Dakota" — surely a
qualified person should not be denied
such a position on the basis of sex alone.
As far as protective laws are concerned

the ERA would not eliminate them, but
rather it would extend them to include
both men and women. For example in the
case of alimony and child support the ob
ligation of payment will rest upon the
spouse that has the greater ability to pro
vide for the children. All current laws pro
tecting labor conditions as well as privacy
will either remain intact or will be ex
tended so as to comply with simply equal
ity under the law.
Under the 14th Amendment, due pro
cess and equal protection of the law have
been extended to all citizens. This in
cludes questions of fundamental rights
(the right to vote etc.) and rights regarding
suspect classification (arising over race,
national origin and economic status).
Women are thus constitutionally guaran
teed certain fundamental rights. However,
the Supreme Court has yet to rule that
discrimination on the basis of gender is a
denial of fundamental rights, nor has it
held that sex is an aspect of suspect clas
sification. Women are thus left unpro
tected in many states against discrimina
tion for jobs, housing and public service.
The ERA provides a reasonable answer
to the current problem of sex discrimina
tion. Its goal is not to make us all equal —
even the strongest ERA supporters admit
that there are inherent differences bet
ween men and women, and rightly so
(thank goodness). The ERA does, how
ever, establish a constitutional basis for
equal opportunity and equal protection.
The function <of the law should be to
promote the highest moral good, and the
ERA seems to be in line with this
philosophy. It promises to offer Ameri
cans simple justice and equality under the
law, and in this light should be adopted.
