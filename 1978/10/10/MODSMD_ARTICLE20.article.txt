Daily needs to face
responsibilities
It has come to the point
where it boggles the mind and
alienates the senses to open the
Stanford Daily. There seems to
be two possible explanations
for Monday, October 2nd's
Daily: either the Daily has all
the subtlety and good taste of
Don Rickles, or it is on a relent
less campaign to lose at least
half its readership. Whatever
the case may be, I think it's
time the Daily matures a little
and faces its responsibility to
serve the Stanford community
— the entire community.
This is written on behalf of
the many women and men who
were offended by the
stereotypical and downright
tacky advertisment for Thomas
Temporaries that appeared on
page 5 of the Daily for Oct. 2.
The piece I refer to was a photo
of a young woman, attired in a
well-built bikini, captioned
"But Can She Type?"
Please, folks, isn't that kind
of attitude a bit out of fashion? It
was amusing to read that slo
gan when it was emblazoned
on a poster of former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir that
appeared a few years ago, be
cause that poster ridiculed the
stereotype: here was a woman
of accomplishment, a woman
who wielded great political
power, a woman who even the
"MCPs" would agree did not
need to know how to type in
order to be useful. The tone of
that poster was not the tone of
the Thomas Temporaries ad,
nor was that the ad's implica
tion.
To make the situation a little
more clear, to demonstrate
exactly why the ad was disturb
ing, let's change the photo and
the caption. Let's make the
photo one of a black person,
and change the caption to "But
Will You Have to Set Him
Free?" It is now obvious what
was wrong with the ad as it ap
peared: it exploited the "old
boy" sentiment about a minor
ity group's "proper" function

in the working world. The ad as
altered in this example would
be more shocking, more likely
to rouse an angry response,
even more likely to be rejected
by the advertising department
of the Daily as unsuitable for
print, but it would not be more
insulting than the ad that was
accepted for Monday's Daily.
I conclude by urging the
Stanford Daily's staff to be
more considerate and more
tactful in future assembling of
its product, and by expressing
a wish that the Thomas Tem
poraries ad lost more custom
ers than it gained. By the way,
I'd like you to know that, de
spite the fact that I am a wo
man, I typed this without the
aid of a bikini — most people
who can type don't wear them.
Surprise!

Editor's Note: When the ad
Reingold refers to was shown
to me for approval, I judged all
three Thomas Temporaries ad
vertisements at once. The sec
ond ad showed a bare-chested
male and the third ad pictured
Richard Nixon. Under the male
ad was: "But can he type?" and
under the Nixon ad was: "Hav
ing trouble finding a job?" Mis
takingly all three ads were
judged together, and therefore
were not seen as perpetuating
a stereotype, but instead came
across in a humorous vein.
However, readers only see
one of those advertisements a
day, and in hindsight, the Daily
should have seriously consi
dered not running the ad in
question.
Thomas Temporaries has
also been made aware of many
readers' concerns regarding
this ad, and I doubt they will try
placing a similar advertisement
again.

Brown recognizes
student vote
Does a small, private institu
tion have what it takes to draw

the attention of an incumbent
governor? Apparently so, be
cause today's "Brown Noon
Rally" at White Plaza indicates
that Stanford students' votes
really do count.
The special appearance of
Kathleen Brown Rice, Gover
nor Jerry Brown's sister, illus
trates the growing importance
of the student vote throughout
the state. Her question and
answer period will provide
students the opportunity to
raise vital issues concerning
the governor's re-election
campaign.
In the next few weeks, vari
ous University organizations
will be offering special speak
ers and programs related to the
November general elections.

Although the Stanford student
body is small in comparison to
other institutions, the success
of the recent registration drive
displayed a considerable polit
ical awareness and concern.
Nearly 2000 new registrations
were added to the already high
percentage of registered stu
dents at Stanford.
Kathleen Brown Rice's ap
pearance will give students the
opportunity to express their
diverse views and expand their
understanding of the critical is
sues surrounding the upcom
ing election.

and change the caption to "But
Will You Have to Set Him
Free?" It is now obvious what
was wrong with the ad as it ap
peared: it exploited the "old
boy" sentiment about a minor
ity group's "proper" function

in the working world. The ad as
altered in this example would
be more shocking, more likely
to rouse an angry response,
even more likely to be rejected
by the advertising department
of the Daily as unsuitable for
print, but it would not be more
insulting than the ad that was
accepted for Monday's Daily.
I conclude by urging the
Stanford Daily's staff to be
more considerate and more
tactful in future assembling of
its product, and by expressing
a wish that the Thomas Tem
poraries ad lost more custom
ers than it gained. By the way,
I'd like you to know that, de
spite the fact that I am a wo
man, I typed this without the
aid of a bikini — most people
who can type don't wear them.

Editor's Note: When the ad
Reingold refers to was shown
to me for approval, I judged all
three Thomas Temporaries ad
vertisements at once. The sec
ond ad showed a bare-chested
male and the third ad pictured
Richard Nixon. Under the male
ad was: "But can he type?" and
under the Nixon ad was: "Hav
ing trouble finding a job?" Mis
takingly all three ads were
judged together, and therefore
were not seen as perpetuating
a stereotype, but instead came
across in a humorous vein.
However, readers only see
one of those advertisements a
day, and in hindsight, the Daily
should have seriously consi
dered not running the ad in
question.
Thomas Temporaries has
also been made aware of many
readers' concerns regarding
this ad, and I doubt they will try
placing a similar advertisement
again.

Brown recognizes
student vote
Does a small, private institu
tion have what it takes to draw

the attention of an incumbent
governor? Apparently so, be
cause today's "Brown Noon
Rally" at White Plaza indicates
that Stanford students' votes
really do count.
The special appearance of
Kathleen Brown Rice, Gover
nor Jerry Brown's sister, illus
trates the growing importance
of the student vote throughout
the state. Her question and
answer period will provide
students the opportunity to
raise vital issues concerning
the governor's re-election
campaign.
In the next few weeks, vari
ous University organizations
will be offering special speak
ers and programs related to the
November general elections.

Although the Stanford student
body is small in comparison to
other institutions, the success
of the recent registration drive
displayed a considerable polit
ical awareness and concern.
Nearly 2000 new registrations
were added to the already high
percentage of registered stu
dents at Stanford.
Kathleen Brown Rice's ap
pearance will give students the
opportunity to express their
diverse views and expand their
understanding of the critical is
sues surrounding the upcom
ing election.

Daily needs to face
responsibilities
It has come to the point
where it boggles the mind and
alienates the senses to open the
Stanford Daily. There seems to
be two possible explanations
for Monday, October 2nd's
Daily: either the Daily has all
the subtlety and good taste of
Don Rickles, or it is on a relent
less campaign to lose at least
half its readership. Whatever
the case may be, I think it's
time the Daily matures a little
and faces its responsibility to
serve the Stanford community
— the entire community.
This is written on behalf of
the many women and men who
were offended by the
stereotypical and downright
tacky advertisment for Thomas
Temporaries that appeared on
page 5 of the Daily for Oct. 2.
The piece I refer to was a photo
of a young woman, attired in a
well-built bikini, captioned
"But Can She Type?"
Please, folks, isn't that kind
of attitude a bit out of fashion? It
was amusing to read that slo
gan when it was emblazoned
on a poster of former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir that
appeared a few years ago, be
cause that poster ridiculed the
stereotype: here was a woman
of accomplishment, a woman
who wielded great political
power, a woman who even the
"MCPs" would agree did not
need to know how to type in
order to be useful. The tone of
that poster was not the tone of
the Thomas Temporaries ad,
nor was that the ad's implica
tion.
To make the situation a little
more clear, to demonstrate
exactly why the ad was disturb
ing, let's change the photo and
the caption. Let's make the
photo one of a black person,
and change the caption to "But
Will You Have to Set Him

Thomas Temporaries has

Brown recognizes
student vote
Does a small, private institu
tion have what it takes to draw

the attention of an incumbent
governor? Apparently so, be
cause today's "Brown Noon
Rally" at White Plaza indicates
that Stanford students' votes
really do count.
The special appearance of
Kathleen Brown Rice, Gover
nor Jerry Brown's sister, illus
trates the growing importance
of the student vote throughout
the state. Her question and
answer period will provide
students the opportunity to
raise vital issues concerning
the governor's re-election
campaign.
In the next few weeks, vari
ous University organizations
will be offering special speak
ers and programs related to the
November general elections.

Although the Stanford student
body is small in comparison to
other institutions, the success
of the recent registration drive
displayed a considerable polit
ical awareness and concern.
Nearly 2000 new registrations
were added to the already high
percentage of registered stu
dents at Stanford.
Kathleen Brown Rice's ap
pearance will give students the
opportunity to express their
diverse views and expand their
understanding of the critical is
sues surrounding the upcom
ing election.

Daily needs to face
responsibilities
It has come to the point
where it boggles the mind and
alienates the senses to open the
Stanford Daily. There seems to
be two possible explanations
for Monday, October 2nd's
Daily: either the Daily has all
the subtlety and good taste of
Don Rickles, or it is on a relent
less campaign to lose at least
half its readership. Whatever
the case may be, I think it's
time the Daily matures a little
and faces its responsibility to
serve the Stanford community
— the entire community.
This is written on behalf of
the many women and men who
were offended by the
stereotypical and downright
tacky advertisment for Thomas
Temporaries that appeared on
page 5 of the Daily for Oct. 2.
The piece I refer to was a photo
of a young woman, attired in a
well-built bikini, captioned
"But Can She Type?"
Please, folks, isn't that kind
of attitude a bit out of fashion? It
was amusing to read that slo
gan when it was emblazoned
on a poster of former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir that
appeared a few years ago, be
cause that poster ridiculed the
stereotype: here was a woman
of accomplishment, a woman
who wielded great political
power, a woman who even the
"MCPs" would agree did not
need to know how to type in
order to be useful. The tone of
that poster was not the tone of
the Thomas Temporaries ad,
nor was that the ad's implica
tion.
To make the situation a little
more clear, to demonstrate
exactly why the ad was disturb
ing, let's change the photo and
the caption. Let's make the
photo one of a black person,
and change the caption to "But
Will You Have to Set Him
Free?" It is now obvious what
was wrong with the ad as it ap
peared: it exploited the "old
boy" sentiment about a minor
ity group's "proper" function

in the working world. The ad as
altered in this example would
be more shocking, more likely
to rouse an angry response,
even more likely to be rejected
by the advertising department
of the Daily as unsuitable for
print, but it would not be more
insulting than the ad that was
accepted for Monday's Daily.
I conclude by urging the
Stanford Daily's staff to be
more considerate and more
tactful in future assembling of
its product, and by expressing
a wish that the Thomas Tem
poraries ad lost more custom
ers than it gained. By the way,
I'd like you to know that, de
spite the fact that I am a wo
man, I typed this without the
aid of a bikini — most people
who can type don't wear them.
Surprise!

Editor's Note: When the ad
Reingold refers to was shown
to me for approval, I judged all
three Thomas Temporaries ad
vertisements at once. The sec
ond ad showed a bare-chested
male and the third ad pictured
Richard Nixon. Under the male
ad was: "But can he type?" and
under the Nixon ad was: "Hav
ing trouble finding a job?" Mis
takingly all three ads were
judged together, and therefore
were not seen as perpetuating
a stereotype, but instead came
across in a humorous vein.
However, readers only see
one of those advertisements a
day, and in hindsight, the Daily
should have seriously consi
dered not running the ad in
question.
Thomas Temporaries has
also been made aware of many
readers' concerns regarding
this ad, and I doubt they will try
placing a similar advertisement
again.
