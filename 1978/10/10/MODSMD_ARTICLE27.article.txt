## Jazz/ted gioia 3 masters of tenor sax 
### 
Sonny Rollins
Don't Stop the Carnival
Milestone
I mentioned in a column last
year that Sonny Rollins seemed
on the verge of an important
musical breakthrough. Since
that time my words have rung
true with even more forceful
ness than I would have thought
possible.
At 48, Rollins is having what
is perhaps his best year in over
a decade. The Milestone jazz
tour (in which he played with
McCoy Tyner and Ron Carter)
was the jazz event of the sum
mer. This, combined with Rol
lin's White House appearance
(which was an important jazz
event of a different type), has
put him back at the forefront of
the modern tenor players.
Unfortunately, Sonny's
latest album does not do full
justice to his abilities. Let me
be clear about it â€” Rollins'
playing on the album is fantas
tic. The problem lies with the
supporting musicians and the
choice of material.
Solos
Sonny's solos ripple with
power. His long solo introduc
tion to "Autumn Nocturne" is
one of the highlights of his re
cording career. Vet when the
other musicians take their
turns, the music invariably
lags.
One might question the in
clusion of Donald Byrd on this
date. Byrd's popularity, chiefly
through his work with the
Blackbyrds, makes him a hot
commercial property; still it is
hard to deny that his trumpet
playing has deteriorated over
the years. I recall with fond
ness some of Byrd's earlier
work with the Blue Note label,
and it is hard to see that the
same musician is playing on
this disc.
Mix-ups
There are mix-ups with solos
and a handful of bad notes
which clog up the album when
Sonny isn't taking charge. Even
the drumming, provided by
Tony Williams, falls short of its
potential. Williams at times
plays the drums as well as any
one; when he started playing
with Miles Davis at 17 he was
the young sensation of the jazz
world. Today, some 10 years la
ter, Williams tempers occa

sional flashes of brilliance with
frequent moments of lethargy.
He never really coheres here,
certainly not as much as he did
on the recent McCoy Tyner
supertrios album.
In the midst of these prob
lems, Rollins never falters; his
playing is driving and intense.
The'great tenor sax players of
jazz generally spend the last
decades of their lives recreat
ing and imitating past succes
ses. Rollins has managed to
forge ahead into new grounds
and even surpass his past per
formances.

Lew Tabackin
Dual Nature
Inner City Records
Lew Tabackin is doubtless
best known for his work with
the Akiyoshi-Tabackin big
band. As a stalwart member
and co-leader of that group he
has helped to push it into the
limelight as one of the
foremost new groups to re
cently appear.
Tabackin, for me, remains a
much more engaging small
group player. His solos rebel
against being relegated to brief
flurries between ensembles
and other solos. When given
time to stretch out, Tabackin is
at his best. This is precisely the
situation Dual Nature creates.
On tenor sax and flute,
Tabackin glides his way
through a half-dozen stan
dards and originals. His playing
displays the ability to adapt to
any styling; he is one of the few
tenor players who have assimi
lated both Coltrane and Col
eman Hawkins, with a host of
others besides. Other players
who have attempted this same
type of assimilation often turn
every solo into a disjointed his
tory of jazz. Tabackin's playing
is more integrated; the influ
ences are there, but still it's
Tabackin's own style.
Relaxation
This album has a host of
beautiful moments to recom
mend it, but by far the best is
Tabackin's rendition of "My
Ideal." He approaches this
standard with an amazing rela
xation which allows the music
to flow rather than pulsate.
"My Ideal" features a distilled
type of melody which becomes
more powerful the more lightly
the performer lays it on.

Tabackin senses this in his ver
sion.
Tabatkin is assisted by an ex
cellent group of backup musi
cians. Shelly Manne, the pe
rennial percussionist/
celebrity, is on drums, and Bob
Daugherty is the bassist.
The excellent, but little known
San Franciscan, Don Friedman,
plays piano.
Scott Hamilton
Scott Hamilton
Concord Records
Scott Hamilton has been cal
led "one of the most unusual
musicians to appear in recent
years." It should be added,
however, that he is also one of
the most courageous. In an age
where novelty is regarded as
the most important artistic
quality, Hamilton is only 23, yet
there are times on his new al
bum, entitled Scott Hamilton,
2, where he sounds frighten
ingly like Lester Young or Ben
Webster. The Swing Era, an age
which most young jazz fans
either ignore or would like to
forget, sounds amazingly alive
on this new album.
Refreshing
There are those who might
criticize this album as being
camp or out-dated. It had the
exact opposite effect on me.
Seldom have I heard an album
so refreshing as this one. The
solos are excellent, the ac
companiment is above all
tasteful, the recording superb.
Hamilton's main strength is
his tone. Modern tenor players
tend to over-emphasize the
harsh, jagged side of their in
strument. Hamilton's tone is
breathy and supple; he dis
plays a smoothness which is
equally impressive on slow and
fast numbers. It is difficult to
estimage his technique, be
cause he seems so uncon
cerned with it. He never
reaches for the very fast
phrase, but contents himself
with creating tension in other
ways.
Pretty
Lester Young, the great
saxophonist of the '40s, had
one word which he would con
tinually use to describe a solo
orsong that pleased him. "That
was really pretty," Lester would
say, and in his mind "pretti
ness" was not something to be
avoided (as so many jazzmen
seem to think); instead it was
what music, for Prez, was all
about.
Pretty is an apt word to de
scribe this album. Hamilton
may be an anomaly, but he is a
welcome one. It would be a
real thrill to see Hamilton in a
jam session context, setting his
music against that of his more
hectic contemporaries.
