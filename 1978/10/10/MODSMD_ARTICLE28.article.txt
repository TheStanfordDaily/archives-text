## Barry's big break 
### 
A program note from In Re
vue:
"BARRY KORON (Producer,
Director, Co-Author, Musical
Director, Keyboards, have you
had enough?) decided upon a
life in the theater as a result of
being dropped on his head at
an early age. . . His first San
Francisco production, An Even
ing at Widow Begbick's, has
just been accepted for produc
tion by the Arena Stage Theatre
in Washington, D.C. next
year. . . He'd rather not talk
about his other (shows)... He
seems to enjoy acting like a
complete idiot in public, so
don't take him out to lunch."
In the beginning, Barry
Koron had a typical actor's life.
He was born in New York ("So I
love the theater and I saw a lot
of it"); won the lead in his first
audition (a junior high produc
tion of Harvey); and went to
school for two drama degrees.
Then, he realized his big mis
take.
"I wasted six years getting
those degrees. College fills
you with bullshit. Acting can't
be taught. Acting teachers
didn't help one iota. You do
what you know how to do.
There's technical stuff I didn't
know. . . But I could have
picked that up.
"All those at Stanford, who
want to get into the theater,
should forget (the degree) and
go out into the real world."
Widow Begbick's
For Koron, that meant jump
ing into producing and direct
ing his own musicals. His first
show, Widow Begbick's, ran
on a $1500 budget in a room at
the Spaghetti Factory.
"We had no idea it would last
as long as it did —14 months —

we were operating out of a
room. Doing it from scratch.
Spending nothing."
Koron's next venture, A Mar
velous Party, took $15,000 to
stage. The money came from
friends, acquaintances and
"people who knew my name
from the other stuff. It gets
easier with each successive
show.
"It's weird. (Backing a play)
is the world's lousiest invest
ment. But, there are alot of
gamblers. If you succeed, like
Fiddler on the Roof . . . that
show paid off 1500 percent,
which is a helluva lot of
money."
Koron's current In Revue
was born under conditions un
comfortably reminiscent of a
Garland-Rooney "Let's put on

a show" script.
"Four of us had the concept
and the material. We held
seven backers auditions. Then,
we got the money for cos
tumes, lights, sets — and we
rented the theater."
Unlike Judy and Mickey, it
hasn't been from nowhere to
big time in one easy step.
"Getting the show together
isn't difficult. If you've got the
bucks, you can do anything.
You can rent the Orpheum for
a night."
The test is riding it out, wait
ing for the corner to turn — up
or down.
Obscene but true
"San Francisco is a lackadais
ical theater town. It takes six
months for a show to establish
itself here. If you don't have
the money to last that long,
you're out of luck. It's
obscene, but true."
He pointed to the Elocution
of Benjamin Franklin, which
has won rave reviews, but has
"already posted final notices,
because no one will come.
That just proves it isn't the cri
tics that make a show here.
"People have to get up and
say, 'Well, I'm not going to sit
on my ass tonight — or roll a
joint —" They have to get up
the money ("I admit, movies
are cheaper") and get out to
the theaters ("And who wants
to go to North Beach?")
A big problem, Koron says, is
the kind of people who see
plays. They're generally well
off, older and of polyester
mentality.
"That's why garbage like Pal
loey can play to big houses. It's
a nauseous production with
big names. But people like that
flashy-kind of production."
Koron the director prefers
shows, which rely more on
content and concept. "Marvel
ous Party tried to recreate
exactly the kind of big affair
they had back then. We tried to
recreate note for note the way

Gershwin played the piano or
the way the Astaires danced.
"In Revue (a tribute to Irving
Berlin) has a concept behind
every song. We did nothing the
way it was originally done."
Artistic joy aside, Koron also
likes directing because he can
"keep the assholes out of my
show. A lot of people — not all
but a lot — in the theater are
rude and obnoxious. They get
up there and yell, 'Look ma,
look at me. The hell with you!" I
don't invite very many actors to
my home ... as Zero Mostel
says in The Producers, . . .
'Have you ever eaten with
one?'
Headaches
"There are so many
headaches, anyway, why do
things with people you can't
stand?"
Running the show also gives
Koron the chance to use music
he likes. "I love all kinds of
stuff, but Gershwin, Porter,
Berlin — they still say a lot and
people ignore them now,
which is a shame, because
they're still beautiful."
Berlin, for example, is "the
grandmaster of American
song. Just as modern today as
in 1911. His lyrics are clever.
You hum his music. He was the
only songwriter who straddled
both the theater and popular
music."
A composer himself, Koron
is working on a musical adapta
tion of Buchner's Leonce and
Lena, which will be "bright,
witty, funny and clever."
With such obvious misgiv
ings about the project, Koron
seems to be concentrating
more on his producing and di
recting.
Maybe, he's trying to make
up for lost time.
Because, if he could do it
again, he would skip college
and "get out there. You'll
never get anywhere the other
way. Learn by doing — and do
it yourself."
