## Berlin's birthday bash 
### 
In Revue is bright and good-natured.
Which is justfine, because Irving Berlin is that
kind of songwriter. And Revue, which plays at
the Chi Chi, is a 90th birthday celebration for
that master of American music.
Barry Koron and Don Stitt have built a three
person revue around Berlin's standards and
some of his not-so-familiar works, claiming a
concept behind each number, with nothing
done like its original.
This comes off good and bad (for those who
go to these things out of pure nostalgia) but for
most of us, who weren't around for the real
thing, it's a fun evening of theater.
Maybe this sounds lukewarm. It's just that
Revue and Berlin don't need glossy adjectives.
The show is understated, partly because of its
intimate stage and staging and partly because of
its subject.
Berlin can be sentimental or corny — funny or
wistful — but he's always simple and un

abashed. Leave the nasty bite to Lorenz Hart,
daring innovation to Sondheim — Berlin gives
you what he called "words that make sense and
notes that make music."
His energetic economy runs through In Re
vue. From Michael Kroschel's art deco black
sunburst set to the tight, zippy staging — and
especially to a cast that never lets up. Peggy
Nisbet plays the Girl, torn between Suave Frank
Fontana and Eager Ronald Mann. They smile a
little too much and get a little too hammy but
they jump with ease from Yiddish Schtick to
Tender Ballad to vaudeville turns with a few
simple props.
They are matched in energy by the two
person band, which must use something illicit
to keep its frenzied pace.
In Revue runs at the Chi Chi Theatre Club, 440
Broadway, San Francisco. Student discounts are
available.
