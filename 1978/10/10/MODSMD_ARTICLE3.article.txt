# ASSU Senate needs candidates
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
The Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP) withdrew its slate of
six nominees from the ASSU Senate
election race yesterday, leaving only
seven graduate students running for
the 10 regular and 10 alternate
graduate senate positions.
Four graduates and two under
graduates withdrew.
Since the action left fewer
graduates running than the number
of regular graduate seats, ASSU Elec
tion Commissioner Will Nixon ex
tended the deadline for graduate
petitions to 5 p.m. today.
However, Nixon said, regardless
of the response to the extension, the
elections will take place Thursday
and Friday as scheduled.
'Would hurt'
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Andrew Goldenkrantz said
that "it would hurt more people to
postpone the elections than to wait a
while and try to generate more in
terest in them."
Goldenkrantz also said that what
he called the restrictive provisions of
the ASSU Constitution "aren't giving
us much help," since they include no
guidelines for running an election
with too few candidates.
The COP was uncertain about the
constitutional implications of a po
tentially unfilled senate.
The senate must provide equal
representation for graduate and un
dergraduate students, but the ASSU
Constitution also specifies the
number of representatives from each

division, COP member Regina Petty
said.
However, COP members did not
rule out the possibility that another
election might be held later to fill
empty senate seats if the extension
does not bring enough candidates.
Undergrads
In the undergraduate race, 26
senatorial candidates are contending
for 10 regularand 10 alternate posts,
down from a total of 43 candidates
last year.
Nixon said, "The deterioration of
the senate's image that led to CRAP
may also be connected to the fact
that so few people want to run."
In addition fewer women are run
ning for senate this year.
In last year's election, six
senators-elect were disqualified and
17 others cited for "improper elec
tion practices."
Nixon said there is "no evidence of
this type of trouble" this year. He
also said that candidates have been
warned about activities that could
lead to disqualification.
In discussing the six CRAP slate
members' decision to withdraw from
the senate race, CRAP member Doug
Bandow said that the group hopes to
show "how few serious candidates
really are left."
CRAP stand
According to Bandow, CRAP slate
members withdrew because of nega
tive feedback from the student body.
Students were uncertain of CRAP's
actual stand, because it was attempt
ing to abolish the senate and run for

it at the same time, Bandow said.
Also on the ballot will be four can
didates running for the Student
Conduct Legislative Council and a $1
fee assessment for KZSU. The SCLC
is a legislative body empowered to
alter the Honor Code and other por
tions of the legislative and judicial
charter.
Polling places for this week's elec
tion will be set up at the post office,
at the French/Italian corner of the
Quad, in the foyer of Meyer Library,
between the Terman and Storke
buildings, at the Medical Center and
at the Graduate School of Business.
Polling place hours will be an
nounced later this week.
