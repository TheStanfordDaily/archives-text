## Farrah dismal in lousy murder movie 
### 
It comes as no surprise that
Somebody Killed Her Husband
is a lousy movie; one might
have guessed that just from
glancing at the diarrhetic
length of the title. What is sur
prising, however, is how con
sistently the makers of this film
blow whatever chances they
might have had to turn SKHH
into something which, if not a
great movie, might at least
have been an interesting one.
Which came first: Some
body Killed Her Husband's
hackneyed script or the casting
of the high priestess of utter
banality, Farrah Fawcett-
Majors? Just one would proba
bly have been enough to create
a bad movie; it is a tribute to
the genius of whoever signed
the checks for this film that bad
plot was wedded to bad actress
to create an almost fail-safe
disaster.
Inept
Despite inept handling,
SKHH has all the ingredients
for a nice bit of American
Gothic. In skeleton outline, it's
really not such a bad idea:
when a woman and her lover of
two days discover her husband
murdered in the kitchen, they
call upon the services of the
Frigidaire company (what
could be more American?) to

store the corpse until they dis
cover the culprit.
But the movie reneges on
any promise it makes by asking
its audience to accept this
grisly example of home can
ning instead of satirizing it as
Hitchcock would have done.
SKHH ignores the possibility
that people who hide a dead
man to protect themselves
might share at least a little of
the guilt with the man's mur
derer. Instead of a statement
about how desperately people
try to hang on to their visions of
normalcy, in Somebody Killed
Her Husband we get a denial
that any problem exists.
Added to the logistics prob
lem of the plot, the movie faces
the problem of Fawcett-Majors
herself. Her performance ver
ges on self-parody; it's as if
she's drawing her characteriza
tion from all those Wella-
Balsam commercials instead of
from life. The movie inadver
tently strips away much of her
glamour; in one excruciating
close-up we can see clearly that
several of those famous teeth
are tinged with yellow. And
without the larger-than-life al
lure that once made her appe
aling, the actress seems artifi
cial and oddly cold.
Not too long ago, Farrah's

co-star Jeff Bridges found him
self playing at a disadvantage
against Hollywood's tallest,
darkest leading man: King
Kong. Instead of a giant mon
key, this time he's saddled with
some of the worst lines in the
script: "I don't have time for
lust — I don't even have time
for lunch" is one of the better
ones. Bridges is also expected
to take Farrah seriously, which
must have been a good deal
harder than emoting against a
man in an ape suit. Bridges, a
capable actor, is adrift in a
movie whose crassness is re
vealed by the way his name is
treated in the credits and in the
film's advertising: it comes
after Farrah's but is still clearly
on top.
Ship of fools
Lamont Johnson was direc
tor of this sinking ship of fools;
he goes down with it with ap
parent glee. He ruins any sus
pense the film might have had
through mishandling — when
Bridges and Fawcett-Majors
discover her husband's
blood-oozing corpse the audi
ence has expected it for so long
that the reaction consists of
equal parts of repulsion and
boredom. It is clear that Hitch
cock has no need to worry.
Even murder — and there

must be half a dozen killings in
Somebody Killed Her Husband
— becomes bland when it is
pablumized by a bad script and
inept direction. Somebody Kil

led Her Husband, failing at
American Gothic, opts instead
to be like American white
bread — it has all the whole
some appeal of wet dough.
