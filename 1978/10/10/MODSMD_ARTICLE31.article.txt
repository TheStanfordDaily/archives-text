### 
Pianist Adolf Bailer and
singer Edith Zitelli will present
a two-concert series of
Schubert lieder on Monday,
Oct. 16, and Wednesday, Oct.

benefit for their friend, singer
Laura Barton, who was
paralyzed in an automobile ac
cident on June 22.
Barton had been active in
this community, previously
having held the position of
music coordinator for Palo Alto.
She had sung with the Second
Church of Christ Scientist, the
New Chamber Musicians, and
Triad Productions, and had re
cently become the choir direc
tor at Trinity Lutheran Church.
Her friends, out of apprecia
tion, admiration and support
of the courage and spirit she
has shown throughout her
hospitalization, will perform
Schubert's "Die Schone Mulle
rin" on Oct. 16, and his
"Schwannengesang" on Oct.
25. The series will be held at the
Palo Alto Cultural Center.
Zitelli, a graduate of Julliard,
has concertized with Adolf Bai
ler for the past 20 years, mostly
here in the Bay Area. Prof. Bai
ler is well-known for his con
certs with the Alma Trio, and

also as a teacher here and at the
San Francisco Conservatory of
Music. They had performed
the Schubert lieder earlier this
year (the 150 th since
Schubert's death) and their
choice of these songs for dedi
cation to their friend was partly
a result of the enthusiastic re
ponse to their first series.
Both concerts are at 8 p.m.,
and a $4 donation will be ap
preciated.
