Senate votes to cut income taxes
Washington — The Senate voted yesterday to cut per
sonal income taxes by $164 billion between 1980 and
1983 if the growth of federal spending is held within set
limits.
The tax cut for 1982 would be allowed only if the
budget is balanced in that year.
The far-reaching proposal was approved 65-20 as an
amendment to the $30 billion tax-cut bill being consi
dered by the Senate for 1979. If the tax cuts became
effective, they would be distributed among various in
come levels in about the same proportion as those in the
1979 reductions.
This would mean an additional tax cut during the four
years averaging $576 for a four-member family with in
come between $20,000 and $30,000.
In general, spending in one year could not exceed the
previous year's total by more than one percent, plus
whatever was needed to offset inflation.
lOC approves L.A. Olympic bid
Lausanne, Switzerland — The International Olympic
Committee gave its final approval yesterday, by an
overwhelming 74-3 margin, to Los Angeles to stage the
1984 Summer Games.

also drew eight abstentions, approved a decision by the
executive board in August which had recommended
acceptance of Los Angeles' plan to hold and finance the
Games.
The granting of the Games to Los Angeles ended
months of talks between officials of the city, the lOC and
the United States Olympic Committee over the drafting
of a contract acceptable to all parties.
Two contracts to be signed by the parties are aimed at
preventing any demands on the taxpayers of Los
Angeles. Under the current plan, financial responsibility
is delegated to the USOC and an independent organiz
ing committee.
