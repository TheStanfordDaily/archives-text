# Construction delayed on Albers Wall project

### LIZ SALAIZ 
Construction problems are caus
ing more delays in progress on Al
bers Wall, the free-standing
sculpture being built between the
Physics Tank and the Quad.
The basic problem is the wall's
complicated design, which requires
precision work and select materials,
according to Roger Cairns, senior
planner of facilities and properties.
The steel and brick, needed by Al
bers' design, have not received final
approval from Robert Mittelstadt, a
former architecture professor here,
who is supervising building mate
rials.
Also, Bruce Beasley, the Oakland
sculptor hired to produce the wall's
stainless steel graphics, can't start
work until late November.
The cost of the wall is estimated at
$100,000, with private organizations
and individuals interested in Albers'
work, providing the funds.
Contractor Delcon Associates, of
Hayward, is uncertain whether de
lays will affect the final cost.
In 1971, a collector approached
Josef Albers about purchasing his
first design for a free-standing relief.

But Albers intended the sculpture to
be part of a community, rather than
for an individual.
The collector asked Albers if he
would consider giving it to a West
Coast university. The artist agreed so
the collector contacted Art Prof. Al
bert Elsen, who persuaded Albers to
donate his design to the University.
Controversy broke out last year
over the sculpture's location. Albers
had requested that the site be prom
inent, dignified and safe.
Wall protests
Some, however, regarded the wall
as an obstacle, rather than an
artwork. One of the original site
suggestions, Canfield Mall, was
strongly opposed by Law School. A
full-scale model of the wall, built on
the mall, was torn down, in what
Elsen called "a commentary on those
reacting against it."
The decision to build the sculpture
in front of the Physics Tank was made
by a group of impartial art experts.
One side of Albers Wall will be
white brick, interspersed with dark
steel tubing. The other side will be
panels of black African granite, deco
rated with stainless steel graphics.
