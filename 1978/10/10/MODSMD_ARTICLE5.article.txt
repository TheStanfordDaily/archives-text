# Trustees may delegate stock votes

### MIKE CHARLSON 
A special Board of Trustees' sub
committee would be empowered to
vote controversial shareholder pro
xies without full board approval,
under a proposal trustees will con
sider today.
Under a proposal put before the
Committee on Investments yester
day, the procedure for receiving re
commendations from the University
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) would be altered to
allow a select committee of trustees
to vote University proxies "with re
spect to (CIR) proposals," but with

out full board approval.
The policy would only apply when
proxy-voting timetables did not
allow full board consideration, ac
cording to Robert Hamrdla, assistant
to the president for trustee affairs.
In the past, the ad hoc Subcommit
tee on Investment Responsibility
(SIR), has had its deliberations and
recommendations subjected to full
board scrutiny.
Phone relay
Last spring, when proxies needed
consideration between board meet
ings, the SIR would confer by con
ference phone, and the committee's

recommendations would be relayed
to the full board by mailgram.
Trustees could call in protests to
Board President Peter Bing. Based on
the feelings of the entire board, Bing
would decide how to vote the proxy.
Under the new plan, SIR recom
mendations would become the Uni
versity vote, and full board review of
the issue would be retrospective.
Last year, several controversial
proxy issues, dealing with corporate
involvement in South Africa, were
before both the CIR and SIR.
Neither students nor faculty will
serve on the ad hoc committee, ac
cording to Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
"The feeling is that student and fa
culty opinion on the issues is
adequately represented on the CIR,"
Rosenzweig said.

This is as far as the Albers Wall is going to get for at least a few weeks. The
controversial project's sculptor won't be available until late November.
