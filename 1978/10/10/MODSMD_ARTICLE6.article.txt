## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Andy Geiger, athletic director at
the University of Pennsylvania for the
last three years, was named yester
day to succeed Joe Ruetz as Univer
sity athletic director.
Geiger assumes department reins
)an. 1, when Ruetz, who announced
last spring his intention to retire
early, will step down.
"Geiger made a terrific impression
on the search committee when he
was out here," President Richard
Lyman said. "Extensive checking of
his references confirmed that impre
ssion. He had the unanimous sup
port of the search committee."
"We scoured the country looking
for the right man and found him at
the University of Pennsylvania," said
Frank Lodato, chairman of the 17-
member search committee, which
spent four montis looking for a di
rector.
'Brilliant'
"In my judgment, Andy Geiger is a
brilliant match with Stanford in terms
of principles and values," said Joel
Smith, vice president of develop
ment and a member of the search
committee. "He has the personal at
tributes which make him effective
with a variety of constituents — stu
dents, faculty, alumni and coaches."
"I consider Stanford the finest op
portunity in my profession," Geiger
said. "It's a thrill to be at a university
that has Stanford's prestige, and to

be part of the athletic excellence of
the Pacific-10 Conference."
Only 39, Geiger is a 1961 graduate
of Syracuse. He spent from 1964 to
1970 as the assistant athletic director
there, before serving one year in an
administrative post in the Eastern
Athletic Conference. He served as
athletic director of Brown for four
years, before going to Penn.
Moving force
At Penn he gained national recog
nition for his leadership in the
NCAA. At last year's NCAA conven
tion, Geiger was the moving force

behind the Ivy League Amendment
— a proposal which blocked the ef
fort of some collegiate football pow
ers to establish a national "super
conference."
Called "one of the next generation
of athletic director leaders" by Fred
Hargadon, dean of undergraduate
admissions here and a member of
the search committee, Geiger has a
broad range of interests. Among
other things, he is the disc jockey of a
three-hour radio show every Sunday
on which he plays big band music
from the '30s and '40s.

said. "It's a thrill to be at a university
that has Stanford's prestige, and to

be part of the athletic excellence of
the Pacific-10 Conference."
Only 39, Geiger is a 1961 graduate
of Syracuse. He spent from 1964 to
1970 as the assistant athletic director
there, before serving one year in an
administrative post in the Eastern
Athletic Conference. He served as
athletic director of Brown for four
years, before going to Penn.
Moving force
At Penn he gained national recog
nition for his leadership in the
NCAA. At last year's NCAA conven
tion, Geiger was the moving force

behind the Ivy League Amendment
— a proposal which blocked the ef
fort of some collegiate football pow
ers to establish a national "super
conference."
Called "one of the next generation
of athletic director leaders" by Fred
Hargadon, dean of undergraduate
admissions here and a member of
the search committee, Geiger has a
broad range of interests. Among
other things, he is the disc jockey of a
three-hour radio show every Sunday
on which he plays big band music
from the '30s and '40s.
