# ASSU Senate leader disagrees with CRAP

### VANCE MASON 
The Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP), senate reform and
the Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) were discussed by ASSU Se
nate Chairman Fred Grethel yester
day. His remarks will be broadcast
Thursday on KZSU's Campus Con
ference.
Grethel opposed the CRAP prop
osal to abolish the senate. He said
the system can work, if dedicated in
dividuals are elected. "The problem
with last year's senate was that the
average candidate had no idea how

much time is required/' he said.
"I spent at least half my time on the
senate last year and suffered academ
ically. The people that do work are
overworked, and the people that
don't, just don't care or don't know
what to do."
To remedy the situation, he has
prepared a senate orientation book
let. "It outlines their duties and re
views parliamentary procedure and
working together as a group," he
said.
Grethel added that a SCIRE-related
course, which gives senators units
for work on senate committees,
might attract better people and ease
some academic conflicts.
SOC role
Grethel disagreed with statements
that the cry for reform was motivated
by dissatisfaction with political
slates' domination of the senate.
Last year, 16 of 20 senators were
members of SOC.
"I don't think the slate damaged
the senate's reputation or triggered
the CRAP proposal," said Grethel, a
SOC member.
"The senate was in need of reform
before the SOC slate was elected and
we wallowed in a bad situation.
"There is no SOC slate for this
year's election, because SOC, which
was organized to give small minority
groups more political clout, decided
that the senate was not the best av
enue for their activities."
Grethel countered claims that the
senate concerns itself with world is
sues, such as the University's South
