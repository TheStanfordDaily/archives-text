# ASSU Senate leader disagrees with CRAP
## 
### VANCE MASON 
The Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP), senate reform and
the Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) were discussed by ASSU Se
nate Chairman Fred Grethel yester
day. His remarks will be broadcast
Thursday on KZSU's Campus Con
ference.
Grethel opposed the CRAP prop
osal to abolish the senate. He said
the system can work, if dedicated in
dividuals are elected. "The problem
with last year's senate was that the
average candidate had no idea how

much time is required/' he said.
"I spent at least half my time on the
senate last year and suffered academ
ically. The people that do work are
overworked, and the people that
don't, just don't care or don't know
what to do."
To remedy the situation, he has
prepared a senate orientation book
let. "It outlines their duties and re
views parliamentary procedure and
working together as a group," he
said.
Grethel added that a SCIRE-related
course, which gives senators units
for work on senate committees,
might attract better people and ease
some academic conflicts.
SOC role
Grethel disagreed with statements
that the cry for reform was motivated
by dissatisfaction with political
slates' domination of the senate.
Last year, 16 of 20 senators were
members of SOC.
"I don't think the slate damaged
the senate's reputation or triggered
the CRAP proposal," said Grethel, a
SOC member.
"The senate was in need of reform
before the SOC slate was elected and
we wallowed in a bad situation.
"There is no SOC slate for this
year's election, because SOC, which
was organized to give small minority
groups more political clout, decided
that the senate was not the best av
enue for their activities."
Grethel countered claims that the
senate concerns itself with world is
sues, such as the University's South
Africa investments, at the expense of
local ones such as residential educa
tion and improvingTresidderUnion.
"The senate is a forum for expres
sion of student views. World issues
do affect us because we are studying
them or thinking of them.
"Even though the senate might not
be able to do anything about an is
sue, the senate is obligated to debate
and be a force for education," he
said.
Divestment
"As for South Africa, the divest
ment issue directly affects the se
nate," Crethel said, "because the

senate has $350,000 in a University
investment fund called Merge Pool
B. Since we have no vote as to how
the University invests that money for
us, our only recourse is to bring it up
in the senate and hope that they will
listen.
"We do have the option of pulling
our money out of the merge pool and
investing it ourselves," he added.
"The ASSU financial manager has
prepared a report on the options this
summer. A question as to what ac
tion the senate should take will be on
the fall election ballot."
What if the reforms and good in
tentions of this year's senators result
in a senate no better or worse than

last year's?
"One thing we must realize is that
the senate is not going to
metamorphase overnight into a
wonderful body," Crethel said.
"The changes that come are going
to be slow ones. If we don't realize
this, people are going to get burned
out. Be realistic about it; the senate is
bound by the Constitution and
bylaws and doesn't have much room
to maneuver."
He urged students to "drop this
'us' and 'them' attitude about the se
nate. Your best friend is the senate,
and if you want it changed it's going
to take some effort on your part in
getting involved."

SOC member.
"The senate was in need of reform
before the SOC slate was elected and
we wallowed in a bad situation.
"There is no SOC slate for this
year's election, because SOC, which
was organized to give small minority
groups more political clout, decided
that the senate was not the best av
enue for their activities."
Grethel countered claims that the
senate concerns itself with world is
sues, such as the University's South
Africa investments, at the expense of
local ones such as residential educa
tion and improvingTresidderUnion.
"The senate is a forum for expres
sion of student views. World issues
do affect us because we are studying
them or thinking of them.
"Even though the senate might not
be able to do anything about an is
sue, the senate is obligated to debate
and be a force for education," he
said.
Divestment
"As for South Africa, the divest
ment issue directly affects the se
nate," Crethel said, "because the

senate has $350,000 in a University
investment fund called Merge Pool
B. Since we have no vote as to how
the University invests that money for
us, our only recourse is to bring it up
in the senate and hope that they will
listen.
"We do have the option of pulling
our money out of the merge pool and
investing it ourselves," he added.
"The ASSU financial manager has
prepared a report on the options this
summer. A question as to what ac
tion the senate should take will be on
the fall election ballot."
What if the reforms and good in
tentions of this year's senators result
in a senate no better or worse than

last year's?
"One thing we must realize is that
the senate is not going to
metamorphase overnight into a
wonderful body," Crethel said.
"The changes that come are going
to be slow ones. If we don't realize
this, people are going to get burned
out. Be realistic about it; the senate is
bound by the Constitution and
bylaws and doesn't have much room
to maneuver."
He urged students to "drop this
'us' and 'them' attitude about the se
nate. Your best friend is the senate,
and if you want it changed it's going
to take some effort on your part in
getting involved."
The Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP), senate reform and
the Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) were discussed by ASSU Se
nate Chairman Fred Grethel yester
day. His remarks will be broadcast
Thursday on KZSU's Campus Con
ference.
Grethel opposed the CRAP prop
osal to abolish the senate. He said
the system can work, if dedicated in
dividuals are elected. "The problem
with last year's senate was that the
average candidate had no idea how

much time is required/' he said.
"I spent at least half my time on the
senate last year and suffered academ
ically. The people that do work are
overworked, and the people that
don't, just don't care or don't know
what to do."
To remedy the situation, he has
prepared a senate orientation book
let. "It outlines their duties and re
views parliamentary procedure and
working together as a group," he
said.
Grethel added that a SCIRE-related
course, which gives senators units
for work on senate committees,
might attract better people and ease
some academic conflicts.
SOC role
Grethel disagreed with statements
that the cry for reform was motivated
by dissatisfaction with political
slates' domination of the senate.
Last year, 16 of 20 senators were
members of SOC.
"I don't think the slate damaged
the senate's reputation or triggered
the CRAP proposal," said Grethel, a
SOC member.
