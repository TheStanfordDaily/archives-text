thoroughfare from Santa Cruz Av
enue to El Camino Real. Design en
gineers say the road expansion
would relieve heavy traffic now
plaguing the area and would provide
easier access to Palo Alto.
The University has agreed to pay
for an extension of Campus Drive,

from the Medical Center to
Junipero-Serra Boulevard, if the pro
ject is approved. The cost is expected
to be about $520,000, said Steve
Schmidt, associate planner in
facilities.
Schmidt also said $40,000 must be
spent to move three golf course
holes, which would be affected by
the Sand Hill Project.
"The plan seems like a good idea,"
Schmidt said. "Studies show the
road expansion will reduce conges
tion and increase bicycle safety."
Defeat expected
However, the city council is ex
pected to defeat the proposal. Be
cause of an alleged conflict of in
terest, three of the nine council
members will not be voting. Two of
the remaining six have said they are
opposed to the project. The remain
ing four votes will not be enough.
