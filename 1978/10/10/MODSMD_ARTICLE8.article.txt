# Sand Hill Rd. project not expected to pass
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Nearly $600,000 will be spent by
the University for road and golf
course renovations if the Palo Alto
City Council votes in favor of the
"Sand Hill Expressway" tonight, but
the council is expected to defeat the
proposal.
Plans call for transforming Sand
Hill Road into a four-lane

thoroughfare from Santa Cruz Av
enue to El Camino Real. Design en
gineers say the road expansion
would relieve heavy traffic now
plaguing the area and would provide
easier access to Palo Alto.
The University has agreed to pay
for an extension of Campus Drive,

from the Medical Center to
Junipero-Serra Boulevard, if the pro
ject is approved. The cost is expected
to be about $520,000, said Steve
Schmidt, associate planner in
facilities.
Schmidt also said $40,000 must be
spent to move three golf course
holes, which would be affected by
the Sand Hill Project.
"The plan seems like a good idea,"
Schmidt said. "Studies show the
road expansion will reduce conges
tion and increase bicycle safety."
Defeat expected
However, the city council is ex
pected to defeat the proposal. Be
cause of an alleged conflict of in
terest, three of the nine council
members will not be voting. Two of
the remaining six have said they are
opposed to the project. The remain
ing four votes will not be enough.
because it would take five votes to
create an assessment district to fi
nance the project.
Affirmative votes are expected to
come from Councilmembers Alan
Henderson, Fred Eyerly, Roy Clay
and Gary Fazzino.
Councilmember Frances Brenner
has consistently opposed the road
expansion, while Ellen Fletcher said
Friday she won't back the project.
Mayor Scott Carey, whose land will
be affected by the road expansion,
and University employees Anne
Witherspoon and Byron Sherwill not
be voting.
Vet the final decision may still be
made by the Palo Alto citizens them
selves if the project does fail to re
ceive council approval. Vice Mayor
Henderson told a Palo Alto Times re
porter Friday he will propose that the
matter be placed on next May's
council election ballot.
Hot issue
Controversy has raged over the
plan because groups in Palo Alto do
not believe the road expansion will
relieve traffic.
The Peninsula Conservation
Center has said the project will "de
crease the quality of life" and in
crease vehicular traffic on Sand Hill
Road by 48.4 percent by 1990.
Controversy reached a peak when
a Palo Alto engineer filed suit against
the city council, after it approved the

project earlier in the year. Joseph
Carleton alleged the environmental
impact reports were defective and
charged Carey, Witherspoon and
Sher with conflict of interest.
Carleton agreed to drop the suit if
the expansion plan were to come up
again before the council.
The engineer wants to see changes
in the signal system at the Sand Hill
Road-Santa Cruz Avenue intersec
tion, where he claims the real
bottleneck exists.
Carleton's strategies to change the
city council's earlier vote of approval
for the road expansion may prove to
have been well planned. Unless the

city votes to override the council's
expected decision next May, the
"Sand Hill Expressway" may never
appear.
Then again, it takes a long time to
unwind all the red tape surrounding
proposed changes on a road.
Perhaps the city council will discuss
signal changes in the near future.
But until plans are designed, pub
lic hearings scheduled and a vote oc
curs on a revamped project, the
workers in the Palo Alto area, who
use the Sand Hill Road every night at
5, will have to sit patiently in their
cars and curse the bumper-to
bumper traffic.

selves if the project does fail to re
ceive council approval. Vice Mayor
Henderson told a Palo Alto Times re
porter Friday he will propose that the
matter be placed on next May's
council election ballot.
Hot issue
Controversy has raged over the
plan because groups in Palo Alto do
not believe the road expansion will
relieve traffic.
The Peninsula Conservation
Center has said the project will "de
crease the quality of life" and in
crease vehicular traffic on Sand Hill
Road by 48.4 percent by 1990.
Controversy reached a peak when
a Palo Alto engineer filed suit against
the city council, after it approved the

project earlier in the year. Joseph
Carleton alleged the environmental
impact reports were defective and
charged Carey, Witherspoon and
Sher with conflict of interest.
Carleton agreed to drop the suit if
the expansion plan were to come up
again before the council.
The engineer wants to see changes
in the signal system at the Sand Hill
Road-Santa Cruz Avenue intersec
tion, where he claims the real
bottleneck exists.
Carleton's strategies to change the
city council's earlier vote of approval
for the road expansion may prove to
have been well planned. Unless the

city votes to override the council's
expected decision next May, the
"Sand Hill Expressway" may never
appear.
Then again, it takes a long time to
unwind all the red tape surrounding
proposed changes on a road.
Perhaps the city council will discuss
signal changes in the near future.
But until plans are designed, pub
lic hearings scheduled and a vote oc
curs on a revamped project, the
workers in the Palo Alto area, who
use the Sand Hill Road every night at
5, will have to sit patiently in their
cars and curse the bumper-to
bumper traffic.
Nearly $600,000 will be spent by
the University for road and golf
course renovations if the Palo Alto
City Council votes in favor of the
"Sand Hill Expressway" tonight, but
the council is expected to defeat the
proposal.
