# Governor's sister extols adaptable administration

### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
"Are you interested in Toga-parties
and Animal House or in maintaining
a high quality of life?" Kathleen
Brown Rice, sister of Gov. Jerry
Brown, asked about 200 students in
White Plaza yesterday.
Rice, a 1969 graduate of the Uni
versity, said her brother asked her to
come here to "test the waters" to
find out if students care about gov
ernment and if so, what their major
concerns are.
In an interview before her noon
speech yesterday, Rice said her
brother may still visit the campus be
fore election day Nov. 7.
"I don't know what his schedule
is," she said. "I know he's been hit
ting colleges throughout California
for a registration drive, but I don't
know if he plans to stop by Stanford
or not."
Rice said Brown is "not overly con
fident" of winning the upcoming
election.
"No one is presuming an easy vic
tory," she said. "The polls have
shown that Jerry is ahead but the only
poll we go by is the one on election
day."
She credited her brother with run
ning an administration characterized

by "openness and experimenta
tion."
"Jerry has been instrumental in br
inging more women, more blacks
and more Chicanos into the
decision-making process in Califor
nia," she said. "New people have
brought in new ideas and new vis
ions. Jerry has used his energy and
imagination to turn these ideas into
creative programs."
Brown's quick implementation of
Proposition 13, which he steadfastly
opposed until the public's "dramatic
statement" for a property tax cut,
showed his ability to be a "strong,
forceful, decisive leader," she said.
"I think Proposition 13 de
monstrated Jerry's ability to lead and
to make decisions following the will
of the people," Rice said.
"He's not slashing mindlessly
through state-sponsored programs,"
Rice said in the interview. "He's try
ing to keep all the basic human ser
vices going and he's trying to do it at
a cost that the public is willing to
pay."
State-funded abortions are one of
the programs Brown is "vigorously"
fighting for, she said.
"Jerry isn't personally in favor of
abortions but he feels that as long as
they are going to be offered to wo

men, they should be given fairly to
the rich and poor alike."
Rice didn't know Brown's stand on
the controversial tuition tax credit
bill now going through federal legis
lation, nor did she know his opinion
on lowering the drinking age to 18 in
California.
"I know he opposes the legaliza
tion of marijuana because he be
lieves we use too many artificial sub
stances already," she said. "He feels
a control on marijuana is approp
riate."
Rice, currently a school board
member in Los Angeles, said Brown
wants reforms in the state's public
schools.
"He wants to tie increased fund
ings for schools to reforms," she
said. "The hallmark of the 1960s was
quantity in school. The job now is to
get quality."
But if Brown is elected to the
gubernatorial position in November,
will he give up the seat to try for the
White House in 1980?
"Right now he has a difficult
November election ahead of him,"
she said. "But then again, he has a
hard time deciding what he's going
to do two weeks from now, let alone
two years."

statement" for a property tax cut,
showed his ability to be a "strong,
forceful, decisive leader," she said.
"I think Proposition 13 de
monstrated Jerry's ability to lead and
to make decisions following the will
of the people," Rice said.
"He's not slashing mindlessly
through state-sponsored programs,"
Rice said in the interview. "He's try
ing to keep all the basic human ser
vices going and he's trying to do it at
a cost that the public is willing to
pay."
State-funded abortions are one of
the programs Brown is "vigorously"
fighting for, she said.
"Jerry isn't personally in favor of
abortions but he feels that as long as
they are going to be offered to wo

men, they should be given fairly to
the rich and poor alike."
Rice didn't know Brown's stand on
the controversial tuition tax credit
bill now going through federal legis
lation, nor did she know his opinion
on lowering the drinking age to 18 in
California.
"I know he opposes the legaliza
tion of marijuana because he be
lieves we use too many artificial sub
stances already," she said. "He feels
a control on marijuana is approp
riate."
Rice, currently a school board
member in Los Angeles, said Brown
wants reforms in the state's public
schools.
"He wants to tie increased fund
ings for schools to reforms," she
said. "The hallmark of the 1960s was
quantity in school. The job now is to
get quality."
But if Brown is elected to the
gubernatorial position in November,
will he give up the seat to try for the
White House in 1980?
"Right now he has a difficult
November election ahead of him,"
she said. "But then again, he has a
hard time deciding what he's going
to do two weeks from now, let alone
two years."


Kathleen Brown Rice, the governor's sister, said yesterday
she came "to test the waters" of political attitudes at Stan-

ford. Governor Brown may himself visit here before the
election.
"Are you interested in Toga-parties
and Animal House or in maintaining
a high quality of life?" Kathleen
Brown Rice, sister of Gov. Jerry
Brown, asked about 200 students in
White Plaza yesterday.
Rice, a 1969 graduate of the Uni
versity, said her brother asked her to
come here to "test the waters" to
find out if students care about gov
ernment and if so, what their major
concerns are.
In an interview before her noon
speech yesterday, Rice said her
brother may still visit the campus be
fore election day Nov. 7.
"I don't know what his schedule
is," she said. "I know he's been hit
ting colleges throughout California
for a registration drive, but I don't
know if he plans to stop by Stanford
or not."
Rice said Brown is "not overly con
fident" of winning the upcoming
election.
"No one is presuming an easy vic
tory," she said. "The polls have
shown that Jerry is ahead but the only
poll we go by is the one on election
day."
She credited her brother with run
ning an administration characterized

by "openness and experimenta
tion."
"Jerry has been instrumental in br
inging more women, more blacks
and more Chicanos into the
decision-making process in Califor
nia," she said. "New people have
brought in new ideas and new vis
ions. Jerry has used his energy and
imagination to turn these ideas into
creative programs."
Brown's quick implementation of
Proposition 13, which he steadfastly
opposed until the public's "dramatic
statement" for a property tax cut,
showed his ability to be a "strong,
forceful, decisive leader," she said.
"I think Proposition 13 de
monstrated Jerry's ability to lead and
to make decisions following the will
