## A
						foreign experience 
### 
There was a light drizzle fal
ling on the dark deserted
streets of Vienna's first district
as I walked alone back to my
Studentenheim after walking
Deb to the Schnellbahn sta
tion. We had had a long talk —
all in German, of course — and
it was afterwards that I realized
something. I realized then that
being in Austria meant a lot
more than being able to learn
the language or study the polit
ical system. Austria was for me
the window to a world, a world
of different people
everywhere.
My reasons for going over
seas were not extraordinary; I
hoped to approach fluency in
German and also to travel
some and discover a part of my
own history in the museums,
the architecture and the tradi
tions of old Europe. I arrived in
Vienna and immediately began
to study the language inten
sively and to look for "cross
cultural experiences." My
roommate, Franz, was an Aust
rian. "Great," I thought. I
would have many oppor
tunities to speak with "them,"
to really get to know "them." It
took a couple of months, but I
eventually saw that it really did
not matter that Franz or Hans-
Jorg or Wolfgang were Aust
rian.
The Austrians, the Germans,
the French and the English
were all more than just diffe
rent nationalities; they were all
real individual people. I
learned from them as such and
consequently realized far grea
ter knowledge than I could
have otherwise.
The first time I hitched to

Ebensee, I was picked up by an
Austrian men in his '60s, and he
began to talk. I forgot that this
was my tremendous opportun
ity to practice German, be
cause he began to talk about
life. He spoke of his experi
ences on the Russian Front in
World War 11, of the death and
destruction and then of the
Russian threat to Europe
("they'll take over all of Europe
within 20 years"). "Schade,
schade," he said. "It's a real
pity." Then he said, "But life is
beautiful. Look around you.
Alles ist schon.' Life is always a
wonder no matter what hap
pens."
The same thing was con
veyed to me many times in
many ways: as I played Frisbee
with Franz and IHans-Jorg on a
spring night before the Vienna
Rathaus; when I literally ran
down the slopes of the Eben
seer Sonnstein and into a
Gasthaus for a beer with
Wolfgang, the manager of the
Ebensee youth hostel; and
when Dominique and I com
municated through a combina
tion of broken English, hand
signals, and armfuls of smiles
the night she took me home to
sleep on the family couch
when the youth hostel was
closed.
All of the values I was ex
posed to in Austria may not be
perfect, but certain ones did
stand out. For instance, there is
nothing more important than a
person. There was always time
to sit down with some friends
and a bottle of wine and just
talk. If you did not have the
time, you "take the time," as
Wolfgang said. Life is slower,

moregemutlich (a word which
is used often, but has no literal
translation — means pleasant
and agreeable). The Austrian
schilling isn't quite so mighty
as the dollar, so quality at a
personal level remains a trea
sure.
My German is pretty good
now and I even know some
thing about the history, the
economics and the politics of
Austria. But I think I learned a
lot more about her people and
people everywhere. As an East
German woman said in a train
near Hamburg, "überall ist es
schon."
