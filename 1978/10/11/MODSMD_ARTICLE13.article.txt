## A 						purpose for Memorial Church 
### 
Stanford Memorial Church, in the
minds of some, is a carbuncle on the fair
face of the University, a blot on a page
otherwise free of mythology and supersti
tion, a final manifestation of the power
which Mrs. Stanford's money lent to her
piety. To others, it is a refuge from an
academic world increasingly hostile to re
ligion, a safe haven, a bastion of faith in an
unbelieving land. The truth, as usual, lies
somewhere inbetween. For it is true that
many academics are intolerant of religious
belief, and that it is common for profes
sors and graduate TA's to speak of Cod as a
quaint illusion that obsessed our mis
guided predecessors.
Nonetheless, religion, like love, death
and bureaucracy, will out.
Its forms may change and its traditional
manifestations may be suppressed, but it
will continue to live. To anyone who looks
with half an eye, it is clear that the Univer
sity is alive with religiosities and pieties of
all descriptions. And Memorial Church,
far from being a wellspring of religion in a
desert of unfaith, is in reality a single drop
of one kind of religion in a sea of a
thousand others.
It is quite likely that undergraduates
who read this statement may scoff at it.
After all, a religion isn't evident until you
immerse yourself in it. And an under
graduate cannot do this; he or she is com
pelled, by University distribution re
quirements, to be exceedingly eclectic
and ecumenical, sampling the faiths of
numerous departments and divisions. It is
when one becomes a graduate student
that the University's religiosity becomes
truly apparent.
The first step is, of course, to become an

acolyte (advisee) to one of the high de
partmental priests. To do this, one must
prepare an offering ("statement of pur
pose"), richly laden with the appropriate
departmental Shibboleths and lay it at the
feet of the departmental guardians (ad
missions committee). The offering is care
fully inspected. Does it contain evidence
of a thorough grounding in the faith? Are
the requisite words — "scientific, empiri
cal, objective, information-processing,
mathematicisation" — in rich abundance?
Are there any signs of latent or realized
heresy? Does the aspirant show signs of
sainthood ("a capacity and appreciation
for accurate and well-disciplined learning
coupled with an open and innovative out
look")? And preparation of the offering is
fraught with danger, for one department's
orthodoxy (e.g. that of the Psychology de
partment) is another's heresy (e.g. a de
partment in the Humanities).
But University religiosity is not limited to
competing departmental metaphysics, or
inaccessible to undergraduates. Like every
good religion, ours take outward forms of
observance as well. We have our rituals of
initiation ("becoming a Stanford man/
woman") and our liturgical rites. What,
after all, do people do in a religious rite?
They put on special clothes, walk in pre
scribed formations, make prescribed ges
tures, and utter carefully formulated
sounds — a perfect description of a Uni
versity football game. And University, re
ligion appeals to the viscera as well as the
mind and the heart. Who has not felt that
wondrous tension, that quivering feeling
somewhere between the stomach and the
gall baldder, as the music of the Band drifts
around a nearby corner? Surely this is the

sensum numinosum that is the hallmark of
real religious experience.
Given that all of this is true (and if you
still don't believe it, accept it on faith),
what place is left for Memorial Church?
Perhaps, since the religion it represents is
an anachronism, superceded by newer,
more practical forms, it should be turned
into a museum of faith? Or torn down and
turned into a chemistry lab? To do this,
however, would be a great mistake. For
Memorial Church serves an important,
even a crucial function in the religious life
of the University. It is a receptacle for luna
tic letters.
The latest receipt is a 450-page book en
titled Crave and Urgent Warnings from
Heaven. It is a record and analysis of visita
tions of the blessed Virgin Mary to several
Catholic women. Cod, according to this
book, is dreadfully angry that modern
Christians receive Communion in the
hand (instead of in the mouth). And he is
furious at our casual acceptance of
obscenity and pornography. The Ball of
Redemption (an immense ball of flaming
gas) is about to strike!
With such an array of devotion of every
sort, real and potential shamans, rites,
myths, and rituals, it is difficult to see how
the University is going to make it into the
next century. If Cod, after all, is angry
about people receiving communion in the
hand, he must be furious at the multitude
of brave new religions which fill this Uni
versity. "What stands between us and the
wrath of the Ball of Redemption?" asks
Grave and Urgent Warnings. Whatindeed?

sainthood ("a capacity and appreciation
for accurate and well-disciplined learning
coupled with an open and innovative out
look")? And preparation of the offering is
fraught with danger, for one department's
orthodoxy (e.g. that of the Psychology de
partment) is another's heresy (e.g. a de

But University religiosity is not limited to
competing departmental metaphysics, or
inaccessible to undergraduates. Like every
good religion, ours take outward forms of
observance as well. We have our rituals of
initiation ("becoming a Stanford man/
woman") and our liturgical rites. What,
after all, do people do in a religious rite?
They put on special clothes, walk in pre
scribed formations, make prescribed ges
tures, and utter carefully formulated
sounds — a perfect description of a Uni
versity football game. And University, re
ligion appeals to the viscera as well as the
mind and the heart. Who has not felt that
wondrous tension, that quivering feeling
somewhere between the stomach and the
gall baldder, as the music of the Band drifts
around a nearby corner? Surely this is the

sensum numinosum that is the hallmark of
real religious experience.
Given that all of this is true (and if you
still don't believe it, accept it on faith),
what place is left for Memorial Church?
Perhaps, since the religion it represents is
an anachronism, superceded by newer,
more practical forms, it should be turned
into a museum of faith? Or torn down and
turned into a chemistry lab? To do this,
however, would be a great mistake. For
Memorial Church serves an important,
even a crucial function in the religious life
of the University. It is a receptacle for luna
tic letters.
The latest receipt is a 450-page book en

Heaven. It is a record and analysis of visita
tions of the blessed Virgin Mary to several
Catholic women. Cod, according to this
book, is dreadfully angry that modern
Christians receive Communion in the
hand (instead of in the mouth). And he is
furious at our casual acceptance of
obscenity and pornography. The Ball of
Redemption (an immense ball of flaming
gas) is about to strike!
With such an array of devotion of every
sort, real and potential shamans, rites,
myths, and rituals, it is difficult to see how
the University is going to make it into the
next century. If Cod, after all, is angry
about people receiving communion in the
hand, he must be furious at the multitude
of brave new religions which fill this Uni

wrath of the Ball of Redemption?" asks
Grave and Urgent Warnings. Whatindeed?

Stanford Memorial Church, in the
minds of some, is a carbuncle on the fair
face of the University, a blot on a page
otherwise free of mythology and supersti
tion, a final manifestation of the power
which Mrs. Stanford's money lent to her
piety. To others, it is a refuge from an
academic world increasingly hostile to re
ligion, a safe haven, a bastion of faith in an
unbelieving land. The truth, as usual, lies
somewhere inbetween. For it is true that
many academics are intolerant of religious
belief, and that it is common for profes
sors and graduate TA's to speak of Cod as a
quaint illusion that obsessed our mis
guided predecessors.
Nonetheless, religion, like love, death
and bureaucracy, will out.
Its forms may change and its traditional
manifestations may be suppressed, but it
will continue to live. To anyone who looks
with half an eye, it is clear that the Univer
sity is alive with religiosities and pieties of
all descriptions. And Memorial Church,
far from being a wellspring of religion in a
desert of unfaith, is in reality a single drop
of one kind of religion in a sea of a
thousand others.
It is quite likely that undergraduates
who read this statement may scoff at it.
After all, a religion isn't evident until you
immerse yourself in it. And an under
graduate cannot do this; he or she is com
pelled, by University distribution re
quirements, to be exceedingly eclectic
and ecumenical, sampling the faiths of
numerous departments and divisions. It is
when one becomes a graduate student
that the University's religiosity becomes
truly apparent.
The first step is, of course, to become an

acolyte (advisee) to one of the high de
partmental priests. To do this, one must
prepare an offering ("statement of pur
pose"), richly laden with the appropriate
departmental Shibboleths and lay it at the
feet of the departmental guardians (ad
missions committee). The offering is care
fully inspected. Does it contain evidence
of a thorough grounding in the faith? Are
the requisite words — "scientific, empiri
cal, objective, information-processing,
mathematicisation" — in rich abundance?

Stanford Memorial Church, in the
minds of some, is a carbuncle on the fair
face of the University, a blot on a page
otherwise free of mythology and supersti
tion, a final manifestation of the power
which Mrs. Stanford's money lent to her
piety. To others, it is a refuge from an
academic world increasingly hostile to re
ligion, a safe haven, a bastion of faith in an
unbelieving land. The truth, as usual, lies
somewhere inbetween. For it is true that
many academics are intolerant of religious
belief, and that it is common for profes
sors and graduate TA's to speak of Cod as a
quaint illusion that obsessed our mis
guided predecessors.
Nonetheless, religion, like love, death
and bureaucracy, will out.
Its forms may change and its traditional
manifestations may be suppressed, but it
will continue to live. To anyone who looks
with half an eye, it is clear that the Univer
sity is alive with religiosities and pieties of
all descriptions. And Memorial Church,
far from being a wellspring of religion in a
desert of unfaith, is in reality a single drop
of one kind of religion in a sea of a
thousand others.
It is quite likely that undergraduates
who read this statement may scoff at it.
After all, a religion isn't evident until you
immerse yourself in it. And an under
graduate cannot do this; he or she is com
pelled, by University distribution re
quirements, to be exceedingly eclectic
and ecumenical, sampling the faiths of
numerous departments and divisions. It is
when one becomes a graduate student
that the University's religiosity becomes
truly apparent.
The first step is, of course, to become an

acolyte (advisee) to one of the high de
partmental priests. To do this, one must
prepare an offering ("statement of pur
pose"), richly laden with the appropriate
departmental Shibboleths and lay it at the
feet of the departmental guardians (ad
missions committee). The offering is care
fully inspected. Does it contain evidence
of a thorough grounding in the faith? Are
the requisite words — "scientific, empiri
cal, objective, information-processing,
mathematicisation" — in rich abundance?
Are there any signs of latent or realized
heresy? Does the aspirant show signs of
sainthood ("a capacity and appreciation
for accurate and well-disciplined learning
coupled with an open and innovative out
look")? And preparation of the offering is
fraught with danger, for one department's
orthodoxy (e.g. that of the Psychology de
partment) is another's heresy (e.g. a de
partment in the Humanities).
But University religiosity is not limited to
competing departmental metaphysics, or
inaccessible to undergraduates. Like every
good religion, ours take outward forms of
observance as well. We have our rituals of
initiation ("becoming a Stanford man/
woman") and our liturgical rites. What,
after all, do people do in a religious rite?
They put on special clothes, walk in pre
scribed formations, make prescribed ges
tures, and utter carefully formulated
sounds — a perfect description of a Uni
versity football game. And University, re
ligion appeals to the viscera as well as the
mind and the heart. Who has not felt that
wondrous tension, that quivering feeling
somewhere between the stomach and the
gall baldder, as the music of the Band drifts
around a nearby corner? Surely this is the

sensum numinosum that is the hallmark of
real religious experience.
Given that all of this is true (and if you
still don't believe it, accept it on faith),
what place is left for Memorial Church?
Perhaps, since the religion it represents is
an anachronism, superceded by newer,
more practical forms, it should be turned
into a museum of faith? Or torn down and
turned into a chemistry lab? To do this,
however, would be a great mistake. For
Memorial Church serves an important,
even a crucial function in the religious life
of the University. It is a receptacle for luna
tic letters.
The latest receipt is a 450-page book en
titled Crave and Urgent Warnings from
Heaven. It is a record and analysis of visita
tions of the blessed Virgin Mary to several
Catholic women. Cod, according to this
book, is dreadfully angry that modern
Christians receive Communion in the
hand (instead of in the mouth). And he is
furious at our casual acceptance of
obscenity and pornography. The Ball of
Redemption (an immense ball of flaming
gas) is about to strike!
