KZSU programs
As a newcomer to the Communica
tion Department and the University, I
am greatly disappointed with the Uni
versity radio station KZSU. A non
commercial radio station has such po
tential to be an alternative to the slick
programming fed to us by AM and FM
radio. Yet KZSU elects to program 75 to
80 percent rock music concentrati ng on
the newest cuts from the music indus
try. A university-affiliated station has so
many resources for diverse program
ming. Not only are there faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students
with varying experiences and skills, but
a large population of foreign students
with much to share. Members of the
Palo Alto community also have exper
tise that would be an asset to the sta
tion.
There are a couple of suggestions I
would like to make to improve the qual
ity of the programming at KZSU.
1. Initiate a training program with an
emphasis on study groups to help
people pass the FCC Third Class
License exam. This would encourage
more people to participate and hope
fully bring about a more varied group of
broadcasters.
2. Reach out to the community for
help. Work with groups like SWOPSI or
the Communication Department to
produce more public affairs program
ming. Search for those broadcasters
you need to round out programming
(i.e. experts in classical, bluegrass, Af
rican, Yugoslavian music, etc.). Ar
range cooperative situations between
new and more experienced broadcas
ters.
Why try to emulate commercial sta
tions? With its increase in wattage KZSU
could be something new and refresh
ing for Palo Alto and all the people of
the Bay area.
"Thanks for listening."

Prof. Krumboltz's letter in Monday's
Daily (Oct. 9), criticized a series of car
toons which he felt ridiculed P.E.
majors. His letter struck me as overly
sensitive and illogically argued. To
compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks,
and women with that of P.E. majors is
an argument of improper association.
The"former are the way they are by
nature; they didn't choose their roles
and can't change them. The same could

be said for homosexuals, retarded chil
dren, and dwarfs. To be funny about
these groups without being cruel is
often difficult. But P.E. majors are in a
different class of voluntarily-assumed
roles, like housewives, garbagemen,
and college professors. A member of
such a group should be able to laugh at
a joke about his group because he
should know that role is not his essen
tial self.
Like Professor Krumboltz, I too did
not find that particular series of car
toons funny. I thought they just fell flat.
But they were hardly offensive. Frankly,
I think the idea of P.E. majors is ridicul
ous. Perhaps the University in its in
stitutional wisdom sensed this as well
when it made majoring in P.E. here im
possible. So we are spared the sarcasm
directed at the "jock" factories of the
southwest that pass for universities.
Prof. Krumboltz's letter makes me
wonder whom he thinks he is defend
ing against the "distasteful"
stereotypes of the Daily cartoonist.
Since the University has no P.E. major,
it is hard to imagine who could be per
sonally offended by these cartoons. If
the professor is righteously defending
an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public
voice, I suggest that he take up the
cause of short people, to which I have
been devoted for some time.
I found the cartoons in questions to
be less a source of alarm over the moral
fiber of the community than Prof.
Krumboltz's letter itself. That same day
Gil Morales' cartoon satirized the Art
Department, and rather nicely too, I
thought. Can the School of Education
and Prof. Krumboltz be far behind? Co
to it, cartoonists. *

Senate reform
Approximately one year ago, I was an
"aspiring politico" running for the
ASSU Senate. I campaigned alone,
without a slate, because I genuinely be
lieved that I could help the condition of
undergraduate life here, if given the
chance to serve as an ASSU Senator.
Although no longer a senator, I still
believe that last year's senate could
have accomplished many worthwhile
things had it not been plagued by a
dominating slate and an election review
board.
Unfortunately, in an ironic twist of
fate, on the October ballot the students
will not only be voting for senators, but

also deciding on the existence of the
senate itself.
After two years of working within the
ASSU system, I feel that the abolition of
the senate would be a drastic mistake.
Most candidates really believe that
achievements can be reached and is
sues dealth with — all within the con
fines of the ASSU Senate.
Granted, past senates have been
dominated by slates and interest
groups, but for that, the students can
only blame themselves. Each student
has a vote, but only a small minority
each year expresses this right to elect its
student representatives.
Eliminating the senate would wipe
out the checks and balances process
inherent in the student legislative sys
tem. But more importantly, it would
destroy any hope for future reform. The
failures of the senate only reflect the
failures of the student body to recog
nize the restrictions of a student senate
which is required to work within a pre
determined framework of guidelines.-
Don't be fooled by the Committee to
Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) prop
osal to abolish the senate. Instead, con
sider each candidate carefully and vote
for those individuals who will both
work for senate reform and be respon
sive to student needs.
Eliminating the senate would also
eliminate a large portion of the student'
voice into the University system — un
fortunately at a time when student con
cern with issues is desperately needed.
Speaking from personal experience,
I know there are many easier ways to
gain acceptance to law school besides
running for ASSU Senate. I think most
of the candidates really want to help
and serve the rest of us.

Prop. 6 issue
David Miller should be commended
for coming out against the Briggs Initia
tive (Daily, Oct. 6) but in his libertarian
zeal he failed to clearly state the real
issue of the campaign.
The truth of the matter is that gays are
being scapegoated. Many Americans
are participating in a conservative trend
in which they are tired of dealing with
the complexities of modern life and
prefer definite, traditional answers.
Frustrated by what they perceive as
growing social problems and a decline
in "family values," they are taking it out

on the most misunderstood minority,
the homosexuals.
Proposition 6 is a perfect example of
this reactionary mood which is nur
tured by emotional exaggerations and
lies for purely political reasons.
The absurdity of the proposed law
hardly needs illustration. From DaVinci
to Tchaikowsky, the positive influence
of homosexuals throughout history are
numerous, though usually overlooked.
And though gays may not be born with
a specifically homosexual orientation,
most research shows that orientation is
set in pre-school years. Thus, while an
openly gay teacher might help a gay
youth become aware of his/her sexual
ity, the teacher could not influence the
orientation.
Presently, California codes protect
children from teachers who promote
their sexuality; even Reagan believes
the proposition is not needed.
What then is the true intent of Briggs?
It is to propose that homosexuality is
not a legitimate lifestyle, forcing it to
remain a dark, hidden perversion that is
feared and despised.
No one will be "protected" from the
deviances of others. The only effect is
that gay teachers will live in constant
fear of being seen near certain estab
lishments or people, or making a slip of
the tongue about their lifestyles or
political views to any fellow employee
or student.
The true horror of the proposal is the
McCarthyistic atmosphere it could pro
voke. For a teacher to stand up for the
rights of an accused co-worker would
only make him/her subject to the same
accusation. Any student or parent
strongly dissatisfied with a teacher
need only file a complaint, resulting in
an expensive hearing and a shameful
invasion of privacy for the defendant,
who must disprove the accusation
through testimony and witnesses.
All teachers will be restricted in using
physical contact with students, men
tioning homosexuality in anything but a
negative way and in anything which
could make them unpopular with stu
dents, parents or co-workers.
In short, the Briggs Initiatve is a total
bummer.
Since the University is supposedly fil
led with bright minds, most people
here surely are perceptive enough to
see what's really going on. The only
question is whether they will de
monstrate that insight in the voting
booths.

dominated by slates and interest
groups, but for that, the students can
only blame themselves. Each student
has a vote, but only a small minority
each year expresses this right to elect its
student representatives.
Eliminating the senate would wipe
out the checks and balances process
inherent in the student legislative sys
tem. But more importantly, it would
destroy any hope for future reform. The
failures of the senate only reflect the
failures of the student body to recog
nize the restrictions of a student senate
which is required to work within a pre

Don't be fooled by the Committee to
Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) prop
osal to abolish the senate. Instead, con
sider each candidate carefully and vote
for those individuals who will both
work for senate reform and be respon
sive to student needs.
Eliminating the senate would also
eliminate a large portion of the student'
voice into the University system — un
fortunately at a time when student con
cern with issues is desperately needed.
Speaking from personal experience,
I know there are many easier ways to
gain acceptance to law school besides
running for ASSU Senate. I think most
of the candidates really want to help
and serve the rest of us.

Prop. 6 issue
David Miller should be commended
for coming out against the Briggs Initia
tive (Daily, Oct. 6) but in his libertarian
zeal he failed to clearly state the real
issue of the campaign.
The truth of the matter is that gays are
being scapegoated. Many Americans
are participating in a conservative trend
in which they are tired of dealing with
the complexities of modern life and
prefer definite, traditional answers.
Frustrated by what they perceive as
growing social problems and a decline
in "family values," they are taking it out

on the most misunderstood minority,
the homosexuals.
Proposition 6 is a perfect example of
this reactionary mood which is nur
tured by emotional exaggerations and
lies for purely political reasons.
The absurdity of the proposed law
hardly needs illustration. From DaVinci
to Tchaikowsky, the positive influence
of homosexuals throughout history are
numerous, though usually overlooked.
And though gays may not be born with
a specifically homosexual orientation,
most research shows that orientation is
set in pre-school years. Thus, while an
openly gay teacher might help a gay
youth become aware of his/her sexual
ity, the teacher could not influence the
orientation.
Presently, California codes protect
children from teachers who promote
their sexuality; even Reagan believes
the proposition is not needed.
What then is the true intent of Briggs?
It is to propose that homosexuality is
not a legitimate lifestyle, forcing it to
remain a dark, hidden perversion that is
feared and despised.
No one will be "protected" from the
deviances of others. The only effect is
that gay teachers will live in constant
fear of being seen near certain estab
lishments or people, or making a slip of
the tongue about their lifestyles or
political views to any fellow employee
or student.
The true horror of the proposal is the
McCarthyistic atmosphere it could pro
voke. For a teacher to stand up for the
rights of an accused co-worker would
only make him/her subject to the same
accusation. Any student or parent
strongly dissatisfied with a teacher
need only file a complaint, resulting in
an expensive hearing and a shameful
invasion of privacy for the defendant,
who must disprove the accusation
through testimony and witnesses.
All teachers will be restricted in using
physical contact with students, men
tioning homosexuality in anything but a
negative way and in anything which
could make them unpopular with stu
dents, parents or co-workers.
In short, the Briggs Initiatve is a total
bummer.
Since the University is supposedly fil
led with bright minds, most people
here surely are perceptive enough to
see what's really going on. The only
question is whether they will de
monstrate that insight in the voting
booths.

KZSU programs
As a newcomer to the Communica
tion Department and the University, I
am greatly disappointed with the Uni
versity radio station KZSU. A non
commercial radio station has such po
tential to be an alternative to the slick
programming fed to us by AM and FM
radio. Yet KZSU elects to program 75 to
80 percent rock music concentrati ng on
the newest cuts from the music indus
try. A university-affiliated station has so
many resources for diverse program
ming. Not only are there faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students
with varying experiences and skills, but
a large population of foreign students
with much to share. Members of the
Palo Alto community also have exper
tise that would be an asset to the sta
tion.
There are a couple of suggestions I
would like to make to improve the qual
ity of the programming at KZSU.
1. Initiate a training program with an
emphasis on study groups to help
people pass the FCC Third Class
License exam. This would encourage
more people to participate and hope
fully bring about a more varied group of
broadcasters.
2. Reach out to the community for
help. Work with groups like SWOPSI or
the Communication Department to
produce more public affairs program
ming. Search for those broadcasters
you need to round out programming
(i.e. experts in classical, bluegrass, Af
rican, Yugoslavian music, etc.). Ar
range cooperative situations between
new and more experienced broadcas
ters.
Why try to emulate commercial sta
tions? With its increase in wattage KZSU
could be something new and refresh
ing for Palo Alto and all the people of
the Bay area.

Cartoon humor
Prof. Krumboltz's letter in Monday's
Daily (Oct. 9), criticized a series of car
toons which he felt ridiculed P.E.
majors. His letter struck me as overly
sensitive and illogically argued. To
compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks,
and women with that of P.E. majors is
an argument of improper association.
The"former are the way they are by
nature; they didn't choose their roles
and can't change them. The same could

be said for homosexuals, retarded chil
dren, and dwarfs. To be funny about
these groups without being cruel is
often difficult. But P.E. majors are in a
different class of voluntarily-assumed
roles, like housewives, garbagemen,
and college professors. A member of
such a group should be able to laugh at
a joke about his group because he
should know that role is not his essen
tial self.
Like Professor Krumboltz, I too did
not find that particular series of car
toons funny. I thought they just fell flat.
But they were hardly offensive. Frankly,
I think the idea of P.E. majors is ridicul
ous. Perhaps the University in its in
stitutional wisdom sensed this as well
when it made majoring in P.E. here im
possible. So we are spared the sarcasm
directed at the "jock" factories of the
southwest that pass for universities.
Prof. Krumboltz's letter makes me
wonder whom he thinks he is defend
ing against the "distasteful"
stereotypes of the Daily cartoonist.
Since the University has no P.E. major,
it is hard to imagine who could be per
sonally offended by these cartoons. If
the professor is righteously defending
an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public
voice, I suggest that he take up the
cause of short people, to which I have
been devoted for some time.
I found the cartoons in questions to
be less a source of alarm over the moral
fiber of the community than Prof.
Krumboltz's letter itself. That same day
Gil Morales' cartoon satirized the Art
Department, and rather nicely too, I
thought. Can the School of Education
and Prof. Krumboltz be far behind? Co
to it, cartoonists. *

Senate reform
Approximately one year ago, I was an
"aspiring politico" running for the
ASSU Senate. I campaigned alone,
without a slate, because I genuinely be
lieved that I could help the condition of
undergraduate life here, if given the
chance to serve as an ASSU Senator.
Although no longer a senator, I still
believe that last year's senate could
have accomplished many worthwhile
things had it not been plagued by a
dominating slate and an election review
board.
Unfortunately, in an ironic twist of
fate, on the October ballot the students
will not only be voting for senators, but

also deciding on the existence of the
senate itself.
After two years of working within the
ASSU system, I feel that the abolition of
the senate would be a drastic mistake.
Most candidates really believe that
achievements can be reached and is
sues dealth with — all within the con
fines of the ASSU Senate.

Cartoon humor
Prof. Krumboltz's letter in Monday's
Daily (Oct. 9), criticized a series of car
toons which he felt ridiculed P.E.
majors. His letter struck me as overly
sensitive and illogically argued. To
compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks,
and women with that of P.E. majors is
an argument of improper association.
The"former are the way they are by
nature; they didn't choose their roles
and can't change them. The same could

be said for homosexuals, retarded chil
dren, and dwarfs. To be funny about
these groups without being cruel is
often difficult. But P.E. majors are in a
different class of voluntarily-assumed
roles, like housewives, garbagemen,
and college professors. A member of
such a group should be able to laugh at
a joke about his group because he
should know that role is not his essen
tial self.
Like Professor Krumboltz, I too did
not find that particular series of car
toons funny. I thought they just fell flat.
But they were hardly offensive. Frankly,
I think the idea of P.E. majors is ridicul
ous. Perhaps the University in its in
stitutional wisdom sensed this as well
when it made majoring in P.E. here im
possible. So we are spared the sarcasm
directed at the "jock" factories of the
southwest that pass for universities.
Prof. Krumboltz's letter makes me
wonder whom he thinks he is defend
ing against the "distasteful"
stereotypes of the Daily cartoonist.
Since the University has no P.E. major,
it is hard to imagine who could be per
sonally offended by these cartoons. If
the professor is righteously defending
an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public
voice, I suggest that he take up the
cause of short people, to which I have
been devoted for some time.
I found the cartoons in questions to
be less a source of alarm over the moral
fiber of the community than Prof.
Krumboltz's letter itself. That same day
Gil Morales' cartoon satirized the Art
Department, and rather nicely too, I
thought. Can the School of Education
and Prof. Krumboltz be far behind? Co
to it, cartoonists. *

Senate reform
Approximately one year ago, I was an
"aspiring politico" running for the
ASSU Senate. I campaigned alone,
without a slate, because I genuinely be
lieved that I could help the condition of
undergraduate life here, if given the
chance to serve as an ASSU Senator.
Although no longer a senator, I still
believe that last year's senate could
have accomplished many worthwhile
things had it not been plagued by a
dominating slate and an election review
board.
Unfortunately, in an ironic twist of
fate, on the October ballot the students
will not only be voting for senators, but

also deciding on the existence of the
senate itself.
After two years of working within the
ASSU system, I feel that the abolition of
the senate would be a drastic mistake.
Most candidates really believe that
achievements can be reached and is
sues dealth with — all within the con
fines of the ASSU Senate.
Granted, past senates have been
dominated by slates and interest
groups, but for that, the students can
only blame themselves. Each student
has a vote, but only a small minority
each year expresses this right to elect its
student representatives.
Eliminating the senate would wipe
out the checks and balances process
inherent in the student legislative sys
tem. But more importantly, it would
destroy any hope for future reform. The
failures of the senate only reflect the
failures of the student body to recog
nize the restrictions of a student senate
which is required to work within a pre
determined framework of guidelines.-
Don't be fooled by the Committee to
Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) prop
osal to abolish the senate. Instead, con
sider each candidate carefully and vote
for those individuals who will both
work for senate reform and be respon
sive to student needs.
Eliminating the senate would also
eliminate a large portion of the student'
voice into the University system — un
fortunately at a time when student con
cern with issues is desperately needed.
Speaking from personal experience,
I know there are many easier ways to
gain acceptance to law school besides
running for ASSU Senate. I think most
of the candidates really want to help
and serve the rest of us.

Prop. 6 issue
David Miller should be commended
for coming out against the Briggs Initia
tive (Daily, Oct. 6) but in his libertarian
zeal he failed to clearly state the real
issue of the campaign.
The truth of the matter is that gays are
being scapegoated. Many Americans
are participating in a conservative trend
in which they are tired of dealing with
the complexities of modern life and
prefer definite, traditional answers.
Frustrated by what they perceive as
growing social problems and a decline
in "family values," they are taking it out

on the most misunderstood minority,
the homosexuals.
Proposition 6 is a perfect example of
this reactionary mood which is nur
tured by emotional exaggerations and
lies for purely political reasons.
The absurdity of the proposed law
hardly needs illustration. From DaVinci
to Tchaikowsky, the positive influence
of homosexuals throughout history are
numerous, though usually overlooked.
And though gays may not be born with
a specifically homosexual orientation,
most research shows that orientation is
set in pre-school years. Thus, while an
openly gay teacher might help a gay
youth become aware of his/her sexual
ity, the teacher could not influence the
orientation.
Presently, California codes protect
children from teachers who promote
their sexuality; even Reagan believes
the proposition is not needed.
What then is the true intent of Briggs?
It is to propose that homosexuality is
not a legitimate lifestyle, forcing it to
remain a dark, hidden perversion that is
feared and despised.
No one will be "protected" from the
deviances of others. The only effect is
that gay teachers will live in constant
fear of being seen near certain estab
lishments or people, or making a slip of
the tongue about their lifestyles or
political views to any fellow employee
or student.
The true horror of the proposal is the
McCarthyistic atmosphere it could pro
voke. For a teacher to stand up for the
rights of an accused co-worker would
only make him/her subject to the same
accusation. Any student or parent
strongly dissatisfied with a teacher
need only file a complaint, resulting in
an expensive hearing and a shameful
invasion of privacy for the defendant,
who must disprove the accusation
through testimony and witnesses.
All teachers will be restricted in using
physical contact with students, men
tioning homosexuality in anything but a
negative way and in anything which
could make them unpopular with stu
dents, parents or co-workers.
In short, the Briggs Initiatve is a total
bummer.
Since the University is supposedly fil
led with bright minds, most people
here surely are perceptive enough to
see what's really going on. The only
question is whether they will de
monstrate that insight in the voting
booths.

KZSU programs
As a newcomer to the Communica
tion Department and the University, I
am greatly disappointed with the Uni
versity radio station KZSU. A non
commercial radio station has such po
tential to be an alternative to the slick
programming fed to us by AM and FM
radio. Yet KZSU elects to program 75 to
80 percent rock music concentrati ng on
the newest cuts from the music indus
try. A university-affiliated station has so
many resources for diverse program
ming. Not only are there faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students
with varying experiences and skills, but
a large population of foreign students
with much to share. Members of the
Palo Alto community also have exper
tise that would be an asset to the sta
tion.
There are a couple of suggestions I
would like to make to improve the qual
ity of the programming at KZSU.
1. Initiate a training program with an
emphasis on study groups to help
people pass the FCC Third Class
License exam. This would encourage
more people to participate and hope
fully bring about a more varied group of
broadcasters.
2. Reach out to the community for

Prop. 6 issue
David Miller should be commended
for coming out against the Briggs Initia
tive (Daily, Oct. 6) but in his libertarian
zeal he failed to clearly state the real
issue of the campaign.
The truth of the matter is that gays are
being scapegoated. Many Americans
are participating in a conservative trend
in which they are tired of dealing with
the complexities of modern life and
prefer definite, traditional answers.
Frustrated by what they perceive as
growing social problems and a decline
in "family values," they are taking it out

on the most misunderstood minority,
the homosexuals.
Proposition 6 is a perfect example of
this reactionary mood which is nur
tured by emotional exaggerations and
lies for purely political reasons.
The absurdity of the proposed law
hardly needs illustration. From DaVinci
to Tchaikowsky, the positive influence
of homosexuals throughout history are
numerous, though usually overlooked.
And though gays may not be born with
a specifically homosexual orientation,
most research shows that orientation is
set in pre-school years. Thus, while an
openly gay teacher might help a gay
youth become aware of his/her sexual
ity, the teacher could not influence the
orientation.
Presently, California codes protect
children from teachers who promote
their sexuality; even Reagan believes
the proposition is not needed.
What then is the true intent of Briggs?
It is to propose that homosexuality is
not a legitimate lifestyle, forcing it to
remain a dark, hidden perversion that is
feared and despised.
No one will be "protected" from the
deviances of others. The only effect is
that gay teachers will live in constant
fear of being seen near certain estab
lishments or people, or making a slip of
the tongue about their lifestyles or
political views to any fellow employee
or student.
The true horror of the proposal is the
McCarthyistic atmosphere it could pro
voke. For a teacher to stand up for the
rights of an accused co-worker would
only make him/her subject to the same
accusation. Any student or parent
strongly dissatisfied with a teacher
need only file a complaint, resulting in
an expensive hearing and a shameful
invasion of privacy for the defendant,
who must disprove the accusation
through testimony and witnesses.
All teachers will be restricted in using
physical contact with students, men
tioning homosexuality in anything but a
negative way and in anything which
could make them unpopular with stu
dents, parents or co-workers.
In short, the Briggs Initiatve is a total
bummer.
Since the University is supposedly fil
led with bright minds, most people
here surely are perceptive enough to
see what's really going on. The only
question is whether they will de
monstrate that insight in the voting
booths.

KZSU programs
As a newcomer to the Communica
tion Department and the University, I
am greatly disappointed with the Uni
versity radio station KZSU. A non
commercial radio station has such po
tential to be an alternative to the slick
programming fed to us by AM and FM
radio. Yet KZSU elects to program 75 to
80 percent rock music concentrati ng on
the newest cuts from the music indus
try. A university-affiliated station has so
many resources for diverse program
ming. Not only are there faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students
with varying experiences and skills, but
a large population of foreign students
with much to share. Members of the
Palo Alto community also have exper
tise that would be an asset to the sta
tion.
There are a couple of suggestions I
would like to make to improve the qual
ity of the programming at KZSU.
1. Initiate a training program with an
emphasis on study groups to help
people pass the FCC Third Class
License exam. This would encourage
more people to participate and hope
fully bring about a more varied group of
broadcasters.
2. Reach out to the community for
help. Work with groups like SWOPSI or
the Communication Department to
produce more public affairs program
ming. Search for those broadcasters
you need to round out programming
(i.e. experts in classical, bluegrass, Af
rican, Yugoslavian music, etc.). Ar
range cooperative situations between
new and more experienced broadcas
ters.
Why try to emulate commercial sta
tions? With its increase in wattage KZSU
could be something new and refresh
ing for Palo Alto and all the people of
the Bay area.

Cartoon humor
Prof. Krumboltz's letter in Monday's
Daily (Oct. 9), criticized a series of car
toons which he felt ridiculed P.E.
majors. His letter struck me as overly
sensitive and illogically argued. To
compare the ridicule of Poles, blacks,
and women with that of P.E. majors is
an argument of improper association.
The"former are the way they are by
nature; they didn't choose their roles
and can't change them. The same could

be said for homosexuals, retarded chil
dren, and dwarfs. To be funny about
these groups without being cruel is
often difficult. But P.E. majors are in a
different class of voluntarily-assumed
roles, like housewives, garbagemen,
and college professors. A member of
such a group should be able to laugh at
a joke about his group because he
should know that role is not his essen
tial self.
Like Professor Krumboltz, I too did
not find that particular series of car
toons funny. I thought they just fell flat.
But they were hardly offensive. Frankly,
I think the idea of P.E. majors is ridicul
ous. Perhaps the University in its in
stitutional wisdom sensed this as well
when it made majoring in P.E. here im
possible. So we are spared the sarcasm
directed at the "jock" factories of the
southwest that pass for universities.
Prof. Krumboltz's letter makes me
wonder whom he thinks he is defend
ing against the "distasteful"
stereotypes of the Daily cartoonist.
Since the University has no P.E. major,
it is hard to imagine who could be per
sonally offended by these cartoons. If
the professor is righteously defending
an otherwise unknown oppressed
group that has not yet found its public
voice, I suggest that he take up the
cause of short people, to which I have
been devoted for some time.
I found the cartoons in questions to
be less a source of alarm over the moral
fiber of the community than Prof.
Krumboltz's letter itself. That same day
Gil Morales' cartoon satirized the Art
Department, and rather nicely too, I
thought. Can the School of Education
and Prof. Krumboltz be far behind? Co
to it, cartoonists. *

Senate reform
Approximately one year ago, I was an
"aspiring politico" running for the
ASSU Senate. I campaigned alone,
without a slate, because I genuinely be
lieved that I could help the condition of
undergraduate life here, if given the
chance to serve as an ASSU Senator.
Although no longer a senator, I still
believe that last year's senate could
have accomplished many worthwhile
things had it not been plagued by a
dominating slate and an election review
board.
Unfortunately, in an ironic twist of
fate, on the October ballot the students
will not only be voting for senators, but

also deciding on the existence of the
senate itself.
After two years of working within the
ASSU system, I feel that the abolition of
the senate would be a drastic mistake.
Most candidates really believe that
achievements can be reached and is
sues dealth with — all within the con
fines of the ASSU Senate.
Granted, past senates have been
dominated by slates and interest
groups, but for that, the students can
only blame themselves. Each student
has a vote, but only a small minority
each year expresses this right to elect its
student representatives.
Eliminating the senate would wipe
out the checks and balances process
inherent in the student legislative sys
tem. But more importantly, it would
destroy any hope for future reform. The
failures of the senate only reflect the
failures of the student body to recog
nize the restrictions of a student senate
which is required to work within a pre
determined framework of guidelines.-
Don't be fooled by the Committee to
Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) prop
osal to abolish the senate. Instead, con
sider each candidate carefully and vote
for those individuals who will both
work for senate reform and be respon
sive to student needs.
Eliminating the senate would also
eliminate a large portion of the student'
voice into the University system — un
fortunately at a time when student con
cern with issues is desperately needed.
Speaking from personal experience,
I know there are many easier ways to
gain acceptance to law school besides
running for ASSU Senate. I think most
of the candidates really want to help
and serve the rest of us.
