# Group seeking to increase awareness of world issues
## 
### KATHLEEN WHEATON 
New Directions, a student organization seek
ing to increase campus awareness of global
problems, is now one year old. Patterned after a
national citizens' lobby "for world security
through political, economic, social and en
vironmental justice," the chapter's aims have
been less ambitious but so far, extremely suc
cessful, according to Co-president Judy
Goyette.
"The most important goal of New Directions
is education," said Goyette.
In its first year the group sponsored a series of
symposia, sherry hours and bag lunches dealing
with international issues such as Eurocom
munism and world hunger. New Directions also
put out a monthly newsletter.
This year symposia are planned for the SALT II
negotiations and lesser known issues such as
the international tariff agreements.
"There's definitely a new climate of interest in
global problems on campus," Goyette said.
The "student apathy" of the early '70s seems
to be disappearing. Approximately 140 students,
faculty and staff attended the opening meeting
of New Directions last week. There are plans to
supplement the newsletter with a bi-monthly
update and a calendar which will inform stu

dents of all internationally-related events on
campus.
"The South Africa demonstration of two years
ago showed that student concern is there," said
Co-president Alan Alpert. "People want to be
better informed."
The co-presidents said the focus of New Di
rections will remain informational rather than
political. Although the group lobbied for ratifi
cation of the Panama Canal treaty last year, New
Directions is generally a nonpartisan group.
It seeks to provide speakers of opposing vie
wpoints, and to make the newsletter a source of
background material rather than an opinion
forum. Contributors may receive academic cre
dit for research on newsletter articles.
The newsletter also includes topics which do
not normally make newspaper headlines, such
as South American politics.
"We tend to remain isolationist until some
thing confronts us directly, like an oil em
bargo," Goyette said. "Hopefully New Direc
tions will give students a better perspective on
global problems."
Only seven issues of the newsletter could be
published due to lack of funds, but "the energy
and enthusiasm were definitely there," Alpert
said.
