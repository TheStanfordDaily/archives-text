# Sand Hill Expressway
## City council vetoes expansion 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
After undergoing seven years of
debate and getting an almost sure
go-ahead in January, the proposed
four-lane Sand Hill Expressway is
now a plan of the past.
The motion to transform Sand Hill
Road into a four-lane thoroughfare
from Santa Cruz intersection to El
Camino Real passed by a 4-2 vote.
However, a five-man vote is needed
to form an assessment district and
the Palo Alto City Council decided
unanimously to have planners shelve
the project.
The University had supported the
$6 million road expansion, designed
to alleviate the bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the two-lane artery bet
ween Interstate 280 and El Camino
Real.
"The most effective, long-range
solution consists of improvements at
the Santa Cruz intersection and a
four-lane, divided road from thereto
El Camino Real," Bill Massy, vice
president for business and finance
here, told the council last night.
Had the plan been approved, the
University would have had to pay
$1.8 million in assessments and
$800,000 for an extension of Campus
Driveand changes in the golf course.
Council members Frances Brenner
and Ellen Fletcher cast the two op
posing votes. Mayor Scott Carey,
Anne Witherspoon and Byron Sher

did not vote because of an alleged
conflict of interest.
Brenner opposed the four-lane
plan and advocated the council vote
for the 3-2 plan, which transforms
Sand Hill into a three-lane road from
Santa Cruz intersection to Pasteur
Drive and keeps the present two
lanes from Pasteur to El Camino.
The four-lane road, she said,
would force cars heading for Palo
Alto to come off El Camino Real and
take University or Hamilton avenues,
both of which are al ready congested.
"As a member of the Palo Alto City
Council, I could not justify an affir
mative vote for a four-lane road
which would have this effect, even
though it will help the Menlo Park
traffic situation and add business to
the Stanford Shopping Center," she
said.
As with the four-lane proposal,
Brenner's 3-2 plan would have Sand
Hill Road tying into El Camino on the
north side of the shopping center.
Sand Hill presently dead ends into
the shopping center's parking lot.
The 3-2 plan was also advocated by
the City Planning Department after it
analyzed this idea, the four-lane ex
tension and other alternatives. But
Brenner's motion to approve the 3-2
proposition failed by a 5-1 vote.
Fletcher opposed both the 3-2 plan
and the four-lane extension saying
neither would have solved the traffic
problem.

"The plan has neglected the im
portance of the intersection and sig
nalization at Santa Cruz and Sand Hill
Road," she said. "It's an undisputed
fact that congestion would be higher
at both the Santa Cruz and El Camino
Real intersections in all directions.
To make it worse doesn't solve the
problem.
"I'm not against improvements, I
just think this one isn't going to
work," she said before casting her
dissenting vote.
The Sand Hill Road controversy
first came under hot debate by the
city council seven years ago. Finally
in January, the council approved the
four-lane extension with separated
bike-pedestrian paths on both sides.
But two Palo Alto citizens filed suit
against the project, claiming the en
vironmental impact report had seri
ous defects and that Carey, Withers
poon and Sher were in a conflict of
interest.
Although the lawsuit was resolved,
the controversy over Sand Hill Road
may go on for some time. Vice-mayor
Alan Henderson still plans to take the
issue to the voting public by putting
extension alternatives on a May bal
lot.
"I'll wait one or two weeks before
taking action so I can see if the coun
cil can come to some sort of com
promise and so I can hear opinions
from the parties involved," he said
last night.
