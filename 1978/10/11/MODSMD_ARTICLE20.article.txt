# Outside the classroom, research continues
## Hypnosis: more than a swinging watch 
### ROGER BATCHELOR 
Popular conceptions of hypnosis bring to mind a
Viennese man with beady eyes, waving a pocket
watch on a chain in front of an innocent subject
who then does strange and bizarre acts she never
would have done otherwise.
Researchers at the Hypnosis and Motivation
Center here know otherwise. Though research
subjects there perform strange "routines" under
hypnosis, the experiments are designed to dis
cover innovative ways of controlling the human
mind and body processes, according to Ernest Hil
gard, director of the center.
Hypnosis entails "getting a certain type of per
son, at the suggestion of a skilled hypnotist, to
concentrate intensely," according to Hilgard.
Only certain types of people are hypnotizable:
the generally more adventuresome, imaginative
and less competitive, controlled and fearful, ac
cording to Philip Zimbardo, psychology professor
and hypnosis researcher.
These people can be easily identified, using a
test designed by Hilgard. "Easily hypnotizable
people can almost do it themselves. We get the
subject to relax so that he concentrates solely on
the suggestions of the hypnotist," Hilgard said.
Hilgard terms hypnosis as "an opportunity to
free the imagination in a convincing way." No
major physiological changes occur to an individual

in a hypnotic stage.
Yet hypnotized individuals can experience "odd
phenomena, such as perceptual distortion," Zim
bardo said. One hypnotized person, while smel
ling a rock, thought he smelled a rose merely by
the suggestion of the hypnotist. The hypnotized
individual then suffered his usual allergic reaction
to roses.
Hypnosis was used by a surgeon in India during
the mid-1800s to control pain in over 300 major
operations, including amputations. But the intro
duction of ether and other drugs eliminated in
terest in using hypnosis for alleviating pain.
Hilgard described a subject who ungrimacingly
"ate sour lemons, believing they were oranges."
Hypnosis also alters a subject's time perspec
tive. Zimbardo's work focuses on the human
sense of time orientation. Zimbardo says that
members of industrial societies, like our own, "are
oriented towards the future in order that we can
react to goals and deterrents."
Hypnotized subjects can become oriented to
deal only with situations in "the present."
"We might be able to make some present
oriented juvenile delinquents more aware of the
future and its consequences," Zimbardo said.
Hypnotized subjects can enter age regression.
They describe and reenact infantile experiences,
with few additions and distortions. Hypnotized

individuals can also control bad habits at the
suggestion of a hypnotist.
When observed carefully, the behavior of hyp
notized people gives a glimpse of internal, mental
processes â€” how they work and how they might
be "freed for experimental examination." Accord
ing to Zimbardo, this area, the cognitive internal
processes, has become the leading area of
scrutiny of psychologists within the last decade.
just 50 years ago, the study of hypnosis was
largely regarded by psychologists as too incredible
to be practical, according to Zimbardo. The work
of Hilgard at the Hypnosis and Motivation Center
here, and the researchers at the University of
Pennsylvania has made hypnosis "more accepted
as a down-to-earth, useful tool for psychologists,"
Hilgard said.
Work at the hypnosis research center here, has
been underway for nearly 20 years. Grants from
the National Institute of Mental Health have
funded research for the last 17 years. However, the
present grant ends in December, 1979. Hilgard will
not reapply for another grant, he said.
"I just plan to disengage a bit. The Psychology
Department has not announced plans for continu
ing or closing the research facility," he said.
The closing of this center, presently a possibility
Zimbardo said, "would be quite unfortunate for
Stanford, indeed for psychology."


Eyes closed, ears open, this subject has been placed under
hypnosis by Dr. Ernest Hilgard at the hypnosis research center
here. Her left arm sits in a tub of ice cold water while her right
hand is monitored by a machine which records bodily re
sponses.
