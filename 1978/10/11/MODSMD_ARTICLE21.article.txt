# Experimenters work to understand sleep
## 
### LEAH HALPER 
Dr. Arthur Foutz, a post-doctoral
research fellow at the sleep research
lab here, crouches silently and pas
ses his hand in front of a furry-faced
dog named Zeke. The tick of a stop
watch fills the experimental room.
"See," Foutz whispers. "He can
move his eyes and follow. He is not
asleep." Zeke's eyes gleam. He tries
to raise his head, food from the ex
periment still in his mouth, but his
neck muscles fail. Again he collapses
splay-legged, into what Foutz calls a
cataplexic state, brought on by the
positive emotional stimulus of a
mid-morning treat — in this case, 10
nuggets of beefy dogfood.
Cataplexy is one of the charac
teristic symptoms of narcolepsy, a
sleeping disorder which affects
dogs, ponies, bulls and some 50,000
Americans. Foutz and his lab assis
tants presently conduct experi
ments, like the one in which Zeke is
participating, several times daily on
a colony of 50 dogs, most of whom
are narcoleptic. Studying the dogs
will eventually yield answers to
questions about human narcolepsy,
Foutz said.
"Our goal is to try to find abnor
malities responsible for narcolepsy

— what causes it? There is good evi
dence that in dogs it is hereditary.
We do genetic studies on our colony
of dogs. I think we have found an
excellent mode of human disease in
them. And narcolepsy research can
also help us gather information on
the nature of healthy sleep."
For Zeke, a two-year-old wire
haired griffin, and the rest of his
canine friends, mostly Dobermans
and Toy Poodles, attacks of nar
colepsy are brouht on by intense
emotional moments.
"In the dogs, all the pleasant emo
tions seem to be the cause of attacks
— eating, playing, having sex,"
Foutz said. "The puppies here are
conceived mostly by artificial in
semination, because the dogs tend
to fall asleep."
Foutz says that humans with nar
colepsy are usually less affected, al
though excessive daytime sleepi
ness is a common symptom. "Con
stant amphetamines are needed to
stay awake. You also have attacks of
muscle tone weakness, cataplexy,
and falls to the ground. Other
symptoms include hallucinations
and automatic behavior, like driving
50 miles past your home without
realizing it. We think all these are

due to pathological manifestations
of sleep."
Medications, often with adverse
side effects, must be taken through a
human narcoleptic's lifetime in order
to fight drowsiness. Emotional ex
periences like laughter or anger are
responsible for attacks in humans,
and Foutz says that most but not all
people who develop narcolepsy first
develop it around puberty.
"Humans have many times been
misdiagnosed," Foutz continued.
"There are often several years bet
ween the onset of symptoms and the
diagnosis. Some people go to
psychiatrists. Some doctors think
they are treating females for the
'nervous housewife syndrome.'
Some people are even treated for
schizophrenia. There is a huge
amount of work to be done on sleep
disorders, because, with few excep
tions, they are not taught in medical
schools."
Since 1973, when research on nar
colepsy in dogs was begun at Stan
ford, Foutz and his colleagues here
have attempted to disseminate their
findings. The American Narcoleptic
Association has helped, Foutz said.
Research information is published
frequently by outside sources, such

as newspapers.
The dogs, found and identified
through medical journals and word
of mouth advertising, are popular
with students who come to pet and
cuddle them.
In fact, in order for the experi
ments to work well, the dogs must
be well-socialized and in good phys
ical health. This requires much
human care and attention. "We
especially try to get high school vol
unteers to come and pet the dogs,"
Foutz said.
"The dogs are very nice," he grin
ned. "Each has a name — some we
give them; some they have when
they come here. They don't appear
to suffer from the narcolepsy. They
don't have jobs to lose or don't have
to deal with the terrible psychologi
cal suffering that humans have."
To eat all 10 pieces of food takes
Zeke exactly four minutes and 11
seconds, compared to the less than
20 seconds a normal dog would take.
As he chomps the last piece, Zeke
sways and then recovers his balance.
The experiment over, Zeke shuffles
around the floor, wide awake now,
hoping for more food, ready for his
next trial run.

This poodle may look collapsed. Actually, Danielle is sleeping
in the researcher's arms. Within seconds, the dog may be
awake again, frolicking about, only to return to the sleep stage
once again.

and Toy Poodles, attacks of nar
colepsy are brouht on by intense
emotional moments.
"In the dogs, all the pleasant emo
tions seem to be the cause of attacks
— eating, playing, having sex,"
Foutz said. "The puppies here are
conceived mostly by artificial in
semination, because the dogs tend
to fall asleep."
Foutz says that humans with nar
colepsy are usually less affected, al
though excessive daytime sleepi
ness is a common symptom. "Con
stant amphetamines are needed to
stay awake. You also have attacks of
muscle tone weakness, cataplexy,
and falls to the ground. Other
symptoms include hallucinations
and automatic behavior, like driving
50 miles past your home without
realizing it. We think all these are

due to pathological manifestations
of sleep."
Medications, often with adverse
side effects, must be taken through a
human narcoleptic's lifetime in order
to fight drowsiness. Emotional ex
periences like laughter or anger are
responsible for attacks in humans,
and Foutz says that most but not all
people who develop narcolepsy first
develop it around puberty.
"Humans have many times been
misdiagnosed," Foutz continued.
"There are often several years bet
ween the onset of symptoms and the
diagnosis. Some people go to
psychiatrists. Some doctors think
they are treating females for the
'nervous housewife syndrome.'
Some people are even treated for
schizophrenia. There is a huge
amount of work to be done on sleep
disorders, because, with few excep
tions, they are not taught in medical
schools."
Since 1973, when research on nar
colepsy in dogs was begun at Stan
ford, Foutz and his colleagues here
have attempted to disseminate their
findings. The American Narcoleptic
Association has helped, Foutz said.
Research information is published
frequently by outside sources, such

as newspapers.
The dogs, found and identified
through medical journals and word
of mouth advertising, are popular
with students who come to pet and
cuddle them.
In fact, in order for the experi
ments to work well, the dogs must
be well-socialized and in good phys
ical health. This requires much
human care and attention. "We
especially try to get high school vol
unteers to come and pet the dogs,"
Foutz said.
"The dogs are very nice," he grin
ned. "Each has a name — some we
give them; some they have when
they come here. They don't appear
to suffer from the narcolepsy. They
don't have jobs to lose or don't have
to deal with the terrible psychologi
cal suffering that humans have."
To eat all 10 pieces of food takes
Zeke exactly four minutes and 11
seconds, compared to the less than
20 seconds a normal dog would take.
As he chomps the last piece, Zeke
sways and then recovers his balance.
The experiment over, Zeke shuffles
around the floor, wide awake now,
hoping for more food, ready for his
next trial run.

This poodle may look collapsed. Actually, Danielle is sleeping
in the researcher's arms. Within seconds, the dog may be
awake again, frolicking about, only to return to the sleep stage
once again.
Dr. Arthur Foutz, a post-doctoral
research fellow at the sleep research
lab here, crouches silently and pas
ses his hand in front of a furry-faced
dog named Zeke. The tick of a stop
watch fills the experimental room.
"See," Foutz whispers. "He can
move his eyes and follow. He is not
asleep." Zeke's eyes gleam. He tries
to raise his head, food from the ex
periment still in his mouth, but his
neck muscles fail. Again he collapses
splay-legged, into what Foutz calls a
cataplexic state, brought on by the
positive emotional stimulus of a
mid-morning treat — in this case, 10
nuggets of beefy dogfood.
Cataplexy is one of the charac
teristic symptoms of narcolepsy, a
sleeping disorder which affects
dogs, ponies, bulls and some 50,000
Americans. Foutz and his lab assis
tants presently conduct experi
ments, like the one in which Zeke is
participating, several times daily on
a colony of 50 dogs, most of whom
are narcoleptic. Studying the dogs
will eventually yield answers to
questions about human narcolepsy,
Foutz said.
"Our goal is to try to find abnor
malities responsible for narcolepsy

— what causes it? There is good evi
dence that in dogs it is hereditary.
We do genetic studies on our colony
of dogs. I think we have found an
excellent mode of human disease in
them. And narcolepsy research can
also help us gather information on
the nature of healthy sleep."

findings. The American Narcoleptic
Association has helped, Foutz said.

The dogs, found and identified
through medical journals and word

with students who come to pet and

In fact, in order for the experi

be well-socialized and in good phys

human care and attention. "We
especially try to get high school vol
unteers to come and pet the dogs,"
Foutz said.
"The dogs are very nice," he grin
ned. "Each has a name — some we
give them; some they have when
they come here. They don't appear
to suffer from the narcolepsy. They
don't have jobs to lose or don't have
to deal with the terrible psychologi
cal suffering that humans have."

awake again, frolicking about, only to return to the sleep stage
once again.
Dr. Arthur Foutz, a post-doctoral
research fellow at the sleep research
lab here, crouches silently and pas
ses his hand in front of a furry-faced
dog named Zeke. The tick of a stop
watch fills the experimental room.
"See," Foutz whispers. "He can
move his eyes and follow. He is not
asleep." Zeke's eyes gleam. He tries
to raise his head, food from the ex
periment still in his mouth, but his
neck muscles fail. Again he collapses
splay-legged, into what Foutz calls a
cataplexic state, brought on by the
positive emotional stimulus of a
mid-morning treat — in this case, 10
nuggets of beefy dogfood.
Cataplexy is one of the charac
teristic symptoms of narcolepsy, a
sleeping disorder which affects
dogs, ponies, bulls and some 50,000
Americans. Foutz and his lab assis
tants presently conduct experi
ments, like the one in which Zeke is
participating, several times daily on
a colony of 50 dogs, most of whom
are narcoleptic. Studying the dogs
will eventually yield answers to
questions about human narcolepsy,
Foutz said.
"Our goal is to try to find abnor
malities responsible for narcolepsy

— what causes it? There is good evi
dence that in dogs it is hereditary.
We do genetic studies on our colony
of dogs. I think we have found an
excellent mode of human disease in
them. And narcolepsy research can
also help us gather information on
the nature of healthy sleep."
For Zeke, a two-year-old wire
haired griffin, and the rest of his
canine friends, mostly Dobermans
and Toy Poodles, attacks of nar
colepsy are brouht on by intense
emotional moments.
"In the dogs, all the pleasant emo
tions seem to be the cause of attacks
— eating, playing, having sex,"
Foutz said. "The puppies here are
conceived mostly by artificial in
semination, because the dogs tend
to fall asleep."
Foutz says that humans with nar
colepsy are usually less affected, al
though excessive daytime sleepi
ness is a common symptom. "Con
stant amphetamines are needed to
stay awake. You also have attacks of
muscle tone weakness, cataplexy,
and falls to the ground. Other
symptoms include hallucinations
and automatic behavior, like driving
50 miles past your home without
realizing it. We think all these are

due to pathological manifestations
of sleep."
Medications, often with adverse
side effects, must be taken through a
human narcoleptic's lifetime in order
to fight drowsiness. Emotional ex
periences like laughter or anger are
responsible for attacks in humans,
and Foutz says that most but not all
people who develop narcolepsy first
develop it around puberty.
"Humans have many times been
misdiagnosed," Foutz continued.
"There are often several years bet
ween the onset of symptoms and the
diagnosis. Some people go to
psychiatrists. Some doctors think
they are treating females for the
'nervous housewife syndrome.'
Some people are even treated for
schizophrenia. There is a huge
amount of work to be done on sleep
disorders, because, with few excep
tions, they are not taught in medical
schools."
Since 1973, when research on nar
colepsy in dogs was begun at Stan
ford, Foutz and his colleagues here
have attempted to disseminate their
findings. The American Narcoleptic
Association has helped, Foutz said.
