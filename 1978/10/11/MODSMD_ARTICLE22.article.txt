# The 						University Board of Trustees
## Do you know what they do? 
### ANNE BOWDEN 
"They control anything that
has to do with Stanford," Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the pres
ident for trustee affairs, said.
"The Board of Trustees is in
charge."
Every year here, students
hear phrases such as "will be
sent to the board for approval"
or "has been approved by the
board and will now be im
plemented." The phrases refer
to investment policies, new
dormitory possibilities or
proxy vote discussions. The
University Board of Trustees
performs many specific duties
and is ultimately responsible
for determining the goals and
policies of the University.
According to President
Richard Lyman, the board ap
proves hiring and firing deci

sions, approves the construc
tion of buildings, approves
academic appointments and
determines major changes in
the academic direction of the
University. They also approve
tiie University budget.
Changes in the tuition rate are
made by the board. If a new
library is to be built, the board
determines the size and uses of
that library.

"The trustees keep the Uni
versity from running off the
rails. Their major concern is to
hold the University in trust.
They are ultimately responsi
ble for it remaining. They have
the ultimate responsibility for
just about anything," Lyman
said.
Matters of concern to the
University community reach
the board only after thorough

research by board committees.
Four trustee committees make
recommendations to the
board. These committees in
clude investment, financial de
velopment, land and buildings
and academic affairs. Prior to
each of the nine annual board
meetings, committees
examine issues relevant to
their interest.
"By the timean issue reaches
the trustees' meeting, it has
been ironed out through and
through and undergone a tre
mendous amount of review,"
Scott Pearson, member of the
trustee committee for land and
buildings, said.
At each meeting, commit
tees deliver their recommen
dations on specific issues to
the full board. If the board ap
proves, these recommenda
tions are then implemented.
Board agenda
The board agenda is deter
mined bv Lyman and the vice
presidents and their staffs be
fore each meeting. The vast
majority of issues have been
discussed in committee prior
to the meeting, Lyman said.
"But it is not unusual that we
will send something back to
committee to be reexamined,"
Lyman said.
The board is composed of 33
members. The Stanford
Alumni Association elects four
trustees every two years, for a
total of eight elected members.
Each of these members serves

a four-year term. The Univer
sity president is automatically
appointed to the board.
The remaining members of
the board are filled by the
board itself. A nominating
committee recommends pos
sible candidates for any vacant
positions and those approved
serve five-year terms.
Student input
Though students and faculty
may not serve on the full
board, they may secure posi
tions on board committees,
Pearson said. Still, all board
meetings are closed to all but
the board members.
"If enough students work to
get an item on the agenda,
board members will consider
it," Bob Rozensweig, vice pres
ident for public affairs, said.
Letters also play a part in the
deliberation of issues, he ad
ded.
"But student protests are not
terriby influential. Special pro
tests increase polarization
rather than communication,"
he said.
Trustees welcome written or
verbal comment to board
members, Lyman said. Issues
will then be passed to an ap
propriate board committee.
"It's true that the trustees are
very busy people. But we all
have a sincere interest in help
ing Stanford to stay on top. We
want to know the public opin
ion on issues before us," Pear
son said.

the ultimate responsibility for
just about anything," Lyman
said.
Matters of concern to the
University community reach
the board only after thorough

research by board committees.
Four trustee committees make
recommendations to the
board. These committees in
clude investment, financial de
velopment, land and buildings
and academic affairs. Prior to
each of the nine annual board
meetings, committees
examine issues relevant to
their interest.
"By the timean issue reaches
the trustees' meeting, it has
been ironed out through and
through and undergone a tre
mendous amount of review,"
Scott Pearson, member of the
trustee committee for land and
buildings, said.
At each meeting, commit
tees deliver their recommen
dations on specific issues to
the full board. If the board ap
proves, these recommenda
tions are then implemented.
Board agenda
The board agenda is deter
mined bv Lyman and the vice
presidents and their staffs be
fore each meeting. The vast
majority of issues have been
discussed in committee prior
to the meeting, Lyman said.
"But it is not unusual that we
will send something back to
committee to be reexamined,"
Lyman said.
The board is composed of 33
members. The Stanford
Alumni Association elects four
trustees every two years, for a
total of eight elected members.
Each of these members serves

a four-year term. The Univer
sity president is automatically
appointed to the board.
The remaining members of
the board are filled by the
board itself. A nominating
committee recommends pos
sible candidates for any vacant
positions and those approved
serve five-year terms.
Student input
Though students and faculty
may not serve on the full
board, they may secure posi
tions on board committees,
Pearson said. Still, all board
meetings are closed to all but
the board members.
"If enough students work to
get an item on the agenda,
board members will consider
it," Bob Rozensweig, vice pres
ident for public affairs, said.
Letters also play a part in the
deliberation of issues, he ad
ded.
"But student protests are not
terriby influential. Special pro
tests increase polarization
rather than communication,"
he said.
Trustees welcome written or
verbal comment to board
members, Lyman said. Issues
will then be passed to an ap
propriate board committee.
"It's true that the trustees are
very busy people. But we all
have a sincere interest in help
ing Stanford to stay on top. We
want to know the public opin
ion on issues before us," Pear
son said.
"They control anything that
has to do with Stanford," Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the pres
ident for trustee affairs, said.
"The Board of Trustees is in
charge."
Every year here, students
hear phrases such as "will be
sent to the board for approval"
or "has been approved by the
board and will now be im
plemented." The phrases refer
to investment policies, new
dormitory possibilities or
proxy vote discussions. The
University Board of Trustees
performs many specific duties
and is ultimately responsible
for determining the goals and
policies of the University.
According to President
Richard Lyman, the board ap
proves hiring and firing deci

sions, approves the construc
tion of buildings, approves
academic appointments and
determines major changes in
the academic direction of the
University. They also approve
tiie University budget.
Changes in the tuition rate are
made by the board. If a new
library is to be built, the board
determines the size and uses of
that library.

"The trustees keep the Uni
versity from running off the
rails. Their major concern is to
hold the University in trust.
