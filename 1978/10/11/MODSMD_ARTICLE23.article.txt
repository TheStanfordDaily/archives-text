# Mendicants continue to 'sing out'
## 
### KRISAN FROELICH 
A mendicant is a practicing beggar or
one who lives by alms, but the Mendicant
group here is more than that. Mendicants
are also "men of song."
The Mendicants of Stanford are a di
verse group of 16 male singers. Their re
pertoire carries a wide variety of music.
During concerts, they perform numbers in
styles ranging from jazz to barbershop to
Beatles to spirituals. About five members
from each class belong to the group, in
cluding one graduate student, Tom Woo,
the director. As Dick Butterfield, one of
the Mendicants' business managers,
stated, "We're just a bunch of fellers hav
ing a great time."
Totally self-supporting, the Mendicants
offer a lively alternative to the usual choral
group. The other business manager, Scott
Hanley, explained, "The only way we're
tied to the University is that we're all stu
dents." All decisions come up for group
vote. Even the director, elected by all the
members of the group, doesn't make final
decisions. Tom Woo, this year's director
or "pitchpipe," describes his job as
"something akin to being an RA."
Mendicants choose their own songs, ar
range their own music and manage their
own concerts.
Bob Larson, the financial manager for
the Mendicants, views this autonomy as
the key to the group. All the members
work together toward a "central theme."
Striving for a "high quality of music and an
exhilaration through song," their success
"depends on group participation. Men
dicants are Mendicants. No one else can

tell uswhatweshouldand should not do,"
Larson said.
One of the consequences of being self
supporting, is that the ensemble supports
itself financially. Traditionally, they raise
their funds through the production of re
cord albums. They made their first album
in 1963 and have tentative plans for the
release of their ninth album this year.
Financing the recording through personal
donations and alumni concerts, the group
always earns back the money invested for
production of the record. To market the
record, they set up a stand in White Plaza
and play the record over a stereo. They use
only "word of mouth publicity" yet the
records have traditionally sold well. This
year the group will probably release its
new album in May or June. The albums, all
titled The Mendicants, have one
trademark. The cover from the previous
album always appears somewhere on the
cover of the new one.
The Mendicants were formed 16 years
ago by Hank Adams, who came to Stanford
after leaving Yale University. The Mendic
ants gave their first concert in Branner as
"an incentive to get the Mendicants work
and come to rehearsals," Woo said. The
group appeared in the dorm at dinner,
"completely unannounced. There was a
lot of giggling and pointing at first. Appa
rently some of the girls thought Toyon was
playing a joke on Branner. But when the
group started singing, there was sudden
silence and awe. The novelty of informal
male singing must have flabbergasted the
women. (Branner was a women's dorm
then.) Of course, the sound must have

been nice, too," Butterfield added.
The Mendicants' image has changed
greatly over the years. The group was orig
inally founded in the "Eastern tradition"
and performed strictly in a coat and tie.
Most of their songs were taken from the
Yale Blue Book. The suit image faded away
by the early 70s and today they wear
"whatever they happen to have ori at the
time. As far as presentation goes, the
Mendicants are basically the same now as
they were in 1963." However, in the 1966-
67 group; Director Errol Cay decided to
add some choreography to the group to
make them more "show-bizzy." They
were supposed to end performances on
bended knee with arms outstretched.
Usually they fell over, however.
Student responses to the group have
remained strong. By their second year, a
sizeable group auditioned to join the
group. Numbers dwindled in the early '70s
but now have picked up. This year they
had 42 people audition for five places.
The Mendicants will be performing sev
eral concerts during the year, including a
few free dorm concerts. They have tenta
tive plans for a tour of the East Coast, in
cluding probable concerts at Harvard,
Princeton and Amherst. However, the
highlight of the year for the group is the
annual spring concert at Memorial
Church. The spring concert gives the
"Mendicant junkies" a chance to hear sin
gers in a good accoustical setting, and the
Mendicant alums a chance to sing again.
Altlms are always welcome. As Mike
McMartin, concert manager, explained,
"Once a Mendicant, always a Mendicant."

in 1963 and have tentative plans for the
release of their ninth album this year.
Financing the recording through personal
donations and alumni concerts, the group
always earns back the money invested for
production of the record. To market the
record, they set up a stand in White Plaza
and play the record over a stereo. They use
only "word of mouth publicity" yet the
records have traditionally sold well. This
year the group will probably release its
new album in May or June. The albums, all
titled The Mendicants, have one
trademark. The cover from the previous
album always appears somewhere on the
cover of the new one.
The Mendicants were formed 16 years
ago by Hank Adams, who came to Stanford
after leaving Yale University. The Mendic
ants gave their first concert in Branner as
"an incentive to get the Mendicants work
and come to rehearsals," Woo said. The
group appeared in the dorm at dinner,
"completely unannounced. There was a
lot of giggling and pointing at first. Appa
rently some of the girls thought Toyon was
playing a joke on Branner. But when the
group started singing, there was sudden
silence and awe. The novelty of informal
male singing must have flabbergasted the
women. (Branner was a women's dorm
then.) Of course, the sound must have

been nice, too," Butterfield added.
The Mendicants' image has changed
greatly over the years. The group was orig
inally founded in the "Eastern tradition"
and performed strictly in a coat and tie.
Most of their songs were taken from the
Yale Blue Book. The suit image faded away
by the early 70s and today they wear
"whatever they happen to have ori at the
time. As far as presentation goes, the
Mendicants are basically the same now as
they were in 1963." However, in the 1966-
67 group; Director Errol Cay decided to
add some choreography to the group to
make them more "show-bizzy." They
were supposed to end performances on
bended knee with arms outstretched.
Usually they fell over, however.
Student responses to the group have
remained strong. By their second year, a
sizeable group auditioned to join the
group. Numbers dwindled in the early '70s
but now have picked up. This year they
had 42 people audition for five places.
The Mendicants will be performing sev
eral concerts during the year, including a
few free dorm concerts. They have tenta
tive plans for a tour of the East Coast, in
cluding probable concerts at Harvard,
Princeton and Amherst. However, the
highlight of the year for the group is the
annual spring concert at Memorial
Church. The spring concert gives the
"Mendicant junkies" a chance to hear sin
gers in a good accoustical setting, and the
Mendicant alums a chance to sing again.
Altlms are always welcome. As Mike
McMartin, concert manager, explained,
"Once a Mendicant, always a Mendicant."

The Mendicants, a barbershop-jazz -spiritual group of male singers here practices before "making the
rounds" at freshman dorms last week.
A mendicant is a practicing beggar or
one who lives by alms, but the Mendicant
group here is more than that. Mendicants
are also "men of song."
The Mendicants of Stanford are a di
verse group of 16 male singers. Their re
pertoire carries a wide variety of music.
During concerts, they perform numbers in
styles ranging from jazz to barbershop to
Beatles to spirituals. About five members
from each class belong to the group, in
cluding one graduate student, Tom Woo,
the director. As Dick Butterfield, one of
the Mendicants' business managers,
stated, "We're just a bunch of fellers hav
ing a great time."
Totally self-supporting, the Mendicants
offer a lively alternative to the usual choral
group. The other business manager, Scott
Hanley, explained, "The only way we're
tied to the University is that we're all stu
dents." All decisions come up for group
vote. Even the director, elected by all the
members of the group, doesn't make final
decisions. Tom Woo, this year's director
or "pitchpipe," describes his job as
"something akin to being an RA."
Mendicants choose their own songs, ar
range their own music and manage their
own concerts.
Bob Larson, the financial manager for
the Mendicants, views this autonomy as
the key to the group. All the members
work together toward a "central theme."
Striving for a "high quality of music and an
exhilaration through song," their success
"depends on group participation. Men
dicants are Mendicants. No one else can

tell uswhatweshouldand should not do,"
Larson said.
One of the consequences of being self
supporting, is that the ensemble supports
itself financially. Traditionally, they raise
their funds through the production of re
cord albums. They made their first album
in 1963 and have tentative plans for the
release of their ninth album this year.

67 group; Director Errol Cay decided to
add some choreography to the group to
make them more "show-bizzy." They
were supposed to end performances on
bended knee with arms outstretched.
Usually they fell over, however.
Student responses to the group have
remained strong. By their second year, a
sizeable group auditioned to join the
group. Numbers dwindled in the early '70s
but now have picked up. This year they
had 42 people audition for five places.
The Mendicants will be performing sev
eral concerts during the year, including a
few free dorm concerts. They have tenta
tive plans for a tour of the East Coast, in
cluding probable concerts at Harvard,
Princeton and Amherst. However, the
highlight of the year for the group is the
annual spring concert at Memorial
Church. The spring concert gives the
"Mendicant junkies" a chance to hear sin
gers in a good accoustical setting, and the
Mendicant alums a chance to sing again.
Altlms are always welcome. As Mike
McMartin, concert manager, explained,
"Once a Mendicant, always a Mendicant."

The Mendicants, a barbershop-jazz -spiritual group of male singers here practices before "making the
rounds" at freshman dorms last week.
A mendicant is a practicing beggar or
one who lives by alms, but the Mendicant
group here is more than that. Mendicants
are also "men of song."
The Mendicants of Stanford are a di
verse group of 16 male singers. Their re
pertoire carries a wide variety of music.
During concerts, they perform numbers in
styles ranging from jazz to barbershop to
Beatles to spirituals. About five members
from each class belong to the group, in
cluding one graduate student, Tom Woo,
the director. As Dick Butterfield, one of
the Mendicants' business managers,
stated, "We're just a bunch of fellers hav
ing a great time."
Totally self-supporting, the Mendicants
offer a lively alternative to the usual choral
group. The other business manager, Scott
Hanley, explained, "The only way we're
tied to the University is that we're all stu
dents." All decisions come up for group
vote. Even the director, elected by all the
members of the group, doesn't make final
decisions. Tom Woo, this year's director
or "pitchpipe," describes his job as
"something akin to being an RA."
Mendicants choose their own songs, ar
range their own music and manage their
own concerts.
Bob Larson, the financial manager for
the Mendicants, views this autonomy as
the key to the group. All the members
work together toward a "central theme."
Striving for a "high quality of music and an
exhilaration through song," their success
"depends on group participation. Men
dicants are Mendicants. No one else can

tell uswhatweshouldand should not do,"
Larson said.
One of the consequences of being self
supporting, is that the ensemble supports
itself financially. Traditionally, they raise
their funds through the production of re
cord albums. They made their first album
in 1963 and have tentative plans for the
release of their ninth album this year.
Financing the recording through personal
donations and alumni concerts, the group
always earns back the money invested for
production of the record. To market the
record, they set up a stand in White Plaza
and play the record over a stereo. They use
only "word of mouth publicity" yet the
records have traditionally sold well. This
year the group will probably release its
new album in May or June. The albums, all
titled The Mendicants, have one
trademark. The cover from the previous
album always appears somewhere on the
cover of the new one.
The Mendicants were formed 16 years
ago by Hank Adams, who came to Stanford
after leaving Yale University. The Mendic
ants gave their first concert in Branner as
"an incentive to get the Mendicants work
and come to rehearsals," Woo said. The
group appeared in the dorm at dinner,
"completely unannounced. There was a
lot of giggling and pointing at first. Appa
rently some of the girls thought Toyon was
playing a joke on Branner. But when the
group started singing, there was sudden
silence and awe. The novelty of informal
male singing must have flabbergasted the
women. (Branner was a women's dorm
then.) Of course, the sound must have

been nice, too," Butterfield added.
The Mendicants' image has changed
greatly over the years. The group was orig
inally founded in the "Eastern tradition"
and performed strictly in a coat and tie.
Most of their songs were taken from the
Yale Blue Book. The suit image faded away
by the early 70s and today they wear
"whatever they happen to have ori at the
time. As far as presentation goes, the
Mendicants are basically the same now as
they were in 1963." However, in the 1966-
67 group; Director Errol Cay decided to
add some choreography to the group to
make them more "show-bizzy." They
were supposed to end performances on
bended knee with arms outstretched.

Student responses to the group have
