# Second-half surge beats Hayward, 2-1
## Delgado goal ignites booters

Hayward — Stanford's explosion for two
goals in less than one minute pulled out a
victory over the hosting Hayward State
Pioneers. The Cardinals' pair of scores
came within the first six minutes of the
second half and erased a 1-0 Hayward lead.
The win raises Stanford's record to 8-1
and 16-3-1 since the team began its up
surge prior to midseason last year. The
team is now ranked 13th in the Far West
region.
As in four previous games this season,
the Cards had to come from behind to
chalk up their victory. This time the
Pioneers scored 20 minutes into the game
on a kick by Steve Biddle. Hayward held
that lead for half an hour until Greg De
lgado took a Ted Rafalovich pass in for a
goal.
Before Hayward could recover, senior
midfielder Laird Cagan registered the tie

breaking shot, the Cards protecting that
margin for the remaining 39 minutes.
Based on his observations during the
first half, Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge emphasized the passing game to
pierce the Pioneer defense.
"They were a strong team basically and
we played them really wrong the first
half," Lodge said. "They were a little bit
stronger defensively than I thought they
would be. It was obvious to me that the
way to beat them was to go with the drib
ble and the give and go."
The soccer team's usual second-half
showing saved the Cards' from defeat, but
similar intensity will have to be maintained
for a full 90 minutes if there's to be consid
eration for post-season competition.
"We haven't played a first half all sea
son," said assistant coach Phil Wright. "It's
amazing to be 9-1 (including the alumni
match-up) with no first halves — it's like

wasting half your season. They're not
going to get away with it against teams like
UCLA and San Francisco.
"We have to put full games together,"
Wright added. "But at least we've put a
good second half together and we've done
that consistently. I hope that they come to
the typical Stanford mentality which is in
the big games to put the whole thing to
gether."
"We have a lot of confidence in ourse
lves," two-year letterman Jon Hecht said.
"I think last year when we got behind we
tended to panic and it was reflected in our
play. This year when we get down, we're
confident that we can come back. That's
why we're winning games."
Stanford puts its four-game win streak
on the line against Westmont Friday at 3
p.m. Saturday the Cards host the Univer
sity of Nevada-Reno at 10 a.m. Both games
will be played at Harry Maloney Field.
