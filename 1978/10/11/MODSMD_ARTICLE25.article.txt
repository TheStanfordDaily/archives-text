## Varsity letters Cards' special plan 
### 
Emilie Deutsch

The men that comprise football's special
teams are never the star players. They don't
necessarily run the fastest, hit the hardest or
leap tall buildings in a single bound. But the
qualification "special" that precedes their
classification is a valid label.
The best teams in professional football are
the ones with talented players throughout
their rosters. They provide the top clubs with
special teams that are truly special.
A similar depth of talented players for use
on special teams gave UCLA a 27-26 victory
over Stanford Saturday. Bruin halfback
Theotis Brown ran a Stanford kickoff back 93
yards for a touchdown and prevented Stan
ford from putting the game away in the third
quarter. The Bruins out-punted the Cards by
80 yards, neutralizing the advantage Stanford
had in total offense. While the Bruins en
joyed good field position all night, the Cards
had their back to the goal line throughoutthe
game. The play of the special teams tipped
the outcome in favor of the Bruins.
"The kicking game is one third of a football
game," said Cardinal coach Norb Hecker,
who is in charge of place-kicking.
"Every play in a game is crucial," Hecker
said. "When special teams have center stage,
they've got to perform." What makes things
tough in a game like last weekend's is that, if
they don't perform up to their potential on
the road or injuries weaken their capabilities,
replacements are hard to find.
NCAA regulations allow teams to take only
54 men on the road. At home, there are no
such limitations, so the Cardinals are ninety
men strong at Stanford Stadium. But Satur
day in Los Angeles the Cards were only at 60
percent of home strength.
"It's a real numbers game when you're on
the road," Hecker said. Head coach Bill
Walsh added, "Some players that can really
help us can't travel."
And it's not strategically or medically wise
to use the regular defense and offense units
on special teams. Kick-off coverage team
members practically invite injury by virtue of
their assignments. And special team duty is
very exhausting. Walsh noted that a fatigued
player is even more vulnerable to injury. "But
every player would volunteer," he added.
This week they won't even get the chance
to raise their hands for special team assign

ment. They've already been written into the
script for Saturday's game against
Washington.
Starters Paul Hibler, Dean Wilson and Ken
Margerum, forexample, will be making guest
appearances in special team roles because,
according to Walsh, Stanford needs "bigger
people and more experience inside.'"'
Say goodbye to the isolated moments of
glory for the original special team members.
Walsh is not one to be squeamish about
strengthening a weak point. "When any flaw
becomes apparent, we correct it," said Walsh
in a concise post-loss evaluation. "And this is
correctable." Even if the regulars are fatigued
and filled with misgivings about special team
responsibilities, what needs to be changed,
will be changed.
"We are revamping our approach to the
special teams," Walsh said Monday at a press
luncheon in the City. "Even Cordy Cere
sino," he said, pointing to the bearded
linebacker sitting a short distance away, "will
have to help."
At least the linebacker and the rest of the
new shift on special teams have had a warn
ing. Three years ago when Stanford was at
Washington, James Lofton was a surprise re
cruit for punting duties when Mike Michel,
the regular punter, pulled a muscle with re
serve punter Tom Lynn left at home. Robert
"Spider"Gaines, now the premier receiver in
the conference, blocked two of Lofton's pu nt
attempts. Lofton, now a wide receiver of the
Green Bay Packers, was relieved of punting
duties after aiding and abetting a near loss to
Washington — historical evidence of the lack
of depth that characterizes Stanford teams.
Walsh cited two situations as the basis of
the thin Cardinal line-up. First, "our admis
sion standards are high," he said. "
Second, "we have not had effective recruit
ing previously.
So lack of depth, traveling restrictions and
a sub-par first-half performance in Los
Angeles has precipitated some old faces in
some new positions.
After the UCLA win last Saturday, UCLA's
Brown said confidently that "Stanford can
beat any team on any given day." Perhaps this
Saturday will be the day and the new special
team players will make the difference bet
ween a record of 4-2 and one of 3-3.

their rosters. They provide the top clubs with
special teams that are truly special.
A similar depth of talented players for use
on special teams gave UCLA a 27-26 victory
over Stanford Saturday. Bruin halfback
Theotis Brown ran a Stanford kickoff back 93
yards for a touchdown and prevented Stan
ford from putting the game away in the third
quarter. The Bruins out-punted the Cards by
80 yards, neutralizing the advantage Stanford
had in total offense. While the Bruins en
joyed good field position all night, the Cards
had their back to the goal line throughoutthe
game. The play of the special teams tipped
the outcome in favor of the Bruins.
"The kicking game is one third of a football
game," said Cardinal coach Norb Hecker,
who is in charge of place-kicking.
"Every play in a game is crucial," Hecker
said. "When special teams have center stage,
they've got to perform." What makes things
tough in a game like last weekend's is that, if
they don't perform up to their potential on
the road or injuries weaken their capabilities,
replacements are hard to find.
NCAA regulations allow teams to take only
54 men on the road. At home, there are no
such limitations, so the Cardinals are ninety
men strong at Stanford Stadium. But Satur
day in Los Angeles the Cards were only at 60
percent of home strength.
"It's a real numbers game when you're on
the road," Hecker said. Head coach Bill
Walsh added, "Some players that can really
help us can't travel."
And it's not strategically or medically wise
to use the regular defense and offense units
on special teams. Kick-off coverage team
members practically invite injury by virtue of
their assignments. And special team duty is
very exhausting. Walsh noted that a fatigued
player is even more vulnerable to injury. "But
every player would volunteer," he added.
This week they won't even get the chance
to raise their hands for special team assign

ment. They've already been written into the
script for Saturday's game against
Washington.
Starters Paul Hibler, Dean Wilson and Ken
Margerum, forexample, will be making guest
appearances in special team roles because,
according to Walsh, Stanford needs "bigger
people and more experience inside.'"'
Say goodbye to the isolated moments of
glory for the original special team members.
Walsh is not one to be squeamish about
strengthening a weak point. "When any flaw
becomes apparent, we correct it," said Walsh
in a concise post-loss evaluation. "And this is
correctable." Even if the regulars are fatigued
and filled with misgivings about special team
responsibilities, what needs to be changed,
will be changed.
"We are revamping our approach to the
special teams," Walsh said Monday at a press
luncheon in the City. "Even Cordy Cere
sino," he said, pointing to the bearded
linebacker sitting a short distance away, "will
have to help."
At least the linebacker and the rest of the
new shift on special teams have had a warn
ing. Three years ago when Stanford was at
Washington, James Lofton was a surprise re
cruit for punting duties when Mike Michel,
the regular punter, pulled a muscle with re
serve punter Tom Lynn left at home. Robert
"Spider"Gaines, now the premier receiver in
the conference, blocked two of Lofton's pu nt
attempts. Lofton, now a wide receiver of the
Green Bay Packers, was relieved of punting
duties after aiding and abetting a near loss to
Washington — historical evidence of the lack
of depth that characterizes Stanford teams.
Walsh cited two situations as the basis of
the thin Cardinal line-up. First, "our admis
sion standards are high," he said. "
Second, "we have not had effective recruit
ing previously.
So lack of depth, traveling restrictions and
a sub-par first-half performance in Los
Angeles has precipitated some old faces in
some new positions.
After the UCLA win last Saturday, UCLA's
Brown said confidently that "Stanford can
beat any team on any given day." Perhaps this
Saturday will be the day and the new special
team players will make the difference bet
ween a record of 4-2 and one of 3-3.
