# Scotchers face UOP in 'must' game
## 
### SHARON SILVERSTEIN 
The Stanford field hockey
team plays a "must win" game
against the University of the
Pacific at Stockton today, Stan
ford hockey coach Barbara
Longstreth said.
"We have to win the rest of
our games to be a strong con
tender for regional selection,"
she said. Saturday's loss to San
Jose State dropped the Cards
to a 1-1 record in league com
petition and a 1-2-2 mark over
all.
"We must maintain that high
level of play we're capable of —
we've got to be consistent,"
assistant coach Lewis Alexan
der said.
The key factor for the Cards

is a productive offense. The
team has scored only six goals
this season.
Longstreth will employ the
same 3-3-3-1 alignment utilized
defensively against San Jose.
She said that the team has
three strong links who are cap
able of generating offense, so
the attack should not be di
minished with only three for
wards.
Beating Pacific offensively
would be advantageous for the
sticksters, who need confi
dence in their scoring ability to
sweep the rest of their
matches. Pacific lost decisively
to San Jose and California, two
conference foes who appear to
be Stanford's main roadblock
to post-season play.
