### RICK OSTILLER 
A shortage of football offi
cials has marked the opening
week of intramural sports for
autumn quarter.
Officials need not have any
previous experience and will
be paid $3.05 per game. All
those interested should go to
the IM Office (Room 354 En
cina) or call the office before
5:30 p.m. at 497-1081.

Excess demand for two
person volleyball participation
forced the formation of a wait
ing list earlier this quarter.
Since it appeared few teams
were going to drop out of the
competition, IM Director
Howie Dallmar has announced
a remedy for those still waiting.
"Since all the leagues are fil
led, we have decided to form
an elimination tournament for
those teams that have re
mained on the waiting list,"
Dallmar said. "A limited
number of teams will be
selected for the regular league
playoffs when the tournament
concludes."
The volleyball elimination
tournament chart, as well as
the charts for tournaments in
all other autumn sports except
football, are posted outside
the IM Office. Teams must
check the charts soon since
deadlines will be enforced and
some first-round deadlines are
Friday.
