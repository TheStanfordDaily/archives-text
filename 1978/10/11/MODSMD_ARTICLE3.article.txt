### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
Stanford University Clinics anticipates a $852,000 de
ficit this coming year, according to its new budget ap
proved at a Board of Trustees meeting yesterday.
fne board, meeting in San Francisco, also approved a
$102 million budget for the Stanford University Hospital
and a $2.2 million library addition at the Graduate School
of Business (CSB), and heard a comparative report of
gifts received last year by seven major private univer
sities.
A change in federal regulations which "negates the
ability to continue to collect cost recovery" for Medicare
will contribute to financial woes at the clinics in the
coming year. The new budget, including expenditures
of over $18.8 million, will show a deficit for the first time
in at least five years.
In the past, Medicare and MediCal cost recovery has
meant as much as $2.5 million in revenue for the clinics.
The regulation changes eliminate that income. As a re
sult, net income projections of $3.6 million for last year
were revised down to $219,000.
Clinic administrators have planned some adjustments
to the proposed budget which could reduce the deficit
figure to $75,000, but the $777,000 in adjustments means
measures such as freezing vacant positions, achieving
lower levels of courtesy discounts and reducing physi
cians' specialists will be necessary, according to a trus
tee background report.
The University Hospital, however, is projected to have
a $4 million surplus in the coming year, compared with a
projected $2.1 million surplus last yea--. The total budget
of $102 million is an 11.5 percent increase over last year,
in spite of a projected 2.1 percent reduction in Hospital
census.
In other trustee business, the board gave final ap
proval to the second phase of the Jackson Library Expan
sion project at the CSB. The $2.2 million project will add

a third floor to the library.
The $488,000 first phase of the project is presently
underway.
Finally, the board was told that the University col
lected some $54.6 million in gifts last year, the second
highest in the University's history.
The figure represents a $1.6 million drop from the
record gift level the previous year.
Administration officials expected a drop, however,
since 1976-77 included the final year of the $300 million
Campaign for Stanford and last year did not.
Most officials felt the $54.6 million level was an out
standing gift performance. Following the end of the
Campaign in April 1977, administrators stated that main
taining a gift level over $50 million per year was neces
sary to meet budget requirements. They also said main
taining the level would not be easy.
Vice President for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
said some $18 million of the total for last year rep
resented pledge payments from the Campaign. He said
an additional $8 million was received iri new pledges,
but the year represented "a $10 million reduction in the
pledge pipeline."
Vice President for Development joel Smith confirmed
the figures, but said the lower level of new pledges is
"not necessarily bad news." He said there is a big push
for pledges during a campaign which does not occur
once a campaign is over.
Smith presented a report to trustees which shows the
University ranks second among seven private institu
tions nationwide in gift receipts. The names of the six
other universities was not released, but they are known
to be institutions commonly compared with the Univer
sity.
The report states that gift levels among the seven
ranged from $22.3 million to $63.6 million. It also stated
that five- and ten-year gift totals show the University also
ranked second, with a five-year total of $239.3 million
and a ten-year total of $390.7 million.
