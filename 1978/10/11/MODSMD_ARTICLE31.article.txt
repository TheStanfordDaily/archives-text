# Legalized gambling, wine selling
## Election issues vary in states 
### 
New York (AP) — Should
casino gambling be legalized in
Florida?
Should Rhode Island spend
$4.3 million to finance en
gineering studies for construc
tion of a reservoir?
Should Montana grocery
stores be allowed to sell wine?
These are some of the ques
tions voters will answer in the
general election next month.
An Associated Press survey of
the 50 states found more than
200 constitutional amend
ments, initiatives, referenda
and other proposals on the bal
lots in 38 states.
The most controversial and
highly publicized issues center
on tax money — how it should
be raised and how it should be
spent. Major proposals affect
ing taxes or spending are
under consideration in 16
states. Most are the result of
petition drives similar to the
one that led to the passage of
Proposition 13 cutting property
taxes 57 percent in California.
Most are given a good chance
of success.
The tax and spending ques
tions, however, are far out
numbered by other issues in
volving everything from sex to
schools.
Key questions
Here is a look at some of the
key questions:
Of nine proposals on the
Florida ballot, the one that has
drawn the most controversy is
the result of an initiative drive
to legalize casino gambling
along a 21-mile strip of Miami
Beach. Opponents, including
Gov. Reubin Askew, bankers
and several of the state's major
newspapers, say gambling
would only aid organized
crime.
Supporters, led by a group
called "Let's Help Florida," say
gambling would provide re
venue for schools and local law
enforcement agencies. Prop
osals to legalize jai alai and
pari-mutual horse race betting
are on the ballot in New Jersey
and Virginia respectively.
Most of the 11 questions on
Rhode Island's ballot involve
bond issues, and Leonard F.
Clingham, counsel for the sec
retary of state, says:"I don't
think any of them are going to
pass. In this era of Proposition
13, people won't vote for any
thing that costs money." One
exception, he says, may be a
$2.4 million proposal to im
prove state parks, because,
"People are ecology and lei
sure minded."
Sell wine
The Montana measure to
allow grocery and drug stores
to sell wine is given a good
chance of passage. At the same
time, the state's voters, who
will be faced with 11 ballot
questions on Nov. 7, are ex
pected to approve a proposal
to raise the legal drinking age
from 18 to 19. Supporters say
the boost is needed to cut
down alcohol-related acci
dents involving high school

students and other youngsters.
Michigan voters also will
consider raising the drinking
age — from 18 to 21. The ques
tion is one of 11 ballot propos
als, including three involving
taxes and spending. The
money issue with the best
chance of winning would limit
increases to state spending and
taxing and would require voter
approval of any local tax hikes
greater than the rate of infla
tion.
The second would cut prop
erty taxes in half and boost the
state income tax to make up
the difference. The third would
ban use of property taxes as a
source of funds for education.
It would require the state to
come up with a new system of
financing under which parents
would be given "vouchers" to
pay for their children's educa
tion at the school of their
choice, public or private.
Equality for women
Equality for women is an
issue in two states, neither of
which has passed the prop
osed Equal Rights Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution. In
Nevada, where lawmakers
have rejected the ERA three
times in the past, the six ballot
questions include a non
binding advisory vote to help
the legislature make up its
mind when it considers the
amendment again next year.
In Florida, meanwhile, resi
dents will vote on a proposed
"Declaration of Rights on Sex,"
which would expand the
state's Bill of Rights to prohibit
discrimination because of sex.
Homosexual rights are an
issue in California where there
are eight questions on the bal
lot, five placed there by the
legislature and three resulting
from petition drives. One in
itiative would allow school dis
tricts to fire or refuse to hire
teachers for public homosex
ual acts, including promoting

homosexual activity. Polls in
dicate the measure will pass.
Ban smoking
Another controversial initia
tive, given an even chance of
victory, would require special
no-smoking sections in many
public places and ban smoking
entirely in others.
Proposals involving bever
age containers will be before
the voters in Nebraska and
Alaska. The Nebraska measure
would impose a mandatory
five-cent deposit on all sepa
rate, sealed glass, metal or
plastic bottles, cans, jars or car
tons containing beer or soft
drinks.
A recent poll showed 61 per
cent of those questioned fa
vored the measure, a decline
of four percentage points from
an earlier survey. The Alaska
measure — which is not given a
good chance of passage —
would outlaw all throw-away
bottles and cans.
The 12 states without state
wide proposals are: Connec
ticut, Delaware, Kansas, Min
nesota, New York, Tennessee,
Utah, North Carolina, Ken
tucky, Louisiana, Pennsylvania
and Vermont.
The 16 states with tax or
spending proposals are:
arizona, Arkansas, Missouri,
Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Neb
raska, Massachusetts, Nevada,
North Dakota, Oregon,
Alabama, South Dakota, Texas
and Michigan.
Some ballot questions ac
ross the country deal with
technical or administrative
matters. Others are designed
to remove outdated laws. In
Nevada, for example, one
would delete a constitutional
prohibition on duelers hold
ing office; in Mississippi, the
six proposed constitutional
amendments include eliminat
ing a requirement that rail
roads pass within three miles
of the county seat.
