Carter may veto tax-cut bill
Washington — The Senate passed a $29.3 billion
tax-cut bill yesterday that was bloated so far above
the level recommended by President )immy Carter
that he threatened to veto it.
The measure, approved 86-4, includes reduc
tions for virtually all individuals, with benefits
tilted toward those with incomes under $50,000 a
year. In addition, it contains major tax cuts for
investors, which the Senate refused by a lopsided
margin to scale down, and for businesses.
The Senate bill would give a $266 tax cut to a
typical four-member family with a $20,000 income
and deductions totaling 23 percent of income. The
House bill would give the same family a $146 tax
break. A single person earning $20,000 would
realize a $114 tax reduction, or $9 more than in the
House bill.
Carter told a news conference he would not
hesitate to veto a tax cut if he thought it too expen
sive or failed to meet the basic criteria of simplic
ity, fairness and equitability.
Carter told a nationally broadcast news confer
ence he will meet today at the White House with
Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) and Rep. Al Ullman (D-
Ore.), the heads of the tax-writing committees, to
try to work out a compromise he can sign.
"Hopefully, the three of us can agree on an
acceptable package," the president said.
Rhodesia to alter racial laws
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesia's interim gov
ernment announced plans yesterday to strike
down segregation laws, clearing the way forblacks
to live in white neighborhoods, attend white
schools and use white hospitals — if they can af
ford it.
The proposed changes must still be acted upon
by Parliament, and there were reports it might be
called into special session.
The proposals were lauded by the biracial gov
ernment as a significant breakthrough despite the
fact that only the wealthiest of the nation's 6.7
million blacks will be able to afford the integra
tion.
The announcement was made as white Prime
Minister lan Smith and black leader the Rev.
Ndabaningi Sithole were in the United States seek
ing backing for their internal government, set up
to pave the way to black majority rule with elec
tions. Smith reported no headway in the quest.
Tiny right-wing white political parties were furi
ous about the proposals. "This means the surren
der and destruction of the white man and his in
stitutions in Rhodesia and a victory for the ter
rorists," said Rhodesia National Party president
Len Idenson.
Short-circuit threatens satellite
Pasadena — NASA engineers were trying franti
cally yesterday to discover why a $75 million satel
lite launched just 3Vi months ago went suddenly

silent, threatening an ambitious study of the
world's oceans.
NASA spokesmen said there's no danger the
5050-pound Seasat-A satellite might fall from its
500-mile-high orbit and crash back to earth.
But they agreed the mission — the most com
prehensive study ever undertaken of the forces
that drive the world's oceans — faces an early
death if communication cannot be reestablished.
The satellite stopped sending radio signals
shortly before midnight Monday while it was pas
sing over a tracking station in Australia.
According to Bristow, the problems developed
without warning. Early indications are that a
short-circuit drained the spacecraft's batteries fas
ter than the banks of solar collectors could re
charge them, leaving Seasat without electricity to
run its computers, sensors and transmitters.
New rules out on food stamps
Washington — About 400,670 households will be
scratched from the food-stamp rolls during the
first four months of next year as new regulations
take effect, the Agriculture Department said yes
terday.
But slightly higher benefits are in store for most
of the 4.38 million families remaining and for the
thousands of elderly poor couples and other
families expected to be attracted to the stream
lined program.
The major change in the new rules is an end to
the requirement that poor families buy their food
stamps. There also are tighter eligibility standards
and a requirement that many adult recipients look
for work.
Under the present rules, a four-person family
with monthly income of $250 after a series of de
ductions must come up with $71 in cash to get an
allotment of $182 in coupons that can be re
deemed for groceries.
Under the new rules, the same family would get
$111 in coupons but not have to pay anything,
assuming its adjusted income were the same.
Carter signs Uganda embargo
Washington — President Jimmy Carter yesterday
signed into law legislation imposing a total and
mandatory trade embargo against Uganda.
The embargo is aimed chiefly at cutting off
purchases by U.S. companies of Ugandan coffee,
Uganda's chief cash crop and a bulwark of the
regime of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.
"By cutting off coffee sales and hence his supply
of money, we can disrupt the award system on
which Amin depends to keep his troops' loyalty,"
said Sen. Lowell Weicker, a principal sponsor of
the embargo amendment which was approved by
Congress several days ago.
New $1 coin pictures woman
Washington — President )immy Carter signed a
bill yesterday authorizing the minting of a new $1

coin bearing the image of suffragist Susan B. An
thony, the first time an American woman has ap
peared on a coin.
"The Anthony dollar will symbolize for all
American women the achievement of their una
lienable right to vote," Carter said in a statement,
referring to Anthony's turn-of-the-century drive
that eventually gave women the right to vote.
The coin, which will replace the larger
Eisenhower dollar now in circulation, will feature
the Apollo II moon landing on the opposite side.
Some 500 million Anthony dollars are expected
to be produced before the coins are issued by the
Treasury in 1979. The department estimates it will
save $17 million annually by having the coin re
place some paper dollars, which are easily worn
out.
Reporter jailed for contempt
Hackensack, N.|. — New York Times reporter
Myron Farber refused again yesterday to surren
der his files on a murder defendant, and a judge
ordered him to jail tomorrow unless Farber
changes his mind.
Farber has served 27 days for refusing to surren
der his files on Dr. Mario lascalevich, the surgeon
accused of murdering three patients at Riverdell
Hospital in Oradell, N.J., in the mid-19605,
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Friday that
both Farber and the Times are for the time being
subject to whatever penalties Trautwein sees fit to
impose. The high court has yet to consider on its
merits the appeal by Farber and the Times of their
contempt citations.
In Washington, Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.) an
nounced that the Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution will hold hearings early next year on
the subject of protection fora reporter'sconfiden
tial sources.
He said Congress must "resolve to provide a
procedure so that we do not have to rely on the
incarceration of reporters in order to conduct the
judicial business of this country."
