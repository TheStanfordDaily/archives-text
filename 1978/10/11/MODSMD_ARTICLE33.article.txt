# Trustees delegate stock resolutions
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
delegated authority to vote some
controversial stockholder resolu
tions to a select board committee.
The action modified a policy for
dealing with resolutions involving is
sues of social responsibility to give
the so-called ad hoc Subcommittee
on Investment Responsibility (SIR)
the power to vote some proxies
without approval of the entire board.
The resolutions allow the action
only when proxy-voting timetables
do not allow full board considera
tion, according to Robert Hamrdla,
assistant to the president for trustee
affairs.
In the past, the SIR has had its de
liberations and recommendations
subjected to full board scrutiny.
Last spring, when proxies needed
consideration between board meet
ings, the SIR would confer by con
ference telephone call, and its re
commendations would be relayed to
the full board by mailgram.
Trustees could then call in protests
to Board President Peter Bing. Based
on the feelings of the entire board,
Bing would decide how to vote the
proxy.
"In retrospect, the process of
sending a mailgram and inviting
prospective review of the subcom

mittee's actions appears to have
been unduly cumbersome," a trus
tee background report states.
The report states that trustees
were made party to the decision un
less dissent was registered, but that
decisions on the issues were difficult
to "decide upon given the informa
tion available to the mailgram reci
pient.
"Despite being made a party to the
decision, however, trustees not on
the subcommittee had no effective
means of participating in (the deci
sion). In the end, a great deal of time
was spent on the phone recapping
the texture of the subcommittee's
discussions which could not be re
duced to writing rapidly and com
municated by mailgram," the report
states.
Under the new policy, SIR recom
mendations would become the Uni
versity's vote, and full board review
of the issue would be retrospective.
Among issues expected to come
before the SIR are recommendations
from the University's Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
on shareholder proposals dealing
with social issues like corporate in
volvement in South Africa.
No students or faculty will sit on
the SIR because "the feeling is that
student and faculty opinion on the
issues is adequately represented on
the CIR," Rosenzweig said.
