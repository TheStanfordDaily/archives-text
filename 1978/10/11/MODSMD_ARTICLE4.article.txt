Santa Claus. The perfect
grandpa. A cross between a teddy
bear and the Wizard of Oz.
What's going on here? What do
Santa Claus, the perfect grandpa
and a cross between a teddy bear
and the Wizard of Oz have to do
with one another? Not much, re
ally, except that they are all student
descriptions of one of the Universi
ty's most interesting individuals,
Classics Prof. Antony Raubitschek.
Raubitschek is the professorial
gentleman you've seen craftily
maneuvering his bicycle in and out
of the crush of morning bike traf
fice on campus, as he has for the
last 15 years.
Raubitschek, an emeritus profes
sor in the Classics Department,
breathes life into a subject that
many have given up for dead. In his
lectures, he brings to life Agamem
non and Achilleus, Odysseus and
the Cyclops, the works of Homer
and Aeschylus, Sophocles and
Ovid, and Virgil and Plato.
Raubitschek is enthusiastic —
during his lectures he often breaks
into dramatizations of his subjects.
His high vocal squeals and low bel
lows both amuse and inspire his
transfixed students.
It is next to impossible to fall as
leep during one of his lectures.

Raubitschek, who teaches an over
load of classes, is fascinating.
As his knowledge seems to have
no limits, this grand old storytel
ler's speech can head in any direc
tion — not just in what he says but
in how he says it. He often starts
speaking Greek or Latin during the
middle of a lecture. And while a
foreign language makes taking
notes somewhat difficult, it only
makes the professor that much
more interesting.
His students seem to think so,
after every Humanities 61 lecture,
they applaud enthusiastically. Not
many professors get that kind of
treatment, but then, not many pro
fessors give the kind of treatment
that Raubitschek goes, the kind of
treatment that makes many stu
dents love him.
"He's the most enthusiastic pro
fessor I've ever had," said one stu
dent.
Raubitschek, whom many stu
dents call "adorable," cares about
his work and about his students. He
even bakes brownies for the stu
dents in his freshman seminars.
"He's just amazing . . . It's not
like he's repeating something he's
done before. It's like he's teaching
something new every time," said
another student.
Raubitschek ". . . has a sincere

love of teaching and love for his
students," said one of his teaching
assistants. Classics Dept. Chairman
Marsh McCall describes
Raubitschek as "a gentle, senior
professor giving of his wealth of
knowledge . . . passing on the re
flections of his life to the young."
McCall added, "working with
Prof. Raubitschek is a constant ex
citement because he has so many
new ideas . .
Vet despite his many fresh ideas,
Raubitschek is the University con
nection with history. He has been a
world classicist for the past 40
years. During that time he has
traveled all over the world meeting
other of the world's greatest scho
lars.
"He is our link with the last half
century of European scholarship,"
McCall said.
Raubitschek comes from a time
long past where courtesy was the
rule and not an occasion. The
kindly, old gentleman brings gifts
and fruit, freshly picked from his
garden, to members of his depart
ment. Raubitschek also brings
flowers to the secretary he still calls
Mrs. Allred after fourteen years.
Raubitschek's spacious, corner
office on the second floor of the
Classics Department is a "beehive
of activity," crammed with students

during the professor's office hours.
The students come to learn from a
man who tells them not what to
think but/iow to think, by challeng
ing them to answer for themselves
questions that have for centuries
puzzled the world's greatest scho
lars.
What Assoc. Classics Prof.

Michael Wigodsky, a former stu
dent of Raubitschek's, once said
holds true for most of
Raubitschek's students: "I don't
think there is anyone from whom I
have learned more on how to be
puzzled."
In order to make his students
think, Raubitschek often will delib
erately take the "wrong" side of an
issue, hoping a student will argue
with him to prove the point. But
Raubitschek often argues the
"wrong" side so well that students
are led to some anger with
Raubitschek's teaching methods.
Among graduates in the depart
ment and even among some de
partment faculy, Raubitschek is
said to be "strong-willed and
opinionated." It is also said that "It
is almost impossible to argue with
him on a subject he feels strongly
about." But Wigodsky adds that he
and Raubitschek have "disagreed
about a lot of things . . . but Tony is
more interested in agreement than
disagreement. In fact, if you give
him half a chance, he'll show you
that when you disagree with him,
you're actually agreeing with him."
Raubitschek was born and raised
in Austria, which may explain the
heavy accent so amusing to some of
his students.
The rotund, mustachioed gent

leman graduated from the Univer
sity of Vienna in 1935. In 1937, he
was invited to Princeton as a re
search fellow. With the Nazis "invit
ing themselves" into Austria about
the same time, Raubitschek gladly
accepted Princeton's offer.
After several years at Princeton,
Raubitschek accepted an appoint
ment at Yale, then later moved back
to Princeton, then back to Yale, al
ternating between the two schools
until he came to Stanford in 1963.
In between appointments in
1941, Raubitschek married his wife,
Isabelle, how a professor in the Art
History and Classics Departments
here.
Ever since he arrived in Califor
nia, Raubitschek has ridden his
bicycle from his off-campus house
to work, partly because he's never
learned to drive a car.
He is the father of four and grand
father of five and one-half (five with
one on the way).
"If you devote yourself to teach
ing," Raubitschek said, . . and
not to publishing, to publicizing
yourself, you don't get many of the
great awards and distinctions."
Raubitschek has his own degree
of honor that students respect and
admire. Raubitschek devotes him
self to teaching during the school
