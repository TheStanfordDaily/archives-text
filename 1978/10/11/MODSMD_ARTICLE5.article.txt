# Popular calligraphy class teaches new writing skills
## 
### ALI WEBB 
Learning to write is a new skill for the 24
seniors enrolled in Values, Technology and
Society (VTS) 160 this fall. Students lined the
walls and filled the doorway at the first class
meeting.
"I've been trying to get in this class since
freshman year," said Melinda Smith, a senior
now enrolled in the course. Only offered
once a year and open only to seniors, the
student demand for Scriptorium: Calligraphy
and Illustration has been consistently higher
than the places available in the class.
Chemistry Prof. Eric Hutchinson and Chap
lain Robert Minto have turned away as many
students as they have taught in the six years
since the course opened. Hutchinson and
Minto teach the course for fun without
monetary compensation.
Designed as a part of the VTS program,
coursework provides a meeting ground for
technology and aesthetics. Students learn
two basic writing hands, foundation and
italic. Hutchinson also lectures on the de
velopment and production of pens, paper,

ink, gliding and simple illustration.
Students learn to make their own nonmetal
pen and mix their own ink. According to
Hutchinson, the course's appeal is due to a
general revival of interest in handcrafts. "I
think that you would see many students en
rolled in craft courses if they were offered,"
he added.
"Calligraphy is the least demanding art
form in terms of time and equipment. All you
need is ink, a pen and a drawing surface,"
Hutchinson said. Calligraphy has been
Hutchinson's hobby for 10 years.
The class is not a part of the art major and
very few art majors enroll. However, Karen
Eggerman, a senior in Art History, said she
feels the course will help her in the area of
design.
"It's a practical skill that will be helpful
professionally and socially," she said.
Composition and hand analysis are also
part of the course. "I teach the students to do
some simple hand analysis in order to under
stand how various hands are constructed,"
Hutchinson said.
