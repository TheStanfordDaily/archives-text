# Campus bike safety drive launched

"Due to the increase in parking fees on
campus and the fact that more streets are
being closed off, more people are riding
bicycles than ever before," said Robert
Beth, director of insurance risk and man
agement here. "And the problem of acci
dents is becoming very serious."
Alarmed by the increasing number of
campus bycicle accidents, Beth and others
in the University community formed a
special Bicycle Safety Committee to deal
specifically with hazardous conditions.
The committee has started "The Four
E's," safety campaign. The E's stand for
bicycle education, equipment, campus
engineering, and law enforcement of
bicycle regulations. All four areas are to be
worked on simultaneously.
Common sense
"There is a shortage of common sense
among bicyclists," said Stephen Schmidt,
of the Deptartment of Facilities Planning
and Construction. "The behavior of cyc
lists is not exemplary."
According to a press release from Uni
versity News Service, 55 accidents have
been reported to the Department of Public
Safety in less than a year.
"And a majority of accidents aren't even
reported," said Beth. "Usually someone
hits an object, or two people crash, and
they just go home with a bent-up wheel
and some bruises.
In order to begin educating University

riders, a Bike Fair will be held on Oct. 12
and 13 from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. in White
Plaza. Separate booths will be set up for
information, safety checks, bicycle regist
ration and the display and sale of equip
ment such as lights and reflectors.
"We are going to encourage people to
ride on the right side of the road," said
Beth. "Forthis purpose we will be painting
signs and designating areas for bicycles,
like in front of Meyer library."
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Depart
ment of Public Safety told of increased en
forcement of bicycle laws.
Citations
"Bicycles are subject to the same regula
tions as automobiles," he said. "And bicy
cle citations go down on the individual's
traffic record, which could be problematic
financially."
In order to increase bicycle enforce
ment on campus, two patrolmen began
riding around campus Monday on 10-
speed bikes.
"They will only give out citations and no
warnings," said Niemeyer. "Citations will
be given out for all flagrant violations of
the law," including speeding and running
stop signs, he said.
Night riding
"Our two main concerns are traffic vio
lations and people who ride at night," said
Beth. Visibility is a real problem.
"We are going to really emphasize lights

and equipment — what's available and
what can be bought."
Niemeyer added that another major
problem is cyclists who enter a roadway
from paths and alleys.
"The bicyclist has to make an attempt to
know there's a road there," he said.
Pointing lines
According to Schmidt, the idea of paint
ing lines through White Plaza to determine
the flow of bicycle traffic is meeting resis
tance.
"There is a conflict of aesthetics," he
said. "We have to give this a long look
before we do anything."
But plans are under way to place signs
and arrows at the corners of Campus Drive
and Serra Road.
"We want to make people aware that
these are two-way paths," Schmidt said.
"Unfortunately, this is not the ultimate
facility."
Accidents
Beth added that accidents on campus
are causing more problems than mere
bicycle wrecks.
"We observe more and more people br
inging suit against each other for bycicle
accidents," he said.
"Really, it's not until you're out in recre
ational cycling that your awareness of the
need to yield and stop becomes shar
pened," said Schmidt. "Here on campus,
it's easy to forget."


This year more bicyclists than ever can be found darting among
pedestrians and other bicyclists as they head to and from classes. To
combat the problem of increasing traffic and more bike accidents,
