# Freshmen, faculty experimenting with Western Culture I course

"It's the greatest thing for education at
Stanford since Darrin Nelson," said
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, referring to
the new Western Culture I course. Perry is
chairman of the Western Culture Pilot
Program Committee (WCPPC).
If successful, the course will become
one of several three-quarter sequences to
fulfill the proposed Western Culture re
quirement, effective in 1980.
The Faculty Senate endorsed the West
ern Culture requirement in 1976. The
WCPPC was formed "to motivate the fa
culty to develop course sequences" to
satisfy the requirement, Perry said.
Student involvement
The senate emphasized the need for the
"active intellectual involvement of stu
dents with primary works" representative
of Western civilization from ancient times
to the present.
This would require classes of not more
than 20 students, led by "regular" faculty
members, according to the senate.
Many faculty said they consider some
form of Western culture requirement a
necessity.
"The American educational system
doesn't send students to colleges, even
bright ones to the best universities, even
minimally educated in Western cultural
heritage," said Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall, a member of the WCPPC.
Therefore a college education must in
clude Western culture "for any student in

the Western world at a Western university
to call himself educated," McCall con
tinued.
Deficient education
"We've discovered that secondary edu
cation is deficient," said History Prof.
Lewis Spitz, another WCPPC member.
"I've had students who actually don't
know who Plato was," said Spitz.
Classics Prof. Antony Raubitschek, one
of five professors volunteering to teach
the course, was surprised that many of his
students had never read the Bible, sec
tions of which were required reading for
the first week of class.
"Not only have they not read it, but
some have a sneaking suspicion that it is
unconstitutional," he said.
A Western Culture requirement will"give
the freshmen something in common,"
Spitz said. "It'll add to the intellectual at
mosphere. At least it will take their minds
off the food," he said.
Enrollment
Over 500 freshmen expressed an in
terest in Western Culture I, but only 100
wee able to enroll due to lack of space,
according to Spitz. The number enrolled
has since dropped, primarily due to
scheduling conflicts.
Many freshmen are taking the course
because "it's something everyone should
know," according to freshman Anne Bye.
"I don't believe anyone ought to be
forced to take it," commented Eric Haeus
sler, who is also enrolled. Spitz said he

doubted that making it a requirement
would alienate students. "If the thing is
really good in itself, they'll discover it if
they're obliged," he said.
"There is no possible way a University
organization can avoid annoying some
people. But the fact is that the Faculty Se
nate has voted to try it out," Haeussler
said.
Personal attention
Students commended the personal at
tention afforded by the "great works-small
class" approach.
However the approach can be expen
sive, according to Perry. Last year Provost
William Miller cited $208,000 as a potential
maximum annual budget for the Western
Culture requirement.
"That figure doesn't doom the program
to failure," McCall said, "but it would re
quire careful, scrupulous budgeting for a
quality program."
'Do it right'
"We should do it right or not do it at all,"
said Perry. "But I think we'll be able to do it
right," he added.
Current courses such as the Humanities
61 to 63 series. Structured Liberal Educa
tion, and History 1 to 3 series could be
modified to fit the requirement in the fu
ture.
The problem of overlap of the proposed
Western culture requirement with the
humanities requirement "has yet to be
faced," McCall said.
