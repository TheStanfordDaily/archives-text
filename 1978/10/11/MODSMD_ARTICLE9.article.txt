## Editorial Election endorsements 
### 
Tomorrow and Friday students will
vote on candidates for the ASSU Se
nate as well as a proposal, sponsored
by the Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP), to abolish that
body.
Although the Daily believes the
CRAP amendment to the ASSU Con
stitution should be voted down,
strong grass roots support has
backed it. The possibility the senate
might become non-existent has
scared off many candidates.
It is a necessity for the senate to act
as a check and balance on the Coun
cil of Presidents. Most candidates
appearing before the Daily's edito
rial board Sunday agreed with us that
the senate must immediately reform
itself and restructure the election
process.
In endorsing senate aspirants, the
Daily was impressed by candidates
most willing to instigate action and
programs upon election to the se
nate. Also influential were candi
dates with a good understanding of
the inner workings of student gov
ernment at Stanford.
If CRAP fails, reform must start
immediately. However, that process
will, by necessity, be an extensive
and long one.
The Daily does not feel qualified to
discuss the merits of candidates who

did not appear before us, and thus
have chosen candidates only from
those interviewed.
These endorsements represent
who the Daily believes will be the
best senators. They are not listed in
order of preference.
Thomas Cart: Would be fresh
blood on the senate. Stresses stu
dent services and impresses us as a
person willing to place more em
phasis on committees.
Ron Johnson: Believes the senate
can be an effective body by returning
to the basics of student services. He
is concerned about election reform
and says the senate overextended it
self last year.
Gary Fremerman: Would be a con
scientious senator. Pushes the need
for the senate to be involved in Uni
versity affairs.
Alex Alben: Would be a moderat
ing force on senate and has proven
his dedication by his work with other
student organizations.
John Struthers: He believes the se
nate should think of student services
as a priority and off-campus issues as
secondary.
George Drysdale: The only
graduate we interviewed. His proven
experience and dedication as a
senator last year are strong enough
reasons for his re-election.
