# Tax cuts, appropriations considered by Congress
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The U.S. Con
gress is presently considering legisla
tion on three major items — tax cuts,
President Jimmy Carter's com
prehensive energy and water de
velopment plans, and an HEW-Labor
appropriations bill.
House Republicans began drum
ming up support yesterday for a Se
natebill thatwould reduce individual
taxes by an additional $164.5 billion
between 1980 and 1983 if the growth
of government spending is checked.
House Republican leader John
Rhodes of Arizona said the House
will vote today on a COP motion in
structing conferees to accept the Se
nate provision, which was sponsored
chiefly by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga).
The bill would reduce individual
taxes by about 25 percent over the
1979-1983 period.
Tax cuts
For the tax cuts to be realized, the
growth of government spending dur
ing that period would have to be re
duced belowcurrent expectations by
$84 billion.
In energy legislation a com
promise version of the $10.2 billion
energy and water development bill
Carter vetoed last week, but now
lacking some of the major features
he opposed, was introduced to Con
gress yesterday.
The compromise deletes from the
previously vetoed bill six water pro
jects that were at the top of Carter's
"hit list" for cancellation. Also de
leted were initial construction funds
for 11 other projects, although plan
ning money was retained.
Tax fuel-wasting cars
Also, the House and Senate
negotiators reached agreement yes
terday on a proposal to tax fuel
inefficient cars and provide tax cre
dits for home insulation.
Under the compromise, new fuel
inefficient cars would be taxed be

ginning with 1980 models getting less
than 15 miles per gallon. By 1986 the
tax would apply to cars getting less
than 23.5 mph and would range from
$400 to $3850.
The energy-tax legislation includes
some $1 billion in tax credits.
Under the measure, individuals
could take a tax credit of 15 percent
on the first $2000 for home insula
tion, storm doors, storm windows,
and for other energy-saving equip
ment — up to a total credit of $300.
The credit applies to purchases made
back to April 20, 1977 — the day Car
tersubmitted his energy proposals to
Congress.
Possible filibuster
However that part of the plan im
mediately ran into the threat of a Se
nate filibuster.
Two groups— senators represent
ing auto-manufacturing states and
those who oppose other parts of Car
ter's energy plan, thwarted efforts to
get a quick vote on the entire version
of the energy proposal.
Sen. Russell Long (D-La.), the main
Senate negotiator, planned to take
the compromise plan directly to the
Senate floor, but several auto-state
senators indicated they would delay
the proposal by filibuster. House
leaders had hoped to get the bill by
today so it could be combined with
four other parts of the energy prog
ram that have already been approved
by the Senate.
In other action, more than 2 mill
ion government workers, including
the entire military, face the prospect
of going without all or part of their
next pay check as crucial appropria
tions bills remain bogged down in
Congress.
HEW and Labor Department
employees were told yesterday if the
congressional impasse is not solved
"before the close of business today"
they will receive only half their nor

mal pay next week.
A resolution to continue the fiscal
1978 spending levels until the $56 bill
ion HEW-Labor appropriation bill is
passed began moving through Con
gress yesterday to cover immediate
salary demands.
There was speculation that if a
defense bill remains caught up in a
compromise effort, a similar spend
ing extension resolution for Penta
gon employees may be attached.
A Pentagon spokesman said most
of the pay checks already have been
sent to various installations around
the country and that checks which
normally are deposited directly into
bank accounts have been sent to the
banks with instructions not to de
posit them into the accounts until
notified.

back to April 20, 1977 — the day Car
tersubmitted his energy proposals to
Congress.
Possible filibuster
However that part of the plan im
mediately ran into the threat of a Se

Two groups— senators represent
ing auto-manufacturing states and
those who oppose other parts of Car
ter's energy plan, thwarted efforts to
get a quick vote on the entire version
of the energy proposal.
Sen. Russell Long (D-La.), the main
Senate negotiator, planned to take
the compromise plan directly to the
Senate floor, but several auto-state
senators indicated they would delay
the proposal by filibuster. House
leaders had hoped to get the bill by
today so it could be combined with
four other parts of the energy prog
ram that have already been approved
by the Senate.
In other action, more than 2 mill

the entire military, face the prospect
of going without all or part of their
next pay check as crucial appropria

Congress.
HEW and Labor Department

"before the close of business today"
they will receive only half their nor

A resolution to continue the fiscal

Washington (AP) — The U.S. Con
gress is presently considering legisla
tion on three major items — tax cuts,
President Jimmy Carter's com
prehensive energy and water de
velopment plans, and an HEW-Labor
appropriations bill.
House Republicans began drum
ming up support yesterday for a Se
natebill thatwould reduce individual
taxes by an additional $164.5 billion
between 1980 and 1983 if the growth
of government spending is checked.
House Republican leader John
Rhodes of Arizona said the House
will vote today on a COP motion in
structing conferees to accept the Se
nate provision, which was sponsored
chiefly by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga).
The bill would reduce individual
taxes by about 25 percent over the
1979-1983 period.
Tax cuts
For the tax cuts to be realized, the
growth of government spending dur
ing that period would have to be re
duced belowcurrent expectations by
$84 billion.
In energy legislation a com
promise version of the $10.2 billion
energy and water development bill
Carter vetoed last week, but now
lacking some of the major features
he opposed, was introduced to Con
gress yesterday.
The compromise deletes from the
previously vetoed bill six water pro
jects that were at the top of Carter's
"hit list" for cancellation. Also de
leted were initial construction funds
for 11 other projects, although plan
ning money was retained.
Tax fuel-wasting cars
Also, the House and Senate
negotiators reached agreement yes
terday on a proposal to tax fuel
inefficient cars and provide tax cre
dits for home insulation.
Under the compromise, new fuel
inefficient cars would be taxed be

ginning with 1980 models getting less
than 15 miles per gallon. By 1986 the
tax would apply to cars getting less
than 23.5 mph and would range from
$400 to $3850.
The energy-tax legislation includes
some $1 billion in tax credits.
Under the measure, individuals
could take a tax credit of 15 percent
on the first $2000 for home insula
tion, storm doors, storm windows,
and for other energy-saving equip
ment — up to a total credit of $300.
