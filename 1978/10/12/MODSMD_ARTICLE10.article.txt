# Robert Horn: 'penetrating professor'
## 
### LEE TIEN 
For the man on the street,
the Supreme Court represents
a group of nine old men sitting
in Washington, D.C. For medi
cal school admissions commit
tees all over the United States,
the Supreme Court is a body
inspiring possible changes in
affirmative action programs as
a result of the Court's ruling in
the Bakke case. But for a small
group of scmetimes-believed
to-be-masochistic students
here, the Supreme Court is an
engrossing institution whose
principal expositor is Political
Science Professor Robert
Horn.
Horn sits at a desk in the
front of a semi-circular room,
with approximately 60 students
arrayed around him. A few stu
dents may be gingerly waving
their hands, both hoping and
not hoping to be called upon.
Others pore over their case
books on constitutional in
terpretation furiously search
ing for the phrase that will
satisfy Horn's probing ques
tions.
"Please give us the facts of
the case, Mr. X," Horn might
say. Horn teaches his class,
"The Supreme Court and the
Constitution," by the case
study method, expecting each
student to prepare summaries,
or briefs, of historically impor
tant Supreme Court cases for
reference during discussion.

During discussion periods he
employs the Socratic method.
Anyone, prepared or not, is fair
game for his tough, penetrat
ing questions about each case.
The students say they ac
quire a healthy respect for the
material. "Youcan'tgetbehind
in this class without suffering,"
one student said. "When he
calls on you, and you don't
know what to say, just admit it
and clench your teeth."
Horn says he believes that
class discussion of the cases is
essential to a good understand
ing of the law. He strongly
hates "wasting valuable class
time" on people who aren't
sure of what's happening.
As a result, the atmosphere
has been described as
"paranoid."
"It's the only class where
someone turned around and
shook my hand when he intro
duced himself," said one
junior. Briefcases are not an
uncommon sight.
Horn isn't too worried about
the sanity of his students.
"Good students always go
through their ritual moan
ings," he said. Horn added that
none of his former students
who went on to law school has
ever come back and told him
that he was too hard.
"I know I demand a lot," he
said. The students know it, too.
It's common to hear students
gripe about classes. It's un

usual to hear a professor agree
with them about it. Every quar
ter, he announces to his class
that "this is an eight unit class
for only five units."
Horn has been teaching con
stitutional law for about 35
years. He began his academic
career as an undergraduate at
Ohio Wesleyan University,
progressing to graduate work
at both Princeton and Harvard
and culminating in a doctorate
earned in political science at
Princeton.
Horn is quick to point out that
he is "not a lawyer," but he did
do some work at Harvard Law
School, studying under such a
luminary as Felix Frankfurter,
who later became an associate
justice of the Supreme Court.
Horn first taught at Harvard,
then moved to the University
of Chicago.
In 1953, Horn came to Stan
ford and has been teaching
undergraduates ever since. He
said, "I don't think there is that
much difference between an
18-year old and a 22-year old"
in terms of intellect.
For example, he said that
undergraduates prompted him
to teach the class five times a
week, a rarity here. He recalled
that a group of students came
to him and asked to have more
classes, and he replied, "If you
can stand it, I can."
Horn has been compared to
Prof. Kingsfield, the law school

professor featured in The
Paper Chase. A certain degree
of physical similarity can be
found, but Horn flatly denies
that he was a model for the
character.
"Kingsfield may well have
been modeled after a con
glomerate" of law professors,
Horn said. He personally con
siders himself "much easier
than Kingsfield."
Horn plans to retire at the
end of next summer, but he
said he has made no long
range decisions about what he
will then be doing. He said that
writing is not likely to occupy
him, since he spent last spring
writing an article.

For the masochists who are
sorry that they missed their
chance to take Political Science
170 this fall, Horn will still be
teaching this winter and
spring.
One thing is certain, though.
Don't expect any kinder treat
ment due to his impending re
tirement. At the beginning of
classes this quarter, Horn
made no particular attempt to
pacify his class. "I watched The
Paper Chase last night in prep
aration for this lecture," he
told them. "I found it to be
melodramatic. This class will
not be melodramatic. It will
simply be hard."
