## David Sartoris Abortion best alternative 
### 
In 1973, the Supreme
Court legalized elective abor
tion in a landmark 7-2 decision.
Since then, the procedure has
become commponplace—l.2
million abortions were per
formed by American doctors in
1976, or one for every 2.8 live
births. Last year, following a
five month debate and dozens
of votes, Congress agreed to
eliminate most federal pay
ments for abortion.
Specifically, Medicaid funds
may be used only when 1) a
women's life is endangered, 2)
in the opinion of two physi
cians, the pregnancy would
cause her "severe and long
lasting physical damage," or 3)
the pregnancy results from
rape or incest reported within
60 days.
Since this decision, abortion
has been increasingly attacked
by "right to life" advocates on
their own, and 13 have passed
resolutions calling for a con
vention to draft a constitu
tional amendment that would
completely ban abortion.
The Catholic Church in 1975
issued a doctrine calling for
priests to speak out on the
abortion issue and encourag
ing the public to work toward
passage of federal and state
anti-abortion laws. One or
ganization, National Right to
Life, claims 11 million mem
bers in 1800 chapters and a
budget of $1.3 million, with
lobbyists in every state capital
and several full-time
Washington staffers.
Thus, it appears that the
abortion controversy is heating
up once again, to the point
where it is likely to become a
major issue in the 1980 presi
dential election as well as
others at both state and federal
levels.

As a medical student, I have
had opportunity to witness
several abortion procedures,
and do not easily forget the
cold stare of the developing
eyes of a dead fetus. Although I
question sincerely the right we
as a society have to disturb the
warm innocence of a potential
human, I find the alternatives
to abortion to be the greater of
two evils.
If elective abortions were
banned by the efforts of pro
life supporters, the incidence
of unwanted pregnancies
would not diminish signific
antly. For many women, this
procedure has become a
means of birth control, and
would be sought in most in
stances despite the law. Thus,
we would see a reemergence
of backroom abortion mills
and various "coat-hanger"
techniques — all of which in
volve risks of life-threatening
bleeding and/or infection to
the desperate female. As pre
sently performed by qualified
medical personnel, vacuum
aspiration takes about ten mi
nutes, costs about $185 in a
clinic, and is safer than giving
birth due to enforced sterile
technique.
The fetus whose mother re
luctantly opts to keep him or
her rather than go under
ground faces a stormy child
hood.
An unwanted child is likely
to grow up without a fatherand
under economic and social cir
cumstances unsuitable for
child-rearing. In pediatric clin
ical experiences, I have seen
numerous single parents
whose children obviously lack
ing the nutritional, hygenic,
emotiona, and social care es
sential for proper develop
ment. Abandonment, child

abuse, and juvenile delin
quency are likely to result from
such situations.
Although inappropriate to
place a price on life, welfare
costs will soar if states refuse to
make money available for
abortion. In California, for
example, it would cost up to
$487 million to provide one
year's care for children in lieu
of abortions last year, which
cost the state $27 million.
Obviously, the answer to the
abortion problem lies in more
efficient use and distribution
of contraception. A recent
study shows that 35 percent of
unmarried teen-age girls have
had sexual intercourse, and it
is this group towards which ef
forts should be directed.
Although some parents and
teachers believe that discus
sion of sex and contraception
with young people will en
courage promiscuity, ifdonein
an appropriate manner by
qualified school personnel and
physicians, this is not likely to
occur.
No one who has ever witnes
sed an abortion could ever be
in favor of the procedure.
However, until its alternatives
are made more acceptable, we
cannot justifiably ban it on a
national scale.

women's life is endangered, 2)
in the opinion of two physi
cians, the pregnancy would
cause her "severe and long
lasting physical damage," or 3)
the pregnancy results from
rape or incest reported within
60 days.
Since this decision, abortion
has been increasingly attacked
by "right to life" advocates on
their own, and 13 have passed
resolutions calling for a con
vention to draft a constitu
tional amendment that would
completely ban abortion.
The Catholic Church in 1975
issued a doctrine calling for
priests to speak out on the
abortion issue and encourag
ing the public to work toward
passage of federal and state
anti-abortion laws. One or
ganization, National Right to
Life, claims 11 million mem
bers in 1800 chapters and a
budget of $1.3 million, with
lobbyists in every state capital
and several full-time
Washington staffers.
Thus, it appears that the
abortion controversy is heating
up once again, to the point
where it is likely to become a
major issue in the 1980 presi
dential election as well as
others at both state and federal
levels.

As a medical student, I have
had opportunity to witness
several abortion procedures,
and do not easily forget the
cold stare of the developing
eyes of a dead fetus. Although I
question sincerely the right we
as a society have to disturb the
warm innocence of a potential
human, I find the alternatives
to abortion to be the greater of
two evils.
If elective abortions were
banned by the efforts of pro
life supporters, the incidence
of unwanted pregnancies
would not diminish signific
antly. For many women, this
procedure has become a
means of birth control, and
would be sought in most in
stances despite the law. Thus,
we would see a reemergence
of backroom abortion mills
and various "coat-hanger"
techniques — all of which in
volve risks of life-threatening
bleeding and/or infection to
the desperate female. As pre
sently performed by qualified
medical personnel, vacuum
aspiration takes about ten mi
nutes, costs about $185 in a
clinic, and is safer than giving
birth due to enforced sterile
technique.
The fetus whose mother re
luctantly opts to keep him or
her rather than go under
ground faces a stormy child
hood.
An unwanted child is likely
to grow up without a fatherand
under economic and social cir
cumstances unsuitable for
child-rearing. In pediatric clin
ical experiences, I have seen
numerous single parents
whose children obviously lack
ing the nutritional, hygenic,
emotiona, and social care es
sential for proper develop
ment. Abandonment, child

abuse, and juvenile delin
quency are likely to result from
such situations.
Although inappropriate to
place a price on life, welfare
costs will soar if states refuse to
make money available for
abortion. In California, for
example, it would cost up to
$487 million to provide one
year's care for children in lieu
of abortions last year, which
cost the state $27 million.
Obviously, the answer to the
abortion problem lies in more
efficient use and distribution
of contraception. A recent
study shows that 35 percent of
unmarried teen-age girls have
had sexual intercourse, and it
is this group towards which ef
forts should be directed.
Although some parents and
teachers believe that discus
sion of sex and contraception
with young people will en
courage promiscuity, ifdonein
an appropriate manner by
qualified school personnel and
physicians, this is not likely to
occur.
No one who has ever witnes
sed an abortion could ever be
in favor of the procedure.
However, until its alternatives
are made more acceptable, we
cannot justifiably ban it on a
national scale.

In 1973, the Supreme
Court legalized elective abor
tion in a landmark 7-2 decision.
Since then, the procedure has
become commponplace—l.2
million abortions were per
formed by American doctors in
1976, or one for every 2.8 live
births. Last year, following a
five month debate and dozens
of votes, Congress agreed to
eliminate most federal pay
