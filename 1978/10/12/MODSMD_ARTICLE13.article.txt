## Right to vote should be taken more seriously 
### 
One of the more amusing pieces of conventional
wisdom is the concept of voting. In itself, voting is so
important to some groups that they support any vote,
no matter how indiscriminate. "We don't care who
(or what) you vote for, just vote — that's what's im
portant." People actually say this; some actually be
lieve it. They divorce voting from effort and responsi
bility.
Apparently, casting a ballot does not require any
forethought, and a vote for President Jimmy Carter is
as good as a vote for the Easter Bunny. Leaving per
sonalities aside, the concept of voting without think
ing runs counter to the entire purpose of the ballot.
Through elections people presumably shape a gov
ernment that will serve them properly. Surely our
representatives should be chosen on more than a
whim.
We are told that voting is a basic right. Somehow,
checking a box approaches the same moral plane as
owning property. This "just vote"attitude is so preva
lent that grown men support legislation to make re
gistration as simple as buying a burger, and about as

intellectually taxing. Again, we seem to be disas
sociating voting and responsibility. Encouraging
haphazard voting mitigates the importance of issues
in an election while favoring emotional choices. If
people cannot take the time to register, why will they
take the time to rationally consider their ballots? It is
quite a reflection on the politicians who work for
such changes.
Despite these people's efforts, 82 million voters
decided the fate of a nation of 216 million in the 1976
presidential election. Unless we assume that 62 per
cent of the U.S. is either under age or incompetent,
there must be a fair number of citizens who do not
consider voting as particularly vital. In fact, it's not
unreasonable to say that there exists people who
really don't care.
Concerned voices cry, "What has happened to our
nation to cause this tide of apathy?" (a favorite word).
This, however, is the wrong question. We need to ask
why people should bother to vote in the first place.
Most people tend not to do things without some
reason, so what reason exists to vote?

There are people who honestly do not want to
worry about government. They have their own lives
and see no cause to fool with a political system which
many feel to be corrupt in any case. Supposedly, this
is still a free country, and one has the option — or
does he? The sad fact is that voting is more important
than most people think.
It's sad, because the reasons for voting are not as
exalted as usually proffered. Patriotism, civic duty
and responsibility are impressive, but not valid con
siderations. They make for good bumper stickers, but
people grow tired of ringing phrases — tired and
unconvinced. Considering the current low opinion
of politics in general and politicians in particular,
such language falls on deaf ears. Unfortunately, the
best reasons for voting do not reflect well upon the
"land of the free."
A Frenchman in 1850 explained the situation well.
In his pamphlet, The Law, Frederic Bastiat argued
against the developing socialism of France. His
thoughts are as valid today as then; they remain a
systematic and inspiring defense of freedom. In any
case, he cites the three major systems of law that man
employs:
I) The few plunder the many.
II) Everybody plunders everybody.
Hi) Nobody plunders anybody.
Recalling examples of each is simple, but it is dis
heartening to realize that despite the Founding
Fathers' best efforts, this nation falls into the second
category. Evolving through the rule of the majority,
we have a system that justifies a great deal solely by
electoral tallies. It's "dog eat dog," but it's not
capitalism, it's legislation.
This, then, is the point. The actions of politicians
are becoming too much a part of everyone's life. Our
burgeoning government is no secret, and this is just
another unfortunate consequence. Increasingly,
people cannot afford to ignore the fairyland of the
Potomac. Many taxes have the explicit intention of
redistributing wealth, regulations can make or break
a business, laws control the fate of individuals, and a
Senate subcommittee can fund virtually anything.
Can it be surprising that government is plagued by
scandal? The stakes have been steadily increasing as
the state has grown. People become more ambitious
and desperate. Abuses in the quest of power are
more inevitable than shocking.
There can be little wonder over the influx of lob
byists to Washington. They realize that, for better or
worse, government can do a great deal to help or
hinder their particular cause. Popular phraseology
terms this as the influence of "special interests,"
which are bad. This is a wonderful joke.
Obviously, everyone is a member of a myriad of
"special interests." From backyards to uranium, we
all have pet dreams. To automatically associate "spe
cial interests" as bad is naive at best, foolish at worst.
Their leverage is nothing more than a product of our
system. When "everyone plunders everyone" any
additional input anyone can exert is certainly sensi
ble.
In fact, there is no better device for legal theft. In a
government where decisions are made by plurality,
not merit, theft can take many forms. Most taxation
and inflation are examples of this type of robbery.
All this serves to show the importance of the voter.
Our government decides by majority, an these deci
sions affect all citizens, now to a point where no one
can afford to ignore. Vote properly and you may get
free meals, free hospital care, even free income. So
it's important to get the other bunch before they get
you. Why vote in civic duty when voting in greed has
such a proven track record? Considering the pos
sibilities, there has never been a better time to be an
American voter.
Frankly, I wish it weren't so.
