## Civil calm evidence of fear 
### 
For some years now, there has been an atmos
phere of civil calm and peace in the United States.
With the end of the draft, the student's movement
disappeared almost overnight. Inflation and un
employment, the Scylla and Charybdis of
economics, have shifted the action emphasis of
most people from social and ethical issues to self
survival. Domestic and personal concerns have
effectively quashed the nobler instincts of the
vocal portion of the American public.
To my mind, the prevailing civil calm is no diffe
rent from fear. In times such as these, a human
being can never be calm. They can only restrain
themselves out of fear. And this fear is frightening
to me, because it is far more effective at checking
progressive action, at silencing social critics, and
even at muzzling free thought than any illegal
police search and seizure, censorship law or
wiretap.
When we begin to fear the tide of the times, we
also enable ourselves to see only what is conve
nient, or rose-tinted. It requires a singular nar
rowness of viewpoint, attention concentrated
only on what is local to the senses — where you are
right now — and what is most certain to your
perceptions — today, rather than tomorrow or
yesterday. The idea is embodied in the phrase 'live
for today, tomorrow will take care of itself.'
People are frightened. We are afraid that speak
ing loudly will lose for us what we have managed
to hold to in these barren times. Yet we will ourse
lves into contentment, we become as cattle graz
ing on a field. Cattle have no past,except fields of
green. They certainly have no future, except the
abattoir.
While cattle may be tied down to one time
frame, human beings are potentially capable of
more. Philosophers and social scientists tell us
that the ability to look to the past and remember,
and to look to the future and predict, is an essen
tial quality of humanity. Yet we are not realizing
that potential, and the very prevalence of the live
for-the-moment is an ideal way of dealing with a
future that is uncertain and ominous, and a past
that is painful. It helps the pain to pass, for any
pain we experience over a long period of time will

soon fade away into the background noise that
mental filters mask so efficiently from the daily
routine.
There, perhaps, is the key. The more the pain,
the more we have to mask, and the more we have
to mask, the less real the outside world will seem
to us. This we know as sleep. Surely soon, there
will come a time when our sleep is so sound that
events whch were once morally repugnant will
have become perfectly acceptable and com
monplace, not really worthy of anyone's attention.
The greatest evil of the present day is not war or
greed. Those have been with us for a long time
after all. The greatest evil is the loss of faith in the
human spirit, the distortion of reality and
foresight, and the untroubled sleep which is now
coming over us.
There are not new arguments to be made here.
The jeremiad is as popular a form of commentary
these days as the satire, and most people who read
this won't be inspired to action, or to change in
lifestyles. Instead of aiming to reignite the fires of
protest at Stanford, my aim is humbler.
It is so easy to fall into the trap of ignorance.
Between pre-med classes and the tennis courts,
there is a lot to do, and anyone could easily
emerge from Stanford with a poorer and more
incomplete knowledge of current events than
what one may have had upon entering.
Stanford students could take a major step to
wards getting out of the lethargy of the 1970s by
doing one simple thing: talking. If we would only
start approaching one another informally and
casually, and discussing issues that have a broader
reach than the tennis courts or the chemistry lab,
we could go a long way towards reviving the spirit
of optimism and change that left the campus, and
the rest of the country, with the close of the '60s.
There is no intellectual community at Stanford,
there is no feeling of scholarly comradeship bind
ing Stanford students, faculty and other commun
ity members. Yet it would be so easy to start one.
All that we each need to do is start talking about
the outside world the next time we're at dinner or
waiting for a lecture class to begin.
