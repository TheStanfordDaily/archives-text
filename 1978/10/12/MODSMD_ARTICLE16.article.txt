## Attacking public education dangerous 
### 
In his recent (October 6) article "Anti-Gay Briggs Initiative
Unjust," David Miller examined the issue from a libertarian
perspective of sorts and eventually came down against the initia
tive, but only after a lot of unnecessary hemming-and-hawing and
only after laying a lot of gratuitous ideological hurt on public
schooling. While others will surely comment on the sexual
preference issue itself, I was moved to respond to the callow
facility with which Miller wrote off public education as a
"homogenizing" institution that should be summarily ended.
Attacking the national commitment to public education has
become one of the most dangerously popular political games in
town, being played with equal fervor now by racial bigots, religi
ous separatists, daffy Summerhillians, those claiming a general
right to pass their own ignorance on to their children, and those
like Miller claiming a general right to be selfish in life.
I laughed out loud at the end of his article when Miller en
visioned a coalition of Briggs' fag-hunting squadrons and "any
one who values justice and human rights" working to overthrow
the public school system and then creating in its aftermath "a
freedom and diversity in education that would benefit all citi
zens." What dangerous, unthinking fluff!
Rightfully sensitive to centralized tyranny, Miller shows no
sense whatsoever of local tyrannies, which repress far more per
sonally and therefore far more perniciously, and of the tyranny of
propertied interest, against which democratic government has

historically mitigated. In this regard, I question whether Miller
empathizes in the least with the conditions that led to the pro
secution of the Brown and Serrano cases.
Miller professes concern for the damages done to "citizens" by
public education, but he nowhere reveals a worthwhile concep
tion of citizenship, and so his professions seem only ironic and
insincere. Miller thinks of "rights" and "liberties" as an inexhaus
tible supply of political travelers cheques given us as a human
birthright, to be cashed in wherever we happen to land.
Whatever political rights, freedoms, and liberties we now have,
we have accrued either through sheer force (the justice of
Thrasymachus) or through membership in a political community.
Bigots have no "right" to deny public employment to the victims
of their bigotry, and the proud-to-be-selfish have no "right" to
renounce their share of the common care of our democracy,
including the provision for the intellectual preparation of the
next cohort of citizens.
Miller is even wrong about the things he's right about. Yes the
existence of public schooling "is a guarantee of social conflict,"
but only because life itself under conditions of material scarcity
and barely constrained human willfulness is also "a guarantee of
social conflict." At least in quarreling over the design of public
education people are quarreling over something meaningful.
Yes, public schools are, purposefully, a "homogenizing" in
stitution, but only in this limited sense: that as the absolute
controllers of their own political destinies, the initiates to democ
ratic citizenry should all know something of their common and
separate histories, something of the geography of the area they
commonly and separately hold, something of the principles of
mathematics, science, logic, and rhetoric, something of the
ethics of democratic citizenship, and something of the active
pleasures of contemplation, textual study, craft, and art.
Sure, the public schools we have now don't nearly match the
role reserved for them in the theoretical fabric of our polity. They
have been trivialized, for one thing, presented as places for
students to put up with, however regretfully, in the pursuit of
future payoffs; a "minor league" for business and industry. They
have been persistently blamed, for another, for those very cul
tural and sociological pathologies to which they have had to
adjust, and many educators have gotten gun-shy, hiding behind
checklists of demeaning behavioral objectives and minimal com
petencies.
They have been invested, finally, with duties that fall much
more naturally to the departments of public health, corrections,
and housing, to churches and to voluntary secular agencies.
Overall, yes, public education is floundering, but it would be a
shame if Miller's general confusion betweeen political libertyand
political withdrawal influenced any action whatsoever against it.
