# Planning funerals, installing alarms
## Students find 'bizarre summer jobs' 
### ANDREW RICH 
"Clerical work," "odd jobs
for my fathers company,"
"worked in an office." Ask
somebody what they did this
summer and chances are you'll
hear something like that. But in
a community of 6000 under
graduates, you're bound to
come across a few unusual re
sponses.
The pursuit of summer cash
sends people to odd places.
Sophomore Woddy Heller
answered an ad in the New
York Times placed by a fire
alarm manufacturer. The com
pany was looking for people to
install its devices in homes,
and was offering $7.50 an hour
to do it. After five days of train
ing, Heller was selling, not in
stalling, the devices door to
door.
Another student here who
tried a stint at the travelling
salesman routine was junior
Ron Lepow. Lepow enlisted
with a Nashville company
which came to the University
to recruit a team of book
salesmen. The company pro
vided its workers with enough
cash to cover transportation
and living expenses. Lepow
and 12 other men then drove to

Nashville at the start of the
summer for a week of training.
Calling themselves the Stan
ford University Consolidated
Men's Enterprises, the men
split up into smaller groups
and traveled into the eastern
states. Lepow's assignment
landed him in New Bedford,
Mass., where he sold books for
a "very healthy" commission.
Scrubbing uranium dust off
counters probably sounds
dangerous enough to be excit
ing. Junior Mike Charlson
worked as a decontaminator at
the Idaho National Engineering
Library. For just under $6 an
hour, Charlson took "spic and
span" and rag in hand each
morning, cleansing any area
that might have accumulated
radioactive dust.
"Interesting perhaps," said
Charlson, "but terribly boring.
You put cleanser on the rag,
wring it out, wipe off the
counter once, then throw the
rag away and start over again.
Dull."
Other interesting jobs? One
student counted cash in a Las
Vegas casino. Another traced
missing heirs for the Prince
George's County Orphans
Court. Still anotherworked in a

mortuary.
A mortuary? That probably
sounds like a bizarre place to
work, but apparently it wasn't
that uncommon. Senior Dave
Atkinson got his mortuary job
through the Youth Employ
ment Service, a Palo Alto
student-oriented agency. An
interview with a local mortuary
landed him a full time position,
doing odd jobs around the
grounds and within the build
ing. His various chores en
tailed gardening, janitorial
tasks, and minorfuneral direct
ing. The latter job involved
moving caskets, making sure
everything looked decorative,
as well as looking solemn and
decorative himself at the fun
eral processions.
"It was pretty bizarre some
times. You know how traveling
salesmen come around offer
ing office equipment. Well in a
mortuary, they come around
selling caskets. Weird! They're
plugging for caskets with
stereos inside, plus carpeting,
satin pillowcases, the whole
bit," Atkinson said. "It's
strange alright."
So your job packaging pen
cils wasn't as interesting as th

ese? Well, there's always next
summer. The Student
Employment Office (SEO) here
has a pamphlet to help stu
dents get job ideas. The book
let offers suggestions for find
ing a job to suit your tastes.
SEO sits back to back with the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) between
the Stanford Bookstore and the
Cubberley education building.
Although the summer job
search usually begins winter
quarter, CPPC begins to re
ceive internship and employ
ment information as early as
October and November.
If you're interested in find
ing a job for this year, there are
many available. A continuous
listing is posted at CPPC, and
students are welcome to come
in and look around. Although
peculiar jobs are by far the ex
ception, there are generally
few strange offerings.
