# Many American women lack necessary job skills
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — An esti
mated 26 million American
women — nearly one of every
three — lack the basic educa
tional and job skills needed to
survive in today's society, a
presidential advisory council
reported this week.
The report says the worst off
are "displaced homemakers,"
women who have lost their
spouses because of death, de
sertion or divorce and are
forced into the job market.
They are so numerous and
their problems so urgent that
they constitute a "hidden sub
culture" in American society,
the council said.
Many single mothers,
women over the age of 60 and
displaced homemakers lack
marketable job skills, con
cludes the report, entitled
"Neglected Women."
Economic ignorance
Many of these women may
be good mothers and house
keepers, but they are ignorant
of such economic realities as
money management, credit,
insurance and banking, the re
port says.
"The common denominator
for all 26 million of these
women is that they are caught,
because they are women, in
stereotypes," the report says.
"They are the products of past
educational and social patterns
which do not apply to today's
reality."
The report, written by the
National Advisory Council on
Women's Educational Prog
rams, says these disadvantaged
women need training for
well-paying jobs that offer ad
vancement opportunities.
Financial aid
"They also need access to fi
nancial aid for tuition, child
care, transportation, clothing
and, frequently, living ex
penses," the report concludes.
The council recommended
legislation that would provide
these women with financial as
sistance for education prog
rams, tax incentives for career
advancement education and

anti-poverty programs aimed
at counseling and training.
"Of the three groups, dis
placed homemakers have the
most urgent educational
needs," the report says. "They
constitute almost a hidden
subculture whose existence
and problems are just becom
ing known. The homemaker
who is forced back into the
labor market faces an array of
educational, economic, social
and psychological problems."
Census Bureau
The Census Bureau does not
have a category for "displaced
homemakers." But 1977 cen
sus figures show there were 10

million widows and 2.8 million
divorced women in the 35-to
-64 age group.
Census figures also show 4.7
million households with chil
dren under 18 headed by single
women, and 19 million women
aged 60 and over.
Joy Simonson, executive di
rector of the council, said it's
obvious that not all these
women are neglected. "But as
groups, they all have needs,"
she said. "We're not addres
sing all these women, such as
those in nursing homes, but
we want to reach women who
could benefitfrom educational
programs."

divorced women in the 35-to
-64 age group.
Census figures also show 4.7
million households with chil
dren under 18 headed by single
women, and 19 million women
aged 60 and over.
Joy Simonson, executive di
rector of the council, said it's
obvious that not all these
women are neglected. "But as
groups, they all have needs,"
she said. "We're not addres
sing all these women, such as
those in nursing homes, but
we want to reach women who
could benefitfrom educational
programs."
Washington (AP) — An esti
mated 26 million American
women — nearly one of every
three — lack the basic educa
tional and job skills needed to
survive in today's society, a
presidential advisory council
reported this week.
The report says the worst off
are "displaced homemakers,"
women who have lost their
spouses because of death, de
sertion or divorce and are
forced into the job market.
They are so numerous and
their problems so urgent that
they constitute a "hidden sub
culture" in American society,
the council said.
Many single mothers,
women over the age of 60 and
displaced homemakers lack
marketable job skills, con
cludes the report, entitled
"Neglected Women."
Economic ignorance
Many of these women may
be good mothers and house
keepers, but they are ignorant
of such economic realities as
money management, credit,
insurance and banking, the re
port says.
"The common denominator
for all 26 million of these
women is that they are caught,
because they are women, in
stereotypes," the report says.
"They are the products of past
educational and social patterns
which do not apply to today's
reality."
The report, written by the
National Advisory Council on
Women's Educational Prog
rams, says these disadvantaged
women need training for
well-paying jobs that offer ad
vancement opportunities.
Financial aid
"They also need access to fi
nancial aid for tuition, child
care, transportation, clothing
and, frequently, living ex
penses," the report concludes.
The council recommended
legislation that would provide
these women with financial as
sistance for education prog
rams, tax incentives for career
advancement education and

anti-poverty programs aimed
at counseling and training.
"Of the three groups, dis
placed homemakers have the
most urgent educational
needs," the report says. "They
constitute almost a hidden
subculture whose existence
and problems are just becom
ing known. The homemaker
who is forced back into the
labor market faces an array of
educational, economic, social
and psychological problems."
Census Bureau
The Census Bureau does not
have a category for "displaced
homemakers." But 1977 cen
sus figures show there were 10

million widows and 2.8 million
divorced women in the 35-to
-64 age group.
Census figures also show 4.7
million households with chil
dren under 18 headed by single
women, and 19 million women
aged 60 and over.
