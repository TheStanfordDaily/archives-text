# Campus seeks expert on Mideast affairs
## 
### PETER BRETT 
| The Department of Political Sci-
I ence is now negotiating to ap
| point a visiting professor in the
I area of Middle East politics, ac
| cording to Political Science Dept.
1 Chairman John Manley.
1 There is no guarantee that the
| negotiations will work out, but
| "the prospects look promising.
| These things are always tenta
| tive," Manley said.
The department is conducting
I negotiations for a professor now
teaching at a Canadian university,
he added.
"It's always a severe problem to
get a professor to leave his own
university," Manley said.
Presently there are no courses
offered in Middle Eastern politics
here because no regular faculty
member in the political science
department has that area as a
major interest, Manley said.
I"The fact that we don't have
1 anyone in the department know
| ledgeable in the Middle East field
| is lamentable but true.
I "Our department can't cover

every major part of the world," he
added. "However, there is a
strong feeling that the deficiency
in the Mideast needs to be cor
rected."
The lack of a Mideast expert
here has not been a result of the
controversial nature of the issue,
Manley said. "The fact that it is a
controversial issue is a reason for
searching foran expert in the field
rather than against it."
A visiting professor had not
been sought in the past because
of the department's general pol
icy of replacing the positions of
professors on leave with visiting
instructors in the same field. Polit
ical Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, for example, an expert on
African affairs on leave this year,
has been replaced by an instruc
tor in that field.
The department's limited
budget also constrains the hiring
of an instructor, Manley said.
If the Mideast expert were ac
quired, he or she would probably
teach two quarters here next year,
he said.
