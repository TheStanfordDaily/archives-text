## theater/jon levitow Coward for all that he's worth 
### 
It is entirely ridiculous and
vain to wish that Noel Coward
wrote plays more like Henrik
Ibsen's, but Coward's Private
Lives deserves the compari
son. Both artists are interested
in the lives of intelligent,
affluent, middle-class people.
Coward's witty dialogue will
provoke some chuckles from
the most sober of morally abso
lute viewers. Ultimately, how
ever, the play is a clever but
innocuous diversion, mainly
for cynical affluent couples of
the type Coward depicts.
All the acid, self-critical
humor Coward is known for
amounts to nothing by the
finale of Private Lives. Ibsen
took the trouble to describe
the profound problems which
he felt had infected Norweigan
society. Coward self
consciously toys with moral
contradictions of the 1930-ish
British well-to-do. But Coward
can't get any more out of the
material than a well-paced bar
rage of one-liners similar to
Neil Simon's plays. By ignoring
the serious side of his charac
ters almost entirely, Coward
leaves a sickeningly sweet taste
in the mouth, like a martini
with too much vermouth.
If a light-hearted snicker at
bourgeois love and manners is

what you need or want, Private
Lives deserves a chance on its
own terms.
The Coward hero, that
good-looking, perfectly man
nered fellow sipping his
cocktail, who turns to his wife
on the romantic terrace of a
Biarritz hotel and says suavely,
"I'd rather like to chop off your
head with a dull meat cleaver,"
doesn't bore. His problem is
that he lacks substance as a
comic character in the final
weigh-in. He is never de
veloped. He needs the total
misery of lames Thurber's
nightmare cocktail sippers. He
already has the nastiness, the
cynicism, but his self-loathing
doesn't go deep enough. Al
though he says "To hell with
love," he doesn't believe it.
Plot
Private Lives is the story of a
Coward husband and wife, di
vorced for five years, who meet
in the south of France when
each is honeymooning with a
new love. Each has married a
young and innocent pushover
whom they could never love
deeply.
The original couple meet by
chance, fall quickly back in
love, and escape to Paris. Their
deserted spouses join forces
and pursue them there, and
they discover that the Coward
ly pair have decided to split up
again. After a climactic tea
party the Coward hero and his
old wife realize that they were
made for each other after all
and escape out the back way,
leaving the deserted man and
woman in a violent argument
that in a Coward play smells
strongly of blossoming love.
Energy
The Palo Alto Players leap
onto Noel Coward's Private
Lives with energy and sincerity
that make it an entertaining
piece of light comedy with
some amateurish touches. The
play, which director Montroni
calls "wickedly frolicsome,"
offers an opportunity for the
fairly slick company to toy
"wickedly" with the ideals of

love among the affluent
bourgeois. As Coward himself
said, "There is actually more to
the play than this, but not very
much."
Brian Lucas attacks the cent
ral part of spotless, yet entirely
corrupt Elyot Chase with great
energy, but he only succeeds
in beating the life out of it. Ini
tially, the aristocratic British
accent which the part demands
slows his whole character. Past
this, he cannot communicate
the flawless manners and per
fect form which make Elyot
Chase as appleaing to the
ladies as he must be.
The character requires a
clipped, decidedly conclusive
tone which charms as well as
stabs, a mixture of inhuman
detachment and very human
feelings. Mr. Lucas muddles
through the part, slurring his
words, his attitudes and his
posture.
Authentic
Surprisingly, Louisa Hart as
his first wife, Amanda, catches
the extravagant charm of this
social class, and presents as
well the bitter sarcasm of her
disappointed character. Physi
cally, she sparkles with gaudily
made-up eyes and a pouting
sensual mouth. Long thin arms
and fingers, and a slinky way of
moving give her character an
aristocratic sense of languid
self-indulgence. Even her ac
cent sounds nasal and clipped
enough to pass as authentic.
Ms. Hart is truly the delight of
the play when her energy and
concentration seem on; when
she loses the spark, she be
comes almost as flat as Mr.
Lucas.
David Montroni directs the
action with a light and natural

air. Some awkward stage busi
ness arrives in a poorly
choreographed fight between
Elyot and Amanda. The final
moments of the play, which are
important to the idea of love's
constant renewal, also came
out confused and awkward.
Montroni decides to let the
play unfold on its own terms,
rather than to comment on its
dated humour through, say, a
tongue-in-cheek presentation,
or some other perspective on
the action.
The first scene is set in a
clever balcony stage design
which allows the original
couple to be five feet away
from each other without se
eing one another. This ar
rangement heightens the
sense of absurdity and allows
the comic side of the play to
show without embarrassment
over its limited view of the
world. In the second scene,
however, the general mood
and set tends so toward realism
that this sense of absurd de
tachment is lost.
Shallow
While the Palo Alto Players
present the play with skill, they
should have seen the shallow
ness of the humor, and
worked with it, instead of
against it, which they did by
taking it all too seriously. The
play, not the players, borders
on an insult to the intelligence.
While the production was spi
rited, one might, unless one
has a taste for Neil Simon, con
sider sticking with the next
production of Ibsen in the
area.
Plays Thurs., 8p.m., Fri., 8:30

Tom Woosnam and Nina DuVal in Noel Coward's Private Lives, now
playing at the Palo Alto Community Theatre.
It is entirely ridiculous and
vain to wish that Noel Coward
wrote plays more like Henrik
Ibsen's, but Coward's Private
Lives deserves the compari
son. Both artists are interested
in the lives of intelligent,
affluent, middle-class people.
Coward's witty dialogue will
provoke some chuckles from
the most sober of morally abso
lute viewers. Ultimately, how
ever, the play is a clever but
innocuous diversion, mainly
for cynical affluent couples of
the type Coward depicts.
All the acid, self-critical
humor Coward is known for
amounts to nothing by the
finale of Private Lives. Ibsen
took the trouble to describe
the profound problems which
he felt had infected Norweigan
society. Coward self
consciously toys with moral
contradictions of the 1930-ish
British well-to-do. But Coward
can't get any more out of the
material than a well-paced bar
rage of one-liners similar to
Neil Simon's plays. By ignoring
the serious side of his charac
ters almost entirely, Coward
leaves a sickeningly sweet taste
in the mouth, like a martini
with too much vermouth.
If a light-hearted snicker at
bourgeois love and manners is

what you need or want, Private
Lives deserves a chance on its
own terms.
The Coward hero, that
good-looking, perfectly man
nered fellow sipping his
cocktail, who turns to his wife
on the romantic terrace of a
Biarritz hotel and says suavely,
"I'd rather like to chop off your
head with a dull meat cleaver,"
doesn't bore. His problem is
that he lacks substance as a
comic character in the final
weigh-in. He is never de
veloped. He needs the total
misery of lames Thurber's
nightmare cocktail sippers. He
already has the nastiness, the
cynicism, but his self-loathing
doesn't go deep enough. Al
though he says "To hell with
love," he doesn't believe it.
Plot
Private Lives is the story of a
Coward husband and wife, di
vorced for five years, who meet
in the south of France when
each is honeymooning with a
new love. Each has married a
young and innocent pushover
whom they could never love
deeply.
The original couple meet by
chance, fall quickly back in
love, and escape to Paris. Their
deserted spouses join forces
and pursue them there, and
they discover that the Coward
ly pair have decided to split up
again. After a climactic tea
party the Coward hero and his
old wife realize that they were
made for each other after all
and escape out the back way,
leaving the deserted man and
woman in a violent argument
that in a Coward play smells
strongly of blossoming love.
Energy
The Palo Alto Players leap
onto Noel Coward's Private
Lives with energy and sincerity
that make it an entertaining
piece of light comedy with
some amateurish touches. The
play, which director Montroni
calls "wickedly frolicsome,"
offers an opportunity for the
fairly slick company to toy
"wickedly" with the ideals of

love among the affluent
bourgeois. As Coward himself
said, "There is actually more to
the play than this, but not very
much."
Brian Lucas attacks the cent
ral part of spotless, yet entirely
corrupt Elyot Chase with great
energy, but he only succeeds
in beating the life out of it. Ini
tially, the aristocratic British
accent which the part demands
slows his whole character. Past
this, he cannot communicate
the flawless manners and per
fect form which make Elyot
Chase as appleaing to the
ladies as he must be.
The character requires a
clipped, decidedly conclusive
tone which charms as well as
stabs, a mixture of inhuman
detachment and very human
feelings. Mr. Lucas muddles
through the part, slurring his
words, his attitudes and his
posture.
Authentic
Surprisingly, Louisa Hart as
his first wife, Amanda, catches
the extravagant charm of this
social class, and presents as
well the bitter sarcasm of her
disappointed character. Physi
cally, she sparkles with gaudily
made-up eyes and a pouting
sensual mouth. Long thin arms
and fingers, and a slinky way of
moving give her character an
aristocratic sense of languid
self-indulgence. Even her ac
cent sounds nasal and clipped
enough to pass as authentic.
Ms. Hart is truly the delight of
the play when her energy and
concentration seem on; when
she loses the spark, she be
comes almost as flat as Mr.
Lucas.
David Montroni directs the
action with a light and natural

air. Some awkward stage busi
ness arrives in a poorly
choreographed fight between
Elyot and Amanda. The final
moments of the play, which are
important to the idea of love's
constant renewal, also came
out confused and awkward.
Montroni decides to let the
play unfold on its own terms,
rather than to comment on its
dated humour through, say, a
tongue-in-cheek presentation,
or some other perspective on
the action.
The first scene is set in a
clever balcony stage design
which allows the original
couple to be five feet away
from each other without se
eing one another. This ar
rangement heightens the
sense of absurdity and allows
the comic side of the play to
show without embarrassment
over its limited view of the
world. In the second scene,
however, the general mood
and set tends so toward realism
that this sense of absurd de
tachment is lost.
Shallow
While the Palo Alto Players
present the play with skill, they
should have seen the shallow
ness of the humor, and
worked with it, instead of
against it, which they did by
taking it all too seriously. The
play, not the players, borders
on an insult to the intelligence.
While the production was spi
rited, one might, unless one
has a taste for Neil Simon, con
sider sticking with the next
production of Ibsen in the
area.

Tom Woosnam and Nina DuVal in Noel Coward's Private Lives, now
playing at the Palo Alto Community Theatre.
It is entirely ridiculous and
vain to wish that Noel Coward
wrote plays more like Henrik
Ibsen's, but Coward's Private
Lives deserves the compari
son. Both artists are interested
in the lives of intelligent,
affluent, middle-class people.
Coward's witty dialogue will
provoke some chuckles from
the most sober of morally abso
lute viewers. Ultimately, how
ever, the play is a clever but
innocuous diversion, mainly
for cynical affluent couples of
the type Coward depicts.
All the acid, self-critical
humor Coward is known for
amounts to nothing by the
finale of Private Lives. Ibsen
took the trouble to describe
the profound problems which
he felt had infected Norweigan
society. Coward self
consciously toys with moral
contradictions of the 1930-ish
British well-to-do. But Coward
can't get any more out of the
material than a well-paced bar
rage of one-liners similar to
Neil Simon's plays. By ignoring
the serious side of his charac
ters almost entirely, Coward
leaves a sickeningly sweet taste
in the mouth, like a martini
with too much vermouth.
If a light-hearted snicker at
bourgeois love and manners is

what you need or want, Private
Lives deserves a chance on its
own terms.
The Coward hero, that
good-looking, perfectly man
nered fellow sipping his
cocktail, who turns to his wife
on the romantic terrace of a
Biarritz hotel and says suavely,
"I'd rather like to chop off your
head with a dull meat cleaver,"
doesn't bore. His problem is
that he lacks substance as a
comic character in the final
weigh-in. He is never de
veloped. He needs the total
misery of lames Thurber's
nightmare cocktail sippers. He
already has the nastiness, the
cynicism, but his self-loathing
doesn't go deep enough. Al
though he says "To hell with
love," he doesn't believe it.
Plot
Private Lives is the story of a
Coward husband and wife, di
vorced for five years, who meet
in the south of France when
each is honeymooning with a
new love. Each has married a
young and innocent pushover
whom they could never love
deeply.
The original couple meet by
chance, fall quickly back in
love, and escape to Paris. Their
deserted spouses join forces
and pursue them there, and
they discover that the Coward
ly pair have decided to split up
again. After a climactic tea
party the Coward hero and his
old wife realize that they were
made for each other after all
and escape out the back way,
leaving the deserted man and
woman in a violent argument
that in a Coward play smells
strongly of blossoming love.
Energy
The Palo Alto Players leap
onto Noel Coward's Private
Lives with energy and sincerity
that make it an entertaining
piece of light comedy with
some amateurish touches. The
play, which director Montroni
calls "wickedly frolicsome,"
offers an opportunity for the
fairly slick company to toy
"wickedly" with the ideals of

love among the affluent
bourgeois. As Coward himself
said, "There is actually more to
the play than this, but not very
much."
Brian Lucas attacks the cent
ral part of spotless, yet entirely
corrupt Elyot Chase with great
energy, but he only succeeds
in beating the life out of it. Ini
tially, the aristocratic British
accent which the part demands
slows his whole character. Past
this, he cannot communicate
the flawless manners and per
fect form which make Elyot
Chase as appleaing to the
ladies as he must be.
The character requires a
clipped, decidedly conclusive
tone which charms as well as
stabs, a mixture of inhuman
detachment and very human
feelings. Mr. Lucas muddles
through the part, slurring his
words, his attitudes and his
posture.
Authentic
Surprisingly, Louisa Hart as
his first wife, Amanda, catches
the extravagant charm of this
social class, and presents as
well the bitter sarcasm of her
disappointed character. Physi
cally, she sparkles with gaudily
made-up eyes and a pouting
sensual mouth. Long thin arms
and fingers, and a slinky way of
moving give her character an
aristocratic sense of languid
self-indulgence. Even her ac
cent sounds nasal and clipped
enough to pass as authentic.
Ms. Hart is truly the delight of
the play when her energy and
concentration seem on; when
she loses the spark, she be
comes almost as flat as Mr.
Lucas.
David Montroni directs the
action with a light and natural

air. Some awkward stage busi
ness arrives in a poorly
choreographed fight between
Elyot and Amanda. The final
moments of the play, which are
important to the idea of love's
constant renewal, also came
out confused and awkward.
Montroni decides to let the
play unfold on its own terms,
rather than to comment on its
dated humour through, say, a
tongue-in-cheek presentation,
or some other perspective on
the action.
The first scene is set in a
clever balcony stage design
which allows the original
couple to be five feet away
from each other without se
eing one another. This ar
rangement heightens the
sense of absurdity and allows
the comic side of the play to
show without embarrassment
over its limited view of the
world. In the second scene,
however, the general mood
and set tends so toward realism
that this sense of absurd de
tachment is lost.
Shallow
While the Palo Alto Players
present the play with skill, they
should have seen the shallow
ness of the humor, and
worked with it, instead of
against it, which they did by
taking it all too seriously. The
play, not the players, borders
on an insult to the intelligence.
While the production was spi
rited, one might, unless one
has a taste for Neil Simon, con
sider sticking with the next
production of Ibsen in the
area.
