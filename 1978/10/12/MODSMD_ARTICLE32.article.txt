## On being a transvestite 
### 
The Elocution of Benja
min Franklin is the portrait
of Robert O'Brien, an over
weight, aging speech
therapist, a failed actor and
a transvestite. The play
comes to the U.S. at a time
when Anita Bryant heads a
religious crusade against
homosexuality and Califor
nians are about to vote on
Proposition 6.
The play was written by
Australian Steve Spears, and
Cordon Chater has played
the O'Brien role continu
ously for the last two years
in Australia and London.
Chater creates the world
of O'Brien, the conversa
tions he has with his pupils,
their parents, his boyfriend
and his landlady in a master
ful way. Chater forces the
audience to put their pre
judices aside and laugh at
the absurdity and cruelty of
life.
O'Brien is a man obses
sed with his sexuality and
imprisoned by it; first bet
ween the red velvet
covered walls of his Sydney
apartment, and later, in the
play's second half, in an
asylum.
Clandestine life
In a society that is hostile,
O'Brien has to lead a clan
destine life. His life is ruled

by the cuckoo clock that
hangs in the living room and
blares out the hours, and by
the bust of William Shakes
peare that oversees O'B
rien's life.
Work is no consolation
for O'Brien. He hates hav
ing his mornings inter
rupted by stuttering and
lisping pupils. He would
prefer to fantasize with the
poster of Mick Jagger which
is conveniently hidden be
hind his desk.
Relationships do not
work either. O'Brien is an
egotist; for him "ego is not a
dirty word" and he is full of
vanity.
Yet he is incredibly insec
ure. This is clear from his
relationship with his boyf
riend Bruce, who works in
the stock exchange, is mar
ried and has two children.
Uncomfortable
O'Brien does not feel al
together comfortable play
ing the role required of him
by Bruce. In his blond wig,
his heavily made-up face,
his pink panties, bra and
dressing-gown with feath
ers, O'Brien looks pitiful.
He is a cheap imitation, a
gross exaggeration of a
woman.
The play raises an in
teresting question about

the search for identity by
the O'Brien's of this world
who are denied an identity
not only by society but by
the very nature of who they
are so desperately trying to
imitate.
O'Brien's major problem
is that he falls in love with
his 12-year-old pupil Ben
jamin Franklin who he dis
covers is also gay and who
attempts to seduce him.
He explains to him the
impossibility of any relation
between them.
Redundant
The second half of the
play is perhaps redundant.
It expands on the prejudice
and intolerance of a society
that claims to be civilized.
It shows him eight years
later a destroyed, drugged
hulk of a man afraid of los
ing his soul who has nothing
left to do save to commit
suicide.
The music plays the Rol
ling Stones' You Can't Al
ways Get What You Want.
The evening is a captivat
ing one but the price of tic
kets is rather steep with no
student rush available. Per
formances run through the
end of this month. At the
Alcaraz theater in San Fran
cisco. For information call
