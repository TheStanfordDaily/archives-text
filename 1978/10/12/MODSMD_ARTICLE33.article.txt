## Van Morrison lets vocals rip 
### 
Van Morrison sings with a lot
of emotion and a lot of force.
Most performers have a certain
intensity which captures the at
tention of their audiences. For
some it comes from their ap
pearance, for some from their
instruments, for others from
their movements. For Van, it
comes from his voice.
Over the years, Morrison's
music has changed and de
veloped, although not dramat
ically. His new songs involve
many more electronically pro
duced sounds and come off
slightly more cleaner and
smoother than his past work.
His themes are still basic and
empathetic. Morrison's lyrics,
which never have been marked
by profundity, seem even less
so. Yet any changes, which are
mostly a product of new musi
cal standards, still play second
fiddle to his deep, driving voc
als.

And Morrison's vocals
dominated his show at the Old
Waldorf last week. He strode
in, and before a capacity audi
ence, the short, stocky rock
star began to bellow.
Morrison opened his per
formance with his most popu
lar song, "Moondance." His
voice filled the room and
dominated the instruments
that accompanied him.
It was a great way to gain the
support of the crowd right
from the start — by playing its
favorite song. Van then fol
lowed with a song he must
hope will become just as popu
lar: the title track from his new
album, Wavelength.
Mixture
As he captured the en
thusiasm of those in atten
dance with his first two big
songs, he maintained a high
level of excitement throughout
the show with a well con
structed arrangement of

songs. Just as most of his songs
seem to fluctuate between a
slow pace and a quickened
one, leading to a climactic
build-up, so did the pace of the
concert.
There were three unex
pected, but pleasant, high
lights of the show which merit
recognition. The first was the
Old Waldorf itself. Its size and
design is such that people can
feel a part of the show, instead
of being relegated to a distant
spectator. It was good to be
able to share in the emotions
and actions of the band for a
change.
Success
Big halls seem to accompany
success. But that all depends
on how one defines success.
For Van Morrison's perfor
mance over the weekend came
as close as possible to what
must be meant by success —
he entertained everyone in the
show through to the third and

final encore — and he sold out
six shows.
The second feature was that
the show opened, not with a
dull warm up band which just
frustrates everyone's anticipa
tion, but with a comedian —
Marty Cohen.
The third was a vibrant
young singer from Van's band
named Katy Bussoon, whose
talent combined with her
beauty was enjoyable to view
and hear. She sang a rendition
of "Give me love, love, love"
which really added to the
show.
Van must be reaching the
pinnacle of his career. He has
produced a plethora of suc
cessful songs and albums over
the years. His latest album
beckons for the recognition
which it deserves and should
receive. He has an extremely
talented and well diversified
band. And he's still got his
voice.

the show with a well con
structed arrangement of

songs. Just as most of his songs
seem to fluctuate between a
slow pace and a quickened
one, leading to a climactic
build-up, so did the pace of the
concert.
There were three unex
pected, but pleasant, high
lights of the show which merit
recognition. The first was the
Old Waldorf itself. Its size and
design is such that people can
feel a part of the show, instead
of being relegated to a distant
spectator. It was good to be
able to share in the emotions
and actions of the band for a
change.
Success
Big halls seem to accompany
success. But that all depends
on how one defines success.
For Van Morrison's perfor
mance over the weekend came
as close as possible to what
must be meant by success —
he entertained everyone in the
show through to the third and

final encore — and he sold out
six shows.
The second feature was that
the show opened, not with a
dull warm up band which just
frustrates everyone's anticipa
tion, but with a comedian —
Marty Cohen.
The third was a vibrant
young singer from Van's band
named Katy Bussoon, whose
talent combined with her
beauty was enjoyable to view
and hear. She sang a rendition
of "Give me love, love, love"
which really added to the
show.
Van must be reaching the
pinnacle of his career. He has
produced a plethora of suc
cessful songs and albums over
the years. His latest album
beckons for the recognition
which it deserves and should
receive. He has an extremely
talented and well diversified
band. And he's still got his
voice.
Van Morrison sings with a lot
of emotion and a lot of force.
Most performers have a certain
intensity which captures the at
tention of their audiences. For
some it comes from their ap
pearance, for some from their
instruments, for others from
their movements. For Van, it
comes from his voice.
Over the years, Morrison's
music has changed and de
veloped, although not dramat
ically. His new songs involve
many more electronically pro
duced sounds and come off
slightly more cleaner and
smoother than his past work.
His themes are still basic and
empathetic. Morrison's lyrics,
which never have been marked
by profundity, seem even less
so. Yet any changes, which are
mostly a product of new musi
cal standards, still play second
fiddle to his deep, driving voc
als.

And Morrison's vocals
dominated his show at the Old
Waldorf last week. He strode
in, and before a capacity audi
ence, the short, stocky rock
star began to bellow.
Morrison opened his per
formance with his most popu
lar song, "Moondance." His
voice filled the room and
dominated the instruments
that accompanied him.
It was a great way to gain the
support of the crowd right
from the start — by playing its
favorite song. Van then fol
lowed with a song he must
hope will become just as popu
lar: the title track from his new
album, Wavelength.
Mixture
As he captured the en
thusiasm of those in atten
dance with his first two big
songs, he maintained a high
level of excitement throughout
the show with a well con
structed arrangement of

songs. Just as most of his songs
seem to fluctuate between a
slow pace and a quickened
one, leading to a climactic
build-up, so did the pace of the
