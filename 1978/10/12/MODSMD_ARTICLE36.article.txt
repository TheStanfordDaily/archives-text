## On an excellent Zoo Story and a bad American Dream 
### 
Edward Albee gave a lecture
Sunday in Memorial Au
ditorium. He called it"The Play
wright versus the Theater."
Among other things, Albee
spoke of the natural friction
between actors, directors,
writers and audiences — he ar
gued that this tension is rooted
primarily in the distance bet
ween the parties mentioned.
"It's a long way from your head
to the audience," Albee said,
and for the most part this
statement stood dead center in
his lecture. According to Al
bee, theater today has more
than its share of mis-direction,
and equally as many audiences
short on the qualities essential
to a proper understanding of
drama. All too often, Albee
said, directors do not under
stand the dramatic material
they deal with — they are
prone to revise what a playw
right has created to suit a
warped interpretation. Albee
added that matters are compli
cated by crowds "who pay to
sit in the first six rows because
its stylish" and not because
they wish to fully grasp that
which they see and hear.
The problem, then, was one
of a lack of alignment, and of
materials lost in transit — the
implied solutions were im
proved perceptions and grea
ter communication. Less dis
tance, said Albee, makes for
better theater — the closer the
heads, the better the chance of
a playwright hitting his target.
Albee's speech was followed
on Monday by productions of
two of his plays, presumably
designed to exemplify the ad
vantages of self-direction. The
logic was that the creator of a
work understands his product
best, and therefore, when di
recting, should have a natural
advantage. If successful, the
plays would indicate that Albee
is best directed by Albee, and if
they failed it would do great
damage to the point made in
his speech. Failure could imply
that friction was essential to
proper presentation, or that
Albee the director and Albee
the writer didn't understand
each other.
It was only natural to view
the plays in the context of the
speech, and just as tempting to
view what happened as reflec
tion of Albee's theory.
Yet if it was a test, the results
were decidedly inconclusive.
The two plays staged on Mon
day had very little in common.
One seemed to show that
Albee was a bad director, that
he could not stage his ideas —
the other was a triumph offer
ing proof of staging skill. The

productions were The Ameri
can Dream and Zoo Story ; the
former was lacking nearly ev
erything that made the latter
successful.
• • •
Albee won the Foreign Press
Association Award for Dream,
which is a one-act attack on its
title — perhaps the greatest
strength behind the play is
its arsenal of techniques. The
ridicule is sophisticated. One
of the characters in the play de
scribes the work as "a com
edy," but that isn't quite accu
rate — it is wry, to be sure, but
the tone of the play refuses to
be nailed down. It is good na
tured, and then deadly serious,
and then practically nonsensi
cal, and much of its power is
rooted in this unpredictability.
Albee sets out in Dream to un
settle not only those dreamers
onstage, but also to uproot his
audience, and to keep ahead of
critics.
At least that's what I thought
until the playwright directed
his play. In this production the
complexity was lost in an ex
tremely broad presentation, in
which most of the actors
seemed to play deliberate
characatures. Lines were deli
vered in such a way as to im
mediately please the audience,
and as a result it was difficult to
keep from being bored. With
one exception it didn't seem
that the actors were to blame
— it seemed as if they were

under orders to overplay their
parts. This production insisted
that it was not to be taken seri
ously, and it thereby failed to
be much more than a long,
loud, on-and-off series of
jokes.
It was, in short, badly di
rected. The fault was Albee's.
Dream pointed up something
that the playwright had
perhaps not dealt with fully in
the previous days' speech — it
showed that a good direction is
not insured by a full under
standing of a play. In many
ways the two are separate and
distinct. Knowing what to say is
not the same as knowing how
to make it heard. For example,
in this production the part of
Grandma was played by a
young woman acting old, and
Albee insisted that that was the
idea, that it was part of the
point of the production. And it
might have been a good idea, if
the end effect had inspired a
feeling that the failure to seem
grandmotherly was intentional
— it didn't, though, and
seemed instead to be nothing
more than miscasting. It didn't
strike the audience, as Albee
apparently intended, as part of
a plan to undermine our pre
conceptions. It just seemed
like bad acting, and it greatly
hurt the play.
And so the first half of "Al
bee directs Albee" was very
disappointing, primarily be
cause of the distance between

the playwright and the direc
tor. Needless to say, this was
especially unsettling, because
the playwright was the direc
tor. It made one wonder about
his speech, and about howthat
speech compounded our
sense of disappointment by
listing theatrical problems that
the speaker himself could not

deal with.
But that's far too harsh in
light of the success of the rest
of the program. "Albee directs
Albee" also featured a tre
mendous presentation of Zoo
Story, that one act brief en
counter on a Central Park
bench. It was Albee's first play
— a winner of the Vernon Rice

Award — when properly put
together it is one of his best.
There are only two characters
in the play, one of whom must
be able to sustain a 25-minute
monologue called "The Story
of Jerry and the Dog"; proper
casting, needless to say, is the
life or death of the production.
Albee's casting was marvel
ous. Stephen Rowe had none
of the trouble that he had had
in Dream — he seemed freer
here, and less inclined to speak
as if he were part of some giant
allegory. Rowe's timing and
sense of humor found a perfect
home in Jerry's desperate
brain, and his dramatic talent
kept the audience aware of the
malignant nature of Jerry's
situation.
An actor is different from a
stand-up comedian, and Jerry
may be one of the best theatri
cal illustrations of why this is
true — Rowe did his part jus
tice by never beingfunny at the
expense of being human. He
wandered all over the all-but
empty stage in directions that
only very rarely seemed pre
determined, and his spon
taneity was never divorced
from an ominous sense of pur

pose. He seemed very much in
tune with the playwright.
And Rowe's performance
found great support in the ta
lents of Michael Miller. Miller
played Peter, a businessman
whose quiet afternoon and
middle-class contentment are
obliterated by an intruder from
uptown — he was more than a
straight man and as such lent
support to the play's strange
sense of continuity. The in
teraction between Miller and
Rowe was hardly ever forced,
and as a result Jerry's meander
ings almost always have a
target; this Zoo Story was
dramatically smooth because it
was professionally tight. It was
an excellent example of what
Albee meant when he spoke of
the importance of aligning di
rectors with actors and with
playwrights. It was a very good
production.
Edward Albee's visit to Stan
ford was an event from which I
find it all but impossible to
draw conclusions. Sometimes
Albee can direct himself, and
sometimes he has trouble —
theater, it seems to me, is im
possibly complex.
Maybe that was the point.

production.

Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story"
Edward Albee gave a lecture
Sunday in Memorial Au
ditorium. He called it"The Play
wright versus the Theater."
Among other things, Albee
spoke of the natural friction
between actors, directors,
writers and audiences — he ar
gued that this tension is rooted
primarily in the distance bet
ween the parties mentioned.
"It's a long way from your head
to the audience," Albee said,
and for the most part this
statement stood dead center in
his lecture. According to Al
bee, theater today has more
than its share of mis-direction,
and equally as many audiences
short on the qualities essential
to a proper understanding of
drama. All too often, Albee
said, directors do not under
stand the dramatic material
they deal with — they are
prone to revise what a playw
right has created to suit a
warped interpretation. Albee
added that matters are compli
cated by crowds "who pay to
sit in the first six rows because
its stylish" and not because
they wish to fully grasp that
which they see and hear.
The problem, then, was one
of a lack of alignment, and of
materials lost in transit — the
implied solutions were im
proved perceptions and grea
ter communication. Less dis
tance, said Albee, makes for
better theater — the closer the
heads, the better the chance of
a playwright hitting his target.
Albee's speech was followed
on Monday by productions of
two of his plays, presumably
designed to exemplify the ad
vantages of self-direction. The
logic was that the creator of a
work understands his product
best, and therefore, when di
recting, should have a natural
advantage. If successful, the
plays would indicate that Albee
is best directed by Albee, and if
they failed it would do great
damage to the point made in
his speech. Failure could imply
that friction was essential to
proper presentation, or that
Albee the director and Albee
the writer didn't understand
each other.
It was only natural to view
the plays in the context of the
speech, and just as tempting to
view what happened as reflec
tion of Albee's theory.
Yet if it was a test, the results
were decidedly inconclusive.
The two plays staged on Mon
day had very little in common.
One seemed to show that
Albee was a bad director, that
he could not stage his ideas —
the other was a triumph offer
ing proof of staging skill. The

productions were The Ameri
can Dream and Zoo Story ; the
former was lacking nearly ev
erything that made the latter
successful.
• • •
Albee won the Foreign Press
Association Award for Dream,
which is a one-act attack on its
title — perhaps the greatest
strength behind the play is
its arsenal of techniques. The
ridicule is sophisticated. One
of the characters in the play de
scribes the work as "a com
edy," but that isn't quite accu
rate — it is wry, to be sure, but
the tone of the play refuses to
be nailed down. It is good na
tured, and then deadly serious,
and then practically nonsensi
cal, and much of its power is
rooted in this unpredictability.
Albee sets out in Dream to un
settle not only those dreamers
onstage, but also to uproot his
audience, and to keep ahead of
critics.
At least that's what I thought
until the playwright directed
his play. In this production the
complexity was lost in an ex
tremely broad presentation, in
which most of the actors
seemed to play deliberate
characatures. Lines were deli
vered in such a way as to im
mediately please the audience,
and as a result it was difficult to
keep from being bored. With
one exception it didn't seem
that the actors were to blame
— it seemed as if they were

under orders to overplay their
parts. This production insisted
that it was not to be taken seri
ously, and it thereby failed to
be much more than a long,
loud, on-and-off series of
jokes.
It was, in short, badly di
rected. The fault was Albee's.
Dream pointed up something
that the playwright had
perhaps not dealt with fully in
the previous days' speech — it
showed that a good direction is
not insured by a full under
standing of a play. In many
ways the two are separate and
distinct. Knowing what to say is
not the same as knowing how
to make it heard. For example,
in this production the part of
Grandma was played by a
young woman acting old, and
Albee insisted that that was the
idea, that it was part of the
point of the production. And it
might have been a good idea, if
the end effect had inspired a
feeling that the failure to seem
grandmotherly was intentional
— it didn't, though, and
seemed instead to be nothing
more than miscasting. It didn't
strike the audience, as Albee
apparently intended, as part of
a plan to undermine our pre
conceptions. It just seemed
like bad acting, and it greatly
hurt the play.
And so the first half of "Al
bee directs Albee" was very
disappointing, primarily be
cause of the distance between

the playwright and the direc
tor. Needless to say, this was
especially unsettling, because
the playwright was the direc
tor. It made one wonder about
his speech, and about howthat
speech compounded our
sense of disappointment by
listing theatrical problems that
the speaker himself could not

deal with.
But that's far too harsh in
light of the success of the rest
of the program. "Albee directs
Albee" also featured a tre
mendous presentation of Zoo
Story, that one act brief en
counter on a Central Park
bench. It was Albee's first play
— a winner of the Vernon Rice

Award — when properly put
together it is one of his best.
There are only two characters
in the play, one of whom must
be able to sustain a 25-minute
monologue called "The Story
of Jerry and the Dog"; proper
casting, needless to say, is the
life or death of the production.
Albee's casting was marvel
ous. Stephen Rowe had none
of the trouble that he had had
in Dream — he seemed freer
here, and less inclined to speak
as if he were part of some giant
allegory. Rowe's timing and
sense of humor found a perfect
home in Jerry's desperate
brain, and his dramatic talent
kept the audience aware of the
malignant nature of Jerry's
situation.
An actor is different from a
stand-up comedian, and Jerry
may be one of the best theatri
cal illustrations of why this is
true — Rowe did his part jus
tice by never beingfunny at the
expense of being human. He
wandered all over the all-but
empty stage in directions that
only very rarely seemed pre
determined, and his spon
taneity was never divorced
from an ominous sense of pur

pose. He seemed very much in
tune with the playwright.
And Rowe's performance

casting, needless to say, is the

Albee's casting was marvel
ous. Stephen Rowe had none
of the trouble that he had had
in Dream — he seemed freer
here, and less inclined to speak
as if he were part of some giant
allegory. Rowe's timing and
sense of humor found a perfect
home in Jerry's desperate
brain, and his dramatic talent
kept the audience aware of the
malignant nature of Jerry's
situation.
An actor is different from a
stand-up comedian, and Jerry
may be one of the best theatri
cal illustrations of why this is
true — Rowe did his part jus
tice by never beingfunny at the
expense of being human. He
wandered all over the all-but
empty stage in directions that
only very rarely seemed pre
determined, and his spon
taneity was never divorced
from an ominous sense of pur

pose. He seemed very much in
tune with the playwright.
And Rowe's performance
found great support in the ta
lents of Michael Miller. Miller
played Peter, a businessman
whose quiet afternoon and
middle-class contentment are
obliterated by an intruder from
uptown — he was more than a
straight man and as such lent
support to the play's strange
sense of continuity. The in
teraction between Miller and
Rowe was hardly ever forced,
and as a result Jerry's meander
ings almost always have a
target; this Zoo Story was
dramatically smooth because it
was professionally tight. It was
an excellent example of what
Albee meant when he spoke of
the importance of aligning di
rectors with actors and with
playwrights. It was a very good
production.
Edward Albee's visit to Stan
ford was an event from which I
find it all but impossible to
draw conclusions. Sometimes
Albee can direct himself, and
sometimes he has trouble —
theater, it seems to me, is im
possibly complex.

Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story"
Edward Albee gave a lecture
Sunday in Memorial Au
ditorium. He called it"The Play
wright versus the Theater."
Among other things, Albee
spoke of the natural friction
between actors, directors,
writers and audiences — he ar
gued that this tension is rooted
primarily in the distance bet
ween the parties mentioned.
"It's a long way from your head
to the audience," Albee said,
and for the most part this
statement stood dead center in
his lecture. According to Al
bee, theater today has more
than its share of mis-direction,
and equally as many audiences
short on the qualities essential
to a proper understanding of
drama. All too often, Albee
said, directors do not under
stand the dramatic material
they deal with — they are
prone to revise what a playw
right has created to suit a
warped interpretation. Albee
added that matters are compli
cated by crowds "who pay to
sit in the first six rows because
its stylish" and not because
they wish to fully grasp that
which they see and hear.
The problem, then, was one
of a lack of alignment, and of
materials lost in transit — the
implied solutions were im
proved perceptions and grea
ter communication. Less dis
tance, said Albee, makes for
better theater — the closer the
heads, the better the chance of
a playwright hitting his target.
Albee's speech was followed
on Monday by productions of
two of his plays, presumably
designed to exemplify the ad
vantages of self-direction. The
logic was that the creator of a
work understands his product
best, and therefore, when di
recting, should have a natural
advantage. If successful, the
plays would indicate that Albee
is best directed by Albee, and if
they failed it would do great
damage to the point made in
his speech. Failure could imply
that friction was essential to
proper presentation, or that
Albee the director and Albee
the writer didn't understand
each other.
It was only natural to view
the plays in the context of the
speech, and just as tempting to
view what happened as reflec
tion of Albee's theory.
Yet if it was a test, the results
were decidedly inconclusive.
The two plays staged on Mon
day had very little in common.
One seemed to show that
Albee was a bad director, that
he could not stage his ideas —
the other was a triumph offer
ing proof of staging skill. The

productions were The Ameri
can Dream and Zoo Story ; the
former was lacking nearly ev
erything that made the latter
successful.
• • •
Albee won the Foreign Press
Association Award for Dream,
which is a one-act attack on its
title — perhaps the greatest
strength behind the play is
its arsenal of techniques. The
ridicule is sophisticated. One
of the characters in the play de
scribes the work as "a com
edy," but that isn't quite accu
rate — it is wry, to be sure, but
the tone of the play refuses to
be nailed down. It is good na
tured, and then deadly serious,
and then practically nonsensi
cal, and much of its power is
rooted in this unpredictability.
Albee sets out in Dream to un
settle not only those dreamers
onstage, but also to uproot his
audience, and to keep ahead of
critics.
At least that's what I thought
until the playwright directed
his play. In this production the
complexity was lost in an ex
tremely broad presentation, in
which most of the actors
seemed to play deliberate
characatures. Lines were deli
vered in such a way as to im
mediately please the audience,
and as a result it was difficult to
keep from being bored. With
one exception it didn't seem
that the actors were to blame
— it seemed as if they were

under orders to overplay their
parts. This production insisted
that it was not to be taken seri
ously, and it thereby failed to
be much more than a long,
loud, on-and-off series of
jokes.
It was, in short, badly di
rected. The fault was Albee's.
Dream pointed up something
that the playwright had
perhaps not dealt with fully in
the previous days' speech — it
showed that a good direction is
not insured by a full under
standing of a play. In many
ways the two are separate and
distinct. Knowing what to say is
not the same as knowing how
to make it heard. For example,
in this production the part of
Grandma was played by a
young woman acting old, and
Albee insisted that that was the
idea, that it was part of the
point of the production. And it
might have been a good idea, if
the end effect had inspired a
feeling that the failure to seem
grandmotherly was intentional
— it didn't, though, and
seemed instead to be nothing
more than miscasting. It didn't
strike the audience, as Albee
apparently intended, as part of
a plan to undermine our pre
conceptions. It just seemed
like bad acting, and it greatly
hurt the play.
And so the first half of "Al
bee directs Albee" was very
disappointing, primarily be
cause of the distance between

the playwright and the direc
tor. Needless to say, this was
especially unsettling, because
the playwright was the direc
tor. It made one wonder about
his speech, and about howthat
speech compounded our
sense of disappointment by
listing theatrical problems that
the speaker himself could not

deal with.
But that's far too harsh in
light of the success of the rest
of the program. "Albee directs
Albee" also featured a tre
mendous presentation of Zoo
Story, that one act brief en
counter on a Central Park
bench. It was Albee's first play
— a winner of the Vernon Rice

Award — when properly put
together it is one of his best.
There are only two characters
in the play, one of whom must
be able to sustain a 25-minute
monologue called "The Story
of Jerry and the Dog"; proper
casting, needless to say, is the
life or death of the production.

hurt the play.
And so the first half of "Al
bee directs Albee" was very
disappointing, primarily be
cause of the distance between

the playwright and the direc
tor. Needless to say, this was
especially unsettling, because
the playwright was the direc
tor. It made one wonder about
his speech, and about howthat
speech compounded our
sense of disappointment by
listing theatrical problems that
the speaker himself could not

deal with.
But that's far too harsh in
light of the success of the rest
of the program. "Albee directs
Albee" also featured a tre
mendous presentation of Zoo
Story, that one act brief en
counter on a Central Park
bench. It was Albee's first play
— a winner of the Vernon Rice

Award — when properly put
together it is one of his best.
There are only two characters
in the play, one of whom must
be able to sustain a 25-minute
monologue called "The Story
of Jerry and the Dog"; proper
casting, needless to say, is the
life or death of the production.
Albee's casting was marvel
ous. Stephen Rowe had none
of the trouble that he had had
in Dream — he seemed freer
here, and less inclined to speak
as if he were part of some giant
allegory. Rowe's timing and
sense of humor found a perfect
home in Jerry's desperate
brain, and his dramatic talent
kept the audience aware of the
malignant nature of Jerry's
situation.
An actor is different from a
stand-up comedian, and Jerry
may be one of the best theatri
cal illustrations of why this is
true — Rowe did his part jus
tice by never beingfunny at the
expense of being human. He
wandered all over the all-but
empty stage in directions that
only very rarely seemed pre
determined, and his spon
taneity was never divorced
from an ominous sense of pur

pose. He seemed very much in
tune with the playwright.
And Rowe's performance
found great support in the ta
lents of Michael Miller. Miller
played Peter, a businessman
whose quiet afternoon and
middle-class contentment are
obliterated by an intruder from
uptown — he was more than a
straight man and as such lent
support to the play's strange
sense of continuity. The in
teraction between Miller and
Rowe was hardly ever forced,
and as a result Jerry's meander
ings almost always have a
target; this Zoo Story was
dramatically smooth because it
was professionally tight. It was
an excellent example of what
Albee meant when he spoke of
the importance of aligning di
rectors with actors and with
playwrights. It was a very good
production.
Edward Albee's visit to Stan
ford was an event from which I
find it all but impossible to
draw conclusions. Sometimes
Albee can direct himself, and
sometimes he has trouble —
theater, it seems to me, is im
possibly complex.
Maybe that was the point.

Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story"
Edward Albee gave a lecture
Sunday in Memorial Au
ditorium. He called it"The Play
wright versus the Theater."
Among other things, Albee
spoke of the natural friction
between actors, directors,
writers and audiences — he ar
gued that this tension is rooted
primarily in the distance bet
ween the parties mentioned.
"It's a long way from your head
to the audience," Albee said,
and for the most part this
statement stood dead center in
his lecture. According to Al
bee, theater today has more
than its share of mis-direction,
and equally as many audiences
short on the qualities essential
to a proper understanding of
drama. All too often, Albee
said, directors do not under
stand the dramatic material
they deal with — they are
prone to revise what a playw
right has created to suit a
warped interpretation. Albee
added that matters are compli
cated by crowds "who pay to
sit in the first six rows because
its stylish" and not because
they wish to fully grasp that
which they see and hear.
The problem, then, was one
of a lack of alignment, and of
materials lost in transit — the
implied solutions were im
proved perceptions and grea
ter communication. Less dis
tance, said Albee, makes for
better theater — the closer the
heads, the better the chance of
a playwright hitting his target.
Albee's speech was followed
on Monday by productions of
two of his plays, presumably
designed to exemplify the ad
vantages of self-direction. The
logic was that the creator of a
work understands his product
best, and therefore, when di
recting, should have a natural
advantage. If successful, the
plays would indicate that Albee
is best directed by Albee, and if
they failed it would do great
damage to the point made in
his speech. Failure could imply
that friction was essential to
proper presentation, or that
Albee the director and Albee
the writer didn't understand
each other.
It was only natural to view
the plays in the context of the
speech, and just as tempting to
view what happened as reflec
tion of Albee's theory.
Yet if it was a test, the results
were decidedly inconclusive.
The two plays staged on Mon
day had very little in common.
One seemed to show that
Albee was a bad director, that
he could not stage his ideas —
the other was a triumph offer
ing proof of staging skill. The

productions were The Ameri
can Dream and Zoo Story ; the
former was lacking nearly ev
erything that made the latter
successful.
• • •
Albee won the Foreign Press
Association Award for Dream,
which is a one-act attack on its
title — perhaps the greatest
strength behind the play is
its arsenal of techniques. The
ridicule is sophisticated. One
of the characters in the play de
scribes the work as "a com
edy," but that isn't quite accu
rate — it is wry, to be sure, but
the tone of the play refuses to
be nailed down. It is good na
tured, and then deadly serious,
and then practically nonsensi
cal, and much of its power is
rooted in this unpredictability.
Albee sets out in Dream to un
settle not only those dreamers
onstage, but also to uproot his
audience, and to keep ahead of
critics.
At least that's what I thought
until the playwright directed
his play. In this production the
complexity was lost in an ex
tremely broad presentation, in
which most of the actors
seemed to play deliberate
characatures. Lines were deli
vered in such a way as to im
mediately please the audience,
and as a result it was difficult to
keep from being bored. With
one exception it didn't seem
that the actors were to blame
— it seemed as if they were

under orders to overplay their
parts. This production insisted
that it was not to be taken seri
ously, and it thereby failed to
be much more than a long,
loud, on-and-off series of
jokes.
It was, in short, badly di
rected. The fault was Albee's.
Dream pointed up something
that the playwright had
perhaps not dealt with fully in
the previous days' speech — it
showed that a good direction is
not insured by a full under
standing of a play. In many
ways the two are separate and
distinct. Knowing what to say is
not the same as knowing how
to make it heard. For example,
in this production the part of
Grandma was played by a
young woman acting old, and
Albee insisted that that was the
idea, that it was part of the
point of the production. And it
might have been a good idea, if
the end effect had inspired a
feeling that the failure to seem
grandmotherly was intentional
— it didn't, though, and
seemed instead to be nothing
more than miscasting. It didn't
strike the audience, as Albee
apparently intended, as part of
a plan to undermine our pre
conceptions. It just seemed
like bad acting, and it greatly
hurt the play.
And so the first half of "Al

disappointing, primarily be
cause of the distance between
