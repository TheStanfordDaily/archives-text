Man to be arraigned in rape case
Modesto — Merchant seaman Larry Singleton
was returned to Modesto yesterday for arraign
ment today on charges of raping and mutilating a
15-year-old hitchhiker. Authorities said there was
"nothing to corroborate" his story that he paid the
girl for sex.
Stanislaus County District Attorney Don Stahl
said there was no evidence that Singleton had
picked up two other male hitchhikers after al
legedly picking up the young girl, who was found
wandering along the road, her arms hacked off
below the elbows by an ax.
Arrested last week in Sparks, Nev., Singleton
will be arraigned at 8:30 a.m. today on charges of
kidnap, rape, attempted murder and mayhem in
connection with a brutal attack on Mary Bell Vin
cent on a country road near Modesto about two
weeks ago.
In an affidavit filed by Stanislaus County detec
tives Tuesday in Sparks, Singleton was quoted as
admitting he picked up a young, dark-complected
hitchhiker and had sex with her after paying her
$60, but then passed out in an alcohol stupor.
When he awoke, he told detectives, the girl was
gone and one of the two male hitchhikers he had
picked up earlier was driving.
Talks begin in Blair House today
Washington — Three lines to be drawn in the
sands of the Sinai represent the major obstacles as
Egypt and Israel move their peace talks to Ameri
can soil today.
President Jimmy Carter plans to welcome the
foreign and defense ministers of both countries in
a brief, ceremonial opening session of the con
tinuing negotiations that were begun at the Camp
David summit.
Following the ceremony, the talks are
scheduled to move across the street to Blair
House, the government's guest residence, where
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance plans to represent
the United States. A United Nations flag will fly
over the building while the talks continue.
American optimism about the outcome of the
talks is grounded in the belief that the difficult
issues between the two countries were resolved at
Camp David and in the Israeli Knesset.
Smoke signal system modified
Vatican City — Trying to avoid past confusion
and criticism, the Vatican said yesterday it will

adopt a new — and already secretly tested —
method for raising the smoke signals -that an
nounce the results of voting in papal elections.
The time-honored signals will begin wafting
from the metal chimney atop the Sistine Chapel
Sunday, the second day of the conclave, with
black indicating inconclusive balloting and white
the election of a successor to Pope John Paul I.
Unlike the last conclave Aug. 26, thefirstminute
of smoke will be "controlled," using only Italian
Army flares, Vatican radio said. After 60 seconds
the ballots and notes of 111 cardinal electors will
be burned, as before, raising the possibility that
the color may then change.
The radio advised that only the first minute of
the smoke signal should be considered the seg
ment valid for color.
Brown blamed for busing in L.A.
Long Beach — Attorney General Evelle Younger
said yesterday that Gov. Jerry Brown is responsible
for school busing in Los Angeles, but backtracked
on an earlier allegation that the "Brown Supreme
Court" may have issued a secret ruling on the
death penalty.
Younger said Brown "must be held responsi
ble" for the court-ordered busing program be
cause a little-noticed provision of a Proposition 13
bailout bill signed by the Democratic governor
contained $55 million for busing costs.
Brown, meanwhile, accused Younger of
"squirming" out of his job and "trying to cover his
own misdeeds, his own incompetence" by asking
U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell to intervene in
the FBI investigation of the Legislature.
Oil cutback remains uncertain
Vienna, Austria — Oil cartel officials wound up a
three-day seminar yesterday, firm in a demand for
help from industrial countries to develop their
own petroleum refining industries. But the expor
ters set no deadline for carrying out a threat to cut
back oil supplies if they don't get cooperation.
The call for a joint approach and a dialogue
between crude oil suppliers and consumers was
made by Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah at
the end of the seminar on "downstream opera
tions," or the manufacture of finished petroleum
products, organized by the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries.
Members of OPEC are unhappy that such opera
tions and marketing are dominated by indus
trialized nations. OPEC claims that efforts by

member countries to diversify into refining and
petrochemical industries are being discouraged,
and even obstructed, by the developed nations.
Farber freed to observe holy day
Hackensack, N.J. — New York Times reporter
Myron Farber spent yesterday observing the
Jewish day of atonement and preparing to return
to jail.
Superior Court Judge Theodore Trautwein on
Tuesday ordered that Farber be re-imprisoned for
contempt this morning after the reporter refused
again to surrender his files in the murder trial of a
New Jersey doctor.
Farber said he considered himself protected
from having to hand over the documents by the
U.S. Constitution and by New York and New Jer
sey shield laws.
The judge allowed Farber, who has already
served 27 days in the Bergen County Jail, to remain
free yesterday to observe Yom Kippur, the Jewish
high holy day. He was freed earlier pending appe
als.
