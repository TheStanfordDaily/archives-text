# Europe influenced campus designers
## 
### ANNE GALICICH 
Anyone who has ever noticed the
architectural similarities between the
buildings here on campus and in old
European towns is not mistaken.
According to local architectural
and urban critic Allan Temko, the
sources of the University's original
architectural design include
medieval European towns and Chris
tian missions.
In fact, the original University ar
chitects Frederick Olmstead, H.H.
Richardson and Charles Coolidge,
were strongly influenced by both
European and American structures,
Temko added.
In a lecture Tuesday night entitled
"Past Perfect: Unspoiled California
and the Young University," Temko
compared Memorial Church to Trin
ity Church in Boston, and Palm Drive
with the approach to the Versailles
palace. He said the front of the Quad
does not overpower the viewer with
its magnificence as Versailles does,
but still "holds its own in the envi
ronment."
Although Stanford architecture is
similar to structure elsewhere in
both Europe and the United States,
some aspects are unique, Temko
said. Among these are the red tile
roofs here and the radar dish, which
Temkocalled the "most beautiful ob

ject in the Bay Area aside from the
(Golden Gate) Bridge."
Although Temko dwelled on Stan
ford's architecture, he said that the
"campus atmosphere" stems from
the University's history and the
people here, as well as the architec
tural landmarks.
But Stanford lacks the mixture of
housing and classrooms that enables
students to live closer to their classes
at other universities, he said.
Temko also touched on the ill
fated Memorial Arch fashioned after
a Civil War memorial in New York
State. According to Temko, the loss
of the arch, which stood as the entr
ance to the Quad, in the 1906 ear
thquake was "no great loss."
Building contrasts
Temko said the campus is full of
design contrasts. The massive older
buildings are complemented by intri
cate stonework, and partly-wild ter
rain and "formal geometric abstrac
tion exist side by side."
In closing, Temko said he prefers
the older, more majestic campus
buildings. He added he feels the
newer buildings, including the
Hoover Tower, are "cheap" in com
parison. Next Tuesday evening in
Annenberg Auditorium Temko plans
to discuss the architecture of Stan
ford's modern buildings.
