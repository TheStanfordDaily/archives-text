# Reform or abolish? Senate's future major issue in this year's ASSU race
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Former Sen. Doug Bandow has de
scribed the ASSU Senate's perfor
mance in recent years as "useless,"
and he is not the only student leader
to make that assessment.
Bandow's solution to the problem
is to abolish the senate. He was in
strumental in proposing a constitu
tional amendment which would
eliminate that legislative body.
This amendment, sponsored by
the Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos (CRAP) is on this week's
ASSU ballot.

News analysis

Other student leaders have prop
osed plans which would reform the
senate without abolishing it. Several
of these reform proposals were of
fered last year and are being consi
dered by some candidates in this
election.
During the last two years, the
ASSU Senate has been dominated by
large slates — the Hammer and Cof
fin in 1976 and the Stanford Organiz
ing Committee (SOC) last year.
According to some observers, the
slates did not produce the unified
senate expected by a majority voting
bloc, but instead led to what former
Sen. Rob Docters calls "a fairly nar
row, unrepresentative and often un
productive body of senators."
ERB report
The report of last year's Election
Review Board (ERB) places the se
nate's shortcomings in four general
categories. According to the report,
there is a "lack of information, com

munication and feedback," between
the students and the senate. The pre
sent electoral system produces an
"unresponsive and virtually unac
countable body of legislators."
The report adds that the senate's
own performance in passing unen
forceable resolutions and often fail
ing to meet quorum has caused it to
deserve its reputation for being
"weak, ineffectual, irresponsible
and increasingly ignored."
The report also states that past se
nates and senate elections have dis
couraged students from voting, and
that a "widespread and well
documented cynicism" regarding
the senate has become common.
Districting plan
Former Sen. Tom McCormack last
year drew up a plan to combat these
problems. He proposed partitioning
student residences into geographic
districts, then electing one represen
tative from each area. A districting
system would mean that instead of
each candidate competing for the
votes of the entire student body, a
smaller and more personable cam
paign could be waged, said McCor
mack.
McCormack claimed that his plan
would help elect better senators be
cause students would know candi
dates personally — making those
elected more accountable to the vot
ers.
Staggered elections
As part of the same plan, McCor
mack also suggested staggering elec
tions so that half the senators would
take office in the fall, and half in the
following spring. This would ensure
a more frequent influx of "new
ideas" Fn the senate, while also pro
viding a constant base of experi
enced senators, McCormack said.
However, according to some of

last year's senators, there are several
problems with the districting plan.
Dividing the University and its off
campus and graduate students into
equitable voting districts is not easy.
Student interests do not always fol
low residential borderlines. Some of
the former senators also said
minorities would tend to be under
represented in a districting system
like McCormack's.
'Live petitions'
ERB members last spring proposed
the most novel senate reform plan.
They suggested a system of "live pet
itions" in which no election would
ever be held. Instead, senators
would reach office by collecting the
signatures of 200 student supporters,
and would remain in the senate only
as long as 200 supporters were wil
ling to keep their names on a given
senator's list.
This plan would allow groups of
candidates to fashion their own dis
tricts, said ERB spokesman Deric
Jennings. The plan would also create

small constituencies that would lead
to continued student awareness of a
senator's activities.
Fewer votes
Docters had a different plan. He
said he found that most students cast
an average of only five votes for the
senate although they are allowed 10.
Docters said he reasoned that "those
who cast more (votes) either do so at
random or cast all their votes for a
large slate."
To alleviate this problem, Docters
suggested limiting each student to
only five votes. He said this would
hinder the election of large slates as
well as make students cast their
fewer votes with more care. Yet Doc
ters himself admitted his plan was
only a "reasonable first step." It fails
to deal with the "deeper problems
encountered by the senate," he ad
ded.
If approved by two-thirds of the
students voting, the CRAP proposal
would take effect pending board of
trustee and administrative approval.
