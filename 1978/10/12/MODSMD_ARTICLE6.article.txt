# Inventory shortages hit The Store because of ongoing Teamsters strike in Bay Area
## 
### TONY RUPERT 
Although the shelves have re
mained well-stocked at The Store in
Tresidder Union over the past few
weeks, there have been some inven
tory shortages, according to man
ager John Hyde. The shortages have
been due to the two-month-old
Teamsters strike in Northern
California, he said.
The Store, along with the Univer
sity Hospital, residence halls, frater
nities, eating clubs, row houses and
several departmental snack bars or
ders its food through the Stanford
Commissary. According to Earl Ha
zen, the Commissary orders the food
through United Groceries, Inc., a
large wholesale firm which is not
being struck.
United Groceries swamped
However, the four large grocery
chains that are being struck — Lucky,
Safeway, Alpha Beta and Ralph's —
have swamped United Groceries by
swinging much of their business to
them. This has resulted in orders ar
riving from United Groceries a week
late on the average, and many orders
not arriving at all, according to Ha
zen.
The Commissary has been able to
alleviate the problem partially by
switching some of its orders to other
independent grocery wholesalers
who are unaffected by the strike.
Still, a significant proportion of Uni
versity food orders go through Un

ited Groceries and have been de
layed or not filled, Hazen said.
Hard hit
Hardest hit by the shortages here
has been The Store. The bulk of its
orders are for food prepared for re
tail sale, which is ordered solely
through United Groceries. Resi
dence halls have been less affected
because they order mostly foodstuffs

which the Commissary has been able
to order from other independents.
Teamsters locked out
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, the strike began in August
when two local unions walked out on
the four supermarket chains. Lucky's
responded by refusing to use
Teamsters' services, a tactic known
as a lockout. This action provoked a

strike of all four chains by all eight
local Teamsters unions.
However, a tentative agreement
between the union and the four
supermarket chainswas reached yes
terday, according to Eugene Barry,
director of the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service. He said the
agreement will be voted upon by
union members "soon."
