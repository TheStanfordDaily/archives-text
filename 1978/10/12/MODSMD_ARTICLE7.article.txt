# Liquor for students over 21
## Tresidder may serve beer, wine 
### ART STEIN 
By mid-November, Tresidder Memorial Union may
become the second site on campus to serve liquor,
according to a Tresidder spokesman.
TDS Inc., the company which holds the food service
contracts for both Tresidder and Encina Commons, has
applied for a Tresidder liquor license, said TDS spokes
man George Elliot.
Posted notice
On Sept. 29, TDS posted public notice of an applica
tion to the Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC) for a
liquor license.
The public has 30 days to respond to the notice. After
this period ends, the ABC will decide whether it will
grant the license.
Elliot said he expects that the license request will
probably be granted because of the "good record" the
Encina Commons snack bar has had selling beer since
July 1977.
"Our prime motivations in selling beer and wine are to
enlarge the availability of items that many people want,
and of course to make money," said Elliot.

Possibly within a year, a small pub will be constructed
in Tresidder that will sell beer, wine and pizza or
sandwiches. Elliot said he expects that this will not only
reduce the crowds at the Transition, but will also allow
Tresidder to be used for an entertainment site in the
evenings.
If TDS is granted the license for all of Tresidder, al
coholic beverages will be sold on the ground floor and
will also be available for catered affairs in the lounges
and on the second floor deck.
Beer tap planned
Elliot said TDS plans to install a beer tap in either the
Transition or the Coffee House once the license is
granted.
Beer and wine will be available only to people over the
age of 21.
"It is the responsibility of the licensee to check IDs. If
we don't, the license would be revoked," said Elliot.
"We have had some minors try to buy beer at the
Commons, but we really don't get many young people,"
he added.
