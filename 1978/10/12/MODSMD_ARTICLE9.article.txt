# Roller skater makes state-to-state trek
## 
### 
Forks, Wash. (AP) —
Bearded Gary Feathergill is
wheeling from Winslow,
Wash., to Eureka, Calif., but
not by car, bus or truck.
He's roller-skating.
Pushing himself along
with poles, Feathergill lum
bered into log country this
week, after two minor acci
dents, a number of repairs
and some rain.
Feathergill, who calls
himself "Breeze," was born
in Illinois 26 years ago, but
says he "isn't really from
anywhere."
Most of his possessions
trail along behind him, en
cased in a walnut cart,
adorned with brass hinges
and strapped to his hips
with a backpacker's belt.
Traveling is Breeze's
fulltime avocation. He says
he once racked up 25,000
hitchhiking miles in 12
months, and last year bicy
cled around Great Britain.
He worked as a painter in
Alaska and at the Artie Circle
not too long ago, then vis
ited his brother in La
Grande, Ore., where he de
cided to do his roller
skating thing and fashioned
his cart.
He loaded the cart with
some clothes, a sleeping
bag, tarp, pots and pans,
granola, lentils, oatmeal,
othervegetarian provisions,

candles and a book of En
glish poets. He also carries a
pad to record his adven
tures, which he hopes to
turn into a book someday.
He left Winslow on Mon
day, but a wooden pin in his
hitch malfunctioned and he
had to go back for a metal
bolt.
A Rolling Bay couple
stopped to help. "They
picked me up and put the
cart into their wagon and
drove me back to Winslow
where I picked up a bolt,"
Feathergill said.
He got out of the station
wagon at the top of a hill. "I
had it really in good control
but then I came to a place
where two kinds of pave
ment come together and I
fell down," he said.
He surveyed the damage.
There was a hole in the seat
of his leather-patched blue
jeans and the door of his
cart had come unhinged.
Tuesday, he started over.
He stopped in Suquamish
where a service station at
tendant put a metal sleeve
around his cart pole where
it had split.
Roller skates aren't as
swift as the lumber trucks
passing him up in the
Olympic Peninsula, but
they aren't as slow as many
think, the Breeze said.

Forks, Wash. (AP) —
Bearded Gary Feathergill is
wheeling from Winslow,
Wash., to Eureka, Calif., but
not by car, bus or truck.
He's roller-skating.
Pushing himself along
with poles, Feathergill lum
bered into log country this
week, after two minor acci
dents, a number of repairs
and some rain.
Feathergill, who calls
himself "Breeze," was born
in Illinois 26 years ago, but
says he "isn't really from
anywhere."
Most of his possessions
trail along behind him, en
cased in a walnut cart,
adorned with brass hinges
and strapped to his hips
with a backpacker's belt.
Traveling is Breeze's
fulltime avocation. He says
he once racked up 25,000
hitchhiking miles in 12
months, and last year bicy
cled around Great Britain.
He worked as a painter in
Alaska and at the Artie Circle
not too long ago, then vis
ited his brother in La
Grande, Ore., where he de
cided to do his roller
skating thing and fashioned
his cart.
He loaded the cart with
some clothes, a sleeping
bag, tarp, pots and pans,
granola, lentils, oatmeal,
othervegetarian provisions,

candles and a book of En
glish poets. He also carries a
pad to record his adven
tures, which he hopes to
turn into a book someday.
