The Counter Counter-Culture Book
... AND YOU WERE THERE
Remember the 60's?
Amateurs compared to the 80's.
If you want to see a revolution,
don't put it in the hands of the feeble-minded.
Condemned alike by the conservatives,
—too revolutionary,
and by the liberals,
—too orthodox,
WHY JOHNNY CAN'T... holds out the alternative to
alternative life styles. This book is for people who aren't
into this or that or coming from here or there, but who
may welcome a critique of the mainstream of mankind
that doesn't place them outside of it.
WHY JOHNNY CANT... provides direction to tomor
row's men and women of ability and to the consequent
freedom and happiness that are their right.
In a fairytale format the author, Jason Alexander,
» entertains the reasonable and makes them work through
provocative development of the most fundamental ideas
of our culture.
Caveat: This is not a book for everyone. The pseudo
intellectual will be frightened; the lazy thinker will be
bored; and both will be hostile.
How long since you read a book from which you derived
both pleasure and profit? They are not incompatible.
Enjoy.
At the campus bookstore; at the best off-campus bookstores; or
from the publisher.
