Two University students were killed yes
terday, when the single-engine airplane they
were flying crashed shortly after takeoff
from Palo Alto Municipal Airport.
Jeff Mandel, a junior in aeronautics and
astronautics, and Gretchen Eickhof, also a
junior, were the victims of the mid-morning
crash, in a marshy area across San Francis
quito Creek from the airport, a spokesman
for the San Mateo County coroner's office
said.
The plane had been rented from Spirit of
Palo Alto Aviation, Inc., located at the air

port, for a local flight, the Palo Alto Times
reported.
Mandel piloted the plane, which took off
from the airport at about 10:40 a.m. yester
day, heading northwest. It started to turn

right at an altitude of about 200 feet, accord
ing to accident witness Jeff Bailey, 22, of
Mountain View.
Midway through the turn, Bailey said, it

appeared that the aircraft "went into a stall,"
rolled over and then went down.
Bailey, an experienced pilot himself and
member of the West Valley Flying Club, said
his impressions of what happened were
based on watching the plane from a dis
tance. He said the exact cause of the acci
dent may be completely different and would
be determined by a Federal Aviation Ad
ministration investigation.
Mandel, a native of Little Neck, New York,
was an experienced pilot. The aircraft was a
single-engine Bellanca Decathlon, a plane
designed for stunt flying.
"Usually you don't get to fly one until

you're thoroughly checked out," Bailey
said, adding that West Valley requires at
least five hours of in-flight training on the
equipment before a person is allowed to
solo in the Bellanca.
The wings, engine and wheels had been
torn off the plane by the crash and the
cockpit was almost upside down, according
to Palo Alto Fire Captain Wayne Evans.
Quoted in the Times report, Evans said
Mandel and Eickhof were found still strap
ped in their seats, with their heads underwa
ter.
From the marsh, the bodies were transfer
red to a Coast Guard helicopter, which took

them to the airport runway.
They were declared dead at the scene, the
coroner's office spokesman said, adding
that the official cause of death, presumably
either from the impact or drowning, will be
released early today.
The bodies were positively identified by
friends, the spokesman said, adding that
families of the victims had been notified.
Eickhof, a Crookston, Minnesota native,
had flown with Mandel before, according to
Lisa Anderson, a senior.
Anderson, a friend of both victims, said
last night, that Mandel frequently invited
people to fly with him.
