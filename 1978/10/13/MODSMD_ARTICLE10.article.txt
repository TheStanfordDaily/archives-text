Whatever happened to all
that oak paneling that was in
the old history corner?
-K.T.
According to Bob Nerrie,
senior planner in charge of the
project, "the wood paneling
went with the demolition of
the building."
Nerrie added that the panel
ing was not in very good condi
tion, and it would have been
more costly to upgrade its qual
ity and reuse it. Instead, Wane
Scott oak paneling will be
used.
The former rod iron staircase
railings will be reused in the
new main staircase, he said.

With reference to your col
umn of Sept. 29, what's the dif
ference between the Computa
tion Center (SCIP) and the De
partment of Computer Sci
ence? For that matter, what's
the difference between Jordan
Quad and Jordan Halll
-H.S.B.
Sorry for the confusion. Two
computer-related organiza
tions and two "Jordans" were
obviously too much for me my
first week back!
According to Ruth Riggs,
administrative assistant at the
Stanford Center for Informa
tion Processing, SCiP offers
computing services for stu
dents and faculty here. SCIP
currently has its offices in Polya
and Pine halls, which are part
of Jordan Quad, she said
Jordan Quad consists of
these two buildings and four
other buildings used by the
Communication Department.
The new building under con
struction on Panama Street will
be a part of Jordan Quad and
used by SCIP, she said. It will
not be referred to as Margaret
lacks Hall.
The Computer Science De
partment is an academic
graduate department in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said Carolyn Tajnai, de
partment secretary. Their of
fices are scattered throughout
the campus, she added.

When construction is
finished on Building 460 in the
Quad, the department will
move their offices there, Tajnai
said. She added that the build
ing will be named Margaret
Jacks Hall.
When it is completed, the
Boys Town Center also will
move their offices there, ac
cording to Edward Feigen
baum, chairman of the Com
puter Science Department.
The building will be located
next door to Jordan Hall, a
building in the Quad which
currently houses the Psychol
ogy Department.

Who picks the announcers
for football games?
-B.D.
This responsibility lies with
Gary Cavalli, director of Sports

Publicity and Promotion, ac
cording to Nancy Peterson, as
sistant director there.
Cavalli chooses the an
nouncer in the press box and
the announcer you hear over
the public address system, she
said. Stanford fans have lis
tened to the voice of the cur
rent public addresser, Ed
Macaulay, for the past 27 sea
sons, according to his wife
Hazel.
