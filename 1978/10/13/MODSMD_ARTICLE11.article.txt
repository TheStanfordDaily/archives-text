# Prof gives fourth 'R' for marriage
## 
### 
Platteville, Wis. (AP) —
Sociology professor Ray Short
says first marriages have only a
50-50 success rate these days
because too many people are
saying "I do" when really they
don't.
But Short, who teaches a
"marriage and family" course
at the University of
Wisconsin-Platteville, says
there's a way to beat the odds
and significantly diminish the
chances of divorce or separa
tion.
"You can't just think you're
in love," said Short, who fre
quently lectures at high
schools throughout the Mid
west. "That can't be trusted.
Today's young people are look
ing for a better way."
His general premise is that
the three R's — reading, 'riting
and 'rithmetic — are not
adequate preparation for to
day's young people.
"We all need to study a
fourth R," Short said. "Ro
mance."
Short says students should

be taught that true love just
doesn't happen and that there
should be a "scientific" self
examination of a relationship
to determine if it is the real
thing.
Short, who has been married
25 years and has five children,
aims his tips at determining
whether attraction is a roman
tic infatuation that, he says, will
last three to five years, at most,
or a relationship that will sup
port a successful marriage.
For instance, he said, look at
how the relationship started
and examine whether the main
attraction is physical. Do the
two parties' interest in each
otherebb nowand then, or is it
consistent?
One's perception of a lover
is also important, he said. "In
an infatuation, the other per
son is faultless," he said. "In
true love, the imperfections
are recognized and accepted."
Separation by time or dis
tance will mean waning in
terest if it's an infatuation,
Short said. Frequent quarrels

also are a bad sign.
"The kissing and making up
is beautiful, but the hell that
goes on in between will lead
one or both to start looking
around," he said.
Impatience with the other's
family or friends is a sign of an
infatuation, as are drastic per
sonality changes depending on
whether one's love interest is
present, he said.
Likewise, it is significant how
one unthinkingly refers to a
lover: an offhand reference to
"the idio" or "that little

wench" do not bode well for
happily everafter. In addition,
true lovers are not jealous or
possessive, Short said.
But he said perhaps the most
important indicators of true
love are an unselfish ego re
sponse and an overall attitude
of giving and sharing toward
the other.
"If you ask yourself these
questions about a relationship
before you go ahead, it may
keep you from saying 'I do' and
then later saying you don't,"
says Short.

attraction is physical. Do the
two parties' interest in each
otherebb nowand then, or is it
consistent?
One's perception of a lover
is also important, he said. "In
an infatuation, the other per
son is faultless," he said. "In
true love, the imperfections
are recognized and accepted."
Separation by time or dis
tance will mean waning in
terest if it's an infatuation,
Short said. Frequent quarrels

also are a bad sign.
"The kissing and making up
is beautiful, but the hell that
goes on in between will lead
one or both to start looking
around," he said.
Impatience with the other's
family or friends is a sign of an
infatuation, as are drastic per
sonality changes depending on
whether one's love interest is
present, he said.
Likewise, it is significant how
one unthinkingly refers to a
lover: an offhand reference to
"the idio" or "that little

wench" do not bode well for
happily everafter. In addition,
true lovers are not jealous or
possessive, Short said.
But he said perhaps the most
important indicators of true
love are an unselfish ego re
sponse and an overall attitude
of giving and sharing toward
the other.
"If you ask yourself these
questions about a relationship
before you go ahead, it may
keep you from saying 'I do' and
then later saying you don't,"
says Short.
Platteville, Wis. (AP) —
Sociology professor Ray Short
says first marriages have only a
50-50 success rate these days
because too many people are
saying "I do" when really they
don't.
But Short, who teaches a
"marriage and family" course
at the University of
Wisconsin-Platteville, says
there's a way to beat the odds
and significantly diminish the
chances of divorce or separa
tion.
"You can't just think you're
in love," said Short, who fre
quently lectures at high
schools throughout the Mid
west. "That can't be trusted.
Today's young people are look
ing for a better way."
His general premise is that
the three R's — reading, 'riting
and 'rithmetic — are not
adequate preparation for to
day's young people.
"We all need to study a
fourth R," Short said. "Ro
mance."
Short says students should

be taught that true love just
doesn't happen and that there
should be a "scientific" self
examination of a relationship
to determine if it is the real
thing.
Short, who has been married
25 years and has five children,
aims his tips at determining
whether attraction is a roman
tic infatuation that, he says, will
last three to five years, at most,
or a relationship that will sup
port a successful marriage.
For instance, he said, look at
how the relationship started
and examine whether the main
attraction is physical. Do the
two parties' interest in each
otherebb nowand then, or is it
consistent?
One's perception of a lover
is also important, he said. "In
an infatuation, the other per
