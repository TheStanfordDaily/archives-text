## Staff Perspective The
						real campaign issue 
### 
The ASSU Senate races this year
haven't been very exciting.
True, the appearance of the CRAP
amendment has questioned the valid
ity and power of the senate as a viable
political organization on campus. The
candidates themselves have felt the
impact of CRAP as far as the challenge
it placed on their campaign; not only
did they have to carry on their own
publicity, but the added burden of
justifying the existence of the senate
cost them considerable time and
energy. Yet still the senate race has
been relatively calm and, to tell the
truth, uneventful.
But the real issue which this race
presented hasn't been discussed, or
for that matter, even mentioned.
How does one explain the fact that
only two women submitted a petition
to run for the senate? And what about
other minorities?
Many would quickly jump to the
conclusion that the experience of the
SOC slate in last year's senate, which
supposedly represented most
minorities on campus, produced a
bitter attitude towards any "rep
resentatives" of a minority. If this
were the case, however, then on thfs
year's ballot the voter would (theoret
ically) find individuals of diverse
backgrounds and interests who pre
sented themselves simply as indi
viduals, and not as representatives of
any given faction.
Yet one look at the ballot shows a

rather homogeneous group, with a
scattered sprinkling of minorities.
This seems to reflect a prevalent at
titude among students at the Univer
sity today: nothing can be ac
complished if there isn't a "cause" or
"issue" to fight for.
Vet I would challenge the belief
that a cause is really needed to make a
change. More can be accomplished
by women and other minorities who,
as individuals, become part of the
decision-making process and affect
an institution permanently through
realistic contribution. Utilizing their
various backgrounds, these individu
als (in the senate, for example) can
help to form an environment which
reflects the diversity it supposedly
governs. At this point, the senate can
be created into almost anything â€”
but only if individuals are willing to
put in the time and energy.
It is therefore disappointing that
the elections this year presented so
few options. Of course there are limi
tations as to what can be ac
complished in the ASSU senate. But
there will always be limitations. The
unfortunate thing is that it seems no
one has the time or energy to go
beyond the limitations of a "cause,"
using a little creativity to make this
time of relative calm a time of sig
nificant change.
