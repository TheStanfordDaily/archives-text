KZSU open to
suggestions
By way of response to Gail
Benton's letter (Daily, 10/11),
let us begin by assuring the
Stanford community that we at
KZSU are very open to all sorts
of suggestions and input . . .
especially when concerned in
dividuals take the time to talk
to us first before firing off let
ters to the editor. At any rate,
we would like to take this op
portunity to briefly respond to
Gail's comments.
There are two things that
KZSU always needs — money
and people. As far as money
goes, we are asking the student
body (which provides most of
our income) to help us meet
our expenses in the form of the
special fee assessment to be
voted on this week (and please
do vote!).
. As far as people, the simple
fact is that KZSU's program
ming is only as diverse as the
people who take the time to
come down, learn the techni
cal end of things in our training
program (yes, Virginia, we al
ready have one that meets on
Monday nights beginning at 7),
and then favor us with their
many talents.
However, this quarter we re
ceived only 55 requests for our
42 FM shows that came from
people qualified to go right on
the air. As a result, our classical
and bluegrass programming of

the past (and, of course, any
new Yugoslavian shows) fell
victim to a simple lack of qual
ified programmers interested
in doing those kinds of music.
So, if you are interested in
improving the diversity of
programming at KZSU, please
consider Gail's letter and ours
as an open invitation to take
the time to come down to the
station and get involved. You
may not be an overnight star (it
does take a little time to get an
FCC license and learn how to
use our technical equipment),
but it is not difficult — either to
learn or to be integrated into
our operation, since there are a
million other things to do that
do not require a license. So
please feel free to join your
local Zoo — we love company.

Measure H
I would like to respond to
certain statements made in
Rob lempert's news article on
Measure H, the rent relief
measure, which appeared in
the September 26, 1978 Daily.
What should be of particular
concern to Stanford students is
the claim of Kermit Knopf, a
local landlord, that due to
Measure H, students might
find it more difficult to find re
ntal housing in Palo Alto.
This statement is patently

absurd. In the first place, the
measure is effective for one
year and it is unlikely that it will
have any significant permanent
effect on the availability of ren
tal property.
Secondly, despite the land
lords' constant complaints of
"negative cash flow" (meaning
they are taking a monthly loss
on their property), as most of
us who live in Palo Alto are well
aware, the inflation rate on in
come property is so high that
landlords are able to invest in
property for a few years, write
off the "loss" on their income
tax, sell the property and make
a bundle.
Finally, Measure H is not a
"rent-sharing" measure. It is a
rent relief-tax equity measure
which passes the tax savings
from Proposition 13 that the
landlord receives onto the ten
ant. Renters pay the property
taxes. Landlords figure prop
erty tax into their cosfs not
their profits and increased
costs are passed directly onto
the renter. Therefore, de
creased costs should likewise
be passed directly onto the re
nter. I urge Stanford students
who are Palo Alto residents to
vote for Measure H.

. As far as people, the simple
fact is that KZSU's program

people who take the time to
come down, learn the techni
cal end of things in our training
program (yes, Virginia, we al

Monday nights beginning at 7),
and then favor us with their
many talents.
However, this quarter we re
ceived only 55 requests for our
42 FM shows that came from
people qualified to go right on
the air. As a result, our classical
and bluegrass programming of

the past (and, of course, any
new Yugoslavian shows) fell
victim to a simple lack of qual
ified programmers interested
in doing those kinds of music.
So, if you are interested in
improving the diversity of
programming at KZSU, please
consider Gail's letter and ours
as an open invitation to take
the time to come down to the
station and get involved. You
may not be an overnight star (it
does take a little time to get an
FCC license and learn how to
use our technical equipment),
but it is not difficult — either to
learn or to be integrated into
our operation, since there are a
million other things to do that
do not require a license. So
please feel free to join your
local Zoo — we love company.

Measure H
I would like to respond to
certain statements made in
Rob lempert's news article on
Measure H, the rent relief
measure, which appeared in
the September 26, 1978 Daily.
What should be of particular
concern to Stanford students is
the claim of Kermit Knopf, a
local landlord, that due to
Measure H, students might
find it more difficult to find re
ntal housing in Palo Alto.
This statement is patently

absurd. In the first place, the
measure is effective for one
year and it is unlikely that it will
have any significant permanent
effect on the availability of ren
tal property.
Secondly, despite the land
lords' constant complaints of
"negative cash flow" (meaning
they are taking a monthly loss
on their property), as most of
us who live in Palo Alto are well
aware, the inflation rate on in
come property is so high that
landlords are able to invest in
property for a few years, write
off the "loss" on their income
tax, sell the property and make
a bundle.
Finally, Measure H is not a
"rent-sharing" measure. It is a
rent relief-tax equity measure
which passes the tax savings
from Proposition 13 that the
landlord receives onto the ten
ant. Renters pay the property
taxes. Landlords figure prop
erty tax into their cosfs not
their profits and increased
costs are passed directly onto
the renter. Therefore, de
creased costs should likewise
be passed directly onto the re
nter. I urge Stanford students
who are Palo Alto residents to
vote for Measure H.

KZSU open to
suggestions
By way of response to Gail
Benton's letter (Daily, 10/11),
let us begin by assuring the
Stanford community that we at
KZSU are very open to all sorts
of suggestions and input . . .
especially when concerned in
dividuals take the time to talk
to us first before firing off let

we would like to take this op
portunity to briefly respond to
Gail's comments.
There are two things that
KZSU always needs — money
and people. As far as money
goes, we are asking the student
body (which provides most of
our income) to help us meet
our expenses in the form of the
special fee assessment to be
voted on this week (and please
do vote!).
