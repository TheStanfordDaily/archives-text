## Anti-abortion groups deny rights 
### 
After last Friday's rally, held at noon in White Plaza, I feel
compelled to write in praise and support of the women's center
and the women who organized the rally. It was a moving and at
times tearful experience for me personally, because I have myself
been through the pain of abortion.
It has taken me two years to reach a point where I can accept my
mistakes and live with the difficult choice I had to make. As a
woman with a personal stake in the right to choose,' and one
who does not regret that choice, I can remain silent no longer.
The rally clarified several things for me, which I would like to
share.
1) There are severe threats to recently won women's rights, that
most women are unaware of.
2) There is a small minority, the anti-choice group, that is very
vocal and well-funded, that has more than its share of power.
3) The issue that many of these groups are fighting is not only
abortion but also premarital sex.
4) There is a real need to organize and show our opposition to
these groups.
While women have been enjoying hardwon victories, others
have been working to destroy these rights in their infancy. The
restrictions on medical funded abortions have cut back funded
abortions by 98 percent, and have seriously affected the lives of
those of us unable to pay for abortions ourselves. Other mea
sures are presently before the legislature: Title X, the health ser
vices appropriations bill, would give 40 percent of all family
planning money to anti-choice groups (who frequently do not
advocate even bjrthcontrol).
In addition, Title X could require all clinics receiving funds to
contact parents of women under 18 before giving these women
birthcontrol information, and would also cut back all funds to
clinics who "support" abortion (i.e. consider it an acceptable
alternative), even if these clinics do not themselves give abor
tions.
Not only is funding being attacked: 13 states have now called
for a constitutional convention to overthrow the 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion.
These and other measures are being pushed through by anti
choice groups who do not represent the majority of Americans

(polls show that between 74 and 81 percent of Americans feel that
the right to choose abortion should involve only the women and
her physician.) But the anti-choice minority has received over
$459,000 from the Catholic dioceses and archdiocese in the last 15
months. These people are opposed to abortion for the following
reasons:
1) They believe that it is the killing of human life.
2) They believe that it is against Cod's will.
3) They believe it is a sin to have sex before marriage.
It can be seen that the reasons are based on the religious
(moral) beliefs of this minority, and that it is their desire to impose
these doctrines on all of us. While I respect these people's right
to practice whatever religion they desire, and am in no way
advocating forced abortion for any woman, I resist the imposing,
indeed the forcing, of these beliefs upon my life.
I reserve my right to choose, and will not tolerate this infer
ence. I would ask these groups why they feel it is Cod's will that
they increase our suffering, for I can assure the anti-choice
groups that abortion is never easy, even without their timely
reminder.
Did you know tht women are being greeted by children carry
ing flowers, coffins and effigies of babies as they enter clinics for
their abortions? That clinics are being sabotaged, and physicians
and their families threatened? That women in Ohio are legally
required to bury their aborted fetuses? How can we fight against
such fanaticism? Who of them will accept responsibility for the
traumas and ruined lives of women forced to carry unwanted
children? Who among them will bear the burden of our added
unhappiness?
We have only the force of our knowledge with which to combat
these well funded, vocal forces. They key is to answer their
emotional claims, not with equalled emotion, but to stand on the
force of our intellectual beliefs. We must not allow a clouding of
issues, but must insist that the issue is not the morality of premari
tal sex but the freedom to make the best choices if pregnancyhas
occurred.
In addition, we must not attack the church or religion itself, but
direct our fight towards those individuals who are using the
church to further their fanatic beliefs. Most importantly, we must
prove that we are not the immoral, callous, unfeeling women that
the anti-choice groups like to characterize us as.
We must become a well-organized vocal political group, and
make the strength of our numbers visible, through rallies, sit-ins,
letters, workshops and other peaceful means of protest. We must
make our position clear.
Towards this end, there is being organized a pro-choice group
on campus. It is hoped that this will provide a vehicle for women
to express their views and show their support. In addition, there
will be a post-abortion group meeting every Thursday night, in
which women can gather to share experiences and offer mutual
support.
Although these comments may seem to be addressed primarily
towards women, they are indeed speaking to men as well. I was
heartened to see so many men at Friday's rally, and I hope this
support will continue and strengthen. In closing I would like to
say that the layers of healing are very frail, the choice never easy
but often necessary, and that the pain is not lessened by our
belief that we are right.

It has taken me two years to reach a point where I can accept my
mistakes and live with the difficult choice I had to make. As a
woman with a personal stake in the right to choose,' and one
who does not regret that choice, I can remain silent no longer.
The rally clarified several things for me, which I would like to
share.
1) There are severe threats to recently won women's rights, that
most women are unaware of.
2) There is a small minority, the anti-choice group, that is very
vocal and well-funded, that has more than its share of power.
3) The issue that many of these groups are fighting is not only
abortion but also premarital sex.
4) There is a real need to organize and show our opposition to
these groups.
While women have been enjoying hardwon victories, others
have been working to destroy these rights in their infancy. The
restrictions on medical funded abortions have cut back funded
abortions by 98 percent, and have seriously affected the lives of
those of us unable to pay for abortions ourselves. Other mea
sures are presently before the legislature: Title X, the health ser
vices appropriations bill, would give 40 percent of all family
planning money to anti-choice groups (who frequently do not
advocate even bjrthcontrol).
In addition, Title X could require all clinics receiving funds to
contact parents of women under 18 before giving these women
birthcontrol information, and would also cut back all funds to
clinics who "support" abortion (i.e. consider it an acceptable
alternative), even if these clinics do not themselves give abor
tions.
Not only is funding being attacked: 13 states have now called
for a constitutional convention to overthrow the 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion.
These and other measures are being pushed through by anti
choice groups who do not represent the majority of Americans

(polls show that between 74 and 81 percent of Americans feel that
the right to choose abortion should involve only the women and
her physician.) But the anti-choice minority has received over
$459,000 from the Catholic dioceses and archdiocese in the last 15
months. These people are opposed to abortion for the following
reasons:
1) They believe that it is the killing of human life.
2) They believe that it is against Cod's will.
3) They believe it is a sin to have sex before marriage.
It can be seen that the reasons are based on the religious
(moral) beliefs of this minority, and that it is their desire to impose
these doctrines on all of us. While I respect these people's right
to practice whatever religion they desire, and am in no way
advocating forced abortion for any woman, I resist the imposing,
indeed the forcing, of these beliefs upon my life.
I reserve my right to choose, and will not tolerate this infer
ence. I would ask these groups why they feel it is Cod's will that
they increase our suffering, for I can assure the anti-choice
groups that abortion is never easy, even without their timely
reminder.
Did you know tht women are being greeted by children carry
ing flowers, coffins and effigies of babies as they enter clinics for
their abortions? That clinics are being sabotaged, and physicians
and their families threatened? That women in Ohio are legally
required to bury their aborted fetuses? How can we fight against
such fanaticism? Who of them will accept responsibility for the
traumas and ruined lives of women forced to carry unwanted
children? Who among them will bear the burden of our added
unhappiness?
We have only the force of our knowledge with which to combat
these well funded, vocal forces. They key is to answer their
emotional claims, not with equalled emotion, but to stand on the
force of our intellectual beliefs. We must not allow a clouding of
issues, but must insist that the issue is not the morality of premari
tal sex but the freedom to make the best choices if pregnancyhas
occurred.
In addition, we must not attack the church or religion itself, but
direct our fight towards those individuals who are using the
church to further their fanatic beliefs. Most importantly, we must
prove that we are not the immoral, callous, unfeeling women that
the anti-choice groups like to characterize us as.
We must become a well-organized vocal political group, and
make the strength of our numbers visible, through rallies, sit-ins,
letters, workshops and other peaceful means of protest. We must
make our position clear.
Towards this end, there is being organized a pro-choice group
on campus. It is hoped that this will provide a vehicle for women
to express their views and show their support. In addition, there
will be a post-abortion group meeting every Thursday night, in
which women can gather to share experiences and offer mutual
support.
Although these comments may seem to be addressed primarily
towards women, they are indeed speaking to men as well. I was
heartened to see so many men at Friday's rally, and I hope this
support will continue and strengthen. In closing I would like to
say that the layers of healing are very frail, the choice never easy
but often necessary, and that the pain is not lessened by our
belief that we are right.

After last Friday's rally, held at noon in White Plaza, I feel
compelled to write in praise and support of the women's center
and the women who organized the rally. It was a moving and at
times tearful experience for me personally, because I have myself
been through the pain of abortion.

1) There are severe threats to recently won women's rights, that
most women are unaware of.
2) There is a small minority, the anti-choice group, that is very
vocal and well-funded, that has more than its share of power.
3) The issue that many of these groups are fighting is not only
abortion but also premarital sex.
4) There is a real need to organize and show our opposition to
these groups.
While women have been enjoying hardwon victories, others
have been working to destroy these rights in their infancy. The
restrictions on medical funded abortions have cut back funded
abortions by 98 percent, and have seriously affected the lives of
those of us unable to pay for abortions ourselves. Other mea
sures are presently before the legislature: Title X, the health ser
vices appropriations bill, would give 40 percent of all family
planning money to anti-choice groups (who frequently do not
advocate even bjrthcontrol).
In addition, Title X could require all clinics receiving funds to
contact parents of women under 18 before giving these women
birthcontrol information, and would also cut back all funds to
clinics who "support" abortion (i.e. consider it an acceptable
alternative), even if these clinics do not themselves give abor
tions.
Not only is funding being attacked: 13 states have now called
for a constitutional convention to overthrow the 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion.
These and other measures are being pushed through by anti
choice groups who do not represent the majority of Americans

(polls show that between 74 and 81 percent of Americans feel that
the right to choose abortion should involve only the women and
her physician.) But the anti-choice minority has received over
$459,000 from the Catholic dioceses and archdiocese in the last 15
months. These people are opposed to abortion for the following
reasons:
1) They believe that it is the killing of human life.
2) They believe that it is against Cod's will.
3) They believe it is a sin to have sex before marriage.
It can be seen that the reasons are based on the religious
(moral) beliefs of this minority, and that it is their desire to impose
these doctrines on all of us. While I respect these people's right
to practice whatever religion they desire, and am in no way
advocating forced abortion for any woman, I resist the imposing,
indeed the forcing, of these beliefs upon my life.
I reserve my right to choose, and will not tolerate this infer
ence. I would ask these groups why they feel it is Cod's will that
they increase our suffering, for I can assure the anti-choice
groups that abortion is never easy, even without their timely
reminder.
Did you know tht women are being greeted by children carry
ing flowers, coffins and effigies of babies as they enter clinics for
their abortions? That clinics are being sabotaged, and physicians
and their families threatened? That women in Ohio are legally
required to bury their aborted fetuses? How can we fight against
such fanaticism? Who of them will accept responsibility for the
traumas and ruined lives of women forced to carry unwanted
children? Who among them will bear the burden of our added
unhappiness?
We have only the force of our knowledge with which to combat
these well funded, vocal forces. They key is to answer their
emotional claims, not with equalled emotion, but to stand on the
force of our intellectual beliefs. We must not allow a clouding of
issues, but must insist that the issue is not the morality of premari
tal sex but the freedom to make the best choices if pregnancyhas
occurred.
In addition, we must not attack the church or religion itself, but
direct our fight towards those individuals who are using the
church to further their fanatic beliefs. Most importantly, we must
prove that we are not the immoral, callous, unfeeling women that
the anti-choice groups like to characterize us as.
We must become a well-organized vocal political group, and
make the strength of our numbers visible, through rallies, sit-ins,
letters, workshops and other peaceful means of protest. We must
make our position clear.
Towards this end, there is being organized a pro-choice group
on campus. It is hoped that this will provide a vehicle for women
to express their views and show their support. In addition, there
will be a post-abortion group meeting every Thursday night, in
which women can gather to share experiences and offer mutual
support.
Although these comments may seem to be addressed primarily
towards women, they are indeed speaking to men as well. I was
heartened to see so many men at Friday's rally, and I hope this
support will continue and strengthen. In closing I would like to
say that the layers of healing are very frail, the choice never easy
but often necessary, and that the pain is not lessened by our
belief that we are right.

After last Friday's rally, held at noon in White Plaza, I feel
compelled to write in praise and support of the women's center
and the women who organized the rally. It was a moving and at
times tearful experience for me personally, because I have myself
been through the pain of abortion.
It has taken me two years to reach a point where I can accept my
mistakes and live with the difficult choice I had to make. As a
woman with a personal stake in the right to choose,' and one
who does not regret that choice, I can remain silent no longer.
