## Are declining SAT scores a real problem? 
### 
Recently there has been a glut of newspaper arti
cles about how poorly high school students are per
forming on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Noting
that average SAT scores have declined for 14 consecu
tive years, these articles lament the passing of the
"basic" high school curriculum which produced the
record SAT performance of 1964. Their conclusion is
simple but vague. The schools are failing, and some
thing must be done.
Of course, concern over declining SAT scores has
not been limited to journalists. Social scientists and
educators have offered a number of partially satisfac
tory explanations, often citing such extra-educational
forces as television and the breakdown of the nuclear
family. The public, on the other hand, has usually
been less charitable to the schools, blaming the pro
liferation of easy elective subjects, the slackening of
discipline and the substandard performance of many
teachers.
In the midst of all this head shaking, theorizing,
and finger pointing, no one seems to have bothered
to ask whether a problem really exists. Does it matter
that high school seniors now average about 80 points
lower on their combined (math plus verbal) SAT
scores than students 14 years ago? Or are the schools
being criticized for something which really is not a
problem at all?
I n order to answer these questions it is necessary to
consider the SAT's purpose. Basically, the SAT exists
to provide a fair standard of comparison of students
with varied educational backgrounds. Without such a
standard, itwould be difficult for colleges to compare
the academic promise of applicants from, say, a high
school in rural Texas with those from a suburb of San
Francisco. The SAT is considered appropritae to per
form this function because it has been shown to be a
good predictor of success in college as measured by
grade point average. That is, a student with a high SAT
score is more likely to do well at a given college than

one with a low score. Since colleges prefer to have
students who do well, they favor applicants with hieh
SAT's.
Considering only this comparative function, it is
clear that the decline in scores does not matter at all.
All that is necessary is that there continues to be a
broad range of performance on the test so that some
applicants can be ranked more highly than others.
What difference does it make if Intelligensia Univer
sity chooses applicants with scores in the 600-800
range leaving those in the 400-600 range for Party
Tech or if Intelligensia takes the 500-700 group and
Party the 300-500's?
The obvious response to this argument is that since
the value of the SAT is based on its ability to predict
success in college, it is natural to assume that if over
all SAT performance is dropping, then so is overall
performance in college. However, just the contrary
has been true as the last 10 years have been a period
of unprecedented grade inflation. Of course, grade
inflation is itself a complex phenomenon, but the
point is that the SAT is not a predictor of college
success in any absolute sense, but only relatively so.
That is, the SAT does not predict how much know
ledge any given student will acquire in college but
only how well he or she is likely to do relative to other
students at the same college at the same time.
It seems, then, that concern over declining SAT
scores is unjustified unless there is reason to believe
either 1) that lower SAT scores are indicative of in
ferior preparation for success in life or 2) that high
SAT scores, like high moral standards, are desirable
in and of themselves. Concerning the former
hypothesis, I can only say that the connection bet
ween what the SAT tests and the skills required in life
seems tenuous at best. Certainly, the average person's
day to day existence affords few occasions to utilize
the ability to remember picayune details from a
paragraph read at*top speed or the ability to solve

apparently simple but actually tricky arithmetic prob
lems. Furthermore, since no one has ever been able
to establish a positive correlation between success in
school and achievement in professional life (except
in professions like law in which high grades are a
virtual prerequisite to many lucrative and prestigious
positions), it seems unlikely that SAT performance
alone would correlate very highly with professional
competence.
We are left with the second hypothesis — that high
SAT performance is important in and of itself. In fact,
strange as it may seem, I believe that this is a proposi
tion in which many people tacitly accept. We live in a
society that values achievement and achievement is
often measured in numbers. Schools are a prime
example of this ethic; high grades and high test
scores have become ends in themselves. But the SAT
was never intended to be an end, only a tool to
accomplish an end.
If this analysis is correct, I would suggest that the
concern over declining SAT's is misplaced. The test is
serving the function for which it was designed just as
well as it did when scores were higher, and there is no
reason to believe that society will be injured if high
school seniors do not do as well ori the SAT as their
predecessors.
However, if educators and the public continue to
value high SAT performance for its own sake, a very
direct approach to the problem seem indicated.
Teach kids how to take the SAT. Start them off in
elementary school doing simplified SAT-type exer
cises and devote a lot of time to continued practice
throughout secondary school, not just for a few
months prior to the test. Performance is sure to im
prove. Then we can start reading articles about how
sterile our schools have become.

well as it did when scores were higher, and there is no
reason to believe that society will be injured if high
school seniors do not do as well ori the SAT as their
predecessors.
However, if educators and the public continue to
value high SAT performance for its own sake, a very
direct approach to the problem seem indicated.
Teach kids how to take the SAT. Start them off in
elementary school doing simplified SAT-type exer
cises and devote a lot of time to continued practice
throughout secondary school, not just for a few
months prior to the test. Performance is sure to im
prove. Then we can start reading articles about how
sterile our schools have become.
(Michael Imber is a graduate student in the School of
Education.)
Recently there has been a glut of newspaper arti
cles about how poorly high school students are per
forming on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Noting
that average SAT scores have declined for 14 consecu
tive years, these articles lament the passing of the
"basic" high school curriculum which produced the
record SAT performance of 1964. Their conclusion is
simple but vague. The schools are failing, and some
thing must be done.
Of course, concern over declining SAT scores has
not been limited to journalists. Social scientists and
educators have offered a number of partially satisfac
tory explanations, often citing such extra-educational
forces as television and the breakdown of the nuclear
family. The public, on the other hand, has usually
been less charitable to the schools, blaming the pro
liferation of easy elective subjects, the slackening of
discipline and the substandard performance of many
teachers.
In the midst of all this head shaking, theorizing,
and finger pointing, no one seems to have bothered
to ask whether a problem really exists. Does it matter
that high school seniors now average about 80 points
lower on their combined (math plus verbal) SAT
scores than students 14 years ago? Or are the schools
being criticized for something which really is not a
problem at all?
I n order to answer these questions it is necessary to
consider the SAT's purpose. Basically, the SAT exists
to provide a fair standard of comparison of students
with varied educational backgrounds. Without such a
standard, itwould be difficult for colleges to compare
the academic promise of applicants from, say, a high
school in rural Texas with those from a suburb of San
Francisco. The SAT is considered appropritae to per
form this function because it has been shown to be a
good predictor of success in college as measured by
grade point average. That is, a student with a high SAT
score is more likely to do well at a given college than

one with a low score. Since colleges prefer to have
students who do well, they favor applicants with hieh
SAT's.
Considering only this comparative function, it is
clear that the decline in scores does not matter at all.
All that is necessary is that there continues to be a
broad range of performance on the test so that some
applicants can be ranked more highly than others.
What difference does it make if Intelligensia Univer
sity chooses applicants with scores in the 600-800
range leaving those in the 400-600 range for Party
Tech or if Intelligensia takes the 500-700 group and
Party the 300-500's?
The obvious response to this argument is that since
the value of the SAT is based on its ability to predict
success in college, it is natural to assume that if over
all SAT performance is dropping, then so is overall
performance in college. However, just the contrary
has been true as the last 10 years have been a period
of unprecedented grade inflation. Of course, grade
inflation is itself a complex phenomenon, but the
point is that the SAT is not a predictor of college
success in any absolute sense, but only relatively so.
That is, the SAT does not predict how much know
ledge any given student will acquire in college but
only how well he or she is likely to do relative to other
students at the same college at the same time.
It seems, then, that concern over declining SAT
scores is unjustified unless there is reason to believe
either 1) that lower SAT scores are indicative of in
ferior preparation for success in life or 2) that high
SAT scores, like high moral standards, are desirable
in and of themselves. Concerning the former
hypothesis, I can only say that the connection bet
ween what the SAT tests and the skills required in life
seems tenuous at best. Certainly, the average person's
day to day existence affords few occasions to utilize
the ability to remember picayune details from a
paragraph read at*top speed or the ability to solve

apparently simple but actually tricky arithmetic prob
lems. Furthermore, since no one has ever been able
to establish a positive correlation between success in
school and achievement in professional life (except
in professions like law in which high grades are a
virtual prerequisite to many lucrative and prestigious
positions), it seems unlikely that SAT performance
alone would correlate very highly with professional
competence.
We are left with the second hypothesis — that high
SAT performance is important in and of itself. In fact,
strange as it may seem, I believe that this is a proposi
tion in which many people tacitly accept. We live in a
society that values achievement and achievement is
often measured in numbers. Schools are a prime
example of this ethic; high grades and high test
scores have become ends in themselves. But the SAT
was never intended to be an end, only a tool to
accomplish an end.
If this analysis is correct, I would suggest that the
concern over declining SAT's is misplaced. The test is
serving the function for which it was designed just as
well as it did when scores were higher, and there is no
reason to believe that society will be injured if high
school seniors do not do as well ori the SAT as their

alone would correlate very highly with professional
competence.
We are left with the second hypothesis — that high
SAT performance is important in and of itself. In fact,
strange as it may seem, I believe that this is a proposi
tion in which many people tacitly accept. We live in a
society that values achievement and achievement is
often measured in numbers. Schools are a prime
example of this ethic; high grades and high test
scores have become ends in themselves. But the SAT
was never intended to be an end, only a tool to
accomplish an end.
If this analysis is correct, I would suggest that the
concern over declining SAT's is misplaced. The test is
serving the function for which it was designed just as
well as it did when scores were higher, and there is no
reason to believe that society will be injured if high
school seniors do not do as well ori the SAT as their
predecessors.
However, if educators and the public continue to
value high SAT performance for its own sake, a very
direct approach to the problem seem indicated.
Teach kids how to take the SAT. Start them off in
elementary school doing simplified SAT-type exer
cises and devote a lot of time to continued practice
throughout secondary school, not just for a few
months prior to the test. Performance is sure to im
prove. Then we can start reading articles about how
sterile our schools have become.

Recently there has been a glut of newspaper arti
cles about how poorly high school students are per
forming on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Noting
that average SAT scores have declined for 14 consecu
tive years, these articles lament the passing of the
"basic" high school curriculum which produced the
record SAT performance of 1964. Their conclusion is
simple but vague. The schools are failing, and some
thing must be done.
Of course, concern over declining SAT scores has
not been limited to journalists. Social scientists and
educators have offered a number of partially satisfac
tory explanations, often citing such extra-educational
forces as television and the breakdown of the nuclear
family. The public, on the other hand, has usually
been less charitable to the schools, blaming the pro
liferation of easy elective subjects, the slackening of
discipline and the substandard performance of many
teachers.
In the midst of all this head shaking, theorizing,
and finger pointing, no one seems to have bothered
to ask whether a problem really exists. Does it matter
that high school seniors now average about 80 points
lower on their combined (math plus verbal) SAT
scores than students 14 years ago? Or are the schools
being criticized for something which really is not a
problem at all?
I n order to answer these questions it is necessary to
consider the SAT's purpose. Basically, the SAT exists
to provide a fair standard of comparison of students
with varied educational backgrounds. Without such a
standard, itwould be difficult for colleges to compare
the academic promise of applicants from, say, a high
school in rural Texas with those from a suburb of San
Francisco. The SAT is considered appropritae to per
form this function because it has been shown to be a
good predictor of success in college as measured by
grade point average. That is, a student with a high SAT
score is more likely to do well at a given college than

one with a low score. Since colleges prefer to have
students who do well, they favor applicants with hieh
SAT's.
Considering only this comparative function, it is
clear that the decline in scores does not matter at all.
All that is necessary is that there continues to be a
broad range of performance on the test so that some
applicants can be ranked more highly than others.
What difference does it make if Intelligensia Univer
sity chooses applicants with scores in the 600-800
range leaving those in the 400-600 range for Party
Tech or if Intelligensia takes the 500-700 group and
Party the 300-500's?
The obvious response to this argument is that since
the value of the SAT is based on its ability to predict
success in college, it is natural to assume that if over
all SAT performance is dropping, then so is overall
performance in college. However, just the contrary
has been true as the last 10 years have been a period
of unprecedented grade inflation. Of course, grade
inflation is itself a complex phenomenon, but the
point is that the SAT is not a predictor of college
success in any absolute sense, but only relatively so.
That is, the SAT does not predict how much know
ledge any given student will acquire in college but
only how well he or she is likely to do relative to other
students at the same college at the same time.
It seems, then, that concern over declining SAT
scores is unjustified unless there is reason to believe
either 1) that lower SAT scores are indicative of in
ferior preparation for success in life or 2) that high
SAT scores, like high moral standards, are desirable
in and of themselves. Concerning the former
hypothesis, I can only say that the connection bet
ween what the SAT tests and the skills required in life
seems tenuous at best. Certainly, the average person's
day to day existence affords few occasions to utilize
the ability to remember picayune details from a
paragraph read at*top speed or the ability to solve

apparently simple but actually tricky arithmetic prob
lems. Furthermore, since no one has ever been able
to establish a positive correlation between success in
school and achievement in professional life (except
in professions like law in which high grades are a
virtual prerequisite to many lucrative and prestigious
positions), it seems unlikely that SAT performance
alone would correlate very highly with professional
competence.
