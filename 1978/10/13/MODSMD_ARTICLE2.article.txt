### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
ASSU Elections Commissioner Will
Nixon estimated a "moderate to
light" turnout of perhaps 1000 voters
yesterday, the first day of ASSU elec
tions.
On the ballot are graduate and un
dergraduate senate candidates, can
didates for three positions on the
Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil, a KZSU fee assessment, a re
ferendum and a constitutional
amendment.
Nixon said he hopes for a larger
turnout today, the final day of voting.
He added that at least 20 percent of
the student body, 2474 people, must
vote for KZSU's $1 fee assessment to
pass.
Wording trouble
Though the election has been run
ning smoothly, according to Nixon,
some people have been having trou
ble deciphering wording on the bal
lot and have confused the amend
ment with the referendum.
The proposed amendment, spon
sored by the Committee to Retire
Aspiring Politicos (CRAP), would
eliminate the senate and transfer its
duties to the Council of Presidents. It
needs two-thirds of those voting to
approve it.

The referendum is a non-binding
survey of student opinion, asking
whether the ASSU should remove its
funds from a University pool, which
invests in South Africa.
Nixon said the referendum will
give the new senate an idea of how
students feel on the issue.
The elections commission will
begin hand-counting ballots at 3
p.m. today in Meyer Library. Nixon
said the count should be finished by

8 or 9 p.m.
Results will be posted on the ASSU
office windows as soon as available.
Five polling places are open today.
They are located at the post office, 10
a.m. to 4 p.m.; theFrench and Italian
corner of the Quad, open 10a.rn. to 4
p.m.; Terman Mall, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.;
the Graduate School of Business,
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; and the Medical
Center near the student lounge,
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.


Moderate voter turnout was complicated yesterday by the
ambiguity of the ballot in reference to the CRAP amend
ment and the South African referendum. Voting will end

today at 4 p.m. and the results should be tabulated and
posted in the ASSU office by 9 p.m. today.
