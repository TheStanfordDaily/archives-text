# Government to end race discrimination
## Many blacks see no change in Rhodesia 
### 
Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) —
Philip Mwanza stared impas
sively at the newspaper's ban
ner headline: "Race Discrimi
nation to Co."
"It doesn't help me, doesn't
affect me at all — I don't have
enough money," said
Mwanza. "But I suppose it's a
good thing. I don't mind."
Like Mwanza, most of
Rhodesia's 6.7 million blacks
look at Rhodesia's plan to re
place skin color with wealth as
the basis for entry to the
260,000-white minority's
cherished institutions —
schools, hospitals, suburbs —
and see no differences for
themselves.

The country's new biracial
government — formed by
Prime Minister lan Smith as a
move toward a black-majority
rule — has announced plans to
end the last race barriers. The
transitional government is op
posed by black nationalist
guerrillas who have been fight
ing for years to drive out
Smith's regime.
The government's black offi
cials sounded euphoric, white
ones a shade defensive, in exp
laining that race discrimination
was out. But most blacks feel
financial, education and lan
guage barriers are still in.
Though there has never
been job discrimination by

law, these barriers mean few
blacks will soon reach the
white way of life.
Mwanza, a $2052-a-year of
fice messenger is compara
tively well-off, earning more
than double the average black
wage.
Like thousands of working
class blacks in cities, he keepsa
foot in two camps. He rents a
$19.50-a-month room in a tiny
house in a black township near
the capital.
Twice a month he commutes
to the Coromonzi Tribal Reser
vation, 25 miles east, where his
wife and four children live on a
lot alloted by the local head
man.
Guerrilla war
The nationalist guerrilla war,
which has closed the clas
srooms to some 250,000 chil
dren, a fifth of expected en
rollment, has not yet reached
Coromonzi.
So Mwanza's older children,
ages 6 to 12, attend a school
run by a local black state-aided
council. Mwanza, in his mid
30s pays $85.80 a year in school
fees.
It would cost him $72, plus
extras, to get just the eldest
daughter, Forgiveness, into

one of the current white
schools — to be known as
"high fee-paying schools"
under the new system. And of
ficials say there are plans to
make the high fees higher.
Not reality
The government's plan
could take several months to
become law and would be ir
relevant should the
communist-supported guerril
las take over. What it offers
Mwanza is a vision, not a real
ity.
Rhodesian whites reacted
with relief that only a "reason
able" number of "reasonable"
blacks would be allowed in —
and with skepticims that the
new law is just a piece of paper
that a black government could
tear up.
Housewife Shirley Coyne
feared a change in schools.
"Discrimination should have
been done away with long
ago," she said, "but a little dis
cretion should be used in edu
cation so older children aren't
lumped together with younger
ones, who'll be held back."
Most appeal
The plan has most appeal to
the reasonably well-off black
minority who can afford the

$6200 deposit for a $25,000
housein a white suburb — and
keep up the $160-a-month
mortgage payments.
Stanley Hatendi, 38, a black
economist who earns more
than the average white salary of
$9240 yearly has children at
costly private multiracial
schools, and may head for a
white suburb.
"The transitional govern
ment's decision is a good
move. Africans have urged it
for years," said Hatendi.
"Some critics might think there
are ulterior motives, but it
achieves the desired goal. It
doesn't matter how it's done,
as long as it's done."
Different views
However, this view is not
shared by hard-line
nationalists.
Methodist minister Max
Chigwida, who recently quit
one of the black parties in the
transition government, said:
"Those who look at the change
in terms of structures are not
very impressed."
That is the heart of the mat
ter. In 90 years here, whites
built and kept to themselves
the best schools, hospitals and
homes. Whiletheirdominance
was reinforced by law, it was
maintained too by differences
in wealth and class that it
would take years to overcome.

rollment, has not yet reached
Coromonzi.
So Mwanza's older children,
ages 6 to 12, attend a school
run by a local black state-aided
council. Mwanza, in his mid
30s pays $85.80 a year in school
fees.
It would cost him $72, plus
extras, to get just the eldest
daughter, Forgiveness, into

one of the current white
schools — to be known as
"high fee-paying schools"
under the new system. And of
ficials say there are plans to
make the high fees higher.
Not reality
The government's plan
could take several months to
become law and would be ir
relevant should the
communist-supported guerril
las take over. What it offers
Mwanza is a vision, not a real
ity.
Rhodesian whites reacted
with relief that only a "reason
able" number of "reasonable"
blacks would be allowed in —
and with skepticims that the
new law is just a piece of paper
that a black government could
tear up.
Housewife Shirley Coyne
feared a change in schools.
"Discrimination should have
been done away with long
ago," she said, "but a little dis
cretion should be used in edu
cation so older children aren't
lumped together with younger
ones, who'll be held back."
Most appeal
The plan has most appeal to
the reasonably well-off black
minority who can afford the

$6200 deposit for a $25,000
housein a white suburb — and
keep up the $160-a-month
mortgage payments.
Stanley Hatendi, 38, a black
economist who earns more
than the average white salary of
$9240 yearly has children at
costly private multiracial
schools, and may head for a
white suburb.
"The transitional govern
ment's decision is a good
move. Africans have urged it
for years," said Hatendi.
"Some critics might think there
are ulterior motives, but it
achieves the desired goal. It
doesn't matter how it's done,
as long as it's done."
Different views
However, this view is not
shared by hard-line
nationalists.
Methodist minister Max
Chigwida, who recently quit
one of the black parties in the
transition government, said:
"Those who look at the change
in terms of structures are not
very impressed."
That is the heart of the mat
ter. In 90 years here, whites
built and kept to themselves
the best schools, hospitals and
homes. Whiletheirdominance
was reinforced by law, it was
maintained too by differences
in wealth and class that it
would take years to overcome.
Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) —
Philip Mwanza stared impas
sively at the newspaper's ban
ner headline: "Race Discrimi
nation to Co."
"It doesn't help me, doesn't
affect me at all — I don't have
enough money," said
Mwanza. "But I suppose it's a
good thing. I don't mind."
Like Mwanza, most of
Rhodesia's 6.7 million blacks
look at Rhodesia's plan to re
place skin color with wealth as
the basis for entry to the
260,000-white minority's
cherished institutions —
schools, hospitals, suburbs —
and see no differences for
themselves.

The country's new biracial
government — formed by
Prime Minister lan Smith as a
move toward a black-majority
rule — has announced plans to
end the last race barriers. The
transitional government is op
posed by black nationalist
guerrillas who have been fight
ing for years to drive out
Smith's regime.
The government's black offi
cials sounded euphoric, white
ones a shade defensive, in exp
laining that race discrimination
was out. But most blacks feel
financial, education and lan
guage barriers are still in.
Though there has never
been job discrimination by

law, these barriers mean few
blacks will soon reach the
white way of life.
Mwanza, a $2052-a-year of
fice messenger is compara
tively well-off, earning more
than double the average black
wage.
Like thousands of working
class blacks in cities, he keepsa
foot in two camps. He rents a
$19.50-a-month room in a tiny
house in a black township near
the capital.
Twice a month he commutes
to the Coromonzi Tribal Reser
vation, 25 miles east, where his
wife and four children live on a
lot alloted by the local head
man.

doesn't matter how it's done,
as long as it's done."
Different views
However, this view is not
shared by hard-line
nationalists.
Methodist minister Max
Chigwida, who recently quit
one of the black parties in the
transition government, said:
"Those who look at the change
in terms of structures are not
very impressed."
That is the heart of the mat

built and kept to themselves

would take years to overcome.
Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) —
Philip Mwanza stared impas
sively at the newspaper's ban
ner headline: "Race Discrimi
nation to Co."
"It doesn't help me, doesn't
affect me at all — I don't have
enough money," said
Mwanza. "But I suppose it's a
good thing. I don't mind."
Like Mwanza, most of
Rhodesia's 6.7 million blacks
look at Rhodesia's plan to re
place skin color with wealth as
the basis for entry to the
260,000-white minority's
cherished institutions —
schools, hospitals, suburbs —
and see no differences for
themselves.

The country's new biracial
government — formed by
Prime Minister lan Smith as a
move toward a black-majority
rule — has announced plans to
end the last race barriers. The
transitional government is op
posed by black nationalist
guerrillas who have been fight
ing for years to drive out
Smith's regime.
The government's black offi
cials sounded euphoric, white
ones a shade defensive, in exp
laining that race discrimination
was out. But most blacks feel
financial, education and lan
guage barriers are still in.
Though there has never
been job discrimination by

law, these barriers mean few
blacks will soon reach the
white way of life.
Mwanza, a $2052-a-year of
fice messenger is compara
tively well-off, earning more
than double the average black
wage.
Like thousands of working
class blacks in cities, he keepsa
foot in two camps. He rents a
$19.50-a-month room in a tiny
house in a black township near
the capital.
Twice a month he commutes
to the Coromonzi Tribal Reser
vation, 25 miles east, where his
wife and four children live on a
lot alloted by the local head
man.
Guerrilla war
The nationalist guerrilla war,
which has closed the clas
srooms to some 250,000 chil
dren, a fifth of expected en
rollment, has not yet reached
Coromonzi.
So Mwanza's older children,
ages 6 to 12, attend a school
run by a local black state-aided
council. Mwanza, in his mid
30s pays $85.80 a year in school
fees.
It would cost him $72, plus
extras, to get just the eldest
daughter, Forgiveness, into

one of the current white
schools — to be known as
"high fee-paying schools"
under the new system. And of
ficials say there are plans to
make the high fees higher.
Not reality
The government's plan
could take several months to
become law and would be ir
relevant should the
communist-supported guerril
las take over. What it offers
Mwanza is a vision, not a real
ity.
Rhodesian whites reacted
with relief that only a "reason
able" number of "reasonable"
blacks would be allowed in —
and with skepticims that the
new law is just a piece of paper
that a black government could
tear up.
Housewife Shirley Coyne
feared a change in schools.
"Discrimination should have
been done away with long
ago," she said, "but a little dis
cretion should be used in edu
cation so older children aren't
lumped together with younger
ones, who'll be held back."
Most appeal
The plan has most appeal to
the reasonably well-off black
minority who can afford the

$6200 deposit for a $25,000
housein a white suburb — and
keep up the $160-a-month
mortgage payments.
Stanley Hatendi, 38, a black
economist who earns more
than the average white salary of
$9240 yearly has children at
costly private multiracial
schools, and may head for a
white suburb.
"The transitional govern
ment's decision is a good
move. Africans have urged it
for years," said Hatendi.
"Some critics might think there
are ulterior motives, but it
achieves the desired goal. It
doesn't matter how it's done,
as long as it's done."
