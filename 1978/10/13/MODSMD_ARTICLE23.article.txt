# Sexual assaults, deaths common among inmates of state prisons
## 
### Associated Press 
Behind a yellow metal door
on the mentally ill offenders'
ward in Los Angeles County's
Central Jail, a plaintive voice
drones over and over: "They
treat us real nice here. They
treat us real nice here."
Down the hall, the jail com
mander, a 35-year-old blond
man who used to be a Lutheran
ministry student, points out
where other yellow metal
doors were rewelded onto the
wall.
Prisoners raging on the latest
fad drug, "angle dust,"
knocked the doors off their
hinges.
The droning voice in the
background belongs to one of
the more than 26,000 inmates
in California's 272 jails, those
largely forgotten places where
prisoners typically spend a year
or less.
Many of those jails, pressured
by court suits and state
minimum jail standards, have
had to improve conditions
from what they were 20 years
ago.
With a flood of lawsuits, lib
eral groups assaulted the jails

in the 19705, winning numer
ous court orders mandating
better conditions.
One of those orders was is
sued recently by U.S. District
Court Judge William Gray, who
said inmates at the sprawling
Los Angeles County Central Jail
were at times treated in an "in
tolerable" way.
Cray ordered sweeping
changes affecting many as
pects of prisoners' life, from
sleeping conditions to outdoor
exercise, at the 5000-inmate
facility.
But despite such orders,
deaths, sexual attacks and
beatings continue in jails.
For in the pecking order of
the nation's prison system, jails
are close to the bottom. Even
many prisoners say they do
"better time" in California's
state prisons than in its jails.
State prisons are for persons
convicted of felonies, usually
repeat offenders. City and
county jails house persons
convicted of misdeameanors,
some first-time felony prison
ers and people awaiting trial
who have not been convicted
of any crime but who for one
reason or another are not re

leased on bail.
Again and again, all sides cite
the public's unwillingness to
spend money on jails as a
primary reason for jail prob
lems.
Critics angrily describe most
jails as pits, places where the
threat to life and sanity is grea
ter than it is on the street.
Law enforcement says it
does the best it can with the
money it has.
Duane Lowe, Sacramento's
sheriff who is president of the
California Peace Officers As
sociation, says there is "a
moral need to have a clean,
safe jail."
Lowe said he doubted Prop
osition 13, which cut $7 billion
in local revenues, would
prompt massive jail money
cutbacks, mainly because
sheriffs realize substandard
jails spark lawsuits.
"Proposition 13's basic im
pact was to stop all progress in
changing the jails. It forced us
to go into a spinning wheel pat
tern for the moment," said Jim
Denman, a San Francisco
County undersheriff.
As authorities make cuts,

they must keep an eye on the
state Board of Corrections'
minimum jail standards, im
posed since 1946 and
strengthened in 1973.
While the board's standards
aren't mandatory, Lowe says
sheriffs know failure to meet
the standards can be cited in a
lawsuit against a jail.
As jail commanders wrestle
with Proposition 13, they work
against a grim backdrop of
events that have occurred in
jails in the last few years:
In June, a 36-year-old in
mate, undergoing drug with
drawal, died when he appa
rently fell from an upper bunk
at the Parker Center jail in Los
Angeles.
In June 1975 a 62-year-old
man nicknamed "Fishhook"
died in the Hanford jail after
suffering massive internal in
juries in a beating by another
inmate in the drunk tank.
In January some Santa Bar
bara County jail inmates used a
ballpoint pen to tatoo an
obscene design on a 20-year
old prisoner's back. A day later
the prisoner was the victim of a
sexual attack.

county jails house persons
convicted of misdeameanors,
some first-time felony prison
ers and people awaiting trial
who have not been convicted
of any crime but who for one
reason or another are not re

leased on bail.
Again and again, all sides cite
the public's unwillingness to
spend money on jails as a
primary reason for jail prob
lems.
Critics angrily describe most
jails as pits, places where the
threat to life and sanity is grea
ter than it is on the street.
Law enforcement says it
does the best it can with the
money it has.
Duane Lowe, Sacramento's
sheriff who is president of the
California Peace Officers As
sociation, says there is "a
moral need to have a clean,
safe jail."
Lowe said he doubted Prop
osition 13, which cut $7 billion
in local revenues, would
prompt massive jail money
cutbacks, mainly because
sheriffs realize substandard
jails spark lawsuits.
"Proposition 13's basic im
pact was to stop all progress in
changing the jails. It forced us
to go into a spinning wheel pat
tern for the moment," said Jim
Denman, a San Francisco
County undersheriff.
As authorities make cuts,

they must keep an eye on the
state Board of Corrections'
minimum jail standards, im
posed since 1946 and
strengthened in 1973.
While the board's standards
aren't mandatory, Lowe says
sheriffs know failure to meet
the standards can be cited in a
lawsuit against a jail.
As jail commanders wrestle
with Proposition 13, they work
against a grim backdrop of
events that have occurred in
jails in the last few years:
In June, a 36-year-old in
mate, undergoing drug with
drawal, died when he appa
rently fell from an upper bunk
at the Parker Center jail in Los
Angeles.
In June 1975 a 62-year-old
man nicknamed "Fishhook"
died in the Hanford jail after
suffering massive internal in
juries in a beating by another
inmate in the drunk tank.
In January some Santa Bar
bara County jail inmates used a
ballpoint pen to tatoo an
obscene design on a 20-year
old prisoner's back. A day later
the prisoner was the victim of a
sexual attack.
Behind a yellow metal door
on the mentally ill offenders'
ward in Los Angeles County's
Central Jail, a plaintive voice
drones over and over: "They
treat us real nice here. They
treat us real nice here."
Down the hall, the jail com
mander, a 35-year-old blond
man who used to be a Lutheran
ministry student, points out
where other yellow metal
doors were rewelded onto the
wall.
Prisoners raging on the latest
fad drug, "angle dust,"
knocked the doors off their
hinges.
The droning voice in the
background belongs to one of
the more than 26,000 inmates
in California's 272 jails, those
largely forgotten places where
prisoners typically spend a year
or less.
Many of those jails, pressured
by court suits and state
minimum jail standards, have
had to improve conditions
from what they were 20 years
ago.
With a flood of lawsuits, lib
eral groups assaulted the jails

in the 19705, winning numer
ous court orders mandating
better conditions.
One of those orders was is
sued recently by U.S. District
Court Judge William Gray, who
said inmates at the sprawling
Los Angeles County Central Jail
were at times treated in an "in
tolerable" way.
Cray ordered sweeping
changes affecting many as
pects of prisoners' life, from
sleeping conditions to outdoor
exercise, at the 5000-inmate
facility.
But despite such orders,
deaths, sexual attacks and
beatings continue in jails.
For in the pecking order of
the nation's prison system, jails
are close to the bottom. Even
many prisoners say they do
"better time" in California's
state prisons than in its jails.
State prisons are for persons
convicted of felonies, usually
repeat offenders. City and
county jails house persons
convicted of misdeameanors,
some first-time felony prison
