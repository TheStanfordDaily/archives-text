# Dils to face No. 1 pass defense
## Card gridders seek revenge against Husky blitz 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The human memory has no
Pink Pearl eraser.
Members of the Stanford
football team had a hard time
getting Saturday's 27-26 loss to
UCLA out of their heads.
"I still don't get sleep think
ing about that game," Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said Monday.
Last year Stanford re
bounded well after conference
losses. Washington pasted the
Cards, 45-21, and the Cards
reeled off back-to-back vic
tories. USC embarrassed Stan
ford, 49-0, and the locals won
three straight. The losses were
big. No cliff-hangers. No
drama. No sleepless nights.
"Last year we had no 'what if'
games," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. "After USC and
Washington we just picked
ourselves up and said we'd
have to come back the next
week.
"But every player who got in
the game last week was saying,
'What if I had only done this or
that.' Everyone, including the
coaches, go through an over
critical self-analysis."
Before the Cards got too lost
iri deep self-analysis early this
week, the reality of tomorrow's
workload shelved some guilt
trips about Saturday's narrow
loss.
At 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium the Cards host the na
tion's top 2-3 team, the 1978
Rose Bowl champion
Washington Huskies. Like the
Cards, the Huskies have a con
ference loss — a 10-7 defeat at
the hands of UCLA. And like
the Cards, the Huskies are
coming off a battering loss to a
highly physical team — a 20-17
defeat to Alabama.
The Huskies present Stan
ford with a look similar to what
the Cards saw against UCLA: a
stingy, veteran defense and an
l-set offense with a great tail
back.
"They play darn good de
fense," Walsh said.
"Washington looks like the
team that won the Rose Bowl
last year."
The Huskies lead the Pac-10
in defense, allowing a scant
204.2 yards a game. Linebacker

Michael Jackson and corner
back Nesby Glasgow, both
1977 All-Coast selections, head
the Husky defense. Jackson
tops the Huskies with 68 tack
les. Glasgow anchors a secon
dary which leads the nation in
pass defense, surrendering
only 39.8 yards a game. Oppos
ing teams have completed but
23 of 67 passes against
Washington, a Scrooge-like
34.3 percent.
"The statistics aren't scaring
us," Walsh said. "We played
teams which were tops statisti
cally before we played them
and they weren't afterwards."
The Huskies blitzed Stanford
heavily last year in Seattle and
Stanford expects them to do so
again this year — especially
after they see the UCLA-
Stanford film.
"We know they are going to
blitz," Stanford tight end Pat
Bowe said. "Our game plan is
to try to complete a pass every
time they blitz and make them
drop off into a regular defense.
If they block passes, sack the
quarterback or we just don't
complete it, that gives their de
fense momentum."
What about the touted sec
ondary?
"We remember them from
last year and have seen them
on film and they look really
sound," Bowe said. "But when
they are blitzing, no one can
cover our receivers man-to
man."
Opposing teams have had
little luck with any other form
of pass coverage either. Card
quarterback Steve Dils still
leads the nation in passing with
22.4 completions a game, hav
ing completed 112 of 174 pas
ses for 1182 yards and nine
touchdowns. The three top re
ceivers in the Pac-10 are Stan
ford's Phil Francis (29 recep
tions), Darrin Nelson (26) and
Ken Margerum (22).
Francis hurt his ribs and wrist
in last week's game and it is
uncertain how much action he
will see tomorrow. Walsh said
that Jim Brown will assume
some of Francis' blocking
duties while Billy Anderson will
take some of his receiving
chores if Francis retires to the
sideline.

"We have to have blocking
for Nelson if Phil is out or we
have no running game," Walsh
said.
Last year Washington limited
Nelson to 45 yards on 17 car
ries. Tlie explosive sophomore
has run for 485 yards on 69 car
ries for a 7.0 average.
"Stanford makes you cover
the full field from sideline to
sideline," James said. "Watch
ing Stanford's game films, if
you don't pay attention to
names or numbers, you don't
think anyone has graduated."
To counter the Husky blitz,
Stanford will shift its wide re
ceivers in tight and use double
tight-end sets, as it did in the
second half against UCLA last
week.
"The tight end will be shift
ing into the backfield like a
fullback to provide pass pro
tection," Bowe said. The Cards
will also use wide receivers at
tight end and use three wide
receiver formations. Dils will
throw lots of quick look-in pas
ses to the wide receivers and
flat passes to the backs to try to
beat the blitz.
While Dils has been ex
tremely effective getting pas
ses to his receivers, James said
that Washington's "biggest
problem is trying to get the ball
to wide receiver Robert
"Spider") Gaines." James said
that continual double
coverage made it difficult to
get the ball to Gaines in the
early season.
Last week, however, 'Bama
ignored Gaines and suffered
tne consequences. He scored
both of Washington's
touchdowns against the Crim
son Tide — one on a 74-yard
reception and the other on a
58-yard catch.
Quarterback Tim Porras may
be forced to look even more
for Gaines this weekend be
cause his leading receiver,
tight end Scott Greenwood, is
out for the season with a bro
ken ankle.
But even if the Husky passing
game never gets off the
ground, the Stanford defense
will have to account for tai'-
back Joe Steele, the 15th lead
ing rusher in the country with

568 yards and a 4.3 average.
"I have great respect for Joe
Steele," Card defensive end
Dean Wilson said. "He'd just as
soon run right over you as go
around you. He's a very
punishing runner."
The Huskies' primary play is
a toss sweep out of the I to
either side. And when
Washington puts the ball in the
air, it is usually from a sprint
action play.
The Card defense hopes to
pick up where it left off against
UCLA when it limited the
Bruins toB7 yards in the second
half. This was not enough to
contain the Southlanders,
however, as Theotis Brown
dissected Stanford's kickoff
coverage with a 93-yard
touchdown return. The Cards
had trouble with their other
special teams too, punting fora
lackluster 33.7 yards a boot
against UCLA.
"If we did nothing our spe
cial teams would be better,"
Walsh said, noting the sensitiv
ity of his players to an obvious
dismal special team showing
last week.
Of course, Walsh is not con
tent to do nothing. First-team
players with more speed, size
and experience will see action
on the special teams tomor
row.
Washington, too, has been
having trouble with special
teams. The Huskies mishan
dled a punt against Alabama
which set up a short 16-yard
touchdown drive. As well, the
Huskies are the conference's
weakest punting team.
A loss tomorrow would give
Stanford its first consecutive
losses under Walsh. A victory,
however, would put the Cards
on pace with last year.
"It's like Walsh told us at
practice," Bowe said, "all we
have to do is win to turn
around last year's season when
we beat UCLA but lost to
Washington."
Players do not have personal
secretaries who can create
60-minute gaps in their
memories, and the Cards
would like to remember to
morrow as a victory.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis heads for open field against Tulane in Stanford's 17-14 victory over the

ses to the wide receivers and
flat passes to the backs to try to
beat the blitz.
While Dils has been ex
tremely effective getting pas
ses to his receivers, James said
that Washington's "biggest
problem is trying to get the ball
to wide receiver Robert
"Spider") Gaines." James said
that continual double
coverage made it difficult to
get the ball to Gaines in the
early season.
Last week, however, 'Bama
ignored Gaines and suffered
tne consequences. He scored
both of Washington's
touchdowns against the Crim
son Tide — one on a 74-yard
reception and the other on a
58-yard catch.
Quarterback Tim Porras may
be forced to look even more
for Gaines this weekend be
cause his leading receiver,
tight end Scott Greenwood, is
out for the season with a bro
ken ankle.
But even if the Husky passing
game never gets off the
ground, the Stanford defense
will have to account for tai'-
back Joe Steele, the 15th lead
ing rusher in the country with

568 yards and a 4.3 average.
"I have great respect for Joe
Steele," Card defensive end
Dean Wilson said. "He'd just as
soon run right over you as go
around you. He's a very
punishing runner."
The Huskies' primary play is
a toss sweep out of the I to
either side. And when
Washington puts the ball in the
air, it is usually from a sprint
action play.
The Card defense hopes to
pick up where it left off against
UCLA when it limited the
Bruins toB7 yards in the second
half. This was not enough to
contain the Southlanders,
however, as Theotis Brown
dissected Stanford's kickoff
coverage with a 93-yard
touchdown return. The Cards
had trouble with their other
special teams too, punting fora
lackluster 33.7 yards a boot
against UCLA.
"If we did nothing our spe
cial teams would be better,"
Walsh said, noting the sensitiv
ity of his players to an obvious
dismal special team showing
last week.
Of course, Walsh is not con
tent to do nothing. First-team
players with more speed, size
and experience will see action
on the special teams tomor
row.
Washington, too, has been
having trouble with special
teams. The Huskies mishan
dled a punt against Alabama
which set up a short 16-yard
touchdown drive. As well, the
Huskies are the conference's
weakest punting team.
A loss tomorrow would give
Stanford its first consecutive
losses under Walsh. A victory,
however, would put the Cards
on pace with last year.
"It's like Walsh told us at
practice," Bowe said, "all we
have to do is win to turn
around last year's season when
we beat UCLA but lost to
Washington."
Players do not have personal
secretaries who can create
60-minute gaps in their
memories, and the Cards
would like to remember to
morrow as a victory.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis heads for open field against Tulane in Stanford's 17-14 victory over the
Green Wave. Francis injured his ribs and wrist against UCLA Saturday but is expected to start tomorrow
against Washington. Francis leads the Pac-10 in receiving with 29 catches.
The human memory has no
Pink Pearl eraser.
Members of the Stanford
football team had a hard time
getting Saturday's 27-26 loss to
UCLA out of their heads.
"I still don't get sleep think
ing about that game," Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said Monday.
Last year Stanford re
bounded well after conference
losses. Washington pasted the
Cards, 45-21, and the Cards
reeled off back-to-back vic
tories. USC embarrassed Stan
ford, 49-0, and the locals won
three straight. The losses were
big. No cliff-hangers. No
drama. No sleepless nights.
"Last year we had no 'what if'
games," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. "After USC and
Washington we just picked
ourselves up and said we'd
have to come back the next
week.
"But every player who got in
the game last week was saying,
'What if I had only done this or
that.' Everyone, including the
coaches, go through an over
critical self-analysis."
Before the Cards got too lost
iri deep self-analysis early this
week, the reality of tomorrow's
workload shelved some guilt
trips about Saturday's narrow
loss.
At 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium the Cards host the na
tion's top 2-3 team, the 1978
Rose Bowl champion
Washington Huskies. Like the
Cards, the Huskies have a con
ference loss — a 10-7 defeat at
the hands of UCLA. And like
the Cards, the Huskies are
coming off a battering loss to a
highly physical team — a 20-17
defeat to Alabama.
The Huskies present Stan
ford with a look similar to what
the Cards saw against UCLA: a
stingy, veteran defense and an
l-set offense with a great tail
back.
"They play darn good de
fense," Walsh said.
"Washington looks like the
team that won the Rose Bowl
last year."
The Huskies lead the Pac-10
in defense, allowing a scant
204.2 yards a game. Linebacker

Michael Jackson and corner
back Nesby Glasgow, both
1977 All-Coast selections, head
the Husky defense. Jackson
tops the Huskies with 68 tack
les. Glasgow anchors a secon
dary which leads the nation in
pass defense, surrendering
only 39.8 yards a game. Oppos
ing teams have completed but
23 of 67 passes against
Washington, a Scrooge-like
34.3 percent.
"The statistics aren't scaring
us," Walsh said. "We played
teams which were tops statisti
cally before we played them
and they weren't afterwards."
The Huskies blitzed Stanford
heavily last year in Seattle and
Stanford expects them to do so
again this year — especially
after they see the UCLA-
Stanford film.
"We know they are going to
blitz," Stanford tight end Pat
Bowe said. "Our game plan is
to try to complete a pass every
time they blitz and make them
drop off into a regular defense.
If they block passes, sack the
quarterback or we just don't
complete it, that gives their de
fense momentum."
What about the touted sec
ondary?
"We remember them from
last year and have seen them
on film and they look really
sound," Bowe said. "But when
they are blitzing, no one can
cover our receivers man-to
man."
Opposing teams have had
little luck with any other form
of pass coverage either. Card
quarterback Steve Dils still
leads the nation in passing with
22.4 completions a game, hav
ing completed 112 of 174 pas
ses for 1182 yards and nine
touchdowns. The three top re
ceivers in the Pac-10 are Stan
ford's Phil Francis (29 recep
tions), Darrin Nelson (26) and
Ken Margerum (22).
Francis hurt his ribs and wrist
in last week's game and it is
uncertain how much action he
will see tomorrow. Walsh said
that Jim Brown will assume
some of Francis' blocking
duties while Billy Anderson will
take some of his receiving
chores if Francis retires to the
sideline.

"We have to have blocking
for Nelson if Phil is out or we
have no running game," Walsh
said.
Last year Washington limited
Nelson to 45 yards on 17 car
ries. Tlie explosive sophomore
has run for 485 yards on 69 car
ries for a 7.0 average.
"Stanford makes you cover
the full field from sideline to
sideline," James said. "Watch
ing Stanford's game films, if
you don't pay attention to
names or numbers, you don't
think anyone has graduated."
To counter the Husky blitz,
Stanford will shift its wide re
ceivers in tight and use double
tight-end sets, as it did in the
second half against UCLA last
week.
"The tight end will be shift
ing into the backfield like a
fullback to provide pass pro
tection," Bowe said. The Cards
will also use wide receivers at
tight end and use three wide
receiver formations. Dils will
throw lots of quick look-in pas
ses to the wide receivers and
flat passes to the backs to try to
beat the blitz.
While Dils has been ex
tremely effective getting pas
ses to his receivers, James said
that Washington's "biggest
problem is trying to get the ball
to wide receiver Robert
"Spider") Gaines." James said
that continual double

last year."
The Huskies lead the Pac-10
in defense, allowing a scant
204.2 yards a game. Linebacker

Michael Jackson and corner
back Nesby Glasgow, both
1977 All-Coast selections, head
the Husky defense. Jackson
tops the Huskies with 68 tack
les. Glasgow anchors a secon
dary which leads the nation in
pass defense, surrendering
only 39.8 yards a game. Oppos
ing teams have completed but
23 of 67 passes against
Washington, a Scrooge-like
34.3 percent.
"The statistics aren't scaring
us," Walsh said. "We played
teams which were tops statisti
cally before we played them
and they weren't afterwards."
The Huskies blitzed Stanford
heavily last year in Seattle and
Stanford expects them to do so
again this year — especially
after they see the UCLA-
Stanford film.
"We know they are going to
blitz," Stanford tight end Pat
Bowe said. "Our game plan is
to try to complete a pass every
time they blitz and make them
drop off into a regular defense.
If they block passes, sack the
quarterback or we just don't
complete it, that gives their de
fense momentum."
What about the touted sec
ondary?
"We remember them from
last year and have seen them
on film and they look really
sound," Bowe said. "But when
they are blitzing, no one can
cover our receivers man-to
man."
Opposing teams have had
little luck with any other form
of pass coverage either. Card
quarterback Steve Dils still
leads the nation in passing with
22.4 completions a game, hav
ing completed 112 of 174 pas
ses for 1182 yards and nine
touchdowns. The three top re
ceivers in the Pac-10 are Stan
ford's Phil Francis (29 recep
tions), Darrin Nelson (26) and
Ken Margerum (22).
Francis hurt his ribs and wrist
in last week's game and it is
uncertain how much action he
will see tomorrow. Walsh said
that Jim Brown will assume
some of Francis' blocking
duties while Billy Anderson will
take some of his receiving
chores if Francis retires to the
sideline.

"We have to have blocking
for Nelson if Phil is out or we
have no running game," Walsh
said.
Last year Washington limited
Nelson to 45 yards on 17 car
ries. Tlie explosive sophomore
has run for 485 yards on 69 car
ries for a 7.0 average.
"Stanford makes you cover
the full field from sideline to
sideline," James said. "Watch
ing Stanford's game films, if
you don't pay attention to
names or numbers, you don't
think anyone has graduated."
To counter the Husky blitz,
Stanford will shift its wide re
ceivers in tight and use double
tight-end sets, as it did in the
second half against UCLA last
week.
"The tight end will be shift
ing into the backfield like a
fullback to provide pass pro
tection," Bowe said. The Cards
will also use wide receivers at
tight end and use three wide
receiver formations. Dils will
throw lots of quick look-in pas
ses to the wide receivers and
flat passes to the backs to try to
beat the blitz.
While Dils has been ex
tremely effective getting pas
ses to his receivers, James said
that Washington's "biggest
problem is trying to get the ball
to wide receiver Robert
"Spider") Gaines." James said
that continual double
coverage made it difficult to
get the ball to Gaines in the
early season.
Last week, however, 'Bama
ignored Gaines and suffered
tne consequences. He scored
both of Washington's
touchdowns against the Crim
son Tide — one on a 74-yard
reception and the other on a
58-yard catch.
Quarterback Tim Porras may
be forced to look even more
for Gaines this weekend be
cause his leading receiver,
tight end Scott Greenwood, is
out for the season with a bro
ken ankle.
But even if the Husky passing
game never gets off the
ground, the Stanford defense
will have to account for tai'-
back Joe Steele, the 15th lead
ing rusher in the country with

568 yards and a 4.3 average.
"I have great respect for Joe
Steele," Card defensive end
Dean Wilson said. "He'd just as
soon run right over you as go
around you. He's a very
punishing runner."
The Huskies' primary play is
a toss sweep out of the I to
either side. And when
Washington puts the ball in the
air, it is usually from a sprint
action play.
The Card defense hopes to
pick up where it left off against
UCLA when it limited the
Bruins toB7 yards in the second
half. This was not enough to
contain the Southlanders,
however, as Theotis Brown
dissected Stanford's kickoff
coverage with a 93-yard
touchdown return. The Cards
had trouble with their other
special teams too, punting fora
lackluster 33.7 yards a boot
against UCLA.
"If we did nothing our spe
cial teams would be better,"
Walsh said, noting the sensitiv
ity of his players to an obvious
dismal special team showing
last week.
Of course, Walsh is not con
tent to do nothing. First-team
players with more speed, size
and experience will see action
on the special teams tomor
row.
Washington, too, has been
having trouble with special
teams. The Huskies mishan
dled a punt against Alabama
which set up a short 16-yard
touchdown drive. As well, the
Huskies are the conference's
weakest punting team.
A loss tomorrow would give
Stanford its first consecutive
losses under Walsh. A victory,
however, would put the Cards
on pace with last year.
"It's like Walsh told us at
practice," Bowe said, "all we
have to do is win to turn
around last year's season when
we beat UCLA but lost to
Washington."
Players do not have personal
secretaries who can create
60-minute gaps in their
memories, and the Cards
would like to remember to
morrow as a victory.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis heads for open field against Tulane in Stanford's 17-14 victory over the
Green Wave. Francis injured his ribs and wrist against UCLA Saturday but is expected to start tomorrow
against Washington. Francis leads the Pac-10 in receiving with 29 catches.
The human memory has no
Pink Pearl eraser.
Members of the Stanford
football team had a hard time
getting Saturday's 27-26 loss to
UCLA out of their heads.
"I still don't get sleep think
ing about that game," Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said Monday.
Last year Stanford re
bounded well after conference
losses. Washington pasted the
Cards, 45-21, and the Cards
reeled off back-to-back vic
tories. USC embarrassed Stan
ford, 49-0, and the locals won
three straight. The losses were
big. No cliff-hangers. No
drama. No sleepless nights.
"Last year we had no 'what if'
games," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. "After USC and
Washington we just picked
ourselves up and said we'd
have to come back the next
week.
"But every player who got in
the game last week was saying,
'What if I had only done this or
that.' Everyone, including the
coaches, go through an over
critical self-analysis."
Before the Cards got too lost
iri deep self-analysis early this
week, the reality of tomorrow's
workload shelved some guilt
trips about Saturday's narrow
loss.
At 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium the Cards host the na
tion's top 2-3 team, the 1978
Rose Bowl champion
Washington Huskies. Like the
Cards, the Huskies have a con
ference loss — a 10-7 defeat at
the hands of UCLA. And like
the Cards, the Huskies are
coming off a battering loss to a
highly physical team — a 20-17
defeat to Alabama.
The Huskies present Stan
ford with a look similar to what
the Cards saw against UCLA: a
stingy, veteran defense and an
l-set offense with a great tail
back.
"They play darn good de
fense," Walsh said.
"Washington looks like the
team that won the Rose Bowl
last year."
The Huskies lead the Pac-10
in defense, allowing a scant
204.2 yards a game. Linebacker

Michael Jackson and corner

dismal special team showing
last week.
Of course, Walsh is not con
tent to do nothing. First-team
players with more speed, size
and experience will see action
on the special teams tomor
row.
Washington, too, has been
having trouble with special
teams. The Huskies mishan
dled a punt against Alabama
which set up a short 16-yard
touchdown drive. As well, the
Huskies are the conference's
weakest punting team.
A loss tomorrow would give
Stanford its first consecutive
losses under Walsh. A victory,
however, would put the Cards
on pace with last year.
"It's like Walsh told us at
practice," Bowe said, "all we
have to do is win to turn
around last year's season when
we beat UCLA but lost to
Washington."
Players do not have personal
secretaries who can create
60-minute gaps in their
memories, and the Cards
would like to remember to

Stanford fullback Phil Francis heads for open field against Tulane in Stanford's 17-14 victory over the
Green Wave. Francis injured his ribs and wrist against UCLA Saturday but is expected to start tomorrow
against Washington. Francis leads the Pac-10 in receiving with 29 catches.
The human memory has no
Pink Pearl eraser.
Members of the Stanford
football team had a hard time
getting Saturday's 27-26 loss to
UCLA out of their heads.
"I still don't get sleep think
ing about that game," Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said Monday.
Last year Stanford re
bounded well after conference
losses. Washington pasted the
Cards, 45-21, and the Cards
reeled off back-to-back vic
tories. USC embarrassed Stan
ford, 49-0, and the locals won
three straight. The losses were
big. No cliff-hangers. No
drama. No sleepless nights.
"Last year we had no 'what if'
games," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. "After USC and
Washington we just picked
ourselves up and said we'd
have to come back the next
week.
"But every player who got in
the game last week was saying,
'What if I had only done this or
that.' Everyone, including the
coaches, go through an over
critical self-analysis."
Before the Cards got too lost
iri deep self-analysis early this
week, the reality of tomorrow's
workload shelved some guilt
trips about Saturday's narrow
loss.
At 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium the Cards host the na
tion's top 2-3 team, the 1978
Rose Bowl champion
Washington Huskies. Like the
Cards, the Huskies have a con
ference loss — a 10-7 defeat at
the hands of UCLA. And like
the Cards, the Huskies are
coming off a battering loss to a
highly physical team — a 20-17
defeat to Alabama.
The Huskies present Stan
ford with a look similar to what
the Cards saw against UCLA: a
stingy, veteran defense and an
l-set offense with a great tail
back.
"They play darn good de
fense," Walsh said.
"Washington looks like the
team that won the Rose Bowl
last year."
The Huskies lead the Pac-10
in defense, allowing a scant
204.2 yards a game. Linebacker

Michael Jackson and corner
back Nesby Glasgow, both
1977 All-Coast selections, head
the Husky defense. Jackson
tops the Huskies with 68 tack
les. Glasgow anchors a secon
dary which leads the nation in
pass defense, surrendering
only 39.8 yards a game. Oppos
ing teams have completed but
23 of 67 passes against
Washington, a Scrooge-like
34.3 percent.
"The statistics aren't scaring
us," Walsh said. "We played
teams which were tops statisti
cally before we played them
and they weren't afterwards."
The Huskies blitzed Stanford
heavily last year in Seattle and
Stanford expects them to do so
again this year — especially
after they see the UCLA-
Stanford film.
"We know they are going to
blitz," Stanford tight end Pat
Bowe said. "Our game plan is
to try to complete a pass every
time they blitz and make them
drop off into a regular defense.
If they block passes, sack the
quarterback or we just don't
complete it, that gives their de
fense momentum."
What about the touted sec
ondary?
"We remember them from
last year and have seen them
on film and they look really
sound," Bowe said. "But when
they are blitzing, no one can
cover our receivers man-to
man."
Opposing teams have had
little luck with any other form
of pass coverage either. Card
quarterback Steve Dils still
leads the nation in passing with
22.4 completions a game, hav
ing completed 112 of 174 pas
ses for 1182 yards and nine
touchdowns. The three top re
ceivers in the Pac-10 are Stan
ford's Phil Francis (29 recep
tions), Darrin Nelson (26) and
Ken Margerum (22).
Francis hurt his ribs and wrist
in last week's game and it is
uncertain how much action he
will see tomorrow. Walsh said
that Jim Brown will assume
some of Francis' blocking
duties while Billy Anderson will
take some of his receiving
chores if Francis retires to the
sideline.

"We have to have blocking
for Nelson if Phil is out or we
have no running game," Walsh
said.
Last year Washington limited
Nelson to 45 yards on 17 car
ries. Tlie explosive sophomore
has run for 485 yards on 69 car
ries for a 7.0 average.
"Stanford makes you cover
the full field from sideline to
sideline," James said. "Watch
ing Stanford's game films, if
you don't pay attention to
names or numbers, you don't
think anyone has graduated."
To counter the Husky blitz,
Stanford will shift its wide re
ceivers in tight and use double
tight-end sets, as it did in the
second half against UCLA last
week.
"The tight end will be shift
ing into the backfield like a
fullback to provide pass pro
tection," Bowe said. The Cards
will also use wide receivers at
tight end and use three wide
receiver formations. Dils will
throw lots of quick look-in pas
ses to the wide receivers and
flat passes to the backs to try to
beat the blitz.
While Dils has been ex
tremely effective getting pas
ses to his receivers, James said
that Washington's "biggest
problem is trying to get the ball
to wide receiver Robert
"Spider") Gaines." James said
that continual double
coverage made it difficult to
get the ball to Gaines in the
early season.
Last week, however, 'Bama
ignored Gaines and suffered
tne consequences. He scored
both of Washington's
touchdowns against the Crim
son Tide — one on a 74-yard
reception and the other on a
58-yard catch.
Quarterback Tim Porras may
be forced to look even more
for Gaines this weekend be
cause his leading receiver,
tight end Scott Greenwood, is
out for the season with a bro
ken ankle.
But even if the Husky passing
game never gets off the
ground, the Stanford defense
will have to account for tai'-
back Joe Steele, the 15th lead
ing rusher in the country with

568 yards and a 4.3 average.
"I have great respect for Joe
Steele," Card defensive end
Dean Wilson said. "He'd just as
soon run right over you as go
around you. He's a very
punishing runner."
The Huskies' primary play is
a toss sweep out of the I to
either side. And when
Washington puts the ball in the
air, it is usually from a sprint
action play.
The Card defense hopes to
pick up where it left off against
UCLA when it limited the
Bruins toB7 yards in the second
half. This was not enough to
contain the Southlanders,
however, as Theotis Brown
dissected Stanford's kickoff
coverage with a 93-yard
touchdown return. The Cards
had trouble with their other
special teams too, punting fora
lackluster 33.7 yards a boot
against UCLA.
"If we did nothing our spe
cial teams would be better,"
Walsh said, noting the sensitiv
ity of his players to an obvious
dismal special team showing
last week.
Of course, Walsh is not con
tent to do nothing. First-team
players with more speed, size
and experience will see action

Washington, too, has been
having trouble with special
teams. The Huskies mishan
