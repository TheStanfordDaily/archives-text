# Keohanes and kids tackle weekly predictions
## 
### 
The Daily is a family paper so this
week the sports department asked the
Keohane family to do the grid picking.
Nan and Bob Keohane, both political
science professors, showed a more
than academic understanding of dip
lomacy by asking both of their sons to
join them at the negotiating table to
hammer out some picks.
All you poli sci jocks take note of the
following athletic minutiae:
"The Keohanes predict that the Yan
kees will lose the World Series. Now,
that's not what the Daily asked us, but
for Red Sox and sentimental White Sox
fans, faith is defined as the belief that
sooner or later, the Yankees will lose.
Let us hope it will happen next year
before the playoffs!
"Now for that secondary sport, foot
ball, that manages to hold our sporadic
attention after the beloved Beantow
ners have blown it again. The two of us
have gotten together with our experts
(Jonathan and Stephan, aged 12) to
make some sage predictions about this
Saturday's gridiron battles.
"Stephan and Jonathan say that the
score of the BYU-Oregon game should
be zero to minus seven, given the qual
ity of the teams. Forced to choose, we

pick BYU over the Ducks, 17-14.
"Belief in justice would yield a pre
diction of Washington State over
UCLA, 25-24, on a safety in the last 30
seconds. Yankee-haters are more cyni
cal. UCLA by four, 28-24.
"Arizona State scored 56 points
against Northwestern last week. Taking
the distance between Evantson, 111.,
and Los Angeles, dividing by 40, divid
ing the result into 56, and multiplying
by 14.56789 leads to the precise conclu
sion that they will only score 17 points
against the Trojans, which won't be
enough. USC, 28-17.
California is not good enough to beat
Stanford later this year, but they can
certainly handle Arizona, which will be
suffering a letdown after almost beating
Michigan last week. California, 35-21.
How will our Cardinals/Trees/Robber
Barons rebound from their tough loss
last week in Smogville? After a lacklus
ter win over Tulane and the loss to
UCLA, all of us agree that they'll come
out playing football (even in the first
half) and roll over Washington, 34-20. It
should be a good Saturday to be throw
ing paper airplanes in the end zone.
Right, Jonathan and Stephan?"
