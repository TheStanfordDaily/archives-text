## Scotchers bomb Spartans with second-half explosion 
### JULIE HILL 
Hustling Stanford scotchers
outclassed their slow-paced
University of Pacific opponents
in an 8-0 landslide Wednesday.
Freshman Lynn Keyser flipped
in the first of a string of goals
two minutes before the end of
a Cardinal-controlled first half.
The dazzled Tigers, lacking
Stanford's high caliber of play,
came within striking distance
only once during the entire
lopsided match. The Cards
dominated a smoothly exe
cuted, fast-paced second half
in which they added seven

more goals to Keyser's first.
Three of the second-half
goals were scored by back
Nancy White, a strong, influen
tial defender and tough ag
gressor on offense. Scrappy
sophomore forward Kelly Wes
terwick slammed in two goals,
one by a quick assist from cap
tain Amanda Read. Read also
scored a clean shot, offering
the Tigerdefense little reaction
time. Sukie Jackson, while
providing steady influence
through the game, also made
her presence known by scor
ing the last point of the day.

"We got our attack going,"
commented coach Barbara
Longstreth. "Our passing pat
terns really started to gel, and
we generated strong offense
off our defense." She pointed
out the fact that six of the eight
goals were scored from
second-line players, who are
hard to defend. Longstreth ad
ded, "We have a tremendous
amount of confidence now."
Stanford holds a 2-1 record
in conference play. The team
goes on the road to face Davis
next Wednesday.
