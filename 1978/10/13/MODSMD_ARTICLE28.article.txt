Stanford hosts its annual cross country meet
Saturday, with tough competition from all over
the state entered in the event.
Both the men's and the women's events
promise to be the biggest if not the best in re
centyears. Eighteen teams will be runninginthe
men's event, while the women have a total of 16
entries.
Such experienced runners as Duncan
McDonald (who ran in the 1976 Olympics and is
the former American record holder for the 5000
meters) and Arvid Kretz, both ex-Stanford stars,
will be participating. Other talent to look for in
the men's division are top runners Jim Shankel
and Dan Aldridge (who finished first and second
respectively in the Fresno Invitational two
weeks ago), along with Roy Kissin, who has
looked extremely strong in the Cards' previous
two events.
For the women, Cal's Jan Oehm (first at the
Fresno Invitational and second at the Berkeley
Invitational), and Suzanne Richter (second at
Fresno and third at Berkeley), Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo's Maggie Keyes (fourth at Berkeley), and
Stanford's two-time All America Anne Thrupp,
all will be competing on Saturday.
Although it will be extremely difficult for the
women to win the 5000 meter event, women's
coach Laurel Treon is confident they will finish
well within the top five. "We've been working
hard this week, andrunning on our home course
has to be an advantage," she said. Treon also
predicted that University of Texas-El Paso's De
bbie Pearson's course record of 17:40.0 "will be
challenged."

Running for the women will be Annette Mun
gai, Beth Harrison (both of whom are "improv
ing immensely," said Treon), Susan Bragdon,
Joanne Ernst, Karin Pascoe and Carolyn Layzer.
Stanford's top runner, Anne Thrupp, who has
been ailing in recent weeks, seems to becoming
around also.
"The (men's) race should be a lot quicker this
year with all the experienced runners," said
senior Jerry Emory, who finished third in last
week's dual event against Humbolt. Of the 18
teams entered in the men's event, eight of those
will be track clubs, with older and more experi
enced teams. Although their totals will not
count in the final tabulation, the club's presence
will make for a faster race.
This could cause problems for the men.
"Younger and relatively inexperienced runners
have a tendency to try and keep up with the
leaders instead of setting their own pace. They
could burn out after the first mile or so," said
Emory. But he noted it shouldn't bother the
Cards' top runner Roy Kissin too much. "If the
race is quick, it could trouble Roy," noted Em
ory. "But Roy's not intimidated by too many
runners."
The men look in good shape to finish first
among the collegiate teams. The Cards' main
competition will come from Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and U.C.-Irvine, along with the Santa
Monica Track Club. Running for the men will be
Kissin, Emory, Rod Berry, Tom Lobsinger, Bill
Haldeman, Craig Corey and Mitch Wasterlain.
The races will be at the Stanford Coif Course,
with the women slated to begin at 9:15 and the
meh at 10 a.m.
