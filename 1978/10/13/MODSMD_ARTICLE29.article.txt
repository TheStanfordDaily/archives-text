# Stanford's football physician keeping Cardinals competitive

The fullback plunges into
the line, only to be stacked
up by two 230-pound line
men. But before he can fall
iu the ground, he is hitagain
from the side, and he feels a
sharp pain in his knee. The
linemen slowly unpile, but
the fullback remains
sprawled on the ground.
His job, for the duration of
the season, or perhaps his
career, is over.
The work of the team doc
tor, however, has just be
gun. He must work quickly,
yet safely, to enable the
player to play next week,
next year or to simply walk
normally for the rest of his
life.
Stanford's team physi
cian, Dr. Fred Behling, is a
partner in the Palo Alto
Clinic, specializing in sports
medicine He is one of the
leaders in a field that has
been very much in the
limelight in recent years and
also serves as the team doc
tor for the San Francisco
Giants baseball franchise. In
21 years at Stanford, he has
seen a myraid of injuries,
heard the rumors of drug
abuse in college and pro
sports and developed opin
ions on how the sport of
football can be made safer,
without sacrificing its ex
citement.
In the high pressure envi
ronment of college football,
Behling insisted that he
feels none of it."The pres
sure is minimal. I don't even*
go around suspecting the
coaches anymore of want
ing to play people that are
hurt. The athletic director
makes it abundantly clear
that there is to be no quibbl
ing. I don't have any qualms
about saying, 'This guy
shouldn't play.' "
The only time that the de
cision is made by the coach
is in borderline situations.
"There is a gray area," Behl
ing said "where I can say,
'This player shouldn't play if
it's possible to keep him
out. But if he must play, he
can play.' "
One of the most impor
tant and difficult decision
for Behling to make is
whether or not to inject a
pain killer, thus enabling a
player to perform in an im
portant game. But he in

sisted that the player knows
the risks.
"You need to tell players
that there is some danger
and that there are some ill
effects of various medica
tions at times," he said. "He
must know these facts be
cause he's going to have to
live with himself a lot of
years past tomorrow's
game." In most cases, this
means that the player is told
the percentages and given
the option of refusing the
treatment. Dr. Behling was
quick to point out that
sometimes a player will re
fuse the treatment and
suggest different therapy,
and he said he respects their
opinion.
Though he did not totally
dismiss the possibility of
drug abuse in college foot
ball, Behling insisted that it
does not exist at Stanford.
"I probably wouldn't see
it (drug abuse by other
schools)," he said. "It's very
difficult for me to tell when
someone is keyed up
psychologically or when

they have had a stimulant,
unless I know the person
really, really well." He also
pointed out that reports of
drug abuse are often unreli
able. "If you see some one
put something in his mouth,
you don't know if that's as
pirin or an amphetamine."
Drug abuse in football is
difficult to pin down. On
the other hand, Behling said
he feels that injuries can be
prevented by the governing
bodies of football in a
number of ways.
Although the artificial
versus natural surface de
bate still rages, the doctor
relates that minor injuries
and general body soreness
definitely increase on the
synthetic surfaces. In addi
tion, minor injuries are
more easily aggravated and
friction burns are worse
than while playing on grass.
"There is no question that
the artificial turf is harder on
the body," said Behling.
Regardless of what sur
face is used, it is up to the
officials to prevent injury,

according to Behling. "I
think the rules, in general,
ir<- I think there is a
i* I enforcement."
In particular, he cited late
hits and spearing," the
helmet first tackle, as
injury-causing plays that are
only called when flagrant.
Not only does spearing en
danger the offensive player,
but it also can cause serious
injury to the tackler's neck.
"Perhaps the rules could
be made more strict," Behl
ing said. "I must say I think
the officials do a good job.
But I think they need to have
the confidence or the
psychology to call it (spear
ing) and to be extremely
aware of that rule. It's dif
ficult to enforce because
the player who makes a
good open-field tackle,
though he uses his helmet,
is sort of fulfilling the es
sence of football. And then
to penalize him 15 yards is
difficult psychology.
Behling said he teels that
the protective equipment of
the game is excellent. Ex
ternal padding on the
shoulder pads might be one
improvement. "The helmet
does almost too good a job
of protecting the head, be
cause it gives the player a
degree of confidence about
using his head almost as a
weapon. The neck is incap
able of absorbing all that
shock," Behling explained.
"I've been somewhat dis
turbed with all this talk
about externally padding
the helmet," he added.
"Padding will increase the
friction on the helmet, and
therefore put more stress
on the neck." Rather than
sliding off some objects, the
helmet would grip and
cause the neck to twist.
Despite having to deal
with the displeasing side of
football, Behling said he en
joys his job immensely.
And how does he feel
when he sends a fit player
back to the team and the
player makes the winning
play?
"You get moreenjoyment
out of those people whose
career you may have contri
buted to," Behling said.
"But you get the same feel
ing if you know someone is
going to be able to walk bet
ter."

The fullback plunges into
the line, only to be stacked
up by two 230-pound line
men. But before he can fall
iu the ground, he is hitagain
from the side, and he feels a
sharp pain in his knee. The
linemen slowly unpile, but
the fullback remains
sprawled on the ground.
His job, for the duration of
the season, or perhaps his
career, is over.
The work of the team doc
tor, however, has just be
gun. He must work quickly,
yet safely, to enable the
player to play next week,
next year or to simply walk
normally for the rest of his
life.
Stanford's team physi
cian, Dr. Fred Behling, is a
partner in the Palo Alto
Clinic, specializing in sports
medicine He is one of the
leaders in a field that has
been very much in the
limelight in recent years and
also serves as the team doc
tor for the San Francisco
Giants baseball franchise. In
21 years at Stanford, he has
seen a myraid of injuries,
heard the rumors of drug
abuse in college and pro
sports and developed opin
ions on how the sport of
football can be made safer,
without sacrificing its ex
citement.
In the high pressure envi
ronment of college football,
Behling insisted that he
feels none of it."The pres
sure is minimal. I don't even*
go around suspecting the
coaches anymore of want
ing to play people that are
hurt. The athletic director
makes it abundantly clear
that there is to be no quibbl
ing. I don't have any qualms
about saying, 'This guy
shouldn't play.' "
The only time that the de
cision is made by the coach
is in borderline situations.
"There is a gray area," Behl
ing said "where I can say,
'This player shouldn't play if
it's possible to keep him
out. But if he must play, he
can play.' "
One of the most impor
tant and difficult decision
for Behling to make is
whether or not to inject a
pain killer, thus enabling a
player to perform in an im
portant game. But he in

sisted that the player knows
the risks.
"You need to tell players
that there is some danger
and that there are some ill
effects of various medica
tions at times," he said. "He
must know these facts be
cause he's going to have to
live with himself a lot of
years past tomorrow's
game." In most cases, this
means that the player is told
the percentages and given
the option of refusing the
treatment. Dr. Behling was
quick to point out that
sometimes a player will re
fuse the treatment and
suggest different therapy,
and he said he respects their
opinion.
Though he did not totally
dismiss the possibility of
drug abuse in college foot
ball, Behling insisted that it
does not exist at Stanford.
"I probably wouldn't see
it (drug abuse by other
schools)," he said. "It's very
difficult for me to tell when
someone is keyed up
psychologically or when

they have had a stimulant,
unless I know the person
really, really well." He also
pointed out that reports of
drug abuse are often unreli
able. "If you see some one
put something in his mouth,
you don't know if that's as
pirin or an amphetamine."
Drug abuse in football is
difficult to pin down. On
the other hand, Behling said
he feels that injuries can be
prevented by the governing
bodies of football in a
number of ways.
Although the artificial
versus natural surface de
bate still rages, the doctor
relates that minor injuries
and general body soreness
definitely increase on the
synthetic surfaces. In addi
tion, minor injuries are
more easily aggravated and
friction burns are worse
than while playing on grass.
"There is no question that
the artificial turf is harder on
the body," said Behling.
Regardless of what sur
face is used, it is up to the
officials to prevent injury,

according to Behling. "I
think the rules, in general,
ir<- I think there is a
i* I enforcement."
In particular, he cited late
hits and spearing," the
helmet first tackle, as
injury-causing plays that are
only called when flagrant.
Not only does spearing en
danger the offensive player,
but it also can cause serious
injury to the tackler's neck.
"Perhaps the rules could
be made more strict," Behl
ing said. "I must say I think
the officials do a good job.
But I think they need to have
the confidence or the
psychology to call it (spear
ing) and to be extremely
aware of that rule. It's dif
ficult to enforce because
the player who makes a
good open-field tackle,
though he uses his helmet,
is sort of fulfilling the es
sence of football. And then
to penalize him 15 yards is
difficult psychology.
Behling said he teels that
the protective equipment of
the game is excellent. Ex
ternal padding on the
shoulder pads might be one
improvement. "The helmet
does almost too good a job
of protecting the head, be
cause it gives the player a
degree of confidence about
using his head almost as a
weapon. The neck is incap
able of absorbing all that
shock," Behling explained.
"I've been somewhat dis
turbed with all this talk
about externally padding
the helmet," he added.
"Padding will increase the
friction on the helmet, and
therefore put more stress
on the neck." Rather than
sliding off some objects, the
helmet would grip and
cause the neck to twist.
Despite having to deal
with the displeasing side of
football, Behling said he en
joys his job immensely.
And how does he feel
when he sends a fit player
back to the team and the
player makes the winning
play?
"You get moreenjoyment
out of those people whose
career you may have contri
buted to," Behling said.
"But you get the same feel

sliding off some objects, the

cause the neck to twist.

The fullback plunges into
the line, only to be stacked
up by two 230-pound line
men. But before he can fall
iu the ground, he is hitagain
from the side, and he feels a
sharp pain in his knee. The
linemen slowly unpile, but
the fullback remains
sprawled on the ground.
His job, for the duration of
the season, or perhaps his
career, is over.
The work of the team doc
tor, however, has just be
gun. He must work quickly,
yet safely, to enable the
player to play next week,
next year or to simply walk
normally for the rest of his
life.
Stanford's team physi
cian, Dr. Fred Behling, is a
partner in the Palo Alto
Clinic, specializing in sports
medicine He is one of the
leaders in a field that has
been very much in the
limelight in recent years and
also serves as the team doc
tor for the San Francisco
Giants baseball franchise. In
21 years at Stanford, he has
seen a myraid of injuries,
heard the rumors of drug
abuse in college and pro
sports and developed opin
ions on how the sport of
football can be made safer,
without sacrificing its ex
citement.
In the high pressure envi
ronment of college football,
Behling insisted that he
feels none of it."The pres
sure is minimal. I don't even*
go around suspecting the
coaches anymore of want
ing to play people that are
hurt. The athletic director
makes it abundantly clear
that there is to be no quibbl
ing. I don't have any qualms
about saying, 'This guy
shouldn't play.' "
The only time that the de
cision is made by the coach
is in borderline situations.
"There is a gray area," Behl
ing said "where I can say,
'This player shouldn't play if
it's possible to keep him
out. But if he must play, he
can play.' "
One of the most impor
tant and difficult decision
for Behling to make is
whether or not to inject a
pain killer, thus enabling a
player to perform in an im
portant game. But he in

sisted that the player knows
the risks.
"You need to tell players
that there is some danger
and that there are some ill
effects of various medica
tions at times," he said. "He
must know these facts be
cause he's going to have to
live with himself a lot of
years past tomorrow's
game." In most cases, this
means that the player is told
the percentages and given
the option of refusing the
treatment. Dr. Behling was
quick to point out that
sometimes a player will re
fuse the treatment and
suggest different therapy,
and he said he respects their
opinion.
Though he did not totally
dismiss the possibility of
drug abuse in college foot
ball, Behling insisted that it
does not exist at Stanford.
"I probably wouldn't see
it (drug abuse by other
schools)," he said. "It's very
difficult for me to tell when
someone is keyed up
psychologically or when

they have had a stimulant,
unless I know the person
really, really well." He also
pointed out that reports of
drug abuse are often unreli
able. "If you see some one
put something in his mouth,
you don't know if that's as
pirin or an amphetamine."
Drug abuse in football is
difficult to pin down. On
the other hand, Behling said
he feels that injuries can be
prevented by the governing
bodies of football in a
number of ways.
Although the artificial
versus natural surface de
bate still rages, the doctor
relates that minor injuries
and general body soreness
definitely increase on the
synthetic surfaces. In addi
tion, minor injuries are
more easily aggravated and
friction burns are worse
than while playing on grass.
"There is no question that
the artificial turf is harder on
the body," said Behling.
Regardless of what sur
face is used, it is up to the
officials to prevent injury,

according to Behling. "I
think the rules, in general,
ir<- I think there is a
i* I enforcement."
In particular, he cited late
hits and spearing," the
helmet first tackle, as
injury-causing plays that are
only called when flagrant.
Not only does spearing en
danger the offensive player,
but it also can cause serious
injury to the tackler's neck.
"Perhaps the rules could
be made more strict," Behl
ing said. "I must say I think
the officials do a good job.
But I think they need to have
the confidence or the
psychology to call it (spear
ing) and to be extremely
aware of that rule. It's dif
ficult to enforce because
the player who makes a
good open-field tackle,
though he uses his helmet,
is sort of fulfilling the es
sence of football. And then
to penalize him 15 yards is
difficult psychology.
Behling said he teels that
the protective equipment of
the game is excellent. Ex
ternal padding on the
shoulder pads might be one
improvement. "The helmet
does almost too good a job
of protecting the head, be
cause it gives the player a
degree of confidence about
using his head almost as a
weapon. The neck is incap
able of absorbing all that
shock," Behling explained.
"I've been somewhat dis
turbed with all this talk
about externally padding
the helmet," he added.
"Padding will increase the
friction on the helmet, and
therefore put more stress
on the neck." Rather than
sliding off some objects, the
helmet would grip and
cause the neck to twist.
