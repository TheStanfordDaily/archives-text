# Against University's Hospital
## Palo Alto doctors consider suit 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
A new group of about 150 Palo Alto
physicians on the medical staff may
use legal proceedings to regain ac
cess to the University Hospital's
laboratories and clinical services.
"We're going to have to have
much more support if we decide to
go against Stanford," Paul Cooney,
chairman for the Community Physi
cians for Patient Care, told members
last night. "It's up to you how hard
and how far you're willing to go."
Burt McDowell, chairman of the
organization's legal subcommittee,
said an attorney has been retained to
research the University's legal in
teractions with Palo Alto.
"We have to know what legal
grounds we have to stand on," he
said. "Presently, there are no plans
for litigation."
The local physicians decided to
band together to fight the University,
after the Hospital Board of Directors
issued a memo Aug. 1, which closed
several hospital facilities and services
to private physicians.
Privileges kept
Of the 550 community physicians
on the medical staff, only 41 still hold
privileges in the clinical services.
These doctors are exempt from the
new ruling, because of a 1968 con
tract between the Hospital and Palo
Alto.
Cooney said community physi
cians were "thunderstruck" by the
board's memo.
"Medicine is undergoing a techni
cal revolution and Stanford is saying,
'We're cutting you off from discover

ing the new techniques of
medicine/ " Cooney said.
Cooney's group recently received
support from the Palo Alto Medical
Clinics.
The Hospital board decided to
maintain the controversial "closed
staff rule," after more than six
months of hearings and delibera
tions. The University had argued the

rule was "essential to the successful
research and teaching missions of
the School of Medicine."
Cooney said the Hospital is being
pressured to close its facilities to
community physicians because of
economical reasons.
"Stanford, like many other univer
sity hospitals around the country, is a
victim of its own success," agreed
Spyros Andreopoulos, information
officer at the medical information of
fice. "So many students leave the
university hospital and set up prac
tice in the nearby town and before
too long, the hospital can't provide
facilities for all the new physicians."
"There's no place for new doctors
to do research in Palo Alto now,"
Cooney said. "Doctors will have to
be fools to come to this community
to practice medicine. Stanford is the
only show in town."

This situation has the dual effect of
"markedly diminishing the patient's
freedom of choice" and creating a
monopoly on medical care for the
Hospital," he said.
"Patients will not have a choice of
physicians," he explained. "They will
either have to go to the Hospital for
care or receive a new brand of sub
standard medicine from the local
doctors, who don't have access to
the University's facilities."
This monopoly makes it "inevita
ble" that Stanford will increase costs
to the patient, Cooney said.

new ruling, because of a 1968 con
tract between the Hospital and Palo
Alto.
Cooney said community physi
cians were "thunderstruck" by the
board's memo.
"Medicine is undergoing a techni
cal revolution and Stanford is saying,
'We're cutting you off from discover

ing the new techniques of
medicine/ " Cooney said.
Cooney's group recently received
support from the Palo Alto Medical
Clinics.
The Hospital board decided to
maintain the controversial "closed
staff rule," after more than six
months of hearings and delibera
tions. The University had argued the

rule was "essential to the successful
research and teaching missions of
the School of Medicine."
Cooney said the Hospital is being
pressured to close its facilities to
community physicians because of
economical reasons.
"Stanford, like many other univer
sity hospitals around the country, is a
victim of its own success," agreed
Spyros Andreopoulos, information
officer at the medical information of
fice. "So many students leave the
university hospital and set up prac
tice in the nearby town and before
too long, the hospital can't provide
facilities for all the new physicians."
"There's no place for new doctors
to do research in Palo Alto now,"
Cooney said. "Doctors will have to
be fools to come to this community
to practice medicine. Stanford is the
only show in town."

This situation has the dual effect of
"markedly diminishing the patient's
freedom of choice" and creating a
monopoly on medical care for the
Hospital," he said.
"Patients will not have a choice of
physicians," he explained. "They will
either have to go to the Hospital for
care or receive a new brand of sub
standard medicine from the local
doctors, who don't have access to
the University's facilities."
This monopoly makes it "inevita
ble" that Stanford will increase costs
to the patient, Cooney said.
A new group of about 150 Palo Alto
physicians on the medical staff may
use legal proceedings to regain ac
cess to the University Hospital's
laboratories and clinical services.
"We're going to have to have
much more support if we decide to
go against Stanford," Paul Cooney,
chairman for the Community Physi
cians for Patient Care, told members
last night. "It's up to you how hard
and how far you're willing to go."
Burt McDowell, chairman of the
organization's legal subcommittee,
said an attorney has been retained to
research the University's legal in
teractions with Palo Alto.
"We have to know what legal
grounds we have to stand on," he
said. "Presently, there are no plans
for litigation."
The local physicians decided to
band together to fight the University,
after the Hospital Board of Directors
issued a memo Aug. 1, which closed
several hospital facilities and services
to private physicians.
Privileges kept
Of the 550 community physicians
on the medical staff, only 41 still hold
privileges in the clinical services.
These doctors are exempt from the
new ruling, because of a 1968 con
tract between the Hospital and Palo
Alto.
