# Against University's Hospital
## Palo Alto doctors consider suit 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
A new group of about 150 Palo Alto
physicians on the medical staff may
use legal proceedings to regain ac
cess to the University Hospital's
laboratories and clinical services.
"We're going to have to have
much more support if we decide to
go against Stanford," Paul Cooney,
chairman for the Community Physi
cians for Patient Care, told members
last night. "It's up to you how hard
and how far you're willing to go."
Burt McDowell, chairman of the
organization's legal subcommittee,
said an attorney has been retained to

"We have to know what legal
grounds we have to stand on," he
said. "Presently, there are no plans

The local physicians decided to
band together to fight the University,

issued a memo Aug. 1, which closed
several hospital facilities and services
to private physicians.
Privileges kept
Of the 550 community physicians
on the medical staff, only 41 still hold
privileges in the clinical services.
These doctors are exempt from the
new ruling, because of a 1968 con
tract between the Hospital and Palo
Alto.
Cooney said community physi
cians were "thunderstruck" by the
board's memo.
"Medicine is undergoing a techni
cal revolution and Stanford is saying,
'We're cutting you off from discover

ing the new techniques of
medicine/ " Cooney said.
Cooney's group recently received
support from the Palo Alto Medical
Clinics.
The Hospital board decided to
maintain the controversial "closed
staff rule," after more than six
months of hearings and delibera
tions. The University had argued the

rule was "essential to the successful
research and teaching missions of
the School of Medicine."
Cooney said the Hospital is being
pressured to close its facilities to
community physicians because of
economical reasons.
"Stanford, like many other univer
