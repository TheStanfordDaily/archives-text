# Thrupp alters program
## 
### SUE SHELDON 
It wasn't until two-time All-
America runner Ann Thrupp
placed third in the 10,000 meter
run at the AAU Nationals that
the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment realized it might have in
its midst one of the finest long
distance runners in the nation.
"When I was named All-
America for the first time,"
commented Thrupp, "Stan
ford's cross country team
didn't even have cl ub status, so
we couldn't compete in the
collegiate nationals. We were
just a group of girls, interested
in running, coached by an up
perclassman volunteering his
time."
It didn't take Stanford long
to correct its oversight. The fol
lowing year the cross country
team received varsity club
status and went on to qualify as
a team for the nationals, where
Thrupp again received All-
America honors.
Sound a little pen ir? Hi
evolution of the women's run
ning program wasn't half as
peculiar as the way Thrupp
herself stumbled on the scene.
"It was kind of a fluke," she
said. "The summer prior to my
freshman year at SU, I ran a
couple of miles everyday just
to keep in shape. When I tried
out for the women's basketball
team, I ran a 12 min. two-mile,
so the coach sent my name
over to the track department.
I've been running ever since."
If the rags-to-riches cliche
could be used to describe
Thrupp's success, then so
could another favorite: it
couldn't happen to a nicer gal.
According to cross country
coach Laurel Treon, "Ann is
confident enough of her own
abilities that she is an inspira
tion to the other girls. She's an
excellent model." Treon went
on to add, "Cross country
takes a special kind of athlete;
Ann is that athlete. She's com
mitted to her own excellence."
Freshman hopeful Karin
Pascoe would hasten to agree.
"Ann comes out everyday and
works out with us. If I wanted
to, I feel I could ask her to run
with me. I really think she'd do
it...but I'd hate to slow her
down."
By Thrupp's own admission,
there wasn't any magic formula
to success. "I never set any
goals when I started. I was en
joying myself and doing well.
There was no reason to stop
and analyze anything." Mus
ing, Thrupp added, "I've
reached a point now where I
feel tremendous elation when I
run over four or five miles."
For the weekend joggers on
campus, that last comment
might indicate Thrupp has
reached a higher plane than
the rest of us. While she
doesn't condemn the jogging
boom, she does have mixed
feelings about it."I don't think
the important thing should be
what kind of shoes you
have...it's just a little too fad
dish for me. But it's a healthy
fad."
Like many zealous athletes,
Thrupp has suffered her share
of injuries due to overtraining.
The summer before he junior
year she went to Colorado and
ran in road races every

weekend.
"The races were a lot of fun.
About 500 of us, mostly men,
would run. The competition
was very low-key," said
Thrupp. She found out later
that she set a course record on
a race that took her 14 miles
straight up a mountain: from
10,000 to 14,000 feet.
Those who at this point
would mention the Olympics
as a future possibility for
Thrupp might be disap
pointed. "I have no desire to
try for the Olympics. The

longest race they have is 1500
meters. It's just too short for
me. I really don't know what I
want to do with my running."
Thrupp is optimistic about
the future of the women's run
ning program however; a
program she herself helped
create.
"As for me, I see my em
phasis moving away from run
ning and more toward
academics. Running is still very
important, but more as a re
lease time . . . a time of enjoy
ment."
