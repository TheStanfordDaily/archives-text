## dance/lael stone An excellent professional ballet company — in San Mateo 
### 
My first question when I
heard about Peninsuia Ballet
Theatre, was — why attempt to
have a professional ballet
company in San Mateo? After I
saw the company at work, and
heard its philosophy of
community-based art, I
realized the absurdity of my
question. My first exposure to
Peninsula Ballet Theatre (PBT)
came while visiting the com
pany rehearsal and speaking
with its artistic director, Anne
Bena. She noted a trend in the
dance world today, away from
the expensive touring com
panies which are amalgama
tions of dancers from many dif
ferent schools, to resident
companies drawn primarily
from an affiliated school.
Examples of such name
brand choreography in com
panies as young as PBT are
rare. PBT was created in its pre
sent form, in 1971 by Anne
Bena, who was trained in Now
York by Russian artists. The

company lists itself (quite
frankly) as being composed of
"30 young dancers." Nine are
still in high school, although
the company's two principals
are more experienced, having
danced with the Stuttgart and
the loffrey Ballet companies
before returning to PBT. The
dancers are almost all trained
by the affiliated school of the
same name, and represent sol
idly trained classical dancers.
Although the quality of the
dancers' port de bras could
have been improved, the hips
are generally well-lifted and
the feet, well-developed.
All but four of the company
members volunteer their time
completely, although Bena
stated that she hopes to in
crease the number paid to 10
by 1980. Work with PBT is
nonetheless time-consuming,
and I was surprised to learn
that one of the company's sol
oists, Bill Laaser, is a Ph.D.
candidate in computer science

at the University. (He was
trained in Kansas City and
came to PBT on the advice of
friends who had danced in the
area.)
Laaser is in fact featured in
the opening piece of this
week's company perfor
mances. This is a pas de trois
excerpted from a longer work
to be premiered in the '79-' BO
season. Rigaudon, created by
the company's principal dan
cers, and resident choreog
raphers, Sam Weber, formerly
of Joffrey, and Rosine Bena,
formerly of Stuttgart, aludes to
ballet's origins in the French
Court.
The next piece on the prog
ram is Flower Festival, a pas
deux originally choreographed
by Auguste Bourneville in 1058
for the Royal Danish Ballet.
This piece is appealing because
of the interaction between the
company's first solists, Lorretta
Barlett, a quick, sharp dancer
with some performing pre

sence, and Karstyn McCoy, her
able and secure partner, with a
firmer quality ot movement.
The last piece on the prog
ram represents a genre found
in the repertoires of most
major companies, the lightly
satirical, comic piece. The
Pennsylvania Ballet, for
example, does a piece with
immediate, contemporary ap
peal. Composed of short
sketches, it spoofs sports from
jogging to soccer, and karate.
The best of this genre is Jerome
Robbins' (of NVCB) The Con
cert, which dramatizes diffe
rent people s thoughts as they
listen to a pianist. The place of
comic and light pieces, easily
accessible to someone new to
dance is undeniable. PBT's
choice for this program, Carn
ival Tu-Tu, choreographed by
Dick Ford, unfortunately
exemplifies contrived rather
than creative imagination. The
piece is, in contrast to the
other pieces on the program, a

■ #
full company piece, but the
situations that we see the com
pany in are, although pleasant
enough, somewhat trite.
Many companies with good
to excellent dancers have great
difficulty in finding choreog
raphers to match their ability.
PBT is certainly lucky to have
John Cranko's Holborg Suite in
its repertory. The piece will be
danced this Saturday and Sun
day by Bena and Weber.
This weekend's perfor
mances on October 14 and 15
in Palo Alto, in the Spangen
berg theater, on 780 Arastrad
ero Road, are at 8 and 2:30 p.m.
respectively. They open the
company's fall season with tive
short pieces of varied tone and
personality.
The company will repeat this
weekend's programs in San
Mateo on November 4 (8 p.m.)
and Novembers (2:30 p.m.), in
the San Mateo Performing Arts
Center at 650 North Delaware.

deux originally choreographed
by Auguste Bourneville in 1058
for the Royal Danish Ballet.
This piece is appealing because
of the interaction between the
company's first solists, Lorretta
Barlett, a quick, sharp dancer
with some performing pre

sence, and Karstyn McCoy, her
able and secure partner, with a
firmer quality ot movement.
The last piece on the prog
ram represents a genre found
in the repertoires of most
major companies, the lightly
satirical, comic piece. The
Pennsylvania Ballet, for
example, does a piece with
immediate, contemporary ap
peal. Composed of short
sketches, it spoofs sports from
jogging to soccer, and karate.
The best of this genre is Jerome
Robbins' (of NVCB) The Con
cert, which dramatizes diffe
rent people s thoughts as they
listen to a pianist. The place of
comic and light pieces, easily
accessible to someone new to
dance is undeniable. PBT's
choice for this program, Carn
ival Tu-Tu, choreographed by
Dick Ford, unfortunately
exemplifies contrived rather
than creative imagination. The
piece is, in contrast to the
other pieces on the program, a

■ #
full company piece, but the
situations that we see the com
pany in are, although pleasant
enough, somewhat trite.
Many companies with good
to excellent dancers have great
difficulty in finding choreog
raphers to match their ability.
PBT is certainly lucky to have
John Cranko's Holborg Suite in
its repertory. The piece will be
danced this Saturday and Sun
day by Bena and Weber.
This weekend's perfor
mances on October 14 and 15
in Palo Alto, in the Spangen
berg theater, on 780 Arastrad
ero Road, are at 8 and 2:30 p.m.
respectively. They open the
company's fall season with tive
short pieces of varied tone and
personality.
The company will repeat this
weekend's programs in San
Mateo on November 4 (8 p.m.)
and Novembers (2:30 p.m.), in
the San Mateo Performing Arts
Center at 650 North Delaware.

My first question when I
heard about Peninsuia Ballet
Theatre, was — why attempt to
have a professional ballet
company in San Mateo? After I
saw the company at work, and
heard its philosophy of
community-based art, I
realized the absurdity of my
question. My first exposure to
Peninsula Ballet Theatre (PBT)
came while visiting the com
pany rehearsal and speaking
with its artistic director, Anne
Bena. She noted a trend in the
dance world today, away from
the expensive touring com
panies which are amalgama
tions of dancers from many dif
ferent schools, to resident
companies drawn primarily
from an affiliated school.
Examples of such name
brand choreography in com
panies as young as PBT are
rare. PBT was created in its pre
sent form, in 1971 by Anne
Bena, who was trained in Now
York by Russian artists. The

company lists itself (quite
frankly) as being composed of
"30 young dancers." Nine are
still in high school, although
the company's two principals
are more experienced, having
danced with the Stuttgart and
the loffrey Ballet companies
before returning to PBT. The
dancers are almost all trained
by the affiliated school of the
same name, and represent sol
idly trained classical dancers.
Although the quality of the
dancers' port de bras could
have been improved, the hips
are generally well-lifted and
the feet, well-developed.
All but four of the company
members volunteer their time
completely, although Bena
stated that she hopes to in
crease the number paid to 10
by 1980. Work with PBT is
nonetheless time-consuming,
and I was surprised to learn
that one of the company's sol
oists, Bill Laaser, is a Ph.D.
candidate in computer science

at the University. (He was
trained in Kansas City and
came to PBT on the advice of
friends who had danced in the
area.)
Laaser is in fact featured in
the opening piece of this
week's company perfor
mances. This is a pas de trois
excerpted from a longer work
to be premiered in the '79-' BO
season. Rigaudon, created by
the company's principal dan
cers, and resident choreog
raphers, Sam Weber, formerly
of Joffrey, and Rosine Bena,
formerly of Stuttgart, aludes to
ballet's origins in the French
Court.

community-based art, I
realized the absurdity of my
question. My first exposure to
Peninsula Ballet Theatre (PBT)
came while visiting the com
pany rehearsal and speaking
with its artistic director, Anne
Bena. She noted a trend in the
dance world today, away from
the expensive touring com
panies which are amalgama
tions of dancers from many dif
ferent schools, to resident
companies drawn primarily
from an affiliated school.
Examples of such name
brand choreography in com
panies as young as PBT are
rare. PBT was created in its pre
sent form, in 1971 by Anne
Bena, who was trained in Now
York by Russian artists. The

company lists itself (quite
frankly) as being composed of
"30 young dancers." Nine are
still in high school, although
the company's two principals
are more experienced, having
danced with the Stuttgart and
the loffrey Ballet companies
before returning to PBT. The
dancers are almost all trained
by the affiliated school of the
same name, and represent sol
idly trained classical dancers.
Although the quality of the
dancers' port de bras could
have been improved, the hips
are generally well-lifted and
the feet, well-developed.
All but four of the company
members volunteer their time
completely, although Bena
stated that she hopes to in
crease the number paid to 10
by 1980. Work with PBT is
nonetheless time-consuming,
and I was surprised to learn
that one of the company's sol
oists, Bill Laaser, is a Ph.D.
candidate in computer science

at the University. (He was
trained in Kansas City and
came to PBT on the advice of
friends who had danced in the
area.)
Laaser is in fact featured in
the opening piece of this
week's company perfor
mances. This is a pas de trois
excerpted from a longer work
to be premiered in the '79-' BO
season. Rigaudon, created by
the company's principal dan
cers, and resident choreog
raphers, Sam Weber, formerly
of Joffrey, and Rosine Bena,
formerly of Stuttgart, aludes to
ballet's origins in the French
Court.
The next piece on the prog
ram is Flower Festival, a pas
deux originally choreographed
by Auguste Bourneville in 1058
for the Royal Danish Ballet.
This piece is appealing because
of the interaction between the
company's first solists, Lorretta
Barlett, a quick, sharp dancer
with some performing pre

sence, and Karstyn McCoy, her
able and secure partner, with a
firmer quality ot movement.
The last piece on the prog
ram represents a genre found
in the repertoires of most
major companies, the lightly
satirical, comic piece. The
Pennsylvania Ballet, for
example, does a piece with
immediate, contemporary ap
peal. Composed of short
sketches, it spoofs sports from
jogging to soccer, and karate.
The best of this genre is Jerome
Robbins' (of NVCB) The Con
cert, which dramatizes diffe
rent people s thoughts as they
listen to a pianist. The place of
comic and light pieces, easily
accessible to someone new to
dance is undeniable. PBT's
choice for this program, Carn
ival Tu-Tu, choreographed by
Dick Ford, unfortunately
exemplifies contrived rather
than creative imagination. The
piece is, in contrast to the
other pieces on the program, a

■ #
full company piece, but the
situations that we see the com
pany in are, although pleasant
enough, somewhat trite.
Many companies with good
to excellent dancers have great
difficulty in finding choreog
raphers to match their ability.
PBT is certainly lucky to have
John Cranko's Holborg Suite in
its repertory. The piece will be
danced this Saturday and Sun
day by Bena and Weber.
This weekend's perfor
mances on October 14 and 15
in Palo Alto, in the Spangen
berg theater, on 780 Arastrad
ero Road, are at 8 and 2:30 p.m.
respectively. They open the
company's fall season with tive
short pieces of varied tone and
personality.
The company will repeat this
weekend's programs in San
Mateo on November 4 (8 p.m.)
and Novembers (2:30 p.m.), in
the San Mateo Performing Arts
Center at 650 North Delaware.
