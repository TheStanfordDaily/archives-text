Saturday Night Fever -kit-kit
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're think
ing. You're thinking that be
cause John Travolta makes a
fool of himself on television
every week he can't possibly
be any good here, and that
anyone who likes him must be
some kind of groupie who
probably got low SAT scores.
You're thinking that disco is
about as exciting as leprosy
and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision
whatsoever.
You've got a point too, ex
cept that its uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's lousy SAT's. Yet
Saturday Night Fever does
have a fixity about it which at
times is very appealing, and
Travolta is a legitimate star (he
plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The
movie has no nutritional
value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that danc
ing as inherently unimpor
tant, but that's their fault, re
ally. If they scoff at you you
should punch them in the
nose.
—John Nielsen
The Boys from Brazil it it
Coronet
While I suppose that it is
quite possible to respect The
Boys from Brazil for being a
professionally crafted thriller,
I never found myself liking it.
Boys gets it done, but in a very
cold way. The worst dam
pener is that you never really
get close enough to get in
volved —the movie keeps its
distance.
However, the two stars,
Gregory Peck and Laurence
Olivier, give engaging per
formances. And at certain
moments, such as when
either of them do something
that is just right, you begin to
get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the
film that it begins to unnerve
you.
The movie needs the reck
less energy — the sense of
urgency — that the best thril
lers have, and which young
directors like Brian De Pal ma
and Steven Spielberg infuse
into their movies. I emphasize
young because it is a central
issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so
much.
—Ron Lillejord
The Big Fix iritit
Old Mill
Now that it's almost the end

of the 70s, moviemakers are
exploring what the '60s gen
eration is currently up to.
Among the new releases deal
ing with this is Jeremy Paul
Kagan's The Big Fix.
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced
father and ex-Berkeley ac
tivist. A former fellow student
and lover (Susan Anspach)
reappears and draws the now
cynical Wine back into the
world of moral and political
ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently ac
quired cynicism. If you're not
interested in a provocative
and sadly humorous film, The
Big Fix is also a superb sus
pense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a
gubernatorial campaign.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self
conscious and loses its integ
ration. However, Dreyfuss
and his supporting cast give
thoughtful and subtle per
formances even when the
script fails them
—Amy Cerstin
Viva Italia! ★★★
Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two
to over 20 and which range in
quality from pointless to
nearly perfect. There are at
least two sketches which by
themselves make this movie
worth seeing: one is a truly
moving portrait of how an old
woman is too proud to object
when her callous son takes
her to a nursing home without
informing her first; the other
is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is
broken up when his straight
man recounts his jokes in the
eulogy. An uneven film re
deemed by its quirky, wry wit.
—Jim Mattson
[quus
Sunday — Mem Aud
Richard Burton really rips
into the role of Martin Dysart,
a psychiatrist who finds him
self unable to cope with a par
ticular boy's act of passion —
the blinding of six horses.
Sidney Lumet, the director,
fails to successfully transfer
this stylized play to the sc
reen. His decision to literalize
the blinding of the horses,
using the bloodiness of the
act as a substitute for real ef
fectiveness, shows particu
larly poor judgment.
Lumet lets his actors go,
achieving spectacular results
with Burton and getting solid
performances from both
Peter Firth as the troubled
child and JennyAgutteras the
girl who sets off Firth's act of

passion. But, on balance,
Equus is a disappointment.
—R.L.
Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies
in its own charm and cute
ness. The director and star,
Jack Nicholson, has admitted
that he wanted Coin' South to
be a romantic fantasy like
those of Preston Sturges and
Ernst Lubitsch.And even
though Nicholson and his
movie often are working un
erringly in this form, it ap
pears that they are holding
themselves back to get there.
Coin' South's restraint asnd
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of
acting moves which simply

never appear here, and the
movie is so concerned with
being pleasant that it kills all
of the material's possible ex
citement.
Nicholson plays a lovable
rogue in the Old West, and as
the movie drifted along to its
inevitable happy ending, all I
could think about was why.
Why is Nicholson playing it
safe? Why does he now want
to be cute?

sistently striking performer,
and because of this he has
achieved a deserved amount
of security. Coin' South re
flects that security, and in the
worst way. Nicholson needs
to be socially irresponsible;
maybe Go/n' South'* failure
will lead him in thatdirection.
—R.L.
Interiors
Park
Woody Allen d serves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors
is sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising
is that it is not more so, since
this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi
ence.
But when Interiors works,

and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen
Stapleton, Diane Keaton and
Marybeth Hurl are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble
are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.
Who is Killing the
Great Chefs of Europe 112 if if if
Palo Alto Square
It would have been reallv
easy to dismiss this movie as
just pure fluff handled in a
fake style way, but I enjoyed
the damn thing, and I won't
deny it. Chefs is a great
throwaway movie, and even
though some of its chemistry
never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset
pairing especially), the movie
works on a semi-classy 'what
the hell' level. Robert Morley
overacts sozealousy that you
begin to enjoy it.
— K.L.
Death on the Nile if if if
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he
slides into seriousness in time
for the patented Agatha Chris
tie climax. A solid mystery,
nicely photographed, well set
out. But perhaps Gulf and
Western (who own
Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put
their 14 million dollars to a dif
ferent use. Or, better yet,
maybe they should keep mak
ing these safe, inoffensive
and generally well made en
tertainments and use the pro
fits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't
happen though; the board of
directors would never allow
it.
—R.L.
A Wedding if if
Menlo
Writer-director Robert
Altman returns to Nashville's
style but his subject is not
nearly so arresting. While A
Wedding often exhibits quick
flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements ap
pear to have been left in un
finished form, and the charac
terization is particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages
to create a sharply defined
character, and as a consequ
ence, she dominates the movie
in what is a performance of
great emotional range.
—R.L.

Somebody Killed
Her Husband ir
Bijou
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is
married to a man who's idea of a
dinner toast is to mumble "my
first today." Close friend |eff
Bridges is a writer of chil
dren's books who is unpub
lished forall the right reasons.
When the duo find Farrah's
husband stuck to a table with
a knife, they stash the corpse
in the refrigerator for want of
anything better to do. Even
Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this
half-baked non-mystery, and
here the blandness of the
female lead and the ineptness
of director Lamont Johnson
combine to create an enter
tainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.
—J.M.
Heaven Can Wail ★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber
story without the bite. De
pendant for its success upon
machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue —
if the movie is to work it must
continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty, though
big and strong, has more than
a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinate persistance
and a stubborn sense that he's
been cheated. (Strange as it
sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported by
those of a well-addled sup
porting cast.)
It has been noted
everywhere that the picture is
based on a '41 Robert
Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a re
make as it is an effort to
exume a kind of movie that I'd
thought was dead and gone. It
doesn't just stick old lines into
new faces and play off its in
feriority to the original — this
is a thoughtful reintroduction
to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is
currently the norm. Very
good. Never again will I con
fuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.
—j.N.
Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands ★★★
Aquarius
Dona Flor, a widow who
marries a dependable but
none too exciting druggist,
manages to get the best of two
worlds when her rakish first
husband comes back from the
dead to return romance to her
life. Dona Flor is a warm, often
very funny import from Brazil.

Very wry. Like a Thurber

pendant for its success upon
machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue —
if the movie is to work it must
continually outwit its audi

And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty, though
big and strong, has more than
a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinate persistance
and a stubborn sense that he's
been cheated. (Strange as it
sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported by
those of a well-addled sup
porting cast.)
It has been noted
everywhere that the picture is
based on a '41 Robert
Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a re
make as it is an effort to
exume a kind of movie that I'd
thought was dead and gone. It
doesn't just stick old lines into
new faces and play off its in

is a thoughtful reintroduction

Saturday Night Fever -kit-kit
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're think
ing. You're thinking that be
cause John Travolta makes a
fool of himself on television
every week he can't possibly
be any good here, and that
anyone who likes him must be
some kind of groupie who
probably got low SAT scores.
You're thinking that disco is
about as exciting as leprosy
and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision
whatsoever.
You've got a point too, ex
cept that its uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's lousy SAT's. Yet
Saturday Night Fever does
have a fixity about it which at
times is very appealing, and
Travolta is a legitimate star (he
plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The
movie has no nutritional
value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that danc

should punch them in the

The Boys from Brazil it it
Coronet
While I suppose that it is
quite possible to respect The
Boys from Brazil for being a
professionally crafted thriller,
I never found myself liking it.
Boys gets it done, but in a very
cold way. The worst dam
pener is that you never really
get close enough to get in
volved —the movie keeps its
distance.
However, the two stars,
Gregory Peck and Laurence
Olivier, give engaging per
formances. And at certain
moments, such as when
either of them do something
that is just right, you begin to
get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the
film that it begins to unnerve
you.
The movie needs the reck
less energy — the sense of
urgency — that the best thril
lers have, and which young
directors like Brian De Pal ma
and Steven Spielberg infuse
into their movies. I emphasize
young because it is a central
issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap

The Big Fix iritit
Old Mill
Now that it's almost the end

of the 70s, moviemakers are
exploring what the '60s gen
eration is currently up to.
Among the new releases deal
ing with this is Jeremy Paul
Kagan's The Big Fix.
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced
father and ex-Berkeley ac
tivist. A former fellow student
and lover (Susan Anspach)
reappears and draws the now
cynical Wine back into the
world of moral and political
ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently ac
quired cynicism. If you're not
interested in a provocative
and sadly humorous film, The
Big Fix is also a superb sus
pense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a
gubernatorial campaign.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self
conscious and loses its integ
ration. However, Dreyfuss
and his supporting cast give
thoughtful and subtle per
formances even when the
script fails them

This omnibus is made up of

Richard Burton really rips
into the role of Martin Dysart,
a psychiatrist who finds him
self unable to cope with a par
ticular boy's act of passion —
the blinding of six horses.
Sidney Lumet, the director,
fails to successfully transfer
this stylized play to the sc

the blinding of the horses,
using the bloodiness of the
act as a substitute for real ef

Lumet lets his actors go,

Peter Firth as the troubled

Equus is a disappointment.

Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies
in its own charm and cute
ness. The director and star,
Jack Nicholson, has admitted
that he wanted Coin' South to
be a romantic fantasy like
those of Preston Sturges and
Ernst Lubitsch.And even
though Nicholson and his
movie often are working un
erringly in this form, it ap
pears that they are holding
themselves back to get there.
Coin' South's restraint asnd
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of
acting moves which simply

never appear here, and the
movie is so concerned with
being pleasant that it kills all
of the material's possible ex
citement.
Nicholson plays a lovable
rogue in the Old West, and as
the movie drifted along to its
inevitable happy ending, all I
could think about was why.
Why is Nicholson playing it
safe? Why does he now want
to be cute?

Interiors
Park
Woody Allen d serves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors
is sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising
is that it is not more so, since
this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi
ence.
But when Interiors works,

and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen
Stapleton, Diane Keaton and
Marybeth Hurl are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble
are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

though some of its chemistry

Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies
in its own charm and cute
ness. The director and star,
Jack Nicholson, has admitted
that he wanted Coin' South to
be a romantic fantasy like
those of Preston Sturges and
Ernst Lubitsch.And even
though Nicholson and his
movie often are working un
erringly in this form, it ap
pears that they are holding
themselves back to get there.
Coin' South's restraint asnd
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of
acting moves which simply

never appear here, and the
movie is so concerned with
being pleasant that it kills all
of the material's possible ex
citement.
Nicholson plays a lovable
rogue in the Old West, and as
the movie drifted along to its
inevitable happy ending, all I
could think about was why.
Why is Nicholson playing it

Interiors

Woody Allen d serves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family

is sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising

this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi

But when Interiors works,

and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen

Marybeth Hurl are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble

While I don't think that In

And it does, for the most

Saturday Night Fever -kit-kit

I know what you're think

cause John Travolta makes a
fool of himself on television
every week he can't possibly
be any good here, and that
anyone who likes him must be
some kind of groupie who
probably got low SAT scores.
You're thinking that disco is
about as exciting as leprosy
and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision
whatsoever.
You've got a point too, ex

around talking about other
people's lousy SAT's. Yet
Saturday Night Fever does
have a fixity about it which at
times is very appealing, and
Travolta is a legitimate star (he
plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The
movie has no nutritional
value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its

The Boys from Brazil it it
Coronet
While I suppose that it is
quite possible to respect The
Boys from Brazil for being a
professionally crafted thriller,
I never found myself liking it.
Boys gets it done, but in a very
cold way. The worst dam
pener is that you never really
get close enough to get in
volved —the movie keeps its
distance.
However, the two stars,
Gregory Peck and Laurence
Olivier, give engaging per
formances. And at certain
moments, such as when
either of them do something
that is just right, you begin to
get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the
film that it begins to unnerve
you.
The movie needs the reck
less energy — the sense of
urgency — that the best thril
lers have, and which young
directors like Brian De Pal ma
and Steven Spielberg infuse
into their movies. I emphasize
young because it is a central
issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap

The Big Fix iritit
Old Mill
Now that it's almost the end

of the 70s, moviemakers are
exploring what the '60s gen
eration is currently up to.
Among the new releases deal
ing with this is Jeremy Paul
Kagan's The Big Fix.
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced
father and ex-Berkeley ac
tivist. A former fellow student
and lover (Susan Anspach)
reappears and draws the now
cynical Wine back into the
world of moral and political
ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently ac
quired cynicism. If you're not
interested in a provocative
and sadly humorous film, The
Big Fix is also a superb sus
pense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a
gubernatorial campaign.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self
conscious and loses its integ
ration. However, Dreyfuss
and his supporting cast give
thoughtful and subtle per
formances even when the
script fails them

This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two

quality from pointless to

least two sketches which by
themselves make this movie
worth seeing: one is a truly
moving portrait of how an old
woman is too proud to object
when her callous son takes
her to a nursing home without
informing her first; the other
is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is
broken up when his straight
man recounts his jokes in the
eulogy. An uneven film re

The Big Fix iritit
Old Mill
Now that it's almost the end

of the 70s, moviemakers are
exploring what the '60s gen
eration is currently up to.
Among the new releases deal
ing with this is Jeremy Paul
Kagan's The Big Fix.
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced
father and ex-Berkeley ac
tivist. A former fellow student
and lover (Susan Anspach)
reappears and draws the now
cynical Wine back into the
world of moral and political
ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently ac
quired cynicism. If you're not
interested in a provocative
and sadly humorous film, The
Big Fix is also a superb sus
pense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a
gubernatorial campaign.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self
conscious and loses its integ
ration. However, Dreyfuss
and his supporting cast give
thoughtful and subtle per
formances even when the
script fails them

Viva Italia! ★★★
Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two
to over 20 and which range in
quality from pointless to
nearly perfect. There are at
least two sketches which by
themselves make this movie
worth seeing: one is a truly
moving portrait of how an old
woman is too proud to object
when her callous son takes
her to a nursing home without
informing her first; the other
is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is
broken up when his straight
man recounts his jokes in the
eulogy. An uneven film re
deemed by its quirky, wry wit.

Richard Burton really rips
into the role of Martin Dysart,
a psychiatrist who finds him
self unable to cope with a par
ticular boy's act of passion —
the blinding of six horses.
Sidney Lumet, the director,
fails to successfully transfer
this stylized play to the sc
reen. His decision to literalize
the blinding of the horses,
using the bloodiness of the
act as a substitute for real ef
fectiveness, shows particu
larly poor judgment.
Lumet lets his actors go,
achieving spectacular results
with Burton and getting solid
performances from both
Peter Firth as the troubled
child and JennyAgutteras the

passion. But, on balance,
Equus is a disappointment.

Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies
in its own charm and cute

Jack Nicholson, has admitted
that he wanted Coin' South to
be a romantic fantasy like
those of Preston Sturges and
Ernst Lubitsch.And even
though Nicholson and his
movie often are working un
erringly in this form, it ap
pears that they are holding
themselves back to get there.
Coin' South's restraint asnd
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of
acting moves which simply

never appear here, and the
movie is so concerned with
being pleasant that it kills all
of the material's possible ex
citement.
Nicholson plays a lovable
rogue in the Old West, and as
the movie drifted along to its
inevitable happy ending, all I
could think about was why.
Why is Nicholson playing it

to be cute?

Interiors

Woody Allen d serves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family

worked out, what is surprising

this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi

But when Interiors works,

and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen
Stapleton, Diane Keaton and
Marybeth Hurl are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble
are fine.
While I don't think that In

there is something great (and,

though some of its chemistry

Heaven Can Wail ★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber
story without the bite. De
pendant for its success upon
machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue —
if the movie is to work it must
continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty, though
big and strong, has more than
a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinate persistance
and a stubborn sense that he's
been cheated. (Strange as it
sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported by
those of a well-addled sup
porting cast.)
It has been noted
everywhere that the picture is
based on a '41 Robert
Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a re
make as it is an effort to
exume a kind of movie that I'd
thought was dead and gone. It
doesn't just stick old lines into
new faces and play off its in
feriority to the original — this
is a thoughtful reintroduction
to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is
currently the norm. Very
good. Never again will I con

I know what you're think

cause John Travolta makes a
fool of himself on television
every week he can't possibly
be any good here, and that
anyone who likes him must be
some kind of groupie who
probably got low SAT scores.
You're thinking that disco is
about as exciting as leprosy
and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision
whatsoever.
You've got a point too, ex
cept that its uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's lousy SAT's. Yet
Saturday Night Fever does
have a fixity about it which at
times is very appealing, and
Travolta is a legitimate star (he
plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The
movie has no nutritional
value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that danc
ing as inherently unimpor
tant, but that's their fault, re
ally. If they scoff at you you
should punch them in the

Heaven Can Wail ★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber
story without the bite. De
pendant for its success upon
machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue —
if the movie is to work it must
continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty, though
big and strong, has more than
a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinate persistance
and a stubborn sense that he's
been cheated. (Strange as it
sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported by
those of a well-addled sup
porting cast.)
It has been noted
everywhere that the picture is
based on a '41 Robert
Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a re
make as it is an effort to
exume a kind of movie that I'd
thought was dead and gone. It
doesn't just stick old lines into
new faces and play off its in
feriority to the original — this
is a thoughtful reintroduction
to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is
currently the norm. Very
good. Never again will I con
fuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.

Dona Flor, a widow who

Saturday Night Fever -kit-kit
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're think
ing. You're thinking that be
cause John Travolta makes a
fool of himself on television
every week he can't possibly
be any good here, and that
anyone who likes him must be
some kind of groupie who
probably got low SAT scores.
You're thinking that disco is
about as exciting as leprosy
and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision
whatsoever.
You've got a point too, ex
cept that its uncharitable to go
around talking about other
people's lousy SAT's. Yet
Saturday Night Fever does
have a fixity about it which at
times is very appealing, and
Travolta is a legitimate star (he
plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost
complex at others). The
movie has no nutritional
value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that danc
ing as inherently unimpor
tant, but that's their fault, re
ally. If they scoff at you you
should punch them in the
nose.

The Boys from Brazil it it
Coronet
While I suppose that it is
quite possible to respect The
Boys from Brazil for being a
professionally crafted thriller,
I never found myself liking it.
Boys gets it done, but in a very
cold way. The worst dam
pener is that you never really
get close enough to get in
volved —the movie keeps its
distance.
However, the two stars,
Gregory Peck and Laurence
Olivier, give engaging per
formances. And at certain
moments, such as when
either of them do something
that is just right, you begin to
get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the
film that it begins to unnerve
you.
The movie needs the reck
less energy — the sense of
urgency — that the best thril
lers have, and which young
directors like Brian De Pal ma
and Steven Spielberg infuse
into their movies. I emphasize
young because it is a central
issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap

The Big Fix iritit
Old Mill
Now that it's almost the end

of the 70s, moviemakers are
exploring what the '60s gen
eration is currently up to.
Among the new releases deal
ing with this is Jeremy Paul
Kagan's The Big Fix.
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced
father and ex-Berkeley ac
tivist. A former fellow student
and lover (Susan Anspach)
reappears and draws the now
cynical Wine back into the
world of moral and political
ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently ac
quired cynicism. If you're not
interested in a provocative
and sadly humorous film, The
Big Fix is also a superb sus
pense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a
gubernatorial campaign.
Occasionally this ambitious
movie becomes self
conscious and loses its integ
ration. However, Dreyfuss
and his supporting cast give
thoughtful and subtle per
formances even when the
script fails them

Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two
to over 20 and which range in
quality from pointless to
nearly perfect. There are at
least two sketches which by
themselves make this movie
worth seeing: one is a truly
moving portrait of how an old
woman is too proud to object
when her callous son takes
her to a nursing home without
informing her first; the other
is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is
broken up when his straight
man recounts his jokes in the
eulogy. An uneven film re

Sunday — Mem Aud
Richard Burton really rips
into the role of Martin Dysart,
a psychiatrist who finds him
self unable to cope with a par
ticular boy's act of passion —
the blinding of six horses.
Sidney Lumet, the director,
fails to successfully transfer
this stylized play to the sc
reen. His decision to literalize
the blinding of the horses,
using the bloodiness of the
act as a substitute for real ef
fectiveness, shows particu
larly poor judgment.
Lumet lets his actors go,
achieving spectacular results
with Burton and getting solid
performances from both
Peter Firth as the troubled

Equus is a disappointment.

though Nicholson and his
movie often are working un
erringly in this form, it ap

Coin' South's restraint asnd
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of
acting moves which simply

never appear here, and the
movie is so concerned with
being pleasant that it kills all
of the material's possible ex
citement.
Nicholson plays a lovable
rogue in the Old West, and as
the movie drifted along to its
inevitable happy ending, all I
could think about was why.

Interiors
Park
Woody Allen d serves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors
is sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising
is that it is not more so, since
this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi
ence.
But when Interiors works,

and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen
Stapleton, Diane Keaton and
Marybeth Hurl are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble
are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Palo Alto Square
It would have been reallv
easy to dismiss this movie as
just pure fluff handled in a

the damn thing, and I won't
deny it. Chefs is a great
throwaway movie, and even
though some of its chemistry
never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset
pairing especially), the movie
works on a semi-classy 'what
the hell' level. Robert Morley
overacts sozealousy that you
begin to enjoy it.

Peter Ustinov plays Hercule

Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put
their 14 million dollars to a dif
ferent use. Or, better yet,
maybe they should keep mak
ing these safe, inoffensive
and generally well made en

unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't
happen though; the board of

flects that security, and in the
worst way. Nicholson needs
to be socially irresponsible;
maybe Go/n' South'* failure
will lead him in thatdirection.

Interiors
Park
Woody Allen d serves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors
is sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising
is that it is not more so, since
this movie is so different from
Allen's previous movie experi
ence.
But when Interiors works,

and it often does, brilliantly; the
performances are the reason
why. Geraldine Page, Maureen
Stapleton, Diane Keaton and
Marybeth Hurl are all excellent
in demanding roles, and the rest
of the nine-member ensemble
are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Who is Killing the
Great Chefs of Europe 112 if if if
Palo Alto Square
It would have been reallv
easy to dismiss this movie as
just pure fluff handled in a
fake style way, but I enjoyed
the damn thing, and I won't
deny it. Chefs is a great
throwaway movie, and even
though some of its chemistry
never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset
pairing especially), the movie
works on a semi-classy 'what
the hell' level. Robert Morley
overacts sozealousy that you
begin to enjoy it.

Death on the Nile if if if
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he
slides into seriousness in time
for the patented Agatha Chris
tie climax. A solid mystery,
nicely photographed, well set
out. But perhaps Gulf and
Western (who own
Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put
their 14 million dollars to a dif
ferent use. Or, better yet,
maybe they should keep mak
ing these safe, inoffensive
and generally well made en
tertainments and use the pro
fits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't
happen though; the board of
directors would never allow
it.

A Wedding if if
Menlo
Writer-director Robert
Altman returns to Nashville's
style but his subject is not
nearly so arresting. While A
Wedding often exhibits quick
flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements ap
pear to have been left in un
finished form, and the charac
terization is particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages
to create a sharply defined
character, and as a consequ
ence, she dominates the movie
in what is a performance of
great emotional range.

Somebody Killed
Her Husband ir
Bijou
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is
married to a man who's idea of a
dinner toast is to mumble "my
first today." Close friend |eff
Bridges is a writer of chil
dren's books who is unpub
lished forall the right reasons.
When the duo find Farrah's
husband stuck to a table with
a knife, they stash the corpse
in the refrigerator for want of
anything better to do. Even
Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this
half-baked non-mystery, and
here the blandness of the
female lead and the ineptness
of director Lamont Johnson
combine to create an enter
tainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.

Heaven Can Wail ★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber
story without the bite. De
pendant for its success upon
machinations of the plot that
come totally out of the blue —
if the movie is to work it must
continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty, though
big and strong, has more than
a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinate persistance
and a stubborn sense that he's
been cheated. (Strange as it
sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported by
those of a well-addled sup
porting cast.)
It has been noted
everywhere that the picture is
based on a '41 Robert
Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a re
make as it is an effort to
exume a kind of movie that I'd
thought was dead and gone. It
doesn't just stick old lines into
new faces and play off its in
feriority to the original — this
is a thoughtful reintroduction
to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is
currently the norm. Very
good. Never again will I con
fuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.

Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands ★★★
Aquarius
Dona Flor, a widow who
marries a dependable but
none too exciting druggist,
manages to get the best of two
worlds when her rakish first
husband comes back from the
dead to return romance to her
life. Dona Flor is a warm, often
very funny import from Brazil.
