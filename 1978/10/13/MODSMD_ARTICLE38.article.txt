Mideast treaty talks begin
Washington — Egypt and Israel began negotia
tions yesterday to draw up a peace treaty that Pres
ident Jimmy Carter said must ultimately be
broadened to include all Arab parties to the Mid
dle East conflict.
A statement issued at the end of the day said
"good progress" was made, both in separate
meetings Secretary of State Cyrus Vance held with
the two delegations and in three-way talks.
The negotiations, which are expected to last for
up to two weeks, resume today.
House passes long-term tax cut
Washington — Over the objections of Democra
tic leaders, the House unexpectedly embraced
yesterday a Republican-backed effort to slash fed
eral income taxes in 1980 and beyond.
By a 268-135 vote, the House told its tax bill
negotiators it favored the long-term tax cut con
cept contained in a Senate proposal sponsored by
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ca.) and supported by Repub
licans.
That plan would expand the 1979 tax cut bill to
include $164.5 billion in additional reductions in
1980 through 1983. The cuts are conditioned on
holding down government spending and balanc
ing the federal budget during that period.
Computer simulation picks pope
Vatican City — The Roman Catholic Church
ended its nine-day mourning period for Pope John
Paul I yesterday while a computer "simulation" of
the forthcoming vote for a new pope showed the
archbishops of Naples and Palermo as the front
runners for the throne of St. Peter.
The computer study, using information ob
tained secondhand, said Cardinals Corrado Ursi of
Naples or Salvatore Pappalardo of Palermo would
most likely be the new leader of the world's 700
million Roman Catholics.
The research was conducted by the National
Opinion Research Center in Chicago under direc
tion of an American priest and sociologist, the Rev.
Andrew Greeley.

Americans share Nobel Prize
Stockholm — Two Americans and a Swiss won
the Nobel Prize for medicine yesterday for their
discovery of a method for breaking apart genetic
material that may eventually unlock some of the
mysteries of cancer and hereditary diseases.
The winners, chosen by the Nobel Committee
of Sweden's Karolinska Institute of Medicine, are
microbiologists Daniel Nathans and Hamilton
Smith of Johns Hopkins University Medical School
in Baltimore, and Werner Arber of the University
of Basel, Switzerland. The three, who will share
the $165,000 award, were chosen from among 205
candidates, sources said.
Filibuster delays energy vote
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's long
stalled energy program was seriously jeopardized
yesterday by sudden parliamentary setbacks.
Congressional leaders were confronted with a
filibuster in the Senate and a vote rejecting — at
least temporarily — a plan for the House to con
sider the energy package in one piece.
In the Senate, Sen. James Abourezk (D-S.D.),
successfully waged a one-man filibuster, forcing
Senate leaders to postpone a key vote on the
energy-tax part of the plan.
There was another obstacle thrown in the path
of the energy plan in the House, where a final vote
had been scheduled for Friday.
The House Rules Committee, which serves as a
traffic cop for legislation headed for the floor,
rejected by an 8-8 tie vote rules under which the
five sections of the energy plan would have been
combined and voted on as one piece.
Times, News strike nears end
New York — The New York Times, the Daily
News and striking pressmen have agreed in prin
ciple on a settlement to the dispute that has idled
the two huge newspapers for nine weeks, labor
lawyer Theodore Kheel said yesterday.
It was not immediately clear how soon a contract
agreement might be reached, or when the two
morning papers could expect to reach settlements

with other striking unions and resume publica
tion.
Kheel said, "I don't anticipate that after a
pressmen's agreement is reached, a resumption of
publication will be long off." However, he
cautioned that a number of matters remained to
be worked out before a full settlement with the
pressmen's union could be announced.
Bayh accused of Korean ties
Washington — The Senate Ethics Committee
wants the Justice Department to decide if Sen.
Birch Bayh (D-lnd.) broke the law by taking cam
paign money in the Capitol from a friend of
Tongsun Park.
The committee says in a report scheduled for
release Monday that it has "substantial credible
evidence'' that Bayh or an aide took $1000 from a
businessman friend of Park in the Capitol on Oct.
8, 1974, despite Bayh's denial.
The report quotes Park as saying that, in addi
tion, he himself gave $1500 to $1800 to the senator,
contrary to Bayh's denial of the allegations. Park, a
South Korean rice dealer, became the center of
the Korean influence buying scandal.
Wall Street sees heavy trading
New York — The stock market's latest rally faded
yesterday as New York's Chase Manhattan Bank
raised its prime lending rate to 10 percent.
Prices posted some scattered losses in the
heaviest trading in three weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had pushed past the 900 level Wednesday with a
9.79-point rise, dropped back 4.68 to 896.74.
New York Stock Exchange reached 30.17 million
shares, up from 21.74 million Wednesday, when
activity was reduced by the observance of the
Jewish holiday Yom Kippur.
