# Hoover library report given chilly response
## 
### ROD STEVENS 
A report, critical of the Hoover In
stitution library, was coolly received
at the Faculty Senate's Sept. 28 meet
ing.
"I have never seen a report get
such a chilly response," said one ob
server.
The report, submitted by a task
force of the Academic Council on Lib
raries, said that the "faculty role in
determining acquisitions is either
weak or non-existent."
"There is no formal role for the
Director of Libraries in establishing
and maintaining standards of libra
rianship at the FHoover Institution.
"There are troublesome tensions
. . . traceable to the divided respon
sibility between faculty and Hoover
personnel," he said.
Criticized report
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebschcriticized the report for using
"ad hominum arguments...unjus
tified by fact.
"The report was aimed at persons,
at human feelings."
Leon Seltzer, convener of the
committee and director of the Stan
ford University Press, refused to
comment on the cold reception
given his committee's report.
George Knoles, another member
of the committee and emeritus pro
fessor of history, also had no com
ment.
Uncommon move
The Faculty Senate voted to re
ceive, but not to accept the report.
Senate Chairman William Chace,
an English professor, noted that re
ception without endorsement by the
senate is "uncommon."
Further action
"The senate felt that before we
take any turther action, the commit
tee should do a more thorough re
port. Historically, there has been
some ambiguity about the relation
ship between the Hoover and the
main library system."
President Richard Lyman said the
Hoover Institution is "largely au
tonomous" under a 1959 Board of
Trustees statement.
"I'm not interested in trying to
carry out some sweeping reorganiza
tion...unless there were a well
documented case, and I don't see a
well-documented case, or even a
germ of one.
"The report lays out the idealized
system of how the libraries should be
organized, were we starting from
scratch, Lyman said. "But we're
not."

"Let's not draw general conclu
sions about the Hoover library's
place in the library structure if par
ticular areas of the collection are not
up to general standard," Clebsch
said.
"The report contained intimations
of isolationism at Hoover," he
added. "The Hoover is not isolated'
but autonomous within the Univer
sity.
"There has been a great manifesta
tion of disturbance at the degree of
autonomy Hoover has. These feel
ings of jealousy and ill will are re
sidual even after the 20 years" since
the Board of Trustees' action.
The library task force was appa
rently formed when faculty members
expressed dissatisfaction over the
collection and curator of the Hoover
library's East European section.
"I would like to have heard more
of the specifics and documentation
behind the report," Chace said.
Lyman said the report contained
no evidence of dissatisfaction with
the East European collections.
The senate ordered a follow-up
study by the Committee on Libraries.

"I have never seen a report get
such a chilly response," said one ob
server.
The report, submitted by a task
force of the Academic Council on Lib
raries, said that the "faculty role in
determining acquisitions is either
weak or non-existent."
"There is no formal role for the
Director of Libraries in establishing
and maintaining standards of libra
rianship at the FHoover Institution.
"There are troublesome tensions
. . . traceable to the divided respon
sibility between faculty and Hoover
personnel," he said.
Criticized report
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebschcriticized the report for using
"ad hominum arguments...unjus
tified by fact.
"The report was aimed at persons,
at human feelings."
Leon Seltzer, convener of the
committee and director of the Stan
ford University Press, refused to
comment on the cold reception
given his committee's report.
George Knoles, another member
of the committee and emeritus pro
fessor of history, also had no com
ment.
Uncommon move
The Faculty Senate voted to re
ceive, but not to accept the report.
Senate Chairman William Chace,
an English professor, noted that re
ception without endorsement by the
senate is "uncommon."
Further action
"The senate felt that before we
take any turther action, the commit
tee should do a more thorough re
port. Historically, there has been
some ambiguity about the relation
ship between the Hoover and the
main library system."
President Richard Lyman said the
Hoover Institution is "largely au
tonomous" under a 1959 Board of
Trustees statement.
"I'm not interested in trying to
carry out some sweeping reorganiza
tion...unless there were a well
documented case, and I don't see a
well-documented case, or even a
germ of one.
"The report lays out the idealized
system of how the libraries should be
organized, were we starting from
scratch, Lyman said. "But we're
not."

"Let's not draw general conclu
sions about the Hoover library's
place in the library structure if par
ticular areas of the collection are not
up to general standard," Clebsch
said.
"The report contained intimations
of isolationism at Hoover," he
added. "The Hoover is not isolated'
but autonomous within the Univer
sity.
"There has been a great manifesta
tion of disturbance at the degree of
autonomy Hoover has. These feel
ings of jealousy and ill will are re
sidual even after the 20 years" since
the Board of Trustees' action.
The library task force was appa
rently formed when faculty members
expressed dissatisfaction over the
collection and curator of the Hoover
library's East European section.
"I would like to have heard more
of the specifics and documentation
behind the report," Chace said.
Lyman said the report contained
no evidence of dissatisfaction with
the East European collections.
The senate ordered a follow-up
study by the Committee on Libraries.
A report, critical of the Hoover In
