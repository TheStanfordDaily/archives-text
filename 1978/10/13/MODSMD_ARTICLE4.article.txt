## 
### TONY RUPERT 
The debate over Proposition 6 ar
rived here last night in a Cubberley
Auditorium forum, sponsored by the
Women's Center and SWOPSI.
The initiative, written by state Sen.
John Briggs (R-Fullerton) would
allow school boards to dismiss
teachers for advocating or encourag
ing homosexual activity.
"What do attitudes like these really
do to families?" asked Kent Olson,
one of four panelists from the San
lose Chapter of Californians Against
the Briggs' Initiative (CABI).
"I'm a brother. I'm a son. I'm a
nephew. I'm not anti-family," he
said.
Olson told the audience CABI is a
state-wide organization, which de
pends on grassroot support. The
bulk of its funds come from sale of
"No on 6" buttons, while its cam
paign centers on door-to-door con

tact.
Another CABI panelist, Johnie
Staggs, is running for mayor of San
Jose, hoping to bring attention to the
issue. "I may get my own vote, but at
least I'll get my views out," she said.
"What if a European teacher, who
is used to greeting a friend of the
same sex with a hug and a kiss, meets
a colleague on the streets?" asked
CABI's Pat McAtee.
"He can be accused of homosex
ual conduct."
McAtee added that a teacher, who
thinks homosexuals have a right to
their lifestyle, won't be able to say so
in class. "If we take away a right to
free speech from one group, we take
away something from all of us," he
said.
CABI member Rosalie Nichols
sought audience support for the
anti-Briggs fight. "One month ago,
the polls showed that 61 percent of
the people favored this initiative and
only 31 percent opposed it," she
said.
"This month, only 45 percent favor
it and 4i percent opposed it."
Court refusal
Nichols said she felt it was essential
to defeat the initiative in November,
because the U.S. Supreme Court has
repeatedly refused to hear gay rights
cases.
Nichols said the major thrust ot
Briggs' campaign has been based on
child abuse by homosexuals.
"But 95 percent of the child abuse
is committed by heterosexual
males," she said.
According to Nichols, Briggs now
admits this fact and has focused the
debate on, "Is gay okay in the clas
sroom?"
However, she added, "His law
prohibits homosexual conduct by
teachers anywhere, which is likely to
come to the attention of the child."
The CABI members encouraged
those interested in the issue to watch
a televised forum Saturday night on
Livewire, which will include Briggs
and one of their members.

"What if a European teacher, who
is used to greeting a friend of the
same sex with a hug and a kiss, meets
a colleague on the streets?" asked
CABI's Pat McAtee.
"He can be accused of homosex
ual conduct."
McAtee added that a teacher, who
thinks homosexuals have a right to
their lifestyle, won't be able to say so
in class. "If we take away a right to
free speech from one group, we take
away something from all of us," he
said.
CABI member Rosalie Nichols
sought audience support for the
anti-Briggs fight. "One month ago,
the polls showed that 61 percent of
the people favored this initiative and
only 31 percent opposed it," she
said.
"This month, only 45 percent favor
it and 4i percent opposed it."
Court refusal
Nichols said she felt it was essential
to defeat the initiative in November,
because the U.S. Supreme Court has
repeatedly refused to hear gay rights
cases.
Nichols said the major thrust ot
Briggs' campaign has been based on
child abuse by homosexuals.
"But 95 percent of the child abuse
is committed by heterosexual
males," she said.
According to Nichols, Briggs now
admits this fact and has focused the
debate on, "Is gay okay in the clas
sroom?"
However, she added, "His law
prohibits homosexual conduct by
teachers anywhere, which is likely to
come to the attention of the child."
The CABI members encouraged
those interested in the issue to watch
a televised forum Saturday night on
Livewire, which will include Briggs
and one of their members.
The debate over Proposition 6 ar
rived here last night in a Cubberley
Auditorium forum, sponsored by the
Women's Center and SWOPSI.
The initiative, written by state Sen.
John Briggs (R-Fullerton) would
allow school boards to dismiss
teachers for advocating or encourag
ing homosexual activity.
"What do attitudes like these really
do to families?" asked Kent Olson,
one of four panelists from the San
lose Chapter of Californians Against
the Briggs' Initiative (CABI).
"I'm a brother. I'm a son. I'm a
nephew. I'm not anti-family," he
said.
Olson told the audience CABI is a
state-wide organization, which de
pends on grassroot support. The
bulk of its funds come from sale of
"No on 6" buttons, while its cam
paign centers on door-to-door con

tact.
Another CABI panelist, Johnie
Staggs, is running for mayor of San
Jose, hoping to bring attention to the
issue. "I may get my own vote, but at
least I'll get my views out," she said.
