# Band welcomes new A.D. in typical form
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The press had just completed
questioning Andy Ceiger at a
luncheon in the City Wednesday,
when a familiar drum roll
heralded the arrival of the
LSJUMB and the opening bars to
"Come Joirrthe Band."
The musical miscreants
marched in off Union Street, filed
past the Victoria Station bar and
into the meeting room being used
for the luncheon. Horns blared all
the while. Following the Band's
brassy rendition of Santana's
"Everybody's Everything," Drum
Major Dave Ford signaled for the
Band's attention.
Ford: "Say Band, let's say hello
to Andy Ceiger."
Band: "Hello, Andy Geiger."
Ford: "What do you think of
Andy Geiger?"
Band: "Soooooome shit."
The Band's overstated exuber
ance for Geiger was matched by
the more subdued enthusiasm,
with which President Richard
Lyman spoke of Geiger, while in
troducing the man who will suc
ceed Joe Ruetz as Stanford's athle
tic director Jan. 1.

"Andy Geiger was recom
mended to me before we even
had the search underway and I
held back in the hope that the
search committee would discover
him. They discovered him early,
stuck with him, worked on him,
the rest of us worked on him, and
we have been successful."
Who is this man who withdrew
himself from competition for the
job two weeks ago, only to have
Lyman offer him the job last
Saturday?
Geiger, for the last three years
and four months, has been the
athletic director at the University
of Pennsylvania. He has been a
leader in the NCAA, an innovative
administrator and a focus of tur
moil.
NCAA tourney
Geiger is chairman of the
NCAA's Government Relations
Committee. A member of its six
person Division I Basketball
Tournament Committee, he
pushed through expansion of the
NCAA tournament to 40 teams
and secured the Ivy League a
guaranteed spot.
Geiger earned a national repu

tation last year at the NCAA con
vention, where he was instrumen
tal in stopping the drive for a
"super conference" of football
powers, schools which wanted
fewer restrictions and more tele
vision revenue.
Geiger engineered the so
called Ivy Amendment, which
exempts a school, with varsity
teams competing in 12 sports in
which the NCAA has champion
ships, from other requirements,
which "super conference" prop
onents supported. The amend
ment passed, 73-70, after a sec
onding speech from Lyman.
A politican with clout, Geiger
described himself as a "student
oriented administrator.
"The bottom line of an athletic
program is what is the value and
quality of the experience for the
student," Geiger said. "If we're
creating programs where athletes
can achieve their potential and do
the best they possibly can, then I
think that's the basic criterion for
success."
Budget woes
In times of inflation and budget
constraints, program creativity is

not always possible. In fact, some
programs may have to be aban
doned.
Under pressure from top Penn
administrators to reduce the de
ficit in the athletic budget last
year, Geiger dropped the varsity
ice hockey program and several
other sports. The program cuts,
concurrent with a tuition hike,
sparked a student sit-in in Penn's
administration buildings.
"I went to the sit-in and stood
on a chair for about an hour and a
half and answered questions and
talked with the students," Geiger
said. He was the first Penn official
to speak with students, some of
whom wielded razor blades.
"More was at stake than drop
ping our hockey program,"
Geiger said. "There were other
types of cuts announced at the
same time — a theater program,
men's and women's gymnastics,
Softball and golf. It was a $150,000
cut."
Bigger program
The financial problems he will
face at Stanford will be somewhat
different. At Penn, there were no
athletic grants-in-aid. There was

no big-time football.
Stanford awards nearly $1 mill
ion in athletic scholarships during
a year.
The Cardinal football program
produces nearly $2 million in re
venue annually, compared with
Penn's $75,000.
"If you think your programs are
sound, then you can sell yourself
to alumni and friends of the Uni
versity and become a very good
fund raiser," said Ceiger, who
raised funds for athletic facilities
at Penn. "You should work to
have programs which sell them
selves."
A 1961 graduate of Syracuse,
Ceiger worked six years as assis
tant athletic director at his alma
rnater, one year as assistant com
missioner of the ECAC, and four
years as athletic director at Brown,
before his stint at Penn.
What sparked his interest in col
legiate athletics?
"I was a very poor high school
basketball player, who bumped
his head on an oar going through
the door to register for classes my
freshman year," Ceiger said. "A


Andy Geiger
hand came out and a voice said,
Do you know where the boath
ouse is?' That's how I got involved
in college athletics."
In addition to his NCAA respon
sibilities, Geiger recently was
named to the U.S. Olympic
Committee's Budget and Audit
Committee.
Called "the backbone of the
women's program" at Penn,
Geiger said, "Title IX is an embar

rassment. We should have been
doing these things a long time
ago."
Many of the people on the Stan
ford search committee said that
Geiger's widespread interests
were an important influence in
the decision to hire him.
"Stanford University presents
the most unique challenge that is
available in athletics," Geiger
said. "I'm looking forward to a
long tenure at Stanford."

exempts a school, with varsity
teams competing in 12 sports in
which the NCAA has champion

A politican with clout, Geiger
described himself as a "student

Budget woes
In times of inflation and budget
constraints, program creativity is

not always possible. In fact, some
programs may have to be aban
doned.
Under pressure from top Penn
administrators to reduce the de
ficit in the athletic budget last
year, Geiger dropped the varsity
ice hockey program and several
other sports. The program cuts,
concurrent with a tuition hike,
sparked a student sit-in in Penn's
administration buildings.
"I went to the sit-in and stood
on a chair for about an hour and a
half and answered questions and
talked with the students," Geiger
said. He was the first Penn official
to speak with students, some of
whom wielded razor blades.
"More was at stake than drop
ping our hockey program,"
Geiger said. "There were other
types of cuts announced at the
same time — a theater program,
men's and women's gymnastics,
Softball and golf. It was a $150,000
cut."
Bigger program
The financial problems he will
face at Stanford will be somewhat
different. At Penn, there were no
athletic grants-in-aid. There was

no big-time football.
Stanford awards nearly $1 mill
ion in athletic scholarships during
a year.
The Cardinal football program
produces nearly $2 million in re
venue annually, compared with
Penn's $75,000.
"If you think your programs are
sound, then you can sell yourself
to alumni and friends of the Uni
versity and become a very good
fund raiser," said Ceiger, who
raised funds for athletic facilities
at Penn. "You should work to
have programs which sell them
selves."
A 1961 graduate of Syracuse,
Ceiger worked six years as assis
tant athletic director at his alma
rnater, one year as assistant com
missioner of the ECAC, and four
years as athletic director at Brown,
before his stint at Penn.
What sparked his interest in col
legiate athletics?
"I was a very poor high school
basketball player, who bumped
his head on an oar going through
the door to register for classes my
freshman year," Ceiger said. "A


Andy Geiger
hand came out and a voice said,
Do you know where the boath
ouse is?' That's how I got involved
in college athletics."
In addition to his NCAA respon
sibilities, Geiger recently was
named to the U.S. Olympic
Committee's Budget and Audit
Committee.
Called "the backbone of the
women's program" at Penn,
Geiger said, "Title IX is an embar

rassment. We should have been
doing these things a long time
ago."
Many of the people on the Stan
ford search committee said that
Geiger's widespread interests
were an important influence in
the decision to hire him.
"Stanford University presents
the most unique challenge that is
available in athletics," Geiger
said. "I'm looking forward to a
long tenure at Stanford."
The press had just completed
questioning Andy Ceiger at a
luncheon in the City Wednesday,
when a familiar drum roll
heralded the arrival of the
LSJUMB and the opening bars to
"Come Joirrthe Band."
The musical miscreants
marched in off Union Street, filed
past the Victoria Station bar and
into the meeting room being used
for the luncheon. Horns blared all
the while. Following the Band's
brassy rendition of Santana's
"Everybody's Everything," Drum
Major Dave Ford signaled for the
Band's attention.
Ford: "Say Band, let's say hello
to Andy Ceiger."
Band: "Hello, Andy Geiger."
Ford: "What do you think of
Andy Geiger?"
Band: "Soooooome shit."
The Band's overstated exuber
ance for Geiger was matched by
the more subdued enthusiasm,
with which President Richard
Lyman spoke of Geiger, while in
troducing the man who will suc
ceed Joe Ruetz as Stanford's athle
tic director Jan. 1.

"Andy Geiger was recom

had the search underway and I
held back in the hope that the

him. They discovered him early,
stuck with him, worked on him,
the rest of us worked on him, and

have programs which sell them
selves."
A 1961 graduate of Syracuse,
Ceiger worked six years as assis
tant athletic director at his alma
rnater, one year as assistant com
missioner of the ECAC, and four
years as athletic director at Brown,
before his stint at Penn.
What sparked his interest in col
legiate athletics?
"I was a very poor high school
basketball player, who bumped
his head on an oar going through
the door to register for classes my
freshman year," Ceiger said. "A


Andy Geiger
hand came out and a voice said,
Do you know where the boath
ouse is?' That's how I got involved
in college athletics."
In addition to his NCAA respon
sibilities, Geiger recently was
named to the U.S. Olympic
Committee's Budget and Audit
Committee.
Called "the backbone of the
women's program" at Penn,
Geiger said, "Title IX is an embar

rassment. We should have been
doing these things a long time
ago."
Many of the people on the Stan
ford search committee said that
Geiger's widespread interests
were an important influence in
the decision to hire him.
"Stanford University presents
the most unique challenge that is
available in athletics," Geiger
said. "I'm looking forward to a
long tenure at Stanford."
The press had just completed
questioning Andy Ceiger at a
luncheon in the City Wednesday,
when a familiar drum roll
heralded the arrival of the
LSJUMB and the opening bars to
"Come Joirrthe Band."
The musical miscreants
marched in off Union Street, filed
past the Victoria Station bar and
into the meeting room being used
for the luncheon. Horns blared all
the while. Following the Band's
brassy rendition of Santana's
"Everybody's Everything," Drum
Major Dave Ford signaled for the
Band's attention.
Ford: "Say Band, let's say hello
to Andy Ceiger."
Band: "Hello, Andy Geiger."
Ford: "What do you think of
Andy Geiger?"
Band: "Soooooome shit."
The Band's overstated exuber
ance for Geiger was matched by
the more subdued enthusiasm,
with which President Richard
Lyman spoke of Geiger, while in
troducing the man who will suc
ceed Joe Ruetz as Stanford's athle
tic director Jan. 1.

"Andy Geiger was recom
mended to me before we even
had the search underway and I
held back in the hope that the
search committee would discover
him. They discovered him early,
stuck with him, worked on him,
the rest of us worked on him, and
we have been successful."
Who is this man who withdrew
himself from competition for the
job two weeks ago, only to have
Lyman offer him the job last
Saturday?
Geiger, for the last three years
and four months, has been the
athletic director at the University
of Pennsylvania. He has been a
leader in the NCAA, an innovative
administrator and a focus of tur
moil.
NCAA tourney
Geiger is chairman of the
NCAA's Government Relations
Committee. A member of its six
person Division I Basketball
Tournament Committee, he
pushed through expansion of the
NCAA tournament to 40 teams
and secured the Ivy League a
guaranteed spot.
Geiger earned a national repu

tation last year at the NCAA con
vention, where he was instrumen
tal in stopping the drive for a
"super conference" of football
powers, schools which wanted
fewer restrictions and more tele
vision revenue.
Geiger engineered the so
called Ivy Amendment, which
exempts a school, with varsity
teams competing in 12 sports in
which the NCAA has champion
ships, from other requirements,
which "super conference" prop
onents supported. The amend
ment passed, 73-70, after a sec
onding speech from Lyman.
A politican with clout, Geiger
described himself as a "student
oriented administrator.
"The bottom line of an athletic
program is what is the value and
quality of the experience for the
student," Geiger said. "If we're
creating programs where athletes
can achieve their potential and do
the best they possibly can, then I
think that's the basic criterion for
success."
Budget woes
In times of inflation and budget
constraints, program creativity is

not always possible. In fact, some
programs may have to be aban
doned.
Under pressure from top Penn
administrators to reduce the de
ficit in the athletic budget last
year, Geiger dropped the varsity
ice hockey program and several
other sports. The program cuts,
concurrent with a tuition hike,
sparked a student sit-in in Penn's
administration buildings.
"I went to the sit-in and stood
on a chair for about an hour and a
half and answered questions and
talked with the students," Geiger
said. He was the first Penn official
to speak with students, some of
whom wielded razor blades.
"More was at stake than drop
ping our hockey program,"
Geiger said. "There were other
types of cuts announced at the
same time — a theater program,
men's and women's gymnastics,
Softball and golf. It was a $150,000
cut."
Bigger program
The financial problems he will
face at Stanford will be somewhat
different. At Penn, there were no
athletic grants-in-aid. There was

no big-time football.
Stanford awards nearly $1 mill
ion in athletic scholarships during
a year.
The Cardinal football program
produces nearly $2 million in re
venue annually, compared with
Penn's $75,000.
"If you think your programs are
sound, then you can sell yourself
to alumni and friends of the Uni
versity and become a very good
fund raiser," said Ceiger, who
raised funds for athletic facilities
at Penn. "You should work to
have programs which sell them
selves."
A 1961 graduate of Syracuse,
Ceiger worked six years as assis
tant athletic director at his alma
