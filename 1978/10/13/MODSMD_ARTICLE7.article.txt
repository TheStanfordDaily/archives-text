## Mourning period for pope ends 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — The official mourn
ing period for Pope John Paul I ended yes
terday as preparations for the election of
his successor neared completion.
"Mourning time is over Thursday. The
diocese of Rome, in communion with the
whole Catholic Church, turns joyfully to
waiting for its new bishop and pastor,"
Cardinal Ugo Poletti, the papal vicar for
Rome, said.
Poletti ordered daily prayers for the car
dinal electors and for the man who is to
become the 264 th pope "so that Cod,
overcoming human weakness, may give
him confidence and strength."
Preparations complete
The Vatican Radio reported that work
men had virtually completed preparations
for the lock-up area where the cardinals
will retreat in seclusion Saturday evening.
Voting begins Sunday.

A total of 112 bedrooms were prepared,
ranging from spacious frescoed sections
of the Varican museums to narrow and
barren rooms in the attic of the Apostolic
Palace.
There are 112 cardinals eligible to vote in
the conclave, but Boleslaw Filipiak of Po
land announced that he was still confined
to the hospital and could not attend. Ill
ness also kept him away from the conclave
that elected John Paul on Aug. 26.
Another ailing absentee from the Au
gust conclave, Cardinal John J. Wright of
the United States, is present for this one.
Services improved
After hearing a report at their daily meet
ing Wednesday, the cardinals issued a
statement saying that "services had been
noticeably improved in order to make the
stay of the cardinals in the conclave less
uncomfortable." No specifics were given.

The cardinals rejected a request from
the press corps to inform the press room
by telephone when the new pope is
elected rather than leaving the journalists
dependent on the often-confusing smoke
signals from the stove in which the ballots
are burned.
Black or white?
But the Vatican Radio said action was
taken to make sure that the color of the
first smoke out of the stack atop the Sistine
Chapel would be definitely black, for no
decision, or white, for a new pope. The
broadcast report said only army flares of
the desired color would be burned for the
first minute of each incineration, and then
the ballots would be added to the fire.
When John Paul was elected, the smoke
turned from white to gray to black to gray,
leaving the world in doubt for4o minutes.

ing Wednesday, the cardinals issued a
statement saying that "services had been
noticeably improved in order to make the
stay of the cardinals in the conclave less
uncomfortable." No specifics were given.

The cardinals rejected a request from
the press corps to inform the press room
by telephone when the new pope is
elected rather than leaving the journalists
dependent on the often-confusing smoke
signals from the stove in which the ballots
are burned.
Black or white?
But the Vatican Radio said action was
taken to make sure that the color of the
first smoke out of the stack atop the Sistine
Chapel would be definitely black, for no
decision, or white, for a new pope. The
broadcast report said only army flares of
the desired color would be burned for the
first minute of each incineration, and then
the ballots would be added to the fire.
When John Paul was elected, the smoke
turned from white to gray to black to gray,
leaving the world in doubt for4o minutes.
