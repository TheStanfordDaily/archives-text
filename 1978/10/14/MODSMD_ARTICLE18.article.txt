# Plethora of problems plague pro players
## 
### Bob Rudy 
Darryl Stingley remains
paralyzed in a Castro Valley
hospital. The New England Pat
riot wide receiver, in a game
August 12 with the Oakland
Raiders, sustained a debilitat
ing injury that ended his
career.

Dr. Arnold Mandel, profes
sor of psychiatry at the Univer
sity of California, San Diego,
spent a year observing the San
Diego Chargers gathering evi
dence to support an earlier
statement of his: "Drug agony
rages, silently as a plague,
through the body of football."

Both Ken Stabler and Dave
Casper admitted they fumbled
on purpose on the last play of
their game with the San Diego
Chargers on September 24. It is
against National Football
League rules to fumble inten
tionally, but because the re
ferees had previously made a
"judgement" call allowing the
play, the Raiders won 21-20.

Injuries, drugs, officiating.
Probably the three most impor
tant issues facing the NFL at
this time. Says who? If the daily
ramblings of sports columnists
are criteria, or if letters to the
editor from fans count, then
there are lots of people who
say so.
Not the NFL, though. At their
most recent meeting earlier
this month in Chicago, the NFL
owners spent almost eight
hours in discussions. And what
was their main topic of con
cern? What to do about the
sexy cheerleading squads that
many teams now have.
Incredible as it may seem,
they spent the majority of their
time establishing rules and
regulations for the lightly-clad
women. Among the new rules
was the stipulation that all
cheerleaders must sign a con
tractual agreement stating that
they will not appear in the
nude. /
Scrutinizing the situation ac
curately was Glenn Dickey of
the San Francisco Chronicle:
"The hypocrisy of the San
Diego Chargers in disbanding
the Chargettes because one of
the girls posed for Playboy
magazine is astounding. The
NFL is peddling voyeurism but
it is horrified if somebody else
does."
More distressing than their
preoccupation with cheer
leaders is that the NFL owners
once again refused to acknow
ledge and deal with the real
problems facing the sport.
This past August, Sports Il
lustrated magazine ran a
three-part series on brutality in
football. In concluding his arti
cle, John Underwood made
several specific suggestions for
making the game safer. Since
the Stingley tragedy, other
writers have also made it clear
that there are ways that football
could be improved upon, if the

owners wanted.
The almost total disregard
forthe health and protection of
its players shown by the own
ers at their recent meeting is all
too indicative of what they re
ally want.
Considerable publicity has
also been given to the problem
of drugs in football. It even
made the comic pages when a
two-week sequence on a shady
football coach appeared in

"Doonesbury."
According to Dr. Arnold
Mandel, amphetamines may
turn players into monsters on
Sunday and manic-depressives
on Monday. But did the NFL
owners discuss the potential
harm that "uppers" have on
players? Of course they didn't.
It seems that ever since the
controversial fumble call in San
Diego that a week doesn't go
by without some mention of

some blatant mistake by some
official. Certainly, "to err is
human." It is unfair to expect
perfection from -anyone, in
cluding referees. There are
ways, however, that referees
might be aided in their jobs.
Proposals ranging from the use
of television instant replays to a
more flexible grievance proce
dure have been mentioned.
Opting for the status quo,
the NFL owners did not discuss

any possible officiating im
provements at their meeting.
Once again it looks like the
profit motives of the owners
have won out against protec
tion for the players. Far from
being a unique situation, the
recent NFL owners meeting
seems like just so much more
fuel for a train that's going jn
the wrong direction. Who
knows where and when it will
stop.
