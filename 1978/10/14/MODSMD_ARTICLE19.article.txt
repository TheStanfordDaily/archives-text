# Recently published LSJUMB pulls out thorns
## 
### KEN JOHNSON 
Ouch. Sometimes in grasp
ing for roses one comes up
with a handful of thorns. If An
drocles will kindly remove last
week's thorn, we can start our
run again.
As the UWash Band rests up
north in liquid sunshine, we
present some talent from the
Buck Ferris Gone Show, ac
quired during our recent visit
to Smog City.
First the Killjoy Strangerettes

display their wheres (unless
the Plowboy photographer
gets hold of them for a spread).
Next the More Science High
Drum and Bungle Corps enter
tain you with their disappear
ing diamonds, disappearing
jewels, and disappearing lines,
to the toe-tapping strains of
John Cage.
All good thngs end. In a flash
the field is cleared, and out
rushes the Stanford Band. Tail
gating and restaurant supplies

have managed to whipp it into
a performing frenzy.
No need to axe us what our
first formation will be, bound
and gagged in tradition as we
are. r
"Tell Mama" that OUI'S
HERE, providing cheap ($2)
thrills and fascinating bat
hroom reading. Wait till the
movie is out. Or are we part of
one right now? (Anyway Burr
Snider, thanx, we love ya... in a
clean wholesome sense, of

course.)
Finally the good Dr. Arthur P.
Barnes, waves his hands and,
presto, the famous olde €n
glish drinking ode receives its
tender treatment, through ale
ing lips.
A funny thing happened on
the way to this half-time show.
In planning these fiascos, the
LSJUMB tries to tap the pulse of
the student body. Lately, how
ever, that pulse seems missing,
and only UGLY things seem to

hold interest.
But we don't care. Students
don't care. If we cared that they
don't care, we'd probably do a
show about "Apathy."
We asked some students
what they thought about this
plight of contemporary youth,
indifferent towards
issues not dealing with them
selves, jobs, workstudyget
rich. The response we got is
spelled out in our first forma
tion, with an appropriately stir
ring musical selection.
The sometimes lewde band
acknowledges more politically
aware times in their next for
mation — viva le Revolution in
France, that July 14 of two cen
turies ago.
Meanwhile, Elma and Eddie
Embo up in the stands, assum
ing that all circular band forma
tions represent parts of human
anatomy, are upset by the slit
through the middle of this one.
The students, being "White
Punks On Dope," are happy
enough to Roar, er, sleep. And
the Band doesn't care if you
think this formation is so por.
(We can't spell since we skip
ped our classes in bonehead
English.)
On campus, political anar
chy is the goal, as the student
SENATE is flushed away as a
piece of C.R.A.P.
Be awary, though, in our SE
DATEd world. "Don't Stop
Thinking About Tomorrow"
'cause 1984's a-knocking at
your door.
As eyes see it, apathy is an
open-and-shut-and open case.
'Tell Her She's Lovely" when
she's asleep, and perhaps
she'll stay that way. But even
tually she will wake up, and
then what?
Well, that's the show. Next
game we'll be back with our
usuall set of hot dogs, bananas,
and Hoover towers on the
field. Keep those cards and let
ters.

The LSJUMB notes the death
of a former member, Larry
Cahn, '53! He loved the Band as
much as we love ourselves,
and we dedicate all of today's
good times to him.

Displaying their usual creative nonsense, members of the incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band cavort across the

playing turf, instilling enthusiasm in the Cardinal crowd during a recent
contest. Kind of look the band from Star Wars, don't they?
