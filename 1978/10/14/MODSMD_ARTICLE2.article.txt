# Rabid pack of Huskies come to Farm
## Both lost heartbreakers last week 
### IVAN MAISEL 
Sportscaster Jim McKay has
told millions of television vie
wers about "the agony of de
feat."
To see "the agony" more
closely, one only needed to
view the defeats of Stanford
and Washington last week.
Washington lost to seventh-
Alabama 20-17, even
"ough they outgained the
Tide in total yards, led at
halftime 10-7, and had driven
to the Alabama 32 with two mi
nutes left, only to fumble the
ball and the game away.
Stanford lost to sixteenth
ranked UCLA 27-26, even
though they outgained the
Bruins in total yards and con
trolled the second half, only to
watch a Peter Boermeester
field goal split the uprights and
their upset hopes in half.
is in the same fix
in," Washington head
coach Don James said. "We
both have to win the rest of our
games to stay in the Pac-10 con
ference ranee."
Both teams have one loss in
the conference standings, with
both losses courtesy of the
Bruins from Westwood.
"We can't let last week's loss
affect the rest of the season,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "It was a tough loss,
particularly because of the
what-ifs. All of the players have
been walking around asking
'what if I had done
Wh,' or 'if I had only' . . . It's
unfair to scrutinize yourself
like that."
Things weren't all bad for the
Cardinals last Saturday night,
though. The passing attack, led
by quarterback Steve Dils, re
mained sharp against UCLA.
Dils picks apart the Bruins' de

fense for 262 yards, completing
21 passes in 35 attempts with
two interceptions. Dils also
leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense, and is responsible for
swallowing up 235 yards of turf
per game.
The list of the conference's
leading receivers reads like
Stanford's roster, with Phil
Francis, Darrin Nelson, and
Kenny Margerum ranking
1-2-3. Francis, who injured his
wrist and ribs last week in Los
Angeles, will play in today's
game.
Halfback Nelson is rushing
for 97 yards per outing good
enough for third in the confer
ence.
That was the sweet; now for
the bitter. There are some as
pects of last week's play that
need to be improved, and
Walsh is the first to admit it.
Take special teams, for in
stance.
"If we did nothing at all, they
would be better," Walsh said.
"The players' sensitivity to
something as stunning as that
will spur them on."
Stunning is a word used
rather loosely in Hollywood
and its environs, but Walsh
does not exaggerate: UCLA
won the game because of their
special teams.
Case in point: UCLA
halfback Theotis Brown ran
back a third-quarter kickoff 93
yards for a touchdown so
cleanly that his uniform didn't
need to be washed after the
game.
Case in point: Stanford
punter Brad Fox averaged only
33.7 yards per kick, though it
was due as much to poor field
position and poor protection
as it was to kicking.

The coaching staff has made
changes, and expects im
provement.
"We have put more front
line people and more experi
ence into the special teams,"
Walsh said, adding that he
"doesn't foresee any more
breakdowns."
The improvement will have
to come of age this week in
order to beat a team labeled by
one observer as "the best 2-3
team in the country."

Coach James is puzzled by
the Huskies' slow start. Maybe
he is confused by a little deja
vu.
Last year Washington lost
three of its firstfour games and
then caught fire. They won six
out of seven, blazed into the
Rose Bowl and beat a badly
outplayed Michigan, 27-20.
Coming into this year, they
were pregnant with optimism.
Three games out of five on the
wrong end of the scoreboard

has aborted that attitude.
"We aren't as confident as
we were in spring drills and in
fall practice. It's hard to pin
point just what has gone
wrong," James said.
The Husky offense, with
junior college transfer Tom
Porras at the helm, has
coughed and sputtered, but
may have found its niche
against Alabama. The 6-foot 1 Vi
inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).
Gaines caught a 26-yarder in
last year's 45-21 victory over
Stanford.
The man to keep an eye on is
number 24, junior tailback Joe
Steele. Steele is big for a tail
back 6-foot 4, 218 lbs., but
hasrf't let his size get in his way.
He is averaging 113.6 yards a
game, despite the fact that
Alabama held him to 52 yards.
The Cards remember him
well. He ran for 177 yards in last
year's victory, including runs
of 83 and seven yards for
touchdowns.
One aspect of Washington's
game which has been disap
pointing has been their punt
ing. That's punting, as in spe
cial teams. "UCLA scored
their only touchdown on a
blocked punt," James said.
"Last week, Alabama tackled
our punter on our sixteen yard
line and scored a touchdown
immediately afterwards."
"The defense," James con
tinued, "has played well
enough to win all five games,"
One look at the statistics,

The Stanford version of the USC "student-body right" sweep at its finest here. Halfback Darrin Nelson (31),
follows a key block by right guard Jim Stephens (63) and grabs several yards. Washington boasts the seventh
ranked defense in the nation, so the yards might not come as easy.
