# Rabid pack of Huskies come to Farm
## Both lost heartbreakers last week 
### IVAN MAISEL 
Sportscaster Jim McKay has
told millions of television vie
wers about "the agony of de
feat."
To see "the agony" more
closely, one only needed to
view the defeats of Stanford
and Washington last week.
Washington lost to seventh-
Alabama 20-17, even
"ough they outgained the
Tide in total yards, led at
halftime 10-7, and had driven
to the Alabama 32 with two mi
nutes left, only to fumble the
ball and the game away.
Stanford lost to sixteenth
ranked UCLA 27-26, even
though they outgained the
Bruins in total yards and con
trolled the second half, only to
watch a Peter Boermeester
field goal split the uprights and
their upset hopes in half.
is in the same fix
in," Washington head
coach Don James said. "We
both have to win the rest of our
games to stay in the Pac-10 con
ference ranee."
Both teams have one loss in
the conference standings, with
both losses courtesy of the
Bruins from Westwood.
"We can't let last week's loss
affect the rest of the season,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "It was a tough loss,
particularly because of the
what-ifs. All of the players have
been walking around asking
'what if I had done
Wh,' or 'if I had only' . . . It's
unfair to scrutinize yourself
like that."
Things weren't all bad for the
Cardinals last Saturday night,
though. The passing attack, led
by quarterback Steve Dils, re
mained sharp against UCLA.
Dils picks apart the Bruins' de

fense for 262 yards, completing
21 passes in 35 attempts with
two interceptions. Dils also
leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense, and is responsible for
swallowing up 235 yards of turf
per game.
The list of the conference's
leading receivers reads like
Stanford's roster, with Phil
Francis, Darrin Nelson, and
Kenny Margerum ranking
1-2-3. Francis, who injured his
wrist and ribs last week in Los
Angeles, will play in today's
game.
Halfback Nelson is rushing
for 97 yards per outing good
enough for third in the confer
ence.
That was the sweet; now for
the bitter. There are some as
pects of last week's play that
need to be improved, and
Walsh is the first to admit it.
Take special teams, for in
stance.
"If we did nothing at all, they
would be better," Walsh said.
"The players' sensitivity to
something as stunning as that
will spur them on."
Stunning is a word used
rather loosely in Hollywood
and its environs, but Walsh
does not exaggerate: UCLA
won the game because of their
special teams.
Case in point: UCLA
halfback Theotis Brown ran
back a third-quarter kickoff 93
yards for a touchdown so
cleanly that his uniform didn't
need to be washed after the
game.
Case in point: Stanford
punter Brad Fox averaged only
33.7 yards per kick, though it
was due as much to poor field
position and poor protection
as it was to kicking.

The coaching staff has made
changes, and expects im
provement.
"We have put more front
line people and more experi
ence into the special teams,"
Walsh said, adding that he
"doesn't foresee any more
breakdowns."
The improvement will have
to come of age this week in
order to beat a team labeled by
one observer as "the best 2-3
team in the country."

Coach James is puzzled by
the Huskies' slow start. Maybe
he is confused by a little deja
vu.
Last year Washington lost
three of its firstfour games and
then caught fire. They won six
out of seven, blazed into the
Rose Bowl and beat a badly
outplayed Michigan, 27-20.
Coming into this year, they
were pregnant with optimism.
Three games out of five on the
wrong end of the scoreboard

has aborted that attitude.
"We aren't as confident as
we were in spring drills and in
fall practice. It's hard to pin
point just what has gone
wrong," James said.
The Husky offense, with
junior college transfer Tom
Porras at the helm, has
coughed and sputtered, but
may have found its niche
against Alabama. The 6-foot 1 Vi
inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).
Gaines caught a 26-yarder in
last year's 45-21 victory over
Stanford.
The man to keep an eye on is
number 24, junior tailback Joe
Steele. Steele is big for a tail
back 6-foot 4, 218 lbs., but
hasrf't let his size get in his way.
He is averaging 113.6 yards a
game, despite the fact that
Alabama held him to 52 yards.
The Cards remember him
well. He ran for 177 yards in last
year's victory, including runs
of 83 and seven yards for
touchdowns.
One aspect of Washington's
game which has been disap
pointing has been their punt
ing. That's punting, as in spe
cial teams. "UCLA scored
their only touchdown on a
blocked punt," James said.
"Last week, Alabama tackled
our punter on our sixteen yard
line and scored a touchdown
immediately afterwards."
"The defense," James con
tinued, "has played well
enough to win all five games,"
One look at the statistics,
and one realizes that it can't be

The Stanford version of the USC "student-body right" sweep at its finest here. Halfback Darrin Nelson (31),

ranked defense in the nation, so the yards might not come as easy.
a defense. It's got to be a stone
wall. The Huskies have only
given up 204.2 yards per game.
Okay, it's not a stone wall
they just put 12 players on the
field. Is that only 39.8 yards per
game given up through the air?
They must give the other team
a deflated ball to throw. Maybe
they poi nt guns at the receivers
and say, "I dare you, "
James dismisses the passing
defense's numbers with a
laugh.
"No one's put the ball up
against us," James said.
"Against UCLA, it was raining,
so they only threw four times.
Indiana absolutely refused to
throw against us and Alabama
only passed nine times."
The other numbers aren't as
easy to dismiss. The fact is that
Washington has one of the
best defenses in the country.
Led by Michael Jackson,
an All-American at outside
linebacker, and cornerback
Nesby Glasgow, the Husky de
fense is a force with which to
be reckoned.
Jackson is a linebacker who
causes mistakes. As a purveyor
of the blitz, the 6-foot-V2, 226-
pound senior has caught the
eye of the Stanford coaching
staff, which UCLA had with the
blitz in the first half.
"We've got <o shore up our
pass protection," Walsh said.
Last week it was done by bring
ing the receivers in close to the
line to block. In addition,
Walsh admitted that Dils will
have to have more time.
"The quarterback will have
to hold the ball longer," Walsh
said.
Don't get the idea that Walsh
is biting his nails over the
Husky secondary.
"Washington having the
best passing defense doesn't
scare us," Walsh said. "We've
been up against top defenses
before and they weren't (tops)
afterwards."
Trying to stop the Cardinals'
passing attack scares James,
however. He doesn't know
what to expect from his secon
dary.
"I have no idea how they will
do," James said. "We haven't
played a team like Stanford.
We've got the experience, but
we haven't been tested."
Exam time is slated for 1:30
p.m. today and both candi
dates have similar
backgrounds. Both have just
lost heartbreakers, both could
easily be 5-0, and both have
been beaten by the little things
like a breakdown in the spe
cial teams. Who will pass the
exam and continue on the red
(like a Rose) brick road to
Pasadena?
"It's not in our best interests to
talk about the Rose Bowl until
they invite us," Walsh said.
"Whether we finish third in the
conference or seventh in the
conference, we can only take
the games one at a time. We're

not the kind of team that can
automatically beat someone."
Maybe they cannot do it au
tomatically, but certainly the
55,000-plus fans expected
would be satisfied with a man
ual victory. As last week so
graphically illustrated to both
Stanford and Washington, the
best team doesn't always win.

a defense. It's got to be a stone
wall. The Huskies have only
given up 204.2 yards per game.
Okay, it's not a stone wall
they just put 12 players on the
field. Is that only 39.8 yards per
game given up through the air?
They must give the other team
a deflated ball to throw. Maybe
they poi nt guns at the receivers

James dismisses the passing
defense's numbers with a
laugh.
"No one's put the ball up
against us," James said.
"Against UCLA, it was raining,
so they only threw four times.
Indiana absolutely refused to
throw against us and Alabama
only passed nine times."
The other numbers aren't as
easy to dismiss. The fact is that
Washington has one of the
best defenses in the country.
Led by Michael Jackson,
an All-American at outside
linebacker, and cornerback
Nesby Glasgow, the Husky de
fense is a force with which to
be reckoned.
Jackson is a linebacker who
causes mistakes. As a purveyor
of the blitz, the 6-foot-V2, 226-
pound senior has caught the
eye of the Stanford coaching
staff, which UCLA had with the
blitz in the first half.
"We've got <o shore up our
pass protection," Walsh said.
Last week it was done by bring
ing the receivers in close to the
line to block. In addition,
Walsh admitted that Dils will
have to have more time.
"The quarterback will have
to hold the ball longer," Walsh
said.
Don't get the idea that Walsh
is biting his nails over the
Husky secondary.
"Washington having the
best passing defense doesn't
scare us," Walsh said. "We've
been up against top defenses
before and they weren't (tops)
afterwards."
Trying to stop the Cardinals'
passing attack scares James,
however. He doesn't know
what to expect from his secon
dary.
"I have no idea how they will
do," James said. "We haven't
played a team like Stanford.
We've got the experience, but
we haven't been tested."
Exam time is slated for 1:30

cial teams. Who will pass the
exam and continue on the red
(like a Rose) brick road to
Pasadena?
"It's not in our best interests to
talk about the Rose Bowl until
they invite us," Walsh said.
"Whether we finish third in the
conference or seventh in the
conference, we can only take
the games one at a time. We're

not the kind of team that can
automatically beat someone."

graphically illustrated to both
Stanford and Washington, the
best team doesn't always win.
Sportscaster Jim McKay has
told millions of television vie
wers about "the agony of de
feat."
To see "the agony" more
closely, one only needed to
view the defeats of Stanford
and Washington last week.
Washington lost to seventh-
Alabama 20-17, even
"ough they outgained the
Tide in total yards, led at
halftime 10-7, and had driven
to the Alabama 32 with two mi
nutes left, only to fumble the
ball and the game away.
Stanford lost to sixteenth
ranked UCLA 27-26, even
though they outgained the
Bruins in total yards and con
trolled the second half, only to
watch a Peter Boermeester
field goal split the uprights and
their upset hopes in half.
is in the same fix
in," Washington head
coach Don James said. "We
both have to win the rest of our
games to stay in the Pac-10 con
ference ranee."
Both teams have one loss in
the conference standings, with
both losses courtesy of the
Bruins from Westwood.
"We can't let last week's loss
affect the rest of the season,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "It was a tough loss,
particularly because of the
what-ifs. All of the players have
been walking around asking
'what if I had done
Wh,' or 'if I had only' . . . It's
unfair to scrutinize yourself
like that."
Things weren't all bad for the
Cardinals last Saturday night,
though. The passing attack, led
by quarterback Steve Dils, re
mained sharp against UCLA.
Dils picks apart the Bruins' de

fense for 262 yards, completing
21 passes in 35 attempts with
two interceptions. Dils also
leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense, and is responsible for
swallowing up 235 yards of turf
per game.
The list of the conference's
leading receivers reads like
Stanford's roster, with Phil
Francis, Darrin Nelson, and
Kenny Margerum ranking
1-2-3. Francis, who injured his
wrist and ribs last week in Los
Angeles, will play in today's
game.
Halfback Nelson is rushing
for 97 yards per outing good
enough for third in the confer
ence.
That was the sweet; now for
the bitter. There are some as
pects of last week's play that
need to be improved, and
Walsh is the first to admit it.
Take special teams, for in
stance.
"If we did nothing at all, they
would be better," Walsh said.
"The players' sensitivity to
something as stunning as that
will spur them on."
Stunning is a word used
rather loosely in Hollywood
and its environs, but Walsh
does not exaggerate: UCLA
won the game because of their
special teams.
Case in point: UCLA
halfback Theotis Brown ran
back a third-quarter kickoff 93
yards for a touchdown so
cleanly that his uniform didn't
need to be washed after the
game.
Case in point: Stanford
punter Brad Fox averaged only
33.7 yards per kick, though it
was due as much to poor field
position and poor protection
as it was to kicking.

The coaching staff has made
changes, and expects im
provement.
"We have put more front
line people and more experi
ence into the special teams,"
Walsh said, adding that he
"doesn't foresee any more
breakdowns."
The improvement will have
to come of age this week in
order to beat a team labeled by
one observer as "the best 2-3
team in the country."

Coach James is puzzled by
the Huskies' slow start. Maybe
he is confused by a little deja
vu.
Last year Washington lost
three of its firstfour games and
then caught fire. They won six
out of seven, blazed into the
Rose Bowl and beat a badly
outplayed Michigan, 27-20.
Coming into this year, they
were pregnant with optimism.
Three games out of five on the
wrong end of the scoreboard

has aborted that attitude.
"We aren't as confident as
we were in spring drills and in
fall practice. It's hard to pin
point just what has gone
wrong," James said.
The Husky offense, with
junior college transfer Tom
Porras at the helm, has
coughed and sputtered, but
may have found its niche
against Alabama. The 6-foot 1 Vi
inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).
Gaines caught a 26-yarder in
last year's 45-21 victory over
Stanford.
The man to keep an eye on is
number 24, junior tailback Joe
Steele. Steele is big for a tail
back 6-foot 4, 218 lbs., but
hasrf't let his size get in his way.
He is averaging 113.6 yards a
game, despite the fact that
Alabama held him to 52 yards.
The Cards remember him
well. He ran for 177 yards in last
year's victory, including runs
of 83 and seven yards for
touchdowns.
One aspect of Washington's

inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).
Gaines caught a 26-yarder in
last year's 45-21 victory over
Stanford.
The man to keep an eye on is
number 24, junior tailback Joe
Steele. Steele is big for a tail
back 6-foot 4, 218 lbs., but
hasrf't let his size get in his way.
He is averaging 113.6 yards a
game, despite the fact that
Alabama held him to 52 yards.
The Cards remember him
well. He ran for 177 yards in last
year's victory, including runs
of 83 and seven yards for
touchdowns.
One aspect of Washington's
game which has been disap
pointing has been their punt
ing. That's punting, as in spe

their only touchdown on a
blocked punt," James said.
"Last week, Alabama tackled
our punter on our sixteen yard
line and scored a touchdown
immediately afterwards."

a defense. It's got to be a stone
wall. The Huskies have only
given up 204.2 yards per game.
Okay, it's not a stone wall
they just put 12 players on the
field. Is that only 39.8 yards per
game given up through the air?
They must give the other team
a deflated ball to throw. Maybe
they poi nt guns at the receivers
and say, "I dare you, "
James dismisses the passing
defense's numbers with a
laugh.
"No one's put the ball up
against us," James said.
"Against UCLA, it was raining,
so they only threw four times.
Indiana absolutely refused to
throw against us and Alabama
only passed nine times."
The other numbers aren't as
easy to dismiss. The fact is that
Washington has one of the
best defenses in the country.
Led by Michael Jackson,
an All-American at outside
linebacker, and cornerback
Nesby Glasgow, the Husky de
fense is a force with which to
be reckoned.
Jackson is a linebacker who
causes mistakes. As a purveyor
of the blitz, the 6-foot-V2, 226-
pound senior has caught the
eye of the Stanford coaching
staff, which UCLA had with the
blitz in the first half.
"We've got <o shore up our
pass protection," Walsh said.
Last week it was done by bring
ing the receivers in close to the
line to block. In addition,
Walsh admitted that Dils will
have to have more time.
"The quarterback will have
to hold the ball longer," Walsh
said.
Don't get the idea that Walsh
is biting his nails over the
Husky secondary.
"Washington having the
best passing defense doesn't
scare us," Walsh said. "We've
been up against top defenses
before and they weren't (tops)
afterwards."
Trying to stop the Cardinals'
passing attack scares James,
however. He doesn't know
what to expect from his secon
dary.
"I have no idea how they will
do," James said. "We haven't
played a team like Stanford.
We've got the experience, but
we haven't been tested."
Exam time is slated for 1:30
p.m. today and both candi
dates have similar
backgrounds. Both have just
lost heartbreakers, both could
easily be 5-0, and both have
been beaten by the little things
like a breakdown in the spe
cial teams. Who will pass the
exam and continue on the red
(like a Rose) brick road to
Pasadena?
"It's not in our best interests to
talk about the Rose Bowl until
they invite us," Walsh said.
"Whether we finish third in the
conference or seventh in the
conference, we can only take
the games one at a time. We're

not the kind of team that can
automatically beat someone."
Maybe they cannot do it au
tomatically, but certainly the
55,000-plus fans expected
would be satisfied with a man
ual victory. As last week so
graphically illustrated to both
Stanford and Washington, the
best team doesn't always win.
Sportscaster Jim McKay has
told millions of television vie
wers about "the agony of de
feat."
To see "the agony" more
closely, one only needed to
view the defeats of Stanford
and Washington last week.
Washington lost to seventh-
Alabama 20-17, even
"ough they outgained the
Tide in total yards, led at
halftime 10-7, and had driven
to the Alabama 32 with two mi
nutes left, only to fumble the
ball and the game away.
Stanford lost to sixteenth
ranked UCLA 27-26, even
though they outgained the
Bruins in total yards and con
trolled the second half, only to
watch a Peter Boermeester
field goal split the uprights and
their upset hopes in half.
is in the same fix
in," Washington head
coach Don James said. "We
both have to win the rest of our
games to stay in the Pac-10 con
ference ranee."
Both teams have one loss in
the conference standings, with
both losses courtesy of the
Bruins from Westwood.
"We can't let last week's loss
affect the rest of the season,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "It was a tough loss,
particularly because of the
what-ifs. All of the players have
been walking around asking
'what if I had done
Wh,' or 'if I had only' . . . It's
unfair to scrutinize yourself
like that."
Things weren't all bad for the
Cardinals last Saturday night,
though. The passing attack, led
by quarterback Steve Dils, re
mained sharp against UCLA.
Dils picks apart the Bruins' de

fense for 262 yards, completing
21 passes in 35 attempts with
two interceptions. Dils also
leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense, and is responsible for
swallowing up 235 yards of turf
per game.
The list of the conference's
leading receivers reads like
Stanford's roster, with Phil
Francis, Darrin Nelson, and
Kenny Margerum ranking
1-2-3. Francis, who injured his
wrist and ribs last week in Los
Angeles, will play in today's
game.
Halfback Nelson is rushing
for 97 yards per outing good
enough for third in the confer
ence.
That was the sweet; now for
the bitter. There are some as
pects of last week's play that
need to be improved, and
Walsh is the first to admit it.
Take special teams, for in
stance.
"If we did nothing at all, they
would be better," Walsh said.
"The players' sensitivity to
something as stunning as that
will spur them on."
Stunning is a word used
rather loosely in Hollywood
and its environs, but Walsh
does not exaggerate: UCLA
won the game because of their
special teams.
Case in point: UCLA
halfback Theotis Brown ran
back a third-quarter kickoff 93
yards for a touchdown so
cleanly that his uniform didn't
need to be washed after the
game.
Case in point: Stanford
punter Brad Fox averaged only
33.7 yards per kick, though it
was due as much to poor field
position and poor protection
as it was to kicking.

The coaching staff has made
changes, and expects im
provement.
"We have put more front
line people and more experi
ence into the special teams,"
Walsh said, adding that he
"doesn't foresee any more
breakdowns."
The improvement will have
to come of age this week in
order to beat a team labeled by
one observer as "the best 2-3
team in the country."

Coach James is puzzled by
the Huskies' slow start. Maybe
he is confused by a little deja
vu.
Last year Washington lost
three of its firstfour games and
then caught fire. They won six
out of seven, blazed into the
Rose Bowl and beat a badly
outplayed Michigan, 27-20.
Coming into this year, they
were pregnant with optimism.
Three games out of five on the
wrong end of the scoreboard

has aborted that attitude.
"We aren't as confident as
we were in spring drills and in
fall practice. It's hard to pin
point just what has gone
wrong," James said.
The Husky offense, with
junior college transfer Tom
Porras at the helm, has
coughed and sputtered, but
may have found its niche
against Alabama. The 6-foot 1 Vi
inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).

field. Is that only 39.8 yards per
game given up through the air?
They must give the other team
a deflated ball to throw. Maybe
they poi nt guns at the receivers
and say, "I dare you, "
James dismisses the passing
defense's numbers with a
laugh.
"No one's put the ball up
against us," James said.
"Against UCLA, it was raining,
so they only threw four times.
Indiana absolutely refused to
throw against us and Alabama
only passed nine times."
The other numbers aren't as
easy to dismiss. The fact is that
Washington has one of the
best defenses in the country.
Led by Michael Jackson,
an All-American at outside
linebacker, and cornerback
Nesby Glasgow, the Husky de
fense is a force with which to
be reckoned.
Jackson is a linebacker who
causes mistakes. As a purveyor
of the blitz, the 6-foot-V2, 226-
pound senior has caught the
eye of the Stanford coaching
staff, which UCLA had with the
blitz in the first half.
"We've got <o shore up our
pass protection," Walsh said.
Last week it was done by bring
ing the receivers in close to the
line to block. In addition,
Walsh admitted that Dils will
have to have more time.
"The quarterback will have
to hold the ball longer," Walsh
said.
Don't get the idea that Walsh
is biting his nails over the
Husky secondary.
"Washington having the
best passing defense doesn't
scare us," Walsh said. "We've
been up against top defenses
before and they weren't (tops)
afterwards."
Trying to stop the Cardinals'
passing attack scares James,
however. He doesn't know
what to expect from his secon
dary.
"I have no idea how they will
do," James said. "We haven't
played a team like Stanford.
We've got the experience, but
we haven't been tested."
Exam time is slated for 1:30
p.m. today and both candi
dates have similar
backgrounds. Both have just
lost heartbreakers, both could
easily be 5-0, and both have
been beaten by the little things
like a breakdown in the spe
cial teams. Who will pass the
exam and continue on the red
(like a Rose) brick road to
Pasadena?
"It's not in our best interests to
talk about the Rose Bowl until
they invite us," Walsh said.
"Whether we finish third in the
conference or seventh in the
conference, we can only take
the games one at a time. We're

not the kind of team that can
automatically beat someone."
Maybe they cannot do it au
tomatically, but certainly the
55,000-plus fans expected
would be satisfied with a man
ual victory. As last week so
graphically illustrated to both
Stanford and Washington, the
best team doesn't always win.
Sportscaster Jim McKay has
told millions of television vie
wers about "the agony of de
feat."
To see "the agony" more
closely, one only needed to
view the defeats of Stanford
and Washington last week.
Washington lost to seventh-
Alabama 20-17, even
"ough they outgained the
Tide in total yards, led at
halftime 10-7, and had driven
to the Alabama 32 with two mi
nutes left, only to fumble the
ball and the game away.
Stanford lost to sixteenth
ranked UCLA 27-26, even
though they outgained the
Bruins in total yards and con
trolled the second half, only to
watch a Peter Boermeester
field goal split the uprights and
their upset hopes in half.
is in the same fix
in," Washington head
coach Don James said. "We
both have to win the rest of our
games to stay in the Pac-10 con
ference ranee."
Both teams have one loss in
the conference standings, with
both losses courtesy of the
Bruins from Westwood.
"We can't let last week's loss
affect the rest of the season,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "It was a tough loss,
particularly because of the
what-ifs. All of the players have
been walking around asking
'what if I had done
Wh,' or 'if I had only' . . . It's
unfair to scrutinize yourself
like that."
Things weren't all bad for the
Cardinals last Saturday night,
though. The passing attack, led
by quarterback Steve Dils, re
mained sharp against UCLA.
Dils picks apart the Bruins' de

fense for 262 yards, completing
21 passes in 35 attempts with
two interceptions. Dils also
leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense, and is responsible for
swallowing up 235 yards of turf
per game.
The list of the conference's
leading receivers reads like
Stanford's roster, with Phil
Francis, Darrin Nelson, and
Kenny Margerum ranking
1-2-3. Francis, who injured his
wrist and ribs last week in Los
Angeles, will play in today's
game.
Halfback Nelson is rushing
for 97 yards per outing good
enough for third in the confer
ence.
That was the sweet; now for
the bitter. There are some as
pects of last week's play that
need to be improved, and
Walsh is the first to admit it.
Take special teams, for in
stance.
"If we did nothing at all, they
would be better," Walsh said.
"The players' sensitivity to
something as stunning as that
will spur them on."
Stunning is a word used
rather loosely in Hollywood
and its environs, but Walsh
does not exaggerate: UCLA
won the game because of their
special teams.
Case in point: UCLA
halfback Theotis Brown ran
back a third-quarter kickoff 93
yards for a touchdown so
cleanly that his uniform didn't
need to be washed after the
game.
Case in point: Stanford
punter Brad Fox averaged only
33.7 yards per kick, though it
was due as much to poor field
position and poor protection
as it was to kicking.

The coaching staff has made
changes, and expects im
provement.
"We have put more front
line people and more experi
ence into the special teams,"
Walsh said, adding that he
"doesn't foresee any more
breakdowns."
The improvement will have
to come of age this week in
order to beat a team labeled by
one observer as "the best 2-3
team in the country."

Coach James is puzzled by
the Huskies' slow start. Maybe
he is confused by a little deja
vu.
Last year Washington lost
three of its firstfour games and
then caught fire. They won six
out of seven, blazed into the
Rose Bowl and beat a badly
outplayed Michigan, 27-20.
Coming into this year, they
were pregnant with optimism.
Three games out of five on the
wrong end of the scoreboard

has aborted that attitude.
"We aren't as confident as
we were in spring drills and in
fall practice. It's hard to pin
point just what has gone
wrong," James said.
The Husky offense, with
junior college transfer Tom
Porras at the helm, has
coughed and sputtered, but
may have found its niche
against Alabama. The 6-foot 1 Vi
inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).
Gaines caught a 26-yarder in
last year's 45-21 victory over
Stanford.
The man to keep an eye on is
number 24, junior tailback Joe
Steele. Steele is big for a tail
back 6-foot 4, 218 lbs., but
hasrf't let his size get in his way.
He is averaging 113.6 yards a
game, despite the fact that
Alabama held him to 52 yards.
The Cards remember him
well. He ran for 177 yards in last
year's victory, including runs
of 83 and seven yards for
touchdowns.
One aspect of Washington's
game which has been disap
pointing has been their punt
ing. That's punting, as in spe
cial teams. "UCLA scored
their only touchdown on a
blocked punt," James said.
"Last week, Alabama tackled
our punter on our sixteen yard
line and scored a touchdown
immediately afterwards."
"The defense," James con
tinued, "has played well
enough to win all five games,"
One look at the statistics,

like a breakdown in the spe
cial teams. Who will pass the
exam and continue on the red
(like a Rose) brick road to
Pasadena?
"It's not in our best interests to
talk about the Rose Bowl until
they invite us," Walsh said.
"Whether we finish third in the
conference or seventh in the
conference, we can only take
the games one at a time. We're

not the kind of team that can
automatically beat someone."
Maybe they cannot do it au
tomatically, but certainly the
55,000-plus fans expected
would be satisfied with a man
ual victory. As last week so
graphically illustrated to both
Stanford and Washington, the
best team doesn't always win.
Sportscaster Jim McKay has
told millions of television vie
wers about "the agony of de
feat."
To see "the agony" more
closely, one only needed to
view the defeats of Stanford
and Washington last week.
Washington lost to seventh-
Alabama 20-17, even
"ough they outgained the
Tide in total yards, led at
halftime 10-7, and had driven
to the Alabama 32 with two mi
nutes left, only to fumble the
ball and the game away.
Stanford lost to sixteenth
ranked UCLA 27-26, even
though they outgained the
Bruins in total yards and con
trolled the second half, only to
watch a Peter Boermeester
field goal split the uprights and
their upset hopes in half.
is in the same fix
in," Washington head
coach Don James said. "We
both have to win the rest of our
games to stay in the Pac-10 con
ference ranee."
Both teams have one loss in
the conference standings, with
both losses courtesy of the
Bruins from Westwood.
"We can't let last week's loss
affect the rest of the season,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "It was a tough loss,
particularly because of the
what-ifs. All of the players have
been walking around asking
'what if I had done
Wh,' or 'if I had only' . . . It's
unfair to scrutinize yourself
like that."
Things weren't all bad for the
Cardinals last Saturday night,
though. The passing attack, led
by quarterback Steve Dils, re
mained sharp against UCLA.
Dils picks apart the Bruins' de

fense for 262 yards, completing
21 passes in 35 attempts with
two interceptions. Dils also
leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense, and is responsible for
swallowing up 235 yards of turf
per game.
The list of the conference's
leading receivers reads like
Stanford's roster, with Phil
Francis, Darrin Nelson, and
Kenny Margerum ranking
1-2-3. Francis, who injured his
wrist and ribs last week in Los
Angeles, will play in today's
game.
Halfback Nelson is rushing
for 97 yards per outing good
enough for third in the confer
ence.
That was the sweet; now for
the bitter. There are some as
pects of last week's play that
need to be improved, and
Walsh is the first to admit it.
Take special teams, for in
stance.
"If we did nothing at all, they
would be better," Walsh said.
"The players' sensitivity to
something as stunning as that
will spur them on."
Stunning is a word used
rather loosely in Hollywood
and its environs, but Walsh
does not exaggerate: UCLA
won the game because of their
special teams.
Case in point: UCLA
halfback Theotis Brown ran
back a third-quarter kickoff 93
yards for a touchdown so
cleanly that his uniform didn't
need to be washed after the
game.
Case in point: Stanford
punter Brad Fox averaged only
33.7 yards per kick, though it
was due as much to poor field
position and poor protection
as it was to kicking.

The coaching staff has made
changes, and expects im
provement.
"We have put more front
line people and more experi
ence into the special teams,"
Walsh said, adding that he
"doesn't foresee any more
breakdowns."
The improvement will have
to come of age this week in
order to beat a team labeled by
one observer as "the best 2-3
team in the country."

Coach James is puzzled by
the Huskies' slow start. Maybe
he is confused by a little deja
vu.
Last year Washington lost
three of its firstfour games and
then caught fire. They won six
out of seven, blazed into the
Rose Bowl and beat a badly
outplayed Michigan, 27-20.
Coming into this year, they
were pregnant with optimism.
Three games out of five on the
wrong end of the scoreboard

has aborted that attitude.
"We aren't as confident as
we were in spring drills and in
fall practice. It's hard to pin
point just what has gone
wrong," James said.
The Husky offense, with
junior college transfer Tom
Porras at the helm, has
coughed and sputtered, but
may have found its niche
against Alabama. The 6-foot 1 Vi
inch, 189-pound junior threw
for 204 yards, including 74 and
58 yard bombs for touchdowns
to senior split end Spider
Gaines (6-foot 3,194 pounds).
Gaines caught a 26-yarder in
last year's 45-21 victory over
Stanford.
The man to keep an eye on is
number 24, junior tailback Joe
Steele. Steele is big for a tail
back 6-foot 4, 218 lbs., but
hasrf't let his size get in his way.
He is averaging 113.6 yards a
game, despite the fact that
Alabama held him to 52 yards.
The Cards remember him
well. He ran for 177 yards in last
year's victory, including runs
of 83 and seven yards for
touchdowns.
One aspect of Washington's
game which has been disap
pointing has been their punt
ing. That's punting, as in spe
cial teams. "UCLA scored
their only touchdown on a
blocked punt," James said.
"Last week, Alabama tackled
our punter on our sixteen yard
line and scored a touchdown
immediately afterwards."
"The defense," James con
tinued, "has played well
enough to win all five games,"
One look at the statistics,
and one realizes that it can't be

The Stanford version of the USC "student-body right" sweep at its finest here. Halfback Darrin Nelson (31),

ranked defense in the nation, so the yards might not come as easy.
a defense. It's got to be a stone
wall. The Huskies have only
given up 204.2 yards per game.
Okay, it's not a stone wall
they just put 12 players on the
field. Is that only 39.8 yards per
game given up through the air?
They must give the other team
a deflated ball to throw. Maybe
they poi nt guns at the receivers
and say, "I dare you, "
James dismisses the passing
defense's numbers with a
laugh.
"No one's put the ball up
against us," James said.
"Against UCLA, it was raining,
so they only threw four times.
Indiana absolutely refused to
throw against us and Alabama
only passed nine times."
The other numbers aren't as
easy to dismiss. The fact is that
Washington has one of the
best defenses in the country.
Led by Michael Jackson,
an All-American at outside
linebacker, and cornerback
Nesby Glasgow, the Husky de
fense is a force with which to
be reckoned.
Jackson is a linebacker who
causes mistakes. As a purveyor
of the blitz, the 6-foot-V2, 226-
pound senior has caught the
eye of the Stanford coaching
staff, which UCLA had with the
blitz in the first half.
"We've got <o shore up our
pass protection," Walsh said.
Last week it was done by bring
ing the receivers in close to the
line to block. In addition,
Walsh admitted that Dils will
have to have more time.
"The quarterback will have
to hold the ball longer," Walsh
said.
Don't get the idea that Walsh
is biting his nails over the
Husky secondary.
"Washington having the
best passing defense doesn't
scare us," Walsh said. "We've
been up against top defenses
before and they weren't (tops)
afterwards."
Trying to stop the Cardinals'
passing attack scares James,
however. He doesn't know
what to expect from his secon
dary.
"I have no idea how they will
do," James said. "We haven't
played a team like Stanford.
We've got the experience, but
we haven't been tested."
Exam time is slated for 1:30
p.m. today and both candi
dates have similar
backgrounds. Both have just
lost heartbreakers, both could
easily be 5-0, and both have
been beaten by the little things
like a breakdown in the spe
cial teams. Who will pass the
exam and continue on the red
(like a Rose) brick road to
Pasadena?
"It's not in our best interests to
talk about the Rose Bowl until
they invite us," Walsh said.
"Whether we finish third in the
conference or seventh in the
conference, we can only take
