# Bowe, Pleis, Smith
## Walsh's three wishes come true at tight end 
### CHRIS HAFT 
The Bronte sisters, Huey,
Dewey and Louie, and the Trin
ity are just some of the more
prominent trios that have
gained public notice. A more
obscure group, but one cer
tainly deserving of fame, exists
at Stanford: the unparalleled
tight end corps of Mitch Pleis,
Marty Smith and Pat Bowe.
A tight end must be able to
block and receive with equal
skill. His dual responsibility
makes him a highly valued
football commodity, and
coaches possessing one good
tight end consider themselves
lucky. With Pleis, Smith and
Bowe at their disposal, Stan
ford's coaches ought to feel
positively Fortune-kissed.

Since tight ends represent a
unique synthesis of offensive
lineman and wide receiver,
they must have a proper com
bination of size, speed and
strength to be effective.
Indeed, though being of
large stature (Pleis 6-foot-4,220
lbs.; Smith 6-6, 225; Bowe 6-7,
230), the Cards' talented three
some run the 40-yard dash in
around 4.9 seconds, according
to assistant coach Russel
Charles.
The players themselves,
however, like to joke about
their physical attributes. "They
say we're not fast enough to be
good receivers and not strong
enough to be good blockers
but we just disagree," said
Bowe.

"Let's just say we're slower
than Darrin Nelson but faster
than Gene Engle," Pleis
chimed in.
Since versatility is requisite
for tight ends, they work with
the linemen, receivers and the
backs during practices. "We
do a little bit of everything,"
Smith said. "We do a lot of ev
erything," Pleis corrected.
Once the game begins Pleis,
Smith and Bowe show why
they are regarded as the best
tight ends on the West Coast, if
not in the nation. Coach
Charles evaluates all three
highly.
"Pat Bowe is certainly an in
tense player," said Charles.
"His size is definitely an advan

tage; usually he's a lot bigger
than the outside linebacker
lined up against him. He's had
a good year receiving I don't
think he's dropped a pass all
year."
Though Charles calls Smith
an extremely good receiver, he
claims that Marty's blocking
has been the most impressive
facet of his play so far. "He's
gotten so much better in his
blocking this year. Of the
three, he's the most improved
player."
Pleis, continued Charles,
distinguishes himself with ba
lanced abilities. "Mitch is the
most well-rounded of our tight
ends. He catches and blocks
equally well. Sometimes he
gets overextended' on a block,

but usually he has natural
leverage when he hits people."
Bowe explained the crucial
part the tight ends play in Stan
ford's offense. "We're critical
to the success of the outside
running game. Out of anyone,
we play the biggest all-around
role." Bowe took care to stress
"all around, because nobody's
more important individually
than Darrin Nelson."
The luxury of having three
tight ends allows the coaches
to rotate them in and out ac
cording to the situation on the
field.
Pleis, said Charles, is used
for "crack" blocking because
of his agility. This tactic in
volves lining up outside and
coming in to block the inside
linebacker.
Smith and Bowe enter the
game for "motion series"
blocking, where the tight
begin split out, then come in
motion towards the line of
scrimmage.
All three often are used in
goal line situations. "That's
when we want to drive the de-.
fense back," said Charles. "We
also like having our bigger re
ceivers in there."
The Card triumvirate regards
this frequent shifting of roles
as the position's most difficult
aspect. "Adjusting from being
a receiver to being a blocker is
tough," said Bowe. "You're
constantly being tested,"
Smith added. M
To solve problems during'
the game, they generally hold
one or more sideline confer
ences during the first quarter.
"It's important that we discuss
things early in the game
who's doing what, stuff like
that," said Smith.
Conversation is not limited
to business, though. "In the
fourth quarter we usually talk
about the great blocks we
made," Bowe joked.
All agree gleefully that catch
ing passes is a tight end's most
enjoyable duty. This year thev|
have had lots of them, combin*
ing for 21 receptions and three
touchdowns.
Pleis, Smith and Bowe also
concurred on their favorite
off-season activity basket
ball claiming that the sport
hones their gridiron skills.
"You can lift all the weight
you want, but basketball is best
for the quickness you need,"
Smith said. "It's great for work
ing on going for a ball, and for
hand-eye coordination and
feet movement," Pleis
serted.
Bowe, however, was basket
ball's most exuberant propo
nent. "I'd rather play it than do
almost anything else," he said.
Though Pleis, Smith and
Bowe were recruited by most
of the Pac-10 schools, they all
admit they would have chosen
Stanford even if they could
have forseen splitting action at
tight end.

The three tight ends are good buddies off the field, but more importantly,
they're good buddies on the field.
"I knew what kind of situa
tion I was getting into," said
Pleis-, who transferred here last
year from Diablo Valley Junior
College. "Of all the schools
that recruited me, Stanford
had the most competition at
tight end."
Like Smith and Bowe, Pleis

was sold on the Farm by "the
education, the people I met
here, and the coaching staff.
The coaches were straightfor
ward I didn't feel like I was
getting handed a line."
One might expect hard feel
ings to crop up occasionally
among the trio, considering
they share playing time at just
one position.
Yet none of the three har
bors any feelings of enmity or
resentment towards the
others. They are a close-knit
group characterized by mutual
respect and above all,
camaraderie.
"I couldn't picture a more
perfect environment to play
in," Bowe affirmed. "We're re
ally at a high level of competi
tion, yet there's nothing 'cutth
roat' about it.
"Knowing in the spring that
all three of us would play
helped, too," he added. "We
treat the position as three guys
in one."

"It's a lot of fun," Smith ag
reed. "We have a good time
out there. There's no pressure
to beat out the other guy, and it
shows in our play."
The friendly atmosphere
"takes the 'job' out of foot
ball," said Pleis. "I always look
forward to seeing Pat and
Marty in practice."
The threesome generally go
their separate ways after prac
tices and games, but that is un
important, Pleis explained,
"because football occupies
most of our time anyway, so
we're always together on the
field."
"We're all individuals,"
Bowe elaborated. "We're all
different in a lot of ways, but in
a lot of ways we're similar. I
consider these two guys my
best friends on the team."

important, Pleis explained,
"because football occupies
most of our time anyway, so
we're always together on the
field."
"We're all individuals,"
Bowe elaborated. "We're all
different in a lot of ways, but in
a lot of ways we're similar. I
consider these two guys my
best friends on the team."
Fans enjoy watching Mitch
Pleis, Marty Smith and Pat
Bowe play but not as much
as those three enjoy being to
gether as athletes and friends.
The Bronte sisters, Huey,
Dewey and Louie, and the Trin
ity are just some of the more
prominent trios that have
gained public notice. A more
obscure group, but one cer
tainly deserving of fame, exists
at Stanford: the unparalleled
tight end corps of Mitch Pleis,
Marty Smith and Pat Bowe.
A tight end must be able to
block and receive with equal
skill. His dual responsibility
makes him a highly valued
football commodity, and
coaches possessing one good
tight end consider themselves
lucky. With Pleis, Smith and
Bowe at their disposal, Stan
ford's coaches ought to feel
positively Fortune-kissed.

Since tight ends represent a
unique synthesis of offensive
lineman and wide receiver,
they must have a proper com
bination of size, speed and
strength to be effective.
Indeed, though being of
large stature (Pleis 6-foot-4,220
lbs.; Smith 6-6, 225; Bowe 6-7,
230), the Cards' talented three
some run the 40-yard dash in
around 4.9 seconds, according
to assistant coach Russel
Charles.
The players themselves,
however, like to joke about
their physical attributes. "They
say we're not fast enough to be
good receivers and not strong
enough to be good blockers
but we just disagree," said
Bowe.

"Let's just say we're slower
than Darrin Nelson but faster
than Gene Engle," Pleis
chimed in.
Since versatility is requisite
for tight ends, they work with
the linemen, receivers and the
backs during practices. "We
do a little bit of everything,"
Smith said. "We do a lot of ev
erything," Pleis corrected.
Once the game begins Pleis,
Smith and Bowe show why
they are regarded as the best
tight ends on the West Coast, if
not in the nation. Coach
Charles evaluates all three
highly.
"Pat Bowe is certainly an in
tense player," said Charles.
"His size is definitely an advan

tage; usually he's a lot bigger
than the outside linebacker
lined up against him. He's had
a good year receiving I don't
think he's dropped a pass all
year."
Though Charles calls Smith
an extremely good receiver, he
claims that Marty's blocking
has been the most impressive
facet of his play so far. "He's
gotten so much better in his
blocking this year. Of the
three, he's the most improved
player."
Pleis, continued Charles,
distinguishes himself with ba
lanced abilities. "Mitch is the
most well-rounded of our tight
ends. He catches and blocks
equally well. Sometimes he
gets overextended' on a block,

but usually he has natural
leverage when he hits people."
Bowe explained the crucial
part the tight ends play in Stan
ford's offense. "We're critical
to the success of the outside
running game. Out of anyone,
we play the biggest all-around
role." Bowe took care to stress
"all around, because nobody's
more important individually
than Darrin Nelson."
The luxury of having three
tight ends allows the coaches
to rotate them in and out ac
cording to the situation on the
field.
Pleis, said Charles, is used
for "crack" blocking because
of his agility. This tactic in
volves lining up outside and
coming in to block the inside
linebacker.
Smith and Bowe enter the
game for "motion series"
blocking, where the tight
begin split out, then come in
motion towards the line of
scrimmage.
All three often are used in
goal line situations. "That's
when we want to drive the de-.
fense back," said Charles. "We
also like having our bigger re
ceivers in there."
The Card triumvirate regards
this frequent shifting of roles
as the position's most difficult
aspect. "Adjusting from being
a receiver to being a blocker is
tough," said Bowe. "You're
constantly being tested,"
Smith added. M
To solve problems during'
the game, they generally hold
one or more sideline confer
ences during the first quarter.
"It's important that we discuss
things early in the game
who's doing what, stuff like
that," said Smith.
Conversation is not limited
to business, though. "In the
fourth quarter we usually talk
about the great blocks we
made," Bowe joked.
All agree gleefully that catch
ing passes is a tight end's most
enjoyable duty. This year thev|
have had lots of them, combin*
ing for 21 receptions and three
touchdowns.
Pleis, Smith and Bowe also
concurred on their favorite
off-season activity basket
ball claiming that the sport
hones their gridiron skills.
"You can lift all the weight
you want, but basketball is best
for the quickness you need,"
Smith said. "It's great for work
ing on going for a ball, and for
hand-eye coordination and
feet movement," Pleis
serted.
Bowe, however, was basket
ball's most exuberant propo
nent. "I'd rather play it than do
almost anything else," he said.
Though Pleis, Smith and
Bowe were recruited by most
of the Pac-10 schools, they all
admit they would have chosen
Stanford even if they could
have forseen splitting action at
tight end.

The three tight ends are good buddies off the field, but more importantly,
they're good buddies on the field.
"I knew what kind of situa
tion I was getting into," said
Pleis-, who transferred here last
year from Diablo Valley Junior
College. "Of all the schools
that recruited me, Stanford
had the most competition at

Like Smith and Bowe, Pleis

was sold on the Farm by "the
education, the people I met
here, and the coaching staff.
The coaches were straightfor
ward I didn't feel like I was
getting handed a line."
One might expect hard feel
ings to crop up occasionally
among the trio, considering
they share playing time at just
one position.
Yet none of the three har
bors any feelings of enmity or
resentment towards the
others. They are a close-knit
group characterized by mutual
respect and above all,
camaraderie.
"I couldn't picture a more
perfect environment to play
in," Bowe affirmed. "We're re
ally at a high level of competi
tion, yet there's nothing 'cutth
roat' about it.
"Knowing in the spring that
all three of us would play
helped, too," he added. "We
treat the position as three guys
in one."

"It's a lot of fun," Smith ag
reed. "We have a good time
out there. There's no pressure
to beat out the other guy, and it
shows in our play."
The friendly atmosphere
"takes the 'job' out of foot
ball," said Pleis. "I always look
forward to seeing Pat and
Marty in practice."
The threesome generally go
their separate ways after prac
tices and games, but that is un

in one."

"It's a lot of fun," Smith ag
reed. "We have a good time
out there. There's no pressure
to beat out the other guy, and it
shows in our play."
The friendly atmosphere
"takes the 'job' out of foot
ball," said Pleis. "I always look
forward to seeing Pat and
Marty in practice."
The threesome generally go
their separate ways after prac
tices and games, but that is un
important, Pleis explained,
"because football occupies
most of our time anyway, so
we're always together on the
field."
"We're all individuals,"
Bowe elaborated. "We're all
different in a lot of ways, but in
a lot of ways we're similar. I
consider these two guys my
best friends on the team."
Fans enjoy watching Mitch
Pleis, Marty Smith and Pat
Bowe play but not as much
as those three enjoy being to
gether as athletes and friends.
The Bronte sisters, Huey,
Dewey and Louie, and the Trin
ity are just some of the more
prominent trios that have
gained public notice. A more
obscure group, but one cer
tainly deserving of fame, exists
at Stanford: the unparalleled
tight end corps of Mitch Pleis,
Marty Smith and Pat Bowe.
A tight end must be able to
block and receive with equal
skill. His dual responsibility
makes him a highly valued
football commodity, and
coaches possessing one good
tight end consider themselves
lucky. With Pleis, Smith and
Bowe at their disposal, Stan
ford's coaches ought to feel
positively Fortune-kissed.

Since tight ends represent a
unique synthesis of offensive
lineman and wide receiver,
they must have a proper com
bination of size, speed and
strength to be effective.
Indeed, though being of
large stature (Pleis 6-foot-4,220
lbs.; Smith 6-6, 225; Bowe 6-7,
230), the Cards' talented three
some run the 40-yard dash in
around 4.9 seconds, according
to assistant coach Russel
Charles.
The players themselves,
however, like to joke about
their physical attributes. "They
say we're not fast enough to be
good receivers and not strong
enough to be good blockers
but we just disagree," said
Bowe.

"Let's just say we're slower
than Darrin Nelson but faster
than Gene Engle," Pleis
chimed in.
Since versatility is requisite
for tight ends, they work with
the linemen, receivers and the
backs during practices. "We
do a little bit of everything,"
Smith said. "We do a lot of ev
erything," Pleis corrected.
Once the game begins Pleis,
Smith and Bowe show why
they are regarded as the best
tight ends on the West Coast, if
not in the nation. Coach
Charles evaluates all three
highly.
"Pat Bowe is certainly an in
tense player," said Charles.
"His size is definitely an advan

tage; usually he's a lot bigger
than the outside linebacker
lined up against him. He's had
a good year receiving I don't
think he's dropped a pass all
year."
Though Charles calls Smith
an extremely good receiver, he
claims that Marty's blocking
has been the most impressive
facet of his play so far. "He's
gotten so much better in his
blocking this year. Of the
three, he's the most improved
player."
Pleis, continued Charles,
distinguishes himself with ba
lanced abilities. "Mitch is the
most well-rounded of our tight
ends. He catches and blocks
equally well. Sometimes he
gets overextended' on a block,

but usually he has natural
leverage when he hits people."
Bowe explained the crucial
part the tight ends play in Stan
ford's offense. "We're critical
to the success of the outside
running game. Out of anyone,
we play the biggest all-around
role." Bowe took care to stress
"all around, because nobody's
more important individually
than Darrin Nelson."
The luxury of having three
tight ends allows the coaches
to rotate them in and out ac
cording to the situation on the
field.
Pleis, said Charles, is used
for "crack" blocking because
of his agility. This tactic in
volves lining up outside and
coming in to block the inside
linebacker.
Smith and Bowe enter the
game for "motion series"
blocking, where the tight
begin split out, then come in
motion towards the line of
scrimmage.
All three often are used in
goal line situations. "That's
when we want to drive the de-.
fense back," said Charles. "We
also like having our bigger re
ceivers in there."
The Card triumvirate regards
this frequent shifting of roles
as the position's most difficult
aspect. "Adjusting from being
a receiver to being a blocker is
tough," said Bowe. "You're
constantly being tested,"
Smith added. M
To solve problems during'
the game, they generally hold
one or more sideline confer
ences during the first quarter.
"It's important that we discuss
things early in the game
who's doing what, stuff like
that," said Smith.
Conversation is not limited
to business, though. "In the
fourth quarter we usually talk
about the great blocks we
made," Bowe joked.
All agree gleefully that catch
ing passes is a tight end's most
enjoyable duty. This year thev|
have had lots of them, combin*
ing for 21 receptions and three
touchdowns.
Pleis, Smith and Bowe also
concurred on their favorite
off-season activity basket
ball claiming that the sport
hones their gridiron skills.
"You can lift all the weight
you want, but basketball is best
for the quickness you need,"
Smith said. "It's great for work
ing on going for a ball, and for
hand-eye coordination and
feet movement," Pleis
serted.
Bowe, however, was basket
ball's most exuberant propo
nent. "I'd rather play it than do
almost anything else," he said.
Though Pleis, Smith and
Bowe were recruited by most
of the Pac-10 schools, they all
admit they would have chosen
Stanford even if they could
have forseen splitting action at
tight end.

The three tight ends are good buddies off the field, but more importantly,
they're good buddies on the field.
"I knew what kind of situa
tion I was getting into," said
Pleis-, who transferred here last
year from Diablo Valley Junior
College. "Of all the schools
that recruited me, Stanford
had the most competition at

Like Smith and Bowe, Pleis

was sold on the Farm by "the
education, the people I met
here, and the coaching staff.
The coaches were straightfor
ward I didn't feel like I was
getting handed a line."
One might expect hard feel
ings to crop up occasionally
among the trio, considering
they share playing time at just
one position.
Yet none of the three har
bors any feelings of enmity or
resentment towards the
others. They are a close-knit
group characterized by mutual
respect and above all,
camaraderie.
"I couldn't picture a more
perfect environment to play
in," Bowe affirmed. "We're re
ally at a high level of competi
tion, yet there's nothing 'cutth
roat' about it.
"Knowing in the spring that
all three of us would play

resentment towards the
others. They are a close-knit
group characterized by mutual
respect and above all,
camaraderie.
"I couldn't picture a more
perfect environment to play
in," Bowe affirmed. "We're re
ally at a high level of competi
tion, yet there's nothing 'cutth
roat' about it.
"Knowing in the spring that
all three of us would play
helped, too," he added. "We
treat the position as three guys
in one."

"It's a lot of fun," Smith ag
reed. "We have a good time
out there. There's no pressure
to beat out the other guy, and it
shows in our play."
The friendly atmosphere
"takes the 'job' out of foot
ball," said Pleis. "I always look
forward to seeing Pat and
Marty in practice."
The threesome generally go
their separate ways after prac
tices and games, but that is un
important, Pleis explained,
"because football occupies
most of our time anyway, so
we're always together on the
field."
"We're all individuals,"
Bowe elaborated. "We're all
different in a lot of ways, but in
a lot of ways we're similar. I
consider these two guys my
best friends on the team."
Fans enjoy watching Mitch
Pleis, Marty Smith and Pat
Bowe play but not as much
as those three enjoy being to
gether as athletes and friends.
The Bronte sisters, Huey,
Dewey and Louie, and the Trin
ity are just some of the more
prominent trios that have
gained public notice. A more
obscure group, but one cer
tainly deserving of fame, exists
at Stanford: the unparalleled
tight end corps of Mitch Pleis,
Marty Smith and Pat Bowe.
A tight end must be able to
block and receive with equal
skill. His dual responsibility
makes him a highly valued
football commodity, and
coaches possessing one good
tight end consider themselves
lucky. With Pleis, Smith and
Bowe at their disposal, Stan
ford's coaches ought to feel
positively Fortune-kissed.

Since tight ends represent a
unique synthesis of offensive
lineman and wide receiver,
they must have a proper com
bination of size, speed and
strength to be effective.
Indeed, though being of
large stature (Pleis 6-foot-4,220
lbs.; Smith 6-6, 225; Bowe 6-7,
230), the Cards' talented three
some run the 40-yard dash in
around 4.9 seconds, according
to assistant coach Russel
Charles.
The players themselves,
however, like to joke about
their physical attributes. "They
say we're not fast enough to be
good receivers and not strong
enough to be good blockers
but we just disagree," said
Bowe.

"Let's just say we're slower
than Darrin Nelson but faster
than Gene Engle," Pleis
chimed in.
Since versatility is requisite
for tight ends, they work with
the linemen, receivers and the
backs during practices. "We
do a little bit of everything,"
Smith said. "We do a lot of ev
erything," Pleis corrected.
Once the game begins Pleis,
Smith and Bowe show why
they are regarded as the best
tight ends on the West Coast, if
not in the nation. Coach
Charles evaluates all three
highly.
"Pat Bowe is certainly an in
tense player," said Charles.
"His size is definitely an advan

tage; usually he's a lot bigger
than the outside linebacker
lined up against him. He's had
a good year receiving I don't
think he's dropped a pass all
year."
Though Charles calls Smith
an extremely good receiver, he
claims that Marty's blocking
has been the most impressive
facet of his play so far. "He's
gotten so much better in his
blocking this year. Of the
three, he's the most improved
player."
Pleis, continued Charles,
distinguishes himself with ba
lanced abilities. "Mitch is the
most well-rounded of our tight
ends. He catches and blocks
equally well. Sometimes he
gets overextended' on a block,

but usually he has natural
leverage when he hits people."
Bowe explained the crucial
part the tight ends play in Stan
ford's offense. "We're critical
to the success of the outside
running game. Out of anyone,
we play the biggest all-around
role." Bowe took care to stress
"all around, because nobody's
more important individually
than Darrin Nelson."
The luxury of having three
tight ends allows the coaches
to rotate them in and out ac
cording to the situation on the
field.
Pleis, said Charles, is used
for "crack" blocking because
of his agility. This tactic in
volves lining up outside and
coming in to block the inside
linebacker.
Smith and Bowe enter the
game for "motion series"
blocking, where the tight
begin split out, then come in
motion towards the line of
scrimmage.
All three often are used in
goal line situations. "That's
when we want to drive the de-.
fense back," said Charles. "We
also like having our bigger re
ceivers in there."
The Card triumvirate regards
this frequent shifting of roles
as the position's most difficult
aspect. "Adjusting from being
a receiver to being a blocker is
tough," said Bowe. "You're
constantly being tested,"
Smith added. M
To solve problems during'
the game, they generally hold
one or more sideline confer
ences during the first quarter.
"It's important that we discuss
things early in the game
who's doing what, stuff like
that," said Smith.
Conversation is not limited
to business, though. "In the
fourth quarter we usually talk
about the great blocks we
made," Bowe joked.
All agree gleefully that catch
ing passes is a tight end's most
enjoyable duty. This year thev|
have had lots of them, combin*
ing for 21 receptions and three
touchdowns.
Pleis, Smith and Bowe also
concurred on their favorite
off-season activity basket
ball claiming that the sport
hones their gridiron skills.
"You can lift all the weight
you want, but basketball is best
for the quickness you need,"
Smith said. "It's great for work
ing on going for a ball, and for
hand-eye coordination and
feet movement," Pleis
serted.
Bowe, however, was basket
ball's most exuberant propo
nent. "I'd rather play it than do
almost anything else," he said.
Though Pleis, Smith and
Bowe were recruited by most
of the Pac-10 schools, they all
admit they would have chosen
Stanford even if they could
have forseen splitting action at
tight end.

The three tight ends are good buddies off the field, but more importantly,
they're good buddies on the field.
"I knew what kind of situa
tion I was getting into," said
Pleis-, who transferred here last
year from Diablo Valley Junior
College. "Of all the schools
that recruited me, Stanford
had the most competition at
tight end."
Like Smith and Bowe, Pleis

was sold on the Farm by "the
education, the people I met
here, and the coaching staff.
The coaches were straightfor
ward I didn't feel like I was
getting handed a line."
One might expect hard feel
ings to crop up occasionally
among the trio, considering
they share playing time at just
one position.
Yet none of the three har
bors any feelings of enmity or
resentment towards the
others. They are a close-knit
group characterized by mutual
respect and above all,
camaraderie.
"I couldn't picture a more
