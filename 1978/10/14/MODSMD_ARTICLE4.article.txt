# Tyler takes over at split end
## 
### SALLY JENKINS 
Andre who? Tyler. The guy
who scored the touchdown in
the third quarter against UCLA.
The guy who's taken Vince
Mulroy's place at flanker as a
sophomore. That's him.
Number 25.
It's very possible that Tyler
could have been facing the
other side of the line last week,
playing for UCLA. Or just as
easily for Oregon State two
weeks from now. Both schools
recruited him from Polytechnic
High School in Long Beach, the
same school that produced
Tony Hill and Gene
Washington, the top two re
ceivers in Stanford history.
He's in good company.
During his high school
career Tyler caught 49 passes
for 1035 yards and 10
touchdowns. He was named
All-City and All-League in his
senior year. He made nine
catches for 149 yards in his best
game and he was also a basket
ball star as well as a three-time
league champ in the high
jump.
He's an economics major
and his career goal is to be
come a business executive. As
a matter of fact he's more seri
ous about his studies than
about his football.
"It takes a lot of effort, a lot
of extra effort," Tyler said.
"Football takes about six hours
a day. You are out there from
about 2 to 7 p.m. every day, so
you have to work harder than
most people.
I "I think school is more im
portant," Tyler added. After
football, what do you do? "If
the opportunity of pro ball
comes along I'll take it, but
after that you have to do some
thing."
Why did Tyler choose foot
ball to follow up rather than
track or basketball? "I like
football better because with a
team you can really put some
thing big together," Tyler said.
"Because of my injuries last
year I couldn't do the high
jump. I tried and it just didn't
)work. But I would like to try
again this year."
According to coach Bill
Walsh, Tyler is "potentially the
best all-around receiver on the
team." Tyler agrees, but hesit
antly.
"It's tough to say. Ken
Margerum is a really good
athlete. There are things I do
well and things he does well.
Potentially, yeah, coach Walsh
is right," Tyler said, "but it'd

take a lot of work. Margerum is
just a really good receiver, I
give him all the credit in the
world. If I could get up to that
level I think I would be one,
too."
It seems to be just a question
of experience. Which brings
up another question. Why is
Tyler, a sophomore, starting
over Mulroy, a veteran? Ac
cording to Tyler, Mulroy has
had a hard time getting started
this year as a result of injuries.
"Vinnie's been injured this
year," Tyler said. "He hurt his
ankle, then Gordy Banks
started, and Vinnie missed two
weeks of practice. When you
miss even two or three days it
hurts. It hurts your timing, it
causes definite problems. I'd
attribute everything to his in
juries."
Coach Walsh agrees. "It's
just one of those things that
happens in athletics; one man
does certain things better than
another. Vince has been ham
pered by injuries all this year,
so he hasn't had near the work
that Andre has had. When
Andre was out working, Vince
was trying to recover; so Andre
has just passed him."
Tyler himself has had his
own troubles with injuries. Last
year he was bothered all sea
son by a persistent groin pull.
However he seems to feel he is
in fairly good shape.
"I'm about 95 percent reco
vered. Before the Tulane game
it was aggravated and it was
questionable whether or not
I'd be able to play," Tyler said.
'.'But I'd say I was recovered."
One can't help wondering if
Tyler is prepared to play such a
large role on the team. He's not
sure himself.
"I wondered about that,"
Tyler said. "I really wasn't sure
if I wanted to be in the thick of
things, if I was ready.
"Before the UCLA game I
was really tense, but it wasn't
that bad. My effort was alright,
not great. But I could have
done better," Tyler added.
Steve Dils thinks Tyler is
prepared to play regardless of
his lack of experience.
"It's no problem at all. When
you are as talented as Andre
is," Dils said, "it's no draw
back. He's got a lot to learn of
course, but he's got great
natural instincts and he's doing
a super job.
"If I had to compare him to
someone," Dils continued, "it
would be Tony Hill. He's not as
fast as some on the team but

he's got a real smooth stride.
He's a lot of fun to throw to, he
jumps real well and makes
some tough cuts."
Tyler proved himself last
Saturday when he caught a
pass from Dils to score his first
TD ever for Stanford.
"The play is not designed for
a great big gain, but hopefully I
can break the scene," Tyler
said. "When I caught the pass I
expected to get hit, but I think
the guy was going for the i nter
ception, I think he took a gam
ble. I was lucky enough to
shake him off and I looked up
and there was no one there."
For a while, it looked as if the
Cardinals might have won the
game as a result of Tyler's
score. According to Tyler,
Stanford actually outplayed the
Bruins.
"We went into the game
knowing that it wasn't going to
be a lucky chance if we won,"
Tyler said. "We just got a
couple of bad breaks, a couple
of key calls by the officials that
really hurt us. But I think we
outplayed them."
Though they lost, Tyler was
thrilled to score his first
touchdown, particularly since
no one expected him to start,
least of all himself.
"I planned to play a lot, I
thought I'd eventually get a
chance," Tyler said. "Tony Hill
didn't start until the end of his
junior year. I thought I had a
chance, I expected to contri
bute some. But I didn't think
I'd play that big a role.
Whenever something like this
happens it's bound to be a sur
prise."
One can't help wondering
how the chronic shuffling of
receivers has affected Stan
ford's passing game as a whole.
Dils doesn't think it has.
"It certainly hasn't made it
any easier," Dils said, "but I
don't think it's hurt. They're all
such good athletes. We're just
trying to find a combination
that works."
Tyler doesn't think it has
hurt, either.
"I don't think it's hurt Dils,"
Tyler said. "He's been adjust
ing to it. He's thrown to 10 dif
ferent receivers. He knows the
receivers."
At any rate, Tyler could be
what Stanford is looking for.
According to Walsh, "He's al
ready proven he can play
under pressure. He's just a
very good heads-up ball
player."

recruited him from Polytechnic
High School in Long Beach, the
same school that produced
Tony Hill and Gene
Washington, the top two re
ceivers in Stanford history.
He's in good company.
During his high school
career Tyler caught 49 passes
for 1035 yards and 10
touchdowns. He was named
All-City and All-League in his
senior year. He made nine
catches for 149 yards in his best
game and he was also a basket
ball star as well as a three-time
league champ in the high
jump.
He's an economics major
and his career goal is to be
come a business executive. As
a matter of fact he's more seri
ous about his studies than
about his football.
"It takes a lot of effort, a lot
of extra effort," Tyler said.
"Football takes about six hours
a day. You are out there from
about 2 to 7 p.m. every day, so
you have to work harder than
most people.
I "I think school is more im
portant," Tyler added. After
football, what do you do? "If
the opportunity of pro ball
comes along I'll take it, but
after that you have to do some
thing."
Why did Tyler choose foot
ball to follow up rather than
track or basketball? "I like
football better because with a
team you can really put some
thing big together," Tyler said.
"Because of my injuries last
year I couldn't do the high
jump. I tried and it just didn't
)work. But I would like to try
again this year."
According to coach Bill
Walsh, Tyler is "potentially the
best all-around receiver on the
team." Tyler agrees, but hesit
antly.
"It's tough to say. Ken
Margerum is a really good
athlete. There are things I do
well and things he does well.
Potentially, yeah, coach Walsh
is right," Tyler said, "but it'd

take a lot of work. Margerum is
just a really good receiver, I
give him all the credit in the
world. If I could get up to that
level I think I would be one,
too."
It seems to be just a question
of experience. Which brings
up another question. Why is
Tyler, a sophomore, starting
over Mulroy, a veteran? Ac
cording to Tyler, Mulroy has
had a hard time getting started
this year as a result of injuries.
"Vinnie's been injured this
year," Tyler said. "He hurt his
ankle, then Gordy Banks
started, and Vinnie missed two
weeks of practice. When you
miss even two or three days it
hurts. It hurts your timing, it
causes definite problems. I'd
attribute everything to his in
juries."
Coach Walsh agrees. "It's
just one of those things that
happens in athletics; one man
does certain things better than
another. Vince has been ham
pered by injuries all this year,
so he hasn't had near the work
that Andre has had. When
Andre was out working, Vince
was trying to recover; so Andre
has just passed him."
Tyler himself has had his
own troubles with injuries. Last
year he was bothered all sea
son by a persistent groin pull.
However he seems to feel he is
in fairly good shape.
"I'm about 95 percent reco
vered. Before the Tulane game
it was aggravated and it was
questionable whether or not
I'd be able to play," Tyler said.
'.'But I'd say I was recovered."
One can't help wondering if
Tyler is prepared to play such a
large role on the team. He's not
sure himself.
"I wondered about that,"
Tyler said. "I really wasn't sure
if I wanted to be in the thick of
things, if I was ready.
"Before the UCLA game I
was really tense, but it wasn't
that bad. My effort was alright,
not great. But I could have
done better," Tyler added.
Steve Dils thinks Tyler is
prepared to play regardless of
his lack of experience.
"It's no problem at all. When
you are as talented as Andre
is," Dils said, "it's no draw
back. He's got a lot to learn of
course, but he's got great
natural instincts and he's doing
a super job.
"If I had to compare him to
someone," Dils continued, "it
would be Tony Hill. He's not as
fast as some on the team but

he's got a real smooth stride.
He's a lot of fun to throw to, he
jumps real well and makes
some tough cuts."
Tyler proved himself last
Saturday when he caught a
pass from Dils to score his first
TD ever for Stanford.
"The play is not designed for
a great big gain, but hopefully I
can break the scene," Tyler
said. "When I caught the pass I
expected to get hit, but I think
the guy was going for the i nter
ception, I think he took a gam
ble. I was lucky enough to
shake him off and I looked up
and there was no one there."
For a while, it looked as if the
Cardinals might have won the
game as a result of Tyler's
score. According to Tyler,
Stanford actually outplayed the
Bruins.
"We went into the game
knowing that it wasn't going to
be a lucky chance if we won,"
Tyler said. "We just got a
couple of bad breaks, a couple
of key calls by the officials that
really hurt us. But I think we
outplayed them."
Though they lost, Tyler was
thrilled to score his first
touchdown, particularly since
no one expected him to start,
least of all himself.
"I planned to play a lot, I
thought I'd eventually get a
chance," Tyler said. "Tony Hill
didn't start until the end of his
junior year. I thought I had a
chance, I expected to contri
bute some. But I didn't think
I'd play that big a role.
Whenever something like this
happens it's bound to be a sur
prise."
One can't help wondering
how the chronic shuffling of
receivers has affected Stan
ford's passing game as a whole.
Dils doesn't think it has.
"It certainly hasn't made it
any easier," Dils said, "but I
don't think it's hurt. They're all
such good athletes. We're just
trying to find a combination
that works."
Tyler doesn't think it has
hurt, either.
"I don't think it's hurt Dils,"
Tyler said. "He's been adjust
ing to it. He's thrown to 10 dif
ferent receivers. He knows the
receivers."
At any rate, Tyler could be
what Stanford is looking for.
According to Walsh, "He's al
ready proven he can play
under pressure. He's just a
very good heads-up ball
player."

game and he was also a basket
ball star as well as a three-time
league champ in the high
jump.
He's an economics major
and his career goal is to be
come a business executive. As
a matter of fact he's more seri
ous about his studies than
about his football.
"It takes a lot of effort, a lot
of extra effort," Tyler said.
"Football takes about six hours
a day. You are out there from
about 2 to 7 p.m. every day, so
you have to work harder than
most people.
I "I think school is more im
portant," Tyler added. After
football, what do you do? "If
the opportunity of pro ball
comes along I'll take it, but
after that you have to do some
thing."
Why did Tyler choose foot
ball to follow up rather than
track or basketball? "I like
football better because with a
team you can really put some
thing big together," Tyler said.
"Because of my injuries last
year I couldn't do the high
jump. I tried and it just didn't
)work. But I would like to try
again this year."
According to coach Bill
Walsh, Tyler is "potentially the
best all-around receiver on the
team." Tyler agrees, but hesit
antly.
"It's tough to say. Ken
Margerum is a really good
athlete. There are things I do
well and things he does well.
Potentially, yeah, coach Walsh
is right," Tyler said, "but it'd

take a lot of work. Margerum is
just a really good receiver, I
give him all the credit in the
world. If I could get up to that
level I think I would be one,
too."
It seems to be just a question
of experience. Which brings
up another question. Why is
Tyler, a sophomore, starting
over Mulroy, a veteran? Ac
cording to Tyler, Mulroy has
had a hard time getting started
this year as a result of injuries.
"Vinnie's been injured this
year," Tyler said. "He hurt his
ankle, then Gordy Banks
started, and Vinnie missed two
weeks of practice. When you
miss even two or three days it
hurts. It hurts your timing, it
causes definite problems. I'd
attribute everything to his in
juries."
Coach Walsh agrees. "It's
just one of those things that
happens in athletics; one man
does certain things better than
another. Vince has been ham
pered by injuries all this year,
so he hasn't had near the work
that Andre has had. When
Andre was out working, Vince
was trying to recover; so Andre
has just passed him."
Tyler himself has had his
own troubles with injuries. Last
year he was bothered all sea
son by a persistent groin pull.
However he seems to feel he is
in fairly good shape.
"I'm about 95 percent reco
vered. Before the Tulane game
it was aggravated and it was
questionable whether or not
I'd be able to play," Tyler said.
'.'But I'd say I was recovered."
One can't help wondering if
Tyler is prepared to play such a
large role on the team. He's not
sure himself.
"I wondered about that,"
Tyler said. "I really wasn't sure
if I wanted to be in the thick of
things, if I was ready.
"Before the UCLA game I
was really tense, but it wasn't
that bad. My effort was alright,
not great. But I could have
done better," Tyler added.
Steve Dils thinks Tyler is
prepared to play regardless of
his lack of experience.
"It's no problem at all. When
you are as talented as Andre
is," Dils said, "it's no draw
back. He's got a lot to learn of
course, but he's got great
natural instincts and he's doing
a super job.
"If I had to compare him to
someone," Dils continued, "it
would be Tony Hill. He's not as
fast as some on the team but

he's got a real smooth stride.
He's a lot of fun to throw to, he
jumps real well and makes
some tough cuts."
Tyler proved himself last
Saturday when he caught a
pass from Dils to score his first
TD ever for Stanford.
"The play is not designed for
a great big gain, but hopefully I
can break the scene," Tyler
said. "When I caught the pass I
expected to get hit, but I think
the guy was going for the i nter
ception, I think he took a gam
ble. I was lucky enough to
shake him off and I looked up
and there was no one there."
For a while, it looked as if the
Cardinals might have won the
game as a result of Tyler's
score. According to Tyler,
Stanford actually outplayed the
Bruins.
"We went into the game
knowing that it wasn't going to
be a lucky chance if we won,"
Tyler said. "We just got a
couple of bad breaks, a couple
of key calls by the officials that
really hurt us. But I think we
outplayed them."
Though they lost, Tyler was
thrilled to score his first
touchdown, particularly since
no one expected him to start,
least of all himself.
"I planned to play a lot, I
thought I'd eventually get a
chance," Tyler said. "Tony Hill
didn't start until the end of his
junior year. I thought I had a
chance, I expected to contri
bute some. But I didn't think
I'd play that big a role.
Whenever something like this
happens it's bound to be a sur
prise."
One can't help wondering
how the chronic shuffling of
receivers has affected Stan
ford's passing game as a whole.
Dils doesn't think it has.
"It certainly hasn't made it
any easier," Dils said, "but I
don't think it's hurt. They're all
such good athletes. We're just
trying to find a combination
that works."
Tyler doesn't think it has
hurt, either.
"I don't think it's hurt Dils,"
Tyler said. "He's been adjust
ing to it. He's thrown to 10 dif
ferent receivers. He knows the
receivers."
At any rate, Tyler could be
what Stanford is looking for.
According to Walsh, "He's al
ready proven he can play
under pressure. He's just a
very good heads-up ball
player."

Sophomore flanker Andre Tyler sprints down the field unmolested
after catching a Steve Dils pass over the middle. The play was good
for 55 yards and the Cards' last touchdown, but Stanford still came up
one point short.
Andre who? Tyler. The guy

It's very possible that Tyler

playing for UCLA. Or just as
easily for Oregon State two

Tony Hill and Gene
Washington, the top two re

a day. You are out there from
about 2 to 7 p.m. every day, so
you have to work harder than
most people.
I "I think school is more im
portant," Tyler added. After
football, what do you do? "If
the opportunity of pro ball
comes along I'll take it, but
after that you have to do some
thing."
Why did Tyler choose foot
ball to follow up rather than
track or basketball? "I like
football better because with a
team you can really put some
thing big together," Tyler said.
"Because of my injuries last
year I couldn't do the high
jump. I tried and it just didn't
)work. But I would like to try
again this year."
According to coach Bill
Walsh, Tyler is "potentially the
best all-around receiver on the
team." Tyler agrees, but hesit
antly.
"It's tough to say. Ken
Margerum is a really good
athlete. There are things I do
well and things he does well.
Potentially, yeah, coach Walsh
is right," Tyler said, "but it'd

take a lot of work. Margerum is
just a really good receiver, I
give him all the credit in the
world. If I could get up to that
level I think I would be one,
too."
It seems to be just a question
of experience. Which brings
up another question. Why is
Tyler, a sophomore, starting
over Mulroy, a veteran? Ac
cording to Tyler, Mulroy has
had a hard time getting started
this year as a result of injuries.
"Vinnie's been injured this
year," Tyler said. "He hurt his
ankle, then Gordy Banks
started, and Vinnie missed two
weeks of practice. When you
miss even two or three days it
hurts. It hurts your timing, it
causes definite problems. I'd
attribute everything to his in
juries."
Coach Walsh agrees. "It's
just one of those things that
happens in athletics; one man
does certain things better than
another. Vince has been ham
pered by injuries all this year,
so he hasn't had near the work
that Andre has had. When
Andre was out working, Vince
was trying to recover; so Andre
has just passed him."
Tyler himself has had his
own troubles with injuries. Last
year he was bothered all sea
son by a persistent groin pull.
However he seems to feel he is
in fairly good shape.
"I'm about 95 percent reco
vered. Before the Tulane game
it was aggravated and it was
questionable whether or not
I'd be able to play," Tyler said.
'.'But I'd say I was recovered."
One can't help wondering if
Tyler is prepared to play such a
large role on the team. He's not
sure himself.
"I wondered about that,"
Tyler said. "I really wasn't sure
if I wanted to be in the thick of
things, if I was ready.
"Before the UCLA game I
was really tense, but it wasn't
that bad. My effort was alright,
not great. But I could have
done better," Tyler added.
Steve Dils thinks Tyler is
prepared to play regardless of
his lack of experience.
"It's no problem at all. When
you are as talented as Andre
is," Dils said, "it's no draw
back. He's got a lot to learn of
course, but he's got great
natural instincts and he's doing
a super job.
"If I had to compare him to
someone," Dils continued, "it
would be Tony Hill. He's not as
fast as some on the team but

he's got a real smooth stride.
He's a lot of fun to throw to, he
jumps real well and makes
some tough cuts."
Tyler proved himself last
Saturday when he caught a
pass from Dils to score his first
TD ever for Stanford.
"The play is not designed for
a great big gain, but hopefully I
can break the scene," Tyler
said. "When I caught the pass I
expected to get hit, but I think
the guy was going for the i nter
ception, I think he took a gam
ble. I was lucky enough to
shake him off and I looked up
and there was no one there."
For a while, it looked as if the
Cardinals might have won the
game as a result of Tyler's
score. According to Tyler,
Stanford actually outplayed the
Bruins.
"We went into the game
knowing that it wasn't going to
be a lucky chance if we won,"
Tyler said. "We just got a
couple of bad breaks, a couple
of key calls by the officials that
really hurt us. But I think we
outplayed them."
Though they lost, Tyler was
thrilled to score his first
touchdown, particularly since
no one expected him to start,
least of all himself.
"I planned to play a lot, I
thought I'd eventually get a
chance," Tyler said. "Tony Hill
didn't start until the end of his
junior year. I thought I had a
chance, I expected to contri
bute some. But I didn't think
I'd play that big a role.
Whenever something like this
happens it's bound to be a sur
prise."
One can't help wondering
how the chronic shuffling of
receivers has affected Stan
ford's passing game as a whole.
Dils doesn't think it has.
"It certainly hasn't made it
any easier," Dils said, "but I
don't think it's hurt. They're all
such good athletes. We're just
trying to find a combination
that works."
Tyler doesn't think it has
hurt, either.
"I don't think it's hurt Dils,"
Tyler said. "He's been adjust
ing to it. He's thrown to 10 dif
ferent receivers. He knows the
receivers."
At any rate, Tyler could be
what Stanford is looking for.
According to Walsh, "He's al
ready proven he can play
under pressure. He's just a
very good heads-up ball
player."

Sophomore flanker Andre Tyler sprints down the field unmolested
after catching a Steve Dils pass over the middle. The play was good
for 55 yards and the Cards' last touchdown, but Stanford still came up
one point short.
Andre who? Tyler. The guy
who scored the touchdown in
the third quarter against UCLA.
The guy who's taken Vince
Mulroy's place at flanker as a
sophomore. That's him.
Number 25.
It's very possible that Tyler
could have been facing the
other side of the line last week,
playing for UCLA. Or just as
easily for Oregon State two
weeks from now. Both schools
recruited him from Polytechnic
High School in Long Beach, the
same school that produced
Tony Hill and Gene
Washington, the top two re
ceivers in Stanford history.
He's in good company.
During his high school
career Tyler caught 49 passes
for 1035 yards and 10
touchdowns. He was named
All-City and All-League in his
senior year. He made nine
catches for 149 yards in his best
game and he was also a basket
ball star as well as a three-time
league champ in the high
jump.
He's an economics major
and his career goal is to be
come a business executive. As
a matter of fact he's more seri
ous about his studies than
about his football.
"It takes a lot of effort, a lot
of extra effort," Tyler said.
