# Michael Jackson
## He's an All-American guy 
### RICHARD MARTINEZ 
"You couldn't ask for a bet
ter kid. It's as simple as that.
He's the kind of boy you'd like
to have as a son. His stats and
honors speak for his perform
ing excellence. We'd love to
have 11 of his type on the field
at once."
Who could Skip Hall, assis
tant coach of the Washington
Huskies, be praising so effu
sively? It would have to be a
running back or split end.
Aren't they the glamour boys
of college football? Isn't that
how it's supposed to be written
in the script? Offensive backs
and ends are not only required
to run the 40-yard dash in 4.0
and be as elusive as a greased
pig, but they must also be
well-rounded, humble, intelli
gent and laudable young men.
Skip apologizes for destroy
ing your precognitive notions.
He was describing Michael
Jackson, the All-American out
side linebacker for the Rose
Bowl champs. Imagine saying
such things about a
linebacker!
Aren't they the ruthless vil
lains of the defensive squad?
They're supposed to eat raw
meat, lurk in dark alleys, growl
at reporters, and most impor
tantly try to decapitate any op
ponent entering their territory.
Jackson prefers his meat
medium-rare, thank you. He is
most cordial when interviewed
and even prides himself in his
smooth, efficient manner of
defense rather than sporting
opponents' helmets above his
fireplace.
Jackson, in his senior year,
seems to be a bit extraordinary
in his style as a linebacker.

Whatever he's doing, he's
doing it well, as his honors will
attest.
Last year, he was named to
the AII-Pac-8 team, All-Coast
team, and was named a third
team All-American. He was the
1977 Inland Empire Athlete of
the Year and the UPI National
Defensive Player of the Week
for his performance against the
Cards in last year's 45-21 vic
tory.
Jackson recorded 210 tackles
last season, 111 of which were
unassisted, and he intercepted
four passes.
The communication major is
blessed with an excellent
blend of speed and strength.
He runs a 4.7 40-yard dash and
bench presses 300 pounds.
"The only people who comp
lain about my size," says the
6-foot-%, 226 pounder, "are
the fans. They read about my
height in the program and fi
gure I'm not big enough for my
position. I don't think many
players would support their ar
gument, though."
Coach Hall said, "He really
plays much taller than his
size."
Jackson captains the defense
that ranks first in the Pac-10.
One of the most awesome
statistics of the Huskies' de
fense is their allowance of only
an average of 39.8 yards per
game through the air.
The Huskies shouldn't be
too disappointed if they give
up more than that amount this
Saturday as Steve Difs is averag
ing 24 completions per game,
first in the nation.
"In order for us to success
fully defense Stanford's pas
sing game," sighs Jackson,

"we're going to have to contain
Francis and Nelson. Dils
utilizes his backs well and I be
lieve they head the league in
receptions."
Although the Huskies are
2-3, Jackson has not lost his op
timism.
"We're probably the best 2-3
team in the country. We've lost
our three games by a total of 13
points," Jackson said. "The
regular season is just begin
ning but now every game will
be crucial. We've just come off
a tough loss to Alabama and
you (Stanford) lost a game I feel
you guys should've won, so it
should be quite an intense
game."
Looking ahead towards next
year, Jackson speculates about
his plans for pro football. "Of
course I anticipate a career in
pro ball, but I'm also interested
in broadcasting and business."
Coach Hall adds, "The pros
will definitely be interested in
him. I coached Jack Lambert
when I was at Kent State and he
developed into a super
linebacker for the Steelers. I
feel Mike is a better athlete
than Jack. Lambert was a tre
mendously physical player and
as tough a guy I've ever seen on
the field.
"Mike, however, is a much
more fluid player with excep
tional lateral pursuit. He flows
outside superbly and does a
great job filling up the inside,"
Hall adds.
"But one of Mike's greatest
assets is his intelligence," Hall
said. "He's an excellent stu
dent of the game and he knows

his position well."
Jackson, who also does a
very respectable Muhammad
AM impersonation, has also
been labeled as a very emo
tional player. "I guess it's be
cause I put much concentra
tion on what I'm doing," says
Jackson, "and hate to lose so
much."
This Saturday the Cards
hope Jackson won't put on a
repeat performance of last
year's game that earned him
the UPI Player of the Week
honors. Jackson, on the other
hand, will try to keep the Hus
kies' end zone as clear as his
image. And while Skip Hall
would wish for 11 Michael
Jacksons, the Cards feel one is
more than enough.

6-foot-%, 226 pounder, "are
the fans. They read about my
height in the program and fi
gure I'm not big enough for my
position. I don't think many
players would support their ar
gument, though."
Coach Hall said, "He really
plays much taller than his
size."
Jackson captains the defense
that ranks first in the Pac-10.
One of the most awesome
statistics of the Huskies' de
fense is their allowance of only
an average of 39.8 yards per
game through the air.
The Huskies shouldn't be
too disappointed if they give
up more than that amount this
Saturday as Steve Difs is averag
ing 24 completions per game,
first in the nation.
"In order for us to success
fully defense Stanford's pas
sing game," sighs Jackson,

"we're going to have to contain
Francis and Nelson. Dils
utilizes his backs well and I be
lieve they head the league in
receptions."
Although the Huskies are
2-3, Jackson has not lost his op
timism.
"We're probably the best 2-3
team in the country. We've lost
our three games by a total of 13
points," Jackson said. "The
regular season is just begin
ning but now every game will
be crucial. We've just come off
a tough loss to Alabama and
you (Stanford) lost a game I feel
you guys should've won, so it
should be quite an intense
game."
Looking ahead towards next
year, Jackson speculates about
his plans for pro football. "Of
course I anticipate a career in
pro ball, but I'm also interested
in broadcasting and business."
Coach Hall adds, "The pros
will definitely be interested in
him. I coached Jack Lambert
when I was at Kent State and he
developed into a super
linebacker for the Steelers. I
feel Mike is a better athlete
than Jack. Lambert was a tre
mendously physical player and
as tough a guy I've ever seen on
the field.
"Mike, however, is a much
more fluid player with excep
tional lateral pursuit. He flows
outside superbly and does a
great job filling up the inside,"
Hall adds.
"But one of Mike's greatest
assets is his intelligence," Hall
said. "He's an excellent stu
dent of the game and he knows

his position well."
Jackson, who also does a
very respectable Muhammad
AM impersonation, has also
been labeled as a very emo
tional player. "I guess it's be
cause I put much concentra
tion on what I'm doing," says
Jackson, "and hate to lose so
much."
This Saturday the Cards
hope Jackson won't put on a
repeat performance of last
year's game that earned him
the UPI Player of the Week
honors. Jackson, on the other
hand, will try to keep the Hus
kies' end zone as clear as his
image. And while Skip Hall
would wish for 11 Michael
Jacksons, the Cards feel one is
more than enough.

Husky Senior linebacker, Michael Jackson, who gained distinction
UPI Defensive Player of the Week after meeting tne Cards last year, is
back to exercise his talents again. This year, however, he meets his
opponents on their home turf.
"You couldn't ask for a bet
ter kid. It's as simple as that.
He's the kind of boy you'd like
to have as a son. His stats and
honors speak for his perform
ing excellence. We'd love to
have 11 of his type on the field
at once."
Who could Skip Hall, assis
tant coach of the Washington
Huskies, be praising so effu
sively? It would have to be a
running back or split end.
Aren't they the glamour boys
of college football? Isn't that
how it's supposed to be written
in the script? Offensive backs
and ends are not only required
to run the 40-yard dash in 4.0
and be as elusive as a greased
pig, but they must also be
well-rounded, humble, intelli
gent and laudable young men.
Skip apologizes for destroy
ing your precognitive notions.
He was describing Michael
Jackson, the All-American out
side linebacker for the Rose
Bowl champs. Imagine saying
such things about a
linebacker!
Aren't they the ruthless vil
lains of the defensive squad?
They're supposed to eat raw
meat, lurk in dark alleys, growl
at reporters, and most impor
tantly try to decapitate any op
ponent entering their territory.
Jackson prefers his meat
medium-rare, thank you. He is
most cordial when interviewed
and even prides himself in his
smooth, efficient manner of
defense rather than sporting
opponents' helmets above his
fireplace.
Jackson, in his senior year,
seems to be a bit extraordinary
in his style as a linebacker.

Whatever he's doing, he's
doing it well, as his honors will
attest.
Last year, he was named to
the AII-Pac-8 team, All-Coast
team, and was named a third
team All-American. He was the
1977 Inland Empire Athlete of
the Year and the UPI National
Defensive Player of the Week
for his performance against the
Cards in last year's 45-21 vic
tory.
Jackson recorded 210 tackles
last season, 111 of which were
unassisted, and he intercepted
four passes.
The communication major is
blessed with an excellent
blend of speed and strength.
He runs a 4.7 40-yard dash and
bench presses 300 pounds.
"The only people who comp
lain about my size," says the
6-foot-%, 226 pounder, "are
the fans. They read about my

AM impersonation, has also
been labeled as a very emo
tional player. "I guess it's be
cause I put much concentra
tion on what I'm doing," says
Jackson, "and hate to lose so
much."
This Saturday the Cards
hope Jackson won't put on a
repeat performance of last
year's game that earned him
the UPI Player of the Week
honors. Jackson, on the other
hand, will try to keep the Hus
kies' end zone as clear as his
image. And while Skip Hall
would wish for 11 Michael
Jacksons, the Cards feel one is
more than enough.

Husky Senior linebacker, Michael Jackson, who gained distinction
UPI Defensive Player of the Week after meeting tne Cards last year, is
back to exercise his talents again. This year, however, he meets his
opponents on their home turf.
"You couldn't ask for a bet
ter kid. It's as simple as that.
He's the kind of boy you'd like
to have as a son. His stats and
honors speak for his perform
ing excellence. We'd love to
have 11 of his type on the field
at once."
Who could Skip Hall, assis
tant coach of the Washington
Huskies, be praising so effu
sively? It would have to be a
running back or split end.
Aren't they the glamour boys
of college football? Isn't that
how it's supposed to be written
in the script? Offensive backs
and ends are not only required
to run the 40-yard dash in 4.0
and be as elusive as a greased
pig, but they must also be
well-rounded, humble, intelli
gent and laudable young men.
Skip apologizes for destroy
ing your precognitive notions.
He was describing Michael
Jackson, the All-American out
side linebacker for the Rose
Bowl champs. Imagine saying
such things about a
linebacker!
Aren't they the ruthless vil
lains of the defensive squad?
They're supposed to eat raw
meat, lurk in dark alleys, growl
at reporters, and most impor
tantly try to decapitate any op
ponent entering their territory.
Jackson prefers his meat
medium-rare, thank you. He is
most cordial when interviewed
and even prides himself in his
smooth, efficient manner of
defense rather than sporting
opponents' helmets above his
fireplace.
Jackson, in his senior year,
seems to be a bit extraordinary
in his style as a linebacker.

Whatever he's doing, he's
doing it well, as his honors will
attest.
Last year, he was named to
the AII-Pac-8 team, All-Coast
team, and was named a third
team All-American. He was the
1977 Inland Empire Athlete of
the Year and the UPI National
Defensive Player of the Week
for his performance against the
Cards in last year's 45-21 vic
tory.
Jackson recorded 210 tackles
last season, 111 of which were
unassisted, and he intercepted
four passes.
The communication major is
blessed with an excellent
blend of speed and strength.
He runs a 4.7 40-yard dash and
bench presses 300 pounds.
"The only people who comp
lain about my size," says the
6-foot-%, 226 pounder, "are
the fans. They read about my
height in the program and fi
gure I'm not big enough for my
position. I don't think many
players would support their ar
gument, though."
Coach Hall said, "He really
plays much taller than his
size."
Jackson captains the defense
that ranks first in the Pac-10.
One of the most awesome
statistics of the Huskies' de
fense is their allowance of only
an average of 39.8 yards per
game through the air.
The Huskies shouldn't be
too disappointed if they give
up more than that amount this
Saturday as Steve Difs is averag
ing 24 completions per game,
first in the nation.
"In order for us to success
fully defense Stanford's pas
sing game," sighs Jackson,

"we're going to have to contain
Francis and Nelson. Dils
utilizes his backs well and I be
lieve they head the league in
receptions."
Although the Huskies are
2-3, Jackson has not lost his op
timism.
"We're probably the best 2-3
team in the country. We've lost
our three games by a total of 13
points," Jackson said. "The
regular season is just begin
ning but now every game will
be crucial. We've just come off
a tough loss to Alabama and
you (Stanford) lost a game I feel
you guys should've won, so it
should be quite an intense
game."
Looking ahead towards next
year, Jackson speculates about
his plans for pro football. "Of
course I anticipate a career in
pro ball, but I'm also interested
in broadcasting and business."
Coach Hall adds, "The pros
will definitely be interested in
him. I coached Jack Lambert
when I was at Kent State and he
developed into a super
linebacker for the Steelers. I
feel Mike is a better athlete
than Jack. Lambert was a tre
mendously physical player and
as tough a guy I've ever seen on
the field.
"Mike, however, is a much
more fluid player with excep
tional lateral pursuit. He flows
outside superbly and does a
great job filling up the inside,"
Hall adds.
"But one of Mike's greatest
assets is his intelligence," Hall
said. "He's an excellent stu
dent of the game and he knows

his position well."
Jackson, who also does a
very respectable Muhammad
AM impersonation, has also
been labeled as a very emo
tional player. "I guess it's be
cause I put much concentra
tion on what I'm doing," says
Jackson, "and hate to lose so
