# Some watch while others play: the frustration of Kevin McCracken
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
The glory of being a heavily
recruited high school senior
usually vanishes in the first
pre-season practice when all
conference or all-state prep
players are pitted against All-
American college stars. With a
year of college experience, the
jl confidence is usually re
established, though, and by
the time the next batch of
freshmen find their way to the
practice field, a new group of
stars have secured a place in
black and white on the football
roster.
Usually.
The only roster on which
Kevin McCracken's name ap
pears is the Cardinal injury list
where the sophomore has
spent the last year and is ex
pected to spend this season.
| Undergoing the first of three
knee operations upon his
graduation from high school,
McCracken has spent more
time in the Stanford training
room than on the field or
anywhere else, for that matter.
Recruited heavily upon his
graduation from St. Francis
High School in La Canada, the
quarterback has not seen one
minute of play for the Cards.
And McCracken is the first to
admit that the future does not
look bright.
"Until this year I went to
every meeting," said McCrac
*ken. "I still go to practice and
Hearn as much as I can but to get
the offense, you really have to
do it."
McCracken doesn't have the
opportunity to do it. All he can
do is watch.
"It's the most frustrating
thing in the world," he said.
"Every time I see a game I'm so
close to the guys on the team
and the playing that it really
hurts me inside. I had to watch
the Oklahoma game from the
stands," he added with a pain

ful expression on his face. "It
was like a claustraphobic ef
fect. I wanted to run out there.
It's not like I'm too old. My
mind is still healthy, but if you
don't have the wheels, you
can't move."
McCracken does a pretty
good job of getting around,
though. He uses one of the
electric carts to get from the
trailers to his classes. For some
mysterious reason, the cart is
incapacitated at the time, but
McCracken just received the
OK to start walking around,
which he manages with some
difficulty. He's not one to over
look the advantages of his situ
ation, though, and was quick
to demonstrate the usefulness
of his cane.
"See," he said lying on his
back in bed. "You can reach
over and turn the light off
without getting out of bed."
That good-natured attitude
is characteristic of the way
McCracken views his situation
now. He's realistic and has
turned his focus more to
academics. He's an economics
major working toward an even
tual MBA. But it hasn't always
been like that.
After the first operation,
McCracken worked out at
Stanford, his knee becoming
progressively worse. The next
surgery he underwent was a
total knee reconstruction and
by spring of last year he had
rehabilitated to the point
where he could play easily.
"I'd go into the training
room at least twice a day be
fore and after practice,"
McCracken said. "It's really
time-consuming. With train
ing, practice and meetings, I
was spending seven or eight
hours a day just on football."
To McCracken it was worth
getting in shape because he
vowed he'd never go through it
again.

After one week of spring
training, the knee was twisted
the wrong way. Originally
diagnosed as a tear in the scar
tissue, McCracken stayed at
Stanford to work out instead of
going home to Southern
California.
"By mid-July I couldn't run
my knee was swollen so badly.
When it got to that point, I
knew I had no choice."
Surgery No. 3 was just "one
more" for the side-lined QB.
But it was still a sobering ex
perience.
"The first operation really
depressed me," said McCrac
ken. "I had just gotten home
from the hospital when the
UCLA coach called me up and
told me he couldn't offer me a
scholarship. I saw Donahue at
the UCLA game last weekend
when I was in a cast. I guess he
was right."
McCracken is understanding
of a coach's position, though.
"It's tough to coach me," he
said, "because they're not sure
if I'll be able to produce. They
can train me to be the best QB
there is but if it's only for one
game, it's a waste. It makes me
feel really low, but I've grown
to accept it. At first it made me
try harder, but after you get
hurt again and again it's hard to
maintain the same intensity."
No matter what motivation
McCracken lacks though, he
has little fear of losing his scho
larship. As long as he's still elig
ible to play, according to NCAA
regulations, it will not be re
tracted simply because he's in
jured.
"The best psychological
compensation 1 have is that I
still have a lot of time,"
McCracken said. "But I don't
want to graduate when I'm 25
although if it comes up," he
added, "I'd consider taking

another quarter."
McCracken got up and
down, fidgeted, limped
around and pointed every
which way with his cane.
"Someone gave me this in high
school," he said proudly. He's
gotten a lot of use out of it. The
blond, good-natured gridder is
sympathetic to the effect his in
juries have on the people he is
close to.
"I think it hurts my parents
more than it hurts me to go
through these operations," he
said. "And I feel bad that my

little brother has to see me like
this." He pointed with his cane
to his brother's signature on
the cast: "I hope this is the last
time." Undeniably, McCrac
ken does too. But he's realistic
about the performance he will
be able to give once he gets
back on the field.
"Sometimes I'll roll over in
bed," he said, "and my knee
will go out. How can I expect to
take a blow from a linebacker
and remain intact if it goes out
when I roll over in bed?"

The disadvantages of being
an injured quarterback rather
than a guard or linebacker are
familiar to the 6-foot-3 192-
pounder.
"Last year instead of concen
trating on reading the defense,
t was thinking about my knee
instead. You bring the whole
performance of the team down
that way."
McCracken understands
that a win can't be sacrificed for
an individual. But he's coping.
He didn't go to the Sun Bowl in

El Paso and has overcome that
disappointment. He has an ex
tensive list of responses to the
question 'How's your knee?'
and through the pain of being
so close and yet so distant from
the game, he is still quite
adamant about trying to get
back into it.
"I can't get football out of my
head," he said with a mixture
of frustration and determina

pected to spend this season.
| Undergoing the first of three
knee operations upon his
graduation from high school,
McCracken has spent more
time in the Stanford training
room than on the field or
anywhere else, for that matter.
Recruited heavily upon his
graduation from St. Francis
High School in La Canada, the
quarterback has not seen one
minute of play for the Cards.
And McCracken is the first to
admit that the future does not
look bright.
"Until this year I went to
every meeting," said McCrac
*ken. "I still go to practice and
Hearn as much as I can but to get
the offense, you really have to
do it."
McCracken doesn't have the
opportunity to do it. All he can
do is watch.
"It's the most frustrating
thing in the world," he said.
"Every time I see a game I'm so
close to the guys on the team
and the playing that it really
hurts me inside. I had to watch
the Oklahoma game from the
stands," he added with a pain

ful expression on his face. "It
was like a claustraphobic ef
fect. I wanted to run out there.
It's not like I'm too old. My
mind is still healthy, but if you
don't have the wheels, you
can't move."
McCracken does a pretty
good job of getting around,
though. He uses one of the
electric carts to get from the
trailers to his classes. For some
mysterious reason, the cart is
incapacitated at the time, but
McCracken just received the
OK to start walking around,
which he manages with some
difficulty. He's not one to over
look the advantages of his situ
ation, though, and was quick
to demonstrate the usefulness
of his cane.
"See," he said lying on his
back in bed. "You can reach
over and turn the light off
without getting out of bed."
That good-natured attitude
is characteristic of the way
McCracken views his situation
now. He's realistic and has
turned his focus more to
academics. He's an economics
major working toward an even
tual MBA. But it hasn't always
been like that.
After the first operation,
McCracken worked out at
Stanford, his knee becoming
progressively worse. The next
surgery he underwent was a
total knee reconstruction and
by spring of last year he had
rehabilitated to the point
where he could play easily.
"I'd go into the training
room at least twice a day be
fore and after practice,"
McCracken said. "It's really
time-consuming. With train
ing, practice and meetings, I
was spending seven or eight
hours a day just on football."
To McCracken it was worth
getting in shape because he
vowed he'd never go through it
again.

After one week of spring
training, the knee was twisted
the wrong way. Originally
diagnosed as a tear in the scar
tissue, McCracken stayed at
Stanford to work out instead of
going home to Southern
California.
"By mid-July I couldn't run
my knee was swollen so badly.
When it got to that point, I
knew I had no choice."
Surgery No. 3 was just "one
more" for the side-lined QB.
But it was still a sobering ex
perience.
"The first operation really
depressed me," said McCrac
ken. "I had just gotten home
from the hospital when the
UCLA coach called me up and
told me he couldn't offer me a
scholarship. I saw Donahue at
the UCLA game last weekend
when I was in a cast. I guess he
was right."
McCracken is understanding
of a coach's position, though.
"It's tough to coach me," he
said, "because they're not sure
if I'll be able to produce. They
can train me to be the best QB
there is but if it's only for one
game, it's a waste. It makes me
feel really low, but I've grown
to accept it. At first it made me
try harder, but after you get
hurt again and again it's hard to
maintain the same intensity."
No matter what motivation
McCracken lacks though, he
has little fear of losing his scho
larship. As long as he's still elig
ible to play, according to NCAA
regulations, it will not be re
tracted simply because he's in
jured.
"The best psychological
compensation 1 have is that I
still have a lot of time,"
McCracken said. "But I don't
want to graduate when I'm 25
although if it comes up," he
added, "I'd consider taking

another quarter."
McCracken got up and
down, fidgeted, limped
around and pointed every
which way with his cane.
"Someone gave me this in high
school," he said proudly. He's
gotten a lot of use out of it. The
blond, good-natured gridder is
sympathetic to the effect his in
juries have on the people he is
close to.
"I think it hurts my parents
more than it hurts me to go
through these operations," he
said. "And I feel bad that my

little brother has to see me like
this." He pointed with his cane
to his brother's signature on
the cast: "I hope this is the last
time." Undeniably, McCrac
ken does too. But he's realistic
about the performance he will
be able to give once he gets
back on the field.
"Sometimes I'll roll over in
bed," he said, "and my knee
will go out. How can I expect to
take a blow from a linebacker
and remain intact if it goes out
when I roll over in bed?"

The disadvantages of being
an injured quarterback rather
than a guard or linebacker are
familiar to the 6-foot-3 192-
pounder.
"Last year instead of concen
trating on reading the defense,
t was thinking about my knee
instead. You bring the whole
performance of the team down
that way."
McCracken understands
that a win can't be sacrificed for
an individual. But he's coping.
He didn't go to the Sun Bowl in

El Paso and has overcome that
disappointment. He has an ex
tensive list of responses to the
question 'How's your knee?'
and through the pain of being
so close and yet so distant from
the game, he is still quite
adamant about trying to get
back into it.
"I can't get football out of my
head," he said with a mixture
of frustration and determina
tion showing on his face, a little
of the high school glory re
maining in his pride. "It just
ended before it was time."
The glory of being a heavily
recruited high school senior
usually vanishes in the first
pre-season practice when all
conference or all-state prep
players are pitted against All-
American college stars. With a
year of college experience, the
jl confidence is usually re
established, though, and by
the time the next batch of
freshmen find their way to the
practice field, a new group of
stars have secured a place in
black and white on the football
roster.

McCracken doesn't have the
opportunity to do it. All he can
do is watch.
"It's the most frustrating
thing in the world," he said.
"Every time I see a game I'm so
close to the guys on the team
and the playing that it really
hurts me inside. I had to watch
the Oklahoma game from the
stands," he added with a pain

ful expression on his face. "It
was like a claustraphobic ef
fect. I wanted to run out there.
It's not like I'm too old. My
mind is still healthy, but if you
don't have the wheels, you
can't move."
McCracken does a pretty
good job of getting around,
though. He uses one of the
electric carts to get from the
trailers to his classes. For some
mysterious reason, the cart is
incapacitated at the time, but
McCracken just received the
OK to start walking around,
which he manages with some
difficulty. He's not one to over
look the advantages of his situ
ation, though, and was quick
to demonstrate the usefulness
of his cane.
"See," he said lying on his
back in bed. "You can reach
over and turn the light off
without getting out of bed."
That good-natured attitude
is characteristic of the way
McCracken views his situation
now. He's realistic and has
turned his focus more to
academics. He's an economics
major working toward an even
tual MBA. But it hasn't always
been like that.
After the first operation,
McCracken worked out at
Stanford, his knee becoming
progressively worse. The next
surgery he underwent was a
total knee reconstruction and
by spring of last year he had
rehabilitated to the point
where he could play easily.
"I'd go into the training
room at least twice a day be
fore and after practice,"
McCracken said. "It's really
time-consuming. With train
ing, practice and meetings, I
was spending seven or eight
hours a day just on football."
To McCracken it was worth
getting in shape because he
vowed he'd never go through it
again.

After one week of spring
training, the knee was twisted
the wrong way. Originally
diagnosed as a tear in the scar
tissue, McCracken stayed at
Stanford to work out instead of
going home to Southern
California.
"By mid-July I couldn't run
my knee was swollen so badly.
When it got to that point, I
knew I had no choice."
Surgery No. 3 was just "one
more" for the side-lined QB.
But it was still a sobering ex
perience.
"The first operation really
depressed me," said McCrac
ken. "I had just gotten home
from the hospital when the
UCLA coach called me up and
told me he couldn't offer me a
scholarship. I saw Donahue at
the UCLA game last weekend
when I was in a cast. I guess he
was right."
McCracken is understanding
of a coach's position, though.
"It's tough to coach me," he
said, "because they're not sure
if I'll be able to produce. They
can train me to be the best QB
there is but if it's only for one
game, it's a waste. It makes me
feel really low, but I've grown
to accept it. At first it made me
try harder, but after you get
hurt again and again it's hard to
maintain the same intensity."
No matter what motivation
McCracken lacks though, he
has little fear of losing his scho
larship. As long as he's still elig
ible to play, according to NCAA
regulations, it will not be re
tracted simply because he's in
jured.
"The best psychological
compensation 1 have is that I
still have a lot of time,"
McCracken said. "But I don't
want to graduate when I'm 25
although if it comes up," he
added, "I'd consider taking

around and pointed every

sympathetic to the effect his in
juries have on the people he is
close to.

more than it hurts me to go

said. "And I feel bad that my

little brother has to see me like

to his brother's signature on

ken does too. But he's realistic
about the performance he will
be able to give once he gets
back on the field.

will go out. How can I expect to
take a blow from a linebacker

El Paso and has overcome that
disappointment. He has an ex
tensive list of responses to the
question 'How's your knee?'
and through the pain of being
so close and yet so distant from
the game, he is still quite
adamant about trying to get
back into it.

good job of getting around,
though. He uses one of the
electric carts to get from the
trailers to his classes. For some
mysterious reason, the cart is
incapacitated at the time, but
McCracken just received the
OK to start walking around,
which he manages with some
difficulty. He's not one to over
look the advantages of his situ
ation, though, and was quick
to demonstrate the usefulness
of his cane.
"See," he said lying on his
back in bed. "You can reach
over and turn the light off
without getting out of bed."
That good-natured attitude
is characteristic of the way
McCracken views his situation
now. He's realistic and has
turned his focus more to
academics. He's an economics
major working toward an even
tual MBA. But it hasn't always
been like that.
After the first operation,
McCracken worked out at
Stanford, his knee becoming
progressively worse. The next
surgery he underwent was a
total knee reconstruction and
by spring of last year he had
rehabilitated to the point
where he could play easily.
"I'd go into the training
room at least twice a day be
fore and after practice,"
McCracken said. "It's really
time-consuming. With train
ing, practice and meetings, I
was spending seven or eight
hours a day just on football."
To McCracken it was worth
getting in shape because he
vowed he'd never go through it
again.

After one week of spring
training, the knee was twisted
the wrong way. Originally
diagnosed as a tear in the scar
tissue, McCracken stayed at
Stanford to work out instead of
going home to Southern
California.
"By mid-July I couldn't run
my knee was swollen so badly.
When it got to that point, I
knew I had no choice."
Surgery No. 3 was just "one
more" for the side-lined QB.
But it was still a sobering ex
perience.
"The first operation really
depressed me," said McCrac
ken. "I had just gotten home
from the hospital when the
UCLA coach called me up and
told me he couldn't offer me a
scholarship. I saw Donahue at
the UCLA game last weekend
when I was in a cast. I guess he
was right."
McCracken is understanding
of a coach's position, though.
"It's tough to coach me," he
said, "because they're not sure
if I'll be able to produce. They
can train me to be the best QB
there is but if it's only for one
game, it's a waste. It makes me
feel really low, but I've grown
to accept it. At first it made me
try harder, but after you get
hurt again and again it's hard to
maintain the same intensity."
No matter what motivation
McCracken lacks though, he
has little fear of losing his scho
larship. As long as he's still elig
ible to play, according to NCAA
regulations, it will not be re
tracted simply because he's in
jured.
"The best psychological
compensation 1 have is that I
still have a lot of time,"
McCracken said. "But I don't
want to graduate when I'm 25
although if it comes up," he
added, "I'd consider taking

at the earliest.
another quarter."
McCracken got up and
down, fidgeted, limped
around and pointed every
which way with his cane.
"Someone gave me this in high
school," he said proudly. He's
gotten a lot of use out of it. The
blond, good-natured gridder is
sympathetic to the effect his in
juries have on the people he is
close to.
"I think it hurts my parents
more than it hurts me to go
through these operations," he
said. "And I feel bad that my

little brother has to see me like
this." He pointed with his cane
to his brother's signature on
the cast: "I hope this is the last
time." Undeniably, McCrac
ken does too. But he's realistic
about the performance he will
be able to give once he gets
back on the field.
"Sometimes I'll roll over in
bed," he said, "and my knee
will go out. How can I expect to
take a blow from a linebacker
and remain intact if it goes out
when I roll over in bed?"

The disadvantages of being
an injured quarterback rather
than a guard or linebacker are
familiar to the 6-foot-3 192-
pounder.
"Last year instead of concen
trating on reading the defense,
t was thinking about my knee
instead. You bring the whole
performance of the team down
that way."
McCracken understands
that a win can't be sacrificed for
an individual. But he's coping.
He didn't go to the Sun Bowl in

El Paso and has overcome that
disappointment. He has an ex
tensive list of responses to the
question 'How's your knee?'
and through the pain of being
so close and yet so distant from
the game, he is still quite
adamant about trying to get
back into it.
"I can't get football out of my
head," he said with a mixture
of frustration and determina
tion showing on his face, a little
of the high school glory re
maining in his pride. "It just
ended before it was time."
The glory of being a heavily
recruited high school senior
usually vanishes in the first
pre-season practice when all
conference or all-state prep
players are pitted against All-
American college stars. With a
year of college experience, the
jl confidence is usually re
established, though, and by
the time the next batch of
freshmen find their way to the
practice field, a new group of
stars have secured a place in
black and white on the football
roster.
Usually.
The only roster on which
Kevin McCracken's name ap
pears is the Cardinal injury list
where the sophomore has
spent the last year and is ex
pected to spend this season.
| Undergoing the first of three
knee operations upon his
graduation from high school,
McCracken has spent more
time in the Stanford training
room than on the field or
anywhere else, for that matter.
Recruited heavily upon his
graduation from St. Francis
High School in La Canada, the
quarterback has not seen one
minute of play for the Cards.
And McCracken is the first to
admit that the future does not
look bright.
"Until this year I went to
every meeting," said McCrac
*ken. "I still go to practice and
Hearn as much as I can but to get
the offense, you really have to
do it."
McCracken doesn't have the
opportunity to do it. All he can
do is watch.
"It's the most frustrating
thing in the world," he said.
"Every time I see a game I'm so
close to the guys on the team
and the playing that it really
hurts me inside. I had to watch
the Oklahoma game from the
stands," he added with a pain

ful expression on his face. "It
was like a claustraphobic ef
fect. I wanted to run out there.
It's not like I'm too old. My
mind is still healthy, but if you
don't have the wheels, you
can't move."
