# Stanford's fourth
## New AD Geiger promises visible administration 
### IVAN MAISEL 
Stating that he will be a "visi
ble, student-oriented adminis
trator," Stanford's newly
appointed athletic director
Andy Geiger spoke before a
group of Bay Area reporters
this week.
"The hallmark of athletics is
enthusiasm," Geiger said. "My
style will be visible, energetic
and enthusiastic."
Geiger is coming to the Farm
from the University of Pennsyl
vania, where he has served as
AD for four years. Prior to that,
Geiger was AD for three years
at Brown University and was
assistant AD at his alma mater,
Syracuse, for six years. ,
"Stanford combines the best
in the academics and athle
tics," Geiger said, adding that
he thinks "The Pacific-10 rep
resents integrity in sports."
According to Geiger, Penn's
program is quite similar to
Stanford's.
"The major difference bet
ween Penn and Stanford is that
there are no grant-in-aid scho
larships at Penn. We had no
special financial aid for our
athletes. They went through
the same program as the other
students."
One problem that might
arise when changing from the
Ivy League to the Pac-10 is the
vast difference in the two con
ferences' emphasis on foot
ball. The Ivy League has not
been on the same level as the
Pac-10 schools for two de
jcades.
Coming from the Ivy League
would seem to limit Geiger's
access to a big college football
program. However, Geiger's
position at Syracuse showed
him how the big boys play.
"During my tenure at Syra
cuse, we had Floyd Little, Larry
Csonka, and went to both the
Gator and the Sugar Bowl, so
this level of play is not totally
foreign to me."
Qne of the aspects of

Geiger's background that im
pressed the University is his in
volvement in the administra
tive committees of the NCAA.
Geiger is currently on the
Government Relations Com
mittee, which has recently
looked into anti-gambling
measures, the Division I Bas
ketball Tournament Commit
tee, which, among other
things, picks the at-large teams <
for the year-end championship
tournament, and serves as
Chairman of the Metric Con
version Committee, a commit
tee which Geiger admits "will
never meet if I have anything to
do with it."
One proposal whch comes
up year after year at the NCAA
meetings is that of a "Super
Conference" for Division I
football. The proposal, spon
sored by several of the major
conferences (excluding the
Pac-10), would determine (
NCAA standing by stadium size
and average attendance at
football games.
The reiasoning behind that
the proposal is so the big
schools would be able to keep
the large amount of television
monies they receive to them
selves and hence, not support
the weak sisters of Division I
football, like the Ivy League.
Geiger is opposed to the
proposal, calling it "elitism for
the wrong reasons." Geiger
sponsored the Ivy Amend
ment, which blocked the
Super Conference proposal by {
providing a loophole so that
any school with twelve or more
varsity sports could remain in
Division I, regardless of any
other criteria.
Speaking for himself and his
new employees, Geiger said,
"Stanford University has felt
that great institutions ought to
get together on philosophical
grounds, not on stadium and
crowd size.
Calling Stanford "as big a
challenge as there is available
in my field," Geiger is also pre
paring for a personal adven-|
ture.
"Philadelphia is as far west as
I've ever lived. This is the first
time I'll have ever been out
here," Geiger said.
Among the many welcomes
handed out to Geiger and his
wife Eleanor was one by those
renowned makers of musical
merriment, the LSJUMB.
Dave Ford, leader of the
band: "Say hello to Andy."
Band: "Hellllllloooo,
Andy!" "
FORD: "Band, what do we
think about Andy?"
Band: "Sooooome shit!"
Geiger wants to devote as
much attention to the non
athlete as to the athlete.
"The bottom line of any ath
letic program is the value and
quality for the students par
ticipating," Geiger said. My
basic definition of success is -
for students to achieve every- *
thing they can."

Andy Geiger, Stanford's fourth athletic director, is shown here answering
questions at a press conference in San Francisco earlier this week.
Geiger, who takes office January 1, smiled when one reporter noted that

he may want nothing better than to spend his first day on the job in
Pasadena watching his new team play.
