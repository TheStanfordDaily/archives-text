# Psyching: different strokes for different folks

### PETER FINCH 
Crash! An immense Stanford
lineman smashes into a sled at
Angell Field, sending it reeling
backwards. Everyone knows he
is there. He's there everyday of
the week. People almost tend to
take it for granted.
And fans also know that
fleet-footed backs and receiv
ers run endless windsprints and
stretch their muscles in posi
tions we never thought possi
ble. Everyone has seen them.
And of course the quarter
backs rifle pass after pass after
pass in hopes that when game
time rolls around, they will
never miss their target.
Sure...fans see them every
Saturday while they wait for the
LSJUMB to start their pre-game
show.
Well, how does a football
player prepare himself for a
game when physically he can
practice no more?
Steve Dils, Stanford's starting
quarterback, has established a
routine which he follows before
games. "I try to do the same
thing every week," Dils
explained. "By the time Friday
rolls around my mental prep
aration is basically taken care
of. We'll go to Rickey's for din
ner and then out to a movie.
Friday night I might go over the
game plan with Turk Schonert
(back-up quarterback) to make
sure everything is straight. I try
not to think about it (the game)
too much. I try to relax and get a
good night's sleep.
"On Saturday I'm very re
laxed. I wake up and thnk about
the game only when it comes
time to get dressed for the
game, I try to go through a
ritual. You know, I put my socks
on the same way each week,
and make sure everything is the
same."
And what would happen if
everything wasn't the same?
"The only game like that was
the San Jose game," Dils recal
led. "I wasn't going through the
ritual. We didn't sleep at Ric
key's like we usually do, so I

slept at home. My teammates
weren't around and things just
weren't the same. I had to go
over to the sidelines and get my
concentration back early in the
game. As you might remember,
we started off pretty badly. I
hope that I can avoid starting off
like that again."
Dils said he doesn't consider
himself a nervous person, but
he added that he does have to
work at staying relaxed before
games.
"If I'm too tight, I'm in trou
ble. But if I'm too relaxed, I'm
also in trouble," he explained.
"There's a fine line between the
two. I'd like to feel the same
way each weekend."
One might wonder how the
crowd affects the players when
they are getting ready for the
game. Dils, like most players,
said he enjoys playing in front
of a large crowd.
"Yes, I do like a large crowd,"
he said. "And it's good for the
other guys on the team, too. It's
frustrating when you run a
couple of plays and it's so quiet.
It's kind of like a scrimmage
sometimes. The fans are great,
though," he added. "It's very
exciting to play for a big group
of people. It really pumps me
up."
Dils obviously takes each
game seriously, but some
games are plainly more crucial
than others. Is it possible to
treat each game as being
equally important?
"Well," Dils said, "I spent
more time getting ready for Ok
lahoma than I did for San Jose,
but I never go in unprepared.
I'd like to say I go in equally
prepared for each game, but
you can't really because each
game is so different. I'm just
never unprepared, that's all."
Ken Margerum, Stanford's
sophomore receiver, finds him
self tense by Wednesday. "I
have to start finding things to do
to relax," he says. "Usually I go
over to Steve Dils' and we go
over the plays. I get so tense I'll
come home and listen to some

music and try to forget about
the game so I can get to sleep."
Margerum, too has a peculiar
Saturday morning ritual.
"I wear four socks and I al
ways put them on inside out, "
he said. "And before each game
I say abouta3o-second prayer. I
pray to God that nobody gets
hurt and that we win."
The crowd doesn't seem to

effect Margerum as much as it
does others.
"It's just like us against the
other 11 guys to me. But when I
caught the winning touchdown
against Tulane, then I heard the
crowd," he said.
More often, he said he
notices the LSJUMB.
"Running out onto the field

with the band playing 'All Right
Now' is like a natural high, he
said. "It really pumps me up. I
feel like I'm about four feet off
the ground."
A receiver who runs his pat
terns four feet off the ground
would be a great asset to a foot
ball tern. So is Ken Margerum.

The Stanford Cardinals break out of the locker room and charge out onto the field. Each man psyches up in his
own way, yet the team comes together as a unit when the game gets under way.
