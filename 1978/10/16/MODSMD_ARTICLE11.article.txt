# Students seek full moon thrills tonight
## 
### RICHARD MARTINEZ 
Sorry, Howard Cosell, Mon
day Night Football will have to
take second stage to a more
important sporting event here
this evening. It seems that
more than just the astronomy
majors have been studying the
moon's progress with anticipa
tion. Much to the delight of
many lustful senior males, the
lunar surface will finally be en
tirely visible. In other words,
there will be a full moon out
tonight! A "Stanford girl" can
become a "Stanford woman" if
kissed by a senior male in the
middle of the Quad.
Some tend to take this un
ique tradition of "womaniz
ing" a bit more seriously than

others. Senior Thomas Moore
postulates, "I feel this is a fine
tradition, and it epitomizes the
true spirit of Stanford. I feel,
though, that it should take
more than a little kiss to make a
girl a Stanford woman."
Carib Nelson, on the other
hand, has not let his three pre
vious lean years get the best of
his passions. "Sure its great to
be a senior, accruing the
privileges that come with the
rank. But the full moon tradi
tion is just a lot of fun. Besides,
I don't feel as though I'm just
doing this for myself," Nelson
chuckled. "I'm bestowing an
honor upon some lucky girl by
making her an official Stanford
woman."

Among a myriad of re
sponses, a surprising number
of freshmen didn't even know
about the custom. When asked
if Oct. 16, 1978, meant any
thing, some frosh "girls" re
sponded:
"Isn't that the real Columbus
Day?"
"Won't there be a lunar ec
lipse or something?"
"It's the day before my damn
calculus midterm."
Not all freshmen are as inno
cent and naive as the preced
ing thoughts would attest.
Quite a few first-year "girls"
know exactly what's in store. A
particularly cognitive fresh
woman responded, "Of
course I know what's going on.

It's when a Stanford senior kis
ses a girl under a full moon in
the middle of the Quad at the
stroke of midnight. I'm aware
only because I think I'm going
to be stuck going with some
turkey from Delta Upsilon."
Claire Van Schlack, another
"froshgirl," was so enthused
about the idea that she volun
teered her address and phone
number for reference.
Phone numbers weren't
published in past decades but
the "kissing custom" was just
as popular. Bob Hamrdla, as
sistant to President Richard
Lyman, graduated from the
University in 1960. He recalls
an interesting antecdote. "We
enjoyed the custom so much
that when my three buddies
and I attended Stanford in
Germany, we transferred the
tradition as well. We desig
nated our own little Quad and
made some lucky girls Stanford
women on foreign soil."
Elizabeth Meyer, director of
the Academic Information
Center and assistant dean of
Undergraduate Studies adds,
"Our class (class of 1970) was in
a very transitional time period,
and the tradition lost a little of
its momentum during this
time. There was, though, more
pre-arrangement about who

one was going with to the
Quad. You didn't just go with
anybody. One also had to be
ware of the balloon throwers
hiding in the Quad."
For those interested in re
cords and statistics, the longest
recorded and witnessed kiss
took place on May 29, 1978,
when juniors John Fess and
Lucia Manning made their
claim to fame with a 35-minute
kiss. Fess attributes his success
to his romantic nature and
competitive spirit, while Man
ning said the only thing that
kept her going was love. "It
wasn't all fun," stated Fess.
"Our faces were thoroughly
chapped and our mouths suffi
ciently exhausted." Fess and
Manning are engaged to be
married.
There you have it — a bit of
an education on one of the
mores of the University.
In these times of equal rights
and anti-discrimination legisla
tion, it seems strange that this
practice should seclude such a
large portion of the student
body, the underclassmen. For
that matter, why shouldn't
senior women be given the
privilege to bestow such an
honor upon the younger male
"boys?" It's food for thought.

It's 20 years since this picture was snapped. Though the attire has changed, the custom has not. Tonight,
the tradition continues. Males will be turning that naive "Stanford girl" into a proud "Stanford woman."
