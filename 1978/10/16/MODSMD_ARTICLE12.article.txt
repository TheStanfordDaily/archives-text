## Editorial CRAP just a start 
### 
Student government remains fully
intact, following Friday's election re
turns, but that does not mean the
end to serious reform of ASSU poli
tics. The failure of a constitutional
amendment abolishing the senate
must be the first step toward a more
responsive senate.
The Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politicos' (CRAP) amendment served
a useful purpose in bringing to de
bate the value of student govern
ment at Stanford.
However, a majority of student
voters were correct in leaving the se
nate intact. The senate offers the
necessary checks and balances over
the Council of Presidents, and if op
erated efficiently, the senate can be
an effective voice here.
An efficient senate can only be
come a reality through reform of
both the election process and of the
operational aspects of the senate it
self. And serious discussion and ac
tion regarding reform possibilities
must begin immediately by the new
senators if respect in the Stanford
community is ever to be regained.
Past experience proves the pre
sent senate structure hinders an ef
fective operation. Although close to
a 60 percent majority voted for keep

ing a student senate, common sense
indicates dissatisfaction among
these voters. Most voting against
CRAP were voting for the need of a
student senate, but not necessarily
in its present form.
The first task at hand is for the new
senators to organize themselves in
an efficient and effective manner if
the senate is to regain the respect it
has lost in past years.
Senators must not be afraid to
compromise. All are elected at-large,
and therefore represent all Univer
sity students, not any special interest
groups. Work with each other, and
avoid the useless nit-picking that has
plagued the senate over the past few
years.
And then get down to serious re
form. Consider the Elections Review
Board's report as well as staggered
elections, abolition of slates and dis
tricting.
If the steps to reform are taken
immediately, then hopes for a re
spected student senate will return.
However, if this year's senate refuses
to act, it would not be surprising to
see another CRAP amendment, in
the near future with much more de
served support.
