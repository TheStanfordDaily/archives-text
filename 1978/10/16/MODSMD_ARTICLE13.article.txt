## Solar systems cost less 
### 
Many "experts" have been
claiming that solar heating still
costs several times more than
conventional energy. But what
these experts are actually re
ferring to is the cost of the sys
tem at the time you buy it
(compared to buying an oil, gas
or electric furnace). A genuine
appraisal of solar costs vs. con
ventional energy sources must
include the total costs of the
system over its lifetime (life
cycle) cost.
Solar heating investments,
for hot water or for rooms,
generally pay for themselves in
five to 15 years, and after that
will be virtually cost-free. So
over the life of a solar system,
you will save money. Solar is
therefore cheaper. Further
more, the costs of solar sys
tems are often greatly exagger
ated — figures from many
years ago or the highest figures
available are cited. If the world
is to have enough safe, clean
energy at a reasonable cost,
fair cost comparisons must be
demanded from the experts so
that intelligent decisions can
be made for the long-term fu
ture.
Estimates of the cost of nuc
lear power have not taken into
account certain facts, such as
the lower-than-expected
operating reliability of nuclear
plants, the huge amounts of
energy it takes to enrich
uranium and the energy used
to make the materials for and
construct the plant, mine and
transport the fuel, store the
wastes and shut down the old
plant. Thus, in a net-energy
analysis, nuclear power prob
ably produces only about 10
percent of the energy the ex

perts claim — or in other
words, it is 10 times more ex
pensive. Instead of cost $1000
per kilowatt, it costs $10,000!
Yet, these are the vital details
that the public will need to
make fair comparisons of the
costs of energy sources. It
takes energy to make solar
equipment too, but far less
than it takes to produce nuc
lear power, gasified coal, etc.
Solar heating and hot water
systems could also become
much less expensive. One
solar system (designed by
Harry Thomason) costs only
$4000 complete, which is one
third to one-sixth the cost of
other solar systems. Costs of
solar systems are falling while
those of other energy sources
are rising. Development of
solar cooling would also im
prove the economic attraction
of solar systems.
Not every building has
enough access to the sun for a
solar system. But there are
plenty that do. Large buildings
like factories, government
buildings and schools have
easy access to solar resources,
and we should get moving to
ward a solar society.
Since our buildings are re
placed at a rate oi 2 percent a
year, new buildings should in
corporate energy-conserving
features. Few people have
heard of "passive solar" ar
chitecture, which often costs
no more than conventional
buildings, yet can provide 75
percent or more of heating and
cooling needs.
Solar also bolsters the dollar
by reducing our dependence
on oil imports and creating
jobs in the U.S. It is safer and

less environmentally
damaging than nuclear sys
tems, LNG, fusion, strip-mined
coal and other "fuels of the fu
ture."
We need to remedy this.
Consumers need very low
interest loans to buy solar sys
tems. A good proposal is for
the government to arrange
solar or insulation loans which
could be paid back at the same
rate as the savings on one's
energy bill. In this way, solar
would never cost more than
other sources. Perhaps the
utilities might want to arrange
such loans and reap some of
the profits when the solar in
vestment is paid back.
Energy is such an important
matter that we cannot afford to
make critical decisions, which
will determine the future of the
world, with only a partial know
ledge of long-term energy
costs and social effects. Thus, it
is important for each of us to
increase our understanding
about the promise of solar
energy.
