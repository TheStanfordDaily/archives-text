Chain letter must be stopped
The Circle of Cold chain letter has been
widely circulated in the Bay Area for several
months. Recently it appeared on the Stanford
campus. Since most people encounter the letter
in the context of an offer to buy, we want to
present it from a different perspective.
The chain letter concept is an old one. Its use
as a money-making scheme is a classic con
sumer fraud, prohibited here by both federal
and state law.
The basic pitch of those who have offered us
the Circle of Cold is: "Buy a letter: sell it twice
and break even; then wait for the bucks to pour
in. The circle continues forever and nobody
loses."
In fact, the chain letter cannot continue inde
finitely. In one cycle of 10 sales a buyer's name
rises from the bottom of the list on the letters he
sold, to the top of the list on the letters from
which he receives money. A little more than
three such full cycles will exhaust the popula
tion of the world, unless previous buyers re
purchase the letter. Even if this occurs on an
unlimited scale, the cost of buying all the letters
in circulation after five full cycles exceeds the
world money supply.
Obviously the chain must be broken. Exhaus
tion of the population of willing buyers has
brought an end to every previous chain letter.
The number of letters on which people lose
money is necessarily large, growing exponen
tially as the letter is duplicated and resold. The
number of letters on which buyers make money
cannot exceed the number of letters on which
buyers lose money. Because few people rebuy
the letter, the number of individuals who lose
money is approximately equal to the number of
dollars won, divided by the cost of the letter.
The amount of money paid out through the
chain letter is always equal to the amount paid in
by the participants. Dollar for dollar, one per
son's gain is another's loss.
"So," you say, "there are winners and losers
in the world. Besides, some of us will toss in a
hundred dollars just for the experience, or to
make a friend a winner. Money isn't every
thing. "
We have no argument with this. But after you
buy, how will you sell? Will you pass along to
prospective purchasers the information we
offer here? Will you at least warn them that the
odds are that they will lose money if they buy?
How do you accept money honestly from those

who bought in ignorance of all this, who heard
and trusted, "Nobody loses?"

P.E. 'jokes'
lon Reider's letter in the Daily (Oct. 11), is
fallacious in logic and fact. Reider's claim that it
is illogical to associate classes formed by "volun
teers" with those composed by genetic dictate is
valid only if one accepts the non sequitor that
such a distinction exists. Generalizations,
whether they are about groups with similar at
tributes or Reider's emotive falacy that volun
teer vis-a-vis genetic groups forms a taxonomic
reality, are dangerous impediments to coming
to know truth. Personal, occupational, or pro
fessional stereotypes all serve to obscure reality.
In this light, Prof. Krumboltz' association is any
thing but improper.
With regard to the "institutional wisdom" of
the University, it must be mentioned that the
University has been among the leaders in physi
cal education from its inception in 1891. This
University was preceeded only by Harvard in
instituting a four year degree program in physi
cal education. Under the direction of Thomas
Wood, the degree program was made available
in 1892. The first university in America to offer
the degree of Doctor of Physical Education was
Stanford in 1929. This leadership continues.
Physical educators have accommodated to
the myriad "jokes" about their stereotyped
identity as Reider suggests they should. The
status of the profession, however, is not as im
mune as our personal sense of worth in the face
of such bigotry. The development of each hu
man's potential, be it intellectual, spiritual or
physical is not served by demeaning the profes
sions which work toward that end.

Chain letter must be stopped
The Circle of Cold chain letter has been
widely circulated in the Bay Area for several
months. Recently it appeared on the Stanford
campus. Since most people encounter the letter
in the context of an offer to buy, we want to
present it from a different perspective.
The chain letter concept is an old one. Its use
as a money-making scheme is a classic con
sumer fraud, prohibited here by both federal
and state law.
The basic pitch of those who have offered us
the Circle of Cold is: "Buy a letter: sell it twice
and break even; then wait for the bucks to pour
in. The circle continues forever and nobody
loses."
In fact, the chain letter cannot continue inde
finitely. In one cycle of 10 sales a buyer's name
rises from the bottom of the list on the letters he
sold, to the top of the list on the letters from
which he receives money. A little more than
three such full cycles will exhaust the popula
tion of the world, unless previous buyers re
purchase the letter. Even if this occurs on an
unlimited scale, the cost of buying all the letters
in circulation after five full cycles exceeds the
world money supply.
Obviously the chain must be broken. Exhaus
tion of the population of willing buyers has
brought an end to every previous chain letter.
The number of letters on which people lose
money is necessarily large, growing exponen
tially as the letter is duplicated and resold. The
number of letters on which buyers make money
cannot exceed the number of letters on which
buyers lose money. Because few people rebuy
the letter, the number of individuals who lose
money is approximately equal to the number of
dollars won, divided by the cost of the letter.
The amount of money paid out through the
chain letter is always equal to the amount paid in
by the participants. Dollar for dollar, one per
son's gain is another's loss.
"So," you say, "there are winners and losers
in the world. Besides, some of us will toss in a
hundred dollars just for the experience, or to
make a friend a winner. Money isn't every
thing. "
We have no argument with this. But after you
buy, how will you sell? Will you pass along to
prospective purchasers the information we
offer here? Will you at least warn them that the
odds are that they will lose money if they buy?
How do you accept money honestly from those

who bought in ignorance of all this, who heard
and trusted, "Nobody loses?"
