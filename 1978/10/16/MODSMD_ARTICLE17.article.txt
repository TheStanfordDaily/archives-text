## Problems with libertarianism 
### 
Like all vogue philosophies, liber
tarianism attracts many adherents who do
not understand the doctrine fully and fail
to see its implications in the modern
world. These ideologues propose the ap
plication to modern American society of a
doctrine whose results would be precisely
the opposite of the stated objectives of the
believers in libertarianism.
Certainly the idealism of libertarianism's
proponents and their stated objectives are
to be praised. Living in an increasingly
regulated world in which the individual
has minimal influence by himself, the
libertarians rebel against the often arbit
rary authority of governmentin all spheres
of life, advocating a return to the laissez
faire attitude of the 18th and 19th centuries
and suggesting that the doctrine he
applied to the regulation of individuals'
personal lives.
Yet, anything more than a superficial
analysis will show that the application of
the doctrine of laissez-faire in modern soc
iety will not liberate the vast majority of
men, but will enslave them.
In terms of personal lifestyle, liber
tarianism proposes that the government
should discontinue all actions which seek
to restrict the individual in his or her per
sonal choices. This proposal is made with
the very laudable goal of individual free
dom in mind, but it runs into the same
problem it always has, ever since it was
first made by John Stuart Mill in On Lib
erty: what is a private act, and what is a
public act bound to interfere with the
freedom of others?
The issue is illustrated in the debate over
the anti-smoking initiative on the Califor
nia ballot. Smoking is a personal act which
opponents of the measure say should not
be regulated. Yet proponents claim that
smokers should be regulated because
they interfere with the public's right to
clean air. Neither side has openly raised
the issue, but it might also be asked: how
will the regulation of smoking affect sale of
cigarettes, something the tobacco indus
try would have us believe to be a crucial
sector of the economy?
In analyzing economic issues, the liber

tarians contend that a free market
economy with perfect competition would
exist if government regulations did not
support parasitic monopolies. Govern
ment regulation may indeed restrict com
petition in some cases, but to remove it
would merely replace the power of public
bureaucracy with the unrestrained power
of the private sector.
Libertarians propose to lift all restric
tions on the exercise of individual free
dom in the private and economic spheres.
In a society of relative equals such as that
of the 1800s, such a policy would have
been beneficial, because it would have al
lowed equals a maximum amount of free
dom to negotiate prices and wages among
themselves.
Unfortunately, that same libertarian
doctrine would today be a mask behind
which strong economic interests such as
the corporations and labor unions would
hide while exploiting the weak.

. . . the libertarians rebel
against the often arbitrary
authority of government in
all spheres of life.

Economic relationships are relation
ships of power. Once this fact is estab
lished, it can also be recognized that it is
legitimate for economically weaker
groups to use non-economic means, such
as coercion or taxation, to counteract the
power of the economically strong in the
market place and acquire a more just dis
tribution of wealth than would be possible
in a laissez-faire economy.
The problems of libertarianism, how
ever, are much more fundamental than
mere questions of personal morality or
economic policy. They strike at the very
root of the paradoxical relation between
liberty and equality.
Liberty is power. In an egalitarian soci
ety, it is the power of each individual over
his own self. Yet once society is no longer
equal, liberty becomes power over others.
It is this power over others which liber

tarianism would allow the wealthy and
powerful to exercise in our society.
The issue is difficult to define. Liberta
rians would certainly have supported the
petitions for liberty of the Southern gentry
before the civil war. Yet that lifestyle
necessitated the existence of slavery, an
evil which any good libertarian would
condemn. To abolish slavery meant to
abolish the ante-bellum southerner's life
style, an obvious restriction on personal
liberty.
Further, to assert that the slaves entered
freely into relationships with their masters
is to mask the obvious truth that they were
forced by military and economic cir
cumstances to do so. The same holds
today for the relationships between
wage-earner and the employer or the
manufacturer and the consumer.
What emerges is the fact that, in a situa
tion of inequality, freedom becomes the
freedom of some to tyrannize over others.
Equality is a necessary precondition for a
just freedom. To maintain that equality
necessitates a certain amount of coercion
on the part of the collectively organized
weak to restrain the strong.
The issue is complicated when society
wishes to maintain inequality in order to
reap its benefits, as in the economic
sphere. The ironic situation can emerge
where the maximization of freedom in one
sphere of human life necessitates re
gimentation and regulation in another
sphere.
If the issue sounds complicated, it is.
The simple solutions of vogue
philosophies such as libertarianism do not
suffice in a modern industrial society. Afar
better approach would be to strip away the
veil of ideology from political issues and
ask the question: who benefits and who
loses in this case? Who should benefit and
who should lose? Society should spend its
time asking concrete questions such as
these and avoid debates on abstract con
cepts such as "liberty" when they serve to
mistify rather than clarify the issues at
hand.

Equality is a necessary precondition for a
just freedom. To maintain that equality
necessitates a certain amount of coercion
on the part of the collectively organized
weak to restrain the strong.
The issue is complicated when society
wishes to maintain inequality in order to
reap its benefits, as in the economic
sphere. The ironic situation can emerge
where the maximization of freedom in one
sphere of human life necessitates re
gimentation and regulation in another
sphere.
If the issue sounds complicated, it is.
The simple solutions of vogue
philosophies such as libertarianism do not
suffice in a modern industrial society. Afar
better approach would be to strip away the
veil of ideology from political issues and
ask the question: who benefits and who
loses in this case? Who should benefit and
who should lose? Society should spend its
time asking concrete questions such as
these and avoid debates on abstract con
cepts such as "liberty" when they serve to
mistify rather than clarify the issues at

Like all vogue philosophies, liber
tarianism attracts many adherents who do
not understand the doctrine fully and fail
to see its implications in the modern
world. These ideologues propose the ap
plication to modern American society of a
doctrine whose results would be precisely
the opposite of the stated objectives of the
believers in libertarianism.
Certainly the idealism of libertarianism's
proponents and their stated objectives are
to be praised. Living in an increasingly
regulated world in which the individual
has minimal influence by himself, the
libertarians rebel against the often arbit
rary authority of governmentin all spheres
of life, advocating a return to the laissez
faire attitude of the 18th and 19th centuries
and suggesting that the doctrine he
applied to the regulation of individuals'
personal lives.
Yet, anything more than a superficial
analysis will show that the application of
the doctrine of laissez-faire in modern soc
iety will not liberate the vast majority of
men, but will enslave them.
In terms of personal lifestyle, liber
tarianism proposes that the government
should discontinue all actions which seek
to restrict the individual in his or her per
sonal choices. This proposal is made with
the very laudable goal of individual free
dom in mind, but it runs into the same
problem it always has, ever since it was
first made by John Stuart Mill in On Lib
erty: what is a private act, and what is a
public act bound to interfere with the
freedom of others?
The issue is illustrated in the debate over
the anti-smoking initiative on the Califor
nia ballot. Smoking is a personal act which
opponents of the measure say should not
be regulated. Yet proponents claim that
smokers should be regulated because
they interfere with the public's right to
clean air. Neither side has openly raised
the issue, but it might also be asked: how
will the regulation of smoking affect sale of
cigarettes, something the tobacco indus
try would have us believe to be a crucial
sector of the economy?
In analyzing economic issues, the liber

tarians contend that a free market
economy with perfect competition would
exist if government regulations did not
support parasitic monopolies. Govern
ment regulation may indeed restrict com
petition in some cases, but to remove it
would merely replace the power of public
bureaucracy with the unrestrained power
of the private sector.
Libertarians propose to lift all restric
tions on the exercise of individual free
dom in the private and economic spheres.
In a society of relative equals such as that
of the 1800s, such a policy would have
been beneficial, because it would have al
lowed equals a maximum amount of free
dom to negotiate prices and wages among
themselves.
Unfortunately, that same libertarian
doctrine would today be a mask behind
which strong economic interests such as
the corporations and labor unions would
hide while exploiting the weak.

. . . the libertarians rebel
against the often arbitrary
authority of government in
all spheres of life.

Economic relationships are relation
ships of power. Once this fact is estab
lished, it can also be recognized that it is
legitimate for economically weaker
groups to use non-economic means, such
as coercion or taxation, to counteract the
power of the economically strong in the
market place and acquire a more just dis
tribution of wealth than would be possible
in a laissez-faire economy.
The problems of libertarianism, how
ever, are much more fundamental than
mere questions of personal morality or
economic policy. They strike at the very
root of the paradoxical relation between
liberty and equality.
Liberty is power. In an egalitarian soci
ety, it is the power of each individual over
his own self. Yet once society is no longer
equal, liberty becomes power over others.
It is this power over others which liber

tarianism would allow the wealthy and
powerful to exercise in our society.
The issue is difficult to define. Liberta
rians would certainly have supported the
petitions for liberty of the Southern gentry
before the civil war. Yet that lifestyle
necessitated the existence of slavery, an
evil which any good libertarian would
condemn. To abolish slavery meant to
abolish the ante-bellum southerner's life
style, an obvious restriction on personal
liberty.
Further, to assert that the slaves entered
freely into relationships with their masters
is to mask the obvious truth that they were
forced by military and economic cir
cumstances to do so. The same holds
today for the relationships between
wage-earner and the employer or the
manufacturer and the consumer.

tion of inequality, freedom becomes the
freedom of some to tyrannize over others.

Liberty is power. In an egalitarian soci
ety, it is the power of each individual over
his own self. Yet once society is no longer
equal, liberty becomes power over others.
It is this power over others which liber

tarianism would allow the wealthy and
powerful to exercise in our society.
The issue is difficult to define. Liberta
rians would certainly have supported the
petitions for liberty of the Southern gentry
before the civil war. Yet that lifestyle
necessitated the existence of slavery, an
evil which any good libertarian would
condemn. To abolish slavery meant to
abolish the ante-bellum southerner's life
style, an obvious restriction on personal
liberty.
Further, to assert that the slaves entered
freely into relationships with their masters
is to mask the obvious truth that they were
forced by military and economic cir
cumstances to do so. The same holds
today for the relationships between
wage-earner and the employer or the
manufacturer and the consumer.
What emerges is the fact that, in a situa
tion of inequality, freedom becomes the
freedom of some to tyrannize over others.
Equality is a necessary precondition for a
just freedom. To maintain that equality
necessitates a certain amount of coercion
on the part of the collectively organized
weak to restrain the strong.
The issue is complicated when society
wishes to maintain inequality in order to
reap its benefits, as in the economic
sphere. The ironic situation can emerge
where the maximization of freedom in one
sphere of human life necessitates re
gimentation and regulation in another
sphere.
If the issue sounds complicated, it is.
The simple solutions of vogue
philosophies such as libertarianism do not
suffice in a modern industrial society. Afar
better approach would be to strip away the
veil of ideology from political issues and
ask the question: who benefits and who
loses in this case? Who should benefit and
who should lose? Society should spend its
time asking concrete questions such as
these and avoid debates on abstract con
cepts such as "liberty" when they serve to
mistify rather than clarify the issues at
hand.

Like all vogue philosophies, liber
tarianism attracts many adherents who do
not understand the doctrine fully and fail
to see its implications in the modern
world. These ideologues propose the ap
plication to modern American society of a
doctrine whose results would be precisely
the opposite of the stated objectives of the
believers in libertarianism.
Certainly the idealism of libertarianism's
proponents and their stated objectives are
to be praised. Living in an increasingly
regulated world in which the individual
has minimal influence by himself, the
libertarians rebel against the often arbit
rary authority of governmentin all spheres
of life, advocating a return to the laissez
faire attitude of the 18th and 19th centuries
and suggesting that the doctrine he
applied to the regulation of individuals'
personal lives.
Yet, anything more than a superficial
analysis will show that the application of
the doctrine of laissez-faire in modern soc
iety will not liberate the vast majority of
men, but will enslave them.
In terms of personal lifestyle, liber
tarianism proposes that the government
should discontinue all actions which seek
to restrict the individual in his or her per
sonal choices. This proposal is made with
the very laudable goal of individual free
dom in mind, but it runs into the same
problem it always has, ever since it was
first made by John Stuart Mill in On Lib
erty: what is a private act, and what is a
public act bound to interfere with the
freedom of others?
The issue is illustrated in the debate over
the anti-smoking initiative on the Califor
nia ballot. Smoking is a personal act which
opponents of the measure say should not
be regulated. Yet proponents claim that
smokers should be regulated because
they interfere with the public's right to
clean air. Neither side has openly raised
the issue, but it might also be asked: how
will the regulation of smoking affect sale of
cigarettes, something the tobacco indus
try would have us believe to be a crucial
sector of the economy?
In analyzing economic issues, the liber

tarians contend that a free market
economy with perfect competition would
exist if government regulations did not
support parasitic monopolies. Govern
ment regulation may indeed restrict com
petition in some cases, but to remove it
would merely replace the power of public
bureaucracy with the unrestrained power
of the private sector.
Libertarians propose to lift all restric
tions on the exercise of individual free
dom in the private and economic spheres.
In a society of relative equals such as that
of the 1800s, such a policy would have
been beneficial, because it would have al
lowed equals a maximum amount of free
dom to negotiate prices and wages among
themselves.
Unfortunately, that same libertarian
doctrine would today be a mask behind
which strong economic interests such as
the corporations and labor unions would
hide while exploiting the weak.

. . . the libertarians rebel
against the often arbitrary
authority of government in
all spheres of life.

Economic relationships are relation
ships of power. Once this fact is estab
lished, it can also be recognized that it is
legitimate for economically weaker
groups to use non-economic means, such
as coercion or taxation, to counteract the
power of the economically strong in the
market place and acquire a more just dis
tribution of wealth than would be possible
in a laissez-faire economy.
The problems of libertarianism, how
ever, are much more fundamental than
mere questions of personal morality or
economic policy. They strike at the very
root of the paradoxical relation between
liberty and equality.
