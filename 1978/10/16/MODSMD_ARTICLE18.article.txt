# Ben Pollock
## Insider's view 
### 
Ben ran into his cohort,
Noah Vale, in front of
Memorial Church late yes
terday afternoon. Each had
some free time, so they de
cided to catch up on what
had been happening that
week.
"Oh, not much happened
with me," Noah said, "but I
kept up with the student
elections in my usual way. I
don't know if you noticed,
Ben, but the campaign
posters were put up in
waves. All the candidates
did not post on the first day
of the campaign. I served as
coordinator.
It was now Ben's turn to
bemoan his problems.
"Gosh it was bad, Noah. I
did this beautiful column on
the Stanford Band the week
before last. A decent, for
mal essay — nice grammar,
parallel structure, the
works. It had just one flaw.
The most blatant point —
that the Band should dis
band — wasn't the one I in
tended to make. That re
mark offended the Incom
parables greatly; they
nearly lynched me at re
hearsal."
"Rehearsal? I didn't know
you were in The Band,"
Noah said.
"Sure, ever since spring
quarter of freshman year. I
play valve trombone," re
plied Ben.
"Huh; so your column
was an insider's view," said
Noah. "I could tell you're
crazy about the LSJUMB,
but worried."
"Yeah, I've beeji upset
ever since Mohammed

came to the mountain; er,
when President Richard
Lyman visited our rehearsal.
Briefly, Lyman asked for
more clever, less offensive,
shows. He was quite pleas
ant about it. What worried
me is what he didn't say. He
didn't mention any con
sequences if his request
wasn't fulfilled. Noah, I feel
the Band is on double
secret probation.
"I don't blame Lyman. He
gets many letters from
cranks who don't under
stand us. But the University
can't afford to lose the
LSJUMB in its present form.
You know, we're the last
stronghold of the '60s ir
reverence. The Band's in
novation must be main
tained until students snap
out of their middle class
values once again and re
sume their rightful role of
improving the world while
ignoring materialistic ten
dencies."
"The point I wanted to
emphasize, Noah, is the fu
ture of the LSJUMB is a little
shaky, and students should
be aware of that."
By this time the sun had
set. Noah pulled his pup
tent out of his pack and set it
up in one of the oases of the
Inner Quad. Ben went to his
dorm wondering if nitrous
oxide damages thfe ozone
layer. He never quite reco
vered from the various ex
cesses of a recent weekend,
which he spent with the
Band in Los Angeles.
