# Cards succumb to heartbreaking ineptitude
## Suffer late-game relapse after nearly surviving 3rd-period arrest Husky defense outpoints Cards

By EMI LIE DEUTSCH
The Cards are becoming ex
perts in cardiac football.
Unfortunately, for the last
two weekends, their last
minute attempts at resuscita
tion have been unsuccessful
though the symptoms of suc
cess were there — including
548 total yards for the Cardinals
compared to a meager Husky
effort of 310. But in the final
diagnosis, the Cards'were
overcome by a sieve-like
punt-coverage team and an
opposing defense that knew
how to go both ways.
The Huskies left the field
more physically, emotionally
and mentally healthy than the
Cards, who returned to the
locker room nursing their 0-2
conference standing and a
terminal case of disbelief.
"I can't believe we lost," said
Cardinal quarterback Steve
Dils,whobruisedhis ribsinthe
closing downs. "I don't see
how one five-yard touchdown
and one field goal could have
beaten us."
"This loss was as tough as
last week," wide receiver Ken

Margerum said. "It took me
until Thursday night to get over
last week's loss. Words just
can't describe the feeling."
"No one wins a game like
they did today," said head
Stanford coach Bill Walsh. "It's
unfortunate, two games in a
row."
Last week's 27-26 loss to
UCLA contained many of the
same elements that plagued
the Cards again Saturday —
primarily degeneration of the
punting game and a field goal
in the last 30 seconds to con
firm an opponent victory.
Stanford entered the fourth
quarter with a 7-point deficit to
the Huskies, 24-31. After clos
ing the first set of downs with an
unsuccessful fake field goal,
the Huskies awarded the Cards
the ball on the Stanford 30.
Dils found this an opportune
time to throw his longest pass
of the game, a 62-yard comple
tion to tight end Mitch Pleis,
which landed the Cards on the
Washington 8.
The Cards did not take ad
vantage of the field position
though, gaining only six of the

eight yards to the goal line.
With the ball on the 2-yard line,
the Cards decided to go for the
TD instead of the field goal and
came up short on an incom
plete pass to tight end Pat
Bowe in the end zone.
"At that time we thought we
had things that would get us in
there for the TD," said Walsh.
"If there was any judgment er
ror, that might have been it,
but I think we were proved to
be correct. It was a close call."
Close enough to ignite the
Card defense to hold the
Husky revenge to seven yards,
forcing them to punt to mid
field. Chewing up the 50 yards
in nine plays, fullback Phil
Francis took the ball to the left
for six yards and the final TD of
the game. And then the deci
sion to go for one instead of
two produced a successful
Naber PAT, but no winning
margin.
The score was knotted 31-31.
"We had to stop them to
beat them," said Walsh on his
choosing not to go for a two
point conversion with 5:03 re
maining in the game. "I didn't

think we had anything that
would work for two points. It
would have been foolhardy to
go for two. It's a low percen
tage play — it works about one
out of every eight times. I think
more coaches have been fired
for that than any other single
event."
Stanford completed an un
productive four downs and
Washington repossessed the
pigskin with 44 seconds re
maining in the game.
Husky QB Tom Porras im
mediately drilled one to
flanker Keith Richardson for a
crucial 40 yards. From the Stan
ford 11, they plunged to the
seven-yard line and with 14
seconds remaining, Michael
Lansford split the posts for
three.
For the second time in eight
days, last-second Stanford
hopes were thwarted by an in
terception — this one thrown
by Turk Schonert who was in
for a roughed-up Steve Dils.
The men in the cardinal and
white slumped off the field. For
the first time in his tenure as
Stanford head coach, Walsh
had lost two in a row. This time
it was the pumped-up Husky
defense that managed to score
21 points in the third quarter by
capitalizing on fatal Cardinal
errors that occurred following
the best first half the Cards
have had all season.
An energized Stanford team
lost the toss, but won the first
points on a 99-yard drive that
was begun and completed in
five near-perfect plays. Stan
ford finally found the 'big play'
— 59-yard scamper by Oarrin
Nelson followed immediately
by a 29-yard Dils to Cordon
Banks pass which lit the
scoreboard with six.
The next score also be
longed to Stanford and was
facilitated by Naber who
booted a 25-yard field goal.
The first Husky score was
handed to them courtesy of the
Cardinal punt coverage team
as Brad Fox's kick was blocked
by cornerback Ken Gardner,
picked up by Jeff Leeland and
returned 22 yards for a
touchdown.
Th ree Stanford passes — two
to Nelson and one to
Margerum (who caught five
passes for 113 yards) — set up
the second Banks TD, a three
yard dash up the middle.

with a 36-yard touchdown which tied the game at 17-17. Forty-nine seconds later Theoudele's secon

their way to a 34-31 victory.
