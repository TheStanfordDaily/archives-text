# Younger forsees blackouts

Sounding the alarm about some possible "economic
Pearl Harbors" in California's future, State Attorney
General Evelle Younger blasted Gov. Jerry Brown's posi
tions on energy, housing and budgetary surpluses Fri
day in a speech to San Francisco's Commonwealth Club.
"Economically, we may be headed for some Pearl
Harbors," the Republican challenger told the crowd.
"This ought to concern you ... as a matter of fact, it
ought to worry you."
Younger said that California will have a significant
power shortage by the mid 1980s if something is not
done now to produce more energy.
"Gov. Brown and his current advisers would tell us
that there is enough energy to take care of us until 1990
with present resources," he said. "But the lights are
going to go out in California."
Nuclear power is the only source of energy that can
meet California's needs, Younger said.
"The truth is, we need safe, clean and relatively effi
cient nuclear energy," he said, adding that lie would get
the Sun Desert and Diablo Valley projects "back on
track" and abolish the State Energy Commission and its
$20 million budget.
In response to a question, Younger said that scientific
studies have confirmed "safe disposal methods" for the

radioactive waste from nuclear power plants.
"I rely on scientists, not on social scientists," said
Younger, referring to Brown's publicly-stated fears con
cerning safe disposal of radioactive waste. "That's where
Gov. Brown gets his information — when he cares to
seek any information."
Younger said that the waste could be encased in spe
cial glass and stored in a mile-deep hole in the desert.
Younger called the current state budget surplus
"obscene," and said it could go as high as $10 billion by
the end of the next fiscal year.
"But Jerry Brown and some people pooh-pooh that
figure," Younger said. "Either Jerry Brown isn't honest
with us or he's so incompetent that he doesn't know
what the surplus is."
Younger said he has asked Brown to return the surplus
to California taxpayers in the form of tax relief.
"The governor responded to my letter the way he
usually does — he didn't answer it," Younger said. "The
surplus is mind-boggling in what it says about this ad
ministration's attitude toward the taxpayer and citizen."
Younger called for an independent auditor to deter
mine the exact amount of the budget surplus, and then
arrange for the amount to be given back to tax-paying
families. He said each such family would receive $500 in
tax relief.
