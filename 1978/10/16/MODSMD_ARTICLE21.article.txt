# Win skein at 6 games
## Booters down Westmont, Reno 
### DEAN EYRE 
The Stanford soccer team
logged one of its most impor
tant victories of the season Fri
day afternoon by beating
Westmont College, 1-0. And
Saturday the Cardinals didn't
have to hedge their bets as they
soundly defeated Nevada-
Reno, 8-1.
By taking the pair of games
the Cards raise their season re
cord to 10-1, including a string
of six straight wins. But more
importantly, the reputation of
the Westmont club will work in
Stanford's advantage, accord
ing to Cardinal coach Nelson
Lodge.
"For us, that win was proba
bly the most important win of
the bunch because they are
seventh-ranked in theWest and
he's (coach Russ Carr) a South
ern California rater," Lodge
said. "He now goes back to
Southern California realizing
that Stanford should belong in
the top 10. There is no doubt in
my mind about this."
The lone goal in Friday's
match came from the one-two
punch of Ted Rafalovich and
Dan McNevin. McNevin's goal,
14 minutes into the second half
and backed up by a stingy de
fense, was enough to do in
Westmont.
In stark contrast to previous
games, the Cards put together
a strong first-half effort.
Lodge said that it was "the
best first half we've had. It was
obvious to both Phillip
(Wright, assistant coach) and
me that this is what we have to
work on. I brought up the fact
that we should dominate the
style of play rather than letting
them dominate and from there
on it's a struggle of two
philosophies.
"Conservatively speaking,"
he added, "we had 12 shots at
the goal (in the first half) which

means that we were really
pressuring — it's just a shame
the ball doesn't goin, butthat's
the game."
The Rafalovich-McNevin
combination broke the ice in
Saturday's contest, giving the
Cards a 1-0 lead 13 minutes into
the game. The Wolf Pack came
back with its only score of the
game, off the foot of Brad
Ditzworth.
Jack McGannon assisted
Rafalovich as Stanford re
claimed the lead with seven
minutes left in the half. A dou
ble assist from McNevin and
Rafalovich gave senior fullback
Mike Knowles the set-up for
another goal.
Laird Cagan, with an assist
from Paul Kozachenko, got the
second half off to a quick start,
scoring the Cards' fourth goal
with just 54 seconds elapsed.
Cagan added another goal 12
minutes later.
Jaime Romo fed Rafalovich a
key pass, resulting in the
freshman forward's second

score to give Stanford a 6-1
lead. Neil Tennyson, a
freshman fullback, then took a
Rafalovich pass in for a goal.
McNevin put in the final tally
with seven minutes remaining
in the game.
"Once this team realizes
they can go at them, they just
do it," Lodge said. "Today,
even the second team was able
to score against them. We're
better now than we've ever
been. Today was an awesome
show of strength when you get
young freshmen scoring and
setting up the goals.
"It's a team win because
everybody played and scored
— it wasn't just the first team.
That's good, mainly because
they get the thirst that they
want to score goals and they're
in the game," he added.
"It's awesome to come on to
a team that's 10-1," said Barry
Linnett, a freshman midfielder.
"I came out here three years
ago before he (Lodge) came
here and the team really

looked bad. I thought I'd walk
on the team and just make it,
which sounds conceited, but I
just thought I'd make it; I
swear I fought for my life just to
survive the cut.
"When I first came out, it re
ally was hard to accept that it
was the great style (of play) he
said it was. The guy knows
what he's doing — he took a
losing team, now we're look
ing for the quarterfinals."
Stanford left yesterday to
face Humboldt State today at
11 a.m. "It's alwaysa little scary
going to Humboldt," Lodge
said, "because they play on a
funny field, like Fresno State's
field, and they play very strong
on that field. We're going to
have to play our wings set wide
and play our game."
The next home game is
Wednesday against Santa
Clara, another traditional soc
cer rival and an important op
ponent for conference stand
ings. The match will be at 2
p.m. on Maloney Field.

ern California rater," Lodge
said. "He now goes back to
Southern California realizing
that Stanford should belong in
the top 10. There is no doubt in
my mind about this."
The lone goal in Friday's
match came from the one-two
punch of Ted Rafalovich and
Dan McNevin. McNevin's goal,
14 minutes into the second half
and backed up by a stingy de
fense, was enough to do in
Westmont.
In stark contrast to previous
games, the Cards put together
a strong first-half effort.
Lodge said that it was "the
best first half we've had. It was
obvious to both Phillip
(Wright, assistant coach) and
me that this is what we have to
work on. I brought up the fact
that we should dominate the
style of play rather than letting
them dominate and from there
on it's a struggle of two
philosophies.
"Conservatively speaking,"
he added, "we had 12 shots at
the goal (in the first half) which

means that we were really
pressuring — it's just a shame
the ball doesn't goin, butthat's
the game."
The Rafalovich-McNevin
combination broke the ice in
Saturday's contest, giving the
Cards a 1-0 lead 13 minutes into
the game. The Wolf Pack came
back with its only score of the
game, off the foot of Brad
Ditzworth.
Jack McGannon assisted
Rafalovich as Stanford re
claimed the lead with seven
minutes left in the half. A dou
ble assist from McNevin and
Rafalovich gave senior fullback
Mike Knowles the set-up for
another goal.
Laird Cagan, with an assist
from Paul Kozachenko, got the
second half off to a quick start,
scoring the Cards' fourth goal
with just 54 seconds elapsed.
Cagan added another goal 12
minutes later.
Jaime Romo fed Rafalovich a
key pass, resulting in the
freshman forward's second

score to give Stanford a 6-1
lead. Neil Tennyson, a
freshman fullback, then took a
Rafalovich pass in for a goal.
McNevin put in the final tally
with seven minutes remaining
in the game.
"Once this team realizes
they can go at them, they just
do it," Lodge said. "Today,
even the second team was able
to score against them. We're
better now than we've ever
been. Today was an awesome
show of strength when you get
young freshmen scoring and
setting up the goals.
"It's a team win because
everybody played and scored
— it wasn't just the first team.
That's good, mainly because
they get the thirst that they
want to score goals and they're
in the game," he added.
"It's awesome to come on to
a team that's 10-1," said Barry
Linnett, a freshman midfielder.
"I came out here three years
ago before he (Lodge) came
here and the team really

looked bad. I thought I'd walk
on the team and just make it,
which sounds conceited, but I
just thought I'd make it; I
swear I fought for my life just to
survive the cut.
"When I first came out, it re
ally was hard to accept that it
was the great style (of play) he
said it was. The guy knows
what he's doing — he took a
losing team, now we're look
ing for the quarterfinals."
Stanford left yesterday to
face Humboldt State today at
11 a.m. "It's alwaysa little scary
going to Humboldt," Lodge
said, "because they play on a
funny field, like Fresno State's
field, and they play very strong
on that field. We're going to
have to play our wings set wide
and play our game."
The next home game is
Wednesday against Santa
Clara, another traditional soc
cer rival and an important op
ponent for conference stand
ings. The match will be at 2
p.m. on Maloney Field.

work on. I brought up the fact
that we should dominate the
style of play rather than letting
them dominate and from there
on it's a struggle of two
philosophies.
"Conservatively speaking,"
he added, "we had 12 shots at
the goal (in the first half) which

means that we were really
pressuring — it's just a shame
the ball doesn't goin, butthat's
the game."
The Rafalovich-McNevin
combination broke the ice in
Saturday's contest, giving the
Cards a 1-0 lead 13 minutes into
the game. The Wolf Pack came
back with its only score of the
game, off the foot of Brad
Ditzworth.
Jack McGannon assisted
Rafalovich as Stanford re
claimed the lead with seven
minutes left in the half. A dou
ble assist from McNevin and
Rafalovich gave senior fullback
Mike Knowles the set-up for
another goal.
Laird Cagan, with an assist
from Paul Kozachenko, got the
second half off to a quick start,
scoring the Cards' fourth goal
with just 54 seconds elapsed.
Cagan added another goal 12
minutes later.
Jaime Romo fed Rafalovich a
key pass, resulting in the
freshman forward's second

score to give Stanford a 6-1
lead. Neil Tennyson, a
freshman fullback, then took a
Rafalovich pass in for a goal.
McNevin put in the final tally
with seven minutes remaining
in the game.
"Once this team realizes
they can go at them, they just
do it," Lodge said. "Today,
even the second team was able
to score against them. We're
better now than we've ever
been. Today was an awesome
show of strength when you get
young freshmen scoring and
setting up the goals.
"It's a team win because
everybody played and scored
— it wasn't just the first team.
That's good, mainly because
they get the thirst that they
want to score goals and they're
in the game," he added.
"It's awesome to come on to
a team that's 10-1," said Barry
Linnett, a freshman midfielder.
"I came out here three years
ago before he (Lodge) came
here and the team really

looked bad. I thought I'd walk
on the team and just make it,
which sounds conceited, but I
just thought I'd make it; I
swear I fought for my life just to
survive the cut.
"When I first came out, it re
ally was hard to accept that it
was the great style (of play) he
said it was. The guy knows
what he's doing — he took a
losing team, now we're look
ing for the quarterfinals."
Stanford left yesterday to
face Humboldt State today at
11 a.m. "It's alwaysa little scary
going to Humboldt," Lodge
said, "because they play on a
funny field, like Fresno State's
field, and they play very strong
on that field. We're going to
have to play our wings set wide
and play our game."
The next home game is
Wednesday against Santa
Clara, another traditional soc
cer rival and an important op
ponent for conference stand
ings. The match will be at 2
p.m. on Maloney Field.

Paul Kozachenko dribbles the ball past a defender on the way to an 8-1 Cardinal victory over
Nevada-Reno in competition Saturday. Stanford also defeated Westmont Friday, bringing their record
to 10-1.
The Stanford soccer team
logged one of its most impor
tant victories of the season Fri
day afternoon by beating
Westmont College, 1-0. And
Saturday the Cardinals didn't
have to hedge their bets as they
soundly defeated Nevada-
Reno, 8-1.
By taking the pair of games
the Cards raise their season re
cord to 10-1, including a string
of six straight wins. But more
importantly, the reputation of
the Westmont club will work in
Stanford's advantage, accord
ing to Cardinal coach Nelson
Lodge.
"For us, that win was proba
bly the most important win of
the bunch because they are
seventh-ranked in theWest and
he's (coach Russ Carr) a South
ern California rater," Lodge
said. "He now goes back to
Southern California realizing
that Stanford should belong in
the top 10. There is no doubt in
my mind about this."
The lone goal in Friday's
match came from the one-two
punch of Ted Rafalovich and
Dan McNevin. McNevin's goal,
14 minutes into the second half
and backed up by a stingy de
fense, was enough to do in
Westmont.
In stark contrast to previous
games, the Cards put together
a strong first-half effort.
Lodge said that it was "the
best first half we've had. It was
obvious to both Phillip
(Wright, assistant coach) and
me that this is what we have to
work on. I brought up the fact
that we should dominate the
style of play rather than letting
them dominate and from there
