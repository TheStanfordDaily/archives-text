Crew
The Stanford crew team was
evicted from its boathouse
last week at the Redwood City
port, said Tom Saftig, crew cap
tain. They are storing some of
their equipment at Roble,
some at a warehouse and some
in trailers parked by the port.
The crew needs a minimum
of $2500 to relocate. They are
receiving assistance from both
the Athletic Department, who
secured the Roble storage
area, and alumni. In the mean
time, novices and freshmen
are trying to practice in the

midst of the relocation.
The crew team knew it
would have to move eventu
ally, but didn't anticipate los
ing its boathouse this year.
