# Leaders miss turn
## Course mix-up mars Invitational 
### THEODORE HERHOLD 
With less than a half mile left in the Stanford
Invitational cross country race Saturday, the lead
ers accidently shortened the race by missing a
turn, clouding the final outcome in controversy.
"It was just one of those unfortunate things,"
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan said. "But
when an error like that is made, you just have to
live with it."
A half mile from the finish of the 10,000-meter
race, the top four runners, who had been leading
most of the way, failed to make a turn, and ended
up cutting 600 yards from the race. The real prob
lem occurred when most of the other runners
decided to follow the top four. "It was a mess,"
said one runner after the race. "Nobody knew
what the hell was going on."
From confusion came order — the finishing or
der. Jonathan Vernon broke the finish tape first in
31:39.0. Vernon's Santa Monica Track Club, one of
the top teams in the nation, finished well ahead of
the field with 28 points. Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
finished a distant second with 106 points. UC-
Irvine finished third with 111, and California, the
surprise team of the meet, ended up in fourth
place with 151. Stanford placed sixth with 170.
Stanford's top runner Roy Kissin finished sixth.
The rest of the Cardinal scorers were Rod Berry
(14), Bill Haldeman (36), Craig Corey (54) and Jerry

Emory (59).
After the race a few of the teams continued to
seeth because of the mix-up. Some decided to
make things even worse by refusing to take their
placement cards while in the finish shoot, which
made it very difficult for the scorers to add up the
final totals.
The women's team also ran on Saturday, but
continued to have problems of their own. The
Cards finished seventh with 155 points behind
California (28 points), Cal Poly-SLO (37), West Val
ley College (91), Chico State (131), Hayward State
(151) and Sacramento State (152).
Scoring for the women were Anne Thrupp, who
finished 13th in a time of 18:41; Susan Bragdon,
23rd (19:26); Annette Mungai, 29th (19:50); Kyle
Chapman, 43rd (20:59) and Beth Harrison, 53rd
(21:20).
Minor, but key injuries have plagued the
women for most of the year. Th rupp if still recover
ing from what a doctor termed an "iron defi
ciency."
Carolyn Layzer, another Card runner, was un
able to run due to an ankle infection. And Beth
Harrison's performance was hampered by foot
problems.
Cal Poly's Maggie Keyes ran the three-mile
course in a blazing 17:34.9, breaking the meet
record of UTEP's Debbie Pearson by 5.1 seconds.
