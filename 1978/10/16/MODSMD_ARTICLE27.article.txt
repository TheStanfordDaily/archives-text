Dante Dettamanti, Stanford
water polo coach, knows how
to use the understatement.
After his team returned from
the Southwest, having de
molished Arizona, 18-7, Friday
and UC-lrvine, 10-6, Saturday,
Dettamanti said, "We've de
veloped this explosive
ness. . . ."
Tied with Irvine 4-4 at
halftime, the Cards exploded
for six goals in the second half,
while allowing the Anteaters
only a pair of last-minute
scores.
"Irvine is the best team
we've played this year, besides
Cal," Dettamanti said. "They
play ball control. They're pa
tient and they wait for good
shots. They don't make too
many mistakes. They don't
commit everybody on offense,
which kind of takes away our
fast-break."
"They're probably the only
team in the country that can
stay up with us (on the fast
break)," he added.

Early in the second half, Tom
Angelo swam past a Doug
Burke pick, received a pass
from Jody Campbell and put
the ball past Irvine's goalie for
the score.
"Tom . . . he's done it be
fore," Dettamanti said.
"Campbell made a nice pass. It
broke the ice."
Angelo finished with three
goals in the game, but De
ttamanti stressed that he was
quite impressed with the ba
lanced attack the Cards
employed.
Seven Stanford players
scored against Irvine and 10
Cards recorded goals against
Arizona — including five by
Robby Arnold.
"It makes us a very good
team," Dettamanti said.
"Everyone on the team can
score and we can score so
many ways — fast-break, six
on-five, outside, you name it."
Stanford boasts an unde
feated 14-0-1 overall record this
year and is now 4-0 in Pac-10
play.
