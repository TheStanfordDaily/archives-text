Cardinals fail to pick new pope
Vatican City — Black smoke billowing into the
night from the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel
signaled to the world yesterday that the cardinals
of the Roman Catholic Church failed to elect a
successor to Pope John Paul I on the first day of
voting in their secret conclave.
Although there was no official explanation for
thefour inconclusive ballots, it appeared the coali
tion of conservative and progressive cardinals that
during the last conclave found a mutually accepta
ble candidate in Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice,
the former Pope John Paul, did not form around a
single cardinal this time.
Vatican analysts said Luciani attracted both con
servative and progressive cardinals because of his
pastoral simplicity.
The 111 cardinal-electors begin a second day of
voting today, with two ballots scheduled for the
morning and, if no pope is elected, two more in
the afternoon.
Energy bill passes with changes
Washington — Congress handed President
Jimmy Carter the biggest domestic victory of his
presidency yesterday, wearily approving a much
changed national energy plan first sent to Capitol
Hill 18 months ago.
The 95th Congress sent the White House a pac
kage that critics said will cost consumers too much
and produce few new energy reserves.
But the president praised the package, saying it
"will advance our national security, insure our
freedom of action in foreign affairs and protect our
economic interests at home and abroad."
Yet even its staunchest backers no longer claim
it will produce the changes in lifestyles once
suggested by the Carter administration.
Nor is it likely to bring the nation much closer to
energy self-sufficiency.
The five-part energy package is a far weaker one
than Carter sent to Congress on April 20, 1977 as
"the moral equivalent of war."
A multi-billion-dollar tax on crude oil, which
Carter once termed the centerpiece of the prog
ram, and a nickel-a-gallon tax on gasoline were
dropped as the measure worked its way through
Congress.
Congressional bill cuts taxes
Washington — Congress completed action yes
terday on an $18.7 billion bill that would cut taxes
for 65 million couples and individuals next year,
slash the capital gains tax and give a new break to
elderly Americans who sell their homes.
The measure now goes to the White House and
a top presidential aide said the president would
want to give it careful scrutiny before deciding
whether to sign it.
The final tax bill would give a $167 tax cut to a
typical four-member family with income of

$20,000, deductions totaling 23 percent of income
and a current tax bill of $2180.
Over objections of Republican members, the
conferees junked a provision allowing a tax credit
of up to $250 for college tuition and another that
would have provided additional tax cuts of $164.5
billion in 1980 through 1983 if Congress held down
the growth of federal spending.
The business tax cuts in the package include
cutting the maximum tax on corporate profits t046
percent and the lowest rate to 17 percent, and
liberalizing the 10-percent investment tax credit.
Emissary to talk with Hussein
Washington — President Jimmy Carter sent an
emissary to Jordan yesterday in a renewed effort to
persuade King Hussein to join Middle East peace
talks.
Harold Saunders, the assistant secretary of state
forthe Near East, was carrying replies tosometwo
dozen questions raised by Hussein about last
month's Camp David accords.
Hussein two weeks ago said his price for joining
the talks included full American participation and
redefinition of the framework for negotiations
over the future of the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza Strip.
Hussein's questions touched on Jerusalem and
part of the Golan Heights won by Israel in 1967 and
on Palestinian self-determination. "We will not
rush into any process without knowing exactly
where it is going to lead us," Hussein said.
Airlines to be given rate freedom
Washington — President Jimmy Carter received
from Congress yesterday the legislation he asked
for to give airlines more freedom to compete by
cutting fares and serving additional cities.
A compromise version of the bill was passed by
the House, completing congressional action. It
passed the Senate Saturday.
The measure allows airlines to cut fares by as
much as 50 percent without seeking the authority
of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
It will also allow them to embark on a limited
number of new routes each year without CAB ap
proval.
The CAB's authority over routes, rates, fares and
mergers would be phased out and the agency
would be discontinued in 1985 unless Congress
decided to keep it going.
Although the CAB in recent months has encour
aged reduced fares, its critics argue that for many
years it has unduly protected existing airlines from
new competitors and from fare competition.
Portugal seeks entry to EEC
Lisbon, Portugal — Seeking shelter from political
and economic storms, Portugal opens negotia
tions tomorrow in a bid to join the Common Mar
ket, a move expected to spurvast social changes in

Western Europe's poorest country.
A speech by Foreign Minister Carlos Correia
Cago to the Common Market's ministerial council
in Luxembourg will launch discussions intended
to secure Portuguese membership before 1985.
Detailed bargaining begins in January, less than a
year after the Common Market declared Portugal
was welcome to join.
Common Market and Portuguese officials said
in interviews last week there will be clear political
benefits for both sides.
The economic impact is less clear. Economists
say the nine need for fear competition from the
comparatively limited Portuguese farm and factory
production. But Portugal will require substantial
EEC assistance, and its 10 million residents will
offer the industrialized northern nations a rela
tively small market.
Canadians to judge Trudeau
Ottawa — Canadians pass judgment on Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his government
today in a series of special parliamentary elections
that may forecast his fate in next year's national
campaign.
Canada's sagging economy has been the do
minant issue, but the Quebec separatist move
ment and Trudeau's personal leadership are key
elements in the background.
Fifteen empty seats among the House of Com
mons' 264 electoral districts are up for grabs in the
by-elections, and opposition spokesmen say a
poor showing by Trudeau's governing Liberal
Party will increase pressure on the prime minister
to resign.
But Trudeau, 59 years old next Wednesday and
prime minister for the past 10 years, insists he will
stay on to lead the Liberals into the national elec
tions set for next spring.
Yankees win; lead series 3-2
New York — Rookie Jim Beattie pitched his first
complete game in the major leagues and catcher
Thurman Munson drove in five runs with three hits
as the New York Yankees capitalized on shoddy
Los Angeles fielding and ripped the Dodgers 12-2
in yesterday's fifth game of the 1978 World Series.
Roy White drove in three runs while Mickey
Rivers, Brian Doyle and Bucky Dent cracked three
hits each as the Yankees took a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven series by winning three straight at
home after dropping the first two games at Los
Angeles.
Today's weather
Low clouds night and morning hours but mostly
sunny afternoons through tomorrow. Continued
cool. Lows in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
60s to mid 70s. Small craft advisory afternoons and
evenings for westerly winds 15 to 30 mph.

percent and the lowest rate to 17 percent, and
liberalizing the 10-percent investment tax credit.
Emissary to talk with Hussein
Washington — President Jimmy Carter sent an
emissary to Jordan yesterday in a renewed effort to
persuade King Hussein to join Middle East peace
talks.
Harold Saunders, the assistant secretary of state
forthe Near East, was carrying replies tosometwo
dozen questions raised by Hussein about last
month's Camp David accords.
Hussein two weeks ago said his price for joining
the talks included full American participation and
redefinition of the framework for negotiations
over the future of the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza Strip.
Hussein's questions touched on Jerusalem and
part of the Golan Heights won by Israel in 1967 and
on Palestinian self-determination. "We will not
rush into any process without knowing exactly
where it is going to lead us," Hussein said.
Airlines to be given rate freedom
Washington — President Jimmy Carter received
from Congress yesterday the legislation he asked
for to give airlines more freedom to compete by
cutting fares and serving additional cities.
A compromise version of the bill was passed by
the House, completing congressional action. It
passed the Senate Saturday.
The measure allows airlines to cut fares by as
much as 50 percent without seeking the authority
of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
It will also allow them to embark on a limited
number of new routes each year without CAB ap
proval.
The CAB's authority over routes, rates, fares and
mergers would be phased out and the agency
would be discontinued in 1985 unless Congress
decided to keep it going.
Although the CAB in recent months has encour
aged reduced fares, its critics argue that for many
years it has unduly protected existing airlines from
new competitors and from fare competition.
Portugal seeks entry to EEC
Lisbon, Portugal — Seeking shelter from political
and economic storms, Portugal opens negotia
tions tomorrow in a bid to join the Common Mar
ket, a move expected to spurvast social changes in

Western Europe's poorest country.
A speech by Foreign Minister Carlos Correia
Cago to the Common Market's ministerial council
in Luxembourg will launch discussions intended
to secure Portuguese membership before 1985.
Detailed bargaining begins in January, less than a
year after the Common Market declared Portugal
was welcome to join.
Common Market and Portuguese officials said
in interviews last week there will be clear political
benefits for both sides.
The economic impact is less clear. Economists
say the nine need for fear competition from the
comparatively limited Portuguese farm and factory
production. But Portugal will require substantial
EEC assistance, and its 10 million residents will
offer the industrialized northern nations a rela
tively small market.
Canadians to judge Trudeau
Ottawa — Canadians pass judgment on Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his government
today in a series of special parliamentary elections
that may forecast his fate in next year's national
campaign.
Canada's sagging economy has been the do
minant issue, but the Quebec separatist move
ment and Trudeau's personal leadership are key
elements in the background.
Fifteen empty seats among the House of Com
mons' 264 electoral districts are up for grabs in the
by-elections, and opposition spokesmen say a
poor showing by Trudeau's governing Liberal
Party will increase pressure on the prime minister
to resign.
But Trudeau, 59 years old next Wednesday and
prime minister for the past 10 years, insists he will
stay on to lead the Liberals into the national elec
tions set for next spring.
Yankees win; lead series 3-2
New York — Rookie Jim Beattie pitched his first
complete game in the major leagues and catcher
Thurman Munson drove in five runs with three hits
as the New York Yankees capitalized on shoddy
Los Angeles fielding and ripped the Dodgers 12-2
in yesterday's fifth game of the 1978 World Series.
Roy White drove in three runs while Mickey
Rivers, Brian Doyle and Bucky Dent cracked three
hits each as the Yankees took a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven series by winning three straight at
home after dropping the first two games at Los
Angeles.
Today's weather
Low clouds night and morning hours but mostly
sunny afternoons through tomorrow. Continued
cool. Lows in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
60s to mid 70s. Small craft advisory afternoons and
evenings for westerly winds 15 to 30 mph.
Cardinals fail to pick new pope
Vatican City — Black smoke billowing into the
night from the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel
signaled to the world yesterday that the cardinals
of the Roman Catholic Church failed to elect a
successor to Pope John Paul I on the first day of
voting in their secret conclave.
Although there was no official explanation for
thefour inconclusive ballots, it appeared the coali
tion of conservative and progressive cardinals that
during the last conclave found a mutually accepta
ble candidate in Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice,
the former Pope John Paul, did not form around a
single cardinal this time.
Vatican analysts said Luciani attracted both con
servative and progressive cardinals because of his
pastoral simplicity.
The 111 cardinal-electors begin a second day of
voting today, with two ballots scheduled for the
morning and, if no pope is elected, two more in
the afternoon.
Energy bill passes with changes
Washington — Congress handed President
Jimmy Carter the biggest domestic victory of his
presidency yesterday, wearily approving a much
changed national energy plan first sent to Capitol
Hill 18 months ago.
The 95th Congress sent the White House a pac
kage that critics said will cost consumers too much
and produce few new energy reserves.
But the president praised the package, saying it
"will advance our national security, insure our
freedom of action in foreign affairs and protect our
economic interests at home and abroad."
Yet even its staunchest backers no longer claim
it will produce the changes in lifestyles once
suggested by the Carter administration.
Nor is it likely to bring the nation much closer to
energy self-sufficiency.
The five-part energy package is a far weaker one
than Carter sent to Congress on April 20, 1977 as
"the moral equivalent of war."
A multi-billion-dollar tax on crude oil, which
Carter once termed the centerpiece of the prog
ram, and a nickel-a-gallon tax on gasoline were
dropped as the measure worked its way through
Congress.
Congressional bill cuts taxes
Washington — Congress completed action yes
terday on an $18.7 billion bill that would cut taxes
for 65 million couples and individuals next year,
slash the capital gains tax and give a new break to
elderly Americans who sell their homes.
The measure now goes to the White House and
a top presidential aide said the president would
want to give it careful scrutiny before deciding
whether to sign it.
The final tax bill would give a $167 tax cut to a
typical four-member family with income of

$20,000, deductions totaling 23 percent of income
and a current tax bill of $2180.
Over objections of Republican members, the
conferees junked a provision allowing a tax credit
of up to $250 for college tuition and another that
would have provided additional tax cuts of $164.5
billion in 1980 through 1983 if Congress held down
the growth of federal spending.
The business tax cuts in the package include
cutting the maximum tax on corporate profits t046
percent and the lowest rate to 17 percent, and
liberalizing the 10-percent investment tax credit.

ment and Trudeau's personal leadership are key
elements in the background.
Fifteen empty seats among the House of Com
mons' 264 electoral districts are up for grabs in the
by-elections, and opposition spokesmen say a
poor showing by Trudeau's governing Liberal
Party will increase pressure on the prime minister
to resign.
But Trudeau, 59 years old next Wednesday and
prime minister for the past 10 years, insists he will
stay on to lead the Liberals into the national elec
tions set for next spring.
Yankees win; lead series 3-2
New York — Rookie Jim Beattie pitched his first
complete game in the major leagues and catcher
Thurman Munson drove in five runs with three hits
as the New York Yankees capitalized on shoddy
Los Angeles fielding and ripped the Dodgers 12-2
in yesterday's fifth game of the 1978 World Series.
Roy White drove in three runs while Mickey
Rivers, Brian Doyle and Bucky Dent cracked three
hits each as the Yankees took a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven series by winning three straight at
home after dropping the first two games at Los
Angeles.
Today's weather
Low clouds night and morning hours but mostly
sunny afternoons through tomorrow. Continued
cool. Lows in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
60s to mid 70s. Small craft advisory afternoons and
evenings for westerly winds 15 to 30 mph.
Cardinals fail to pick new pope
Vatican City — Black smoke billowing into the
night from the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel
signaled to the world yesterday that the cardinals
of the Roman Catholic Church failed to elect a
successor to Pope John Paul I on the first day of
voting in their secret conclave.
Although there was no official explanation for
thefour inconclusive ballots, it appeared the coali
tion of conservative and progressive cardinals that
during the last conclave found a mutually accepta
ble candidate in Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice,
the former Pope John Paul, did not form around a
single cardinal this time.
Vatican analysts said Luciani attracted both con
servative and progressive cardinals because of his
pastoral simplicity.
The 111 cardinal-electors begin a second day of
voting today, with two ballots scheduled for the
morning and, if no pope is elected, two more in
the afternoon.
Energy bill passes with changes
Washington — Congress handed President
Jimmy Carter the biggest domestic victory of his
presidency yesterday, wearily approving a much
changed national energy plan first sent to Capitol
Hill 18 months ago.
The 95th Congress sent the White House a pac
kage that critics said will cost consumers too much
and produce few new energy reserves.
But the president praised the package, saying it
"will advance our national security, insure our
freedom of action in foreign affairs and protect our
economic interests at home and abroad."
Yet even its staunchest backers no longer claim
it will produce the changes in lifestyles once
suggested by the Carter administration.
Nor is it likely to bring the nation much closer to
energy self-sufficiency.
The five-part energy package is a far weaker one
than Carter sent to Congress on April 20, 1977 as
"the moral equivalent of war."
A multi-billion-dollar tax on crude oil, which
Carter once termed the centerpiece of the prog
ram, and a nickel-a-gallon tax on gasoline were
dropped as the measure worked its way through
Congress.
Congressional bill cuts taxes
Washington — Congress completed action yes
terday on an $18.7 billion bill that would cut taxes
for 65 million couples and individuals next year,
slash the capital gains tax and give a new break to
elderly Americans who sell their homes.
The measure now goes to the White House and
a top presidential aide said the president would
want to give it careful scrutiny before deciding
whether to sign it.
The final tax bill would give a $167 tax cut to a
typical four-member family with income of

$20,000, deductions totaling 23 percent of income
and a current tax bill of $2180.
Over objections of Republican members, the
conferees junked a provision allowing a tax credit
of up to $250 for college tuition and another that
would have provided additional tax cuts of $164.5
billion in 1980 through 1983 if Congress held down
the growth of federal spending.
The business tax cuts in the package include
cutting the maximum tax on corporate profits t046
percent and the lowest rate to 17 percent, and
liberalizing the 10-percent investment tax credit.
Emissary to talk with Hussein
Washington — President Jimmy Carter sent an
emissary to Jordan yesterday in a renewed effort to
persuade King Hussein to join Middle East peace
talks.
Harold Saunders, the assistant secretary of state
forthe Near East, was carrying replies tosometwo
dozen questions raised by Hussein about last
month's Camp David accords.
Hussein two weeks ago said his price for joining
the talks included full American participation and
redefinition of the framework for negotiations
over the future of the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza Strip.
Hussein's questions touched on Jerusalem and
part of the Golan Heights won by Israel in 1967 and
on Palestinian self-determination. "We will not
rush into any process without knowing exactly
where it is going to lead us," Hussein said.
Airlines to be given rate freedom
Washington — President Jimmy Carter received
from Congress yesterday the legislation he asked
for to give airlines more freedom to compete by
cutting fares and serving additional cities.
A compromise version of the bill was passed by
the House, completing congressional action. It
passed the Senate Saturday.
The measure allows airlines to cut fares by as
much as 50 percent without seeking the authority
of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
It will also allow them to embark on a limited
number of new routes each year without CAB ap
proval.
The CAB's authority over routes, rates, fares and
mergers would be phased out and the agency
would be discontinued in 1985 unless Congress
decided to keep it going.
Although the CAB in recent months has encour
aged reduced fares, its critics argue that for many
years it has unduly protected existing airlines from
new competitors and from fare competition.
Portugal seeks entry to EEC
Lisbon, Portugal — Seeking shelter from political
and economic storms, Portugal opens negotia
tions tomorrow in a bid to join the Common Mar
ket, a move expected to spurvast social changes in

Western Europe's poorest country.
A speech by Foreign Minister Carlos Correia
Cago to the Common Market's ministerial council
in Luxembourg will launch discussions intended
to secure Portuguese membership before 1985.
Detailed bargaining begins in January, less than a
year after the Common Market declared Portugal
was welcome to join.
Common Market and Portuguese officials said
in interviews last week there will be clear political
benefits for both sides.
The economic impact is less clear. Economists
say the nine need for fear competition from the
comparatively limited Portuguese farm and factory
production. But Portugal will require substantial
EEC assistance, and its 10 million residents will
offer the industrialized northern nations a rela
tively small market.

Ottawa — Canadians pass judgment on Prime

energy self-sufficiency.
The five-part energy package is a far weaker one
than Carter sent to Congress on April 20, 1977 as
"the moral equivalent of war."
A multi-billion-dollar tax on crude oil, which
Carter once termed the centerpiece of the prog
ram, and a nickel-a-gallon tax on gasoline were
dropped as the measure worked its way through
Congress.
Congressional bill cuts taxes
Washington — Congress completed action yes
terday on an $18.7 billion bill that would cut taxes
for 65 million couples and individuals next year,
slash the capital gains tax and give a new break to
elderly Americans who sell their homes.
The measure now goes to the White House and
a top presidential aide said the president would
want to give it careful scrutiny before deciding
whether to sign it.
The final tax bill would give a $167 tax cut to a
typical four-member family with income of

$20,000, deductions totaling 23 percent of income
and a current tax bill of $2180.
Over objections of Republican members, the
conferees junked a provision allowing a tax credit
of up to $250 for college tuition and another that
would have provided additional tax cuts of $164.5
billion in 1980 through 1983 if Congress held down
the growth of federal spending.
The business tax cuts in the package include
cutting the maximum tax on corporate profits t046
percent and the lowest rate to 17 percent, and
liberalizing the 10-percent investment tax credit.
Emissary to talk with Hussein
Washington — President Jimmy Carter sent an
emissary to Jordan yesterday in a renewed effort to
persuade King Hussein to join Middle East peace
talks.
Harold Saunders, the assistant secretary of state
forthe Near East, was carrying replies tosometwo
dozen questions raised by Hussein about last
month's Camp David accords.
Hussein two weeks ago said his price for joining
the talks included full American participation and
redefinition of the framework for negotiations
over the future of the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza Strip.
Hussein's questions touched on Jerusalem and
part of the Golan Heights won by Israel in 1967 and
on Palestinian self-determination. "We will not
rush into any process without knowing exactly
where it is going to lead us," Hussein said.
Airlines to be given rate freedom
Washington — President Jimmy Carter received
from Congress yesterday the legislation he asked
for to give airlines more freedom to compete by
cutting fares and serving additional cities.
A compromise version of the bill was passed by
the House, completing congressional action. It
passed the Senate Saturday.
The measure allows airlines to cut fares by as
much as 50 percent without seeking the authority
of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
It will also allow them to embark on a limited
number of new routes each year without CAB ap
proval.
The CAB's authority over routes, rates, fares and
mergers would be phased out and the agency
would be discontinued in 1985 unless Congress
decided to keep it going.
Although the CAB in recent months has encour
aged reduced fares, its critics argue that for many
years it has unduly protected existing airlines from
new competitors and from fare competition.
Portugal seeks entry to EEC
Lisbon, Portugal — Seeking shelter from political
and economic storms, Portugal opens negotia
tions tomorrow in a bid to join the Common Mar
ket, a move expected to spurvast social changes in

Western Europe's poorest country.
A speech by Foreign Minister Carlos Correia
Cago to the Common Market's ministerial council
in Luxembourg will launch discussions intended
to secure Portuguese membership before 1985.
Detailed bargaining begins in January, less than a
year after the Common Market declared Portugal
was welcome to join.
Common Market and Portuguese officials said
in interviews last week there will be clear political
benefits for both sides.
The economic impact is less clear. Economists
say the nine need for fear competition from the
comparatively limited Portuguese farm and factory
production. But Portugal will require substantial
EEC assistance, and its 10 million residents will
offer the industrialized northern nations a rela
tively small market.
Canadians to judge Trudeau
Ottawa — Canadians pass judgment on Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his government
today in a series of special parliamentary elections
that may forecast his fate in next year's national
campaign.
Canada's sagging economy has been the do
minant issue, but the Quebec separatist move
ment and Trudeau's personal leadership are key
elements in the background.
Fifteen empty seats among the House of Com
mons' 264 electoral districts are up for grabs in the
by-elections, and opposition spokesmen say a
poor showing by Trudeau's governing Liberal
Party will increase pressure on the prime minister
to resign.
But Trudeau, 59 years old next Wednesday and
prime minister for the past 10 years, insists he will
stay on to lead the Liberals into the national elec
tions set for next spring.
