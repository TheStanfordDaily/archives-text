# Man receives third heart here
## 
### TOM HARRELL 
Heart surgeons here have drawn widespread atten
tion recently following a third heart transplant operation
on one patient performed at the Hospital less than two
weeks ago. What few students realize, however, is that
the University has long been considered the finest heart
transplant center in the world.
According to Bill Snyder, of the Medical Center News
Bureau, the first transplant done here occurred in
lanuary, 1968. It was the second heart transplant opera
tion performed in the United States and thefourth in the
world.
Since that time, surgeons here have performed 155
transplants. The University's success has generated in
terest elsewhere in a similar transplant program, most
notably at Columbia University and the University of
Minnesota. However, the University remains the only
center in the world which performs transplants on a
regular basis.
No other hospital in the United States has performed
more than four or five heart transplants, and no other
hospital in the world more than 30.
Dr. Philip Oyer, assistant professor of cardiovascular
surgery, attributes much of Stanford's reputation to Dr.
Norman Shumway, who developed the transplant
technique here. Although the 4- to 5-hour operation is
fairly straightforward, Oyer said, the post-operative re
covery period can be difficult and time-consuming for
the surgeon as well as the patient.
The operation which recently sparked interestin heart
transplants here involved Dr. Jerome Young of Philadel
phia, who received his third heart transplant Oct. 6.
Young's own heart was replaced first in 1976 because
of coronary heart disease. A second transplant was
needed after a recurrence of the original disease.
Young's second heart did not function strongly enough
to maintain body functions, necessitating a third trans
plant.
Young's second transplant was the ninth such per
formed here, and his third transplant was the first of its
kind in the world, according to Snyder.
Young is still at the Hospital recuperating from the

operation.
Oyer explained that transplants are needed because,
"There is a certain number of patients with heart disease
for which nothing medical or surgical can be offered,"
except for a transplant.
The odds for surviving the operation and returning to
an active life have steadily improved, noted Oyer, and
should continue to improve.
Cardiology department statistics show that the survi
val rate for transplant patients is now 69 percent for one
year. In contrast, only five percent of those requiring a
transplant who do not undergo surgery will live longer
than a year.
Because of the great stress and anxiety involved in
heart surgery, the University has developed a program
designed to meet the emotional needs of the patient and
family.
Lois Christopherson, chief clinical social worker, de
scribed the goal of the program to be one "to enable the
patient and key family members to understand the stres
ses and possible outcomes" of the surgery. Patients
meet with transplant recipients, recipient's families,
tour facilities, and meet with nurses and staff.
Oyer warned that complications can arise which may
lead to a second transplant. One danger is that the
transplanted heart may be rejected by the body. To
guard against this possibility patients are given large
doses of immunosuppressive drugs.
A second danger is hardening of the arteries which
may be caused by the operation itself, Dr. Oyer said. The
transplanted heart, a foreign body, may cause a low
grade reaction which adversely affects the blood ves
sels.
Most hearts used at the Hospital come from the Bay
Area, but some are flown in from as far away as Los
Angeles or Las Vegas, Nev. Usua'ly the heart is trans
planted directly from the donor to the recipient, but
sometimes the heart is transported here outside of the
body. To keep the heart healthy, it is flushed with and
stored in an electrolyte solution, then cooled to near
freezing.

meet with transplant recipients, recipient's families,
tour facilities, and meet with nurses and staff.
Oyer warned that complications can arise which may
lead to a second transplant. One danger is that the
transplanted heart may be rejected by the body. To
guard against this possibility patients are given large
doses of immunosuppressive drugs.
A second danger is hardening of the arteries which
may be caused by the operation itself, Dr. Oyer said. The
transplanted heart, a foreign body, may cause a low
grade reaction which adversely affects the blood ves
sels.
Most hearts used at the Hospital come from the Bay
Area, but some are flown in from as far away as Los
Angeles or Las Vegas, Nev. Usua'ly the heart is trans
planted directly from the donor to the recipient, but
sometimes the heart is transported here outside of the
body. To keep the heart healthy, it is flushed with and
stored in an electrolyte solution, then cooled to near
freezing.
Heart surgeons here have drawn widespread atten
tion recently following a third heart transplant operation
on one patient performed at the Hospital less than two
weeks ago. What few students realize, however, is that
the University has long been considered the finest heart
transplant center in the world.
According to Bill Snyder, of the Medical Center News
Bureau, the first transplant done here occurred in
lanuary, 1968. It was the second heart transplant opera
tion performed in the United States and thefourth in the
world.
Since that time, surgeons here have performed 155
transplants. The University's success has generated in
terest elsewhere in a similar transplant program, most
notably at Columbia University and the University of
Minnesota. However, the University remains the only
center in the world which performs transplants on a
regular basis.
No other hospital in the United States has performed
more than four or five heart transplants, and no other
hospital in the world more than 30.
Dr. Philip Oyer, assistant professor of cardiovascular
surgery, attributes much of Stanford's reputation to Dr.
Norman Shumway, who developed the transplant
technique here. Although the 4- to 5-hour operation is
fairly straightforward, Oyer said, the post-operative re
covery period can be difficult and time-consuming for
the surgeon as well as the patient.
The operation which recently sparked interestin heart
transplants here involved Dr. Jerome Young of Philadel
phia, who received his third heart transplant Oct. 6.
Young's own heart was replaced first in 1976 because
of coronary heart disease. A second transplant was
needed after a recurrence of the original disease.
Young's second heart did not function strongly enough
to maintain body functions, necessitating a third trans
plant.
Young's second transplant was the ninth such per
formed here, and his third transplant was the first of its
kind in the world, according to Snyder.
Young is still at the Hospital recuperating from the

operation.
Oyer explained that transplants are needed because,
"There is a certain number of patients with heart disease
for which nothing medical or surgical can be offered,"
except for a transplant.
The odds for surviving the operation and returning to
an active life have steadily improved, noted Oyer, and
should continue to improve.
Cardiology department statistics show that the survi
val rate for transplant patients is now 69 percent for one
year. In contrast, only five percent of those requiring a
transplant who do not undergo surgery will live longer
than a year.
Because of the great stress and anxiety involved in
heart surgery, the University has developed a program
designed to meet the emotional needs of the patient and
family.
Lois Christopherson, chief clinical social worker, de
scribed the goal of the program to be one "to enable the
patient and key family members to understand the stres
ses and possible outcomes" of the surgery. Patients
meet with transplant recipients, recipient's families,
tour facilities, and meet with nurses and staff.
