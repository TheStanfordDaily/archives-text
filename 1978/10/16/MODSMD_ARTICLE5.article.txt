# Cal students pay less for textbooks
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Most students here regularly buy
textbooks and stationery at the
Bookstore, either by choice or be
cause no other store carries Univer
sity course reading material.
But Bookstore General Manager
Eldon Speed said the Bookstore does
not take advantage of its convenient
location to raise prices beyond what
generally prevails.

News analysis

The Berkeley ASUC (Associated
Students of the University of Califor
nia) store operates in a less
monopolistic situation than the
Bookstore. An ASUC manager said
the ASUC's prices for stationery and
supplies are kept down by heavy
competition from other stores in

Berkeley. There is also a plethora of
textbook stores dealing in new and
used books, unlike here.
Cal students pay less
Apparently the typical UC-
Berkeley student spends about half
as much on textbooks as his coun
terpart here, according to a recent
spot sampling of both groups.
While most undergraduates here
spent $80 to $110 on textbooks this
past quarter, $40 to $50 was usually
sufficient at Berkeley.
Speed attributed this difference to
the faculty's requiring more books
here than at Cal, "perhaps because
this is a more scholarly place." Speed
claimed the Bookstore charges the
publisher's list price for all its books.
Stationery is cheaper at the ASUC
store than at the Bookstore. For in
stance, a Bic pen priced at 21 cents
here sells for 15 cen's there, and an

80-sheet notebook marked at 89
cents here is 79 cents across the Bay.
Some items, such as staples and
tacks, cost the same and a few are
more expensive (a yellow highlighter
for example).
Speed said he was surprised to
learn of the difference, saying that
the Bookstore "endeavors to be at
least competitive." He explained that
technical and course books are sold
on very small profit margins, so that
all the book departments actually
lose money. The stationery and clo
thing sections must operate in the
black to keep the Bookstore solvent,
Speed said.
Bookstore non-profit
The Bookstore is a non-profit cor
poration run independently of the
University. It pays $116,000 annually
in lease fees.
Speed said the Bookstore usually
distributes its operating profit to the
public in the form of rebates or dis
counts to students. Lately, however,
it has not had any apparent profit be
cause the store is repaying the $2
million loan it took to build its new
building, he added.
The ASUC store's annual $500,000
profit, from total sales nearly equal to
the Bookstore's, helps finance stu
dent activities. The ASUC store is
under the ultimate control of the Cal
student senate and is located in the
Student Union building.

Speed said he was surprised to
learn of the difference, saying that
the Bookstore "endeavors to be at
least competitive." He explained that
technical and course books are sold
on very small profit margins, so that
all the book departments actually
lose money. The stationery and clo
thing sections must operate in the
black to keep the Bookstore solvent,
Speed said.
Bookstore non-profit
The Bookstore is a non-profit cor
poration run independently of the
University. It pays $116,000 annually
in lease fees.
Speed said the Bookstore usually
distributes its operating profit to the
public in the form of rebates or dis
counts to students. Lately, however,
it has not had any apparent profit be
cause the store is repaying the $2
million loan it took to build its new
building, he added.
The ASUC store's annual $500,000
profit, from total sales nearly equal to
the Bookstore's, helps finance stu
dent activities. The ASUC store is
under the ultimate control of the Cal
student senate and is located in the
Student Union building.
Most students here regularly buy
textbooks and stationery at the
Bookstore, either by choice or be
cause no other store carries Univer
sity course reading material.
But Bookstore General Manager
Eldon Speed said the Bookstore does
not take advantage of its convenient
location to raise prices beyond what
generally prevails.

News analysis

The Berkeley ASUC (Associated
Students of the University of Califor
nia) store operates in a less
monopolistic situation than the
Bookstore. An ASUC manager said
the ASUC's prices for stationery and
supplies are kept down by heavy
competition from other stores in

Berkeley. There is also a plethora of
textbook stores dealing in new and
used books, unlike here.
Cal students pay less
Apparently the typical UC-
Berkeley student spends about half
as much on textbooks as his coun
terpart here, according to a recent
spot sampling of both groups.
While most undergraduates here
spent $80 to $110 on textbooks this
past quarter, $40 to $50 was usually
sufficient at Berkeley.
Speed attributed this difference to
the faculty's requiring more books
here than at Cal, "perhaps because
this is a more scholarly place." Speed
claimed the Bookstore charges the
publisher's list price for all its books.
Stationery is cheaper at the ASUC
store than at the Bookstore. For in
stance, a Bic pen priced at 21 cents
here sells for 15 cen's there, and an

80-sheet notebook marked at 89
cents here is 79 cents across the Bay.
Some items, such as staples and
tacks, cost the same and a few are
more expensive (a yellow highlighter
for example).
