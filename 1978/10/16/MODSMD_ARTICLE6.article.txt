# Turnout deemed 'unimpressive'
## CRAP loses by big margin 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
After the attempt to eliminate the
ASSU Senate failed in last week's
election, junior Ron Johnson led a
field of 26 undergraduates and Geoff
Baskir topped the 10 graduates, ac
cording to the unofficial tallies com
piled by Elections Commissioner
Will Nixon.
The constitutional amendment to
abolish the senate, termed CRAP by
its supporters, failed by a vote of 904
to 1382. It needed a two-thirds major
ity to pass.
Ten regular undergraduate
senators were elected, along with 10
alternates. Because only 10 students
were running in the graduate divi
sion, no alternates were chosen.
This senate will be the first in three
years not controlled by a large slate.
The only large group running, the
so-called Guano slate, won only a
single seat.
Three students were elected to the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC), a body empowered to alter
the honor code and other parts of the
legislative and judicial charter.
Student opinion on the non
binding referendum, which asked
whether the ASSU should remove its
funds from the total University in
vestment pool, was almost evenly di
vided, 867 votes for and 839 against
the move.
The $1 KZSU fee assessment was
leading 2033 to 401, but such assess
ments require that 20 percent of the
student body vote for the assessment
to be valid. Presently, the KZSU as
sessment is 40 votes short of the
necessary 2474 with the overseas bal
lots yet to be received.
Nixon said that approximately 220
ballots were sent to the Stanford
overseas campuses. Last year, about
100 were returned. He said he hopes
for -at least that many this year.
The overseas ballots also may shift
the standings of some of the
senators-elect, according to Nixon.
"I don't think it will affect the lead
ers," he said, "but last year three

people got pushed in" with the over
seas ballot votes.
Nixon said the election results will
become official when the senate
votes to certify them at their first
meeting this year.
Nixon said he was "not impressed
at all" with the election turnout.
Only about 2400 students voted,
while last year 3306 came to the polls,
lohnson, the top vote-getter, re
corded 871 votes, as opposed to last
year's high of 999.
Considerably fewer graduates
voted. Last year the number 10
graduate senator tallied 103 votes
and the high was 200. This year Geoff
Baskir led with 104 and Robert Shear
trailed with only 38.
There are no immediate plans to
deal with the lack of any graduate
alternate senators. Council of Presi
dents member Fred Estes said, "we

are looking for precedent and we are
looking for a good solution."
Nixon said this election was run
with a budget of $1400. More than
half that sum, $800, was used for the
pollwatchers salaries, vote counters
and the three elections commission
ers. Only $100 was allocated to the
printing of the voters' guide, the
booklet explaining candidates' posi
tions and giving pros and cons on the
ballot measures, he added.
In past years, voters' guides have
been distributed under every door in
the dorms. This year, however, only
400 were printed. Nixon said this was
because last year's senate thought
they were a "waste of money" and no
money was allocated for them.
The master ballots, the sheets on
which students mark their votes, had
only a very cursory description of the
