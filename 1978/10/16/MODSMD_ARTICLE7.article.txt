# Jacobs' unwanted win
## 
### 
This morning at 7:30 European
time, Caryn Jacobs learned she had
been elected to the ASSU Senate.
She responded, "What senate?"
Apparently someone forged
Jacob's name on a candidate petition
and circulated it, gathering enough
signatures to place Jacobs on the bal
lot â€” all while she was attending
Stanford's overseas campus in Tours,
France. Jacobs denied any know
ledge of her "candidacy."
"I have no conception of how this
could have happened," she said.
Though the Jacobs campaign
printed no posters, distributed no
literature, and gave no comment in
the brochure of candidate state
ments, she managed to garner 322
votes, enough to win the tenth spot
on the senate.
Jacobs and Suzanne Whipple were
the only women on the ballot. Both
won.
Elections Commission Will Nixon
said it would be possible to run, or
"be run,"from overseas. Fie said

there is only one form on which the
candidate's signature is required.
lacobs, who said adamantly that
she has 110 desire to serve on the
senate, insisted someone must have
forged her signature on the petition.
She asked who would "do such a
thing."
lacobs is currently awaiting the ar
rival of her overseas ballot, which
she says she has not yet seen. On the
ballot she will see for the first time in
print that she was indeed a candidate
for this year's ASSU Senate.
