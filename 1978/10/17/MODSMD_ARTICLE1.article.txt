Energy convervation center exhibit
In an effort to increase community awareness of energy conservation, a trailer exhibit from the Office of
Appropriate Technology (OAT) visited campus for the past two days. A part of the Governor's Office of Planning
and Research, the traveling display makes appearances at fairs and shopping centers to teach the public about
solar energy and water-saving devices. Also present in front of Tresidder was a display prepared by the
University's Energy Conservation Center. Headed by Karl lohnson, a '77 product design graduate here, the
Crothers-oased organization manages campus-wide conservation efforts.
