# Conference explores sex segregation

### RACHEL BAGBY 
"The division of labor by sex
is inequitable and inefficient."
This comment by Myra
Strober, assistant professor in
the Graduate School of Busi
ness, reflects one of the main
topics of a conference on
segregation by sex held here
last weekend.
The conference, sponsored
by the Center for Research on
Women (CROW), involved
nearly 50 researchers on wo
men's studies. Three lecturers,
including Strober, presented
their studies on sex segrega

tion in the work force, in child
hood and in non-American
societies.
Strober discussed occupa
tional segregation, saying it "is
inefficient because society
makes less than maximum use
of women's talents," she said.
On the average, women earn
30 percent less than men with
comparable education and ex
perience.
Strober presented an occu
pational landscape — a "sex
map of the work world" — to
illustrate changes in women's
position in the U.S. labor force
since 1920. She said the
number of working women has
increased from one-third of
the female population in 1950
to almost one-half in 1978.
Meanwhile, the number of
working wives has doubled
since 1950. But studies have
shown their husbands aren't
doing more housework than
they did in the past.
"Married women have little
or no leisure time," Strober
said. "This is unfair to them
and may possibly damage the
career motivation of younger
women who witness this."
Still, the number of women
pursuing medical, accounting,
managerial and legal careers
has substantially and continu
ally increased since 1950. "Our
move to a market economy and
from rural to urban living may
partially explain women's in
creased participation in the
labor force." An increase in the
levels of education obtained by
women makes it easier for
them to enter the work force
and demand higher wages.
But while women are in
creasing the size of the work
labor force, men don't seem to
be losing their jobs to the
emerging females.
According to Strober, men
don't like to work in occupa
tions that have become
"feminized." Such occupa
tions "tend to have little pre
stige and offer lower wages."
Thus, "an increase of women

in the labor force does not
necessarily mean a decrease in
occupational segregation
Those women who do enter
"male-typed" fields experi
ence lack of colleague support
and professional isolation, she
added. "These factors tend to
hinder integration of the sexes
in the labor force," Strober
said.
According to Psychology
Prof. Eleanor Maccoby,
"segregation of the sexes be
gins in childhood." Speaking
on childhood sex segregation,
Maccoby added, "studies of
child care centers indicate that
children tend to choose
playmates of the same sex
without inducement of parents
or teachers."
A possible explanation for
this behavior is that "children
already possess preferences
for sex-typed toys by the time
they enter nursery schools,"
Maccoby said. In addition
there is "something compati
ble about the way children of
the same sex play."
To study this theory, Mac
coby and Senior Research As
sociate Carol Jacklin observed
the play patterns of same-sex
trios in an experiment con
ducted here.
While the girls' groups were
as active as the boys' none of
the girls were "as riotous,"
Maccoby said. The girls were
"natural politicians, making up
rules and arguing about whose
turn it was to play, but the boys
wrestled for possession of the
objects.
"There is some evidence that
fathers tend to engage in rough
and tumble play much more
with boys than they do with
girls," Maccoby explained.
However, it is unclear
whether "fathers do this be
cause sons like it more than
daughters or rather sons like it
more because fathers do this.
We have a real chicken-egg
problem here," Maccoby said.
"Still, we must not assume that
fathers rough and tumble with

their sons in an attempt to
make them masculine."
According to Maccoby, peer
pressure is more responsible
for maintaining children's sex
segregation than parental con
duct. "Children between the
ages of 6 and 8 are ruthlessly
sexist," she said, adding that
they try to conform to what
other children expect of them
because they're afraid of being
teased or ridiculed.
Joyce Justus, anthropology
professor at UC-San Diego,"
discussed the differences bet
ween American and Jamaican
women's reactions to sex
segregation.
"West Indian women are
more segregated and isolated
than American women," Justus
said. "There are two societies
— one male, one female — and
women are ignored in the pub
lic arena."
However, the female figure
occupies a central role in West
Indian families, said Justus. Al
though men are the major
economic contributors to the
family, Jamaican women
"don't have a feeling of subor
dination as do many American
women." Justus added that
black American women are
similar to West Indian women
in this regard.
"This is an outgrowth of
slavery and colonialsim. These
women have always had to be
stronger," she said.
Strong sexual socialization
begins in childhood, Justus
said. "Little girls are sur
rounded by other females
most of their waking hours.
This may also be true in
America."
However, once Jamaican
women have become accus
tomed to being separated, they
"use that separation to build
solidarity. From this comes a
strong sense of identity." Jus
tus continued, "Women then
manipulate their environment
to the best of their advantage,
knowing they can turn to other
women for support."
