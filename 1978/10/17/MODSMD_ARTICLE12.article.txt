# Village Center: 'nucleus' of Escondido
## 
### JENNY SMITH 
A small, yellow house sits
unobtrusively off Escondido
Road across from Bing Nursery
School. The house is a quiet,
comfortable place. It is also the
nucleus of Escondido Village.
The Village Center serves the
University's married students.
Escondido Village is a living
area for graduate students —
single and married; with chil
dren and without — as well as
some married undergraduates.

There are 1145 apartments
combined in the high and low
rise buildings. Well over half of
these are two or three bed
room units for families. Ap
proximately 42 percent of the
residents come from froeign
nations. The Village Center is
the focal point for this diverse
population.
The center opend in July,
1974. It is sponsored by the
University YWCA and various
Palo Alto organizations. Ac

cording to Program Director
Kathryn Kalashian, the center is
a unique place which attends
to many different needs.
One of the most popular
programs that the center offers
is a class teaching English as a
second language (ESL). The
center provides care to chil
dren whose.parents are enrol
led in the three-hour, daily
class. "This class is very impor
tant for the foreign residents,"
Kalashian said. "We try to ac

climate them to our culture in a
more personal way." The
center organizes its child care
program as a cooperative nur
sery school. Parents teach the
children on a rotating basis,
each parent donating some
time each week to school ac
tivities. Hence, parents and
other Escondido Village volun
teers are able to become in
volved in the community. "The
nursery school provides a great
sharing experience for parents
and children. They can really
mix with each other," Kalas
hian said.
Village residents can be
come involved in many
center-sponsored programs.
Students and their spouses
share skills by teaching classes
such as gymnastics and singing
for children. Students also lead
rapgroupsforadults. An exotic
aroma wafting from the cent
er's kitchen is a sure sign that
the international cooking class
is an progress.
One of the center's most
successful programs, accord
ing to many residents, is the
Court Coffee Program. Family
residences are organized into
approximately eight houses
per court or unit. "I load up a
golf cart with a card table, a pot
of coffee and some cookies,
and I knock on doors," said
Kalashian. "It is one of the few
times when residents of a court
can get together and just talk.
They become better ac
quainted, and I can get to know
them and find out what the
center can do for them."
Opinions about Escondido
Village and the center are as
varied as the residents who
voice them. An Israeli couple

with two children came here
when the center was three
months old. They felt "uncom
fortable about the lack of in
formation available" to them.
Now, the center offers a refer
ral service providing informa
tion on many topics, from pre
school education to good buys
on a vacuum cleaner.
Marti and Gary Scudder have
just begun their second year
here. Scudder is a Ph.D. candi
date in industrial engineering;
Mrs. Scudder works for an ar
chitectural firm in San Fran
cisco.
She is a peer counselor at the
center. "I've gotten to know
quite a few people through
that," she said. "Without it, I
wouldn't be related to Stanford
at all."
According to the Scudders
and some of their firends, the
center does not publicize itself
enough. "If you asked anyone
else on our floor," Scudder
said, "they may not know
what's over there. They may
not even know which building
is the Village Center."
On the other hand, Larry
Hansen, Ph.D. candidate in
geo-technical engineering,
appreciates the "low profile
the center keeps. "There is so
much available at the center,
but there is no real push like so
many community centers," he
said. "It's very low-key. They
let you know what's there, but
they don't have to sell them
selves."
