## Staff Perspective Ballot confusion 
### 
I'm dismayed.
When I voted in ASSU elections
Thursday I found the ballot unfor
giveably vague — especially in an
election in which the very existence
of the senate was at stake.
Listed below the names of the se
nate and SCLC candidates were two
entries:
Proposed Constitutional Amend
ment — yes — no, Referendum —
yes — no.
That's it. No explanation, no at
tempt to describe or to list the word
ing of either measure on the ballot
itself.
After checking with other students
I learned that a sheet describing the
ballot measures evidently had been
printed for distribution to the voters.
Those sheets were either nonexis
tent or well hidden at the poll where
I voted.
Instead the pollwatcher was doing
a fine job of explaining the ballot
measures to the interested voters.
I'm pleased the pollwatcher was able
to answer those questions, but that
should never be the pollwatcher's
task.
When voting in a presidential elec
tion, the pollwatcher does not brief
the voter on the pros and cons of
proposed measures or on the elec
toral stands of each candidate.
The elections commission may
have assumed this senate race had
been given enough publicity. I disag
ree. The yes/no format was ambigu
ous — even if the voter were suffi
ciently informed to know what the
measures entailed, confusion could
still arise over the result of a yes or no
vote.
Whether one agreed with the
proposals, at least the wording of the
measures or a brief encapsulation of
the proposals should have been

printed on the ballot.
And the referendum. Yes it's true
that it was a non-binding referendum
designed to acquaint the senate with
the student body's feelings on the
withdrawal of several hundred
thousand dollars of ASSU money
from the University's investment
pool — some of which is invested in
companies doing business in South
Africa.
But was there an attempt on the
ballot to explain to the voter what
that action would entail? No, and
perhaps that explains the meager
vote on that issue — only 1700
people bothered to vote on the re
ferendum at all.
Withdrawing the ASSU funds from
the general merge pool would mean
losing annual ASSU dividends re
ceived from those investments. It
would require that the student fi
nancial manager — each year a new
student — be entrusted to
both wisely and economically invest
the ASSU funds. Even given a re
sponsible and competent financial
manager, it may be asking a lot to
expect a student to produce
adequate yearly dividends, when he
or she hasn't the time nor the experi
ence of the University's financial
analysts.
I'm sure the election commission
attempted to run a good election.
Placing a voter booth in Meyer Lib
rary during the evening was an excel
lent idea. But I question some of the
other election procedures — CRAP
failed and the referendum was ap
proved by an uninterpretable 28
votes.
I wonder how much of the vote
was random choice and how much
was ignorance of the issues.

printed for distribution to the voters.
Those sheets were either nonexis
tent or well hidden at the poll where
I voted.
Instead the pollwatcher was doing
a fine job of explaining the ballot
measures to the interested voters.
I'm pleased the pollwatcher was able
to answer those questions, but that
should never be the pollwatcher's
task.
When voting in a presidential elec
tion, the pollwatcher does not brief
the voter on the pros and cons of
proposed measures or on the elec
toral stands of each candidate.
The elections commission may
have assumed this senate race had
been given enough publicity. I disag
ree. The yes/no format was ambigu
ous — even if the voter were suffi
ciently informed to know what the
measures entailed, confusion could
still arise over the result of a yes or no
vote.
Whether one agreed with the
proposals, at least the wording of the
measures or a brief encapsulation of
the proposals should have been

printed on the ballot.
And the referendum. Yes it's true
that it was a non-binding referendum
designed to acquaint the senate with
the student body's feelings on the
withdrawal of several hundred
thousand dollars of ASSU money
from the University's investment
pool — some of which is invested in
companies doing business in South
Africa.
But was there an attempt on the
ballot to explain to the voter what
that action would entail? No, and
perhaps that explains the meager
vote on that issue — only 1700
people bothered to vote on the re
ferendum at all.
Withdrawing the ASSU funds from
the general merge pool would mean
losing annual ASSU dividends re
ceived from those investments. It
would require that the student fi
nancial manager — each year a new
student — be entrusted to
both wisely and economically invest
the ASSU funds. Even given a re
sponsible and competent financial
manager, it may be asking a lot to
expect a student to produce
adequate yearly dividends, when he
or she hasn't the time nor the experi
ence of the University's financial
analysts.
I'm sure the election commission
attempted to run a good election.
Placing a voter booth in Meyer Lib
rary during the evening was an excel
lent idea. But I question some of the
other election procedures — CRAP
failed and the referendum was ap
proved by an uninterpretable 28
votes.
I wonder how much of the vote
was random choice and how much
was ignorance of the issues.

When I voted in ASSU elections
Thursday I found the ballot unfor
giveably vague — especially in an
election in which the very existence
of the senate was at stake.
Listed below the names of the se
nate and SCLC candidates were two
entries:
Proposed Constitutional Amend
ment — yes — no, Referendum —
yes — no.
That's it. No explanation, no at
tempt to describe or to list the word
ing of either measure on the ballot
itself.
After checking with other students
I learned that a sheet describing the
ballot measures evidently had been
printed for distribution to the voters.

tent or well hidden at the poll where
I voted.
