Betrayal of justice
I have read Michael
Ecpnomides' column (Daily,
Oct. 9). It is an excellent
analysis of the situation in
Pakistan. However, any other
verdict would have been out of
character for the judiciary
which during the past 25 years
has invariably taken the side of
anti-democratic and uncon
stitutional forces that have
ruled Pakistan.
The rot in Pakistan's body
politic set in during the early
'50s when the federal court
legitimized the governor gen
eral's dismissal of the cabinet
enjoying majority support in
Parliament.
The judiciary has since been
behind every despot like Gen.
Tia who it upon himself to
save Pakistan from its elected
representatives.* Under Ayuh
Khan's rule the chief justice
publicly advocated the ampu
tation of hands and other so
called Islamic punishments
without ever emphasizing the
enforcement of Islamic social
justice. Gen. Yahya Khan had
the advice of a former judge in
the constitutional crises of
1971. And now in 1978, five

judges of the Lahore High
Court say the man who led the
country from the debacle of
1971 to prosperity and strength
is a common criminal, incom
petent and unfit to have ever
been Prime Minister. Pakistan
may not survive this betrayal of
basic democratic values and
justice.

SAT scores
and literacy
I have read with interest
Michael Imber's essay "Are
declining SAT scores a real
problem?" (Daily, Oct. 13).
Imber concludes that they are
not. He suggests that high SAT
scores, like high moral stan
dards, are not desireable "in
and of themselves."
On a previous page of the
same issue, I found an equally
interesting item, in your "Bug
Me" column: "Whatever hap
pend to all that oak paneling
that was in the old history
corner?" one of your readers
asks. "The wood paneling
went with the demolition of
the building," "Bug Me"

briskly responds, and then
goes on to give a perfectly de
lightful explanation of what is
in store for the old history
corner: "Wane Scott oak
paneling" and "rod iron stair
case railings."
Who cares about SAT
scores? Let a thousand
wildflowers of illiteracy bloom,
in and of themselves!

Added perspective
Thank you, Alex Kline. Your
letter "Thoughts on Stanford"
(Daily, Oct. 4) gave me some
perspective and even added
some humor on being another
"little fish" on campus.
Whether it matters greatly to
you or not now, you are very
special, and are well on your
way to that "liberal educa
tion."

A worthy cause
supported
Jon Reider's response (Daily,
Oct. 11) to Prof. Krumboltz's
criticism of the Daily's cartoon
series satirizing P.E. majors was
apropos. Not only, as Reider
pointed out, are there no P.E.
majors on campus, but the fact
is that even if there were, they
surely would not need Prof.
Krumboltz to protect their
pride, since it is widely known
that they have none (a standard
prerequisite for declaring
Phys. Ed.).
In his suggestion to Prof.
Krumboltz that he defend a
more worthy cause, namely
that of short people, I see
Reider is still actively pursuing
his Fight Against Reactionary
Tallism (modesty prohibits me
from using its acronym). Keep
at it, Jon! I'm a devout (i.e.
5'1") supporter of your cause.

Prop. 6
and curriculum
We (the staff of Humanities
61) cannot address ourselves
here to every aspect of the pre
sent controversy, as described
in the Daily (Oct. 6), concern
ing the Briggs Initiative —
Proposition 6 on the California
ballot. We would like to point
out a few facts, however,
which bear on the question of

how the initiative, if approved
by California voters, may affect
the quality of humanistic edu
cation in this state.
The authors of Proposition 6
have defined "homosexual
conduct" in such a way as to
comprehend "acts, words, or
deeds . . . which would tend to
encourage, promote, or dis
pose" students to similar con
duct (once again including
words, presumably). If the re
strictions proposed by the
Briggs Initiative in order to
eliminate such "conduct" on
the part of teachers were to be
applied to higher education —
and who can assure us that
they never will be so applied? —
we would be forced to make
major alterations in the under
graduate Humanities cur
riculum. We would be obliged
to drop whole works of Plato,
portions of Virgil and Ovid,
and many passages of Aris
tophanes from our reading list.
We would not even be able to
remark, for fear of prosecution
under the law, that if Peridean
Athens had had a version of
Proposition 6 among its sta
tutes, the philosophical activity
of Socrates and, along with it,
the entire tradition of Western
rationality would have been
stifled in its infancy.
Socrates might well have ag
reed with John Briggs in stres
sing the importance for proper
education of a teacher's per
sonal example. But, as Socrates
amply demonstrated by his
own example, the human qual
ities necessary to a good
teacher are numerous and
complex, and matters of sexual
identity do not figure among
them.
