## Adopt ERA, not the extension 
### 
In my last column (Daily, Oct. 10), I
stressed the urgency for the ratification,
adoption and enactment of the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) — to this line of
argument I still hold. However, the Se
nate's recent decision to extend the ERA's
date of ratification by 39 months indicates
that a muddling of issues has occured,and
so clarification is required.
Two issues
Two individual and yet obviously related
issues are at hand — adoption of the ERA
and extention of the ratification deadline.
Each must be dealt with separately.
As pointed out in the first editorial, the
ERA, promising to promote simple justice
and equality, should be adopted. In a na
tion that prides itself on the fact that "all
'men' are created equal" and in the tradi
tion of the sth, 14th, and 19th Amend
ments, this proposal to eliminate the role
of sex as a determining factor in the legal
rights of men and women — to promote
equality under the law — seems only a
natural course, and is clearly in accord
with our historical, mora! and constitu
tional committments.
The second issue, however, to extend
the deadline for ratification of the ERA,

does not have the same moral and con
stitutional legitimacy and support. Al
though the Justice Department has ruled
that Congress has the sole authority to ex
tend the original deadline (March 22,
1979), it appears evident that such a move
by the Senate was made without the
proper issue in mind. The 35 states that
have already approved the ERA (including
the four which have attempted to rescind
their approval), did so with the provision
that it must be adopted within a seven year
time limitation. Saying at this point that the
limitation no longer holds and to extend it
another 39 months is, bluntly stated,
changing rules after the game has started.
Or as some opponents of extension have
said, it is the equivalent of "extending a
baseball game three more innings because
one team is ahead in the 9th."
Even if this extension allows for the
ERA's adoption, one must question the
means and their legitimacy. Extension of

Even if this extension allows for the

the ratification deadline could set a
dangerous constitutional precedent for
the future extention of perhaps less desir
able amendments. In past history, no con
stitutional amendment has had its ratifica
tion deadline extended, and indeed no
constitutional amendment containing a
deadline has required more than four
years to be ratified. The ERA has had over
six and a half years already. Proponents of
the extension argue that more time is
necessary in order for the ERA to have a fair
hearing. This may be so; however, within
the framework of the Constitution and the
spirit of legal due process, there are other
alternatives. The most obvious is to rein
troduce the Amendment through Con
gress after March 22, 1979. We cannot ab
rupt the spirit of legal due process in order
to achieve even a necessary and important
political and social gain. We must hope
that the ERA be adopted on its own merits,
with no question as to the legitimacy of the

adoption process. An amendment of its
stature need not be tainted.
A political impasse
And so we are at a critical political im
passe — the ERA demands adoption, and
yet at the same time the extension of the
ratification deadline is neither fair nor
constitutionally desirable.
This, however, does not mean that there
is nothing to be done. Both Congress and
President Jimmy Carter have an opportun
ity to affect the current course of events.
As our legislators and our chief executive,
they have a responsibility not only to legis
late and execute the laws, but also to lead
politically and morally. They can now pro
vide the moral leadership that such a dead
locked situation requires.
President Carter should issue a public
statement of his support for the ERA,
clearly pointing to the constitutional, his
torical and moral urgency of its adoption.
Congress should follow suit.
In an election year such acts of moral
leadership may unfortunately place the
parties concerned in a politically vulnera
ble position. However, the urgency of the
ERA must cut across partisan political
lines. We as concerned and informed citi
zens have a responsibility to act. Con
cerned students and organizations at the
University should write to their elected of
ficials, make their opinions known and
urge immediate support for the adoption
of the ERA.
It is time that those leaders showa touch
of that "moral leadership" that we always
hear about and yet so rarely see. With this
breath of welcome, newly founded sup
port, we may still see the ERA adopted
within its originally prescribed time limita
tion.
This road to the eventual adoption of the
ERA promises to remain a difficult one,
and the day when we can truly say that all
citizens are considered equal under the
law may still be far off; regardless, the
effort must be made — made within the
guidelines of the Constitution — and
made now.
