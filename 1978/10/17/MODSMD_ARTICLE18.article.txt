## A 						trend towards the right 
### 
The '60s are over.
It may seem odd in the fall of 1978 to talk about
the death of the '60s, but almost every day I see
yet another remind that the '60s have indeed
ended.
The '60s did not end on December 31, 1969.
It's hard to say exactly when they did end, but it
wasn't until after America withdrew from Viet
nam in January of 1973.1 would even go so far as
to say that something of that special decade
endured until Richard Nixon was finally forced
out of office.
The '60s were more than just a decade. They
were a state of mind, a way of seeing the world, a
promise of change. For a while, a lot of people
seemed to see the truth. A lot of people were
willing to fight for a better way.
It all came at once: the civil rights movement,
the protests against the war, the disillusion
created by the contemptful treatment of the
people by our leaders. For a brief time, liberals
came together with radicals and the awareness
of people in the middle increased. The conser
vatives and the establishment grew scared and
even paranoid, a feeling which manifested itself
most obviously in the Nixon White House.
Liberals and radicals were united by the war,
and the country was split. The '68 campaign was
full of cries from both sides to "bring us to
gether." Then the shocks began to hit us, and
they hit us hard. Martin Luther King and Robert
Kennedy were murdered, we listened in horror
to stories of the My Lai massacre, we watched as
the Ohio National Guard gunned down un
armed students at Kent State.
Finally the war ended for the U.S., and our
boys came home. But that didn't put a stop to
our problems. We began to realize we had lost
the war, that the U.S. was vulnerable. We had
re-elected Nixon, and we soon realized what a
mistake that had been. Suddenly we were in the
middle of a constitutional crisis.
The alliance between the radicals and liberals
ended as there were no more issues of the same
magnitude as Vietnam or the Nixon Administra
tion to hold the alliance together. Radicals
seached for new issues and liberals retreated
into guilt-ridden complacency.
Meanwhile, almost everyone else became
apolitical and the generation that was once "a

ware' was replaced with kids more interested in
dancing and money than in hunger and injus
tice. The conservatives, frightened into silence
for so long, began to speak out again and to
exert influence.
Which brings us briefly and somewhat
simplistically to the present. Everywhere there is
evidence of a return to the right.
Beginning with Miami, Florida and going most
recently to Eugene, Oregon, an allegedly liberal
community, gay rights ordinances have been
repealed by surprisingly huge margins.
Ronald Reagan almost won the 1976 Republi
can presidential nomination.
The Nixon Court ruled just this summer that
police can search the files of newspapers, and
abolished affirmative action on the grounds of
reverse discrimination.
Californians voted for Proposition 13 by more
than a two-to-one margin, resulting in cuts in
what were once thought to be essential services,
such as police and fire protection and educa
tion.
Proponents of Proposition 6, which would
demand that teachers be fired solely on the
grounds of professed homosexuality, lead op
ponents by a 45 to 43 percent margin, according
to the latest poll.
The Creek system is returning full force to
America's campuses, complete with all the trap
pings that characterized the system in the '50s.
Its clear, then, that we're moving to the right.
Perhaps its true, as an article in a recent, Esquire
magazine stated, that the only things we were
left by the '60s are marijuana and sex. That's not
much of a legacy, considering the potential
those years showed.
The 60s are over. The '70s have been a transi
tional period which seems to have changed our
orientation from one direction to the other. No
one knows what the '80s hold in store. If we're
lucky, the trend to the right will go no further,
but I don't think we'll be that lucky.
But we can't romanticize about the past. We
must live in the present. We must strive in our
own way to stay reaction, to make the present as
livable as possible. We can't bring back the past,
but we can be true to our ideals and the lessons
we have learned.

It may seem odd in the fall of 1978 to talk about
the death of the '60s, but almost every day I see
yet another remind that the '60s have indeed
ended.
The '60s did not end on December 31, 1969.
It's hard to say exactly when they did end, but it
wasn't until after America withdrew from Viet
nam in January of 1973.1 would even go so far as
to say that something of that special decade
endured until Richard Nixon was finally forced
out of office.
The '60s were more than just a decade. They
were a state of mind, a way of seeing the world, a
promise of change. For a while, a lot of people
seemed to see the truth. A lot of people were
willing to fight for a better way.
It all came at once: the civil rights movement,
the protests against the war, the disillusion
created by the contemptful treatment of the
people by our leaders. For a brief time, liberals
came together with radicals and the awareness
of people in the middle increased. The conser
vatives and the establishment grew scared and
even paranoid, a feeling which manifested itself
most obviously in the Nixon White House.
Liberals and radicals were united by the war,
and the country was split. The '68 campaign was
full of cries from both sides to "bring us to
gether." Then the shocks began to hit us, and
they hit us hard. Martin Luther King and Robert
Kennedy were murdered, we listened in horror
to stories of the My Lai massacre, we watched as
the Ohio National Guard gunned down un
armed students at Kent State.
Finally the war ended for the U.S., and our
boys came home. But that didn't put a stop to
our problems. We began to realize we had lost
the war, that the U.S. was vulnerable. We had
re-elected Nixon, and we soon realized what a
mistake that had been. Suddenly we were in the
middle of a constitutional crisis.
The alliance between the radicals and liberals
ended as there were no more issues of the same
magnitude as Vietnam or the Nixon Administra
tion to hold the alliance together. Radicals
seached for new issues and liberals retreated
into guilt-ridden complacency.
Meanwhile, almost everyone else became
apolitical and the generation that was once "a

ware' was replaced with kids more interested in
dancing and money than in hunger and injus
tice. The conservatives, frightened into silence
for so long, began to speak out again and to
exert influence.
Which brings us briefly and somewhat
simplistically to the present. Everywhere there is
evidence of a return to the right.
Beginning with Miami, Florida and going most
recently to Eugene, Oregon, an allegedly liberal
community, gay rights ordinances have been
repealed by surprisingly huge margins.
Ronald Reagan almost won the 1976 Republi
can presidential nomination.
The Nixon Court ruled just this summer that
police can search the files of newspapers, and
abolished affirmative action on the grounds of
reverse discrimination.
Californians voted for Proposition 13 by more
than a two-to-one margin, resulting in cuts in
what were once thought to be essential services,
such as police and fire protection and educa
tion.
Proponents of Proposition 6, which would
demand that teachers be fired solely on the
grounds of professed homosexuality, lead op
ponents by a 45 to 43 percent margin, according
to the latest poll.
The Creek system is returning full force to
America's campuses, complete with all the trap
pings that characterized the system in the '50s.
Its clear, then, that we're moving to the right.
Perhaps its true, as an article in a recent, Esquire
magazine stated, that the only things we were
left by the '60s are marijuana and sex. That's not
much of a legacy, considering the potential
those years showed.
The 60s are over. The '70s have been a transi
tional period which seems to have changed our
orientation from one direction to the other. No
one knows what the '80s hold in store. If we're
lucky, the trend to the right will go no further,
but I don't think we'll be that lucky.
But we can't romanticize about the past. We
must live in the present. We must strive in our
own way to stay reaction, to make the present as
livable as possible. We can't bring back the past,
but we can be true to our ideals and the lessons
we have learned.
