# Board backs new billing law
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
The state Board of Medical Quality Assurance (BMQA)
is expected to support legislation which would make
Medical Center billing procedures here unquestionably
legal.
The board's division of licensing voted Friday to re
commend that BMQA endorse legislation which clarifies
private university hospital billing practices. The issue
goes into state legislature hearings next month.
BMQA, along with several other state and federal
groups, is investigating University Hospital billing prac
tices.
The legislation — an amendment to Assembly Bill 1551
introduced by Cordon Duffy (R-Hanford.) — would
make it legal for a private non-profit university medical
school to charge professional fees for services rendered
by faculty physicians.
The Medical Center currently bills in this fashion, al
though section 2008 of the California Business Code
states that medical schools and institutions may make
"no charge for professional services rendered patients."
Same system
The University claims it is not violating the code be
cause it uses the same billing system as most medical
schools, a system routinely subjected to government
audits.
The endorsement recommendation surprised several
persons at the licensing-division meeting. Discussion of
the controversial subject was not on the agenda, but was
brought to the floor by BMQA Executive Director Bob
Rowland.
"I needed the division to take a stand on the amend
ment before the formal meeting in the legislature next
month," Rowland explained.
He added that he invited the legislation's prime oppo
nent, Dr. Eugene Dong, associate professor of car
diovascular surgery, to the meeting.

Dong attended, but said he was unprepared to give
comments.
"There was no public announcement that this topic
was going to be discussed," he said. "I didn't have time
to prepare any comments, and that's what I told the
division."
But, Dong did give his opinion on the matter, saying
the legislation should be opposed to "keep the middle
men out of the practice of medicine.
"Everyone simply wants to makemoneyin medicine,"
he said. "I think the legislature will see that when the bill
goes to public hearings."
Two votes
The licensing division voted on the issue twice during
Friday's meeting. Two board members, Dr. John Bunker
and Dr. Harry Oberhelman, disqualified themselves be
cause they are faculty here. A third board member,
Lewis Simpson, abstained because he said he didn't
have enough information on the subject. Voting was
tabled due to lack of quorum.
But, after a short break, the issue was reopened.
Simpson voted in favor of recommendation and the
motion passed, 4-0, with two abstentions.
Rowland said he didn't talk with Simpson during
the break.
Conflict of interest?
Both Dong and a local chapter of the Union of Ameri
can Physicians have questioned the BMQA investigation
of Stanford, because Rowland is the son of a former
controller of the Medical School.
Rowland is also a Stanford graduate and worked for
the Medical School until a year and a half ago, when he
took the BMQA position.
"I'm a big boy now," Rowland said. "I have fond
feelings for the University, but the family ties have to be
distinct from my professional responsibility.
"I think my background with the Medical School has
been helpful because I know the workings of the institu
tion and can separate the wheat from the chaff.'
