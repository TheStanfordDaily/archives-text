## rock/mike hale 'Oldies' song selections place Ronstadt in a rut 
### 
Living In The USA, a standard Linda Ronstadt
album, is sure to trigger the now standard Linda
Ronstadt criticism: "Why does she do so many
oldies?" To answer with a question, "Why aren't
there any new songs worth recording?" Current
popular music, a cesspool swirling to a disco
beat, has nothing to offer a singer as talented as
Ronstadt; hence, her recent penchant for older,
proven material.
Ronstadt is still a singer who lives and dies by
her song selection, however, and on this album
she struggles to stay alive. While Living is an
improvement over the unrelieved blandness of
Simple Dreams, her last release, it isn't in the
same class with her best albums. The strength of
these records (Don't Cry Now, Heart Like A
Wheel), and of Ronstadt herself, lay in their un
ified country-rock sound. Their cohesiveness
served her much better than does the attempted
eclecticism of Living In The USA.
"Back In The USA," the opening song, is a
case in point. A 1959 Chuck Berry guitar show
case, it provides excellent lead work by Waddy
Wachtel and shows off the rest of her fine band
as well. The lyrics, however, are so dated as to
be self-parodic. "Did I miss the skyscrapers/ Did
I miss the long freeways . . . You can bet your
life I did/ Till I got back to the USA." Ronstadt
seems to realize that this time capsule from the
Fifties represents neither her values northoseof
her fans; her rendition lacks any conviction.
Best cuts
Also on the first side are two of the album's
best cuts. "When I Crow Too Old To Dream," a
Hammerstein and Romberg song from the 1934
film The Night Is Young, is glorious in its simplic
ity. Over-muted accompaniment from a piano
and vibes, Ronstadt sings the sugary love song in
a husky vibrato that is overdone but still effec
tive. "White Rhythm and Blues," by J.D.
Souther, appears to be the only song to have

been written forthis album. While the lyrics ride
the razor's edge of insipidity, Ronstadt supplies
them with the conviction that is lacking
elsewhere, the same thing she did for another
predictable Souther song, "Faithless Love."
Poor song choices
Side two is marred by poor song choices. On
"Ooh Baby Baby," a mid-'6os Smokey Robinson
tune, Ronstadt tries for a breathy Diana Ross and
comes off sounding like the Stylistics on a bad
day. The song is salvaged to some extent by
David Sanborn's sax (it's nice to hear a sax solo
that doesn't remind you of Clarence Clemons).
Eric Kaz's "Bowling Away," while a fine song, is
not suited to Ronstadt either; Bonnie Raitt, with
her roadhouse voice, has already done a much
better cover. "Mohammed's Radio" is another
silly Warren Zevon song, dispensing simple
symbolism for the masses. You would think that
only Zevon himself would be foolish enough to
sing the songs he writes.
Motley character
The album's motley character is perfectly
(perhaps intentionally) symbolized by the pre
sence of an Elvis song on each side; Costello on
the first, Presley on the second. In "Alison,"
Costello's anger has become Ronstadt's smug
ness, as she delivers a lecture on the dangers of
stealing boyfriends. Finally, with the closing
song, we get a reminder of and,
hopefully, a sign of things to come. "Love Me
Tender" is the quintessential Ronstadt song,
simple and half country. It belongs on a much
better album than this; it deserves a neighbor
hood like Heart Like A Wheel. Ronstadt is nowin
a rut; her last three albums have all been point
less collections of disparate songs. To break out,
she must be true to the cliche and "find her
roots," which surface here only after 30 mostly
boring minutes.

Ronstadt; hence, her recent penchant for older,
proven material.
Ronstadt is still a singer who lives and dies by
her song selection, however, and on this album
she struggles to stay alive. While Living is an
improvement over the unrelieved blandness of
Simple Dreams, her last release, it isn't in the
same class with her best albums. The strength of
these records (Don't Cry Now, Heart Like A
Wheel), and of Ronstadt herself, lay in their un
ified country-rock sound. Their cohesiveness
served her much better than does the attempted
eclecticism of Living In The USA.
"Back In The USA," the opening song, is a
case in point. A 1959 Chuck Berry guitar show
case, it provides excellent lead work by Waddy
Wachtel and shows off the rest of her fine band
as well. The lyrics, however, are so dated as to
be self-parodic. "Did I miss the skyscrapers/ Did
I miss the long freeways . . . You can bet your
life I did/ Till I got back to the USA." Ronstadt
seems to realize that this time capsule from the
Fifties represents neither her values northoseof
her fans; her rendition lacks any conviction.
Best cuts
Also on the first side are two of the album's
best cuts. "When I Crow Too Old To Dream," a
Hammerstein and Romberg song from the 1934
film The Night Is Young, is glorious in its simplic
ity. Over-muted accompaniment from a piano
and vibes, Ronstadt sings the sugary love song in
a husky vibrato that is overdone but still effec
tive. "White Rhythm and Blues," by J.D.
Souther, appears to be the only song to have

been written forthis album. While the lyrics ride
the razor's edge of insipidity, Ronstadt supplies
them with the conviction that is lacking
elsewhere, the same thing she did for another
predictable Souther song, "Faithless Love."
Poor song choices
Side two is marred by poor song choices. On
"Ooh Baby Baby," a mid-'6os Smokey Robinson
tune, Ronstadt tries for a breathy Diana Ross and
comes off sounding like the Stylistics on a bad
day. The song is salvaged to some extent by
David Sanborn's sax (it's nice to hear a sax solo
that doesn't remind you of Clarence Clemons).
Eric Kaz's "Bowling Away," while a fine song, is
not suited to Ronstadt either; Bonnie Raitt, with
her roadhouse voice, has already done a much
better cover. "Mohammed's Radio" is another
silly Warren Zevon song, dispensing simple
symbolism for the masses. You would think that
only Zevon himself would be foolish enough to
sing the songs he writes.
Motley character
The album's motley character is perfectly
(perhaps intentionally) symbolized by the pre
sence of an Elvis song on each side; Costello on
the first, Presley on the second. In "Alison,"
Costello's anger has become Ronstadt's smug
ness, as she delivers a lecture on the dangers of
stealing boyfriends. Finally, with the closing
song, we get a reminder of and,
hopefully, a sign of things to come. "Love Me
Tender" is the quintessential Ronstadt song,
simple and half country. It belongs on a much
better album than this; it deserves a neighbor
hood like Heart Like A Wheel. Ronstadt is nowin
a rut; her last three albums have all been point
less collections of disparate songs. To break out,
she must be true to the cliche and "find her
roots," which surface here only after 30 mostly
boring minutes.


Linda Ronstadt ~ courtes,y Asylum ,ecords
Living In The USA, a standard Linda Ronstadt
album, is sure to trigger the now standard Linda
Ronstadt criticism: "Why does she do so many
oldies?" To answer with a question, "Why aren't
there any new songs worth recording?" Current
popular music, a cesspool swirling to a disco

Ronstadt; hence, her recent penchant for older,
