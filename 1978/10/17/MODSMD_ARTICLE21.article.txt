## Theatre of All Possibilities playing religious mindgames 
### 
Boy were we dumb. Shit,
were we gullible! How easily
fooled.
A guy comes up to us in the
City. Says he's an actor and do
we want to see a play. He de
scribes the set-up: a young
group of actors doing innova
tive theater. The audience
comprised exclusively of in
vited guests of which we are
among the "chosen."
Why us? He's felt a magnetic
attraction. Ah well when you
put it like that.
He had penetrating eyes, an
alluring smile. Only $13'll get
you dinner and the play. The
chef, heeza real Sicilian — justa
got offa the boata yesterday.
Cash now or forget it. A flash
of teeth. So what do you say?
Sunday night we joined 300
other dupes, all having paid
$13 for chicken caccitorre and
avant-garde theater only to be
fed bland feathers and a two
and one-half hour sermon per
formed by The Theatre of all
Possibilities. Yes, sermon. The
Magician is not really theatre at
all but slick propaganda aimed
at converting audience mem
bers to Christianity.
Cheap ploy
It is going to be difficult for
me to write anything approach
ing a rationale, clear-headed
review of this play because I am
so incensed at the methods
they employ to procure their
audiences. They obviously in
tend to keep the evangelical
nature of their play a well
guarded secret until they have

you seated in the theater, a
captive, unsuspecting audi
ence primed for their religious
mind-games.
The play itself is no better
than the methods used to get
you to watch it. The story on
the simplest level chronicles
the life of Luke King, the
youngest of three King
brothers, the older two having
been recently assassinated.
The playwright impresses
upon the audience none too
subtly, that Luke should be
identified with Teddy Kennedy
although the resemblance
stops at his brothers and has
nothing remotely to contribute
to the play.
Everything answered
Luke is going through a bad
period when we meet him. He
is disillusioned with life,
searching foranswers. Up until
this point (the first 10 minutes
of the play) The Magician is
badly written but not yet offen
sive. The playwright, Alexan
der Francis Horn, poses some
universal questions about the
meaning of life and the justifi
cation for man's suffering,
which had he not been so
heavy-handedly allegorical
might have been interesting.
What soon becomes clear,
however, is that Horn intends
to solve these timeless dilem
mas by the end of the play.
Ridiculous, you say. On the
contrary, not if you believe in
the Lord.
Luke meets a magician in the
park who offers to help him

"find himself" with the"truth"
and the "light" thrown in for
good measure. The rest of the
play is a series of episodes or
crucibles which Luke must un
dergo in order to attain wis
dom and maturity.
The play begins realistically
and becomes increasingly fan
tastic with each adventure on
which the two embark. Their
first task is to retrieve the "key
of life" which is needed to free
Luke's crazy sister Pearl who is
locked up in some other
worldly prison. One knows
about her plight because of her
intermittent whining, "Luke,
Luke, save me."
Down to hell
The key is held by the Great
Whore of Hell, so down to hell
they truck, the notion being, I
assume, that to get to heaven
you've got to go through a lot
of hell. Subtly allegorical huh?
Until this point we've had to
sit through groaners like the
Magician's "Cot a light? (for his
cigarette) Man must have light
in this dark world eh?" Down
in hell the play goes mad.
Horn unleashes all of his
creative powers to depict hell's
grisly horrors which it turns out
are one and the same as mod
ern technology. Hell is inha
bited by its ruler, the Tyrant,
his followers — scientists! and
of course, Hell's Whore. It is
difficult not to laugh as I re
count the events which ensue
in hell and indeed if the Whore
and her saga were not so dis
gusting, they would be hysteri

cally tunny.
Forshe is a huge 15 foot pink
satin monster made of long
flowing scarves and coiled wire
ringlets who gyrates around
the stage croaking and panting
"seductively."
Everyone in hell worships
her and when Luke and the
Magician arrive, the Tyrant is in
the midst of praying to her:
"Oh Great whore of Hell you
who hold the key of life, we
prostrate ourselves before you
and fill youf uterus with our
semen, down, down into your
bottomless pit we surge. . .
The Tyrant and the Whore
then mate depicted by the Tyr
ant lifting up the Whore's front
flap, thrusting his head inside
the monster and wiggling his
behind in the air amid groans
and sighs from both he and the
Whore simulating sexual or
gasm.
Baby Monster
Their intercourse results in
the birth of another grotesque
monster — black silk this time
with a head composed of bibli
cal serpents, lime green and
plastic. Baby Monster, it turns
out, is a cloning machine.
Urged on by the Tyrant, all the
scientists enter Baby and come
out in duplicate.
There are now around eight
pairs of identical twins romp
ing about on stage. Some be
come enamored with their re
spective clones which ends up
with twin pawing twin and a
general ripping of clothes and
rolling around on the floor.

Other clone couples get to
gether with couples of the op
posite (or same) sex and par
take in menage a quatre. a six, a
huit — your basic sex orgy a la
clone.
The end result is a stage full
of heaving clones frenetically
fornicating or masturbating
with each and everyone.
Backwards, sideways, pant,
pant, pant. Upside down,
three-on-one, heave, heave,
heave.
Copulating clones
As one actor commented be
fore the performance, the
company had "guts." Ah yes, a
plucky bunch. "You might say
it's a political play," he told me,
"although it is also a symbol of
much more." I guess it is in the
realm of the "much more" that
non-believers are likened to
copulating clones.
Luckily, amid all the sexual
distraction among the clones,
Luke is able to snatch the key of
life from the Whore and slip
away to save whining sister
Pearl.
Pearl and her brother celeb
rate her liberation by dancing
'round and 'round and 'round
to a schmaltzy waltz tune while
Pearl utters such unforgetta
bles as, "Oh, I'm so happy I
could fly. Smell the flowers,
Luke, the beautiful flowers,
and the grass, the trees — lis
ten to the birds. Oh how won
derful.
"Remember, Luke, when we
were children . . . the birds,
the brook, the flowers." (At the
same time they are dancing

and whining, they are also paw
ing each other — much like
clones).
Impossible
Pearl again: "Let's fly Luke,
up to the stars ... oh take me
to the stars Luke."
When Luke protests that he
is unable to fly, Pearl chicles
him, "Don't you know by now,
Luke, that EVERYTHING is pos
sible." (I get the feeling that's
important to the play — mostly
because it is repeated 16 or 17
times arid the theater is named
the Theatre of All Possibilities.)
Meanwhile, down in hell,
the clones and the humans
have a dispute leading to a
clone revolt and the death of
the humans.
Up above, Pearl and Luke
reach their star by riding a fly
ing horse named "Till-We-
Meet-Again." The celebration
they have in honor of being re
born is interrupted, hoWever,
when Pearl is captured by the
bad guys. The Magician and
the Tyrant then challenge each
other to a chess match, pre
sumably to settle "for good"
the fate of the world.
Chess game
The chess game is a striking
spectacle at first being enacted
by lifesize chess piece-actors.
The novelty dulls quickly
though when nothing happens
outside of the interminable cal
ling out of moves. Each, natur
ally symbolic.
Tyrant: "My pawn of de
struction, takes your knight of
light."
Magician: "My Queen of
Hope takes your Bishop of

Malice," etc. ad infinitum.
At this point I lost track of the
end of the chess game. The
Tyrant had just made a state
ment lumping the Soviets, the
Chinese and most of the Mid
dle East in with non-believers
and other damned souls. Two
of the friends I came with
walked out.
The play concludes with the
Magician sacrificing himself to
save Luke's life by allowing
himself to be nailed to a swas
tika. Interesting twist. He es
capes, however, thanks to his
prestidigitation and the devil's
preoccupation with masturbat-,
ing (depicted by the Tyrant's
fondling of an inflating pink
balloon).
Stinko
What possible comment is to
be made about this absurd,
outrageous play? It's disgust
ingly bigoted, horrendously
written and glaringly unsubtle.
The acting is lousy. In short,
the play deserves to be at
tacked physically not verbally,
by hurling tomatoes and rotten
eggs, upsetting tables and
storming the box office in de
mand of a refund.
In fact, this was not at all how
the audience reacted. They sat
passively throughout, laughing
at the dumb jokes and ethnic
slurs. At the end, while my sole
remaining companion and I
made a beeline for the door,
they stood applauding!
Didn't they realize what they
had sat through? Were they
swallowing this "Christian"
message because it was lightly
disguised by fantastic adven
tures, flashy costumes and
bright balloons?
It is frightening to think that
such a poor bastardization of
theater could actually be an ef
fective tool for propaganda.
Doesn't say much for today's
audiences.
(The Magician runs every Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday at
the Theatre of All Possibilities
in San Francisco.)
