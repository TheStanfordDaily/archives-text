## 'Brown Sugar': go for the ride 
### 
Even if you don't know and/
or love Duke Ellington, Billie
Holiday, Ethel Waters or Eubie
Blake....Smalls Paradise, the
Cotton Club or that 'A' Train to
the Pearly Gates...
Bubbling Brown Sugar will
send you sailing.
It's a powerful — though
bumpy — ride back to Harlem
of the '20s and '30s, and to the
music and some-of-the-magic
of black vaudeville.
In fact, it's better if you don't
know much about this era.
Brown Sugar will disappoint
those who want carbon copies
of old favorites or lots of in
strumentals. To get a Billie
Holiday ballad or Fats Waller's

stride piano, you'll have to buy
their records.
That's not the point.
Stretches
Brown Sugar is a wonderful
game of Remember When. It's
unbeatable, when played that
way, and falters only when it
tries to be more than that. His
torical re-creations and "edu
cational" revues are fine — but
this simply isn't built like one.
It stretches over 20 years of
theater, a scatter shot selection
of performers and songs — all
quality stuff, but without the
means to go beyond that.
That's because the show,
like the rent party it salutes, has
two reasons for life: "To raise

the money or the roof." Brown
Sugar is torn between being
Broadway and being true to its
material. The music, perfor
mers and "moments" can
stand on their own, but to in
sure the sale, someone's de
manded unnecessary "new"
songs and a sometimes plastic
staging.
Nostalgia trip
Strip the excuses and trim
mings. You'd have an un
abashed revue good, bad and
bittersweet memories and a lot
of music for music's sake.
What's wrong with that?
Yet, author Lofton Mitchell
tries to justify the Harlem tri
bute with a flimsy book about
vaudeville veterans taking '70s
hipsters on a nostalgia trip. He
brings in lots of gags and
someone even finds a Theatri
cal Trunk, filled with stuff like
Bert Williams' hat or so-and
so's glass slipper.
Those souvenirs pale against
the power of other bits and
pieces of the past — the 30-or
so songs, dances and specialty
numbers.
Style and energy
So much so fast in so many
ways could have torn the show
apart. But, director Robert
Cooper and his cast control
with skillful style, and in the
few places where that runs out,
their energy holds it together.
Bettye Lavette is a pow
erhouse, with her smoky "God
Bless the Child" and a "Sweet
Georgia Brown," danced so
hot and hard that her male
companions flounder on the
floor.
Charles "Honi" Coles has
that other kind of stage power.
If Lavette wows you outside in.
Coles warms you inside out.
He's tall, skinny and graying —
a vaudeville veteran with an
easy manner and a shine in his
eyes that says, "I've been up
here awhile and I know what
I'm doing, so sit back and let's
both enjoy the show."
He does a wonderfully woe
ful Bert Williams' "Nobody"
and velvet smooth "Hon
eysuckle Rose" and "Emaline."
Others
The other principals —
Mable Lee is a little too Eartha
Kitt cold, but James "Stump"

Cross is as loud and laughable
as his checkered suits.
Standouts in the supporting
cast include Teri Lindsay in her
blues numbers, Boncellia
Lewis' "I Got It Bad" and dan
cers Andy Torres and Thomas
Tofel.
The desingers also pull to
gether the show. In fact, they
play up the collage effect, giv
ing us snatches of the past,
caught whimsically in Clarke
Dunham's set, and old-style
drop, painted wih a sort-of
cubist view of uptown streets.
Bernard Johnson adds a
sampling of honky tonk ready
to-wear: boas and bow ties,
slinky slit gowns, wing lapels
and "strolling" clothes.
Alive
"Strolling" is choreog
rapher' Billy Wilson's version
of a low, mean street walk:
"You step with the right, limps
with the left, slide alittle and
say, 'Watch out, honey, 'cause
here I come."
Dancing? Fast or sensual, al
ways refreshingly alive. They
do tangos, kicks, Charleston
and Liny, lots of tap (from To
fel, who leaps a dozen stairs
without blinking — to the en
tire cast, tapping out the finale)
and, of course, the Savoy
Stomp, which brings down the
first-act curtain with the irresis
tible "Take the 'A' Train."
Even when they aren't
"dancing," the chorus is magic
in motion — acrobatic, erotic,
comic, exotic — a sinister leer
here — a Chaplin stumble
there.
Soar
And, all over, the Style and
energy, wade through the
loaded staging and soar when
given the chance.
Bubbling Brown Sugar tells
you how it was, without getting
you there.
Though that's a problem, in
the end, you don't really mind,
because, we 11...
Some of us take trains to get
places.
Others just go for the ride.
Brown Sugar may not get
anywhere. But it's a great way
to travel.
"Bubbling Brown Sugar"
runs at the Curran Theater
through, mid-November.
