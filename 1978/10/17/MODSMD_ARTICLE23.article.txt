## 'Clutterbuck' coy 
### 
For those who enjoy Noel
Coward's comedies, Clutter
buck, Ben Levy's sad imitation,
is a disappointment. For those
who already dislike British
upper-class humor it is a disas
ter.
Clutterbuck concerns two
childhood friends, Jane and
Deborah, who meet on a lux
ury cruise. Each is now married
and their husbands find that
they can't stand each other.
Then over brandies, the two
men find that they have shared
a common mistress, Melissa,
who happens to be on board.
This creates a kind of brotherly
comeraderie.
Meanwhile Jane and De
borah discover that their Vene
tian romances of past summers
were with the same man who is
also on board and is married to
(can you guess?) Melissa. The
expected attempts at genteel
seduction ensue, culminating
in an absurd game of verbal
hide-and-seek, as each charac
ter tries to discover where the
various parties spent their
evenings.
Acts I and 111 consist of
the two couples lounging on
deck chairs in dinner attire sip
ping pre-Louis XIV brandy with
Levy tossing sometimes clever,
though often disappointingly
blunt barbs at upper-class
British morals and double

standards. Levy tries for the
easy, cocktail-coated witti
cisms one expects from Cow
ard, yet ends up with a tire
some, chatty play.
The Hillbarn Theatre pro
duction is an admirable effort
by non-professional commun
ity players, yet it lacks the abil
ity to make Levy's play seem
anything more than boring
chit-chat.
Both Norma Gruman'sdirec
tion and the acting are
amateurish. This stands out
glaringly in a play which re
quires a virtuoso comedy en
semble to succeed. As the two
couples, Tom Chase, Lois Al
len, Robert Brauns and Nancy
Wagner lack the timing and
professionalism to make their
dialogue seem anything more
than memorized lines.
As Melissa, Karen Johnson
oozes baby talk and prances
around in next to nothing, yet
her acting is so shallow that
even her insincerity seems in
sincere.
Though disappointing theat
rically, one sees that there is a
great deal of enthusiasm and
community pride for the Hill
barn Theatre.
Clutterbuck plays Fri. and Sat.
at 8:30 p.m. until Nov. 25 at the
Hillbarn Theatre, 1285 East Hill
sdale Blvd., Foster City. Student
tickets are $3.50.
