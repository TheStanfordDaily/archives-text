## Clamma Dale sparkling in Mem Aud show 
### 
Friday the thirteenth
brought Clamma Dale no bad
luck. Her performance at
Memorial Auditorium was cap
tivating. She is a dramatic sop
rano who unleashes a tre
mendous amount of emotion
with her singing and is able to
create whatever mood she de
sires.
The evening opened with
"Ah, Perfido!," a Beethoven
aria. Immediately her fine dic
tion, contrast and shading
were apparent. However, she
seemed to be feeling out the
audience and adjusting to the
auditorium. The song lacked
the spark that she normally
has.
Schumann's "Frauenhliebe
Und Leben" was excellent.
This is a cycle of songs about a
woman's love and life. The first
movements in which the
woman sees her beloved and
becomes engaged were fine.
As the song progressed one
could sense the transforma
tion. Dale was now the woman
and we all felt her hopes and
fears. The song culminated in
an intense silence since the
woman's one and only love
dies.
Highlight
The second half opened with
four German songs by Richard
Strauss: "Allerseelen," "Die
Nacht," "Befreit," and
"Cacilie." Dale performed
them beautifully, changing
mood and tone effortlessly.
But the highlight of the even
ing were the seven Spanish
songs by De Falla. It was a
beautiful exhibition of the
singer's art: great expression,

changing mood, and a total
performance that leaves an au
dience captivated and asking
for more.
An appreciative audience re
fused to halt their applause
until she did an encore — the
"Vissi d'arte" aria from the
opera Tosca. This terribly de
manding aria was excellent, it
brought an immediate stand
ing ovation from the audience
which is something very rare in
the Stanford community.
Broadway
A graduate of Julliard, Dale
received instant acclaim for her
stunning and brilliant portrayal
of Bess in the Houston Grand
Opera's production of "Porgy
and Bess" on Broadway last
season. She has sung with the
New York City Opera and per
formed with many major sym
phony orchestras.
She demands a lot of herself
and said that she had very little
to do with the fact that she
sings opera as opposed to
some other style. Her father
was a jazz pianist and aware of
the struggles of musicians. He
felt opera was an easier avenue
although he realized racial
problems still existed.
Dale feels the operattic style
is freer and allows her to ex
press herself. "After the black

church experience music be
comes very personal," she
says. Her exposure to the kinds
of embellishments black
people put with music has en
abled her to carry over this
same style into opera.
Sharing
"True art is never successful
being withheld. It is something
I've been given to share with
all. Indeed Dale does share her
art. Not only through her per
formances but with articles on
black music and musicians.
For one year she taught in a
prison on Riker's Island in New
York. She said the experience
was good for her. In some ways
she said it was scary because
she realized what an effect she
was having on the lives of the
men there and the responsibil
ity that influence carried with
it.
"I am a survivor," she said.
"There is something in me that
wants to live." She is a proud
woman. "I don't understand
why some people wither up
and die. I can be hurt and I will
withdraw into my shell but
then I find the strength to
bounce back. I won't give up. It
is hard to explain. You can im
agine what Nat Turner must
have felt but still he had the
guts to stand up," said Dale.

Clamma Dale, with accompanist Neil StannArd, gave a mini-concert
in Ujamaa lounge Oct. 11. Dale also performed Oct. 13 at Memorial
Auditorium.
Friday the thirteenth
brought Clamma Dale no bad
luck. Her performance at
Memorial Auditorium was cap
tivating. She is a dramatic sop
rano who unleashes a tre
mendous amount of emotion
with her singing and is able to
create whatever mood she de
sires.
The evening opened with
"Ah, Perfido!," a Beethoven
aria. Immediately her fine dic
tion, contrast and shading
were apparent. However, she
seemed to be feeling out the
audience and adjusting to the
auditorium. The song lacked
the spark that she normally
has.
Schumann's "Frauenhliebe
Und Leben" was excellent.
This is a cycle of songs about a
woman's love and life. The first
movements in which the
woman sees her beloved and
becomes engaged were fine.
As the song progressed one
could sense the transforma
tion. Dale was now the woman
and we all felt her hopes and
fears. The song culminated in
an intense silence since the
woman's one and only love
dies.
Highlight
The second half opened with
four German songs by Richard
Strauss: "Allerseelen," "Die
Nacht," "Befreit," and
"Cacilie." Dale performed
them beautifully, changing
mood and tone effortlessly.
But the highlight of the even
ing were the seven Spanish
songs by De Falla. It was a
beautiful exhibition of the
singer's art: great expression,

changing mood, and a total
performance that leaves an au
dience captivated and asking
for more.
An appreciative audience re
fused to halt their applause
until she did an encore — the
"Vissi d'arte" aria from the
opera Tosca. This terribly de
manding aria was excellent, it
brought an immediate stand
ing ovation from the audience
which is something very rare in
the Stanford community.
Broadway
A graduate of Julliard, Dale
received instant acclaim for her
stunning and brilliant portrayal
of Bess in the Houston Grand
Opera's production of "Porgy
and Bess" on Broadway last
season. She has sung with the
New York City Opera and per
formed with many major sym
phony orchestras.
She demands a lot of herself
and said that she had very little
to do with the fact that she
sings opera as opposed to
some other style. Her father
was a jazz pianist and aware of
the struggles of musicians. He
felt opera was an easier avenue
although he realized racial
problems still existed.
Dale feels the operattic style
is freer and allows her to ex
press herself. "After the black

church experience music be
comes very personal," she
says. Her exposure to the kinds
of embellishments black
people put with music has en
abled her to carry over this
same style into opera.
Sharing
"True art is never successful
being withheld. It is something
I've been given to share with
all. Indeed Dale does share her
art. Not only through her per
formances but with articles on
black music and musicians.
For one year she taught in a
prison on Riker's Island in New
York. She said the experience
was good for her. In some ways
she said it was scary because
she realized what an effect she
was having on the lives of the
men there and the responsibil
ity that influence carried with
it.
"I am a survivor," she said.
"There is something in me that
wants to live." She is a proud
woman. "I don't understand
why some people wither up
and die. I can be hurt and I will
withdraw into my shell but
then I find the strength to
bounce back. I won't give up. It
is hard to explain. You can im
agine what Nat Turner must
have felt but still he had the
guts to stand up," said Dale.
