## Comedy talent showcased 
### 
There are few places that
offer more pure entertainment
than Star Wars, as well as live
music from top rock bands,
and cost less than going to a
new movie. As a matter of fact,
I can only think of one — The
Punch Line, which celebrated
its opening night last Tuesday.
All right, even though the
live music comes through the
walls from the Old Waldorf
next door, The Punch Line is
still a bargain at $2.50. Don't be
swayed by the somewhat corny
advertisements in the Chron.
San Francisco's first all-comedy
nightclub does not cater to an
older audience.
The Punch Line, owned by
Jeffrey Pollack and produced
by entertainment promoters
Anne and Jon Fox, "will be de
dicated to showcasing the best
young comedy talent in the
country." Jon Fox says,"It has
taken years of hard work to
elevate the comedy scene in
San Francisco out of cof
feehouse cellars and off nights
at sceptical nightclubs."
Street-wise
Opening night's master of
ceremonies was Marty Cohen,
runner-up in the third annual
San Francisco International
Open Stand-up Comedy Com
petition. Cohen quickly won
the audience with his fast
talking, street-wise manner.
He showed an alacrity for
mimicking anyone from an an
nouncer for car races to dis
tainful women. At ease on
stage, he occasionally inter
rupted his performance yel
ling, "Hey, can you turn up that
music?," toward the Old Wal
dorf or pointing into space and
saying, "Wait, there's a place
here with no smoke. Can we
get a little more smoke in
here?" During technical dif
ficulties, he chatted with the
audience and gathered jokes
from the more vocal members.
Jack Marion, third place
winner of the SFIOSUCC, was
the first act. Marion related
personal anecdotes about
being a barker for nude shows
on North Beach, his difficulties
with fluffy toilet seat covers
and girls with deadly stiff bouf
fant hair-dos, and his encoun
ters with San Francisco's more

unique residents.
After Marion, the decep
tively ordinary-looking impre
ssionist, Jim Giovanni, took the
stage. Giovanni's presenta
tions of the incongruous —
Redd Foxx as THE EXHORCIST,
or Tommy Smothers reciting
Shakespeare, were funny, but
truth is stranger than fiction.
When the ingenuous Giovanni
donned a swimming cap and
wide grin as the women's cap
tain of the East German swim
team, or when he covered
himself with shaving cream
("Ahh, it's a manly odor,") or
when, as Leon Spinks, he told
Howard Cossell his favorite as
pect of boxing, (Howard, I like
to hear their nose crunch,")
hysterical laughter filled the
club.
Live music
Next Rick, of Rick and Ruby,
stepped on stage wearing a
"Village People" t-shirt, and
carrying a guitar. I am still sur
prised at the amount of noise
one man can make. The slen
der Rick proved amazingly
energetic and quickened the
already fast-paced show with a
medley of songs. We heard
Johnny Cash singing "I Am
Woman," Donovan's version
of "Jumbalya," Barry White's
rendition of the same song,
K.C. and the Sunshine Band's
disco interpretation, and fi
nally the Ohio Players singing it
to the tune of "Love Roller
Coaster." The audience,

primed so, surely must have
drowned out the music next
door when Rick introduced
himself as Neil Diamond,
America's first singing stand
up comic, and proceeded to
sing Henny Youngman one
liners to "I Am I Said."
And there was still more.
Bob Sarlatte of Butch Wacks
and the Glass Packs, a comedy
rock group, closed the show.
Sarlatte jumped from one topic
to another, from one laugh to
another. Among many others,
he lighted upon the subjects of
professional bartenders
school, and sources of
amusement in a Safeway store.
Energy and Enthusiasm
Without a doubt, the Punch
Line will provide some of the
best entertainment in the Bay
Area. The energy and en
thusiasm which went into last
Tuesday's performances
should increase as the attrac
tive, 175 seat club establishes
itself. New headlines will ap
pear Wednesday through
Saturday. "Sunday will be set
aside for a showcase of top
up-and-coming San Francisco
comedy talent."
After all, Los Angeles and
New York have their all
comedy nightclubs — it's
about time San Francisco
began to take care of its own.
The Punch Line is located (you
guessed it) next to the Old
Waldorf, at 444-A Battery St.
San Francisco.

to hear their nose crunch,")
hysterical laughter filled the
club.
Live music
Next Rick, of Rick and Ruby,
stepped on stage wearing a
"Village People" t-shirt, and
carrying a guitar. I am still sur
prised at the amount of noise
one man can make. The slen
der Rick proved amazingly
energetic and quickened the
already fast-paced show with a
medley of songs. We heard
Johnny Cash singing "I Am
Woman," Donovan's version
of "Jumbalya," Barry White's
rendition of the same song,
K.C. and the Sunshine Band's
disco interpretation, and fi
nally the Ohio Players singing it
to the tune of "Love Roller
Coaster." The audience,

primed so, surely must have
drowned out the music next
door when Rick introduced
himself as Neil Diamond,
America's first singing stand
up comic, and proceeded to
sing Henny Youngman one
liners to "I Am I Said."
And there was still more.
Bob Sarlatte of Butch Wacks
and the Glass Packs, a comedy
rock group, closed the show.
Sarlatte jumped from one topic
to another, from one laugh to
another. Among many others,
he lighted upon the subjects of
professional bartenders
school, and sources of
amusement in a Safeway store.
Energy and Enthusiasm
Without a doubt, the Punch
Line will provide some of the
best entertainment in the Bay
Area. The energy and en
thusiasm which went into last
Tuesday's performances
should increase as the attrac
tive, 175 seat club establishes
itself. New headlines will ap
pear Wednesday through
Saturday. "Sunday will be set
aside for a showcase of top
up-and-coming San Francisco
comedy talent."
After all, Los Angeles and
New York have their all
comedy nightclubs — it's
about time San Francisco
began to take care of its own.
The Punch Line is located (you
guessed it) next to the Old
Waldorf, at 444-A Battery St.
San Francisco.
There are few places that
offer more pure entertainment
than Star Wars, as well as live
music from top rock bands,
and cost less than going to a
new movie. As a matter of fact,
I can only think of one — The
Punch Line, which celebrated
its opening night last Tuesday.
All right, even though the
live music comes through the
walls from the Old Waldorf
next door, The Punch Line is
still a bargain at $2.50. Don't be
swayed by the somewhat corny
advertisements in the Chron.
San Francisco's first all-comedy
nightclub does not cater to an
older audience.
The Punch Line, owned by
Jeffrey Pollack and produced
by entertainment promoters
Anne and Jon Fox, "will be de
dicated to showcasing the best
young comedy talent in the
country." Jon Fox says,"It has
taken years of hard work to
elevate the comedy scene in
San Francisco out of cof
feehouse cellars and off nights
at sceptical nightclubs."
Street-wise
Opening night's master of
ceremonies was Marty Cohen,
runner-up in the third annual
San Francisco International
Open Stand-up Comedy Com
petition. Cohen quickly won
the audience with his fast
talking, street-wise manner.
He showed an alacrity for
mimicking anyone from an an
nouncer for car races to dis
tainful women. At ease on
stage, he occasionally inter
rupted his performance yel
ling, "Hey, can you turn up that
music?," toward the Old Wal
dorf or pointing into space and
saying, "Wait, there's a place
here with no smoke. Can we
get a little more smoke in
here?" During technical dif
ficulties, he chatted with the
audience and gathered jokes
from the more vocal members.
Jack Marion, third place
winner of the SFIOSUCC, was
the first act. Marion related
personal anecdotes about
being a barker for nude shows
on North Beach, his difficulties
with fluffy toilet seat covers
and girls with deadly stiff bouf
fant hair-dos, and his encoun
ters with San Francisco's more

unique residents.
After Marion, the decep
tively ordinary-looking impre
ssionist, Jim Giovanni, took the
stage. Giovanni's presenta
tions of the incongruous —
Redd Foxx as THE EXHORCIST,
or Tommy Smothers reciting
Shakespeare, were funny, but
truth is stranger than fiction.
When the ingenuous Giovanni
donned a swimming cap and
wide grin as the women's cap
tain of the East German swim
team, or when he covered
himself with shaving cream
("Ahh, it's a manly odor,") or
when, as Leon Spinks, he told
Howard Cossell his favorite as
pect of boxing, (Howard, I like
to hear their nose crunch,")
hysterical laughter filled the
club.

Anne and Jon Fox, "will be de
dicated to showcasing the best
young comedy talent in the
country." Jon Fox says,"It has
taken years of hard work to
elevate the comedy scene in
San Francisco out of cof
feehouse cellars and off nights
at sceptical nightclubs."
Street-wise
Opening night's master of
ceremonies was Marty Cohen,
runner-up in the third annual
San Francisco International
Open Stand-up Comedy Com
petition. Cohen quickly won
the audience with his fast
talking, street-wise manner.
He showed an alacrity for
mimicking anyone from an an
nouncer for car races to dis
tainful women. At ease on
stage, he occasionally inter
rupted his performance yel
ling, "Hey, can you turn up that
music?," toward the Old Wal
dorf or pointing into space and
saying, "Wait, there's a place
here with no smoke. Can we
get a little more smoke in
here?" During technical dif
ficulties, he chatted with the
audience and gathered jokes
from the more vocal members.
Jack Marion, third place
winner of the SFIOSUCC, was
the first act. Marion related
personal anecdotes about
being a barker for nude shows
on North Beach, his difficulties
with fluffy toilet seat covers
and girls with deadly stiff bouf
fant hair-dos, and his encoun
ters with San Francisco's more

unique residents.
After Marion, the decep
tively ordinary-looking impre
ssionist, Jim Giovanni, took the
stage. Giovanni's presenta
tions of the incongruous —
Redd Foxx as THE EXHORCIST,
or Tommy Smothers reciting
Shakespeare, were funny, but
truth is stranger than fiction.
When the ingenuous Giovanni
donned a swimming cap and
wide grin as the women's cap
tain of the East German swim
team, or when he covered
himself with shaving cream
("Ahh, it's a manly odor,") or
when, as Leon Spinks, he told
Howard Cossell his favorite as
pect of boxing, (Howard, I like
to hear their nose crunch,")
hysterical laughter filled the
club.
Live music
Next Rick, of Rick and Ruby,
stepped on stage wearing a
"Village People" t-shirt, and
carrying a guitar. I am still sur
prised at the amount of noise
one man can make. The slen
der Rick proved amazingly
energetic and quickened the
already fast-paced show with a
medley of songs. We heard
Johnny Cash singing "I Am
Woman," Donovan's version
of "Jumbalya," Barry White's
rendition of the same song,
K.C. and the Sunshine Band's
disco interpretation, and fi
nally the Ohio Players singing it
to the tune of "Love Roller
Coaster." The audience,

primed so, surely must have
drowned out the music next
door when Rick introduced
himself as Neil Diamond,
America's first singing stand
up comic, and proceeded to
sing Henny Youngman one
liners to "I Am I Said."
And there was still more.
Bob Sarlatte of Butch Wacks
and the Glass Packs, a comedy
rock group, closed the show.
Sarlatte jumped from one topic
to another, from one laugh to
another. Among many others,
he lighted upon the subjects of
professional bartenders
school, and sources of
amusement in a Safeway store.
Energy and Enthusiasm
Without a doubt, the Punch
Line will provide some of the
best entertainment in the Bay
Area. The energy and en
thusiasm which went into last
Tuesday's performances
should increase as the attrac
tive, 175 seat club establishes
itself. New headlines will ap
pear Wednesday through
Saturday. "Sunday will be set
aside for a showcase of top
up-and-coming San Francisco
comedy talent."
After all, Los Angeles and
New York have their all
comedy nightclubs — it's
about time San Francisco
began to take care of its own.
The Punch Line is located (you
guessed it) next to the Old
Waldorf, at 444-A Battery St.
San Francisco.
