White House endorses tax cut
Washington — The White House guardedly en
dorsed yesterday the $18.7 billion tax cut Congress
approved in its windup session, with a spokesman
describing the final product as markedly improved
over costlier versions President Jimmy Carter had
threatened to veto.
Rex Granum, deputy White House press secret
ary, said while "we certainly can t commit the pres
ident to signing or vetoing a bill until he has done
so . . . there certainly were significant improve
ments in the tax bill."
But the final, formal version of the measure
probably won't reach him for days, as legislative
aides work on the mountain of paper Congress left
behind from the furious last days of the session
which ended Sunday.
Vance delivers letter to Botha
Pretoria, South Africa — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance handed South African leaders a letter from
President ]immy Carter yesterday as five Western
countries tried to persuade the South Africans to
accept new negotiations for independence in
South-West Africa.
American sources said Vance and William Ed
mondson, the U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
met privately with Prime Minister Pieter Botha to
deliver the letter.
The contents were not disclosed, but it was pre
sumed to contain a personal appeal from Carter
aimed at softening South Africa's opposition to a
U.N. plan for transition to independence and
black-majority rule in South-West Africa.
Ethics panel releases report
Washington — The Senate ethics committee said
yesterday it found "substantial credible evidence"
that either Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.) or one of his
aides broke the law in the Korean influence
buying scandal.
The committee asked the Justice Department to
consider prosecution.
However, the committee also said it found no
evidence that South Korean gifts to senators ever
succeeded in influencing any of them.
The ethics committee in its final report said it is
asking the Justice Department to determine
whether perjury charges would be justified in
connection with payments to Bayh and two former
senators and whether Bayh or an aide broke the
law by taking $1000 in the Capitol.
A 1948 law, apparently never enforced, prohibits
congressmen from accepting contributions on
federal property. Bayh has denied he took the

money in the Capitol.
The committee said it found "substantial credi
ble evidence" that either Bayh or an aide, Jason
Berman, took $1000 from a lobbyist friend of Ko
rean businessman Tungsun Park s during a meet
ing in the Capitol on Oct. 8, 1974.
Bayh and Berman denied either of them got any
money from Park and said the $1000 was legally
received through the mail and not in Bayh s
Capitol office.
High Court upholds Nazi rally
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday let
stand lower court decisions striking down as un
constitutional attempts to ban Nazi demonstra
tions in Skokie, 111.
The justices voted to reject arguments that the
Nazis' free speech rights must yield to the rights of
the Chicago suburb's many Jewish residents.
Yesterday's action, growing out of a legal fight
that began last year, should carry no immediate
repercussions for Skokie. The small group of
American Nazis that had wanted to demonstrate
there held two rallies in Chicago last summer —
after winning court permission to do so in Skokie.
But now the legal precedent set by lower court
rulings in the Skokie case will apply unless over
ruled by the Supreme Court to any confrontation
between the suburb's officials and the Nazis.
Younger seeks more freeways
Santa Barbara — Attorney General Evelle
Younger, Republican candidate for governor, yes
terday criticized Gov. Jerry Brown for not building
enough freeways.
Meanwhile, Democrats kept up the drumbeat of
criticism over the Younger campaign's hiring of
two private investigators to look into Brown's past.
Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-San Fran
cisco), called for an investigation of whether the
two, who were later fired, had access to files kept
by Younger's Department of Justice.
In attacking Brown, Younger said, "The average
Californian wants to get to work on time and to be
home to see the 6 o'clock news.
"Freeways that are desperately needed are just
not being constructed."
He renewed his accusation that Brown's De
partment of Transportation has been deliberately
withholding freeway construction money. De
partment officials deny it.
With the first Brown-Younger debate scheduled
tomorrow night, the Democratic governor
scheduled only one public appearance yesterday,
a legislative fund-raiser, and spent the rest of the
day workingon state business, according to aides.

Smith will discuss conference
Los Angeles — Rhodesian Prime Minister lan
Smith said yesterday he will happily accept a White
House invitation to discuss a possible conference
with guerrilla leaders.
He adaed that President Jimmy Carter's "misin
formation" on the Rhodesia question had been a
chief impediment to planning such an all-parties
conference in the past.
The State Department announced earlier that
Smith would be invited to Washington because of
the prime minister's statement to a Senate com
mittee that he was prepared to meet with guerrilla
leaders.
Smith, in town on part of a nationwide public
relations tour designed to gain support for his
transition government, said he has always favored
an "all-party" conference. He said the real reason
Carter wants to meet with him is that his tour of the
nation has engendered public support for his posi
tion.
American wins Nobel prize
Stockholm, Sweden — American economist Her
bert Simon won the 1978 Nobel prize in economic
science yesterday for pioneering research on how
complex organizations, such as multinational
companies, make business decisions.
The 62-year-old professor at Carnegie Mellon
University, in Pennsylvania, also was hailed by the
Swedish Academy of Sciences for his broad re
search in social science fields.
A Milwaukee native, Simon is the seventh
American to receive the economics prize in 10
years and is the fourth U.S. Nobel laureate to be
named this year.

New York — The stock market took its sharpest
drop of the year yesterday in a steady slide blamed
on gloom over the outlook for interest rates and
the dollar.

21.92 to 875.17, for its largest loss since it fell 22.69
Nov. 18,1974 in the final throes of the 1973-74 bear
market.
