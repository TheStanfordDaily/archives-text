# Winter: more authority for police
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
If he is elected Santa Clara
County sheriff, Robert Winter
said he will give University police
more power and authority.
Winter, a sheriff's lieutenant
with 25 years in law enforcement,
is running against his boss, lames
Geary this November.
Currently, the University relies
on the county for police protec
tion, Winter said, because Leland
Stanford's will prohibits incor
porating University lands and only
incorporated cities can form in
dependent police departments.
So, under a eight-year-old ag
reement, the University Depart
ment of Public Safety's officers are
designated reserve county de
puties. They are given limited
duties, Winter said, and must re
port to the sheriff's department,
before they can handle "high
level felonies," like rape, murder
or grand theft.
Winter wants to grant campus
police full deputy status, standard
rank of county officers.
Problems
Winter sees several problems
with the present system. He de
scribed a situation, in which a
University officer arrives at a
crime scene and, because of his
limited powers, he can only wait
until help arrives. He could arrest
suspects in the immediate area,
Winter said, but he could not start
an investigation to pick up fleeing
suspects' trails.
Because the nearest regular de
puty patrol area is two or three
miles away, Winter said consider

able delays are possible.
Before this reserve-deputy ar
rangement, the campus was pat
rolled by private guards. Under
that agreement, officers were not
given full powers, because they
lacked proper training, Winter
said.
Now, "their education is the
highest in the department." He
said Stanford officers are well
screened, familiar with land, staff
and students and "are the most
qualified to patrol the campus ef
fectively."
Other plans
Winter has other plans for im
proving efficiency.
The sheriff's department is
headquartered in San lose, but
because the city has its own police
force, deputies do not patrol
there.
Instead, major areas of respon
sibility lie along the eastern and
western rims of the Santa Clara
Valley.
Winter said he wants to estab
lish field headquarters in areas ac
tually patrolled by officers. Not
only would this save large sums of
money, he said, but it would
create a "closer community
liaison" between police and the
citizens.
He said that 10 percent of offic
ers' time is spent driving between
headquarters and patrol areas.
Basing officers in their patrol
areas would help them become
involved in the community,
Winter said, and would make
people more tolerant and helpful.
"The foundation of good police
work is the dialogue between citi-

Zen and policeman ... I can't
overemphasize the importance of
community feeling," he said.
Under Winter's plan, each of
ficer would be able to choose
where he wanted to patrol, but
the candidate expected most
would choose to work close to
home.
Off-duty tips
Winter said he has solved many
cases in his off-duty hours, when
his neighbors casually mentioned
incidents they witnessed, which
turned out to be vital clues.
The field headquarters idea is
not new, he said. It has been used
successfully throughout Califor
nia. 1

Winter attacked the current
sheriff's administration for creat
ing a morale problem in the de
partment. Twenty-five percent of
Santa Clara's deputies leave the
department each year, he said, as
opposed to a turnover rate of only
3 percent in San Mateo County.
The high attrition rate costs the
department heavily, Winter said.
Training replacements is costly,
more than $2.5 million a year, and
officer efficiency drops, Winter
said.
A 10-year veteran makes far
fewer mistakes than a two-year
rookie, he said.
Part of the problem is the pre-


Robert Winter
sent administration's "arbitrary"
handling of personnel, Winter
said. They reassign officers with
out concern for their wishes, he
explained. Other counties use
psychological testing to deter
mine how officers will react to
stress. Santa Clara doesn't use
tests, even though they are ex
tremely effective in determining
assignments.
Deputies' support
Incumbent sheriffs are rarely
beaten, but Winter has earned the
deputy sheriff's association 96
percent endorsement in his cam
paign against Geary.
He is proud of this support from
the people who, he said, know
and have worked with both can
didates.
Winter and Geary survived an
unusually crowded primary field
of eight candidates to face each
other in the general election.
The atmosphere in a depart
ment where employee is challeng
ing boss for the top job, has been,
for Winter at least, "electric, really
electric."

the candidate expected most
would choose to work close to
home.
Off-duty tips
Winter said he has solved many
cases in his off-duty hours, when
his neighbors casually mentioned
incidents they witnessed, which
turned out to be vital clues.
The field headquarters idea is
not new, he said. It has been used
successfully throughout Califor
nia. 1

Winter attacked the current
sheriff's administration for creat
ing a morale problem in the de
partment. Twenty-five percent of
Santa Clara's deputies leave the
department each year, he said, as
opposed to a turnover rate of only
3 percent in San Mateo County.
The high attrition rate costs the
department heavily, Winter said.
Training replacements is costly,
more than $2.5 million a year, and
officer efficiency drops, Winter
said.
A 10-year veteran makes far
fewer mistakes than a two-year
rookie, he said.
Part of the problem is the pre-


Robert Winter
sent administration's "arbitrary"
handling of personnel, Winter
said. They reassign officers with
out concern for their wishes, he
explained. Other counties use
psychological testing to deter
mine how officers will react to
stress. Santa Clara doesn't use
tests, even though they are ex
tremely effective in determining
assignments.
Deputies' support
Incumbent sheriffs are rarely
beaten, but Winter has earned the
deputy sheriff's association 96
percent endorsement in his cam
paign against Geary.
He is proud of this support from
the people who, he said, know
and have worked with both can
didates.
Winter and Geary survived an
unusually crowded primary field
of eight candidates to face each
other in the general election.
The atmosphere in a depart
ment where employee is challeng
ing boss for the top job, has been,
for Winter at least, "electric, really
electric."
If he is elected Santa Clara
County sheriff, Robert Winter
said he will give University police
more power and authority.
Winter, a sheriff's lieutenant
with 25 years in law enforcement,
is running against his boss, lames
Geary this November.
Currently, the University relies
on the county for police protec
tion, Winter said, because Leland
Stanford's will prohibits incor
porating University lands and only
incorporated cities can form in
dependent police departments.
So, under a eight-year-old ag
reement, the University Depart
ment of Public Safety's officers are
designated reserve county de
puties. They are given limited
duties, Winter said, and must re
port to the sheriff's department,
before they can handle "high
level felonies," like rape, murder
or grand theft.
Winter wants to grant campus
police full deputy status, standard
rank of county officers.
Problems
Winter sees several problems
with the present system. He de
scribed a situation, in which a
University officer arrives at a
crime scene and, because of his
limited powers, he can only wait
until help arrives. He could arrest
suspects in the immediate area,
Winter said, but he could not start
an investigation to pick up fleeing
suspects' trails.
Because the nearest regular de
puty patrol area is two or three
miles away, Winter said consider

able delays are possible.
Before this reserve-deputy ar
rangement, the campus was pat
rolled by private guards. Under
that agreement, officers were not
given full powers, because they
lacked proper training, Winter
said.
Now, "their education is the
highest in the department." He
said Stanford officers are well
screened, familiar with land, staff
and students and "are the most
qualified to patrol the campus ef
fectively."
Other plans
Winter has other plans for im
proving efficiency.
The sheriff's department is
headquartered in San lose, but
because the city has its own police
force, deputies do not patrol
there.
Instead, major areas of respon
sibility lie along the eastern and
western rims of the Santa Clara
Valley.
Winter said he wants to estab
lish field headquarters in areas ac
tually patrolled by officers. Not
only would this save large sums of
money, he said, but it would
create a "closer community
liaison" between police and the
citizens.
He said that 10 percent of offic
ers' time is spent driving between
headquarters and patrol areas.
Basing officers in their patrol
areas would help them become
involved in the community,
Winter said, and would make
people more tolerant and helpful.
"The foundation of good police
work is the dialogue between citi-

Zen and policeman ... I can't
overemphasize the importance of
community feeling," he said.
Under Winter's plan, each of
ficer would be able to choose
where he wanted to patrol, but

crime scene and, because of his
limited powers, he can only wait
until help arrives. He could arrest
suspects in the immediate area,
Winter said, but he could not start
an investigation to pick up fleeing
suspects' trails.
Because the nearest regular de
puty patrol area is two or three
miles away, Winter said consider

able delays are possible.
Before this reserve-deputy ar
rangement, the campus was pat
rolled by private guards. Under
that agreement, officers were not
given full powers, because they
lacked proper training, Winter
said.
Now, "their education is the
highest in the department." He
said Stanford officers are well
screened, familiar with land, staff
and students and "are the most
qualified to patrol the campus ef
fectively."
Other plans
Winter has other plans for im
proving efficiency.
The sheriff's department is
headquartered in San lose, but
because the city has its own police
force, deputies do not patrol
there.
Instead, major areas of respon
sibility lie along the eastern and
western rims of the Santa Clara
Valley.
Winter said he wants to estab
lish field headquarters in areas ac
tually patrolled by officers. Not
only would this save large sums of
money, he said, but it would
create a "closer community
liaison" between police and the
citizens.
He said that 10 percent of offic
ers' time is spent driving between
headquarters and patrol areas.
Basing officers in their patrol
areas would help them become
involved in the community,
Winter said, and would make
people more tolerant and helpful.
"The foundation of good police
work is the dialogue between citi-

Zen and policeman ... I can't
overemphasize the importance of
community feeling," he said.
Under Winter's plan, each of
ficer would be able to choose
where he wanted to patrol, but
the candidate expected most
would choose to work close to
home.
Off-duty tips
Winter said he has solved many
cases in his off-duty hours, when
his neighbors casually mentioned
incidents they witnessed, which
turned out to be vital clues.
The field headquarters idea is
not new, he said. It has been used
successfully throughout Califor
nia. 1

Winter attacked the current
sheriff's administration for creat
ing a morale problem in the de
partment. Twenty-five percent of
Santa Clara's deputies leave the
department each year, he said, as
opposed to a turnover rate of only
3 percent in San Mateo County.
The high attrition rate costs the
department heavily, Winter said.
Training replacements is costly,
more than $2.5 million a year, and
officer efficiency drops, Winter
said.
A 10-year veteran makes far
fewer mistakes than a two-year
rookie, he said.
Part of the problem is the pre-


Robert Winter
sent administration's "arbitrary"
handling of personnel, Winter
said. They reassign officers with
out concern for their wishes, he
explained. Other counties use
psychological testing to deter
mine how officers will react to
stress. Santa Clara doesn't use
tests, even though they are ex
tremely effective in determining
assignments.
Deputies' support
Incumbent sheriffs are rarely
beaten, but Winter has earned the
deputy sheriff's association 96
percent endorsement in his cam
paign against Geary.
He is proud of this support from
the people who, he said, know
and have worked with both can
didates.
Winter and Geary survived an
unusually crowded primary field
of eight candidates to face each
other in the general election.
The atmosphere in a depart
ment where employee is challeng
ing boss for the top job, has been,
for Winter at least, "electric, really
electric."
