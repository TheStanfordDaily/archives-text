# First non-Italian in 455 years
## Church elects pope 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — The cardinals
of the Roman Catholic Church yes
terday elected 58-year-old Polish
Cardinal Karol Wojtyla pope, the first
non-Italian in 455 years to lead the
700 million-member church.
Wojtyla took the name John Paul,
the same as his predecessor, and told
cheering throngs in St. Peter's
Square he had been afraid of the
nomination, but accepted the post
"in the spirit of obedience to Our
Lord."
Wojtyla, little-known archbishop
of Krakow, is the 263 rd successor to
the Throne of St. Peter.
The election of a prelate from a
communist nation will have vast re
percussions on relations between
Rome and the East bloc.
White smoke, the traditional signal
that a pontiff is chosen, billowed into
the night from the Sistine Chapel at
6:10 p.m. (10:18 a.m. PDT).
"It is official, the pope is elected,"
Vatican radio said.
First appearance
Wojtyla later made his first public
appearance as pope, waving, smil
ing, raising his eyes heavenward as
hundreds of thousands of well
wishers roared their approval.
Speaking in excellent Italian, he
told them, "Let |esus Christ be
praised. Dearest brothers and sisters
we are still all grieved after the death
of the most beloved pope, John Paul
I. . . .
"The most reverend cardinals have
called a new bishop of Rome. They
have called him from a distant coun
try," he continued.
"I was afraid to receive this nomi
nation, but I did it in the spirit of
obedience to our Lord and in the
total confidence in Our Mother."
The 111 cardinal-electors, meeting
for the second time in two months,
made their decision in the second
day of voting in theirsecret conclave.
Pope John Paul I, the new pope's
predecessor, died Sept. 28 after a
reign of only 34 days.
The last non-Italian pontiff was
Dutchman Adrian VI, who reigned in
1522-23.
Youngest pope
Wojtyla is the youngest man to as
sume the papacy in this century.
The selection of the Polish ar
chbishop satisfied one of the condi
tions expressed by cardinals before
the conclave — that Pope John Paul's
successor also have a pastoral
background.
But, again, the cardinals picked a
man, whose experience in the Vati
can's administrative machinery was
minimal.
His election was viewed as another
step in the church's internationaliza
tion, a process spurred by Pope Paul
VI.
For this reason, many Catholic
scholars here were jubilant over the

choice, calling it historic.
The new pope, born in Wadowice,
Poland, on May 18, 1920, was ele
vated to cardinal by Pope Paul VI 11
years ago and is a member of several
Vatican congregations — Sacraments
and Divine Worship, Clergy and
Catholic Education.
He was born the son of a chemical
factory worker, and has a good work
ing relationship with the communist
government of Poland.
Theology student
He studied philosophy and theol
ogy at the seminary in Krakow and,
after his ordination, went to Rome to
study at the Angelicum College,
where he earned a doctorate in
philosophy in 1948.
After his return to Poland, which
coincided with the rise of the new

communist government, he worked
under severe restrictions as parish
assistant in his archdiocese of
Krakow.
At the same time, he acted as stu
dent counselor at the local univer
sity.
The Rev. Robert kohlhass, a Ger
man Benedictine official, said Woj
tyla, whose name is pronounced
"Voy-tee'-wah," is "very popular in
his home archdiocese" and "a strong
supporter of the reform of the Sec
ond Vatican Council."
Firm stand
As for his dealings with the Com
munists, Kohlhass said, "He often let
them have a piece of his mind. He
has taken a very firm stand. Poland is
communist-ruled hut the govern
