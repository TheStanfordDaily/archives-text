### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
In August 1976, Cardinal Karol
Wojtyla of Poland visited San Fran
cisco. He was escorted through
Chinatown, shown the city lights
from a lookout point near Golden
Gate Bridge andtreatedto lunch by
Witold Sworakowski, a retired as
sociate director of Hoover Institu
tion.
Yesterday, Cardinal Wojtyla was
elected pope.
"I was completely caught by sur
prise, " Sworakowski said last night.
"I was expecting an Italian pope.
That was the rule."
Sworakowski met the new John
Paul II through the Polish American
Congress of the Bay Area. The cardi
nal had traveled to the United States
for a Catholic assembly in Philadel
phia and later flew to Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
"I have a tape-recording of the
cardinal speaking at the reception we
gave him in San Francisco's Polish
church," Sworakowski said, "but it's
all in Polish."

Sworakowski described the new
pope as a "conservative man in the
church, but progressively social."
"He has been very popular with
the workers," Sworakowski said.
"He is the son of a factory worker
and; while he was studying in high
school and in the university, he
worked in a factory so he could earn
money.
"He knows the work side ot life,"
he added.
The cardinal's immense popularity
with the Polish workers save the
"outspoken anti-communist" from
arrest by the government,
Sworakowski said.
"The communist government tried
to avoid confrontations with him,"
he explained. "They are probably
pleased that he's now in Rome and
out of Poland.
Sworakowski refused to predict
the new pope's stands on birth con
trol or on other controversial issues
in the Roman Catholic Church.
"Any guesswork is out of the ques
tion," Sworakowski said. "After all,
he is the pope."
