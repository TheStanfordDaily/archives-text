# Questions left about theme house policy
## 
### NEIL MACFARQUHAR 
Questions remain, despite an in
vestigation on theme-house policy,
after Androgyny House was replaced
by Haus Mittle Europa last spring.
Residential education director
Norman Robinson said the inves
tigating committee faded oul and no
report has been filed.
Several students are still trying to
compile a study on how the Office of
Residential Education (ORE) makes
decisions on special-priority houses.
"A report is still in the workings,
but it has been put on the back
burner for the time being," said Mike
Shuman, a former Androgyny resi
dent and member of the ORE com
mittee.
"Members not showing up was the
main reason the committee died,"
he said, "but we're trying to draw up
a recommendation, so that decisions
by ORE will not be made with the
same carelessness, which occurred
with Androgyny House."
Closure explained
In a letter to Androgyny residents
last year, Robinson said the house
was closed because of "concerns
about the viability of the academic
program, along with reservations
about house leadership for next
year."
Androgyny residents added a re
ferendum to the spring ASSU ballot,
seeking a committee to investigate
the ORE decision-making process.
They wanted "to study the undue
amount of autocratic power of ORE
and to get them to define the rigid
criteria, which they judged the house
with and which remain undefined,"
Shuman said.
So, he and other former commit
tee members began pushing for a re
view of ORE policy.
Theme-house decisions are ulti
mately made by Robinson according
to James Lyons, dean of student af
fairs.
Although he consults with them,
Robinson has the power to veto re
commendations from COSS-R, the
student subcommittee on resi
dences, and the Configuration Ad
visory panel, another housing review
board.
Committee members drew up

proposals for improving ORE theme
house-evaluation, but these were
never submitted, because the group
dissolved, Shuman said.
The proposals included a one-year
trial period for every theme house,
unless it displays an "especially poor
performance."
Also, houses which ORE considers
closing, should be warned by spring
quarter of the first year or fall quarter
of the second year before closure.
After this warning, houses should
be given specific requirements for
improvement, the committee said. It
also suggested that ORE help houses
succeed in every way.
Alice Supton, assistant dean for re
sidential education, said there was a
lack of communication, between
ORE and Androgyny, about specific
requirements.
She added, however, that the stu
dents were told they had to be "more
specific about proposed academic
programs" and they "needed to
utilize more faculty and community
resources to enhance their personal
living experiences in the house."
Several members of the ORE
committee wanted the evaluation
rules codified. They suggested pub
lishing specific guidelines on theme
house acceptability. They also
thought ORE should publish its
methods of interpreting theme
house proposals and should clarify
whether proposals are contracts or
flexible sets of guidelines.
Report asked
The committee also said COSS-R
should publish a report independent
of ORE, before final decisions are
made.
This suggestion stemmed from
student complaints that they had no
power in theme-house decisions,
said Carla Lupi, a former Androgyny
resident.
A situation similar to the An
drogyny case should not reoccur,
because of a new ORE policy that
limits theme house proposal review
to two-year intervals.
"There was a feeling that allowing
annual theme house proposals
created unreal expectations, be
cause every new house must elimi
nate an old one," said Dean Lyons.

vestigation on theme-house policy,

closing, should be warned by spring
quarter of the first year or fall quarter
of the second year before closure.
After this warning, houses should
be given specific requirements for
improvement, the committee said. It
also suggested that ORE help houses
succeed in every way.
Alice Supton, assistant dean for re
sidential education, said there was a
lack of communication, between
ORE and Androgyny, about specific
requirements.
She added, however, that the stu
dents were told they had to be "more
specific about proposed academic
programs" and they "needed to
utilize more faculty and community
resources to enhance their personal
living experiences in the house."
Several members of the ORE
committee wanted the evaluation
rules codified. They suggested pub
lishing specific guidelines on theme
house acceptability. They also
thought ORE should publish its
methods of interpreting theme
house proposals and should clarify
whether proposals are contracts or
flexible sets of guidelines.
Report asked
The committee also said COSS-R
should publish a report independent
of ORE, before final decisions are
made.
This suggestion stemmed from
student complaints that they had no
power in theme-house decisions,
said Carla Lupi, a former Androgyny
resident.
A situation similar to the An
drogyny case should not reoccur,
because of a new ORE policy that
limits theme house proposal review
to two-year intervals.
"There was a feeling that allowing
annual theme house proposals
created unreal expectations, be
cause every new house must elimi
nate an old one," said Dean Lyons.
Questions remain, despite an in
vestigation on theme-house policy,
after Androgyny House was replaced
by Haus Mittle Europa last spring.
Residential education director
Norman Robinson said the inves
tigating committee faded oul and no
report has been filed.
Several students are still trying to
compile a study on how the Office of
Residential Education (ORE) makes
decisions on special-priority houses.
"A report is still in the workings,
but it has been put on the back
burner for the time being," said Mike
Shuman, a former Androgyny resi
dent and member of the ORE com
mittee.
"Members not showing up was the
main reason the committee died,"
he said, "but we're trying to draw up
a recommendation, so that decisions
by ORE will not be made with the
same carelessness, which occurred
with Androgyny House."
Closure explained
In a letter to Androgyny residents
last year, Robinson said the house
was closed because of "concerns
about the viability of the academic
program, along with reservations
about house leadership for next
year."
Androgyny residents added a re
ferendum to the spring ASSU ballot,
seeking a committee to investigate
the ORE decision-making process.
They wanted "to study the undue
amount of autocratic power of ORE
and to get them to define the rigid
criteria, which they judged the house
with and which remain undefined,"
Shuman said.
So, he and other former commit
tee members began pushing for a re
view of ORE policy.
Theme-house decisions are ulti
mately made by Robinson according
to James Lyons, dean of student af
fairs.
Although he consults with them,
Robinson has the power to veto re
commendations from COSS-R, the
student subcommittee on resi
dences, and the Configuration Ad
visory panel, another housing review
board.
Committee members drew up

proposals for improving ORE theme
house-evaluation, but these were
never submitted, because the group
dissolved, Shuman said.
The proposals included a one-year
trial period for every theme house,
unless it displays an "especially poor
performance."
Also, houses which ORE considers
closing, should be warned by spring
quarter of the first year or fall quarter
of the second year before closure.
