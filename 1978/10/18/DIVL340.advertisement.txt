I would like to extend an open letter of apology
to Lively Arts of Stanford and the Stanford com
munity as a whole. It concerns the advertising for
the performance of Soprano Clamma Dale and Ed
ward Albee. On Friday, we ran the Edward Albee ad
for his show on Oct. 9 rather than for Clamma Dale
on Friday night. We regret the mix up and hope to
catch further problems such as this in the future.
Sincerely yours,
John Zaro
Advertising Manager
