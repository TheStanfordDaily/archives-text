# Promises 'ministry of love' will mark reign
## Pope pledges reforms 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — Pope John Paul II promised yester
day that a "ministry of love" would mark his reign as the
264 th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.
In a televised sermon delivered under Michelangelo's
fresco "The Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel, the
pope pledged to carry on the church reforms launched
by the Second Vatican Council of 1962 to '65 and to
follow the guidelines laid down by Paul VI and John Paul
I.
Vatican officials, meanwhile, announced that John
Paul would preside at a Mass at his installation on Sun
day. The announcement made no mention of a corona
tion, implying that he would continue the pattern of
John Paul I, who refused to be crowned the temporal
ruler of the church.
From Warsaw, Polish Communist leader Edward
Cierek sent a message to the pope, saying his election
"fills Poland with great satisfaction" and that he was
"convinced that further development of relations bet
ween Poland and the Apostolic See" would come about.
In his first papal sermon, the 58-year-old pontiff
warned that the "general criteria of loyalty to the Vatican
Council" must not affect loyalty to the basic doctrinal
truths of the church.
This was perhaps an indication that he would pursue a
conservative stance on such matters as the church's ban
on artificial contraception, the ordination of women and
the marriage of priests.
The pope supported the contraception ban put forth
in Pope Paul Vl's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae when he
was archbishop of Krakow.
Clad in the traditional papal robes of brilliant white
satin and a red skullcap, the pope celebrated Mass
jointly with the cardinals who elected him Monday. He
delivered a half hour sermon in Latin and then released
the 110 men from the secret conclave where they had
been sequestered since Saturday afternoon.
The former Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, Poland,
also took a trip outside Vatican walls on his first full day
as leader of the world's 700 million Catholics — to visit a
"very dear friend" who had suffered a heart attack.
He visited Polish Bishop Andre-Marie Deskur, 54,
head of the Pontifical Commission for Social Communi
cation. Deskur was taken to a hospital about two miles
from the Vatican Friday after suffering a heart attack.
Thousands, alerted by a radio announcement that he
would make the trip, lined the streets to cheer the pope,
who waved and smiled as he drove by.

The election of Wojtyla as successor to Pope John Paul
I broke the 4Vi century hold Italians had on the papacy.
And the selection of a prelate from Poland, where more
than 90 percent of its 35 million residents are Catholic,
appeared to point out the vitality of the church in an era
when religious faith is threatened.
If the nationality issue did not stalemate the secret
deliberations, neither did political considerations,
American cardinals told a joint news conference.
"It was not political in any way," said Cardinal john
Dearden of Detroit.
Cardinal John Krol of Philadelphia said the conclave
was "aware" of the fact that a pope from communist
Poland may put the church on a collision course with
communism. But that "had no part whatever in the elec
tion," Krol said.
Cardinal Franz Koenig of Vienna, Austria, said the
Polish prelate had been favored in the voting by the
Italian cardinals while the "foreigners" leaned toward
maintaining the Italian line.
Koenig, one of the Vatican's troubleshooters in rela
tions with communist governments, called the new pon
tiff "the right man in the right place" and said he be
lieved he would continue the dialogue with communist
regimes "in his own way."
In his address, the pontiff said the church has "no
intention of political interference, nor participation in
the working of temporal affairs."
He said, "We would like to reach out our hands and
open our hearts in this moment, to all people and to
those who are oppressed by whatever injustices or dis
crimination — whether it has to do with economy, life in
society, political life or the freedom of conscience and
just religious freedom.
"We must reach out with all means to them, that all
forms of injustice manifest in our times be rejected by
public opinion."
The address was televised live in Poland. John Paul
saluted his fellow countrymen of "our Poland" as "al
ways faithful."

The election of Wojtyla as successor to Pope John Paul
I broke the 4Vi century hold Italians had on the papacy.
And the selection of a prelate from Poland, where more
than 90 percent of its 35 million residents are Catholic,
appeared to point out the vitality of the church in an era
when religious faith is threatened.
If the nationality issue did not stalemate the secret
deliberations, neither did political considerations,
American cardinals told a joint news conference.
"It was not political in any way," said Cardinal john
Dearden of Detroit.
Cardinal John Krol of Philadelphia said the conclave
was "aware" of the fact that a pope from communist
Poland may put the church on a collision course with
communism. But that "had no part whatever in the elec
tion," Krol said.
Cardinal Franz Koenig of Vienna, Austria, said the
Polish prelate had been favored in the voting by the
Italian cardinals while the "foreigners" leaned toward
maintaining the Italian line.
Koenig, one of the Vatican's troubleshooters in rela
tions with communist governments, called the new pon
tiff "the right man in the right place" and said he be
lieved he would continue the dialogue with communist
regimes "in his own way."
In his address, the pontiff said the church has "no
intention of political interference, nor participation in
the working of temporal affairs."
He said, "We would like to reach out our hands and
open our hearts in this moment, to all people and to
those who are oppressed by whatever injustices or dis
crimination — whether it has to do with economy, life in
society, political life or the freedom of conscience and
just religious freedom.
"We must reach out with all means to them, that all
forms of injustice manifest in our times be rejected by
public opinion."

saluted his fellow countrymen of "our Poland" as "al

Vatican City (AP) — Pope John Paul II promised yester
day that a "ministry of love" would mark his reign as the
264 th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.
In a televised sermon delivered under Michelangelo's
fresco "The Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel, the
pope pledged to carry on the church reforms launched
by the Second Vatican Council of 1962 to '65 and to
follow the guidelines laid down by Paul VI and John Paul
I.
Vatican officials, meanwhile, announced that John
Paul would preside at a Mass at his installation on Sun
day. The announcement made no mention of a corona
tion, implying that he would continue the pattern of
John Paul I, who refused to be crowned the temporal
ruler of the church.
From Warsaw, Polish Communist leader Edward
Cierek sent a message to the pope, saying his election
"fills Poland with great satisfaction" and that he was
"convinced that further development of relations bet
ween Poland and the Apostolic See" would come about.
In his first papal sermon, the 58-year-old pontiff
warned that the "general criteria of loyalty to the Vatican
Council" must not affect loyalty to the basic doctrinal
truths of the church.
This was perhaps an indication that he would pursue a
conservative stance on such matters as the church's ban
on artificial contraception, the ordination of women and
the marriage of priests.
The pope supported the contraception ban put forth
in Pope Paul Vl's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae when he
was archbishop of Krakow.
Clad in the traditional papal robes of brilliant white
satin and a red skullcap, the pope celebrated Mass
jointly with the cardinals who elected him Monday. He
delivered a half hour sermon in Latin and then released
the 110 men from the secret conclave where they had
been sequestered since Saturday afternoon.
The former Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, Poland,
also took a trip outside Vatican walls on his first full day
as leader of the world's 700 million Catholics — to visit a
"very dear friend" who had suffered a heart attack.
He visited Polish Bishop Andre-Marie Deskur, 54,
head of the Pontifical Commission for Social Communi
cation. Deskur was taken to a hospital about two miles
from the Vatican Friday after suffering a heart attack.
Thousands, alerted by a radio announcement that he
would make the trip, lined the streets to cheer the pope,
who waved and smiled as he drove by.
