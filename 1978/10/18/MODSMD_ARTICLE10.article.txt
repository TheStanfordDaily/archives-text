# Will he receive tenure this year?
## Economics Prof. Foley returns 
### KEVIN COX 
Duncan Foley, an associate
professor of economics here,
whose denial of tenure in May
1976 caused controversy
among both students and fa
culty in the economics de
partment, has returned after a
two-year absence. He will
teach classes during spring
quarter.
Foley is serving the last year
of a second three-year teach
ing appointment, made in Sep
tember 1976. Economics Prof.
John Curley said that the
economics department will
make its final decision on
whether or not to tenure Foley
late this quarter or early winter
quarter.
Details of the May 1976 meet
ing, in which all tenured
economics professors voted to
delay any decision on the pos
sible tenure of Foley at that
time, and hence to deny te
nure, are still not clear and pro
fessors are not in agreement
concerning them.
Foley was appointed to a
three-year term in the depart
ment in the fall of 1973. When
he was hired, he was given
"the promise of an early deci
sion on tenure," he told the
Daily on May 12,1976. That de
cision was postponed in De
cember 1975, which marked
the beginning of the second
year of Foley's assignment.
In the spring of 1976, how
ever, an economics search and
tenure committee composed
of Emeritus Prof. Tibor Sci
tovsky, Curley and Prof. David
Starrett, recommended that
Foley be granted tenure. In
April 1976, however, the
economics department again
voted to postpone a decision.
New faculty tenure decisions
are normally made during the

second year of a three-year ap
pointment.
According to Bert Hickman,
chairman of the economics
department, Foley "wasn't de
nied tenure. He was just reap
pointed for his second three
year term." Asked about Daily
articles, reporting that the
economics department had
voted to delay the decision and
hence to deny Foley tenure in
1976, Hickman said that he
"can't be responsible for what
interpretation is placed on
events by The Stanford Daily."
An estimated 85 percent of
the students enrolled in
economics courses did not at
tend class on May 19, 1976 be
cause they were upset that they
had not been allowed to par
ticipate in the tenure decision.
Such criteria as amount and
quality of research, strength of
teaching and service to the
University were used to decide
whether Foley should be re
commended for tenure. Cur
ley "speculated" that some fa
culty members found fault with
Foley's research and teaching
because they disagreed with
Foley's Marxist philosophy.
"But there is no evidence,"
Curley said. "Nobody spoke in
those terms. It was more in
terms of research and teach
ing.
"But when one analyzes
what was said, perhaps one
could work down to more
basic issues that were bother
ing people, including the polit
ical issue.
"But this is just speculation
on my part. You just have to
guess and speculate what was
behind the answers."
Economics Prof. Walter Fal
con said that a majority of the
tenured economics professors
might have been in favor of

tenuring Foley, but the de
partment's recommendation
would be against granting te
nure.
Falcon said that departments
realize that virtual unanimity is
required by the University
Board of Trustees which ap
proves or rejects recommen
dations for tenure.
Foley was on leave during
1976-77 and taught at Columbia
University during 1977-78. He
is currently on research leave
through winter quarter.
Foley said he returned here

because his wife, Helene
Foley, an assistant professor in
the classics department, has
returned from a year's sabbati
cal. Foley said he would "pre
fer to keep a low profile" until
he resumes teaching spring
quarter.
Curley said he is happy Foley
has returned.
"Marxism is a very big sub
ject, but in his area of speciali
zation, Foley is certainly an ex
pert," Curley said. "I am very
much interested in his con
tributions."

late this quarter or early winter
quarter.
Details of the May 1976 meet
ing, in which all tenured
economics professors voted to
delay any decision on the pos
sible tenure of Foley at that
time, and hence to deny te
nure, are still not clear and pro
fessors are not in agreement
concerning them.
Foley was appointed to a
three-year term in the depart
ment in the fall of 1973. When
he was hired, he was given
"the promise of an early deci
sion on tenure," he told the
Daily on May 12,1976. That de
cision was postponed in De
cember 1975, which marked
the beginning of the second
year of Foley's assignment.
In the spring of 1976, how
ever, an economics search and
tenure committee composed
of Emeritus Prof. Tibor Sci
tovsky, Curley and Prof. David
Starrett, recommended that
Foley be granted tenure. In
April 1976, however, the
economics department again
voted to postpone a decision.
New faculty tenure decisions
are normally made during the

second year of a three-year ap
pointment.
According to Bert Hickman,
chairman of the economics
department, Foley "wasn't de
nied tenure. He was just reap
pointed for his second three
year term." Asked about Daily
articles, reporting that the
economics department had
voted to delay the decision and
hence to deny Foley tenure in
1976, Hickman said that he
"can't be responsible for what
interpretation is placed on
events by The Stanford Daily."
An estimated 85 percent of
the students enrolled in
economics courses did not at
tend class on May 19, 1976 be
cause they were upset that they
had not been allowed to par
ticipate in the tenure decision.
Such criteria as amount and
quality of research, strength of
teaching and service to the
University were used to decide
whether Foley should be re
commended for tenure. Cur
ley "speculated" that some fa
culty members found fault with
Foley's research and teaching
because they disagreed with
Foley's Marxist philosophy.
"But there is no evidence,"
Curley said. "Nobody spoke in
those terms. It was more in
terms of research and teach
ing.
"But when one analyzes
what was said, perhaps one
could work down to more
basic issues that were bother
ing people, including the polit
ical issue.
"But this is just speculation
on my part. You just have to
guess and speculate what was
behind the answers."
Economics Prof. Walter Fal
con said that a majority of the
tenured economics professors
might have been in favor of

tenuring Foley, but the de
partment's recommendation
would be against granting te
nure.
Falcon said that departments
realize that virtual unanimity is
required by the University
Board of Trustees which ap
proves or rejects recommen
dations for tenure.
Foley was on leave during
1976-77 and taught at Columbia
University during 1977-78. He
is currently on research leave
through winter quarter.
Foley said he returned here

because his wife, Helene
Foley, an assistant professor in
the classics department, has
returned from a year's sabbati
cal. Foley said he would "pre
fer to keep a low profile" until
he resumes teaching spring
quarter.
Curley said he is happy Foley
has returned.
"Marxism is a very big sub
ject, but in his area of speciali
zation, Foley is certainly an ex
pert," Curley said. "I am very
much interested in his con
tributions."
