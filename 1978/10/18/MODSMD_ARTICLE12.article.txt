# Gamma rays to unlock galaxy
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
The University is playing a
major role in the development
of the world's first gamma ray
observatory (GRO), which will
be put into orbit in 1983 under
current plans of the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA).
Specifically, the University is
responsible for the develop
ment of a telescope which will
monitor the highest-energy
gamma rays, those from 30
MEV (million electron volts) on
up to several thousand MEV.
These gamma rays are at the
farthest end of the elec
tromagnetic system, the most

energy-intense rays known to
man.
The telescope will be used to
enable scientists to make dis
coveries about our own and
other galaxies. "We're using it
to learn more about funda
mental processes in the stars,
about supernova explosions
and pulsars, and hopefully
about black holes," explained
Professor Robert Hofstadter.
A supernova is the last con
traction of a star after it has
used up its energy source. The
star collapses, giving off a big
burst of energy, increasing
10-100 million times in bright
ness, within a short period of
time.
A pulsar is a star which ro
tates, sending out rays which
intersect the earth at regular in
tervals. A black hole is a place
of extreme gravitational attrac
tion which is so great that any
thing near it — including light
— falls into it and is unable to
get out.
Hofstadter, a Nobel laureate
in physics, is one of the princi
pal investigators in the tele
scope aspect of the project. A
coinvestigator here is Dr. E.
Barrie Hughes.
Gamma rays are significant
in that they may only be seen
by going outside the atmos j
phere, because the rays are ab
sorbed by the atmosphere be
fore they can reach the earth.
They have not been readily ob
servable before the invention
of the gamma ray telescope.
Gamma rays travel in a
straight line, incapable of de
flection by gravitational or
magnetic fields in space.
Gamma rays all travel at the
speed of light, so an observer
has only to look at the direction
from which they came in order

to find their neutron star
source. This locating process
will be the primary function of
the equipment on the GRO.
Instruments
Other instruments aboard
the GRO satellite will be a
gamma ray spectrometer for
"transient events" being built
in Alabama, and three different
lower-energy gamma ray spec
trometers under construction
at the University of California
at San Diego, the Naval Re
search Laboratory, and the
Max Planck Institute in
Munich, Germany. NASA has
yet to choose an industrial
concern to build the main body
of the observatory, which will
be approximately the size of a
small car.
All the observing instru
ments will be able to be
pointed in the same direction,
and moved all around under
ground control at NASA, ac
cording Hughes.
The importance of having
telescopes capable of observ
ing the gamma rays in different
energy ranges, he said, is that
"the spectrum of emission can
be observed from all levels,"
from the lowest energy gamma
rays on up to the highest,
which the Stanford telescope
will be able to discern.
The Stanford scientists were
notified of the decision to use
their telescope in August. The
design was selected from a
number of proposed tele
scopes submitted earlier this
year for consideration by
NASA. Hofstadter said he felt
the University, in particular,
had the best energy resolution
of all the designs.
Funding
Temporary funding for the
project will come through NA

SA's Coddard Space Flight
Center, and full funding must
be approved by Congress.
Hughes explained that the
GRO project currently is one of
NASA's highest priorities and it
is very likely to receive con
gressional approval.
Only funding "at a modest
level" is necessary now to
complete the design, as con
struction will not begin for a
full year, he added.
The total weight of the satel
lite cannot exceed 14,000 lbs. If
the craft weighed more, it
would have to be launched in
more than one stage, with
connecting parts hooked up
outside the earth's atmos
phere.
Launching
Current plans call for launch
ing the observatory from the
Eastern Test Range in Florida to
an orbit of 250 to 300 miles of
altitude. Life expectancy will
be two years.
The telescope will consist
primarily of two spark cham
bers which check the direction
of the gamma ray source, and a
large sodium iodide crystal to
measurethe energy ofthe rays.
Goddard will build the spark
chamber system, Stanford
the crystal scintillation
counter. All observations will
be stored in the satellite's
memory banks and periodi
cally telemetered back to
earth.
There is much to be learned
from gamma ray astronomy,
because of the higher sensitiv
ity of the telescopes. "The
more energetic the quanta we
measure, the deeper we can
observe," explained Hofstad
ter, "and thereby we can see
the most fundamental proces
ses of nature in action."
