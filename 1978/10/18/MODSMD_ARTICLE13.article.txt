# Teen girls surveyed about sex
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” More than
half the teen-age girls using
contraceptives supplied by
birth control clinics say their
parents are aware of it, a new
study shows.
The report, released by the
New York-based Alan
Guttmacher Institute, also said
that only 11 percent of the 1442
young women surveyed in 10
states said they would stop hav
ing sex if it was required that
their parents be notified they
sought contraceptives.
The study was based on
answers to a written question
naire offered last spring to
teen-agers 17 and under at 53
family planning clinics from
New York to California.
Aida Torres, auttor of the
study and a senior research as
sociate at the institute, said she
was surprised at the number of
teen-agers who told their pa
rents they used contracep
tives.
For those who would refuse
family planning services if pa
rental knowldge were re
quired, "there's no point," she
said. "They will do whatever
they want to do and end up
having unwanted pregnancies,
which will mean more illegiti
mate births and abortions."
The number of teen-agers
using family planning services
rise from about 690,000 in 1972
to nearly 1.2 million in 1976, the
study said.
Mrs. Torres said legislators
and lobbyists who seek paren
tal notification requirements in
family planning appropriation
measures "apparently believe
that most teen-agers who use
clinically-prescribed con
traceptive devices do so with
out telling their parents. But
it's clear this is not the case."
The survey also found that
parental knowledge varied
from area to area. Parents were
more likely to know about their
daughters' use of birth control
in the Midwest and the South
where most of the survey re
sponses came from, and less
likely to know in the West and
Northeast, it said.
