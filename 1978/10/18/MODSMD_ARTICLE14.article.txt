# $8.4 million savings
## University wins tax ruling 
### LINDA HARDESTY 
Uncle Sam has taken his
hand out of the University's
pocket.
According to a ruling issued
earlier this month by the IRS
Regional Office in San Fran
cisco, income to the University
from land development and
the golf course is tax-exempt.
â€¢ The decision marks the end
of a nine-month, $8.4 million
dispute between the IRS and
University attorneys. The Uni
versity now pays no federal in
come tax, according to Micahel
Hudnall, staff counsel for bus
iness and finance.
The IRS's original claim came
as the result of a 1977 tax audit.
At that time, income
producing activities including
land development, loans of
securities, the golf course and
radio and TV sports broadcasts
were found to be "not substan
tially related to the University's
exempt purpose," and were
assessed taxes.
During the fiscal years 1973
to 1975, the IRS calculated

Stanford's federal tax liability at
more than $8.4 million. This in
cluded $6.9 million on rental
income from Stanford Indust
rial Park, Stanford Shopping
Center and other real estate;
$1 million on interest from
loans of securities such as
stocks and bonds to brokerage
houses; $450,000 from sports
broadcasting revenue, and
$125,000 from the golf course.
But earlier this year, the IRS
National Office in Washington,
D.C. ruled that income to tax
exempt universities from sec
urities loans and from sports
broadcasts were non-taxable,
leaving only the taxation of
land development and golf
course to be decided in Stan
ford's appeal at the regional
level.
The land development issue
was easily solved. IRS Regional
Analyst Adrian Player said the
Internal Revenue Code speci
fically exempts interest and
real property rental income
from being taxed as business

or trade unrelated to the Uni
versity's tax-exempt purpose.
The University's case regard
ing taxability of golfing receipts
hinged on an IRS ruling regard
ing public availability of play.
The IRS has ruled in the past
that income from general pub
lic use of sports facilities may
be taxed. But here, only fa
culty, students, staff, a limited
number of members and
guests of eligible users may
play.
Player said the course can be
considered closed to the gen
eral public and totally tax
exempt because 90 percent of
the golf course members are
alumni. Also, guests are, as a
rule, visiting the campus on
University-related matters.
"What the IRS looks at is
whether the school is compet
ing with business in general,"
Player said in a telephone in
terview last week. "As long as
there is no walk-off-the-street
golfing, the exemption will
generally be allowed."
