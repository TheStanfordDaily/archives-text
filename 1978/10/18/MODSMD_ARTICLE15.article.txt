# Younger won't save GOP this year, says reporter
## 
### HAROLD KRUGER 
The question before political
reporter Rollin Post yesterday
was "Will 1978 save the Repub
lican Party?" His answer, in a
phrase, was "wait until next
year."
"I don't think the Republican
Party will do very well in
California or nationwide. It
hasn't done well in a long time.
I worry about the Republicans.
Every time it looks like they're
building a viable party, they
manage to screw it up," Post
told the Morning Forum of Los
Altos.
Not even tonight's first tele
vised gubernatorial debate be
tween the incumbent, Gov.
jerry Brown, and his Republi
can challenger, Attorney Gen
eral Evelle Younger, will save
the party from another disastr
ous year, Post said.
"The best thing Gov. Brown
has working for him is Evelle
Younger. He's the most suc
cessful Republican politician in
the last 15 years. He's never
lost an election because he's
never been in a contest before
where he has had any competi
tion or where he has been
under any kind of scrutiny,"
Post said.
"Younger admits he's dull,
and he is. Media politics are
devastating to politicians who
are dull," Post continued.
Post should know about the
media and how they can make
or break a candidate. For 12
years he covered Sacramento
and the California political
scene for KPIX before it went to
a "happy talk" news format.
Post then switched to KQED,
where he worked on News
room and its successor, A
Closer Look.
"Media politics have elimi
nated citizen politics," Post
said. "I see nothing wrong with
a politician getting up at 5 a.m.
or 6 a.m. to greet workers at
the factory gates or meet
people in commuter trains."
But those were the tactics of
30 and 40 years ago. Now the
name of the game is television
exposure.
"Why should a politician
spend his efforts on a parade in
Palo Alto when he could spend
his money on a San Jose TV sta
tion and reach more people?"
Post asked.

Post said he is "distressed"
at the lack of local political or
ganizations, and he finds 1978
to be an "extraordinarily dis
couraging and depressing"
political year.
"We're in a state with 22 mill
ion people and we have the
most mediocre crop of politi
cians in the entire country, ex
cept for Maryland," Post said.
He attributed the problem to
having candidates "who we
don't know anything about,
but they have name recogni
tion."
California politics, probably
more than any other state, are
dominated by personalities,
according to Post. The em
phasis stems from a chronic
weakness of parties.
"The party system doesn't
exist in California. It's almost
invisible. Jimmy Carter bucked
the parties. Jerry Brown never
promoted political parties. The
Republican Party did abso

lutely zero when Ronald
Reagan was governor," he
said.
Politicians weren't the only
aspect of the '78 campaign that
bothered Post. He said ihe in
creasing reliance on ballot in
itiatives may no longer be such
an efficient method of gov
ernment.
"If you think the initiatives
you vote on are wild, you
should see the ones that don't
make it,"he said.
Two that did make it, Propos
itions 5 and 6, are troublesome
for Post. Proposition 5 would
ban smoking in certain areas.
"The idea is just swell," said
Post, a smoker, "but it's over
board because the zealots have
gotten a hold of it."
Proposition 6, which would
allow local school boards to
fire homosexual teachers, is
"one of the most vicious pieces
of garbage to come down the
pike in a long time," Post said.

board because the zealots have
gotten a hold of it."
Proposition 6, which would
allow local school boards to
fire homosexual teachers, is
"one of the most vicious pieces
of garbage to come down the
pike in a long time," Post said.
The question before political
reporter Rollin Post yesterday
was "Will 1978 save the Repub
lican Party?" His answer, in a
phrase, was "wait until next
year."
"I don't think the Republican
Party will do very well in
California or nationwide. It
hasn't done well in a long time.
I worry about the Republicans.
Every time it looks like they're
building a viable party, they
manage to screw it up," Post
told the Morning Forum of Los
Altos.
Not even tonight's first tele
vised gubernatorial debate be
tween the incumbent, Gov.
jerry Brown, and his Republi
can challenger, Attorney Gen
eral Evelle Younger, will save
the party from another disastr
ous year, Post said.
"The best thing Gov. Brown
has working for him is Evelle
Younger. He's the most suc
cessful Republican politician in
the last 15 years. He's never
lost an election because he's
never been in a contest before
where he has had any competi
tion or where he has been
under any kind of scrutiny,"
Post said.
"Younger admits he's dull,
and he is. Media politics are
devastating to politicians who
are dull," Post continued.
Post should know about the
media and how they can make
or break a candidate. For 12
years he covered Sacramento
and the California political
scene for KPIX before it went to
a "happy talk" news format.
Post then switched to KQED,
where he worked on News
room and its successor, A
Closer Look.
"Media politics have elimi
nated citizen politics," Post
said. "I see nothing wrong with
a politician getting up at 5 a.m.
or 6 a.m. to greet workers at
the factory gates or meet
people in commuter trains."
But those were the tactics of
30 and 40 years ago. Now the
name of the game is television
exposure.
"Why should a politician
spend his efforts on a parade in
Palo Alto when he could spend
his money on a San Jose TV sta
tion and reach more people?"
Post asked.

Post said he is "distressed"
at the lack of local political or
ganizations, and he finds 1978
to be an "extraordinarily dis
couraging and depressing"
political year.
"We're in a state with 22 mill
ion people and we have the
most mediocre crop of politi
cians in the entire country, ex
cept for Maryland," Post said.
He attributed the problem to
having candidates "who we
don't know anything about,
but they have name recogni
tion."
California politics, probably
more than any other state, are
dominated by personalities,
according to Post. The em
phasis stems from a chronic
weakness of parties.
"The party system doesn't
exist in California. It's almost
invisible. Jimmy Carter bucked
the parties. Jerry Brown never
promoted political parties. The
Republican Party did abso

lutely zero when Ronald
Reagan was governor," he
said.
Politicians weren't the only
aspect of the '78 campaign that
bothered Post. He said ihe in
creasing reliance on ballot in
itiatives may no longer be such
an efficient method of gov
ernment.
"If you think the initiatives
you vote on are wild, you
should see the ones that don't
make it,"he said.
Two that did make it, Propos
itions 5 and 6, are troublesome
for Post. Proposition 5 would
ban smoking in certain areas.
"The idea is just swell," said
Post, a smoker, "but it's over
board because the zealots have
gotten a hold of it."
Proposition 6, which would
allow local school boards to
fire homosexual teachers, is
"one of the most vicious pieces
