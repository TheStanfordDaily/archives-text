# HEW to give out more student aid
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” An esti
mated 1.5 million more college
students, including some from
families with incomes up to
$26,000, will qualify for federal
grants next fall, thanks to a
major college aid package pas
sed in Congress' marathon
final session.
The bill will expand the Basic
Educational Opportunities
Grant program, the cor
nerstone of the government's
current $3.8 billion grant, loan
and work-study programs for
college students.
Low-income students
An estimated 2.1 million of
the 11.6 million U.S. college
students are eligible this year
for grants ranging from $200 to
$1600, but nearly all are from
families with incomes below
$15,000. The grants average
$1000.
The new measure will raise
the top grant to $1800, provide
more generous grants to low
income students and make
eligible students from families
with incomes up to about
$26,000. The minimum would

remain $200.
The Department of Health,
Education and Welfare was un
able to give a precise break
down, but the House Educa
tion and Labor subcommittee
on post-secondary education
provided this approximate
chart:
For a family of four with one
child in college and income of
$6000, a grant of $1800; a $1676
grant with income of $8000;
$1500 at $10,000; $1329 at
$12,000; $1158 at $14,000; $991
at $16,000; $827 at $18,000; $669
at $20,000; $511 at $22,000; $359
at $24,000, and $208 at $26,000.
Guaranteed loans
The grants vary according to
a family's assets and education
costs. The subcommittee as
sumed no unusual expenses
and college costs of $3600.
The bill also gives all stu
dents, regardless of family in
come, an opportunity to get
guaranteed loans with the fed
eral government subsidizing
the interest while they remain
in college.
