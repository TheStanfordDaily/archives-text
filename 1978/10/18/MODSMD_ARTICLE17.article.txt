## Control crime, not guns 
### 
I have never owned a firearm, and probably
never will. However, I have studied the gun
control issue, and am appalled at the shallow
ness of thought and misrepresentation of the
facts which pervade David Steuer's column
(Daily, Oct. 2). We need less gun control and
more crime control! Steuer's worried about
the wrong problems. Let's worry about the
problems we can do something about, and
let's deal with them in a decisive and effective
way. Better law enforcement, courts that con
sider the victim's rights before the criminal's
rights, and stiffer penalties for people who
commit violent crimes (especially crimes
which involve the use of firearms)— that's
how we make the streets safe, not by taking
guns away from the law-abiding citizens who
want them for sport, recreation uses and for
personal defense.
Let me set the record straight with respect
to several of Steuer's statements which are
misleading to someone who is unaware of the
underlying facts:
Steuer states that "The majority of gun
deaths are inflicted by people who know their
victims personally." The truth is that the vast
majority of murders are committed by per
sons with long-established patterns of violent
criminal behavior. Two studies — by the Se
nate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency
and by the Chicago Police Department —
clearly substantiate this fact. The average
murderer — according to the Senate study of
the 120 largest metropolitan areas — had
committed six violent criminal offenses be
fore committing murder. And Chicago's 1974
analysis of 970 murders revealed that over 60
percent of the murderers had prior criminal
records, and nearly half of their victims had
prior criminal records as well.
The Senate study finding that 81 percent of
the murderers werewell known totheirvictim
is not surprising. Violent criminals compete
with other criminals, with whom they are ac
quainted. And they have fallings out with
erstwhile associates: addicts with pushers,
pimps with prostitutes, burglars with fences,
and so forth.

"Even when not used in crime, guns can yet
yield death," Steuer goes on to say. Well, the
National Safety Council ranks firearms next to
last among causes of accidental death in the
nation, and the Federal Government's Con
sumer Product Safety Commission, in rating
what it calls "hazards," ranks firearms 19th in
a list of 20. Ahead of firearms are: bicycles,
stairs, motor vehicles, food, lawn mowers,
football, baseball, playground equipment,
tables, farm equipment, glass, beds, nails and
tacks, doors, prescription drugs, chairs and
sofa, swimming pools and basketball. Yet no
one is advocating that any of those items or
activities be prohibited!
Steuer contends that "The nations of
Europe and Japan have instituted rigorous
policies of gun control, resulting in violent
crime rates which are a tiny fraction of ours."
Low crime rates in England and Japan, for in
stance, cannot, as Steuer would like us to infer,
be attributed to their gun laws. Both nations
have homogeneous, closely knit societies
with long traditions of cultural restraint on
violent crime. And, in Japan, the efficiency of
the criminal justice system is an important
factor as well. There's less crime in Japan for
the simple reason that crime doesn't pay as
well over there as it does here!
A final point that has to be brought to light is
Steuer's lack of understanding of history (for a
University history major, that's surprising!).
He says that the Second Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution speaks of the "right to keep
and bear arms" only in the context of a "na
tional militia." The perception that the Sec
ond Amendment guarantees a collective
rather than an individual right is totally inac
curate. Moreover, historical records, includ
ing Constitutional Convention debates and
the Federalist Papers, clearly indicate that the
purpose of the Second Amendment was not
to create a standing army, but to guard against
the tyranny that the framers of the Constitu
tions feared could be perpetrated by any pro
fessional armed body of government.
