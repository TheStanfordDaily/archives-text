Post office
attitude
I am writing in regard to an
incident which occurred at the
University Post Office on
Monday, Oct. 16. At seven mi
nutes before five the doors of
the post office were locked.
The remaining patrons were in
line in the building. A man
stood at one door and let
people out when their busi
ness was finished. At 5 o'clock,
according to the clock in the
post office, a woman came to
the door and wanted to be let
in. She explained to the door
man that one of the employees
at the counter had told her ear
lier to return at five because he
did not have enough money to
cash her money order. The
doorman deferred to the
employees at the counter. In a
gruff voice one of the them
said, "She was told to come at
five, not ten minutes after."
Another agreed and said she
should not be let in. The first
then said, "No special favors
for anybody. We should kick
out these people in line." The
woman was turned away and
told to return on Tuesday.
This incident is only one
example of the unpleasant at
mosphere created in the Post
Office by some of its
employees. The woman had
not acted in a way to incur the
wrath of a postal worker. It was

clearly five o'clock, unless of
course, the post office goes by
another time piece hidden
from its patrons. In addition,
those people waiting in line
had been there long before
five and did not deserve to be
insulted.
It may be excusable if this
were only an isolated occurr
ence. It was closing time and
everyone was probably tired
and fed up and wanted to go
home. But patrons are often
poorly treated during regular
hours as well. This condition
has persisted at least since I
first came to the University in
1974.
It is truly unfortunate that
members of the University
community must put up with
unfriendly and unhelpful pub
lic servants in their own home.

On Wednesday, Oct. 11, I
witnessed three events that
caused me to reflect on my re
marks reported in the Daily
(Oct. 11). At noon, a solid
stream of cyclists on Serra
Street, all on the proper side of
the street; a little later, a lone
cyclist passing through the
stone portals on Palm Drive,
slowing and sounding a bell at
the blind curve; at 4 p.m., a
musician cyclist carrying an
enormous bass over his shoul
der, riding very cautiously to

wards the Band house. These
flashes out of one day cause
me to reflect that my remark
that bicyclists as a class lacked
common sense was intemper
ate and inaccurate.
It is clear that many cyclists
follow the rules of the road,
and that several intersections
on the campus provide a daily
severe test of bicycling skills.
There are also locations where
contradictory instructions or
physical conditions exist and
which Bob Beth and the
Facilities Planning Office will
attempt to correct. Neverthe
less, a great majority of acci
dents involving bicyclists could
have been avoided by the
exercise of greater caution and
common sense.
To all of you are doing it
right, keep it up!

everyone was probably tired
and fed up and wanted to go
home. But patrons are often
poorly treated during regular
hours as well. This condition
has persisted at least since I
first came to the University in
1974.
It is truly unfortunate that
members of the University
community must put up with
unfriendly and unhelpful pub
lic servants in their own home.

Bicycle sense
On Wednesday, Oct. 11, I
witnessed three events that
caused me to reflect on my re
marks reported in the Daily
(Oct. 11). At noon, a solid
stream of cyclists on Serra
Street, all on the proper side of
the street; a little later, a lone
cyclist passing through the
stone portals on Palm Drive,
slowing and sounding a bell at
the blind curve; at 4 p.m., a
musician cyclist carrying an
enormous bass over his shoul
der, riding very cautiously to

wards the Band house. These
flashes out of one day cause
me to reflect that my remark
that bicyclists as a class lacked
common sense was intemper
ate and inaccurate.
It is clear that many cyclists
follow the rules of the road,
and that several intersections
on the campus provide a daily
severe test of bicycling skills.
There are also locations where
contradictory instructions or
physical conditions exist and
which Bob Beth and the
Facilities Planning Office will
attempt to correct. Neverthe
less, a great majority of acci
dents involving bicyclists could
have been avoided by the
exercise of greater caution and
common sense.
To all of you are doing it
right, keep it up!

I am writing in regard to an
incident which occurred at the
University Post Office on
Monday, Oct. 16. At seven mi
nutes before five the doors of
the post office were locked.
The remaining patrons were in
line in the building. A man
stood at one door and let
people out when their busi
ness was finished. At 5 o'clock,
according to the clock in the
post office, a woman came to
the door and wanted to be let
in. She explained to the door
man that one of the employees
at the counter had told her ear
lier to return at five because he
did not have enough money to
cash her money order. The
doorman deferred to the
employees at the counter. In a
gruff voice one of the them
said, "She was told to come at
five, not ten minutes after."
Another agreed and said she
should not be let in. The first
then said, "No special favors
for anybody. We should kick
out these people in line." The
woman was turned away and
told to return on Tuesday.
This incident is only one
example of the unpleasant at
mosphere created in the Post
Office by some of its
employees. The woman had
not acted in a way to incur the
wrath of a postal worker. It was

clearly five o'clock, unless of
course, the post office goes by
another time piece hidden
from its patrons. In addition,
those people waiting in line
had been there long before
five and did not deserve to be
insulted.
It may be excusable if this
were only an isolated occurr
ence. It was closing time and
everyone was probably tired
and fed up and wanted to go
home. But patrons are often
poorly treated during regular
hours as well. This condition
has persisted at least since I
first came to the University in
1974.
