# Activist fights U.S. involvement in Iran
## 
### KEVIN COX 
In 1971, Bahram Atai was an electrical engineer
ing student at the University of Washington, fight
ing the U.S. government as it helped fight a war in
Vietnam.
"I thought Vietnam was a country just like Iran,"
said Atai, explaining his anti-war activities as the
Iranian Student Association's representative in the
University of Washington's anti-war committees.
"I thought what the U.S. government was doing —
the type of involvement — was similar to what they
were doing in Iran."
In 1978, Atai abandoned his engineering studies
and career, but he is still fighting the U.S. govern
ment, which he claims is helping the Shah of Iran
repress Iranian citizens.
He is a national field secretary for the Commit
tee For Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran
(CAIFI), a group of approximately 150 people at
tempting to convince the American public to join
the protest against alleged intervention by the
U.S. government. Atai spoke at UC-Berkeley last
night and visited Stanford yesterday afternoon.
'Subversion and conspiracy'
Atai said he is lucky he is still fighting to con
vince skeptical Americans instead of being impris
oned in Iran. The U.S. Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service (INS) tried to deport Atai in 1972 for
"subversion and conspiracy" to overthrow both
the U.S. and the Iranian governments.

Thus, the forerunner of CAIFI, the Committee to
Defend Babak Zahraie, was formed in 1972 to de
fend Zahraie, his brother and Atai, from INS at
tempts to deport them. Zahraie and his brother
had the same charges leveled against them by the
INS.
The INS dropped the charges against the three
in 1973, but the committee's work was far from
complete, according to Atai. That winter, CAIFI
was formed to free Dr. Reza Barahani, a University
of Texas professor who was imprisoned in Iran
when he returned to the country for a visit.
Though Barahani, according to Atai, was incarc
erated for 103 days and tortured while in jail, he
was released.
CAIFI pressure
CAIFI is also pressuring the Iranian government
to release Dr. G.H. Sae'di, a famous Iranian playw
right. Atai said CAIFI's lobbying on behalf of im
prisoned individuals is another one of CAIFI's
functions.
Atai charged that the U.S. government partici
pated in the bloody September riots in Iran.
"In the recent bloodbath, the U.S. government
was involved," he said. "With the help of the U.S.,
the Shah is shooting people in the streets."
Atai alleged that "hundreds" of Iranian military
officers are trained in this country, and that there
are 40,000 American military advisors and officers
working in Iran.

"The Shah's a good customer," Atai said, adding
that there are "some segments in this country that
have oil and military interests in Iran."
"The U.S. shouldn't militarily intervene and
keep a regime in power that the majority had
clearly said 'no' to," Atai said, adding that there
were three to four million people in the streets
during the September riots, protesting the Shah's
government.
'Bullets, tanks and bayonets'
"But the Shah's only answer was bullets, tanks
and bayonets," said Atai. Even the government
controlled daily newspapers said the death toll
reached 4000 in Tehran alone, he added.
To combat the Shah, Atai said, CAIFI is "mobiliz
ing public opinion against political repression in
Iran."
With the help of speeches from sponsors like
Daniel Ellsberg, CAIFI is asking for Americans to
pressure their government officials to end their
alleged support of the Shah.
"That's our aim," said Atai, "to inform the whole
of the American public of the real situation in Iran.
Once they (Americans) know these things, then
they will take the correct measures."
Even in this country, Atai said he is not free from
the SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, which is al
legedly operating in this country. Atai said that
SAVAK has harrassed other Iranians who speak out
against the Shah.

to release Dr. G.H. Sae'di, a famous Iranian playw
right. Atai said CAIFI's lobbying on behalf of im
prisoned individuals is another one of CAIFI's
functions.
Atai charged that the U.S. government partici
pated in the bloody September riots in Iran.
"In the recent bloodbath, the U.S. government
was involved," he said. "With the help of the U.S.,
the Shah is shooting people in the streets."
Atai alleged that "hundreds" of Iranian military
officers are trained in this country, and that there
are 40,000 American military advisors and officers
working in Iran.

"The Shah's a good customer," Atai said, adding
that there are "some segments in this country that
have oil and military interests in Iran."
"The U.S. shouldn't militarily intervene and
keep a regime in power that the majority had
clearly said 'no' to," Atai said, adding that there
were three to four million people in the streets
during the September riots, protesting the Shah's
government.
'Bullets, tanks and bayonets'
"But the Shah's only answer was bullets, tanks
and bayonets," said Atai. Even the government
controlled daily newspapers said the death toll
reached 4000 in Tehran alone, he added.
To combat the Shah, Atai said, CAIFI is "mobiliz
ing public opinion against political repression in
Iran."
With the help of speeches from sponsors like
Daniel Ellsberg, CAIFI is asking for Americans to
pressure their government officials to end their
alleged support of the Shah.
"That's our aim," said Atai, "to inform the whole
of the American public of the real situation in Iran.
Once they (Americans) know these things, then
they will take the correct measures."
Even in this country, Atai said he is not free from
the SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, which is al
legedly operating in this country. Atai said that
SAVAK has harrassed other Iranians who speak out
against the Shah.
In 1971, Bahram Atai was an electrical engineer
ing student at the University of Washington, fight
ing the U.S. government as it helped fight a war in
Vietnam.
"I thought Vietnam was a country just like Iran,"
said Atai, explaining his anti-war activities as the
Iranian Student Association's representative in the
University of Washington's anti-war committees.
"I thought what the U.S. government was doing —
the type of involvement — was similar to what they
were doing in Iran."
In 1978, Atai abandoned his engineering studies
and career, but he is still fighting the U.S. govern
ment, which he claims is helping the Shah of Iran
repress Iranian citizens.
He is a national field secretary for the Commit
tee For Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran
(CAIFI), a group of approximately 150 people at
tempting to convince the American public to join
the protest against alleged intervention by the
U.S. government. Atai spoke at UC-Berkeley last
night and visited Stanford yesterday afternoon.
'Subversion and conspiracy'
Atai said he is lucky he is still fighting to con
vince skeptical Americans instead of being impris
oned in Iran. The U.S. Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service (INS) tried to deport Atai in 1972 for
"subversion and conspiracy" to overthrow both
the U.S. and the Iranian governments.

Thus, the forerunner of CAIFI, the Committee to
Defend Babak Zahraie, was formed in 1972 to de
fend Zahraie, his brother and Atai, from INS at
tempts to deport them. Zahraie and his brother
had the same charges leveled against them by the
INS.
The INS dropped the charges against the three
in 1973, but the committee's work was far from
complete, according to Atai. That winter, CAIFI
was formed to free Dr. Reza Barahani, a University
of Texas professor who was imprisoned in Iran
when he returned to the country for a visit.
Though Barahani, according to Atai, was incarc
erated for 103 days and tortured while in jail, he
was released.
CAIFI pressure
CAIFI is also pressuring the Iranian government
to release Dr. G.H. Sae'di, a famous Iranian playw

during the September riots, protesting the Shah's
government.
