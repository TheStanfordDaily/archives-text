## Right wing uses symbol system 
### 
It is increasingly clear that certain reac
tionary elements in the United States are
waging a sophisticated campaign of hatred
against what they perceive as threats to
their notion of the "American Way."
These right-wing groups have latched onto
several "hot buttons" that they find par
ticularly suitable for the application of
what I call the "right-wing symbol sys
tem." This symbol system is manipulated
by demagogues who, aided by corporate
advertising agencies and marketing re
search teams, stir up reaction to quell the
progressive gains made by Third World
people, women, and other oppressed
peoples. The hot buttons include the ERA,
abortion rights, affirmative action, school
desegregation, gay rights and tax reduc
tions.
The right-wing symbol system tends to
dichotomize the world into two parts:
good and evil. Thus, on one side is good,
light (read white by many people), Cod,
the family, motherhood, morality, work
ing men (and only humans of the male sex
are included), no taxes, the home, etc. On
the other hand there is evil, darkness,
feminists, communists, homosexuals,
child molesters, immorality, bureaucrats,
and the vagabonds on the public dole. The
message is clear: one is either on the good
or evil side, for there can be no com
promise.
Now, these key words are associated
with the issues that I mentioned above. A
complex is formed, one that indicates to
the average American how he or she
should feel about a particular controversy.
Thus, gay rights are associated with child
molestation, and the ERA with the destruc
tion of the family or with evil feminists.
The world becomes frighteningly simple
for those who accept the words of de
magogues, the PR people, and the emerg
ing vanguard of reaction.
Throughout the land fundamentalist
preachers and others have established or
ganizations of bigotry that meet in the
congregations' halls to learn the "word of
Cod." No accurate information is available
about the amount of money that is spent

by these groups in their "education" ef
forts. This is the case as there is a separa
tion of church and state in our society. As
long as these "churches" maintain a dis
tance from the realm of conventional
American civil politics, the IRS and the rest
of us will never know the extent of their
activities.
However, conservative caucuses and
political strategists gather the names of the
members of these grass roots organiza
tions. These computerized lists of names
are then sold or bartered by those who
lead the public to vote for "good" and
against "evil."
Let's look at an example of the use of this
symbol system on a national television

The world becomes
frighteningly simple for
those who accept the
words of demagogues, PR
people, and the emerging
vanguard of reaction.

show produced by "tax-reformer" How
ard Jarvis. Jarvis and his organization
purchased a half hour of air time situated
between the national news and the first
prime time "family" program. The cost for
such an endeavor must have been tre
mendous.
The show was designed to spread the
word about the Great American Tax Re
volt. The format was such that it looked
suspiciously like a regular network talk
show, complete with an inquisitive and
"objective" host. The individual who
played the host is a well known face to
many Americans, as he was the "father"
on the long running Brady Bunch series.
He is the perfect symbol for the all-Ameri
can upper middle-class white family.
Through the discussion between this fam

ily symbol and the interviewee Jarvis, we
are led to believe that the host is won over
to Jarvis' scheme to cut taxes and thereby
make America a better place in which to
live and raise a family. During "commer
cial breaks" in the course of the program,
Jarvis' organization encourages one and
all to join their movement to beat back the
threat of evil bureaucrats by contributing
to the American Tax Reform Movement in
amounts of $25 or $100. Note well the
symbols employed by Jarvis and his
sophisticated producers: family, bureauc
rat, good and evil.
One might contend that this popular
right-wing trend is a disjointed and there
fore harmless shift in the opinions of mass
America. However, if we scratch beneath
the surface we come up with interesting
connections between two popular right
wing campaigns. Sen. John Briggs has
used the same advertising agency to ap
peal for money to sponsor his anti-gay
Proposition Six as Howard Jarvis used to
appeal to the citizenry for funds to propel
Proposition 13 to victory. Further, Briggs
opened a recent debate with opponents of
Prop. 6 using a statement that I paraphrase
here: "We sent a message to the bureauc
rats with Proposition 13 that we wanted to
save our homes. Those politicians that said
we didn't need 13 now say we don't need
Proposition 6 to save our children. I guess
we've gotta send them another message."
The connections between the propo
nents of different right-wing attempts to
propagate a new era of fear and reaction
may not always be as clear as Briggs' op
portunistic use of the support for Proposi
tion 13; support that has been whipped up
in other media campaigns. However, what
should remain apparent is that the mes
sages of Proposition 6, Phylis Schafly, How
ard Jarvis and Anita Bryant all indicate that
a highly finances, well-organized van
guard of the reactionary elements of our
society are just beginning their manipula
tion of peopled fears and ignorance to
conduct their campaign of hatred.
