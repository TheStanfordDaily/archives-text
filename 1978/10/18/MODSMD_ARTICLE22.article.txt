## Volker funds given to Hoover Institution 
### 
Quietly last summer, with little fanfare and low
profile, and unmentioned during the fraternal em
braces between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford that
marked the opening of its latest and most lavish addi
tion, the Hoover Institution came close to tripling its
endowment.
This fiscal fact would not be so remarkable were it
not for the source of the money. It was the bequest of
William Volker, a philanthropist of Kansas City, Mo.,
who died some 30 years ago and left $10 million "to
care for the sick, aged and helpless, and relieve those
who are distressed in mind, body or estate."
On grounds almost too arcane to comprehend,
Hoover laid claim to $9 million of that money. The
University, which used to come up for one third of
Hoover's budget, had teams of lawyers in Kansas
City, the scene of some hotly contested adjudication
of the Volker estate, to help Hoover qualify as indi
gent and mentally distressed. They succeeded admir
ably, for Hoover ended up, in an out-of-court settle
ment, with $7 million of Volker's — or, rather, the
Kansas City poor people's — money.
Just what and whom these million destined for the
poorand helpless went to is worthy of some examina
tion.
Hoover is essentially an independent institution,
connected with the University chiefly through its
physical location, its budgetary arrangement and in
terlocking directorates. When its present director,
Glenn Campbell, was hired in 1960, faculty protest
over his appointment prompted a promise from then
University President Wallace Sterling to the
Academic Council (April 1,1960) that the Institution's
policies would be placed under "intensive scrutiny"
by the University. This promise has been more hon
ored in the breach than the observance. Only last
week President Richard Lyman and the Faculty Senate
greeted with extreme chill a critical report by the
Academic Council Committee on Libraries of
Hoover's library, in a no uncertain affirmation of
Hoover's autonomy — indeed, of its immunity, from
outside criticism.
Herbert Hoover's charge to the institution which
bears his name was set down in 1959: "To de
monstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether communism, socialism, economjc
materialism, or atheism — to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their conspiracies
and to reaffirm the validity of the American system."
While to most people in 1978 these words have the
ring of a pastiche, for the Hoover Institution much of
this is still the precept.

Whatever you may think of the University, from the
Hoover Tower it looks pink. Despite Campbell's dis
ingenous words, "we only look conservative because
the rest of the University is so liberal," the Institu
tion's conservatism is no optical illusion.
Its fellowship is constituted of people such as Af
ricanist Lewis Cann, who calls South Africa "a prog
ressive country"; Edward Teller, the father of the
hydrogen bomb and now a staunch advocate of the
neutron bomb; Milton Friedman, whose economic
theories have served as the lodestar of Chile's junta
and who has, more recently, been one of the most
vociferous supporters of Proposition 13.
The "left" at Hoover is exemplified by Sidney
Hook, who calls himself a socialist. This is as apt a
definition as summing up Bruce Franklin as a bomber
pilot of the Strategic Air Command — which indeed
he had also at one time been.
The Institution freely gave of her sons to the Nixon
White House and the Goldwater presidential cam-

In any case, it is probably not the kind of
educational institution Volker had in
mind when he left his money for the
poor and helpless.

paign. Fellow Martin Anderson was Ronald Reagan's
research director in his presidential efforts. Reagan
himself, whose ministrations on behalf of "the sick,
aged and helpless" are well remembered in Califor
nia, is an honorary fellow of the Hoover Institution.
Director Campbell is also a regent of the University
of California, upholding the far right on every issue.
David Packard, deputy secretary of defense during
the Vietnam War, is a member of Hoover's Board of
Overseers, as are high executives of Standard Oil and
Adolph Coors. Supreme Court Justice William Re
hnquist, who most recently voted for Bakke and
against the Daily in its police search case, is also an
Overseer.
In 1972, Hoover mounted a special event to fete the
Shah of Iran's "2500 Years of Progress," in celebration
of a regime that for sheer ruthlessness and exploita
tion has few rivals.
All in all, if one were to set out to collect a group of
people more inimical to the interests of the poor, the
powerless and the oppressed and less entitled to
their money, one would be hard put to do better.
The Hoover Tower, inviolately safe from any list to

port, houses an extraordinary collection of books and
documents on the radical and revolutionary move
ments of the world, collected over the years by fair
means and foul — such as, by open admission, theft,
a method of acquisition Hoover does not of course
encourage its own patrons to use. These splendid
research facilities and the ideological bent of its staff
and fellows would seem to make Hoover a natural for
the CIA, and some helve long suspected it of being, if
not the local branch, at least the local handmaiden to
the establishment at Langley. And this scurrilous red
paranoia was confirmed by none other than The Wall
Street Journal, which in a front-page article entitled
"Hoover Library . . , Aids CIA" (June 2,1967), stated:
"That Hoover has links with the CIA is undis
puted. . . . CIA agents browse in the cluttered halls
and rooms. It's a pretty spooky place — for a library."
Although, for purposes of collecting on the will,
Hoover described itself as an educational institution
(which, albeit, neither offers courses nor grants de
grees), in other contexts it makes no bones about its
political thrust. As fellow Thomas Moore told News
week (Jan. 12,1976) before the last presidential elec
tion, "Hoover might become the next government in
exile — surely a curious ambition for a center of
pure learning and research.
In any case, it is probably not the kind of educa
tional institution Volker had in mind when he left his
money for the poor and helpless. Wrote a former
school teacher from Kansas City: "I am 87 years old
now and don't write well because my hand trembles,
but I knew Mr. Volker well. He was a kind man who
would often come to our school. ... He loved chil
dren. . .
Somewhere in the halls of Hoover in the dead of
night, there may be some awful spooky sounds not
made by the CIA. They could be the anguished cries
of William Volker, gyrating in his grave.

Although, for purposes of collecting on the will,
Hoover described itself as an educational institution
(which, albeit, neither offers courses nor grants de

political thrust. As fellow Thomas Moore told News
week (Jan. 12,1976) before the last presidential elec

Quietly last summer, with little fanfare and low
profile, and unmentioned during the fraternal em
braces between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford that
marked the opening of its latest and most lavish addi
tion, the Hoover Institution came close to tripling its
endowment.
This fiscal fact would not be so remarkable were it
not for the source of the money. It was the bequest of
William Volker, a philanthropist of Kansas City, Mo.,
who died some 30 years ago and left $10 million "to
care for the sick, aged and helpless, and relieve those
who are distressed in mind, body or estate."
On grounds almost too arcane to comprehend,
Hoover laid claim to $9 million of that money. The
University, which used to come up for one third of
Hoover's budget, had teams of lawyers in Kansas
City, the scene of some hotly contested adjudication
of the Volker estate, to help Hoover qualify as indi
gent and mentally distressed. They succeeded admir
ably, for Hoover ended up, in an out-of-court settle
ment, with $7 million of Volker's — or, rather, the
Kansas City poor people's — money.
Just what and whom these million destined for the
poorand helpless went to is worthy of some examina
tion.
Hoover is essentially an independent institution,
connected with the University chiefly through its
physical location, its budgetary arrangement and in
terlocking directorates. When its present director,
Glenn Campbell, was hired in 1960, faculty protest
over his appointment prompted a promise from then
University President Wallace Sterling to the
Academic Council (April 1,1960) that the Institution's
policies would be placed under "intensive scrutiny"
by the University. This promise has been more hon
ored in the breach than the observance. Only last
week President Richard Lyman and the Faculty Senate
greeted with extreme chill a critical report by the
Academic Council Committee on Libraries of
Hoover's library, in a no uncertain affirmation of
Hoover's autonomy — indeed, of its immunity, from
outside criticism.
Herbert Hoover's charge to the institution which
bears his name was set down in 1959: "To de
monstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether communism, socialism, economjc
materialism, or atheism — to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their conspiracies
and to reaffirm the validity of the American system."
While to most people in 1978 these words have the
ring of a pastiche, for the Hoover Institution much of
this is still the precept.

Whatever you may think of the University, from the
Hoover Tower it looks pink. Despite Campbell's dis
ingenous words, "we only look conservative because
the rest of the University is so liberal," the Institu
tion's conservatism is no optical illusion.
Its fellowship is constituted of people such as Af
ricanist Lewis Cann, who calls South Africa "a prog
ressive country"; Edward Teller, the father of the
hydrogen bomb and now a staunch advocate of the
neutron bomb; Milton Friedman, whose economic
theories have served as the lodestar of Chile's junta
and who has, more recently, been one of the most
vociferous supporters of Proposition 13.
The "left" at Hoover is exemplified by Sidney
Hook, who calls himself a socialist. This is as apt a
definition as summing up Bruce Franklin as a bomber
pilot of the Strategic Air Command — which indeed
he had also at one time been.

of California, upholding the far right on every issue.

In 1972, Hoover mounted a special event to fete the
Shah of Iran's "2500 Years of Progress," in celebration
of a regime that for sheer ruthlessness and exploita

All in all, if one were to set out to collect a group of
people more inimical to the interests of the poor, the
powerless and the oppressed and less entitled to
their money, one would be hard put to do better.

encourage its own patrons to use. These splendid
research facilities and the ideological bent of its staff
and fellows would seem to make Hoover a natural for
the CIA, and some helve long suspected it of being, if
not the local branch, at least the local handmaiden to
the establishment at Langley. And this scurrilous red
paranoia was confirmed by none other than The Wall

In 1972, Hoover mounted a special event to fete the

of a regime that for sheer ruthlessness and exploita

All in all, if one were to set out to collect a group of
people more inimical to the interests of the poor, the
powerless and the oppressed and less entitled to
their money, one would be hard put to do better.
The Hoover Tower, inviolately safe from any list to

port, houses an extraordinary collection of books and
documents on the radical and revolutionary move
ments of the world, collected over the years by fair
means and foul — such as, by open admission, theft,
a method of acquisition Hoover does not of course
encourage its own patrons to use. These splendid
research facilities and the ideological bent of its staff
and fellows would seem to make Hoover a natural for
the CIA, and some helve long suspected it of being, if
not the local branch, at least the local handmaiden to
the establishment at Langley. And this scurrilous red
paranoia was confirmed by none other than The Wall
Street Journal, which in a front-page article entitled
"Hoover Library . . , Aids CIA" (June 2,1967), stated:
"That Hoover has links with the CIA is undis
puted. . . . CIA agents browse in the cluttered halls
and rooms. It's a pretty spooky place — for a library."
Although, for purposes of collecting on the will,
Hoover described itself as an educational institution
(which, albeit, neither offers courses nor grants de
grees), in other contexts it makes no bones about its
political thrust. As fellow Thomas Moore told News
week (Jan. 12,1976) before the last presidential elec
tion, "Hoover might become the next government in
exile — surely a curious ambition for a center of
pure learning and research.
In any case, it is probably not the kind of educa
tional institution Volker had in mind when he left his
money for the poor and helpless. Wrote a former
school teacher from Kansas City: "I am 87 years old
now and don't write well because my hand trembles,
but I knew Mr. Volker well. He was a kind man who
would often come to our school. ... He loved chil
dren. . .
Somewhere in the halls of Hoover in the dead of

of William Volker, gyrating in his grave.

Quietly last summer, with little fanfare and low
profile, and unmentioned during the fraternal em
braces between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford that
marked the opening of its latest and most lavish addi
tion, the Hoover Institution came close to tripling its
endowment.
This fiscal fact would not be so remarkable were it
not for the source of the money. It was the bequest of
William Volker, a philanthropist of Kansas City, Mo.,
who died some 30 years ago and left $10 million "to
care for the sick, aged and helpless, and relieve those
who are distressed in mind, body or estate."
On grounds almost too arcane to comprehend,
Hoover laid claim to $9 million of that money. The
University, which used to come up for one third of
Hoover's budget, had teams of lawyers in Kansas
City, the scene of some hotly contested adjudication
of the Volker estate, to help Hoover qualify as indi
gent and mentally distressed. They succeeded admir
ably, for Hoover ended up, in an out-of-court settle
ment, with $7 million of Volker's — or, rather, the
Kansas City poor people's — money.
Just what and whom these million destined for the
poorand helpless went to is worthy of some examina
tion.
Hoover is essentially an independent institution,
connected with the University chiefly through its
physical location, its budgetary arrangement and in
terlocking directorates. When its present director,
Glenn Campbell, was hired in 1960, faculty protest
over his appointment prompted a promise from then
University President Wallace Sterling to the
Academic Council (April 1,1960) that the Institution's
policies would be placed under "intensive scrutiny"
by the University. This promise has been more hon
ored in the breach than the observance. Only last
week President Richard Lyman and the Faculty Senate
greeted with extreme chill a critical report by the
Academic Council Committee on Libraries of
Hoover's library, in a no uncertain affirmation of
Hoover's autonomy — indeed, of its immunity, from
outside criticism.
Herbert Hoover's charge to the institution which
bears his name was set down in 1959: "To de
monstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether communism, socialism, economjc
materialism, or atheism — to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their conspiracies
and to reaffirm the validity of the American system."
While to most people in 1978 these words have the
ring of a pastiche, for the Hoover Institution much of
this is still the precept.

Whatever you may think of the University, from the
Hoover Tower it looks pink. Despite Campbell's dis
ingenous words, "we only look conservative because
the rest of the University is so liberal," the Institu
tion's conservatism is no optical illusion.
Its fellowship is constituted of people such as Af
ricanist Lewis Cann, who calls South Africa "a prog
ressive country"; Edward Teller, the father of the
hydrogen bomb and now a staunch advocate of the
neutron bomb; Milton Friedman, whose economic
theories have served as the lodestar of Chile's junta
and who has, more recently, been one of the most
vociferous supporters of Proposition 13.
The "left" at Hoover is exemplified by Sidney
Hook, who calls himself a socialist. This is as apt a
definition as summing up Bruce Franklin as a bomber
pilot of the Strategic Air Command — which indeed
he had also at one time been.
