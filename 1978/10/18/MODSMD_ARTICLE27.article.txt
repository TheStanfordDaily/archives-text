# Rafalovich nets 2 goals
## Booters fell Lumberjacks

Soccer's version of the "Big
Red Machine" continued to
roll over its opponents, this
time at the expense of host
Humboldt State, 4-1.
The Cardinals' seventh
straight win brings their season
total to 11-1, while they have a
2-1 record in the Pacific Soccer
Conference.
Although the victories them
selves are obviously important
for conference standings, rat
ings and consideration for
post-season play, the statistics
compiled in the course of the
wins are equally impressive.
Stanford has outscored its
opponents by a 43 to 16 mar
gin, and in scoring by halves,
the Cards lead their competi
tion 14 to 11 in the first period
and an amazing 29 to 5 in the
second period of play.
As for the actual scoring, Ted
Rafalovich and Dan McNevin
predictably lead the team.
Rafalovich has totaled 15 goals
and 11 assists, which is "amaz
ing for a 19-year-old
freshman," according to Stan
ford coach Nelson Lodge.
McNevin has accounted for 11
goals and seven assists.
"Sure, Rafalovich and
McNevin score goals but the
balls have got to come from
some place," Lodge said. "All
we're doing is playing to our
strengths. It's just too bad that
strikers get all the recognition
because everybody contri
butes to the goal, its not just
Rafalovich. If you don't have 10
other players on the field, he

doesn't do it himself."
In Monday's match, in fact,
the first goal was scored by
fullback Greg Delgado seven
minutes into the match. He
now has five goals and one as
sist to his credit. Less than
three minutes later, McNevin
passed to Rafalovich, who put
in the Cards' second tally.
The Lumberjacks broke
through for their only goal
about halfway through the first
period, making it 2-1 at
halftime. Rafalovich, again
with a McNevin assist, in
creased Stanford's lead to 3-1
with 17 minutes left. The pair
also teamed up for the final
tally, this one on McNevin's
kick.
"Greg scored an unbelieva
ble goal," Lodge said. "The

best goal of the game was De-
Igado's, but the best play of the
game was the McNevin-
Rafalovich first goal. Danny
just threaded a perfect pass
and Rafalovich stopped it and
leaned one way, pulling the
keeper and very deftly put it in
the right-hand corner — one of
the prettiest I've seen."
The Cards found a familiar
problem in Areata — a com
paratively lackluster first
period. Rather than stemming
from team shortcomings, the
trouble arose from the narrow
playing surface, according to
Lodge.
"I think the first half (play)
was due to the field — it's only
60 yards wide, ours is 75,"
Lodge said. "It was short,

which means that they could
counterattack and attack with
the long ball. Defensively, a
poor team can defend well on a
narrow field because there's
just not that much space to re
ally move the ball."
Defensively, the Cards shut
down the Humboldt scoring at
tack. "They had one excellent
player who Greg Delgado
had to contain and he did an
excellent job," Lodge said.
"He was our mainstay in that
game. They could've scored
more because he was really a
constant threat but I think Greg
was the outstanding player in
this case."
Stanford plays Santa Clara
today at 2 p.m. on Harry
Maloney Field.
