## Stanford scotchers host Davis in crucial conference match 
### JULIE HILL 
A confident Stanford hockey
team intends to move toward a
winning season as it travels to
UC-Davis this morning for a 1
p.m. match.
Davis, 2-2 in the league with
out having faced stiff competi
tion, tied Stanford last year on
the Aggies' home field. Coach
Barbara Longstreth pegged
Stanford's concentration
throughout the game as the
key determinant of the out
come. "If we can concen

trate," she said, "we'll be suc
cessful. And we have to beat
them."
Longstreth responded
cautiously to questions about
the direction of recent prac
tices. "Preparation for the up
coming games has been excel
lent," Longstreth said. "We're
working on our offensive tac
tics so that the system we're
now using, which is different
from earlier this year, will
work."
Longstreth has been giving

the team functional training â€”
isolating each player's posi
tion.
"This aspect is really helping
the players understand their
role in the entire game," she
said. "They feel well-prepared
as a result.
"We're not taking Davis
lightly," Longstreth said.
"Stanford knows it needs to
execute its game plan to win."
The j.V. hockey team follows
the varsity with a game at 2:30
p.m.
