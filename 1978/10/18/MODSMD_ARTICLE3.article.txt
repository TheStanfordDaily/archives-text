# Fewer cases reported at Cowell
## Drug abuse declining 
### CARLA NEASEL 
Fewer cases of drug abuse have
been reported at Cowell Student
Health Center this year than in
previous years, according to Dr.
Vincent D'Andrea.
D'Andrea, who practices at
Huston House, a counseling facil
ity here, said that one of the main
reasons for the declining number
of drug abuse cases is that stu
dents prefer to seek the aid of a
friend, rather than reporting to
Cowell. These friends often know
as much as a doctor would about
"freaking-out" and what should
be done to help, he added.
Another reason is that people
now are more sophisticated about
their drug habits, D'Andrea said.
"Drug use is much more elabo
rate," said D'Andrea. "People ex
periment with drug combinations
like they would mixed drinks.
Everyone's a connoisseur."
For the past six years, the drug
most often abused on campus has
been marijuana, according to
D'Andrea. However, recently al
cohol has been overtaking
marijuana both in popularity and
frequency of use, he said.
"The increase in alcohol abuse
tends to mask the problems which
exist with cocaine and pot,"

D'Andrea explained.
Dr. John Dorman, who prac
tices at Cowell, said that "over the
course of the last couple years,
there hasn't been much trouble at
all" with drug abuse here.
Several years ago, Dorman did a
study on the drug situation here
and the number of people who
had been admitted to Cowell for
treatment.
In the study, Dorman said he
differentiated between non
serious and serious cases of drug
abuse, labeling as serious only
those cases in which patients
stayed overnight for treatment.
Records were kept of the serious
cases.
From 1968 to 1970, there were 32
students admitted overnight, 42
different times. During the sec
ond time period, from 1973 to
1975, only 26 admissions were
made for 25 students.
The difference between the two
time blocks studied are not great,
but there are some notable var
iances, Dorman said.
The most significant factor, ac
cording to Dorman, is that none
of the cases in the later time
period were admitted as a result
of abusing a "hard" drug, while

Huston House, located at 575 Salvatierra St., is probably best-known for
being part of Cowell's counseling and psychological services. But it also
offers personal and vocational testing by psychometrists and marital coun
seling for students. The hours at Huston are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday
through Friday, and students can call 497-3932 to make appointments.
several cases in the earlier time
period involved barbiturates and
acid.
Dorman said the number of
marijuana cases did not change.
"Before, the people who came
in were the really sick ones, the
ones who got a hold of bad goods
or who took too much. The
people who come in now are the
more sheltered ones. They're
usually scared because it's their
first time, and they're worried
about a rapid heart beat or some
thing."
Dorman's study also showed
the difference in the types of
drugs on which people most fre
quently "overdosed."
"The ODs used to almost al
ways be on barbiturates. Now it's
valium."
There have been no PCP or
"angel dust" admissions during
the past five years, and Dorman
said he feels PCP is mostly a prob

lem "with younger kids" and that
people who got into that have
usually "outgrown it" by college
age.
Although the drug abuse situa
tion here is not ideal, Stanford has
fewer reported problems of abuse
than many other colleges, accord
ing to D'Andrea.
Both doctors said patients ad
mitted to Cowell for drug abuse
are not turned over to the au
thorities.
"The only time anyone is
notified of a patient's admission is
if he's in serious medical trouble.
In that case, the physician will
usually consider calling the fam
ily," said D'Andrea.
Counseling is available to all
students either through the
Bridge or Huston House,

counseling services.

D'Andrea explained.
Dr. John Dorman, who prac
tices at Cowell, said that "over the
course of the last couple years,
there hasn't been much trouble at
all" with drug abuse here.
Several years ago, Dorman did a
study on the drug situation here
and the number of people who
had been admitted to Cowell for
treatment.
In the study, Dorman said he
differentiated between non
serious and serious cases of drug
abuse, labeling as serious only
those cases in which patients
stayed overnight for treatment.
Records were kept of the serious
cases.
From 1968 to 1970, there were 32
students admitted overnight, 42
different times. During the sec
ond time period, from 1973 to
1975, only 26 admissions were
made for 25 students.
The difference between the two
time blocks studied are not great,
but there are some notable var
iances, Dorman said.
The most significant factor, ac
cording to Dorman, is that none
of the cases in the later time
period were admitted as a result
of abusing a "hard" drug, while

several cases in the earlier time
period involved barbiturates and
acid.
Dorman said the number of
marijuana cases did not change.
"Before, the people who came
in were the really sick ones, the
ones who got a hold of bad goods
or who took too much. The
people who come in now are the
more sheltered ones. They're
usually scared because it's their
first time, and they're worried
about a rapid heart beat or some
thing."
Dorman's study also showed
the difference in the types of
drugs on which people most fre
quently "overdosed."
"The ODs used to almost al
ways be on barbiturates. Now it's
valium."
There have been no PCP or
"angel dust" admissions during
the past five years, and Dorman
said he feels PCP is mostly a prob

lem "with younger kids" and that
people who got into that have
usually "outgrown it" by college
age.
Although the drug abuse situa
tion here is not ideal, Stanford has
fewer reported problems of abuse
than many other colleges, accord
ing to D'Andrea.
Both doctors said patients ad
mitted to Cowell for drug abuse
are not turned over to the au
thorities.
"The only time anyone is

if he's in serious medical trouble.
In that case, the physician will

D'Andrea said. Huston House is

Fewer cases of drug abuse have
been reported at Cowell Student
Health Center this year than in
previous years, according to Dr.
Vincent D'Andrea.
D'Andrea, who practices at
Huston House, a counseling facil
ity here, said that one of the main
reasons for the declining number
of drug abuse cases is that stu
dents prefer to seek the aid of a
friend, rather than reporting to
Cowell. These friends often know
as much as a doctor would about
"freaking-out" and what should
be done to help, he added.
Another reason is that people
now are more sophisticated about
their drug habits, D'Andrea said.
"Drug use is much more elabo
rate," said D'Andrea. "People ex
periment with drug combinations
like they would mixed drinks.
Everyone's a connoisseur."
For the past six years, the drug
most often abused on campus has
been marijuana, according to
D'Andrea. However, recently al
cohol has been overtaking
marijuana both in popularity and
frequency of use, he said.
