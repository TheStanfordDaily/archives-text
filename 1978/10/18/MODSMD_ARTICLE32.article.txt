# Card gridders: hardly a team of no names
## 
### PETER FROST 
Members of the Stanford foot
ball team play under a variety of
labels. To the Athletic Depart
ment and the media, they are the
renowned Cardinals. To the in
comparable LSJUMB, they are the
Trees. To many of the players
themselves, the Griffins. To
stodgy alumni, the Indians.
It is only appropriate that on a
team which competes with so
many nicknames, that a multitude

of players also assume colorful
monickers.
Fans like nicknames because
they make the players more per
sonal, and football is a sport
which lends itself to these labels.
The Juice, Crazy Legs, The Four
Horsemen, The Gipper, Too Tall
. . . the list seems endless. And
certainly the Stanford team is no
exception. Nicknames abound on
the Farm, and with discretion the
Daily publishes a select few here:
Robby "Magilla Gorilla" Chap
man — Friends claim that at a great
distance he resembles "Magilla
Gorilla" of cartoon fame, but
once in the immediate vicinity of
the 6-foot-1, 195-pound Chap
man, the nickname does not sur
face quite as often.
Phil "Face" Francis— Francis at
tained this nickname through his
unusual skill in consuming al
coholic beverages. At a party
once, he and his friends began
downing flaming mixed drinks to
display their drinking ability.
While guzzling, Francis' unique
coordination surfaced as he man
aged to spill his drink upwards

onto his face where it remained
and continued to burn fora length
of time.
Brad "Boomer" Fox — Fox is the
Cardinal's punter. Ironic
nickname, isn't it?
Ken "Buffy" Margerum — The
T.V. show Family Affair brought
pain and depression to millions of
viewers during its tenure on the
tube, just as Buffy look-alike
Margerum is doing now to defen

sive secondaries throughout the
Pac-10.
Darrin "Waterhead" Nelson —
Surprised to see the nickname
"Waterhead" instead of the
commonplace "Junior" preced
ing Nelson's surname? Undoub
tedly. According to Nelson's close
acquaintances, "Waterhead" is in
reference to the shape of his
forehead with regards to his hair
cut. Alumnus may not use the

nickname often, but from now
until the end of the 1980 season
supportive screams of
"Waterhead!, Waterhead!" may
come from the cheering throng
each time Nelson moves grace
fully across the goal line.
Fred "Body" Burch — Players in
sist that Burch has absolutely no
shape whatsoever in his entire
body, hence the nickname. One
wonders what they are doing star
ing at Burch's body in the first
place.
Dan "Pink" Floyd — Even
though it seems natural that Floyd
would be nicknamed "Pink" after
the famous and talented (?) rock
group, friends claim that his skin
really does become a vivid pink
each time he exerts himself on the
field.
Chuck "Human Hemorrhoid"
Evans — No one is sure of the ori
gin of this one, but it may be that
the 6-foot-4, 240-pound defensive
lineman is a pain in the ass to
everyone on the opposing of
fense.
In closing, the list seems end

less: Kevin "Master" Bates, Marty
"Tito" Fuentes, Billy "Baco" An
derson, George "Stretch
Armstrong" Norris and Charles
"Burlon Scruggs" Bedford.
Whether "Human Hemor
rhoid," "Tito" and "Magilla
Gorilla" can stop the Throwin'
Samoan or not Saturday, Stanford
will come out way ahead in the
name game.

nickname, isn't it?
Ken "Buffy" Margerum — The
T.V. show Family Affair brought
pain and depression to millions of
viewers during its tenure on the
tube, just as Buffy look-alike
Margerum is doing now to defen

sive secondaries throughout the
Pac-10.
Darrin "Waterhead" Nelson —
Surprised to see the nickname
"Waterhead" instead of the
commonplace "Junior" preced
ing Nelson's surname? Undoub
tedly. According to Nelson's close
acquaintances, "Waterhead" is in
reference to the shape of his
forehead with regards to his hair
cut. Alumnus may not use the

nickname often, but from now
until the end of the 1980 season
supportive screams of
"Waterhead!, Waterhead!" may
come from the cheering throng
each time Nelson moves grace
fully across the goal line.
Fred "Body" Burch — Players in
sist that Burch has absolutely no
shape whatsoever in his entire
body, hence the nickname. One
wonders what they are doing star
ing at Burch's body in the first
place.
Dan "Pink" Floyd — Even
though it seems natural that Floyd
would be nicknamed "Pink" after
the famous and talented (?) rock
group, friends claim that his skin
really does become a vivid pink
each time he exerts himself on the
field.
Chuck "Human Hemorrhoid"
Evans — No one is sure of the ori
gin of this one, but it may be that
the 6-foot-4, 240-pound defensive
lineman is a pain in the ass to
everyone on the opposing of
fense.
In closing, the list seems end

less: Kevin "Master" Bates, Marty
"Tito" Fuentes, Billy "Baco" An
derson, George "Stretch
Armstrong" Norris and Charles
"Burlon Scruggs" Bedford.
Whether "Human Hemor
rhoid," "Tito" and "Magilla
Gorilla" can stop the Throwin'
Samoan or not Saturday, Stanford
will come out way ahead in the
name game.

Members of the Stanford foot
ball team play under a variety of
labels. To the Athletic Depart
ment and the media, they are the
renowned Cardinals. To the in
comparable LSJUMB, they are the
Trees. To many of the players
themselves, the Griffins. To
stodgy alumni, the Indians.
It is only appropriate that on a
team which competes with so
many nicknames, that a multitude

of players also assume colorful
monickers.
Fans like nicknames because
they make the players more per
sonal, and football is a sport
which lends itself to these labels.
The Juice, Crazy Legs, The Four
Horsemen, The Gipper, Too Tall
. . . the list seems endless. And
certainly the Stanford team is no
exception. Nicknames abound on
the Farm, and with discretion the
Daily publishes a select few here:
Robby "Magilla Gorilla" Chap
man — Friends claim that at a great
distance he resembles "Magilla
Gorilla" of cartoon fame, but
once in the immediate vicinity of
the 6-foot-1, 195-pound Chap
man, the nickname does not sur
face quite as often.
Phil "Face" Francis— Francis at
tained this nickname through his
unusual skill in consuming al
coholic beverages. At a party
once, he and his friends began
downing flaming mixed drinks to
display their drinking ability.
While guzzling, Francis' unique
coordination surfaced as he man
aged to spill his drink upwards

onto his face where it remained
and continued to burn fora length
of time.
Brad "Boomer" Fox — Fox is the
Cardinal's punter. Ironic
nickname, isn't it?
Ken "Buffy" Margerum — The
T.V. show Family Affair brought
pain and depression to millions of
viewers during its tenure on the
