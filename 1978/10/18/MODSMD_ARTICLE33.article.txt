Carter intervenes in peace talks
Washington — President Jimmy Carter stepped per
sonally into the Middle East peace talks yesterday, meet
ing separately at the White House with the heads of the
Israeli and Egyptian delegations.
Administration officials denied that Carter intervened
in an effort to overcome an impasse in the talks, al
though the pattern of separate meetingswas the sameas
the president used at Camp David to try to bridge impas
ses there.
"There is no particular hurdle. The president will re
view the status of the talks, the progress that has been
made, and the differences that remain," said George
Sherman, a State Department press officer who has
been acting as official spokesman for all three countries
during the talks that began here last Thursday.
Sherman refused to discuss the nature of the issues
that remain unresolved, but he hinted at what they
might be when he refused to say whether progress has
been made on what he has called the "side talks" at Blair
House.
The so-called "side talks" involve the sensitive and
intractable issues of the West Bank, including
Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians who live
there. American officials have always regarded those
issues as more difficult to solve than the issues strictly
between Israel and Egypt, most of which were resolved
at Camp David.
Americans win Nobel in physics
Stockholm, Sweden — Two Americans whose work
with microwave radiation supported the "big bang"
theory of the creation of the universe shared the Nobel
Prize in physics yesterday with a Russian scientist. The
prize for chemistry went to a Briton.
Dr. Arno A. Penzias, 45, and Dr. Robert W. Wilson, 42,
both of the Bell Telephone Laboratories of New Jersey,
shared the $165,000 physics prize with Professor Pyotr
Leontevitch Kapitsa of Moscow. Kapitsa, 84, was hon
ored for his work in low-temperature physics.
The chemistry prize, also $165,000, went to Professor
Peter Mitchell, 58, for his work in bioenergetics, which
concerns the chemical process responsible for the
energy supply in living cells.
Sixof the nine men named to receive or share in Nobel
prizes this year are Americans. Americans shared with
other nationalities in physics and medicine, and won
outright in literature and economics. The Nobel Peace
Prize has not yet been announced.
Alcohol report reveals problems
Washington — An estimated 10 million Americans are
problem drinkers or alcoholics, and drinking may be to

blame for as many as 205,000 deaths a year, federal
health officials reported yesterday.
The risk of death from disease, accident or violence is
two to six times greater for the problem drinker than for
the population at large, the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism said in its third special report to
Congress.
Alcohol may be involved in up to one-third of all
suicides, half of all murders, half of all traffic deaths and
a fourth of all other accidental deaths, the report said.
In addition to the 10 million adult problem drinkers, or
7 percent of all adults, an estimated 3.3 million youths
ages 14 to 17 have drinking problems ranging from trou
ble at school to car accidents often caused by weekend
binges.
New soft drink stirs controversy
Richmond, Va. — The beer manufacturer calls its new
product a "not-so-soft drink" but a nurses' group wants
it boycotted, saying it could help soda-sipping children
grow into beer-guzzling adults.
An amber blend of lemon, ginger and apple flavoring
in a malt-flavored base, "Chelsea" is being test
marketed by Anheuser-Busch in six markets, including
Richmond and Staunton, Va.
Its trouble, from the point of view of the 3000-member
Virginia Nurses Association, is that it contains about
one-half of 1 percent alcohol and is packaged to look like
premium beer.
What's more, says Barbara Bolton, executive director
of the association, "it forms with a head on it, exactly like
a beer."
"The irony is that this soft drink is more pure than
many others. It's totally natural, has no caffein, less
sugar and, in that way, is probably the least harmful on
the market today," company spokesman Joe Finnigan
said in St. Louis.
Wall Street down amid worries
New York — The stock market sold off sharply for the
second straight session yesterday under the pressure of
interest-rate worries and concern over the dollar's prob
lems.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen 21.92 Monday for its sharpest drop in nearly four
years, lost another 8.83 to 866.34.
Today's weather
Fair through today except patchy fog night and morn
ing. Increasing high cloudiness tonight and tomorrow.
Slightly warmer today. Lows in the 50s. Highs in the
upper 60s to low 70s. Light winds.

grow into beer-guzzling adults.
An amber blend of lemon, ginger and apple flavoring
in a malt-flavored base, "Chelsea" is being test
marketed by Anheuser-Busch in six markets, including
Richmond and Staunton, Va.
Its trouble, from the point of view of the 3000-member
Virginia Nurses Association, is that it contains about
one-half of 1 percent alcohol and is packaged to look like
premium beer.
What's more, says Barbara Bolton, executive director
of the association, "it forms with a head on it, exactly like
a beer."
"The irony is that this soft drink is more pure than
many others. It's totally natural, has no caffein, less
sugar and, in that way, is probably the least harmful on
the market today," company spokesman Joe Finnigan
said in St. Louis.
Wall Street down amid worries
New York — The stock market sold off sharply for the
second straight session yesterday under the pressure of
interest-rate worries and concern over the dollar's prob
lems.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen 21.92 Monday for its sharpest drop in nearly four
years, lost another 8.83 to 866.34.

Carter intervenes in peace talks
Washington — President Jimmy Carter stepped per
sonally into the Middle East peace talks yesterday, meet
ing separately at the White House with the heads of the
Israeli and Egyptian delegations.
Administration officials denied that Carter intervened
in an effort to overcome an impasse in the talks, al
though the pattern of separate meetingswas the sameas
the president used at Camp David to try to bridge impas
ses there.
"There is no particular hurdle. The president will re
view the status of the talks, the progress that has been
made, and the differences that remain," said George
Sherman, a State Department press officer who has
been acting as official spokesman for all three countries
during the talks that began here last Thursday.
Sherman refused to discuss the nature of the issues
that remain unresolved, but he hinted at what they
might be when he refused to say whether progress has
been made on what he has called the "side talks" at Blair
House.
The so-called "side talks" involve the sensitive and
intractable issues of the West Bank, including
Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians who live
there. American officials have always regarded those
issues as more difficult to solve than the issues strictly
between Israel and Egypt, most of which were resolved
at Camp David.
Americans win Nobel in physics
Stockholm, Sweden — Two Americans whose work
with microwave radiation supported the "big bang"
theory of the creation of the universe shared the Nobel
Prize in physics yesterday with a Russian scientist. The
prize for chemistry went to a Briton.
Dr. Arno A. Penzias, 45, and Dr. Robert W. Wilson, 42,
both of the Bell Telephone Laboratories of New Jersey,
shared the $165,000 physics prize with Professor Pyotr
Leontevitch Kapitsa of Moscow. Kapitsa, 84, was hon
ored for his work in low-temperature physics.
The chemistry prize, also $165,000, went to Professor
Peter Mitchell, 58, for his work in bioenergetics, which
concerns the chemical process responsible for the
energy supply in living cells.
Sixof the nine men named to receive or share in Nobel
prizes this year are Americans. Americans shared with
other nationalities in physics and medicine, and won
outright in literature and economics. The Nobel Peace
Prize has not yet been announced.
Alcohol report reveals problems
Washington — An estimated 10 million Americans are
problem drinkers or alcoholics, and drinking may be to

blame for as many as 205,000 deaths a year, federal
health officials reported yesterday.
The risk of death from disease, accident or violence is
two to six times greater for the problem drinker than for
the population at large, the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism said in its third special report to
Congress.
Alcohol may be involved in up to one-third of all
suicides, half of all murders, half of all traffic deaths and
a fourth of all other accidental deaths, the report said.
In addition to the 10 million adult problem drinkers, or
7 percent of all adults, an estimated 3.3 million youths
ages 14 to 17 have drinking problems ranging from trou
ble at school to car accidents often caused by weekend
binges.

Alcohol report reveals problems
Washington — An estimated 10 million Americans are
problem drinkers or alcoholics, and drinking may be to

blame for as many as 205,000 deaths a year, federal
health officials reported yesterday.
The risk of death from disease, accident or violence is
two to six times greater for the problem drinker than for
the population at large, the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism said in its third special report to
Congress.
Alcohol may be involved in up to one-third of all
suicides, half of all murders, half of all traffic deaths and
a fourth of all other accidental deaths, the report said.
In addition to the 10 million adult problem drinkers, or
7 percent of all adults, an estimated 3.3 million youths
ages 14 to 17 have drinking problems ranging from trou
ble at school to car accidents often caused by weekend
binges.
New soft drink stirs controversy
Richmond, Va. — The beer manufacturer calls its new
product a "not-so-soft drink" but a nurses' group wants
it boycotted, saying it could help soda-sipping children
grow into beer-guzzling adults.
An amber blend of lemon, ginger and apple flavoring
in a malt-flavored base, "Chelsea" is being test
marketed by Anheuser-Busch in six markets, including
Richmond and Staunton, Va.
Its trouble, from the point of view of the 3000-member
Virginia Nurses Association, is that it contains about
one-half of 1 percent alcohol and is packaged to look like
premium beer.
What's more, says Barbara Bolton, executive director
of the association, "it forms with a head on it, exactly like
a beer."
"The irony is that this soft drink is more pure than
many others. It's totally natural, has no caffein, less
sugar and, in that way, is probably the least harmful on
the market today," company spokesman Joe Finnigan
said in St. Louis.
Wall Street down amid worries
New York — The stock market sold off sharply for the
second straight session yesterday under the pressure of
interest-rate worries and concern over the dollar's prob
lems.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen 21.92 Monday for its sharpest drop in nearly four
years, lost another 8.83 to 866.34.
Today's weather
Fair through today except patchy fog night and morn
ing. Increasing high cloudiness tonight and tomorrow.
Slightly warmer today. Lows in the 50s. Highs in the
upper 60s to low 70s. Light winds.
