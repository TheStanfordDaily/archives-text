# Lyman talks to Larkin frosh
## 
### EDWIN CERVANTES 
President Richard Lyman discus
sed Medical School admission pol
icy, the Chinese exchange program
and the new football stadium
policies at an informal question
and-answer session held at Larkin
house last night.
The event was recorded by KZSU
and will be broadcast on Campus
Conference tomorrow.
Lyman began by clarifying the new

Med School admission policy in re
sponse to newspaper articles which
Lyman said were misleading.
"The Stanford Medical School Se
nate . . . was redesigning a program
aimed at doing as well in affirmative
action terms as any program they had
done before, but doing so with a
view to conforming to the guidelines
implied by the Bakke decision earlier
this summer from the United States
Supreme Court."
Single admissions committee
Lyman said the program included
"the abolition of a separate admis
sions committee for minority candi
dates and the expansion of the now
single admissions committee so that
it could do a better job ... in taking
into account minority status in the
admission process."
The Bakke decision declared the
use of racial quotas in admission
guidelines unconstitutional.
Lyman expressed concern that na
tional press coverage of the policy
change implied that the University
"abandoned its efforts to recruit and
enroll minority students."
On the contrary, Lyman said, the

new policy would compare each
applicant to the entire body of
applicants while "affirming its com
mitment to enrolling significant
numbers" of minority students.
Lyman said he expects the new pol
icy to bring in as many minority stu
dents as the old policy has in past
years.
Exchange program
Campus Conference host Doug
Michaels asked the president about
the exchange program of scholars
between the People's Republic of
China and the University which will
take place later this month.
According to Lyman, the Chinese
exchange party will consist of six
people with the American equivalent
of post-doctorates in the scientific
and technical fields.
The University delegation has yet
to be chosen, but Lyman predicted
that "it will be difficult to pick and
choose" because the number
selected will be small compared to
the number of people interested.
It has not yet been determined
whether students will participate in
the exchange.
Lyman also discussed the prob
lems that the Commission on the
Humanities, of which he was re
cently appointed chairman, will
examine.
One problem "is the fact that we
are in some danger of losing a whole
generation of scholars in the
humanities because they cannot find
employment related to their train
ing."
Also, judging from enrollment fi
gures, there is an apparent lack of
interest among undergraduates in
getting a humanities education.
"Too often humanities are taught
as a pre-professional subject,"
Lyman commented.
The commission will report its
findings in a public document which
will reach government, university
and academic circles.

One student asked whether the
athletic department prohibition of
bottles and cans in the Stanford
stadium will continue. He said that
because of the restriction, various
student groups are making more of
an effort to smuggle in alcoholic be
verages.
Lyman replied that the prohibition
was a result of the Pac-10 concern
that bottles and cans can be "poten
tial missiles."
"The policy is not likely to be
abandoned; it might be modified in
the light of experience," he added.
On the lighter side, a freshman
told Lyman that during Field Day she
found a frisbee on which was writ
ten, "Good forone dinnerwith Pres
ident Lyman." Aware that a $50 dollar
prize was offered the same day for
another frisbee, she asked if her
offer was still valid. Lyman re
sponded hospitably by offering to
treat her to a Stern cafeteria dinner.

interest among undergraduates in
getting a humanities education.
"Too often humanities are taught
as a pre-professional subject,"
Lyman commented.
The commission will report its
findings in a public document which
will reach government, university
and academic circles.

One student asked whether the
athletic department prohibition of
bottles and cans in the Stanford
stadium will continue. He said that
because of the restriction, various
student groups are making more of
an effort to smuggle in alcoholic be
verages.
Lyman replied that the prohibition
was a result of the Pac-10 concern
that bottles and cans can be "poten
tial missiles."
"The policy is not likely to be
abandoned; it might be modified in
the light of experience," he added.
On the lighter side, a freshman
told Lyman that during Field Day she
found a frisbee on which was writ
ten, "Good forone dinnerwith Pres
ident Lyman." Aware that a $50 dollar
prize was offered the same day for
another frisbee, she asked if her
offer was still valid. Lyman re
sponded hospitably by offering to
treat her to a Stern cafeteria dinner.
President Richard Lyman discus
sed Medical School admission pol
icy, the Chinese exchange program
and the new football stadium
policies at an informal question
and-answer session held at Larkin
house last night.
The event was recorded by KZSU
and will be broadcast on Campus
Conference tomorrow.
Lyman began by clarifying the new

Med School admission policy in re
sponse to newspaper articles which
Lyman said were misleading.
"The Stanford Medical School Se
nate . . . was redesigning a program
aimed at doing as well in affirmative
action terms as any program they had
done before, but doing so with a
view to conforming to the guidelines
implied by the Bakke decision earlier
this summer from the United States
Supreme Court."
Single admissions committee
Lyman said the program included
"the abolition of a separate admis
sions committee for minority candi
dates and the expansion of the now
single admissions committee so that
it could do a better job ... in taking
into account minority status in the
admission process."
The Bakke decision declared the
use of racial quotas in admission
guidelines unconstitutional.
Lyman expressed concern that na
tional press coverage of the policy
change implied that the University
"abandoned its efforts to recruit and
enroll minority students."
On the contrary, Lyman said, the

new policy would compare each
applicant to the entire body of
applicants while "affirming its com
mitment to enrolling significant
numbers" of minority students.
Lyman said he expects the new pol
icy to bring in as many minority stu
dents as the old policy has in past
years.
Exchange program
Campus Conference host Doug
Michaels asked the president about
the exchange program of scholars
between the People's Republic of
China and the University which will
take place later this month.
According to Lyman, the Chinese
exchange party will consist of six
people with the American equivalent
of post-doctorates in the scientific
and technical fields.
The University delegation has yet
to be chosen, but Lyman predicted
that "it will be difficult to pick and
choose" because the number
selected will be small compared to
the number of people interested.
It has not yet been determined
whether students will participate in
the exchange.
Lyman also discussed the prob
lems that the Commission on the
Humanities, of which he was re
cently appointed chairman, will
examine.
One problem "is the fact that we
are in some danger of losing a whole
generation of scholars in the
humanities because they cannot find
employment related to their train
ing."
Also, judging from enrollment fi
gures, there is an apparent lack of
interest among undergraduates in
getting a humanities education.
