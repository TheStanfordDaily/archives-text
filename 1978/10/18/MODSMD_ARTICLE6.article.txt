# Clinic helps students with drinking problems
## 
### RACHEL BAGBY 
"Alcoholism doesn't discriminate
by race, sex, class or age," said Dr.
Stephanie Brown, associate director
of the Stanford Alcohol Clinic. "Any
one can be afflicted with the dis
ease."
The clinic, located in TF 213 — next
to the Sherman Fairchild Center —
has been in existence for a year. It
offers individually-tailored counsel
ing and referral services to area resi
dents troubled by alcoholism.
"Our services range from evalua
tion and counseling of individuals
with drinking problems to counsel
ing spouses of such individuals,"
Brown said. "The counseling might
be informational or much more in
depth, depending on the individual's
need.
"Approximately one third of our
clients have stopped drinking," she
added. "We help them find new
methods of coping with their an
xieties."
Couple therapy
The center also conducts couple
therapy and a special therapy group
on Wednesday afternoons for adult
children of alcoholics. According to
Brown, a number of students here
have alcoholic parents.
"These students generally tend to
have problems with trust and inti
macy," Brown said. "Perhaps they
have grown up feeling responsible
for their parents' alcoholism.
"The group allows them to talk
about their problems, and that
helps," she added.
But only a few of the students with
drinking problems seek help, Brown
said. "A large number of college stu
dents are alcoholics," she said. "In
fact, the number of student alcohol
abusers is increasing."
Brown stated that parents are de
lighted that their children use al
cohol rather than other drugs and
that this may partially explain the in
crease in student alcoholics.
Alcohol 'coping device'
"It's hard for students to acknow
ledge a drinking problem because

drinking is a part of college culture,"
she said. "Peer pressure to drink is
difficult to resist.
"College is a very difficult period,"
she added. "For students faced with
the pressures of school and new rela
tionships, drinking appears to be a
coping device. But it is eventually
unsuccessful."
According to Brown, drinking be
comes addictive when the individual
"can't function without it.
"Alcoholism is an extremely seri
ous problem with professors, physi
cians, lawyers — all professionals,"
she said. "They have to cope with
such enormous job pressures.
Problem for professionals
"Yet professionals have a harder
time asking for help," Brown said.
"They generally believe that one
ought to be able to solve one's prob
lems by one's self."
According to Brown, such feelings
make it difficult for problem drinkers
to seek help.
"Alcoholism is still stigmatizing,"
she said. She attributed some of this
to the public's ignorance of the na
ture of the disease.
"There's plenty of information av
ailable on alcoholism," she said, ad
ding that the problem is getting it to
those who need it.
Pamphlets
Pamphlets and other information
on alcoholism is available at the al
cohol clinic. Each week the clinic
gives one of a series of 12 informal
lectures on various aspects of the
disease.
"The lectures involve really small
groups," Brown said. "It's one way
for someone concerned about a
drinking problem to get informa
tion."
Next Monday afternoon, the
clinic's lecture is on college students
and alcoholism.
"Just coming to the lectures repre
sents a big step," Brown said.
"Many suffer in silence because of
fear. We try to show them that we're
willing to help and that they're not
alone."

Pamphlets and other information
on alcoholism is available at the al
cohol clinic. Each week the clinic
gives one of a series of 12 informal
lectures on various aspects of the
disease.
"The lectures involve really small
groups," Brown said. "It's one way
for someone concerned about a
drinking problem to get informa
tion."
Next Monday afternoon, the
clinic's lecture is on college students
and alcoholism.
"Just coming to the lectures repre
sents a big step," Brown said.
"Many suffer in silence because of
fear. We try to show them that we're
willing to help and that they're not
alone."
"Alcoholism doesn't discriminate
by race, sex, class or age," said Dr.
Stephanie Brown, associate director
of the Stanford Alcohol Clinic. "Any
one can be afflicted with the dis
ease."
The clinic, located in TF 213 — next
to the Sherman Fairchild Center —
has been in existence for a year. It
offers individually-tailored counsel
ing and referral services to area resi
dents troubled by alcoholism.
"Our services range from evalua
tion and counseling of individuals
with drinking problems to counsel
ing spouses of such individuals,"
Brown said. "The counseling might
be informational or much more in
depth, depending on the individual's
need.
"Approximately one third of our
clients have stopped drinking," she
added. "We help them find new
methods of coping with their an
xieties."
Couple therapy
The center also conducts couple
therapy and a special therapy group
on Wednesday afternoons for adult
children of alcoholics. According to
Brown, a number of students here
have alcoholic parents.
"These students generally tend to
have problems with trust and inti
macy," Brown said. "Perhaps they
have grown up feeling responsible
for their parents' alcoholism.
"The group allows them to talk
about their problems, and that
helps," she added.
But only a few of the students with
drinking problems seek help, Brown
said. "A large number of college stu
dents are alcoholics," she said. "In
fact, the number of student alcohol
abusers is increasing."
Brown stated that parents are de
lighted that their children use al
cohol rather than other drugs and
that this may partially explain the in
crease in student alcoholics.
Alcohol 'coping device'
"It's hard for students to acknow
ledge a drinking problem because

drinking is a part of college culture,"
she said. "Peer pressure to drink is
difficult to resist.
"College is a very difficult period,"
she added. "For students faced with
the pressures of school and new rela
tionships, drinking appears to be a
coping device. But it is eventually
unsuccessful."
According to Brown, drinking be
comes addictive when the individual
"can't function without it.
"Alcoholism is an extremely seri
ous problem with professors, physi
cians, lawyers — all professionals,"
she said. "They have to cope with
such enormous job pressures.
Problem for professionals
"Yet professionals have a harder
time asking for help," Brown said.
"They generally believe that one
ought to be able to solve one's prob
lems by one's self."
According to Brown, such feelings
make it difficult for problem drinkers
to seek help.
"Alcoholism is still stigmatizing,"
she said. She attributed some of this
to the public's ignorance of the na
ture of the disease.
"There's plenty of information av
ailable on alcoholism," she said, ad
ding that the problem is getting it to
those who need it.
