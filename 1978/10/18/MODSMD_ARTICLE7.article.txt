# Affirmative action: is more necessary?

### ROGER BATCHELOR 
(Editor's note: This is the first of two articles
exploring various aspects of the University's
affirmative action policies.)
A coordinated effort by the University to
integrate and expand minority participation
here officially began 10 years ago with the
enactment of affirmative action programs. A
number of effective and innovative prog
rams have been implemented. For example,
successful recruiting efforts by under
graduate and graduate admissions officers,
in most schools, have resulted in increased
minority enrollment during the last decade.
The University decided to recruit and hire
more black professors and strenuous efforts
have been made by the Procurement Ser
vices Department here to attract and employ
minority service firms to do work for the
University. The minority classification refers
to blacks, Chicanos, Asian-Americans and
other racial groups.
As might be expected, there are a number
of areas where action is still necessary. Cir
cumstances frustrate it and controversy still
rages. Some of the problems are a declining
enrollment of minority graduate students in
some schools, a partial lack of "external af
firmative action" in construction projects
here and a lack of minority participation in
policy-making areas here. According to
Henry Organ, associate director of founda
tions at the Office of Development, these
problems deserve attention by University of
ficials.
Organ believes the problems are further
frustrated because local black leaders are
unwilling to voice their opinions on the is

sues. Organ says they are "insecure about
losing their jobs" and fear that the situations
they find unsatisfactory are going to worsen.
In addition, some say that administrators
here are more complacent about affirmative
action programs than in past years because
they believe the difficulties minorities face
have largely subsided. Maria Baeza, special
assistant to President Richard Lyman for
Chicano affairs, said "Several colleges and
universities in the east and midwest have
dropped their affirmative action programs
altogether." A memo to Lyman, April 1977,
from the steering committee of the Stanford
Black Caucus, comprised of five adminis
trators here, said, "Our problems have not
been absorbed, but have been com
pounded."
Enrollment in grad schools
Minority enrollment in graduate schools
here has declined and has fallen short of
goals set several years ago, Harold Boyd,
associate dean of student affairs, said. He
said this is especially true in the School of
Law. Baeza said total minority presence in all
graduate programs peaked in 1974 and has
"eroded steadily since."
Unlike the undergraduate division,
graduate school admissions here are decen
tralized. Most decisions on candidates' ac
ceptances or rejections are decided by indi
vidual schools and departments. Schools in
the social sciences and humanities have bet
ter reputations for affirmative action than
schools in the technological sciences, Baeza
said.
Statistics on minority enrollment at the
School of Medicine show a constant decline

over the last five years. Drops of three per
cent of total school enrollment, 25 percent
of peak minority enrollment have occurred
there. Small percentage decreases in overall
total enrollment are "tremendous losses" to
minority groups because of their small
numbers, Baeza said.
Dean of the Law School Charles Meyers is
on vacation and no admissions officers at the
school would release data concerning
minority enrollment.
Lyman said the drop in minority graduate
student enrollment is "a problem we've
been agonizing over for years." The cause is
not certain because of the lack of "adequate
research" in the area, Lyman said. He thinks
the drain of minorities from graduate work is
the result of "the opening of more oppor
tunities for minorities with bachelor de
grees." Minority students who have
graduated from college do not want to put in
the time and money necessary for graduate
school work, he said. Lyman also said a
minority student frequently wants to accept
the first job offered to him, often im
mediately following undergraduate work.
'External affirmative action'
Another problem for minorities cited by
Organ is the lack of "external affirmative
action" programs here. "External affirmative
action" refers to the influence exerted by
the University on construction firms pre
sently or potentially employed here to de
velop strong affirmative action policies. The
University has charged some contractors
and unions with having inadequate "exter
nal affirmative action" programs.
Because of the space and wealth posses

sed by the University, it is the only business
or organization on the peninsula capable of
building on a very large scale, Organ said.
He believes decisions made by the Univer
sity can exert a strong influence on the hiring
opportunities for minorities.
Organ said that the University is employ
ing firms that have poor affirmative action
programs. In a memo to Lyman several years
ago, Organ charged the University with
"willful financing of racism." A debate bet
ween Organ and other administrators en
sued in late 1975 and 1976, Organ said.
In one memo to Organ, January 1978,
Lyman stated, "I further agree that we ought
not consider ourselves limited to 'friendly
persuasion' in seeking to bring affirmative
action responses from contractors." In
another memo, November 1975, then Vice-
President of Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger, said, "It is our intent to in
crease such efforts. The University is pre
pared to 'apply its own standards vigorously'
and to use sanctions as necessary."
According to Ken Down, chairman of the
External Affirmative Action Panel here last
year, these efforts have been made. He said
the University often refuses contracts to
contractors with poor affirmative action re
cords. But the situation still upsets Organ.
Over the past several years, adminis
trators, in various memos, have stated that
the University meets federal quotas for
minority employment in construction jobs.
The University employs a higher percentage
of minorities than the percentage employed
in Santa Clara County, the county in which

the University resides. The University
examines statistics from the county, using
them as a basis of comparison for judging
University policies.
However, Organ said that the federal gov
ernment is "notoriously weak" in determin
ing standards for minority employment ifi
construction projects and that limiting the
statistical comparisons to Santa Clara
County is wrong because construction
workers here come "from as far away as
Santa Cruz to work." Organ said the Univer
sity should make comparisons with the area
from which it actually draws its workers.
Were this comparison made, Organ said the
University's percentage of minority
employment in construction would be sub
standard.
The root of the "external affirmative ac
tion" problem lies in the unions' strict sup
port of seniority programs, Organ said. This
policy hurts the "more recently hired work
ers." Generally, minority workers have been
hired most recently.
Down reported that another problem with
enacting "external affirmative action" is that
apprentice programs for training workers
offer low pay. This discourages minorities
with families from entering skilled trades.
The University is working to solve this prob
lem by "urging higher pay for apprentices,"
Down said.
The second part of this article, to appear
tomorrow, examines salary determination of
minority employees here and the abolition
of the position of special assistant to Lyman
for black affairs.
