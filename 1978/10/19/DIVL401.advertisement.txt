That's what you'll find at Northern California Savings
when you use
TELEPHONE TRANSFER.
You can transfer funds from savings to checking, or from
checking to savings with a telephone call. It's conven
ient . . . quick . . . and safe. And best of all, there aren't
any long lines.
Here's how to set it up: Call MARK TRISKA, NCS
representative in the Stanford Community at 329-9851
or 326-2790. He'll get things going. Use your phone . . .
that's what it's all about.
