# Salary questions remain
## Minority policies stir debate 
### 
By ROGER BATCHELOR
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond of two articles exploring
the University's affirmative ac
tion policies.)
Most University policy deci
sions are made by committees
composed of faculty, graduate
and undergraduate students
and administrative staff.
Henry Organ, associate di
rector of foundations at the Of
fice of Development, said
minority representation on
these committees is low, in fact
nonexistent on some commit
tees which deal with minority
questions. The minority clas
sification refers to blacks,
Chicanos, Asian-Americans
and other racial groups. Organ
said that he counted "only five
blacks" on the roster of Uni
versity committee members.

News analysis

Associate Dean of Student
Affairs Dean Boyd concurred
that, "There are few blacks in
policy-making areas." The
same is true for Chicanos,
Maria Baeza, special assistant
to President Richard Lyman for
Chicano affairs, said.
Further, despite awareness
by some administrators that
problems exist in this area, few
attempts have been made in
recent years to record minority
participation on policy-making
committees. Lyman's assist
ant, Jean Fetter, through whom
clerical work concerning
committee membership is
funneled, said she has never
seen any reports detailing
nominations and positions of
minority faculty and staff to

University committees.
Fetter also said, "It is difficult
to get black faculty representa
tives because they are few in
number and are already over
committed." Lyman said that
because minorities "are hired
away by organizations who can
pay more," than the Univer
sity, there is a smaller minority
pool here from which to draw
committee members. He said,
"I am aware of the problem.
Applicable past experience
Organ and Anne Miner, af
firmative action officer here
last year, also complained
about the use of applicable ex
perience as a criteria for de
termining salary levels of
employees here.
The University uses a variety
of factors to determine the an
nual pay of each salaried
employee, including current
responsibilities and personal
performance. Another factor,
"years of applicable experi
ence," is a measure of educa
tional, career and volunteer
experience applicable to the
current job of an employee.
Paul FeaTer, compensation
manager in the Personnel De
partment here, said this factor
is a "rough but helpful mea
sure, refined each year to help

get a broad view of the
employee."
However, women and
minorities have generally been
in the job market for less time
and hence have fewer years of
applicable experience than
white males.
This problem was noted sev
eral years ago in a memoran
dum from Miner to the Univer
sity Office of Development.
The memo said, "We found the
belief that the use of years
applicable experience as a fac
tor in salaries is a poor policy
primarily because of its effect
on women and minority
employees. It is a serious is
sue." Organ described the af
firmative action program,
under Miner's direction, as
"middle-of-the-road."
The University still uses the
applicable experience criteria.
Keith Smith, acting director of
the Affirmative Action Office,
reported hearing "no com
plaints so far." He began work
as director this fall.
Special position
Organ also objects to the ab
sence of a position of special
assistant to Lyman for black af
fairs. While currently a similar
position exists for Chicano af
fairs, the position for blacks

was terminated several years
ago.
In 1973, James Simmons,
who had held the position, re
commended it be terminated.
The University concurred
"over the objections of black
leaders in the community,"
Organ said.
The Office of Black Affairs
was formed in 1969 by Univer
sity President Kenneth Pitzer in
response to protest demonst
rations by blacks. Organ said it
served as "a valuable liaison
between blacks and the Uni
versity and made the black
community here more cohe
sive."
A memo from Lyman to the
steering committee of the
Stanford Black Caucus, May
1977, stated that offices such as
the one for Chicano affairs "in
evitably take pressure off other
parts of the University to per
form their functions with spe
cial regard to the needs of
minorities. The disadvantages
(of having such an office)
would far outweigh the advan
tages." Lyman does not want to
maintain special offices on a
long-term basis. Lyman said
such programs would be ph
ased out, as has already occur
red with the Office of Black Af
fairs.

Most University policy deci
sions are made by committees
composed of faculty, graduate
and undergraduate students
and administrative staff.
Henry Organ, associate di
rector of foundations at the Of
fice of Development, said
minority representation on
these committees is low, in fact
nonexistent on some commit
tees which deal with minority
questions. The minority clas
sification refers to blacks,
Chicanos, Asian-Americans
and other racial groups. Organ
said that he counted "only five
blacks" on the roster of Uni
versity committee members.

News analysis

Associate Dean of Student
Affairs Dean Boyd concurred
that, "There are few blacks in
policy-making areas." The
same is true for Chicanos,
Maria Baeza, special assistant
to President Richard Lyman for
Chicano affairs, said.
Further, despite awareness
by some administrators that
problems exist in this area, few
attempts have been made in
recent years to record minority
participation on policy-making
committees. Lyman's assist
ant, Jean Fetter, through whom
clerical work concerning
committee membership is
funneled, said she has never
seen any reports detailing
nominations and positions of
minority faculty and staff to

University committees.
Fetter also said, "It is difficult
to get black faculty representa
tives because they are few in
number and are already over
committed." Lyman said that
because minorities "are hired
away by organizations who can
pay more," than the Univer
sity, there is a smaller minority
pool here from which to draw
committee members. He said,
"I am aware of the problem.
Applicable past experience
Organ and Anne Miner, af
firmative action officer here
last year, also complained
about the use of applicable ex
perience as a criteria for de
termining salary levels of
employees here.
The University uses a variety
of factors to determine the an
nual pay of each salaried
employee, including current
responsibilities and personal
performance. Another factor,
"years of applicable experi
ence," is a measure of educa
tional, career and volunteer
experience applicable to the
current job of an employee.
Paul FeaTer, compensation
manager in the Personnel De
partment here, said this factor
is a "rough but helpful mea
sure, refined each year to help

get a broad view of the
employee."
However, women and
minorities have generally been
in the job market for less time
and hence have fewer years of
applicable experience than
white males.
This problem was noted sev
eral years ago in a memoran
dum from Miner to the Univer
sity Office of Development.
The memo said, "We found the
belief that the use of years
applicable experience as a fac
tor in salaries is a poor policy
primarily because of its effect
on women and minority
employees. It is a serious is
sue." Organ described the af
firmative action program,
under Miner's direction, as
"middle-of-the-road."
The University still uses the
applicable experience criteria.
Keith Smith, acting director of
the Affirmative Action Office,
reported hearing "no com
plaints so far." He began work
as director this fall.
Special position
Organ also objects to the ab
sence of a position of special
assistant to Lyman for black af
fairs. While currently a similar
position exists for Chicano af
fairs, the position for blacks

was terminated several years
ago.
In 1973, James Simmons,
who had held the position, re
commended it be terminated.
The University concurred
"over the objections of black
leaders in the community,"
Organ said.
The Office of Black Affairs
was formed in 1969 by Univer
sity President Kenneth Pitzer in
response to protest demonst
rations by blacks. Organ said it
served as "a valuable liaison
between blacks and the Uni
versity and made the black
community here more cohe

fairs, the position for blacks

was terminated several years
ago.
In 1973, James Simmons,
who had held the position, re
commended it be terminated.
The University concurred
"over the objections of black
leaders in the community,"
Organ said.
The Office of Black Affairs
was formed in 1969 by Univer
sity President Kenneth Pitzer in
response to protest demonst
rations by blacks. Organ said it
served as "a valuable liaison
between blacks and the Uni
versity and made the black
community here more cohe
sive."
A memo from Lyman to the
steering committee of the
Stanford Black Caucus, May
1977, stated that offices such as
the one for Chicano affairs "in
evitably take pressure off other
parts of the University to per
form their functions with spe
cial regard to the needs of
minorities. The disadvantages
(of having such an office)
would far outweigh the advan
tages." Lyman does not want to
maintain special offices on a
long-term basis. Lyman said
such programs would be ph
ased out, as has already occur
red with the Office of Black Af
fairs.
