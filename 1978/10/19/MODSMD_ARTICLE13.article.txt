Women's work, mental
health, and sexuality are
among the subjects studied by
researchers from the Center
for Research on Women
(CROW) in Polya Hall here.
"Basically what we are is an
organization where faculty and
students can come together to
share their interest in women
related research," said Prog
ram Director Marge Davis.
Faculty from different de
partments work together on
many interdisciplinary pro
jects, said Dr. Marilyn Yalon,
associate director.
CROW and its affiliated fa
culty members also co-sponsor
workshops, films, and lec
tures, according to Yalon.
Yalon herself conducted re
search for "The Female Sexual
ity Project," a study which
explored changes in attitudes
and behaviors of college
women in the '50s and 70s,
through questionnaires.
She said that although the
researchers expected and
found increased sexuality in
the '70s women; they did not
find the kind of resulting con
flict and trauma between
mothers and daughters they
had anticipated. A lot of
mothers understood their
daughter's behavior even if
they didn't approve of it.
"There was a lot of flexibility
on both the mother's and
daughter's parts," said Yalon.
Much of CROW's research
has policy implications, ac
cording to Yalon. A current
project focuses on women and
stress at work. If researchers
could determine what factors
in the work environment
create gender-related stress,
personnel departments might
then structure work environ
ments to prevent this stress
and to help women to cope
with stressful situations that do
occur.

CROW provides research
opportunities forvisiting scho
lars, graduate students and
undergraduates. Visiting scho
lars and graduate students
usually work on topics of their
own interest or collective pro
jects. Undergraduates assist
with surveys and conferences
and serve as summer interns
and work-study students.
"The data we collect works
its way into journals and
books," said Yalon. "A pub
lishing series is to be inauguar
'ated this year."
"Women here are more
aware of their career options
than women at most other
campuses," Yalon said.
She cited the survey of the
Class of 1982, in which one
fifth of the entering freshwo
men listed their major as en
gineering, as an example of
this vocational orientafion.

"This is not a remarkably ac
tivist campus," Yalon stated.
"However, I do think there is a
nucleus of women who have
done a lot of things. Aurora, (a
feminist newspaper) is a won
derful example of feminism."
Yalon also praised Women's
Week and Half the Sky prog
rams.
Many women and some men
from within and outside the
University community partici
pate in CROW activities.
Most of CROW's research is
funded by a three-year
$100,000 founding grant from
the Ford Foundation, Yalon
said. Additional grants are con
tributed by the University,
corporations, foundations and
individuals. CROW's annual
operating budget ranges bet
ween $100,000 and $150,000.
