### GAYLE MAYERS 
The newly-appointed Direc
tor of the Law Fund here said
she hopes to raise "at least
one-half million dollars" in this
year's annual fund drive.
Money is raised for the Law
Fund by a "national network of
alumni volunteers," said Direc
tor Linda Feigel. The Law Fund
workers contact Stanford Law
School graduates throughout
the country, soliciting dona
tions from alumni within the
volunteer's region. Last year
$517,000 was raised.
Donations are made to two
Law Fund programs which are
categorized according to the
amount of the donation; the
Law Inner Quad for gifts of
$1000 and more the Law Quad
for gifts of $100 to $1000, Feigel
said.
During "Alumni Week,"
held this year Nov. 3 and 4,

there is a fund raising drive di
rected especially toward the
class celebrating its 25th reun
ion, Feigel said. Alumni Week
is primarily a social event for
Law School alumni.
Money received through the
Law Fund program is unre
stricted, Feigel said, and is
used at the discretion of the
dean of the Law School. She
added that there are other re
stricted donations made, to be
used only for specified areas
such as scholarship funds or
the library.
In the past the Law Fund has
operated during the fiscal year,
Sept. 1 to Aug. 31, but begin
ning in 1979, the fund drive will
be conducted during the
calendar year, Feigel said. Be
cause of the change, a smaller
"Fall '78 Campaign" to collect
funds will be held during the
interim, Feigel said.
