# Organization 'so honest it's sickening'
## Group helps angry consumers 
### PAN DEMETRAKAKES 
Irving "Slim" Ingham has a
phone call from an angry con
sumer. "I see. Not in the
pleasurable sense, I assume."
He strokes his iron-gray beard.
"You have this documented in
any way?. . . Did he give you a
reason for that? . . . That does
sound like very improper prac
tices."
He sets up an appointment,
"so I can contact this some
what unethical broker, while
you're there."
Ingham is the head of Con
sumers United, a nonprofit
corporation he said recovers
more than $1 million each year
in Mid-Peninsula consumer
claims.
The group, with two offices
in Palo Alto and one in Sun
nyvale, has a staff of approxi
mately 800, according to In
gham. All are volunteers, most
of them professionals: scien
tists, engineers, lawyers.
"When you have a mechani
cal engineer with Shell de
velopment against an auto
dealer, the engineer has the
upper hand," Ingham said.
Consumers United began 10
years ago, when a group of
housewives wanted to do
something about food prices.
"They found a lot of the stuff
was hardware-oriented, so I
got recruited," Ingham said.
"Then I recruited more, and
so on."

Now, the organization is at
the point where, according to
Ingham, "for each person we
take in, we turn down 10."
Agencies 'useless'
This selectivity, Ingham said,
gives Consumer's United an
advantage over government
agencies. "The federal, state
and county consumer-help
agencies are basically as use
less as tits on a snowbird," he
said. "Myself and others are
nonpaid consultants to them.
This came about because they
wondered why we are 95 per
cent effective and they aren't.
That's because "there are no
ossified derrieres with us. We
are not civil servants. We don't
have a guidebook. We have
superior expertise and we're
so honest it's sickening."
Ingham, 50, acquired his ex
pertise outside of school. "Be
ing self-taught means you
slough off all extraneous
stuff," he said.
He finished high school in
the Army, and specialized in
bomb disposal. After his dis
charge, he returned to Palo
Alto, where he has lived since
age eight, taking a job with
Lockheed Aircraft Corp. as a
researcher in explosive mate
rial. He stayed with Lockheed
19 years, then joined the Stan
ford Research Institute for six
years, retiring then to devote
more time to Consumers Un
ited.

Now, Ingham also works as
an "adversary consultant" to
Shell Oil. "I look at the tenta
cles of the octopus — how the
individual station is screwing
people. Then, once a year,
they take me out to dinner and
I tell them what they're doing
wrong."
All kinds
Though all kinds of people
turn to Consumers United for
help, Ingham said the upper
and lower classes are particu
larly well-represented. "The
depressed classes, east of
Bayshore, really take their
shots," he said.
Upper-class people turn up,
because of their unfamiliarity
with mechanical things. In
gham said many of these in
clude Stanford professors:
"Once out of the confines of
the University, some of them
can't blow their noses without
getting slimy fingers."

Ingham said his most satisfy
ing case dealt with a defective
mobile home. A couple bought
the plus unit last year from a
reputable Sunnyvale dealer.
When it was delivered, it
turned out to have more than
30 defects, he said, among
them a bent back door, a bro
ken toilet, unconnected vents
and wiring that caused two
minor fires. After getting no
help from the dealer or the fac
tory, the couple turned to
Consumers United.
Ingham did a complete en
gineering survey of the mobile
home. "I got one of my en
gineers, a real tiny fellow, to do
the underneath photography."
Consumers United filed suit
against the dealer and the fac
tory. It was settled before
reaching court. The couple got
a new mobile home, plus ex
penses, damages and a hous
ing allowance.

nyvale, has a staff of approxi
mately 800, according to In
gham. All are volunteers, most
of them professionals: scien
tists, engineers, lawyers.
"When you have a mechani
cal engineer with Shell de
velopment against an auto
dealer, the engineer has the
upper hand," Ingham said.
Consumers United began 10
years ago, when a group of
housewives wanted to do
something about food prices.
"They found a lot of the stuff
was hardware-oriented, so I
got recruited," Ingham said.
"Then I recruited more, and
so on."

Now, the organization is at
the point where, according to
Ingham, "for each person we
take in, we turn down 10."
Agencies 'useless'
This selectivity, Ingham said,
gives Consumer's United an
advantage over government
agencies. "The federal, state
and county consumer-help
agencies are basically as use
less as tits on a snowbird," he
said. "Myself and others are
nonpaid consultants to them.
This came about because they
wondered why we are 95 per
cent effective and they aren't.
That's because "there are no
ossified derrieres with us. We
are not civil servants. We don't
have a guidebook. We have
superior expertise and we're
so honest it's sickening."
Ingham, 50, acquired his ex
pertise outside of school. "Be
ing self-taught means you
slough off all extraneous
stuff," he said.
He finished high school in
the Army, and specialized in
bomb disposal. After his dis
charge, he returned to Palo
Alto, where he has lived since
age eight, taking a job with
Lockheed Aircraft Corp. as a
researcher in explosive mate
rial. He stayed with Lockheed
19 years, then joined the Stan
ford Research Institute for six
years, retiring then to devote
more time to Consumers Un
ited.

Now, Ingham also works as
an "adversary consultant" to
Shell Oil. "I look at the tenta
cles of the octopus — how the
individual station is screwing
people. Then, once a year,
they take me out to dinner and
I tell them what they're doing
wrong."
All kinds
Though all kinds of people
turn to Consumers United for
help, Ingham said the upper
and lower classes are particu
larly well-represented. "The
depressed classes, east of
Bayshore, really take their
shots," he said.
Upper-class people turn up,
because of their unfamiliarity
with mechanical things. In
gham said many of these in
clude Stanford professors:
"Once out of the confines of
the University, some of them
can't blow their noses without
getting slimy fingers."

Ingham said his most satisfy
ing case dealt with a defective
mobile home. A couple bought
the plus unit last year from a
reputable Sunnyvale dealer.
When it was delivered, it
turned out to have more than
30 defects, he said, among
them a bent back door, a bro
ken toilet, unconnected vents
and wiring that caused two
minor fires. After getting no
help from the dealer or the fac
tory, the couple turned to
Consumers United.
Ingham did a complete en
gineering survey of the mobile
home. "I got one of my en
gineers, a real tiny fellow, to do
the underneath photography."
Consumers United filed suit
against the dealer and the fac
tory. It was settled before
reaching court. The couple got
a new mobile home, plus ex
penses, damages and a hous
ing allowance.
Irving "Slim" Ingham has a
phone call from an angry con
sumer. "I see. Not in the
pleasurable sense, I assume."
He strokes his iron-gray beard.
"You have this documented in
any way?. . . Did he give you a
reason for that? . . . That does
sound like very improper prac
tices."
He sets up an appointment,
"so I can contact this some
what unethical broker, while
you're there."
Ingham is the head of Con
sumers United, a nonprofit
corporation he said recovers
more than $1 million each year
in Mid-Peninsula consumer
claims.
The group, with two offices
in Palo Alto and one in Sun
nyvale, has a staff of approxi
