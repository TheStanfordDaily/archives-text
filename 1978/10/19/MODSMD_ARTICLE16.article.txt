## William Balson Concern for interaction 
### 
The time has come to cease
attacking libertarian positions
from a purely emotional
standpoint. The libertarian
movement is motivated by a
deeply ethical concern for
human interaction. To claim as
Jeffrey Zorn did in his article
(Daily, Oct. 12) entitled "At
tacking public education
dangerous," that persons who
oppose public education are
racial bigots, religious
separatists or ignorant is both
demagoguery and elitism.
Demagoguery because he is
clearly appealing to our emo
tional reaction to those people
and elitism because he is im
plying that these people have
no opinions worth listening to.
Zorn's article is so filled with
emotional appeals, unsubstan
tiated claims,and half-truths
that it would be too lengthy to
respond comprehensively. I
will respond to two areas. First,
the claim that people "have no
'right' to renounce their share
of the common care of our
democracy." Second, the
claim that the "citizenry should
all know something of their
common and separate his
tories."
The libertarian position is
based on the so-called non
aggression principle. This is a
self-evident axiom of human
nature which is neither prova
ble nor disprovable. It is as
much a matter of faith as are
the "self-evident truths" listed
in the Declaration of Indepen
dence. The non-aggression
principle can be stated as "Ev
ery person is the owner of his
own life, and that no one is the
owner of anyone else's life;

and that consequently every
human being has the right to
act in accordance with his own
choices, unless those choices
infringe on the equal liberty of
other human beings to act in
accordance with their
choices." There is a great vol
ume of literature showing how
this principle leads to a cogent
exposition of property rights
and contract theory. For our
purposes, the principle itself is
enough.
As to the first claim, the real
issue is not whether a person
has the right to renounce his
share of the common care but
whether, once renounced,
anyone else has the right to use
violence or the threat of vio
lence to coerce that person to
recant. Renouncing support
can mean one of two things. It
can mean withdrawing verbal
support or material support.
Few would deny the right to
withdraw verbal support, but
what about material support?
The libertarian position holds
that so long as his property is
justly obtained (i.e. by not vio
lating the non-aggression prin
ciple), then he has the right to
decide how it will be used and
whether or not he should
withdraw support. If his prop
erty is unjestly obtained, then
the just owner has the right to
repossess it. We must con
clude therefore that a person
can withdraw support fromany
institution — governmental or
not.
Zorn's key mistake here is to
equate the existence of a right
with the ability to prevent vio
lations of that right. This is ab
surd. If a thief robs a house in
the night and goes uncaught,

do we say no violation of rights
has occurred? If a person mur
ders me and no one will be a
witness to the murder, do we
call the deed just? Surely, not!
There must be existing con
cepts of justice and liberty be
fore the institutions which en
force them are created.
As to the second claim, here
again the issue is not what
people "should" know, but
when we can use violence or
the threat of violence to
coerce. If a person's body is his
own, then clearly his mind is
also. Surely it is good to learn,
but is it ethical to throw a per
son in jail (reform school, men
tal institutions) for not learn
ing? Do blacks, women and na
tive Americans really believe
they are learning of their
"common and separate his
tories"? Who wrote the his
tory? We must conclude that
the use of violence to keep
public schools operational is
not only unethical but dow
nright destructive!
I would like to close on a
positive note with a quote from
Roy Childs, )r., editor of Liber
tarian Review: "Libertarians
themselves should take heart.
Our hope lies, as strange as it
may seem, not with any re
mnants from an illusory 'gol
den age' of individualism,
which never existed, but with
tomorrow. Our day has not
come and gone. It never
existed at all. It is our task to
see that it will exist in the fu
ture. The choice and the battle
are ours."

student in engineering -

cepts of justice and liberty be
fore the institutions which en
force them are created.
As to the second claim, here
again the issue is not what
people "should" know, but
when we can use violence or
the threat of violence to
coerce. If a person's body is his
own, then clearly his mind is
also. Surely it is good to learn,
but is it ethical to throw a per
son in jail (reform school, men
tal institutions) for not learn
ing? Do blacks, women and na
tive Americans really believe
they are learning of their
"common and separate his
tories"? Who wrote the his
tory? We must conclude that
the use of violence to keep
public schools operational is
not only unethical but dow
nright destructive!
I would like to close on a
positive note with a quote from
Roy Childs, )r., editor of Liber
tarian Review: "Libertarians
themselves should take heart.
Our hope lies, as strange as it
may seem, not with any re
mnants from an illusory 'gol
den age' of individualism,
which never existed, but with
tomorrow. Our day has not
come and gone. It never
existed at all. It is our task to
see that it will exist in the fu
ture. The choice and the battle
are ours."
( William Balson is a graduate
student in engineering -
economic systems.)
The time has come to cease
attacking libertarian positions
from a purely emotional
standpoint. The libertarian
movement is motivated by a
deeply ethical concern for
human interaction. To claim as
Jeffrey Zorn did in his article
(Daily, Oct. 12) entitled "At
tacking public education
dangerous," that persons who
oppose public education are
racial bigots, religious
separatists or ignorant is both
demagoguery and elitism.
Demagoguery because he is
clearly appealing to our emo
tional reaction to those people
and elitism because he is im
plying that these people have
no opinions worth listening to.
Zorn's article is so filled with
emotional appeals, unsubstan
tiated claims,and half-truths
that it would be too lengthy to
respond comprehensively. I
will respond to two areas. First,
the claim that people "have no
'right' to renounce their share
of the common care of our
democracy." Second, the
claim that the "citizenry should
all know something of their
common and separate his
tories."
The libertarian position is
based on the so-called non
aggression principle. This is a
self-evident axiom of human
nature which is neither prova
ble nor disprovable. It is as
much a matter of faith as are
the "self-evident truths" listed
in the Declaration of Indepen
dence. The non-aggression
principle can be stated as "Ev
ery person is the owner of his
own life, and that no one is the
owner of anyone else's life;

and that consequently every
human being has the right to
act in accordance with his own
choices, unless those choices
infringe on the equal liberty of
other human beings to act in
accordance with their
choices." There is a great vol
ume of literature showing how
this principle leads to a cogent
exposition of property rights
and contract theory. For our
purposes, the principle itself is
enough.
As to the first claim, the real
issue is not whether a person
has the right to renounce his
share of the common care but
whether, once renounced,
anyone else has the right to use
violence or the threat of vio
lence to coerce that person to
recant. Renouncing support
can mean one of two things. It
can mean withdrawing verbal
support or material support.
Few would deny the right to
withdraw verbal support, but
what about material support?
The libertarian position holds
that so long as his property is
justly obtained (i.e. by not vio
lating the non-aggression prin
ciple), then he has the right to
decide how it will be used and
whether or not he should
withdraw support. If his prop
erty is unjestly obtained, then
the just owner has the right to
repossess it. We must con
clude therefore that a person
can withdraw support fromany
institution — governmental or
not.
Zorn's key mistake here is to
equate the existence of a right
with the ability to prevent vio
lations of that right. This is ab
surd. If a thief robs a house in
the night and goes uncaught,

do we say no violation of rights
has occurred? If a person mur
ders me and no one will be a
witness to the murder, do we
call the deed just? Surely, not!
There must be existing con
cepts of justice and liberty be
fore the institutions which en
force them are created.
