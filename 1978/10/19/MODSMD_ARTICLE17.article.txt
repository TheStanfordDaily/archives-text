## Briggs Initiative violation of civil rights 
### 
By far, the most volatile issue at hand in the upcom
ing election is Proposition 6 — the Briggs Initiative. If
passed, this legislation would require the firing of
schoolworkers on the basis of homosexuality. The
implications of the passage of the Briggs Initiative are
far-reaching and frightening.
Most immediately, the firing*of a teacher because
of sexual preference is a blatant violation of civil
rights. In a country which claims to provide freedom
of speech and equal protection of the law for all, this
legislation is a glaring piece of hypocracy.
The Briggs Initiative, however, does not only en
danger the jobs of homosexual teachers. It is worded
so as to place under fire any teacher— homosexual or
heterosexual — who expresses sympathy for the civil
rights of gays. What the initiative attempts to do is
push the entire moral/social/sexual/political issue of

homosexuality into the dark. The assumption here is
that perhaps if we can't see it and don't have to deal
with it, it'll go away.
Underlying Proposition 6 are some basic miscon
ceptions which, if examined rationally, can be cor
rected. First of all, the Briggs Initiative assumes that
the morality of homosexuals (aren't we supposed to
know by now that sweeping generalizations are
dangerous and most often incorrect?) is inferior to
that of heterosexuals, thereby rendering them "unfit
to teach." Here, one set of morals has been assigned
to a vast number of people who comprise, in reality,
not a group made up of one kind of people but one
which covers all aspects of society, all sets of values,
all lifestyles. It is unfair and inaccurate to assign one
set of moral values to such a diversified spectrum of
people.
The Briggs Initiative rides on the fear that

homosexuality is an undermining, subversive force in
America — one which, if not controlled or elimi
nated, will bring about the downfall of American soc
iety through destruction of its basic unit, the nuclear
family. Aside from being overly apocalyptic, this fear
is simply unfounded. Homosexuality need not de
stroy the heterosexual family unit. Are we so rigid that
the thought of variety in familial structure frightens us
so? Homosexuality, in truth, is a viable alternative
which need not frighten or interfere with the lifes
tyles of others. It is merely an issue of individual
preference, the expression of which is guaranteed by
our Constitution.
The aforementioned fears and assumptions are
ones which, in the broadest sense, underlie the
Briggs Initiative; namely, fears of homosexuality's
implications for society in general. But even specifi
cally, with regards to the immediate issue of
homosexual teachers, the initiative bases its argu
ments on fear.
Proposition 6 uses the heavily charged "Save Our
Children" theme in its crusade. This appeal is not to
the rational logic of the voters but rather to their
emotions and societally-imbued fears. Pro-Briggs lit
erature holds the spectre of homosexual child moles
tation over the heads of its readers, despite
documented evidence that the overwhelming major
ity of child molesters are heterosexual. Proponents
prefer to transcend the facts, appealing instead to the
nurturant softness in our hearts for children, rallying
all to their cause of protecting the innocents, brand
ing as callous all who do not respond.
The initiative also appeals to the parents' fear of
loss of influence over their children. The assumption
is that homosexual teachers will influence children
and favorably dispose them toward a homosexual
lifestyle. There are several flaws in this logic. One is
that homosexuality is not something imitated on a
whim because, perchance, it is presented favorably.
It is not something a child "tries" because a teacher
expressed sympathy for it. Secondly, by the time a
child enters school, he or she is very well instilled
with parental values.
Can a teacher, with whom the child spends a li
mited amount of time, really dictate a child's values
more influentially than a parent, with whom the child
grows up?
The comparative roles of parent and teacher as
moral educators are being distorted by the "Save Our
Children" claims. Closely linked with these claims is
the role of public schools in morally educating chil
dren. If parents want their children imbued with cer
tain values, it is their responsibility to do so.
Teaching a child values, however, is different than
shielding him or her from any other point of view.
This overprotective sheltering only breeds ignor
ance, the very thing schools try to eliminate. A broad
exposure to many sets of values is an essential pre
requisite for a well-rounded, informed and sensitive
existence.
The Briggs Initiative, in attempting to narrow the
spectrum of views presented in public schools to the
largely fundamentalist-Christian set of values, viol
ates the crucial separation of church and state. The
classroom should not be a pulpit from which the
gospel is uttered. Again, a child's moral leanings are
the parent's responsibility. The religious or moral
values implicated in the Briggs Initiative are not held
by all; thus the teaching of these ideas to the exclu
sion of all others is unjustifiable in public schools.
The Briggs Initiative betrays, above all else, fearand
misconceptions concerning homosexuality. It is not a
black spectre haunting American society, it will not
"take over" by way of the classroom. Rather,
homosexuality is a variation, a viable choice, a differ
ence which need not intimidate, influence, or inter
fere with the lives of students. Variety expands our
experience, our sensitivity and tolerance. Ignorance
serves only to limit our lives; knowlege to broaden
them.

By far, the most volatile issue at hand in the upcom
ing election is Proposition 6 — the Briggs Initiative. If
passed, this legislation would require the firing of
schoolworkers on the basis of homosexuality. The
implications of the passage of the Briggs Initiative are
far-reaching and frightening.
Most immediately, the firing*of a teacher because
of sexual preference is a blatant violation of civil
rights. In a country which claims to provide freedom
of speech and equal protection of the law for all, this
legislation is a glaring piece of hypocracy.
The Briggs Initiative, however, does not only en
danger the jobs of homosexual teachers. It is worded
so as to place under fire any teacher— homosexual or
heterosexual — who expresses sympathy for the civil
rights of gays. What the initiative attempts to do is
push the entire moral/social/sexual/political issue of

homosexuality into the dark. The assumption here is
that perhaps if we can't see it and don't have to deal
with it, it'll go away.
Underlying Proposition 6 are some basic miscon
ceptions which, if examined rationally, can be cor
rected. First of all, the Briggs Initiative assumes that
the morality of homosexuals (aren't we supposed to
know by now that sweeping generalizations are
dangerous and most often incorrect?) is inferior to
that of heterosexuals, thereby rendering them "unfit
to teach." Here, one set of morals has been assigned
to a vast number of people who comprise, in reality,
not a group made up of one kind of people but one
which covers all aspects of society, all sets of values,
all lifestyles. It is unfair and inaccurate to assign one
set of moral values to such a diversified spectrum of
people.
The Briggs Initiative rides on the fear that

homosexuality is an undermining, subversive force in
America — one which, if not controlled or elimi
nated, will bring about the downfall of American soc
iety through destruction of its basic unit, the nuclear
family. Aside from being overly apocalyptic, this fear
is simply unfounded. Homosexuality need not de
stroy the heterosexual family unit. Are we so rigid that
the thought of variety in familial structure frightens us
so? Homosexuality, in truth, is a viable alternative
which need not frighten or interfere with the lifes
tyles of others. It is merely an issue of individual
preference, the expression of which is guaranteed by
our Constitution.
The aforementioned fears and assumptions are
ones which, in the broadest sense, underlie the
Briggs Initiative; namely, fears of homosexuality's
implications for society in general. But even specifi
cally, with regards to the immediate issue of
homosexual teachers, the initiative bases its argu
ments on fear.
Proposition 6 uses the heavily charged "Save Our
Children" theme in its crusade. This appeal is not to
the rational logic of the voters but rather to their
emotions and societally-imbued fears. Pro-Briggs lit
erature holds the spectre of homosexual child moles
tation over the heads of its readers, despite
documented evidence that the overwhelming major
ity of child molesters are heterosexual. Proponents
prefer to transcend the facts, appealing instead to the
nurturant softness in our hearts for children, rallying
all to their cause of protecting the innocents, brand
ing as callous all who do not respond.
The initiative also appeals to the parents' fear of
loss of influence over their children. The assumption
is that homosexual teachers will influence children
and favorably dispose them toward a homosexual
lifestyle. There are several flaws in this logic. One is
that homosexuality is not something imitated on a
whim because, perchance, it is presented favorably.
It is not something a child "tries" because a teacher
expressed sympathy for it. Secondly, by the time a
child enters school, he or she is very well instilled
with parental values.
Can a teacher, with whom the child spends a li
mited amount of time, really dictate a child's values
more influentially than a parent, with whom the child
grows up?
The comparative roles of parent and teacher as
moral educators are being distorted by the "Save Our
Children" claims. Closely linked with these claims is
the role of public schools in morally educating chil
dren. If parents want their children imbued with cer
tain values, it is their responsibility to do so.
Teaching a child values, however, is different than
shielding him or her from any other point of view.
This overprotective sheltering only breeds ignor
ance, the very thing schools try to eliminate. A broad
exposure to many sets of values is an essential pre
requisite for a well-rounded, informed and sensitive
existence.
The Briggs Initiative, in attempting to narrow the
spectrum of views presented in public schools to the
largely fundamentalist-Christian set of values, viol
ates the crucial separation of church and state. The
classroom should not be a pulpit from which the
gospel is uttered. Again, a child's moral leanings are
the parent's responsibility. The religious or moral
values implicated in the Briggs Initiative are not held
by all; thus the teaching of these ideas to the exclu
sion of all others is unjustifiable in public schools.
The Briggs Initiative betrays, above all else, fearand
misconceptions concerning homosexuality. It is not a
black spectre haunting American society, it will not
"take over" by way of the classroom. Rather,
homosexuality is a variation, a viable choice, a differ
ence which need not intimidate, influence, or inter
fere with the lives of students. Variety expands our
experience, our sensitivity and tolerance. Ignorance
serves only to limit our lives; knowlege to broaden
them.

By far, the most volatile issue at hand in the upcom
ing election is Proposition 6 — the Briggs Initiative. If
passed, this legislation would require the firing of
schoolworkers on the basis of homosexuality. The
implications of the passage of the Briggs Initiative are
far-reaching and frightening.
Most immediately, the firing*of a teacher because
of sexual preference is a blatant violation of civil
rights. In a country which claims to provide freedom
of speech and equal protection of the law for all, this
legislation is a glaring piece of hypocracy.
The Briggs Initiative, however, does not only en
danger the jobs of homosexual teachers. It is worded
so as to place under fire any teacher— homosexual or
heterosexual — who expresses sympathy for the civil
rights of gays. What the initiative attempts to do is
push the entire moral/social/sexual/political issue of

homosexuality into the dark. The assumption here is
that perhaps if we can't see it and don't have to deal
with it, it'll go away.
Underlying Proposition 6 are some basic miscon
ceptions which, if examined rationally, can be cor
rected. First of all, the Briggs Initiative assumes that
the morality of homosexuals (aren't we supposed to
know by now that sweeping generalizations are
dangerous and most often incorrect?) is inferior to
that of heterosexuals, thereby rendering them "unfit
to teach." Here, one set of morals has been assigned
to a vast number of people who comprise, in reality,
not a group made up of one kind of people but one
which covers all aspects of society, all sets of values,
all lifestyles. It is unfair and inaccurate to assign one
set of moral values to such a diversified spectrum of
people.
The Briggs Initiative rides on the fear that

homosexuality is an undermining, subversive force in
America — one which, if not controlled or elimi
nated, will bring about the downfall of American soc
iety through destruction of its basic unit, the nuclear
family. Aside from being overly apocalyptic, this fear
is simply unfounded. Homosexuality need not de
stroy the heterosexual family unit. Are we so rigid that
the thought of variety in familial structure frightens us
so? Homosexuality, in truth, is a viable alternative
which need not frighten or interfere with the lifes
tyles of others. It is merely an issue of individual
preference, the expression of which is guaranteed by
our Constitution.
The aforementioned fears and assumptions are
ones which, in the broadest sense, underlie the
Briggs Initiative; namely, fears of homosexuality's
implications for society in general. But even specifi
cally, with regards to the immediate issue of
homosexual teachers, the initiative bases its argu
ments on fear.
Proposition 6 uses the heavily charged "Save Our
Children" theme in its crusade. This appeal is not to
the rational logic of the voters but rather to their
emotions and societally-imbued fears. Pro-Briggs lit
erature holds the spectre of homosexual child moles
tation over the heads of its readers, despite
documented evidence that the overwhelming major
ity of child molesters are heterosexual. Proponents
prefer to transcend the facts, appealing instead to the
nurturant softness in our hearts for children, rallying
all to their cause of protecting the innocents, brand
ing as callous all who do not respond.
The initiative also appeals to the parents' fear of
loss of influence over their children. The assumption
is that homosexual teachers will influence children
and favorably dispose them toward a homosexual
lifestyle. There are several flaws in this logic. One is
that homosexuality is not something imitated on a
whim because, perchance, it is presented favorably.
It is not something a child "tries" because a teacher
expressed sympathy for it. Secondly, by the time a
child enters school, he or she is very well instilled
with parental values.
Can a teacher, with whom the child spends a li
mited amount of time, really dictate a child's values
more influentially than a parent, with whom the child
grows up?
The comparative roles of parent and teacher as
moral educators are being distorted by the "Save Our
Children" claims. Closely linked with these claims is
the role of public schools in morally educating chil
dren. If parents want their children imbued with cer
tain values, it is their responsibility to do so.
Teaching a child values, however, is different than
shielding him or her from any other point of view.
This overprotective sheltering only breeds ignor
ance, the very thing schools try to eliminate. A broad
exposure to many sets of values is an essential pre
requisite for a well-rounded, informed and sensitive
existence.
The Briggs Initiative, in attempting to narrow the
spectrum of views presented in public schools to the
largely fundamentalist-Christian set of values, viol
ates the crucial separation of church and state. The
classroom should not be a pulpit from which the
gospel is uttered. Again, a child's moral leanings are
the parent's responsibility. The religious or moral
values implicated in the Briggs Initiative are not held
by all; thus the teaching of these ideas to the exclu
sion of all others is unjustifiable in public schools.
The Briggs Initiative betrays, above all else, fearand
misconceptions concerning homosexuality. It is not a
black spectre haunting American society, it will not
"take over" by way of the classroom. Rather,
homosexuality is a variation, a viable choice, a differ
ence which need not intimidate, influence, or inter
fere with the lives of students. Variety expands our
experience, our sensitivity and tolerance. Ignorance
serves only to limit our lives; knowlege to broaden
them.
