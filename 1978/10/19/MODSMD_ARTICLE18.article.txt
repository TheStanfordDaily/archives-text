Stadium seating
Anyone arriving at the stadium
an hour before kick-off is well
aware of expanses of empty seats
being effectively cordoned by
representatives of various living
groups. At the recent Stanford-
Washington game I arrived at ap
proximately 12:30 and found
nearly 20 rows of 35-to-50 yardline
seats being jealously guarded by a
handful of people.
Courtesy and common sense
dictate that the saver-saved seat
ratio should not be much more
than one-to-one. If one wishes to

be picayune about the whole mat
ter, the Athletic Department pol
icy of "First come; first served"
means no seat-saving at all. How
ever, the enjoyment that comes
from watching a football game
with friends makes strict adher
ence to that rule undesirable.
Nevertheless, the saving of
seats in big blocks by small num
bers is clearly outside the bound
aries of common sense and cour
tesy. Living groups can remedy
this problem by delegating seat
saving responsibilities to more
people.
However, if block-saving per

sists the unattached football fan
does have a recourse. Block
saving is clearly contrary to Athle
tic Department policy. The sec
urity people have been informed
of this policy and can lend assis
tance. The more intrepid may de
sire to simply sit down in these
gaps of peopleless bleachers. If
representatives of these living
groups wish to defy courtesy,
common sense and regulation
with verbal or physical intimida
tion, then they are clearly walking
on shaky ground.
