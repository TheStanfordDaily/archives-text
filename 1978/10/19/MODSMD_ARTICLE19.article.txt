## Initiation for Stanford men? 
### 
Has the woman's movement died in light of a full
moon? Ladies, where are your protests? Have you
again let tradition dictate your lives?
The tradition of "Stanford Women'' has again
struck this week leaving thousands of women at
the hands of the Stanford men. But wait a minute,
Stanford man? What's a Stanford man? As tradition
has it, any senior of the 60 percent majority on
campus is a Stanford man capable of assisting our
Stanford girls in their quest for womanhood. Yet in
our times of scrutiny and reevaluation of our pa
rents' traditions, this seems too simple and all
together inadequate.
Women, do you realize that any male of four
years standing possesses these select powers.
Frankly, the quality control is abhorrent.
Would you care to share Stanford womanhood
status with someone who touched lips with a Stan
ford man who simultaneously picked his beard
and punched in his latest program on his TI-59? I
should think not. Stanford upforyour rights now!
We need to make changes in this age-old cus
tom. No longer shall simply putting in four years
delegate men to the ranks of those able to practice
the magic of midnight, moon and Quad. There
needs to be a testing ground, shall we call it an
apprenticeship.
Under my plan, any boy who aspired to reach
the ranks of manhood would need the consent of a
Stanford woman . . . complete with midnight,
moon and Quad. Understand that she need not be
a senior; her only qualification shall be her Stan
ford womanhood. Such a boy would then enter an
apprenticeship lasting until the eve of the Autumn
of his senior year when he would inherit all ti

ties, powers and responsibilities due him by tradi
tion.
Women, think of the advantages! First, you
could feel certain that the man to make you a
woman would know what he was doing. In addi
tion to simply being familiar and comfortable in
these rare circumstances, he would have the ad
vice and knowledge passed on to him by a woman
of rank. No longer will you have no control and be
put at the whim and mercy of a Stanford senior.
You will know that all Stanford men are qualified
and previously approved.
But wouldn't this put an undesirable crimp on
the number of available Stanford men and there
fore cheat numbers of women of their deserved
right? No. First Stanford males outnumber Stan
ford females by about three to two, thus giving
women an initial edge.
Second, since any Stanford woman, regardless
of class, could bring a boy to apprenticeship, the
opportunity will be selective while not stifling.
After all, many Stanford men of today would have
taken advantage of these opportunities had my
plan prevailed in past years.
And think of your brothers. Now they too could
partake in all four of their Stanford years. Until my
plan takes effect, three-fourths of the male popu
lation and male talent shall go unused and wasted.
And finally, my plan gives real meaning and pur
pose to a Stanford woman's life. She will have
important responsibilities and not simply passive
roles. And after all women, isn't that what it's all
about?

apprenticeship lasting until the eve of the Autumn
of his senior year when he would inherit all ti

ties, powers and responsibilities due him by tradi
tion.
Women, think of the advantages! First, you
could feel certain that the man to make you a
woman would know what he was doing. In addi
tion to simply being familiar and comfortable in
these rare circumstances, he would have the ad
vice and knowledge passed on to him by a woman
of rank. No longer will you have no control and be
put at the whim and mercy of a Stanford senior.
You will know that all Stanford men are qualified
and previously approved.
But wouldn't this put an undesirable crimp on
the number of available Stanford men and there
fore cheat numbers of women of their deserved
right? No. First Stanford males outnumber Stan
ford females by about three to two, thus giving
women an initial edge.
Second, since any Stanford woman, regardless
of class, could bring a boy to apprenticeship, the
opportunity will be selective while not stifling.
After all, many Stanford men of today would have
taken advantage of these opportunities had my
plan prevailed in past years.
And think of your brothers. Now they too could
partake in all four of their Stanford years. Until my
plan takes effect, three-fourths of the male popu
lation and male talent shall go unused and wasted.
And finally, my plan gives real meaning and pur
pose to a Stanford woman's life. She will have
important responsibilities and not simply passive
roles. And after all women, isn't that what it's all
about?

Has the woman's movement died in light of a full
moon? Ladies, where are your protests? Have you
again let tradition dictate your lives?
The tradition of "Stanford Women'' has again
struck this week leaving thousands of women at
the hands of the Stanford men. But wait a minute,
Stanford man? What's a Stanford man? As tradition
has it, any senior of the 60 percent majority on
campus is a Stanford man capable of assisting our
Stanford girls in their quest for womanhood. Yet in
our times of scrutiny and reevaluation of our pa
rents' traditions, this seems too simple and all
together inadequate.
Women, do you realize that any male of four
years standing possesses these select powers.
Frankly, the quality control is abhorrent.
Would you care to share Stanford womanhood
status with someone who touched lips with a Stan
ford man who simultaneously picked his beard
and punched in his latest program on his TI-59? I
should think not. Stanford upforyour rights now!
We need to make changes in this age-old cus
tom. No longer shall simply putting in four years
delegate men to the ranks of those able to practice
the magic of midnight, moon and Quad. There
needs to be a testing ground, shall we call it an
apprenticeship.
Under my plan, any boy who aspired to reach
the ranks of manhood would need the consent of a
Stanford woman . . . complete with midnight,
moon and Quad. Understand that she need not be
a senior; her only qualification shall be her Stan
ford womanhood. Such a boy would then enter an
apprenticeship lasting until the eve of the Autumn
of his senior year when he would inherit all ti

ties, powers and responsibilities due him by tradi
tion.
