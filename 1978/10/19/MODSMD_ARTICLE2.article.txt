# Overseas plan awaits approval
## University may head Brazilian program 
### BEN POLLOCK 
If 11 other universities agree, Stan
ford next year will head a program
enabling 25 students from across the
country to have a year of study at the
University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.
Corb Smith, assistant director of
Stanford Overseas Studies, said the
University is planning to take over
the program, which has been run
"for years" by the University of In
diana.
Smith said Indiana will not sponsor
the Brazil program after this year be
cause it could not attract enough
students.
Both Stanford and the University
of California system wanted the
program to continue, but with a
stronger financial structure, he said.
"We're at the point where money is
tight enough that for us to go it alone
would be difficult," he added.
Smith said all 12 schools will pay
for the program in proportion to the
number of students they are allowed
to send. He said if a school cannot
find enough eligible, interested stu
dents, it still will be financially obli
gated to pay part of the program

costs. He added Stanford will be able
to send two students.
Smith said none of the schools,
which include )ohns Hopkins, Wis
consin and Illinois universities, have
agreed yet to the financial obligation
of the "International Study Program
in Brazil." He said he expects the
schools to answer by Christmas, and
if approved, the program will begin
in mid-lune of 1979.
History Prof. John Wirth, director
of Latin American Studies here, said
he is "cautiously optimistic" that all
of the schools interested in the prog
ram's continuation will support its
revised form.
Wirth said that while a nationwide
coordinating committee, which he
will chair, will set the policy for the
Brazil program, Stanford will ad
minister it on a day-to-day basis.
"Stanford, with its long experience
of running overseas programs, is
well equipped to manage the de
velopment of a study program at the
University of Sao Paulo."
Smith said interested students will
be required to have studied at least
two years of Portuguese or two years

of Spanish with a summer of inten
sive study in Portuguese.
He added only students of junior
standing or above are eligible, be
cause they must be of a comparable
age to the Brazilians, who begin col
lege after 14 years of public school.
Smith said the Sao Paulo program
lasts a little more than a year. He said
students will live for the first six
weeks with Brazilian families in San
tos, "a nearby coffee port," after

which they will live for a month with
families in Sao Paulo. The Americans
m\jst locate their housing for the re
maining time.
Smith said students will pay regu
lar tuition to their own universities,
but are personally responsible for
their transportation and living ex
penses.
He said the students will enroll in
the University of Sao Paulo and take
ing the University while her husband
is studying here for a year, said that
any German who speaks out against
the constitution and works for the
Civil Service, loses his or her job.
"Educators of 20 years have been
fired because someone told the gov
ernment that they opposed certain
aspects of the government constitu
tion," she added.
"The West German government
says that this is a way of fighting the
terrorists, but, " Jennes said, "it's a
breakdown in liberal rights."
Another member of the audience
likened the Berufsverbote policy to
McCarthyism.
hi response, Gresmann said he
didn't see the Berufsverbote lasting
more than another year. He added
that the "right-wing" (which does
not include the Christian Democrats,
whom he described as just "right of
center") was small, though militant.
"Because they go around painting
swastikas, they give the impression
that there is a widespread Nazi re
newal within West Germany,"
Gresmann said. He cited the recent
state elections that gave a .4 percent
vote of support to communist or Nazi
groups and said the communist stu
dent groups in West Germany were
equally "insignificant" because they

were such a "minority."
Turning away from politics, Gres
mann said Germany's economic sta
bility is "willing to challenge the
French agriculture and American ex
ports."
West German exports make up 27
percent of their gross national pro
duct. Over half of their exports go to
other European countries. Gres
mann said there is a growing reluc
tance to accept permanent U.S.
dominance of the European
economy.
Sources of friction between West
Germany and the United States in
clude the role of the American dollar
in German economics, Gresmann
said.
"Germany is no longer the rich,
uncomplaining client state that she
was considered to be during the '50s
and '605," he said. Gresmann added
that though there is tension between
the two governments on economic
questions, their ties "remain good."
Regarding West German foreign
policy, Gresmann said that as a
natural consequence of Germany's
"tremendous economic power," she
automatically leads Europe in foreign
aid.
He added that he saw "no danger
of Germany aiming for some past go
als" that power had led her to.

that the "right-wing" (which does

"Because they go around painting
swastikas, they give the impression
that there is a widespread Nazi re

Gresmann said. He cited the recent
state elections that gave a .4 percent
vote of support to communist or Nazi
groups and said the communist stu

equally "insignificant" because they

were such a "minority."
Turning away from politics, Gres

West German exports make up 27
percent of their gross national pro

other European countries. Gres

"Germany is no longer the rich,
uncomplaining client state that she
was considered to be during the '50s
and '605," he said. Gresmann added
that though there is tension between
the two governments on economic
questions, their ties "remain good."
Regarding West German foreign
policy, Gresmann said that as a
natural consequence of Germany's
"tremendous economic power," she
automatically leads Europe in foreign
aid.
He added that he saw "no danger
of Germany aiming for some past go
als" that power had led her to.
If 11 other universities agree, Stan
ford next year will head a program
enabling 25 students from across the
country to have a year of study at the
University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.
Corb Smith, assistant director of
Stanford Overseas Studies, said the
University is planning to take over
the program, which has been run
"for years" by the University of In
diana.
Smith said Indiana will not sponsor
the Brazil program after this year be
cause it could not attract enough
students.
Both Stanford and the University
of California system wanted the
program to continue, but with a
stronger financial structure, he said.
"We're at the point where money is
tight enough that for us to go it alone
would be difficult," he added.
Smith said all 12 schools will pay
for the program in proportion to the
number of students they are allowed
to send. He said if a school cannot
find enough eligible, interested stu
dents, it still will be financially obli
gated to pay part of the program

costs. He added Stanford will be able
to send two students.
Smith said none of the schools,
which include )ohns Hopkins, Wis
consin and Illinois universities, have
agreed yet to the financial obligation
of the "International Study Program
in Brazil." He said he expects the
schools to answer by Christmas, and
if approved, the program will begin
in mid-lune of 1979.
History Prof. John Wirth, director
of Latin American Studies here, said
he is "cautiously optimistic" that all
of the schools interested in the prog
ram's continuation will support its
revised form.
Wirth said that while a nationwide
coordinating committee, which he
will chair, will set the policy for the
Brazil program, Stanford will ad
minister it on a day-to-day basis.
"Stanford, with its long experience
of running overseas programs, is
well equipped to manage the de
velopment of a study program at the
University of Sao Paulo."
Smith said interested students will
be required to have studied at least
two years of Portuguese or two years

of Spanish with a summer of inten
sive study in Portuguese.
He added only students of junior
standing or above are eligible, be
cause they must be of a comparable
age to the Brazilians, who begin col
lege after 14 years of public school.
Smith said the Sao Paulo program
lasts a little more than a year. He said
students will live for the first six
weeks with Brazilian families in San
tos, "a nearby coffee port," after

which they will live for a month with
families in Sao Paulo. The Americans
m\jst locate their housing for the re
maining time.
Smith said students will pay regu
lar tuition to their own universities,
but are personally responsible for
their transportation and living ex
penses.
He said the students will enroll in
the University of Sao Paulo and take
ing the University while her husband
is studying here for a year, said that
any German who speaks out against
the constitution and works for the
Civil Service, loses his or her job.
"Educators of 20 years have been
fired because someone told the gov
ernment that they opposed certain
aspects of the government constitu
tion," she added.
"The West German government
says that this is a way of fighting the
terrorists, but, " Jennes said, "it's a
breakdown in liberal rights."
Another member of the audience
likened the Berufsverbote policy to
McCarthyism.
