## Rent relief measure 'disastrous' 
### 
Stanford students will have the opportunity in November to
vote on the seductive panacea of rent control. The product of
frustrated and ill-informed people intent on ignoring economic
reality, Measure H could devastate the housing market for years
to come.
Measure H, which will appear on the November 7 ballot in Palo
Alto, provides that each month's rent in 1979 will be reduced by
the tenant's pro-rated share of the landlord's property tax sav
ings. Rents could not be raised except for increased operating
costs, capital improvements or "hardship."
This measure, and the proposals similar to it throughout
California, are economically disastrous overreactions to a small
number of well-publicized rent increases. In fact, during June,
July and August, rent increases were no different than those
during the previous year; the number of units receiving increases
during the current quarter has dropped substantially since then.
Furthermore, many landowners were uncertain whether the
tax cut would survive court challenge (which it only recently did),
and did not know how much in taxes they would be saving.
Finally, many landlords have frozen rents in the face of rising
costs, thus passing along the tax cut.

This is not to say that renters do not deserve tax relief — they
most certainly do. However, rent control is totally unwarranted
and counterproductive. Renters should instead focus on the
legislature and seek the passage of increased tax credits for re
nters. An increase in the renter tax credit hits the real villain —an
insatiable and rapacious government —has none of the damaging
effects of rent control, and efficiently gets hard cash in the hands
of deserving tenants.
On the other hand, Measure H is not a rational solution.
Though labeled "rent relief," it puts the government in the posi
tion of determining when rents are reasonable. The only way to
force a "tax rebate" is to control rents; Measure H is, quite
simply, rent control.
Measure H is also labeled "temporary." However, rent control
is simply never temporary. When a year passes, cries will go up
for another year, and another year, and so on. The threat of
increased rents will still be there; Measure H will lead \operma
nent rent control, with all of its deleterious consequences.
Rent control should be opposed for a number of reasons, by
landlord and tenant alike. First, it is terribly inconsistent and
inequitable. Why should only landlords be forced to pass on their
savings? How about the grocery store, the gas station, and the TV
repairman? And everyone else? Thus landlords — many of whom
have zero to negative cash flows — arealone expected to give tax
rebates while facing rising costs.
Second, rent control, unlike renter tax credits, is an economic
catastrophe, and is expensive to administer (even if by an already
over-burdened court system, as proposed by Measure H.) The

costs of administration would be better distributed to needy
tenants.
Another effect, which should be of major concern to Stanford
students, is the stultifying effect on personal mobility and the
turnover of units. Because rents are normally allowed to rise
when vacancies occur, tenants have an artificial incentive to hold
on to their units for as long as possible.
With rent control, full-year residents would swiftly absorb the
best spaces, leaving returning students to find a local bridge to
sleep under. The impediment to mobility would also guarantee
apartments to those who don't need them (the poor tend to have
the highest turnover rates), and would grossly misallocate hous
ing space (growing or shrinking families would retain their quar
ters because of its controlled rent).
Further, rent control has a deleterious effect on the mainte
nance and repair of housing. This effect is exacerbated when the
buildings in question are older, wooden homes which need
continuous maintenance; these homes comprise a valuable cul
tural heritage, and many would suffer irreversible decay (or be
torn down) under rent control.
Finally, the most pernicious, and long-term, effect of rent con
trol is its disruptive effect on the supply of housing. Rent control
creates and intensifies housing shortages by discouraging in
vestment, and by encouraging the conversion of rental units and
the abandonment of unprofitable ones.
Tenants deserve tax relief, but that relief should come through
direct tax credits for renters. Measure H is a prescription for
disaster.
