## SCOPE sponsors speeches, films 
### ANNE BOWDEN 
"Scope has begun to mean more than just a
mouthwash," junior Mark Antweil, co-director of the
Stanford Committee on Political Education (SCOPE),
said. SCOPE is one of many groups here that attempts
to raise the political consciousness of University stu
dents. SCOPE is non-partisan.
The focus of SCOPE'S work involves bringing
politicians and public figures here to speak on cur
rent political issues, Antweil said. Sometimes SCOPE
also brings movies of "a political nature" to campus,
he added.
"We are trying to bring speakers from both sides of
the California state election," junior Peter Stamos,
another co-director of SCOPE, said.
SCOPE has also invited every U.S. senator and
some U.S. representatives to speak here. This year,
SCOPE sponsored Bud Arnold's trip to the University.
Arnold spoke on the relationship between politics
and the media. Kathleen Brown Rice, Gov. Jerry
Brown's sister, addressed a crowd at White Plaza last

week as another SCOPE activity.
Last night, Colo. Sen. Gary Hart spoke on "The
National Security Case for SALT." Hart also hosted an
informal seminar about the state of American politics
now before his address.
Actress Jane Fonda is also scheduled to visit the
University. Both SCOPE and the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau will sponsor her visit. Fonda will speak about
the "Post-Proposition 13 Economy in California." She
will speak at noon, Oct. 26 in White Plaza. That after
noon Fonda will attend an informal seminar in Cedro
house of Wilbur Hall to discuss her perceptions of
political activism in the '60s and '70s.
On Nov. 2, Rep. Pete McCloskey will formally de
bate Kirsten Olsen who is challenging McCloskey in
the upcoming November election for the seat in the
12th Congressional District. The two will debate the
question "Should the draft be reinstated?" A panel of
students and faculty will host the debate.
Other possibilities for speakers in the near future
include lowa Sen. John Culver, Del. Sen. Joseph

Biden and 111. Rep. Philip Crane.
"We can't give too many details now. It's just too
tentative, but there is a strong possibility of getting
some Cabinet or vice presidential level people here,
too," junior Alex Alben, another co-director, said.
SCOPE will sponsor a showing of the film, Missiles
of October soon after the Nov. 7 election.
Currently, SCOPE members are focusing activity
on informing students about the election. On Nov. 2,
SCOPE will co-sponsor an election fair with Univer

mouthwash," junior Mark Antweil, co-director of the
Stanford Committee on Political Education (SCOPE),
said. SCOPE is one of many groups here that attempts
to raise the political consciousness of University stu
dents. SCOPE is non-partisan.
The focus of SCOPE'S work involves bringing
politicians and public figures here to speak on cur
rent political issues, Antweil said. Sometimes SCOPE
also brings movies of "a political nature" to campus,
he added.
"We are trying to bring speakers from both sides of
the California state election," junior Peter Stamos,
another co-director of SCOPE, said.
SCOPE has also invited every U.S. senator and
some U.S. representatives to speak here. This year,
SCOPE sponsored Bud Arnold's trip to the University.
Arnold spoke on the relationship between politics
and the media. Kathleen Brown Rice, Gov. Jerry
Brown's sister, addressed a crowd at White Plaza last

week as another SCOPE activity.
Last night, Colo. Sen. Gary Hart spoke on "The
National Security Case for SALT." Hart also hosted an
informal seminar about the state of American politics
now before his address.
Actress Jane Fonda is also scheduled to visit the
University. Both SCOPE and the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau will sponsor her visit. Fonda will speak about
the "Post-Proposition 13 Economy in California." She
will speak at noon, Oct. 26 in White Plaza. That after
noon Fonda will attend an informal seminar in Cedro
house of Wilbur Hall to discuss her perceptions of
political activism in the '60s and '70s.
On Nov. 2, Rep. Pete McCloskey will formally de
bate Kirsten Olsen who is challenging McCloskey in
the upcoming November election for the seat in the
12th Congressional District. The two will debate the
question "Should the draft be reinstated?" A panel of
students and faculty will host the debate.
Other possibilities for speakers in the near future
include lowa Sen. John Culver, Del. Sen. Joseph

Biden and 111. Rep. Philip Crane.
"We can't give too many details now. It's just too
tentative, but there is a strong possibility of getting
some Cabinet or vice presidential level people here,
too," junior Alex Alben, another co-director, said.
SCOPE will sponsor a showing of the film, Missiles
of October soon after the Nov. 7 election.
Currently, SCOPE members are focusing activity
on informing students about the election. On Nov. 2,
SCOPE will co-sponsor an election fair with Univer
sity Democrat and Republican groups. Tables will be
set up and manned with students distributing infor
mation on candidates for national, state and local
elections.
Last year, SCOPE sponsored the visit of
Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee. In
conjunction with Bradlee's visit, the film All The Pres
ident's Men was shown free of charge to University
students and staff.
Membership in SCOPE is open to all University
students.
