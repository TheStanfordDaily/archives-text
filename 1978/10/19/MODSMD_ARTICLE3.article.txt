# NASA heli-blimps: the newest airships?

Have you been wondering what
the next disaster film will be like?
How about a 1200-foot dirigible, car
rying half of a power station, going
out of control over San lose?
Tidal waves and flaming buildings
may be believable as disaster film to
pics, but a bunch of balloons towing
around 900-ton power stations
seems impossible. Some NASA re
searchers disagree.
NASA's Ames Research Center is
studying the feasibility of lighter
than-air vehicles in industrial and
commerical service.
Last year four Navy helicopters and
one dirigible or "bag" from Moffett
Field lifted 176,000 lbs (88 tons), prov
ing that a combination dirigible and
helicopter could do a lot of work.
Modern helicopters alone cannot
lift more than 20 tons
The proposed lighter-than-air veh
icles will combine a number of
helicopter engines and one bag big
enough to offset the weight of the
engines. Even though the heli-blimp
will have a mass equal to 25 tons,
effective weight after the bag is filled
with air will be zero.
Heli-blimps could be used in in
dustry in a variety of ways. NASA re
searchers have projected plans for
dirigibles used as huge cranes in log
ging and construction jobs. They
would be called Heavy Lifting Air
ships (HLAs). According to NASA re
searchers, the logging industry could
employ from 700 to 2000 dirigibles
lifting Douglas firs weighing an aver
age of 14 tons each.

erage of 14 tons each.
NASA studies indicate the approx
imate size of a logging heli-blimp
would be 325 feet long, 60 feet in
diameter, and contain a volume of
one million cubic feet of helium. It
would lift approximately 25 tons. This
is larger than the Goodyear blimp,
which only stretches 200 feet and
contains 200,000 cubic feet of gas.
Even larger HLAs are being consi
dered by NASA researchers for elec
tric power plant construction. Ac
cording to Larry King, a NASA re
searcher, lifters with a payload of 180
to 900 tons are feasible. The largest
blimp ever built was the USS Macon
(785 ft.) which went down in 1935 of
Point Sur.
There are other applications for
heli-blimps. Smaller passenger air
ships could feed airports much like
some helicopter services do now,
according to NASA research.
Dirigibles designed for long
periods of occupation are also being
considered in special applications,
such as convoy escorts, anti
submarine duties and government
atmosphere testing.
Heli-blimps offer some advantages
over conventional helicopters, King
said. Heli-blimps would not require
airports and conceivably could be
moored at the job site. The heli
blimps might also be put to military
use. Because many modern aiming
devices zero in on jet exhausts,
heli-blimps would be capable of "si
lent running" by turning off their en
gines.
