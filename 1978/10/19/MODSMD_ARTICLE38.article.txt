## theater/thomas harold Something happened to Keach's 'Cyrano' 
### 
Bad criticism is easy when a play misses
the mark. Theater critics often fall into a
pass-fail, laundry-list mentality in which the
scenery and staging is either good or bad,
and the actors and interpretations either
successful or inneffective — the result is that
many such plays get judged as if they were
cheerleading tryouts. A critic runs down his
list, giving marks in each of the categories,
and then he adds it up and issues forth an
organized little printout. "This was a 10 and
that was a 6 and that was a 3.5," they say — "it
adds up to 19.5, which means that the play
was fairly bad." Or very bad. When some
thing goes wrong a critic feels bound to trace
things back to an easily identifiable "mis
take," preferably one that fits neatly into a
predetermined category.
It even works, sometimes, when say, a
single actor is either tremendous or rotten.
But often it doesn't. Some plays are perfectly
balanced, with no apparant seams, yet
though everything in them deserves some
praise they somehow just don't cut it. It has
to do with the intricate interaction between

everything involved in a production, and
explanations require the use of nebulous
words like "atmosphere," or "depth."
The Long Beach Theater Production of
"Cyrano de Bergerac" at Berkeley's Zeller
bach Auditorium is a case in point. This was a
play in which the acting, and staging were
deserving of much praise, yet it also was a
play that remained in the end strangely un
satisfying. It lacked atmosphere. And depth.
But the temptation is to be specific. Is Zel
lerbach Auditorium simply too big to allow
such a play to take root? Was Stephanie
Powers' shallow Roxanne to blame for the
lapses on the stage? And Rostand's play —
not nearly as good at the end as at the begin
ning — was the play itself to blame for the
lack of dramatic power?
I'm not sure. I don't think so. "Cyrano" is
by nature a broad play, one that ought to be
capable of filling all but the truest of acoustic
holes. It is essentially a one-man show, as
well, which means that a good male lead
ought to be able to carry (or even profit
from) a cast that is for the most part merely

adequate. And this production had a very
good male lead. Stacy Keach plays Cyrano
with tremendous energy, and a very fast
mouth, and a command of the play's lan
guage that puts the fast mouth to good ef
fect. An actor who can raise armies in a role
asking him to do just that — it should follow
that Keach was the one to bring the house
down.
But something happened. He didn't do it.
Even the most powerful of Cyranos need to
interact with those on stage around them if
they are to succeed, and in this production
that kind of sustained relationship simply
didn't develop.
There are inspired moments, however,
and most of them are Keach's doing. When
forced to delay his military superior until
Cyrano's true love is married off to some
body else Keach disguises himself quite ef
fectively by sticking some underbrush over
his head and going temporarily (and hilari
ously) insane.
But these moments pass. And when Keach

attempts to give the play dramatic substance
he is not nearly as successful. This "Cyrano"
is frequently entertaining, and often very
funny, but those kinds of comments almost
always have a dark side — in this case it
means that the play is rarely more than en
tertaining, or amusing. We never quite feel
for Cyrano in the way that we were meant to,
as we are never quite able to see Keach's
performance as more than a performance.
Again, it's not that he isn't capable of such
acting. Sometimes we have trouble with this
Cyrano because it is difficult to understand
his reaction to this particular Roxanne; at
other times it appears that Keach is bur
dened by awkward, overstated blocking. For
the most part, though, the problem with this
play grows out of the difficulty the perfor
mers have in feeding off of each other, of
reacting to each other in such a way as to
give a production life. And depth.
And we're back where we started. Plays
sometimes falter for relatively intangible
reasons. "Cyrano" at Zellerbach is a very
good example.
