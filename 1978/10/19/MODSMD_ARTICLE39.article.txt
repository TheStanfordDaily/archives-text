## 'Autumn Sonata' Bergman and Ullmann roar 
### 
When you first see Ingrid
Bergman and Liv Ullmann to
gether in Ingmar Bergman's
new movie, Autumn Sonata,
you think of how inspired this
pairing is, just physically.
Bergman's features are
sharper now, and it gives her
acting a hard edge. But when
she lets her face soften and
glow, the effect is still stun
ning. It's like being thrown
back 30 years and not feeling
uncomfortable about it.
Ullmann, as she's made-up
here, provides an understated
contrast; her face is hidden by
long hair and glasses — she's
supposed to look dowdy. But
Ullmann's eyes cut through all
this, and they burn with a
frightening intensity.
Half-strength
For director Ingmar
Bergman, Autumn Sonata rep
resents a different kind of vic
tory: a victory of personal
strength, even if it is only half
strength.
Bergman's bitter departure
from his native Sweden three
years ago led to a pronounced
regression in his work. This
became disturbingly evident in
last year's disastrous The Ser
pent's Egg.
But now he is on the way
back. Bergman has never
seemed so sure of his actors
before, and his editing and
camerawork are marked by
their clarity and sense of confi
dence. Where Bergman seems
unsure, not at full strength, is
in his writing.
Autumn Sonata is stripped
down Bergman (ybu ap
preciate that most of the way).
A lot of the vagueness and
symbolism of his past work is
absent here. The film examines
a parent-child relationship at
the point where the parent be
gins to need her child in new
and important ways.
Familiar
Very quickly, you realize that
all this is territory that has been
explored before — by Bergman

himself and (though in slightly
different ways) by playwrights
like Eugene O'Neill. We know
where the movie is going much
of the time; its complexities
have largely been worked out
before.
To further the comparison to
O'Neill, Autumn Sonata is set
out like a play, and its themes

are the need for love and the
often crippling effects that the
absence of love can have.
Ingrid Bergman's character
is only happy in her career as a
concert pianist. As her children
grew up, she found herself un
able to love them, and she be
came even more deeply in
volved in her work.
Liv Ullmann plays the
grown-up daughter whom
Bergman visits after the death
of Bergman's long-time friend
Leonardo. Married to a cler
gyman and living a quiet life in
Norway, Ullmann has not seen
her mother in seven years. She
spends her days taking care of
her mentally ill sister and
brooding about her childhood.
In keeping with the film's
central metaphor (Chopin's
Prelude No. 2 in A), Ullman's
resentment is repressed in the
film's opening act, as she tries
gamely to preserve a happy
face for her mother. But as the
movie unfolds, her bitterness
explodes, as in the prelude,
into a sudden, pain-consumed
wail.
Ullmann rips mercilessly
into her mother, smashing her
illusions about herself and her
children. In theend,thereisan
unhappy peace between them.

And it is in Autumn Sonata's
second half that the intensity of
the acting throws you, almost
silently, right into the movie.
While there isn't real heat in
the dialogue itself, there is in
the two actresses. It's all con
tained in little actors' bits;
glances, silent exchanges. And
director Bergman's unobtru-

sive editing and restrictive set
tings heighten the tension.
But the language really never
does justice to either the per
formances or to Bergman's
visual conception. I should
point out that with foreign
films, it is often hard to tell
whether the translation or the
original script is at fault for
poorly written subtitles. But in
any case, directness should
never be replaced by obvious
ness, and it sometimes is here.
Lines like "a child must suffer
for the sins of her mother"
makes this all too clear.
You want the movie to do so
much more, and because of
this, Autumn Sonata can often
be a frustrating movie experi
ence. But it is frustration that
is, finally, erased by joy. Even if
Ingmar Bergman is not yet
ready to go all the way with a
movie again, his actresses are,
and they take the film right to
the limit.
Bergman and Ullmann roar
through Autumn Sonata like
two great ladies of the theatre
who haven't lost their zest.
While watching them, even for
a short period, perhaps 30 mi
nutes, you forget that you're at
the movies; the magical part is
that you never even care.

O'Neill, Autumn Sonata is set
out like a play, and its themes

are the need for love and the
often crippling effects that the
absence of love can have.
Ingrid Bergman's character
is only happy in her career as a
concert pianist. As her children
grew up, she found herself un
able to love them, and she be
came even more deeply in
volved in her work.
Liv Ullmann plays the
grown-up daughter whom
Bergman visits after the death
of Bergman's long-time friend
Leonardo. Married to a cler
gyman and living a quiet life in
Norway, Ullmann has not seen
her mother in seven years. She
spends her days taking care of
her mentally ill sister and
brooding about her childhood.
In keeping with the film's
central metaphor (Chopin's
Prelude No. 2 in A), Ullman's
resentment is repressed in the
film's opening act, as she tries
gamely to preserve a happy
face for her mother. But as the
movie unfolds, her bitterness
explodes, as in the prelude,
into a sudden, pain-consumed
wail.
Ullmann rips mercilessly
into her mother, smashing her
illusions about herself and her
children. In theend,thereisan
unhappy peace between them.

And it is in Autumn Sonata's
second half that the intensity of
the acting throws you, almost
silently, right into the movie.
While there isn't real heat in
the dialogue itself, there is in
the two actresses. It's all con
tained in little actors' bits;
glances, silent exchanges. And
director Bergman's unobtru-

sive editing and restrictive set
tings heighten the tension.
But the language really never
does justice to either the per
formances or to Bergman's
visual conception. I should
point out that with foreign
films, it is often hard to tell
whether the translation or the
original script is at fault for
poorly written subtitles. But in
any case, directness should
never be replaced by obvious
ness, and it sometimes is here.
Lines like "a child must suffer
for the sins of her mother"
makes this all too clear.
You want the movie to do so
much more, and because of
this, Autumn Sonata can often
be a frustrating movie experi
ence. But it is frustration that
is, finally, erased by joy. Even if
Ingmar Bergman is not yet
ready to go all the way with a
movie again, his actresses are,
and they take the film right to
the limit.
Bergman and Ullmann roar
through Autumn Sonata like
two great ladies of the theatre
who haven't lost their zest.
While watching them, even for
a short period, perhaps 30 mi
nutes, you forget that you're at
the movies; the magical part is
that you never even care.


Ingmar Bergman directs Ingrid Bergman in Autumn Sonata.
When you first see Ingrid
Bergman and Liv Ullmann to
gether in Ingmar Bergman's
new movie, Autumn Sonata,
you think of how inspired this
pairing is, just physically.
Bergman's features are
sharper now, and it gives her
acting a hard edge. But when
she lets her face soften and
glow, the effect is still stun
ning. It's like being thrown
back 30 years and not feeling
uncomfortable about it.
Ullmann, as she's made-up
here, provides an understated
contrast; her face is hidden by
long hair and glasses — she's
supposed to look dowdy. But
Ullmann's eyes cut through all
this, and they burn with a
frightening intensity.
Half-strength
For director Ingmar
Bergman, Autumn Sonata rep
resents a different kind of vic
tory: a victory of personal
strength, even if it is only half
strength.
Bergman's bitter departure
from his native Sweden three
years ago led to a pronounced
regression in his work. This
became disturbingly evident in
last year's disastrous The Ser
pent's Egg.
But now he is on the way
back. Bergman has never
seemed so sure of his actors
before, and his editing and
camerawork are marked by
their clarity and sense of confi
dence. Where Bergman seems
unsure, not at full strength, is
in his writing.
Autumn Sonata is stripped
down Bergman (ybu ap
preciate that most of the way).
A lot of the vagueness and
symbolism of his past work is
absent here. The film examines
a parent-child relationship at
the point where the parent be
gins to need her child in new
and important ways.
Familiar
Very quickly, you realize that
all this is territory that has been
explored before — by Bergman

himself and (though in slightly
different ways) by playwrights
like Eugene O'Neill. We know
where the movie is going much
of the time; its complexities
have largely been worked out
before.

for the sins of her mother"
makes this all too clear.
You want the movie to do so
much more, and because of
this, Autumn Sonata can often
be a frustrating movie experi
ence. But it is frustration that
is, finally, erased by joy. Even if
Ingmar Bergman is not yet
ready to go all the way with a
movie again, his actresses are,
and they take the film right to
the limit.
Bergman and Ullmann roar
through Autumn Sonata like
two great ladies of the theatre
who haven't lost their zest.
While watching them, even for
a short period, perhaps 30 mi
nutes, you forget that you're at
the movies; the magical part is
that you never even care.
