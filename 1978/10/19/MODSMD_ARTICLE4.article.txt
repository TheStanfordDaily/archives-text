# Hart believes SALT treaty at hand
## 
### KATHY ANDREWS SUSAN ESSOYAN 
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) said he
expects that a treaty concluding six
years of Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT II) will be formally signed
"sometime between Thanksgiving
and Christmas," although he con
ceded yesterday in a Daily interview
that ratification will "not be easy."
In a speech sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) before an audience of
about 150, Hart blamed differences
between the United States and the
Soviet Union for the delay.
"The difficulty in negotiation lies
in the fact that we are not negotiating
as equals," he said. "The Soviets are
ahead of us in some respects and we
are ahead of them in others," he
said.
Hart contrasted the American em
phasis on technological sophistica
tion with the Soviet emphasis on
what he called "brute strength," a
divergence on issues which makes
the negotiating process similar to
trading "apples for oranges."
Hart said he envisions further dif
ficulties in ratification of the emerg
ing treaty. The senator said he was
"disturbed by the intensity of criti
cism leveled at the talks by people
who should know better."
"You don't have to trust the
Soviets in order to support SALT II,"
because the proposed treaty would
not compromise American ability to
"know to a 'T' what the Soviets are
doing almost all the time," he said.
Without a SALT II treaty, "all bets
are off," he added, since nations

would be free to conceal military
capabilities and to interfere with an
opposing nation's military surveil
lance.
Hart said he feels it is "necessary to
convince the American public —
which he said has been largely ob
livious of SALT — that the treaty is in

America's national security interest.
The senator said he came to Stan
ford as part of a "broad-based educa
tional campaign" designed to "gen
erate student involvement and in
terest in the issue."
If sufficiently informed, "there is
no question in my mind which way
the majority of the American people
will come out."
Hart said he hopes to "energize"
students, perhaps leading to a na
tional campaign for ratification. Stu

dents have an obligation to be
"thoughtfully informed" on the is
sue, he continued.
Hart opposes linking SALT II to
other issues such as Soviet actions in
Africa and human rights problems.
"We should see the issue of arms
limitation as discrete and separate
from other political and moral prob
lems," he said.
National interest
Hart said there was no way to "di
vorce the SALT issue" from the
"general political mood" created by
Soviet actions. But SALT II should
"proceed on its own footing because
it is within our national interest," he
added.
Hart emphasized that he would
like to elevate SALT above other
everyday issues because of its "moral
implications."
"We should not only ask what is
the best thing for the country, but
what is the right thing to do," he said.
"It's hard to get people to realize
that arms limitation concerns the loss
of human life and the destruction of
civilization as we know it,"he con
tinued.

Hart said he felt it was necessary to
transcend political lines on the issue.
Partisan wrangling would be "ex
tremely divisive and destructive," he
said.
Both the Americans and Soviets
must take the lead in setting an
example refraining from nuclear pro
liferation, Hart said.
"We are going to have to step back
before we can convince others to do
so," he said.
The question of whether technol
ogy is outrunning diplomacy poses a
real problem, according to Hart.
"While we are limiting our nuclear
capabilities, we still continue to
modernize them," he explained.
Hart also said the loss of one-tenth
of the Soviet population during
World War II has had a profound in
fluence on the Russian attitudes to
ward diplomacy. As the years pass,
World War II leaders are often re
placed by younger technocrats, who
do not remember the war. Thus the
issue becomes "so abstract, techni
cal and scientific" that people tend to
loose their overwhelming sense of
the impact of nuclear war, Hart ad
ded.

Hart opposes linking SALT II to
other issues such as Soviet actions in
Africa and human rights problems.
"We should see the issue of arms
limitation as discrete and separate
from other political and moral prob
lems," he said.
National interest
Hart said there was no way to "di
vorce the SALT issue" from the
"general political mood" created by
Soviet actions. But SALT II should
"proceed on its own footing because
it is within our national interest," he
added.
Hart emphasized that he would
like to elevate SALT above other
everyday issues because of its "moral
implications."
"We should not only ask what is
the best thing for the country, but
what is the right thing to do," he said.
"It's hard to get people to realize
that arms limitation concerns the loss
of human life and the destruction of
civilization as we know it,"he con
tinued.

Hart said he felt it was necessary to
transcend political lines on the issue.
Partisan wrangling would be "ex
tremely divisive and destructive," he
said.
Both the Americans and Soviets
must take the lead in setting an
example refraining from nuclear pro
liferation, Hart said.
"We are going to have to step back
before we can convince others to do
so," he said.
The question of whether technol
ogy is outrunning diplomacy poses a
real problem, according to Hart.
"While we are limiting our nuclear
capabilities, we still continue to
modernize them," he explained.
Hart also said the loss of one-tenth
of the Soviet population during
World War II has had a profound in
fluence on the Russian attitudes to
ward diplomacy. As the years pass,
World War II leaders are often re
placed by younger technocrats, who
do not remember the war. Thus the
issue becomes "so abstract, techni
cal and scientific" that people tend to
loose their overwhelming sense of
the impact of nuclear war, Hart ad
ded.


Gary Hart
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) said he
expects that a treaty concluding six
years of Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT II) will be formally signed
"sometime between Thanksgiving
and Christmas," although he con
ceded yesterday in a Daily interview
that ratification will "not be easy."
In a speech sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) before an audience of
about 150, Hart blamed differences
between the United States and the
Soviet Union for the delay.
"The difficulty in negotiation lies
in the fact that we are not negotiating
as equals," he said. "The Soviets are
ahead of us in some respects and we
are ahead of them in others," he
said.
Hart contrasted the American em
phasis on technological sophistica
tion with the Soviet emphasis on
what he called "brute strength," a
divergence on issues which makes
the negotiating process similar to
trading "apples for oranges."
Hart said he envisions further dif
ficulties in ratification of the emerg
ing treaty. The senator said he was
"disturbed by the intensity of criti
cism leveled at the talks by people
who should know better."
"You don't have to trust the
Soviets in order to support SALT II,"
because the proposed treaty would
not compromise American ability to
"know to a 'T' what the Soviets are
doing almost all the time," he said.
Without a SALT II treaty, "all bets
are off," he added, since nations

would be free to conceal military
capabilities and to interfere with an
opposing nation's military surveil
lance.
Hart said he feels it is "necessary to
convince the American public —
which he said has been largely ob
livious of SALT — that the treaty is in

America's national security interest.
The senator said he came to Stan
ford as part of a "broad-based educa
tional campaign" designed to "gen
erate student involvement and in
terest in the issue."
If sufficiently informed, "there is
no question in my mind which way
the majority of the American people
will come out."
Hart said he hopes to "energize"
students, perhaps leading to a na
tional campaign for ratification. Stu

dents have an obligation to be
"thoughtfully informed" on the is
sue, he continued.
Hart opposes linking SALT II to
other issues such as Soviet actions in
Africa and human rights problems.
