## Ensemble bungles harsh moral 
### 
Jean Anouilh's Romeo
and Jeanette is a modernist
retelling of an ancient tradi
tion of "Doomed Lovers"
tragedies. It is a strange and
confusing conglomerate of
humor, absurdism and
psychological portrayal. Yet
it is a profound and valuable
play, and it is a shame that
the San Francisco Players
Ensemble didn't have the
equipment to carry it otf.
During the first half of his
career, Jean Anouilh saw life
in singularly harsh and un
compromising terms.
Romeo and Jeannette ex
presses his dismay at a
world which has no place
for his idealistic conception
of love, an emotion which
he believed to be so abso
lute and romantic that it
could not be reconciled
with the imperfections of
our commonplace life.
Choice
In his plays, Anouilh de
picts the spiritual purity and
power of love. He Argues
that because of its uncom
promising nature, love or
even "goodness" cannot
exist for long in our entirely
compromising world of
pain ("veil of tears," what
have you). These pure emo
tions can only result, as far
as Anouilh is concerned, in
great agonies and even
death. For he saw the alter
native to this self
consuming love as self
compromise and self
deception. He calls this
"cheating," through which
men and women escape
their pain and sell their
souls to the bourgeois idols
of respectability and moral
ity.
Specifically in Romeo and
Jeanette, Anouilh has the
"wisest" character, Lucien,
describe a Cod who de
spises love and lovers and
destroys them whenever he
catches them indulging in
that business. For example,

Lucien advises Frederick,
the Romeo, not to do some
thing "good" like running
off with his Jeanette, as he is
bound to "lose." Lucien
tells him to make the com
promise which life and Cod
demand. God "rigs the
game" so love cannot last,
and horrible misery ensues
without exception. While
being an accurate depiction
of the intricate steps in the
fruition of love, the play is
also about love's ultimate
incompatibility with the
changes and twists of life
and fortune.
Anouilh, always a theatri
cal innovator, concocts a
plot and characters for
Romeo and Jeanette which
border on the fantastical.
Frederick is an honest,
friendly law student who,
with his fiancee Julia and his
straight and polished
bourgeois mother, goes to
meet Julia's family for the
first time. The father turns
out to be a selfish, hypocrit
ical drunk, the brother Lu
cien an embittered poet fol
lowing in his father's un
even footsteps. The sister
Jeanette is a half-mad
Ophelia-type who wears
rags and roams in the
woods. She supports the
trio by selling her body to
local wierdos. They live in a
messy cabin in the woods,
away from civilization.
Despair
Naturally, Frederick falls
in love with Jeanette, who
turns out to be a compulsive
liar as well as a whore, and
they run off to another ca
bin, deeper in the woods.
Julia, meanwhile, attempts
suicide. Frederick returns to
her, and Jeanette marries a
man in a black trenchcoat,
her last "lover," who's been
seen lurking around the
house.
But she promises Fre
derick that they can pre
serve their love by dying to

gether, and she runs into
the sea. He follows her, and
they both perish. Julia and
Mother go home to Subur
bia, assumedly. Lucien, the
brother who has been
Anouilh's own voice of de
spair throughout the play,
gets a job in the jungles of
Africa which he has wanted
for a long time. He tells the
Postman who delivers the
long-awaited letter that
there are "no more children
left" — innocence is dead,
and the curtain falls.
At best, Anouilh's "mystic
wasteland" reveals his deep
psychological perceptions.
At worst, it becomes self
conscious rant which adds
nothing. Unlike the
eloquent Romeo or Juliet,
his characters are searching
for themselves, and express
this self-consciousness
constantly in poetic images
which sound somewhat like
the ravings of lunatics.
Part of the reason the
words ring in the ear, how
ever, is the poor job done
by the San Francisco Players
Ensemble. Allowing them
credit for having attempted
a difficult play, and allowing
that they are only a semi
professional company, the
major issues of Anouilh's
work were obscured, the
characterizations, and
overall concept and direc
tion could be material for
the blackest tragedy which
Anouilh might imagine.
Confusion
Fred Hartman dressed up
Romeo and Jeanette as if it
were the closing episode for
the Addams Family. Julia's
crazy relatives were all so
extreme in their perverse
appearance and so under
played verbally that nothing
could be ascertained of
their characters outside of
their superficial eccen
tricities.
Hartman apparently had
no feel for Anouilh's off

beat poetry. He never estab
lished which scenes ought
to be emphasized, where
the momentum of the play
was leading, the emotional
highs and lows, or even
which relationships were
the key ones
Relationships within
the whole never began to
take shape in any conscious
manner. It doesn't seem
likely that Anouilh meant
his play to be so formless, or
quite so confusing.
The actors might consider
taking a year, or even a
week, off to study Shakes
peare — it's good practice.
The cast, with a couple of
exceptions, grumbled and
mumbled their sleepy way
through what needs to be
very sharp and intricate
dialogues.
Dion Chesse deserves
very honorable mention as
the only actor who spoke
his lines loud enough to be
heard well in the back of the
tiny theater. Karl Schuck's
Lucien had some very good
moments, although he
played his part so much like
a stock vampire that the pro
fundity and humanity of his
lines didn't come across.
With the exception of these
two men, the cast never
reacted to each other on
stage at all, including the
two leads. Perhaps they
hoped that the dream effect
Anouilh intended would be
enhanced if they acted
half-asleep.
To the true literary snob,
it's a shame that good plays
have to be done by mere ac
tors. While the production
of Romeo and leanette at
the San Francisco Actors En
semble will do nothing to
discourage that view among
its proponents, the play it
self is worth seeing even on
these terms. The Ensemble
deserves applause for tak
ing up Anouilh's worthy
banner of despair.
