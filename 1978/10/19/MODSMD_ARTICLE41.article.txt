## ACT 'Winter's Tale' disappointing 
### 
The American Conservatory
Theatre opened its 1978-79 sea
son with William Shakes
peare's The Winter's Tale. The
fantastical allegory, one of
Shakespeare's later works, has
only recently gained acclaim
for its theme of re-birth.
The story revolves around
King Leontes of Sicily (Daniel
Kern), his sins, symbolic death
and renaissance. Leontes un
justly accuses his wife, Her
mione (Cynthia Sykes), of adul
tery, then rejects the oracle of
Apollo's affirmation of her in
nocence. When the king defies
the gods, his young son im
mediately dies, and we are told
that Hermione also dies.
The second movement of
the play takes place in the
sunny, enchanted land of
Bohemia. There Perdita (Janice
Garcia), the abandoned infant
Leontes refuses to believe is
his own, has been claimed by
shepherds and raised. The
spirit of this section is light and
pleasant, complete with won
derful fools, rogues and song.
The concluding segment of
The Winter's Tale occurs back
in Sicily where, after sixteen
years, Perdita returns, Leontes
is redeemed by his long years
of repentance, and Hermione
miraculously reappears from
her imagined death.
Despite pagan trappings,
The Winter's Tale is a very
Christian play. Director Wil
liam Ball emphasises the theme
of redemption with a black
clothed cast at the play's tragic
beginning, the growing colors
of spring in the Bohemian at
tire, and brilliant white cos
tumes when Sicily's royal famly
is reconciled. Ball states that
"The color system may be a lit
tle arbitrary, and possibly a lit
tle obvious...lt helps to make
the story clear." Honestly, I do
not see how Ball could have
been more obvious unless he
had had the various move
ments of the play announced
with placards.
Particularly blatant was the
black-shrouded Leontes who

stood on the Bohemia set
throughout Act IV. Later, back
in Sicily, at the beginning of Act
V, Leontes is deshrouded and
revealed standing in a white
loincloth looking remarkably
Christlike. Then he slips into a
white caftan, dons a saintly
smile, and joins the living
world again.
Perhaps Ball's conception of
The Winter's Tale could have
been more successful if he had
cast the roles better. The two
leads, Kern and Sykes, seepi
weak and inhuman in compari
son to the strong, vibrant per
formance of Marion Walters
as Paulina, the wise and caustic

defender of Hermione.
Let me draw, for a moment,
on notes from a lecture by Pro
fessor Ron Rebholtz. The im
probably restored happiness
of the royal family, while re
maining improbable, implies a
divine providence capable of
overcoming the obstacles of
human folly. Ball's emphasis
on allegory renders the last
scene only a little more than
pleasantly surprising when it
should convey hope and prom
ise.
Ball's relentless direction of
the play on allegorical terms
only distances the audience.
He has the Sicilian lords speak
ing in chorus, turning their
heads in chorus, and sighing in
chorus. When the prince's

death is announced, drums roll
and the court falls whining,
moaning, and crying on the
floor.The audience sat a little
uneasily through these scenes
unsure whether their own
knowledge of theater was lack
ing or if the action was bereft of
all dignity and was rather
ridiculous.
The action which takes place
in Bohemia is the warmest and
most delightful. Introduced is
Autolycus (Daniel Davis), a
rogue wih no redeeming value
beyond his capacity to enter
tain. A beautifully executed
scene occurs when Autolycus
produces song sheets at a
sheep shearing festival. While
he steals their purses, the en
tire company join in rich and
buoyant song. Musical direc
tor, Lee Hoiby, is to be com
mended for this short, yet
memorable passage.
While the music in this scene
is recorded, I found it more
admirable than the live percus
sion accompaniment in the
first three acts. Maybe Ball's in
tention is to define mood or to
dramatize, but these auditory
jostles can be likened to televi
sion's canned laughter — a
method of insuring the desired
reaction.
Richard Segar's set, a white,
tiered platform with a unifying
sun motif, proved effective and
pleasing in its simplicity.
Robert Fletcher's costumes
complemented Segar's work;
the simple tunics worn in Sicily
were austerely attractive. I am
somewhat more reserved in
my approval of the Bohemian
costumes. Though most are
humorously gaudy, and some
genuinely pleasing, a few of
the cast wear flesh-colored
leotards and tights under
skimpy tunics, looking sillyand
amateurish.
I left the play entertained yet
dissatisfied. ACT's production
is pleasant but does not exploit
the company's potential.
Shakespeare's The Winter's
Tale radiates optimism and the
promise that human fallibility

can be overcome by the exer
cise of goodness. William Ball's
production never really
touches the audience's emo
tions except in those Bohe
mian scenes where warmth
cannot be repressed. When
given the chance, the audience
quickly latches on to any ves
tige of humanity they can find
in the production, whether it
be in the form of Paulina, the
old shepherd who adopts Per
dita (Sydney Walker), or in the
unabashed Autolycus.
One wishes that Ball aban
don the slick pretentiousness
that pervades many of ACT's
productions, and that he in
struct his major actors, other
than Marion Walters, to at least
pretend that they are talking to
each other rather than to an
audience.
One wishes that Ball would
have seen that Shakespeare
seeks human truths through
drama, and that these truths
must be understood by the
soul before they can instruct
the intellect. And finally one
wishes that the director would
have played Shakespeare
rather than playing with it.
