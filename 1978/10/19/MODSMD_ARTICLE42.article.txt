## Stanford's new dance club 
### 
People think of Stanford
University in a variety of ways:
as an engineering school, a
jock school, or as an elitist
ivory tower, but rarely do they
see it as a dance school. We
have, however, a good, strong,
dance department, although
fewer people know about it
than the newly formed Dance
Club would like.
The club's goal is to increase
the community's awareness,
experience and appreciation of
dance in general, and of dance
at Stanford in particular. The
group hopes to strengthen and
broaden Stanford's program
by bringing in artists for master
classes, workshops, etc.
The club members will be
current Stanford students, al
though most of the club's ac
tivities will be open to the pub
lic, subject to fees. A special
attempt will be made to bring
back alumni who are currently
performing or teaching to
share their experiences.
This quarter
Two master classes are plan
ned for the remainder of this
quarter, to be given by local
and Bay Area artists. The artists'

names and the dates are not yet
firm, but Z'eva Cohen (mod
ern) and Richard Gibson (bal
let) have both been mentioned
as future possibilities.
The group will also help
sponsor already existing work
shops, such as those of Direc
tor of Dance Inga Weiss. These
workshops have been ex
tremely well attended in the
past and have given the com
munity, outside Stanford in
particular, a chance to learn
from the noted teacher.
Increasing interest
Interest in dance as an art
form and as physical recreation
has been increasing nation
wide. The popularity of Stan
ford's classes demonstrate this
trend, as did the full studios of
last spring's performances by
the candidates for MAs in
dance education. (Attendance
was large enough to warrant
using Dinkelspiel Auditorium
for this year's performances.)
The group comes at an oppor
tune time, both to make use of
existing resources in dance,
and to augment these re
sources through guest artists.
As the dance department

here is part of the Department
of Athletics, the group will be
organized under the depart
ment's club program. Mem
bership will be on a quarterly
basis, and as with the other
sports department clubs, there
will be a membership fee of
about $15. This will include
admission to the masterclasses
and workshops.
Open to all
It should be pointed out that
the term "master class" does
not imply a certain level of
technical ability of those in at
tendance, but rather that the
teacher has special expertise in
an area, and that he or she will
teach for a limited, rather than
an ongoing, time period. The
group is thus open to all Stan
ford students who are in
terested in dance.
The Dance Club had a pre
liminary meeting last week. It
will organize more fully at this
week's meeting on Thursday
night at 7:30 in the lounge in
Roble Gym. If you are in
terested and cannot come to
the meeting, please call 497-
4895, and leave a message for
Leslee Lewis.

People think of Stanford
University in a variety of ways:
as an engineering school, a
jock school, or as an elitist
ivory tower, but rarely do they
see it as a dance school. We
have, however, a good, strong,
dance department, although
fewer people know about it
than the newly formed Dance
Club would like.
The club's goal is to increase
the community's awareness,
experience and appreciation of
dance in general, and of dance
at Stanford in particular. The
group hopes to strengthen and
broaden Stanford's program
by bringing in artists for master
classes, workshops, etc.
The club members will be
current Stanford students, al
though most of the club's ac
tivities will be open to the pub
lic, subject to fees. A special
attempt will be made to bring
back alumni who are currently
performing or teaching to
share their experiences.
This quarter
Two master classes are plan
ned for the remainder of this
quarter, to be given by local
and Bay Area artists. The artists'

names and the dates are not yet
firm, but Z'eva Cohen (mod
ern) and Richard Gibson (bal
let) have both been mentioned
as future possibilities.
The group will also help
sponsor already existing work
shops, such as those of Direc
tor of Dance Inga Weiss. These
workshops have been ex
tremely well attended in the
past and have given the com
munity, outside Stanford in
particular, a chance to learn
from the noted teacher.
Increasing interest
Interest in dance as an art
form and as physical recreation
has been increasing nation
wide. The popularity of Stan
ford's classes demonstrate this
trend, as did the full studios of
last spring's performances by
the candidates for MAs in
dance education. (Attendance
was large enough to warrant
using Dinkelspiel Auditorium
for this year's performances.)
The group comes at an oppor
tune time, both to make use of
existing resources in dance,
and to augment these re
sources through guest artists.
As the dance department

here is part of the Department
of Athletics, the group will be
organized under the depart
ment's club program. Mem
bership will be on a quarterly
basis, and as with the other
sports department clubs, there
will be a membership fee of
about $15. This will include
admission to the masterclasses
and workshops.
Open to all
It should be pointed out that
the term "master class" does
not imply a certain level of
technical ability of those in at
tendance, but rather that the
teacher has special expertise in
an area, and that he or she will
teach for a limited, rather than
an ongoing, time period. The
group is thus open to all Stan
ford students who are in
terested in dance.
The Dance Club had a pre
liminary meeting last week. It
will organize more fully at this
week's meeting on Thursday
night at 7:30 in the lounge in
Roble Gym. If you are in
terested and cannot come to
the meeting, please call 497-
