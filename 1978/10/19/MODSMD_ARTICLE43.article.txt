## 'Viva Italia!': good spirits 
### 
"I think you have mistaken my white
Rolls for an ambulance," says the wealthy
boor to the uncooperative hospital atten
dants. And the inspired idiocy of a mo
ment like this is what Viva Italia! is all ab
out. This collection of nine sketches, like
the incredibly rich man who becomes the
tale-telling benefactor of a hit and run vic
tim, is successful because it's too confi
dent in its own vigor to harbor any doubts
about whether it's as funny as it thinks it is.
At its megalomanic worst, watching Viva
Italia! is like watching a dinner-table comic
being overcome by his own wit: although
we are no longer laughing at the joke it
self, nonetheless we do laugh. But at its
best moments, which, happily, come with
some regularity, Viva Italia! catches us up
in its intoxicating blend of good spirits.
As might be expected from a film which
takes it upon itself to satirize everything
from the church to nightclubs Viva Italia!
sometimes confuses brashness with
charm. Not all of the sketches work;

some, off to a promising start, falter half
way.
A nicely filmed episode about two city
priests who stumble into an unruly meet
ing at a village parish when their car breaks
down fizzles out because the filmmakers
aren't sure whether they want to burles
que the priests or the villagers. Another
skit, about the making of a stag film "with
just a small monkey," spoils all its careful
buildup by bringing in a not-very-funny
jab at kiddie porn.
If Viva Italia! isn't very consistent in its
level of humor, neither is it ever unin
teresting. There's something a little spe
cial about each sketch, and a tension de
velops in the audience about whether it's
going to work out. When a sketch doesn't
quite jell, well, there's always another
one. But when a sketch does work —
— take, for example, the opening
scene. We are listening to nightclub chan
teuse Fiorella, who is described as "the

canary of Padana Valley" by her husband
(overplayed with gusto by Vittorio
Cassman). When Fiorella loses her voice
in the middle of a grueling tour, he shouts
"jesus Christ! With all your body to
choose from it had to be your throat!"
Always pragmatic, the husband finds an
inventive and outrageous way for her to
continue the tour.
And then take the last scene, where we
are at the funeral of the great comedian
Formichella. There are enough tears in the
crowd to flood a Buick. Formichella's
straight man gives the eulogy, but realizes
in the middle that he did all the work with
out getting any of the laughs. While For
michella's coffin gleams dully, his partner
rehashes his routines and takes off with
the funeral party.
There are seven sketches sandwiched in
between these two; most of them are en
joyable. Viva Italia! is one of those movies
which makes up for its weaknesses with an
outpouring of high spirits.
