Production of warhead ordered
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has or
dered production of the crucial elements of the
neutron weapon but is reserving judgment on its
deployment, his chief spokesman said yesterday.
Press Secretary jody Powell said the decision
was unlikely to have any impact on the current
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) negotia
tions.
Powell emphasized that no final decision has
been made on assembling the complete neutron
weapon or putting it to use as a line of defense
against Soviet and other Warsaw Pact forces in
Europe.
The bomb, formally known as an "enhanced
radiation warhead," is a small warhead that would
be placed on Lance missiles and 8-inch artillery
shells. It produces twice the deadly radiation of a
conventional nuclear bomb but less than one
tenth as much explosive power. It is designed to
kill enemy soldiers without causing widespread
destruction of buildings in populated areas.
Powell said "the elemens ts needed to produce
an assembled warhead will be kept here in the
United States." But he added, the actual assembly
"will take much less time once the elements are in
existence."
Carter disclosed on April 7 that he was deferring
production of the weapon, holding off a decision
that he said would be influenced by the degree of
Soviet restraint in conventional and nuclear arms.
New pope to be installed Sunday
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II yesterday
praised the cardinals of the Roman Catholic
Church for displaying "great courage" in electing
the first non-Italian pope in four centuries.
Speaking in Italian, the pope reminded the pr
inces of the church that "some even now are not
spared the experience of prisons, suffering and
humiliation for Christ."
It was assumed that because of his long experi
ence with Nazism and communism in Poland, the
pope was referring to prisoners under communist
regimes. But he also could have been speaking of
prisoners in Latin America and nations of both the
right and the left that have imprisoned members of
the church.
The former Cardinal Karl Wojtyla met with the
cardinals in the frescoed Consistory Hall of the
Apostolic Palace. The group included the 110 car
dinals who took part in the secret conclave and 10
others over age 80 who were barred from voting by
the late Pope Paul's revision of papal electoral
rules.
John Paul also suggested that his election was
made possible by his predecessor Paul VI, who
chose new cardinals for the Roman Catholic
Church "from the extreme ends of the earth."
In Poland, government officials said the pope
would be welcome to visit his homeland. Ten
years ago, Paul VI was barred from entry.

Air traffic improvements urged
Washington — A federal safety board investigat
ing North America's worst air disaster recom
mended yesterday that improvements be made in
the air traffic control system at San Diego's
Lindbergh Field.
A Pacific Southwest Airlines plane approaching
Lindbergh collided with a single-engine private
aircraft on Sept. 25. Both planes crashed, killing
144 persons, including several on the ground.
The National Transportation Safety Board re
commended that terminal radar service area
(TRSA) procedures be put into effect at the airport.
TRSA, also termed Stage 111, is in operation at
Miramar Naval Air Station, the primary airport in
the San Diego area.
"We realize that a TRSA may not have prevented
the midair collision . . . since visual separation is
still being used in all terminal areas," wrote board
chairman James King. "Nevertheless, we believe
that a TRSA would lessen the possibility of a midair
collision and wouid be a logical first step toward
equalizing the air traffic control services available
to all users of air space in the San Diego terminal
area."
The board also recommended that the board
review procedures at all airports used regularly by
air-carrier and general-aviation aircraft to deter
mine if other areas require either a TRSA or an
even stricter terminal control area (TCA). TCA re
quires aircraft to have additional equipment and to
conform to other regulations, including speed.
Karpov returns to Soviet acclaim
Moscow — Victorious chess champion Anatoly
Karpov was officially credited here yesterday with
upholding the Soviet way of life by beating "un
scrupulous" defector Viktor Korchnoi in the world
championship tournament in the Philippines.
Defeating "a very experienced, dangerous and
perfidious adversary," the official Tass news
agency said, Karpov carried "the greatest respon
sibility ever borne in a match by a Soviet chess
player" in defending his title.
Using the words of a Philippine commentator,
Tass said, "Anatoly Karpov, just a young man, is
defending the social system which he represents,
and which his rival, who fled the country, is trying
to discredit."
Korchnoi, 47, resigned yesterday rather than re
sume a game adjourned Tuesday. That gave Kar
pov, 27, the sixth win he needed to end the
three-month-long tournament at Baguio City. He
keeps his title and wins $350,000. Korchnoi gets
$200,000.
Korchnoi, who claimed match organizers made
him play under "intolerable conditions," said he
would file a protest.
Dole will enter presidential race
Kewanee, 111. — Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said
Tuesday night that he will be a presidential candi

date in 1980.
Dole, the Republican vice presidential candi
date in 1976, was asked by a reporter during a news
conference whether he will be a candidate two
years from now. "Yes," he replied in a low voice.
Dole was in Kewanee to speak at the annual
dinner of the Henry County Republicans.
In the past Dole has hinted that he may enter the
presidential race. Tuesday night was apparently
the first time he gave a direct answer to the ques
tion of whether he would seek the nomination in
1980.
He said he also expects former President Gerald
Ford and former California Gov. Ronald Reagan to
seek the Republican presidential nomination in
1980.
Victim awarded $7.6 million
San Francisco — A woman who became a quad
raplegic after having radiation therapy for cancer
six years ago was awarded $7.6 million in damages
yesterday in San Francisco Superior Court.
It was believed to be the largest malpractice
award in California history.
Laurie Necochea, 18, who is confined to a
wheelchair, said upon hearing the jury's verdict:
"They're wonderful people and now I have a
chance for my life."
Necochea underwent six weeks of radiation
treatment at Mt. Zion Hospital in 1972 in an at
tempt to treat thyroid cancer. According to tes
timony at the trial, she was almost completely
paralyzed by the end of 1973.
Defendants held liable for the paralysis were the
hospital, Dr. Joseph Castro, chief of its radiology
department, and the Regents of the University of
California. The regents were included in the suit
because the radiation therapy program is operated
jointly by the hospital and the University of
California Medical Center here.
Medical witnesses testified during the trial that a
double dose of radiation behind Necochea's voice
box caused the paralysis. Her attorneys said that
extra dosage destroyed the spinal cord at the fifth
cervical vertebra, halfway down her neck.

of the week to 37.42 points.
