"Informed consent is seen as an issue affecting the
distribution of power between the doctor and pa
tient," said linnet Fowles, moderator fora discussion
panel on informed consent held here last night.
The panel, sponsored by Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI) and the Stanford
Medical Students Association, was one of an antici
pated series of panels on the legal and moral aspects
of health care.
"The legal issues of informed consent are whether
doctors have full discretion to conceal information
from pat'ents or whether patients have a right to
information pertinent to their medical care," said
]ohn Levin, attorney and chairperson of the Northern
California Cancer Croup.
"State courts have held that patients have a right to
informed consent," he continued. "Underlying
these decisions is a notion that competent adults
have a right to control their own bodies."
"Consent to undergo medical treatment should be
voluntary and not induced by ignorance of benefits
and risks," he added. "Patients' dependence on doc
tors for information creates a relationship of trust,
thus making the disclosure of such information the
perogative of the patients â€” the obligation of the
doctors."
According to Levin the informed consent require
ment does not apply to certain medical situations. It is
not required for simple and routine procedures such
as a blood test. In emergency situations where the
patient is unable to give his consent, consent is im
plied. If, in the physician's judgment, information
would so upset the patient that he could not make a

rational decision, the doctor should not be required
to disclose such information, Levin added.
"The measure of how much information should be
disclosed is what the prudent person in the patient's
position would require to make an informed deci
sion," Levin said, adding that this would include in
formation about possible risks and benefits of the
proposed treatment.
But pragmatic difficulties are created by the legal
imposition of informed consent, according to Dr. Roy
Cohn, professor of surgery here.
"It's a good idea," Cohn said, "but it just doesn't
work. Don't forget that many patients are ignorant
and illiterate. There is no way to get across to them a
well defined medical explanation."
Dr. Halstead Holman, professor of internal
medicine here disagreed with Cohn, saying, "People
have an extraordinary capacity to learn when con
fronted with an important decision.
"If a doctor has doubts about a patient's under
standing he can have the family check it out in the
doctor's absence," he added.
"But disclosure doesn't necessarily improve the
patient's ability to obtain the desi red treatment," said
Andrew Jamilton of the Health Policy Program at
UC-San Francisco.
"Even if information isdisclosed there is no guaran
tee that patients will act on it rationally," he added.
Sheryl Brown, a member of the Coalition for Medi
cal Rights for Women, agreed that informed consent
places more responsibility on patients. However, she
argued that the practice should be enforced.
"There is a need to make the medical system more
responsive to patients," she said.
