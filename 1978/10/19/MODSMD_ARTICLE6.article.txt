San Francisco (AP) — An aggressive
Evelle Younger lashed at Gov. Jerry
Brown as "the worst governor in the
modern history of California" in their
first face-to-face debate yesterday.
The Democratic governor ap
peared unruffled by Younger's chal
lenges to his truthfulness and com
petency, and he ignored Younger's
sharpest attacks, instead painting a
picture of a prosperous state
economy and frugal government
under his leadership.
The debate, aired statewide over
17 television stations, was a contrast
in styles, and a mass of contradictory
statistics.
In sharp contrast to his usual low
keyed style, Younger attacked re
peatedly. The Republican nominee
for governor charged Brown was
either "grossly incompetent" or "in
tentionally misleading" Californians
about the budget surplus. And he

said Brown has ignored pressing
problems and lost millions of federal
dollars for California by poor plan
ning.
"You're the worst governor in the
modern history of California,"
Younger said to Brown in his closing
comments.
'Whim of iron'
"You've got a whim of iron. You
substitute buzz words for action.
Your arrogant disrespect for the citi
zens is evident by your outrageous
appointments.
"Because you're obviously run
ning for president, if you're re
elected, you'd willingly abandon
California to Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dym
ally, a man you've treated with con
tempt for four years," Younger said.
Brown was repeatedly on the de
fensive — explaining the surplus fi
gures, explaining whether he was
circumventing his hiring freeze with
temporary employees, explaining
budget figures.
And when his own turns came to
interrogate Younger, Brown attemp
ted only occasionally to challenge
Younger's performance as attorney
general in the past eight years.
Similar stands
The two candidates took similar
stands in favor of local control of
budgets, against expanded regional
government and against future state
tax increases.
Both promised to lower state taxes
again if state budget surpluses con
tinue. Both endorsed government
spending limits.
Brown said the state should give
local governments an additional $4
billion next year in Proposition 13
bailout funds. Younger said the fi
gure should be $2.5 billion.
Younger proposed excluding the
first $16,000 in family income from all
state income taxes, while Brown did
not comment on that plan.
Brown lifted a 1200-page-thick
state budget to his podium, thumbed
through it often, and quoted figures
which he said demonstrate that he
had cut the rate of government
growth to one-fifth the growth under
his predecessor, Republican Ronald
Reagan.
Younger cited contradictory state
surplus figures from Brown's office
and said the government was guilty
of either "gross incompetence, or
you're intentionally misleading" the
public..

The Democratic governor ap
peared unruffled by Younger's chal
lenges to his truthfulness and com
petency, and he ignored Younger's
sharpest attacks, instead painting a
picture of a prosperous state
economy and frugal government
under his leadership.
The debate, aired statewide over
17 television stations, was a contrast
in styles, and a mass of contradictory
statistics.
In sharp contrast to his usual low
keyed style, Younger attacked re
peatedly. The Republican nominee
for governor charged Brown was
either "grossly incompetent" or "in
tentionally misleading" Californians
about the budget surplus. And he

said Brown has ignored pressing
problems and lost millions of federal
dollars for California by poor plan
ning.
"You're the worst governor in the
modern history of California,"
Younger said to Brown in his closing
comments.
'Whim of iron'
"You've got a whim of iron. You
substitute buzz words for action.
Your arrogant disrespect for the citi
zens is evident by your outrageous
appointments.
"Because you're obviously run
ning for president, if you're re
elected, you'd willingly abandon
California to Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dym
ally, a man you've treated with con
tempt for four years," Younger said.
Brown was repeatedly on the de
fensive — explaining the surplus fi
gures, explaining whether he was
circumventing his hiring freeze with
temporary employees, explaining
budget figures.
And when his own turns came to
interrogate Younger, Brown attemp
ted only occasionally to challenge
Younger's performance as attorney
general in the past eight years.
Similar stands
The two candidates took similar
stands in favor of local control of
budgets, against expanded regional
government and against future state
tax increases.
Both promised to lower state taxes
again if state budget surpluses con
tinue. Both endorsed government
spending limits.
Brown said the state should give
local governments an additional $4
billion next year in Proposition 13
bailout funds. Younger said the fi
gure should be $2.5 billion.
Younger proposed excluding the
first $16,000 in family income from all
state income taxes, while Brown did
not comment on that plan.
Brown lifted a 1200-page-thick
state budget to his podium, thumbed
through it often, and quoted figures
which he said demonstrate that he
had cut the rate of government
growth to one-fifth the growth under
his predecessor, Republican Ronald
Reagan.
Younger cited contradictory state
surplus figures from Brown's office
and said the government was guilty
of either "gross incompetence, or
you're intentionally misleading" the
public..
