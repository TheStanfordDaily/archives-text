"Germany is no longer the
economic giant, content to remain
politically stunted," Hans Gres
mann, deputy chief editor of the Reg
ional German Television Network
Sudwestfunk (Southwest Radio) said
Tuesday.
Gresmann spoke on "The Interna
tional Political Scene in the Federal
Republic of Germany" to about 30
people as part of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center Tuesday luncheon
lecture series.
Gresmann works in Baden-Baden,
and is the former political editor of
Die Zeit. He has traveled extensively
throughout North and South
America as well as Asia. He was vice
president of the German National
Committee of the International Press
Institute and recipient of the
Theodor Wolff Journalism Prize for

his report on the guerilla movement
in Latin America.
"Germans experience a new self
confidence now. The Federal Repub
lic is using its economic miracle to
increase political power and stabil
ity," Cresmann said.
Cresmann pointed to Germany's
increased defense budget and said,
"while other countries are eliminat
ing the draft, Germany has increased
her armed forces to the maximum
500,000 soldiers allowed under the
NATO pact." Ih addition, West Ger
many "controls some of the more
modern weapons equipment," ac
cording to Gresmann.
West Germany's rising self
confidence is also due to her
"guaranteed political stability,"
Gresmann said. "We've weathered
the post-war charges of Nazism and
communism and more recently the

guerilla and terrorist attacks. None
have made a dent on the political
stability," he added.
Three parties compose West Ger
many's political structure. Currently,
the Social Democrats and the Liber
als control the government, while
another party, the Christian Democ
rats, are the opposition.
When the luncheon audience was
allowed to ask Gresmann questions,
several people challenged his claim
that Germany was politically stable.
Members of the audience pointed
out that West German government
policy of several years, the Be
rufsverbote (Forbidden Job), had
been discriminating against Ger
mans who would not sign a state
ment saying that they fully supported
the West German constitution.
