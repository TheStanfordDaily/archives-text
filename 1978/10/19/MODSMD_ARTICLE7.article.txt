### ANNE BOWDEN 
"Germany is no longer the
economic giant, content to remain
politically stunted," Hans Gres
mann, deputy chief editor of the Reg
ional German Television Network
Sudwestfunk (Southwest Radio) said
Tuesday.
Gresmann spoke on "The Interna
tional Political Scene in the Federal
Republic of Germany" to about 30
people as part of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center Tuesday luncheon
lecture series.
Gresmann works in Baden-Baden,
and is the former political editor of
Die Zeit. He has traveled extensively
throughout North and South
America as well as Asia. He was vice
president of the German National
Committee of the International Press
Institute and recipient of the
Theodor Wolff Journalism Prize for

his report on the guerilla movement
in Latin America.
"Germans experience a new self
confidence now. The Federal Repub
lic is using its economic miracle to
increase political power and stabil
ity," Cresmann said.
Cresmann pointed to Germany's
increased defense budget and said,
"while other countries are eliminat
ing the draft, Germany has increased
her armed forces to the maximum
500,000 soldiers allowed under the
NATO pact." Ih addition, West Ger
many "controls some of the more
modern weapons equipment," ac
cording to Gresmann.
West Germany's rising self
confidence is also due to her
"guaranteed political stability,"
Gresmann said. "We've weathered
the post-war charges of Nazism and
communism and more recently the

guerilla and terrorist attacks. None
have made a dent on the political
stability," he added.
Three parties compose West Ger
many's political structure. Currently,
the Social Democrats and the Liber
als control the government, while
another party, the Christian Democ
rats, are the opposition.
When the luncheon audience was
allowed to ask Gresmann questions,
several people challenged his claim
that Germany was politically stable.
Members of the audience pointed
out that West German government
policy of several years, the Be
rufsverbote (Forbidden Job), had
been discriminating against Ger
mans who would not sign a state
ment saying that they fully supported
the West German constitution.

Wirth called the school the "best

Junior Michael Barzelay, who
spent last summer working in Brazil,
said the opportunity to learn about
Brazilian culture and become part of
it can "touch one's whole way of
looking at things."
Smith, Wirth and Barzelay all ag

said Brazil is the most industrialized
of the Latin American countries.
Concerning the overseas program
in general, Wirth said, "It is tre

thing in the Third World, instead of
being Europe-centered."
"There are few opportunities to
spend time in less developed coun
tries, in an educational setting of
high quality," Barzelay added.

president of the German National
Committee of the International Press
Institute and recipient of the
Theodor Wolff Journalism Prize for

his report on the guerilla movement
in Latin America.
"Germans experience a new self
confidence now. The Federal Repub
lic is using its economic miracle to
increase political power and stabil
ity," Cresmann said.
Cresmann pointed to Germany's
increased defense budget and said,
"while other countries are eliminat
ing the draft, Germany has increased
her armed forces to the maximum
500,000 soldiers allowed under the
NATO pact." Ih addition, West Ger
many "controls some of the more
modern weapons equipment," ac
cording to Gresmann.
West Germany's rising self
confidence is also due to her
"guaranteed political stability,"
Gresmann said. "We've weathered
the post-war charges of Nazism and
communism and more recently the

guerilla and terrorist attacks. None
have made a dent on the political
stability," he added.
Three parties compose West Ger
many's political structure. Currently,
the Social Democrats and the Liber
als control the government, while
another party, the Christian Democ
rats, are the opposition.
When the luncheon audience was
allowed to ask Gresmann questions,
several people challenged his claim
that Germany was politically stable.
Members of the audience pointed
out that West German government
policy of several years, the Be
rufsverbote (Forbidden Job), had
been discriminating against Ger
mans who would not sign a state
ment saying that they fully supported
the West German constitution.

Wirth called the school the "best

reed on Brazil's importance. Smith

said Brazil is the most industrialized
of the Latin American countries.
Concerning the overseas program
in general, Wirth said, "It is tre
mendously important to have some
thing in the Third World, instead of
being Europe-centered."
"There are few opportunities to
spend time in less developed coun
tries, in an educational setting of
high quality," Barzelay added.
"Germany is no longer the
economic giant, content to remain
politically stunted," Hans Gres
