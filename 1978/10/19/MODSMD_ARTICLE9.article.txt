# Team meets verbal challenge
## 
### STEVE BROWN 
Verbal quibbles are certainly not uncommon
here â€” between professors and their col
leagues, among students, between key adminis
trators. The University debate team is one group
that specializes in verbal argument.
The team offers members "experience in im
proving their speech skills. It teaches how to
argue effectively," )ohn Roos, team captain,
said. Roos, a second-year law student here, has
led the team for two years in verbal battles with
Northwestern University, USC, Harvard and
others.
Though most of the 10 members are taking a
course on debating here, membership on the
team is open.
Most debating competitions pair two
member teams against one another. There are
some individual events also. "To be really suc
cessful takes an incredible amount of time and
energy," Roos said.
Participants' entry fees, air fares, lodging and
meal expenses, while on team trips, are paid out
of funds the team has earned selling forensic

handbooks. Profits earned from the Stanford
Summer Forensics Institute here are also used.
Roos said the team here is not competitive
with "the top debate schools," which, like USC,
have $20,000 funds in some cases. "They're at a
strong advantage because they can afford to
start research on thetopicfordebateearly in the
summer, while we have to wait until fall. With
University support and a full-time debate cobch,
Stanford could have one of the strongest teams
in the nation," Roos said.
Presently, the team receives no funding from
ASSU because "there's just too much red tape to
cut. The amount they'd give us just isn't worth
fighting for," Roos added.
The issue which university teams throughout
the country are debating this year is: Should the
federal government implement a program to
guarantee full employment? At discussions,
held Tuesday evenings at the School of Law,
team members discuss the topic.
Debate competitions are open to public audi
ences.
