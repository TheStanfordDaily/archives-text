## 
### ART STEIN 
A Palo Alto library available
to students and faculty here
may soon be closed because of
budget cuts imposed by Prop
osition 13.
The College Terrace Library
of the Palo Alto library system
may be shut down by Dec. 1 to
help the Library Department
meet its 28 percent budget cut,
said department Director June
Fleming.
A town meeting was held at
the library last Tuesday to allow
the community to respond to
the proposed closing.
Approximately 100 commun
ity members attended this
"emotionally charged" meet
ing and expressed "much con
cern and anger" over the
proposed closing, said Library
Supervisor Pat Yowell.
By Nov. 14 the Finance and
Public Works Committee
should make its recommenda

tion to the City Council on the
closing of the library, said
Fleming.
The City Council then will
consider the fate of the library
possibly by the beginning of
December, she added.
In )anuary, the committee
will report the community's
views to the City Council based
on responses to town meet
ings, questionnaires, and
suggestion boxes, said Flem
ing.
"No realistic alternative has
been proposed at this time, but
some could come up in the fu
ture," Fleming said.
The closing of the library will
save the city approximately
$75,000, but additional reduc
tions, in the remaining Palo
Alto libraries, such as fewer
new books, shorter library
hours, and a smaller library
staff, will be needed to meet
the budget cut, she added.
