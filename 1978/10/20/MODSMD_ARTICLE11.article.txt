# IFC turnout 'exceptional'
## 14 fraternities give blood 
### BILL POWELL 
When you think of the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil (IFC), the Big Game bonfire and Lake Laguni
ta's Aqua Follies come to mind.
However, the IFC last week showed its com
mitment to community service, with the first in a
year-long series of Red Cross blood drives.
The turnout was exceptional, according to
Alan Soneda, IFC bloodmobile representative.
Fifty-four persons, from 14 fraternities, each
donated one unit.
Janice Morgan, donor consultant at the Palo
Alto Red Cross Center, said she was impressed
by the response.
Thirty units is considered a success at a day
long blood drive, she said, adding that the
number of donors forced the Red Cross staff to
stay an hour and a half late to process the
backlog.
The program started with Soneda, who had
organized bloodmobile drives at Kappa Sigma
for two years. Since few houses were able to
maintain a commitment to the Red Cross,
Soneda felt that a collective effort by the IFC
would yield greater results.
In addition, he said, there was a need for more
community service involvement by the IFC.
Last month, Soneda presented his proposal
for four blooddrives to be scheduled through
out the year at various houses. The 14 frater
nities approved his idea and spread the word to
their members. Under the new system, the
numbers of possible donors available for each
Bloodmobile increases greatly, he said.

Soneda further stated that he is working to
wards instituting a joint IFC/ISC (Inter Sorority
Council) blood drive starting in January. The
plan would create "an even bigger pool of po
tential donors," he said. However, he added
that plans are not yet finalized.
According to Michael Cresto, IFC vice
president, the fraternity system is also consider
ing holding blood drive competitions between
the Greek houses and other on-campus living
groups.
The remaining three IFC blood drives will be
held at fraternity houses on Jan. 12, Apr. 6, and
June 6. Although participation will be encour
aged by fraternity members, the bloodmobiles
will also be open to members of the general
public.
In addition to the three IFC Bloodmobiles, the
Red Cross will visit about 40 other spots on cam
pus, according to Morgan. She said the Univer
sity supplied 1227 units of blood last year, and
she hopes to reach a goal of 1700 this year.
Morgan said that collecting blood in small
quantities allows the Red Cross to schedule
mobiles "to neet the goals and needs of pa
tients on a seasonal basis."
This system of blood collection differs greatly
from nearby campuses such as Foothill College
and San Jose State, she continued, where large
semi-annual blood drives are held.
Blood collected by the Red Cross is used for
research, and is available tocounties in the cent
ral California area, including the Stanford Hos
pital.
