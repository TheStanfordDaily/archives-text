# Telephones for the deaf, ultrasonic cameras
## SRI doing research 'ahead of its time' 
### JOHN LANCASTER 
A robot-like industrial arm
with an artificial eye and the
ability toassembleand weld in
tricate parts? An ultrasonic
camera which allows doctors
to view the complex inner
workings of human bodies
without x-rays? A telephone for
the deaf? These aren't the
futuristic creations of a science
fiction writer. In fact, each of
these devices is being de
veloped just a few miles from
the University campus at Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI) In
ternational in Menlo Park.
SRI International is an inde
pendent, non-profit organiza
tion that performs contract re
search for a variety of busines
ses, organizations and indi
viduals.
Protests
Established by the University
in 1946 to "aid and supplement
scientific research" here, SRI
became the focus of anti-war
demonstrations in the late '60s.
University students protesting
the war gathered evidence to
prove that SRI was involved in
counter-insurgency research,
chemical and biological war
fare research and explosives
technology research. A series
of student demands that SRI
drop all war-related research
culminated in the May 1969 ar
rest of 14 students, who, along
with 400 other demonstrators,
tried to prevent SRI from open
ing its doors one morning. In
1970 the University Board of
Trustees granted SRI indepen
dence from the University. In
effect, "SRI bought itself from
itself," one spokesman at SRI
International said.
Presently, more than 2000
projects in 100 different discip
lines are underway at the insti
tute. SRI research on an ul
trasonic camera, which uses ul
trasonic sound waves to create
images of the internal human
anatomy on a television-type
screen "will undoubtedly"
make x-rays obsolete within
the next few years, the
spokesman said. The sound
devices can look at many diffe
rent parts of the body. One
small device, to be used in an
aindividual's stomach, can
scan the stomach walls to look
for pancreatic cancer. Another
device used on the neck can
search for atherosclerotic for
mations in arteries.
Telephone for deaf
Another project, a tele
phone for the deaf, will proba
*bly be available for public
purchase within a year, the
spokesman continued. Re
search on the device, a low
cost pocket-sized keyboard
terminal which hooks up to any
telephone, was funded by the
federal government. The de
vice has a small screen which

allows the deaf individual to
type words, transmitted to any
individual with an indentical
device. The device is expected
to give thousands of deaf
people the opportunity to con
verse by phone, the spokes
man said.
Though SRI does not have
the equipment or the interest
in manufacturing the products
its researchers invent, the insti
tute can "sell the rights" of an
invention to a manufacturing
company, who then makes and
markets the product. In such a
case, SRI usually receives roy
alty payments.
In addition to "inventions"
or products made at the insti
tute, researchers do a variety of
studies on policy questions.
Earthquake detection
The institute is currently
working on an earthquake
studyfortheGeological Survey
to determine whether abnor
mal animal behavior can be
used as an indicator to predict
the coming of a quake. SRI also
examines marketing problems
for private companies.
"Someone might ask us to de
termine how they can make
money selling widgets in Ja
pan," the spokesman said.
"We then research the issue
under discussion, trying to

come up with a solution to the
question." In the life sciences
area, SRI is currently testing
various chemical substances to
determine whether they are
cancer-causing. On projects
like these, often funded by the
environmental protection
agency, SRI issues a finished
report stating its findings.
Though most of SRl's re
search is government
sponsored, the institute will do
research for almost any indi
vidual or company. An indi
vidual goes to SRI with a pro
ject in mind that he would like
to see researched. Staff then
determines whether SRI has
the capability to perform the
project. SRI also determines
whether the area in question is
one in which the institute
wishes to do research. "We
have not done certain studies
on gambling because we just
didn't want to become in
volved. There are other areas
we won't pursue for research,"
the spokesman said. "Another
criteria is the proposal itself.
Will the individual or company
pay us enough to make it worth
our time to do the research?"
Many disciplines
SRl's researchers work in a
vast number of fields and dis
ciplines. When determining

the capability of a given pro
ject, SRI will match the project
of a potential client with a re
searcher in the area of exper
tise. The institute employs its
own team of researchers, but
individuals outside the insti
tute who wish to do research
there are sometimes accepted.
"Our strong reputation at
tracts most of the researchers.
We always have people apply
ing to work here. Sometimes a
project will be completed suc
cessfully and then others in the
field of that researcher will
want to come here to work, to
become part of the project or
just to continue work in the
same field," another spokes
man said.

SRI now occupies 70 acres,
employs 3000 people and con
trols an annual budget of
$113.9 million. Department of
Defense contracts amount to
26 percent of SRl's total re
venue; in i969, defense con
tracts amounted to 45 percent.
Research for non-military
branches of the government
accounts for 39 percent of SRl's
total revenue. SRI carries out
research for federal, state,
local, and foreign govern
ments.
Though many of SRl's in
struments and research tools
are large machines and com
plicated tools, SRI also boasts
the world's largest collection
of fleas and ticks.

Perhaps within the next year, deaf people will be able to hold a
telephone receiver and "talk." With a small pocket-sized keyboard,
the deaf individual types words, which are transmitted to a person at
another telephone with an identical device. Words light up on the
instrument's screen. Communication begins.

Perhaps within the next year, deaf people will be able to hold a
telephone receiver and "talk." With a small pocket-sized keyboard,
the deaf individual types words, which are transmitted to a person at
another telephone with an identical device. Words light up on the
instrument's screen. Communication begins.
A robot-like industrial arm
with an artificial eye and the
ability toassembleand weld in
tricate parts? An ultrasonic
camera which allows doctors
to view the complex inner
workings of human bodies
without x-rays? A telephone for
the deaf? These aren't the
futuristic creations of a science
fiction writer. In fact, each of
these devices is being de
veloped just a few miles from
the University campus at Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI) In
ternational in Menlo Park.
SRI International is an inde
pendent, non-profit organiza
tion that performs contract re
search for a variety of busines
ses, organizations and indi
viduals.
Protests
Established by the University
in 1946 to "aid and supplement
scientific research" here, SRI
became the focus of anti-war
demonstrations in the late '60s.
University students protesting
the war gathered evidence to
prove that SRI was involved in
counter-insurgency research,
chemical and biological war
fare research and explosives
technology research. A series
of student demands that SRI
drop all war-related research
culminated in the May 1969 ar
rest of 14 students, who, along
with 400 other demonstrators,
tried to prevent SRI from open
ing its doors one morning. In
1970 the University Board of
Trustees granted SRI indepen
dence from the University. In
effect, "SRI bought itself from
itself," one spokesman at SRI
International said.
Presently, more than 2000
projects in 100 different discip
lines are underway at the insti
tute. SRI research on an ul
trasonic camera, which uses ul
trasonic sound waves to create
images of the internal human
anatomy on a television-type
screen "will undoubtedly"
make x-rays obsolete within
the next few years, the
spokesman said. The sound
devices can look at many diffe
rent parts of the body. One
small device, to be used in an
aindividual's stomach, can
scan the stomach walls to look
for pancreatic cancer. Another
device used on the neck can
search for atherosclerotic for
mations in arteries.
Telephone for deaf
Another project, a tele
phone for the deaf, will proba
*bly be available for public
purchase within a year, the
spokesman continued. Re
search on the device, a low
cost pocket-sized keyboard
terminal which hooks up to any
telephone, was funded by the
federal government. The de
vice has a small screen which

allows the deaf individual to
type words, transmitted to any
individual with an indentical
device. The device is expected
to give thousands of deaf
people the opportunity to con
verse by phone, the spokes
man said.
Though SRI does not have
the equipment or the interest
in manufacturing the products
its researchers invent, the insti
tute can "sell the rights" of an
invention to a manufacturing
company, who then makes and
markets the product. In such a
case, SRI usually receives roy
alty payments.
In addition to "inventions"
or products made at the insti
tute, researchers do a variety of
studies on policy questions.
Earthquake detection
The institute is currently
working on an earthquake
studyfortheGeological Survey
to determine whether abnor
mal animal behavior can be
used as an indicator to predict
the coming of a quake. SRI also
examines marketing problems
for private companies.
"Someone might ask us to de
termine how they can make
money selling widgets in Ja
pan," the spokesman said.
"We then research the issue
under discussion, trying to

come up with a solution to the
question." In the life sciences
area, SRI is currently testing
various chemical substances to
determine whether they are
cancer-causing. On projects
like these, often funded by the
environmental protection
agency, SRI issues a finished
report stating its findings.
Though most of SRl's re
search is government
sponsored, the institute will do
research for almost any indi
vidual or company. An indi
vidual goes to SRI with a pro
ject in mind that he would like
to see researched. Staff then
determines whether SRI has
the capability to perform the
project. SRI also determines
whether the area in question is
one in which the institute
wishes to do research. "We
have not done certain studies
on gambling because we just
didn't want to become in
volved. There are other areas
we won't pursue for research,"
the spokesman said. "Another
criteria is the proposal itself.
Will the individual or company
pay us enough to make it worth
our time to do the research?"
Many disciplines
SRl's researchers work in a
vast number of fields and dis
ciplines. When determining

the capability of a given pro
ject, SRI will match the project
of a potential client with a re
searcher in the area of exper
tise. The institute employs its
own team of researchers, but
individuals outside the insti
tute who wish to do research
there are sometimes accepted.
"Our strong reputation at
tracts most of the researchers.
We always have people apply
ing to work here. Sometimes a
project will be completed suc
cessfully and then others in the
field of that researcher will
want to come here to work, to
become part of the project or
just to continue work in the
same field," another spokes
man said.

SRI now occupies 70 acres,
employs 3000 people and con
trols an annual budget of
$113.9 million. Department of
Defense contracts amount to
26 percent of SRl's total re
venue; in i969, defense con
tracts amounted to 45 percent.
Research for non-military
branches of the government
accounts for 39 percent of SRl's
total revenue. SRI carries out
research for federal, state,
local, and foreign govern
ments.
Though many of SRl's in
struments and research tools

man said.

SRI now occupies 70 acres,
employs 3000 people and con

$113.9 million. Department of
Defense contracts amount to
26 percent of SRl's total re
venue; in i969, defense con
tracts amounted to 45 percent.
Research for non-military
branches of the government
accounts for 39 percent of SRl's
total revenue. SRI carries out
research for federal, state,
local, and foreign govern
ments.
Though many of SRl's in

Perhaps within the next year, deaf people will be able to hold a
telephone receiver and "talk." With a small pocket-sized keyboard,
the deaf individual types words, which are transmitted to a person at
another telephone with an identical device. Words light up on the
instrument's screen. Communication begins.
A robot-like industrial arm
with an artificial eye and the
ability toassembleand weld in
tricate parts? An ultrasonic
camera which allows doctors
to view the complex inner
workings of human bodies
without x-rays? A telephone for
the deaf? These aren't the
futuristic creations of a science
fiction writer. In fact, each of
these devices is being de
veloped just a few miles from
the University campus at Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI) In
ternational in Menlo Park.
SRI International is an inde
pendent, non-profit organiza
tion that performs contract re
search for a variety of busines
ses, organizations and indi
viduals.
Protests
Established by the University
in 1946 to "aid and supplement
scientific research" here, SRI
became the focus of anti-war
demonstrations in the late '60s.
University students protesting
the war gathered evidence to
prove that SRI was involved in
counter-insurgency research,
chemical and biological war
fare research and explosives
technology research. A series
of student demands that SRI
drop all war-related research
culminated in the May 1969 ar
rest of 14 students, who, along
with 400 other demonstrators,
tried to prevent SRI from open
ing its doors one morning. In
1970 the University Board of
Trustees granted SRI indepen
dence from the University. In
effect, "SRI bought itself from
itself," one spokesman at SRI
International said.
Presently, more than 2000
projects in 100 different discip
lines are underway at the insti
tute. SRI research on an ul
trasonic camera, which uses ul
trasonic sound waves to create
images of the internal human
anatomy on a television-type
screen "will undoubtedly"
make x-rays obsolete within
the next few years, the
spokesman said. The sound
devices can look at many diffe
rent parts of the body. One
small device, to be used in an
aindividual's stomach, can
scan the stomach walls to look
for pancreatic cancer. Another
device used on the neck can
search for atherosclerotic for
mations in arteries.
Telephone for deaf
Another project, a tele
phone for the deaf, will proba
*bly be available for public
purchase within a year, the
spokesman continued. Re
search on the device, a low
cost pocket-sized keyboard
terminal which hooks up to any
telephone, was funded by the
federal government. The de
vice has a small screen which

allows the deaf individual to
type words, transmitted to any
individual with an indentical
device. The device is expected
to give thousands of deaf
people the opportunity to con
verse by phone, the spokes
man said.
Though SRI does not have
the equipment or the interest
in manufacturing the products
its researchers invent, the insti
tute can "sell the rights" of an
invention to a manufacturing
company, who then makes and
markets the product. In such a
case, SRI usually receives roy
alty payments.
In addition to "inventions"
or products made at the insti
tute, researchers do a variety of
studies on policy questions.
Earthquake detection
The institute is currently
working on an earthquake
studyfortheGeological Survey
to determine whether abnor
mal animal behavior can be
used as an indicator to predict
the coming of a quake. SRI also
examines marketing problems
for private companies.
"Someone might ask us to de
termine how they can make
money selling widgets in Ja
pan," the spokesman said.
"We then research the issue
under discussion, trying to

come up with a solution to the
question." In the life sciences
area, SRI is currently testing
various chemical substances to
determine whether they are
cancer-causing. On projects
like these, often funded by the
environmental protection
agency, SRI issues a finished
report stating its findings.
Though most of SRl's re
search is government
sponsored, the institute will do
research for almost any indi
vidual or company. An indi
vidual goes to SRI with a pro
ject in mind that he would like
to see researched. Staff then
determines whether SRI has
the capability to perform the
project. SRI also determines
whether the area in question is
one in which the institute
wishes to do research. "We
have not done certain studies
on gambling because we just
didn't want to become in
volved. There are other areas
we won't pursue for research,"
the spokesman said. "Another
criteria is the proposal itself.
Will the individual or company
pay us enough to make it worth
our time to do the research?"
Many disciplines
SRl's researchers work in a
vast number of fields and dis
ciplines. When determining

the capability of a given pro
ject, SRI will match the project
of a potential client with a re
searcher in the area of exper
tise. The institute employs its
own team of researchers, but
individuals outside the insti
tute who wish to do research
there are sometimes accepted.
"Our strong reputation at
tracts most of the researchers.
We always have people apply
ing to work here. Sometimes a
project will be completed suc
cessfully and then others in the
field of that researcher will
want to come here to work, to
become part of the project or
just to continue work in the
same field," another spokes
man said.
