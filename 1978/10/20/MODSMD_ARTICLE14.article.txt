Abortion groups
don't address
fundamental issue
The Daily has recently pub
lished three pieces favoring
abortion (notwithstanding the
fact that one was alleged to be a
news article). While we can
appreciate the anguish of the
most recent author over her
own experience, her column
was so filled with distortion
and misrepresentation that we
must reply. Since Ginny
Puddefoot (Daily, Oct. 13)
would have us "stand on the
force of our intellectual be
liefs," we shall confine our dis
cussion to the crucial issue,
omitting reference to much in
formation we could cite in
support of our position.
The first issue we must ad
dress, however, is vocabulary.
Puddefoot calls her position
"pro-choice" and its oppo
nents "a fanatic anti-choice
minority." We shall stick with
the more descriptive terms
"pro-abortion" and "anti
abortion."
Why the careful choice of
words? Because it is very im
portant to keep our discussion
as level-headed as we can.
Pro-abortion groups favor the
term "product of conception"
over "unborn child," for
example, to create the impres
sion that the occupant of the
womb is just another piece of
tissue, rather like a tumor. We
will use the term "fetus," both
for scientific accuracy and to
avoid more emotion-laden
terminology.
The central issue we must
address is the humanity of the
fetus. Everyone must agree
that it is alive: it grows, it
breathes, it feeds, it excretes.
Further, the living fetus is
genetically distinct from its
mother. We contend that the
fetus is, moreover, human.
And we do not accept the
proposition that its humanity
can be decided by the courts or
by public opinion polls: the
question of its humanity is a
moral one, answerable only
with reference to moral stan
dards.
To see that we must turn to
moral standards, we need only
consider the folly of govern
ment decisions in history. The
American Supreme Court
ruled only a little over one
hundred years ago that blacks
were not fully human. Who can
forget the atrocities of the
Nazis against the "less than
human" Jews? The courts may
decide what is legal, but not
what is moral.
We see a further irony in the
recent trend of the courts with
regard to child abuse. Only 10
years ago, parents' control
over their children was virtu
ally absolute: they almost had
to kill their children to be pro
secuted for any crime. Today,
there are laws to protect chil

dren from abuse by their pa
rents, as well as to protect
those who try to help battered
children. Yet the dignified,
honorable courts cannot see
how inconsistent their child
abuse decisions are with their
legalization of the ultimate
form of child abuse: abortion.
Finally, let us clear away one
charge often raised by pro
abortion groups: that this is a
Catholic issue. Strange, isn't it,
that this charge is not heard
when the Catholic bishops
speak out against repression of
civil liberties or the perpetua
tion of urban poverty. Of
course, those issues are
"safe."
All respectable people agree
that these things are wrong,
though they may not be
unanimous on matters of de
gree or kind. But understand,
and understand well, that the
same Spirit who inspires the
Catholic bishops to work for
human rights in these two
cases also compels them to cry
out against the moral outrage
of abortion.

Proud P.E. major
In answer to Loree Quis
morio's letter that P.E. majors
have no pride, I want her and
the entire campus body to
know that I am as close to a P.E.
major as one can get here
(majoring in Human Biology
with a physical fitness concent
ration) and I am very proud of
it!
I have taught several fitness
and weight control classes on
campus and at the Palo Alto
YMCA which has helped many
people not only feel and look
better but also feel better
about themselves.
What I do for these people is
a necessary and vital service for
their health. In the future I will
be opening fitness programs in
business and industry. I know
that someday I will be able to
look back upon my life and say
with pride that I have made
many people's lives better.

Affirmative action
story inaccurate
I hope the piece on affirma
tive action (Wednesday, Oc
tober 18, 1978, p. 2) is more
accurate in other respects than
it is about the Law School.
When your reporter called my
secretary, she told him I was

out of town, attending an invi
tational meeting on the Bakke
case. Hardly a vacation. The di
rector of admissions, Dora
Hjertberg, was on vacation,
due back October 16. Your re
porter was told this and said he
would be glad to call back then
about minority enrollments.
Apparently he did not do so.
I doubt that Dean of Stu
dents Harold Boyd is quoted
correctly, since no goals for
minority admission have ever
been set by the Law School fa
culty. The minority first-year
enrollments for the last four
years are: 1976 - 20; 1976 - 15;
1977 - 13; 1978 - 19.
We are especially pleased
with the increase in minority
enrollment this September.
