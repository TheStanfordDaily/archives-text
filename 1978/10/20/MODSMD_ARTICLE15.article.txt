## Shoppers in consumerland 
### 
The recent debate over the widening of
Sand Hill Road has led to widespread con
cern over such issues as traffic congestion
and access to Interstate 280. At the center of
this controversy is the Stanford Shopping
Center, whose recent remodeling and ex
pansion has created the need for improved
traffic access.
The Sand Hill Road issue has added yet
another chapter to the continuing saga of
shopping center development in this coun
try. The days of lemonade stands and malt
shops are memories of the past, and many
communities across the nation are quickly
realizing that the "mailing of America" has
indeed arrived.
Today, shopping centers represent a $60
billion industry and account for nearly one
half of all retail trade in the U.S. Large de
velopers have little trouble borrowing the $5
to $8 million necessary to build a regional
shopping center, and in 25 years, the failure
rate has been less than one percent.
This enormous capital investment in shop
ping malls has led to huge complexes con
taining four department stores and as many
as 80 smaller shops. However, in terms of
actual ownership, most of these businesses
may be the property of only 10 or 12 large
corporations. As Michael Murphy, general
manager of Mountain View's "Old Mill"
complex, recently told me, "I could put 65
stores together with just 10 phone calls."
A look at the corporate ownership tree
shows that Murphy isn't kidding. The popu
lar clothing stores of Foxmoor Casuals and
Chess King are owned by Melville Realty,
who also owns Thom McCann Shoes, Miles
Shoes and Vanguard Shoes, all outlets at
major regional shopping centers. Saks Fifth
Avenue and Gimbels are both owned by the
Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company of
Louisville. And the Stamford, Connecticut
firm of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Inc. owns
Waldenbooks, Broadway Department
Stores, Emporium Capwell Co., Neiman

Marcus, Weinstock's and Bergdorf Good
man. That's enough for a small shopping
center right there.
Of even greater interest in recent years has
been the investment by large industrial cor
porations such as Ford, Chrysler, General
Motors, and Alcoa in the burgeoning shop
ping center industry. As many of the large
cities in the Northeast and Midwest experi
ence outmigration of population and busi
ness, planners and corporations have been
seeking ways to revive the lagging central
city. The solution has been to take the subur
ban shopping mall concept and duplicate it in
the inner city. Instead of having the mall
serve as the city, the city becomes the mall.
Thus, cities such as Boston, Chicago and
Philadelphia have seen the construction of
large, enclosed shopping and office com
plexes in the central city. The largest of these
can be found in Detroit, where a huge com
plex of office buildings, shops and a hotel has
been constructed on a 33 acre site.
Grandly named "Renaissance Center," this
edifice represents a $337 million gamble by
private enterprise that the "megastructure"
can lure the crime-weary suburban middle
class back to Detroit.
Will the gamble work? If past shopping
mall success in the suburbs is any indication,
it probably will. These large regional shop
ping centers depend heavily on "impulse
buying," that part of human nature in all of us
that leads us blindly into consumerland and
makes it easy for us to buy goods.that we may
not want or need.
Perhaps this can best be summed up by the
story of an editorial writer for Esquire who
went into a shopping mall in Honolulu to buy
a newspaper. When the writer came out, she
hadn't bought a paper at all. Instead, she had
purchased two straw hats, four bottles of nail
enamel, caramel corn and a toaster. Flying
back across the Pacific, she regretted only the
toaster.
