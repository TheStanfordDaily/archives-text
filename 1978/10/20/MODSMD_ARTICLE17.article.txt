## Stanford should consider a new motto 
### 
Harvard's is simple and direct: Ver
itas (truth). Vale, never one to be out
done by its rival, has added Lux (light).
A Quaker school I visited has a fascinat
ing one: "Mind the Light."
In all probability, it was "Mind: the
Light"; but to me it evoked the image of
a stern Quaker schoolmarm whose
students left kerosene lamps burning
ail over the place: "Mind the light!"
Cornell's, however, surpasses them all,
in length if for no other reason: "I
would found an institution where any
person can find instruction in any
study."
All right, class, take out a piece of
paper; this is a quiz. Put your books
away. No, you may not use pencil. The
first and only question is: What is Stan
ford University's official motto?
Those* who answer this question fall
into one of four categories. A lot of
people don't even know that the Uni
versity has a motto. A second group
knows that it is something like "The
trees blow in the wind," or "The wind
blows in freedom," but don't know the
exact translation or original wording. A
third, still rarer, group can cite the
German: Die Luft der Freiheit weht.
And a fourth group, the true intellec

tual elite, can tell you that it comes from
Schiller, via Goethe (or perhaps it is
Goethe, via Schiller; I am not a member
of this last group).
The point is that Stanford's motto
does not play a major role in the life —
academic or otherwise — of the Uni
versity. This became clear to me when I
called to obtain its exact wording and a
list of the seals on which it appeared.
Once my call had been transferred a
few times, I was put on "hold" while a
secretary in the president's office went
to look up the information. Ten mi
nutes later, she returned, having lo
cated it in a file. "According to the 1947
Alumni Review," she said, "it appears
only on the President's Seal. But we
don't have any information more cur
rent." She then read the motto, spel
ling out the words because she could
not pronounce the German.
So Stanford has a motto, but few
people know what it is; and of those,
not all can pronounce it. It is time, I
submit, to choose a new one. Should
anyone claim that it is not legitimate for
a University to change mottoes in
midstream, I can point to the University
of Pennsylvania. Heroriginal mottowas
Literae sine moribus vanae — scholar

ship without character is worthless.
By 1960, however, character had be
come less important in the eyes of the
university; certainly less important
than scholarship. So the motto was
changed to Leges sine moribus . . .laws
without character are worthless.
Our new motto must be Simple and
direct. It must say "Stanford" to all who
hear it. And, with all respect to the in
habitants of Haus Mitteleuropa, it must
be in Latin.
Why Latin? Well, Latin is pronounce
able by most people. It has long been
associated with learning. Some people
even claim that it "develops the mind."
Perhaps our (Latin) motto should be
Biblical as well, or at least invoke the
name of God. Stanford, after all, needs
all the help it can get. Brown Universi
ty's motto is In Deo Speramus — our
hope is in God. And Johns Hopkins is
Veritas Vos Liberabit, the truth will
make you free. Free, as their chaplain
often proclaims, from such things as
God and prayer; nonetheless they can
not entirely forgetthat the sameperson
who said "the truth will make you free"
also said "I am the truth."
And so to the mottoes. All of them are
in Latin; and all reflect, in my opinion,

the true spirit of Stanford. First, a bow
to our noble administration: In Char
tifacientibus Spes Nostra: Our hope
lies in the making of papers. Yes, you
say, but what about the students?
Surely our motto should speak of their
hopes and aspirations. True enough.
Thus: Divitiae, Potentia, Condicio
(Wealth, Power, Position).
Or, in the California spirit, Quod
Proprium Tui Fac (Do your own thing).
And, to go with that one, Cui Animum
Intendes — or, in the vulgar tongue,
"What are you into?" Finally, here is
one which speaks of the true concern
of all who come to Stanford: the body;
Non Vestem Amant Sed Vestis Fartim:
It's not the clothes that (lovers) admire;
it's what's inside them.
So you don't care for any of these?
Very well. My last offering is sure to
please you. It is short and resonant; it is
simple; it is even Biblical. We can emb
lazon it on our T-shirts, we can print it
on the covers of our catalogues, and we
can wrap it around our seals — Presi
dential or otherwise. The only thing we
can't do is translate it: Caro Autem In
firma.
