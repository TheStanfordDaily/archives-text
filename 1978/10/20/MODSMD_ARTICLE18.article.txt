## Commercial uses of airspace more important 
### 
Allan Franks unfortunately
misread my Oct. 3 proposal for
increasing air safety over Stan
ford and Palo Alto. His criti
cisms (Daily, Oct. 6) depict me
as extending this proposal to
include much of the nation. I
suggested no such thing. In
stead, I explicitly limited my
proposal to local airspace be
cause:
1) The much-used jet des
cent corridor extending east
ward from Skyline and inter
cepting the final approach path
up the bay to San Francisco air
port (SFO) is a special case. It's
unique because the actual

paths flown by descending
jumbo jets dangerously slip
below the strictly monitored
Terminal Control Area (TCA).
Restrictions on private flying
below this corridor could serve
as a useful pilot study to see if
they were practical on a larger
scale. They would also alleviate
several hazards.
2) My data is based on ob
servations over several years
limited to this descent cor
ridor.
3) Although the San Diego
crash is presumptive evidence
of airspace overcrowding, I
have no basis forsuggesting re
forms beyond Stanford-Palo
Alto.
By labeling as "ridiculous"
my intent to limit analysis to
local flying hazards, Franks re
veals a lack of data to rebut my
allegation that private, military
and commercial aircraft are
crowding Stanford-Palo Alto
airspace. I certainly sym
pathize with his plea that
thousands of small private air
craft owners nationally may
suffer increased controls as a
result of San Diego.
The vexing problem is that
something has to give. The
numbers of commercial, milit
ary and private flights aregrow
ing in urban areas with limited
airspace. As congestion
around major airports in
creases, so will the number of
near-misses and collisions de
spite everyone's best efforts to
avoid them.
The carrying capacity of
Peninsula airspace is the key
issue I tried to raise. Franks ad
dressed the practical tradeoff
of increased controls vs.
number of passengers killed
per million air miles flown; the
issue here is how safe is safe
enough? Taken together, our
arguments raise still a third is
sue: how fast are safety limits
deteriorating as air traffic in
creases?
That our local airspace is ap
proaching saturation should
be evident after a quick look at
a map. First, five airports share
this space: San Carlos, Palo
Alto, Moffett and San Jose.
Second, many commercial jets
from the south, west and north
are vectored into the corridor
which begins over Skyline and
descends over Palo Alto. Jets
on this west-to-east heading
must have airspace close
enough to the ground through
which to descend safely to in
tercept the 2000-ft. final ap

proach path up the bay.
But the Skyline corridor
must also be gradual enough
so that descending jets do not
build up excessive airspeed.
The corridor is optimal and
fixed: it cannot be shifted to
the south without interferring
with Moffett and San )ose
flights. A northward shift
would shorten the final ap
proach path to SFO and deny
pilots adequate time to estab
lish landing configuration.

The vexing problem
is that something
has to give.

Third, the TCA protecting
Stanford-Palo Alto airspace
above 4000 feet only prescribes
controls for aircraft flying
above that altitude. By itself,
the TCA does not require all
descending commercial jets to
stay above 4000 feet. For
reasons I detailed in the Oct. 3
article, more than a few slip
below the 4000-ft. minimum
into uncontrolled airspace fre
quented by private aircraft.
The "see and be seen" rule is
useless here because of in
adequate downward visibility
of descending jets and re
duced upward visibility of
high-wing private aircraft.
These and other hazards invite
consideration of a small prohi
bited flying area below the
Skyline corridor.
Photographs of radar dis
plays might persuade FAA in
vestigators but would also re
quire that already overloaded
radar operators further divide
their attention. Franks himself
admits that the real-time
monitoring capability of the
present system is limited.
A less expensive solution
would be to add 1500 feet to
the underside of the TCA over
Skyline and Woodside so that
traffic is controlled down to
2500 feet. Another would be to
ban all private flying from a
small, square Stanford-Palo
Alto airspace six miles on a side
directly beneath the Skyline
corridor.
Rather than costly monitor
ing systems, all that would be
needed would be for flight
planning charts, handbooks
and procedures to emphasize
the prohibited flying area. En
forcement would be easy: re
cord the time, location and de
scription of any violating air

craft and register a complaint
with FAA.
Franks' plea that this would
disrupt private aviation merely
confirms how frequently this
airspace is used and the mag
nitude of the hazard. Instead,
the ban will require local flights
to detour around the prohi
bited area, a few minutes' in
convenience at most. Local
training flights will find other,
less crowded airspaces to the
east over Livermore and west
over the ocean.
Franks' suggestion that
well-defined approach cor
ridors be established is well
taken. The final approach path
to SFO up the Bay is one such
protected corridor. If we ex
tend his proposal to create ad
ditional corridors perpendicu
lar to final approach path and
enveloping the descent path
over Skyline, Stanford and Palo
Alto, then only the small pro
hibited area underneath dis
tinguishes his proposal from
mine.
Franks is also correct that my
proposal reduces private fliers'
access to crowded airspaces.

But the airspace foregone is
very small in exchange for
safety benefits accrued, even
after the inconvenience of de
tours is considered. In arguing
against airspace restructions,
Franks fails to recognize that
accident risks are dispropor
tionately allocated to airlines
and airline passengers: a colli
sion involving one private and
one commercial aircraft kills
two private fliers and a
hundred or more commercial
travelers and their crew.
Although there are more pri
vate aircraft than airliners, as
Franks points out, there were
more than 240 million com
mercial passenger departures
last year, compared with less
than three million departures
by private passengers and
pilots. Clearly, any attempt to
balance equally private and
commercial rights to airspace
must disregard these statistics.

forcement would be easy: re
cord the time, location and de
scription of any violating air

craft and register a complaint
with FAA.
Franks' plea that this would
disrupt private aviation merely
confirms how frequently this
airspace is used and the mag
nitude of the hazard. Instead,
the ban will require local flights
to detour around the prohi
bited area, a few minutes' in
convenience at most. Local
training flights will find other,
less crowded airspaces to the
east over Livermore and west
over the ocean.
Franks' suggestion that
well-defined approach cor
ridors be established is well
taken. The final approach path
to SFO up the Bay is one such
protected corridor. If we ex
tend his proposal to create ad
ditional corridors perpendicu
lar to final approach path and
enveloping the descent path
over Skyline, Stanford and Palo
Alto, then only the small pro
hibited area underneath dis
tinguishes his proposal from
mine.
Franks is also correct that my
proposal reduces private fliers'
access to crowded airspaces.

But the airspace foregone is
very small in exchange for
safety benefits accrued, even
after the inconvenience of de
tours is considered. In arguing
against airspace restructions,
Franks fails to recognize that
accident risks are dispropor
tionately allocated to airlines
and airline passengers: a colli
sion involving one private and
one commercial aircraft kills
two private fliers and a
hundred or more commercial
travelers and their crew.
Although there are more pri
vate aircraft than airliners, as
Franks points out, there were
more than 240 million com
mercial passenger departures
last year, compared with less
than three million departures
by private passengers and
pilots. Clearly, any attempt to
balance equally private and
commercial rights to airspace
must disregard these statistics.

Allan Franks unfortunately
misread my Oct. 3 proposal for
increasing air safety over Stan
ford and Palo Alto. His criti
cisms (Daily, Oct. 6) depict me
as extending this proposal to
include much of the nation. I
suggested no such thing. In
stead, I explicitly limited my
proposal to local airspace be
cause:
1) The much-used jet des
cent corridor extending east
ward from Skyline and inter
cepting the final approach path
up the bay to San Francisco air
port (SFO) is a special case. It's
unique because the actual

paths flown by descending
jumbo jets dangerously slip
below the strictly monitored
Terminal Control Area (TCA).
Restrictions on private flying
below this corridor could serve
as a useful pilot study to see if
they were practical on a larger
scale. They would also alleviate
several hazards.
2) My data is based on ob
servations over several years
limited to this descent cor
ridor.
3) Although the San Diego
crash is presumptive evidence
of airspace overcrowding, I
have no basis forsuggesting re
forms beyond Stanford-Palo
Alto.
By labeling as "ridiculous"
my intent to limit analysis to
local flying hazards, Franks re
veals a lack of data to rebut my
allegation that private, military
and commercial aircraft are
crowding Stanford-Palo Alto
airspace. I certainly sym
pathize with his plea that
thousands of small private air
craft owners nationally may
suffer increased controls as a
result of San Diego.
The vexing problem is that
something has to give. The
numbers of commercial, milit
ary and private flights aregrow
ing in urban areas with limited
airspace. As congestion
around major airports in
creases, so will the number of
near-misses and collisions de
spite everyone's best efforts to
avoid them.
The carrying capacity of
Peninsula airspace is the key
issue I tried to raise. Franks ad
dressed the practical tradeoff
of increased controls vs.
number of passengers killed
per million air miles flown; the
issue here is how safe is safe
enough? Taken together, our
arguments raise still a third is
sue: how fast are safety limits
deteriorating as air traffic in
creases?
That our local airspace is ap
proaching saturation should
be evident after a quick look at
a map. First, five airports share
this space: San Carlos, Palo
Alto, Moffett and San Jose.
Second, many commercial jets
from the south, west and north
are vectored into the corridor
which begins over Skyline and
descends over Palo Alto. Jets
on this west-to-east heading
must have airspace close
enough to the ground through
which to descend safely to in
tercept the 2000-ft. final ap

proach path up the bay.
But the Skyline corridor
must also be gradual enough
so that descending jets do not
build up excessive airspeed.
The corridor is optimal and
fixed: it cannot be shifted to
the south without interferring
with Moffett and San )ose
flights. A northward shift
would shorten the final ap
proach path to SFO and deny
pilots adequate time to estab
lish landing configuration.

The vexing problem
is that something
has to give.

Third, the TCA protecting
Stanford-Palo Alto airspace
above 4000 feet only prescribes
controls for aircraft flying
above that altitude. By itself,
the TCA does not require all
descending commercial jets to
stay above 4000 feet. For
reasons I detailed in the Oct. 3
article, more than a few slip
below the 4000-ft. minimum
into uncontrolled airspace fre
quented by private aircraft.
The "see and be seen" rule is
useless here because of in
adequate downward visibility
of descending jets and re
duced upward visibility of
high-wing private aircraft.
These and other hazards invite
consideration of a small prohi
bited flying area below the
Skyline corridor.
Photographs of radar dis
plays might persuade FAA in
vestigators but would also re
quire that already overloaded
radar operators further divide
their attention. Franks himself
admits that the real-time
monitoring capability of the
present system is limited.
A less expensive solution
would be to add 1500 feet to
the underside of the TCA over
Skyline and Woodside so that
traffic is controlled down to
2500 feet. Another would be to
ban all private flying from a
small, square Stanford-Palo
Alto airspace six miles on a side
directly beneath the Skyline
corridor.
Rather than costly monitor
ing systems, all that would be
needed would be for flight
planning charts, handbooks
and procedures to emphasize
the prohibited flying area. En
forcement would be easy: re
cord the time, location and de
scription of any violating air

craft and register a complaint
with FAA.

tercept the 2000-ft. final ap

proach path up the bay.
But the Skyline corridor
must also be gradual enough
so that descending jets do not
build up excessive airspeed.
The corridor is optimal and
fixed: it cannot be shifted to
the south without interferring
with Moffett and San )ose
flights. A northward shift
would shorten the final ap
proach path to SFO and deny
pilots adequate time to estab
lish landing configuration.

The vexing problem
is that something
has to give.

Third, the TCA protecting
Stanford-Palo Alto airspace
above 4000 feet only prescribes
controls for aircraft flying
above that altitude. By itself,
the TCA does not require all
descending commercial jets to
stay above 4000 feet. For
reasons I detailed in the Oct. 3
article, more than a few slip
below the 4000-ft. minimum
into uncontrolled airspace fre
quented by private aircraft.
The "see and be seen" rule is
useless here because of in
adequate downward visibility
of descending jets and re
duced upward visibility of
high-wing private aircraft.
These and other hazards invite
consideration of a small prohi
bited flying area below the
Skyline corridor.
Photographs of radar dis
plays might persuade FAA in
vestigators but would also re
quire that already overloaded
radar operators further divide
their attention. Franks himself
admits that the real-time
monitoring capability of the
present system is limited.
A less expensive solution
would be to add 1500 feet to
the underside of the TCA over
Skyline and Woodside so that
traffic is controlled down to
2500 feet. Another would be to
ban all private flying from a
small, square Stanford-Palo
Alto airspace six miles on a side
directly beneath the Skyline
corridor.
Rather than costly monitor
ing systems, all that would be
needed would be for flight
planning charts, handbooks
and procedures to emphasize
the prohibited flying area. En
forcement would be easy: re
cord the time, location and de
scription of any violating air

craft and register a complaint
with FAA.
Franks' plea that this would
disrupt private aviation merely
confirms how frequently this
airspace is used and the mag
nitude of the hazard. Instead,
the ban will require local flights
to detour around the prohi
bited area, a few minutes' in
convenience at most. Local
training flights will find other,
less crowded airspaces to the
east over Livermore and west
over the ocean.
Franks' suggestion that
well-defined approach cor
ridors be established is well
taken. The final approach path
to SFO up the Bay is one such
protected corridor. If we ex
tend his proposal to create ad
ditional corridors perpendicu
lar to final approach path and
enveloping the descent path
over Skyline, Stanford and Palo
Alto, then only the small pro
hibited area underneath dis
tinguishes his proposal from
mine.
Franks is also correct that my
proposal reduces private fliers'
access to crowded airspaces.

But the airspace foregone is
very small in exchange for
safety benefits accrued, even
after the inconvenience of de
tours is considered. In arguing
against airspace restructions,
Franks fails to recognize that
accident risks are dispropor
tionately allocated to airlines
and airline passengers: a colli
sion involving one private and
one commercial aircraft kills
two private fliers and a
hundred or more commercial
travelers and their crew.
Although there are more pri
vate aircraft than airliners, as
Franks points out, there were
more than 240 million com
mercial passenger departures
last year, compared with less
than three million departures
by private passengers and
pilots. Clearly, any attempt to
balance equally private and
commercial rights to airspace
must disregard these statistics.

Allan Franks unfortunately
misread my Oct. 3 proposal for
increasing air safety over Stan
ford and Palo Alto. His criti
cisms (Daily, Oct. 6) depict me
as extending this proposal to
include much of the nation. I
suggested no such thing. In
stead, I explicitly limited my
proposal to local airspace be
cause:
1) The much-used jet des
cent corridor extending east
ward from Skyline and inter
cepting the final approach path
up the bay to San Francisco air
port (SFO) is a special case. It's
unique because the actual

paths flown by descending
jumbo jets dangerously slip
below the strictly monitored
Terminal Control Area (TCA).
Restrictions on private flying
below this corridor could serve
as a useful pilot study to see if
they were practical on a larger
scale. They would also alleviate
several hazards.
2) My data is based on ob
servations over several years
limited to this descent cor
ridor.
3) Although the San Diego
crash is presumptive evidence
of airspace overcrowding, I
have no basis forsuggesting re
forms beyond Stanford-Palo
Alto.
By labeling as "ridiculous"
my intent to limit analysis to
local flying hazards, Franks re
veals a lack of data to rebut my
allegation that private, military
and commercial aircraft are
crowding Stanford-Palo Alto
airspace. I certainly sym
pathize with his plea that
thousands of small private air
craft owners nationally may
suffer increased controls as a
result of San Diego.
The vexing problem is that
something has to give. The
numbers of commercial, milit
ary and private flights aregrow
ing in urban areas with limited
airspace. As congestion
around major airports in
creases, so will the number of
near-misses and collisions de
spite everyone's best efforts to
avoid them.
The carrying capacity of
Peninsula airspace is the key
issue I tried to raise. Franks ad
dressed the practical tradeoff
of increased controls vs.
number of passengers killed
per million air miles flown; the
issue here is how safe is safe
enough? Taken together, our
arguments raise still a third is
sue: how fast are safety limits
deteriorating as air traffic in
creases?
That our local airspace is ap
proaching saturation should
be evident after a quick look at
a map. First, five airports share
this space: San Carlos, Palo
Alto, Moffett and San Jose.
Second, many commercial jets
from the south, west and north
are vectored into the corridor
which begins over Skyline and
descends over Palo Alto. Jets
on this west-to-east heading
must have airspace close
enough to the ground through
which to descend safely to in
tercept the 2000-ft. final ap

proach path up the bay.
But the Skyline corridor
must also be gradual enough
so that descending jets do not
build up excessive airspeed.
