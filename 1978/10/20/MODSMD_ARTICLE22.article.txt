# Help Center here counsels faculty, staff

"Brilliant," said one indi
vidual in describing the Stan
ford Help Center. Although
most who have used the
facility were not so lavish in
their praise, the University's
faculty-staff counseling ser
vice receives commenda
tions from the majority of
those who take advantage of
the facility.
The Stanford Help Center
provides professional coun
seling services to faculty,
staff and their families on a
voluntary, non-fee basis.
"The center offers counsel
ing on any topic a visitor
wishes to explore," Dr.
David Kaplan, director of the
center and professor in clini
cal social services here, said.
Kaplan and two licensed
social workers who work at
the center, Linn Hayes and
Mary O'Connor, ideally
want the Help Center "to as
sume the role of an informal
friendly advice clinic, a place
to take one's personal prob
lems before those problems
can take root and ripen into
chronic psychological infir
mities."
Kaplan said the center's
service has several notable

qualities such as a "monthly
check-back that the center
runs on patrons to assure a
lasting solution toproblems;
the lack of pressure con
nected with the facility, and
the voluntary nature of the
program. People come here
when they want to."
The models for the Help
Center are the employee
counseling facilities pre
sently being used exten
sively in industrial firms. But
while these function mainly
as a means of forcibly con
trolling alcoholism and simi
lar problems among work
ers, the University's center
"deals with a whole range of
problems," Hayes said.
The center opened as a
pilot project at the University
Medical Center. "About five
years ago," Kaplan said, "we
opened a volunteer prog
ram. When our pet project
failed due to severe financial
limitations, campus interest
promoted administrative
concern."
Now the University fi
nances the program. "Stan
ford is the only West Coast
university to sponsor such a
program. Such early action is
a credit to the institution's
concern for its employees,"

Kaplan added
Assisting the three
member staff is a 16-member
advisory board which Kaplan
and associates value as a
"means of interpreting the
center's efficiency and of
keeping a pulse on the
community," he said. The
advisory board has, in past
months, said that the center
lacks publicity. Board mem
bers have worked with the
staff to increase outreach ef
forts.
Evaluation forms of par
ticipants provide another
tangible means of evaluating
community response to the
center. Those surveyed usu
ally commended the prog
ram's "open forum" and
"structured confrontation of
problems."
One patron felt the Help
Center was "most effective
as a referral to outside agen
cies and that the counseling
was not terribly incisive."
Because the center only
offers counseling to persons
with problems of a "tempor
ary nature, not longer than
three months duration,"
some individuals are refer
red to other sources for
further counseling. Some
criticize this aspect of the

center's expansion in the near
agonizing prospect of
switching counselors and
starting all over again," did
not appeal to some patrons
with long-term problems.
Many patrons, however,
have filed requests for the
center's expansion in th near
future. Others say the center
should offer short-term
group sessions dealing with
certain topics of concern to
faculty and staff. Topics such
as living as a single adult and
acting as a single parent are
among the topics men
tioned. Alcoholism, pre
retirement and marital stress
are other topics suggested
for small group sessions.
The center currently deals
only minimally with prob
lems of alcoholism and drug
abuse among employees
here, but Hayes said the
center "has only touched the
tip of the iceburg. We think
many of these problems will
surface here in the coming
years."
Among those who have vi
sited the center, only five
percent have been faculty
members. The rest are on
the University's administra
tive and clerical staff.
