# University Mailing Service handles 'huge' mail volume
## 
### BILL FOX 
Do you remember that day
long ago when a white en
velope bearing a red tree in
signia landed in your mailbox,
possibly altering your life?
When you paused in pious si
lence to thank your lucky stars
and the admissions dean him
self, did you stop to thank the
University Mailing Service
which sent you that letter in the
first place?
In the last six months, the
mailing service has processed
704,335 pieces of mail.
Each year the University, the
largest bulk mailer in the Palo
Alto area, spends around
$700,000 in postage. The mail
ing service spends the largest
proportion of this total, bet
ween 30 and 40 percent. Post
age on mail sent by students,
and some schools on campus
comprise the rest of the figure,
according to Jim Keating, mail
ing service supervisor. The
mailing service owns a number
of machines designed to make
mail sorting and stamping
easier. For instance, the Che
shire machine, a labeling de
vice, can apply five million
computer-made labels a year,
Keating said.
In February 1976, the mailing
service stopped servicing in
coming mail due to the difficul
ties of "tracking down hard
to-find people," Keating said.
Although the mailing service
now handles out-going mail
exclusively, they occasionally
play sleuth, Kealing said. Occa
sionally, mailing service
employees spot errors in the
copy of a letter being mailed
out. For example, this year the
admissions office sent out a
survey to all incoming
freshmen, the class of '82. But
every envelope was instead
addressed to the individual,
class of '81.
Though the mailing service is
a large-scale mechanized op
eration, even the most impres
sive machines are run by
human beings which "give the
mail room a very friendly at
mosphere."

"We do so many interesting
things here, so many different
things. That's why I like this
job," Edith Peck, mailing ser
vice employee since 1956, said.
Peck recalled one instance in
which the mail service disco
vered some Chistmas cards
mailed by the University which
had been left at the bottom of a
U.S. Postal service mail bag.
"We finally found them in Ap
ril," she said.
Anne Keating, another
employee, said the most in
triguing part of her job is look
ing at the overwhelming
number of names on lists, en
velopes and boxes. "You do
get to wonder about the per
sonalities of all these people,"

Keating said. "It's not really
boring. Interesting names
break the monotony."
The main purposes of the
mailing service are to sort and
label bulk mail from University
departments and to meter the
mail. Metering mail involves
receiving the mail from given
University departments and
then assessing the proper
postage for each letter or par
cel. The metering department
handles from 2000 to 3000
pieces of mail daily.
The University mailing ser
vice is presently located be
hind Reprographics Services in
Building 560. From seven to 12
workers run the University
owned service daily.
