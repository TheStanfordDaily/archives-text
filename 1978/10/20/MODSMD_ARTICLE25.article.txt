# Cards, Cougars square-off
## 
### IVAN MAISEL 
Like a boxer who staggers up twice after
being kayoed from the blindside, the Stan
ford Cardinals get in the ring with the
Washington State Cougars tomorrow af
ternoon in Pullman.
Those sneaky punches were delivered
one-two by UCLA and Washington. Both
losses came on last-minute field goals, and
both were a result of mistakes that good
teams rarely make: interceptions, blocked
punts, holding penalties and missed pas
ses.
"We don't have an excuse, just an exp
lanation," Stanford head coach Bill Walsh
said. But if there's an explanation, there's a
remedy, and Walsh and his coaching staff
have been filling prescriptions all week.
The most glaring deficiency was the
punting game. More than one coach has
said the key to winning games is strong
kicking ana coach Walsh has begun to
make the changes he feels are necessary to
give the team a good punting game.
"Ken Naber will be punting this week,"
Walsh said. "He is getting it off quicker
and occasionally further than Brad Fox."
Walsh emphasized that the punter was
not the root of all evil, though.
"There have been missed assignments,
and our blockers have not been holding
their blocks for long enough."
Walsh has been plugging holes in his
special teams with his first-line players,
and this week, he is using his best plugs.
"Gordy Ceresino will be the fullback in
the punting formation," Walsh said. In
addition to Ceresino, starting left guard
Paul Hibler will play on the kickoff team.
The special teams line-up reads like the
starting lineup: Pat Bowe, Marty Smith,
Cordy Banks, Ken Margerum, and now,
Cordy Ceresino and Paul Hibler.
With all the front-line players playing on
the special teams, the question of fatigue
becomes crucial. Wasn't that the argu
ment against one-platoon football? If all
your best players play most of the game,
the fourth quarter could turn into a disas

ter. Nobody plays well when they are
tired, and nobody knows that better than
Walsh.
"It could become a factor," Walsh ad
mitted. "However, in choosing the men
for the special teams, we have picked
those with the most endurance and the
most intensity."
Stanford has lost their last two games in
excruciating fashion. A break here or there
turns a 3-3 team into a 5-1 team (and a Rose
Bowl contender) rather quickly. It would
be rather easy for the Cards to lose con
centration, and just "play out the string."
Not so fast, Buster.
Walsh quickly assures everyone that in
tensity will not be lacking from this week's
game. Morale will be the least of the
Cards' worries.
"There hasn't been one intimation of a
letdown on this team. We've worked hard
all week," Walsh said.
There is no room for a slip against WSU.
The Cougars boast an offense which grabs
386.6 yards of turf per game. At the helm of
the offense is the Throwin' Samoan, senior
Jack Thompson. Thompson, a bona-fide
Heisman Trophy candidate, has directed
the WSU offense to 221 yards through the
air. His favorite targets are junior fullback
Tali Ena (17 catches, 204 yds., 3 TDs) and
sophomore split end Mike Wilson (16
catches, 232 yds., 1 TD).
Stanford's pass defense ranks second in
the Pac-10, but you can't give up yards
through the air when no one throws
against you.
The Cards opening game set the tone for
the season. Oklahoma, a Big Eight team,
only passed for 121 yards. Of course, the
Big Eight has not heard of the wonders of
the modern-day forward pass. Neither has
the Big Ten, from whence opponent no. 3,
Illinois, came. This week promises some
thing different.
"Thompson is a fine passer," Walsh un
derstated. "Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson will see considerable duty
alongside Robby Chapman and Rick

Parker in the defensive backfield. We will
platoon for the pass, with Steve Foley and
John Pigott in for the run.
"The key to stopping their passing
game," Walsh continued, "is putting pres
sure on the passer, and how much penet
ration we can get inside their offensive
line."
Applying pressure to the quarterback is
the job of the outside linebackers. The
starters for Stanford are Tom Hall and Milt
McColl, and along with backup Terry Re
nnaker, they have six sacks between them.
"They play an excellent style of offen
sive football," Walsh continued. "They
gave UCLA fits."
Washington State scored 31 points on
UCLA's defense, racking up 484 yards of
total offense.
The Cardinals have racked up quite im
pressive statistics of their own on offense
(435.2 yds. total offense per game).
Coupled with the fact that Washington
State's defense ranks tenth (that is tenth as
in dead last) in the conference, those
sounds are Darrin Nelson licking his
chops, or Cougar head coach Jim Walden
crying.
When asked what you do in a situation
like his team will be in Saturday, Walden
answered, "You don't sleep good."
"We know we're not a great defense,"
Walden said. ''Our problem is a lack of
consistency. We have two good plays and
two bad, three good and two bad."
The Stanford offensive machine should
crank it out Saturday, the only disconcert
ing thing being the prqspect of a hostile
crowd. It helped to beat the Cards at
UCLA, and it will be a factor, tomorrow.
"We haven't played at home since the
students arrived," Walden said. "We are a
student-oriented campus, and I think the
players are more excited than me."
It would seem that the Cards will spoil
that welcome. If they don't, the welcome
the Cards will get when they arrive home
will be more inhospitable than what they
got in Pullman.

against Washington last week in the heartbreaking 34-31 loss the Cards endured at the hands of the
Huskies.
