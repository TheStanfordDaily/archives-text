# Nye tries pro-found predictions
## 
### 
Arjay Miller is the dean of the Stan
ford School of Business but the big man
around the Biz School is doctoral stu
dent Blaine Nye. The 6-foot-4 Nye
played nine years for,the Dallas Cow
boys before retiring f(pm the World
Champions prior to the beginning of
last season.
He retired at the peak of his career to
spend more time with his family and to
finish his Ph.D. in Business, bringing
his number of graduate degrees to
three.
The Daily, however, has brought him
temporarily out of retirement to add a
dimension of grid expertise to our
weekly football picks.
I don't know much about Oregon but
Washington used up their entire sea
son's quota of good luck last "weak"
against us: Oregon 17, Washington 14.
USC 35, OSU 21: You gotta go with
the "pros."
Beating yourself for an extended
period builds tremendous inner ten
sion (according to Masters and
Johnson). The Indians will clobber the
Cougars: Stanford 42, WSU 17.
Brawn over beauty anytime (except in
the back seat of a parked car): Cal 21,
UCLA 17.
I've been "pissin' in the wind" for the
last two weeks. Every team I've rooted
for, including the Indians, the Dodgers
and both my kids' soccer teams, has
lost. This week I've got a feeling the
wind is gonna shift.


Blaine Nye and Blaine Jr.
