# Scotchers stun Aggies in 6-0 rout
## 
### SHARON SILVERSTEIN 
The Stanford field hockey
team upped its conference re
cord to 3-1 with a 6-0 rout of
UC-Davis, Wednesday on the
road.
"The team played as I hoped
it would," said coach Barbara
Longstreth. "We showed the
ability to dominate a team we
should beat by maintaining
constant offensive pressure."
After tying Davis last year in a
match "we should have won,"
according to captain Amanda
Read, the team was emotion
ally charged for the contest.
Electricity was in the air
throughout as the wired Card
offense fired 51 shots on goal,
while allowing the Aggies only
one.
A strong midfield was the
key to victory, accounting for
four goals and two assists. The
3-3-3-1 alignment allowed the

Cards to attack successfully
from every position except
sweeper and goalie.
Classic passing leading to
the second goal was the
epitome of offensive team
play. After an interception by
link Sukie Jackson at the 30, the
Cards moved the ball upfield
with a series of 2V-1s (draw
passes where two offense
players outmaneuver one de
fender). After five touches in
rapid succession, forward Kelly
Westerwick unloaded a goal
on an assist from Read. Read
also assisted on the first goal, a
blast from Jackson.
Improved rushing was an
important second-half im
provement for the Cards. Two
of the four goals came on hustl
ing second efforts. Only the
corner game was weak. The
Cards did not execute quickly
enough to be a threat, a prob

lem they must solve to emerge
successfully from the Arizona
Invitational, being held today
and tomorrow. The squad will
play a grueling three-game
series after travelling for a full
day.
Stanford will face two region
seven teams, the University of
North Carolina, Colorado and
the University of Arizona. The
Cards will also have a chance
for revenge against San Diego
State, which they tied 1-1 in a
disappointing contest.
The team's success with the
3-3-3 will be severely
the two days of intensive hoc
key. "It is an especially tiring
mode of play," said Read. "But
we're prepared physically and
mentally."
It will be important for the
Card nine not to neglect their
defensive responsibilities, a
task they have been able to

avoid against weaker teams by
maintaining constant offensive
pressure.
With this in mind, the for
wards have keyed on tackling
in practice and the third line
and midfield have worked
especially hard on rushing
through to insure cohesive
ness of defense and attack.
By totally dominating UC-
Davis, the Cards have showed
the kind of consistent hockey
they are now capable of play
ing. As the first of three major
'tournaments, the Arizona Invi
tational is the team's first test of
their ability to maintain consis
tency over time against top
notch competition.
The Stanford JV battled back
from a 1-0 halftime deficit to
defeat Davis on the strength of
goals by Jodi Higgins, Claudia
Gold, and Sarah Dentoni
Wednesday.

UC-Davis, Wednesday on the
road.
"The team played as I hoped
it would," said coach Barbara
Longstreth. "We showed the
ability to dominate a team we
should beat by maintaining
constant offensive pressure."
After tying Davis last year in a
match "we should have won,"
according to captain Amanda
Read, the team was emotion
ally charged for the contest.
Electricity was in the air
throughout as the wired Card
offense fired 51 shots on goal,
while allowing the Aggies only
one.
A strong midfield was the
key to victory, accounting for
four goals and two assists. The
3-3-3-1 alignment allowed the

Cards to attack successfully
from every position except
sweeper and goalie.
Classic passing leading to
the second goal was the
epitome of offensive team
play. After an interception by
link Sukie Jackson at the 30, the
Cards moved the ball upfield
with a series of 2V-1s (draw
passes where two offense
players outmaneuver one de
fender). After five touches in
rapid succession, forward Kelly
Westerwick unloaded a goal
on an assist from Read. Read
also assisted on the first goal, a
blast from Jackson.
Improved rushing was an
important second-half im
provement for the Cards. Two
of the four goals came on hustl
ing second efforts. Only the
corner game was weak. The
Cards did not execute quickly
enough to be a threat, a prob

lem they must solve to emerge
successfully from the Arizona
Invitational, being held today
and tomorrow. The squad will
play a grueling three-game
series after travelling for a full
day.
Stanford will face two region
seven teams, the University of
North Carolina, Colorado and
the University of Arizona. The
Cards will also have a chance
for revenge against San Diego
State, which they tied 1-1 in a
disappointing contest.
The team's success with the
3-3-3 will be severely
the two days of intensive hoc
key. "It is an especially tiring
mode of play," said Read. "But
we're prepared physically and
mentally."
It will be important for the
Card nine not to neglect their
defensive responsibilities, a
task they have been able to

avoid against weaker teams by
maintaining constant offensive
pressure.
With this in mind, the for
wards have keyed on tackling
in practice and the third line
and midfield have worked
especially hard on rushing
through to insure cohesive
ness of defense and attack.
By totally dominating UC-
Davis, the Cards have showed
the kind of consistent hockey
they are now capable of play
ing. As the first of three major
'tournaments, the Arizona Invi
tational is the team's first test of
their ability to maintain consis
tency over time against top
notch competition.
The Stanford JV battled back
from a 1-0 halftime deficit to
defeat Davis on the strength of
goals by Jodi Higgins, Claudia
Gold, and Sarah Dentoni
Wednesday.
The Stanford field hockey
team upped its conference re
cord to 3-1 with a 6-0 rout of
