## Spikers overrun Cal 
### JEFF POWELL 
After a slow start and inter
rupted middle, the Stanford
women's volleyball team out
lasted the visiting California
spikers last night 14-16, 15-11,
15-12, 15-9. In addition, Wed
nesday night the spikers de
stroyed the University of San
Francisco 15-6, 15-6, 15-1, rais
ing their record, after last
night's win, to 5-1.
The Cards, rallying behind
the stellar play of captain Liz
Hughes and sophomore Chris
Anderson, captured the final
three games to silence a fired
up Cal team, considered by
coach Fred Sturm to be among
the top four teams in the con
ference.
The first game was one of in
tense rallies sparked by excep
tional defensive returns. The
Cardinals forged ahead only to
lose the final five points and
consequently, the initial game
14-16. The women eventually

evened the match, though, by
capturing the equally spirited
second game 15-11. The next
game was highlighted by ag
gressive net play and a seesaw
battle for the lead. The Cards
might edge ahead but Cal
would fight back. Finally, Stan
ford jumped in front 14-10 in
their own version of the Big
Game. Or, was that the Long
Game?
Suddenly, in mid-point, the
net release snapped, prompt
ing a 45-minute delay and con
fusion to spectators and par
ticipants alike. The net was re
paired however, and the spik
ers came out shooting. With
out further a do, Shawn Hoover
dropped a shot between Bear
defenders, winning the point
and the third game 15-12.
The momentum had been
obviously solidified for the
home side as the fourth and
final game was finished
quickly. Three fine spikes by

Chris Anderson and spectacu
lar net play by Liz Hughes sea
led the fate of California and
atoned for sub-par perfor
mances in earlier stages of the
match. According to Coach
Sturm, both Hughes and An
derson were "off in the first
two games yet came back
beautifully. That separates the
good players from the bad."
This weekend, the spikers
venture to Southern California
to meet UCLA Friday and USC
Saturday in non-conference
matches. The Los Angeles
teams will give the young Stan
ford squad a true test of their
ability. Sturm said, "This
weekend will be a good learn
ing experience for us. As they
are non-league games, we'll be
able to play different players in
different positions. After this
weekend, we'll really be able
to see where our program
stands."
