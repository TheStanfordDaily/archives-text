# Protest insufficient facilities, staff
## 23 nurses submit resignations 
### JILL LISCOM 
Twenty-three nurses who work in the newborn inten
sive care unit of the Stanford Hospital yesterday submit
ted resignations effective Nov. 7 in protest of insufficient
facilities and staffing on the unit.
Hospital administrators, medical staff members and
nursing department representatives are now meeting to
try to resolve the problems.
According to Hospital administrator Gary McKlen
burg, the Hospital shares the nurses concerns.
"We are hopeful we can provide additional staff sup
port to persuade them to reconsider their actions," he
said.
Dr. Irving Schulman, chairman of pediatrics, said the
nurses' unexpected action was "distressing."
The nurses cited insufficient space for providing care
in the specialty unit and the need to upgrade the facility.
They also called attention to the need for more regis
tered nurses on the unit as well as more intensive cover
age by physicians.
According to Schulman, three full-time faculty
neonatologists, three junior level neonatologists, and
four full-time resident physicians, all M.D.'s, are as
signed to the unit, which accommodates only 25 pa
tients.
Schulman explained that although the number of
beds and the ratio of staff to patients has remained the
same for the past six years, the condition of the patients
is more severe now.
"The intensity of illness of the kids we re seeing has
gone up considerably" because "everybody sends us
their worst problems," Schulman said.
He described the unit as "the most intensive care unit
in the Hospital' and said the atmosphere is one of great

tension and emotional strain.
"The nurses feel the physician staffing pattern is insuf
ficient" and "there may be some justification" to their
complaint, Schulman said.
He said the physician staffing patterns are currently
being reevaluated in an attempt to provide still more
physician involvement.
"The current facilities are overburdened and require
replacement," said McKlenburg. "We are now in the
final design process with architects for a new, more
spacious intensive care nursery."
The University has "been after and working on getting
a new nursery for five years, and it is indeed going to
occur," said Schulman.
However, as McKlenburg explained, "Initial plans for
the unit submitted this fall had to be redesigned and
we're now awaiting action by state licensing agencies.
Construction should be underway early next year."
Interim steps to provide space relief for the staff are
also underway. These include providing conference
rooms and additional storage space, he said.
The 2.} nurses who submitted resignations represent
about one-third of the unit's nursing staff, according to
Schulman.
Recruitment of specialized nurses for the unit is con
tinuing, McKlenburg said. Many recently hired nurses
are still in orientation but will be on the unit soon.
However, Schulman said these nurses will not be able
to fully replace the nurses who may resign. If the
nurses do follow through with their resignations, the
Hospital will "probably have to cut back the number of
patients" in the unit, he said.
"We're not about to start giving inadequate care to
our patients," he added.

also underway. These include providing conference
rooms and additional storage space, he said.
The 2.} nurses who submitted resignations represent
about one-third of the unit's nursing staff, according to
Schulman.
Recruitment of specialized nurses for the unit is con
tinuing, McKlenburg said. Many recently hired nurses
are still in orientation but will be on the unit soon.
However, Schulman said these nurses will not be able
to fully replace the nurses who may resign. If the
nurses do follow through with their resignations, the
Hospital will "probably have to cut back the number of
patients" in the unit, he said.
"We're not about to start giving inadequate care to
our patients," he added.
Twenty-three nurses who work in the newborn inten
sive care unit of the Stanford Hospital yesterday submit
ted resignations effective Nov. 7 in protest of insufficient
facilities and staffing on the unit.
Hospital administrators, medical staff members and
nursing department representatives are now meeting to
try to resolve the problems.
According to Hospital administrator Gary McKlen
burg, the Hospital shares the nurses concerns.
"We are hopeful we can provide additional staff sup
port to persuade them to reconsider their actions," he
said.
Dr. Irving Schulman, chairman of pediatrics, said the
nurses' unexpected action was "distressing."
The nurses cited insufficient space for providing care
in the specialty unit and the need to upgrade the facility.
They also called attention to the need for more regis
tered nurses on the unit as well as more intensive cover
age by physicians.
According to Schulman, three full-time faculty
neonatologists, three junior level neonatologists, and
four full-time resident physicians, all M.D.'s, are as
signed to the unit, which accommodates only 25 pa
tients.
Schulman explained that although the number of
beds and the ratio of staff to patients has remained the
same for the past six years, the condition of the patients
is more severe now.
"The intensity of illness of the kids we re seeing has
gone up considerably" because "everybody sends us
their worst problems," Schulman said.
He described the unit as "the most intensive care unit
in the Hospital' and said the atmosphere is one of great

tension and emotional strain.
"The nurses feel the physician staffing pattern is insuf
ficient" and "there may be some justification" to their
complaint, Schulman said.
He said the physician staffing patterns are currently
being reevaluated in an attempt to provide still more
physician involvement.
"The current facilities are overburdened and require
replacement," said McKlenburg. "We are now in the
final design process with architects for a new, more
spacious intensive care nursery."
The University has "been after and working on getting
a new nursery for five years, and it is indeed going to
occur," said Schulman.
However, as McKlenburg explained, "Initial plans for
the unit submitted this fall had to be redesigned and
we're now awaiting action by state licensing agencies.
Construction should be underway early next year."
Interim steps to provide space relief for the staff are
also underway. These include providing conference
rooms and additional storage space, he said.
