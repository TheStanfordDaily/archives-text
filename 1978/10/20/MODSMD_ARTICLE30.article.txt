# On any squad but Stanford's
## Vanelli-too good to be No. 2 
### JEFF POWELL 
To be voted All-America is special.
Most of us will never be awarded that
honor. To play behind one is also rare.
Sophomore Vince Vannelli is an ex
ception. You see, Vannelli is the back
up goalie on the No. 1 ranked Stanford
water polo team — second fiddle to
John Gansel, who's considered to be
the premier college goalie in the United
States, an All-American.
Only, Vannelli is no slouch, either.
To paraphrase captain Robby Arnold;
excepting Gansel, there is no better
goalie in the rugged Pac-10 than Van
nelli.
Problem.
Gansel and Vannelli are members of
the same team.
Moreover, this past summer, after
sittingon the bench his entire freshman
year, Vannelli, along with Gansel, was
asked to try out for the Junior National
team. Quite an honor.
"The fact that I hadn't played, for all
intents and purposes, fora full yearand
yet was still asked, was a testament to
the fact that someone out there realizes
that I have some potential and that I
might be a good goalie."
Although not expecting to see exten
sive action as a freshman, Vannelli did
anticipate sliding into the starting slot
this year. It quickly became apparent
however, that another freshman sensa
tion, John Gansel, was a truly outstand
ing goalie. Eventually, Gansel replaced
an injured upperclassman — USC
transfer Craig Schwarberg — and has
held the job ever since.
"I honestly would like to see John do

well and I'm sure that he encourages
me as well," said Vannelli. "He's always
behind me 100 percent."
In any competitive situation, hard
feelings among parties commonly
arise. Yet, hints of hostility between the
goalies are not evident here. They really
get along well. Not only are Vannelli
and Gansel the best of friends, but
fraternity brothers as well.
Friendship aside, is being a member
of the best team in the nation compen
sation enough for sitting on the bench,
for watching opponents starting goalies
weaker than yourself? "I'm proud to be
a member of such an outstanding
team," said Vannelli. "What's nice is
when you go to play another team and
you can see it in their faces. They look at
you saying, 'yeah, we might beat these
guys' but deep down inside they know
that their chances are mighty slim. It's
nice. The thought in my head, though,
is primarily how it would be to play all
the time at Stanford for a No. 1 team. I
don't think about playing for losers."
Life is not all fun and games, though.
In practices, Vince is frequently frus
trated by his role as a back-up as any
competitive, self-respecting athlete
would be. Frustration. Vince could un
derstandably let down, slack off, but he
doesn't. Why not?
"I play for personal reasons, said the
6-foot-3, 180-pounder. "I'm a good
goalie. It means a lot to me to get in and
work hard in practice. It would be very
easy for me to just go in and take it real
easy. I don't do that. I'd have trouble
facing myself."
Gansel and Vannelli — a coach's de

light. As coach Dettamenti stated,
"We're lucky to have two guys of this
caliber. If anything ever happens to one
of them, we've got the other. Its really
nice to have two goalies. Some schools
don't even have one." Unfortunately,
only one can play at a time. And right
now that's Cansel.
Vannelli's role lies far beyond playing
in matches. Although that would be
nice, Vannelli's responsibility is one of
providing incentive. "Even if I didn't
play, the fact that I'm there and doing
fairly well behind John gives him a cer
tain added motivation to perform well.
Even if I never got in, that in itself is
enough to make John perform so much
better."
Vannelli does play, however. Not as
much as a man of his capabilities would
on any other team, but he is playing
more than last year.
"I can't see Vince going through four
years here and not playing," said De
ttamenti. A few weeks ago, Vince was
slated to start two of five games in a
tournament at Irvine before he was fel
led by the flu. Incidentally, Vince will
get the nod in the cages this afternoon
against UCLA.
Although a league game and impor
tant in that sense, UCLA is not a pow
erhouse. Vannelli is grateful for the op
portunity to play, yet longs for even
more action and in bigger games.
Frustrated, but not restless, Vannelli
keeps plugging away. "The fact that I'm
playing behind probably the best goalie
in the nation is actually sort of a back
handed compliment. "After all, he ad
ded, "I could be number two."

victory to perpetuate their national No. 1 ranking. The Cards face two tough matches this
weekend — UCLA and UCI — at the deGuerre complex.
To be voted All-America is special.
Most of us will never be awarded that
honor. To play behind one is also rare.
Sophomore Vince Vannelli is an ex
ception. You see, Vannelli is the back
up goalie on the No. 1 ranked Stanford
water polo team — second fiddle to
John Gansel, who's considered to be
the premier college goalie in the United
States, an All-American.
Only, Vannelli is no slouch, either.
To paraphrase captain Robby Arnold;
excepting Gansel, there is no better
goalie in the rugged Pac-10 than Van
nelli.
Problem.
Gansel and Vannelli are members of
the same team.
Moreover, this past summer, after
sittingon the bench his entire freshman
year, Vannelli, along with Gansel, was
asked to try out for the Junior National
team. Quite an honor.
"The fact that I hadn't played, for all
intents and purposes, fora full yearand
yet was still asked, was a testament to
the fact that someone out there realizes
that I have some potential and that I
might be a good goalie."
Although not expecting to see exten
sive action as a freshman, Vannelli did
anticipate sliding into the starting slot
this year. It quickly became apparent
however, that another freshman sensa
tion, John Gansel, was a truly outstand
ing goalie. Eventually, Gansel replaced
an injured upperclassman — USC
transfer Craig Schwarberg — and has
held the job ever since.
"I honestly would like to see John do

well and I'm sure that he encourages
me as well," said Vannelli. "He's always
behind me 100 percent."
In any competitive situation, hard
feelings among parties commonly
arise. Yet, hints of hostility between the
goalies are not evident here. They really
get along well. Not only are Vannelli
and Gansel the best of friends, but
fraternity brothers as well.
Friendship aside, is being a member
of the best team in the nation compen
sation enough for sitting on the bench,
for watching opponents starting goalies
weaker than yourself? "I'm proud to be
a member of such an outstanding
team," said Vannelli. "What's nice is
when you go to play another team and
you can see it in their faces. They look at
you saying, 'yeah, we might beat these
guys' but deep down inside they know
that their chances are mighty slim. It's
nice. The thought in my head, though,
is primarily how it would be to play all
the time at Stanford for a No. 1 team. I
don't think about playing for losers."
Life is not all fun and games, though.
In practices, Vince is frequently frus
trated by his role as a back-up as any
competitive, self-respecting athlete
would be. Frustration. Vince could un
derstandably let down, slack off, but he
doesn't. Why not?
"I play for personal reasons, said the
6-foot-3, 180-pounder. "I'm a good
goalie. It means a lot to me to get in and
work hard in practice. It would be very
easy for me to just go in and take it real
easy. I don't do that. I'd have trouble
facing myself."
Gansel and Vannelli — a coach's de

light. As coach Dettamenti stated,
"We're lucky to have two guys of this
caliber. If anything ever happens to one
of them, we've got the other. Its really
nice to have two goalies. Some schools
don't even have one." Unfortunately,
only one can play at a time. And right
now that's Cansel.
Vannelli's role lies far beyond playing
in matches. Although that would be
nice, Vannelli's responsibility is one of
providing incentive. "Even if I didn't
play, the fact that I'm there and doing
fairly well behind John gives him a cer
tain added motivation to perform well.
Even if I never got in, that in itself is
enough to make John perform so much
better."
Vannelli does play, however. Not as
much as a man of his capabilities would
on any other team, but he is playing
more than last year.
"I can't see Vince going through four
years here and not playing," said De
ttamenti. A few weeks ago, Vince was
slated to start two of five games in a
tournament at Irvine before he was fel
led by the flu. Incidentally, Vince will
get the nod in the cages this afternoon
against UCLA.
Although a league game and impor
tant in that sense, UCLA is not a pow
erhouse. Vannelli is grateful for the op
portunity to play, yet longs for even
more action and in bigger games.
Frustrated, but not restless, Vannelli
keeps plugging away. "The fact that I'm
playing behind probably the best goalie
in the nation is actually sort of a back
handed compliment. "After all, he ad
ded, "I could be number two."

Sophomore Vince Vannelli blocks a shot from a San lose Slate hole man on the way to another
victory to perpetuate their national No. 1 ranking. The Cards face two tough matches this
weekend — UCLA and UCI — at the deGuerre complex.
To be voted All-America is special.
Most of us will never be awarded that
honor. To play behind one is also rare.
Sophomore Vince Vannelli is an ex
ception. You see, Vannelli is the back
up goalie on the No. 1 ranked Stanford
water polo team — second fiddle to
John Gansel, who's considered to be
the premier college goalie in the United
States, an All-American.
Only, Vannelli is no slouch, either.
To paraphrase captain Robby Arnold;
excepting Gansel, there is no better
goalie in the rugged Pac-10 than Van
nelli.
Problem.
Gansel and Vannelli are members of
the same team.
Moreover, this past summer, after
sittingon the bench his entire freshman
year, Vannelli, along with Gansel, was
asked to try out for the Junior National
team. Quite an honor.
"The fact that I hadn't played, for all
intents and purposes, fora full yearand
yet was still asked, was a testament to
the fact that someone out there realizes
that I have some potential and that I
might be a good goalie."
Although not expecting to see exten
sive action as a freshman, Vannelli did
anticipate sliding into the starting slot
this year. It quickly became apparent
however, that another freshman sensa
tion, John Gansel, was a truly outstand
ing goalie. Eventually, Gansel replaced
an injured upperclassman — USC
transfer Craig Schwarberg — and has
held the job ever since.
"I honestly would like to see John do

well and I'm sure that he encourages
me as well," said Vannelli. "He's always
behind me 100 percent."
In any competitive situation, hard
feelings among parties commonly
arise. Yet, hints of hostility between the
goalies are not evident here. They really
get along well. Not only are Vannelli
and Gansel the best of friends, but
fraternity brothers as well.
Friendship aside, is being a member
of the best team in the nation compen
sation enough for sitting on the bench,
for watching opponents starting goalies
weaker than yourself? "I'm proud to be
a member of such an outstanding
team," said Vannelli. "What's nice is
when you go to play another team and
you can see it in their faces. They look at
you saying, 'yeah, we might beat these
guys' but deep down inside they know
that their chances are mighty slim. It's
nice. The thought in my head, though,
is primarily how it would be to play all
the time at Stanford for a No. 1 team. I
don't think about playing for losers."
Life is not all fun and games, though.
In practices, Vince is frequently frus
trated by his role as a back-up as any
competitive, self-respecting athlete
would be. Frustration. Vince could un
derstandably let down, slack off, but he
doesn't. Why not?
"I play for personal reasons, said the
6-foot-3, 180-pounder. "I'm a good
goalie. It means a lot to me to get in and
work hard in practice. It would be very
easy for me to just go in and take it real
easy. I don't do that. I'd have trouble
facing myself."
Gansel and Vannelli — a coach's de

light. As coach Dettamenti stated,
"We're lucky to have two guys of this
caliber. If anything ever happens to one
of them, we've got the other. Its really
nice to have two goalies. Some schools
don't even have one." Unfortunately,
only one can play at a time. And right
now that's Cansel.
Vannelli's role lies far beyond playing
in matches. Although that would be
nice, Vannelli's responsibility is one of
providing incentive. "Even if I didn't
play, the fact that I'm there and doing
fairly well behind John gives him a cer
tain added motivation to perform well.
Even if I never got in, that in itself is
enough to make John perform so much
better."
Vannelli does play, however. Not as
much as a man of his capabilities would
on any other team, but he is playing
more than last year.
"I can't see Vince going through four
years here and not playing," said De
ttamenti. A few weeks ago, Vince was
slated to start two of five games in a
tournament at Irvine before he was fel
led by the flu. Incidentally, Vince will
get the nod in the cages this afternoon
against UCLA.
Although a league game and impor
tant in that sense, UCLA is not a pow
erhouse. Vannelli is grateful for the op
portunity to play, yet longs for even
more action and in bigger games.
Frustrated, but not restless, Vannelli
keeps plugging away. "The fact that I'm
playing behind probably the best goalie
in the nation is actually sort of a back
handed compliment. "After all, he ad
ded, "I could be number two."
