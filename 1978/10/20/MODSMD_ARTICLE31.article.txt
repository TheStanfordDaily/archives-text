# Poloists face UCLA, UCI
## 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
The last time Stanford's
water polo team faced UCLA
and UC-lrvine, they beat the
Bruins 12-2, and outplayed the
Anteaters, 10-6.
But when the two Southern
California water polo powers
invade deCuerre this
weekend, the story may be dif
ferent, according to Cardinal
coach Dante Dettamanti.
Regarding today's 3 p.m.
game with UCLA, Dettamanti
said, "I don't think we can ex
pect the same type of game as
the last two times we played
them. They'll be a little more
ready for us."
Since Stanford humiliated
the Bruins two weeks ago, the
UCLA team last week barely
lost to No. 2 ranked California
12-8, and were leading the
Bears at halftime.
"They (UCLA) are playing
much better," Dettamanti said.
"They have a lot of young guys,
but I expect a tough game from
them.
"Our fast-break worked re
ally well last time," he con

tinued, "but they'll be more
ready for that. We probably
won't be as successful with it
this time."
The Cards will have one sur
prise for the Bruins, however.
Instead of seeing Stanford
sophomore John Cansel in the
goal today, the Bruins will have
to try to get the ball past back
up goalie Vince Vanelli, also a
sophomore.
"I wanted to give him more
playing time because he's an
excellent goalie," said De
ttamanti. "I don't want him sit
ting on the bench for four
years."
In addition, Dettamanti said,
"it takes a little pressure off of
John (Cansel) also. It gives him
a chance to concentrate on just
one game, rather than two."
Cansel will be back in the
starting lineup on Saturday
morningforthe 11 a.m. contest
against the Anteaters, and
that's the one that Dettamanti
is particularly concerned ab
out.
"Again, they (Irvine) are the
toughest team we've played,

outside of Cal," said De
ttamanti . "We have to play well
to beat them. If we let down,
they have the ability to beat
us."
The Anteaters' team features
three All-Americans, including
Bob Malone â€” who played a
big role in Irvine's upset win
over Stanford in the 1977 NCAA
semifinals. In addition, Irvine's
Peter Campbell is a freshman
who was voted first team high
school All-America last year.
"We have to keep the pres
sure on them and keep fast
breaking at every opportun
ity," said Dettamanti. "We
might have to fast-break five or
six times before it pays off. We
need to control the ball on of
fense and really pressure them
on defense, particularly on the
outside."
The Pacific-10 season is half
over, but the Cards have the
toughest half ahead of them,
thanks to a schedule which
places both of Stanford's
games against Cal during the
last two weeks of the season.
"Nobody's going to give us
anything," said Dettamanti.
"We've got to go out and show
we're the better team."
