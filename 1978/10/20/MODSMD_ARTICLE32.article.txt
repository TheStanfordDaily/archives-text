# Cards run at Hayward
## 
### TED HERHOLD 
A "healthier" women's cross
country team runs at the Cal
State-Hayward Invitational this
weekend, hoping to improve
upon last week's performance
at the Stanford Invitational.
"I'm really pleased to see we
are getting healthier," said the
Card's coach Laurel Treon. The
team has been plagued by nag
ging injuries in the past, but
seems ready for a good show
ing in the three mile event on
Saturday.
"We've done well this year,
but certainly not up to our po
tential. We need to try and em
phasize more the team con
cept. Running as a team can be
the difference between a good
showing and an average one,"
said Treon.

This will be the last meet for
the women before the region
al on November 4, to be held
in Long Beach. The top three
teams, plus the top twenty
finishers will qualify for na
tionals. The Cards finished
third at the regionals last year
behind Cal State-Northridge
and UCLA, and ended up a re
spectable 18th in the nation.
"I'd like to use this week's
event as a final racing tune-up
for the regionals," added
Treon.
Running for the women on
Saturday are Anne Thrupp,
Susan Bragdon, Annette Mun
gai, Kyle Chapman, Beth Harri
son, Karin Pascoe, Joanne Ernst
and Therese Lamb. The men's
team is idle this week.
