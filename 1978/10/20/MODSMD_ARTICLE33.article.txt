# IM runners race for the lead
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
Jerry Hall was the only competitor to
break the 15 minute mark as he easily won
his second consecutive IM cross country
meet Wednesday.
Hall, a graduate student in physics, was
timed in 14:58 on the cold and cloudy af
ternoon, nine seconds ahead of freshman
Layne Rolston of Cedro. The top woman
finisher was Zapata's Ellyn Pildis, who ran
the 2.8 mile course in 19:29.
Hall defended his title for the Angel!
Field Ancients, who took top honors in the
graduate team division. He said the An
cients are a group of faculty and staff who
occasionally get together on Angell Field
to work out. Hall usually runs races cover
ing six to eight miles, but based on his
performance the past two years, he seems
just fine in shorter' r faces as well.

Rolston was running in a much more
familiar race, since he competed in the
three mile cross country in high school.
He has been running cross country since
his freshman year in high school and his
second-place finish overall allowed his
team, the Cedro Bricks, to capture fourth
place in the undergraduate team stand
ings.
Pildis was running in only her fourth
meet. She competed in the IM cross
country race last year as a freshman, as
well as two recent events. Primarily a jog
ger, she has been running intensely the
past few weeks in preparation for the
event.
In cross country, intramural points are
awarded to teams, with three participants
making up a squad. There are three divi
sions: all-university, graduate, and all

women. First place earns 25 points in each
division. Lower finishers receive points
scaled down accordingly.
In the all-University division, composed
of undergraduates, SAE took first place,
followed by Sigma Chi and Rinconada. In
the graduate division, the victorious
Angell Field Ancients were followed by
the Savages and Biz 1. In the women's
division, Whitman took first place. No
other points were awarded in the division
because Whitman was the only team to
have three runners finish.
All competitors entered in IM elimina
tion tournaments must check the tourna
ment charts outside the intramural office.
Deadlines are approaching and will be
strictly enforced.
