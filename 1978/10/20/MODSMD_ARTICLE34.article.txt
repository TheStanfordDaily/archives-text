# Booters succumb to Santa Clara
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
The crowd's reactions al
most foretold the outcome —
Stanford would fail to get a
shot on goal, the spectators
would return to their seats, and
a disappointed moan filled the
stands.
And so it went. The Cardinals
dropped a 2-0 decision to con
ference rival Santa Clara, halt
ing their win streak at seven

games and dropping the sea
son mark to 11-2 — 2-2 in con
ference play.
In a game somewhat re
miniscent of the Hayward State
game but, with the roles re
versed, the match was score
less until halfway in the second
half when Bronco midfielder
Scott Douglas broke the ice. In
less than four minutes Santa
Clara was in Stanford territory
again and it was forward Tony
Maggio who did the honors.
"It was an even game up to
that point," Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge explained.
"Even though they seemed to
control a little of it we still had
some good strikes at the goal.
In the second half, it was even
up until 20 minutes; the goal
makes the difference — it
changes the whole complexion
of the game."
It was a frustrating loss since
the Broncos had lost to Hay

ward and San Francisco State,
both defeated by the Cards ear
lier in the season.
Stanford lacked its usual
poise on the field and was
stymied by the Santa Clara de
fense.
"That's the best defense
we've ever played against,"
said senior fullback Mark
Triska. "Wewereshut off — we
couldn't break through them at
all. I thought this was the first
game we've played that we
couldn't penetrate. They were
almost as strong as San Jose
State."
"Its hard tolose," he added.
The Cards hit the road today
for a 2 p.m. contest with
Sonoma State, hoping to get
back on the winning track.
Stanford returns to the Farm to
host another conference op
ponent, St. Mary's tomorrow at
10 a.m. on Maloney Field.
