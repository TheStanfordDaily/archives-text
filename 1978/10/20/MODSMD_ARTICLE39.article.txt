Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Surf
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmann give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
film about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating, because its lan
guage cannot to justice to either
the performances or to
Bergman's assured visual con
ception. But your frustration is,
finally, erased by joy. Even if In
gmar Bergman is not yet ready to
go all the way with a movie again,
his actresses are, and they take
the movie right to the limit, roar
ing through it like two great
ladies of the theater who haven't
lost their zest.
—Ron Lillejord
Four Musketeers ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
This second half of Richard Les
ter's burlesque version of the
Dumas novel lacks some of the
visual energy that got audiences
caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les
ter movie can be described as
having themes), Four Musketeers
works because it has style (albeit
low) and actors who know how to
romp: Michael York, Jean-Pierre
Cassel, Oliver Reed and (sur
prisingly), Richard Chamberlain
and Raquel Welch.
—R.L.
Philadelphia Story ★★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Katherine Hepburn, Cary
Grant and jimmy Stewart in a
movie that seems to have been
set up as a vehicle for all three of
them. There is a plot, and there
are other actors, but Hepburn
was never more skittish, Grant
never less macho, and Stewart's
speech impediment is in abso
lutely vintage form. The three of
them work very well together. A
very funny comedy.
—John Nielsen
Pardon Mon Affaire ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Pardon Mon Affaire is a minor
sex farce which purports to re
flect the "new morality." This is
odd since it seems to have been
created from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous
way.
—Jim Mattson
Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing
ing here), Russell probably made
the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.
—R.L.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over
looked movie by Francis Ford
Coppola, director of the Cod
father films and of the upcoming
Apocalypse Now. Made in 1974,
The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka
ble performance by Gene
Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.
—R.L.
Viva Italia! -kick
Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro
ken up when his straight man re
counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its
quirky, wry wit.
—).M.
Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Guano

A Wedding irk
Menlo
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns loNashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar
ried to a man who's idea of a din
ner toast is to mumble "my first

is a writer of children's books
who is unpublished for all the
right reasons. When the duo find
Farrah's husband stuck to a table
with a knife, they stash the
corpse in the refrigerator for
want of anything better to do.
Even Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this half
baked non-mystery, and here the
blandness of the female lead and
the ineptness of director Lamont
Johnson combine to create an
entertainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.
—J.M.

Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di
rector and star of the movie, jack
Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.
Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War
ren Beatty with Clint Eastwood.
—|.N.
Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that dancing
as inherently unimportant, but
that's their fault, really. If they
scoff at you you should punch
them in the nose.
-J.N.
The Buddy Holly Story ★★★
Alhambra
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.
—J.N.
The Cheap Detective mf
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PG-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Gilliatt,
summer movie critic for The New
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Four Musketeers ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
This second half of Richard Les

Dumas novel lacks some of the
visual energy that got audiences
caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les

Philadelphia Story ★★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Katherine Hepburn, Cary
Grant and jimmy Stewart in a
movie that seems to have been
set up as a vehicle for all three of
them. There is a plot, and there

very funny comedy.

Pardon Mon Affaire ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Pardon Mon Affaire is a minor
sex farce which purports to re
flect the "new morality." This is
odd since it seems to have been
created from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous
way.

Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing
ing here), Russell probably made
the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.
—R.L.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over
looked movie by Francis Ford
Coppola, director of the Cod
father films and of the upcoming
Apocalypse Now. Made in 1974,
The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka
ble performance by Gene
Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.

Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro

counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its
quirky, wry wit.

Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white

this, this story of various forms of

House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little

Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of

it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal

through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead

lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc

Never again will I confuse War

Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that dancing
as inherently unimportant, but
that's their fault, really. If they
scoff at you you should punch
them in the nose.

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★
Alhambra
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But

that's their fault, really. If they

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★
Alhambra
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

The Cheap Detective mf
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PG-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Gilliatt,
summer movie critic for The New
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Four Musketeers ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
This second half of Richard Les

caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les

Monday, Cubberley
Katherine Hepburn, Cary

movie that seems to have been

Pardon Mon Affaire ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Pardon Mon Affaire is a minor
sex farce which purports to re

odd since it seems to have been
created from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous
way.

Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing

the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.
—R.L.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support

tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over

Coppola, director of the Cod

The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka
ble performance by Gene
Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.

Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro

counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its

Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure

and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair

on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly

and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white

this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War
ren Beatty with Clint Eastwood.

Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its

the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41

Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead

lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War

Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that dancing
as inherently unimportant, but
that's their fault, really. If they
scoff at you you should punch
them in the nose.

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★
Alhambra
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.
—J.N.
The Cheap Detective mf
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PG-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Gilliatt,
summer movie critic for The New
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Four Musketeers ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
This second half of Richard Les

caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les

Monday, Cubberley
Katherine Hepburn, Cary

movie that seems to have been

Pardon Mon Affaire ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Pardon Mon Affaire is a minor
sex farce which purports to re
flect the "new morality." This is
odd since it seems to have been
created from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous
way.

Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing
ing here), Russell probably made
the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.
—R.L.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over
looked movie by Francis Ford
Coppola, director of the Cod

Apocalypse Now. Made in 1974,
The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka
ble performance by Gene
Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.

Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro

counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its

Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure

but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc

—R.L.

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its

wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.
Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War
ren Beatty with Clint Eastwood.

Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that dancing
as inherently unimportant, but
that's their fault, really. If they
scoff at you you should punch
them in the nose.

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★
Alhambra
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

The Cheap Detective mf
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PG-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Gilliatt,
summer movie critic for The New
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Four Musketeers ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
This second half of Richard Les

Dumas novel lacks some of the
visual energy that got audiences
caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les

having themes), Four Musketeers
works because it has style (albeit
low) and actors who know how to

Philadelphia Story ★★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Katherine Hepburn, Cary
Grant and jimmy Stewart in a
movie that seems to have been
set up as a vehicle for all three of
them. There is a plot, and there

very funny comedy.

Pardon Mon Affaire ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Pardon Mon Affaire is a minor
sex farce which purports to re
flect the "new morality." This is
odd since it seems to have been
created from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous
way.
—Jim Mattson
Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing
ing here), Russell probably made
the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.
—R.L.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over

Coppola, director of the Cod

The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka

Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.

Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro

counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its
quirky, wry wit.

Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Writer-director Robert Altman

While A Wedding often exhibits

Coin' South ★★

holding themselves back to get

kills all of the material's potential

Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War

Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that dancing
as inherently unimportant, but
that's their fault, really. If they
scoff at you you should punch
them in the nose.

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★

Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as

and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the

but it's hard to imagine a finer

The Cheap Detective mf
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PG-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Gilliatt,
summer movie critic for The New
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

This second half of Richard Les

caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les

Sunday, Mem Aud

middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous

Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing

the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over

Coppola, director of the Cod
father films and of the upcoming

The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka
ble performance by Gene
Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.

Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro
ken up when his straight man re
counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its
quirky, wry wit.

Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

The Boys from Brazil ★★
Coronet
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved
— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Coin' South ★★
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di
rector and star of the movie, jack
Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House if if if if
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Guild Theater
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
(Strange as it sounds, he's good
at this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.)
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a '41
Robert Montgomery film, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War

Saturday Night Fever ★★★★
Moffett Drive-In
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that because
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself on television every week
he can't possibly be any good
here, and that anyone who likes
him must be some kind of
groupie who probably got low

SAT scores. You're thinking that
disco is about as exciting as lep
rosy and that anyone who likes it
must have no moral vision what
soever.
You've got a point too, except
that its uncharitable to go around
talking about other people's
lousy SAT's. Yet Saturday Night
Fever does have a fixity about it
which at times is very appealing,
and Travolta is a legitimate star
(he plays a big, dumb stud, to be
sure, but he manages to be subtle
at times and almost complex at
others). The movie has no nutri
tional value, but it is very good.
Some people will hate it for its
unrepentant dumbness, and
some will object to that dancing
as inherently unimportant, but
that's their fault, really. If they
scoff at you you should punch
them in the nose.

The Buddy Holly Story ★★★
Alhambra
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

The Cheap Detective mf
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PG-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Gilliatt,
summer movie critic for The New
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Grease if
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics." Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kind of feeling must
please some people, and while
Grease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Autumn Sonata ★★★ Vi
Surf
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmann give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
film about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating, because its lan
guage cannot to justice to either
the performances or to
Bergman's assured visual con
ception. But your frustration is,
finally, erased by joy. Even if In
gmar Bergman is not yet ready to
go all the way with a movie again,
his actresses are, and they take
the movie right to the limit, roar
ing through it like two great
ladies of the theater who haven't
lost their zest.
—Ron Lillejord
Four Musketeers ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
This second half of Richard Les
ter's burlesque version of the
Dumas novel lacks some of the
visual energy that got audiences
caught up in the first half, The
Three Musketeers. More sub
dued, more "thematic" (if a Les
ter movie can be described as
having themes), Four Musketeers
works because it has style (albeit
low) and actors who know how to
romp: Michael York, Jean-Pierre
Cassel, Oliver Reed and (sur
prisingly), Richard Chamberlain
and Raquel Welch.
—R.L.
Philadelphia Story ★★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Katherine Hepburn, Cary
Grant and jimmy Stewart in a
movie that seems to have been
set up as a vehicle for all three of
them. There is a plot, and there
are other actors, but Hepburn
was never more skittish, Grant
never less macho, and Stewart's
speech impediment is in abso
lutely vintage form. The three of
them work very well together. A
very funny comedy.
—John Nielsen
Pardon Mon Affaire ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Pardon Mon Affaire is a minor
sex farce which purports to re
flect the "new morality." This is
odd since it seems to have been
created from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged barbershop lecher:
there's a good supply of petty
snideness here but not much
else. The only new twist to this
tired formula plot about a
middle-aged fling is that the
usual business of sin-suffer-and
repent has been reworked
slightly to let the main character
continueon hismerry adulterous
way.
—Jim Mattson
Tommy ★★★
Friday and Saturday, midnight
Old Mill
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy— magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weaknesses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some
fragments miss everything and
others are right on the mark. Al
though The Who got the message
across better live (you realize that
when you hear Oliver Reed sing
ing here), Russell probably made
the best possible movie version
of Tommy. And that's just what
the world's greatest rock band
deserves.
—R.L.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin
The Conversation ★★★★
Friday, Kresge
A strong but largely over
looked movie by Francis Ford
Coppola, director of the Cod
father films and of the upcoming
Apocalypse Now. Made in 1974,
The Conversation is a subdued,
brooding work about a profes
sional surveillance man's battle
with his peculiar type of morality.
The movie features inventive
work with sound and a remarka
ble performance by Gene
Hackman. Hackman surprises
you with his force here instead of
bludgeoning you with it, as he
sometimes does.
—R.L.
Viva Italia! -kick
Aquarius
This omnibus is made up of
nine vignettes which range in
length from a minute or two to
over 20 and which range in qual
ity from pointless to nearly per
fect. There are at least two
sketches which by themselves
make this movie worth seeing:
one is a truly moving portrait of
how an old woman is too proud
to object when her callous son
takes her to a nursing home
without informing her first; the
other is a giddy skit about how a
great comedian's funeral is bro
ken up when his straight man re
counts his jokes in the eulogy. An
uneven film redeemed by its
quirky, wry wit.
—).M.
Interiors ★★★
Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Geraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europe 112 ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Moriey overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
