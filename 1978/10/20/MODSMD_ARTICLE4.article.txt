# Local researchers splice gene in DNA discovery
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Paul Berg, biochemist, revealed at
a San Francisco news conference this
week that he successfully spliced
genes from a rabbit into those of an
African green monkey.
What is unique about this particu
lar splice is that for the first time, a
transplanted gene has begun to give
its host organism instructions to
produce something. In other words,
it has become a working gene in the
cells into which it was transplanted.
Berg refused to talk to the Daily
about his experiments which he in
advertantly revealed at a convention
of the American College of Sur
geons. It is normal procedure to wait
until the results of such experiments
have been published in a scientific
journal before talking about them to
reporters. In answering questions,
Berg disclosed the new develop
ments not realizing there were re
porters in the audience, according to
the San Francisco Chronicle.
Berg did tell the Chronicle the new
breakthroughs have important im
plications. They may lead to the sub
stitution of defective genes, thus cur
ing millions who suffer from crippl
ing genetic diseases. It could mean,
for instance, that persons lacking
certain essential hormones in their
systems could have a transplanted
gene order their bodies to produce
the missing substance.
The splicing was accomplished
using a virus called SV4O. The rabbit

genes were spliced into the virus
which was then used to infect a cul
ture of monkey cells.
The virus duplicated itself in the
host monkey cells and transferred
the new genetic information to
them. Berg was reluctant to discuss
the details of his research, but did tell
the Chronicle that the research was
aimed at understanding how cells
read genetic codes and how they
utilize certain genes in the cell while
ignoring others in synthesizing sub
stances necessary for an organism.
The discoveries made by Berg have
been previously revealed in closed

scientific conferences on the East
Coast and have been circulated to
European researchers, the Chronicle
said.
In a press release, Berg also iden
tified Richard Mulligan and Bruce
Howard, both of Stanford, as col
leagues in the research.
Berg, who was one of the early
supporters of guidelines for DNA re
search, told the Chronicle that he
feels the guidelines imposed by the
National Institute of Health are too
restrictive because they impede
laboratory research.
