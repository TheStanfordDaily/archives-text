## Frozen yogurts Can you discern the difference? 
### 
Within biking distance of
campus, there are several
places which offer frozen
yogurt as an alternative to ice
cream. However, not all frozen
yogurt is alike. It varies tre
mendously in taste, quality,
price and nutritional value.
The Good Earth Restaurant
185 University Ave.
Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth is one of the
best deals around for frozen
yogurt. They have one daily
flavor of the Alta-Dena brand
yogurt, which has a high nutri
tional value and low calorie
and chemical content. The
Good Earth offers various dis
hes and toppings as well as de
licious shakes combining fruit,
yogurt and juice.
In addition to high quality
and convenient location, the
Good Earth has the cheapest
price in the area for frozen
yogurt: 11 cents per ounce.
The restaurant serves frozen
yogurt 7:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m.,
daily.

Old Uncle Gaylord's
636 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-1809
On a side street in Palo Alto,
we found a wonderful sur
prise: healthful, hand
cranked, natural frozen
yogurt. It is delicious and really
tastes like yogurt. Uncle
Gaylord's is a delight for the
yogurt and "quality food"
lover.
Yogurt flavors range from
the very tangy and unusual ol
liberry to a naturally-sweet
date and honey. Remember
the way that vanilla always
smells in the bottle? That won
derful smell is the taste of
Gaylord's vanilla frozen
yogurt.
For late night yogurt crav
ings, Old Uncle Gaylord's is
open later than any other local
shop — until midnight. Prices
are average, at 14 cents per
ounce.

Swensen's
440 University Ave.
Palo Alto
328-6869
Offering a hand-packed fro
zen yogurt dessert, Swensen's
was disappointing. The flavors
were too sugary and
processed-tasting, even
though the yogurt had been
made on the premises. Aver
age prices; 14 cents per ounce.
Baskin-Robbins 31 Ice Cream
Store
267 University Ave.
Palo Alto
325-2100
Although Baskin-Robbin's
frozen yogurt ranked slightly
above that offered by Swen
sen's, it did not come close to
Old Uncle Gaylord's. The "For
Chocolate Lovers Only" flavor
was yogurty tasting and laced
with chocolate bits but it was
not anything special, nor were
any of the other flavors. Thir
teen cents per ounce.
Yogurt Village
4546 El Camino Real
Los Altos

948-1790
The green plants and
wooden tables of this shop
created a very comfortable and
relaxing atmosphere. Offering
four daily flavors of yogurt,
Yogurt Village is concerned
with choosing brands which do
not use sugar as a sweetener.
Alta-Dena yogurt is usually
served.
This store was the only one
which had a chocolate flavor
made without sugar. It tasted
creamy, like soft frosty ice
cream. A cantelope-half, filled
with yogurt and covered with
toppings, is one of their
specialties. Seventeen cents
per ounce.
Yogurt Village is opening a
new branch at the Stanford
Shopping Center early next
month. It will offer eight
flavors and 26 toppings.
Dawntown Yogurt Shoppe
107 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
327-2558
This shop, which serves
Alta-Dena yogurt, serves dailv
a variety of flavors and top
pings as well as yogurt sundaes
and pies. Lemon, strawberry
and peaches and cream flavors
were sampled. The Lemon was
tangy though chalky tasting.
Strawberry was very refreshing
and the combination of peach,
and vanilla yogurts was re
miniscent of fresh peaches
with cream.
Prices were 16 cents per
ounce. Dawntown is open 11
a.m. — 10 p.m., six days a week
and 12-9 p.m. on Sunday.
Tresidder
Stale toppings, high prices
and low quality yogurt were
what we found at Tresidder.
They serve Knudsen yogurt, in
famous in the yogurt world for
its unhealthful additives, such
as gums, excessive stabilizers,
corn syrup and refined sugar.
Here we found the highest
price around: a staggering 19
cents per ounCe.
