# Bud's no. 1 on Peninsula
## 
### 
Ice cream, America's most popular junk
food, has an especially dedicated following
among students in a state with a repressive
drinking age.
The Peninsula has a high density of ice
cream parlors that make their products on
their own premises.
Three such parlors were rated for these
qualities: amount, smoothness, taste, ser
vice, choice of flavors, quality, and that great
equalizer, price.
It may come as no surprise that Bud's Ice
Cream of Redwood City is in first place. One
scoop costs 45 cents that is indecently large.
Only a masochist would order a double (85
cents). A great variety of smooth, 16 percent
butterfat-type flavors has been Bud's attrac
tion since the 19205. Even the 15 minute drive
down grotesque El Camino Real should not
deter avid Bud's cultists. Butterbrickle and
bittersweet chocolate make an awesome

combination.
Swensen's ice cream chain is the most ex
pensive: 50 cents a single and 95 cents for a
double scoop. All ice cream is made at the
individual stores. Great selection of flavors
and the most creamy-textured of ice creams
keep the fans returning. Swiss orange chip,
rum and raisin, and the finest French vanilla
around are favorites here.
Tucked away in the Charleston Shopping
Center, at the corner of Middlefield and
Charleston, Rick's Rather Rich is virtually un
known to the Stanford community.
"Rather Rich" describes its commestibles
such as mocha almond fudge and carob
honey. Rick's prices are quite reasonable and
the service is always cheery. Shakes here are
crowned with whipped cream and are sec
ond only to those of the legendary Peninsula
Creamery.
