# How healthy is yogurt?
## 
### 
As frozen yogurts become in
creasingly popular, one may
begin to wonder about the nut
ritional value of this so-called
"health food." How healthful a
snack is it?
U.S. Department of Agricul
ture studies indicate that
yogurt has a higher nutritional
value than fresh milk. How
ever, only a few brands of fro
zen yogurt have retained this
nutritional value and most are
on a par with ice cream.
Many yogurts, such as Knud
sen and Mario, contain suc
rose, a refined sugar. Extensive
medical research has shown
that sugar can raise one's
blood pressure, create an insu
lin reaction causing a "high"
and can be addicting.
Many are heavily saturated
with preservatives, emulsifiers
and stabilizers. Recent studies
are linking these additives to
cancer and other diseases.
Even additives considered to
be "natural" may be unsafe.
For example, studies have in

dicated that one stabilizer, car
rageenin, made from a
"natural" seaweed, may cause
intestinal ulcers.
Low quality yogurts are even
more fattening than ice cream.
A Baskin-Robbins ice cream
cone, for example, has approx
imately 300 calories while a
Knudsen frozen yogurt has
over 400.
Fortunately, there are higher
quality frozen yogurts availa
ble, name Alta-Dena and
Yonique. They are made with
real fruit and are sweetened
with honey and fructose rather

than refined sugar. These
sweetening agents are easier to
digest than sugar and their ef
fects are not as deleterious.
Doctors have even approved
Alta-Dena for their diabetic pa
tients.
Yonique and Alta-Dena fro
zen yogurts, while high in pro
tein, are low in calories. A
four-ounce serving is about 100
calories.
Most grocery stores and ice
cream shops, however, do not
stock the high quality yogurt.
Because of the extra time,
labor and research that goes
into these products, they are
more expensive, and many re
tail sellers are not willing to
sacrifice profit for quality.
One should not make broad
generalizations about the nut
ritional value of frozen yogurt.
Some brands are quite health
ful while others are anything
but. If in doubt, ask to see the
packaging. The ingredients tell
the whole story.
