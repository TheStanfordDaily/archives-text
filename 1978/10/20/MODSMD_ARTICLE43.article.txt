# Not by bread alone
## Stalking the big scoop 
### Harry Killas 
After a year of study and
travel in Europe, Harry Killas,
The Daily's resident food and
wine critic is back on the re
staurant page. This is the pre
mier article of his new biweekly
column on wining and dining.
Ask any returning Stanford
student about his overseas ex
perience, and he will inevitably
tell you about his travels, his
new friends and languages and
Vivoli's ice cream in Florence.
It has been said that Japanese
tourists patronize Gucci's be
fore the Uffizi Galleries; Stan
fordites, however, regardless
of which overseas campus they
attend, first make their pil
grimage to Vivoli's.
Vivoli's, and Italian icecream
in general, really is not ice
cream as we know it. It is
gelato, a word which loosely
translated means "ice," hence
the famed Italian "ices." Any
way, gelato is a much more
sensuous word than icecream.
Gelato incorporates the
same ingredients as ice cream:
eggs, milk and cream, sugar.
But Italians omit such integral
components as diatomes, plas
tics and carrageenin. Gelato is
usually made each morning
with the freshest of ingre

dients. It should be served in a
medium-hard, creamy state.
Instead of the traditional
cones, Italians devour their
gelato from bicchierini (tiny
paper cups) with plastic
spoons. Depending on the
size, one usually orders three
or four flavors. Furthermore,
Italians never mix fruit and
non-fruit flavors.
♦ * *
Vivoli's sits opposite the only
English language movie theater
in Florence. With its neon sign,
aquarium and Benny Good
man tapes, it is a mecca for ex
patriate students and artists.
Autographed photos of Italy's
best athletes adorn the walls.
Of special note is a postcard
from the south-west addressed
to: 'Vivoli's Ice Cream;
Europe.' (It actually reached
Florence!)
Once you arrive, ask for
croccantino al rhum (rum
crunch) and stracciatella
(chocolate chip); they were
both personal favorites. A par
ticularly potent Za6ag/one with
Marsala is known to cure a
Chianti hangover.
Vivoli's excels with its fruit
flavors Arancio (orange),
limone (lemon) and banana
taste fresher than the actual
fruit. Vivoli's fruit gelati are
seasonal; in late summer there
is fig gelato, and in winter,
gelato made with blood
oranges from Sicily.
Piero Vivoli, one of the two
owners, regards "the two mi
nutes of complete serenity" it
takes to demolish a Vivoli
gelato as his "service to man
kind."
Vivoli's was the most popu
lar gelateria with the Stanford
crowd, but I preferred Badiani.
Popular with the Florentine
bourgeoisi, Badiani's reputa
tion rests on its liquor-flavored
gelati: rum, gin, whiskey and
amaretto to name a few.
Badiani would still rank first
even if it offered only one
flavor: Buontalenti. Named for
one of Florence's Renaissance
architect's, Buontalenti is the
ambrosia of gelati. Top re
commendation.
The best time for Badiani's is
late afternoon, after shopping
and beforedinner. Don't go on
a Tuesday (it's closed), or on a
Sunday after the soccer game

lets out (it's worse than Car
neval).
Strategically located near the
Ponte Vecchio to trap the
tourist, Ponte Vecchio
Celateria is a relative new
comer to the gelato scene.
Owned and operated by two
Cypriots, Ponte Vecchio's
standouts include nocciola
(hazelnut), riso (rice with
orange) and the extra
ordinarily luxurious chocolate
mousse (number two-rated
flavor of all time). "The Pont,"
as it is sometimes called,
specializes in all fruit concoc
tions. Sumptuous Frullatis
(fruit-milk whips). Convenient
when shopping for leather ac
cessories.

Cavini, on Piazza delle Cure,
is gourmet-magazine-famous
for its coffee gelato; it is as dark
and rich as espresso. For those
who thrive on dumping sugar
into their espressi, it may be an
enjoyable experience. For me
it was merely an experience.
Cavini deserves praise for its
unusual selection of gelati.
Viennese (a very rich chocolate
chip), carciofi (artichoke), and
an extensive range of Italian
aperitif-flavored gelati are only
found at Cavini. The preferred
gelateria of the cognescenti
(Italians who Know).
Finally, II Capriccio, the
gelateria closest to the Stan
ford campus, has a charming
owner and great berry gelati.
So — if you are motivated
and the buses are not on strike,
you could probably sample all
five gelaterie in just more than
an hour. Otherwise, it is a lei
surely stroll along the River
Arno at night, whle the lights of
the Renaissance twinkle, a
gelato in one hand, a date in
the other, quietly trading
tastes.

After a year of study and
travel in Europe, Harry Killas,
The Daily's resident food and
wine critic is back on the re
staurant page. This is the pre
mier article of his new biweekly
column on wining and dining.
Ask any returning Stanford
student about his overseas ex
perience, and he will inevitably
tell you about his travels, his
new friends and languages and
Vivoli's ice cream in Florence.
It has been said that Japanese
tourists patronize Gucci's be
fore the Uffizi Galleries; Stan
fordites, however, regardless
of which overseas campus they
attend, first make their pil
grimage to Vivoli's.
Vivoli's, and Italian icecream
in general, really is not ice
cream as we know it. It is
gelato, a word which loosely
translated means "ice," hence
the famed Italian "ices." Any
way, gelato is a much more
sensuous word than icecream.
Gelato incorporates the
same ingredients as ice cream:
eggs, milk and cream, sugar.
But Italians omit such integral
components as diatomes, plas
tics and carrageenin. Gelato is
usually made each morning
with the freshest of ingre

dients. It should be served in a
medium-hard, creamy state.
Instead of the traditional
cones, Italians devour their
gelato from bicchierini (tiny
paper cups) with plastic
spoons. Depending on the
size, one usually orders three
or four flavors. Furthermore,
Italians never mix fruit and
non-fruit flavors.
♦ * *
Vivoli's sits opposite the only
English language movie theater
in Florence. With its neon sign,
aquarium and Benny Good
man tapes, it is a mecca for ex
patriate students and artists.
Autographed photos of Italy's
best athletes adorn the walls.
Of special note is a postcard
from the south-west addressed
to: 'Vivoli's Ice Cream;
Europe.' (It actually reached
Florence!)
Once you arrive, ask for
croccantino al rhum (rum
crunch) and stracciatella
(chocolate chip); they were
both personal favorites. A par
ticularly potent Za6ag/one with
Marsala is known to cure a
Chianti hangover.
Vivoli's excels with its fruit
flavors Arancio (orange),
limone (lemon) and banana
taste fresher than the actual
fruit. Vivoli's fruit gelati are
seasonal; in late summer there
is fig gelato, and in winter,
gelato made with blood
oranges from Sicily.
Piero Vivoli, one of the two
owners, regards "the two mi
nutes of complete serenity" it
takes to demolish a Vivoli
gelato as his "service to man
kind."
Vivoli's was the most popu
lar gelateria with the Stanford
crowd, but I preferred Badiani.
Popular with the Florentine
bourgeoisi, Badiani's reputa
tion rests on its liquor-flavored
gelati: rum, gin, whiskey and
amaretto to name a few.
Badiani would still rank first
even if it offered only one
flavor: Buontalenti. Named for
one of Florence's Renaissance
architect's, Buontalenti is the
ambrosia of gelati. Top re
commendation.
The best time for Badiani's is
late afternoon, after shopping
and beforedinner. Don't go on
a Tuesday (it's closed), or on a
Sunday after the soccer game

lets out (it's worse than Car
neval).
Strategically located near the
Ponte Vecchio to trap the
tourist, Ponte Vecchio
Celateria is a relative new
comer to the gelato scene.
Owned and operated by two
Cypriots, Ponte Vecchio's
standouts include nocciola
(hazelnut), riso (rice with
orange) and the extra
ordinarily luxurious chocolate
mousse (number two-rated
flavor of all time). "The Pont,"
as it is sometimes called,
specializes in all fruit concoc
tions. Sumptuous Frullatis
(fruit-milk whips). Convenient
when shopping for leather ac
cessories.
♦ * «
Cavini, on Piazza delle Cure,
is gourmet-magazine-famous
for its coffee gelato; it is as dark
and rich as espresso. For those
who thrive on dumping sugar
into their espressi, it may be an
enjoyable experience. For me
it was merely an experience.
Cavini deserves praise for its
unusual selection of gelati.
Viennese (a very rich chocolate
chip), carciofi (artichoke), and
an extensive range of Italian
aperitif-flavored gelati are only
found at Cavini. The preferred
gelateria of the cognescenti
(Italians who Know).
Finally, II Capriccio, the
gelateria closest to the Stan
ford campus, has a charming
owner and great berry gelati.
So — if you are motivated
and the buses are not on strike,
you could probably sample all
five gelaterie in just more than
an hour. Otherwise, it is a lei
surely stroll along the River
Arno at night, whle the lights of

an extensive range of Italian
aperitif-flavored gelati are only
found at Cavini. The preferred
gelateria of the cognescenti
(Italians who Know).
Finally, II Capriccio, the
gelateria closest to the Stan
ford campus, has a charming
owner and great berry gelati.
So — if you are motivated
and the buses are not on strike,
you could probably sample all
five gelaterie in just more than
an hour. Otherwise, it is a lei
surely stroll along the River
Arno at night, whle the lights of
the Renaissance twinkle, a
gelato in one hand, a date in
the other, quietly trading
tastes.

After a year of study and
travel in Europe, Harry Killas,
The Daily's resident food and
wine critic is back on the re
staurant page. This is the pre
mier article of his new biweekly
column on wining and dining.
Ask any returning Stanford
student about his overseas ex
perience, and he will inevitably
tell you about his travels, his
new friends and languages and
Vivoli's ice cream in Florence.
It has been said that Japanese
tourists patronize Gucci's be
fore the Uffizi Galleries; Stan
fordites, however, regardless
of which overseas campus they
attend, first make their pil
grimage to Vivoli's.
Vivoli's, and Italian icecream
in general, really is not ice
cream as we know it. It is
gelato, a word which loosely
translated means "ice," hence
the famed Italian "ices." Any
way, gelato is a much more
sensuous word than icecream.
Gelato incorporates the
same ingredients as ice cream:
eggs, milk and cream, sugar.
But Italians omit such integral
components as diatomes, plas
tics and carrageenin. Gelato is
usually made each morning
with the freshest of ingre

dients. It should be served in a
medium-hard, creamy state.
Instead of the traditional
cones, Italians devour their
gelato from bicchierini (tiny
paper cups) with plastic
spoons. Depending on the
size, one usually orders three
or four flavors. Furthermore,
Italians never mix fruit and
non-fruit flavors.

Vivoli's sits opposite the only
English language movie theater
in Florence. With its neon sign,
aquarium and Benny Good
man tapes, it is a mecca for ex
patriate students and artists.
Autographed photos of Italy's
best athletes adorn the walls.
Of special note is a postcard
from the south-west addressed
to: 'Vivoli's Ice Cream;
Europe.' (It actually reached
Florence!)
Once you arrive, ask for
croccantino al rhum (rum
crunch) and stracciatella
(chocolate chip); they were
both personal favorites. A par
ticularly potent Za6ag/one with
Marsala is known to cure a
Chianti hangover.
Vivoli's excels with its fruit
flavors Arancio (orange),
limone (lemon) and banana
taste fresher than the actual
fruit. Vivoli's fruit gelati are
seasonal; in late summer there
is fig gelato, and in winter,
gelato made with blood
oranges from Sicily.
Piero Vivoli, one of the two
owners, regards "the two mi
nutes of complete serenity" it
takes to demolish a Vivoli
gelato as his "service to man
kind."
Vivoli's was the most popu
lar gelateria with the Stanford
crowd, but I preferred Badiani.
Popular with the Florentine
bourgeoisi, Badiani's reputa
tion rests on its liquor-flavored
gelati: rum, gin, whiskey and
amaretto to name a few.
Badiani would still rank first
even if it offered only one
flavor: Buontalenti. Named for
one of Florence's Renaissance
architect's, Buontalenti is the
ambrosia of gelati. Top re
commendation.
The best time for Badiani's is
late afternoon, after shopping
and beforedinner. Don't go on
a Tuesday (it's closed), or on a
Sunday after the soccer game

lets out (it's worse than Car
neval).
Strategically located near the
Ponte Vecchio to trap the
tourist, Ponte Vecchio
Celateria is a relative new
comer to the gelato scene.
Owned and operated by two
Cypriots, Ponte Vecchio's
standouts include nocciola
(hazelnut), riso (rice with
orange) and the extra
ordinarily luxurious chocolate
mousse (number two-rated
flavor of all time). "The Pont,"
as it is sometimes called,
specializes in all fruit concoc
tions. Sumptuous Frullatis
(fruit-milk whips). Convenient
when shopping for leather ac
cessories.

Cavini, on Piazza delle Cure,
is gourmet-magazine-famous
for its coffee gelato; it is as dark
and rich as espresso. For those
who thrive on dumping sugar
into their espressi, it may be an
enjoyable experience. For me
it was merely an experience.
Cavini deserves praise for its
unusual selection of gelati.
Viennese (a very rich chocolate
chip), carciofi (artichoke), and
an extensive range of Italian
aperitif-flavored gelati are only
found at Cavini. The preferred
gelateria of the cognescenti
(Italians who Know).
Finally, II Capriccio, the
gelateria closest to the Stan
ford campus, has a charming
owner and great berry gelati.

and the buses are not on strike,

surely stroll along the River
