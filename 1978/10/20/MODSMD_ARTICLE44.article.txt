# At Stanford Shopping Center
## Robinson's deli a polished operation 
### 
Generally speaking, there are three
kinds of delicatessen. There are family op
erations with a loyal clientel run by the
descendants of an old man with a heavy
accent; there are thinly-veiled bars with
cheap food and peanut shells on the floor.
And then there are the polished opera
tions with exotic brands of coffee and
Scandanavian flags in the window. Need
less to say, there are advantages to each
method of operation, and accordingly
they ought to be viewed with these differ
ences in mind.
Robinson's, a newly-opened deli in the
Stanford Shopping Center, is decidedly a
polished operation. It is very clean, and
organized, and none of the tabletops have
names carved into them — it is not particu
larly cheap, but the food is rather good,
and they serve their sandwiches on china
plates.
Yet "sandwiches" is not an accurate en
capsulation of what Robinson's offers.

Their menu makes mention of "appetiz
ers, soups, gourmet burgers, fresh veget
able and seafood salads, daily hot entrees,
and desserts" — they also have breakfast,
pizza, beer and a catering service. Even a
wine list.

I refer to the freshness of
bread on the plate, and the
presence of pickle slices.
Love those pickle slices.

But let's be reasonable. What college
student in his or her right mind is going to
go to a deli because it has a wine list? The
important things for people in our posi
tion are cost, atmosphere and the quality
and thickness of the stuff between the
slices — weaknesses there send a place

down the dumper no matter what else it
has to offer.
Fortunately, Robinson's has all of the
above. The sandwiches I ate were not
bulging at the seams, but they were very
good and effectively prepared (by "effec
tively prepared" I do not refer to the
toothpicks with the shredded cellophane
attached — I refer to the freshness of
bread on the plate, and the presence of
the pickle slices. Love those pickle slices).
And there is much to be said for the or
ganized means by which meals are ob
tained therein, as well as the presence of
tables sufficient to provide seating in all
but the worst of rush hours.
It's a good restaurant, is what it is — hear
enough to bomb in upon for a lunch
shoved in between classes, good enough
to insure that most such visits will be re
peated. Monday-Saturday 7 a.m.-9 p.m.,
Sunday 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Very polished. Five
bucks should do you well.
