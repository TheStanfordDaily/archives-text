# Candidates clash in state attorney general's race
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” Republican state Sen.
George Deukmejian called Democratic con
gresswoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke a
"Jane-come-lately" on criminal law issues,
and she accused him of "scraping the barrel"
during the waning days of their race for at
torney general.
"Look at her own campaign brochures,"
Deukmejian said during their debate Wed
nesday night. "There is not one single refer
ence to one bill she has authored in this
(criminal justice) field."

Burke countered by detailing her service as
a Los Angeles police commissioner hearing
officer and her work on a national rape com
mission, plus her experience as a criminal
lawyer.
However, although both candidates vigor
ously sought to prove their superiority in law
enforcement legislation, they repeatedly ex
pressed personal respect for each other in a
relatively tame debate that was taped for
KN\T-TV's Newsmakers program to be aired
Sunday.
