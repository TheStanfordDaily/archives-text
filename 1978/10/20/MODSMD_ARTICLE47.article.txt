Women's cancer rates rise
Washington — Lung cancer, by far the dead
liest of the three most common cancers, has
increased dramatically among women in this
decade, according to a new statistical report
prepared by the National Cancer Institute.
The institute said the new figures indicate
cancer cases generally have been increasing 1
percent to 2 percent a year since 1970, whereas
the lung cancer rate among white women has
risen 8 percent a year and among black women
nearly 10 percent.
Scientists who have noted the rising lung
cancer rate in women have blamed it on in
creased cigarette smoking among women
since World War 11.
Dayan doubts talks success
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan told President Jimmy Carter yes
terday negotiations on an Egyptian-Israeli
peace agreement have encountered problems
and chances of settling them are "very doubt
ful."

It was the second time this week — the first
time was Tuesday — that Dayan made a public
statement which contradicted the optimism
voiced by the conference's official spokes
man, George Sherman of the State Depart
ment, who has reported steady progress since
the talks began.
It appeared from Dayan's comments that
further discussions involving Carter, Begin
and Sadat might be necessary.
Meanwhile, informed sources said Israel is
talking to the administration about a new
billion-dollar aid program to finance its with
drawal from the Sinai.
Carter OKs Russian travel
Washington — The Carter administration has
quietly lifted a moratorium on most high level
visits to the Soviet Union imposed to protest
actions by Moscow against dissidents and U.S.
businessmen and reporters, administration of
ficials said yesterday.
The officials, who asked not to be identified,
said the new policy reflects a changed Soviet
attitude, which has helped improve the at

mosphere between the two countries since
last summer when Moscow charged two
American newsmen with slandering the gov
ernment and accused a U.S. businessman of
currency violations.
The improved climate coincides with sig
nificant progress toward a new arms limitation
agreement. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko
will meet in Moscow in a few days for what they
hope will be the climactic round of a six-year
effort to limit the strategic arms race.
B-52 plunges into farmfield
March Air Force Base — Five crewmen were
killed and a sixth injured yesterday when an
aging, fuel-laden B-52 bomber crashed and
burned in a rural field - narrowly missing a
farmhouse — seconds after takeoff from this
busy Strategic Air Command base.
The massive 244-ton, eight-engine craft was
on a routine training mission with six crewmen
aboard when it crashed in a light morning fog,
said Air Force spokesman Capt. Carl Rossman.
No nuclear or conventional weapons were

aboard, he said, but the jet was carrying
366,000 gallons of fuel.
The 7:35 a.m. crash occurred in a plowed
field near the intersection of Markham and
Indian streets, about two miles southeast of
March between the Riverside County com
munities of Sunnymead and Perris 65 miles
east of Los Angeles.
Stocks continue to plummet
New York — Stock prices fell sharply again
yesterday, giving no sign of a letup in the
gloom that nas gripped the market since the
start of the week.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
13.26 to 846.41, with about 6 points of that loss
coming in the last half hour.
Big Board volume came to 31.81 million
shares, against 32.94 million Wednesday.
Today's weather
Low clouds fog and drizzle with local after
noon clearing through tomorrow. Little temp
erature change. Lows in the 50s. Highs both
days in the low 70s.

B-52 plunges into farmfield
March Air Force Base — Five crewmen were
killed and a sixth injured yesterday when an
aging, fuel-laden B-52 bomber crashed and
burned in a rural field - narrowly missing a
farmhouse — seconds after takeoff from this
busy Strategic Air Command base.
The massive 244-ton, eight-engine craft was
on a routine training mission with six crewmen
aboard when it crashed in a light morning fog,
said Air Force spokesman Capt. Carl Rossman.
No nuclear or conventional weapons were

aboard, he said, but the jet was carrying
366,000 gallons of fuel.
The 7:35 a.m. crash occurred in a plowed
field near the intersection of Markham and
Indian streets, about two miles southeast of
March between the Riverside County com
munities of Sunnymead and Perris 65 miles
east of Los Angeles.

coming in the last half hour.

Women's cancer rates rise
Washington — Lung cancer, by far the dead
liest of the three most common cancers, has
increased dramatically among women in this
decade, according to a new statistical report
prepared by the National Cancer Institute.
The institute said the new figures indicate
cancer cases generally have been increasing 1
percent to 2 percent a year since 1970, whereas
the lung cancer rate among white women has
risen 8 percent a year and among black women
nearly 10 percent.
Scientists who have noted the rising lung
cancer rate in women have blamed it on in
creased cigarette smoking among women
since World War 11.
Dayan doubts talks success
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan told President Jimmy Carter yes
terday negotiations on an Egyptian-Israeli
peace agreement have encountered problems
and chances of settling them are "very doubt
ful."

It was the second time this week — the first
time was Tuesday — that Dayan made a public
statement which contradicted the optimism
voiced by the conference's official spokes
man, George Sherman of the State Depart
ment, who has reported steady progress since
the talks began.
It appeared from Dayan's comments that
further discussions involving Carter, Begin
and Sadat might be necessary.
Meanwhile, informed sources said Israel is
talking to the administration about a new
billion-dollar aid program to finance its with
drawal from the Sinai.
Carter OKs Russian travel
Washington — The Carter administration has
quietly lifted a moratorium on most high level
visits to the Soviet Union imposed to protest
actions by Moscow against dissidents and U.S.
businessmen and reporters, administration of
ficials said yesterday.
The officials, who asked not to be identified,
said the new policy reflects a changed Soviet
attitude, which has helped improve the at
