"Poverty inhibits the exercise of
civil liberties," said Dr. Mary Dunlap,
attorney and member of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
At a meeting of the Mid-Peninsula
chapter of the ACLU held in Kresge
Auditorium last night, Dunlap said
the ACLU should make poverty a
central priority.
"Economic equality is an integral
component of equal rights," she
said. "An individual must have one to
fully exercise the other."
Dunlap used the economic status
of women to illustrate her point.

Quoting the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights Report, she stated that 54
percent of female-headed families
have incomes below the poverty
level.
According to Dunlap, women at
this level are less likely than more
affluent women to file suit against an
employer who they feel is dis
criminatory.
"The fear of retaliation — of losing
her job — would inhibit her from en
forcing hercivil rights," Dunlap said.
"This amounts to discrimination
on the basis of wealth," she con-
tinued. "It makes civil liberties mean
ingless to the poor."
Dunlap also discussed the recent
controversy over ACLU's defense of
the American Nazi Party's right to
march in Skokie, Illinois.
"That decision caused enormous
conflict within the organization,"
she said.
"Yet one of the greatest challenges
facing the ACLU is to protect the civil
rights of all minorities, not just those
with whom we are sympathetic," she
added.
"We had to strike a balance bet
ween protecting the Nazis' right to
free speech on the one hand and the
rights of the groups that Nazis seek
to destroy on the other," Dunlap
said. "It was difficult.
"It's too soon to tell how successful
we were at striking that balance," she
continued. "But it is important that
we recognize the problem that we
often represent conflicting interests
and that we continue to try and rep
resent such interests fairly."
