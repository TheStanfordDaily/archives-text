# Lease proposal to be reviewed
## 
### LESLIE LAYTON 
The University received a formal
proposal from a conference service
company last week for the lease of 20
to 25 acres of University property.
Executive Assistant to the Vice-
President for Business and Finance
Dan DeYoung said that the Harrison
Conference Service Corporation —
one of the nation's largest confer
ence center companies — is in
terested in establishing a conference
center on University land adjacent to
Highway 280.
DeYoung said a group of Univer
sity administrators and faculty will be
appointed to study the proposal and
discuss whether it is consistent with
the University's educational re
quirements and its land use policy.
DeYoung declined to discuss the
proposal the New York-based com
pany has made to the University, but
said there are several sites they are

interested in leasing.
"They're approaching us as a
commercial organization," DeYoung
said, referring to the fact that the
University is legally restricted from
selling its land, but can lease it for
commerical purposes, as it has with
the Stanford Shopping Center.
DeYoung also said there are other
companies interested in leasing Uni
versity land for similar purposes, but
he emphasized there has been no
consensus among administrators
that a conference center would con
stitute the best use of Stanford's
land.
"I expect the examination of the
issue to be rigorous," DeYoung said.
"Everyone has something to say on
these things. Stanford is not just one
thing — it includes alumni, faculty,
staff and students."
DeYoung added, however, that
the initial study of the issue would be

made by a group composed only of
administrators and faculty.
They will forward their recom
mendation to the vice president for
business and finance, William
Massy, as well as to President Richard
Lyman, and possibly even the Board
of Trustees, before a final decision is
made.
Harrison Conference Center
Company is proposing a center that
would accomodate professional,
educational and business meetings.
The company owns eight other such
centers, located throughout the
Midwest, the South, and on the East
Coast.
Harrison has been interested in es
tablishing a center on Mid-Peninsula
property, and has been negotiating
with University representatives for
several weeks.
DeYoung said the study group will
be appointed sometime in the next
few weeks.
