# At Old Pavilion
## Temporary office space remains

At the entrance of this magnificent structure,

here.
Erected in the early 1920s for athletic use. the build
ing is now being used as office space for more than
100 University employees. This facility is the Old
Pavilion, located at the corner of Galvez and Serra,
between Encina Hall and the Athletic Department.
But why would an old gymnasium be turned into
office space?
The transition took place in the summer pf '72
when a fire gutted the East Wing of Encina Hall, leav
ing many University employees without a place to do
business.
At that time, the empty gymnasium seemed a suita
ble place to temporarily accommodate the
employees.
The Old Pavilion was to be used for "six months at
the most," but in 1977, it was decided that this old
arena would never again host basketball games or
volleyball matches, but would serve as the perma
nent home of the Planning and Personnel depart
ments. In May of 1977, remodeling began on the Old
Pavilion.
The Pavilion was remodeled by San Francisco de
signer Barry Brukoff. With its wide-open spaces, red
brick walls, icy-clad balconies, and potted trees and
plants artfully arranged throughout the structure, this
facility might beconsidered one of the most desirable

working spaces on campus.
But there have been problems with the facility,
which include lighting, air conditioning, noise, over
crowding and lack of privacy.
The overhead halides cause distracting shadows
and generally are not supplying enough light. How
ever, there are efforts underway to improve this situa
tion.
There is no air conditioning. The building is simply
too large to air condition, either economically or effi
ciently. Instead, two huge ducts serve as the Pavil
ion's heating and cooling system. Through one duct
fresh air is pumped in, while through the other, stale
air is pumped out. In winter, one of the ducts, in
conjunction with a heating device located in the
lobby of the building, pumps in Warm air.
There was some concern in the beginning that, in
the open air, with the typing, xeroxing, people talk
ing and walking around, an unbearable noise level
would be created, but as Associate Planner Steve
Schmidt put it,"It just didn't materialize." Schmidt
explained that the several noises combined to create
an "ambience of sound" that was not at all intolera
ble. "As long as you sit below the partition's top, you
don't experience any distracting noise," he said.
As for overcrowding, Schmidt said, "It's easier to
interact with your associates." He noted that if he
wanted to find someone all he had to do was stand up
and look over the partitions to find him. The planner
also said there are manv more "face to face conversa-

tions here (as opposed to telephone conversations)"
due to the close proximity of the offices.
Standing on the platform just beyond the lobby,
one can look into virtually any office. This lack of
privacy was noted even before remodeling began,
and was one of the factors involved in determining
which departments would use the Pavilion.
Schmidt explained that Planning and Personnel are
"two large departments that don't have extremely
sensitive issues, that don't need high security . . .
that would fit into this space and whose work would
not be affected by the open air."
Other departments, displaced not only by the fire
in the East Wing of Encina but also by the shutting
down later of the South Wing as an earthquake
hazard, were relocated in Galvez House and other
University facilities.
Still, one might ask why an athletic facility, rather
than some other type of building, was sacrificed for
the sake of office space.
"We weren't poaching on the Athletic Depart
ment," said Schmidt. "They gave it to the business
office."
"We got a call. They said they needed it," explained

Associate Athletic Director Bob Young. "We really
had no choice in the matter."
The Board of Trustees decided that the Old Pavilion
was more valuable as office space than as an athletic
facility, despite the fact that the University has a shor
tage of adequate indoor athletic space.
According to Dottie McCrea, women's basketball
coach, "there's a definite need for another facility."
"The impact is put more on intramurals, and the
students themselves, not so much on varsity sports,"
she added.
Young said he realizes the move was necessary.
"We're all part of the University, so we were all fortu
nate in that we had space to put Planning and Person
nel."
The return of the Old Pavilion to an athletic facility
is still possible, even if improbable.
"The basketball floor is still here," said Schmidt.
"The floor of the office facilities is built five inches
above the gym floor.
"There's no fixed investment in this building. The
furniture, everything, could be moved if this was
changed back to an athletic facility."
More than likely, however, the Old Pavilion will
remain an office building.

the few lasting reminders of the building's former use as a basketball
gymnasium.
At the entrance of this magnificent structure,
stained glass windows show Stanford basketball
players in action But basketball is no longer played
here.
Erected in the early 1920s for athletic use. the build
ing is now being used as office space for more than
100 University employees. This facility is the Old
Pavilion, located at the corner of Galvez and Serra,
between Encina Hall and the Athletic Department.
But why would an old gymnasium be turned into
office space?
The transition took place in the summer pf '72
when a fire gutted the East Wing of Encina Hall, leav
ing many University employees without a place to do
business.
At that time, the empty gymnasium seemed a suita
ble place to temporarily accommodate the
employees.
The Old Pavilion was to be used for "six months at
the most," but in 1977, it was decided that this old
arena would never again host basketball games or
volleyball matches, but would serve as the perma
nent home of the Planning and Personnel depart
ments. In May of 1977, remodeling began on the Old
Pavilion.
The Pavilion was remodeled by San Francisco de
signer Barry Brukoff. With its wide-open spaces, red
brick walls, icy-clad balconies, and potted trees and
plants artfully arranged throughout the structure, this
facility might beconsidered one of the most desirable

working spaces on campus.
But there have been problems with the facility,
which include lighting, air conditioning, noise, over
crowding and lack of privacy.
The overhead halides cause distracting shadows
and generally are not supplying enough light. How
ever, there are efforts underway to improve this situa
tion.
There is no air conditioning. The building is simply
too large to air condition, either economically or effi
ciently. Instead, two huge ducts serve as the Pavil
ion's heating and cooling system. Through one duct
fresh air is pumped in, while through the other, stale
air is pumped out. In winter, one of the ducts, in
conjunction with a heating device located in the
lobby of the building, pumps in Warm air.
There was some concern in the beginning that, in
the open air, with the typing, xeroxing, people talk
ing and walking around, an unbearable noise level
would be created, but as Associate Planner Steve
Schmidt put it,"It just didn't materialize." Schmidt
explained that the several noises combined to create
an "ambience of sound" that was not at all intolera
ble. "As long as you sit below the partition's top, you
don't experience any distracting noise," he said.
As for overcrowding, Schmidt said, "It's easier to
interact with your associates." He noted that if he
wanted to find someone all he had to do was stand up
and look over the partitions to find him. The planner
also said there are manv more "face to face conversa-

tions here (as opposed to telephone conversations)"
due to the close proximity of the offices.
Standing on the platform just beyond the lobby,
one can look into virtually any office. This lack of
privacy was noted even before remodeling began,
and was one of the factors involved in determining
which departments would use the Pavilion.
Schmidt explained that Planning and Personnel are
"two large departments that don't have extremely
sensitive issues, that don't need high security . . .
that would fit into this space and whose work would
not be affected by the open air."
Other departments, displaced not only by the fire
in the East Wing of Encina but also by the shutting
down later of the South Wing as an earthquake
hazard, were relocated in Galvez House and other
University facilities.
Still, one might ask why an athletic facility, rather
than some other type of building, was sacrificed for
the sake of office space.
"We weren't poaching on the Athletic Depart
ment," said Schmidt. "They gave it to the business
office."
"We got a call. They said they needed it," explained

Associate Athletic Director Bob Young. "We really
had no choice in the matter."
The Board of Trustees decided that the Old Pavilion
was more valuable as office space than as an athletic
facility, despite the fact that the University has a shor
tage of adequate indoor athletic space.
According to Dottie McCrea, women's basketball
coach, "there's a definite need for another facility."
"The impact is put more on intramurals, and the
students themselves, not so much on varsity sports,"
she added.
Young said he realizes the move was necessary.
"We're all part of the University, so we were all fortu
nate in that we had space to put Planning and Person
nel."
The return of the Old Pavilion to an athletic facility
is still possible, even if improbable.
"The basketball floor is still here," said Schmidt.
"The floor of the office facilities is built five inches
above the gym floor.
"There's no fixed investment in this building. The
furniture, everything, could be moved if this was
changed back to an athletic facility."
More than likely, however, the Old Pavilion will
remain an office building.

This stained glass window, situated on the front of the Old Pavilion, is one of
the few lasting reminders of the building's former use as a basketball
gymnasium.
At the entrance of this magnificent structure,
stained glass windows show Stanford basketball
players in action But basketball is no longer played
here.
Erected in the early 1920s for athletic use. the build
ing is now being used as office space for more than
100 University employees. This facility is the Old
Pavilion, located at the corner of Galvez and Serra,
between Encina Hall and the Athletic Department.
But why would an old gymnasium be turned into
office space?
The transition took place in the summer pf '72
when a fire gutted the East Wing of Encina Hall, leav
ing many University employees without a place to do
business.
At that time, the empty gymnasium seemed a suita
ble place to temporarily accommodate the
employees.
The Old Pavilion was to be used for "six months at
the most," but in 1977, it was decided that this old
arena would never again host basketball games or
volleyball matches, but would serve as the perma
nent home of the Planning and Personnel depart
ments. In May of 1977, remodeling began on the Old
Pavilion.
The Pavilion was remodeled by San Francisco de
signer Barry Brukoff. With its wide-open spaces, red
brick walls, icy-clad balconies, and potted trees and
plants artfully arranged throughout the structure, this
facility might beconsidered one of the most desirable

working spaces on campus.
But there have been problems with the facility,
which include lighting, air conditioning, noise, over
crowding and lack of privacy.
The overhead halides cause distracting shadows
and generally are not supplying enough light. How
ever, there are efforts underway to improve this situa
tion.
There is no air conditioning. The building is simply
too large to air condition, either economically or effi
ciently. Instead, two huge ducts serve as the Pavil
ion's heating and cooling system. Through one duct
fresh air is pumped in, while through the other, stale
air is pumped out. In winter, one of the ducts, in
conjunction with a heating device located in the
lobby of the building, pumps in Warm air.
There was some concern in the beginning that, in
the open air, with the typing, xeroxing, people talk
ing and walking around, an unbearable noise level
would be created, but as Associate Planner Steve
Schmidt put it,"It just didn't materialize." Schmidt
explained that the several noises combined to create
an "ambience of sound" that was not at all intolera
ble. "As long as you sit below the partition's top, you
don't experience any distracting noise," he said.
As for overcrowding, Schmidt said, "It's easier to
interact with your associates." He noted that if he
wanted to find someone all he had to do was stand up
and look over the partitions to find him. The planner
also said there are manv more "face to face conversa-

tions here (as opposed to telephone conversations)"
due to the close proximity of the offices.
Standing on the platform just beyond the lobby,
one can look into virtually any office. This lack of
privacy was noted even before remodeling began,
and was one of the factors involved in determining
which departments would use the Pavilion.
Schmidt explained that Planning and Personnel are
"two large departments that don't have extremely
sensitive issues, that don't need high security . . .
that would fit into this space and whose work would
not be affected by the open air."
Other departments, displaced not only by the fire
in the East Wing of Encina but also by the shutting
down later of the South Wing as an earthquake
hazard, were relocated in Galvez House and other
University facilities.
Still, one might ask why an athletic facility, rather
than some other type of building, was sacrificed for
the sake of office space.
"We weren't poaching on the Athletic Depart
ment," said Schmidt. "They gave it to the business
office."
"We got a call. They said they needed it," explained

Associate Athletic Director Bob Young. "We really
had no choice in the matter."
The Board of Trustees decided that the Old Pavilion
was more valuable as office space than as an athletic
facility, despite the fact that the University has a shor
tage of adequate indoor athletic space.
According to Dottie McCrea, women's basketball
coach, "there's a definite need for another facility."
"The impact is put more on intramurals, and the
students themselves, not so much on varsity sports,"
she added.
Young said he realizes the move was necessary.
"We're all part of the University, so we were all fortu
nate in that we had space to put Planning and Person
nel."
The return of the Old Pavilion to an athletic facility
is still possible, even if improbable.
"The basketball floor is still here," said Schmidt.
"The floor of the office facilities is built five inches
above the gym floor.
"There's no fixed investment in this building. The
furniture, everything, could be moved if this was
changed back to an athletic facility."
More than likely, however, the Old Pavilion will
remain an office building.
