Can anyone find out the reason for me as to
why students and staff must carry a permit up to
the Dish?

Doug Yoshida, former Bug Me columnist, said
in his column of Jan. 27,1978, that according to
George Burtness, then an assistant manager for
land resources, the land has been leased to
Manuel Piers of Piers Dairy.
Yoshida said, "Picknickers and joggers are not
particularly welcome, for many reasons: it is
private land; there is a fire hazard; some people
leave trash behind; Piers loses about 20 cattle
pe r "ear to family dogs; and there is a danger
with people getting into the radio-science
equipment."
Veena Coleman, assistant to the Manager of
Real Estate, said this reasoning still applies.
Anyone with a Stanford I .D. may obtain a permit
in the Business and Finance Office, 105 Encina.
"It is merely a way of limiting the number of
people up there," she said.

Is there anything under the plates in the Quad
designated with the years of the graduating clas
ses? If so, what? What is under the plate with the
earliest date?
-P.B.
Mary Blessing, a library specialist at the Uni
versity Archvies, said "The Memoris of Ray
Lyman Wilbur" and"The Stanford Alumnus"
contain information regarding this tradition.

According to these sources, Blessing said the
class of '96 started the tradition. They placed a
time capsule under the plate, she said.
The time capsules traditionally consist of a
listing of the members of the class and a written
class history, she added. Many classes sup
posedly have left additional paraphernalia, al
though there is no written record of it.
After the tradition started, earlier classes re
turned to lay their plates and time capsules in,
she said. The first class to return was the class of
'95.
Otherwise known as the Pioneer Class, this
was the first class to complete four years here,
Blessing said. She added that they originally had
put up a commemoratory plaque on an Oak tree
near the Inner Quad. The tree was removed
when the Outer Quad was built at the turn of the
century.
The names ot graduating seniors are listed in
"Stanford Alumni 1891-1955" to be found in the
archives, she said. The listings of seniors from
1955 to the present can be found in the student
directories kept on file there.
There are no written records of any class his
tories, Blessing said. The histories included
"whatever that class felt was important," she
added.
If future classes wish written documentation
of their history and/or a listing of whatever else
they might place in their time capsules, she said
they should contact the University Archives lo
cated on the third floor of Green Library.

class of '96 started the tradition. They placed a
time capsule under the plate, she said.
The time capsules traditionally consist of a
listing of the members of the class and a written
class history, she added. Many classes sup
posedly have left additional paraphernalia, al
though there is no written record of it.
After the tradition started, earlier classes re
turned to lay their plates and time capsules in,
she said. The first class to return was the class of
'95.
Otherwise known as the Pioneer Class, this
was the first class to complete four years here,
Blessing said. She added that they originally had
put up a commemoratory plaque on an Oak tree
near the Inner Quad. The tree was removed
when the Outer Quad was built at the turn of the
century.
The names ot graduating seniors are listed in
"Stanford Alumni 1891-1955" to be found in the
archives, she said. The listings of seniors from
1955 to the present can be found in the student
directories kept on file there.
There are no written records of any class his
tories, Blessing said. The histories included
"whatever that class felt was important," she
added.
If future classes wish written documentation
of their history and/or a listing of whatever else
they might place in their time capsules, she said
they should contact the University Archives lo
cated on the third floor of Green Library.

Can anyone find out the reason for me as to
why students and staff must carry a permit up to
the Dish?

Doug Yoshida, former Bug Me columnist, said
in his column of Jan. 27,1978, that according to
George Burtness, then an assistant manager for
land resources, the land has been leased to
Manuel Piers of Piers Dairy.
Yoshida said, "Picknickers and joggers are not
particularly welcome, for many reasons: it is
private land; there is a fire hazard; some people
leave trash behind; Piers loses about 20 cattle
pe r "ear to family dogs; and there is a danger
with people getting into the radio-science
equipment."
Veena Coleman, assistant to the Manager of
Real Estate, said this reasoning still applies.
Anyone with a Stanford I .D. may obtain a permit
in the Business and Finance Office, 105 Encina.
"It is merely a way of limiting the number of
people up there," she said.

Is there anything under the plates in the Quad
designated with the years of the graduating clas
ses? If so, what? What is under the plate with the
earliest date?

Mary Blessing, a library specialist at the Uni
