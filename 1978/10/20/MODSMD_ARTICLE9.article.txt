# TV goes from wasteland to electronic wonderland

Escape into a world of fan
tasy or a world of reality and
illusion. Travel back in time to
historic battles or forward to
visit strange worlds in another
galaxy. Drive a race car,
explore new lands, or pilot a
starship.
A pitch for Disneyland? A
new television series? It's actu
ally a little of both. According
to experts, these and other
subjects can be made possible
by the advances in the art of
television games.
"It's going to be like a win
dow on the world,'' said Robert
Lucky of Bell Laboratories in a
seminar for the Stanford In
formation Systems Laboratory
yesterday.
"You can do things you
wouldn't be able to do in real
life."
The system uses home-to
home telephone hook-ups to
add new dimensions to games
such as chess and bridge. By
dialing a certain number, a
player could be hooked by
computer to a game with a
player of equal expertise at any
time.
People to people
"It's not the kind of game
you think about now,"
explained Lucky. 'You're not
playing against a computer."
This game network would dif
fer from others like the so
called home-video "Pong"
game because the system
would work as "a broker to
connect people up to people,
and let people play the
games."
The technology needed for
this is "not a simple thing, but
it can be done," he said. Some
games, like chess and bridge,
could be made available now.
For the more complex
scenarios like "Star Trek' or
war games, Lucky admits that
"the only part we've actually
got working right now is the
background generator."
Currently, an idea similar to

the system described by Lucky
is on trial use in England. To
use this system, called PRE
STEL, a player keys in a "user
number" and is connected
with a computer. The services
offered by PRESTEL include in
formation on news, weather,
sports, gardens-and travel. The
information sought is dis
played on the TV screen.
Average users
While this type of service is
beneficial, Lucky said, "an av
erage telephone user would be
able to take full advantage only
about every five years." The
way to get your money's worth
from the system, he added,
would be through the addition
of games to the news network.
"Games are thriving at an all
time high. There is a wholecult
of fantasy games," Lucky said,

explaining the interest in this
kind of program. "People are a
little bit afraid of (these kind of)
games," but they are "inevita
ble."
There has been a great deal
of comment on the social im
pact of the program, he said.
The dangers and advantages
are many and varied. The
greatest danger, said Lucky, is
that "kids could get hooked
and have their minds turn to
jelly."
Vicarious lives
He also talked about the
possibilities of people living to
tally vicarious lives through the
system.
"Combine (this technology)
with communications, and you
get a very potent force that can
change people's lives, even in
a little way."

of games to the news network.
"Games are thriving at an all
time high. There is a wholecult
of fantasy games," Lucky said,

explaining the interest in this
kind of program. "People are a
little bit afraid of (these kind of)
games," but they are "inevita
ble."
There has been a great deal
of comment on the social im
pact of the program, he said.
The dangers and advantages
are many and varied. The
greatest danger, said Lucky, is
that "kids could get hooked
and have their minds turn to
jelly."
Vicarious lives
He also talked about the
possibilities of people living to
tally vicarious lives through the
system.
"Combine (this technology)
with communications, and you
get a very potent force that can
change people's lives, even in
a little way."
Escape into a world of fan
tasy or a world of reality and
illusion. Travel back in time to
historic battles or forward to
visit strange worlds in another
galaxy. Drive a race car,
explore new lands, or pilot a
starship.
A pitch for Disneyland? A
new television series? It's actu
ally a little of both. According
to experts, these and other
subjects can be made possible
by the advances in the art of
television games.
"It's going to be like a win
dow on the world,'' said Robert
Lucky of Bell Laboratories in a
seminar for the Stanford In
formation Systems Laboratory
yesterday.
"You can do things you
wouldn't be able to do in real
life."
The system uses home-to
home telephone hook-ups to
add new dimensions to games
such as chess and bridge. By
dialing a certain number, a
player could be hooked by
computer to a game with a
player of equal expertise at any
time.
People to people
"It's not the kind of game
you think about now,"
explained Lucky. 'You're not
playing against a computer."
This game network would dif
fer from others like the so
called home-video "Pong"
game because the system
would work as "a broker to
connect people up to people,
and let people play the
games."
The technology needed for
this is "not a simple thing, but
it can be done," he said. Some
games, like chess and bridge,
could be made available now.
For the more complex
scenarios like "Star Trek' or
war games, Lucky admits that
"the only part we've actually
got working right now is the
background generator."
Currently, an idea similar to

the system described by Lucky
is on trial use in England. To
use this system, called PRE
STEL, a player keys in a "user
number" and is connected
with a computer. The services
offered by PRESTEL include in
formation on news, weather,
sports, gardens-and travel. The
information sought is dis
played on the TV screen.
Average users
While this type of service is
beneficial, Lucky said, "an av
erage telephone user would be
able to take full advantage only
about every five years." The
way to get your money's worth
from the system, he added,
would be through the addition
of games to the news network.
