# Brown prophesies bright stable future
## 
### KEVIN COX 
Gov. Jerry Brown bounced back
and forth between the 19th and 21st
centuries in a speech Friday before
San Francisco's Commonwealth
Club, praising California's heritage
and sharing his "views and visions"
for the future of the state.
For the present, he announced
final approval for construction of the
first Bay Area oil refinery in the last 10
years, saying it was a good example
of the necessary balance between
present economic needs and future
environmental quality.
"It's a happy occasion," Brown
told a roomful of reporters in a news
conference after his speech. "An oil
refinery and environmental quality
go hand in hand for a better Califor
nia.
"It will minimize smog yet utilize a
natural resource . . . it's a very im
portant example of a policy of en
vironmental quality and industrial
growth."
The refinery, being constructed by
UCO Oil Co., will refine 10,000 bar

people of this state. We are pacesetters economically intel

conceptualize/ — Gov. Jerry Brown

rels of crude oil a day, a small con
tribution to the 700,000 barrels that
are refined daily in the Bay Area. But
Brown said the refinery was an im
portant precedent.
Urges look 'to the future'
In his speech before a crowd of
1000, Brown said that California's
leaders should "look not to the past
but to the future," and then took his
only direct shot at Republican chal
lenger Evelle Younger.
"My opponent expressed, almost
wistfully, that he wished he was run
ning for governor 100 years ago,"
Brown said, referring to a comment
Younger made last week. "If I had a
choice, I wish I was running for gov
ernor 100 years from now."
Brown sees a "bright, stable fu
ture" for California.
"There will be problems," he said
of the 21st century, "but I see it as an
opportunity to protect our natural
resources, expand industry and
commerce and for the inclusion of all
the diverse groups that make their
home in this state."
Responds to critics
Turning to critics who have at
tacked his record during the last four
years, Brown cited statistics from
Security Bank, who reported a 6.4
percent increase in housing permits
this year and an 11 percent increase
for corporate profits in 1979. Brown
said that the bank also reported that

there were 500,000 new jobs in
California this year.
"Those who run it (California)
down do a disservice to the people of
this state," said Brown. "We are
pacesetters economically, intellec
tually and culturally — and in every
other aspect that I can concep
tualize."
Brown called California a "real pat
rimony that has drawn people for
1000 years, and even as I speak, to
partake in the bounty of this land.
"They don't face the obstacles that
faced the Donner Party of Juniperro
Serra," Brown said, but all citizens in
California face a "multiplicity of
people, ideas and languages.
"It's not a luxury that we learn to
live with others," he said, "it's an
imperative for national survival.
"We can set a model for larger
problems and for world-wide coop
eration."
Nuclear power not luxury
Living with nuclear power is not
the luxury some people think it is,
Brown said, because of dangerous

radioactive waste products and
comparatively high costs.
"The cost of nuclear power is
higher than oil, coal, geothermal and
conservation," Brown said, adding
that it would cost $6 to produce $I's
worth of existing energy that has
been conserved.
Brown also said that the costs of
disposing of nuclear waste, such as
shooting it into outer space, would
be expensive to present and future
generations.
"If we did that (outer-space dis
posal), we would want to be very
sure that it didn't drop out on the
way," Brown said after expressing his
concerns on the efficacy of another
method of disposal, burial in salt
mines.
"That would also raise the cost as
tronomically," he said. "We must
base our judgments on what makes
economic sense and in regard to the
safety for future generations."
In response to a question, Brown
said he had "a very simple answer" as
to whether or not he is running for
President in 1980.
"Carter is doing very well ... in
fact he is doing extremely well,"
Brown said. "And I think, standing in
the wings, is Teddy Kennedy, re
markably popular among Democrats
and Republicans alike.
"So I'm lowering my expecta
tions."

Turning to critics who have at
tacked his record during the last four
years, Brown cited statistics from
Security Bank, who reported a 6.4
percent increase in housing permits
this year and an 11 percent increase
for corporate profits in 1979. Brown
said that the bank also reported that

there were 500,000 new jobs in
California this year.
"Those who run it (California)
down do a disservice to the people of
this state," said Brown. "We are
pacesetters economically, intellec
tually and culturally — and in every
other aspect that I can concep
tualize."
Brown called California a "real pat
rimony that has drawn people for
1000 years, and even as I speak, to
partake in the bounty of this land.
"They don't face the obstacles that
faced the Donner Party of Juniperro
Serra," Brown said, but all citizens in
California face a "multiplicity of
people, ideas and languages.
"It's not a luxury that we learn to
live with others," he said, "it's an
imperative for national survival.
"We can set a model for larger
problems and for world-wide coop
eration."
Nuclear power not luxury
Living with nuclear power is not
the luxury some people think it is,
Brown said, because of dangerous

radioactive waste products and
comparatively high costs.
"The cost of nuclear power is
higher than oil, coal, geothermal and
conservation," Brown said, adding
that it would cost $6 to produce $I's
worth of existing energy that has
been conserved.
Brown also said that the costs of
disposing of nuclear waste, such as
shooting it into outer space, would
be expensive to present and future
generations.
"If we did that (outer-space dis
posal), we would want to be very
sure that it didn't drop out on the
way," Brown said after expressing his
concerns on the efficacy of another
method of disposal, burial in salt
mines.
"That would also raise the cost as
tronomically," he said. "We must
base our judgments on what makes
economic sense and in regard to the
safety for future generations."
In response to a question, Brown
said he had "a very simple answer" as
to whether or not he is running for
President in 1980.
"Carter is doing very well ... in
fact he is doing extremely well,"
Brown said. "And I think, standing in
the wings, is Teddy Kennedy, re
markably popular among Democrats
and Republicans alike.
"So I'm lowering my expecta
tions."
Gov. Jerry Brown bounced back
and forth between the 19th and 21st
centuries in a speech Friday before
San Francisco's Commonwealth
Club, praising California's heritage
and sharing his "views and visions"
for the future of the state.
For the present, he announced
final approval for construction of the
first Bay Area oil refinery in the last 10
years, saying it was a good example
of the necessary balance between
present economic needs and future
environmental quality.
"It's a happy occasion," Brown
told a roomful of reporters in a news
conference after his speech. "An oil
refinery and environmental quality
go hand in hand for a better Califor
nia.
"It will minimize smog yet utilize a
natural resource . . . it's a very im
portant example of a policy of en
vironmental quality and industrial
growth."

tribution to the 700,000 barrels that
are refined daily in the Bay Area. But
Brown said the refinery was an im

Urges look 'to the future'
In his speech before a crowd of
1000, Brown said that California's
leaders should "look not to the past
but to the future," and then took his
only direct shot at Republican chal
lenger Evelle Younger.
"My opponent expressed, almost
wistfully, that he wished he was run
ning for governor 100 years ago,"
Brown said, referring to a comment
Younger made last week. "If I had a
choice, I wish I was running for gov
ernor 100 years from now."
Brown sees a "bright, stable fu
ture" for California.
"There will be problems," he said
of the 21st century, "but I see it as an
opportunity to protect our natural
resources, expand industry and
commerce and for the inclusion of all
the diverse groups that make their
home in this state."
