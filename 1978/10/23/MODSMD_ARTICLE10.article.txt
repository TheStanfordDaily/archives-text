# Teenager purchases first chocolate Monopoly game
## 
### 
Canoga Park (AP) — When
David Silverman plays
Monopoly and his friends pass
"Go" and collect $200, he has
to watch to see they don't also
take a bite out of Boardwalk.
Boardwalk — and all of the
other 142 pieces of the 13-
year-old's new $600 game —
are edible. Most are chocolate;
the rest are variously colored
bits of the same butter-cream
base used in chocolate bars.
The appetizing version of the
famous game is on Page 1 of
this year's catalog of
Neiman-Marcus, the Texas
based department store
known for advertising unique
— and expensive — gifts.
One exception
The store has the rights to
the tasty version of Monopoly
with one exception: the candy
store in Silverman's neighbor
hood in this Los Angeles sub
urb, where the game is man
ufactured.
And because the games ha
ven't been shipped to
Neiman-Marcus yet for the
several hundred customers
who the store says have al ready
ordered it, David is the first
person to own the dark choco
late board, milk chocolate
deeds, wintergreen houses
and cinnamon hotels.
The precisely molded pieces
— you can even read that rent
on North Carolina Avenue is
$26 — draw crowds to the small
candy store where they're dis
played in a refrigerated case.
'Looked good'
That's where David saw the
game and decided he wanted

it."I just liked it,"the teenager
said Tuesday, as he clutched
three $100 bills and prepared to
make his final payment. "It
looked good and there's detail
in all the cards. I just wanted to
buy it." He made a down
payment of $300, using money
he earned during the summer
by working for his father's
land-surveying business. He
gave the second, and last, in
stallment to the game's
creators, Sandra and Ellen
Katzman, after a quick stop at
the bank several days later.
David said he's not a
Monopoly fanatic and would
have bought a different choco
late game had one existed.
"The first thing he asked when
we came into the store was if
they had a chess set, too," his
mother, Darlene, said.
No better choice
But for Sandra Katzman, who
was looking for an experiment
to test the new chocolate mold
ing technique she and her sis
ter devised, there could be no
better choice than Monopoly.
"I spent the bettter part of

my childhood playing
Monopoly," she smiled. "And
besides, it's still the best selling
toy in the world."
The game has chocolate
money in all the denomina
tions the real set contains and
in the same colors — white but
ter cream ones, pink raspberry
fives, yellow lemon 10s, green
lime 20s, blue pepermint 50s,
gold butterscotch 100 sand
orange orange 500s.
Replicas
The tokens are replicas of
the orginals, including the rac
ing car, thimble, dog and bat
tleship. In fact, everything
about the chocolate game is
remarkably matched to the
game puchased by millions of
people. Only one thing is diffe
rent — and even that depends
on the owner.
In David Silverman's case,
the instructions for a player
stuck with a certain "Chance"
card have one verbal addition
— Go to jail. Co directly to jail.
Do not pass Co. Do not collect
$200. Do not eat Boardwalk.

"I spent the bettter part of

my childhood playing
Monopoly," she smiled. "And
besides, it's still the best selling
toy in the world."
The game has chocolate
money in all the denomina
tions the real set contains and
in the same colors — white but

fives, yellow lemon 10s, green
lime 20s, blue pepermint 50s,
gold butterscotch 100 sand
orange orange 500s.

The tokens are replicas of
the orginals, including the rac
ing car, thimble, dog and bat
tleship. In fact, everything
about the chocolate game is
remarkably matched to the
game puchased by millions of
people. Only one thing is diffe
rent — and even that depends
on the owner.
In David Silverman's case,
the instructions for a player
stuck with a certain "Chance"
card have one verbal addition
— Go to jail. Co directly to jail.
Do not pass Co. Do not collect
$200. Do not eat Boardwalk.
Canoga Park (AP) — When
David Silverman plays
Monopoly and his friends pass
"Go" and collect $200, he has
to watch to see they don't also
take a bite out of Boardwalk.
Boardwalk — and all of the
other 142 pieces of the 13-
year-old's new $600 game —
are edible. Most are chocolate;
the rest are variously colored
bits of the same butter-cream
base used in chocolate bars.
The appetizing version of the
famous game is on Page 1 of
this year's catalog of
Neiman-Marcus, the Texas
based department store
known for advertising unique
— and expensive — gifts.
One exception
The store has the rights to
the tasty version of Monopoly
with one exception: the candy
store in Silverman's neighbor
hood in this Los Angeles sub
urb, where the game is man
ufactured.
And because the games ha
ven't been shipped to
Neiman-Marcus yet for the
several hundred customers
who the store says have al ready
ordered it, David is the first
person to own the dark choco
late board, milk chocolate
deeds, wintergreen houses
and cinnamon hotels.
The precisely molded pieces
— you can even read that rent
on North Carolina Avenue is
$26 — draw crowds to the small
candy store where they're dis
played in a refrigerated case.
'Looked good'
That's where David saw the
game and decided he wanted

it."I just liked it,"the teenager
said Tuesday, as he clutched
three $100 bills and prepared to
make his final payment. "It
looked good and there's detail
in all the cards. I just wanted to
buy it." He made a down
payment of $300, using money
he earned during the summer
by working for his father's
land-surveying business. He
gave the second, and last, in
stallment to the game's
creators, Sandra and Ellen
Katzman, after a quick stop at
the bank several days later.
David said he's not a
Monopoly fanatic and would
have bought a different choco
late game had one existed.
"The first thing he asked when
we came into the store was if
they had a chess set, too," his
mother, Darlene, said.
No better choice
But for Sandra Katzman, who
was looking for an experiment
to test the new chocolate mold
ing technique she and her sis
ter devised, there could be no
better choice than Monopoly.
