## Human rights at stake 
### 
Irrespective of whatever else the current fight
ing in Lebanon means, it most surely involves a
violation of human rights.
The Syrian army's systematic and heavy at
tacks on Maronite quarters in Beirut during the
past month have resulted in mounting casualty
figures. Thousands of private and public build
ings have been destroyed. The city in many
places resembles a desolation trail.
Why has the "peace keeping" Syrian army
embarked in what amounts to a genocide? In
credible as it may be, the Lebanese Maronites
are now used in a ruthless game of Middle East
politics. Syrian President Assad, having in mind
Israeli promises to the Maronites, hopes to pro
voke Israel into a state of beligerence and thus
jeopardise the Sadat peace initiative.
The ploy is well conceived, Israel will lose
credibility if it does not interfere. Conversely,
any moves towards dynamic involvement will
certainly arouse the Arab World and errode
Sadat's position even further.
The happenings in Lebanon today constitute
only a link in a chain of events that have
perplexed the rest of the world. In a country of
2.5 million people more than 50,000 have
perished in three years of everchanging war
alliances.
To understand the situation a brief review of
Lebanese history is in order.
. Following the conclusion of WW I and the
disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, that part
of the world became a British/French protecto
rate. Maronites, Orthodox Christians, Arme
nians, Suny, Shi'a and Druze formed an amal
gam of religious and cultural minorities.
The Maronites, a Roman Catholic sect have
had long links with the West and viewed them
selves different in a sea of often antagonistic
groups.
In 1943, Lebanon's National Pact established a
state that was based on "institutionalized con
fessionalism." The various minorities shared
power via political offices reserved for them. In
essence, though, Lebanon was arbitrarily carved
by the French in order to accommodate the
Maronites' fear of assimilation in the surround
ing sea of Islam.
The Middle East trauma of Israel's creation
touched off the beginning of Lebanese tjoubles.
Because in addition to its own fragile coaltion or

minorities it had to contend with Palestinian re
fugees.
The state of beligerance in the whole area
could not but have profound effects on the
country. In 1970, the following important events
occurred in Lebanese history:
1. Nasser died and the Arab World was dep
rived of a charismatic leader that could maintain
discipline in the ranks.
2. Houseein attacked the Palestinians in Jor
dan. Hundreds of thousands became refugees
for the second time and found a new home in
Lebanon.
3. Assad ascended to power in Syria. Strong
and ambitious he wanted to replace Nasser in
the role of Arab leadership.
The 1969 "Cairo agreement" allowed the
Palestinians freedom of movement in Lebanon.
Their power in the country increased dramati
cally following the 1970 Jordan debacle. This
would unavoidably lead Â»o a conflict with the
Maronites.
Tension buildup led to the 1975 Civil War.
After two bloody years, Syria intervened as a
"peace keeper." It has remained there since. At
first it was the Palestinians that felt the Syrian
might. The Arab World was stunned to see the
Syrians, a leftist state, attack the Palestinians.
Putting a lid on the civil war was not Syria's only
aim. Its army consolidated a foothold and thus
realized defacto the idea of "greater Syria." The
Maronites, original beneficiaries of Syria's in
tervention could not be more unhappy.
This year's Israeli attack against the Palesti
nians in Southern Lebanon brought a jubilant
reponse from the Maronites. It did not sit well
with the Syrians. Fighting erupted soon thereaf
ter.
The war in Lebanon is savage. The opponents
are not equal in strength and the Syrian army's
actions amount to a blatant massacre. It is in
violation of all laws of humanity.
Many people, this writer included, who have
supported the Palestinian cause and have been
sympathetic to the Arab side in the Middle East,
found it difficult to condemn Syria. This cannot
continue because above all, the "right to life" is
tantamount, and that is in danger in Lebanon
today.
