Red feathers
support campaign
I am appalled by the number
of persons wearing red feath
ers in their hats at this year's
football games. These feathers
are not simply token reminders
of the Rose Bowl years when
our teams were known as the
Stanford Indians. They are
provided by a group of alumni
and friends who are actively
campaigning to have the In
dians returned as mascots.
Each person should realize that
by wearing a feather he/she is
supporting that campaign.
Do we want to bring back the
Indians? I think not. The very
idea that a minority group
should be the University's
mascot is absurd. Would the
Stanford Blacks or the Stanford
Chicanos be appropriate? Cer
tainly not; nor are the Indians
an appropriate mascot. An in
telligent community should
know as much.
Furthermore, native Ameri
cans have clearly and re
peatedly stated that they refuse
to be our mascot. This is why
the University originally dis
continued the use of the Indian
as a mascot. Wearing a red
feather shows no respect for
native Americans or their deci
sion not to be our mascots.
I hope that every person will
bear this in mind the next time
he/she is offered a feather. Tak
ing pride in Stanford athletic
tradition and supporting an
ill-considered campaign are
very different matters. Refuse
the feather.

No humor in
group stereotype
When is humor both funny
and tasteful? Jon Reider (Daily,
Oct. 11) agrees that humor
which insults Poles, blacks and
women is in bad taste because,
he says, they couldn't choose
membership in their respec
tive groups. But he sees no
thing distasteful in ridiculing
members of voluntary groups.
Under his rule we could
ridicule naturalized citizens,
but not the native born; we
could demean converts to
Christianity, but not Christians
baptized at birth.
Let's try another rule. Dis
tasteful humor presupposes
that all members of a group
share identical negative traits.
We all want to be judged on the
basis of our own behavior, not
the stereotyped view of any re
ference group to which we may
belong. The Juricich cartoons
were distasteful simply be
cuase they implied that all P.E.

majors were incompetent.
Some might be. Some physi
cians might be, too. But let's
not condemn all in the same
breath.
Ridicule is an effective way to
puncture pompous perfor
mance. But let's make fun of
absurd behavior, not member
ship in any group, voluntary or
not.

Band's purpose
to 'Get Happy'
Ben Pollock's article about
the LSJUMB (Oct. 16) com
pletely missed the point. Al
though he successfully man
aged to rebut his previous ar
ticle about the band — an even
grosser collection of errors —
he also succeeded in over
analyzing and intellectualizing
the LSJUMB, saying that "the
band's innovation must be
maintained until students snap
out of their middle-class values
once again and resume their
rightful role of improving the
world while ignoring
materialistic tendencies."
Wrong, Ben. The band's
purpose is nowhere near that
complex. In fact, its meaning
can be summed up in two sim
ple words: "Get Happy." That's
all there is to it. And the band
"gets happy" by being outrage
ous and by playing music that
excites the band and the band's
audiences. It's so simple that
you overlooked it.
As for the band being "the
last stronghold of the '605," the
LSJUMB is not the "last" any
thing. That used to be true. But
no longer. And it needn't be
bound by that tradition, or by
any other. Rather, it is the first
in whatever it is doing. Hence
the title "The Incomparables."

Libertarian views
misrepresented
Jerry Lampton's discussion
of libertarianism (Daily, Oct.
16) is a gross distortion and
misrepresentation of the liber
tarian position.
No libertarian would "assert
that the slaves entered freely
into relationships with their
masters" or accept Lampton's
statement that the abolition of
slavery constituted "an obvi
ous restriction on personal lib
erty." To suggest that liber
tarianism advocates a return to
the 18th or 19th centuries bet
rays a woeful ignorance of the
history of those periods.
Nor do libertarians believe in

the chimera of "perfect com
petition": many libertarians
have emphasized the absurdity
and impossibility of this con
cept.
It is not "libertarian doc
trine" but the existing
economy of privilege, the sys
tem of corporate liberalism,
which is "a mask behind which
strong economic interests . . .
hide while exploiting the
weak."
Had Lampton bothered to
read any competent libertarian
writer (such as Murray
Rothbard, John Hospers, or
Ayn Rand) instead of the con
fused liberal John Stuart Mill,
he might realize that it is not
libertarians but he himself who
possesses a vague and incohe

Red feathers
support campaign
I am appalled by the number
of persons wearing red feath
ers in their hats at this year's
football games. These feathers
are not simply token reminders
of the Rose Bowl years when
our teams were known as the
Stanford Indians. They are
provided by a group of alumni
and friends who are actively
campaigning to have the In
dians returned as mascots.
Each person should realize that
by wearing a feather he/she is
supporting that campaign.
Do we want to bring back the
Indians? I think not. The very
idea that a minority group
should be the University's
mascot is absurd. Would the
Stanford Blacks or the Stanford
Chicanos be appropriate? Cer
tainly not; nor are the Indians
an appropriate mascot. An in
telligent community should
know as much.
Furthermore, native Ameri
cans have clearly and re
peatedly stated that they refuse
to be our mascot. This is why
the University originally dis
continued the use of the Indian
as a mascot. Wearing a red
feather shows no respect for
native Americans or their deci
sion not to be our mascots.
I hope that every person will
bear this in mind the next time
he/she is offered a feather. Tak
ing pride in Stanford athletic
tradition and supporting an
ill-considered campaign are
very different matters. Refuse
the feather.

No humor in
group stereotype
When is humor both funny
and tasteful? Jon Reider (Daily,
Oct. 11) agrees that humor
which insults Poles, blacks and
women is in bad taste because,
he says, they couldn't choose
membership in their respec
tive groups. But he sees no
thing distasteful in ridiculing
members of voluntary groups.
Under his rule we could
ridicule naturalized citizens,
but not the native born; we
could demean converts to
Christianity, but not Christians
baptized at birth.
Let's try another rule. Dis
tasteful humor presupposes
that all members of a group
share identical negative traits.
We all want to be judged on the
basis of our own behavior, not
the stereotyped view of any re
ference group to which we may
belong. The Juricich cartoons
were distasteful simply be
cuase they implied that all P.E.

majors were incompetent.
Some might be. Some physi
cians might be, too. But let's
not condemn all in the same
breath.
Ridicule is an effective way to
puncture pompous perfor
mance. But let's make fun of
absurd behavior, not member
ship in any group, voluntary or
not.

Band's purpose
to 'Get Happy'
Ben Pollock's article about
the LSJUMB (Oct. 16) com
pletely missed the point. Al
though he successfully man
aged to rebut his previous ar
ticle about the band — an even
grosser collection of errors —
he also succeeded in over
analyzing and intellectualizing
the LSJUMB, saying that "the
band's innovation must be
maintained until students snap
out of their middle-class values
once again and resume their
rightful role of improving the
world while ignoring
materialistic tendencies."
Wrong, Ben. The band's
purpose is nowhere near that
complex. In fact, its meaning
can be summed up in two sim
ple words: "Get Happy." That's
all there is to it. And the band
"gets happy" by being outrage
ous and by playing music that
excites the band and the band's
audiences. It's so simple that
you overlooked it.
As for the band being "the
last stronghold of the '605," the
LSJUMB is not the "last" any
thing. That used to be true. But
no longer. And it needn't be
bound by that tradition, or by
any other. Rather, it is the first
in whatever it is doing. Hence
the title "The Incomparables."

Libertarian views
misrepresented
Jerry Lampton's discussion
of libertarianism (Daily, Oct.
16) is a gross distortion and
misrepresentation of the liber
tarian position.
No libertarian would "assert
that the slaves entered freely
into relationships with their
masters" or accept Lampton's
statement that the abolition of
slavery constituted "an obvi
ous restriction on personal lib
erty." To suggest that liber
tarianism advocates a return to
the 18th or 19th centuries bet
rays a woeful ignorance of the
history of those periods.
Nor do libertarians believe in

the chimera of "perfect com
petition": many libertarians
have emphasized the absurdity
and impossibility of this con
cept.
It is not "libertarian doc
trine" but the existing
economy of privilege, the sys
tem of corporate liberalism,
which is "a mask behind which
strong economic interests . . .
hide while exploiting the
weak."
Had Lampton bothered to
read any competent libertarian
writer (such as Murray
Rothbard, John Hospers, or
Ayn Rand) instead of the con
fused liberal John Stuart Mill,
he might realize that it is not
libertarians but he himself who
possesses a vague and incohe
rent concept of human liberty.

Red feathers
support campaign
I am appalled by the number
of persons wearing red feath
ers in their hats at this year's
football games. These feathers
are not simply token reminders
of the Rose Bowl years when
our teams were known as the
Stanford Indians. They are
provided by a group of alumni
and friends who are actively
campaigning to have the In
dians returned as mascots.
Each person should realize that
by wearing a feather he/she is
supporting that campaign.
Do we want to bring back the
Indians? I think not. The very
idea that a minority group
should be the University's
mascot is absurd. Would the
Stanford Blacks or the Stanford
Chicanos be appropriate? Cer
tainly not; nor are the Indians
an appropriate mascot. An in
telligent community should
know as much.
Furthermore, native Ameri
cans have clearly and re
peatedly stated that they refuse
to be our mascot. This is why
the University originally dis
continued the use of the Indian
as a mascot. Wearing a red
feather shows no respect for
native Americans or their deci
sion not to be our mascots.
I hope that every person will
bear this in mind the next time
he/she is offered a feather. Tak
ing pride in Stanford athletic
tradition and supporting an
ill-considered campaign are
very different matters. Refuse
the feather.

No humor in
group stereotype
When is humor both funny
and tasteful? Jon Reider (Daily,
Oct. 11) agrees that humor
which insults Poles, blacks and
women is in bad taste because,
he says, they couldn't choose
membership in their respec
tive groups. But he sees no
thing distasteful in ridiculing
members of voluntary groups.
Under his rule we could
ridicule naturalized citizens,
but not the native born; we
could demean converts to
Christianity, but not Christians
baptized at birth.
Let's try another rule. Dis
tasteful humor presupposes
that all members of a group
share identical negative traits.
We all want to be judged on the
basis of our own behavior, not
the stereotyped view of any re
ference group to which we may
belong. The Juricich cartoons
were distasteful simply be
cuase they implied that all P.E.

majors were incompetent.
Some might be. Some physi
cians might be, too. But let's
not condemn all in the same
breath.
Ridicule is an effective way to
puncture pompous perfor
mance. But let's make fun of
absurd behavior, not member
ship in any group, voluntary or
not.

Band's purpose
to 'Get Happy'
Ben Pollock's article about
the LSJUMB (Oct. 16) com
pletely missed the point. Al
though he successfully man
aged to rebut his previous ar
ticle about the band — an even
grosser collection of errors —
he also succeeded in over
analyzing and intellectualizing
the LSJUMB, saying that "the
band's innovation must be
maintained until students snap
out of their middle-class values
once again and resume their
rightful role of improving the
world while ignoring
materialistic tendencies."
Wrong, Ben. The band's
purpose is nowhere near that
complex. In fact, its meaning
can be summed up in two sim
ple words: "Get Happy." That's
all there is to it. And the band
"gets happy" by being outrage
ous and by playing music that
excites the band and the band's
audiences. It's so simple that
you overlooked it.
As for the band being "the
last stronghold of the '605," the
LSJUMB is not the "last" any
thing. That used to be true. But
no longer. And it needn't be
bound by that tradition, or by
any other. Rather, it is the first
in whatever it is doing. Hence
the title "The Incomparables."
