## Meeting human needs 
### 
These days there appears to be so many
crises in the world around us that it doesn't
seem worthwhile getting up in the morning.
There's the food crisis, environmental crisis,
energy and resources, inflation, unemploy
ment, population growth, arms proliferation,
and so on. But a lot of people don't realize that
the origin, effects, and solution of these prob
lems are closely related.
As the population continues to grow, there
is a greater demand for more food, prices rise,
and this requires a greater input of energy and
resources, which in turn further taxes the en
vironment. Similarly, a growth in population
with an inadequate supply of food can only
result in increased suffering and starvation,
followed by a retaliation in the form of military
hostility, that further depletes energy and re
sources, burdens the environment, hurts the
economy, and so on.
The American system traditionally has sol
ved the problem of survival and human needs
through the use of more technology.
Technology in the future must be guided to
proper ends, so we don't keep multiplying the
problems we already have. Believe it or not,
our planet only has a limited ability to recycle
— a fact modern industry seems incapable of
recognizing.
Too many of us think conservation can't
solve our problems. Conservation doesn't
imply a lesser standard of living for Ameri
cans; it merely insists that Americans waste
less and use energy more efficiently. This
means we should take advantage of insula
tion, weatherstripping, and home energy
conservation techniques. We should pool re
sources — travel to work, share a garden,
waste less food, bicycle, and recycle paper,
metals, bottles, clothes, and organic matter.
What critics don't seem to realize is that a
major part of the "crisis" is higher prices,
lowered employment, cost of environmental
damage, extreme safety and health hazards,
and distribution losses.
It's simply not true that alternative energy
sources are more expensive, technologically
immature, and cannot provide more than a
fraction of energy needs. The constraints of
alternative energy sources are not technical
but social and political.

The government distributes $IVi billion a
year for nuclear energy with very little to show
for it. Last year 3 percent of our electricity
was produced by nuclear energy. But it took
three percent of our country's total electricity
to produce this nuclear energy. This nets us
only one-half of a percent gain in electrical
energy investment, in the process of mining,
refining, and distributing this same energy
from nuclear fuels. At the same time we sub
sidize all other high technology energy
sources we don't provide the relatively small
amount of capital needed to begin introduc
ing on a large scale safer, cleaner energy
sources. These energy sources are available in
virtually unlimited quantities and are renewa
ble: sunlight, wind, forestry and animal
wastes.
Conservation and alternative energy
sources can solve many of our problems at
once. They can lower energy bills, provide
fast payback on the investment, use less capi
tal, provide more employment, require less
training, and give us energy independence.
They can also improve our balance of trade,
provide an unlimited supply of clean future
energy and reduce environemntal and health
damage. They are terrorist-resistant and much
safer from accidents. Finally there are fewer
problems in waste disposal and cleaner
sources of energy are much more appropriate
ethically and financially to sell to other
countries.
Supportive action must begin now so that
new energy systems like solar are properly in
place when oil reserves are finally depleted.
Severe economic disruptions will occur if na
tions do not begin early enough to start build
ing the sustainable energy systems needed
that will replace our fossil fuels. Energy con
servation can help lengthen the time we can
use remaining high-quality fossil fuels as an
interim measure to prepare for the inevitable
transition to more renewable energy sources.
We've no time to lose, the quality and security
of our survival rests on our ability now to
organize and plan public programs that will
effectively mobilize society and ease us
through the difficult transition in the future.
