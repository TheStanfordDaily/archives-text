## In defense of libertarianism 
### 
It would be relatively easy to label Jerry
Lampton's article criticizing libertarianism
(Daily, Oct. 16) as the product of over
zealous liberalism, communist de
magoguery or some other such polemic. I
refrain from doing so with the intent of
edifying the University community as to
the basic weaknesses in Lampton's posi
tion.
Lampton criticizes libertarianism as
being a simplistic philosophy very much in
vogue among Americans who feel the
need to rebel against what Lampton terms
"the often arbitrary authority of govern
ment in all spheres of life." Lampton goes
further in saying "these (libertarian)
ideologues propose the application to
modern American society of a doctrine
whose results would be precisely the op
posite of the stated objectives of the be
lievers in libertarianism."
First, allow me to state the basic tenet of
libertarianism (one that even Lampton
does not fully comprehend or appreciate).
Simply stated, libertarians believe in the
right of all people to do as they please as
long as they do not forcibly interfere with
the rights of others.
Lampton praises the lofty idealism of
this philosophy but goes on to say that the
real life application of libertarianism "will
not liberate the vast majority of men, but
will enslave them." Ensalve them to what?
Lampton seems to think the answer is self
evident, and goes on to argue that the
application of libertarian ideals to the real
world would be impractical.
Lampton does this by bringing up the
question of the difference between a pri
vate act and a public act "bound to inter
fere with the freedom of others," appa
rently making a distinction between pri
vate and public acts. Libertarians do not
recognize this distinction. Any act carried
out by an individual is a private act irres
pective of the potential consequences of
that act. I will further state that it is also
every individual's right toreacf to an action
by some other individual in defense of his
or her rights. If said person does not
choose to react forany number of reasons,
can the original person be accused of un

fairly infringing on the rights of the sec
ond?
To illustrate the point, I will refer to
Lampton's example of the California
smoking initiative (currently on the state
ballot). Lampton's feeling that the liberta
rian stand against the initiative is con
tradictory, and the resulting application
impractical, reflects his ignoring of the fact
that it is every non-smoker's right to ask
the smoker not to smoke. It is the "vic
tim's" right to defend him or herself from
another's infringement on his or her
rights. Consequently, it is not the gov
ernment's responsibility to come along
and hold the non-smokers hand and order
the smoker to be segregated, restricted
and other-wise prevented from exercising
his or her right to act freely.

Simply stated, libertarians be
lieve in the right of all people to
do as they please as long as they
do not forcibly interfere with
others.

Lampton goes on to show the effects of a
libertarian philosophy on the economy.
He states: "Government regulation may
indeed restrict competition in some cases,
but to remove it would merely replace the
power of public bureaucracy with the un
restrained power of the private sector."
This is exactly what libertarians desire.
Take power away from the government
and return it to the individual, to whom it
rightfully belongs, and who knows best
how to use it.
This policy might not be politically safe
in the short run for legislators and high
officials with certain constituencies, but in
the long run all would benefit from the
self-adjustments of the free market sys
tem. There would be a greater emphasis
on quality and performance (with no sub
sidies for inefficient producers such as
Lockheed and the railroads), combined

with lower prices (a turn to less expensive
production methods as deregulation is
applied) and lower unemployment (with
the removal of minimum wage laws and
welfare programs), as well as the realiza
tion of a minimal rate of inflation, due to
the elmination of deficit spending and a
combination of the above factors.
Lampton feels that all this would result
in a situation where the libertarian doc
trine would be "a mask behind which
strong economic interests such as the cor
porations and labor unions would hide
while exploiting the weak."
What Lampton fails to realize is that this
is exactly what is going on now except for
two things: the two groups are exploiting
each other and the "mask" is illusory lib
eral egalitarianism and concrete subsidiz
ing and support of various such groups by
the very same regulatory government
Lampton defends.
Lampton concludes his argument by cal
ling for society to "strip away the veil of
ideology from political issues and ask the
question: who benefits and who loses in
this case? Who should benefit and who
should lose?" I will conclude by saying
that the call for this sort of questioning is a
call for the surrender of all freedoms, indi
viduality and liberty to some great arbiter
that shall decide for us all who shall lose
and who shall gain from any particular ac
tion, and further determine how much
should be gained or lost. I do not believe
that even Lampton would willingly subject
his powers of reason and judgment to
some magical force highly reminiscent of
Ceorge Orwell's Big Brother. To do so
would be to surrender one's control over
one's own life and, in a sense, life itself.
Libertarians propose this: Let every man
and woman live their own life. Let them
stand on their own two feet. If they fall,
help them as you see fit; but don't try to
force others to help if they have no wish to
and don't try to impose your will on
another and then deny his or her right to
defend himself. What could be more sim
ple or more practical?
