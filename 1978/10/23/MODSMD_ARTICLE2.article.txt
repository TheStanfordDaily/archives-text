# Morris comments on priorities

### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
"If you went through my list of priorities and the
things I believe in, you would find that some sound very
conservative and some sound very liberal and that s
because I don't believe you can be an ideologue and be a
very effective public servant," Greg Morris, Republican
candidate for the state assembly in this district, said in an
interview with the Daily last week.
Morris is running against incumbent Democrat Victor
Calvo for thr; state assembly seat in the 21st district.
Morris practiced law until April when he became a full
time candidate for office. He is a city councilman in
Sunnyvale and holds a variety of other positions in the
county.
Morris outlined the reasons for his party affiliation,
but stressed that he doesn't want people to vote for him
because of it."I want people to vote for me (not the
Republican party)," Morris said.
"My notion of what a Republican is is a little different
from what most Republicans think it is. ... I think the
Democratic party is the party of people. It seeks broad
government intervention and people-oriented solu
tions.
'Party of the individual'
"I think the Republican party is the party ot the indi
vidual. And should be the party which seeks to promote
individual accomplishment and competition, but as a
necessary first step believes that we ought to eliminate
any kind of discrimination so that we all get to the first
rung of the ladder equal. Whether or not we all get to the
top is a matter for us to decide individually.
"But everyone needs to get to the first rung. That's
why I'm sure a strong proponent of the Equal Rights
Amendment, and affirmative action; because I believe
the American dream works, but not until everybody gets
a shot to get into it," Morris explained.

Morris called Proposition 6 "an attempt to legislate
prejudice" which needs to be defeated. "It doesn't
make any difference that it's gay people that this (prop
osition) is aimed at. It could be any lifestyle choice."
Besides Proposition 6, Morris said the other moral
issue is an attempt "to stuff politics into the judicial
system." Morris was referring to the campaign to re
move Chief lustice Rose Bird from the California Sup
reme Court. Morris asked rhetorically, "Do we remove
judges merely because they were appointed by a gover
nor we don't like?"
Judicial screenings
He stressed that the screening for judgeships should
be done by a competent panel and in this way the com
petency of judges can be maintained.
He indicated he felt that the machinery already exists
to take care of incompetent judges who are sitting on the
bench.
Morris said, "We have bagged bad judges in this
state."
"The attempts to remove Rose Bird are based on a lot
of fallacious information . . . and also just blunt attacks
on her political philosophy," he added.
Morris said the process by which judges are currently
subject to confirmation by voters could be changed
through legislative action.
The answer to the state's housing shortage, according
to Morris, is to build more appropriate housing. "It
doesn't do any good to build single-bedroom apart
ments," he said. He suggested the possibility of mixing
light-industrial or commercial areas with residential
areas, an arrangement he claimed will bring down the
cost of housing.
Zoning affects housing shortage
He added that certain zoning laws have created an
economic incentive to build fewer than the maximum
