# Dils' arm a cannon as Cards blow out WSU
## snorts 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Pullman, Wash. — In the
Pacific-10 version of the arms
race, Stanford displayed the
more potent arsenal as Cardi
nal field general Steve Dils led
his team to a 43-27 victory over
Washington State Saturday.
Completing 32 of 51 passes
for five touchdowns and a
Pac-10 record 430 yards, Dils
overshadowed Cougar QB Jack
Thompson who threw for a
"meager" 274 yards and two
TDs while completing 24 of 34
passes.
"We were watching the local
TV and their coaching staff was
on and indicated that they had
the best offense in collegiate
football," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. He added poin
tedly, "We took their word for
it."
Both offenses were awe
some, but Stanford's was bet
ter. The 27,481 fans at Martin
Stadium saw the track meet
many observers had predicted.
The two teams combined for
1133 yards of total offense —

the Cards exploding for 607
yards and the Cougars storm
ing back with 526.
"Their offense is just better
than our defense," WSU coach
Jim Walden said.
"I didn't think there was any
way we could lose today," Dils
said, "we were so pissed off all
week." What irritated the
Cards was their 34-31 giveaway
to Washington last week fol
lowing a similarly charitable ef
fort at UCLA, where Stanford
handed the Bruins a 27-26 gift.
The Cards are now 1-2 in the
conference and 4-3 overall.
The Cougars fell to a 1-2 league
mark and a 3-2-1 seasonal tally.
Despite Dils' prolific air as
sault, Stanford had originally
planned to keep the ball on the
ground most of the day.
"We felt going into the game
that we would run outside a lot
because teams have blitzed us
quite a bit the last two weeks,"
Walsh said. "Their defense was
playing with a man under and it
made the sweep work effec
tively."

So effectively that with
third-and-goal from the WSU
19 and the Cards ahead 14-7,
Dils gave to running back Dar
rin Nelson on a sweep left. The
sophomore halfback cut be
hind a Paul Hibler block and
raced to the end zone with his
second TD of the game.
"Darrin sets the block up for
me," Hibler said. "I just have to
hit whoever's out front and
Darrin cuts behind me."
Hibler and the rest of the of
fensive line also provided Dils
with an extraordinary amount
of time throughout the game.
"I had all sorts of time," Dils
said, "our offensive line is the
best anywhere."
In an equally modest as
sessment, Hibler said, "We
pretty much humiliated their
front line."
Washington State used a lot
of three-man rush to compen
sate for what Walden termed a
"green defense, especially in
the secondary."
Dils did not waste time be
fore exploiting the porous

WSU pass defense. After his
first pass was dropped by Nel
son, Dils completed four in a
row, the last one a 23-yard TD
pass to Nelson.
Thompson brought the
Cougars right back with a 94-
yard scoring drive, the longest
drive against the Cards this
year.
Stanford responded with an
80-yard drive capped by a 29-
yard pass from Dils to wide re
ceiver Ken Margerum.
"It was the same post-corner
pattern I scored on last week,"
Margerum said. "I got the guy
to bite on my move and Steve's
pass was perfect. I think five of
my six touchdowns have come
on that pattern."
Margerum caught six passes
for 99 yards and was wide open
every time Dils went to him,
despite a healthy dose of dou
ble coverage.
"There were huge holes over
the middle," Margerum said of
the Cougar pass defense. "We
just kept testing them there
and it stayed open. I don't un

derstand why they had their
two corners rolled up like that.
I guess it was to try and stop the
passes to our backs."
In the second quarter the
Cards opened a 20-point lead
on the 19-yard run by Nelson
and a 33-yard pass from Dils to
flanker Andre Tyler. Although
WSU scored a touchdown just
before the half, Stanford ex
panded its lead to 26 points,
40-14, in the third quarter on an
18-yard double reverse pass
from Dils to tight end Pat Bowe
and a 22-yard TD catch by Nel
son. •
Thompson engineered two
more Washington State
touchdown drives, but the
Cougars lost three fumbles in
the last 20 minutes to extin
guish any chance of a com
eback.
The fourth quarter served
primarily for Dils to etch his
name in the conference record
book (see accompanying
story).
Almost obscured by the
two-man aerial war were
standout efforts by WSU run
ning backs Ray Williams and
Tali Ena and Stanford backfield
mates Nelson and Phil Francis.
Williams ran for 93 yards and
two TDs and caught four pas
ses while Ena gained 88 yards
on the ground and 92 yards on
nine receptions.
Nelson ran for 95 yards on 15
carries and snagged six passes
for 91 yards. He scored three
times — once on the ground
and twice on receptions. And
early in the second quarter he
became Stanford's career rush
ing leader, breaking Ray Hand
ley's mark of 1768 yards. In his
first season and a half, Nelson
has carried the ball 284 times
for 1794 yards and a 6.3 yard
average.
Francis, the top receiver in
the Pac-10 and No. 3 in the na
tion going into the game,
caught eight passes for 62 yards
and ran for 61 more.
The sterling play of the of
fense notwithstanding, Stan
ford had troubles Saturday.
Last week Washington
blocked two Stanford punts.
The Cards avoided the prob
lem most of Saturday by not
punting. Converting on 16 of
23 third-downs, including the
first 12, Stanford begged the
issue until midway through the
fourth period. Then WSU
safety Mike Snow blocked Ken
Naber's punt — his first of the
day — and the Cougars reco
vered on the 5, converting the
error into six points on the next
play.
"There was no excuse for
that," Walsh said, "we worked
on it all week in practice. We
tightened our line splits and
they were smart and sent a man
in from the outside who
blocked it."
The Cards were also hurt by
four holding calls on center
John Macauley, three of them
when Stanford had the ball in
side the 5 and one of them nul
lifying a TD.
"They (the officials) called
the same thing, from the same
position, on the same play,
three times," Walsh said. "It
will be interesting to see the
films."
"I truthfully don't believe I

was holding on those plays,"
Macauley said. "But it's really a
subjective thing and once they
called it they started looking
out for me."
Hibler said the calls came
when Macauley used an ex
tended arm while blocking, a
technique within the rules.
Unlike the past two weeks,

however, Stanford played so
well that the annoying mis
takes did not change the out
come.
"I'll wake up happy tomor
row and I'll wake up happy
Monday," Dils said. "It'll be
nice because I certainly didn't
wake up happy after last
week's game."

safety Mike Snow blocked Ken
Naber's punt — his first of the

play.
"There was no excuse for
that," Walsh said, "we worked
on it all week in practice. We
tightened our line splits and
they were smart and sent a man
in from the outside who
blocked it."
The Cards were also hurt by
four holding calls on center
John Macauley, three of them
when Stanford had the ball in
side the 5 and one of them nul
lifying a TD.
"They (the officials) called
the same thing, from the same
position, on the same play,
three times," Walsh said. "It
will be interesting to see the

"I truthfully don't believe I

was holding on those plays,"
Macauley said. "But it's really a
subjective thing and once they
called it they started looking
out for me."
Hibler said the calls came
when Macauley used an ex

Unlike the past two weeks,

however, Stanford played so
well that the annoying mis

Darrin Nelson is the new all-time career rushing record holder for the
Cards following his 95-yard performance against the Washington
State Cougars Saturday. Nelson now has a total of 1794 yards in 18
games. Here he eludes defenders in the Washington game two weeks
ago.
Pullman, Wash. — In the
Pacific-10 version of the arms
race, Stanford displayed the
more potent arsenal as Cardi
nal field general Steve Dils led
his team to a 43-27 victory over
Washington State Saturday.
Completing 32 of 51 passes
for five touchdowns and a
Pac-10 record 430 yards, Dils
overshadowed Cougar QB Jack
Thompson who threw for a
"meager" 274 yards and two
TDs while completing 24 of 34
passes.
"We were watching the local
TV and their coaching staff was
on and indicated that they had
the best offense in collegiate
football," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. He added poin
tedly, "We took their word for
it."
Both offenses were awe
some, but Stanford's was bet
ter. The 27,481 fans at Martin
Stadium saw the track meet
many observers had predicted.
The two teams combined for
1133 yards of total offense —

the Cards exploding for 607
yards and the Cougars storm
ing back with 526.
"Their offense is just better
than our defense," WSU coach
Jim Walden said.
"I didn't think there was any
way we could lose today," Dils
said, "we were so pissed off all
week." What irritated the
Cards was their 34-31 giveaway
to Washington last week fol
lowing a similarly charitable ef
fort at UCLA, where Stanford
handed the Bruins a 27-26 gift.
The Cards are now 1-2 in the
conference and 4-3 overall.
The Cougars fell to a 1-2 league
mark and a 3-2-1 seasonal tally.
Despite Dils' prolific air as
sault, Stanford had originally
planned to keep the ball on the
ground most of the day.
"We felt going into the game
that we would run outside a lot
because teams have blitzed us
quite a bit the last two weeks,"
Walsh said. "Their defense was
playing with a man under and it
made the sweep work effec
tively."

So effectively that with
third-and-goal from the WSU
19 and the Cards ahead 14-7,
Dils gave to running back Dar
rin Nelson on a sweep left. The
sophomore halfback cut be
hind a Paul Hibler block and
raced to the end zone with his
second TD of the game.
"Darrin sets the block up for
me," Hibler said. "I just have to
hit whoever's out front and
Darrin cuts behind me."
Hibler and the rest of the of
fensive line also provided Dils
with an extraordinary amount
of time throughout the game.
"I had all sorts of time," Dils
said, "our offensive line is the
best anywhere."
In an equally modest as
sessment, Hibler said, "We
pretty much humiliated their
front line."
Washington State used a lot
of three-man rush to compen
sate for what Walden termed a
"green defense, especially in
the secondary."
Dils did not waste time be
fore exploiting the porous

WSU pass defense. After his
first pass was dropped by Nel
son, Dils completed four in a
row, the last one a 23-yard TD
pass to Nelson.
Thompson brought the
Cougars right back with a 94-
yard scoring drive, the longest
drive against the Cards this
year.
Stanford responded with an
80-yard drive capped by a 29-
yard pass from Dils to wide re
ceiver Ken Margerum.
"It was the same post-corner
pattern I scored on last week,"
Margerum said. "I got the guy
to bite on my move and Steve's
pass was perfect. I think five of
my six touchdowns have come
on that pattern."
Margerum caught six passes
for 99 yards and was wide open
every time Dils went to him,
despite a healthy dose of dou
ble coverage.
"There were huge holes over
the middle," Margerum said of
the Cougar pass defense. "We
just kept testing them there
and it stayed open. I don't un

derstand why they had their
two corners rolled up like that.
I guess it was to try and stop the
passes to our backs."
In the second quarter the
Cards opened a 20-point lead
on the 19-yard run by Nelson
and a 33-yard pass from Dils to
flanker Andre Tyler. Although
WSU scored a touchdown just
before the half, Stanford ex
panded its lead to 26 points,
40-14, in the third quarter on an
18-yard double reverse pass
from Dils to tight end Pat Bowe
and a 22-yard TD catch by Nel
son. •
Thompson engineered two
more Washington State
touchdown drives, but the
Cougars lost three fumbles in
the last 20 minutes to extin
guish any chance of a com
eback.
The fourth quarter served
primarily for Dils to etch his
name in the conference record
book (see accompanying
story).
Almost obscured by the
two-man aerial war were
standout efforts by WSU run
ning backs Ray Williams and
Tali Ena and Stanford backfield
mates Nelson and Phil Francis.
Williams ran for 93 yards and
two TDs and caught four pas
ses while Ena gained 88 yards
on the ground and 92 yards on
nine receptions.
Nelson ran for 95 yards on 15
carries and snagged six passes
for 91 yards. He scored three
times — once on the ground
and twice on receptions. And
early in the second quarter he
became Stanford's career rush
ing leader, breaking Ray Hand
ley's mark of 1768 yards. In his
first season and a half, Nelson
has carried the ball 284 times
for 1794 yards and a 6.3 yard
average.
Francis, the top receiver in
the Pac-10 and No. 3 in the na
tion going into the game,
caught eight passes for 62 yards
and ran for 61 more.
The sterling play of the of
fense notwithstanding, Stan
ford had troubles Saturday.
Last week Washington
blocked two Stanford punts.
The Cards avoided the prob
lem most of Saturday by not
punting. Converting on 16 of
23 third-downs, including the

blocked it."
The Cards were also hurt by
four holding calls on center
John Macauley, three of them
when Stanford had the ball in
side the 5 and one of them nul
lifying a TD.

the same thing, from the same

three times," Walsh said. "It

Macauley said. "But it's really a
subjective thing and once they
called it they started looking
out for me."
Hibler said the calls came
when Macauley used an ex

Unlike the past two weeks,

however, Stanford played so
well that the annoying mis
takes did not change the out

"I'll wake up happy tomor

Darrin Nelson is the new all-time career rushing record holder for the
Cards following his 95-yard performance against the Washington
State Cougars Saturday. Nelson now has a total of 1794 yards in 18
games. Here he eludes defenders in the Washington game two weeks
ago.
Pullman, Wash. — In the
Pacific-10 version of the arms
race, Stanford displayed the
more potent arsenal as Cardi
nal field general Steve Dils led
his team to a 43-27 victory over
Washington State Saturday.
Completing 32 of 51 passes
for five touchdowns and a
Pac-10 record 430 yards, Dils
overshadowed Cougar QB Jack
Thompson who threw for a
"meager" 274 yards and two
TDs while completing 24 of 34
passes.
"We were watching the local
TV and their coaching staff was
on and indicated that they had
the best offense in collegiate
football," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. He added poin
tedly, "We took their word for
it."
Both offenses were awe
some, but Stanford's was bet
ter. The 27,481 fans at Martin
Stadium saw the track meet
many observers had predicted.
The two teams combined for
1133 yards of total offense —

the Cards exploding for 607
yards and the Cougars storm
ing back with 526.
"Their offense is just better
than our defense," WSU coach
Jim Walden said.
"I didn't think there was any
way we could lose today," Dils
said, "we were so pissed off all
week." What irritated the
Cards was their 34-31 giveaway
to Washington last week fol
lowing a similarly charitable ef
fort at UCLA, where Stanford
handed the Bruins a 27-26 gift.
The Cards are now 1-2 in the
conference and 4-3 overall.
The Cougars fell to a 1-2 league
mark and a 3-2-1 seasonal tally.
Despite Dils' prolific air as
sault, Stanford had originally
planned to keep the ball on the
ground most of the day.
"We felt going into the game
that we would run outside a lot
because teams have blitzed us
quite a bit the last two weeks,"
Walsh said. "Their defense was
playing with a man under and it
made the sweep work effec
tively."

So effectively that with
third-and-goal from the WSU
19 and the Cards ahead 14-7,
Dils gave to running back Dar
rin Nelson on a sweep left. The
sophomore halfback cut be
hind a Paul Hibler block and
raced to the end zone with his
second TD of the game.
"Darrin sets the block up for
me," Hibler said. "I just have to
hit whoever's out front and
Darrin cuts behind me."
Hibler and the rest of the of
fensive line also provided Dils
with an extraordinary amount
of time throughout the game.
"I had all sorts of time," Dils
said, "our offensive line is the
best anywhere."
In an equally modest as
sessment, Hibler said, "We
pretty much humiliated their
front line."
Washington State used a lot
of three-man rush to compen
sate for what Walden termed a
"green defense, especially in
the secondary."
Dils did not waste time be
fore exploiting the porous

WSU pass defense. After his
first pass was dropped by Nel
son, Dils completed four in a
row, the last one a 23-yard TD
pass to Nelson.
Thompson brought the
Cougars right back with a 94-
yard scoring drive, the longest
drive against the Cards this
year.
Stanford responded with an
80-yard drive capped by a 29-
yard pass from Dils to wide re
ceiver Ken Margerum.
"It was the same post-corner
pattern I scored on last week,"
Margerum said. "I got the guy
to bite on my move and Steve's
pass was perfect. I think five of
my six touchdowns have come
on that pattern."
Margerum caught six passes
for 99 yards and was wide open
every time Dils went to him,
despite a healthy dose of dou
ble coverage.
"There were huge holes over
the middle," Margerum said of
the Cougar pass defense. "We
just kept testing them there
and it stayed open. I don't un

derstand why they had their
two corners rolled up like that.
I guess it was to try and stop the
passes to our backs."
In the second quarter the
Cards opened a 20-point lead
on the 19-yard run by Nelson
and a 33-yard pass from Dils to
flanker Andre Tyler. Although
WSU scored a touchdown just
before the half, Stanford ex
panded its lead to 26 points,
40-14, in the third quarter on an
18-yard double reverse pass
from Dils to tight end Pat Bowe
and a 22-yard TD catch by Nel
son. •

sate for what Walden termed a
"green defense, especially in
the secondary."
Dils did not waste time be
fore exploiting the porous

WSU pass defense. After his
first pass was dropped by Nel
son, Dils completed four in a
row, the last one a 23-yard TD
pass to Nelson.
Thompson brought the
Cougars right back with a 94-
yard scoring drive, the longest
drive against the Cards this
year.
Stanford responded with an
80-yard drive capped by a 29-
yard pass from Dils to wide re
ceiver Ken Margerum.
"It was the same post-corner
pattern I scored on last week,"
Margerum said. "I got the guy
to bite on my move and Steve's
pass was perfect. I think five of
my six touchdowns have come
on that pattern."
Margerum caught six passes
for 99 yards and was wide open
every time Dils went to him,
despite a healthy dose of dou
ble coverage.
"There were huge holes over
the middle," Margerum said of
the Cougar pass defense. "We
just kept testing them there
and it stayed open. I don't un

derstand why they had their
two corners rolled up like that.
I guess it was to try and stop the
passes to our backs."
In the second quarter the
Cards opened a 20-point lead
on the 19-yard run by Nelson
and a 33-yard pass from Dils to
flanker Andre Tyler. Although
WSU scored a touchdown just
before the half, Stanford ex
panded its lead to 26 points,
40-14, in the third quarter on an
18-yard double reverse pass
from Dils to tight end Pat Bowe
and a 22-yard TD catch by Nel
son. •
Thompson engineered two
more Washington State
touchdown drives, but the
Cougars lost three fumbles in
the last 20 minutes to extin
guish any chance of a com
eback.
The fourth quarter served
primarily for Dils to etch his
name in the conference record
book (see accompanying
story).
Almost obscured by the
two-man aerial war were
standout efforts by WSU run
ning backs Ray Williams and
Tali Ena and Stanford backfield
mates Nelson and Phil Francis.
Williams ran for 93 yards and
two TDs and caught four pas
ses while Ena gained 88 yards
on the ground and 92 yards on
nine receptions.
Nelson ran for 95 yards on 15
carries and snagged six passes
for 91 yards. He scored three
times — once on the ground
and twice on receptions. And
early in the second quarter he
became Stanford's career rush
ing leader, breaking Ray Hand
ley's mark of 1768 yards. In his
first season and a half, Nelson
has carried the ball 284 times
for 1794 yards and a 6.3 yard
average.
Francis, the top receiver in
the Pac-10 and No. 3 in the na
tion going into the game,
caught eight passes for 62 yards
and ran for 61 more.
The sterling play of the of
fense notwithstanding, Stan
ford had troubles Saturday.
Last week Washington
blocked two Stanford punts.
The Cards avoided the prob
lem most of Saturday by not
punting. Converting on 16 of
23 third-downs, including the
first 12, Stanford begged the
issue until midway through the
fourth period. Then WSU
safety Mike Snow blocked Ken
Naber's punt — his first of the
day — and the Cougars reco
vered on the 5, converting the
error into six points on the next
play.
"There was no excuse for
that," Walsh said, "we worked
on it all week in practice. We
tightened our line splits and
they were smart and sent a man
in from the outside who
blocked it."
The Cards were also hurt by
four holding calls on center
John Macauley, three of them
when Stanford had the ball in
side the 5 and one of them nul
lifying a TD.
"They (the officials) called
the same thing, from the same
position, on the same play,
three times," Walsh said. "It
will be interesting to see the
films."
"I truthfully don't believe I

was holding on those plays,"
Macauley said. "But it's really a
subjective thing and once they
called it they started looking
out for me."
Hibler said the calls came
when Macauley used an ex
tended arm while blocking, a
technique within the rules.
Unlike the past two weeks,

however, Stanford played so
well that the annoying mis
takes did not change the out
come.
"I'll wake up happy tomor
row and I'll wake up happy
Monday," Dils said. "It'll be
nice because I certainly didn't
wake up happy after last
week's game."

Darrin Nelson is the new all-time career rushing record holder for the
Cards following his 95-yard performance against the Washington
State Cougars Saturday. Nelson now has a total of 1794 yards in 18
games. Here he eludes defenders in the Washington game two weeks
ago.
Pullman, Wash. — In the
Pacific-10 version of the arms
race, Stanford displayed the
more potent arsenal as Cardi
nal field general Steve Dils led
his team to a 43-27 victory over
Washington State Saturday.
Completing 32 of 51 passes
for five touchdowns and a
Pac-10 record 430 yards, Dils
overshadowed Cougar QB Jack
Thompson who threw for a
"meager" 274 yards and two
TDs while completing 24 of 34
passes.
"We were watching the local
TV and their coaching staff was
on and indicated that they had
the best offense in collegiate
football," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. He added poin
tedly, "We took their word for
it."
Both offenses were awe
some, but Stanford's was bet
ter. The 27,481 fans at Martin
Stadium saw the track meet
many observers had predicted.
The two teams combined for
1133 yards of total offense —

the Cards exploding for 607
yards and the Cougars storm
ing back with 526.
"Their offense is just better
than our defense," WSU coach
Jim Walden said.
"I didn't think there was any
way we could lose today," Dils
said, "we were so pissed off all
week." What irritated the
Cards was their 34-31 giveaway
to Washington last week fol
lowing a similarly charitable ef
fort at UCLA, where Stanford
handed the Bruins a 27-26 gift.
The Cards are now 1-2 in the
conference and 4-3 overall.
The Cougars fell to a 1-2 league
mark and a 3-2-1 seasonal tally.
Despite Dils' prolific air as
sault, Stanford had originally
planned to keep the ball on the
ground most of the day.
"We felt going into the game
that we would run outside a lot
because teams have blitzed us
quite a bit the last two weeks,"
Walsh said. "Their defense was
playing with a man under and it
made the sweep work effec
tively."

So effectively that with
third-and-goal from the WSU
19 and the Cards ahead 14-7,
Dils gave to running back Dar
rin Nelson on a sweep left. The
sophomore halfback cut be
hind a Paul Hibler block and
raced to the end zone with his
second TD of the game.
"Darrin sets the block up for
me," Hibler said. "I just have to
hit whoever's out front and
Darrin cuts behind me."
Hibler and the rest of the of
fensive line also provided Dils
with an extraordinary amount
of time throughout the game.
"I had all sorts of time," Dils
said, "our offensive line is the
best anywhere."
In an equally modest as
sessment, Hibler said, "We
pretty much humiliated their
front line."
Washington State used a lot
of three-man rush to compen
sate for what Walden termed a
"green defense, especially in
the secondary."
Dils did not waste time be
fore exploiting the porous

WSU pass defense. After his
first pass was dropped by Nel
