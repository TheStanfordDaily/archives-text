# Steve Dils – stellar performer
## New name in Stanford records 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Pullman, Wash. — The chilly
breezes which kept
Washington State fans snug
gled up to their flasks Satur
day did nothing to cool down
Stanford quarterback Steve
Dils as he burned up the
Cougar secondary and the
conference record book.
Heading into the game,
Washington State ranked
dead last in the Pac-10 in rush
ing defense and the Cards fi
gured to spend much of the
day grinding out yardage on
Martin Stadium's artificial
surface. The Cards kept the
ball on the ground their first
six plays and then Dils began
piercing the Cougar secon
dary.
When he was through, the
6-foot-2, 190-pound junior
from Vancouver, Wash., had
completed 32 of 51 passes for
430 yards and five
touchdowns and run foreight
more yards.
His passing and total of
fense yardage marks broke
conference records held by
two other Stanford quarter
backs — Dick Norman's 401
yards passing against Cal in
1959 and Jim Plunkett's 416
yards total offense against
Purdue in 1969. The five TD
passes tied a conference
mark shared by four others.
(He had a sixth scoring pass
called back in the fourth
quarter ona holding penalty.)
Dils' performance was
well-timed:
— Sports Illustrated sent a
writer to the game to watch
Dils and Jack Thompson for
an article on the absence of a
clear-cut candidate for this
year's Heisman.
— Much of Dils' family and
many of his high school
friends attended Saturday's
game. "All my really good
friends from high school ha

ven't seen me play since we
graduated, and they were
here today."
— After bitterly disappoint
ing losses the last two weeks,
the Cards needed a good
showing to snap out of their
stupor.
Dils said that outstanding
pass protection, consistently
well-run routes, some great
catches and no interceptions
made the difference in his

performance to date.
The absence of intercept
ions was particularly notice
able as Dils had thrown 13 in
the first six games this year.
"Coach (Rod) Dowhower
and coach (Bill) Walsh made a
reel of my interceptions this
week and we studied it to find
what was going wrong," Dils
said. "On six of seven of them
I tried to throw it to receivers
who had stopped moving. I

locked on to each receiver
too long. Today I went
through my progression
much quicker.
"I didn't force any passes
today. If no one was open, I
threw it away."
"Steve used very good
judgment today," Walsh said.
"You must remember that
this was only the eighth game
he's started here and he's re
latively inexperienced.
"On offense, it was our
best game technically,"
Walsh continued. "Our pro
tection was great and Steve's
mechanics were good. He
has learned his lesson
through some tough games."
Stanford converted its first
12 third down and the Cards
seemed to have no problems
reading the Cougar defense.
"We blitzed about six times
today," WSU coach Jim Wal
den said, "and they got TDs
on two of them." One of
those touchdowns was a 33-
yard strike from Dils to wide
receiver Andre Tyler which
typified the effortlessness
with which the Cards moved
the ball.
"After they were burned
with those two touchdowns
they wouldn't blitz," Dils
said, "and it became easy to
guess what they were doing
on defense."
It was after midnight when
the turboprop carrying the
Cardinals back from Pullman
set down in San Jose. Nearly
everyone on the team was as
leep. Steve Dils sat back in his
seat with his eyes open and
said after a game he never
gets to sleep until around
three o'clock.
This week, at least, those
waking hours were spent re
lishing an unmatched per
formance and not suffering
the anguish of a stolen vic
tory.

1959 and Jim Plunkett's 416
yards total offense against
Purdue in 1969. The five TD
passes tied a conference
mark shared by four others.
(He had a sixth scoring pass
called back in the fourth
quarter ona holding penalty.)
Dils' performance was
well-timed:
— Sports Illustrated sent a
writer to the game to watch
Dils and Jack Thompson for
an article on the absence of a
clear-cut candidate for this
year's Heisman.
— Much of Dils' family and
many of his high school
friends attended Saturday's
game. "All my really good
friends from high school ha

ven't seen me play since we
graduated, and they were
here today."
— After bitterly disappoint
ing losses the last two weeks,
the Cards needed a good
showing to snap out of their
stupor.
Dils said that outstanding
pass protection, consistently
well-run routes, some great
catches and no interceptions
made the difference in his

performance to date.
The absence of intercept
ions was particularly notice
able as Dils had thrown 13 in
the first six games this year.
"Coach (Rod) Dowhower
and coach (Bill) Walsh made a
reel of my interceptions this
week and we studied it to find
what was going wrong," Dils
said. "On six of seven of them
I tried to throw it to receivers
who had stopped moving. I

locked on to each receiver
too long. Today I went
through my progression
much quicker.
"I didn't force any passes
today. If no one was open, I
threw it away."
"Steve used very good
judgment today," Walsh said.
"You must remember that
this was only the eighth game
he's started here and he's re
latively inexperienced.
"On offense, it was our
best game technically,"
Walsh continued. "Our pro
tection was great and Steve's
mechanics were good. He
has learned his lesson
through some tough games."
Stanford converted its first
12 third down and the Cards
seemed to have no problems
reading the Cougar defense.
"We blitzed about six times
today," WSU coach Jim Wal
den said, "and they got TDs
on two of them." One of
those touchdowns was a 33-
yard strike from Dils to wide
receiver Andre Tyler which
typified the effortlessness
with which the Cards moved
the ball.
"After they were burned
with those two touchdowns
they wouldn't blitz," Dils
said, "and it became easy to
guess what they were doing
on defense."
It was after midnight when
the turboprop carrying the
Cardinals back from Pullman
set down in San Jose. Nearly
everyone on the team was as
leep. Steve Dils sat back in his
seat with his eyes open and
said after a game he never
gets to sleep until around
three o'clock.
This week, at least, those
waking hours were spent re
lishing an unmatched per
formance and not suffering
the anguish of a stolen vic
tory.

Steve Dils prepares to pass — again. The Cardinal quarterback
broke loose Saturday in his home state to exceed several
Pacific-10 records, including those for passing and total of-
Pullman, Wash. — The chilly
breezes which kept
Washington State fans snug
gled up to their flasks Satur
day did nothing to cool down
Stanford quarterback Steve
Dils as he burned up the
Cougar secondary and the
conference record book.
Heading into the game,
Washington State ranked
dead last in the Pac-10 in rush
ing defense and the Cards fi
gured to spend much of the
day grinding out yardage on
Martin Stadium's artificial
surface. The Cards kept the
ball on the ground their first
six plays and then Dils began
piercing the Cougar secon
dary.
When he was through, the
6-foot-2, 190-pound junior
from Vancouver, Wash., had
completed 32 of 51 passes for
430 yards and five
touchdowns and run foreight
more yards.
His passing and total of
fense yardage marks broke
conference records held by
two other Stanford quarter
backs — Dick Norman's 401
yards passing against Cal in
1959 and Jim Plunkett's 416
yards total offense against
Purdue in 1969. The five TD
passes tied a conference
