"How'd the soccer team
do?"
"They beat Sonoma State
17-0 and St. Mary's 10-0."
"No, I mean in soccer."
Cotati — That's the way some
conversations sounded this
weekend after Stanford
thoroughly dominated in two
lopsided victories, bringing its
season mark to 13-2 overall and
3-2 in conference play.
"I thought the St. Mary's
team was going to be a little bit
stronger than they were,"
Lodge said. "I had indications
about the Sonoma State team
but never really realized we
would exploit the whole thing.
"Obviously we can't be play
ing teams like Santa Clara and
USF (all the time)," Lodge said.
"And not every program is
where it should be, including
our own, because otherwise
we would have beaten Santa
Clara."
In both appearances, the
Cards' second team played
more than half of each period,
the traffic to and from the
bench looking almost as heavy
as that on the Golden Gate
Bridge Friday afternoon.
Against Sonoma Ted
Rafalovich led the team in scor
ing with four goals and two as
sists while Mark Graham had a
hat trick and an assist. Dan
McNevin tallied two goals and
two assists and Laird Cagan and
Barry Linnett both accounted
fora pair of goals and an assist.
Paul Kozachenko scored one
goal and assisted twice, Clark
Siegel recorded a goal and an
assist and Andre Mann and
Mike Knowles each put in a
goal. Whew.
Saturday against St. Mary's,
McNevin and Rafalovich both
totaled four goals and one as

sist and Bill Hoffenburg and
Knowles each logged a goal.
Greg Delgado, Peter Phillips,
)ack McGannon, Cagan and
Kozachenko all had an assist.
Amid all of the flexing of of
fensive muscles the defense
completely disarmed the op
ponents. In fact, Sonoma
didn't record a single shot on
Boal8 oal - , . .
"Whether or not this is going
to help us against LA State and
UCLA — I have to think about
that," Lodge said. "We're cer
tainly not going to be scoring
those kinds of goals. But I think
the team is good enough that
they'll be able to adjust as soon
as they step on the field," he
said.
The team flies to Los Angeles
tomorrow morning to face LA
State at 3 p.m. The best Hay
ward could do (against them)
was 2-1 in overtime, so they will
be a really worthy opponent;
all opponents are worthy,"
Lodge corrected himself, "it's
just that some are better than
others. Whether they're poor
or good is not our problem.
Our problem is maintaining,
finishing and playing a good
game."
UCLA, a 3-2 overtime loser to
powerhouse USF yesterday,
hosts the Cards Wednesday at
noon and "we've got to win,"
Lodge explained. Fie predicted
that "they're going to be up for
us, seeing as they're 11th and
we're seventh in the (Far West)
rating last week. I'm sure he
has the rating sheet right in
front of their eyes saying, 'The
Stanford team is seventh and
you're going to have to knock
them off.' So, I think it could be
a good game — it's going to be
tight, close, one of those 1-0,
2-1 games; crucial."

Santa Clara. The Broncos won last Wednesday's match 2-0, but the Cards bounced back with a pair of
victories over Sonoma and St. Mary's.
