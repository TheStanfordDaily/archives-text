Led by Anne Thrupp's first-place finish, and a strong "team
performance/ which saw three Stanford runners finish in the top
ten, the women's cross country team finished second at the
Hayward Invitational Saturday.
"Anne ran a smart race," said women's coach Laurel Treon.
Thrupp, still recovering from an ailment which has affected her
running all season, ran the three-mile course in 17:53, crossing
the finish line well ahead of Melissa Aurbuchon of Hayward State.
Thrupp, said she "felt good" and was pleased the Cards "did
well as a team." Treon, however, had more to say of the two-time
All-America's performance: "Anne doesn't have the kick of some
of the other top runners, but she knows how to pace herself. And
she really does look much better."
Sophomore Annette Mungai also ran a "super" race for the
Cards, according to Treon, placing eighth in a time of 18:57. "I felt
strong though the whole race," Mungai said. "We've been train
ing hard and I think we're starting to catch up with some of the
other strong teams."
Other Card runners included Beth Harrison, who finished 10th
in a time of 19:29; Joanne Ernst, 16th (20:07); Kyle Chapman, 17th
(20:11); Karin Pascoe, 23rd (20:40), and Therese Lamb, 34th
(22:03).
The Cards could possibly have won the event if Stanford's No. 2
runner, Susan Bragdon, had not had to drop out of the race
because of the flu.
Treon was noticeably encouraged by the results: "We now
know we are competitive. We know where we stand. It's just a
matter of going out and doing what we want to do."
