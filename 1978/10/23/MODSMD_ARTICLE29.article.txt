Stanford's women's vol
leyball team spent an unsuc
cessful weekend in Los
Angeles losing two matches
back-to-back to crosstown ri
vals USC and UCLA.
Friday night in Pauley Pavil
ion, the Bruins bested the
Cards in four games, 15-4,15-8,
13-15,15-4 to clinch the victory.
The Saturday night perfor
mance at USC was equally dis
appointing as the Trojans won
three straight 15-7, 15-8, 15-9.
"We don't have as much
match experience with top
notch teams like those in
Southern California," said
coach Fred Sturm. "We're not
used to going against teams
that play 20 to 30 matches a year
against the best competition."
The Los Angeles squads are
members of a highly competi
tive conference which includes
Long Beach State, San Diego
State and Pepperdine. Sturm
noted that ever since volleyball
became a varsity sport
sanctioned by the AIAW, the
winner of this league has also
won the nationals.
"We play the best teams in
Northern California," Sturm
said, "but we don't have con
sistent exposure to the type of
teams UCLA and USC play."
On the game against UCLA,
Sturm commented that "we
played as well as we've played
all year. We're acquiring the
ability to relax, not to play so
tight."
This Friday night the Cards
take on an undefeated San Jose
State team in Maples Pavilion at
7:30 in a match that will decide
who will be the conference
representative to the regional
tournament. The Cards have
one loss.
The Spartans are a "scrappy,
well-organized team," accord
ing to Sturm. "We know if we
play well, we'll beat them, but
it will take a total team effort."
