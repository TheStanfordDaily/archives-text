Citing "the dangers of an all
black army," Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) yes
terday told of his plans to intro
duce legislation mandating one
year of military service or two
years of government labor for all
18-year-old men and women in
the United States.
McCloskey, up for re-election
this November, said his "national
service plan" would give 18-
year-olds the option of one year of
military service with four years of
free college education after duty
or two years of government labor
in hospitals, forests or fields.
"You can't find any reasonable
young men in the military now,"
McCloskey told a group of about
20alumni behind Bowman House
yesterday. "What we're seeing
now is a growth in the minorities
in U.S. forces. It's dangerous to
have an all-black army.
"For example, the Mafia was
able to maintain its political and
financial success by infiltrating
the New York Police Depart
ment," he said.

He added that he learned of the
infiltration from )ohn Ehrlichman,
the Watergate conspirator who
was recently released from
prison.
"We can't afford to perpetuate
what's happening now in the
military," the 11-year Congres
sional veteran said.
Falling behind Soviet Union
The military must also be
strengthened because the United
States is "rapidly dropping be
hind" the Soviet Union in military
research finances, McCloskey
said.
"The Soviet Union and the Un
ited States have about the same
amount in military budgets, but
Russia is spending about 23 per
cent on manpower while we're
spending 54 percent," he said.
"This gives the Russians 77 per
cent of their military budget for
research and arms, while we only
have 46 percent. All these costs
add up to make us weaker."
McCloskey said the combat
ready army would help prevent a
war because the enemy "knows
you're ready to go at a drop of a
hat."

Congressman Pete McCloskey discussed political issues yesterday at the
Bowman Alumni House.
While the special incentive of
four years of free college would
be offered to teenagers in the
military, the government laborers
would also be important to the
United States, he said.
"A good proportion of the 18-
year-olds who don't go into the
military will probably work in ag
ricultural labor, cutting off illegal
immigrants now working in the
fields," he said.
McCloskey said that 4.5 million
teenagers turn 18 every year,
while the military only needs
about one million.
McCloskey said he and Sen.
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) are working
together on the legislation.
During his informal meeting
sponsored by the Bay Area
luniors, McCloskey called the
University Board of Trustees
"damn fools" for "tearing down

the wheatfields" and erecting
radio and astronomy equipment.
"They never put enough value
on the beauty of the land," he
said. "I liked it better when there
were wheat fields on the hills in
stead of that big dish."
McCloskey also commented on
federally-funded abortions and
the future of the Republican
party.
He said the power of the Right
to Life group has controlled the
votes of the legislature regarding
abortions.
"At the last vote, 310 con
gressmen denied federal funds
for abortions, while 90 voted to
permit it,"he said. "I think that of
those 310 voting against it, at least
220 would permit their own
daughters to have an abortion if
they got pregnant."
He said women legislators are
consistently voting against the

funding because "there's not one
woman there under the age of 50,
and since they can't have chil
dren, they don't want younger
women to have abortions."
Refusing to describe himself as
a "true Republican, the kind
Ronald Reagan would like,"
McCloskey accused the Republi
can Party as being "devoid of
thought," but added that the
party is still "slightly ahead of the
Democratic Party."
"When you look at the proba
ble 1980 contenders for the presi
dency — )ohn Connally, lerry
Ford and Ronald Reagan — you've
got to agree the Republican party
structure is rather bizarre," he
said.
McCloskey will be on campus
again Nov. 2 when the Stanford
Law School presents a debate be
tween him and his Democratic
challenger Kirsten Olsen.

party.
He said the power of the Right
to Life group has controlled the
votes of the legislature regarding
abortions.
"At the last vote, 310 con
gressmen denied federal funds
for abortions, while 90 voted to
permit it,"he said. "I think that of
those 310 voting against it, at least
220 would permit their own
daughters to have an abortion if
they got pregnant."
He said women legislators are
consistently voting against the

funding because "there's not one
woman there under the age of 50,
and since they can't have chil
dren, they don't want younger
women to have abortions."
Refusing to describe himself as
a "true Republican, the kind
Ronald Reagan would like,"
McCloskey accused the Republi
can Party as being "devoid of
thought," but added that the
party is still "slightly ahead of the
Democratic Party."
"When you look at the proba
ble 1980 contenders for the presi
dency — )ohn Connally, lerry
Ford and Ronald Reagan — you've
got to agree the Republican party
structure is rather bizarre," he
said.
McCloskey will be on campus
again Nov. 2 when the Stanford
Law School presents a debate be
tween him and his Democratic
challenger Kirsten Olsen.

Citing "the dangers of an all
black army," Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) yes
terday told of his plans to intro
duce legislation mandating one
year of military service or two
years of government labor for all
18-year-old men and women in
the United States.
McCloskey, up for re-election
this November, said his "national
service plan" would give 18-
year-olds the option of one year of
military service with four years of
free college education after duty
or two years of government labor
in hospitals, forests or fields.
"You can't find any reasonable
young men in the military now,"
McCloskey told a group of about
20alumni behind Bowman House
yesterday. "What we're seeing
now is a growth in the minorities
in U.S. forces. It's dangerous to
have an all-black army.
"For example, the Mafia was
able to maintain its political and
financial success by infiltrating
the New York Police Depart
ment," he said.

He added that he learned of the
infiltration from )ohn Ehrlichman,
the Watergate conspirator who
was recently released from
prison.
"We can't afford to perpetuate
what's happening now in the
military," the 11-year Congres
sional veteran said.
Falling behind Soviet Union
The military must also be
strengthened because the United
States is "rapidly dropping be
hind" the Soviet Union in military
research finances, McCloskey
said.
"The Soviet Union and the Un
ited States have about the same
amount in military budgets, but
Russia is spending about 23 per
cent on manpower while we're
spending 54 percent," he said.
"This gives the Russians 77 per
cent of their military budget for
research and arms, while we only
have 46 percent. All these costs
add up to make us weaker."
McCloskey said the combat
ready army would help prevent a
war because the enemy "knows
you're ready to go at a drop of a
hat."

Congressman Pete McCloskey discussed political issues yesterday at the
Bowman Alumni House.
While the special incentive of
four years of free college would
be offered to teenagers in the
military, the government laborers
would also be important to the
United States, he said.
"A good proportion of the 18-
year-olds who don't go into the
military will probably work in ag
ricultural labor, cutting off illegal
immigrants now working in the
fields," he said.
McCloskey said that 4.5 million
teenagers turn 18 every year,
while the military only needs
about one million.
McCloskey said he and Sen.
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) are working
together on the legislation.
During his informal meeting
sponsored by the Bay Area
luniors, McCloskey called the
University Board of Trustees
"damn fools" for "tearing down

the wheatfields" and erecting
radio and astronomy equipment.
"They never put enough value
on the beauty of the land," he
said. "I liked it better when there
were wheat fields on the hills in
stead of that big dish."
McCloskey also commented on
federally-funded abortions and
the future of the Republican
party.
