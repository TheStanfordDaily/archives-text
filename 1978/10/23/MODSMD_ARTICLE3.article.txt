Citing "the dangers of an all
black army," Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) yes
terday told of his plans to intro
duce legislation mandating one
year of military service or two
years of government labor for all
18-year-old men and women in
the United States.
McCloskey, up for re-election
this November, said his "national
service plan" would give 18-
year-olds the option of one year of
military service with four years of
free college education after duty
or two years of government labor
in hospitals, forests or fields.
"You can't find any reasonable
young men in the military now,"
McCloskey told a group of about
20alumni behind Bowman House
yesterday. "What we're seeing
now is a growth in the minorities
in U.S. forces. It's dangerous to
have an all-black army.
"For example, the Mafia was
able to maintain its political and
financial success by infiltrating
the New York Police Depart
ment," he said.

He added that he learned of the
infiltration from )ohn Ehrlichman,
the Watergate conspirator who
was recently released from
prison.
"We can't afford to perpetuate
what's happening now in the
military," the 11-year Congres
sional veteran said.
Falling behind Soviet Union
The military must also be
strengthened because the United
States is "rapidly dropping be
hind" the Soviet Union in military
research finances, McCloskey
said.
"The Soviet Union and the Un
ited States have about the same
amount in military budgets, but
Russia is spending about 23 per
cent on manpower while we're
spending 54 percent," he said.
"This gives the Russians 77 per
cent of their military budget for
research and arms, while we only
have 46 percent. All these costs
add up to make us weaker."
McCloskey said the combat
ready army would help prevent a
war because the enemy "knows
you're ready to go at a drop of a
hat."
