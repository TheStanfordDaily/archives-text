# Undefeated poloists drown southern Cal foes
## UCI, UCLA crumble in the face of onslaught

Ed Newland, UC-lrvine's water polo coach, was quite
matter of fact about it.
"Stanford is a very good team," he said. "They're head
and shoulders above everybody else. If they don't win
the NCAAs, they're screwed."
Newland's remark was prompted by the Cardinals'
impressive 10-5 victory over the Anteaters Saturday,
Stanford's third conquest over Irvine this year. Friday,
the Cards dispatched the UCLA Bruins, 9-5.
Saturday's game was over before seven minutes had
elapsed as Stanford erupted for five goals in the first
quarter, while holding the Anteaters scoreless. Two of
the five came from the arm of senior Robby Arnold
before he fouled out with 30 secondc left in the period.
Senior Tom Angelo and junior Randy Kalbus ac
counted for all of Stanford's scoring during the rest of
the contest, as each finished with three goals.
"We took what they gave us," Angelo said. "Every
thing went right in the first quarter; it was a 5-5 game
after that."
"Angelo — he's just tough," said Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti. "He loves to beat Irvine.
"Randy Kalbus had his best game of the year," De
ttamanti added. "Kalbus and (freshman Chris) Kelsey
were just burning down the pool on the fast-break."
Stanford's defense also gave Irvine trouble. The An
teaters finally broke through for three goals in the sec

ond period but did not score again until 1:30 was left in
the game. A half-blocked outside shot with 41 seconds
left gave Irvine its final tally.
As usual, goalie John Cansel anchored the defense,
recording 11 saves and one steal coming out of the goal.'
"John had 'em pegged. He anticipated every shot and
didn't get surprised at all," Dettamanti said.
Friday's game with UCLA followed a similar pattern.
After a slow first quarter, which ended with Stanford
leading 1-0, the Cards jumped out toas-1 halftimeedge.
Angelo again provided the offensive spark, scoring the
Cards' first three goals. Six other Stanford players each
added a single score. Like Irvine, the Bruins scored their
fourth and fifth goals in the closing minute of the game
— their fifth coming at the final buzzer.
Back-up goalie Vince Vannelli, starting his first game,
made seven saves and two steals.
"For the first three quarters, I played as well as I
anticipated, though I made some nervous mistakes,"
Vannelli said. "I figured, 'this is my one shot and I better
make the best of it.' "
"Vince did an excellent job," Dettamanti said. "He
was in good position and did an excellent job coming
out of the goal. He had a bit of a tough time passing, but
that had a lot to do with the wind." This weekend's
victories boost Stanford's record to 16-0-1, with eight
matches remining. Irvine, which beat California Friday,
is 9-5.
