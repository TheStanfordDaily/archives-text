SALT talks 'constructive'
Moscow — U.S. and Soviet negotiators wound
up almost eight hours of talks late yesterday with
out reporting a breakthrough on a new treaty to
limit strategic arms. But the Americans sounded an
optimistic note.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance described the
day's second round of talks aimed at clearing key
obstacles to an agreement as "constructive," a
Vance spokesman said.
Though no details were provided by U.S. offi
cials, it seemed clear that after outlining their posi
tion in the morning the Soviets had refined their
proposals in a gesture of compromise when they
returned to the table in the Kremlin.
Driving the upbeat message home, the spokes
man, Hodding Carter, said he could not claim
"progress" but wanted to underscore Vance's
choice of the word "constructive."
"The secretary is not given to excessive use of
adjectives," he said.
John Paul II assumes throne
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II assumed the
throne of St. Peter yesterday before one of the
largest crowds in Vatican history and reached out
symbolically to Roman Catholics in the Soviet
bloc.
"May he live a hundred years!" chanted Polish
pilgrims waving the red-and-white flag of their
Communist land as the former archbishop of

Krakow was installed as leader of the world's 700
million Roman Catholics, history's first Polish
pope.
"Remember me today and always in your
prayers, pray for me," the new pontiff asked in his
homily. "Help me to be able to serve you."
He described himself as "full of trepidation,
conscious of his "unworthiness."
Covert recruiting continues
Washington — CIA Director Stansfield Turner
said yesterday he will not comply with a Harvard
University ban on covert recruiting of foreign stu
dents as CIA agents.
"If we were required to abide by the rules of
every corporation, every academic institution, it
would become impossible to do the required job
for our country," Turner said. "Harvard does not
have any legal authority over us.'
In response to a direct question, Turner said the
CIA would ignore the university's restriction.
Harvard President Derek Bok complained to a
Senate committee this summer that the CIA covert
recruiting threatens "the integrity and indepen
dence of the academic community."
China and Japan sign treaty
Tokyo — Teng Hsiao-ping, the highest-ranking
Chinese Communist leader ever to visit Japan,
flew here yesterday from Peking for the ceremo
nial conclusion of a peace treaty formally ending

four decades of war and hostility between the two
Asian powers.
Today the Chinese vice premier will witness the
exchange of instruments of ratification of the
Chinese-Japanese peace and friendship treaty
signed Aug. 12 in Peking, and after the ceremony
will become the first Chinese leader ever to meet
with Emperor Hirohito.
Iranian protesters killed
Tehran, Iran — Police opened fire on students
and teachers demonstrating against the govern
ment yesterday in the city of Hamadan, killing at
least five persons and wounding 18, press reports
said.
The reports said the bloodshed occurred when
protesters ignored warnings to disperse and
began setting fires to banks and government
buildings. Hamadan is 250 miles west of Tehran.
In Isfahan, 200 miles south of the capital,
thousands of high school and university students
staged a protest march Saturday, it was reported.
The students demanded an end to martial law,
release of political prisoners and repeal of the
government's ban on gatherings of more than
three persons, the reports said.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except variable fog or
low clouds late nights and mornings. Cooler to
morrow. Lows in upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs today
in the 70s to low 80s.

The reports said the bloodshed occurred when
protesters ignored warnings to disperse and
began setting fires to banks and government
buildings. Hamadan is 250 miles west of Tehran.
In Isfahan, 200 miles south of the capital,
thousands of high school and university students
staged a protest march Saturday, it was reported.
The students demanded an end to martial law,
release of political prisoners and repeal of the
government's ban on gatherings of more than
three persons, the reports said.

SALT talks 'constructive'
Moscow — U.S. and Soviet negotiators wound
up almost eight hours of talks late yesterday with
out reporting a breakthrough on a new treaty to
limit strategic arms. But the Americans sounded an
optimistic note.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance described the
day's second round of talks aimed at clearing key
obstacles to an agreement as "constructive," a
Vance spokesman said.
Though no details were provided by U.S. offi
cials, it seemed clear that after outlining their posi
tion in the morning the Soviets had refined their
proposals in a gesture of compromise when they
returned to the table in the Kremlin.
Driving the upbeat message home, the spokes
man, Hodding Carter, said he could not claim
"progress" but wanted to underscore Vance's
choice of the word "constructive."
"The secretary is not given to excessive use of
adjectives," he said.
John Paul II assumes throne
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II assumed the
throne of St. Peter yesterday before one of the
largest crowds in Vatican history and reached out
symbolically to Roman Catholics in the Soviet
bloc.
"May he live a hundred years!" chanted Polish
pilgrims waving the red-and-white flag of their
Communist land as the former archbishop of

Krakow was installed as leader of the world's 700
million Roman Catholics, history's first Polish
pope.
"Remember me today and always in your
prayers, pray for me," the new pontiff asked in his
homily. "Help me to be able to serve you."
He described himself as "full of trepidation,
conscious of his "unworthiness."
Covert recruiting continues
Washington — CIA Director Stansfield Turner
said yesterday he will not comply with a Harvard
University ban on covert recruiting of foreign stu
dents as CIA agents.
"If we were required to abide by the rules of
every corporation, every academic institution, it
would become impossible to do the required job
for our country," Turner said. "Harvard does not
have any legal authority over us.'
In response to a direct question, Turner said the
CIA would ignore the university's restriction.
Harvard President Derek Bok complained to a
Senate committee this summer that the CIA covert
recruiting threatens "the integrity and indepen
dence of the academic community."
China and Japan sign treaty
Tokyo — Teng Hsiao-ping, the highest-ranking

nial conclusion of a peace treaty formally ending

Asian powers.
Today the Chinese vice premier will witness the

Chinese-Japanese peace and friendship treaty
signed Aug. 12 in Peking, and after the ceremony
will become the first Chinese leader ever to meet
with Emperor Hirohito.
