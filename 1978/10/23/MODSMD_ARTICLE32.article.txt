# 12 more nurses send in their resignations
## 
### 
Twelve more nurses in the Hospi
tal's Intensive Care Nursery resigned
Friday "in response to a lot of frustra
tion," and unless negotiations can
solve the labor problems before
Nov. 7, only four of the 50 unit nurses
will be left to take care of the chroni
cally ill infants.
"None of us want to leave," said
Penny Row, a head nurse who sub
mitted her resignation.
The problems in the ward center
around the lack of guidance given to
new interns, she said.
"We want the junior medical staff
to have more support and more in
tensive guidance," Row explained.
"The faculty, fellows and senior resi
dents must back up the new interns.
There needs to be a more formal rela
tionship between all of them."
Row said the interns arrived at the
nursery in July and the "frustrations"
have been building up since that
time.
"The resignation is an emotional
reaction," she said. "We want the
delivery care here to be the absolute
best."
Dr. Irving Schulman, chairman of
pediatrics, said the atmosphere in
the nursery is one of great tension
and emotional strain.

"There may be some justification"
to their complaint, he said.
Gary Mecklenburg, Hospital ad
ministrator, agreed the facilities are
"overburdened and require re
placement," adding that construc
tion of a larger nursery should be
underway early next year.
But unless administrators can
solve the immediate problem with
the nurses next week, they will have
to cut back the number of patients in
the unit because 23 nurses cannot be
replaced by Nov. 7, Schulman said.
