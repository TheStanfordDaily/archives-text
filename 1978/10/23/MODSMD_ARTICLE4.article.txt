# SLAC funds threatened over vote dispute

### STEVE WARILA 
Federal funding for the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) was apparently
threatened by three Republican members of
the House Appropriations Committee.
During recent lobbying over a public works
bill, Congressman Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) was handed a note that read "Stanford
Linear Accelerator, $73 million."
According to McCloskey's press secretary,
Michelle Farrar, this note was "a low grade form
of bribery." The three Republi .n con
gressmen wanted to override President |immy
Carter's veto of the public works bill, but
McCloskey agreed with Carter that the bill
needed work.
The implication of the note, said Farrar, was
"if you don't vote for this bill, we're going to do

our best to eliminate the funds for SLAC."
McCloskey voted to sustain the veto. The
threat to stop appropriations for SLAC remains.
This year's funding, about $80 million, has
already been approved. Theissue will not come
up again until the House Appropriations Com
mittee begins considering next year's budget in
January.
At that point, according to Farrar, it is "a
possibility, but not a probability" that SLAC
could be affected.
Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky, director of SLAC,
was perplexed but not overly concerned by the
threat. Although SLAC is totally dependent on
federal funds, the yearly operating cost is in
cluded in the Department of Energy budget for
high energy research. A cut in these funds is not

likely to happen, Panofsky said.
Panofsky noted the problems in securing
funds for starting or enlarging a project such as
SLAC. Funds beyond normal operation costs,
he said, go through two executive departments
before being included in the president's
budget.
The appropriations must then go through
four congressional committees before the
money is granted to the University.
The University is always susceptible to fed
eral funding cuts. But according to Bob
Rosenzweig, vice president for public affairs,
SLAC is the only program here that receives its
money directly from congressional appropria
tions. Other programs are financed by general
educational funds.
