# Mideast peace treaty tentatively approved
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Egypt and Israel
have tentatively agreed on a peace
treaty to end 30 years of war between
them, the Carter administration said
yesterday.
The breakthrough in the Mideast
peace talks came after intensive
meetings with President Jimmy Car
ter and a long session Saturday bet
ween the delegations, said George
Sherman, State Department
spokesman.
He said the tentative agreement
still must be approved by both gov
ernments, and that there are some
issues still unresolved, such as the
details of oil sales between the coun
tries.
But he said the main issues which
had brought the talks close to a
breakdown last week had been re
solved.

Those issues included the linkage
Egypt wanted between the separate
peace with Israel and an overall
Mideast settlement, and the timeta
ble for complete normalization of re
lations between the two countries.
Sherman would give no details of
the treaty.
However, the framework agreed
to at the Camp David summit shows
the outlines of the peace that will
emerge unless some new snag is en
countered.
In Tel Aviv, Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan said the proposed tre
aty is "not yet ready for signature"
but that "most of the problems" have
been covered.
He said Carter's intervention in the
talks had been "very, very helpful
and very efficient." But he said there
were important problems in the draft
document he brought back Saturday

from Washington.
In Cairo, an Egyptian government
spokesman said President Anwar
Sadat had received a copy of the draft
treaty and was having legal advisers
evaluate it.
The spokesman said the draft tre
aty "might require in some points
further study to be ready for sign
ing."
Sometime before the end of this
year, the treaty is expected to be
signed. Tha two sides have talked
about a joint ceremony in Cairo and
Jerusalem on Nov. 19, marking the
first anniversary of Sadat's trip to Is
rael.
Three to nine months later, Israeli
troops would withdraw to an inter
mediate point midway between Is
rael's 1967 border and the Suez
Canal. When that withdrawal has

been completed, the two sides are
supposed to establish diplomatic re
lations, marking the first time the
Jewish state has been accorded
legitimacy by an Arab government.
In the Sinai, there are to be two
other boundaries. One, about 30
miles east of Suez, would mark a
point beyond which Egyptian troops
must not be stationed.
A second line, lying west of the
border, would mark a demilitarized
zone within Egyptian territory. In it,
only lightly armed police and United
Nations troops would be allowed.
The framework also guarantees Is
rael rights of passage through the
Suez Canal, the strait of Tiran and the
Gulf of Aqaba.
As part of the agreement, the two
sides also agreed to construct a
highway between Egypt and Jordan.

highway between Egypt and Jordan.
Washington (AP) — Egypt and Israel
have tentatively agreed on a peace
treaty to end 30 years of war between
them, the Carter administration said
yesterday.
The breakthrough in the Mideast
peace talks came after intensive
meetings with President Jimmy Car
ter and a long session Saturday bet
ween the delegations, said George
Sherman, State Department
spokesman.
He said the tentative agreement
still must be approved by both gov
ernments, and that there are some
issues still unresolved, such as the
details of oil sales between the coun
tries.
But he said the main issues which
had brought the talks close to a
breakdown last week had been re
solved.

Those issues included the linkage
Egypt wanted between the separate
peace with Israel and an overall
Mideast settlement, and the timeta
ble for complete normalization of re
lations between the two countries.
Sherman would give no details of
the treaty.
However, the framework agreed
to at the Camp David summit shows
the outlines of the peace that will
emerge unless some new snag is en
countered.
In Tel Aviv, Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan said the proposed tre
aty is "not yet ready for signature"
but that "most of the problems" have
been covered.
He said Carter's intervention in the
talks had been "very, very helpful
and very efficient." But he said there
were important problems in the draft
document he brought back Saturday

from Washington.
In Cairo, an Egyptian government
spokesman said President Anwar
Sadat had received a copy of the draft
treaty and was having legal advisers
evaluate it.
The spokesman said the draft tre
aty "might require in some points
further study to be ready for sign
ing."
Sometime before the end of this
year, the treaty is expected to be
signed. Tha two sides have talked
about a joint ceremony in Cairo and
Jerusalem on Nov. 19, marking the
first anniversary of Sadat's trip to Is
rael.
Three to nine months later, Israeli
troops would withdraw to an inter
mediate point midway between Is
rael's 1967 border and the Suez
Canal. When that withdrawal has

been completed, the two sides are
supposed to establish diplomatic re
lations, marking the first time the
Jewish state has been accorded
legitimacy by an Arab government.
In the Sinai, there are to be two
other boundaries. One, about 30
miles east of Suez, would mark a
point beyond which Egyptian troops
must not be stationed.
A second line, lying west of the
border, would mark a demilitarized
zone within Egyptian territory. In it,
only lightly armed police and United
Nations troops would be allowed.
The framework also guarantees Is
rael rights of passage through the
Suez Canal, the strait of Tiran and the
Gulf of Aqaba.
As part of the agreement, the two
sides also agreed to construct a
highway between Egypt and Jordan.
