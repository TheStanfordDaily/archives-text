Washington (AP) — Mayor
Tom Bradley and Lord Killanin
of Ireland, in a White House
ceremony Friday, formally
signed a contract that will bring
the 1984 summer Olympics to
Los Angeles.
President jimmy Carter had
planned to attend the cere
mony in the Roosevelt Room
but, according to Bradley,
could not get away from a
meeting elsewhere in the man
sion.
"We know what a steadfast
friend and supporter of
amateur athletics, the presi
dent is," said Bradley at the
ceremony which was con
ducted by presidential assis
tant Jack Watson.
Bradley said: "This is an his
toric day for Los Angeles and
the country. We will represent
all the people in the United
States when we put on the
Olympic games."
It will be only the second
time that the summer Olym
pics have been held in the Un
ited States; the other being
held in Los Angeles in 1932.
"We hope to put on the
games that will be a matter of
pride to the Olympic move
ment, the country and the
city," said Bradley.
The Los Angeles mayor also
made note of the year-long
disagreement with the Interna
tional Olympic Committee
overfinancial responsibility for
any losses accrued by the
games.
"It appeared at one time that
the issue would never be re
solved," Bradley said. "With
this signing, that issue has now
been joined."
Lord Killanin, the president
of the International Olympic
Committee, also made note of
the disagreement. "We ran
into problems but I am glad
wise men can sit down and
solve them," Killanin said.
