How should Americans react
to apartheid rule in South Af
rica? Nearly two years after the
protest demonstration in Old
Union, which resulted in 294
arrests, students still question
the morality of University in
vestment in South African cor
porations.
But increased trade with
South Africa is the most effec
tive way to break down the
"colorbar," according to Lewis
Gann and Peter Duignan, au
thors of South Africa: War, Re
volution or Peace?, published
last month by Hoover Institu
tion.
Duignan and Gann, both
senior fellows at Hoover, have
done extensive research on
South Africa. Duignan is direc
tor of African Studies and
curator of the African Collec
tion here. Gann earned a doc
torate in modern history at Ox
ford, and has studied and
worked in Rhodesia and Zam
bia.

"American policy is inconsis
tent with regard to South Af
rica," said Gann. "We believe
that open diplomatic, cultural
and economic relations with
Russia and China are the best
means of influencing these na
tions to treat their people
fairly."
Although divestment groups
assume that withdrawing
economic support may force
an end to apartheid, the white
regime could become oppres
sive in fear of violent uprising,
according to Gann.
In their book, the authors
advocate "using the carrot in
stead of the stick" to bring
about social justice.
"The United States should
use its diplomatic and com
mercial position to persuade,
not boycott or attack."
Gann stated that American
investments amount to only 18
percent of South Africa's total
investments, and as such,
American business is not in a
position to direct policy there.

" Armed revolution could
only bring about disaster,"
Gann said, referring to radical
measures to end apartheid.
Looking at other "free" African
nations, "the prospects for
democracy are not very good.
It's more likely that a revolu
tion would bring about tyranny
or chaos, as in Angola," he
explained.
Economic support, on the
other hand, will stimulate the
economy and open up more
job opportunities for blacks
and whites alike, according to
Gann.
Industrial racial discrimina
tion has already been lifted,
giving blacks who were for
merly unskilled laborers the
opportunity to work in indus
try. An expanding economy
would allow blacks into the
trade unions as well, Gann
said.
"The ideal of the happy,
peaceful, primitive village is a
myth," said Gann. "Increased
industry can only have positive

effects on the native popula
tion. In the '30s, half the whites
in South Africa were classed as
'poor whites.' Now those
people have moved up into
white-collar jobs, and the
blacks and coloreds have their
jobs.
"South African blacks are the
best educated, most urbanized
blacks in Africa," said Gann.
"There are more extensive so
cial services there than any
where else."
"Much is made of the statis
tic that there are 450 political
prisoners in South Africa. But if
all but 450 prisoners were re
leased from Soviet work
camps, the world would con
sider it a miraculous step in the
cause of human rights."
Gann said that he is "not ter
ribly optimistic" about integra

tion in South Africa.
"We are dealing with three
completely separate groups:
the native Africans, the col
oreds of mixed descent, and
the whites," Gann said. "They
are three separate cultural enti
ties. each with their own food,
language and customs.
The most practical solution is
gradual change through in
creased social, economic and
educational opportunities for
blacks, according to Gann.
Gann said student advocates
of investment withdrawal "live
in a dream world. They don't
realize the very real gains that
blacks have made through
South Africa's prosperity.
"I dislike campus morality,"
he added. "It's easy to be
moral with someone else's
money."

Gann said that he is "not ter

the native Africans, the col

How should Americans react
to apartheid rule in South Af
rica? Nearly two years after the
protest demonstration in Old
Union, which resulted in 294
arrests, students still question
the morality of University in
vestment in South African cor
porations.
But increased trade with
South Africa is the most effec
tive way to break down the
"colorbar," according to Lewis
Gann and Peter Duignan, au
thors of South Africa: War, Re
volution or Peace?, published
last month by Hoover Institu
tion.
Duignan and Gann, both
senior fellows at Hoover, have
done extensive research on
South Africa. Duignan is direc
tor of African Studies and
curator of the African Collec
tion here. Gann earned a doc
torate in modern history at Ox
ford, and has studied and
worked in Rhodesia and Zam
bia.

"American policy is inconsis
tent with regard to South Af
rica," said Gann. "We believe
that open diplomatic, cultural
and economic relations with
Russia and China are the best
means of influencing these na
tions to treat their people
fairly."
Although divestment groups
assume that withdrawing
economic support may force
an end to apartheid, the white
regime could become oppres
sive in fear of violent uprising,
according to Gann.
In their book, the authors
advocate "using the carrot in
stead of the stick" to bring
about social justice.
"The United States should
use its diplomatic and com
mercial position to persuade,
not boycott or attack."
Gann stated that American
investments amount to only 18
percent of South Africa's total
investments, and as such,
American business is not in a
position to direct policy there.

" Armed revolution could
only bring about disaster,"
Gann said, referring to radical
measures to end apartheid.
Looking at other "free" African
nations, "the prospects for
democracy are not very good.
It's more likely that a revolu
tion would bring about tyranny
or chaos, as in Angola," he
explained.
Economic support, on the
other hand, will stimulate the
economy and open up more
job opportunities for blacks
and whites alike, according to
Gann.
Industrial racial discrimina
tion has already been lifted,
giving blacks who were for
merly unskilled laborers the
opportunity to work in indus
try. An expanding economy
would allow blacks into the
trade unions as well, Gann
said.
"The ideal of the happy,
peaceful, primitive village is a
myth," said Gann. "Increased
industry can only have positive

effects on the native popula
tion. In the '30s, half the whites
in South Africa were classed as
'poor whites.' Now those
people have moved up into
white-collar jobs, and the
blacks and coloreds have their

"South African blacks are the
