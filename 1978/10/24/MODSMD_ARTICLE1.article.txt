# Fire spreads in suburban L.A.

Los Angeles (AP) — At least 70 expensive homes were
destroyed yesterday as 100-foot-high flames pushed by
gale-force desert winds raced erratically across the
tinder-dry Santa Monica Mountains toward the sea.
Hundreds of other fashionable canyon and beach
homes were threatened and thousands of residents
were forced to evacuate as the siege of wild fire blac
kened more than 16,000 acres.
The largest blaze charred a 15,000-acre swath from
suburban Agoura 10 miles south across the chapparal
covered Santa Monicas to Malibu on the Pacific Ocean,
where it was expected to burn itself out.
The fires, which were burning out of control last night,
were reportedly caused when power lines were felled by
hot, dry Santa Ana winds. A spokesman for the Los
Angeles County fire department said the cause would be
investigated when the fires are out or nearly out.
The spokesman, Carol Esparza, said at least two per
sons received burn injuries in the fires. She said officials
have no estimate of the total financial loss.
One reporter counted at least 50 homes in flames or in
charred ruins as he drove along busy Pacific Coast
Highway north of Malibu.
"It's the worst thing that ever happened to me," said
architect Ronald Turner as he stood watching the
$285,000 five-bedroom beachfront house he built burn
to the ground. Turner's wife sat sobbing nearby.
Harried firefighters struggled frantically to keep up
with the swirling blaze as it leap-frogged from ridge to
ridge, rooftop to rooftop. But as darkness fell, it re
mained a losing battle and the towering flames could be

seen 30 miles away in downtown as they cast an eerie
redish-orange glow over the city.
Meanwhile, the second fire, about 15 miles away in
residential Mandeville Canyon near West Los Angeles,
destroyed at least seven homes by nightfall, officials
said.
The flames jumped fire lines and spread to neighbor
ing Sullivan Canyon as they made their way southwest
toward the exclusive Brentwood and Pacific Palisades
sections of the city.
"We're doing everything we can," said one firefigh
ter. "We're hoping to stop it at the backyards. If people
get stuck, it's going to be a panic situation."
More than 1000 residents of Mandeville Canyon,
where homes are valued at $200,000 and up, were or
dered to evacuate. Many packed their most valuable
belongings into cars, while others led goats and horses
to safety. This mass exodus down the area's narrow
canyon roads further hampered firefighters' desperate
efforts as they tried to rush equipment into the ar^a.
Two firefighting helicopters crashed in the Mandeville
blaze. There was no immediate word on whether any
one was injured in those incidents.
OThe hot, dry Santa Ana gusts — Southern California's
autumn menace — created dangerous "red flag" fire
conditions on the area's bush-covered hillsides and
numerous smaller fires were reported, including blazes
in suburban Chatsworth, Topanga Canyon, Glendale,
Sierra Madre, Hacienda Heights and Agua Dulce. But the
only damage in these blazes was to several rooftops in
the Topanga blaze.
