# 'Champagne of drugs' appeals to performers, students

Los Angeles (AP) — The party
swings. Beautiful people,
some as famous as their host,
flash toothpaste-ad smiles and
drop the names of their latest
films.
Soon the clink of ice in glas
ses melts away in a murmur of
anticipation.
The host, gold chains flash
ing around a razor-blade
necklace, demurely serves up
the evening's special treat on
an elegant silver tray.
A round of vintage wine,
perhaps?
Not quite. The goody at this
in-crowd gathering is a delicate
white powder laid out in neat
little rows. Cocaine.
Most popular
A powerful stimulant inhaled
or "snorted" through the
nose, cocaine is the most
popular drug of abuse in
America today, authorities say.
And nowhere is it more chic
than in the moneyed movie
and music colonies of Los
Angeles where this
champagne-priced drug is eas
ily affordable.
At $100 a gram, coke is one of
the most expensive drugs on
the street — about the same
price as heroin but more read
ily available and socially ac

ceptable.
Drug-watchers say today's
coke craze is reminiscent of
the fad which swept show bus
iness in the 1920s and 30s. Re
member the Cole Porter lyric:
"I get no kick from
cocaine . . ."?
In those days, actors on the
West Coast and jazz musicians
in the East discovered cocaine
could help them perform.
Similarly in 1978, there are
whispers that cocaine is affect
ing Hollywood's business de
cisions and creative perfor
mances.
Youth, affluent
Today's cocaine craze is not
limited to performers, how
ever. Authorities say the
glamorous Hollywood side of
coke use is prompting increas
ing interest among the young
and affluent everywhere.
First extracted from the coca
plant in 1880, cocaine smug
gled from South America is
now available and used in
every major metropolitan area
in California and the nation.
"Ten years ago, the only
place you'd find cocaine would
beat a heroin peddler'splace,"
recalled Capt. Billy Sanderson,
chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Administrative

Narcotics Division. "Now,
cocaine is everywhere . . .
Drugs have left the ghetto and
gone into the suburbs."
Fashionable
Police Sgt. Ted Oglesby,
who lectures students about
drugs, says cocaine has be
come so fashionable "it's like
wearing jeans and boots."
What is this high-priced
"high" that so enchants the
upper classes?
"Cocaine," says a DEA pam
phlet, "is the strongest stimul
ant of natural origin."
"Cocaine," says a surgeon,
"is a local anesthetic. It's only
defensible use is in surgery."
"Cocaine," says a former
user, "is the sex drug. I always
used it as an aphrodisiac."
The late movie idol Errol
Flynn boasted of applying
cocaine to his genitals for
stimulation — an effect which
most users say is more
psychological than physical.
"It enhances whatever you
want it to enhance," says one
user.
Creeping stimulant
"Cocaine is an upper, a
powerful stimulant," says a
woman who has ex
periemented with it. "But it's
more subtle than am

phetamines. It's a creeping
kind of stimulant."
Those who sniff coke at par
ties say the drug, absorbed
through the mucous mem
brane lining ot the nose, pro
duces euphoria and a sense of
well-being. It elevates the
pulse and blood pressure, and,
as a result, users say, "It makes
you dance faster, talk faster."
But behind the too-loud
laughter and dancing feet
there is a darker side to coke
use.
Cocaine can cause nervous
ness, irratibility and paranoia.
The heavy user may have hal -
lucinations that bugs are crawl
ing under his skin. Some have
torn themselves bloody trying
to extract the bugs.
Nasal damage
Because cocaine is inhaled,
the heavy user can suffer seri
ous nasal damage. In some
cases, holes have been burned
through the septum which
separates the two nostrils.
"I've seen some terribly
damaged cocaine noses," says
a plastic surgeon who has re
constructed some. "There's
not a awful lot that can be done
for them . . . Usually, I can
close up the hole by inserting a
button orplug made of Silastic,

a form of silicone."
Until recently, even the ex
perts believed coke was a non
lethal drug. However, in a re
cent study, the National Insti
tute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
concluded that "accidental
deaths due to cocaine, while
uncommon, do occur."
Deaths
NIDA said it found two
deaths attributable to coke
snorting but in most
documented cases, death
came from injecting cocaine
intravenously. Some coke
smugglers have died after swal
lowing plastic bags of cocaine
which exploded in their
stomachs. But ironically, these
deaths are more a result of law
enforcement's recent cocaine
crackdown than the drug itself.
Coke smuggling with its
enormous profits is definitely a
growing industry. And Sgt. Og
lesby gloomily predicts the
cocaine craze will continue to
soar unless users admit the
drug creates psychological de
pendence close to addiction.
"I've seen so many people
who are really hung up on
coke," said Oglesby.
"When I was dealing
cocaine, entertainers and col
lege students were my best

customers," says Rafael Es
pinosa.
"I used cocaine with my
friends. It was just a constant
masquerade. We'd sit around
and socialize and tell lies," he
remembers. "We had opinions
on everything. I thought I was a
politician. It was a very status
type thing."
Later, Rafael used cocaine
"because I didn't want to get
too strung out on heroin."
That was three years ago.
Now, Rafael is "clean." He and
other former addicts spoke of
cocaine's subtle power at the
Inter-Agency Task Force for
Drug Abuse and Related Prob
lems (lADARP), where they
work at helping other addicts
kick drugs.
Cocaine, they insist, is a
dangerous drug.

"I call cocaine users ad
dicts," says Feldsher, the
treatment director.
"The physical withdrawal
from cocaine certainly isn't
what the heroin addict has to
go through," says Feldsher.
"But the psychological trip is
devastating.
Jay Cavanaugh, executive di
rector of lADARP, gets occa
sional calls for help from
cocaine users.
Most "cokeheads," says
Cavanaugh, can't believe they
have a cocaine problem be
cause the drug is reputed to be
non-addictive.
"I tell them drugs are addict
ing; people are addicting,"
says Cavanaugh. "If someone
has an addictable personality,
they can get hooked on snif
fing sweat socks."
