# Big-time dope smugglers taking the 'road to Rio'

Los Angeles (AP) — He was 15, a native of Chile
with the face of a dark angel.
He peered from side to side as he stepped oft
the plane from South America and, as he had
done easily so many times before, he began to
pass quietly through customs.
But something was wrong. The U.S. Customs
officer, rather than waving him through, began
an intensive search of the boy's luggage.
No one would say later what had tipped off
the agent — the fact he was traveling alone or
the 400 visa stamps on his passport.
False bottom
In the boy's suitcase the customs agent found
a false bottom. Inside the false bottom was 2Vt
pounds of cocaine.
It would have sold on the street of Los Angeles
for $700,000.
The teen-ager was the youngest smuggler
ever arrested here. But he was only one of a
growing army of couriers or "mules" of all ages
and walks of life who shuttle between conti
nents daily delivering the most desired drug of
the day — coke.
Between June 1977 and July 1978, the U.S.
Customs Service reported 86 seizures of cocaine
at Los Angeles International Airport — a haul of
>11.5 pounds worth $78 million. Los Angeles and
Miami are the country's two main ports of entry
for coke smuggling.
Seizures increase
The Los Angeles Police Department, which
oversees domestic flights, seized 124.78 pounds

of cocaine in 1977. So far, this year's seizures
have zoomed by 142 percent.
But authorities concede they stop only a frac
tion of the coke being smuggled every day to a
growing market of consumers. With the drug
selling for nearly $3,000 an ounce, it is a multi
million-dollar - a-year business, definitely a
growth industry.
"For an investment of $10,000 and an airplane
ticket, you can buy a kilo of cocaine in South
America, bring it back here, cut it and sell it for
$2 million,"says Jerry Jensen, West Coast Reg
ional Director of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
Appeals to elite
Paul Rimmer, the senior customs inspector
here, says the cocaine trade tempts a better class
of smuggler because the drug appeals to the
elite.
Rise explained
Jensen explains the remarkable rise in cocaine
smuggling: "Going back to 1971, we virtually
dried up heroin in the United Sates with the
elimination of the so-called French Connec
tion, ' he says, adding that the Turkish govern
ment was given subsidies to halt poppy cultiva
tion.
j "... that's when the traffickers moved to
South America," Jensen says. "These people
| didn't have heroin available. So they started
shipping cocaine up through the same pipeline.
i The organizations that were handling heroin
I began handling cocaine."
