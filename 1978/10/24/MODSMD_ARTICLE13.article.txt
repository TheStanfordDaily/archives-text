## Scott Richter Liberals also dogmatic 
### 
Fred Grethel's column,
"Right wing uses symbol sys
tem," (Daily, Oct. 18) struck
me as unpersuasive, at best. In
making his case against the
conservatives, he resorts to the
same tactic of which he ac
cuses them. Irony of ironies,
he insists on using such evoca
tive left-wing symbols as,
"reactionaries," and "de
magogues," throughout in re
ferring to his opponents. A lit
tle scrutiny will show that
Grethel's thesis in the column
rests on a vast and unsup
ported generalization.
Grethel's idea seems to be
not only that the conservatives
support the wrong policies (at
tempt, "to quell progressive
gains"), but that there is no ra
tional basis whatsoever 'or
their opinions. He asserts that
they see the world strictly in
terms of right and wrong —
"black and white," as he says.
He implies that their use of
symbols replaces any rational
investigation of the issues in
volved.
Well I would like to assure
Grethel that the difficult issues
look like as much grey fog to
most conservatives as they do
to most liberals, and that there
are at least as many dogmatic
libe.als as there are dogmatic
conservatives. Just because the
conservatives arrive at diffe
rent conclusions than Grethel
does when they cut through
the fog doesn't mean that their
conclusions are completely
ill-founded. Grethel himself
has substituted name-calling
for analysis, so perhaps we
should look at a few of the is
sues that he does mention in
passing:
—Abortion rights. There is
no question that the conserva
tives may be right when they
claim that a fetus is a human
being with a right to life. With
out going into the usual biol
ogy lesson, I will only note that
I have seen lately an adver
tisement in the Daily for a wo
men's abortion support group
— to help women deal with this
"traumatic time." An abortion
is a relatively simple operation.
If it is an operation that really
only affects the woman's body,
why these support groups?
There must be some doubt
about who is right.
—Affirmative action. Is it not
reasonable that one who has
worked hard to advance in a
career should be outraged
when another receives favor
over him or her simply because
of the other's race or sex? Af
firmative action was supposed
to remedy such a problem, but
now, as it moves steadily to
ward a quota system, it causes
more such problems than it

prevents. A totally color-blind
meritocracy is starting to look
like a much better idea.
Grethel should note a current
suit against the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission itself by one of its
employees that seems to point
in this direction.
—Tax reduction. It is easy to
understand why people are
coming to believe that they
know how to spend their
hard-earned money better
than the government does.
Waste in government
abounds, especially in the
military. Moreover, the ser
vices we get from our govern
ment almost always compare
poorly with what we get from
the typical private business.
George Noroian's complaint
about the service at our own
post office (same issue of the
Daily) demonstrates this.
Finally, can Grethel so
wholeheartedly dispute the
value of tax cuts generally,
when most economists still
agree that the famous Kennedy
tax cut of the early '60s made us
all so much better off?
Obviously, there are many
more issues to be dealt with,
and these short sketches are
not meant to be full analyses,
but only suggestions that there
are certainly two rational sides
to almost all of the questions.
Su rely the conservatives have a
right to voice their opinions.
Just as surely, the liberals
ought to deal with the issues,
too, with more than just
name-calling.
Just as the conservatives use
symbols, so do the liberals.
Look to Grethel's article for
more evidence: When he re
fers to those "progressive
gains," he implicitly means
"desirable changes," and he
uses the term to modify any
thing the liberals do. He im
plicitly talks about discrimina
tion, also, actually meaning
anything that is not in the in
terest of a particular minority
group, whether it is just or not.
So both sides use symbols.
This does not refute Grethel's
accusation, but does suggest
that his argument fails to take
us very far toward resolution of
the hard questions.
Grethel's final assertion that
a "reactionary vanguard" is
leading a "campaign of hatred"
does us little good at all in any
rational evaluation of the is
sues. In fact, much of what he
says is misleading. I can hardly
believe that the fundamentalist
congregations of which he
speaks pose a very great
danger. Their membership lists
couldn't be longer than the
subscription list of Newsweek

magazine, which was reported
in 1976 to have sold its list to
leading liberal candidates. In
addition, his point that Briggs
and larvis use the same ad
agency should excite no one.
Howard Jarvis, along with
Ronald Reagan — a conserva
tive of some note — opposes
the Briggs initiative.
A more rational theory than
Grethel's "reactionary van
guard" idea is that people have
finally become fed up with the
liberal answers to the hard
problems, and are ready to try
the conservative approach.
Grethel can't deny them this al
ternative.
