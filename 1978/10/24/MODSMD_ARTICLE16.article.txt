## Proposition 6 attack on teachers 
### 
Proposition 6, the Briggs Initiative, would au
thorize local school boards to fire teachers who
openly practice or advocate homosexual behavior.
This would mean that any homosexual teacher could
be fired if the board became aware of his or her sexual
activity. A vindictive board might even use the initia
tive to justify eliminating teachers who supported a
homosexual colleague's right to freedom of sexual
choice.
Opponents of this proposal have rightly pointed
out that it is another in a recent series of attempts to
deprive homosexuals of their rights. Less often dis
cussed is that Proposition 6 is also an attack on the
rights of another traditionally restricted group â€”
teachers.
Throughout the history of education, school
teachers have been constrained in ways which seem
laughable today. During the 19205, for example,
female teachers were forced to sign contracts in
which they agreed under pain of dismissal not to dye
their hair, dress in bright colors, drink beer, show
their ankles in public, loiter in ice cream parlors, stay
out after 8 p.m. or keep company with men. Above
all, they were strictly forbidden to marry, although
given the terms of the rest of their contract, this rule
may have been superfluous.

Closer to our own times, and therefore less laugh
able, has been a series of attempts to limit the politi
cal freedom of teachers. During the last 30 years,
teachers have been deprived of their livelihood for
being communists, associating with communists, re
fusing to sign loyalty oaths and refusing to recite the
Pledge of Allegiance.
These and literally hundreds of other laws and re
strictions regulating the conduct of teachers both in
and out of the classroom all have been based on the
same argument which serves today as the justification
for Proposition 6. The two basic premises of this ar
gument are 1) that the state has what Proposition 6
calis a "duty to protect its impressionable youth,"
and 2) that students tend to emulate the behavior of
their teachers. From these premises it is concluded
that teachers must not be allowed to behave in ways
which society views as undesirable.
While the goal of protecting young people from
socially undesirable behavior undoubtedly seems
laudable to many people, it is clear that this argument
can never provide sufficient justification for depriv
ing teachers of the basic rights which other people
enjoy. For one thing, the argument's second premise
is extremely dubious. Rarely do students adopt the
mode of dress or the political beliefs of teachers,

even those who are particularly admired. In the case
of sexual preference, it is extremely unlikely that any
student would ever become a homosexual because a
teacher was one.
Furthermore, the notion of what society views as
undesirable is so vague that it can be used (as indeed
it has been) to proscribe almost any conceivable be
havior. Quite often, it is impossible for any group of
people to agree on what is socially undesirable. (For
example, while many people consider homosexuality
to fit into this category, I and many others do not.) At
best, socially undesirable behavior is a relative con
cept which varies from community to community and
year to year, changing as quickly as the public whim.
No occupational group, teachers included, can pos
sibly be expected to keep up with this whim.
Finally, it is important to note that even if a great
majority of individuals could agree that a particular
behavior was socially undesirable, there would still
not be sufficient justification for denying teachers the
freedom to which everyone is entitled. Rights are
much more important than social convention. The
preservation of such basic personal rights as freedom
of speech and freedom of sexual preference is a so
cial goal of much greater significance than the desire
to insure a uniform standard of behavior or taste
could ever be.
To be sure, there are times when those in a given
occupation justifiably may be required to forego cer
tain freedoms. However, this can be so only in cases
where the restrictions relate directly to the satisfac
tory performance of their jobs or to the rights of
others. Policemerv, for example, may be required to
wear uniforms because their effectiveness requires
that their authority be easily recognizable. Food
handlers may be required to have clean hands be
cause consumers have the right to food which is as
free as possible from dirt and germs. However, sexual
preference has not and cannot be shown to have an
analogous relationship either to the demands of
teaching or to the rights of students.
I therefore conclude that we must reject Proposi
tion 6 and all future attempts to impose unjustified
standards of personal behavior on teachers. But,
what will be the result of the rejection of Proposition
6?
Because in the past homosexuals have usually kept
their sexual preferences hidden, we can only conjec
ture about the results of having teachers who are
openly homosexual. However, I would suggest that
for many students, being exposed to teachers with
varying opinions, tastes and sexual preferences
could be a valuable experience. The lesson that any
one with the required training and skills can be a
teacher regardless of the popularity of his or her life
style might be an important step toward eliminating
in the next generation the fear and intolerance which
leads people to create and support such measures as
Proposition 6.
