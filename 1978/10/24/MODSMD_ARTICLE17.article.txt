## Repercussions of Bakke case 
### 
One of the fears about the US Supreme Court's
fence-straddling decision in the Bakke case was
that it would allow never-committed and faint
hearted institutions to retreat from already poor
performances in enrolling and employing
minorities. Thus, the Medical School's dissolution
of its Minority Admissions Committee last month
came as no surprise. (Some institutions, like UC
San Francisco, have continued their minority ad
missions committees, and are to be commended.)
This is also no surprise because of the composi
tion of the committee (SCAP) that was appoi nted to
make recommendations about minority admis
sions. The attitude of the Belgian-born chairman of
SCAP about black people is known to many black
workers at the Palo Alto VA Hospital; and the differ
ing views about admissions that exist between Jews
and racial minorities are festering problems that
must be intelligently and forth rightly addressed.
It can be argued that it is not the presence or
absence of a minority admissions committee that is
important, but what the future enrollment pattern
of minorities will be. Of course, this does remain to
be seen, but on the basis of my experience in other
areas at Stanford, I predict a bleak and almost color
less student body at the Stanford Medical School
within a few years. Committees and offices for
mally established for particular purposes are often
important.
For example, since the University's premature

closing of the Office of the Assistant to the Presi
dent for Black Affairs in 1975, there has been no real
progress in the employment and advancement of
blacks in exempt positions within the University.
On the other hand, the University established and
has maintained, a Committee on Education and
Employment of Women and their numbers in
exempt positions and enrollment have steadily
grown.
Of equal concern is the fact that the black young
lady that has staffed the now-dissolved Minority
Admissions Committee has been unceremoniously
told that she no longer has a job at Stanford, effec
tive October 13, 1978, after having satisfactorily
worked with that committee for five years.
The least that could have been done would have
been to assign her to a comparable position in the
Admissions Office. This also means that within the
last year, at least two black administrators in very
important positions in the Medical Center have
been told that they are no longer wanted or needed
there.
In summary, what is troubling is that the dissolu
tion of the Minority Admissions Committee in the
Medical School could very well signal other prob
lems racial minorities are going to be experiencing
in the Medical Center and other parts of the Uni
versity.
