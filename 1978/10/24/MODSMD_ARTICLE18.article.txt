## Don't support campaign to return Indians' 
### 
A few feather-brained alumni seem
not to have realized that the "Indian" is
no longer the Stanford mascot. And un
fortunately neither these well-meaning
but misguided fans nor the thousands
of Stanford students who have unwit
tingly participated in their not-so
subtle campaign are in any sense aware
of the sensitive ethical and political is
sues involved in the decision to discard
the "Indian" imagery.
The renowned, finely-honed critical
faculties of the Stanford student body
— ultimately, perhaps the only tradi
tion of lasting value associated with this
educational institution — are obviously
not being employed on Saturday after
noons. This is hardly surprising or inex
cusable — football games do, after all,
bring us some respite and release from
the tensions of concentrated scholar
ship.
Nonetheless, I suggest that those
who thoughtlessly don feathers are
being duped into implicitly supporting
a campaign with hidden but distinct
political overtones. Those overtones
are in fact reactionary — so reactionary
that even our somewhat stodgy ad
ministration considers them vulgar and
backward. The mythology of the Hol
lywood "Indian" inevitably leads to the
perpetuation of historical falsehood
and continued oppression of living,
struggling native American cultures
and individuals.
The covertly or unconsciously racist
misrepresentation involved with "In

dian" imagery is diametrically opposed
to the spirit and purpose of an educa
tional institution. For these reasons,
thoughtful, informed Stanford stu
dents will want to disassociate them
selves from this movement for the re
surrection of an ex-tradition which was
wisely and properly laid to rest.
I address the following arguments to
those open-minded enough to read
them twice.
First, the close relationship between
the Hollywood myth upon which white
masqueraders invariably pattern them
selves, and the historical lies that serve
to legitimate physical and cultural as
saults against Indians, is indisputable.
Virtually the only aspect of native
American culture dealt with the history
of film and of mainstream historical
scholarship has been its physical rela
tionship to white culture—that is as a
cause of violent conflict which posed a
danger to the successful completion of
the "Westward Movement."
As the story goes, the murderous
heathens slaughtered thousands of
whites for the fiendish fun of it, in ac
cordance with their barbarous natures.
The truth is that Indian warfare prior to
the coming of the white man was con
ducted within rigid, prescribed social
limits. Most Indian warfare, of course,
was simply an attempt to prevent the
rape and destruction of their culture
and their persons by the hydra-headed
monster of white expansionism.
Yet because white culture is totally
ignorant of the ways and wisdom of na

tive Americans, except as military foes,
the "Indian" is known to us only as a
fierce, cunning warrior — in less posi
tive but no less common terms, a drun
ken, conniving, cannibalistic savage.
While Stanford fans would surely
employ the softer set of adjectives for
their symbolic figure, this does not con
tradict the fact that these warlike qual
ities are the only ones we associate with
"Indians" and therefore undoubtedly
those for which the "Indian" nickname
was chosen.
Moreover, even if these qualities
might be considered positive in the
context of sport their stereotypical na
ture necessarily does a disservice to his
torical truth. Incidentally, the Hol
lywood Indian who lives in a teepee,
beats on a drum, and rides around on
an appaloosa scalping white people
was never, ever representative of In
dians; and, more directly relevant,
most native Americans even in the days
of Ceronimo had never seen a head
band or a feathered warbonnet, much
less worn one. Institutions of higher
education are supposed to dispel such
outrageously inaccurate myths — not
enshrine them.
Perhaps the feathered fogie of the
tailgater set know that the "Indian" of
popular lore is a myth; but their likely
reply would be, "so what?" Beneath the
"what's the harm?" defense, however,
lies more fallacious and dangerous Hol
lywood mythology.
The lack of concern for Indian sen
sibilities and public relations evinced

in such a stance stems from an uncon
scious assumption that the Indians no
longer exist — that they are a vestige of
a bygone era, the "Old West." Al
though we might find the concept of
the "Vanished Indian" a useful device
for covering over and forgetting the
spottier chapters of American history,
the fact remains that the American In
dians are still fighting fora foothold in a
country that once belonged to them.
Their efforts to finally attain justice —
not to mention make a living — are con
tinually hampered by the distorted,
oversimplified, usually insulting and
always farcical depiction of "Indians."
The reduction of numerous sophisti
cated American cultures to a single
one-dimensional portrait is also a per
sonal insult to Indians as individual en
tities. Can you imagine the "Stanford
blacks," "Stanford Anglo-Saxons" or
the "Stanford Jews?"
This practice of whites masquerading
as Indian warriors with feathers is about
as ludicrous, inconsiderate and just
plain assinine as calling our gridiron
stars the "Auschwitz Eleven" and print
ing their numbers on their skin instead
of jerseys. The abomination of mass
genocide, as well as the attempted
eradication of their rich cultural tradi
tion, is no laughing matter to the Jews;
for precisely the same reasons, the his
torical and cultural identity of native
Americans has no place in the "fun and
games" arena of sport.
