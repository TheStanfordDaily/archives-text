# Hookers have a ball in Cow Palace extravaganza
## 
### 
It's no longer a small affair in
the City attended predomi
nately by hookers and gays. No
sir. The Hooker's Ball is now an
event for 15,000 people,
polyester-suited businessmen
among them. It's still a lot of
fun though and one of the few
truly San Franciscan things you
can't find in Detroit or
Pittsburgh these days.
The Cow Palace in Daly City
hosted the fourth annual
Hooker's Ball last Friday night.
Margo St. James, who 12 years
ago gave up walking the streets
of San Francisco and now runs
The Victoria Woodhill Founda
tion (named for the 19th
century feminist who ran for
president), kicked off the ball
by entering on the back of an
elephant. St. James founded a
prostitutes' rights foundation,
formerly called COYOTE (Call
Off Your Old Tired Ethics), five
years ago.
But St. James and the
elephant were not all that
noticeable in a crowd which
included the Stanford Band,
there despite the administra

tion's wishes and whose deca
dence at an event like this is
imaginable to followers of the
Incomparables, as well as
many of San Francisco's most
imaginative masqueraders.
Fig leafs, pasties, leather and
chains, Darth Vader costumes,
dresses and anything else im
aginable adorned those who
realized the ball was intended
as a masquerade ball (as the
Cow Palace's marquee taste
fully referred to it in lieu of the
unimaginable reference of
"Hooker's Ball").
The ball had an almost frat
party-like atmosphere with a
predictable preponderance of
males — the dresses not
withstanding— and much mil
ling around the arena's floor
with drinks in hand. The bands
played almost continu
ally except during the costume
contest award presentation,
the exceedingly boring
monologues during the breaks
between bands and the shor
test George Carlin act ever —
five minutes at most.
Carlin managed to get the at

tention of the crowd for the
first time all night with a varia
tion of his now famous "seven
dirty words" routine. The
theme delighted the audience
which, by 1 a.m., had little
cognizance of time or, in some
cases, its own consciousness.
The ball was marred by sev
eral arrests which are predicta
bleat an event such as this one.
Two stabbings sent victims to
the hospital. But aside from
that, and unless you were one
of those who decided to pass
out on the floor for a few mi
nutes for any one of a number
of reasons, most in attendance
seemed to enjoy themselves.
But even if it was not all one
imagined, it is still something
to say you went to. Your-pa
rents will gasp and your friends
in Detroit or Pittsburgh will
simply not understand why
there are hookers and why
they have a ball and what it is
and why in the world you
would go there and why
everyone around San Fran
cisco is as crazy as Charlie
Manson. But who expects
them to understand anyway.

he less the better was the theme for many Hooker's Ball goers.


Only the watch gave this costumed party goer away as someone out
of the ordinary.
