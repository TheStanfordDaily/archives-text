# Police crackdown on game booze smuggling
## 
### ANNE BOWDEN 
"The students use their imagina
tion and we use ours," University
Police Sgt. Tom Berubee said, de
scribing attempts here to smuggle
beer into the stadium during football
games.
"It's sort of like a game," Berubee
said. The only difference is that
"we've been playing for 15 years and
have more experience in finding the
beer, than they have in hiding it."
This year, for the first time, al
cohol, cans, bottles and containers
larger than one quart areprohibited
in the stadium.
Berubee said the security person
nel has been increased for special
events, including football, but this
was just part of an "overall security
remodification program."
The stadium always has been pat
rolled the night before game day to
prevent vandalism, Berubee said.

This year, the patrol is also "aware of
students, who enter the stadium to
hide beer for the next day.
"They're usually not too discreet,"
Berubee said, noting that patrols
usually find a few kegs in every pre
game search.
Beer has been hidden in bushes,
stuck behind bleachers and buried in
the ground, he said.
Smuggling tips
Students are reluctant to give away
smuggling secrets, but one admitted
"burying.a keg in a garbage can, but
then it gets warm" or hiding six
packs in the corners of the stadium
wall.
One student said he heard of a
group which brought a keg into the
stadium on the carrier rack of an
electric wheelchair. Others said they
have brought beer in soft-drink
boxes, similar to those used by
stadium vendors.

Another group said it would have
flown in beer by helicopter, "but we
couldn't afford it."
This year, guards at the gate search
students' backpacks. According to
Ron Young, assistant athletic direc
tor, "If they don't open their packs,
we can't let them in." He said most
students, including the Band, have
been cooperative.
The gate guards confiscate beer
they find, but allow students to claim
their liquor after the game. "We
realize that basically, it's a hot day
and they're thirsty," Berubee said.
Size conflict
"We really don't have any particu
lar problems,"Young added, point
ing out that the conflicts between
guards and fans occur over the size
of container allowed inside.
If guards notice beer in the
stadium during a game, they confis

cate it, "but we won't stir up a brawl
or anything to get it," Young
explained.
Soft drinks are sold in cans at the
stadium games because of a con
tract made before the new ruling
took effect. When this agreement
expires in January, Young said, acon
tract for drinks in paper cups will be
arranged.
He said he saw "no sign of a rever
sal" or a repeal of the alcohol and
drink container ban.
