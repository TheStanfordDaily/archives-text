### 
A Month In The Country is a tapestry
woven from appearances. It is a world
where no one can express his true feel
ings. The play, written by Ivan Turgenev, is
a subtle social criticism of the rigid mid
19th century Russian class society. It is
based on Turgenev's own triangular love
affair which lasted for 40 years. Russian
censorship found it so shocking that it was
not produced until 1875, a quarter of a
century after it was written.
The play takes place on the country es
tate of Vslaev, a rich landowner, a hard
working man and simpleton who is com
pletely unaware of the complexity of his
wife's needs and desires.
Natalya, Yslaev's wife, is terribly bored
in this provincial and pretentious world
where everyone tries to speak French and
appear cultured with varying degrees of
success. Says Natalya, "We are all dull and
sensible people."
Natalya is courted by Yslaev's close
friend Rakitin who is, unfortunately for
Natalya, completely harmless.
Natalya plays with Rakitin as if he were a
toy and all he can do is to hang on her
every word oblivious to the torture she
puts him through. He even seems to find
bliss in this.
Stalemate
The lives of everyone in the Yslaev
household are at a stalemate but all that is
changed with the arrival of Beliayev, a
young tutor from Moscow. He brings a
breath of fresh air to the world of Natalya's
stratagems. There is not a shred of pre
tensein him. Both Natalyaand herteenage
ward, the innocent and lonely Vera fall in
love very quickly.

Beliayev treats Vera like a sister and is
naturally drawn to the older and more
sophisticated Natalya.
For the first time in her life Natalya is in
love and feels an intense jealousy for Vera
who is not even aware of her feelings for
the tutor.
When Vera asks Natalya, "Didn't you
marry for love?" Natalya realizes that she
has never loved anyone in her life, that she
has missed her chance. There is no turning
back. Vera is awaiting the same fate; her
marriage to a bumbling and pitiful
neighbor is being arranged by the
freewheeling Beliayev who is quick to
point out that a woman will be able to do
with Doctor Shpigelsky as she likes.
When Beliayev discovers Natalya's love
he realizes how hopeless his situation has
become.
To save Natalya's face, Rakitin admits his
love to the now suspicious husband who is
prodded into action by his mother. He
leaves the household followed by the
young tutor.
Flawed
A serious flaw of the American Conser
vatory Theater production is that it over
looks the social barriers that are so impor
tant to make the play work. It is hard to
believe that we are in 19th century Russia
inspite of the birch trees and period cos
tumes.
Forexample, itis hard to understand the
doctor's resentment and his feelings of in
feriority to "society faces."
"Every time you see their eyes writing
the word 'peasant' flat across your phiz
. . . and just because they drench them
selves in Eau-de Cologne and drawl every

syllable as if they were dropping it acci
dentally foryou to pick up, they think you
can't trip them up by the heels," says the
doctor.
There are some good performances by
Peter Donat as the philosophising Rakitin
and Elizabeth Huddle who moves easily in
the complex mercurial character of
Natalya. There is a very humorous portrait
of the doctor by Raye Birk.
Laird'Williamson, a director with an in
ventive eye for detail takes full advantage
of the courtship of the dull spinster
Lizavetta by the pragmatic doctor who
marries because he is getting old and his
cook is robbing him.
Acting uneven
Unfortunately the acting is uneven.
Heidi Helen Davis is dull in the key charac
ter of Vera. It is hard to believe that she is a
young woman driven by a new passion, as
she shrills at Natalya. The tutor Beliayev
played by Thomas Oglesby is much too old
and self-assured.
All characters inA Month In The Country
have more or less violent passions but are
inhibited from expressing them. They lack
the necessary strength of character. They
compromise.
Unless there is a radical change in soci
ety, Turgenev seems to be saying, com
promises are the only solutions.
A hundred years of Russian drama
should have made it clear to us by now that
there is nothing left for us to do except to
live a life of quiet despair.
A Month In The Country performs as one
of five plays in repertory at the A.C.T. in
San Francisco through December. For tic

Kakitin (Peter Donat) loves Natalya (Elizabeth Huddle), but it's a one-sided passion in Turgenev's lyrical
Russian classic, A Month In The Country, which joined the American Conservatory Theater's repertory
Oct. 17 at the Geary. The production is directed by Laird Williamson.

friend Rakitin who is, unfortunately for
Natalya, completely harmless.
Natalya plays with Rakitin as if he were a
toy and all he can do is to hang on her
every word oblivious to the torture she
puts him through. He even seems to find
bliss in this.
Stalemate
The lives of everyone in the Yslaev
household are at a stalemate but all that is
changed with the arrival of Beliayev, a
young tutor from Moscow. He brings a
breath of fresh air to the world of Natalya's
stratagems. There is not a shred of pre
tensein him. Both Natalyaand herteenage
ward, the innocent and lonely Vera fall in
love very quickly.

Beliayev treats Vera like a sister and is
naturally drawn to the older and more
sophisticated Natalya.
For the first time in her life Natalya is in
love and feels an intense jealousy for Vera
who is not even aware of her feelings for
the tutor.
When Vera asks Natalya, "Didn't you
marry for love?" Natalya realizes that she
has never loved anyone in her life, that she
has missed her chance. There is no turning
back. Vera is awaiting the same fate; her
marriage to a bumbling and pitiful
neighbor is being arranged by the
freewheeling Beliayev who is quick to
point out that a woman will be able to do
with Doctor Shpigelsky as she likes.
When Beliayev discovers Natalya's love
he realizes how hopeless his situation has
become.
To save Natalya's face, Rakitin admits his
love to the now suspicious husband who is
prodded into action by his mother. He
leaves the household followed by the
young tutor.
Flawed
A serious flaw of the American Conser
vatory Theater production is that it over
looks the social barriers that are so impor
tant to make the play work. It is hard to
believe that we are in 19th century Russia
inspite of the birch trees and period cos
tumes.
Forexample, itis hard to understand the
doctor's resentment and his feelings of in
feriority to "society faces."
"Every time you see their eyes writing
the word 'peasant' flat across your phiz
. . . and just because they drench them
selves in Eau-de Cologne and drawl every

syllable as if they were dropping it acci
dentally foryou to pick up, they think you
can't trip them up by the heels," says the
doctor.
There are some good performances by
Peter Donat as the philosophising Rakitin
and Elizabeth Huddle who moves easily in
the complex mercurial character of
Natalya. There is a very humorous portrait
of the doctor by Raye Birk.
Laird'Williamson, a director with an in
ventive eye for detail takes full advantage
of the courtship of the dull spinster
Lizavetta by the pragmatic doctor who
marries because he is getting old and his
cook is robbing him.
Acting uneven
Unfortunately the acting is uneven.
Heidi Helen Davis is dull in the key charac
ter of Vera. It is hard to believe that she is a
young woman driven by a new passion, as
she shrills at Natalya. The tutor Beliayev
played by Thomas Oglesby is much too old
and self-assured.
All characters inA Month In The Country
have more or less violent passions but are
inhibited from expressing them. They lack
the necessary strength of character. They
compromise.
Unless there is a radical change in soci
ety, Turgenev seems to be saying, com
promises are the only solutions.
A hundred years of Russian drama
should have made it clear to us by now that
there is nothing left for us to do except to
live a life of quiet despair.

Kakitin (Peter Donat) loves Natalya (Elizabeth Huddle), but it's a one-sided passion in Turgenev's lyrical
Russian classic, A Month In The Country, which joined the American Conservatory Theater's repertory
Oct. 17 at the Geary. The production is directed by Laird Williamson.
A Month In The Country is a tapestry
woven from appearances. It is a world
where no one can express his true feel
ings. The play, written by Ivan Turgenev, is
a subtle social criticism of the rigid mid
19th century Russian class society. It is
based on Turgenev's own triangular love
affair which lasted for 40 years. Russian
censorship found it so shocking that it was
not produced until 1875, a quarter of a
century after it was written.
The play takes place on the country es
tate of Vslaev, a rich landowner, a hard
working man and simpleton who is com
pletely unaware of the complexity of his
wife's needs and desires.
Natalya, Yslaev's wife, is terribly bored
in this provincial and pretentious world
where everyone tries to speak French and
appear cultured with varying degrees of
success. Says Natalya, "We are all dull and
sensible people."

has never loved anyone in her life, that she
has missed her chance. There is no turning
back. Vera is awaiting the same fate; her
marriage to a bumbling and pitiful
neighbor is being arranged by the
freewheeling Beliayev who is quick to
point out that a woman will be able to do
with Doctor Shpigelsky as she likes.
When Beliayev discovers Natalya's love
he realizes how hopeless his situation has
become.
To save Natalya's face, Rakitin admits his
love to the now suspicious husband who is
prodded into action by his mother. He
leaves the household followed by the
young tutor.
Flawed
A serious flaw of the American Conser
vatory Theater production is that it over
looks the social barriers that are so impor
tant to make the play work. It is hard to
believe that we are in 19th century Russia
inspite of the birch trees and period cos
tumes.
Forexample, itis hard to understand the
doctor's resentment and his feelings of in
feriority to "society faces."
"Every time you see their eyes writing
the word 'peasant' flat across your phiz
. . . and just because they drench them
selves in Eau-de Cologne and drawl every

syllable as if they were dropping it acci
dentally foryou to pick up, they think you
can't trip them up by the heels," says the
doctor.
There are some good performances by
Peter Donat as the philosophising Rakitin
and Elizabeth Huddle who moves easily in
the complex mercurial character of
Natalya. There is a very humorous portrait
of the doctor by Raye Birk.
Laird'Williamson, a director with an in
ventive eye for detail takes full advantage
of the courtship of the dull spinster
Lizavetta by the pragmatic doctor who
marries because he is getting old and his
cook is robbing him.
Acting uneven
Unfortunately the acting is uneven.
Heidi Helen Davis is dull in the key charac
ter of Vera. It is hard to believe that she is a
young woman driven by a new passion, as
she shrills at Natalya. The tutor Beliayev
played by Thomas Oglesby is much too old
and self-assured.
All characters inA Month In The Country
have more or less violent passions but are
inhibited from expressing them. They lack
the necessary strength of character. They
compromise.
Unless there is a radical change in soci
ety, Turgenev seems to be saying, com
promises are the only solutions.
A hundred years of Russian drama
should have made it clear to us by now that
there is nothing left for us to do except to
live a life of quiet despair.
A Month In The Country performs as one
of five plays in repertory at the A.C.T. in
San Francisco through December. For tic

Kakitin (Peter Donat) loves Natalya (Elizabeth Huddle), but it's a one-sided passion in Turgenev's lyrical
Russian classic, A Month In The Country, which joined the American Conservatory Theater's repertory
Oct. 17 at the Geary. The production is directed by Laird Williamson.
