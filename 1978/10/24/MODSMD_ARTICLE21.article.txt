## Kottke mesmerizes-without flash 
### 
Leo Kottke's audiences are
very well-mannered for the
most part. They listen intently
while he masterfully plucks the
strings of his 12-string guitar
and follow carefully his wind
ing tales about his childhood,
his family and his friends. They
respond to his performance
with comments and applause,
but it seems they do it only at
the right times.
Frankly, Leo Kottke mes
merizes his audiences but
without being flashy. His act
flows smoothly and spontane
ously. He has no set order of
tunes and stories to tell. He just
does whatever seems right, he
says.
Kottke came onto the stage
with two 12-string guitars, sat
down, gave another one of his
mesmerising performances at
Memorial Auditorium Friday
night that got him a standing
ovation and two encores.
ASSU Special Events sold al
most every seat in the house, a
good turn out for the still rela
tively unknown Kottke.
It used to be that outside the
small sphere of guitar players
Kottke was little-known, but
his fame has spread now. With
several albums under his belt
and constant touring Kottke
has finally managed to gain the
recognition he so richly de
serves.
Kottke says, "I'm really
happy with what I have now
and I do all the things required
to keep it rolling." He adds that
it's not so much that he wants
tomakeittotheverytopas that
now there is some breathing

space for him below. He
doesn't have to constantly
worry about trying to rub two
quarters together.
Integrated work
Kottke integrates elements
of jazz, blues and traditional
folk into his music. He even
does a few classical pieces.
Pete Seeger, he says, has had
the most profound influence
on his music, although
guitarist John Fahey has also
contributed to his style.
Kottke explains that Seeger
"doesn't think of himself as
much of a player," but that he,
Kottke, finds great richness in
his playing. A Seeger release
called "The Goofing Off Suite"
has many Seeger instrumentals
which made an impression on
Kottke.
Kottke was born in Athens,
Georgia. He moved around a
lot when he was young and
says he never stayed anywhere
for more than three years.
After he finished high
school, he went into the sub
marine service and served "on
the second oldest submarine
in the Navy." While in the Navy
an accident permanently im
paired his hearing, but it hasn't
seemed to affect his virtuosity
on the guitar.
Kottke draws on his reservoir
of experience to tell what ap
pear to be the most outlandish
tales ever invented. But he says

they're for real. "There area lot
of true stories that I can't tell
any more. People are getting
more skeptical."
John Fahey heard about
Kottke and was impressed with
his work. Kottke began cutting
a record with Fahey's Takoma
Records. He lived with Fahey
for a while and was influenced
by him. Kottke and Fahey are
still good friends, "we just ha
ven't been speaking to each
other," Kottke says wryly.
Finally, one of his recordings
received a lot of attention from
an FM listing service and also
good reviews. An FM disc joc
key in Chicago got Kottke a job
at a club there and ever since
then things have been going
nowhere but up.
It is not uncommon for
Kottke to have five engage
ments in a week. He says he
doesn't mind working hard
though. He has not only
traveled all over the United
States, but also through
Europe, Australia and New Zea
land.
It does make it difficult,
however, for him to see his
wife and two children who live
in St. Cloud, Minnesota. He is
on an airplane six days a week,
which is dangerous because
"the ozone turns your hair
white."
Ouite often he's not flying to
his next engagement, but

home to St. Cloud. He has tried
taking his family with him on
tour, but says he's "too much
of a grouch to put up with
them."
When he does take time off,
it usually isn't more than a
couple of days. He prefers to
see his family more often for
shorter periods of time.
Prose writer
When he has time he writes
prose. He's trying to write
down some of the stories he
tells on stage. Publishers are
begging him to do it so they
can publish the stories. "I write
about things that strike me, but
without, I hope, being a ped
ant about it,"he remarks.
On his days off, Kottke has
no desire to go off into an iso
lated corner of the woods. "I
go home. Going home and sit
ting in that living room is
paradise."
As for his music, "It's the
most important thing in my life
. . . I'm kind of a cracked per
son but when I play I get this
unified feeling. Everything is
exciting and solid. I feel like,
'What could be wrong?' "
And where does he get the
inspiration for his own songs.
"Well, I get a tickle in the back
of my head. It's really always
there. It's just that sometimes
it's stronger. You just sit
around and wail for it and it
comes by."
