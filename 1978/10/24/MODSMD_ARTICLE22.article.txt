## A
						delinquent's comic book 
### 
In the twenties, master showman Cecil B. De
Mille churned out a string of enormously popu
lar cautionary tales with titles like Why Change
Your Wife? and The Golden Bed. De Mille
reasoned correctly that to show the ravages of
adultery he first would have to show the excite
ment that might make an illicit affair attractive,
and exhibitors of the time found these glimpses
of the darker side of life to wield tremendous
power at the box office.
Things are different in the seventies, but pro
ducers are still looking for that bit of shtick
which will capture the wandering attention of an
audience. And with the release of Columbia's
Midnight Express, it seems that the latest
attention-grabber designed to make boffo box
office is sado-masochism.
'Examination'
Midnight Express is being ballyhooed (by the
likes of Rona Barrett and Rex Reed) as a serious
examination of the treatment of American pris
oners in Turkish jails. Taking their cue from Mr.
De Mille's "examinations" of adultery, the mak
ers of this film have decided that the best way to
examine torture is to depict it graphically on the
screen. If the '20s got their jollies out of
forbidden romance, they must have reasoned,
then the seventies will require the portrayal of
violence of the eye-gouging variety to wake up
the jaded sensibilities of an audience.
The film is a not-very-faithful account of the
experiences of Billy Hayes, an American who
was arrested in 1970 for the possession of two
kilograms of hashish, and sentenced to five
years in a Turkish prison. When he had served
all but 53 days, his sentence was commuted to
life imprisonment. Hayes managed to escape in
1975 and return to the United States. The true
story seems eminently cinematic; he even
makes his escape in a stolen rowboat off an
island prison.
But, seemingly to play up the violence,

screenplay writer Oliver Stone has chosen to
downplay the more adventurous (and therefore
less "meaningful"?) elements of the story â€” a
tactic which includes changing Billy's method of
escape. "The escape in the movie was almost an
afterthought, the real Billy Hayes commented
after a press screening of the film in San Fran
cisco. "I missed the rowboat," he admitted,
"but loved the movie."
Hayes isn't the only one who missed the boat
in this delinquent's comic book of a movie. Brad
Davis (best known for his depthless portrayal of
Old George' in ABC's Roots) gives a catatonic
performance as the main character: the thing he
does best in the film is to chew gum, which
seems to take some of the self-righteous strain
out of his features. Yet it isn't that he doesn't try;
he simply doesn t have the range necessary to
let us see how a pampered American can survive
in the conditions of a foreign prison. Much
worse, for exam pie, is the simpering Irene Mi ra
cle as Hayes' girlfriend Susan. She has the honor
of having to deliver a line so bad that it could
become 3campclassic."|esusChrist!"shecries
when she visits Hayes in prison only to find him
drooling and nearly insane, "You've just got to
pull yourself together!"
Full-color gore
When speaking of his autobiography recently
in San Francisco, Billy Hayes mentioned almost
parenthetically, "the book was rather mild
compared to this." "This," meaning, of course'
the movie, includes the total fabrication of such
crowd-pleasers as the sight of Billy charging
gleefully upon a Turk and biting out his tongue
in close-up splendor. Instead of glorying in
full-cobrgore, people considering going to see
Midnight Express might want to think about
sending their admission money to the Commit
tee of Concerned Parents in Washington That
way Midnight Express, despite a effort to do
otherwise, might even do some good.
