## Merce Cunningham presents innovative show 
### 
Merce Cunningham has said
that, "Clarity is the lowest form
of Poetry," and I must admit
that I left Friday's performance
in Berkeley by Merce Cunnin
gham and Dance Company,
feeling somewhat confused.
But Cunningham, his 58 years
just beginning to show
through a vulnerability, was
impressive and fascinating to
watch. It was the company, the
audience and the choreog
raphy that sometimes con
fused me.
Cunningham, a sea-green
incorruptible avantgardist, as
critic Clive Barnes has called
him, has been one of the most
influential choreographers of
the past 25 years. A native of
Washington, he studied at the
Cornish of Fine and Applied
Arts in Seattle before becom
ing a soloist with the Martha
Graham Company. From 1940
to 1945 he created some of the
best known roles in their re
pertoire including the Re
vivalist in Appalachian Spring.
Cunningham took solo tours of
the United States in '48, and '51
with the composer )ohn Cage,
of prepared piano fame, be
fore forming a company in
1952.
Emphasis on movement
Cunningham's approach to
choreography directly opposes
the Graham style. The em
phasis is on the movement it
self. As Cunningham states it:
"We do not mean to express,
we merely present this event
before you." In one piece
Antic Meet, he did a solo with a
chair strapped to his back.
Some people interpreted this
to be a parody of the male
dancer as lifting machine.

Cunningham said, "Symbols
don't interest me. You see a
chair on my back. Why not just
say 'How strange' and leave it
at that." Unfortunately not all
of Friday night's pieces seemed
to exemplify this philosophy.
Torse (1976), the first piece
on the program, succeeded
least well. First of all it was
"too" dated, too long, too re
petitive, and danced by too
many people. This piece is an
example of Cunningham's use
of "chance" in choreography.
Since 1951, Cunningham has
occasionally used chance
methods such as coins, cards,
or the I Ching to determine the
sequence, duration, or spatial
direction of parts of dances,
the purpose being to free his
imagination from its own
cliches. In Torse the I Ching
was used to determine the
sequence, number of dancers
and movements happening in
any given moment. The name
refers to the use of the torso in
five basic positions: upright,
arch, twist, tilt, and curve.
Time is presented here in
unvarying steadiness. The
dancers move in and out of
lines and blocks, with an occa
sional solo done as an exten
sion of a line or block of dan
cers. The predominance of
brushing and jete-like move
ments became a choreog
raphic ostinato. The large cast
demonstrated much activity,
but most of it was so similar in
character that it became inac
tive. There were also technical
problems, many of the cast had
cases of the wobbles during ex
tensions, which are annoying
in solos and deadly in unison
work.

Torse made evident some
thing which was also a problem
but to a lesser degree in the
other pieces, namely the lack
of individual personality in the
dancers. In the past this indi
viduality of the dancers has
been one of the unique and
strong points of the company.
Cunningham has said that
"Each dancer once seen, is
immediately recognizable on
reappearance." Here in com
plete contrast to classical ballet
each dancer should have his
particular way of moving con
nected with his physical prop
ortions. In part, due to this
emphasis on the development
of the individual, many former
company members such as
Douglas Dunn are now solo
performers. Others such as
Viola Farber have formed their
own companies.
Contrast
In contrast to Torse was
Cunningham's solo, Tango,
performed to the accompani
ment of Cage's amplified vocal
noises with an inserted piece
of disco music, with scenery of
a color television set (turned
on, sound down), and a rain
coat thrown on the floor next
to it.
The following quote by
Cunningham expresses why
this piece worked and Torse
did not: "If the dancer dances
— which is not the same as hav
ing theories about dancing, or
wishing to dance, or trying to
dance, or remembering in his
body someone else's dance —
but if the dancer dances every
thing is there." My only criti
cism of this piece is directed
towards the audience which
laughed throughout the whole
piece. Yes, the piece was
funny; Cunningham moved in
an amazingly absurd manner,
giving particular attention to
his shoulders by quick
twitches, to his hips by discon
necting them and to his hands
by flutters. However, the piece
was serious and powerful
movement too, and not the
fluffy satire that the audience
took it to be.
Manipulation
The third and fourth pieces
on the program Sounddance,
and Travelogue, fell some
where between the first two in
effectiveness, though some
what closer to Tango. Sound
dance is a frenetic, anxious
work, which begins with the
entrances of the dancers one
by one through a marvelous

draped wall designed by Mark
Lancaster. The rest of the piece
is full of frenzied movement,
much of it directed towards
manipulation, especially of
women. The male dancers,
especially Cunningham him
self, push and otherwise phys
ically place the female dancers,
who are dressed in costumes
which, while not innately mas
culine, mirror the male
dancer's traditional practice
garb.
Autonomy
Travelogue (1977), per
formed to an insane mixture of
bird calls, recorded phone
messages (listings of city
events etc.) and miscellaneous
phone sounds, has decor and
lighting by Robert Rauschen
berg. This piece exemplifies
Cunningham's philosophy of
the autonomy of the choreog
rapher, the designer, and the
composer. Each of these men
are artists in their own right
who put their work together
for added interest. Cunnin
gham often composes his
dances without music which

may or may not be added later.
In this very imaginative and
creative piece, each man's
work interacts with the others
without obscuring it.
Upcoming performances
Cunningham and his com
pany performed last Friday, and
