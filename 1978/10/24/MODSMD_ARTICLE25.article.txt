## Pop guitar for the '80s 
### 
Larry Carlton recently said —
in print, mind you — that he
would like to be the Eric Clap
ton of the '80s.
Not a chance.
It was evident last Monday
night, as studio whiz
cumband-fronts piece/guitar
showman Carlton discharged
his particular brand of bouncy,
high energy funk/ jazz/ rock/
label/ label/ label to a sold-out
second show Great American
Music Hall audience, that this
fellow is no match for the '60s
ace guitar slinger.
First off, he's too happy to
become a junkie. Second, he's
too well-versed in the neces
sary humility of a studio side
man to ever have problems
with blimp-sized rock star ego
and the inevitable collapse
thereof. Third, his personal
playing style has markedly im
proved, grown, and expanded
ever since the 1973 release of
his Sing/Playing album, which
quickly found its way to the na
tion's bargain bins, thanks to
countless hours in the studio
behind the likes of Joni Mitch
ell and Steely Dan. So how
could he end up like poor ol'
Eric?
A chance
If, on the other hand, he
meant by that comment that
he's like to become the popu
lar guitarist of the next decade,
then folks, this boy has a
chance.
The 30-year-old Carlton
began his career 14 years ago,
when he was hired to perform
a studio date solely due to his
"lack of finesse." Demo work
soon led to three-a-day studio
sessions, as well as road work
with the early L.A. Express
(featuring studio sax gem Tom
Scott). A 1974 studio encounter
with the Crusaders led to a

four-year membership in that
group; at the same time
Carlton made "hired gun" ap
pearances on albums ranging
from )oni Mitchell's Court and
Spark to Steely Dan's Katy Lied,
Royal Scam, and Aja. It is only
recently that studio work has
taken a back seat in Carlton's
life to producing, arranging,
and fulfilling his solo career.
Supercharged strut
Carlton's San Francisco set
showcased his just-released
Larry Carlton LP, some of the
liveliest, happiest instrumental
fusion stuff to hit vinyl or stage
in recent memory. With sear
ing, sustained precision
Carlton carves arching arpeg
gios mixed with dirty electro
blooz flourishes over a churn
ing bottom provided by
keyboard man Greg Matheson,
bassist Neil Stuberhaus, and
percussionist )ohn Ferraro.
The music is unpretentiously
funky, a supercharged strut
through the gilt-edged world
of high energy instrumental
jazz. Carlton's particular magic
is his innate sensitivity to tim
ing and phrasing. His playing is
consistently right: he knows
exactly when to use any one of
his considerable store of tech
nical tricks, without indulging
in unnecessary grandstanding
or overbearing showmanship.
Melange
Happily, Carlton's live show
confirmed what one suspects
upon first hearing his new al
bum; the disc could easily do
without the "lush'' string pro
duction used on some cuts,

and his singing is just as, er,
"questionable" in person as on
wax. Carlton's qualitative
strength, though, is his guitar
work; if exciting on the album,
is simply phenomenal live. A
lusty blend of archaic blues
runs and ultra-mod speed
plays, fingernail harmonic
tricks, volume pedal and occa
sional echoplex manipula
tions, his style is a melange of
everything from be-bop to
McLaughin and beyond — a
nod to the past and glimpse of
the future.
Revitalizing
Modern music is in a dissol
ute state of complete confu
sion and utter chaos, in which
the heroes are mere shadows
of those on whom their cel
lophane images are based; in
which the rock record buying
public confuses the merits of
stage style with musical pro
wess; in which just about any
one who brandishes a guitar
and the right verbal/attitudinal
cliches can "make it." How
completely revitalizing, in this
world of pretenders and fak
ers, to discover that sincere,
confident, ebullient, no
holds-barred fun music not
only exists, but flourishes
onstage. All executed with a
smile and a whoop from one of
today's real guitar heros.

ton of the '80s.
Not a chance.
It was evident last Monday
night, as studio whiz
cumband-fronts piece/guitar
showman Carlton discharged
his particular brand of bouncy,
high energy funk/ jazz/ rock/
label/ label/ label to a sold-out
second show Great American
Music Hall audience, that this
fellow is no match for the '60s
ace guitar slinger.
First off, he's too happy to
become a junkie. Second, he's
too well-versed in the neces
sary humility of a studio side
man to ever have problems
with blimp-sized rock star ego
and the inevitable collapse
thereof. Third, his personal
playing style has markedly im
proved, grown, and expanded
ever since the 1973 release of
his Sing/Playing album, which
quickly found its way to the na
tion's bargain bins, thanks to
countless hours in the studio
behind the likes of Joni Mitch
ell and Steely Dan. So how
could he end up like poor ol'
Eric?
A chance
If, on the other hand, he
meant by that comment that
he's like to become the popu
lar guitarist of the next decade,
then folks, this boy has a
chance.
The 30-year-old Carlton
began his career 14 years ago,
when he was hired to perform
a studio date solely due to his
"lack of finesse." Demo work
soon led to three-a-day studio
sessions, as well as road work
with the early L.A. Express
(featuring studio sax gem Tom
Scott). A 1974 studio encounter
with the Crusaders led to a

four-year membership in that
group; at the same time
Carlton made "hired gun" ap
pearances on albums ranging
from )oni Mitchell's Court and
Spark to Steely Dan's Katy Lied,
Royal Scam, and Aja. It is only
recently that studio work has
taken a back seat in Carlton's
life to producing, arranging,
and fulfilling his solo career.
Supercharged strut
Carlton's San Francisco set
showcased his just-released
Larry Carlton LP, some of the
liveliest, happiest instrumental
fusion stuff to hit vinyl or stage
in recent memory. With sear
ing, sustained precision
Carlton carves arching arpeg
gios mixed with dirty electro
blooz flourishes over a churn
ing bottom provided by
keyboard man Greg Matheson,
bassist Neil Stuberhaus, and
percussionist )ohn Ferraro.
The music is unpretentiously
funky, a supercharged strut
through the gilt-edged world
of high energy instrumental
jazz. Carlton's particular magic
is his innate sensitivity to tim
ing and phrasing. His playing is
consistently right: he knows
exactly when to use any one of
his considerable store of tech
nical tricks, without indulging
in unnecessary grandstanding
or overbearing showmanship.
Melange
Happily, Carlton's live show
confirmed what one suspects
upon first hearing his new al
bum; the disc could easily do
without the "lush'' string pro
duction used on some cuts,

and his singing is just as, er,
"questionable" in person as on
wax. Carlton's qualitative
strength, though, is his guitar
work; if exciting on the album,
is simply phenomenal live. A
lusty blend of archaic blues
runs and ultra-mod speed
plays, fingernail harmonic
tricks, volume pedal and occa
sional echoplex manipula
tions, his style is a melange of
everything from be-bop to
McLaughin and beyond — a
nod to the past and glimpse of
the future.
Revitalizing
Modern music is in a dissol
ute state of complete confu
sion and utter chaos, in which
the heroes are mere shadows
of those on whom their cel
lophane images are based; in
which the rock record buying
public confuses the merits of
stage style with musical pro
wess; in which just about any
one who brandishes a guitar
and the right verbal/attitudinal
cliches can "make it." How
completely revitalizing, in this
world of pretenders and fak
ers, to discover that sincere,
confident, ebullient, no
holds-barred fun music not
only exists, but flourishes
onstage. All executed with a
smile and a whoop from one of
today's real guitar heros.
Larry Carlton recently said —
in print, mind you — that he
would like to be the Eric Clap
ton of the '80s.
