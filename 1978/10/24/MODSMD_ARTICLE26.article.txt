Egypt wants treaty changes
Egypt asked for "modifications" yesterday
in the proposed peace treaty with Israel, ap
parently dissatisfied with the weak link the
draft document makes between the Palesti
nian issue and an Egyptian-Israeli settle
ment.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and the
other Israeli negotiators at the Washington
peace talks with Egypt had resisted putting
"linkage" language in the proposed treaty —
wording that would make the Israeli-
Egyptian peace in some way dependent on
progress toward settling the issues of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and the political future of the Palestinians
living there.
U.S.sources said in Washington over the
weekend the two sides reached a "50-50
compromise" on the linkage issue. A loosely
worded formulation on the subject was in
serted in the treaty's preamble to appease
Egypt, the sources said, and apparently the
link was not strong enough to arouse Israel's
opposition.
But Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil
said yesterday that Egypt now has "asked for
modifications." Khalil said he and President
Anwar Sadat communicated with Egypt's
Washington delegation about some "tech
nical remarks" in the treaty draft relating to
the linkage issue.
SALT pact still not ready
Moscow — U.S. and Soviet negotiators
failed last night to conclude a treaty to limit
strategic weapons, complicating prospects
for a signed accord or a presidential summit
before the end of the year.
The next step in the drive by the twonuc

lear powers to restrain the arms race was not
made clear as the talks ended at the Kremlin
with Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev at the
bargaining table.
"Any question about what happens next
awaits the secretary's report to the presi
dent," U.S. spokesman Hodding Carter told
reporters.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance cabled a
detailed account of the proceedings to Pres
ident Jimmy Carter, and plans to report to
him on his return to Washington tonight.
Both sides described the talks as "con
structive" but said some issues remained
unresolved.
"We continue to hope an agreement is
possible by the end of the year," said State
Department spokesman Carter.
Announcement that no treaty would be
nailed down during the Kremlin session, the
last in the current round of SALT talks, came
as no surprise, because both sides had indi
cated earlier they were still apart on some
issues.
Brown hits Younger remark
Long Beach — Gov. Jerry Brown accused
Attorney General Evelle Younger of "a de
liberate falsehood" yesterday in Younger's
claim that more jobs were created in gov
ernment than in private industry during
Brown's term.
Younger, Republican candidate for gov
ernor, has been saying for the last week that
five governent jobs have been created for
every two in private industry since Brown
took office.
Younger made that allegation again Sun
day in a nationally televised confrontation
with Brown on NBC's "Meet the Press," ad
ding, "Government jobs just create taxes.

They don't produce more jobs."
But Brown's Employment Development
Department said yesterday that 5Vi private
jobs have been created for every govern
ment job in California during Brown's term
— and that Younger apparently was compar
ing private manufacturing employment
alone to government jobs in every field.
The Democratic governor reacted indig
nantly.
"I would like Mr. Younger to retract his
false statement," Brown told officials of 43
Long Beach harbor-area unions.
He called Younger's statement "a deliber
ate falsehood that I found shocking when I
heard it."
Younger could not be reached im
mediately for comment.
Carter to unveil inflation plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
takes his new anti-inflation program to the
American pubic tonight and already busi
ness, labor and consumer groups are telling
him it will not work.
The program, to be unveiled in a nation
wide broadcast a 7 p.m. PDT, includes vol
untary limits on wages and prices. They wold
be enforced by some new government
weapons, administration sources say.
Carter's program would set a 7 percent
limit on wages and fringe benefits. The price
formula is more complicated but is aimed at
holding increases to SJ/«5 J /« percent a year.
The government plans to use sanctions to
enforce the guidelines, such as possibly
withholding federal contracts to firms which
do not comply with them, and allowing
more imports, sorces said.
At a news conference yesterday, spokes
men for some consumer groups said the

main solution to the inflation program is to
diminish the control over the economy
exercised by big business.
Last week, AFL-CIO President George
Meany criticized voluntary wage-price
guidelines as unfair to labor, arguing that it is
easier to control wages than prices.
Business leaders, on the other hand, say
the solution to inflation is to control gov
ernment spending and reduce environmen
tal and safety controls.
jury gets Dr. X case
Hackensack — The judge in the Dr. X mur
der trial reviewed the evidence yesterday
before handing the case over to a jury that
heard 34 weeks of testimony about the al
leged curare deaths of hospital patients.
The jury was to be charged and retire to
begin deliberations later in the day in the
murder trial of Dr. Mario Jascalevich.
The case evolved into a free press-free trial
battle that resulted in the jailing of New York
Times reporter Myron Farber.
Jascalevich, 50, was indicted in May 1976
on charges that he used the muscle relaxant
curare to murder five patients at Oradell's
Riverdell Hospital in 1965 and 1966.
At the conclusion of the prosecution's
case Judge William Arnold dismissed two
murder counts, citing lack of evidence. If
convicted on the remaining counts, Jas
calevich faces a maximum of three consecu
tive life terms in prison.
Farber's stories on the Riverdell deaths, in
which he refrred to Jascalevich as "Dr. X,"
resulted in a decision by the Bergen County
prosecutor's office to reopen the case.
At the request of the defense, Arnold or
dered Farberand the Times toturn overtheir
files on the case. Both refused and on July 24
were found in civil and criminal contempt.

Maine land settlement nears
Augusta, Maine — Maine's top leaders ag
reed yesterday to accept an out-of-court set
tlement that would provide two native
American tribes with $27 million and 100,000
acres of land — less than one-half percent of
the state's total land area.
If the tribes and Congress go along, the
compromise plan would settle one of the
largest native American land cases in the na
tion for a fraction of the native Americans
original claim of $25 billion and 12.5 million
acres.
The land that would be turned over to the
native Americans is about the size of Mem
phis, Tenn.
On the other hand, the Penobscot and
Passamaquoddy tribes, numbering fewer
than 4000 members, would get a large por
tion of Maine woodland without ever prov
ing their case in the courts.
Stocks close mixed
New York — Selective buying in blue chips
and some other depressed issues enabled
the stock market to turn in a mixed showing
yesterday after last week's rout.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen a record 59.08 points last
week, managed to recover 1.65 to 839.66.
But losers held a 2-1 edge on gainers in the
broad tally at the New York Stock Exchange,
with more than 1000 issues declining for the
sixth straight session.
Today's weather
— Fair through tomorrow except local fog
late nights and mornings. Cooler days. Lows
in upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the 70s.
Northwesterly winds 10 to 20 mph in after
noons.
