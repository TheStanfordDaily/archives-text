# Program slated for next fall quarter
## Computer to teach Armenian language 
### NANCY WILLIAMS 
A computer program to teach
Armenian will begin here next fall, if
government agencies approve re
quests for financial support.
Lawrence Markosian, a doctoral
candidate, said $300,000 in private
donations have paid for develop
ment work, but that additional funds
are needed to get the program off the
ground.
Proposals, requesting funds, have
been submitted to the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare;
and the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
If the classes are successful, Mar
kosian said, he thought the Slavic
Languages Department might spon
sor the program as a regular course.
Markosian is developing the sys

tern's technology, while Hasmig
Seropian, a UC-Berkeley student, is
working on the teaching format.
Joseph Van Campen, chairman of
the Slavic Languages Department
and developer of a Russian computer
class, is the program adviser.
The Armenian classes will be
taught using a combination of video
display and coordinated recorded
instruction, Markosian said.
Several philosophy and science
classes already use this system.
However, the Armenian lessons
will also include Computer Synth
esized Speech, which was developed
over the past six years.
Three steps
CSS follows three basic steps,
Markosian explained. He said les
sons are recorded into the compu
ter; the information is compressed;

and then the lesson is recalled, with n
the information transposed to its
normal length. r
This offers two advantages over
other systems, Markosian said. "The a
CSS has much more control than the I.
previous system, because it allows c
random access to any portion of the
lesson.
"Secondly, it is less expensive." r
One-to-one a
The computer program enables t
students to take a course which has n
small demand and to develop a one- c
to-one relationship with the
"teacher," Markosian added. p
But, he predicted Armenian les- p
sons eventually would be linked up tl
to computer systems at major uni
versities across the country. f;
Currently, a computer hookup te s
"only feasible when a college is very a

near," Markosian said.
Seropian explained that the prog
ram was designed "to keep the
Armenian language and culture alive
and to provide lessons, in an exotic
language, that might not have been
otherwise available."
Culture group
She said there were 40 to 50 Arme
nian students on campus, and that
about half of them have started a cul
tural group, which she thought,
might be interested in using the
computer lessons.
"There have notbeen many quality
programs to teach Armenian," Sero
pian said. "The quality of textbooks
that exist is very poor."
Armenian is derived from a sub
family of Indo-European languages,
she explained, and uses a 38-letter
alphabet.
