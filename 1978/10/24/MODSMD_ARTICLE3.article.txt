# Britton: U.S.E. is making progress

### MONIKA CUTTMAN 
"We've come a long way and we
have a long way yet to go," said Bob
Britton, presidentof the United Stan
ford Employees (USE).
In a recent Daily interview, Britton
discussed what he called the prog
ress within the union since his elec
tion as president last April.
"The split in the union has healed
over, and no hard feelings remain,"
he said, referring to the controversial
division between his supporters and
those of previous union secretary Jim
Berk. The clash climaxed during the
April election, when Berk said the
conflict posed a "serious threat" to
the health of the union.
"But activists from Berk's time are
again participating in all aspects of
the union," Britton said.
Union changes
Britton mentioned recent im
provements in USE organization, in
cluding the hiring of general man
ager, David Novogrodsky. Novog
rodsky has had 20 years of union or
ganizational experience, including
work with the AFL-CIO, Britton said.
"His philosophy of unions is paral
lel to our own," Britton added. "He
believes in rank and file involvement
and the dissemination of knowledge.

Thus, not just the lawyers are in
volved in arbitrations, but also the
stewards."
Stewards are elected union rep
resentatives who deal with members
in their workplaces. For the first
time, this September, a special train
ing session was held for the ste
wards.
Because of these changes, Britton
said he now "can do more of the
political organization and less ad
ministration of the union."
Revisions
USE also is revamping its constitu
tion and By-laws Committee to get
more rank-and-file involvement.
One of its long-range goals, accord
ing to Britton, is to organize all 5000
University employees.
"We're making progress in com
municating," said Britton. "We're
starting to get people involved."
One area which traditionally has
been a problem for USE organizers is
the Medical Center. But according to
Britton, members Julia Harvey, Anne
Schlagenhaft (past USE president)
and others have been successful in
getting workers to solve problems in
a "unionized manner."
"For instance, the glassware work
ers recently got together and won

concessions from their managers,"
Britton said.
But Britton said that new member
ship has been "moderate," this year,
which he attributed to the "high
union initiation fee."
"We've been thinking of reducing
the fee or just doing away with it al
together," Britton said. "Such a fee
really only makes sense where you
have to have a union card to get a
job."
At the University a union card is
not mandatory.
Identity sought
Britton said he is pleased with the
growth of the union so far, but
realizes there is much yet to be ac
complished.
USE membership includes about
25 percent of University employees.
"We have to build an identity," he
said. "Even though the employees
do different work, they all have the
same employer. If they're going to
negotiate in strength, they'd better
get together."
Britton said he hopes to build
enough strength in membership to
help negotiate for a "good contract"
next September, without resorting to
a strike. Britton said USE contracts
expire in September.

starting to get people involved."
One area which traditionally has
been a problem for USE organizers is
the Medical Center. But according to
Britton, members Julia Harvey, Anne
Schlagenhaft (past USE president)
and others have been successful in
getting workers to solve problems in
a "unionized manner."
"For instance, the glassware work
ers recently got together and won

concessions from their managers,"
Britton said.
But Britton said that new member
ship has been "moderate," this year,
which he attributed to the "high
union initiation fee."
"We've been thinking of reducing
the fee or just doing away with it al
together," Britton said. "Such a fee
really only makes sense where you
have to have a union card to get a
job."
At the University a union card is
not mandatory.
Identity sought
Britton said he is pleased with the
growth of the union so far, but
realizes there is much yet to be ac
complished.
USE membership includes about
25 percent of University employees.
"We have to build an identity," he
said. "Even though the employees
do different work, they all have the
same employer. If they're going to
negotiate in strength, they'd better
get together."
Britton said he hopes to build
enough strength in membership to
help negotiate for a "good contract"
next September, without resorting to
a strike. Britton said USE contracts
expire in September.
"We've come a long way and we
have a long way yet to go," said Bob
Britton, presidentof the United Stan
ford Employees (USE).
In a recent Daily interview, Britton
discussed what he called the prog
ress within the union since his elec
tion as president last April.
"The split in the union has healed
over, and no hard feelings remain,"
he said, referring to the controversial
division between his supporters and
those of previous union secretary Jim
Berk. The clash climaxed during the
April election, when Berk said the
conflict posed a "serious threat" to
the health of the union.
"But activists from Berk's time are
again participating in all aspects of
the union," Britton said.
Union changes
Britton mentioned recent im
provements in USE organization, in
cluding the hiring of general man
ager, David Novogrodsky. Novog
rodsky has had 20 years of union or
ganizational experience, including
work with the AFL-CIO, Britton said.
"His philosophy of unions is paral
lel to our own," Britton added. "He
believes in rank and file involvement
and the dissemination of knowledge.

Thus, not just the lawyers are in
volved in arbitrations, but also the
stewards."
Stewards are elected union rep
resentatives who deal with members
in their workplaces. For the first
time, this September, a special train
ing session was held for the ste
wards.
Because of these changes, Britton
said he now "can do more of the
political organization and less ad
ministration of the union."
Revisions
USE also is revamping its constitu
tion and By-laws Committee to get
more rank-and-file involvement.
One of its long-range goals, accord
ing to Britton, is to organize all 5000
University employees.
"We're making progress in com
municating," said Britton. "We're
starting to get people involved."
