# Attempt to salvage NASA project
## Dish to help contact Voyager 
### LAWRENCE MATHEWS 
After four years of inactivity, the
Dish is back.
The radio telescope antenna,
which sits on the hills behind the
University, has been enlisted by
NASA to help save the Voyager II
spacecraft.
Voyager was heading for Jupiter,
but is stalled in orbit on the far side of
the sun, because its primary radio
receiver broke down.
NASA, through the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif, has
selected the Dish as its best chance of
communicating with Voyager,
should the craft's ailing backup re
ceiver also fail.
Experiments last month by Univer
sity and SRI International
researchers proved the Dish could
establish contact with the craft.
More tests
Tests are underway to determine
the feasibility of a computer
communication link-up, which could
lead to reprogramming Voyager's
controls.
In the first set of tests, Taylor How
ard, an electrical engineering profes
sor here, and his assistants, estab
lished contact with Voyager. How
ard, William Crosby and Robert Foss
sent radio signals at regular intervals,
finally picking up the spacecraft's
third receiver, which is designed to
catch Jupiter's natural radio emis
sions.
Reaching the third receiver was
difficult, Howard said, because the
unit was designed for scientific re
search not communication. The re
ceiver and the Dish also operated on
different wavelengths, until the ex
periment team managed to re-tune
the Voyager unit.
Now, researchers are trying to
build loose radio signals into mes
sages to the Voyager computer.
If this works, Howard said, they
could reprogram the craft's compu
ter controller sequence and,
perhaps, save the mission.
|PL cautions
The major delay lies with the JPL
planners, Howard explained. "We're
all ready to do it (contact the ship),"
but the planners "are very conserva
tive with the spacecraft."
He said they must do everything
"very carefully and complete plan
ning...(to) make sure it's done

exactly right."
"The project people are worried
that the other receiver will fail,"
Howard added. If it does, JPL is afraid
"there'll be no other way than the
dish" to contact Voyager," he said.
"It's very difficult for the project
people to decide where to go," he
explained. "It's a real clitfhanger."
Chances'good'
If the backup receiver does fail,
Howard said, he thinks the chances
are good that the Dish could be used
to command the spacecraft.
But, he added, the ship is moving
away from the earth at the rate of 1
million miles per day and, in a year or
two, it will be beyond the Dish's
range.
In that case, NASA might build a
special facility to contact Voyager,
Howard predicted. He said this
might be a joint venture between
NASA and the Department of Energy,
because large amounts of radio
energy would be involved.
The Dish is owned by the Depart
ment of Defense, which financed
construction. It is used by the de

partment, the University and SRI.
The Dish was built simultaneously
with similar antenna in Bedford,
Mass. Completed in 1962, it was "on
the air and operating for about $1
million," Howard said.
A 150-foot parabola of steel and
aluminum, the Dish is larger than
many radio telescope antennae, ac
cording to Ray Leadabrand, co
director of the Center for Radar As
tronomy at SRI.
He said the facility was used mainly
to study space phenomena through
radio rather than light waves, which
are used by optical telescopes.
Probe follower
Leadabrand said the Dish was last
used to track Pioneer space probe
missions during the early '70s. It also
followed the Mariner 5 flight to
Venus and was involved in lunar
radar work and the study of pulsars.
The Dish, according to Leadab
rand, is a "flexible instrument," be
cause it is both a receiver and a
transmitter of radio signals.
It may also be the key to keeping
Voyager II alive.
