# Kappa Kappa Gamma is initiated nationally
## 
### JANICE KIMBALL 
Kappa Kappa Gamma turned in its
pledge pins last week and became
the third sorority here initiated and
rechartered by its national organiza
tion.
Kappa Alpha Theta was rechar
tered earlier this quarter, while
Alpha Phi was initiated last spring.
With three chartered groups, the
Inter-Sorority Council now can be
come affiliated with the National
Panhellenic Council. ISC President
Tammy Ritchey said this will not have
any effect on her organization.
"The ISC hopes that we won't
need to refer to outside sources at
all," Ritchey said. "We wrote bylaws
that won't need to be changed, so it
will problably only be a change in
name."
'Worked hard'
"We worked hard last spring to be
the first official group on campus,"
an Alpha Phi member said. "That al
lows us to be in charge of organizing
Panhellenic. We'd like to see it stay
very Stanford-oriented and inde
pendent."
Ritchey called initiation "a kind of
spiritual change. The groupfelt more
unified after we were initiated."
Initiation is the final step in becom
ing a recognized member of a na
tional sorority, she said. Women
here became pledges last spring,
then entered a training program
which took, depending on the

group, from four to 10 weeks.
After passing a written test, they
participated in "Inspiration Week."
Each group had different activities,
but typical events included candle
light ceremonies and sunrise break
fasts in Frost Amphitheatre.
Nancy Hoffman, president of
Kappa Alpha Theta, said one candle
light ceremony included "sharing
our hopes for what involvement in
the group would mean."
Charter trips
The Alpha Phis and the Thetas
traveled to Berkeley for their initia
tions. The Alpha Phis spent a night at
the chapter house and were initiated
the next morning. The Thetas were
given a dinner party following their
initiation. The Kappas were initiated
in the Stanford area.
Before initiation, all three groups
were considered "colonies" of their
national organizations. However,
once initiated, they received char
ters, making them official chapters of
their respective nationals.
Because the groups had been ac
tive here, when the 1944 ban on
sororities took effect, they were re
chartered, rather than established as
new chapters. The appropriate
Creek designaton, deuteron (mean
ing the second) was added to their
chapter names.
The next group to be initiated and
rechartered will be Pi Beta Phi in
November.
