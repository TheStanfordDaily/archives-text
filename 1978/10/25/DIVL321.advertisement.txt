A biologist was bored and lonely So he decided
to make a clone ot himself And he succeeded so
he thought The clone was exactly like him ex
cept that he had an enormous propensity for
using profane language. The clone, >ju see,
swore al every opportunity, and the biologist
found it annoying and embarrassing One day he
lakes his clone to a football game and during
halftime he pushes him over the wall at the top of
the bleachers. The clone falls to the ground many
feel below, creating a mess upon impact Then
the police arrest the biologist
"On what charge?" he demands
For making an obscene clone fall
