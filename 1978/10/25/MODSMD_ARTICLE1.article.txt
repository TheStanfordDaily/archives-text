# Nader calls for increased student activism
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Speaking before an overflow crowd in
Kresge Auditorium last night, consumer ac
tivist Ralph Nader urged students to donate
their time and talents towards the solutions to
the pressing problems facing the country and
the world.
Citing what he called a general inability on
the part of the public to ask simple questions
and a reluctance to take action, he said "A
country that doesn't have time for citizen in
volvement doesn't have time for democracy."
The major problems the United States faced
over the last 10 years have almost without ex
ception gotten worse, he said. "We are not in a
solution prone age."
Nader said that students have three assets
that make them the most qualified to seek a
solution and most able to "hold high the flag of
justice."
Students are free to take risks, he said.
Without family or career obligations they "are
still free here to think and pioneer, before you
(students) get the job and the price of doing
something different becomes too high."
He compared the situation of the student
with a hypothetical case of a field scientist for a
pesticide company whose work crew fudges
the results of a test. If he "blows the whistle"

he may get fired; if not, people may die.
Secondly, students are at the peak of their
idealism, Nader said. They have not yet ac
quired a cynical or hopeless outlook on civic
change.
Thirdly, Nader added that students are busy
being trained in locating and analyzing infor
mation. They have at their disposal the latest
facilities, resources and technology.
He suggested that a student could easily test
for asbestos rumored to be in San Francisco
drinking water, and even get course credit for
it, whereas a similar pro|ect would be well
beyond the reach of almost any other citizen.
Nader said that the majority of students are
passing up their opportunity. "You are strip
ping yourself of the resolve and experience to
make yourself good citizens," he said.
"There is not one of you who will work for a
large company and not see waste, fraud, cor
ruption and crimes," he stated, "and if you
don't think now about what your reaction will
be to those things, you never will."
He said that students should be using their
time on campus, not only to learn analytical
skills and academic knowledge, but also to
gain a consumer perspective that can make for
an effective citizen.
"The ability to ask simple questions about
products should be part of everyone's basic

education," he said.
Nader asked how many students were satis
fied with their dorm food. He said that stu
dents should be able to get the service they
want. "If you can't handle your food service,"
he said, "you're not learning."
One of the major barriers to civic involve
ment, Nader said, is the "decline of self
sufficiency on the part of family, neighbor
hood and community."
Families have been "atomized," he said and
grandparents have all but been eliminated
from family affairs. People have always had
personal problems but now instead of going to
neighbors or relatives for comfort, we call our
problems "emotional difficulties" and go to a
psychiatrist.
Nader said that presently people center their
lives around their place of work, but that the
resurgence of democratic power starts where
we live. Unless the U.S. develops a sense of
community, he said, Americans may come to a
consensus on an issue, but not have any in
strument to do something about it.
College students, Nader said, have the per
fect opportunity to form civic instruments.
Several schools already have Public Interest
Research Croups (PIRG) which use student re
sources to investigate community problems.
In New York, several schools have pooled

together and formed a large organization with
full-time professionals and students doing re
search work, he said.
Nader called for students to pass a fee as
sessment to start a student-run PIRG here, one
which could not only involve people presently
in school, but could also hire recent graduates.
He said such an organization could bring
talented young scientists, engineers and
economists who would be willing to bring
their skills and their morality to their work.
Nader mentioned several areas where a lack
of consumer perspective on the part of stu
dents allowed a bad situation to develop or
continue.
He asked how many students had ever won
dered what the Educational Testing Service
(ETS) really was concerned with. Their tests
(such as the SAT) are easy to administer, he
said, and help avoid the need to carefully
probe scholastic and extra-curricular
achievements.
None of the qualities that have enabled
civilization to advance — idealism, experi
ence, judgment, wisdom, creativity and
stamina — are tested by the ETS, Nader said.
One of his student research groups has re
cently completed a study on the ETS which will
come out in a few months. "The time is up on
this type of testing," Nader said.
