# Tourist map of Harlem ghetto to rebuild residents' pride

New York (AP) — They are
known as forbidden zones in
America's cities, Harlem in
New York, Watts in Los
Angeles, Boston's Roxbury,
Chicago's West Side.
"If you're white and find
yourself in Roxbury," says one
Bostonian, "you're either lost
or you're a poverty lawyer."
The psychological barriers
that have segregated the na
tion's bleakest urban ghettos
from the outside are partially
rooted in the fear of street
crime.

But increasingly, residents of
some of these areas believe
that the problem really is that
outsiders and even residents
just don't know what's there —
landmarks, museums,
churches, restaurants, night
life.
Harlem, for one, is now ag
gressively trying to change
that. The Uptown Chamber of
Commerce is sponsoring an ef
fort to roll out the welcome
mat to outsiders in the belief
that this will benefit the
downtrodden area far more
than some new government
program.
The centerpiece of the effort
is a tourist map and brochure
to be published next month by
the chamber. About 100,000 of
them will be sent to hotels in
New York City and to travel
agents elsewhere. The map
and brochure will pinpoint
over 70 things to see and do.
"This is the first tourist map
of Harlem in 56 years," says,
William Rogers, the chamber's
program director.
"But tourism isn't necessar
ily the focal point. It is
economic development.
Rather than starting a new fed
eral program that costs a lot of
money, we've packaged what
is already here . . . the land
marks, the night spots, the
museums," he said in an inter
view.
The hope is that tourism
could lessen outsiders' bad
vibes about Harlem and re
build residents' pride. But
most important, says Rogers, is
a belief that new outside in
terest would force the city to
boost the area's police and
sanitation services and
schools.
"The last thing the police
would want is to have a Euro
pean diplomat come in and get
'iced' on 125th Street," says
Rogers.
There is evidence that out
side interest is there, waiting to
be tapped. Harlem is famous
worldwide. A recent survey
found it the best-known
neighborhood to non-New

Yorkers, with Greenwich Vil
lage second.
For more than a decade, the
black-owned Penny Sightse
eing Co. has taken busloads of
foreign and American visitors
to Harlem to see the desolation
of 115 th Street and the beauti
ful rowhouses of Sugar Hill.
Tourists see the Morris
Jumel mansion, built in 1765,
where George Washington

had his revolutionary head
quarters; the Schomberg Lib
rary, and nation's largest col
lection of black literature and
history; and the house where
the black actor Paul Robeson
once lived.
"Harlem has gotten so much
adverse publicity, but after the
tour people realize it's part of
the city. They see it for them
selves," says Penelope Ruffin.
