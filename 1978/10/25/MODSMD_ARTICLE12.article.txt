"It was the best work experi
ence I've ever had," said Steve
Lewis, co-president of
Stanford-in-Business, describ
ing his summerinternshipwith
Standard Oil of California.
Stanford-in-Business, a
student-run organization, was
created to aid undergraduates
in finding internships and in
creating contacts in the busi
ness world.
According to co-president
Lola Nashashibi, one of the
group's main purposes is to
help students find internships.
The program also offers a cent
ral organization from which
students can gain information
about business.

"We want to offer these ser
vices to everybody, regardless
of what their academic pursuits
are," Nashashibi emphasized.
Nashashibi said that one of
the group's goals this year is to
"gear the activity towards stu
dents interests." For example,
a great deal of interest has
been expressed in interna
tional finance, so an effort will
be made to center programs
and internships around this
theme.
Stanford-in-Business has
three committees which spon
sor speakers from the business

community and bring directors
of admissions from business
schools to talk to under
graduates here.
According to Nashashibi,
appointments with admissions
directors from the top 10 busi
ness schools in the country
have already been arranged.
The next of these will be on
Nov. 15, featuring representa
tives from Wharton and Har
vard Universities.
Internships
Summer Management In
ternship Program (SMIP), is
the committee within
Stanford-in-Business which
helps students find intern
ships. SMIP contacts corpora
tions in the United States to
help students seeking summer
positions.
Last year SMIP arranged 16
student internships, and hopes
to arrange at least 40 intern
ships this year, said
Nashashibi.
Lytton, Pan Am Airlines,
Standard Oil of California and
Fireman's Fund Insurance are
some of the corporations
which employed student in
terns last year.
Lewis, who got his intern
ship through Stanford-in-
Business, said, "The experi
ence you get on these intern
ships is just incredible. I was

doing things that MBA's are do
ing."
"Since these are very major
corporations, almost all our in
terns have job offers at any
time," he added.
Lewis estimated that the av
erage salary for the interns last
summer was about $950 a
month.
So far this year about 120
people have joined the group,
said Nashashibi.
To become a member, a stu
dent must submit a registration
form and pay a $3 fee. The
forms are part of a Stanford
in-Business packet available at
the CPPC.
Enthusiasm
Nashashibi said she thought
that the enthusiasm at the first
meeting was very high.
She also said she would like
to see all members of the

group involved in a committee
of some sort, because regard
less of a person's major or in
terests, "there is a place for
everybody."
According to Nashashibi,
Stanford-in-Business was
founded approximately 15
years ago, and was the first or
ganization of its kind on a col
lege campus. Between 1965
and 1968, the group "was at its
height," but during the early
'70s, interest waned.
Nashashibi said with the in
creased student interest in
preparing for business-related
jobs in recent years, the group
has revived. She added that
well organized leadership has
helped the organization regain
strength.
Stanford-in-Business re
ceives funds from several diffe
rent sources.

Last year SMIP arranged 16
student internships, and hopes
to arrange at least 40 intern

Nashashibi.
Lytton, Pan Am Airlines,
Standard Oil of California and
Fireman's Fund Insurance are
some of the corporations
which employed student in
terns last year.
Lewis, who got his intern
ship through Stanford-in-
Business, said, "The experi
ence you get on these intern
ships is just incredible. I was

doing things that MBA's are do
ing."
"Since these are very major
corporations, almost all our in
terns have job offers at any
time," he added.
Lewis estimated that the av
erage salary for the interns last
summer was about $950 a
month.
So far this year about 120
people have joined the group,
said Nashashibi.
To become a member, a stu
dent must submit a registration
form and pay a $3 fee. The
forms are part of a Stanford
in-Business packet available at
the CPPC.
Enthusiasm
Nashashibi said she thought
that the enthusiasm at the first
meeting was very high.
She also said she would like
to see all members of the

group involved in a committee
of some sort, because regard
less of a person's major or in
terests, "there is a place for
everybody."
According to Nashashibi,
Stanford-in-Business was
founded approximately 15
years ago, and was the first or
ganization of its kind on a col
lege campus. Between 1965
and 1968, the group "was at its
height," but during the early
'70s, interest waned.
Nashashibi said with the in
creased student interest in
preparing for business-related
jobs in recent years, the group
has revived. She added that
well organized leadership has
helped the organization regain
strength.

"We want to offer these ser
vices to everybody, regardless
of what their academic pursuits
are," Nashashibi emphasized.
Nashashibi said that one of
the group's goals this year is to
"gear the activity towards stu
dents interests." For example,
a great deal of interest has
been expressed in interna
tional finance, so an effort will
be made to center programs
and internships around this
theme.
Stanford-in-Business has
three committees which spon
sor speakers from the business

community and bring directors
of admissions from business
schools to talk to under
graduates here.
According to Nashashibi,
appointments with admissions
directors from the top 10 busi
ness schools in the country
have already been arranged.
The next of these will be on
Nov. 15, featuring representa
