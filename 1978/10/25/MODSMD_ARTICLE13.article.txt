## Defeat Proposition 7 
### 
John Briggs, sponsor of the anti-gay initiative,
is also bringing us on the November ballot
Proposition 7, the initiative to strengthen the
death penalty. Opinion polls show that this
measure enjoys overwhelming support.
The turnaround in popular attitude towards
capital punishment in the last decade is based
largely on a rejection of the arguments com
monly given against the death penalty. That re
jection is well-founded. For example:
1) It is not true that it is never right to take a
human life: absolute pacifism is morally wrong.
Some people have so heinously violated the
rights of others that they have sacrificed their
own right to life. There are conceivable situa
tions in which innocent lives can be protected
only by taking the life of an aggressor.
2) The death penalty is not cruel or unusual:
indeed it will be unusual only if it is not used
with the frequency that many of its proponents
desire.
3) The claim that punishment has no deter
rent effect is absurd. Everyday experience
shows that people's actions are often — though
not invariably — affected by foreseeable con
sequences.
4) Nor is it right to attribute a person's crime
to society or to his environment rather than con
sidering the person himself. To attribute crime
to poverty or racism not only betrays an ignor
ance of the historical evidence to the contrary,
but it is also an insult to an overwhelming
number of poor and minorities. It is a subtle
form of racism implying that all poor or minority
people are in fact latent criminals.
These discussions of the fallacy of common
arguments against the death penalty does not,
however, prove that the death penalty is desira
ble.
No judicial system is infallible: if the death
penalty is applied with any frequency, some in
nocent persons will be executed. If a person is
unjustly fined or imprisoned, some compensa
tion, may be possible; capital punishment,
however, is obviously final in a way that no other
form of punishment is.
This objection might be overriden if a vigor
ous application of the death penalty was the
only way to protect the lives and safety of the

public. It is not the only way.
For example, laws against victimless crimes
should be repealed so that police, courts and
prisons can concentrate on real criminals.
Juveniles should be tried and punished as
adults. The parole system should be ended and
determinate sentencing strengthened.
In reaction against the inanities of liberal
penology, the public has settled on the death
penalty as an emotional symbol of its anger. It is
a bad symbol.
The voting process (and representative gov
ernment in general) causes a separation bet
ween responsibility and action. A citizen who
would never personally kill another in cold
blood can be the seemingly trivial action of
marking a ballot help cause the same effect. If
every supporter of the death penalty knew that
he would have to personally pull the trigger or
throw the switch, the ranks of those willing to
defend capital punishment would thin consid
erably.
The true irony of this issue, and the best
reason for opposing capital punishment, can be
seen in the contrast between the people's deci
sion on Proposition 13 in June and their likely
decision on Proposition 7 this November.
In passing Proposition 13, the people of
California decided — and rightly so — that they
did not trust state and local officials with the
power to set their tax rates.
But to support capital punishment is to advo
cate giving the legislature, the governor, and the
judicial system the power of life and death.
If we cannot trust these people to set our tax
rates, how dare we trust them with this far more
awesome power?
It is especially ironic that conservatives, who
pay lip-service to opposing the power of gov
ernment, are the strongest supporters of capital
punishment.
The politicians, the lawyers, and the judges
should not be trusted with that kind of power.
Those who value liberty and oppose omnipo
tent government should oppose this initiative.
Proposition 7 deserves to be defeated by the
people of California on November 7.

a Daily columnist.)

John Briggs, sponsor of the anti-gay initiative,
is also bringing us on the November ballot
Proposition 7, the initiative to strengthen the
death penalty. Opinion polls show that this
measure enjoys overwhelming support.
The turnaround in popular attitude towards
capital punishment in the last decade is based
largely on a rejection of the arguments com
monly given against the death penalty. That re
jection is well-founded. For example:
1) It is not true that it is never right to take a
human life: absolute pacifism is morally wrong.
Some people have so heinously violated the
rights of others that they have sacrificed their
own right to life. There are conceivable situa
tions in which innocent lives can be protected
only by taking the life of an aggressor.
2) The death penalty is not cruel or unusual:
indeed it will be unusual only if it is not used
with the frequency that many of its proponents
desire.
3) The claim that punishment has no deter
rent effect is absurd. Everyday experience
shows that people's actions are often — though
not invariably — affected by foreseeable con
sequences.
4) Nor is it right to attribute a person's crime
to society or to his environment rather than con
sidering the person himself. To attribute crime
to poverty or racism not only betrays an ignor
ance of the historical evidence to the contrary,
but it is also an insult to an overwhelming
number of poor and minorities. It is a subtle
form of racism implying that all poor or minority
people are in fact latent criminals.
These discussions of the fallacy of common
arguments against the death penalty does not,
however, prove that the death penalty is desira
ble.
No judicial system is infallible: if the death
penalty is applied with any frequency, some in
nocent persons will be executed. If a person is
unjustly fined or imprisoned, some compensa
tion, may be possible; capital punishment,
however, is obviously final in a way that no other
form of punishment is.
This objection might be overriden if a vigor
ous application of the death penalty was the
only way to protect the lives and safety of the

public. It is not the only way.
For example, laws against victimless crimes
should be repealed so that police, courts and
prisons can concentrate on real criminals.
Juveniles should be tried and punished as
adults. The parole system should be ended and
determinate sentencing strengthened.
In reaction against the inanities of liberal
penology, the public has settled on the death
penalty as an emotional symbol of its anger. It is
a bad symbol.
The voting process (and representative gov
ernment in general) causes a separation bet
ween responsibility and action. A citizen who
would never personally kill another in cold
blood can be the seemingly trivial action of
marking a ballot help cause the same effect. If
every supporter of the death penalty knew that
he would have to personally pull the trigger or
throw the switch, the ranks of those willing to
defend capital punishment would thin consid
erably.
The true irony of this issue, and the best
reason for opposing capital punishment, can be
seen in the contrast between the people's deci
sion on Proposition 13 in June and their likely
decision on Proposition 7 this November.
In passing Proposition 13, the people of
California decided — and rightly so — that they
did not trust state and local officials with the
power to set their tax rates.
But to support capital punishment is to advo
cate giving the legislature, the governor, and the
judicial system the power of life and death.
If we cannot trust these people to set our tax
rates, how dare we trust them with this far more
awesome power?
It is especially ironic that conservatives, who
pay lip-service to opposing the power of gov
ernment, are the strongest supporters of capital
punishment.
The politicians, the lawyers, and the judges
should not be trusted with that kind of power.
Those who value liberty and oppose omnipo
tent government should oppose this initiative.
Proposition 7 deserves to be defeated by the
people of California on November 7.
