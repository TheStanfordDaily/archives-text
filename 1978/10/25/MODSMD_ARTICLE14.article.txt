## Ginny Puddefoot Abortion best alternative 
### 
The recent rebuttal to my ar
ticle supporting choice in the
matter of abortion (Daily, Oct.
13) begs for a reply. Since Barry
Neyer, Rosemary Storm, Mary
)o Pruner and Chris Van Wyk
(Daily, Oct. 20) not only ig
nored the points of my article,
but also personally attacked
me, I must remind them of
several things.
Their statement: "Her col
umn was so filled with distor
tion and misrepresentation,"
which none of them felt the
need to clarify, is a case in
point. Why didn't they pin
point these "distortions?" Why
not call me on each "misrep
resentation," instead of leav
ing it at that emotional
blanket-statement? The reason
Nyer, Storm, Pruner and Van
Wyk did not cite examples to
support their claims is that
there is no distortion in what I
said. Is it not true that the anti
choice group is a small minor
ity? That many of these groups
are also opposed to pre-marital
sex? Can they deny the huge
funding from the Catholic
Church? Or justify the highly
immoral ways that anti-choice
groups have shown their be
liefs?
In the case of vocabulary, I
must again remind these writ
ers of several things. Our posi
tion is "prochoice" (instead of
'Pro-abortion' as they'd like to
say) for a basic and very simple
reason, which I made clear in

my first article. No one is for
abortion; at best, it's a bad sol
ution to a horrible situation.
But it is often the least harmful
or destructive solution, and
therefore a necessary choice. I
state in my column: "I am in no
way advocating forced abor
tion for any woman" and
again: "I can assure these
groups that abortion is never
easy." How Neyer, Storm,
Pruner and Van Wyk managed
to get "pro-abortion" out of
that is a mystery to me, and
something that they felt was
unnecessary to clarify.
As for "product of concep
tion" vs. "unborn child," this
may be the one area in which
we agree. Product of concep
tion is a new one to me and I
find it as inappropriate as they
do. Instead, in my article, I too
prefer the term "fetus," which
if they might have discovered
had they read more
thoroughly.
From this point, the writers
"confine their discussion to
the crucial issue. They clamber
up on the soap-box and words
like ". . . slavery. . . Nazis . . .
childabuse. . ."starttumbling
down. They contend that the
main issue is the humanity of
the fetus; I maintain that they
key issue is the humanity of the
mother and her right to
choose. And in all this talk of
moral rights, what about the
rights of the mother? It's not
her fault exclusively that she

got pregnant. Would Neyer,
Storm, Pruner and Van Wyk
demand equal punishment for
the man involved?
One final point I would make
is related to that wonderful
phrase "all respectable people
agree that these things are
wrong . . "Respectable
people" â€” just who are they?
Obviously not women who ad
vocate choice; but where does
one draw the line? Perhaps
"respectable people" refers to
those whose beliefs are identi
cal to theirs? This is exactly the
characterization I was referring
to in my first article (". . . we
are not the immoral, callous,
unfeeling women that the an
tichoice groups like to charac
terize us as"). Thanks for a
prime example.
Finally, I would say that I re
spect the rights of the writers
to live by their moral stan
dards. However, since "the
courts cannot determine what
is moral" (and neither can
Neyer, Storm, Pruner and Van
Wyk), they will have to recog
nize my rights to live by my
morals, too ... or be guilty of
moral repression themselves.
