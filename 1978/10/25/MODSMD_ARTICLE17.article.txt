## Student advising at Trancos 
### 
An article in the Daily (Oct. 4) entitled
"Peer advising may answer student
needs" focused on current impressions of
the new student advising program in Tran
cos. It did not, however, discuss the prog
ram in detail. This article attempts to de
scribe the student advising program and
its goals.
Although the term "new" was used to
describe this system of peer advising in
Trancos, the idea of student advising has
had a long history at the University.
Organizations such as The Bridge, the
Learning Assistance Center and the
Human Biology Program have used up
perclass students as advisors to such an
extent that they have now become an in
tegral and valuable part of these programs.
The pilot project at Trancos also utilizes
the idea of peer advising, by systematically
pairing upperclass students, called advis
ing associates, with experienced faculty/
staff advisors for the difficult job of advis
ing first year students.
Simply stated, this project seeks to in
crease students' satisfaction with
academic advising at the University. By
making use of both faculty/staff and stu
dents, the program provides freshpeople
with two sources of information, support
and guidance. Faculty and staff members
are uniquely capable of providing their
advisees with a long term view of the Uni
versity's resources and its educational be
nefits. They can also help students in mak
ing important career decisions. Upper
class students, on the other hand, are
more likely to be familiar with many diffe
rent parts of the University, knowledge
able in the "nuts and bolts" of being a

student (e.g. registration and reading a
Time Schedule) and are able to deal with
their advisees on a more friendly and in
formal basis.
The goal of this program is not to replace
faculty/staff advising but to complement it.
The advising associates will try to facilitate
closer faculty-advisee contact by provid
ing additional information and support to
both the faculty/staff advisors and to the
students.
Michel and Pat Nabti, the Resident Fel
lows in Trancos, recognized the need for
improving the current advising system and
enthusiastically supported the idea of in
tegrating students into their advising
program. With the support of Alexander
Fetter, the associate dean of under
graduate studies, 10 upperclass students
were selected last spring to be advising
associates for this school year.
The advising associates were chosen to
represent the five academic interest areas:
Humanities, Social Sciences, Math/
Science/Technology, Engineering and
Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental. The Academic In
formation Center arranged the students in
Trancos according to expressed academic
interests and assigned each of them to a
faculty/staff advisor and an advising as
sociate with similar academic interests. In
September, 10 "advising teams," e£ich
consisting of a faculty/staff advisor and an
advising associate, met the incoming frosh
at Trancos.
Even before the frosh arrived, however,
all 10 advising associates took part in a
week long orientation program. This prog
ram, which was funded by Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, had three
goals: (1) to provide the advising as

sociates with information concerning the
University's policies and facilities, (2) to
improve the student advisors' counseling
skills and (3) to discuss the role of a stu
dent advisor within the current advising
system.
Speakers during this orientation prog
ram included Art Pacheco, assistant pro
fessor in the School of Education and a
resident fellow in Zapata; Dr. David Doro
sin, director of Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services; Elizabeth Meyer, director of
A.1.C.; as well as individuals from the
L.A.C., C.P.P.C., Overseas Studies,
Academic Standing, the Office of Student
Activities and various other ex
tradepartmental programs. In addition,
during this week the advising associates
met the resident staff at Trancos and the
faculty/staff advisors they would be work
ing with during the upcoming school year.
A SCI RE task force, consisting of faculty,
administrators and students, is currently
evaluating the success of the orientation
program and the effectiveness of the pro
ject itself. Should the Trancos advising
project prove worthwhile, it may be ex
panded to include other all-frosh houses
in subsequent years.
Advising freshpeople is a di«\cu\t usV.
and no one system can resolve all the
problems that might arise. The pilot pro
ject in Trancos is an attempt to alleviate
some of the weaknesses advising has evi
denced in the past.

and Psychology and is co-coordinator of
the pilot advising program in Trancos.)
An article in the Daily (Oct. 4) entitled
"Peer advising may answer student
needs" focused on current impressions of
the new student advising program in Tran
cos. It did not, however, discuss the prog
ram in detail. This article attempts to de
scribe the student advising program and
its goals.
Although the term "new" was used to
describe this system of peer advising in
Trancos, the idea of student advising has
had a long history at the University.
Organizations such as The Bridge, the
Learning Assistance Center and the
Human Biology Program have used up
perclass students as advisors to such an
extent that they have now become an in
tegral and valuable part of these programs.
The pilot project at Trancos also utilizes
the idea of peer advising, by systematically
pairing upperclass students, called advis
ing associates, with experienced faculty/
staff advisors for the difficult job of advis
ing first year students.
Simply stated, this project seeks to in
crease students' satisfaction with
academic advising at the University. By
making use of both faculty/staff and stu
dents, the program provides freshpeople
with two sources of information, support
and guidance. Faculty and staff members
are uniquely capable of providing their
advisees with a long term view of the Uni
versity's resources and its educational be
nefits. They can also help students in mak
ing important career decisions. Upper
class students, on the other hand, are
more likely to be familiar with many diffe
rent parts of the University, knowledge
able in the "nuts and bolts" of being a

student (e.g. registration and reading a
Time Schedule) and are able to deal with
their advisees on a more friendly and in
formal basis.
The goal of this program is not to replace
faculty/staff advising but to complement it.
The advising associates will try to facilitate
closer faculty-advisee contact by provid
ing additional information and support to
both the faculty/staff advisors and to the
students.
Michel and Pat Nabti, the Resident Fel
lows in Trancos, recognized the need for
improving the current advising system and
enthusiastically supported the idea of in
tegrating students into their advising
program. With the support of Alexander
Fetter, the associate dean of under
graduate studies, 10 upperclass students
were selected last spring to be advising
associates for this school year.
The advising associates were chosen to
represent the five academic interest areas:
Humanities, Social Sciences, Math/
Science/Technology, Engineering and
Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental. The Academic In
formation Center arranged the students in
Trancos according to expressed academic
interests and assigned each of them to a
faculty/staff advisor and an advising as
sociate with similar academic interests. In
September, 10 "advising teams," e£ich
consisting of a faculty/staff advisor and an
advising associate, met the incoming frosh
at Trancos.
Even before the frosh arrived, however,
all 10 advising associates took part in a
week long orientation program. This prog
ram, which was funded by Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, had three
goals: (1) to provide the advising as

sociates with information concerning the
University's policies and facilities, (2) to
improve the student advisors' counseling
skills and (3) to discuss the role of a stu
dent advisor within the current advising
system.
Speakers during this orientation prog
ram included Art Pacheco, assistant pro
fessor in the School of Education and a
resident fellow in Zapata; Dr. David Doro
sin, director of Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services; Elizabeth Meyer, director of
A.1.C.; as well as individuals from the
L.A.C., C.P.P.C., Overseas Studies,
Academic Standing, the Office of Student
Activities and various other ex
tradepartmental programs. In addition,
during this week the advising associates
met the resident staff at Trancos and the
faculty/staff advisors they would be work
ing with during the upcoming school year.
A SCI RE task force, consisting of faculty,
administrators and students, is currently
evaluating the success of the orientation
program and the effectiveness of the pro
ject itself. Should the Trancos advising
project prove worthwhile, it may be ex
panded to include other all-frosh houses
in subsequent years.
Advising freshpeople is a di«\cu\t usV.
and no one system can resolve all the
problems that might arise. The pilot pro
ject in Trancos is an attempt to alleviate
some of the weaknesses advising has evi
denced in the past.
