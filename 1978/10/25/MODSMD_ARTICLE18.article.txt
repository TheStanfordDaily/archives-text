## Avoid letting others do the thinking 
### 
There is an old saying: "Liberals always travel in groups, some
what like wary sheep, whereas conservatives, like the lonely
eagle, are to be found only in solitude." This quote holds true
especially today, specifically concerning some of the most impor
tant issues facing America and students of the University campus.
Since the '60s, a new trend has been developing in America,
especially among the young — that of "sheepish liberalism." By
this is meant the general attitude, usually aroused by complacent
apathy, of extreme laissez-faire in regards to freedom. There is a
sentiment prevalent among liberals and non-politically-minded
people that all freedom must be good freedom. In an over
compensating reaction to the events and revelations of the past
eight years, a lazy, non-investigative approach to issues has been
set up in a liberal framework.

Good examples of this attitude are shown in the response given
to the abortion issue and the Briggs' initiative. Afraid to be
branded "reactionary" or even "unprogressive," Americans are
falling into the trap of not thinking for themselves, and allowing
"absolute freedom for all" activists to pull their minds from
serious consideration into a generally slogan-shouting, pre
determined morality campaign. Concerning the abortion issue
specifically, the public is led to believe by the liberals that, along
lines of liberty for women, based groundlessly on equal rights
advances, women should have "sole right" to their own bodies. If
the issue, however, is thought through carefully, and reasonable
morality of the matter is examined, this is proved to be an irreva
lent conclusion. ,
Certainly everyone has the right to his or her own body, and yet
doesn't a new life have just as much right as any woman, deserv
ing even more protection under the law since it can't defend
itself? Some contend that a fetus isn't "really alive." If not, what is
a fetus? Half alive? A plant? A vegetable? Some sort of half animal?
It seems reasonable to assume that something is either entirely
human or not human, and so far science has not been able to
produce a "half-life." It also seems a little out of proportion to
insist on enforcing equal rights for women who cannot exert
self-control. Yet this is not the issue. In this age of responsibility,
society should be aiming toward a recognition and enforcement
of personal responsibility, instead of providing every possible
outlet through which one can escape the consequences of an
action.
As for the Briggs' initiative, this "sheepish liberalism" has man
dated that homosexuals are being oppressed and being mer
cilessly deprived of their freedom. With the invocation of "free
dom, the quick scurrying begins. Immediately we all assume a
very tolerant, "liberal" attitude toward homosexuality. What is
being decided by the Briggs' initiative, however, is not whether
homosexuals will or will not be free: they already have their
freedom. What will be decided will be whether or not we will
have the right to make of our society what we want it to be. Our
system is based on the principle of majority rule, and it seems
obvious that the vast majority of society should be able to deter
mine the ethics of the society. Being able to prevent our children
from being introduced to a way of life with which we disagree
should be a basic tenet of the "freedom" of the majority. In being
over-scrupulous about the "freedom" of every minority, the
majority eventually will lose its own freedom. If we lose the right
to shape our society, the purpose of government seems to slip
away.
Socrates once said that an unexamined life is not worth living.
As with the issue of abortion and the Briggs' initiative, let us not
become too reconciled to letting others do the thinking for us. It
is so easy to be caught up in the Zeitgeist. Our country was based
on freedom — freedom for the individual to think for himself, not
collectively.
It is so easy to fall into platitudes such as "every woman has the
right to her own body," or "Anita Bryant is a reactionary." Just
remember that liberals do not have as much sway over you as you
think they do. Under the guise of freedom, they have enslaved
the minds of all who cannot think for themselves, making us aM
carbon copies of a supposed "free-thinking" person. Don't be
afraid to be a lonely eagle every once and a while. The cool, clean
air up there makes one feel much better than the dust stirred up
by a "follow-the-leader" stampede.
