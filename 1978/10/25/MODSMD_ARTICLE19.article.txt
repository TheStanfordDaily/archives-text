Decision to obey
conscience
The letter of Neyer, Storm,
Pruner and Van Wyk in last Fri
day's Daily was one of the less
emotional statements of the
anti-abortion position. For this
reason I feel all the more com
pelled to answer it, because
their discussion is incomplete.
Humans have the responsi
bility to make the best deci
sions they can when faced with
life's dilemmas, weighing the
advice of their intellectual and
religious traditions. We may
therefore decide that an abor
tion is preferable to bringing
into a crowded world a child
we know will be deformed, or
one conceived through incest
or rape, or one we know can
not be given the care and love
that allows a human soul to
grow. I know these authors
feel differently about these
questions. But if we allow them
to coerce us into acting con
trary to our beliefs, then, as Sir
Thomas More says in Robert
Bolt's play A Man for All Sea
sons, "When you go to heaven
for following your conscience,
and I go to nell for disobeying
mine, will you come along with
me. . . ?"
There are cases where soci
ety must leave the determina
tion of good and evil to indi
vidual conscience. A believer
in the sanctity of life might,
after all, want to legislate veg

etarianism, and that would be a
strange preoccupation for our
government, whatever the
proposal's merits.

Daily misquote
Law School Dean Charles
Myers' (Daily letters, Oct. 20)
hope that the October 18th ar
ticle on affirmative action "is
more accurate in other re
spects that it is about the Law
School" is, unfortunately, in
vain.
I too was called by your re
porter and misquoted twice
regarding external affirmative
action. First, when asked what
the University could do if a
contractor failed to comply
with affirmative action re
quirements of a contract, I
stated that the contract could
be canceled for non
compliance. I did not say that
"the University often refuses
contracts to contractors with
poor affirmative action re
cords."
Second, when discussing
apprentice training programs, I
pointed out that minority
workers in laborer classifica
tions often have seniority and
earn more than apprentices in
the skilled trades. This makes it
difficult for a minority worker
to move into an apprentice
training program. I did not
state that "the University is
working to solve this problem

by 'urging higher pay for ap
prentices.' "

Daily Theater
reviewer praised
High praise to one of your
theater reviewers.
While those around her wal
lowed in over
intellectualization and long
winded mindlessness, Karen
Wada (in her Bubbling Brown
Sugar piece, Daily, Oct. 17)
wrote with simplicity and bril
liance. The ability to cut to the
heart of a production is much
treasured in this business.
Wada did so, with a wonderful
gift of words and anecdotes
(especially her description of
Charles Coles, whom I have
seen many times, so I know
whereof she speaks).
She displays a strong under
standing of not only what thea
ter is, but of how it works.
