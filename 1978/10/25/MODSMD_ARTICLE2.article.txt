# Continual questioning disrupts noon speech
## 
### ANNE BOWDEN 
Continuous questioning from rep
resentatives of the Iranian Students'
Association prevented Prof. Sepehr
Zabih from speaking yesterday at the
Bechtel International Center's Tues
day luncheon series.
Zabih, the chairman of the De
partment of Government at St.
Mary's College, was to have spoken
about "Iran: Causes and Effects of
the Contemporary Political Crisis."
However, while l-Center Director
Lee Zeigler was making the introduc
tion, Iranian students in the audi
ence repeatedly requested that
Zabih address specific policies the
Shah of Iran has adopted upon decla
ration of martial law in that country.
Zeigler and other members of the
audience asked the students to be
quiet and Zeigler explained that
questions would be encouraged
after the speech, but the students
continued to shout questions. After
20 minutes of calling for order,
Zeigler announced the discon
tinuance of the luncheon and
apologized for Zabih not having
been able to speak.
Several of the students carried
signs that stated, "Down with U.S.
intervention" and "Stop U.S. military
intervention in Iran."
According to Zeigler, Tuesday's
incident was the first time an
l-Center speaker has been unable to
speak in the four-year history of the
luncheon series.
"It's unfortunate that there wasn't
an opportunity for a full forum of all
points of view," Zeigler said after
wards. He added that the luncheon
"could have become a creative op
portunity" for the Iranian students if
they had not caused a "disruption
that forced a cut-off of the program."
Zeigler explained that the format
of the luncheon was such that if the
students had waited until after the
speech, Zabih would have been ob
liged to answer their questions.
Members of the Iranian Students'
Association, B. Azad and A. Ehia said
that their group "did not intend to

disrupt the luncheon."
They said that they had wanted to
impress upon Zabih, "before he
spoke about generalities" the need
to inform the audience of his "sup
port of the Shah and his (the Shah's)
single-party Fascist regime."
"We wanted Aabih to speak about
his involvement with the Shah's re
gime and incidents of torture and
mass murder that have taken place in

Iran. We wanted him (Zabih) to ad
dress the issues of U.S. and CIA in
tervention." Azah and Ehia said that
their group would have allowed
Zabih to speak if he had addressed
those issues.
Other members of the audience
left the luncheon telling the Iranian
students that free speech was a right
of any one in America. One man told
an Iranian student that "those who
were undecided about supporting
the Shah may decide to do so, now."
"They made a tactical error today,"
said another student, referring to the
Iranian Student Association's be
havior.
"Zeigler said he wanted "all sides
to feel free to voice their opinions."
He added that he had not known that
Zabih had supported the Shah's re
gime when he invited Zabih to speak,
but that "it could have been an op
portunity for a very creative ex
change."
According to Zeigler, Zabih's only
comment as he left the l-Center was
"I'm sorry."

Bechtel International Center's Tues
day luncheon series.
Zabih, the chairman of the De
partment of Government at St.
Mary's College, was to have spoken
about "Iran: Causes and Effects of
the Contemporary Political Crisis."
However, while l-Center Director
Lee Zeigler was making the introduc
tion, Iranian students in the audi
ence repeatedly requested that
Zabih address specific policies the
Shah of Iran has adopted upon decla
ration of martial law in that country.
Zeigler and other members of the
audience asked the students to be
quiet and Zeigler explained that
questions would be encouraged
after the speech, but the students
continued to shout questions. After
20 minutes of calling for order,
Zeigler announced the discon
tinuance of the luncheon and
apologized for Zabih not having
been able to speak.
Several of the students carried
signs that stated, "Down with U.S.
intervention" and "Stop U.S. military
intervention in Iran."
According to Zeigler, Tuesday's
incident was the first time an
l-Center speaker has been unable to
speak in the four-year history of the
luncheon series.
"It's unfortunate that there wasn't
an opportunity for a full forum of all
points of view," Zeigler said after
wards. He added that the luncheon
"could have become a creative op
portunity" for the Iranian students if
they had not caused a "disruption
that forced a cut-off of the program."
Zeigler explained that the format
of the luncheon was such that if the
students had waited until after the
speech, Zabih would have been ob
liged to answer their questions.
Members of the Iranian Students'
Association, B. Azad and A. Ehia said
that their group "did not intend to

disrupt the luncheon."
They said that they had wanted to
impress upon Zabih, "before he
spoke about generalities" the need
to inform the audience of his "sup
port of the Shah and his (the Shah's)
single-party Fascist regime."
"We wanted Aabih to speak about
his involvement with the Shah's re
gime and incidents of torture and
mass murder that have taken place in

Iran. We wanted him (Zabih) to ad
dress the issues of U.S. and CIA in
tervention." Azah and Ehia said that
their group would have allowed
Zabih to speak if he had addressed
those issues.
Other members of the audience
left the luncheon telling the Iranian
students that free speech was a right
of any one in America. One man told
an Iranian student that "those who
were undecided about supporting
the Shah may decide to do so, now."
"They made a tactical error today,"
said another student, referring to the
Iranian Student Association's be
havior.
"Zeigler said he wanted "all sides
to feel free to voice their opinions."
He added that he had not known that
Zabih had supported the Shah's re
gime when he invited Zabih to speak,
but that "it could have been an op
portunity for a very creative ex
change."
According to Zeigler, Zabih's only
comment as he left the l-Center was
"I'm sorry."
