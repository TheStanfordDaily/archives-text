# Local excommunicated Catholic supports abortion, birth control
## 
### STEPHANIE POGGI 
Several weeks ago, a pro-abortion rally
was held in White Plaza. That's not so un
usual. Many individuals, including stu
dents and faculty here spoke on the issue.
That also is fairly common.
Then John Duryea, once chaplain at
Memorial Church and a Catholic, moved
to the microphone to speak in favor of
abortion. That is not so usual.
Duryea is married, supports some forms
of birth control and disagrees with the
Catholic Church's criticism of divorce.
Duryea has been excommunicated from
the Catholic Church.
Several years ago, Duryea met a Los
Angeles woman, Eve De Bona. The two
were married in June 1976. On the day of
the marriage, Joseph McGucken, ar
chbishop of San Francisco then, sent a let
ter telling Duryea he had been excom
municated. "The letter was so incongru
ous it was almost laughable," Duryea said.
In January 1975, Duryea spoke with
McGucken. "He was fatherly and under
standing . . . but then again, really com
pletely without understanding about my
decision. He told me to get away from
Eve's influence."
'Misguided Church'
The Catholic Church "expects a person
to go through laicization," Duryea said.
Laicization is a formal process in which the

priest denounces his priesthood. The
Church "then blesses the marriage. But it
just wasn't important for me to have the
Church, in her misguided benevolence,
bless the marriage," he said. Hence,
Duryea was excommunicated.
When an individual has been excom
municated, he is no longer acknowledged
by the Catholic Church and should not
preach the doctrines of the Church,
Duryea said. "I just say 'phooey' to that.
My choice to marry should not keep me
from preaching the teachings I have
learned," he added.
Duryea, who had preached at Mem Chu
and served as chaplain there for 15 years,
decided to continue working as a priest.
He currently serves as pastor of the Bay
Area Angelo Roncalli community, and
preaches at the University Lutheran
Church on Stanford Avenue each Sunday.
'Disobeying'
"I am deliberately disobeying the
Church. It's like civil disobedience. When
you disagree with a law or think it is bad,
you do what you think is right anyway," he
said.
Duryea believes the Church must oper
ate "in a more fluid environment without
absolute doctrines," but he never consi
dered changing religions. "I am a
Catholic, perhaps not a very Roman one,
but a Catholic nonetheless," Duryea said.

Several years ago, Duryea expressed his
views to John Quinn, the archbishop of
San Francisco now. "I told him about my
views on birth control and divorce. I also
told him about my excommunication from
the Church. He gave me a typical response
saying 'We'll pray for you'. . . and a lot of
other nonsense.
"You just can't capture truth, seal it in
clear plastic and keep it forever. If it's fro
zen it becomes bone; you kill it,"he said.
"But I am still a Catholic. I believe the
teachings of Jesus Christ and I'm dedi
cated to communicating them. All the
other rules are completely unessential.
Reality
"We must respond to moral issues in the
reality in which we live, not by the reality
of past centuries."
Duryea said the most difficult aspect of
being excommunicated was dealing with
old friends who were "puzzled and scan
dalized." His friends saw his wife as a
"seductress who had stolen him.
Catholics feel that they own their priest,"
Duryea said. Duryea said that he still main
tains friendships with some of the people
he met while working at Mem Chu.
"We're friends but there's no longer any
professional relationship," he said.
Duryea now lives in Palo Alto with his
wife and two children.
