Touring the University in a 10,000-meter run, this woman and approximately 700 other runners
completed the first annual Stanford Run, sponsored by Delta Upsilon fraternity. Entry fees were
donated to two charities — the Guardsmen, which sends underprivileged children to area
summer camps, and the Bay Window, which raises money for needy famines. Numerous prizes
were awarded.
