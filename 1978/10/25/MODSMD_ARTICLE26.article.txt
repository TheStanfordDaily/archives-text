# Jumping dead car battery may be dangerous process
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — There's never a good time
for a dead battery, but for some reason they
usually pick the worst possible times to die.
When confronted with this situation, most
motorists will try to get things moving by
"jump" starting their car from a neighbor's auto
or that of a helpful passing motorist.
While jump starting can quickly solve the
problem, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) warns that it can also be
a dangerous procedure if not done with care.
One possible hazard — rare but possible — is
a battery explosion.
One type of explosion is caused when an ex
cessive charging rate releases hydrogen gas. If
there isn't enough ventilation a spark of flame
can ignite the gas.
So, the NHTSA urges using battery chargers
carefully and according to their instructions,
keeping plenty of ventilation around the battery
and keeping flames and sparks away from it.
Another type of explosion may occur if two
batteries are connected with their poles re
versed or if batteries of widely different voltages
are connected to one another, the agency says.
battery acid is the primary danger here, and
officials advise that if you get it,on your skin,
flush with water quickly. If this acid gets in the
eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes or
until medical attention is obtained. And get
medical help for your eyes.
Most automobile owner's manuals — not all
— contain directions for jump starting the vehi
cle. However, they do not all agree.

The safety agency notes that some cars have
special equipment for jump starting or are pro
vided with special battery hookups and require
a special jump start procedure. So, the first rule
is to follow the instructions in the owner's man
ual if you have one. Do not borrow a manual
from a different car.
If you have to jump start your auto from
another vehicle, make sure the batteries have
the same voltage. Here are some instructions
provided by the safety agency.
— Position the cars so the jumper cables will
reach but do not let them touch. If the cars
touch one another they will be grounded to
gether, a possible hazard.
— Put both autos in park for automatic trans
missions or neutral for manual ones.
— Apply parking brakes and shut off all acces
sories in both cars.
— Remove rings, metal watch bands and
other items which could cause an accidental
shock.
— Connect the positive red cable to the posi
tive battery terminals in both cars. These will be
identified by a red color or a plus sign, a or
"POS."
— Connect the negative black cable to the
negative terminal in the car with the good bat
tery and then to the negative terminal of the
discharged battery.
— Start the car with the good battery and then
start the one with the discharged battery.
— Disconnect the negative cable first.
