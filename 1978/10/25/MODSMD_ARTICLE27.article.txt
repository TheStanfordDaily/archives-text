vVhat's new at the Stanford Shopping
Center? Almost everything.
In June of 1976, the shopping center
embarked on an extensive program of ex
pansion and renovation. Now, 27 months
and several million dollars later, the shop
ping center has increased its leasing space
by over 80,000 square feet, more than
doubled its original number of stores and
services and updated the entire design of
the complex.
The cost of the project to modernize the
22-year-old, University-owned center was

$17 million, according to SSC General
Manager Jannette Biggerstaff.
The work on the shopping center has
been divided into four phases. The first
dealt with the renovation and moderniza
tion of the existing buildings. The second,
nearing completion in November or De
cember, includes the construction of two
new buildings.
The third phase will be finished by mid
-1979 and will add "smaller, unique shops
and stores and eating facilities," according
to Biggerstaff.
Soon to be added are such diverse offer
ings as "The Gap," "Yogurt Village,"
"Down Home Craft Show" and"The Great

Hot Dog Experience."
When complete, the complex will have
room for 122 new stores, restaurants,
banksand other services. Even though this
will double the number of facilities, the
new design has only increased building
space by 20 percent.
Decisions concerning the fourth phase
of construction will be made in the early
1980s.
With everything from Saks Fifth Avenue
to F.W. Woolworth Co., See's Candies to
Eat-Rite Nutrition Center, and anything
else in between, the new shopping center
seems to be in accordance with the old
saying, "Variety is the spice of life."
