# Kelsey, Campbell, Mouchawar spice up team
## Water polo success recipe: 3 freshmen, just add water 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
They say all bad things come
in threes, but don't tell that to
Dante Dettamanti, the coach of
Stanford's undefeated water
polo team.
This season the Cards have
found something great that
came in threes — freshmen.
Jody Campbell, Chris Kelsey
and Alan Mouchawar were
senior prep All-Americas in
high school last spring.
They were heavily recruited
by every major water polo
school in California, but they
all ended up here.
Kelsey, a graduate of Mira
Costa, echoed the feelings of
the group, saying, "The school
itself, in my estimation, was the
best out of all the schools I had
the choice of going to.
Academically it's superior and
the water polo program is one
of the best in the country."
All three of them played

against one another during
their high school careers,
especially Campbell and
Mouchawar, who hail from
Long Beach Wilson and Long
Beach Poly, respectively.
In September, they began
practicing with a Cardinal team
that featured four seniors — all
returning lettermen — and
three juniors, plus a huge
number of promising sopho
mores. Not exactly the most
encouraging situation forthree
freshmen trying to break into
the varsity lineup.
In short order, however,
Campbell and Kelsey became
starters and Mouchawar was
playing "one-half to three
quarters of every game," ac
cording to Dettamanti.
"I had no way of knowing
they were going to do this
well," said Dettamanti. "All
three have fit remarkably well
into the system. They've been

integrated so quickly, it's like
they've been playing together
for years."
Campbell, who was a
member of the senior national
team, has taken over the hole
position left vacant by
graduated Rick Johanssen and
already leads the team in as
sists. In addition, he has scored
a number of goals from that
position — something that is
difficult to do when you are
spending most of your time
getting fouled.
"Jody's really taken over the
hole position," said De
ttamanti. "He adds another
dimension to our game be
cause he can score out of the
hole as well. He's really good at
getting and holding position in
the hole and he's an excellent
passer. He's very mobile for a
hole man. Even if he's the last
man back down the pool, he
still gets in there."

Campbell said he had to
make some adjustments to the
different style of play.
"It's a lot more physical in
college. High school is just
kind of jungle ball, but here it's
a more advanced style of play,"
Campbell said.
"You've got to get used to
playing with the other guys,"
he added. "Everybody wants
the ball passed to them in a dif
ferent place — (for example)
Doug Burke likes it fairly high."
Mouchawar had similar feel
ings about the differences be
tween high school and college
play.
"It's a faster game," he said.
"You've got to be in better
shape. You don't find any real
weak players in college. In high
school, you find a 'Ralph' and
work on him, but college isn't
like that. Also, the goalies are a
lot better. All the better high
school players get together in

college so it's a higher caliber
of play."
"I had trouble at the start,"
he continued. "For a string of
about a week, I wasn't really
confident out there (in work
out). In high school there
aren't as many other good
players. Here there are so
many good players and our
workouts are a hell of a lot
more intense. The workouts
get just as physical as the
games."
All three agreed, however,
that the older players have
been "very helpful" and
"everyone's behind everyone
else."
"They picked everything up
so fast," Dettamanti said.
"We're really playing as a
team; there's no selfishness."
Of Mouchawar, Dettamanti
said, "Alan's not as experi
enced as JodyorChris, buthe's
been super coming off the

bench. He's an excellent out
side shooter—when he takes a
shot, it usually goes in."
No one became more aware
of that than California. In two
games against the Bears so far
this year, Mouchawar has
scored three goals — one of
which was the game-winner at
the Irvine tournament, netted
with 30 seconds left.
Kelsey has been a starter on
and off for most of the season.
Two weeks ago, he came off
the bench to score three goals
against UCLA and spark the
Cardinal offense enroute to a
12-2 victory.
"Chris has added a lot of
things to the team," said De
ttamanti. "For a freshman, he
very rarely makes mistakes.
He's very good on the fast
break — I'd say he gets half his
goals on it. He's had no trouble
adjusting to our system. The
system was madeforhim; itfits
Chris very well."
Kelsey said he really doesn't
miss the run-and-gun jungle
ball of high school water polo.
"My game's always been
more of a thinking game than
the run-and-gun. I like a game
where it involves thinking," he
said.
With the Cards tearing up
the Pacific-10 and all other
competitors this year, it's dif
ficult not to look ahead to the
NCAA championships, and
beyond.
"I think it would be great (to
win the NCAAs)," said

Mouchawar. "I don't think
there's a team that can touch
us. It would be great winning it
because you get one under,
your belt." ,
"The experience of being in
the NCAAs — you can't replace
it," agreed Kelsey. "But I don't
think of it as going in as
freshmen. To win is what's im
portant. All of us are looking
forward to getting there."
Campbell, though he agreed,
with his classmates, said, "If
you do well in the NCAAs it can
really help in recruiting, but
we've still got to take the
games one at a time."
With three years still to
come, the future beyond this
year's championships looks
even brighter.
"We've all said, at one time
or another, 'Look at the team
we're going to have next year,'
but you don't let it preoccupy
yourself. We want to win this
year," said Kelsey.
"Each of them makes us
more versatile because they
each do something well," said
"We will build our
team (over the next three
years) around these players. I
expect them to play even grea
ter roles in the future.
"Having these three guys,
plus the extra year of experi
ence and maturity for the older
players, makes our team much
stronger than last year," said
Dettamanti.
"And ! thought we were the
best team then."

different style of play.
"It's a lot more physical in
college. High school is just
kind of jungle ball, but here it's
a more advanced style of play,"
Campbell said.
"You've got to get used to
playing with the other guys,"
he added. "Everybody wants
the ball passed to them in a dif
ferent place — (for example)
Doug Burke likes it fairly high."
Mouchawar had similar feel
ings about the differences be
tween high school and college
play.
"It's a faster game," he said.
"You've got to be in better
shape. You don't find any real
weak players in college. In high
school, you find a 'Ralph' and
work on him, but college isn't
like that. Also, the goalies are a
lot better. All the better high
school players get together in

college so it's a higher caliber
of play."
"I had trouble at the start,"
he continued. "For a string of
about a week, I wasn't really
confident out there (in work
out). In high school there
aren't as many other good
players. Here there are so
many good players and our
workouts are a hell of a lot
more intense. The workouts
get just as physical as the
games."
All three agreed, however,
that the older players have
been "very helpful" and
"everyone's behind everyone
else."
"They picked everything up
so fast," Dettamanti said.
"We're really playing as a
team; there's no selfishness."
Of Mouchawar, Dettamanti
said, "Alan's not as experi
enced as JodyorChris, buthe's
been super coming off the

bench. He's an excellent out
side shooter—when he takes a
shot, it usually goes in."
No one became more aware
of that than California. In two
games against the Bears so far
this year, Mouchawar has
scored three goals — one of
which was the game-winner at
the Irvine tournament, netted
with 30 seconds left.
Kelsey has been a starter on
and off for most of the season.
Two weeks ago, he came off
the bench to score three goals
against UCLA and spark the
Cardinal offense enroute to a
12-2 victory.
"Chris has added a lot of
things to the team," said De
ttamanti. "For a freshman, he
very rarely makes mistakes.
He's very good on the fast
break — I'd say he gets half his
goals on it. He's had no trouble
adjusting to our system. The
system was madeforhim; itfits
Chris very well."
Kelsey said he really doesn't
miss the run-and-gun jungle
ball of high school water polo.
"My game's always been
more of a thinking game than
the run-and-gun. I like a game
where it involves thinking," he
said.
With the Cards tearing up
the Pacific-10 and all other
competitors this year, it's dif
ficult not to look ahead to the
NCAA championships, and
beyond.
"I think it would be great (to
win the NCAAs)," said

Mouchawar. "I don't think
there's a team that can touch
us. It would be great winning it
because you get one under,
your belt." ,
"The experience of being in
the NCAAs — you can't replace
it," agreed Kelsey. "But I don't
think of it as going in as
freshmen. To win is what's im
portant. All of us are looking
forward to getting there."
Campbell, though he agreed,
with his classmates, said, "If
you do well in the NCAAs it can
really help in recruiting, but
we've still got to take the
games one at a time."
With three years still to
come, the future beyond this
year's championships looks
even brighter.
"We've all said, at one time
or another, 'Look at the team
we're going to have next year,'
but you don't let it preoccupy
yourself. We want to win this
year," said Kelsey.
"Each of them makes us
more versatile because they
each do something well," said
"We will build our
team (over the next three
years) around these players. I
expect them to play even grea
ter roles in the future.
"Having these three guys,
plus the extra year of experi
ence and maturity for the older
players, makes our team much
stronger than last year," said
Dettamanti.
"And ! thought we were the
best team then."
They say all bad things come
in threes, but don't tell that to
Dante Dettamanti, the coach of
Stanford's undefeated water
polo team.
This season the Cards have
found something great that
came in threes — freshmen.
Jody Campbell, Chris Kelsey
and Alan Mouchawar were
senior prep All-Americas in
high school last spring.
They were heavily recruited
by every major water polo
school in California, but they
all ended up here.
Kelsey, a graduate of Mira
Costa, echoed the feelings of
the group, saying, "The school
itself, in my estimation, was the
best out of all the schools I had
the choice of going to.
Academically it's superior and
the water polo program is one
of the best in the country."
All three of them played

against one another during
their high school careers,
especially Campbell and
Mouchawar, who hail from
Long Beach Wilson and Long
Beach Poly, respectively.
In September, they began
practicing with a Cardinal team
that featured four seniors — all
returning lettermen — and
three juniors, plus a huge
number of promising sopho
mores. Not exactly the most
encouraging situation forthree
freshmen trying to break into
the varsity lineup.
In short order, however,
Campbell and Kelsey became
starters and Mouchawar was
playing "one-half to three
quarters of every game," ac
cording to Dettamanti.
"I had no way of knowing
they were going to do this
well," said Dettamanti. "All
three have fit remarkably well
into the system. They've been

integrated so quickly, it's like
they've been playing together
for years."
Campbell, who was a
member of the senior national
team, has taken over the hole
position left vacant by
graduated Rick Johanssen and
already leads the team in as
sists. In addition, he has scored
a number of goals from that
position — something that is
difficult to do when you are
spending most of your time
getting fouled.
"Jody's really taken over the
hole position," said De
ttamanti. "He adds another
dimension to our game be
cause he can score out of the
hole as well. He's really good at
getting and holding position in
the hole and he's an excellent
passer. He's very mobile for a
hole man. Even if he's the last
man back down the pool, he
still gets in there."

Campbell said he had to
make some adjustments to the
different style of play.
"It's a lot more physical in
college. High school is just
kind of jungle ball, but here it's

adjusting to our system. The
system was madeforhim; itfits
Chris very well."
Kelsey said he really doesn't
miss the run-and-gun jungle
ball of high school water polo.
"My game's always been
more of a thinking game than
the run-and-gun. I like a game
where it involves thinking," he
said.
With the Cards tearing up
the Pacific-10 and all other
competitors this year, it's dif
ficult not to look ahead to the
NCAA championships, and
beyond.
"I think it would be great (to
win the NCAAs)," said

Mouchawar. "I don't think
there's a team that can touch
us. It would be great winning it
because you get one under,
your belt." ,
"The experience of being in
the NCAAs — you can't replace
it," agreed Kelsey. "But I don't
think of it as going in as
freshmen. To win is what's im
portant. All of us are looking
forward to getting there."
Campbell, though he agreed,
with his classmates, said, "If
you do well in the NCAAs it can
really help in recruiting, but
we've still got to take the
games one at a time."
With three years still to
come, the future beyond this
year's championships looks
even brighter.
"We've all said, at one time
or another, 'Look at the team
we're going to have next year,'
but you don't let it preoccupy
yourself. We want to win this
year," said Kelsey.
"Each of them makes us
more versatile because they
each do something well," said
"We will build our
team (over the next three
years) around these players. I
expect them to play even grea
ter roles in the future.
"Having these three guys,
plus the extra year of experi
ence and maturity for the older
players, makes our team much
stronger than last year," said
Dettamanti.
"And ! thought we were the
best team then."
They say all bad things come
in threes, but don't tell that to
Dante Dettamanti, the coach of
Stanford's undefeated water
polo team.
This season the Cards have
found something great that
came in threes — freshmen.
Jody Campbell, Chris Kelsey
and Alan Mouchawar were
senior prep All-Americas in
high school last spring.
They were heavily recruited
by every major water polo
school in California, but they
all ended up here.
Kelsey, a graduate of Mira
Costa, echoed the feelings of
the group, saying, "The school
itself, in my estimation, was the
best out of all the schools I had
the choice of going to.
Academically it's superior and
the water polo program is one
of the best in the country."
All three of them played

against one another during
their high school careers,
especially Campbell and
Mouchawar, who hail from
Long Beach Wilson and Long
Beach Poly, respectively.
In September, they began
practicing with a Cardinal team
that featured four seniors — all
returning lettermen — and
three juniors, plus a huge
number of promising sopho
mores. Not exactly the most
encouraging situation forthree
freshmen trying to break into
the varsity lineup.
In short order, however,
Campbell and Kelsey became
starters and Mouchawar was
playing "one-half to three
quarters of every game," ac
cording to Dettamanti.
"I had no way of knowing
they were going to do this
well," said Dettamanti. "All
three have fit remarkably well
into the system. They've been

integrated so quickly, it's like
they've been playing together
for years."
Campbell, who was a
member of the senior national
team, has taken over the hole
position left vacant by
graduated Rick Johanssen and
already leads the team in as
sists. In addition, he has scored
a number of goals from that
position — something that is
difficult to do when you are
spending most of your time
getting fouled.
"Jody's really taken over the
hole position," said De
ttamanti. "He adds another
dimension to our game be
cause he can score out of the
hole as well. He's really good at
getting and holding position in
the hole and he's an excellent
passer. He's very mobile for a
hole man. Even if he's the last
man back down the pool, he
still gets in there."

Campbell said he had to
make some adjustments to the
different style of play.
"It's a lot more physical in
college. High school is just
kind of jungle ball, but here it's
a more advanced style of play,"
Campbell said.
"You've got to get used to
playing with the other guys,"
he added. "Everybody wants
the ball passed to them in a dif
ferent place — (for example)
Doug Burke likes it fairly high."
Mouchawar had similar feel
ings about the differences be
tween high school and college
play.
"It's a faster game," he said.
"You've got to be in better
shape. You don't find any real
weak players in college. In high
school, you find a 'Ralph' and
work on him, but college isn't
like that. Also, the goalies are a
lot better. All the better high
school players get together in

college so it's a higher caliber
of play."
"I had trouble at the start,"
he continued. "For a string of
about a week, I wasn't really
confident out there (in work
out). In high school there
aren't as many other good
players. Here there are so
many good players and our
workouts are a hell of a lot
more intense. The workouts
get just as physical as the
games."
All three agreed, however,
that the older players have
been "very helpful" and
"everyone's behind everyone
else."
"They picked everything up
so fast," Dettamanti said.
"We're really playing as a
team; there's no selfishness."
Of Mouchawar, Dettamanti
said, "Alan's not as experi
enced as JodyorChris, buthe's
been super coming off the

bench. He's an excellent out
side shooter—when he takes a
shot, it usually goes in."
No one became more aware
of that than California. In two
games against the Bears so far
this year, Mouchawar has
scored three goals — one of
which was the game-winner at
the Irvine tournament, netted
with 30 seconds left.
Kelsey has been a starter on
and off for most of the season.
Two weeks ago, he came off
the bench to score three goals
against UCLA and spark the
Cardinal offense enroute to a
12-2 victory.
"Chris has added a lot of
things to the team," said De
ttamanti. "For a freshman, he
very rarely makes mistakes.
He's very good on the fast
break — I'd say he gets half his
goals on it. He's had no trouble
adjusting to our system. The
system was madeforhim; itfits
