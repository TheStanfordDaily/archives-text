# Off the Wall Gang tops B league in IMs
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
Defending champion Off the Wall Gang is
once again the top-ranked "B" team as the IM
football leagues enter their fourth week of
p |a y.
The Theta Delts, Taste of Honey and High
Energy hold down the top spot in the "A,"
coed and women's leagues, respectively.
The Off the Wall Gang has scored 43-0 and
42-0 wins in two games, and has picked up a
third victory on a forfeit. The Gang's perfor
mance barely overshadows that of the
Ghetto, which has rolled up 37-0 and 43-0
wins in its two outings. Overall, more than
100 "B" teams are participating.
Only nine teams are competing in the two
"A" leagues, and the Theta Delts and the
Zetes appear to be a notch above the rest.
Sigma Chi, a tough loser to both teams,
seems to be better than everyone else de
spite the two defeats.
In the coed leagues, Taste of Honey has
outscored three opponents by a total of 59-0,
to edge out Who Are We. Who Are We is the
top scoring coed team after posting 19-0 and
31-6 victories in two games.
The all-women's league has five teams, and
High Energy and Taste of Honey look like the
best two. The nod in the polls is given to High
Energy because they have played one more
game.
Overall, 10 teams in the four divisions are
undefeated and unscored upon, while over
30 teams remain unbeaten.

At times the fun of IM competition takes on the appearance of intense
football — or even rugby! Rankings following the first few contests have been
released, though, and the stars are beginning to emerge from the teeming
mass of competitors.
