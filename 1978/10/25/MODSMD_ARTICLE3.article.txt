# Incentives offered for compliance
## Carter proposes wage-price guidelines 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter unveiled a largely vol
untary new set of wage and price
guidelines last night and pleaded
with the nation "to give this plan a
chance to work."
"We must face a time of national
austerity," Carter said in remarks
prepared for a speech broadcast to
the nation. "Hard choices are neces
sary if we want to avoid consequ
ences that are even worse," he said.
The President, speaking from the
White House Oval Office, set a
guideline of 7 percent in 1979 for in
creases in wages and fringe benefits
and a complex price guideline aimed
at holding increases to approxi
mately 5.75 percent next year.
Carter said that if the program is
successful this would translate into
an inflation rate of 6 percent to 6.5
percent in the next year, well below
the current rate of about 8 percent.
He said he would ask Congress to
enact tax rebates for workers who
comply with the 7 percent wage
guide and who would suffer when
inflation exceeds that level. Carter
called it "real wage insurance."
Domestic priority
As part of his new assault on infla
tion, which the President said would
be his administration's No. 1 domes
tic priority in the coming year, Carter
pledged:
— To cut the federal deficit to $30
billion or less next year.
— To fill only one of every two new
job vacancies in the government for
"an indefinite period."
— To "oppose any further reduc
tion in federal income taxes until we
have convincing prospects that infla
tion will be controlled."
— To seek legislation bringing in
creased competition in the railroad
and trucking industries. Earlier yes
terday, Carter signed into law a mea
sure that will phase out federal regu

lation of air fares.
Carter's wage guideline is in
tended to limit both wages and be
nefits to an average of 7 percent a
year for all workers except those
making less than $4 an hour. Those
persons will be exempted from the
program.
Also exempted are future pay
raises that have already been written
into existing contracts.
"From tonight on, every contract
signed and every pay raise granted
should meet this standard," Carter
said.
The price guideline is somewhat
more complex. It seeks to limit the
average price increase for a firm's
product line to .05 percent less than
the average for its price increases in
1976 and 1977.
Price increases
Carter's advisers figure this would
result in price increases across the
economy of roughly 5.75 percent a
year. But they expect it to cut the
inflation rate to only about 6 percent
or 6.5 percent, because there will be
exceptions for firms with "unavoida
ble" cost increases.
Such an exception would be made,
for example, for a firm that has an
existing wage contract committing it
to granting pay raises above the 7
percent guideline.
"This is a standard for everyone to
follow. Everyone," Carter said. "As
far as I am concerned, every busi
ness, every union, every profes
sional group, every individual in this
country has no excuse not to adhere
to these standards. If we meet these
standards, the real buying power of
your paycheck will rise."
No exceptions
Although the President declared
no exceptions, Carter's chief
economic adviser, Charles Schultze,
said, "We're not interested in Mom
and Pop stores. We're zeroing in on

larger parts of the economy where
there is a concentration of economic
power."
Although the price guidelines will
be mainly voluntary, there are some
incentives for compliance.
Firms seeking federal contracts of
$5 million or more will be required to
sign a statement that they are in
compliance with both wage and
price standards.
According to a "fact sheet" issued
by the White House, increases above
the guidelines would "trigger actions
by the government."
These actions could include relax
ing restrictions on imports or adjust
ing federally regulated rate or wage
levels.
Carter said the federal Council on
Wage and Price Stability, which pre

sently has a staff of about 30 persons,
will get 100 additional employees and
will "monitor" all collective bargain
ing contracts and the prices of the
top 400 firms in the nation, those
with annual sales of more than $500
million.
Carter said that cutting the federal
deficit and foregoing future federal
income tax cuts would require "na
tional austerity" and "hard choices."
"I intend to make those hard
choices," Carter said, adding that he
would continue to veto spending
measures if necessary to "keep our
nation firmly on the path of fiscal re
straint."
Carter said his limits on federal hir
ing would mean a reduction of more
than 20,000 in the number of perma-
nent federal employees budgeted
for this year. However, a rider at
tached to the recently enacted civil
service revision bill requires Carter
to cut the federal workforce by about
30,000 to 40,000 persons.
"These proposals, which give us a
chance, also deserve a chance," he
said. "If, tomorrow, or next week, or
next month, you ridicule them, ig
nore them, pick them apart before
they have a chance to work, you will
have reduced their chance of suc
ceeding."
Initial reaction from members of
Congress was generally supportive
Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said after
being briefed by Carter, "I think as a
first step it will get considerable Re
publican support because it's doing
something."
Rep. Robert Ciaimo (D-Conn.)
said, "I believe it's a very real first
step to get things under control."
However, Senate Minority Leader
Howard Baker of Tennessee and
House Republican leader John
Rhodes of Arizona signed a telegram
sent to the presidents of the com
mercial networks demanding equal
time to respond to the President's
anti-inflation speech.

Carter's wage guideline is in
tended to limit both wages and be
nefits to an average of 7 percent a
year for all workers except those
making less than $4 an hour. Those
persons will be exempted from the
program.
Also exempted are future pay
raises that have already been written
into existing contracts.
"From tonight on, every contract
signed and every pay raise granted
should meet this standard," Carter
said.
The price guideline is somewhat
more complex. It seeks to limit the
average price increase for a firm's
product line to .05 percent less than
the average for its price increases in
1976 and 1977.
Price increases
Carter's advisers figure this would
result in price increases across the
economy of roughly 5.75 percent a
year. But they expect it to cut the
inflation rate to only about 6 percent
or 6.5 percent, because there will be
exceptions for firms with "unavoida
ble" cost increases.
Such an exception would be made,
for example, for a firm that has an
existing wage contract committing it
to granting pay raises above the 7
percent guideline.
"This is a standard for everyone to
follow. Everyone," Carter said. "As
far as I am concerned, every busi
ness, every union, every profes
sional group, every individual in this
country has no excuse not to adhere
to these standards. If we meet these
standards, the real buying power of
your paycheck will rise."
No exceptions
Although the President declared
no exceptions, Carter's chief
economic adviser, Charles Schultze,
said, "We're not interested in Mom
and Pop stores. We're zeroing in on

larger parts of the economy where
there is a concentration of economic
power."
Although the price guidelines will
be mainly voluntary, there are some
incentives for compliance.
Firms seeking federal contracts of
$5 million or more will be required to
sign a statement that they are in
compliance with both wage and
price standards.
According to a "fact sheet" issued
by the White House, increases above
the guidelines would "trigger actions
by the government."
These actions could include relax
ing restrictions on imports or adjust
ing federally regulated rate or wage
levels.
Carter said the federal Council on
Wage and Price Stability, which pre

sently has a staff of about 30 persons,
will get 100 additional employees and
will "monitor" all collective bargain
ing contracts and the prices of the
top 400 firms in the nation, those
with annual sales of more than $500
million.
Carter said that cutting the federal
deficit and foregoing future federal
income tax cuts would require "na
tional austerity" and "hard choices."
"I intend to make those hard
choices," Carter said, adding that he
would continue to veto spending
measures if necessary to "keep our
nation firmly on the path of fiscal re
straint."
Carter said his limits on federal hir
ing would mean a reduction of more
than 20,000 in the number of perma-
nent federal employees budgeted
for this year. However, a rider at
tached to the recently enacted civil
service revision bill requires Carter
to cut the federal workforce by about
30,000 to 40,000 persons.
"These proposals, which give us a
chance, also deserve a chance," he
said. "If, tomorrow, or next week, or
next month, you ridicule them, ig
nore them, pick them apart before
they have a chance to work, you will
have reduced their chance of suc
ceeding."
Initial reaction from members of
Congress was generally supportive
Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said after
being briefed by Carter, "I think as a
first step it will get considerable Re
publican support because it's doing
something."
Rep. Robert Ciaimo (D-Conn.)
said, "I believe it's a very real first
step to get things under control."
However, Senate Minority Leader
Howard Baker of Tennessee and
House Republican leader John
Rhodes of Arizona signed a telegram
sent to the presidents of the com
mercial networks demanding equal
time to respond to the President's
anti-inflation speech.
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter unveiled a largely vol
untary new set of wage and price
guidelines last night and pleaded
with the nation "to give this plan a
chance to work."
"We must face a time of national
austerity," Carter said in remarks
prepared for a speech broadcast to
the nation. "Hard choices are neces
sary if we want to avoid consequ
ences that are even worse," he said.
The President, speaking from the
White House Oval Office, set a
guideline of 7 percent in 1979 for in
creases in wages and fringe benefits
and a complex price guideline aimed
at holding increases to approxi
mately 5.75 percent next year.
Carter said that if the program is
successful this would translate into
an inflation rate of 6 percent to 6.5
percent in the next year, well below
the current rate of about 8 percent.
He said he would ask Congress to
enact tax rebates for workers who
comply with the 7 percent wage
guide and who would suffer when
inflation exceeds that level. Carter
called it "real wage insurance."

As part of his new assault on infla
tion, which the President said would
be his administration's No. 1 domes
tic priority in the coming year, Carter
pledged:
— To cut the federal deficit to $30

— To fill only one of every two new
job vacancies in the government for
"an indefinite period."
— To "oppose any further reduc
tion in federal income taxes until we
have convincing prospects that infla
tion will be controlled."
— To seek legislation bringing in
creased competition in the railroad
and trucking industries. Earlier yes
terday, Carter signed into law a mea

lation of air fares.

be mainly voluntary, there are some
incentives for compliance.
Firms seeking federal contracts of
$5 million or more will be required to
sign a statement that they are in
compliance with both wage and
price standards.
According to a "fact sheet" issued
by the White House, increases above
the guidelines would "trigger actions
by the government."
These actions could include relax
ing restrictions on imports or adjust
ing federally regulated rate or wage
levels.
Carter said the federal Council on
Wage and Price Stability, which pre

sently has a staff of about 30 persons,
will get 100 additional employees and
will "monitor" all collective bargain
ing contracts and the prices of the
top 400 firms in the nation, those
with annual sales of more than $500
million.
Carter said that cutting the federal
deficit and foregoing future federal
income tax cuts would require "na
tional austerity" and "hard choices."
"I intend to make those hard
choices," Carter said, adding that he
would continue to veto spending
measures if necessary to "keep our
nation firmly on the path of fiscal re
straint."
Carter said his limits on federal hir
ing would mean a reduction of more
than 20,000 in the number of perma-
nent federal employees budgeted
for this year. However, a rider at
tached to the recently enacted civil
service revision bill requires Carter
to cut the federal workforce by about
30,000 to 40,000 persons.
"These proposals, which give us a
chance, also deserve a chance," he
said. "If, tomorrow, or next week, or
next month, you ridicule them, ig
nore them, pick them apart before
they have a chance to work, you will
have reduced their chance of suc
ceeding."
Initial reaction from members of
Congress was generally supportive
Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said after
being briefed by Carter, "I think as a
first step it will get considerable Re
publican support because it's doing
something."
Rep. Robert Ciaimo (D-Conn.)
said, "I believe it's a very real first
step to get things under control."
However, Senate Minority Leader
Howard Baker of Tennessee and
House Republican leader John
Rhodes of Arizona signed a telegram
sent to the presidents of the com
mercial networks demanding equal
time to respond to the President's
anti-inflation speech.
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter unveiled a largely vol
untary new set of wage and price
guidelines last night and pleaded
with the nation "to give this plan a
chance to work."
"We must face a time of national
austerity," Carter said in remarks
prepared for a speech broadcast to
the nation. "Hard choices are neces
sary if we want to avoid consequ
ences that are even worse," he said.
The President, speaking from the
White House Oval Office, set a
guideline of 7 percent in 1979 for in
creases in wages and fringe benefits
and a complex price guideline aimed
at holding increases to approxi
mately 5.75 percent next year.
Carter said that if the program is
successful this would translate into
an inflation rate of 6 percent to 6.5
percent in the next year, well below
the current rate of about 8 percent.
He said he would ask Congress to
enact tax rebates for workers who
comply with the 7 percent wage
guide and who would suffer when
inflation exceeds that level. Carter
called it "real wage insurance."
Domestic priority
As part of his new assault on infla
tion, which the President said would
be his administration's No. 1 domes
tic priority in the coming year, Carter
pledged:
— To cut the federal deficit to $30
billion or less next year.
— To fill only one of every two new
job vacancies in the government for
"an indefinite period."
— To "oppose any further reduc
tion in federal income taxes until we
have convincing prospects that infla
tion will be controlled."
— To seek legislation bringing in
creased competition in the railroad
and trucking industries. Earlier yes
terday, Carter signed into law a mea
sure that will phase out federal regu

lation of air fares.
Carter's wage guideline is in
tended to limit both wages and be
nefits to an average of 7 percent a
year for all workers except those
making less than $4 an hour. Those
persons will be exempted from the
program.
Also exempted are future pay
raises that have already been written
into existing contracts.
"From tonight on, every contract
signed and every pay raise granted
should meet this standard," Carter
said.
The price guideline is somewhat
more complex. It seeks to limit the
average price increase for a firm's
product line to .05 percent less than
the average for its price increases in
1976 and 1977.
Price increases
Carter's advisers figure this would
result in price increases across the
economy of roughly 5.75 percent a
year. But they expect it to cut the
inflation rate to only about 6 percent
or 6.5 percent, because there will be
exceptions for firms with "unavoida
ble" cost increases.
Such an exception would be made,
for example, for a firm that has an
existing wage contract committing it
to granting pay raises above the 7
percent guideline.
"This is a standard for everyone to
follow. Everyone," Carter said. "As
far as I am concerned, every busi
ness, every union, every profes
sional group, every individual in this
country has no excuse not to adhere
to these standards. If we meet these
standards, the real buying power of
your paycheck will rise."
No exceptions
Although the President declared
no exceptions, Carter's chief
economic adviser, Charles Schultze,
said, "We're not interested in Mom
and Pop stores. We're zeroing in on

larger parts of the economy where
there is a concentration of economic
power."
Although the price guidelines will
be mainly voluntary, there are some
incentives for compliance.
Firms seeking federal contracts of
$5 million or more will be required to
sign a statement that they are in
compliance with both wage and
price standards.
