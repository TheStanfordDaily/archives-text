Frisbee
The Cardinal ultimate frisbee
team takes on UC-Davis Satur
day on the road. The match
starts at 10 a.m. Captained by
Finley Waugh, the team is 1-2
so far this year participating in
the Northern California Ulti
mate Frisbee League.
The game is played with a
seven-member team in an area
the size of a football field. The
only way to advance the frisbee
is to throw it as opposed to
running with it. Each time the

frisbee is caught in the en-'
dzone, the offense receives
one point.
