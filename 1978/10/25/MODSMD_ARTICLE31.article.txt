# Anderson's attitude sparks Card spikers
## 
### ROBERT REED 
Last year, the Daily did some
thing no respectable news
paper wants to do. It kept a
story bottled up that it wanted
to print. But this year that bottle
has been uncorked and the
story is out. The subject? — vol
leyball player, Chris Anderson.
Last year, Anderson, as one
of the most highly recruited
prep stars in the nation and
one of the first two women in
Stanford history to receive a
volleyball scholarship, would
have been the perfect subject
for a feature story, but Art
Lambert, head coach at that
time, objected.
Apparently, Lambert felt that
there would be enough pres
sure as it was due to Ander
son's outstanding high school
career, and that newspaper
coverage would only increase
it. Maybe he was right.
Coming to Stanford, after
leading her high school team
to the CIF championship,
being named to the All-CIF
First Team, and being hailed as
the CIF Player of the Year in
1976-77 in Southern California,
probably put more than
enough pressure on the
talented spiker. The coaching
staff recognized this and tried
to cope with it accordingly.
"We tried not to put a lot of
pressure on her," said new
head coach Fred Sturm, who
last year served as assistant
coach under Lambert. "We
tried to bring her along slow
enough so she could make the
adjustment from high school
to college play (and pressure)."
Sturm added that the pro
cess was made easier by the
fact that the team "had enough
talent so that we didn't have to
rely on her." This talent came
from players who did not have
athletic scholarships.
Did having the scholarship
put even more pressure on
Chris to perform, to prove she
was worth it?
"I don't think the scholar
ship had anything to do with
it," said Anderson, answering
rather quickly. "When you're
practicing or performing,
everybody's out there trying."
"Chris Anderson is a very
solid, fundamental player,"
said Sturm. "She has the ability
to be one of the best collegiate
players in the country. Her
strength comes from her de

sire to excel, to play up to her
capabilities."
What are her capabilities?
"She has all the tools, physi
cal and mental, to be as good as
she wants to be," said Sturm.
Anderson, who passed up
offers from such highly touted
volleyball powers as Hawaii
and San Diego State to play for
the Cards, is a tall, slender,
blue-eyed blonde from Laguna
Beach, California. And in line
with what one might think a
common stereotype, Ander
son admitted that her chief
hobbies are sailing and hang
ing out on the beach. Ander
son likes Stanford. The
sophomore setter said she en
joys "being exposed to all dif
ferent kinds of people . . . It's
nice to see how other people
do things."
Anderson is one of nine
children, but she is the only
one in her family to play vol
leyball. She has been playing
competitively for four years.
Though this may not seem like
such a long time, when you
consider these are not only
four years of league matches,
but four years of non-league

matches, non-league invita
tionals, post-season tourneys,
off-season invitationals, off
season practices, beach tour
neys and the like, the time be
comes a bit harder to bear.
Doesn't she ever get tired of
it all?
"Not during the sea
son . . said Anderson, exp
laining that during the season
she is too "intense" to become
weary of the sport. While ad
mitting that the off-season was
something of a drag, the spiker
explained that the competitive
nature of the season makes it
impossible for her to weary of
the sport.
Anderson is definitely not af
raid to compete.
"Chris has a healthy mental
attitude towards competition,"
said Sturm. This attitude has
brought her a long way. But
how competitive is she?
"I play emotionally, in
tense," said Anderson, " . . .
But I've never cried after a
game ... I was mad after the
San Jose match (which the
Cards lost). We didn't play as a
team . .
Would she characterize her

self as a team player?
"In volleyball, you pretty
much have to be . . . You need
a good pass, a good set, and a
good hit . . . Everybody has to
play well at the same time,"
said Anderson, discussing in
generalities what she later
applied specifically to her own
team, which includes such
standouts as veterans Shawn
Hoover and Liz Hughes, and
newcomer Jan Linden. Said
Anderson, "As far as the
players go, we have the talent
to be one of the best teams in

the nation, certainly among the
top ten. It's just a matter of us
playing more as a team."
Winning comes from playing
as a team. And for individual
players to play as a unit they
must each have the proper
mental attitude, about them
selves and about the team.
Chris Anderson has this
winner's attitude. Perhaps
Sturm expressed this best
when he said, "If a team had six
players with Chris Anderson's
mental attitude, they'd win the
national championship."

California play in high school and was one of the first two women to
receive a volleyball scholarship to Stanford.
