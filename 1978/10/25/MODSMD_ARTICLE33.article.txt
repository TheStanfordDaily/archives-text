# Oil lease to cost state $10 million

Richard Langlois of the Universi
ty's Center for Technology Assess
ment and Resource Policy testified
Monday that a proposed 1979
offshore oil lease sale probably will
cost California at least $10 million in
"external costs" caused by oil spills
and pollution.
Langlois traveled to Santa Barbara
to testify at the opening of two days
of hearings by the federal Bureau o(
Land Management on the offshore
lease sale of more than 1.1 million
acres which would extend south
ward from the Santa Barbara channel
to Mexico.
"From a national point of view, the
sale would be a net gain," said
Langlois, citing $2.3 billion as the of
ficial estimate of benefits to the fed
eral government and oil companies
from the sale.
"But the benefits are unevenly dis
tributed," he said, "and different
means should be sought to compen
sate those who stand to lose, like
state and local government.
"It's important that you look at the
external costs," said the University
technology researcher. He added
that there is a five percent chance
that external costs to the state could
run as high as $50 to $62 million.
According to Langlois, the results
of the study were "completely inde
pendent" from any affiliation with
the Bureau of Land Management.
Langlois said that one of the
greatest problems, and one of the
largest cost factors, would be air pol
lution created by oil drilling.
"But one way to offset this is to
require the oil companies to use a
pipeline instead of tankers," he said.
"This would cost the companies a lit
tle more, but it would save the state a
lot ot money."
According to a study conducted by
the Department of the Interior, an
estimated 715 million barrels of re
coverable oil would be produced by
31 platforms.
Langlois said his research was also
concerned with the idea that "there
may be an oil glut on the West Coast,
taking into account the Alaskan
pipeline. But we found that this
would not happen; on the contrary,
all the oil would be used."
