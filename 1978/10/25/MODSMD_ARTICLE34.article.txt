L.A. fire brought under control
Los Angeles — While fire victims returned to
their gutted neighborhoods, investigators
searched yesterday for the arsonist who sparked
the most destructive blaze in a wild siege of fires
that left 140 hillside homes in ruins.
As water-dropping helicopters teamed with
cool, moisture-laden sea breezes to choke the last
licks of flame in the massive Agoura-Malibu fire,
arson investigators found a delayed-action incen
diary device — a paper matchbook with a cigarette
in it — in the area where the blaze began Monday
morning.
The fire went on to scorch a 25,000-acre, 10-mile
swath across the Santa Monica Mountains from
Agoura to the sea.
At least a dozen persons were injured by the
various fires, including an Agoura man who was
severely burned as he tried to keep the flames
from his door.
In Sacramento, Gov. Jerry Brown declared the
burned out regions around the city a disaster area,
thereby making available emergency state funds.
Brown also was expected to ask President Jimmy
Carter to declare the region a federal disaster area.
Iran discusses arms cutbacks
Tehran, Iran — Iran wants to make drastic cuts in
arms purchases from the United States, including
cancellation of a $1.2 billion aerial spying system
that has annoyed neighboring Russia, Tehran
newspapers reported yesterday.
The newspapers said U.S. and Iranian
negotiators met behind closed doors yesterday to
discuss the cutbacks, which reportedly would save
the country $7 billion over the next five years.
Iran ordered the Advance Warning Airborne
Control System (AWACS) a year ago, and it was to
have been used on the Iranian-Soviet border to
report Russian military movement, the newspap
ers said.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman
said Iran has given American negotiators no indi
cation it wants to back out of previously arranged
arms purchases, including the AWACS sale.
A State Department spokesman, who did not
want to be identified, said the talks in Tehran con
cern arms sales that have been negotiated but not
formally concluded. He also said the Iranians have
suggested they might use oil to pay for some of the
arms the country wants to buy from U.S. com
panies.
Israelis delay treaty decision
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet adjourned after
a seven-hour session yesterday without making a
decision on the draft of a peace treaty with Egypt.
President Jimmy Carter has urged the Israelis to
accept the document but some ministers expres
sed reservations.
Speaking to reporters after the lengthy session,
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said, "I hope the

Cabinet will end its discussion tomorrow, and that
it will also make the decisions."
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also a
member of the powerful committee, said the draft
left open "certain questions which require con
crete answers."
Official sources confirmed press reports that
Carter cabled Begin to urge Israel to accept the
draft, saying the negotiators had produced a good
agreement.
But after 11 hours of discussion Monday and
yesterday, the Cabinet had neither accepted the
draft nor issued new instructions to its
negotiators.
Official statements in Cairo and press reports
here indicated both countries would ask for
changes in the 10-page text and annexes which
emerged last weekend after Carter intervened to
get past obstacles.
New drug to treat brain disease
Washington — In what scientists say is a major
breakthrough against viral diseases, the Food and
Drug Administration yesterday approved a new
drug to treat a deadly infectious brain ailment.
"Approval of this drug is particularly noteworthy
because it holds out the hope that some day we
will be able to successfully treat other viral dis
eases," said FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy.
In studies sponsored by the National Institute of
Health, the drug slashed the death rate caused by
Herpes encephalitis from 70 percent to 28 percent
and substantially reduced the brain damage often
suffered by survivors of the rare disease.
In diseases caused by a virus, whether it be the
common cold, influenza, polio or other life
threatening disorders such as Herpes en
cephalitis, science can treat only the symptoms
while the illness runs its course and the body fights
back.
The development of vaccines has made it possi
ble to prevent many of the common viral diseases.
Pope accepts Egyptian invitation
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II was reported
yesterday to have accepted an invitation from Pres
ident Anwar Sadat to visit Mt. Sinai after the
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is signed. John Paul
also said he would like to visit his native Poland
next year.
The mountain in the Sinai Peninsula has been
under Israeli occupation since 1967. Sadat wants to
build a mosque, church and synagogue there
when Israeli troops withdraw in implementation
of the Camp David peace accords.
John Paul II voiced his hope to visit Poland
Monday afternoon in an audience with 1000 coun
trymen and another 3000 visitors of Polish descent
who came here to see the first Polish pontiff in
history.
The Vatican announced that the 58-year-old
pontiff will travel by car today for a brief visit to

Castel Candolfo, the lakeside town south of
Rome.
Yesterday, the new pontiff held a series of audi
ences with cardinals scheduled to return home
and received Italian President Sandro Pertini, who
was making a courtesy call to the Vatican.
Pope John Paul also announced his first two
appointments, naming Italian bishops to diploma
tic posts in Senegal and the Congo.
Doctor acquitted; reporter freed
Hackensack, N.J. — Dr. Mario Jascalevich was
found innocent yesterday of killing three hospital
patients in the mid-19605, while New York Times
reporter Myron Farber was freed after spending 40
days in jail for refusing to give up his notes on the
case.
The jury that acquitted Jascalevich deliberated
for only about two hours over two days after a
34-week trial. He had been accused of giving the
patients fatal doses of curare, a muscle relaxant.
Jascalevich's defense maintained that the sur
geon was framed by other doctors and was a victim
of a conspiracy between the prosecutor, Farber
and the New York City medical examiner. Jas
calevich never testified.
In 1976, Farber wrote about the deaths in which
Jascalevich was later charged, referring not to Jas
calevich but to a "Dr. X."
The jailing of Farber and leveling of $285,000 in
fines against The Times focused nationwide atten
tion on the conflict between the rights to a free
press and a fair trial. The case may still be taken up
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pipeline explosion kills five
Brookside Village, Texas — A natural gas pipeline
exploded into flames at a trailer park yesterday,
killing five persons who were overcome by scorch
ing heat as they tried to flee through an open field,
authorities said. At least 43 others were injured.
The 3 a.m. blast was felt 35 miles away, and the
fireball that arose from the scene was visible to
airplane pilots 200 miles away.
Market awaits Carter's plan
New York — A late round of selling pinned the
stock market with another loss yesterday as trad
ers cautiously awaited President Jimmy Carter's
inflation message.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had been up more than four points early in the
day, closed with a 7.11-point loss at a three-month
low of 832.55.
Big Board volume dropped off to 28.88 million
shares from 36.09 million Monday.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but variable high
clouds today. Slightly cooler with lows in the
upper4os to mid 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 60s and 70s.

cation it wants to back out of previously arranged
arms purchases, including the AWACS sale.
A State Department spokesman, who did not
want to be identified, said the talks in Tehran con
cern arms sales that have been negotiated but not
formally concluded. He also said the Iranians have
suggested they might use oil to pay for some of the
arms the country wants to buy from U.S. com
panies.
Israelis delay treaty decision
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet adjourned after
a seven-hour session yesterday without making a
decision on the draft of a peace treaty with Egypt.
President Jimmy Carter has urged the Israelis to
accept the document but some ministers expres
sed reservations.
Speaking to reporters after the lengthy session,
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said, "I hope the

Cabinet will end its discussion tomorrow, and that
it will also make the decisions."
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also a
member of the powerful committee, said the draft
left open "certain questions which require con
crete answers."
Official sources confirmed press reports that
Carter cabled Begin to urge Israel to accept the
draft, saying the negotiators had produced a good
agreement.
But after 11 hours of discussion Monday and
yesterday, the Cabinet had neither accepted the
draft nor issued new instructions to its
negotiators.
Official statements in Cairo and press reports
here indicated both countries would ask for
changes in the 10-page text and annexes which
emerged last weekend after Carter intervened to
get past obstacles.
New drug to treat brain disease
Washington — In what scientists say is a major
breakthrough against viral diseases, the Food and
Drug Administration yesterday approved a new
drug to treat a deadly infectious brain ailment.
"Approval of this drug is particularly noteworthy
because it holds out the hope that some day we
will be able to successfully treat other viral dis
eases," said FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy.
In studies sponsored by the National Institute of
Health, the drug slashed the death rate caused by
Herpes encephalitis from 70 percent to 28 percent
and substantially reduced the brain damage often
suffered by survivors of the rare disease.
In diseases caused by a virus, whether it be the
common cold, influenza, polio or other life
threatening disorders such as Herpes en
cephalitis, science can treat only the symptoms
while the illness runs its course and the body fights
back.
The development of vaccines has made it possi
ble to prevent many of the common viral diseases.
Pope accepts Egyptian invitation
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II was reported
yesterday to have accepted an invitation from Pres
ident Anwar Sadat to visit Mt. Sinai after the
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is signed. John Paul
also said he would like to visit his native Poland
next year.
The mountain in the Sinai Peninsula has been
under Israeli occupation since 1967. Sadat wants to
build a mosque, church and synagogue there
when Israeli troops withdraw in implementation
of the Camp David peace accords.
John Paul II voiced his hope to visit Poland
Monday afternoon in an audience with 1000 coun
trymen and another 3000 visitors of Polish descent
who came here to see the first Polish pontiff in
history.
The Vatican announced that the 58-year-old
pontiff will travel by car today for a brief visit to

Castel Candolfo, the lakeside town south of
Rome.
Yesterday, the new pontiff held a series of audi
ences with cardinals scheduled to return home
and received Italian President Sandro Pertini, who
was making a courtesy call to the Vatican.
Pope John Paul also announced his first two
appointments, naming Italian bishops to diploma
tic posts in Senegal and the Congo.
Doctor acquitted; reporter freed
Hackensack, N.J. — Dr. Mario Jascalevich was
found innocent yesterday of killing three hospital
patients in the mid-19605, while New York Times
reporter Myron Farber was freed after spending 40
days in jail for refusing to give up his notes on the
case.
The jury that acquitted Jascalevich deliberated
for only about two hours over two days after a
34-week trial. He had been accused of giving the
patients fatal doses of curare, a muscle relaxant.
Jascalevich's defense maintained that the sur
geon was framed by other doctors and was a victim
of a conspiracy between the prosecutor, Farber
and the New York City medical examiner. Jas
calevich never testified.
In 1976, Farber wrote about the deaths in which
Jascalevich was later charged, referring not to Jas
calevich but to a "Dr. X."
The jailing of Farber and leveling of $285,000 in
fines against The Times focused nationwide atten
tion on the conflict between the rights to a free
press and a fair trial. The case may still be taken up
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pipeline explosion kills five
Brookside Village, Texas — A natural gas pipeline
exploded into flames at a trailer park yesterday,
killing five persons who were overcome by scorch
ing heat as they tried to flee through an open field,
authorities said. At least 43 others were injured.
The 3 a.m. blast was felt 35 miles away, and the
fireball that arose from the scene was visible to
airplane pilots 200 miles away.
Market awaits Carter's plan
New York — A late round of selling pinned the
stock market with another loss yesterday as trad
ers cautiously awaited President Jimmy Carter's
inflation message.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had been up more than four points early in the
day, closed with a 7.11-point loss at a three-month
low of 832.55.
Big Board volume dropped off to 28.88 million
shares from 36.09 million Monday.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but variable high
clouds today. Slightly cooler with lows in the
upper4os to mid 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 60s and 70s.
L.A. fire brought under control
Los Angeles — While fire victims returned to
their gutted neighborhoods, investigators
searched yesterday for the arsonist who sparked
the most destructive blaze in a wild siege of fires
that left 140 hillside homes in ruins.
As water-dropping helicopters teamed with
cool, moisture-laden sea breezes to choke the last
licks of flame in the massive Agoura-Malibu fire,
arson investigators found a delayed-action incen
diary device — a paper matchbook with a cigarette
in it — in the area where the blaze began Monday
morning.
The fire went on to scorch a 25,000-acre, 10-mile
swath across the Santa Monica Mountains from
Agoura to the sea.
At least a dozen persons were injured by the
various fires, including an Agoura man who was
severely burned as he tried to keep the flames
from his door.
In Sacramento, Gov. Jerry Brown declared the
burned out regions around the city a disaster area,
thereby making available emergency state funds.
Brown also was expected to ask President Jimmy
Carter to declare the region a federal disaster area.
Iran discusses arms cutbacks
Tehran, Iran — Iran wants to make drastic cuts in
arms purchases from the United States, including
cancellation of a $1.2 billion aerial spying system
that has annoyed neighboring Russia, Tehran
newspapers reported yesterday.
The newspapers said U.S. and Iranian
negotiators met behind closed doors yesterday to
discuss the cutbacks, which reportedly would save
the country $7 billion over the next five years.
Iran ordered the Advance Warning Airborne
Control System (AWACS) a year ago, and it was to
have been used on the Iranian-Soviet border to
report Russian military movement, the newspap
ers said.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman
said Iran has given American negotiators no indi

will be able to successfully treat other viral dis
eases," said FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy.
In studies sponsored by the National Institute of
Health, the drug slashed the death rate caused by
Herpes encephalitis from 70 percent to 28 percent
and substantially reduced the brain damage often
suffered by survivors of the rare disease.
In diseases caused by a virus, whether it be the
common cold, influenza, polio or other life
threatening disorders such as Herpes en
cephalitis, science can treat only the symptoms
while the illness runs its course and the body fights
back.
The development of vaccines has made it possi
ble to prevent many of the common viral diseases.
Pope accepts Egyptian invitation
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II was reported
yesterday to have accepted an invitation from Pres
ident Anwar Sadat to visit Mt. Sinai after the
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is signed. John Paul
also said he would like to visit his native Poland
next year.
The mountain in the Sinai Peninsula has been
under Israeli occupation since 1967. Sadat wants to
build a mosque, church and synagogue there
when Israeli troops withdraw in implementation
of the Camp David peace accords.
John Paul II voiced his hope to visit Poland
Monday afternoon in an audience with 1000 coun
trymen and another 3000 visitors of Polish descent
who came here to see the first Polish pontiff in
history.
The Vatican announced that the 58-year-old
pontiff will travel by car today for a brief visit to

Castel Candolfo, the lakeside town south of
Rome.
Yesterday, the new pontiff held a series of audi
ences with cardinals scheduled to return home
and received Italian President Sandro Pertini, who
was making a courtesy call to the Vatican.
Pope John Paul also announced his first two
appointments, naming Italian bishops to diploma
tic posts in Senegal and the Congo.
Doctor acquitted; reporter freed
Hackensack, N.J. — Dr. Mario Jascalevich was
found innocent yesterday of killing three hospital
patients in the mid-19605, while New York Times
reporter Myron Farber was freed after spending 40
days in jail for refusing to give up his notes on the
case.
The jury that acquitted Jascalevich deliberated
for only about two hours over two days after a
34-week trial. He had been accused of giving the
patients fatal doses of curare, a muscle relaxant.
Jascalevich's defense maintained that the sur
geon was framed by other doctors and was a victim
of a conspiracy between the prosecutor, Farber
and the New York City medical examiner. Jas
calevich never testified.
In 1976, Farber wrote about the deaths in which
Jascalevich was later charged, referring not to Jas
calevich but to a "Dr. X."
The jailing of Farber and leveling of $285,000 in
fines against The Times focused nationwide atten
tion on the conflict between the rights to a free
press and a fair trial. The case may still be taken up
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pipeline explosion kills five
Brookside Village, Texas — A natural gas pipeline
exploded into flames at a trailer park yesterday,
killing five persons who were overcome by scorch
ing heat as they tried to flee through an open field,
authorities said. At least 43 others were injured.
The 3 a.m. blast was felt 35 miles away, and the
fireball that arose from the scene was visible to
airplane pilots 200 miles away.
Market awaits Carter's plan
New York — A late round of selling pinned the
stock market with another loss yesterday as trad
ers cautiously awaited President Jimmy Carter's
inflation message.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had been up more than four points early in the
day, closed with a 7.11-point loss at a three-month
low of 832.55.
Big Board volume dropped off to 28.88 million
shares from 36.09 million Monday.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but variable high
clouds today. Slightly cooler with lows in the
upper4os to mid 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 60s and 70s.
L.A. fire brought under control
Los Angeles — While fire victims returned to
their gutted neighborhoods, investigators
searched yesterday for the arsonist who sparked
the most destructive blaze in a wild siege of fires
that left 140 hillside homes in ruins.
As water-dropping helicopters teamed with
cool, moisture-laden sea breezes to choke the last
licks of flame in the massive Agoura-Malibu fire,
arson investigators found a delayed-action incen
diary device — a paper matchbook with a cigarette
in it — in the area where the blaze began Monday
morning.
The fire went on to scorch a 25,000-acre, 10-mile
swath across the Santa Monica Mountains from
Agoura to the sea.
At least a dozen persons were injured by the
various fires, including an Agoura man who was
severely burned as he tried to keep the flames
from his door.
In Sacramento, Gov. Jerry Brown declared the
burned out regions around the city a disaster area,
thereby making available emergency state funds.
Brown also was expected to ask President Jimmy
Carter to declare the region a federal disaster area.
Iran discusses arms cutbacks
Tehran, Iran — Iran wants to make drastic cuts in
arms purchases from the United States, including
cancellation of a $1.2 billion aerial spying system
that has annoyed neighboring Russia, Tehran
newspapers reported yesterday.
The newspapers said U.S. and Iranian
negotiators met behind closed doors yesterday to
discuss the cutbacks, which reportedly would save
the country $7 billion over the next five years.
Iran ordered the Advance Warning Airborne
Control System (AWACS) a year ago, and it was to
have been used on the Iranian-Soviet border to
report Russian military movement, the newspap
ers said.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman
said Iran has given American negotiators no indi
cation it wants to back out of previously arranged
arms purchases, including the AWACS sale.
A State Department spokesman, who did not
want to be identified, said the talks in Tehran con
cern arms sales that have been negotiated but not
formally concluded. He also said the Iranians have
suggested they might use oil to pay for some of the
arms the country wants to buy from U.S. com
panies.
Israelis delay treaty decision
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet adjourned after
a seven-hour session yesterday without making a
decision on the draft of a peace treaty with Egypt.
President Jimmy Carter has urged the Israelis to
accept the document but some ministers expres
sed reservations.
Speaking to reporters after the lengthy session,
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said, "I hope the

Cabinet will end its discussion tomorrow, and that
it will also make the decisions."
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also a
member of the powerful committee, said the draft
left open "certain questions which require con
crete answers."
Official sources confirmed press reports that
Carter cabled Begin to urge Israel to accept the
draft, saying the negotiators had produced a good
agreement.
But after 11 hours of discussion Monday and
yesterday, the Cabinet had neither accepted the
draft nor issued new instructions to its
negotiators.
Official statements in Cairo and press reports
here indicated both countries would ask for
changes in the 10-page text and annexes which
emerged last weekend after Carter intervened to
get past obstacles.
New drug to treat brain disease
Washington — In what scientists say is a major
breakthrough against viral diseases, the Food and
Drug Administration yesterday approved a new
drug to treat a deadly infectious brain ailment.
"Approval of this drug is particularly noteworthy

will be able to successfully treat other viral dis

Doctor acquitted; reporter freed
Hackensack, N.J. — Dr. Mario Jascalevich was
found innocent yesterday of killing three hospital
patients in the mid-19605, while New York Times
reporter Myron Farber was freed after spending 40
days in jail for refusing to give up his notes on the
case.
The jury that acquitted Jascalevich deliberated
for only about two hours over two days after a
34-week trial. He had been accused of giving the
patients fatal doses of curare, a muscle relaxant.
Jascalevich's defense maintained that the sur
geon was framed by other doctors and was a victim
of a conspiracy between the prosecutor, Farber
and the New York City medical examiner. Jas
calevich never testified.
In 1976, Farber wrote about the deaths in which
Jascalevich was later charged, referring not to Jas
calevich but to a "Dr. X."
The jailing of Farber and leveling of $285,000 in
fines against The Times focused nationwide atten
tion on the conflict between the rights to a free
press and a fair trial. The case may still be taken up
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
