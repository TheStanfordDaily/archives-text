# Hospital grants nurses more on-call physicians
## 
### 
University Hospital administrators
yesterday agreed to provide more
on-call physicians in the Newborn In
tensive Care Unit (NICU), thus meet
ing one of the primary demands of
the 46 nurses who have threatened to
resign.
The proposal was made by Dr. Irv
ing Schulman, chairman of pediat
rics, and other Hospital adminis
trators at a staff meeting Monday
night.
"The medical staff has made a posi
tive response to our requests," said
Rose Anne Petersen, unit staff nurse.
"It (the staff) has shown a good faith
effort to solve the problem," she
said.
According to Petersen, Schulman
affirmed there will be more medical
coverage, with a senior physician av

ailable at all times to the NICU. Pre
viously the physician coverage was
shared with other unit coverage.
In addition, provisions have been
made for senior staff to plan an in
tensive orientation program for all
new resident physicians entering the
unit.
Kathy Celsey, a nurse in the unit,
said the nurses will be briefed on the
proposal as they report for their
shifts. No resignations have yet been
withdrawn.
"Individual staff members will
make any decisions about whether
they will withdraw resignations,"
said Petersen.
University Hospital administrators
and unit nurses will continue to meet
this week to further discuss nursing
staffing and facilities problems.
