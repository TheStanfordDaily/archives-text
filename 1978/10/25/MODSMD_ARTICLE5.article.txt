# Students, athletes attempting to make griffin new mascot
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
A group of student-athletes and other concerned
members of the community here have formed an
organization called Friends of the Stanford Griffin
(FSG) which seeks to make the griffin the new mascot
of the long mascot-less athletic teams here.
Senior Dan Wessner, a gymnast for Stanford and a
member of the group, said FSG hopes to bring their
proposal before the ASSU sometime in the next
couple of weeks in an attempt to get some feedback.
Wessner said the group approached President
Richard Lyman for guidance in their efforts. Jean Fet
ter, assistant to Lyman, said the question was raised at
a staff meeting last week and Lyman, among others,
felt that the best way to procede was to go to the
students first to find out what their feelings would be
concerning the griffin as a mascot.
Wessner said that about 250 athletes signed a peti
tion last spring requesting that the griffin be made the
new symbol for the athletic teams here. He added,
however, that the Athletic Department was steering
clear of the issue because "they've got a lot of pres
sure from the Buck Club which wants the return of
the Indian."
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz denied being pressured
by the club one way or another. Although Ruetz said
he personally does not like the griffin, he stressed
that this in no way represents the feelings of the
members of his department nor does it constitute an
official position on the matter. He called the efforts of

FSC "perfectly legitimate" and said he has tried to
stay out of the controversy.
Wessner, Fetter and others said they know of no
precedent for changing the mascot of the University.
Wessner did say he felt that gaining student support
was the key to getting the griffin instated.
One source, who requested anonimity, called the
mascot issue "a very trivial matter until people start
getting hurt." He said the current controversy grew
out of the "continuing bitterness about the Indian
being dropped."
The source explained that the reaction against the
griffin as a mascot may not be so much a dislike for
the symbol itself as an attempt to keep the issue alive
and thus afford a chance for the reinstatement of the
Indian.
He went on to say that "not too many people are
happy with the cardinal" as a mascot, though the
traditional color of cardinal red is well liked.
Wessner said that FSC is trying to get statues of
griffins which currently stand near the Children's
Hospital moved next to the Athletic Department. The
statues originally stood near the gateway to the origi
nal Stanford mansion.
The griffins must be moved to make room for new
construction at the Hospital, according to Fetter. The
Stanford Historical Society is currently deliberating a
new home for the statues. Fetter indicated she nad
communicated to the Historical Society the desires of
FSG to have some say in the relocation of the statues.

Senior Dan Wessner, a gymnast for Stanford and a
member of the group, said FSG hopes to bring their
proposal before the ASSU sometime in the next
couple of weeks in an attempt to get some feedback.
Wessner said the group approached President
Richard Lyman for guidance in their efforts. Jean Fet
ter, assistant to Lyman, said the question was raised at
a staff meeting last week and Lyman, among others,
felt that the best way to procede was to go to the
students first to find out what their feelings would be
concerning the griffin as a mascot.
Wessner said that about 250 athletes signed a peti
tion last spring requesting that the griffin be made the
new symbol for the athletic teams here. He added,
however, that the Athletic Department was steering
clear of the issue because "they've got a lot of pres
sure from the Buck Club which wants the return of
the Indian."
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz denied being pressured
by the club one way or another. Although Ruetz said
he personally does not like the griffin, he stressed
that this in no way represents the feelings of the
members of his department nor does it constitute an
official position on the matter. He called the efforts of

FSC "perfectly legitimate" and said he has tried to
stay out of the controversy.
Wessner, Fetter and others said they know of no
precedent for changing the mascot of the University.
Wessner did say he felt that gaining student support
was the key to getting the griffin instated.
One source, who requested anonimity, called the
mascot issue "a very trivial matter until people start
getting hurt." He said the current controversy grew
out of the "continuing bitterness about the Indian
being dropped."
The source explained that the reaction against the
griffin as a mascot may not be so much a dislike for
the symbol itself as an attempt to keep the issue alive
and thus afford a chance for the reinstatement of the
Indian.
He went on to say that "not too many people are
happy with the cardinal" as a mascot, though the
traditional color of cardinal red is well liked.
Wessner said that FSC is trying to get statues of
griffins which currently stand near the Children's
Hospital moved next to the Athletic Department. The
statues originally stood near the gateway to the origi
nal Stanford mansion.
The griffins must be moved to make room for new
construction at the Hospital, according to Fetter. The
Stanford Historical Society is currently deliberating a
new home for the statues. Fetter indicated she nad
communicated to the Historical Society the desires of
FSG to have some say in the relocation of the statues.

The griffins located in front of the Children's Hospital will be relocated
shortly to make room for expansion.
A group of student-athletes and other concerned
members of the community here have formed an
organization called Friends of the Stanford Griffin
(FSG) which seeks to make the griffin the new mascot
of the long mascot-less athletic teams here.
Senior Dan Wessner, a gymnast for Stanford and a
member of the group, said FSG hopes to bring their
proposal before the ASSU sometime in the next
couple of weeks in an attempt to get some feedback.
