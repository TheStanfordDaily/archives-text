# Jasper Ridge a 'unique classroom'
## 
### LIZ SCHERMER 
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a biological
scientist, and his colleagues
have been studying the chec
kerspot butterfly for more than
15 years.
The checkerspot is "trap
ped" here because its food
supply, serpentine grassland,
grows here. The rare native
Californian bunch grass, which
grows nowhere else in Califor
nia, has been able to evolve
only after thousands of years of
essentially uninhibited grow
ing.
The ridge has not always
been a controlled research
area. Spanish ranchers, cattle
and hikers used the ridge be
fore World War 11.
Then, the post-World War II
population explosion brought
so many people onto the ridge
that its very survival as a
natural research area was
threatened, according to
Crundmann.
In 1956 the University
realized that Jasper Ridge was
an irreplaceable asset and the
Board of Trustees placed re
striction on its usage. Only as
recently as 1973 was Jasper
Ridge formally designated as a
closed biological preserve.
Since Jasper Ridge is a con
trolled experimental area it is
ope. i on a permit basis to clas
ses and researchers. Perhaps
the ridge is best known to the
outside community for its
magnificent California
wildflower collection, which
blooms in the spring.
"It's a real delicate place.
You can't have people tramp
ing all over it. For the general
public we offer tours through a
docent program. The main at
traction for tourists is the stun
ning display of wildflowers,"
said Paranal.
Paranal said the docents
guide approximately 2000
people through the preserve
each year. Advertising is "to
tally by word of mouth," she
said.
In November, the docents
will be offering special student
tours designed to acquaint
students with the preserve and
the opportunities for complet-

Jasper Ridge, the University's
biological preserve.
According to Alan
Crundmann, administrative di
rector of the preserve, "Ifs lit
erally true that no other uni
versity has a formal preserve
on its campus."
A geological and biological
microcosm of the Santa Cruz
mountains and valley, Jasper
Ridge's amazing diversity of
plants and animals makes it an
ideal research and experimen
tal area for many fields of
natural study. In just 960 acres,
1.5 square miles, the ridge dis
plays numerous plant com
munities, including redwood
and evergreen forest, open
oak woodlands, a lake and sur
rounding marsh and swamp,
grasslands and chaparral.
Tucked away in the western
corner of University lands,
Jasper Ridge is bounded on the
north by the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, on the
west by Searsville Lake and on
the south by a line that divides
the ridge in halves, one owned
by the University and the other
privately subdivided.
Velinda Paranal, program as
sistant at Jasper Ridge, stated,
"At Jasper Ridge we have all the
plant communities of the Santa
Cruz valleys."
Offering innumerable ex
perimental opportunities to
undergraduates, graduate stu
dents and professors from col
leges and universities
throughout the area, the pre
serve has been used for re
search since the University
opened in 1891. David Starr
Jordan, the University's first
president, was one of the ear
liest scientists to discover the
Ridge's natural assets. An
ichthyologist by profession, he
classified fish from San Fran
cisquito Creek. In recent years
population biologists have per
formed research at the ridge.

ing course work and indepen
dent study there.
There are currently 14
courses offered by the Biology,
Human Biology and Applied
Earth Sciences Departments
that use Jasper Ridge. The Uni
versity also offers a two
quarter course offered winter
and spring quarters which
teaches students to become
docents.
Paranal said, "Most of the
docents are specialists in
wildflowers. The course
teaches intellectual aspects as
well as the practicalities of how
to lead a tour. Docents form a
good liaison between what's

happening in scientific re
search and the community."
Jasper Ridge is patrolled by
wardens, many of whom are
students here. One warden
commented, "This is such a
nice job I think I'll do it for
awhile." He stated that tres
passing usually isn't a serious
problem, but when it does oc
cur, "people are usually pretty
cooperative about getting off."
Some of the wardens and the
caretaker of the preserve live in
a trailer there and are respon
sible for trail maintenance as
well as security.
According to Crundmann,
the funding for Jasper Ridge
comes from "restricted Uni

versity funds." Little tuition
money is used. Since the Biol
ogy Department is the primary
user of the preserve, funds
from that department are also
used.
Crundmann stated that it is
his "personal goal" to avoid
using tuition money for fund
ing, "so that Jasper Ridge will
operate without being in com
petition with other depart
ments."
Guidelines for class and in
dividual research projects are

Jasper Ridge is patrolled by

students here. One warden
commented, "This is such a

According to Crundmann,
the funding for Jasper Ridge
comes from "restricted Uni

Crundmann stated that it is
his "personal goal" to avoid

Searsville Lake is one of many 'scenic wonders' at Jasper Ridge biological preserve. A microcosm of the
Santa Cruz mountains can be seen in the 1.5 square mile preserve.
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a biological
scientist, and his colleagues
have been studying the chec
kerspot butterfly for more than
15 years.
The checkerspot is "trap

grows here. The rare native
Californian bunch grass, which
grows nowhere else in Califor

The ridge has not always
been a controlled research

Then, the post-World War II
population explosion brought
so many people onto the ridge
that its very survival as a
natural research area was
threatened, according to
Crundmann.
In 1956 the University
realized that Jasper Ridge was
an irreplaceable asset and the
Board of Trustees placed re

Ridge formally designated as a
closed biological preserve.
Since Jasper Ridge is a con

the ridge is best known to the

A geological and biological
microcosm of the Santa Cruz
mountains and valley, Jasper
Ridge's amazing diversity of
plants and animals makes it an
ideal research and experimen
tal area for many fields of
natural study. In just 960 acres,
1.5 square miles, the ridge dis
plays numerous plant com
munities, including redwood
and evergreen forest, open
oak woodlands, a lake and sur
rounding marsh and swamp,
grasslands and chaparral.
Tucked away in the western
corner of University lands,
Jasper Ridge is bounded on the
north by the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, on the
west by Searsville Lake and on
the south by a line that divides
the ridge in halves, one owned
by the University and the other
privately subdivided.
Velinda Paranal, program as

"At Jasper Ridge we have all the
plant communities of the Santa
Cruz valleys."

There are currently 14
courses offered by the Biology,
Human Biology and Applied
Earth Sciences Departments
that use Jasper Ridge. The Uni
versity also offers a two
quarter course offered winter
and spring quarters which
teaches students to become
docents.
Paranal said, "Most of the
docents are specialists in
wildflowers. The course
teaches intellectual aspects as
well as the practicalities of how
to lead a tour. Docents form a
good liaison between what's

happening in scientific re
search and the community."
Jasper Ridge is patrolled by
wardens, many of whom are
students here. One warden
commented, "This is such a
nice job I think I'll do it for
awhile." He stated that tres
passing usually isn't a serious
problem, but when it does oc
cur, "people are usually pretty
cooperative about getting off."
Some of the wardens and the
caretaker of the preserve live in
a trailer there and are respon
sible for trail maintenance as
well as security.
According to Crundmann,
the funding for Jasper Ridge
comes from "restricted Uni

versity funds." Little tuition
money is used. Since the Biol
ogy Department is the primary
user of the preserve, funds
from that department are also
used.
Crundmann stated that it is
his "personal goal" to avoid
using tuition money for fund
ing, "so that Jasper Ridge will
operate without being in com
petition with other depart
ments."
Guidelines for class and in
dividual research projects are

Searsville Lake is one of many 'scenic wonders' at Jasper Ridge biological preserve. A microcosm of the
Santa Cruz mountains can be seen in the 1.5 square mile preserve.
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a biological
scientist, and his colleagues
have been studying the chec
kerspot butterfly for more than
15 years.
The checkerspot is "trap
ped" here because its food
supply, serpentine grassland,
grows here. The rare native
Californian bunch grass, which
grows nowhere else in Califor
nia, has been able to evolve
only after thousands of years of
essentially uninhibited grow
ing.
The ridge has not always
been a controlled research
area. Spanish ranchers, cattle
and hikers used the ridge be
fore World War 11.
Then, the post-World War II
population explosion brought
so many people onto the ridge
that its very survival as a
natural research area was
threatened, according to
Crundmann.
In 1956 the University
realized that Jasper Ridge was
an irreplaceable asset and the
Board of Trustees placed re
striction on its usage. Only as
recently as 1973 was Jasper
Ridge formally designated as a
closed biological preserve.
