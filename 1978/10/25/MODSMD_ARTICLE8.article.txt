# New birth control devices may soon be available here

Washington (AP) â€” Some new, chemically
treated contraceptive devices for both men and
women may be on the market in a few years, but
no real breakthroughs, like a pill for men or an
anti-pregnancy vaccine, are expected anytime
soon, a new survey shows.
The review of birth control prospects was
published Monday by the Population Crisis
Committee, a private, non-profit group devoted
to public education on population matters and
fund-raising for groups such as International
Planned Parenthood.
The report said the next new birth control
products on the market may be vaginal sponges,
spermicidal inserts that don't reauire fitting and
can be left in place tor several days at a time.
The sponges, made of natural or plastic mate
rial, are more convenient to use but may be no
more effective than the spermicidal creams and
foams already sold over the counter in
drugstores, the committee said.
Several varieties may be on the market in two

or three, years, the report predicted.
For men, researchers expect to begin human
testing soon of a condom designed to dissolve
during intercourse, releasing a spermicide to
prevent pregnancy. Some experts doubt
whether the film-thin condoms will be as effec
tive as existing products, but they noted the
soluble devices don't interfere with enjoyment,
as some present condoms do, and they present
no disposal problems.
A promising alternative to the oral contracep
tive is a vaginal ring which gradually releases
progestin and estrogen, the same hormones
contained in birth control pills, but in smaller
doses, the committee reported.
The ring, designed to be used for three weeks
at a time, "appears to be as effective as the oral
contraceptive but would avoid the need for daily
pill-taking and may have fewer side effects be
cause the drug is absorbed through the vaginal
wall, permitting most of it to bypass the diges
tive system and liver," the committee said.
