# Tips for trips
## Bike trips offer exploration, exhilaration 
### CLAIRE CHAMBERLAIN LOIS NESBITT 
(Editor's note: This is the first
article in a new weekly column
which will detail numerous
types of weekend and after
noon travel adventures.)
Just because you've spent
Saturdays at the home football
game doesn't mean you have
to head for the library' on Sun
day. Instead, why not think
about leaving the Farm for a
day and giving "the real world"
a chance? There's more to
going off-campus than riding
cable cars or walking along
Fisherman's Wharf in San Fran
cisco.
Clear skies and crisp fall air
make this month a great time
for bike riding Even if you're
not in shape, your 10-speed
probably is. The bike trips de
tailed below offer good after
noon adventures away from
the University.
Sausalito and Golden Gate
Bridge Trip: This flat, 12-mile
trip through San Francisco, the
Golden Gate Bridge and
Sausalito combines unparal

leled scenery with bohemian
adventure. Focusing on views
of water and City skyline, this
trip ends with a visit to the
shops and restaurants of
Sausalito and a ferry ride back
across the Bay.
Park your car on Lincoln
Boulevard just west of the Pres
idio in San Francisco. Then
cycle along Lincoln for about
two miles to the bike entrance
of the Golden Gate Bridge. Fol
low the bike route signs to the
walkway where you'll take your
bike down several steps,
through the tunnel, up more
steps, and onto the west side of
the bridge. As you bike the V/i
miles across the bridge, you
will see many interesting
scenes, from sailboats on the
Bay to the San Francisco
skyline.
Take a left on the cross walk
off Golden Gate Bridge and fol
low the winding gravel road to
Fort Baker, about one mile.
Cross the large field there and
then bike three-tenths of a mile
uphill. Bike another mile until

the road joins the main road
into Sausalito.
An artists' colony of sorts,
Sausalito offers an eclectic
array of delis, bars, restaurants
and specialty shops. Cycling
along the waterfront there,
you'll see many impressive
scenes. On one side are color
ful Victorian houses with long
flights of stairs and overhung
walking lands. On the other
side, you'll see the Bay, Angel
Island, Alcatraz, and the build
ings of San Francisco.
A trip on the Bay ferry can
take you back to the City for 75
cents. You can bring your cycle
on board. Once off the boat,
make an immediate right and
cycle along the Embarcadero.
In less than one mile, you'll
reach Fisherman's Wharf. A left
on Taylor Street and a right on
North Point Street will take you
to the front of Ghirardelli
Square in one-half of a mile.
You'll be at the home of the
world-famous chocolate fac
tory. Take a rest and indulge in
a hot fudge sundae.
Then get back on your cycle,

bearing left at Van Ness Av
enue and right on Lombard
Street. You'll soon hit Lincoln
Boulevard, where you started
several hours before.
Paradise Drive to Tiburon and
Belvedere: If you're still in
terested in seeing the Bay but
want to see a country-like set
ting and less "artistic color," a
bike touring of the Tiburon
peninsula is well-suited to your
wishes. This 15-mile tour on
Paradise Drive takes a cyclist
through wooded hills and
open marshland. After driving
north on Highway 101 across
the Golden Gate Bridge, take
the Paradise Drive exit. Park
near the Paradise Shopping
Center, unpack your cycle and
begin riding along the drive.
A three-mile gentle uphill
gives you a chance to see the
water and sailboats. The road
then winds through strands of
eucalyptus trees to Paradise
Beach County Park. Then it's
downhill all the way to Tibu
ron. Here you can rent a sail
boat, visit the shops, or take
the ferry to Angel Island for a

picnic and more cycling.
From Tiburon, continue on
Paradise Drive toward Belve
dere, another small commun
ity. Then pick up Tiburon
Boulevard for one mile. Make a
right onto Trestle Glen Drive.
Co about a mile and make a left
onto Paradise Drive. Soon
you'll be back at your starting
point.
A Nearby Trip for Beer and
Burgers: If you can't pack your
bike for a jaunt up to San Fran
cisco, or if you want a cycling
trip for post-studying hours,
the five-mile bike trip to Zot's
alpine beer garden may be
more realistic.
Taking Campus Drive past
Lake Lagunita, continue on
Junipero Serra until you come
to the stop light just beyond
the Stanford Golf Course.
Make a left onto Alpine Road.
Cycle along Alpine past the
Highway 280 underpass until
you come to Arastradero Road,
the first road on your left side.
Zot's is nearby, and offers a var
iety of beers, burgers and
warm sunshine.
