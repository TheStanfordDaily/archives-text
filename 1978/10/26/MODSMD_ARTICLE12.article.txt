## Editorial Prop. 5 — A No vote 
### 
Proposition 5, which would ban
smoking in some public places and
mandate non-smoking areas in cer
tain private and public places de
serves, with some regret, a no vote.
This Clean Air Initiative is unen
forceable and impracticable. No
Smoking signs would be required by
law at every entrance of every state
and local government building. And
whereas no present state law regu
lates smbking in private buildings,
under Prop. 5 smoking would be il
legal not only government buildings,
but in a great many private buildings
as well.
Signs and partitions wold be ex
pensive in work area, lounges,
cafeterias and restrooms. And
smokers who ignored them would
pay an expensive penalty — $50 per
violation.
Granted, smoking is dangerous,
even to some non-smokers with cer
tain health problems, and possibly
detrimental to healthy non-smokers
as well..
But we could not imagine, nor do
we want, law enforcement officials
arresting smokers when they could
be enforcing more serious laws.
It is possible, if this proposal be
comes law, that a worker who nor
mally smokes on the job, could con
ceivably start taking work breaks in
stead.
What the ideal working conditions

should be is a matter to be decided
within the company, business or
government office through
employee negotiation procedures.
Anything else is damaging to produc
tivity and is definitely too much gov
ernment intervention.
Alternatives exist now. If some
one's nearby smoking is bother
some, tell them politely to stop or
move, and in most cases they will.
And in large public places, smoking
is now regulated.
However, the large amounts of
money being spent by the tobacco
industry to defeat this measure is up
setting. They are spending an esti
mated $3 million, while the Cancer
Society, Lung Association and other
groups concerned with public health
will spend about $200,000 to prom
ote Prop. 5.
As with Prop. 13, the tax-cutting
initiative, California is often consi
dered a bell-weather state for the
rest of the nation and the tobacco
industry rightly recognizes this.
However, it is disturbing to see fair
debate stifled by large amounts of
money.
But Prop. 5 fails to meet the criteria
of being a workable and enforceable
law, and for these reasons the Daily's
non-smoking editorial board
suggests a no vote in the California
general election in two weeks.
