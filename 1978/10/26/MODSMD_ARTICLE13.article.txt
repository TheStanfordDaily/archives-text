Lightless cyclists
the real problem
Despite recent discussions
of bike-safety problems at the
University, nobody has men
tioned the only cause of the
scary "near misses" I've seen
between bikes and cars around
campus; lightless night cyc
lists. A driver has no chance to
see an unlighted bike until the
car is about to hit it. Cyclists
who are perfectly law-abiding
in other respects seem to feel
that "It's my own risk" when
they get on their lightless
bikes. But the driver is in an
intolerable moral situation:
normal care may not prevent
him/her from killing another
person. We, as cyclists, have
no right to force drivers to take
such a risk. Buy a bike-light! If
you own one of the many
lighted bikes on campus, con
vince a friend to get a light, too.
California law, by the way,
requires every night-cyclist to
have (1) a light visible 300 feet
ahead and to the sides (either a
headlight or one you can strap
to arm or leg), (2) a red rear
reflector, (3) wheel reflectors
(rear wheel red, front white or
orange), and (4) pedal reflec
tors. None of these are expen
sive: wheel reflectors are
about $1.50, leg-lamps about
$2. But we are illegal (and un
safe) without them after dark.
Finally, there has been at
least one fatal 2-bike crash at
the University (a night colli
sion, both bikes unlighted) —
if you and another "blind" bike
connect, the result could be
disaster without any car being
involved. Bike paths are as

good a place to be careful as
roads. Start by not riding three
abreast and begging for colli
sions. And then we might even
watch out for pedestrians or
walk our bikes in the crowded
Quad in broad daylight (there's
no reason why people should
have to dodge cyclists). As a
cyclist, I know most other
campus cyclists are careful, but
it only takes a few of us to
create a serious risk to
everyone.

Review of play
disturbing
Susan Lesjak's review of
"The Magician" (Daily, Oct. 17)
left me both amused and dis
turbed. Though I appreciated
her humorously biting com
mentary on this absurd "religi
ous" play, I was confused by
her references to it as an "ef
fective tool" used for"convert
ing audience members to
Christianity." An effective
conversion tool the play may
be, but the assertion that it has
a Christian message is dubious
at best.
The playwright's warped un
derstanding of the Christian
position on race relations, sex,
science, and man's relation
ship to the supernatural is sad.
But equally sad is Lesjak's be
lief that Christianity was being
presented to the audience, for
even a cursory glance at the
teachings of Christ would have

convinced her otherwise.
As a student and as a Christ
ian I am continually amazed at
the lack of knowledge among
my peers about Jesus of
Nazareth and the movement
he started, a movement whose
impact on Western civilization
has been unprecedented. I
hope by the time we've all
graduated we'll be able to tell a
glow-in-the-dark crucifix from
the real thing.

Daily's coverage
ignores vital
social issues
Why does the Stanford Daily
cover its pages with such use
less trash as "Teenager Purch
ases First Chocolate Monopoly
Came" (10/23) when events of
great importance taking place
in the world? I fail to see the
great social, economic, politi
cal, religious and ethical impli
cations in David Silverman's
action of blowing $600 on a toy.
Are most college students re
ally interested in such matters?
The Stanford community de
serves to have better news than
than contained in such "junk
food reading."

Editor's Note: Ves, most people
are interested in reading "such
matters" in our judgement. It is
good to have humorous arti
cles brighten one's day occa
sionally.
Using the same reasoning,
the Daily should not have
sports or entertainment sec
tions either. They, too, often
fail to mei>t the criteria of hav
ing "great social, economic,
political, religious and ethical
implications." And the fact that
a 13-year-old would spend $600
on such a game is, in our opin
ion, a sociological occurrence
of some significance.
However, new staffers are
always encouraged to join the
Daily to help us increase the
quality of articles presented to

McCloskey's
remarks
evoke shock
I was simply aghast after
reading the article capsulizing
Congressman Pete McClos
key's Sunday visit to the Bow
man Alumni House, "McClos
key fears all volunteer army"
(Daily, Oct. 23). We are con
stantly exposed to the con
gressman through fliers in the
mail and appearances on cam

pus, and perhaps this om
nipresence has immunized the
University community to his
views. After reading the article,
I wish I had remained immune.
Most of the views came as
quite a shock to me. His "fear
of an all-volunteer army" may
be genuine and well-founded.
However, his public fear of an
all minority army and its com
parison to a Mafia-controlled
New York Police Department
are simply appalling. Why does
McCloskey fear a minority
army, which is not what we
have, at least not among the
officers?
Another disturbing factor
that the article revealed about
McCloskey's policies involved
his antediluvian Cold War at
titude towards the Soviet Un
ion. His comparisons of U.S.
and USSR military expendi
tures and his 1950-ish thoughts
on deterrence were astonish
ing, such as his view that the
combat-ready army would help
to prevent a war because the
enemy "knows you're ready to
go at the drop of a hat."
To read such quotes from
the lips of a modern politician
who has taken such great pains
to identify with "today's
youth" is almost more disap
pointing than it is surprising.

Most of the views came as
quite a shock to me. His "fear
of an all-volunteer army" may
be genuine and well-founded.
However, his public fear of an
all minority army and its com
parison to a Mafia-controlled
New York Police Department
are simply appalling. Why does
McCloskey fear a minority
army, which is not what we
have, at least not among the
officers?
Another disturbing factor
that the article revealed about
McCloskey's policies involved
his antediluvian Cold War at
titude towards the Soviet Un
ion. His comparisons of U.S.
and USSR military expendi
tures and his 1950-ish thoughts
on deterrence were astonish
ing, such as his view that the
combat-ready army would help
to prevent a war because the
enemy "knows you're ready to
go at the drop of a hat."
To read such quotes from
the lips of a modern politician
who has taken such great pains
to identify with "today's
youth" is almost more disap
pointing than it is surprising.

Lightless cyclists
the real problem
Despite recent discussions
of bike-safety problems at the
University, nobody has men
tioned the only cause of the
scary "near misses" I've seen
between bikes and cars around
campus; lightless night cyc
lists. A driver has no chance to
see an unlighted bike until the
car is about to hit it. Cyclists
who are perfectly law-abiding
in other respects seem to feel
that "It's my own risk" when
they get on their lightless
bikes. But the driver is in an
intolerable moral situation:
normal care may not prevent
him/her from killing another
person. We, as cyclists, have
no right to force drivers to take
such a risk. Buy a bike-light! If
you own one of the many
lighted bikes on campus, con
vince a friend to get a light, too.
California law, by the way,
requires every night-cyclist to
have (1) a light visible 300 feet
ahead and to the sides (either a
headlight or one you can strap
to arm or leg), (2) a red rear
reflector, (3) wheel reflectors
(rear wheel red, front white or
orange), and (4) pedal reflec
tors. None of these are expen
sive: wheel reflectors are
about $1.50, leg-lamps about
$2. But we are illegal (and un
safe) without them after dark.
Finally, there has been at
least one fatal 2-bike crash at
the University (a night colli
sion, both bikes unlighted) —
if you and another "blind" bike
connect, the result could be
disaster without any car being
involved. Bike paths are as

good a place to be careful as
roads. Start by not riding three
abreast and begging for colli
sions. And then we might even
watch out for pedestrians or
walk our bikes in the crowded
Quad in broad daylight (there's
no reason why people should
have to dodge cyclists). As a
cyclist, I know most other
campus cyclists are careful, but
it only takes a few of us to
create a serious risk to
everyone.

Review of play
disturbing
Susan Lesjak's review of
"The Magician" (Daily, Oct. 17)
left me both amused and dis
turbed. Though I appreciated
her humorously biting com
mentary on this absurd "religi
ous" play, I was confused by
her references to it as an "ef
fective tool" used for"convert
ing audience members to
Christianity." An effective
conversion tool the play may
be, but the assertion that it has
a Christian message is dubious
at best.
The playwright's warped un
derstanding of the Christian
position on race relations, sex,
science, and man's relation
ship to the supernatural is sad.
But equally sad is Lesjak's be
lief that Christianity was being
presented to the audience, for
even a cursory glance at the
teachings of Christ would have

convinced her otherwise.
As a student and as a Christ
ian I am continually amazed at
the lack of knowledge among
my peers about Jesus of
Nazareth and the movement
he started, a movement whose
impact on Western civilization
has been unprecedented. I
hope by the time we've all
graduated we'll be able to tell a
glow-in-the-dark crucifix from
the real thing.

Editor's Note: Ves, most people

good to have humorous arti

Using the same reasoning,
the Daily should not have

fail to mei>t the criteria of hav

McCloskey's
remarks
evoke shock
I was simply aghast after
reading the article capsulizing
Congressman Pete McClos
key's Sunday visit to the Bow
man Alumni House, "McClos
key fears all volunteer army"
(Daily, Oct. 23). We are con
stantly exposed to the con
gressman through fliers in the
mail and appearances on cam

pus, and perhaps this om
nipresence has immunized the
University community to his
views. After reading the article,
I wish I had remained immune.
Most of the views came as
quite a shock to me. His "fear
of an all-volunteer army" may
be genuine and well-founded.
However, his public fear of an
all minority army and its com
parison to a Mafia-controlled
New York Police Department
are simply appalling. Why does
McCloskey fear a minority
army, which is not what we
have, at least not among the
officers?
Another disturbing factor
that the article revealed about
McCloskey's policies involved
his antediluvian Cold War at
titude towards the Soviet Un
ion. His comparisons of U.S.
and USSR military expendi
tures and his 1950-ish thoughts
on deterrence were astonish
ing, such as his view that the
combat-ready army would help
to prevent a war because the
enemy "knows you're ready to
go at the drop of a hat."
To read such quotes from
the lips of a modern politician
who has taken such great pains
to identify with "today's
youth" is almost more disap
pointing than it is surprising.

Lightless cyclists
the real problem
Despite recent discussions
of bike-safety problems at the
University, nobody has men
tioned the only cause of the
scary "near misses" I've seen
between bikes and cars around
campus; lightless night cyc
lists. A driver has no chance to
see an unlighted bike until the
car is about to hit it. Cyclists
who are perfectly law-abiding
in other respects seem to feel
that "It's my own risk" when
they get on their lightless
bikes. But the driver is in an
intolerable moral situation:
normal care may not prevent
him/her from killing another
person. We, as cyclists, have
no right to force drivers to take
such a risk. Buy a bike-light! If
you own one of the many
lighted bikes on campus, con
vince a friend to get a light, too.
California law, by the way,
requires every night-cyclist to
have (1) a light visible 300 feet
ahead and to the sides (either a
headlight or one you can strap
to arm or leg), (2) a red rear
reflector, (3) wheel reflectors
(rear wheel red, front white or
orange), and (4) pedal reflec
tors. None of these are expen
sive: wheel reflectors are
about $1.50, leg-lamps about
$2. But we are illegal (and un
safe) without them after dark.
Finally, there has been at
least one fatal 2-bike crash at
the University (a night colli
sion, both bikes unlighted) —
if you and another "blind" bike
connect, the result could be
disaster without any car being
involved. Bike paths are as

good a place to be careful as
roads. Start by not riding three
abreast and begging for colli
sions. And then we might even
watch out for pedestrians or
walk our bikes in the crowded
Quad in broad daylight (there's
no reason why people should
have to dodge cyclists). As a
cyclist, I know most other
campus cyclists are careful, but
it only takes a few of us to
create a serious risk to
everyone.

Review of play
disturbing
Susan Lesjak's review of
"The Magician" (Daily, Oct. 17)
left me both amused and dis
turbed. Though I appreciated
her humorously biting com
mentary on this absurd "religi
ous" play, I was confused by
her references to it as an "ef
fective tool" used for"convert
ing audience members to
Christianity." An effective
conversion tool the play may
be, but the assertion that it has
a Christian message is dubious
at best.
The playwright's warped un
derstanding of the Christian
position on race relations, sex,
science, and man's relation
ship to the supernatural is sad.
But equally sad is Lesjak's be
lief that Christianity was being
presented to the audience, for
even a cursory glance at the
teachings of Christ would have

convinced her otherwise.
As a student and as a Christ
ian I am continually amazed at
the lack of knowledge among
my peers about Jesus of
Nazareth and the movement
he started, a movement whose
impact on Western civilization
has been unprecedented. I
hope by the time we've all
graduated we'll be able to tell a
glow-in-the-dark crucifix from
the real thing.
