## McCloskey plan distressing 
### 
It is distressing to see another professed liberal, Rep. Pete
McCloskey, advocating a plan of required national service for all
18-year olds ( Daily , Oct. 23).
Under the guise of equal treatment for all and the supposed
benefits of having youths work in hospitals and fields if they
choose not to enter the military, the national service concept is
really a method for bringing back the draft without the rancor that
marked its use during the Vietnam War.
McCloskey and other national service advocates realize that
the draft in those years inevitably favored young men with money
and education, who had a much greater chance of securing
medical or student deferments or conscientious objector status.
By promising required service for all, whatever their background,
along with the agreeable alternative of civilian service in the
country's interest, national service proponents hope to resurrect
the peacetime draft.
According to the Daily article, McCloskey claims the draft

would help prevent a war because our enemies would fear the
combat-ready army it would provide. On the contrary, a
peacetime draft might easily have the opposite effect; as
McCloskey must know, the draft in the 1960s provided hundreds
of thousands of combat-ready young men for Lyndon Johnson to
Vietnam. McCloskey's statement also ignores the fact that our
major military threat in the nuclear age is our arsenal of nuclear
weapons, not ground troops.
The Congressman also raises the tired specter of the Russian
menace, saying that the costs of the volunteer army force the US
to spend far less than the Russians on research and arms, and that
the draft would enable the US to spend more on such pursuits.
Here McCloskey conveniently ignores the many sound argu
ments (see the October issue of Scientific American) in favor of
cutting the billions of American dollars spent on the research and
production of nuclear and conventional weapons.
In citing another supposed benefit of his plan, McCloskey says
that many youths who choose civilian jobs would work in agricul
tural areas, "cutting off" the illegal aliens now in the fields. Both
parts of this proposition are dubious at best, and in any event
would be of little solace to the United Farm Workers, which has
long opposed illegal aliens and the source of cheap, non
unionized and strike-breaking labor they (and presumably 18-
year-olds under McCloskey's plan) provide.
Perhaps most important, a plan of mandatory national service
for all 18-year-olds would strike a serious blow at our democratic
freedoms. Whatever the alleged benefits of such a plan, requir
ing a country's youth to enter the military or perform civilian tasks
smacks more of totalitarianism than of democracy. The supposed
egalitarianism of national service should not hide the crucial
fact that it would restore the draft and its evils and undoubtedly
lead many to resist both military and civilian service.
