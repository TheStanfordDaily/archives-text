## Politics precludes creative solutions 
### 
Scrambling up the white marble
steps of the U.S. Capitol, one day in
July, I managed to grab the peripatetic
and poetic Congressman )arvis Jones 111
by the lapel and he consented to the
following interview. Jones, a twenty
three term representative from the
Fernwood Lake District, is best known
for his inventive liberal/conservatism
and a war injury to the neocortex, sus
tained in a fall from a horse in the Sec
ond Battle of Bull Run. Jones recently
was re-elected with 93 percent of the
votes from his district, and he attributes
this "squeaker" victory to the 7 percent
write-in vote for Billy Carter.
Alben: "Congressman Jones, Ameri
cans are most concerned about the
state of the economy. What can the
Congress do to create growth without
increasing inflation?"
Jones: "Inflation is bad. It robs from
rich and poor alike. Wage and price
controls are bad. They are unconstitu
tional and they halt the great freedom
of companies to do as they please.
What I favor is the inverted tax cut. This
means that taxes are slashed 90 percent
the first year, 80 percent the next and 70
percent each year after that. By the way,
income taxes are probably unconstitu
tional too, but how else could I nail my
opponents if the FBI didn't give me
their returns every April?"
Alben: "Many people say the growth
of government has created many of our
current economic problems. Do you
agree with this assessment?"
Jones: "Government is too big. It is
also corrupt. The deficit is killing the

economy. There is too much fat in gov
ernment programs. The bureaucrats sit
at their cushy jobs while the welfare
chiselers drive around in Mercedes
Benz 450 SEL's. And there are too
damned many regulations. Cogswell
Cogs, in my district, can't even build its
new Kepone plant by the Red River
without first filing an environmental
impact statement. We can't even export
the stuff overseas anymore...'
Alben: "You are known foryour out
spoken stand on the Soviet Union. Do
you still feel that the czar is the legiti
mate leader of the Russian people?"
Jones: "If we back down on the czar,
the next thing you know, we'll have to
drop our support of Chiang Kai-Shek.
Canada may be next in line. We can't be
soft on the Russians, that's why we
need a defense that is first to all, and
preferably an offense to go along with
it. The Russians have been building up
for years. We have only 4000 more nuc
lear warheads than them and I'll be a
monkey's uncle if my grandchild Trish,
is going to wake up one day with a Bol
shevik toting a neutron bomb in her
backyard."
Alben: "Well, Congressman, our
foreign policy is often dependent on
the health of the nation at home. What
have you done to make the U.S. energy
independent?"
Jones: "Good question, son. You
know of course, that Americans must
conserve energy. Further, we are too
dependent on the Arabs and we need
alternative sources. I have voted in
favor of regeneration and conversion

and independent exploration. My new
bill, H.R. 666, calls for the entire state of
Colorado to be strip-mined with strict
provisions that the land will be re
claimed with the construction of a huge
nuclear reactor between Aspen and
Vail."
Alben: "It is estimated that one
fourth of the American public falls
below the poverty level. What have you
done for the poor?"
Jones: "I'm sick and tired of hearing
about the so-called 'poor.' Seventy
percent of these people have televisiqn
sets, some of them made in Japan. Most
of them even have running water. Of
course, I think government should help
people learn to help themselves, so
long as they don't use hard-earned tax
dollars to do it. If the defense industry
grew, there would be plenty of jobs for
the people you like to refer to as
'poor.' "
Alben: "But Congressman, most
youngsters in the ghetto receive such a
poor education, they will never find
employment as skilled workers."
Jones: "Look, I am not insensitive to
the problems of the ghetto. After all, I
saw Roots both times it was on TV. I
always carry this picture of me and
Sammy Davis Jr., which proves my de
votion to his people — and also to the
Palestinians."
Alben: "Congressman, can I just say
something to you?"
"Sure, Alex."
"Mr. Jones, I think your answers to
my questions been thoroughly superfi

cial and facile. I mean no disrespect,
but you have not demonstrated one
creative solution to any of the problems
facing this country, while you continu
ally fall back on empty rhetoric."
"Sure this always gets you re-elected,
because people always want a tax cut,
and they have been taught to fear the
Soviet Union, and most are not ex
posed to the terrible conditions in the
inner cities — such as those right here
in Washington D.C."
"But the solutions to our problems
must be sought in terms of balances
and trade-offs: The protection of the
environment vs. industrial growth,
government regulation of business vs.
worker and product safety, new energy
sources vs. the cost of development
and compromise by the vested in
terests, national defense vs. the world
arms race and domestic health, cutting
government waste vs. cutting vital
programs. You know, everyone says
government is too big, but no one will
cut a public works project in their own
district."
I think if we are to make progress on
these issues, then people must look
into the difficult questions and vote for
men who have energy and whose
words have substance, instead of the
incumbents who point to their "solid"
records and their pictures with celeb
rities."
Jones: "Son, you maythink vou're
smart, but you don't know the first
thing about politics."
