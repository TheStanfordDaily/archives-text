# JV athletics: the missing link?
## 
### LEAH HALPER 
They yell encouragement from the sidelines at home
football games. They attend practice faithfully, drill
varsity players and sometimes miss dinner to attend
meetings to learn game plans they will never get to
play.
They are members of the University football scout
team, a group of players who did not make the varsity
team but who are anxious to stay in the coaches' view
for future seasons. Until last year, these students could
have played intercollegiately at the junior varsity (JV)
level. Now the University has joined many other
schools in dropping most JV teams. In fact, only wo
men's field hockey and men's baseball have JV teams
for University students and the lack of organized com
petition chiefly affects freshmen.
"I was a scout here and I got tired of it,"says
freshman Rex Smith, who was one of the starters for his
St. Louis high school football team last year. "It was
really a waste of time, I thought. Unless we did running
drills for varsity, we just stood around and watched. I
understand why and everything, but that's not doing
anything for us."
Although scouts suit up for home games, they rarely
play and virtually never travel for "away" games.
Freshmen, who have four years of intercollegiate eligi
bility to play varsity athletics, according to intercol
legiate rules, are often "red-shirted" automatically.
Hence, they sit on the bench for the full season.
Smith, who is not playing football now, says that
when he applied to the University he was not aware
that there was no JV competition in athletics. "I
thought I might be able to get on JV and work my way
up," he said. "But even in basketball, which I played in
high school, unless you're super, super good, there's
no way you can get on here. They have 15 spots which
are basically reserved for their 15 basketball scholar
ships. I'd try out if there was a JV team and I've talked to
a lot of other guys who would too."
Complex decision
According to Joe Ruetz, director of the Athletic De
partment, the decision to eliminate JV sports was a
complex one. "We'd probably still have a JV football
team if we could," he said. "We were the last ones to
eliminate them."
"I was playing Taft Junior College and places like
that," Bob Young, assistant director of athletics, said.
Young scheduled intercollegiate JV football matches
for the University team last year. "Some schools, like
Santa Clara, wouldn't even play our JV because we
were too good." USC and UCLA, along with many
other Pacific 10 schools, dropped JV football even ear
lier than Stanford because of the high cost of maintain
ing a team in accord with National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) rules, Young said. Rules require a
team to have an official schedule and to have two
coaches.
Financial problems
Ruetz stresses the University's financial status as a
principal factor affecting the elimination of JV teams
for popular sports. Limited funds are available to all
University teams and sports, but only revenue
generating teams can fully support themselves, he
said. "Most intercollegiate sports cost money. If we're
going to go into intercollegiate competition we want to
provide the best coaching and full funding. Intercol
legiate programs here are basically self-supporting."
Ruetz said that the football and basketball teams
"pay for themselves." Fund-raising efforts of various
sorts accrue approximately $2 million to the football
and basketball teams. Unused revenues from thpse

intercollegiate profits may be tunneled back into non
varsity programs such as physical education, in
tramural (IM) sports and club sports.
Some students think there are problems with the
University's method of allocating funds. One student
said he questions the expenditures of the intercol
legiate varsity teams and cites football as an example.
"Before every game they take them (the football team)
to a movie and before home games they all go to an
expensive hotel to spend the night. Then they say they
don't have the money for JV."
According to Mark Granados, a student manager
for the football team, all 55 team members are usually
treated to a $2.25-a-head film the night before a game.
Additionally, before home games the players stay at
$27-per-room hotels. "It's to get the guys off campus
and keep them away from partying, off their feet,"
Granados said.

Young said this is a necessary precaution, chuckling,
"I drove by the frat house last night and my Cod, the
noise! It was the same when I was here in the late '305."
One ex-scout said, however, "You'd think they
could be trusted the night before the game. That
money could easily pay for a JV coach."
Demand
Priorities for expenditures depend chiefly on stu
dent demand, Ruetz said, citing the recent upsurge in
strength of women's sports as an example. "If we had
remained a men's-only department it might have been
possible to carry on JV with our own single department
budget. But now the stress is also on women's sports.
"We are at the mercy of spectator attendance," he
continued. "Unfortunately, we can't force people to
come and watch and pay for some events. It's in the
culture pattern." Those sports which draw the most
attention, attendance and revenues are football, bas
ketball and occasionally, tennis, he said.
Young also said there is is a lack of adequate facilities
to host )V teams. He speaks wishfully of a possible

addition to the University's indoor gym space. , .
nothing like Maples, where it costs money just to open
the door what with all the lights and everything . . .
What I need is a new building that can be switched
trom basketball to volleyball to badminton quickly."
While Young says such an addition is tentatively
being proposed under this year's master plan for the
Athletic Department, he questions the feasibility of an
addition. "I'm not sure thatitwould be the smart move
because of the finances involved."
Young says that the philosophy of the Athletic De
partment is to try keeping students "at their level of
activity. Some of the volleyball players who don't make
varsity and go into intramurals are "darn good," he
admits, adding that coaches are often in the difficult
position of having to make cuts. Because he played for
the University as a studenthere, Young recalls the days
when freshman, junior varsity and varsity competition

were all University-supported, and he says that he
would personally prefer such a plan. "I still meet fel
lows who played on one of the (lower) teams and they
tend to think they were ail-Americans. They support
the Athletic Department (financially) more than some of
its stars."
Ruetz says the "days of multiple teams are probably
gone forever" because of today's recruitment process,
if for no other reason.
The old days
"Those were the days when recruitment and iden
tification of talent were not as sophisticated as they are
now, so there was broader participation in sports, and
JV teams served as a training ground for a move into
varsity athletics. With the development of really good
coaching in high school, and when NCAA rules pre
vented alumni from encouraging athletes to go to a
certain college, coaches had to start identifying talent.
It became a much more sophisticated analysis of who
was good or bad. Also, we're only allowed a certain

number of coaches under the rules, so they have to
work on varsity."
Ruetz admits that "very few" walk-on players make
some teams, such as football and basketball, but says,
"There is no sense in getting beat all the time. I don't
mean we have to win all the time either, but we should
have a reasonable chance."
Some JV
Because talent development is necessary in a sport
like field hockey, which is rarely played in Western high
schools, the University maintains a JV field hockey
team. Gwen Richards, a freshman on the team this
year, says that while it is discouraging not to make the
varsity team, she is glad the University offers competi
tion on a JV level. "There is a good feeling of unity
between JV and varsity," she says. "Sometimes we'll
scrimmage against the varsity, which is great pratice for
us. It's really hard for freshmen to make varsity, and I
think not having JV deprives them of a place on the
team. Besides, IM isn't as big a deal as I thought it was
from reading Approaching Stanford. It's just not the
same feeling in IM as it is when you get to put on a
uniform and play another school, and yell "Co, Stan
ford!"
There are IM teams here for volleyball, football,
cross country running, and other contests for athletes
and non-athletes looking for exercise and fun.
Young says that the IM program was started "with
the feeling that IM would take care of JV level players."
But some students have found the program in
adequate. "IM is fun but I'm not sure it's the same
thing as a JV team," said John Katerndahl, a freshman
who joined the rugby club because he did not make
the football team. "I wanted to get into some kind of
athletics, so I went out for the club." Club sport offer
ings are decided by students, who form and direct
University athletic clubs.
Other options
"We see the slack in our sports program taken up by
club sports," says Ruetz. "There is a free use of
facilities and some departmental funding. I think it's
led to broadened participation in sports."
Club sports, in fact, are available in everything from
badminton to skiing, but the sports offered do not
overlap with intercollegiate offerings. The club prog
ram is not a substitute for not having JV in particular
sports," said Pam Strathairn, who directs and adminis
ters club sports here. She said that volunteer coaches
help out in the 26 clubs.
"We provide the missing link between intercol
legiates and what phys. ed. cannot provide. I see clubs
as supplimentary and complimentary to intercollegiate
sports." Competition against other schools is com
mon, and Strathairn says that if a University student
qualitied to play national competition through the club
program, such compettion would have to be funded by
the University.
"It would be very fair to say that the University con
tributes about 10 percent of what we figure to be the
cost of clubs. Make that five percent, because self
generated income from the Athletic Department is
half of it. It is a concern that the department has; it is a
concern that I have when you figure that out. We have
presented a case for additional funding."
Meanwhile, for those students like Rex Smith, the
only hope for making the varsity team is to work out
during spring practice. "I'll be going out," Smith says.
"That's supposed to be your big chance — when you
can shine in the coach's eye because there aren't any
seniors left playing. If the coaches like what they see
they tell you to come back in the fall."


They look IH<e football players, practice like football
players, but they aren't part of the University's varsity
team. These men play on the scout team here. Though they
work out with varsity players, the scouts rarely, if ever, get

to play in intercollegiate competition. If the University
had a JV team, many of these scouts would compete on
that squad.
