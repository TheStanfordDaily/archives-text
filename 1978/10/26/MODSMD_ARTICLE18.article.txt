## neil young/john nielsen Still a step ahead of us all 
### 
Well goddamn. There he was, as bent and strange
as ever, standing dead center in what could almost
have been a Kiss concert. Neil Young. With fake snow
falling from a fake snow container in the ceiling, and a
stage crew dressed up like those shrunken monks in
Star Wars. On the corner of the stage were two atten
tive cone-heads; in the center was a microphone a
good 25 feet tall.
It was all very strange. From the beginning, when
the audience received their official 3-D glasses, it was
very quickly apparent that this was not what we'd
expected. After all, the tour was supposed to be con
nected with Young's latest album, and Young's latest
album is not like this at all. The album is almost
entirely acoustic, to begin with; the subject matter is
notable for its lack of musical loose ends, and for the
relative absence of vague desperation that Neil
Young purists covet. The concert, then, would have
been low-key, if it had been like the album — ba
lanced and calm, and sparsely produced, with Young
and little else.
But no. This concert, at the Cow Palace, was purely
and simply a zoo. Young sang a few songs off the new
album, and he sang them as they sounded there, but
the attraction here was not so much the music as it
was the show itself. It was called "Rust Never Sleeps,"
which may or may not have meant something — the
point of it all seemed to be tied up in an as-yet unre
corded number that ended both the first and second
sets. It was a song about music, and about things lost

to age — if those particular subjects are not rare in
Young's music, this offering made its point quite
clearly.
My, my
Hey, hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
Its better to burn out
Than to fade away
My, my
Hey, hey.
And can you take that seriously? Probably not —
but that may have been the idea. Neil Young's con
cert at the Cow Palace last Sunday was off-the-wall on
purpose, as if to show that Young is still a step ahead
of us all. It's hard to believe that the man took a
second of the thing at face value — that could be why
it came off so well and seemed such a great success.
And it did seem a great success. Young sang every
thing with the straight face and staged movement
required of a truly mythic rock star, and generally set
out to be as non-Neil Young as possible. In the first
song of the first set he included two verses that he has
repeatedly labelled "the worst things I ever wrote" —
in the second set he ran around like a madman beat
ing on his electric guitar. (He'd bragged, in the first
set, that he would get one someday.) And he sang
very well, and even managed to turn in some fine
electric solo work. Very strange it was. Without a
doubt the funniest and most invigorating of concerts
in awhile. And Young, I'm sure, was farfrom the least
amused.

And can you take that seriously? Probably not —
but that may have been the idea. Neil Young's con
cert at the Cow Palace last Sunday was off-the-wall on
purpose, as if to show that Young is still a step ahead
of us all. It's hard to believe that the man took a
second of the thing at face value — that could be why
it came off so well and seemed such a great success.
And it did seem a great success. Young sang every
thing with the straight face and staged movement
required of a truly mythic rock star, and generally set
out to be as non-Neil Young as possible. In the first
song of the first set he included two verses that he has
repeatedly labelled "the worst things I ever wrote" —
in the second set he ran around like a madman beat
ing on his electric guitar. (He'd bragged, in the first
set, that he would get one someday.) And he sang
very well, and even managed to turn in some fine
electric solo work. Very strange it was. Without a
doubt the funniest and most invigorating of concerts
in awhile. And Young, I'm sure, was farfrom the least
amused.

Well goddamn. There he was, as bent and strange
as ever, standing dead center in what could almost
have been a Kiss concert. Neil Young. With fake snow
falling from a fake snow container in the ceiling, and a
stage crew dressed up like those shrunken monks in
Star Wars. On the corner of the stage were two atten
tive cone-heads; in the center was a microphone a
good 25 feet tall.
It was all very strange. From the beginning, when
the audience received their official 3-D glasses, it was
very quickly apparent that this was not what we'd
expected. After all, the tour was supposed to be con
nected with Young's latest album, and Young's latest
album is not like this at all. The album is almost
entirely acoustic, to begin with; the subject matter is
notable for its lack of musical loose ends, and for the
relative absence of vague desperation that Neil
Young purists covet. The concert, then, would have
been low-key, if it had been like the album — ba
lanced and calm, and sparsely produced, with Young
and little else.
But no. This concert, at the Cow Palace, was purely
and simply a zoo. Young sang a few songs off the new
album, and he sang them as they sounded there, but
the attraction here was not so much the music as it
was the show itself. It was called "Rust Never Sleeps,"
which may or may not have meant something — the
point of it all seemed to be tied up in an as-yet unre
corded number that ended both the first and second
sets. It was a song about music, and about things lost

to age — if those particular subjects are not rare in
Young's music, this offering made its point quite
clearly.
My, my
Hey, hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
Its better to burn out
Than to fade away
My, my
Hey, hey.
