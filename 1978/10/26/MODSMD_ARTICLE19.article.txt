## Tokyo Quartet impressive 
### 
The Lively Arts presented the
Tokyo String Quartet last Sun
day afternoon in a program in
cluding Haydn's Quartet No. 1,
Opus 76, Beethoven's Quartet
in b flat Major, Opus 130, and
Ravel's Quartet in F Major.
When in peak form, the
Tokyo String Quartet is as ex
citing and mature as the
world's best. In their concert
last Sunday at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, they proved capable
of the greatest virtuosity and
musicianship, most notably in
Maurice Ravel'sSfr/ng quartet.
The balance was excellent
throughout, the tempo com
fortable and, most satisfying
of all, the understanding the
quartet brought to the work
was superb.
The second movement,
famous for its passages of
simultaneous pizzicato in the
four instruments, contained
excitement natural to the com
position, but too often lacking
in the many readings this work
receives. With a sure sense of
direction, the Tokyo presented
this movement as it was meant
to be — tres rythme.
In balance and contrast, the
third movement was contemp
lative. Too often, one knows
not how to wait, but every mus
ical thought here was placed
perfectly in its time — never
rushed. The last movement
brought many to their feet; it
was that thrilling, with the
climax sighted and built so well
that we in the audience were

whirled along with the Tokyo
and deposited with bated
breath right at the last fortis
simo. The curtain calls after
that rendition of the Ravel were
well deserved.
The program began with
Haydn's Quartet No. 1, Op. 76.
Though somewhat short on the
humor characteristic to
Haydn's works, it was played
with good poise and tone. . . .
At times one felt the tempo was
slightly hurried, with ques
tionable musical benefit, but
the performance was generally
well-conceived.
One had more questions
about the second work,
Beethoven's Op. 130. Written
in Beethoven's last years, it
contains the genius, insight,
perspective and stature of a
master musician able to ex
press his sagacity with calm as
surance. He was at the height
of his creativity as reflected by
his late quartets. They are
complete in themselves, as
complete works, and at any
stage in those works, one
doesn't feel the need to refer
to what has preceded or what
will follow.
Thus it was with a sense of
expectation with which I lis
tened to the Tokyo perform
Op. 130. Their sound was quite
solid and coherent. The ba
lance and sense of ensemble
was good, but, as though from
too much rehearsal, the
meditative quality of Beeth
oven's genius didn't emerge.

There was too much direction
in their playing, as though they
were anticipating passages to
come rather than allowing the
music its moment.
In the first movement,
Harado, the first violinist, gave
his runs a floating, insubstan
tial tone, lacking especially in
the higher registers. The last
eighth-note in the opening
motif of the second movement
was "kicked," or accented,
making the musical sense
rather awkward to convey,
especially as the tempo gave
the sense of a rush to play fast.
There were some very nice piz
zicato sections in the third
movement, and a good,
thoughtful separation of the
motif at the end of the fourth.
The fifth, however, which con
tained the magical section
headed Beklemmt, more than
the others, lacked integrity.
This section was almost vio
lent, and lost the hesitant, ap
prehensive wonder that one
would like to hear in these six
measures.
It takes a great amount of
musical maturity to play late
Beethoven as it should be
played, and very fine quartets
sometimes miss the mark. The
Tokyo gave it a nice sound, if
not quite a musically complete
interpretation.
Kazu Isomura
I was fortunate enough to
converse with Kazu Isomura,
the violist, after the concert. I
asked him about their change

of program. They had origi
nally planned to play Men
delssohn's Variations and
Scherzo, Op. 8, which was re
placed by the Haydn.
"The Mendelssohn is a nice
piece, and it is fun to play. The
reason we did not perform it is
artistic. We like the Men
delssohn, and since we were
asked by CBS/Columbia to re
cord a complete set of Men
delssohn quartets, we thought
we would learn that quartet
and perform it on this tour of
the West. But it is not so impor
tant a piece. After three weeks,
we got tired of it. We decided
to play the Haydn, which is a
more important quartet."
Isomura went on to com
ment on the audience here,
saying that "Audiences are
very different. In Japan, you
hear no noise during a perfor
mance. An audience can either
be quiet because they are re
ally listening, or they can be
quiet because they're afraid to
relax. You must not be so inhi
bited to enjoy music. But with
the Japanese, a person in the
audience doesn't respond en
thusiastically if no one else
does. They look around first.
New York people have a lot of
concerts to hear, and they hear
people from all over the world,
so they know when something
is good or something is bad.
We like playing for young
people, and we like playing
university concerts."

with good poise and tone. . . .
At times one felt the tempo was
slightly hurried, with ques
tionable musical benefit, but
the performance was generally
well-conceived.
One had more questions
about the second work,
Beethoven's Op. 130. Written
in Beethoven's last years, it
contains the genius, insight,
perspective and stature of a
master musician able to ex
press his sagacity with calm as
surance. He was at the height
of his creativity as reflected by
his late quartets. They are
complete in themselves, as
complete works, and at any
stage in those works, one
doesn't feel the need to refer
to what has preceded or what
will follow.
Thus it was with a sense of
expectation with which I lis
tened to the Tokyo perform
Op. 130. Their sound was quite
solid and coherent. The ba
lance and sense of ensemble
was good, but, as though from
too much rehearsal, the
meditative quality of Beeth
oven's genius didn't emerge.

There was too much direction
in their playing, as though they
were anticipating passages to
come rather than allowing the
music its moment.
In the first movement,
Harado, the first violinist, gave
his runs a floating, insubstan
tial tone, lacking especially in
the higher registers. The last
eighth-note in the opening
motif of the second movement
was "kicked," or accented,
making the musical sense
rather awkward to convey,
especially as the tempo gave
the sense of a rush to play fast.
There were some very nice piz
zicato sections in the third
movement, and a good,
thoughtful separation of the
motif at the end of the fourth.
The fifth, however, which con
tained the magical section
headed Beklemmt, more than
the others, lacked integrity.
This section was almost vio
lent, and lost the hesitant, ap
prehensive wonder that one
would like to hear in these six
measures.
It takes a great amount of
musical maturity to play late
Beethoven as it should be
played, and very fine quartets
sometimes miss the mark. The
Tokyo gave it a nice sound, if
not quite a musically complete
interpretation.
Kazu Isomura
I was fortunate enough to
converse with Kazu Isomura,
the violist, after the concert. I
asked him about their change

of program. They had origi
nally planned to play Men
delssohn's Variations and
Scherzo, Op. 8, which was re
placed by the Haydn.
"The Mendelssohn is a nice
piece, and it is fun to play. The
reason we did not perform it is
artistic. We like the Men
delssohn, and since we were
asked by CBS/Columbia to re
cord a complete set of Men
delssohn quartets, we thought
we would learn that quartet
and perform it on this tour of
the West. But it is not so impor
tant a piece. After three weeks,
we got tired of it. We decided
to play the Haydn, which is a
more important quartet."
Isomura went on to com
ment on the audience here,
saying that "Audiences are
very different. In Japan, you
hear no noise during a perfor
mance. An audience can either
be quiet because they are re
ally listening, or they can be
quiet because they're afraid to
relax. You must not be so inhi
bited to enjoy music. But with
the Japanese, a person in the
audience doesn't respond en
thusiastically if no one else
does. They look around first.
New York people have a lot of
concerts to hear, and they hear
people from all over the world,
so they know when something
is good or something is bad.
We like playing for young
people, and we like playing
university concerts."

The Lively Arts presented the
Tokyo String Quartet last Sun
day afternoon in a program in
cluding Haydn's Quartet No. 1,
Opus 76, Beethoven's Quartet
in b flat Major, Opus 130, and
Ravel's Quartet in F Major.
When in peak form, the
Tokyo String Quartet is as ex
citing and mature as the
world's best. In their concert
last Sunday at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, they proved capable
of the greatest virtuosity and
musicianship, most notably in
Maurice Ravel'sSfr/ng quartet.
The balance was excellent
throughout, the tempo com
fortable and, most satisfying
of all, the understanding the
quartet brought to the work
was superb.
The second movement,
famous for its passages of
simultaneous pizzicato in the
four instruments, contained
excitement natural to the com
position, but too often lacking
in the many readings this work
receives. With a sure sense of
direction, the Tokyo presented
this movement as it was meant
to be — tres rythme.
In balance and contrast, the
third movement was contemp
lative. Too often, one knows
not how to wait, but every mus
ical thought here was placed
perfectly in its time — never
rushed. The last movement
brought many to their feet; it
was that thrilling, with the
climax sighted and built so well
that we in the audience were

whirled along with the Tokyo
and deposited with bated
breath right at the last fortis
simo. The curtain calls after
that rendition of the Ravel were
well deserved.
The program began with
Haydn's Quartet No. 1, Op. 76.
Though somewhat short on the

tained the magical section
headed Beklemmt, more than
the others, lacked integrity.
This section was almost vio
lent, and lost the hesitant, ap
prehensive wonder that one
would like to hear in these six
measures.
It takes a great amount of
musical maturity to play late
Beethoven as it should be
played, and very fine quartets
sometimes miss the mark. The
Tokyo gave it a nice sound, if
not quite a musically complete
interpretation.
Kazu Isomura
I was fortunate enough to
converse with Kazu Isomura,
the violist, after the concert. I
asked him about their change

of program. They had origi
nally planned to play Men
delssohn's Variations and
Scherzo, Op. 8, which was re
placed by the Haydn.
"The Mendelssohn is a nice
piece, and it is fun to play. The
reason we did not perform it is
artistic. We like the Men
delssohn, and since we were
asked by CBS/Columbia to re
cord a complete set of Men
delssohn quartets, we thought
we would learn that quartet
and perform it on this tour of
the West. But it is not so impor
tant a piece. After three weeks,
we got tired of it. We decided
to play the Haydn, which is a
more important quartet."
Isomura went on to com
ment on the audience here,
saying that "Audiences are
very different. In Japan, you
hear no noise during a perfor
mance. An audience can either
be quiet because they are re
ally listening, or they can be
quiet because they're afraid to
relax. You must not be so inhi
bited to enjoy music. But with
the Japanese, a person in the
audience doesn't respond en
thusiastically if no one else
does. They look around first.
New York people have a lot of
concerts to hear, and they hear
people from all over the world,
so they know when something
is good or something is bad.
We like playing for young
people, and we like playing
university concerts."

The Lively Arts presented the
Tokyo String Quartet last Sun
day afternoon in a program in
cluding Haydn's Quartet No. 1,
Opus 76, Beethoven's Quartet
in b flat Major, Opus 130, and
Ravel's Quartet in F Major.
When in peak form, the
Tokyo String Quartet is as ex
citing and mature as the
world's best. In their concert
last Sunday at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, they proved capable
of the greatest virtuosity and
musicianship, most notably in
Maurice Ravel'sSfr/ng quartet.
The balance was excellent
throughout, the tempo com
fortable and, most satisfying
of all, the understanding the
quartet brought to the work
was superb.
The second movement,
famous for its passages of
simultaneous pizzicato in the
four instruments, contained
excitement natural to the com
position, but too often lacking
in the many readings this work
receives. With a sure sense of
direction, the Tokyo presented
this movement as it was meant
to be — tres rythme.
In balance and contrast, the
third movement was contemp
lative. Too often, one knows
not how to wait, but every mus
ical thought here was placed
perfectly in its time — never
rushed. The last movement
brought many to their feet; it
was that thrilling, with the
climax sighted and built so well
that we in the audience were

whirled along with the Tokyo
and deposited with bated
breath right at the last fortis
simo. The curtain calls after
that rendition of the Ravel were
well deserved.
The program began with
Haydn's Quartet No. 1, Op. 76.
Though somewhat short on the
humor characteristic to
Haydn's works, it was played
with good poise and tone. . . .
At times one felt the tempo was
slightly hurried, with ques
tionable musical benefit, but
the performance was generally
well-conceived.
One had more questions
about the second work,
Beethoven's Op. 130. Written
in Beethoven's last years, it
contains the genius, insight,
perspective and stature of a
master musician able to ex
press his sagacity with calm as
surance. He was at the height
of his creativity as reflected by
his late quartets. They are
complete in themselves, as
complete works, and at any
stage in those works, one
doesn't feel the need to refer
to what has preceded or what
will follow.
Thus it was with a sense of
expectation with which I lis
tened to the Tokyo perform
Op. 130. Their sound was quite
solid and coherent. The ba
lance and sense of ensemble
was good, but, as though from
too much rehearsal, the
meditative quality of Beeth
oven's genius didn't emerge.

There was too much direction
in their playing, as though they
were anticipating passages to
come rather than allowing the
music its moment.
In the first movement,
Harado, the first violinist, gave
his runs a floating, insubstan
tial tone, lacking especially in
the higher registers. The last
eighth-note in the opening
motif of the second movement
was "kicked," or accented,
making the musical sense
rather awkward to convey,
especially as the tempo gave
the sense of a rush to play fast.
There were some very nice piz
zicato sections in the third
movement, and a good,
thoughtful separation of the
motif at the end of the fourth.
The fifth, however, which con
tained the magical section
headed Beklemmt, more than
the others, lacked integrity.
This section was almost vio
lent, and lost the hesitant, ap
prehensive wonder that one
would like to hear in these six
measures.
It takes a great amount of
musical maturity to play late
Beethoven as it should be
played, and very fine quartets
sometimes miss the mark. The
Tokyo gave it a nice sound, if
not quite a musically complete
interpretation.
