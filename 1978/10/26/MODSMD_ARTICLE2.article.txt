# Emigration difficult for Russian Jews
## Rally speaker asks for American aid 
### CARLA NEASEL 
"Hi everybody. I have come here
to tell you something of what I
know." With these stark words,
Soviet Jewish emigre, Sonja Slepak,
began an address to a crowd of
nearly 200 yesterday during a noon
rally on Soviet ]ewry.
Slepak, a Russian lew who was fi
nally allowed to emigrate to Israel
a few years ago, talked about soviet
oppression of )ewish people.
"As a lew, you cannot worship.
There is one synagogue in Moscow,
and there are eight, almost nine mill
ion people," Slepak said.
"This and other kinds of churches
are set up to show the tourists that
there is freedom of religion in Russia.
That is not true. The workers in the
synagogues are workers forthe KGB.
"We are told to trust in the power
of the communists, but not in God,"
he added.
A University mechanical engineer
ing professor, who has been to the
Soviet Union, also spoke at the rally.
Prof. |oel Ferziger said that, until
1967, Soviet lews were fairly well as
similated into the Russian culture.
The break came, he explained, when
the Soviet-backed Arabs lost the

Six-Day War to Israel. The loss, Fer
ziger said, triggered a rash of anti-
Semitism which was thinly shrouded
under the cause of "anti-Zionism."
This oppression, he added, led
many Jews to seek permanent emig
ration to Israel or other countries.
The Russian government granted few
emigration requests, he said.
Few requests granted
According to Ferziger, two things
happen when a lew applies for emig
ration. "First, he gets kicked out of
his job. Second, his friends don't
have any contact with him again."
Those who do associate with the
applicant are hassled and subjected
to extensive interrogation.
Slepak told of the difficulties in
volved in applying for emigration.
"In the beginning, it was very hard
(to apply) because they wouldn't
even take your application. Some
times, they would take you to a men
tal hospital, because why would any
one want to leave the' Republic?"
Russian leaders report that people
are being allowed to leave, but the
numbers are misleading, Slepak
maintains. The few who are allowed
to leave the country are those living
in the rural areas; inhabitants of the

larger cities like Moscow and Lenin
grad rarely see their applications ap
proved. Scientists and educated in
dividuals aren't allowed to leave be
cause they know too many "secrets,."
Slepak continued. Consequently,
the attempts by inhabitants of the
major cities to emigrate may "die
out" because the people are tired of
isolation, arrest and fear.
Ferziger added: "These people
wait in isolation for years. They need
people like us to come in and tell
them we're behind their cause."
international battle'
Slepak seemed anxious to make it
clear that what happens now de
pends on "how the world reacts to
our message." It cannot be just an
internal Soviet affair — it must be an
international battle, he said.
Slepak pointed out that the United
States has many connections with
Russia, and that the Soviet Union
needs these alliances, no matter
how. "If you write to your senators
and congressmen...they cannot ig
nore your request, and Russiacannot
ignore the action taken (by the gov
ernment)."
Tables were set up in White Plaza
for students who wanted to help the

"refuseniks," a term coined to de
scribe Soviet Jews who are refused
emigration. Many students signed
petitions which will be sent to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and Soviet Party
Chairman Leonid Brezhnev. Stu
dents could also pledge money to a
telegraph bank which sends mes
sages to the Kremlin. In addition, the
aderesses of some refuseniks were
available.
Slepak urged students to write to
those families who, he said, "would
greatly appreciate supportive mes
sages.
Messages 'appreciated'
"So please," Slepak said, "send
your letters to these people and to let
them know someone cares, and to
give them strength to go on. Please,
continue to work."
After nearly a full minute of
applause, the rally organizers step
ped up to the microphone and led
the crowd in an Israeli hymn, saying
"The people of Israel live!"
The rally was sponsored by the
Hillet Committee for Oppressed
Jewry. After the rally, about 50 stu
dents became involved in a heated
argument about Jews in Russia,
which seemed to be largely insti
gated by a member of the Com
munist Youth Brigade, who was dis
tributing newsletters.

international battle'
Slepak seemed anxious to make it
clear that what happens now de
pends on "how the world reacts to
our message." It cannot be just an
internal Soviet affair — it must be an
international battle, he said.
Slepak pointed out that the United
States has many connections with
Russia, and that the Soviet Union
needs these alliances, no matter
how. "If you write to your senators
and congressmen...they cannot ig
nore your request, and Russiacannot
ignore the action taken (by the gov
ernment)."
Tables were set up in White Plaza
for students who wanted to help the

"refuseniks," a term coined to de
scribe Soviet Jews who are refused
emigration. Many students signed
petitions which will be sent to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and Soviet Party
Chairman Leonid Brezhnev. Stu
dents could also pledge money to a
telegraph bank which sends mes
sages to the Kremlin. In addition, the
aderesses of some refuseniks were
available.
Slepak urged students to write to
those families who, he said, "would
greatly appreciate supportive mes
sages.
Messages 'appreciated'
"So please," Slepak said, "send
your letters to these people and to let
them know someone cares, and to
give them strength to go on. Please,
continue to work."
After nearly a full minute of
applause, the rally organizers step
ped up to the microphone and led
the crowd in an Israeli hymn, saying
"The people of Israel live!"
The rally was sponsored by the
Hillet Committee for Oppressed
Jewry. After the rally, about 50 stu
dents became involved in a heated
argument about Jews in Russia,
which seemed to be largely insti
gated by a member of the Com
munist Youth Brigade, who was dis
tributing newsletters.


Sonja Slepak (left) was one of two speakers featured at a noon rally in White Plaza
yesterday. Slepak and Mechanical Engineering Prof. Joel Ferziger described the
situation faced by Soviet Jews who are trying to emigrate.
"Hi everybody. I have come here
to tell you something of what I
know." With these stark words,
Soviet Jewish emigre, Sonja Slepak,
began an address to a crowd of
nearly 200 yesterday during a noon
rally on Soviet ]ewry.
Slepak, a Russian lew who was fi
nally allowed to emigrate to Israel
a few years ago, talked about soviet
oppression of )ewish people.
"As a lew, you cannot worship.
There is one synagogue in Moscow,
and there are eight, almost nine mill
ion people," Slepak said.
"This and other kinds of churches
are set up to show the tourists that
there is freedom of religion in Russia.
That is not true. The workers in the
synagogues are workers forthe KGB.
"We are told to trust in the power
of the communists, but not in God,"
he added.
A University mechanical engineer
ing professor, who has been to the
Soviet Union, also spoke at the rally.
Prof. |oel Ferziger said that, until
1967, Soviet lews were fairly well as
similated into the Russian culture.
The break came, he explained, when
the Soviet-backed Arabs lost the

Six-Day War to Israel. The loss, Fer
ziger said, triggered a rash of anti-
Semitism which was thinly shrouded
under the cause of "anti-Zionism."
This oppression, he added, led
many Jews to seek permanent emig
ration to Israel or other countries.
The Russian government granted few
emigration requests, he said.
Few requests granted
According to Ferziger, two things
happen when a lew applies for emig
ration. "First, he gets kicked out of
his job. Second, his friends don't
have any contact with him again."
Those who do associate with the
applicant are hassled and subjected
to extensive interrogation.
Slepak told of the difficulties in
volved in applying for emigration.
"In the beginning, it was very hard
(to apply) because they wouldn't
even take your application. Some
times, they would take you to a men
tal hospital, because why would any
one want to leave the' Republic?"
Russian leaders report that people
are being allowed to leave, but the
numbers are misleading, Slepak
maintains. The few who are allowed
to leave the country are those living
in the rural areas; inhabitants of the

larger cities like Moscow and Lenin
grad rarely see their applications ap
proved. Scientists and educated in
dividuals aren't allowed to leave be
cause they know too many "secrets,."
Slepak continued. Consequently,
the attempts by inhabitants of the
major cities to emigrate may "die

isolation, arrest and fear.
