## Posin Dance coming to Stanford 
### 
Kathryn Posin Dance Company is the
first professional dance company to visit
this academic year, and they promise to be
an exciting beginning to the Lively Arts at
Stanford's dance series. Part of the ex
citement will be that we will see the com
pany not only in a performance on Satur
day, Oct. 28, but also in two master classes
and a lecture-demonstration with an open
reception following on Friday, Oct. 27.
Posin herself is a native of the Midwest,
but left to study dance at Bennington Col
lege in Vermont. She has also studied
composition with such renowned
choreographers as Merce Cunningham
and Anna Sokolow. In addition to per
forming with Sakelow's company, Posin
has danced with Valerie Bettis, the Ameri
i can Dance Theater at Lincoln Center and
the Dance Theater Workshop professional
company.
Critically acclaimed
A choreographer and teacher, as well as
a performer, Posin's works are part of the
repertory of companies such as Eliot Feld
Ballet and the Juilliard Dance Ensemble, as
well as her own company. The qualities of

Posin's choreography which led critic
Clive Barnes to call her piece Waves, the
best piece by a young choreographer that
he had ever seen, have led companies
such as Ballet West, the Ohio Ballet and
the Nederlands Dans Theater, to commis
sion works from her.
She is also the subject of a PBS movie,
Kathy's Dance, to be broadcast nationally
later this year, and she choreographed the
movement for the recent New York
Shakespeare Festival production of Anton
Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, directed
by Andri Serban.
As Stanford is an educational institution,
the Lively Arts at Stanford program pays
special attention to the quality of, and
commitment to teaching by the artists it
selects. Posin has taught at other univer
sities in the United States such as the Har
vard Summer School Dance Center, as
well as abroad at the Institut Etudes et Re
ncontres Artistiques in Geneva. Posin will
teach two classes during her time here,
one for advanced students on Thursday
Oct. 26 at 2:15, and one for beginners at
3:15 on Friday Oct. 27. Both are free of

charge arid will be held in Roble Gym's
studio.
Also on Friday the company will give a
free lecture-demonstration at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium to be followed by a
reception at Dag Hammarskjold House at
592 Alvarado Row.
The performance of the six-member
company on Saturday night will open with
Posin's Waves. The company members
have strong classical ballet training but
perform in a mixture of jazz, modern and
ballet idioms. Waves is a group-motion
study in green and blue choreographed in
1975. Doris Hering of Dancemagazine has
said that Waves captures the quality of
water without being imitative. Posin con
centrates here on the weights and forces
of water translating these naturally onto
the dancers' bodies.
The other pieces on Saturday's prog
ram, to be given at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium are Bach Pieces (1973), Ghost
Train (1973) and Clear Signals (1978). This
engagement is in cooperation with the
California Arts Council and is supported in
part by funds from the National Endow
ment for the Arts.
