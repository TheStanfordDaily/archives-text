## Tjader at the Commons 
### 
"College students are play
ing a greater and greater part in
maintaining the jazz tradition,"
commented jazz vibist Cal
Tjader, who brings his group to
the Stanford Commons on Oc
tober 27.
"We try to bring a type of
balance to our music which will
present true jazz, but will pre
sent it on a level which younger
audiences can appreciate.
We'll do the old standards such
as 'Summertime' and 'Round
Midnight,' but we'll also mix in
contemporary songs like 'This
Masquerade' or 'If." We want
to achieve a balance.""
Tjader is certainly a part of
the jazz tradition he speaks ab
out. For two decades he has
been established as one of the
top jazz vibe and marimba
players. His reputation has
spread nationally, yet he has
made San Francisco his per
manent residence. Thus, over
the years he has added consid
erable excitement to the Bay
Area jazz scene.
"I've seen my own kid listen
to that three chord garbage —
you know what kind of music
I'm talking about? — yet when
he doesn't think I'm around he
listens to (Count) Basie. He
doesn't want to admit that he
enjoys it.
Growing awareness
"Playing as a soloist with col
lege bands, or bringing my
group to campuses for con
certs or clinics, I've seen a
growing awareness of jazz on
the part of the younger genera
tion. The music is alive and
growing."

Tjader will be bringing one
of his finest groups to Stanford
for his concert at the Com
mons. The amazing Clare
Fisher will be on piano; Fisher
is one of the most talented
keyboardists in jazz who con
tinues to play as a sideman.
Fisher could certainly start his
own group, yet he appears
content to contribute his ta
lents to the Tjader group.
"Fisher is amazing both as a
musician and a composer,"
remarked Tjader. "Con
sequently we use many of his
own compositions for the
group's repetoire."
Tjader cites Lionel Hampton
and Milt Jackson as his two
greatest influences. "When
Jackson first started playing he
caused quite a stir. Most vibe
players before Milt adopted
keyboard techniques to the
vibes. Milt, instead, phrased
his playing much more like a
tenor saxophone. His playing
was smoother and more
melodic."
Sure and smooth
Tjader's playing exudes the
same sure and smooth melodi
cism. He rarely uses four mal
lets, as does Gary Burton for
example (an artist for which
Tjader has the greatest admira
tion). Instead he works to
exploit the melodic rather than
the harmonic aspects of his in
strument. This is doubtless
why Tjader has little interest in
leading a pianoless group —
something many other vibes
players have experimented
with.
"I began basically as a

drummer and a percussionist,
but later added the vibraharp
and the marimba to my re
petoire." (Note: a little known
trivia fact is that Tjader was
drummer for Dave Brubeck's
first trio in the early '50s). "This
was along the same lines as
what Lionel Hampton was
doing — he was both an ex
perienced drummer and vibe
player. Most vibists begin as
either pianists or percus
sionists; I started on the lat
ter."
Tjader has played larger out
door areas such as the Creek
Theater in Berkeley and the
Frost Arnpitheater here at Stan
ford, yet he also enjoys the
smaller, more intimate atmos
phere of a club."The larger
places are exciting, but you
have to go to a club to get that
smooth intimate type of feel
ing. The old Blackhawk in San
Francisco, or the El Matador
(which is no longer a jazz club)
were great places to play and
great places to listen to music."
The Stanford concert will be
a night-time affair and will fea
ture beer. These two ingre
dients, along with Tjader's
music, should promise an in
teresting evening.

same sure and smooth melodi
cism. He rarely uses four mal
lets, as does Gary Burton for
example (an artist for which
Tjader has the greatest admira
tion). Instead he works to
exploit the melodic rather than
the harmonic aspects of his in
strument. This is doubtless
why Tjader has little interest in
leading a pianoless group —
something many other vibes
players have experimented
with.
"I began basically as a

drummer and a percussionist,
but later added the vibraharp
and the marimba to my re
petoire." (Note: a little known
trivia fact is that Tjader was
drummer for Dave Brubeck's
first trio in the early '50s). "This
was along the same lines as
what Lionel Hampton was
doing — he was both an ex
perienced drummer and vibe
player. Most vibists begin as
either pianists or percus
sionists; I started on the lat
ter."
Tjader has played larger out
door areas such as the Creek
Theater in Berkeley and the
Frost Arnpitheater here at Stan
ford, yet he also enjoys the
smaller, more intimate atmos
phere of a club."The larger
places are exciting, but you
have to go to a club to get that
smooth intimate type of feel
ing. The old Blackhawk in San
Francisco, or the El Matador
(which is no longer a jazz club)
were great places to play and
great places to listen to music."
The Stanford concert will be
a night-time affair and will fea
ture beer. These two ingre
dients, along with Tjader's
music, should promise an in
teresting evening.
"College students are play
ing a greater and greater part in
maintaining the jazz tradition,"
commented jazz vibist Cal
Tjader, who brings his group to
the Stanford Commons on Oc
tober 27.
"We try to bring a type of
balance to our music which will
present true jazz, but will pre
sent it on a level which younger
audiences can appreciate.
We'll do the old standards such
as 'Summertime' and 'Round
Midnight,' but we'll also mix in
contemporary songs like 'This
Masquerade' or 'If." We want
to achieve a balance.""
Tjader is certainly a part of
the jazz tradition he speaks ab
out. For two decades he has
been established as one of the
top jazz vibe and marimba
players. His reputation has
spread nationally, yet he has
made San Francisco his per
manent residence. Thus, over
the years he has added consid
erable excitement to the Bay
Area jazz scene.
"I've seen my own kid listen
to that three chord garbage —
you know what kind of music
I'm talking about? — yet when
he doesn't think I'm around he
listens to (Count) Basie. He
doesn't want to admit that he
enjoys it.
Growing awareness
"Playing as a soloist with col
lege bands, or bringing my
group to campuses for con
certs or clinics, I've seen a
growing awareness of jazz on
the part of the younger genera
tion. The music is alive and
growing."

Tjader will be bringing one
of his finest groups to Stanford
for his concert at the Com
mons. The amazing Clare
Fisher will be on piano; Fisher
is one of the most talented
keyboardists in jazz who con
tinues to play as a sideman.
Fisher could certainly start his
own group, yet he appears
content to contribute his ta
lents to the Tjader group.
"Fisher is amazing both as a
musician and a composer,"
remarked Tjader. "Con
sequently we use many of his
own compositions for the
group's repetoire."
Tjader cites Lionel Hampton
and Milt Jackson as his two
greatest influences. "When
Jackson first started playing he
caused quite a stir. Most vibe
players before Milt adopted
keyboard techniques to the
vibes. Milt, instead, phrased
his playing much more like a
tenor saxophone. His playing
was smoother and more
melodic."
Sure and smooth
