## Readymades rarin' for Stanford rave-up 
### 
You may be too old to trick
or-treat this Halloween, but
you're certainly young enough
to let loose and celebrate the
occasion with the
Readymades. This Saturday
night at 9 and 11 p.m. ASSU
Special Events is presenting the
new wave band from San Fran
cisco at the Peninsula's latest
nightspot, Stanford's intimate
Commons. Below is one rock
fan's impressions of this fast
rising act.
Following last summer's
Ramones' revelation, dozens
of enthusiastic young San
Franciscans laid aside pens,
brushes and books to pick up
guitars and form bands. Many
of these punk and new wave
outfits exploded at the

Mabuhay Gardens, quickly
elevating the once unknown
Phillipine restaurant into the
hippest spot in town, but few
groups achieved more than
lots of noise and some passing
attention.
Far beyond
The Readymades are one act
that started with all the others,
but through determination, as
tute management and more
than a smattering of talent, has
gone far beyond them. Gigs
early in their career at the
Mabuhay saw leader/singer/
songwriter Jonathan Postal
hurling loud, acerbic remarks
at Avenger punkette Penelope
between his numbers on stage.
These days Jonathan no
longer holds a grudge against

his former bandmate. After
leaving the punk Avengers,
which he originally helped
form, Postal joined forces with
jazz-schooled, pop-inclined
keyboard and sax player Morey
Goldstein.
Postal, a successful com
mercial photographer and
ex-art director, cared a lot
about style and the look he
wanted for the band. Morey
won awards for jazz arrange
ments and sax while still in high
school. In college, he led both
jazz fusion and rock bands.
Therefore Jonathan was
elected to oversee the group's
image; Morey was named mus
ical director.
The two adopted the band's
name from Marcel Duchamp's
dada theory of "lost-found
sculptures," a conceptual twist
in which ordinary objects are
shifted out of their normal con
texts or rearranged into
strange combinations, thereby
assuming a new artistic iden
tity. (The first such readymade
exhibited was a urinal tipped
on its back.)
"We chose the name
Readymades because we are
using something that has al
ready existed," Postal explains.
"Musically and culturally, we
can't come up with something
totally new, because the notes
have already been written, all
the words have been used. All
you can do is come up with dif
ferent juxtapositions. We're
using stuff that's already there.
Therefore, it's 'readymade.' "
Monotonal
The Readymades feature
Postal's Lou Reed/Brian Ferry
monotonal approach to sing
ing, with two-part background
harmony vocals reminiscent of

the Beach Boys over a pop ap
proach to rock and roll. It's sort
of like the Velvet Underground
played by the Dave Clark Five.
The versatility of the band —
Morey Goldstein (keyboards,
sax, vocals), Wayne Ditzel
(bass, guitar, vocals) and Paul
Zahl (recent replacement for
Brittley Black on drums) —
gives it a sound that resembles
the Who, Roxy Music, early
Modern Lovers and Johnny
Rivers.
"Our songs are kind of like
what we're really thinking ab
out," Postal notes. "I some
times think about sex, some
times I feel like violence. But I
think about other things too
. . . nuclear reactors blowing
up — being trapped in a cul
ture that manipulates people
through the media. How we're
manipulated into thinking
we're happy when we're not
really happy. Some things re
ally bother me. And so we write
songs about those things. But
it's not all serious. Rock and
roll is fun."
In their year-and-a-bit-old
career the Readymades have
already scored an impressive
list of accomplishments. They
received a deal to record a
three-song LP on Automatic
Records when Automatic pres
ident Gregg Turner saw them
play their first ever Mabuhay
gig. The disc sold 10,000 copies
and gained heavy radioplay
here and rave reviews in Bri
tain's rock piess. Shortly af
terwards, Sandy Pearlman,
producer/manager of Blue
Oyster Cult and the Dictators
(and most recently, producer
of the Clash's second LP),
caught the band in action again
at the Mab, liked what he heard

and told the group he would
produce a demo LP.
In the studio
Pearlman took them
Wally Heider's studio in early)
April and spent severe);:
thousand dollars producing tj'
demo which contains striking,"
versions of several songs, in*',
eluding "Electric Toys'}'
(perhaps their catchiest, mostj
commercial tune), the Bowies*!
que "Terry Is My
Cadet," and "415" (a
term designating a disturbance]
of the peace created by playing
illegal music, crafted into the!
band's rockingest anthem). !<
'»j
Besides headlining theirown'
shows weekly around the
area (including two wellfi
received dates in laid-back-
Santa Cruz), the Readymadesj
have opened for such top actS<
as Patti Smith, the Tom Robing
son Band, Greg kihn, the FlaJ*
min' Croovies and the!
Stranglers. They're currently!
considering which of three re{j
cording contract offers to ao,
cept. J;
■ i
Having seen t he j
Readymades in action at least
eight times during the pas|;
year, I've become a convinced;
fan. They've progressed stead};
ily from a fledgling concept
band disclaiming themselves;
from their punk peers at th 6
Mabuhay (see "Pinhead") into;
a distinctive, exciting act which
can work an audience into a
frenzy. They're the best S.F.'s
got to offer, so dress up, com£
round to the Commons and
have some good fun. P.S. If
you do still want to trick-ort
treat, there'll be plenty of time
to do so before or after th 4
Readymades' shows.
