# 'Refusenik's' family exiled to Siberia, son allowed to leave
## 
### RACHEL BAGBY 
This past June — eight months after Sonja Slepak was
granted an exit visa and allowed to leave Moscow for
Israel — the Soviet government sentenced Slepak's pa
rents to five years exile in Siberia.
The official charge against Vladimir and Marija Slepak
was "malicious hooliganism." Their crime — displaying
from their Moscow apartment a banner, on which was
scrawled, "Let us join our son in Israel."
"The trouble began in 1969 when my family first
applied for a permit to migrate to Israel," said Sonja
Slepak in a Daily interview, following yesterday's solidar
ity rally for Soviet Jewish prisoners.
"Our parents were refused," he added. The reason
given by the Soviets was "security considerations," ac
cording to Slepak.
But, this did not dampen the Slepak's determination
to emigrate to Israel. According to a 1977 report, by the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry, the Slepaks
applied for — and were refused — exit visas 12 times.
Rights fight
"My father became a leader in the Jewish rights
movement in Russia," Slepak said. "Our entire family
was involved and because of this we were harassed by
the K.G.B. (Soviet secret police)."
According to Slepak, the K.G.B. placed his family
under constant surveillance.
"Our house was searched several times," he said.
"Any literature about the West, judaica (materials relat
ing to Judaism) and human rights was confiscated.
"Whenever we protested publicly we were arrested,"
Slepak added.
The Soviet government also used other means of
harassment. According to Slepak, his father lost his job
as chief of the Department of Research in Television,
because of pressure from the K.G.B.
"Many applicants for exit visas are dismissed from
their employment," Slepak said. "In other instances,
applicants are demoted and their salaries decreased."
Now at UC-Santa Cruz
Despite Soviet attempts to silence them, the Slepaks
persisted in protesting. In October 1977, Sonja Slepak

was granted an exit visa and allowed to go to Israel, then
the United States, where he now attends UC-Santa Cruz.
"The Soviets let me out in an attempt to influence the
Belgrade conference," Slepak said.
According to a June 1977 New York Times article, the
Belgrade conference was to assess whether the Helsinki
accord had been observed. Signers of the pact — the
United States, Canada and 33 European countries in
cluding Russia — pledged to respect human rights.
Principle VII of the Helsinki agreement contains a
commitment by the participating countries to conform
with the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"
which stipulates: "Everyone has the right to leave any
country, including his own, and to return to his coun
try."
Soviet 'violation'
"Our family's case was used to substantiate allega
tions that the Soviets violated this agreement," Slepak
said. "My release was an attempt to combat those allega
tions."
Since his release, Slepak has fought for his family's
freedom.
During Vice-president Walter Mondale's recent trip to
Jerusalem, Slepak metwith him todiscuss U.S. action on
Soviet treatment of the Jews.
"Mr. Mondale told me that the U.S. is aware of the
plight of Soviet Jews," Slepak said, adding that Mondale
assured him that the U.S. government would continue
"doing the best it could to alleviate the problem."
But Slepak said he wishes the United States could do
more for his family now.
"My mother writes that she and my father are living in
a wooden, barrack-like cabin," Slepak said. "There is no
running water; no bathroom.
"My brother is in hiding somewhere in Russia," he
continued, saying that he hopes to "make connections"
in the United States that can help his family.
Slepak said he wants the United States to "take a
stronger stand" on Soviet Jews' rights.
"I know that compromise works sometimes," he said.
"But I don't think it will work this time."
Slepak said he plans to continue speaking at colleges
in the area in an attempt to gain support for Soviet Jews.

more for his family now.
"My mother writes that she and my father are living in
a wooden, barrack-like cabin," Slepak said. "There is no
running water; no bathroom.
"My brother is in hiding somewhere in Russia," he
continued, saying that he hopes to "make connections"
in the United States that can help his family.
Slepak said he wants the United States to "take a
stronger stand" on Soviet Jews' rights.
"I know that compromise works sometimes," he said.
"But I don't think it will work this time."
Slepak said he plans to continue speaking at colleges
in the area in an attempt to gain support for Soviet Jews.
This past June — eight months after Sonja Slepak was
granted an exit visa and allowed to leave Moscow for
Israel — the Soviet government sentenced Slepak's pa
rents to five years exile in Siberia.
The official charge against Vladimir and Marija Slepak
was "malicious hooliganism." Their crime — displaying
from their Moscow apartment a banner, on which was
scrawled, "Let us join our son in Israel."
"The trouble began in 1969 when my family first
applied for a permit to migrate to Israel," said Sonja
Slepak in a Daily interview, following yesterday's solidar
ity rally for Soviet Jewish prisoners.
"Our parents were refused," he added. The reason
given by the Soviets was "security considerations," ac
cording to Slepak.
But, this did not dampen the Slepak's determination
to emigrate to Israel. According to a 1977 report, by the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry, the Slepaks
applied for — and were refused — exit visas 12 times.
Rights fight
"My father became a leader in the Jewish rights
movement in Russia," Slepak said. "Our entire family
was involved and because of this we were harassed by
the K.G.B. (Soviet secret police)."
According to Slepak, the K.G.B. placed his family
under constant surveillance.
"Our house was searched several times," he said.
"Any literature about the West, judaica (materials relat
ing to Judaism) and human rights was confiscated.
"Whenever we protested publicly we were arrested,"
Slepak added.
The Soviet government also used other means of
harassment. According to Slepak, his father lost his job
as chief of the Department of Research in Television,
because of pressure from the K.G.B.
"Many applicants for exit visas are dismissed from
their employment," Slepak said. "In other instances,
applicants are demoted and their salaries decreased."
Now at UC-Santa Cruz
Despite Soviet attempts to silence them, the Slepaks
persisted in protesting. In October 1977, Sonja Slepak

was granted an exit visa and allowed to go to Israel, then
the United States, where he now attends UC-Santa Cruz.
"The Soviets let me out in an attempt to influence the
Belgrade conference," Slepak said.
According to a June 1977 New York Times article, the
Belgrade conference was to assess whether the Helsinki
accord had been observed. Signers of the pact — the
United States, Canada and 33 European countries in
cluding Russia — pledged to respect human rights.
Principle VII of the Helsinki agreement contains a
commitment by the participating countries to conform
with the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"
which stipulates: "Everyone has the right to leave any
country, including his own, and to return to his coun
try."
Soviet 'violation'
"Our family's case was used to substantiate allega
tions that the Soviets violated this agreement," Slepak
said. "My release was an attempt to combat those allega
tions."
Since his release, Slepak has fought for his family's
freedom.
During Vice-president Walter Mondale's recent trip to
Jerusalem, Slepak metwith him todiscuss U.S. action on
Soviet treatment of the Jews.
"Mr. Mondale told me that the U.S. is aware of the
plight of Soviet Jews," Slepak said, adding that Mondale
assured him that the U.S. government would continue
"doing the best it could to alleviate the problem."
But Slepak said he wishes the United States could do
more for his family now.
"My mother writes that she and my father are living in
a wooden, barrack-like cabin," Slepak said. "There is no
running water; no bathroom.
"My brother is in hiding somewhere in Russia," he
continued, saying that he hopes to "make connections"
