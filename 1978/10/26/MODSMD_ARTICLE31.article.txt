World reacts to Carter plan
London — President Jimmy Carter's new anti
inflation program was dismissed on world money
markets yesterday as too little, too late, and the
dollar plunged to new lows in heavy selling. But
some experts said the plan may do some good in
the long-term.
Foreign exchange dealers said Carter's plan to
limit wages and prices voluntarily was woefully
inadequate to stem the dollar's 18-month decline.
"We had not expected much," commented one
Swiss dealer, "but we had not expected so little."
Cold bullion soared to record prices in typical
reaction to the dollar's troubles.
At European Common Market headquarters in
Brussels, an economist, who declined to be
named, said: "All measures to stabilize the
economy have a positive effect, and this program
will have a mid-term and long-term internal be
nefit for the U.S. economy."
Professor George Akelof of the London School
of Economics, an American money expert, com
mented: "I don't see why the dollar's so low — it's
a mystery to economists. The United States is now
one of the cheapest countries in the world."
Despite their views, the dollar sank to record
lows against the German mark, the Dutch guilder,
Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Danish and
Norwegian kroners.
Israeli Cabinet approves pact
Jerusalem — Israel gave qualified approval to a
draft peace agreement with Egypt yesterday, but
instructed its delegation to the peace conference
in Washington to seek important revisions in the
final text.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman will leave for Washington
today, the government announced. The U.S. State
Department said the talks probably would resume

today or tomorrow and that Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance planned to meet with the Egyptian
delegation yesterday afternoon.
Egypt has said italso wants to amend the 10-page
draft treaty and informed sources estimated the
negotiations may continue for several more
weeks.
"The cabinet approves the amendments prop
osed by the prime minister to the draft's peace
treaty, has given appropriate guidelines to the de
legation and has authorized its members to con
tinue the negotiations," Begin said in a brief pre
pared statement.
Vance, Gromyko schedule talks
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, unwil
ling to give up hopes of completing a strategic
arms limitation treaty by the end of the year, is
planning to send Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to
Geneva next month for talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
It will be the ninth round of negotiations bet
ween Vance and Gromyko in less than two years in
the thus-far faltering effort to complete the SALT
pact limiting the deployment of new long-range
bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles
until 1985.
The Kremlin negotiations "cleared away" a
number of problems, but several key issues re
main unresolved, say U.S. officials, speaking pri
vately. These include the kinds of limitations that
would be imposed on the computer-guided U.S.
cruise missiles and procedures for restricting
other new missiles and bombers on each side.
Navy bombs miss target
Twentynine Palms, Calif. — Attack jets from an
aircraft carrier missed their practice targets and
dropped 32 live bombs near a rural community,
officials say.

By yesterday, three days after the 500-pound
bombs were dropped and exploded upon impact,
the Navy had not publicly explained how it hap
pened. There were no injuries.
"We saw those planes coming closer and closer
<?n their bombing runs," said James Wheeler, a
volunteer fireman in Wonder Valley. "We started
getting out of there."
The target was a practice bombing range on the
Marine Corps base at Twentynine Palms, a major
training area for both the Navy and Marines in the
Mojave Desert about 120 miles east of Los Angeles.
There was no public explanation from the Navy.
Rear Adm. Robert Kirksey, commander of Carrier
Division 3, ordered an investigation.
Committee gives Brooke report
Washington — The Senate Ethics Committee de
clared yesterday that it has found no evidence that
Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) was personally re
sponsible for withholding or altering documents
sought by the panel in its inquiry into his finances.
The committee's statement, after IVa days of
hearings, followed demands from Brooke that the
panel pass judgment on charges that his lawyers
tried to delay the investigation as Richard Werth
eimer, former special counsel to the committee,
has alleged.
"The committee has no evidence linking Sen.
Brooke personally with delaying the production of
documents, failing to turn over documents, or
altering documents requested by the committee,"
said Lynne Murphy, the committee's press
spokeswoman.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local fog and low
clouds night and morning. Little temperature
change. Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in
the mid 60s to mid 70s.

dropped 32 live bombs near a rural community,
officials say.

By yesterday, three days after the 500-pound
bombs were dropped and exploded upon impact,
the Navy had not publicly explained how it hap
pened. There were no injuries.
"We saw those planes coming closer and closer
<?n their bombing runs," said James Wheeler, a
volunteer fireman in Wonder Valley. "We started
getting out of there."
The target was a practice bombing range on the
Marine Corps base at Twentynine Palms, a major
training area for both the Navy and Marines in the
Mojave Desert about 120 miles east of Los Angeles.
There was no public explanation from the Navy.
Rear Adm. Robert Kirksey, commander of Carrier
Division 3, ordered an investigation.
Committee gives Brooke report
Washington — The Senate Ethics Committee de
clared yesterday that it has found no evidence that
Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) was personally re
sponsible for withholding or altering documents
sought by the panel in its inquiry into his finances.
The committee's statement, after IVa days of
hearings, followed demands from Brooke that the
panel pass judgment on charges that his lawyers
tried to delay the investigation as Richard Werth
eimer, former special counsel to the committee,
has alleged.
"The committee has no evidence linking Sen.
Brooke personally with delaying the production of
documents, failing to turn over documents, or
altering documents requested by the committee,"
said Lynne Murphy, the committee's press
spokeswoman.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local fog and low
clouds night and morning. Little temperature
change. Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in
the mid 60s to mid 70s.
World reacts to Carter plan
London — President Jimmy Carter's new anti
inflation program was dismissed on world money
markets yesterday as too little, too late, and the
dollar plunged to new lows in heavy selling. But
some experts said the plan may do some good in
the long-term.
Foreign exchange dealers said Carter's plan to
limit wages and prices voluntarily was woefully
inadequate to stem the dollar's 18-month decline.
"We had not expected much," commented one
Swiss dealer, "but we had not expected so little."
Cold bullion soared to record prices in typical
reaction to the dollar's troubles.
At European Common Market headquarters in
Brussels, an economist, who declined to be
named, said: "All measures to stabilize the
economy have a positive effect, and this program
will have a mid-term and long-term internal be
nefit for the U.S. economy."
Professor George Akelof of the London School
of Economics, an American money expert, com
mented: "I don't see why the dollar's so low — it's
a mystery to economists. The United States is now
one of the cheapest countries in the world."
Despite their views, the dollar sank to record
lows against the German mark, the Dutch guilder,
Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Danish and
Norwegian kroners.
Israeli Cabinet approves pact
Jerusalem — Israel gave qualified approval to a
draft peace agreement with Egypt yesterday, but
instructed its delegation to the peace conference
in Washington to seek important revisions in the
final text.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman will leave for Washington
today, the government announced. The U.S. State
Department said the talks probably would resume

today or tomorrow and that Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance planned to meet with the Egyptian
delegation yesterday afternoon.
Egypt has said italso wants to amend the 10-page
draft treaty and informed sources estimated the
negotiations may continue for several more
weeks.
"The cabinet approves the amendments prop
osed by the prime minister to the draft's peace
treaty, has given appropriate guidelines to the de
legation and has authorized its members to con
tinue the negotiations," Begin said in a brief pre
pared statement.
Vance, Gromyko schedule talks
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, unwil
ling to give up hopes of completing a strategic
arms limitation treaty by the end of the year, is
planning to send Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to
Geneva next month for talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
It will be the ninth round of negotiations bet
ween Vance and Gromyko in less than two years in
the thus-far faltering effort to complete the SALT
pact limiting the deployment of new long-range
bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles
until 1985.
The Kremlin negotiations "cleared away" a
number of problems, but several key issues re
main unresolved, say U.S. officials, speaking pri
vately. These include the kinds of limitations that
would be imposed on the computer-guided U.S.
cruise missiles and procedures for restricting
other new missiles and bombers on each side.
