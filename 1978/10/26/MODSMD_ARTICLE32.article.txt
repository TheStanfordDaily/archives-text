# Student survey gathers views of the Farm

### RICH CHIN 
Finding out what students here
think of life on the Farm is the goal of
a survey conducted by the dean of
student affairs' office.
So far, 80 of the 200 juniors and
graduate students chosen for the
study, have been interviewed, ac
cording to Carole Price, assistant
dean of students.
The dean's office has enough ap
pointments scheduled to meet its
100-student target, she added.
Price, the study coordinator, said
the-45-to-60-minute interviews were
"very open-ended discussions, try
ing to find out what it's like to be a
student here."
The survey will help the student
affairs staff learn "what's going on in
people's minds, what stands out as
being important, what are the high
points and what are the low points,"
Price said.
Retreat planned
She said results of the survey
would be discussed at the annual
student affairs office retreat Nov. 2
and 3 in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
About 30 staff members, headed by
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
and student service representatives
will discuss University life, Price said.
They will also examine results of
last year's senior survey conducted
by the Academic Information
Center, and last year's freshman
Study of Undergraduate Experience at
Stanford (SUES).
Participants for the student affairs
office study were chosen randomly
from directory lists, Price said.

Juniors were selected, because
freshmen and seniors already had
been questioned in the 1977-78 sur
veys, she explained.
"We're targeting other groups and
we chose juniors because they will
have had two years of Stanford ex
perience, but not four in a kind of
middle area," she said.
Graduate students, taken from Es
condido Village were included to
provide "another perspective" of
on-campus student living.
SUES profile
Bill Washburn, a graduate student
who coordinated SUES for the dean
of undergradutate studies, said he
found that students saw their peers
as "a resource, a tremendous plus
for being at Stanford and something
that they're far and away very happy
about."
Approximately 300 freshmen were
interviewed last year. Washburn said
this group would be questioned each
year until it graduates.
The senior survey is an annual poll
of the graduating class' views on un
dergraduate studies and future
academic plans.
