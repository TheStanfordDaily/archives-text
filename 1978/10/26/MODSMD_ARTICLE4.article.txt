# Brown, Younger duel verbally
## Candidates exchange jabs 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown said yesterday
that Attorney General Evelle Younger's comments on
taxes remind him of communist philosopher Karl Marx.
Younger, meanwhile, dramatized his support of a
constitutional limit on state and local government
spending, by signing an initiative petition by Proposition
13 co-author Paul Gann.
Younger said Brown's voluntary spending limits on
state government were "phony" and that the only way
spending will be curbed is to put limits in the state
constitution.
Brown spoke in Sacramento on a closed-circuit
hookup with Pacific Telephone employees in 10 cities
statewide. Gann and the Republican nominee appeared
together at a Sacramento news conference to kick off
Gann's latest voter initiative campaign.
Brown said that, when Younger charged during their
debates that the state work force has increased since
Brown's post-Proposition 13 hiring freeze, "he was tel
ling a deliberate falsehood."
'Net reduction'
There has been "a net reduction of state employees
and records show the number of people in my office
went down," Brown said.
But, he added, "if I say it too loudly, it appears I'm
calling him a liar. And I don't want to do that. I want to
say he's not telling the truth."
After making that distinction, Brown then offhandedly
linked the attorney general wih Marx.
Brown recounted Younger's campaign promise to cut
state income taxes by an additional $2.5 billion and said:
"We've had the biggest tax cut in history. When is the
day of reckoning? People are saying more and more tax
cuts. Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, or whoever the heck it was
said government would wither away. When I hear this
fellow Younger, I get the impression government is
going to wither away and there won't be any taxes. That

just isn't true."
Younger said he was "very pleased" to be among the
first signers of Cann's petitions aimed at qualifying a
constitutional amendment for the 1980 ballot that would
tie increases in state and local spending to inflation and
population increases.
Cann's praise
Cann praised Younger for joining his campaign, but
he did not specifically endorse the attorney general,
explaining his group is nonpartisan.
On Tuesday Younger also attacked Health and Wel
fare Secretary Mario Obledo, the top-ranking
Mexican-American in state government, at a breakfast
with a doctors' group in Sherman Oaks.
Obledo is "one of the worst appointments any gover
nor has ever made," Younger said. He added that an
honest incompetent, as he labeled Obledo, can hurt the
state more than a smart thief.
"Morally, I hate to see a dishonest person as head of a
department," Younger said. "But economically you
would be better off if you had a smart thief as head of
one of these departments than if you had an inexperi
enced and completely ineffective honest amateur."
'Smart thief'
He said a smart thief would be "careful as to how
much he stole. He might steal only $1 million or $2
million a year. But an incompetent administrator could
cost up to 3 percent of the budget a year."
Obledo has been under attack for scandals in health
and welfare programs under his agency, such as mental
hospitals, prepaid health plans and a state-monitored
drug abuse program that law enforcement officials say
was controlled by a prison gang.
Cray Davis, the governor's campaign manager said, "I
think Younger is beginning to lose his marbles. I can't
believe a candidate for governor would sanction crimi
nality in his appointments."

Gann's latest voter initiative campaign.
Brown said that, when Younger charged during their
debates that the state work force has increased since
Brown's post-Proposition 13 hiring freeze, "he was tel
ling a deliberate falsehood."
'Net reduction'
There has been "a net reduction of state employees
and records show the number of people in my office
went down," Brown said.
But, he added, "if I say it too loudly, it appears I'm
calling him a liar. And I don't want to do that. I want to
say he's not telling the truth."
After making that distinction, Brown then offhandedly
linked the attorney general wih Marx.
Brown recounted Younger's campaign promise to cut
state income taxes by an additional $2.5 billion and said:
"We've had the biggest tax cut in history. When is the
day of reckoning? People are saying more and more tax
cuts. Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, or whoever the heck it was
said government would wither away. When I hear this
fellow Younger, I get the impression government is
going to wither away and there won't be any taxes. That

just isn't true."
Younger said he was "very pleased" to be among the
first signers of Cann's petitions aimed at qualifying a
constitutional amendment for the 1980 ballot that would
tie increases in state and local spending to inflation and
population increases.
Cann's praise
Cann praised Younger for joining his campaign, but
he did not specifically endorse the attorney general,
explaining his group is nonpartisan.
On Tuesday Younger also attacked Health and Wel
fare Secretary Mario Obledo, the top-ranking
Mexican-American in state government, at a breakfast
with a doctors' group in Sherman Oaks.
Obledo is "one of the worst appointments any gover
nor has ever made," Younger said. He added that an
honest incompetent, as he labeled Obledo, can hurt the
state more than a smart thief.
"Morally, I hate to see a dishonest person as head of a
department," Younger said. "But economically you
would be better off if you had a smart thief as head of
one of these departments than if you had an inexperi
enced and completely ineffective honest amateur."
'Smart thief'
He said a smart thief would be "careful as to how
much he stole. He might steal only $1 million or $2
million a year. But an incompetent administrator could
cost up to 3 percent of the budget a year."
Obledo has been under attack for scandals in health
and welfare programs under his agency, such as mental
hospitals, prepaid health plans and a state-monitored
drug abuse program that law enforcement officials say
was controlled by a prison gang.
Cray Davis, the governor's campaign manager said, "I
think Younger is beginning to lose his marbles. I can't
believe a candidate for governor would sanction crimi
nality in his appointments."
Sacramento (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown said yesterday
that Attorney General Evelle Younger's comments on
taxes remind him of communist philosopher Karl Marx.
Younger, meanwhile, dramatized his support of a
constitutional limit on state and local government
spending, by signing an initiative petition by Proposition
13 co-author Paul Gann.
Younger said Brown's voluntary spending limits on
state government were "phony" and that the only way
spending will be curbed is to put limits in the state
constitution.
Brown spoke in Sacramento on a closed-circuit
hookup with Pacific Telephone employees in 10 cities
statewide. Gann and the Republican nominee appeared
together at a Sacramento news conference to kick off
Gann's latest voter initiative campaign.
