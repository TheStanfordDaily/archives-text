# Several proposals already sent to committees
## Nine bills await senate action 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Incoming ASSU senators have
already written nine bills in prep
aration for tonight's meeting, the
first of the year. However, little of
this legislation is likely to reach
the floor.
Outgoing chairperson Fred
Crethel has sent seven of the
proposals to committees to avoid
needless debate.
The senate chairperson has the
power to send bills to commit
tees, Crethel said. He will serve as
acting chair until the senate elects
his successor tonight.
The new chair will organize the
three senate standing commit
tees: rules, finance and academic
affairs. Grethel said they could
meet almost immediately and
start work on the new bills.
Attendance bills
Senators Brett Kingstone
and Gary Fremerman have sub
mitted a bill that would encourage
better attendance. The senate has
had difficulty gaining quorums in
the past. Under the Kingstone-
Fremerman bill, a senator would
be allowed to miss three meet
ings. After missing a fourth, he
would be removed from office
and replaced by the highest
ranking alternate.
Kingstone has also proposed a
resolution calling for work on

stringent attendance require
ments.
Since only 10 students ran for
the 10 graduate senate seats in the
election two weeks, no alternates
were chosen. Noguidelines in the
ASSU Constitution or bylaws
deal with this problem. So
graduate Sen. Geoff Baskir has
proposed that he and his col
leagues choose one graduate stu
dent each to serve as their alter
nates, until next fall's elections.
This would provide the required
alternates without forcing an elec
tion.
Project group
Baskir proposed another mo
tion to form an ad-hoc committee,
composed of senators and in
terested students, to investigate
establishment of a new ASSU pro
ject group which would sponsor
mixers to help different parts of
the University community meet
socially. A project group is a
student-run service like the Sun
day Flicks or Special Events.
Senators Ted Gardenswartz and
Ron Johnson have provided the
senate with its first reform prop
osal of the year. The
Gardenswartz-Johnson bill would
assign each senator to a group of
University residences and hold
him responsible for attending
house meetings and eating occa
sional meals in that area.

The bill's authors hope that this
plan will "promote the effective
communication network neces
sary to make the senate both re
sponsive and representative."
New committee
Grethel has proposed a motion,
which he decided not to send to
committee, allowing the new
chairperson to establish a Senate
Steering Committee that would
assist the chair in executing the
administrative duties of the office.
The chairperson is responsible for
compiling and organizing much
of the written material that comes
before the senate, including
agendas and committee reports.
Baskir also has proposed a mo
tion which would create a fourth
standing committee, concerned
with non-academic affairs. This
body would review "items dealing
with the quality of student life and
the interaction of the University
with the surrounding commun
ity."
Another Baskir motion would
make the senate's deputy chair
person the automatic chair of the
ASSU Nominations Committee.
This move would give the senate a
closer link to the student group,
which appoints students to Uni
versity committees.
Baskir's final motion would re
move all ASSU funds from the
University investment pool.

ASSU Constitution or bylaws
deal with this problem. So
graduate Sen. Geoff Baskir has
proposed that he and his col
leagues choose one graduate stu
dent each to serve as their alter
nates, until next fall's elections.
This would provide the required
alternates without forcing an elec
tion.
Project group
Baskir proposed another mo
tion to form an ad-hoc committee,
composed of senators and in
terested students, to investigate
establishment of a new ASSU pro
ject group which would sponsor
mixers to help different parts of
the University community meet
socially. A project group is a
student-run service like the Sun
day Flicks or Special Events.
Senators Ted Gardenswartz and
Ron Johnson have provided the
senate with its first reform prop
osal of the year. The
Gardenswartz-Johnson bill would
assign each senator to a group of
University residences and hold
him responsible for attending
house meetings and eating occa
sional meals in that area.

The bill's authors hope that this
plan will "promote the effective
communication network neces
sary to make the senate both re
sponsive and representative."
New committee
Grethel has proposed a motion,
which he decided not to send to
committee, allowing the new
chairperson to establish a Senate
Steering Committee that would
assist the chair in executing the
administrative duties of the office.
The chairperson is responsible for
compiling and organizing much
of the written material that comes
before the senate, including
agendas and committee reports.
Baskir also has proposed a mo
tion which would create a fourth
standing committee, concerned
with non-academic affairs. This
body would review "items dealing
with the quality of student life and
the interaction of the University
with the surrounding commun
ity."
Another Baskir motion would
make the senate's deputy chair
person the automatic chair of the
ASSU Nominations Committee.
This move would give the senate a
closer link to the student group,
which appoints students to Uni
versity committees.
Baskir's final motion would re
move all ASSU funds from the
University investment pool.
Incoming ASSU senators have
already written nine bills in prep
aration for tonight's meeting, the
first of the year. However, little of
this legislation is likely to reach
the floor.
Outgoing chairperson Fred
Crethel has sent seven of the
proposals to committees to avoid
needless debate.
The senate chairperson has the
power to send bills to commit
tees, Crethel said. He will serve as
acting chair until the senate elects
his successor tonight.
The new chair will organize the
three senate standing commit
tees: rules, finance and academic
affairs. Grethel said they could
meet almost immediately and
start work on the new bills.
Attendance bills
Senators Brett Kingstone
and Gary Fremerman have sub
mitted a bill that would encourage
better attendance. The senate has
had difficulty gaining quorums in
the past. Under the Kingstone-
Fremerman bill, a senator would
be allowed to miss three meet
ings. After missing a fourth, he
would be removed from office
and replaced by the highest
ranking alternate.
Kingstone has also proposed a
resolution calling for work on

stringent attendance require
ments.
Since only 10 students ran for
the 10 graduate senate seats in the
election two weeks, no alternates
were chosen. Noguidelines in the
ASSU Constitution or bylaws
deal with this problem. So
