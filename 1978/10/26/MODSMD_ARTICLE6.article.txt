# Thanksgiving Day may lack turkeys
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Some
Americans may have to settle
for cacklers rather than
gobblers with their dressing
and cranberry sauce this
Thanksgiving. The Agriculture
Department says there aren't
enough turkeys to go around.
But cooks hunting for plenti
ful fixings shouldn't have any
problem finding a broiler chic
ken. And for those really de
termined to make the most of
what is in good supply, there is
the option of stuffing the bird
with onions and peanuts.
The USDA predicted yester
day that November shoppers
will find a "light" turkey sup
ply, a measure the department
translates as "less than
adequate, not enough for
normal needs."
Although officials weren't
predicting figures for supply
and demand, they said this is
the first time in at least a de

cade the supply has been de
signated "light" this time of
year.
USDA reported 361.7 million
pounds of frozen turkeys held
in cold-storage warehouses as
of Sept. 30.
That's a lot of potential
drumsticks, wings and breasts
for American tables, but the
total is down 12 percent from
1976.
"Even if it goes up slightly,
that doesn't mean we'll have
enough," said Stanley
Prochaska, informaton direc
tor of the department's Ag
ricultural Marketing Service.
Supermarkets may not actu
ally run out of turkeys, he said.
Instead, it's likely the low sup
ply and traditional high de
mand will send prices rising,
convincing shoppers to play
down tradition this Thanksgiv
ing.
