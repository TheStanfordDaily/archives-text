# Anti-gay initiative on ballot
## Proposition 6 stirs debate 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — The de
cade that carried homosexual
ity from whispers and scholarly
studies to loud national debate
reaches a milestone next
month with the first statewide
vote on rights of homosexuals.
On Nov. 7, when Califor
nians decide Proposition 6,
they will vote on a question
stated against homosexuals'
rights. The proposal would re
quire school boards to fire or
refuse to hire any teacher
judged unfit because of public
homosexuality or advocacy of
homosexuality.
Critics say the proposed law
would clamp a tight lid on
teachers' rights to speak out in
support of civil rights for
homosexuals, in or out of the
classroom. Advocates say such
rights are outweighed by those
of parents.
Latest public opinion polls
indicate the vote will be close.
The initiative is one of the most
emotion-charged on the bal
lot.
Coming nearly 10 years after
a New York City bar riot sig
naled the beginning of the gay
rights movement, Proposition
6 will be the first statewide test
of public sentiment on a right
rebuffed by voters in several
cities recently — that of
homosexuals to jobs.
On one side is a conservative
state senator, John Briggs, who
appeared with singer Anita
Bryant in Miami, Fla., in 1977 to
lead the first widely publicized
repeal of a gay rights ordi
nance. He returned with an
evangelical vow of all-out war
against homosexuals.
On the other side, arguing
that current law can deal with
improper classroom behavior
and that Briggs is trampling
human rights, stand most
major elected state officials, a
dozen school boards, leading
clergy and a staunch conserva
tive, former Gov. Ronald
Reagan.
Briggs concedes he came up
with the homosexual issue to
boost his candidacy for the Re
publican gubernatorial nomi
nation. He trailed badly in the
polls and dropped out before
the June primary.
However, he garnered
500,000 signatures on petitions
to qualify the initiative on the
November ballot.
"It's the hottest social issue
since Reconstruction," he
said.

Harvey Milk, a member of
the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors and self-professed
homosexual, has debated
Briggs on the proposition and
charges the senator is just
using the issue.
"At first I thought he was sin
cere. But having met him three
different times in debates, I
realize he is lying in his teeth
on the issues and he knows it,"
Milk said. "He comes from the
same school of politics that Hi

tler did — playing on people's
fears."
Opponents of the initiative
have taken out newspaper and
broadcast ads and in many
areas provided speakers to var
ious groups. Milk notes that in
selected areas like San Fran
cisco, "where gays feel more
secure," there is a door-to
door effort.
The campaign against the in
itiative, spearheaded by diver
gent groups of homosexual

rights activists, has recruited
broad support.
The California Federation of
Teachers, other unions, most
major newspapers and civil
rights leaders argue that it is
unnecessary, was proposed to
pamper Briggs' ego, and is a
threat to constitutional rights.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who main
tains a low-key support for
homosexual rights, has gener
ally shied away from the issue,
saying only, "I think the laws
we have on the books are
adequate."
When specifically asked for
his view on Proposition 6,
Brown said, "As far as people's
private lives — religious, sex
ual, political — I believe that

the right to privacy is a very im
portant protection, and I think
that it ought to be very vigor
ously enforced at all levels."
Briggs complains his cam
paign has trouble' raising
money, and there is no official
headquarters for the "Yes on
6" people. "No on 6" groups
have several headquarters and
have staged voter registration
drives.
There are some 15 loose co
alitions against Proposition 6 in
the state but opposition ap
pears heaviest in San Fran
cisco, where the homosexual
population is estimated at 15
percent. Briggs has spent a lot
of time in the area, usually at
debates with Milk.

major elected state officials, a
dozen school boards, leading
clergy and a staunch conserva

Reagan.
Briggs concedes he came up
with the homosexual issue to
boost his candidacy for the Re
publican gubernatorial nomi
nation. He trailed badly in the
polls and dropped out before
the June primary.
However, he garnered
500,000 signatures on petitions
to qualify the initiative on the
November ballot.
"It's the hottest social issue
since Reconstruction," he
said.

Harvey Milk, a member of
the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors and self-professed
homosexual, has debated
Briggs on the proposition and
charges the senator is just
using the issue.
"At first I thought he was sin
cere. But having met him three
different times in debates, I
realize he is lying in his teeth
on the issues and he knows it,"
Milk said. "He comes from the
same school of politics that Hi

tler did — playing on people's
fears."
Opponents of the initiative
have taken out newspaper and
broadcast ads and in many
areas provided speakers to var
ious groups. Milk notes that in
selected areas like San Fran
cisco, "where gays feel more
secure," there is a door-to
door effort.
The campaign against the in
itiative, spearheaded by diver
gent groups of homosexual

rights activists, has recruited
broad support.
The California Federation of
Teachers, other unions, most
major newspapers and civil
rights leaders argue that it is
unnecessary, was proposed to
pamper Briggs' ego, and is a
threat to constitutional rights.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who main
tains a low-key support for
homosexual rights, has gener
ally shied away from the issue,
saying only, "I think the laws
we have on the books are
adequate."
When specifically asked for
his view on Proposition 6,
Brown said, "As far as people's
private lives — religious, sex
ual, political — I believe that

the right to privacy is a very im
portant protection, and I think
that it ought to be very vigor
ously enforced at all levels."
Briggs complains his cam
paign has trouble' raising
money, and there is no official
headquarters for the "Yes on
6" people. "No on 6" groups
have several headquarters and
have staged voter registration
drives.
There are some 15 loose co
alitions against Proposition 6 in
the state but opposition ap

population is estimated at 15

San Francisco (AP) — The de
cade that carried homosexual
ity from whispers and scholarly
studies to loud national debate
reaches a milestone next
month with the first statewide
vote on rights of homosexuals.
On Nov. 7, when Califor
nians decide Proposition 6,
they will vote on a question
stated against homosexuals'
rights. The proposal would re
quire school boards to fire or
refuse to hire any teacher
judged unfit because of public
homosexuality or advocacy of
homosexuality.
Critics say the proposed law
would clamp a tight lid on
teachers' rights to speak out in
support of civil rights for
homosexuals, in or out of the
classroom. Advocates say such
rights are outweighed by those
of parents.
Latest public opinion polls
indicate the vote will be close.
The initiative is one of the most
emotion-charged on the bal
lot.
Coming nearly 10 years after
a New York City bar riot sig
naled the beginning of the gay
rights movement, Proposition
6 will be the first statewide test
of public sentiment on a right
rebuffed by voters in several
cities recently — that of
homosexuals to jobs.
On one side is a conservative
state senator, John Briggs, who
appeared with singer Anita
Bryant in Miami, Fla., in 1977 to
lead the first widely publicized
repeal of a gay rights ordi
nance. He returned with an
evangelical vow of all-out war
against homosexuals.
On the other side, arguing
that current law can deal with
improper classroom behavior
and that Briggs is trampling
human rights, stand most
major elected state officials, a
dozen school boards, leading
clergy and a staunch conserva
