A biologist was bored and lonely So he decided
to make a clone of himself And he succeeded so
he thought The clone was exactly like him ex
cept that he had an enormous propensity for
using profane language The clone, see,
swore at every opportunity, and the biologist
found it annoying and embarrassing One day he
takes his clone to a football game and during i
halftime he pushes him over the wall at the top of
the bleachers The clone falls to the ground many
feet below, creating a mess upon impact Then
the police arrest the biologist
On what charge 9 he demands
For making an obscene clone fall
