# Professor's wife falls to her death in the Himalayas
## 
### 
Vera Watson of Stanford and Ali
son Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz of
Leeds, England were killed more
than a week ago on an American
women's mountaineering expedi
tion in Nepal, it was reported yester
day.
Watson, 46, was the wife of Com
puter Science Prof. John McCarthy,
who is also director of the Low Over
head Time Sharing Project (LOTS).
McCarthy learned of his wife's
death when he received a phone call
at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday from Christy
Tews, the expedition's base camp
manager.
The two women died when they
fell 2000 feet while attempting to
reach the 26,545-foot summit of An
napurna in Nepal.
Expedition spokesman Colin Mil
ler said the deaths occurred Oct. 17,
two days after two other members of
the expedition reached the summit.
However, it took several days for
news of the tragedy to reach civiliza
tion from the expedition's base camp
at 13,000 feet.
The Associated Press reported this
morning that a weeping member of
the women's team said it was not
possible to retrive the bodies of two
climbers.
No one heard or saw the women
fall. But when they failed to answer
radio calls of their support party, two
Sherpa guides were sent up after
them on Oct. 18, Tews said in a
copyright interview with the San lose
Mercury News in today's editions.
The Sherpas found the bodies near
Camp 4 at the 24,500-foot level of the
mountain. Tews said that the Sherpas
and climber Piro Kramar set out on
Oct. 19 to retrieve the bodies but
Kramar's frostbitten finger forced
them to abandon the effort.
Tews, whose eyes were brimming
with tears, told a reporter for the
Mercury News, "We did as much re
connaissance as we could. To re
cover the bodies would have put the
lives of other climbers in jeopardy."
First woman
Watson was the first woman to
solo climb Aconcagua in Argentina,
the highest peak in the Western
Hemisphere. But "she never ex
pected to be invited to join an exped
ition to a major Himalyan peak," said
McCarthy.
Watson "looked upon this climb as
a big opportunity she never expected
to have," McCarthy said. "She was
very determined to do it. I encour
aged her," he added.
Watson moved to LosGatos in 1974
and worked as a computer prog
rammer with IBM Research
Laboratories in San )ose. She met
McCarthy three years ago, and they
were married in 1976.
According to McCarthy, they often
climbed together in the Sierras and
in Mexico, "but not on very difficult
peaks."
McCarthy said he had received
about 10 letters from his wife during
the expedition, and they were "en
thusiastic" in tone.

McCarthy.
Watson "looked upon this climb as
a big opportunity she never expected
to have," McCarthy said. "She was
very determined to do it. I encour
aged her," he added.
Watson moved to LosGatos in 1974
and worked as a computer prog
rammer with IBM Research
Laboratories in San )ose. She met
McCarthy three years ago, and they
were married in 1976.
According to McCarthy, they often
climbed together in the Sierras and
in Mexico, "but not on very difficult
peaks."
McCarthy said he had received
about 10 letters from his wife during
the expedition, and they were "en
thusiastic" in tone.
Vera Watson of Stanford and Ali
son Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz of
Leeds, England were killed more
than a week ago on an American
women's mountaineering expedi
tion in Nepal, it was reported yester
day.
Watson, 46, was the wife of Com
puter Science Prof. John McCarthy,
who is also director of the Low Over
head Time Sharing Project (LOTS).
McCarthy learned of his wife's
death when he received a phone call
at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday from Christy
Tews, the expedition's base camp
manager.
The two women died when they
fell 2000 feet while attempting to
reach the 26,545-foot summit of An
napurna in Nepal.
Expedition spokesman Colin Mil
ler said the deaths occurred Oct. 17,
two days after two other members of
the expedition reached the summit.
However, it took several days for
news of the tragedy to reach civiliza
tion from the expedition's base camp
at 13,000 feet.
The Associated Press reported this
morning that a weeping member of
the women's team said it was not
possible to retrive the bodies of two
climbers.
No one heard or saw the women
fall. But when they failed to answer
radio calls of their support party, two
Sherpa guides were sent up after
them on Oct. 18, Tews said in a
copyright interview with the San lose
Mercury News in today's editions.
The Sherpas found the bodies near
Camp 4 at the 24,500-foot level of the
mountain. Tews said that the Sherpas
and climber Piro Kramar set out on
Oct. 19 to retrieve the bodies but
Kramar's frostbitten finger forced
them to abandon the effort.
Tews, whose eyes were brimming
with tears, told a reporter for the
Mercury News, "We did as much re
connaissance as we could. To re
cover the bodies would have put the
lives of other climbers in jeopardy."
First woman
Watson was the first woman to
solo climb Aconcagua in Argentina,
the highest peak in the Western
Hemisphere. But "she never ex
pected to be invited to join an exped
ition to a major Himalyan peak," said
McCarthy.
Watson "looked upon this climb as
a big opportunity she never expected
to have," McCarthy said. "She was
very determined to do it. I encour
aged her," he added.
