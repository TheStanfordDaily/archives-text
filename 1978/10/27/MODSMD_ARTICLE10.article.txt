## Editorial Prop. 6 – Unwarranted fear 
### 
Proposition 6, the anti-gay teacher
initiative, is the one proposal that
deserves the soundest of defeats in
the California general election.
Proposition 6, if passed, would re
quire local school boards to hold
hearings in cases where a teacher or
other staff member in the public
schools was formally charged with
being a homosexual or in some way
advocating a homosexual lifestyle. If
that person were found to be "unfit
for service" because of being a
homosexual or advocating a
homosexual lifestyle, the law would
require the person to be fired.
The vote on Proposition 6 is not a
referendum on gay rights. It is not a
vote for or against the American fam
ily. It is a decision on whether 1300
words will be added to the state edu
cation code, in order explicitly to en
able local school boards to fire
teachers and other certificated
school employees who engage in
homosexual "activity" or "conduct."
The "conduct" part of the prop
osal is sweeping and vague, and no
one has the slightest idea how nar
rowly or broadly the language would
be interpreted by school boards and
by the courts.
Would a teacher, straight or gay,
lose his or her job for expressing an
opinion, outside the classroom,
favoring tolerance for homosexuals?
Maybe. And such uncertainty opens
the way for witch hunts.
Archbishop John Quinn of San
Francisco said Proposition 6 "is peri
ously vague, and ... it could easily
open the way for abuses and could
jeopardize the responsible freedom
of teachers, both heterosexual and
homosexual."
It is clearly possible a student
could retaliate against a heterosexual
teacher by using Proposition 6 and
calling that person gay. Although
that teacher might well be vindi
cated, the process of going through a
hearing process would take a toll on
any good teacher.
President Richard Lyman has also
come out against this initiative. "The
proposition seeks to exploit unwar
ranted fears among the people of
California," he said. "If passed, it
could open the way tor smear cam
paigns against particular individuals
that would poison the atmosphere of
schools in a way most damaging to
our children's education."
This initiative is obviously so un
needed, it calls for its own death.
State Senator John Briggs, Proposi

tion 6's sponsor, is an opportunistic
politician who had hoped to ride the
coattails of Proposition 6 and its
counterpart, Proposition 7's exten
sion of the death penalty, to the Re
publican nomination for governor
last June. Thank goodness, his cam
paign flopped.
Briggs rationalizes the risk of gay
teachers by implying that we have an
urgent problem — that teachers are
promoting homosexuality in their
classrooms. He is completely wrong.
A teacher who advocated gay lifes
tyles to his or her students would be
in plenty of trouble.
State School Superintendent Wil
son Riles said, "We have enough
laws on the books to protect the
youngsters."
Dr. Francisco Jiminez, chairman of
the state commission on licensing of
teachers, said that by simply using
existing laws, the commission "al
ready can deal effectively with public
homosexual activity as defined by
the initiative.
"I've been on the commission
since 1976 and no cases have come
before us where a teacher may have
advocated homosexualtiy in the class
room as the preferred lifestyle," he
said.
And if you're worried that there is
only liberal opposition to the initia
tive, you are mistaken. Take a close
look at the words of Ronald Reagan,
Evelle Younger and Howard Jarvis, all
of whom are opposing this measure.
"There are already enough laws to
take care of any problems," former
Governor Reagan said two weeks
ago in a statement to Briggs.
The concern over child molesta
tion of students by gay teachers has
no factual basis, either. Authoritative
studies indicate that at the minimum,
90 percent of all reported child sex
ual abuse incidents are caused by
heterosexual males.
"Homosexual teachers are just as
highly principled as heterosexual
teachers," Dr. Benjamin Spock, a
noted child psychologist, has
stated. "They are human beings.
There is no justification for denying
them their rights as citizens just be
cause some people fear."
An initiative that appeals to the
fear of the voters when fear is not
warranted has no place in our soci
ety, especially when it attacks the
personal freedom and privacy of
other individuals, as Proposition 6 so
recklessly does. It definitely de
serves a No vote in 11 days.
