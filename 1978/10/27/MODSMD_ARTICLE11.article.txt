was submitted as an open letter
to lane Fonda.)
I was present at both the rally
arid seminar which you con
ducted on Oct. Jb at the Uni
versity. I was very impressed
with the vigor and initiative you
have demonstrated in making
us aware of the injustices and
discrepancies endemic to our
present social and economic
system. And I admire vou for
making such good use of your
talent of attracting and reach
ing people through words ac
tions and ideas.
I am. however, concerned
about your apparent awk
wardness in dealing with broad
economic issues. In mv opin
ion. the most complex and
confusing dilemmas of mod
ern society exist there. At the
seminar when I asked vou how
you proposed to reach your
ideal of full employment in the
U.S., some of the vitality and
confidence that you displayed
in vour other student inter
changes seemed missing. And
your response that we should
reduce military expenditures
was poorly conceived.
It is a disgraceful truth but
war and the growth of military
power ha> over the history of
the U.S. and the world, contri
buted more to economic
growth and equality than any
other single factor. When a
country mobilizes for a war,
the resources of the rich are
immediately injected into the
economy because the rich are
ultimately interested in pre
serving their private property
from foreign control or de
struction. It is at this time that
the cooperation and support
of the poor is most needed bv
the rich. Under the guise of
patriotism and nationalism, the

massive labor force of the poor
is bribed into contributing to
the war effort by higher wages
and more political power.
Naturally, the rich intend after
the war to return to a
peacetime economy where the
demand tor labor is so low that
the poor can be stripped of
their economic gains. Luckily,
in the United States at least, the
rich have been only partially
successful in doing this.
The scenario I have set up
above doesn't begin to reflect
the real complexities involved,
nor is it applicable to all coun
tries in all times. But I think it is
lust as dangerous to accept
your idea that reducing the
military will cut unemplovment
as it would be to accept my idea
that increasing the military will
cut unemplovment. There are
no pat answers.
lust as we have learned in re
cent years that we can't change
our physical environment
without negative ecological ef
fects, we must learn that we
can't change our economic en
vironment without certain
negative economic repercus
sions. It is a well-documented
fact that decreases in un
employment are usually ac
companied by increases in in
flation which I consider to be
more insidiously harmful to
the poor than unemployment.
But beyond any personal
viewpoints that you or I may
have is the importance of really
learning how our economy is
influenced by changes in social
priorities — however needed
those changes may be.

People forget
mascot's purpose
People who have written let
ters of warning about the

alumni's campaign to restore
the Indian as our mascot have
forgotten all of the things a
school's mascot stands for. The
mascot is not merely a rep
resentation of our fierceness
on the football field, but also of
the proud character and high
endeavors of the University as
a whole.
If we take back the Indian as
our mascot, it will be because
the Indian is a proud race with
a noble heritage. Stanford
would become the champion
of the Indian race, reminding
people that being an Indian is
something to value.
On the other hand, if we re
fuse to restore the Indian as
our mascot, it becomes our
dutv to make Notre Dame and
othpr institutions change their
mascots as well. Irish, Trojans
and Spartans, not to mention
Cowboys, also become unac
ceptable as mascots since each
of these races has a negative
stereotype at least as derogat
ory as that of the Indian. Are we
so much wiser than the groups
that are still proud of these
mascots?
We should remember that a
university's mascot is meant as
something to emulate. It is
chosen for its good qualities, I
think this is what those who
originally decided on the In
dian as our mascot intended.
We should not set ourselves up
self-righteously as defenders
of the oppressed by saying that
we no longer want the Indian
as our mascot. If we do not
want the Indian, then we must
implicitly share the feeling that
the Indian is unworthy and in
ferior, that he is indeed a
drinken, conniving, can
nibalistic savage.''

People forget
mascot's purpose
People who have written let
ters of warning about the

alumni's campaign to restore
the Indian as our mascot have
forgotten all of the things a
school's mascot stands for. The
mascot is not merely a rep
resentation of our fierceness
on the football field, but also of
the proud character and high
endeavors of the University as
a whole.
If we take back the Indian as
our mascot, it will be because
the Indian is a proud race with
a noble heritage. Stanford
would become the champion
of the Indian race, reminding
people that being an Indian is
something to value.
On the other hand, if we re
fuse to restore the Indian as
our mascot, it becomes our
dutv to make Notre Dame and
othpr institutions change their
mascots as well. Irish, Trojans
and Spartans, not to mention
Cowboys, also become unac
ceptable as mascots since each
of these races has a negative
stereotype at least as derogat
ory as that of the Indian. Are we
so much wiser than the groups
that are still proud of these
mascots?
We should remember that a
university's mascot is meant as
something to emulate. It is
chosen for its good qualities, I
think this is what those who
originally decided on the In
dian as our mascot intended.
We should not set ourselves up
self-righteously as defenders
of the oppressed by saying that
we no longer want the Indian
as our mascot. If we do not
want the Indian, then we must
implicitly share the feeling that
the Indian is unworthy and in
ferior, that he is indeed a
drinken, conniving, can
nibalistic savage.''

I was present at both the rally
arid seminar which you con
ducted on Oct. Jb at the Uni
versity. I was very impressed
with the vigor and initiative you
have demonstrated in making
us aware of the injustices and
discrepancies endemic to our
present social and economic
system. And I admire vou for
making such good use of your
talent of attracting and reach
ing people through words ac
tions and ideas.
I am. however, concerned
about your apparent awk
wardness in dealing with broad
economic issues. In mv opin
ion. the most complex and
confusing dilemmas of mod
ern society exist there. At the
seminar when I asked vou how
you proposed to reach your
ideal of full employment in the
U.S., some of the vitality and
confidence that you displayed
in vour other student inter
changes seemed missing. And
your response that we should
reduce military expenditures
was poorly conceived.
It is a disgraceful truth but
war and the growth of military
power ha> over the history of
the U.S. and the world, contri
buted more to economic
growth and equality than any
other single factor. When a
country mobilizes for a war,
the resources of the rich are
immediately injected into the
economy because the rich are
ultimately interested in pre
serving their private property
from foreign control or de
struction. It is at this time that
the cooperation and support
of the poor is most needed bv
the rich. Under the guise of
patriotism and nationalism, the

massive labor force of the poor
is bribed into contributing to
the war effort by higher wages
and more political power.
Naturally, the rich intend after
the war to return to a
peacetime economy where the
demand tor labor is so low that
the poor can be stripped of
their economic gains. Luckily,
in the United States at least, the
rich have been only partially
successful in doing this.
The scenario I have set up
above doesn't begin to reflect
the real complexities involved,
nor is it applicable to all coun
tries in all times. But I think it is
lust as dangerous to accept
your idea that reducing the
military will cut unemplovment
as it would be to accept my idea
that increasing the military will
cut unemplovment. There are
no pat answers.
lust as we have learned in re
cent years that we can't change
our physical environment
without negative ecological ef
fects, we must learn that we
can't change our economic en
vironment without certain
negative economic repercus
sions. It is a well-documented
fact that decreases in un
employment are usually ac
companied by increases in in
