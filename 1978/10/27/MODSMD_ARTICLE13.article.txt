## Prop. 5: good for everyone 
### 
It's time to blow away some of the haze
surrounding Proposition 5, the Clean In
door Air Act of 1978. This initiative, which
intends to provide smoke-free air for
non-smokers, is significant enough to at
tract millions of dollars from eastern states
in order to bring about its defeat. What's
all the hot air about?
Proposition 5 requires indoor areas of
public buildings and businesses to have
non-smoking areas. In some places, such
as inside theaters, smoking would be to
tally banned, while in other places, such as
bars, smoking would be unrestricted. En
forcement is planned through a possible
fine of $50 for each smoking infraction.
Enactment will require installation of NO
SMOKING signs and some rearrangement
and partitioning for the non-smoking
areas. Part of the inspiration for the bill is
from the example of similar municipal
laws, particularly in Berkeley and San
Diego.
The rationale for the proposal is the find
ing that cigarette smoke is damaging to
anyone who inhales it, whether smoking
or not. Indeed, proponents claim that the
smoke inhaled from the burning end of
the cigarette is more harmful than that in
haled by the smoker. The result of Propos
ition 5, according to its backers, will be
better general health, causing a reduction
in medical and associated expenses. An
added benefit will be less loss due to fires
and burns caused by cigarettes.
Opponents of the measure hold that
enactment will cost close to $300 million
for sign installation, partitioning and en
forcement. This contention leads to a con
clusion that Prop. 5 will make California

less attractive to business and will create
unemployment. Opponents claim Prop. 5
would create a " 'big brother government'
making personal decisionsand controlling
private property." Further, they say, Prop.
5 is poorly written.
The anti-5 forces are probably closest to
the mark on the last assertion. For exam
ple, rock concerts are not subject to smok
ing restrictions. This is perhaps a grudging
nod to the reality that little short of the
death penalty would stop smoking at rock
concerts. But what is a rock concert?
Could one smoke while watching the Os
mond Brothers or Herbie Hancock? Prop
osition 5 is too vague here.
The money argument against 5 is some
what weaker. The unbiased California
Legislative Analyst predicts only minimal
costs for enactment. Further, after the ini
tial costs are incurred, benefits should
outweigh expenses.
Cries of "big brother government" are
to be expected, one might suppose. You
play on that butt of all frustrations, the
government, and you tend to pick up sup
port. But if Prop. 5 smacks of big brother,
then so do regulations concerning sanitary
food processing and sufficient fire precau
tions. Public health has long been consi
dered a proper field for government regu
lation. Prop. 5 does not regulate private
smoking behavior or restrict tobacco
purchases. Analogies with alcohol prohib
ition are hence ludicrous.
A word is in order about the nature of
the campaign being waged. The anti-5 or
ganization, Californians for Common
Sense, is outspending proponents at a
roughly ten-to-oneclip. Millions have been
contributed to the anti-5 campaign by to

bacco companies whose concern for
Californians presumably extends beyond
what sort of government restrictions they
impose upon themselves.
The contributions from tobacco con
cerns suggest a strong belief on their part
that Proposition 5 would hurt tobacco
sales. This heavy infusion of out of state
money re-emphasizes that California deci
sions have ramifications far beyond the
California borders, and that Californians
are having a progressively smaller part to
play in their own state elections.
The anti-5 campaign has been vitriolic
and sarcastic to a level surprising even for
a California election. Radio spots on
"progressive rock" stations feature 20-ish
male voices displaying incredulity over the
idiocy of Proposition 5. Listeners should
be advised that defeat of the proposition
will not expand legally sanctioned smok
ing privileges.
When all the irrelevant issues are fil
tered out, Proposition 5 seems to be a sub
stitute for common courtesy. Butcornmon
courtesy in this regard is lacking, as any
one who has endured the cigar smoker at
the next table will attest. Although flawed,
Proposition 5 is subject to legislative re
viewwhich hopefully will iron out difficul
ties.
If enacted, Prop. 5 would help
smoked-out employees who are too shy or
intimidated to say anything. Smokers
wouldn't have to worry about smoking.
On the whole, Proposition 5 is a good
thing for almost everyone, except maybe
the tobacco industry. It should be ap
proved.

money re-emphasizes that California deci
sions have ramifications far beyond the
California borders, and that Californians
are having a progressively smaller part to
play in their own state elections.
The anti-5 campaign has been vitriolic
and sarcastic to a level surprising even for
a California election. Radio spots on
"progressive rock" stations feature 20-ish
male voices displaying incredulity over the
idiocy of Proposition 5. Listeners should
be advised that defeat of the proposition
will not expand legally sanctioned smok
ing privileges.
When all the irrelevant issues are fil
tered out, Proposition 5 seems to be a sub
stitute for common courtesy. Butcornmon
courtesy in this regard is lacking, as any
one who has endured the cigar smoker at
the next table will attest. Although flawed,
Proposition 5 is subject to legislative re
viewwhich hopefully will iron out difficul
ties.
If enacted, Prop. 5 would help
smoked-out employees who are too shy or
intimidated to say anything. Smokers
wouldn't have to worry about smoking.
On the whole, Proposition 5 is a good
thing for almost everyone, except maybe
the tobacco industry. It should be ap
proved.

It's time to blow away some of the haze
surrounding Proposition 5, the Clean In
door Air Act of 1978. This initiative, which
intends to provide smoke-free air for
non-smokers, is significant enough to at
tract millions of dollars from eastern states
in order to bring about its defeat. What's
all the hot air about?
Proposition 5 requires indoor areas of
public buildings and businesses to have
non-smoking areas. In some places, such
as inside theaters, smoking would be to
tally banned, while in other places, such as
bars, smoking would be unrestricted. En
forcement is planned through a possible
fine of $50 for each smoking infraction.
Enactment will require installation of NO
SMOKING signs and some rearrangement
and partitioning for the non-smoking
areas. Part of the inspiration for the bill is
from the example of similar municipal
laws, particularly in Berkeley and San
Diego.
The rationale for the proposal is the find
ing that cigarette smoke is damaging to
anyone who inhales it, whether smoking
or not. Indeed, proponents claim that the
smoke inhaled from the burning end of
the cigarette is more harmful than that in
haled by the smoker. The result of Propos
ition 5, according to its backers, will be
better general health, causing a reduction
in medical and associated expenses. An
added benefit will be less loss due to fires
and burns caused by cigarettes.
Opponents of the measure hold that
enactment will cost close to $300 million
for sign installation, partitioning and en
forcement. This contention leads to a con
clusion that Prop. 5 will make California

less attractive to business and will create
unemployment. Opponents claim Prop. 5
would create a " 'big brother government'
making personal decisionsand controlling
private property." Further, they say, Prop.
5 is poorly written.
The anti-5 forces are probably closest to
the mark on the last assertion. For exam
ple, rock concerts are not subject to smok
ing restrictions. This is perhaps a grudging
nod to the reality that little short of the
death penalty would stop smoking at rock
concerts. But what is a rock concert?
Could one smoke while watching the Os
mond Brothers or Herbie Hancock? Prop
osition 5 is too vague here.
The money argument against 5 is some
what weaker. The unbiased California
Legislative Analyst predicts only minimal
costs for enactment. Further, after the ini
tial costs are incurred, benefits should
outweigh expenses.
Cries of "big brother government" are
to be expected, one might suppose. You
play on that butt of all frustrations, the
government, and you tend to pick up sup
port. But if Prop. 5 smacks of big brother,
then so do regulations concerning sanitary
food processing and sufficient fire precau
tions. Public health has long been consi
dered a proper field for government regu
lation. Prop. 5 does not regulate private
smoking behavior or restrict tobacco
purchases. Analogies with alcohol prohib
ition are hence ludicrous.
A word is in order about the nature of
the campaign being waged. The anti-5 or
ganization, Californians for Common
Sense, is outspending proponents at a
roughly ten-to-oneclip. Millions have been
contributed to the anti-5 campaign by to

bacco companies whose concern for
Californians presumably extends beyond
what sort of government restrictions they
impose upon themselves.
The contributions from tobacco con
cerns suggest a strong belief on their part
that Proposition 5 would hurt tobacco
sales. This heavy infusion of out of state
money re-emphasizes that California deci
sions have ramifications far beyond the
California borders, and that Californians
are having a progressively smaller part to
