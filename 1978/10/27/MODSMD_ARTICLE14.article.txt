## Measure H response to greed 
### 
I agree with Doug Bandovv
that renters deserve increased
tax credits. However, his con
fidence in the politicians in
Sacramento is naive at best if
he believes early action on the
matter is forthcoming. We all
witnessed the fiasco at the end
of the current session of the
state legislature when they
tried to pass some kind of re
nters rebate act. The real estate
lobby stepped in and leaned
on many seemingly sensible
legislators killing the Bates bill
which would have made Mea
sure H unnecessary.
What concerns me and what
concerns the numerous
people who have contacted me
after reading Bandow s article
in Thursday's Daily is his lack of
understanding of Measure H

Measure H was written as a reaction to
landlords raising rents following the pas
sage of Prop. 13. . . .

and why it is essential as a tem
porary measure to counteract
the greed of many local and ab
sentee landlords in Palo Alto.
Measure H was written as a
reaction to landlords raising
rents following passage of
Proposition 13 in anticipation
of the possibility of having to
return some of their windfall
profits to their tenants. If Ban
dow thinks that landlords have
been lowering their rents or
not raising them as fast as they
would have had Proposition 13
not passed, he has not visited
the Palo Alto Tenants Union,
Rental Mediation Task Force,
or the Rent Relief office. Calls
are coming in on a regular basis
showing that in general, land
lords have done practically no
thing to pass through their
windfall tax savings to their
tenants. With a 1.1 percent va
cancy rate for rental units in
Palo Alto, landlords are free to

do as they please with rentals
unless the citizens force them
to give tax equity to renters.
Bandow mentions that Mea
sure H will put "government in
the position of determining
when rents are reasonable."
He must not have read the or
dinance. Measure H calls for
no new bureaucracy. All con
tact is between landlord and
tenant. A base rent is estab
lished at the rent being paid on
June 6, 1978 to insure against
landlords raising rents then re
bating tax savings at a net pro
fit. Landloards can raise rents
unlike rent control laws,
merely by documenting
reasons for raises. This enables
landlords to use their savings
to improve their property
without fear that they will not

be compensated for their ef
forts.
The arguement that cries will
go up for extending Measure H
tor another year are scare tac
tics. Palo Alto's city council has
always had the authority to
enact landlord-tenant legisla
tion. Measure H will not
change that power. Is Bandow
afraid that the citizens of Palo
Alto, of which renters consti
tute a minority, will find Mea
sure H so appealing that they
will want to continue it? That is
not the intention of the propo
nents of the measure. We want
tenants of Palo Alto to have
some breathing room so when
the state finally passes a renters
tax cred't, renters will have
been covered in the interim.
The article mentions im
mobilizing the housing mar
ket. While the reasons seem
unclear in the article, such a

situation could only occur over
a long term. Measure H is on ly
for one year so neither a
change in the housing market
or complete deterioration of
Palo Alto's wooden houses
(another worry) will occur dur
ing that time.
Lest Bandow worry about
apartments being converted to
other uses, there is a strong
condominium conversion law
in Palo Alto. The law prevents
any conversion of apartments
unless there is more than a 3
percent vacancy rate and two
thirds of the tenants of the
building agree to the change.
Such conditionsare unlikely to
occur in Palo Alto in the
foreseeable future regardless

of what new legislation is pas
ses city wide.
Finally, the author asks why
landlords have beensingled out
for passing through their sav
ings? Maybe it is a case of chic
kens coming home to roost.
Landlords were among the
strongest proponents of Prop
osition 13. Howard larvis was
the head of one of California's
largest apartment-owners as
sociations. Proposition 13 is
what many landlords wanted.
They should not complain
when their tenants demand a
small piece of the huge savings
they will receive.

What concerns me and what
concerns the numerous
people who have contacted me
after reading Bandow s article
in Thursday's Daily is his lack of
understanding of Measure H

Measure H was written as a reaction to
landlords raising rents following the pas
sage of Prop. 13. . . .

and why it is essential as a tem
porary measure to counteract
the greed of many local and ab
sentee landlords in Palo Alto.
Measure H was written as a
reaction to landlords raising
rents following passage of
Proposition 13 in anticipation
of the possibility of having to
return some of their windfall
profits to their tenants. If Ban
dow thinks that landlords have
been lowering their rents or
not raising them as fast as they
would have had Proposition 13
not passed, he has not visited
the Palo Alto Tenants Union,
Rental Mediation Task Force,
or the Rent Relief office. Calls
are coming in on a regular basis
showing that in general, land
lords have done practically no
thing to pass through their
windfall tax savings to their
tenants. With a 1.1 percent va
cancy rate for rental units in
Palo Alto, landlords are free to

do as they please with rentals
unless the citizens force them
to give tax equity to renters.
Bandow mentions that Mea
sure H will put "government in
the position of determining
when rents are reasonable."
He must not have read the or
dinance. Measure H calls for
no new bureaucracy. All con
tact is between landlord and
tenant. A base rent is estab
lished at the rent being paid on
June 6, 1978 to insure against
landlords raising rents then re
bating tax savings at a net pro
fit. Landloards can raise rents
unlike rent control laws,
merely by documenting
reasons for raises. This enables
landlords to use their savings
to improve their property
without fear that they will not

be compensated for their ef
forts.
The arguement that cries will
go up for extending Measure H
tor another year are scare tac
tics. Palo Alto's city council has
always had the authority to
enact landlord-tenant legisla
tion. Measure H will not
change that power. Is Bandow
afraid that the citizens of Palo
Alto, of which renters consti
tute a minority, will find Mea
sure H so appealing that they
will want to continue it? That is
not the intention of the propo
nents of the measure. We want
tenants of Palo Alto to have
some breathing room so when
the state finally passes a renters
tax cred't, renters will have
been covered in the interim.
The article mentions im
mobilizing the housing mar
ket. While the reasons seem
unclear in the article, such a

situation could only occur over
a long term. Measure H is on ly
for one year so neither a
change in the housing market
or complete deterioration of
Palo Alto's wooden houses
(another worry) will occur dur
ing that time.
Lest Bandow worry about
apartments being converted to
other uses, there is a strong
condominium conversion law
in Palo Alto. The law prevents
any conversion of apartments
unless there is more than a 3
percent vacancy rate and two
thirds of the tenants of the
building agree to the change.
Such conditionsare unlikely to
occur in Palo Alto in the
foreseeable future regardless

of what new legislation is pas
ses city wide.
Finally, the author asks why
landlords have beensingled out
for passing through their sav
ings? Maybe it is a case of chic
kens coming home to roost.
Landlords were among the
strongest proponents of Prop
osition 13. Howard larvis was
the head of one of California's
largest apartment-owners as
sociations. Proposition 13 is
what many landlords wanted.
They should not complain
when their tenants demand a
small piece of the huge savings
they will receive.
(Don Surath is chairperson of
Palo Alto Citizens for Rent Re
lief.)
I agree with Doug Bandovv
that renters deserve increased
tax credits. However, his con
fidence in the politicians in
Sacramento is naive at best if
he believes early action on the
matter is forthcoming. We all
witnessed the fiasco at the end
of the current session of the
state legislature when they
tried to pass some kind of re
nters rebate act. The real estate
lobby stepped in and leaned
on many seemingly sensible
legislators killing the Bates bill
which would have made Mea
sure H unnecessary.
