# Stanford strategy: eat the Beavers, save the Trees
## Cardinals hope to devour inept Oregon State offense; Beaver defense, however, presents a gnawing problem 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Three days after Oregon
State last beat the Stanford
football team, Richard Nixon
edged Hubert Humphrey in
the 1968 presidential election.
Both Nixon and the Beavers
have had problems since.
The Beavers come into to
morrow's 1:30 p.m. contest at
Stanford Stadium following a
38-7 loss to USC. Stanford,
after a pair of last-minute de
feats, rebounded last Saturday
to thrash Washington State,
43-27.
"Saturday was one of our
better football games," Ore
gon State coach Craig Fertig
said. "Theyweresimplyaphys
ically superior team.
"The week before USC
coughed the ball up seven
times (in a 20-7 loss to Arizona
State)," Fertig said. "This week
they fumbled once for a 9-yard
gain."
Fertig, a former assistant
coach at Southern Cal, said
USC "looked like the old Tro
jans." And Oregon State? Well,
the Beavers have looked like
the old Beavers.
Oregon State is 1-4-1 with a
victory over Minnesota and a
tie to Tennessee. Their
anonymous offense has been
harder to find than a short
winded politician — averaging
a non-existent 207.3 yards a
game.
Inept is a sugar-coated word
to describe the Beaver running
game. With two freshmen
starting at the running backs,
the Beavers have averaged an

emaciated 1.8 yards a carry this
season.
"USC manhandled our
line," Fertig said. "But we have
a young offensive line — four
freshmen started against
USC."
The impotent Beaver offense
— OSU has scored only 50
points in six games — fares
slightly better when it takes to
the air. Junior QB Steve Smith
has completed 50 of 102 passes
for 636 yards and four
touchdowns. His favorite
target is diminutive Steve
Coury, a 5-foot-8 split end who
has caught 16 passes for a 16.5
yard average and two TDs.
The OSU defense, while not
statistically impressive — it has
yielded 348.7 yards a game — is
well-conceived.
"They have one of the best
coached defensive teams in
the country," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "It's the reason
why Fertig has held his job
amid all the duress'up there.
It's just short on talent."
Tackle Tom Schillinger and
end Jerry Wilkinson anchorthe
Beaver defensive front. Schil
linger leads the Beavers in tack
les with 62 stops while the
6-foot-9, 261-pound Wilkinson
is third in tackles with 47.
Right corner Tim Smith, an
excellent return man, is the
standout in the Beaver secon
dary with four interceptions
and 29 tackles.
The Oregon State defense
could be in for the much
traveled "long afternoon" to
morrow. The Stanford offense,
ranked third in the nation with

459.7 yards a game, devastated
Washington State with 607
yards last week and must cer
tainly entertain thoughts of br
inging the show back for a
home engagement.
Steve Dils, the top passer in
the NCAA, threw for a Pac-10
record 430 yards while com
pleting 32 of 51 passes for five
touchdowns and a conspicu
ous no interceptions. Dils was
selected both the Pac-10 and
Sports Illustrated offensive
player of the week.
Running back Darrin Nelson
became Stanford's career rush
ing leader against the Cougars,
having gained 1794 yards in a
season and a half, picking up 95
yards on 15 carries against
WSU. Fullback Phil Francis
caught eight passes in Pullman
to raise his conference-leading
reception total to 46.
Nelson and wide receiver
Ken Margerum have grabbed
38 and 33 passes respectively to
rank right behind Francis in the
Pac-10 numbers game.
A superficial glance at the
game and it appears a cakewalk
for the Cardinals.
"We can't take people lightly
or we'll end up like we did
against Tulane (when the Cards
pulled a 17-14 triumph out of
the fire in the final period),"
said Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans. Evans had 16
tackles last year against the
Beavers when Stanford, ahead
only 10-7 going into the last
quarter, won 26-7.
Evans said Stanford can't be
looking ahead to next week's

game with USC. "It doesn't
matter what we do aginst 'SC if
we don't beat Oregon State
this weekend."
The Cards, 4-3 overall, are
1-2 in the Pac-10 after the WSU
game.
"The win last week didn't
satisfy us," Walsh said. "Each
game we play, we'll be smart
ing from those two losses. We
won't be letting down."
If Oregon State has an ad
vantage over Stanford, it's in its
punting game. Fertig said the
one redeeming factor fo the
OSU-USC game was "we out
punted them." Beaver John
Misko has punted 55 times fora
40.1 average.
"Our kicking game is no
longer suspect," Walsh said,
"the conclusions are in." The
conclusion is to hold one's
breath and say the rosary. After
having two punts blocked
against Washington, the Cards
waited til midway through the
fourth quarter against WSU to
punt.
The result was the same.
Washington State blocked Ken
Naber's kick, recovered it at
the 5 and scored on the next
play.
"We are already spending 20
percent of our practice time on
the kicking game," Walsh said.
"We have two fine punters, if
we can get the ball past the line
of scrimmage."
With the L.A. Times running
headlines such as "InCame of
Inches, Cards Lose by a Foot,"
Stanford hopes simply to win
by an arm.

1-2 in the Pac-10 after the WSU
game.
"The win last week didn't
satisfy us," Walsh said. "Each
game we play, we'll be smart
ing from those two losses. We
won't be letting down."
If Oregon State has an ad
vantage over Stanford, it's in its
punting game. Fertig said the
one redeeming factor fo the
OSU-USC game was "we out
punted them." Beaver John
Misko has punted 55 times fora
40.1 average.
"Our kicking game is no
longer suspect," Walsh said,
"the conclusions are in." The
conclusion is to hold one's
breath and say the rosary. After
having two punts blocked
against Washington, the Cards
waited til midway through the
fourth quarter against WSU to
punt.
The result was the same.
Washington State blocked Ken
Naber's kick, recovered it at
the 5 and scored on the next
play.
"We are already spending 20
percent of our practice time on
the kicking game," Walsh said.
"We have two fine punters, if
we can get the ball past the line
of scrimmage."
With the L.A. Times running
headlines such as "InCame of
Inches, Cards Lose by a Foot,"
Stanford hopes simply to win
by an arm.

Stanford's Robhy Chapman (47), Gordy Ceresino (95) and Chuck Evans swarm over Oklahoma's Kenny
King in the Cards 35-29 opening season loss to the Sooners. The Card defense, ranked seventh in the
conference, hopes to have an easier time tomorrow when the Oregon State Beavers meet the Cards at 1:30
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. The Beavers are the conference's lowliest offensive unit.
Three days after Oregon
State last beat the Stanford
football team, Richard Nixon
edged Hubert Humphrey in
the 1968 presidential election.
Both Nixon and the Beavers
have had problems since.
The Beavers come into to
morrow's 1:30 p.m. contest at
Stanford Stadium following a
38-7 loss to USC. Stanford,
after a pair of last-minute de
feats, rebounded last Saturday
to thrash Washington State,
43-27.
"Saturday was one of our
better football games," Ore
gon State coach Craig Fertig
said. "Theyweresimplyaphys
ically superior team.
"The week before USC
coughed the ball up seven
times (in a 20-7 loss to Arizona
State)," Fertig said. "This week
they fumbled once for a 9-yard
gain."
Fertig, a former assistant
coach at Southern Cal, said
USC "looked like the old Tro
jans." And Oregon State? Well,
the Beavers have looked like
the old Beavers.
Oregon State is 1-4-1 with a
victory over Minnesota and a
tie to Tennessee. Their
anonymous offense has been
harder to find than a short
winded politician — averaging
a non-existent 207.3 yards a
game.
Inept is a sugar-coated word
to describe the Beaver running
game. With two freshmen
starting at the running backs,
the Beavers have averaged an

emaciated 1.8 yards a carry this
season.
"USC manhandled our
line," Fertig said. "But we have
a young offensive line — four
freshmen started against
USC."
The impotent Beaver offense
— OSU has scored only 50
points in six games — fares
slightly better when it takes to
the air. Junior QB Steve Smith
has completed 50 of 102 passes
for 636 yards and four
touchdowns. His favorite
target is diminutive Steve
Coury, a 5-foot-8 split end who
has caught 16 passes for a 16.5
yard average and two TDs.
The OSU defense, while not
statistically impressive — it has
yielded 348.7 yards a game — is
well-conceived.
"They have one of the best
coached defensive teams in
the country," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "It's the reason
why Fertig has held his job
amid all the duress'up there.
It's just short on talent."
Tackle Tom Schillinger and
end Jerry Wilkinson anchorthe
Beaver defensive front. Schil
linger leads the Beavers in tack
les with 62 stops while the
6-foot-9, 261-pound Wilkinson
is third in tackles with 47.
Right corner Tim Smith, an
excellent return man, is the
standout in the Beaver secon
dary with four interceptions
and 29 tackles.
The Oregon State defense
could be in for the much
traveled "long afternoon" to
morrow. The Stanford offense,
ranked third in the nation with

459.7 yards a game, devastated
Washington State with 607
yards last week and must cer
tainly entertain thoughts of br
inging the show back for a
home engagement.
Steve Dils, the top passer in
the NCAA, threw for a Pac-10
record 430 yards while com
pleting 32 of 51 passes for five
touchdowns and a conspicu
ous no interceptions. Dils was
selected both the Pac-10 and
Sports Illustrated offensive
player of the week.
Running back Darrin Nelson
became Stanford's career rush
ing leader against the Cougars,
having gained 1794 yards in a
season and a half, picking up 95
yards on 15 carries against
WSU. Fullback Phil Francis
caught eight passes in Pullman
to raise his conference-leading
reception total to 46.
Nelson and wide receiver
Ken Margerum have grabbed
38 and 33 passes respectively to
rank right behind Francis in the
Pac-10 numbers game.
A superficial glance at the
game and it appears a cakewalk
for the Cardinals.
"We can't take people lightly
or we'll end up like we did
against Tulane (when the Cards
pulled a 17-14 triumph out of
the fire in the final period),"
said Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans. Evans had 16
tackles last year against the
Beavers when Stanford, ahead
only 10-7 going into the last
quarter, won 26-7.
Evans said Stanford can't be
looking ahead to next week's

game with USC. "It doesn't
matter what we do aginst 'SC if
we don't beat Oregon State
this weekend."
The Cards, 4-3 overall, are

Washington State with 607
yards last week and must cer
tainly entertain thoughts of br
inging the show back for a
home engagement.
Steve Dils, the top passer in
the NCAA, threw for a Pac-10
record 430 yards while com
pleting 32 of 51 passes for five
touchdowns and a conspicu
ous no interceptions. Dils was
selected both the Pac-10 and
Sports Illustrated offensive
player of the week.
Running back Darrin Nelson
became Stanford's career rush
ing leader against the Cougars,
having gained 1794 yards in a
season and a half, picking up 95
yards on 15 carries against
WSU. Fullback Phil Francis
caught eight passes in Pullman
to raise his conference-leading
reception total to 46.
Nelson and wide receiver
Ken Margerum have grabbed
38 and 33 passes respectively to
rank right behind Francis in the
Pac-10 numbers game.
A superficial glance at the
game and it appears a cakewalk
for the Cardinals.
"We can't take people lightly
or we'll end up like we did
against Tulane (when the Cards
pulled a 17-14 triumph out of
the fire in the final period),"
said Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans. Evans had 16
tackles last year against the
Beavers when Stanford, ahead
only 10-7 going into the last
quarter, won 26-7.
Evans said Stanford can't be
looking ahead to next week's

game with USC. "It doesn't
matter what we do aginst 'SC if
we don't beat Oregon State
this weekend."
The Cards, 4-3 overall, are
1-2 in the Pac-10 after the WSU
game.
"The win last week didn't
satisfy us," Walsh said. "Each
game we play, we'll be smart
ing from those two losses. We
won't be letting down."
If Oregon State has an ad
vantage over Stanford, it's in its
punting game. Fertig said the
one redeeming factor fo the
OSU-USC game was "we out
punted them." Beaver John
Misko has punted 55 times fora
40.1 average.
"Our kicking game is no
longer suspect," Walsh said,
"the conclusions are in." The
conclusion is to hold one's
breath and say the rosary. After
having two punts blocked
against Washington, the Cards
waited til midway through the
fourth quarter against WSU to
punt.
The result was the same.
Washington State blocked Ken
Naber's kick, recovered it at
the 5 and scored on the next
play.
"We are already spending 20
percent of our practice time on
the kicking game," Walsh said.
"We have two fine punters, if
we can get the ball past the line
of scrimmage."
With the L.A. Times running
headlines such as "InCame of
Inches, Cards Lose by a Foot,"
Stanford hopes simply to win
by an arm.

Stanford's Robhy Chapman (47), Gordy Ceresino (95) and Chuck Evans swarm over Oklahoma's Kenny
King in the Cards 35-29 opening season loss to the Sooners. The Card defense, ranked seventh in the
conference, hopes to have an easier time tomorrow when the Oregon State Beavers meet the Cards at 1:30
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. The Beavers are the conference's lowliest offensive unit.
Three days after Oregon
State last beat the Stanford
football team, Richard Nixon
edged Hubert Humphrey in
the 1968 presidential election.
Both Nixon and the Beavers
have had problems since.
The Beavers come into to
morrow's 1:30 p.m. contest at
Stanford Stadium following a
38-7 loss to USC. Stanford,
after a pair of last-minute de
feats, rebounded last Saturday
to thrash Washington State,
43-27.
"Saturday was one of our
better football games," Ore
gon State coach Craig Fertig
said. "Theyweresimplyaphys
ically superior team.
"The week before USC
coughed the ball up seven
times (in a 20-7 loss to Arizona
State)," Fertig said. "This week
they fumbled once for a 9-yard
gain."
Fertig, a former assistant
coach at Southern Cal, said
USC "looked like the old Tro
jans." And Oregon State? Well,
the Beavers have looked like
the old Beavers.
Oregon State is 1-4-1 with a
victory over Minnesota and a
tie to Tennessee. Their
anonymous offense has been
harder to find than a short
winded politician — averaging
a non-existent 207.3 yards a
game.
Inept is a sugar-coated word
to describe the Beaver running
game. With two freshmen
starting at the running backs,
the Beavers have averaged an

emaciated 1.8 yards a carry this
season.
"USC manhandled our
line," Fertig said. "But we have
a young offensive line — four
freshmen started against
USC."
The impotent Beaver offense
— OSU has scored only 50
points in six games — fares
slightly better when it takes to
the air. Junior QB Steve Smith
has completed 50 of 102 passes
for 636 yards and four
touchdowns. His favorite
target is diminutive Steve
Coury, a 5-foot-8 split end who
has caught 16 passes for a 16.5
yard average and two TDs.
The OSU defense, while not
statistically impressive — it has
yielded 348.7 yards a game — is
well-conceived.
"They have one of the best
coached defensive teams in
the country," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "It's the reason
why Fertig has held his job
amid all the duress'up there.
It's just short on talent."
Tackle Tom Schillinger and
end Jerry Wilkinson anchorthe
Beaver defensive front. Schil
linger leads the Beavers in tack
les with 62 stops while the
6-foot-9, 261-pound Wilkinson
is third in tackles with 47.
Right corner Tim Smith, an
excellent return man, is the
standout in the Beaver secon
dary with four interceptions
and 29 tackles.
The Oregon State defense
could be in for the much
traveled "long afternoon" to
morrow. The Stanford offense,
ranked third in the nation with

459.7 yards a game, devastated
Washington State with 607
yards last week and must cer
tainly entertain thoughts of br
