# San Jose contest crucial
## Spikers facing 'must win' situation 
### PETER FINCH 
Tonight in Northern California Athletic
Conference women's volleyball, the Stan
ford Cards take on the San Jose State Spar
tans. The Cardinal spikers, now 4-1 in
NCAC play, 5-3 overall, have won four
conference games in a row.
The Spartans, leading the NCAC, have
pounded out four straight conference
wins as well, and stand at 8-4 overall. Be
cause San Jose defeated Stanford earlier
this season, Cardinal coach Fred Sturm has
described this match as a "must win" for
his squad.

"San Jose is the toughest team in North
ern California," Sturm said. "We will have
to be much more alert as to what's happen
ing on the court, and be consistent in our
execution of the game plan."
Sturm also noted that his team is well
prepared for tonight's contest. "We've
had a very good week of practice and I
believe that we're ready," he said. "What
this comes down to is a match for first
place â€” we've got as many winsas they do,
but we also have that one loss."
Senior setter Shawn Hoover, who

played well in Stanford's non-conference
losses to national powers USC and UCLA,
also claimed that San Jose is the toughest
team in the conference.
"We're past USC and UCLA now, and
they're tougher (than the Spartans), but if
we lose now we won't get a chance to play
any tougher teams in the post-season," she
said. "We've been working on how to de
fend against their offense this week."
Tonight's match starts at 7:30 and will be
followed by a match tomorrow at 3 p.m.
against Fresno State. Both matches will be
in Maples Pavilion.
