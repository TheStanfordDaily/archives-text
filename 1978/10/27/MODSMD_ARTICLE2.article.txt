# Crew out of husband's campaign
## Fonda boosts activist group 
### RACHEL BAGBY 
The issue of economic democracy cuts across class
lines, age lines and sex lines, Jane Fonda said in a press
conference following yesterday's noon rally.
"People are beginning to recognize a need for
statewide and nationwide movements to address this
country's problems," she said.
The Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED) has
been instrumental in organizing grassroots support for
measures like Proposition 13, Fonda said.
CED, a state-wide organization, grew out of Tom
Hayden's senatorial campaign two years ago, Fonda
said. CED was created to sustain the interest in
economic and political change that was generated by
Hayden's campaign.
"The money I get for speaking today goes to CED,"
Fonda said. "We are working on a lot of key issues."
Feminists
CED is supporting radification of the equal rights
amendment, she said, adding that all of the women
involved with CED are also feminists.
"There ne£ds to be a separate women's movement
because there are certain problems women face that are
uniquely ours," Fonda said.
However, she stressed the need for "a close alliance
between a multi-issue economic organization such as
CED and the women's movement. Its the only way to
minimize conflict."
Fonda does not think her acting career conflicts with
her political views. Instead she uses the film industry to
further those views.
"My roles in movies generally reflect my personal
politics," she said. The money she earns is used to invest
in small businesses, support CED programs and develop
solar energy, she said.
CED has done extensive work towards "solarizing''

California, Fonda said. Presently, solar heating is too
expensive for all bu'the rich. "CED is working to change
that," she said.
Over a year ago CED published SolarCal, a proposal
for state-wide development of solar energy, and lobbied
in Sacramento for its adoption, according to Mignon
McCarthy, coordinaSor of CED's Palo Alto chapter.
On May 3 of this year, Gov. Jerry Brown created the
SolarCal agency. The agency will advise the governor on
state policies for solar energy, McCarthy said.
Charge for sunlight
"CED frustrated the utilities' attempts to corner the
solar energy market and charge for sunlight," Fonda
said. In August the California assembly passed a bill
regulating utility involvement in solar energy develop
ment.
Fonda said the development of solar energy could
reduce California's unemployment rate by approxi
mately 50 percent.
The unskilled and chronically unemployed could be
given jobs selling, distributing and installing solar
energy units, she said. .
Non-inflationary
"Solar energy represents a new way of living," Fonda
said. It is a non-inflationary energy form, is economically
sound and will release Californians from dependence
on more expensive and dangerous energy sources, she
said.
Fonda said CED plans to investigate why California is
the "cancer capitol of the world." CED recently hired a
researcher to determine what areas have the highest
cancer rates and what industries are located in those
areas.
"There may not be a cure for cancer, but it can be
prevented," she said, adding the CED may campaign to
create an agency that will encourage cancer prevention.

in small businesses, support CED programs and develop
solar energy, she said.
CED has done extensive work towards "solarizing''

California, Fonda said. Presently, solar heating is too
expensive for all bu'the rich. "CED is working to change
that," she said.
Over a year ago CED published SolarCal, a proposal
for state-wide development of solar energy, and lobbied
in Sacramento for its adoption, according to Mignon
McCarthy, coordinaSor of CED's Palo Alto chapter.
On May 3 of this year, Gov. Jerry Brown created the
SolarCal agency. The agency will advise the governor on
state policies for solar energy, McCarthy said.
Charge for sunlight
"CED frustrated the utilities' attempts to corner the
solar energy market and charge for sunlight," Fonda
said. In August the California assembly passed a bill
regulating utility involvement in solar energy develop
ment.
Fonda said the development of solar energy could
reduce California's unemployment rate by approxi
mately 50 percent.
The unskilled and chronically unemployed could be
given jobs selling, distributing and installing solar
energy units, she said. .
Non-inflationary
"Solar energy represents a new way of living," Fonda
said. It is a non-inflationary energy form, is economically
sound and will release Californians from dependence
on more expensive and dangerous energy sources, she
said.
Fonda said CED plans to investigate why California is
the "cancer capitol of the world." CED recently hired a
researcher to determine what areas have the highest
cancer rates and what industries are located in those
areas.
"There may not be a cure for cancer, but it can be
prevented," she said, adding the CED may campaign to
create an agency that will encourage cancer prevention.
The issue of economic democracy cuts across class
lines, age lines and sex lines, Jane Fonda said in a press
conference following yesterday's noon rally.
"People are beginning to recognize a need for
statewide and nationwide movements to address this
country's problems," she said.
The Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED) has
been instrumental in organizing grassroots support for
measures like Proposition 13, Fonda said.
CED, a state-wide organization, grew out of Tom
Hayden's senatorial campaign two years ago, Fonda
said. CED was created to sustain the interest in
economic and political change that was generated by
Hayden's campaign.
"The money I get for speaking today goes to CED,"
Fonda said. "We are working on a lot of key issues."
Feminists
CED is supporting radification of the equal rights
amendment, she said, adding that all of the women
involved with CED are also feminists.
"There ne£ds to be a separate women's movement
because there are certain problems women face that are
uniquely ours," Fonda said.
However, she stressed the need for "a close alliance
between a multi-issue economic organization such as
CED and the women's movement. Its the only way to
minimize conflict."
Fonda does not think her acting career conflicts with
her political views. Instead she uses the film industry to
further those views.
"My roles in movies generally reflect my personal
politics," she said. The money she earns is used to invest
in small businesses, support CED programs and develop
solar energy, she said.
