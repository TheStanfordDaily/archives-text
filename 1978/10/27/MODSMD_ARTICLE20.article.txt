# Scotchers in crucial games at Card invite
## 
### JULIE HILL 
The Stanford field hockey
team knotted the California
scotchers 1-1 Wednesday at
Roble Field. The result was a
disappointment to the Cards as
it moves their league record to
3-1-1, and forces "must-wins"
for this weekend's Stanford In
vitational.
Twenty minutes into the Cal
game, Alison King scored off
assists by Nancy White and
Ke'ly Westerwick in a "real
team effort," according to
Stanford coach Barbara
Longstreth. But the Cards re
laxed after their goal, and UC
squad member Sheryl Johnson
of Cal maneuvered past three
Stanford players and the goal
keeper to score in the next 30
seconds.
After Wednesday's
heartbreaking tje, Longstreth
said, "Everything is coming
down to what we do on Satur
day." Cal, Cal Poly-Pomona
and Long Beach State will par
ticipate in the invitational. The
first game starts at 10 a.m., pit
ting Stanford against Southern
Conference contender Cal
Poly-Pomona, followed by a
match between California and
conference leader Long Beach
State. The second double
header, at 2:30 p.m., matches
the Cards against LBS and the
Bears against Pomona.
As San Jose State and Long
Beach State have captured the
Northern-and Southern Con
ferences respectively, only two
spots are open for Stanford to
get in the Regional play-offs.
The Cards can do this by win
ning those upcoming cross
over games and their remain
ing league match.
