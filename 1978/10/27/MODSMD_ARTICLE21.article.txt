# Clown cooks grid & grill greats; a burger king who is no Bozo
## 
### 
The Daily wanted someone special to do
this week's football picks. No, we wouldn't
settle for the usual clown.
We searched high and low, hither and yon,
and finally up and down El Camino. We
found that someone special. (Indeed, we
found him several times.)
We found someone that Stanford students
feel comfortable talking to. Someone who
always has a friendly voice and is never with
out a smile. Someone who always remains
even-tempered. (Well, he has lost his head a
few times when rambunctious fraternities
have patronized his establishments.)
In short, we found a Jack of one trade —
the burger business. Mr. Jack "In The" Box,
friend of the late-night student, has con
sented to do this week's pigskin prognostic
ations. Not only did he help us choose this
week's games, he was very helpful with his
firm's pigskin picks. We chose the Bonus
Jack.

this week's football picks. No, we wouldn't
settle for the usual clown.
We searched high and low, hither and yon,
and finally up and down El Camino. We
found that someone special. (Indeed, we
found him several times.)
We found someone that Stanford students
feel comfortable talking to. Someone who
always has a friendly voice and is never with
out a smile. Someone who always remains
even-tempered. (Well, he has lost his head a
few times when rambunctious fraternities
have patronized his establishments.)
In short, we found a Jack of one trade —
the burger business. Mr. Jack "In The" Box,
friend of the late-night student, has con
sented to do this week's pigskin prognostic
ations. Not only did he help us choose this
week's games, he was very helpful with his
firm's pigskin picks. We chose the Bonus
Jack.
Watch out McDonald's:
"USC over Cal. My loyalties are divided
Oregon St. Arizona
vs. Stanford vs. UCLA
Ivan Maisel Stanford UCLA
(19-4-1) (31-6) (30-20)
Emilie Deutsch Stanford UCLA
(18-5-1) (34-10) (21-17)
Bruce Anderson Stanford UCLA

Jack "In The" Box Stanford Arizona
burger magnate ($69-$.24) ($1.49-$1.19)

here, since both schools have more than
their share of fat-headed clowns, but USC
should take it because Cal has a tendency to
give their Moby Jacks to the wrong passen
gers. Also, USC has a decent team.
"Arizona over UCLA. I realize this may
sound like something of a super scoop, but
UCLA ain't as good as they think. Although
only a franchise, Arizona is rising fast and it
will surely find a way around the triple-thick
Bruin D.
"WSU over Oregon. Jack Thompson. JACK
Thompson."
"Washington over Arizona State. True,
both teams consist of high-quality beef, but
both also lack that special secret sauce that
keeps a game from being cheesy. It should be
close — neither team will get fried.
"Stanford over OSU. A game to go (to). The
Cards are truly bonus. OSU deserves a break
today, but we all know that they won't get it,
since the Stanford D is ready to prove that
they don't run no drive-thru.
"Will that be all for you this evening?"
Cal vs. WSU vs. Arizona St. vs.
