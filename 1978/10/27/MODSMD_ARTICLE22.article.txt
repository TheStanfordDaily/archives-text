# LA
						State, UCLA whitewash Cards
## Booters trip south disappointing 
### DEAN EYRE 
Stanford soccer coach Nel
son Lodge and his team are
talking about the one that got
away, but they're not referring
to an angling mishap. In this
case, the "one" is their road
trip to Southern California
which resulted in losses at the
hands...rather the feet, of Los
Angeles State and UCLA.
By far the more frustrating of
the two defeats came Tuesday
as the Cardinals outplayed LA
State, but dropped a 1-0 deci
sion. Even though they were
outshot by a 20-to-5 margin,
the Diablos stayed in the match
and capitalized on a Stanford
defensive error with 2Vi mi
nutes remaining.
"We seem to have one of
these (games) every year,"
Lodge said. "We dominated,
conservatively speaking, 85
percent of the game — by
domination I mean we spent
most of the time striking and
controlling the ball in their de
fensive half of the field. It's the
kind of game coaches really
hate to lose because we actu
ally controlled most of the
game.
"It seemed to me as though
we were waiting for UCLA the
next day. We weren't finishing
the way we should have. They
were a very respectable team,"
he added.
In Wednesday's contest with
the Bruins, the teams played
evenly until a mental letdown
taught up with the Cards in the
second half. Carlos Zaraleta
and Woshi Mizrah teamed up
to break the deadlock 24 mi
nutes into the second period.
About 10 minutes later IJCLA
scored the last goal of the game
withashot by Jerry Schnitman.
"I think the mistake I made
as a coach was the fact that I

told them that their first half
was good and they thought
that was all they had to do. If I
were ever to do it again —
coaches learn too — what I
would do is say, we're doing
an excellent job but if you want
towin ityou'regoing to have to
play better.'"
Stanford, posting a 13-4 mark
and ranked 10th in the Far
West, faces its acid test of the

season tomorrow, hosting
three-time national champion
USF on Maloney Field at 10
a.m.
"As far as the regionals
there's just an outside chance
at this point," Lodge said. "If
we're going to show anybody
anything as far as the regional
rating committee is con
cerned, we're going to have to
do an excellent job against

USF. If we could win that game,
that would turn everything
around in our favor.
"UCLA scored twice on them
and then lost 3-2 in overtime
and Westmont, who we beat
1 -0, lost 2-1 and even had a goal
called back on them because of
an offsides call,' he added.
Tomorrow is being prom
oted as Palo Alto American
Youth Soccer Organization
Soccer Day at Stanford and the
proceeds of ticket sales will be
split between Stanford's soc
cer program and the AYSO
league. A preliminary AYSO
game will be featured at 8:30
a.m. and the Los Trancos
Marching Band will entertain
picnicking spectators.
