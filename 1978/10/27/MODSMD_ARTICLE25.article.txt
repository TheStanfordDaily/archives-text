True Confessions
John Gregory Dunne
Pocket Books
371 pg. $2.50
A glance at the lurid cover of
True Confessions causes one
to suspect that the promises of
a murder-mystery story are
only a thin veil for a story of
quite another kind. And that
suspicion would be correct.
John Gregory Dunne's tren
chant novel is much more than
a mere tale of suspense. The
bizarre, overpublicized mur
der of a would-be actress,
however, unifies the primary
story of True Confessions. Tom
and Desmond Spellacy are, re
spectively, a detective and a
monsignor. Raised in Los
Angeles' Boyle Heights, a
tough Irish-Catholic
neighborhood, their profes
sions provide spatial escapes
from the neighborhood, but
they never escape their herit
age.
Disciplined professionalism
Dunne weaves their intricate
history of conflict and de
velopment with a style as terse
and stringent as their environ
ment. He slips from the pre-

sent day narrative of Tom to an
omniscient narrator retelling
30-year-old events, then back
to Tom again. We slide back
and forth in time through these
natural transitions. Dunne re
veals a disciplined profes
sionalism in controlling the
multitude of characters and
events toward the company
conclusion of True Confes
sions.
There is reason to his writ
ing. A seemingly indulgent slip
of the pen results in an impor
tant detail. Yet Dunne's book,
though serious, is not always
serious in mood. His ironic
sense of humor pervades the
novel. He creates a nun who
wants to become a profes
sional bowler, a detective (Tom
Spellacy's partner) who ac
cepts kickbacks and dresses in
Sidney Creenstreet's used
suits, and a priest who occa
sionally cheers up a mass by
singing "My Old Kentucky
Home" instead of the Agnus
Dei.
Came of survival
A bitter form of this humor
runs through the Spellacy
brothers. Each bases his ac
tions on the concept that man
is fallible. Tom feels that his
brother, the monsignor, "was
always waiting for you to stum
ble, and after you did, it proved
some kind of point that only be
could understand." As for
Tom, "One thing the Cardinal
knew about policemen: they
accepted as a given the taint on
the human condition."
Tom and Des excel in the
game of survival. The powerful
monsignor turns his head
when necessary for the finan
cial benefit of the Catholic
Church. "A little humanity was

the only thing the monsignor
seemed deficient in."
Necessary distance
Dunne distances the men
and his readers by never de
scribing the characters in phys
ical detail and never closely
examining their views of their
relationships. The Spellacys
need this distance so that they
can exist without despair.
Tom's wife, Mary Margaret,
chooses another route — in
sanity. Late in the story,
though, Des sees that it is "just
a wall she could hide behind so
that no one could ever touch
her again. . .an elaborate joke
that freed her from the respon
sibility of making contact."
The Spellacys, in the context
of their world, are realistic
ratherthan cynical. Despite the
encompassing corruption, the
112 requent brutality, and the war
iness necessary to survive
every encounter, tones of bit
terness never disturb the
sleekness of Dunne's writing.
Reversion
The theme is not innovative,
but Dunne's novel is an admir
able reversion to a familiar
style. The black and white True
Confessions reminds one of
lessons taught by late night
movies. The book entertains
with its sharp dialogue, and the
brisk pace encourages one to
finish before doing anything
else. The development of the
Spellacys interests even more
than the mysterious murder.
I still find it odd, though, that
Dunne's publishers believe it
more profitable to market True
Confessions as a slightly por
nographic mystery rather than
the well-written, tightly woven
character study it is.

It Takes a Long Time to Be
come Young
Garson Kanin
Doubleday
185 pg. $6.95
At 66, author-playwright
director Garson Kanin is any
thing but "over the hill." A firm
believer that age is a matter of
attitude, Kanin declares war on
the "mindless youth cult" of
today and provides a rousing
and thoroughly entertaining
indictment against the societal
practice of arbitrarily declaring
a person obsolete at 65.
Kanin's crusade began after
hearing a New York television
editorial which declared: "As a
practical matter, we think
mandatory retirement does
make sense if the age chosen is
a reasonable one." "Non
sense!" Kanin angrily replied.
"Working men and women
should retire for two reasons
only: if they want to retire or if
they are unable to function."
Heaskswhy, inaculture where
people are living longer, soci
ety should forcibly declare
them antiquated earlier and
earlier.
The villain, Kanin says, is
"the mindless youth cult that
has our time in its grip." Since
World War 11, youth has be
come "big business," and as
the economy pursues it, we
idolize it.
Youth cult
Cars, clothing, cosmetics —
everything is aimed at the
young, or those who wish to
feel young. The post-war
bonanza catered to youth's de
sire for speed: faster cars,
speed reading, fast food, in
stant ecstasy through drugs,
instant poverty through tat-

tered jeans and bare feet.
Catch phrases appeared.
"Don't trust anyone over 30"
became the "new genera
tion's" motto. "Young was 'in,'
old was 'out,' " Kanin sum
marizes.
"The youth cult forces upon
us unnatural behavior,
phoniness, lies, deceptions
and assorted humiliations,"

Kanin declares. People feel
ashamed to tell their real age so
they hide it in an embarrassed
lie. Anti-aging creams, lotions,
pastes and powders do a
booming business. Plastic sur
geons drive Cadillacs. Sex is
packaged and pushed as a ple
asure of only the young.
Forced retirement, Kanin
claims, is in itself a death war
rant for many people. He
quotes Dr. Custav Eckstein, 88,
a professor of Medicine at the
University of Cincinatti:
Fading process
"The trouble with mandat
ory retirement is this: if you tell
a man he's going to be retired
on his sixty-fifth birthday it's
much the same as telling a man
sitting on death row that he's
going to be executed on the
thirteenth of June. These

people who've been told that
start to fade a little. And then
they get to be sixty-one and
they fade a little more. By the
time they get to be 65 they're
finished. They join the
shuffleboard set and fade
away."
Kanin argues that inactivity, not
activity, wears out the human
machine.

Kanin fills his battle with
examples of people who are or
were impressively active in
their 70s, 80s and 90s, includ
ing: Chagall, Somerset
Maugham, Picasso, Armand
Hammer, Edison, Bellini and
Cervantes.
Kanin goes on and on, paral
leling his vignettes with exam
ples of once active people who
decline to faded individuals
following forced retirement.
Clever aphorisms head each
chapter: "To rest is to rust,"
Dr. Paul Bragg, 96; "How old
would you be if you didn't
know how you was?" Satchel
Paige; and "No wise man ever
wished to be younger,"
Jonathan Swift.
Yet on a more serious note
Kanin presents alarming statis
tics; one-third of all marriages

are shattered following retire
ment and the suicide rate for a
retired man is 12 times that of
those who are employed.
Alternatives
Kanin offers no quick solu
tions, but suggests alternatives
allowing for retirement to be
planned rather than forced.
Foremost among these is the
idea of gradual retirement — a
planned, shortened work
program as the employee ages.
Kanin points out that older
people, those 60 and over,
constitute the fastest growing
minority in America today.
There are over 31 million older
Americans, a politically effec
tive force if organized. In addi
tion, this group is potentially
the most powerful because it
has by far the highest voting
percentage of any bloc.
Optimistic
Desite his indignant attacks
on society's treatment of the
aged, Kanin ends on an op
timistic note stating, "I persist
in my belief that a nation which
successfully put men on the
moon can also put men on
earth."
Though Kanin's arguments
against forced retirement are
spiritedly put forth, the ten
dency toward simplistic formu
lations and breezy overviews
of the problems and implica
tions detracts from his ultimate
seriousness. Kanin's congenial
informality and easy prose
style make his book enjoyable
reading. Though surely in
spired to older patrons, it is
those of us under 30 who
should think twice about Ka
nin's final quote: "Youth is a
gift of nature; age is a work of
art."
