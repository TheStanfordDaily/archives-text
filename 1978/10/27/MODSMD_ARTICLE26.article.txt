Zen in the Art of J.D. Salinger
Gerald Rosen
Creative Arts Book Company
40 pg. $2.50
Zen in the Art of f.D. Salinger is not, as
the title suggests, a treatise on Zen Buddh
ism using j.D. Salinger's works as a
medium for discussion. It does not follow
the literary and philosophical tradition of
Robert Pirsig'sZen and the Art of Motorcy
cle Maintenance nor that of Eugen Her
rigel's Zen in the Art of Archery. The title,
in fact, is little more than a clever
attention-grabber for a glorified theme
paper.
This is not to say, however, that Zen in
the Art of /. D. Salinger does not live up to
some literary standard. Rosen seems to
have studied The Catcher in the Rye
(Salinger's best known work) extensively:
his arguments are well-supported with
quotations. Rosen does not blatantly mis
represent Salinjjer's work to support his
own hypothesis.
Purpose?
But what exactly is Rosen's hypothesis?
The title would lead us to believe that he is
arguing a relationship between J.D.
Salinger's works and Zen Buddhism. The
book's first sentences reinforce this ex
pectation: "The Zen masters have a say
ing, 'Sometimes we go east, sometimes we
go west.' It appears that J.D. Salinger, after
a brief attempt to 'go west' in the American
army during World War 11, became disil
lusioned with his native culture and soci
ety and turned to a study of Eastern
thought." The next sentence surprises us
by not following up on the reference to
Salinger's study of Eastern thought: "This

disillusionment can be seen in his first
novel, The Catcher in the Rye."
The paragraph becomes more confus
ing: it continues by comparing Salinger to
D.B. Caulfield (older brother of Catcher's
narrator and hero, Holden Caulfield), by
discussing Salinger's relationship with
Hollywood, by noting the relationship be
tween an author and the characters he
creates, and finally by comparing D.B.'s
disillusionment to that of the narrator in
"For Esme — with Love and Squalor."
Where does this train of thought leave us?
Certainly not any closer to a comprehen
sion of the purpose of the book.
Originality
Actually, Rosen does introduce the crux
of his argument a few pages later. He as
serts and spends most of the book defend
ing his assertion that the life of Holden
Caulfield is analogous to the life of
Sakyamuni (also known as the Buddha). By
this means, Rowen emphasizes themes
from The Catcher in the Rye which most of
the book's critics either ignored or didn't
notice. This originality is the book's
strongest attribute and the major source of
what literary value it does have.
In his comparison between the lives of
Holden and the Buddha, Rosen's favorite
theme is Holden's preoccupation with
death. Holden, like the Buddha, had a very
sheltered childhood in an "affluent, pro
tective environment." When the young
men were exposed to sickness and death
(Holden when his younger brother Allie
died of leukemia), they each began a
search for someone who would teach
them to "come to terms with sickness, old
age and death." Rosen uses this as a
springboard for his discussion of Holden's

preoccupation with death, especially his
excessive concentration upon bodily func
tionings and his inability to accept Allie's
death.
Discrepancy
The analogy between the lives of Hol
den and the Buddha is complete in all as
pects but one: the Buddha reaches an un
derstanding of death on his own, whereas
Holden must be guided by his sister
Phoebe. Rosen doesn't mention this dis
crepancy, yet it is unmistakably there:
thus his comparison of Holden and the
Buddha loses much of its validity. If
Salinger did "go east" in writing about
Holden's fascination with death, he re
turned to the west when Phoebe became
Holden's guide.
Inappropriate
It is puzzling to note that Rosen spent
most of the book discussing The Catcher
in the Rye even though Franny and Zooey
and the short story "Tesridy" deal much
more explicitly with Eastern religions.
Salinger's fascination with Zen Buddhism
(which was a major part of the Salinger
myth during the 19505) and his attitude
toward it are expressed covertly in The
Catcher in the Rye, if they are expressed at
all. Perhaps Rosen chose to study Zen in
Catcher because it was a greater challenge
to his understanding of Salinger. No mat
ter what his reasons are, though, the title
Zen in the Art of I. D. Salinger is inapprop
riate because it creates expectationswhich
are not met by the book.
If Rosen is capableof understanding and
explaining the relationship between
Salinger's work and Zen Buddhism, this
book is not a good indication of his ability.

Acts of Love
Elia Kazan
Alfred A. Knopf
436 pg. $9.95
In A Streetcar Named Desire,
Blanche Dußois cries, "I don't
want realism — give me
magic!" In Acts Of Love, the
fourth novel written by Elia Ka
zan, director of both the stage
and film versions of Streetcar,
we have another heroine trying
to escape reality, in a variety of
ways; through the "magic" of
casual sex and self
gratification, through a sub
mersion in and submission to
Old World values, and even by
joining the navy. The fact that
none of these ploys work for
her raises the question of what,
exactly, Kazan is trying to say;
for there is nothing present in
the reality he depicts to
suggest that she shouldn't
have tried to escape it.
Acts Of Love itself is as un
easy a marriage as any of those
which it portrays. Falling half
way between an attempted
work of art and a calculated
bestseller, it has the bad qual
ities of both. All the signposts
of significance are here; no
thing very exciting happens,
the dialogue is improbable,
and there are even very broad
Homeric allusions. These exist
side by side with the slushpile
prose and obligatory pornog
raphy of the bestseller. In

short, there is nothing to re
commend the book other than
the view it gives the reader of
Kazan's mind, which seems
uncomplicated at best.
Standard criticisms
These, however, are criti
cisms that can be made of most
of today's novels, and with
them out of the way we can
return to the question of what
Kazan is trying to say.
Ethel Laffey is the center
piece of the novel; most of the
other characters exist only as
they relate to her. The spoiled
daughter of a rich Arizona doc
tor, she has been rebelling all
her life; first against her father,
and what he stands for, by
sleeping "with every
pimplefaced boy in town";
then against her own promis
cuity by marrying a young en
sign and joining the navy her
self. Teddy, her husband, is
Creek, and his father was born
in Greece.
The essential conflict of the
book becomes that between
Ethel and Costa Avaliotis, her
father-in-law, and herein lies
the major problem; for Costa,

who takes up half the space in
the novel that Ethel does, is by
far the more interesting
character, and probably could
have been the subject of a fairly
interesting book. Ethel is a
stock figure of modern litera
ture, the woman in search of
herself, and pales after 50
pages, but Costa is fascinating
throughout. He believes in an
absolute law, and con
sequently has a very simple
scale of values; Ethel shall be
faithful to his son, and shall
produce him a grandson, for
this is the natural order of
things and the only purpose a
woman can truly have.
Ethel spends the entire book
wavering, leaving Teddy with
out a second thought but al
wayscoming back to Costa; for
she is just as attracted to him as
the reader is. Her various es
capes have a sameness to
them; she flies to another city,
finds a man, decides he is only
using her (besides being no
good in bed), and goes back to
Costa. The implication seems
to be that "American" men are
too concerned with them
selves to give Ethel the satisfac
tion she needs; only with Pet
ros, another Greek immigrant,
does she achieve an orgasm
after 350 mostly dry pages.
The final reckoning, of
course, must be between Ethel
and Costa, and once again it
would be much more powerful
if Kazan concentrated on
Costa. When Costa discovers
that the grandson Ethel has (lit
erally) gave him is not Teddy's
son, but Petros', and that Ethel
plans to leave Teddy and
"make it on her own," he tries
to kill Petros and does kill
Ethel.
But what could have been a
very powerful ending is
trivialized by Kazan's emphasis
on Ethel's death and its effects;
what is truly tragic is the
breakup of Costa's mind when
he is faced with too dangerous
a challenge to his beliefs.
Kazan will never be a great
writer, but he does have a ta
lent for characterization. He
could write a good book about
the right character. But in Acts
Of Love, the pathos of the right
character is submerged in the
triteness and triviality of the
main character.
