With science fiction, there's
no telling what's going to hap
pen. Unpredictability is its
strongest suit. With one stroke
disbelief can be suspended in
midair, in direct defiance of
gravity. It doesn't matter what
you thought before. You're in
another world — almost.
I say almost because some
times writers forget. Some
times writers forget they write
for human audiences, not for
computer-programmed an
droids who respect only ra
tionality. All too often science
fiction becomes a mass of
clever ideas admirable only as a
tribute to human intelligence.
Or at another extreme science
fiction becomes a morass of
alien sunsets and planetfalls
which bear as little re
semblance to anything in our
sensibilities as the musings of
an ant.
Fortunately, the writers
showcased in The Altered I, an
experimental workshop con
ducted by noted author Ursula
K. LeGuin, don't fall into either
of these traps. Reading these
stories reminds you that, after
all, science fiction is still writ
ing.
Honesty
One thing strikes you im
mediately as you read this
book. It is almost brutally frank
and open, devoid of pretenti
ousness. The writers include
both thoughts and commen
tary on how they felt and cried
during the attempts to write.
There's no feeling of insincer
ity or contrivance in their
notes; just honest effort.
And it works. The stories
have feeling, because you
know the writers felt as they
wrote. The stories are clever
without being sterile.
It's scary how you get drawn
into the sense of where they
are. Imagine being trapped
somewhere in the "remote
Dandenong Range of Au
stralia," writingyour brains out
under the tutelage of one of
Science Fiction's biggest
names.
Sure, it's a little bit bal
lyhooed. You know they
exaggerate a little when they
call it a "unique work of the
imagination that has opened
unforeseen new horizons." I
just hope that's the publisher's
fault.
Revelation
Because the stories them
selves are a revelation. In many

ways they represent a depar
ture from the "cute" stories
that seem to pop up in Analog
and other Science Fiction
magazines.
"Single changes" is a good
example of well-written, tight
prose. None of the three
pieces featured here could be
considered to be a short story,
in a normal sense, for they are
more like settings then stories;
but as part of a workshopping
effort, it's very easy to see how
they might fit in as jumping-off
points for a real story.
The three pieces, written by
David Grigg, Pip Maddern and
Barbara j. Coleman (all of
whom I will egotistically assert
are very promising young writ
ers) are short and witty. None
of them is more than three
pages long. Each focuses on
one simple departure from re
ality as we perceive it — and
spins that charge into an in
teresting vignette.
What if . ..
In a sense, these "single
changes" capsulize the raison
d'etre of science fiction, that
quantum leap away from real
ity to a realm that is not quite
pure fantasy. What if. . .?
The love stories are another
matter, for they blur the dis
tinction between science fic
tion and "ordinary" fiction.
The themes are the same, the
people as cruel or human/
inhuman as they have always
been. Of the six presented, I
found David Grigg's "Islands"
the most conventional. Take
away the asteroids and the
Russian names and it could
have been from Reader's Di
gest.
Morbid humor
On the other hand, some of
the others were truly diver
gent. Bruce Gillespie's "Veget
able Love" barely merited the
love story category — sexually
tuned mosses and protop
lasms, especially with the tone
given by Gillespie, qualify
more as morbid humor.
John Edward Clark's "Emily,

My Emily," on superficial read
ing, seems conventional, but
there's a certain deranged lilt
to the story that makes your
hair stand on end. Vou might
wonder what is at all conven
tional about a man in a lifeboat
with a life-size inflatable doll
(complete with instructions),
but the distinguishing touch
which Clark adds is a subtle
one.

Most impressive is Randal
Flynn's "Down toward the
Sun," a story about two clones
of the same man: one male,
one female. Flynn provides us
with a surprisingly moving
love/hate relationship — a
love/hate relationship with
oneself. The implications of
total self-love are frightening.
"We'll always be alone," the
clone says, and the thought,
unfortunately, causes reverb
erations of loneliness.
The volume also includes
stories using a literary device
we don't see much of these
days — dialogue. Bruce
Barnes' "After the Wreck of the
Stellar Queen" is an all-too
obvious and disappointing
employment of this form.
Barnes fails to explore the pos
sibilities of his story, and is
satisfied to present a trite story
in a slightly different way.
Reading this piece is like listen
ing to both sides of a Bob
Newhart telephone conversa
tion — you know too much,
and when you get to the punch
line, you ask yourself "is that
alir

In striking contrast, Andrew
Whitmore's "Process" grips
the reader as an imaginative
use of dialogue. Whitmore's
main character is a nebulous
female manipulator, whose
goals are but dimly revealed in
a chilling exchange with an un
named protege. It is dialogue
stripped bare. I must admit I'm
not sure what it means, but
that's not the point. What I did
know when I read it was that I
was scared.
Insight
The Altered I is more than
just a collection of short
stories. It's in sightintotheway
stories are written and that's
something anyone can benefit
from. As Randal Flynn admits,
in one of his comments, "Sor
cery, you see, is a hard busi
ness. Done with half a heart it
produces a lot of smoke and
egg gas. Done seriously, and
with honest spells, there is a
shadowy hope of creating a liv
ing prism. This is a story; a
magic, a masterpiece. But it
isn't always easy. The spells
have to be learned, the amal
gams acquired. This requires
luck, knack or a workshop.
Which shows you magic in ac
tion and may make you into an
arch-mage or something. But it
is still hard work."
Good writing is hard work.
And in this case, it is much ap
preciated.

The Harrad Experiment
Robert H. Rimmer
Bantam Press
253 pg. $1.95
For many of us college students, sex is still a
hard commodity to come by. Although we are
living in the midst of the Sexual Revolution, we
still have a hard time winning the relatively small
battles of getting to know members of the oppo
site sex.
If we had been college students in the '60s, we
probably would have read The Harrad Experi
ment to quench our sexual appetites. Proc
laimed as the "sex manifesto of the free love
generation," The Harrad Experiment (first pub
lished in 1966) became a sensational and con
troversial bestseller almost overnight.
Recently, a revised version of Robert Rim
mer's fiction was released which includes a spe
cial afterword on the sexual patterns of today s
youth. But whereas The Harrad Experiment may
have appealed to the vast sexual imaginations of
college students in the '60s, today it seems out
dated, if not comic.
Harrad College is a small "bootleg'' school
located somewhere near Boston. But Harrad is
unlike any other school in the country. At Har
rad men and women live and sleep together, in
an "atmosphere of controlled sexual freedom."
This "microcosmic society" is "designed to
achieve sexual sanity" by replacing people's
sexual repressions with a "new sexual ethic and
moral code."
« Sex
Rimmer, however, gets a little carried away
and makes some rather silly statements about
sex and human destiny. (In fact Rimmer de
scribes himself as a writer who thinks he can
move the world.) The book turns into an odd
combination of lofty idealism and pure pornog
raphy. But it is the pornography, and not the
idealism which makes the novel readable.

Following the story line again, the Harrad stu
dents soon graduate to communal sex and make
a habit out of swapping partners. At one point, a
group of students go to the beach for the
weekend. Harry, whose roommate is Beth,
spends the night with Valerie, whose roommate
is Jack. I'll let Rimmer take over from here: "I
(Harry) awoke with the sun a red crescent on the
horizon . . . Val was holding my penis lightly
half asleep herself. Our climax was sleepy,
sweet and hungrily joyful. I was asleep again in
her arms when Stanley yeiled, 'Come on, all you
young lovers. Last one in the ocean is custard
the dragon.' "
Pornography
But the pornography is precisely the problem
with Rimmer's book. Whereas in the '60s,
hard-up college students had to buy books like
The Harrad Experiment and use their imagina
tions, today we no longer need to use our im
aginations. The Sexual Revolution, although it
may not have taught us how to get sex, has
presented us with explicit pornographic scenes
in movies, on stage, and occasionally, if we are
lucky, in our own bedrooms. We no longer have
to read about what it is like having sex with a
gorgeous blond or brunette, we can go down to
the local movie theater and see it for ourselves.
So next time you feel the urge coming on
rather than going out and buying The Harrad
Experiment, buy yourself a ticket to see Sonia
Braga's latest picture, Donna Flor and Her Two
Husbands orSteveTracy in Beneath the Valley of
the Ultravixens; or better yet, go out and get
yourself a piece of the real thing.

disbelief can be suspended in
midair, in direct defiance of
gravity. It doesn't matter what
you thought before. You're in
another world — almost.
I say almost because some
times writers forget. Some
times writers forget they write
for human audiences, not for
computer-programmed an
droids who respect only ra
tionality. All too often science
fiction becomes a mass of
clever ideas admirable only as a
tribute to human intelligence.
Or at another extreme science
fiction becomes a morass of
alien sunsets and planetfalls
which bear as little re
semblance to anything in our
sensibilities as the musings of
an ant.
Fortunately, the writers
showcased in The Altered I, an
experimental workshop con
ducted by noted author Ursula
K. LeGuin, don't fall into either
of these traps. Reading these
stories reminds you that, after
all, science fiction is still writ
ing.
Honesty
One thing strikes you im
mediately as you read this
book. It is almost brutally frank
and open, devoid of pretenti
ousness. The writers include
both thoughts and commen
tary on how they felt and cried
during the attempts to write.
There's no feeling of insincer
ity or contrivance in their
notes; just honest effort.
And it works. The stories
have feeling, because you
know the writers felt as they
wrote. The stories are clever
without being sterile.
It's scary how you get drawn
into the sense of where they
are. Imagine being trapped
somewhere in the "remote
Dandenong Range of Au
stralia," writingyour brains out
under the tutelage of one of
Science Fiction's biggest
names.
Sure, it's a little bit bal
lyhooed. You know they
exaggerate a little when they
call it a "unique work of the
imagination that has opened
unforeseen new horizons." I
just hope that's the publisher's
fault.
Revelation
Because the stories them
selves are a revelation. In many

ways they represent a depar
ture from the "cute" stories
that seem to pop up in Analog
and other Science Fiction
magazines.
"Single changes" is a good
example of well-written, tight
prose. None of the three
pieces featured here could be
considered to be a short story,
in a normal sense, for they are
more like settings then stories;
but as part of a workshopping
effort, it's very easy to see how
they might fit in as jumping-off
points for a real story.
The three pieces, written by
David Grigg, Pip Maddern and
Barbara j. Coleman (all of
whom I will egotistically assert
are very promising young writ
ers) are short and witty. None
of them is more than three
pages long. Each focuses on
one simple departure from re
ality as we perceive it — and
spins that charge into an in
teresting vignette.
What if . ..
In a sense, these "single
changes" capsulize the raison
d'etre of science fiction, that
quantum leap away from real
ity to a realm that is not quite
pure fantasy. What if. . .?
The love stories are another
matter, for they blur the dis
tinction between science fic
tion and "ordinary" fiction.
The themes are the same, the
people as cruel or human/
inhuman as they have always
been. Of the six presented, I
found David Grigg's "Islands"
the most conventional. Take
away the asteroids and the
Russian names and it could
have been from Reader's Di
gest.
Morbid humor
On the other hand, some of
the others were truly diver
gent. Bruce Gillespie's "Veget
able Love" barely merited the
love story category — sexually
tuned mosses and protop
lasms, especially with the tone
given by Gillespie, qualify
more as morbid humor.
John Edward Clark's "Emily,

My Emily," on superficial read
ing, seems conventional, but
there's a certain deranged lilt
to the story that makes your
hair stand on end. Vou might
wonder what is at all conven
tional about a man in a lifeboat
with a life-size inflatable doll
(complete with instructions),
but the distinguishing touch
which Clark adds is a subtle
one.

Most impressive is Randal
Flynn's "Down toward the
Sun," a story about two clones
of the same man: one male,
one female. Flynn provides us
with a surprisingly moving
love/hate relationship — a
love/hate relationship with
oneself. The implications of
total self-love are frightening.
"We'll always be alone," the
clone says, and the thought,
unfortunately, causes reverb
erations of loneliness.
The volume also includes
stories using a literary device
we don't see much of these
days — dialogue. Bruce
Barnes' "After the Wreck of the
Stellar Queen" is an all-too
obvious and disappointing
employment of this form.
Barnes fails to explore the pos
sibilities of his story, and is
satisfied to present a trite story
in a slightly different way.
Reading this piece is like listen
ing to both sides of a Bob
Newhart telephone conversa
tion — you know too much,
and when you get to the punch
line, you ask yourself "is that
alir

In striking contrast, Andrew
Whitmore's "Process" grips
the reader as an imaginative
use of dialogue. Whitmore's
main character is a nebulous
female manipulator, whose
goals are but dimly revealed in
a chilling exchange with an un
named protege. It is dialogue
stripped bare. I must admit I'm
not sure what it means, but
that's not the point. What I did
know when I read it was that I
was scared.
Insight
The Altered I is more than
just a collection of short
stories. It's in sightintotheway
stories are written and that's
something anyone can benefit
from. As Randal Flynn admits,
in one of his comments, "Sor
cery, you see, is a hard busi
ness. Done with half a heart it
produces a lot of smoke and
egg gas. Done seriously, and
with honest spells, there is a
shadowy hope of creating a liv
ing prism. This is a story; a
magic, a masterpiece. But it
isn't always easy. The spells
have to be learned, the amal
gams acquired. This requires
luck, knack or a workshop.
Which shows you magic in ac
tion and may make you into an
arch-mage or something. But it
is still hard work."
Good writing is hard work.
And in this case, it is much ap

The Harrad Experiment
Robert H. Rimmer
Bantam Press
253 pg. $1.95
For many of us college students, sex is still a
hard commodity to come by. Although we are
living in the midst of the Sexual Revolution, we
still have a hard time winning the relatively small
battles of getting to know members of the oppo
site sex.
If we had been college students in the '60s, we
probably would have read The Harrad Experi
ment to quench our sexual appetites. Proc
laimed as the "sex manifesto of the free love
generation," The Harrad Experiment (first pub
lished in 1966) became a sensational and con
troversial bestseller almost overnight.
Recently, a revised version of Robert Rim
mer's fiction was released which includes a spe
cial afterword on the sexual patterns of today s
youth. But whereas The Harrad Experiment may
have appealed to the vast sexual imaginations of
college students in the '60s, today it seems out
dated, if not comic.
Harrad College is a small "bootleg'' school
located somewhere near Boston. But Harrad is
unlike any other school in the country. At Har
rad men and women live and sleep together, in
an "atmosphere of controlled sexual freedom."
This "microcosmic society" is "designed to
achieve sexual sanity" by replacing people's
sexual repressions with a "new sexual ethic and
moral code."
« Sex
Rimmer, however, gets a little carried away
and makes some rather silly statements about
sex and human destiny. (In fact Rimmer de
scribes himself as a writer who thinks he can
move the world.) The book turns into an odd
combination of lofty idealism and pure pornog
raphy. But it is the pornography, and not the
idealism which makes the novel readable.

Following the story line again, the Harrad stu
dents soon graduate to communal sex and make
a habit out of swapping partners. At one point, a
group of students go to the beach for the
weekend. Harry, whose roommate is Beth,
spends the night with Valerie, whose roommate
is Jack. I'll let Rimmer take over from here: "I
(Harry) awoke with the sun a red crescent on the
horizon . . . Val was holding my penis lightly
half asleep herself. Our climax was sleepy,
sweet and hungrily joyful. I was asleep again in
her arms when Stanley yeiled, 'Come on, all you
young lovers. Last one in the ocean is custard
the dragon.' "
Pornography
But the pornography is precisely the problem
with Rimmer's book. Whereas in the '60s,
hard-up college students had to buy books like
The Harrad Experiment and use their imagina
tions, today we no longer need to use our im
aginations. The Sexual Revolution, although it
may not have taught us how to get sex, has
presented us with explicit pornographic scenes
in movies, on stage, and occasionally, if we are
lucky, in our own bedrooms. We no longer have
to read about what it is like having sex with a
gorgeous blond or brunette, we can go down to
the local movie theater and see it for ourselves.
So next time you feel the urge coming on
rather than going out and buying The Harrad
Experiment, buy yourself a ticket to see Sonia
Braga's latest picture, Donna Flor and Her Two
Husbands orSteveTracy in Beneath the Valley of
the Ultravixens; or better yet, go out and get
yourself a piece of the real thing.

clever ideas admirable only as a
tribute to human intelligence.
Or at another extreme science
fiction becomes a morass of
alien sunsets and planetfalls
which bear as little re
semblance to anything in our
sensibilities as the musings of
an ant.
Fortunately, the writers
showcased in The Altered I, an
experimental workshop con
ducted by noted author Ursula
K. LeGuin, don't fall into either
of these traps. Reading these
stories reminds you that, after
all, science fiction is still writ
ing.
Honesty
One thing strikes you im
mediately as you read this
book. It is almost brutally frank
and open, devoid of pretenti
ousness. The writers include
both thoughts and commen
tary on how they felt and cried
during the attempts to write.
There's no feeling of insincer
ity or contrivance in their
notes; just honest effort.
And it works. The stories
have feeling, because you
know the writers felt as they
wrote. The stories are clever
without being sterile.
It's scary how you get drawn
into the sense of where they
are. Imagine being trapped
somewhere in the "remote
Dandenong Range of Au
stralia," writingyour brains out
under the tutelage of one of
Science Fiction's biggest
names.
Sure, it's a little bit bal
lyhooed. You know they
exaggerate a little when they
call it a "unique work of the
imagination that has opened
unforeseen new horizons." I
just hope that's the publisher's
fault.
Revelation
Because the stories them
selves are a revelation. In many

ways they represent a depar
ture from the "cute" stories
that seem to pop up in Analog
and other Science Fiction
magazines.
"Single changes" is a good
example of well-written, tight
prose. None of the three
pieces featured here could be
considered to be a short story,
in a normal sense, for they are
more like settings then stories;
but as part of a workshopping
effort, it's very easy to see how
they might fit in as jumping-off
points for a real story.
The three pieces, written by
David Grigg, Pip Maddern and
Barbara j. Coleman (all of
whom I will egotistically assert
are very promising young writ
ers) are short and witty. None
of them is more than three
pages long. Each focuses on
one simple departure from re
ality as we perceive it — and
spins that charge into an in
teresting vignette.
What if . ..
In a sense, these "single
changes" capsulize the raison
d'etre of science fiction, that
quantum leap away from real
ity to a realm that is not quite
pure fantasy. What if. . .?
The love stories are another
matter, for they blur the dis
tinction between science fic
tion and "ordinary" fiction.
The themes are the same, the
people as cruel or human/
inhuman as they have always
been. Of the six presented, I
found David Grigg's "Islands"
the most conventional. Take
away the asteroids and the
Russian names and it could
have been from Reader's Di
gest.
Morbid humor
On the other hand, some of
the others were truly diver
gent. Bruce Gillespie's "Veget
able Love" barely merited the
love story category — sexually
tuned mosses and protop
lasms, especially with the tone
given by Gillespie, qualify
more as morbid humor.
John Edward Clark's "Emily,

My Emily," on superficial read
ing, seems conventional, but
there's a certain deranged lilt
to the story that makes your
hair stand on end. Vou might
wonder what is at all conven
tional about a man in a lifeboat
with a life-size inflatable doll
(complete with instructions),
but the distinguishing touch
which Clark adds is a subtle
one.

Most impressive is Randal
Flynn's "Down toward the
Sun," a story about two clones
of the same man: one male,
one female. Flynn provides us
with a surprisingly moving
love/hate relationship — a
love/hate relationship with
oneself. The implications of
total self-love are frightening.
"We'll always be alone," the
clone says, and the thought,
unfortunately, causes reverb
erations of loneliness.
The volume also includes
stories using a literary device
we don't see much of these
days — dialogue. Bruce
Barnes' "After the Wreck of the
Stellar Queen" is an all-too
obvious and disappointing
employment of this form.
Barnes fails to explore the pos
sibilities of his story, and is
satisfied to present a trite story
in a slightly different way.
Reading this piece is like listen
ing to both sides of a Bob
Newhart telephone conversa
tion — you know too much,
and when you get to the punch
line, you ask yourself "is that
alir

In striking contrast, Andrew
Whitmore's "Process" grips
the reader as an imaginative
use of dialogue. Whitmore's
main character is a nebulous
female manipulator, whose
goals are but dimly revealed in
a chilling exchange with an un
named protege. It is dialogue
stripped bare. I must admit I'm
not sure what it means, but
that's not the point. What I did
know when I read it was that I
was scared.
Insight
The Altered I is more than
just a collection of short
stories. It's in sightintotheway
stories are written and that's
something anyone can benefit
from. As Randal Flynn admits,
in one of his comments, "Sor
cery, you see, is a hard busi
ness. Done with half a heart it
produces a lot of smoke and
egg gas. Done seriously, and
with honest spells, there is a
shadowy hope of creating a liv
ing prism. This is a story; a
magic, a masterpiece. But it
isn't always easy. The spells
have to be learned, the amal
gams acquired. This requires
luck, knack or a workshop.
Which shows you magic in ac
tion and may make you into an
arch-mage or something. But it
is still hard work."
Good writing is hard work.
And in this case, it is much ap
preciated.

The Harrad Experiment
Robert H. Rimmer
Bantam Press
253 pg. $1.95
For many of us college students, sex is still a
hard commodity to come by. Although we are
living in the midst of the Sexual Revolution, we
still have a hard time winning the relatively small
battles of getting to know members of the oppo
site sex.
If we had been college students in the '60s, we
probably would have read The Harrad Experi
ment to quench our sexual appetites. Proc
laimed as the "sex manifesto of the free love
generation," The Harrad Experiment (first pub
lished in 1966) became a sensational and con
troversial bestseller almost overnight.
Recently, a revised version of Robert Rim
mer's fiction was released which includes a spe
cial afterword on the sexual patterns of today s
youth. But whereas The Harrad Experiment may
have appealed to the vast sexual imaginations of
college students in the '60s, today it seems out
dated, if not comic.
Harrad College is a small "bootleg'' school
located somewhere near Boston. But Harrad is
unlike any other school in the country. At Har
rad men and women live and sleep together, in
an "atmosphere of controlled sexual freedom."
This "microcosmic society" is "designed to
achieve sexual sanity" by replacing people's
sexual repressions with a "new sexual ethic and
moral code."
« Sex
Rimmer, however, gets a little carried away
and makes some rather silly statements about
sex and human destiny. (In fact Rimmer de
scribes himself as a writer who thinks he can
move the world.) The book turns into an odd
combination of lofty idealism and pure pornog
raphy. But it is the pornography, and not the
idealism which makes the novel readable.

Following the story line again, the Harrad stu
dents soon graduate to communal sex and make
a habit out of swapping partners. At one point, a
group of students go to the beach for the
weekend. Harry, whose roommate is Beth,
spends the night with Valerie, whose roommate
is Jack. I'll let Rimmer take over from here: "I
(Harry) awoke with the sun a red crescent on the
horizon . . . Val was holding my penis lightly
half asleep herself. Our climax was sleepy,
sweet and hungrily joyful. I was asleep again in
her arms when Stanley yeiled, 'Come on, all you
young lovers. Last one in the ocean is custard
the dragon.' "
Pornography
But the pornography is precisely the problem
with Rimmer's book. Whereas in the '60s,
hard-up college students had to buy books like
The Harrad Experiment and use their imagina
tions, today we no longer need to use our im
aginations. The Sexual Revolution, although it
may not have taught us how to get sex, has
presented us with explicit pornographic scenes
in movies, on stage, and occasionally, if we are
lucky, in our own bedrooms. We no longer have
to read about what it is like having sex with a
gorgeous blond or brunette, we can go down to
the local movie theater and see it for ourselves.
So next time you feel the urge coming on
rather than going out and buying The Harrad
Experiment, buy yourself a ticket to see Sonia
Braga's latest picture, Donna Flor and Her Two
Husbands orSteveTracy in Beneath the Valley of
the Ultravixens; or better yet, go out and get
yourself a piece of the real thing.

With science fiction, there's

K. LeGuin, don't fall into either
of these traps. Reading these
stories reminds you that, after
all, science fiction is still writ
ing.
Honesty
One thing strikes you im
mediately as you read this
book. It is almost brutally frank
and open, devoid of pretenti
ousness. The writers include
both thoughts and commen
tary on how they felt and cried
during the attempts to write.
There's no feeling of insincer
ity or contrivance in their
notes; just honest effort.
And it works. The stories
have feeling, because you
know the writers felt as they
wrote. The stories are clever
without being sterile.
It's scary how you get drawn
into the sense of where they
are. Imagine being trapped
somewhere in the "remote
Dandenong Range of Au
stralia," writingyour brains out
under the tutelage of one of
Science Fiction's biggest
names.
Sure, it's a little bit bal
lyhooed. You know they
exaggerate a little when they
call it a "unique work of the
imagination that has opened
unforeseen new horizons." I
just hope that's the publisher's
fault.
Revelation
Because the stories them
selves are a revelation. In many

ways they represent a depar
ture from the "cute" stories
that seem to pop up in Analog
and other Science Fiction
magazines.
"Single changes" is a good
example of well-written, tight
prose. None of the three
pieces featured here could be
considered to be a short story,
in a normal sense, for they are
more like settings then stories;
but as part of a workshopping
effort, it's very easy to see how
they might fit in as jumping-off
points for a real story.
The three pieces, written by
David Grigg, Pip Maddern and
Barbara j. Coleman (all of
whom I will egotistically assert
are very promising young writ
ers) are short and witty. None
of them is more than three
pages long. Each focuses on
one simple departure from re
ality as we perceive it — and
spins that charge into an in
teresting vignette.
What if . ..
In a sense, these "single
changes" capsulize the raison
d'etre of science fiction, that
quantum leap away from real
ity to a realm that is not quite
pure fantasy. What if. . .?
The love stories are another
matter, for they blur the dis
tinction between science fic
tion and "ordinary" fiction.
The themes are the same, the
people as cruel or human/
inhuman as they have always
been. Of the six presented, I
found David Grigg's "Islands"
the most conventional. Take
away the asteroids and the
Russian names and it could
have been from Reader's Di
gest.
Morbid humor
On the other hand, some of
the others were truly diver
gent. Bruce Gillespie's "Veget
able Love" barely merited the
love story category — sexually
tuned mosses and protop
lasms, especially with the tone
given by Gillespie, qualify
more as morbid humor.
John Edward Clark's "Emily,

My Emily," on superficial read
ing, seems conventional, but
there's a certain deranged lilt
to the story that makes your
hair stand on end. Vou might
wonder what is at all conven
tional about a man in a lifeboat
with a life-size inflatable doll
(complete with instructions),
but the distinguishing touch
which Clark adds is a subtle
one.

Most impressive is Randal
Flynn's "Down toward the
Sun," a story about two clones
of the same man: one male,
one female. Flynn provides us
with a surprisingly moving
love/hate relationship — a
love/hate relationship with
oneself. The implications of
total self-love are frightening.
"We'll always be alone," the
clone says, and the thought,
unfortunately, causes reverb
erations of loneliness.
The volume also includes
stories using a literary device
we don't see much of these
days — dialogue. Bruce
Barnes' "After the Wreck of the
Stellar Queen" is an all-too
obvious and disappointing
employment of this form.
Barnes fails to explore the pos
sibilities of his story, and is
satisfied to present a trite story
in a slightly different way.
Reading this piece is like listen
ing to both sides of a Bob
Newhart telephone conversa
tion — you know too much,
and when you get to the punch
line, you ask yourself "is that
alir

In striking contrast, Andrew
Whitmore's "Process" grips
the reader as an imaginative
use of dialogue. Whitmore's
main character is a nebulous
female manipulator, whose
goals are but dimly revealed in
a chilling exchange with an un
named protege. It is dialogue
stripped bare. I must admit I'm
not sure what it means, but
that's not the point. What I did
know when I read it was that I
was scared.
Insight
The Altered I is more than
just a collection of short
stories. It's in sightintotheway
stories are written and that's
something anyone can benefit
from. As Randal Flynn admits,
in one of his comments, "Sor
cery, you see, is a hard busi
ness. Done with half a heart it
produces a lot of smoke and
egg gas. Done seriously, and
with honest spells, there is a
shadowy hope of creating a liv
ing prism. This is a story; a
magic, a masterpiece. But it
isn't always easy. The spells
have to be learned, the amal
gams acquired. This requires
luck, knack or a workshop.
Which shows you magic in ac
tion and may make you into an
arch-mage or something. But it
is still hard work."
Good writing is hard work.
And in this case, it is much ap

The Harrad Experiment
Robert H. Rimmer
Bantam Press
253 pg. $1.95
For many of us college students, sex is still a
hard commodity to come by. Although we are
living in the midst of the Sexual Revolution, we
still have a hard time winning the relatively small
battles of getting to know members of the oppo
site sex.
If we had been college students in the '60s, we
probably would have read The Harrad Experi
ment to quench our sexual appetites. Proc
laimed as the "sex manifesto of the free love
generation," The Harrad Experiment (first pub
lished in 1966) became a sensational and con
troversial bestseller almost overnight.
Recently, a revised version of Robert Rim
mer's fiction was released which includes a spe
cial afterword on the sexual patterns of today s
youth. But whereas The Harrad Experiment may
have appealed to the vast sexual imaginations of
college students in the '60s, today it seems out
dated, if not comic.
Harrad College is a small "bootleg'' school
located somewhere near Boston. But Harrad is
unlike any other school in the country. At Har
rad men and women live and sleep together, in
an "atmosphere of controlled sexual freedom."
This "microcosmic society" is "designed to
achieve sexual sanity" by replacing people's
sexual repressions with a "new sexual ethic and
moral code."
« Sex
Rimmer, however, gets a little carried away
and makes some rather silly statements about
sex and human destiny. (In fact Rimmer de
scribes himself as a writer who thinks he can
move the world.) The book turns into an odd
combination of lofty idealism and pure pornog
raphy. But it is the pornography, and not the
idealism which makes the novel readable.

Following the story line again, the Harrad stu
dents soon graduate to communal sex and make
a habit out of swapping partners. At one point, a
group of students go to the beach for the
weekend. Harry, whose roommate is Beth,
spends the night with Valerie, whose roommate
is Jack. I'll let Rimmer take over from here: "I
(Harry) awoke with the sun a red crescent on the
horizon . . . Val was holding my penis lightly
half asleep herself. Our climax was sleepy,
sweet and hungrily joyful. I was asleep again in
her arms when Stanley yeiled, 'Come on, all you
young lovers. Last one in the ocean is custard
the dragon.' "
Pornography
But the pornography is precisely the problem
with Rimmer's book. Whereas in the '60s,
hard-up college students had to buy books like
The Harrad Experiment and use their imagina
tions, today we no longer need to use our im
aginations. The Sexual Revolution, although it
may not have taught us how to get sex, has
presented us with explicit pornographic scenes
in movies, on stage, and occasionally, if we are
lucky, in our own bedrooms. We no longer have
to read about what it is like having sex with a
gorgeous blond or brunette, we can go down to
the local movie theater and see it for ourselves.
So next time you feel the urge coming on
rather than going out and buying The Harrad
Experiment, buy yourself a ticket to see Sonia
Braga's latest picture, Donna Flor and Her Two
Husbands orSteveTracy in Beneath the Valley of
the Ultravixens; or better yet, go out and get
yourself a piece of the real thing.

With science fiction, there's
no telling what's going to hap
pen. Unpredictability is its
strongest suit. With one stroke
disbelief can be suspended in
midair, in direct defiance of
gravity. It doesn't matter what
you thought before. You're in
another world — almost.
I say almost because some
times writers forget. Some
times writers forget they write
for human audiences, not for
computer-programmed an
droids who respect only ra
tionality. All too often science
fiction becomes a mass of
clever ideas admirable only as a
tribute to human intelligence.
Or at another extreme science
fiction becomes a morass of
alien sunsets and planetfalls
which bear as little re
semblance to anything in our
sensibilities as the musings of
an ant.

during the attempts to write.
There's no feeling of insincer
ity or contrivance in their
notes; just honest effort.
And it works. The stories
have feeling, because you
know the writers felt as they
wrote. The stories are clever
without being sterile.
It's scary how you get drawn
into the sense of where they
are. Imagine being trapped
somewhere in the "remote
Dandenong Range of Au
stralia," writingyour brains out
under the tutelage of one of
Science Fiction's biggest
names.
Sure, it's a little bit bal
lyhooed. You know they
exaggerate a little when they
call it a "unique work of the
imagination that has opened
unforeseen new horizons." I
just hope that's the publisher's
fault.
Revelation
Because the stories them
selves are a revelation. In many

ways they represent a depar
ture from the "cute" stories
that seem to pop up in Analog
and other Science Fiction
magazines.
"Single changes" is a good
example of well-written, tight
prose. None of the three
pieces featured here could be
considered to be a short story,
in a normal sense, for they are
more like settings then stories;
but as part of a workshopping
effort, it's very easy to see how
they might fit in as jumping-off
points for a real story.
The three pieces, written by
David Grigg, Pip Maddern and
Barbara j. Coleman (all of
whom I will egotistically assert
are very promising young writ
ers) are short and witty. None
of them is more than three
pages long. Each focuses on
one simple departure from re
ality as we perceive it — and
spins that charge into an in
teresting vignette.
What if . ..
In a sense, these "single
changes" capsulize the raison
d'etre of science fiction, that
quantum leap away from real
ity to a realm that is not quite
pure fantasy. What if. . .?
The love stories are another
matter, for they blur the dis
tinction between science fic
tion and "ordinary" fiction.
The themes are the same, the
people as cruel or human/
inhuman as they have always
been. Of the six presented, I
found David Grigg's "Islands"
the most conventional. Take
away the asteroids and the
Russian names and it could
have been from Reader's Di
gest.
Morbid humor
On the other hand, some of
the others were truly diver
gent. Bruce Gillespie's "Veget
able Love" barely merited the
love story category — sexually
tuned mosses and protop
lasms, especially with the tone
given by Gillespie, qualify
more as morbid humor.
John Edward Clark's "Emily,

My Emily," on superficial read
ing, seems conventional, but
there's a certain deranged lilt
to the story that makes your
hair stand on end. Vou might
wonder what is at all conven
tional about a man in a lifeboat
with a life-size inflatable doll
(complete with instructions),
but the distinguishing touch
which Clark adds is a subtle
one.

Most impressive is Randal
Flynn's "Down toward the
Sun," a story about two clones
of the same man: one male,
one female. Flynn provides us
with a surprisingly moving
love/hate relationship — a
love/hate relationship with
oneself. The implications of
total self-love are frightening.
"We'll always be alone," the
clone says, and the thought,
unfortunately, causes reverb
erations of loneliness.
The volume also includes
stories using a literary device
we don't see much of these
days — dialogue. Bruce
Barnes' "After the Wreck of the
Stellar Queen" is an all-too
obvious and disappointing
employment of this form.
Barnes fails to explore the pos
sibilities of his story, and is
satisfied to present a trite story
in a slightly different way.
Reading this piece is like listen
ing to both sides of a Bob
Newhart telephone conversa
tion — you know too much,
and when you get to the punch
line, you ask yourself "is that
alir

In striking contrast, Andrew
Whitmore's "Process" grips
the reader as an imaginative
use of dialogue. Whitmore's
main character is a nebulous
female manipulator, whose
goals are but dimly revealed in
a chilling exchange with an un
named protege. It is dialogue
stripped bare. I must admit I'm
not sure what it means, but
that's not the point. What I did
know when I read it was that I
was scared.
Insight
The Altered I is more than
just a collection of short
stories. It's in sightintotheway
stories are written and that's
something anyone can benefit
from. As Randal Flynn admits,
in one of his comments, "Sor
cery, you see, is a hard busi
ness. Done with half a heart it
produces a lot of smoke and
egg gas. Done seriously, and
with honest spells, there is a
shadowy hope of creating a liv
ing prism. This is a story; a
magic, a masterpiece. But it
isn't always easy. The spells
have to be learned, the amal
gams acquired. This requires
luck, knack or a workshop.
Which shows you magic in ac
tion and may make you into an
arch-mage or something. But it
is still hard work."
Good writing is hard work.
And in this case, it is much ap
preciated.

The Harrad Experiment
Robert H. Rimmer
Bantam Press
253 pg. $1.95
For many of us college students, sex is still a
hard commodity to come by. Although we are
living in the midst of the Sexual Revolution, we
still have a hard time winning the relatively small
battles of getting to know members of the oppo
site sex.
If we had been college students in the '60s, we
probably would have read The Harrad Experi
ment to quench our sexual appetites. Proc
laimed as the "sex manifesto of the free love
generation," The Harrad Experiment (first pub
lished in 1966) became a sensational and con
troversial bestseller almost overnight.
Recently, a revised version of Robert Rim
mer's fiction was released which includes a spe
cial afterword on the sexual patterns of today s
youth. But whereas The Harrad Experiment may
have appealed to the vast sexual imaginations of
college students in the '60s, today it seems out
dated, if not comic.
Harrad College is a small "bootleg'' school
located somewhere near Boston. But Harrad is
unlike any other school in the country. At Har
rad men and women live and sleep together, in
an "atmosphere of controlled sexual freedom."
This "microcosmic society" is "designed to
achieve sexual sanity" by replacing people's
sexual repressions with a "new sexual ethic and
moral code."
« Sex
Rimmer, however, gets a little carried away
and makes some rather silly statements about
sex and human destiny. (In fact Rimmer de
scribes himself as a writer who thinks he can
move the world.) The book turns into an odd
combination of lofty idealism and pure pornog
raphy. But it is the pornography, and not the
idealism which makes the novel readable.

Following the story line again, the Harrad stu
dents soon graduate to communal sex and make
a habit out of swapping partners. At one point, a
group of students go to the beach for the
weekend. Harry, whose roommate is Beth,
spends the night with Valerie, whose roommate
is Jack. I'll let Rimmer take over from here: "I
(Harry) awoke with the sun a red crescent on the
horizon . . . Val was holding my penis lightly
half asleep herself. Our climax was sleepy,
sweet and hungrily joyful. I was asleep again in
her arms when Stanley yeiled, 'Come on, all you
young lovers. Last one in the ocean is custard
the dragon.' "
Pornography
But the pornography is precisely the problem
with Rimmer's book. Whereas in the '60s,
hard-up college students had to buy books like
The Harrad Experiment and use their imagina
tions, today we no longer need to use our im
aginations. The Sexual Revolution, although it
may not have taught us how to get sex, has
presented us with explicit pornographic scenes
in movies, on stage, and occasionally, if we are
lucky, in our own bedrooms. We no longer have
to read about what it is like having sex with a
gorgeous blond or brunette, we can go down to
the local movie theater and see it for ourselves.
So next time you feel the urge coming on
rather than going out and buying The Harrad
Experiment, buy yourself a ticket to see Sonia
Braga's latest picture, Donna Flor and Her Two
Husbands orSteveTracy in Beneath the Valley of
the Ultravixens; or better yet, go out and get
yourself a piece of the real thing.
