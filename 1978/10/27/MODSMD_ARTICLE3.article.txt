# ASSU Senate delays picking chairperson
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
By a narrow margin, the ASSU Se
nate postponed electing a chairper
son in their meeting last night in
order to give senators more time to
consider candidates for the job.
The senate will reconvene in spe
cial session this Tuesday at 9 p.m. for
the purpose of electing a new chair
person.
Three were nominated for the
position, but two declined. Fred
Crethel, chairperson of last year's
senate, refused to run because he
felt he should serve only if it was the
"consensus of the senate." After a

15-minute period of informal discus
sion following the nominations,
Crethel withdrew from the race.
Mike Wilkins also declined his
nomination.
Junior Peter Stamos was nomi
nated by Sen. Alex Alben, who said
he would serve as "moderating
force" for the senate. Stamos ac
cepted, but said he felt the election
should be delayed if the senate as a
whole did not feel comfortable vot
ing for a single candidate who all the
senators do not know.
The ASSU Constitution does not
require the Senate chairperson to be
a full senator. This is often the case,

as with Crethel last year.
One of the chairperson's duties is
appointing members to senate
committees. Already eight bills have
been referred to three committees
which do not yet exist. Stamos said
he is confident that once the chair
person is elected, he or she will be
able to have all the committees in
operation before the next regular
meeting in two weeks.
In other business, the senate ap
proved the elections commissioner's
report, finalizing the vote tallies and
certifying themselves as official
senators.
The first alternate undergraduate
senator, Erik Thompson, became a
senator, filling the spot previously
held by Caryn Jacobs. Jacobs is in
Tours, France, this quarter and was
fraudulently put on the ballot by a
group of friends without her know
ledge.
Elections Commissioner Will
Nixon declared Jacobs' 300-some
votes void. Jacobs had adamantly ex
pressed her desire not to serve.
Nixon also discussed the problems
his commission had had trying to get
enough graduate students on the
ballot. Only seven had filed petitions
by the original deadline, and so, ac
cording to last year's precedent,
Nixon extended it.
After the extended filing period
was closed, several candidates with
drew, forcing Nixon to extend the
deadline again. Finally, the day be
fore the election, the required
number of 10 candidates had filed.
Nixon said that while the ASSU by
laws require filing deadlines to be
strictly enforced, the constitution
requires there be at least 10 graduate

senators elected. The constitution
takes precedence when the two con
tradict, but Nixon recommended
that the by-laws be changed to deal
with situations where not enough
candidates have filed by the dead
line.
"The real plague of tecent senates
has been low voter turnout," Nixon
said. He added that the most critical
problem with ASSU elections is that
"nobody ever votes in them."
