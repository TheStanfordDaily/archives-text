If you are anything like me, the name San

Six pieces were performed, two ( ,if>ri( e and
Time After, choreographed by Penelope I agios
johnson. Caprice, described by Ihe program as,
"a vignette from what is meant to bee ome a full
length work" was indeed rather short and iso
lated . Time After, however, was the highlight of
the evening. It portrays the bereavement of a

father and daughter after the death of the
mother. Johnson employs an interesting device
to introduce a flash back when the mother folds
up the flowing sleeves of her dress to symbolize
when she was alive.
Johnson's choreography is well-conceived,
but at times her metaphors are a bit obvious or
trite. For instance, in Time After the daughter's
grief is expressed through reaching her arms
upward or cradling her head in her hands.
Leda Meredith, a promising young dancer,
does a creditable job in both these pieces,
which will be repeated in next week's program.

Mask Dance, choreographed by Carol Thaler,
was somewhat disjointed. At intervals the danc

backdrop. The mixing of media and the appa
rent lack of a unifying theme made the whole
piece confusing.
Recuerdos by Alan Scofield is a lively ballet
piece with a Spanish flair. Ascended Spirit, a
sexually oriented pas de deux, was danced by
Juliana Sakowsky and John Sullivan. Its effect
was marred by the affectations of Sakowsky's
arms and hands, but the dramatic quality of the
piece was as good as in Time After. The evening
ended pleasantly with Concerto, choreog
raphed by Sharonjean Leeds. A modern piece, it
displays the potential of this company.

Six pieces were performed, two ( ,if>ri( e and
Time After, choreographed by Penelope I agios

"a vignette from what is meant to bee ome a full
length work" was indeed rather short and iso

the evening. It portrays the bereavement of a

father and daughter after the death of the
mother. Johnson employs an interesting device
to introduce a flash back when the mother folds
up the flowing sleeves of her dress to symbolize
when she was alive.
Johnson's choreography is well-conceived,
but at times her metaphors are a bit obvious or
trite. For instance, in Time After the daughter's
grief is expressed through reaching her arms
upward or cradling her head in her hands.

Mask Dance, choreographed by Carol Thaler,
was somewhat disjointed. At intervals the danc

Recuerdos by Alan Scofield is a lively ballet
piece with a Spanish flair. Ascended Spirit, a
sexually oriented pas de deux, was danced by
Juliana Sakowsky and John Sullivan. Its effect
was marred by the affectations of Sakowsky's
arms and hands, but the dramatic quality of the
piece was as good as in Time After. The evening
ended pleasantly with Concerto, choreog
raphed by Sharonjean Leeds. A modern piece, it
displays the potential of this company.
