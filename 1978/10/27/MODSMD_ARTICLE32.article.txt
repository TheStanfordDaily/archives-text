I Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
* this is a very seductive piece of
7 filmmaking, helped immeasura
;;Z bly by its performers: Jane
4 Fonda, James Caan and Jason
i Robards, who plays the heavy
* with malicious joy.
—Jim Mattson
The Big Sleep
Friday, Kresge
Howard Hawks' "tough guy"
style fits this adaptation of the
Raymond Chandler novel per
fectly. Philip Marlowe, the hard
boiled private eye, is a piece-of
cake characterization for Hum
phrey Bogart, and the pairing of
Bogart with Lauren Bacall is
movie — and sexual — magic.
William Faulkner assisted
Chandler on the script. It's full of
fast-paced double entendres;
when they're spoken by Bogart
and Bacall, they become very
easy to understand. As they dis
cuss the characteristics of horse
racing here, you know precisely
what they're getting at. By the
end of the movie, you probably
K won't know just who did what to
K whom, but chances are you
won't care.

Smokey and the Bandit ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Movies like these are easy
targets for the "critics" who want
to show off their vocabulary of
flaming negative words. But re
ally, this Burt Reynolds profit
sharing venture is not such a bad
throwaway movie; it's expecta
tions are low, and it doesn't pre
tend to be anything more than 90
minutes of synthetic good ol' boy
fluff.
—R.L.
Young Frankenstein ★ ★★★
Saturday, Cubberley
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and vice versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wil
der wrote much of the
screenplay, and his performance
as Doctor Frankenstein begins to
remind you of Buster Keaton.
Brooks comes close to what can
be termed "good direction"
here; his use of black-and-white
photography is particularly in
spired. Marty Feldman provides
the perfect comic foil as Igor.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop out imprisoned in
'} Turkey for the possession of two

pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

Autumn Sonata ★★★ %
Surf, San Francisco
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmann give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
film about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating, because its lan
guage cannot to justice to either
the performances or to
Bergman's assured visual con
ception. But your frustration is,
finally, erased by joy. Even if In
gmar Bergman is not yet ready to
go all the way with a movie again,
his actresses are, and they take
the movie right to the limit, roar
ing through it like two great
ladies of the theater who haven't
lost their zest.
—R.L.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy 'what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo

graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
shctild keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.
The Boys from Brazil ★ ★
Coronet, San Francisco
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved

— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian

Somebody Killed
Her Husband ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar
ried to a man who's idea of a din
ner toast is to mumble "my first
today." Close friend Jeff Bridges
is a writer of children's books
who is unpublished for all the
right reasons. When the duo find
Farrah's husband stuck to a table
with a knife, they stash the
corpse in the refrigerator for
) want of anything better to do.
Even Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this half

baked non-mystery, and here the
blandness of the female lead and
the ineptness of director Lamont
Johnson combine to create an
entertainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.
—J.M.
The Cheap Detective ar
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PC-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Cilliatt,
summer movie critic for The Slew
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Coin' South -kit
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di
rector and star of the movie, jack
Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics.' Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-)ohn to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kindoffeelingmust
please some people, and while
Crease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.
—R.L.
Interiors ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharplv defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

Somebody Killed
Her Husband ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar
ried to a man who's idea of a din
ner toast is to mumble "my first

is a writer of children's books
who is unpublished for all the
right reasons. When the duo find
Farrah's husband stuck to a table
with a knife, they stash the
corpse in the refrigerator for
) want of anything better to do.
Even Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this half

Johnson combine to create an
entertainment that's doughy just

The Cheap Detective ar
Bijou
This movie, written by the

is often, to use one of the film's

summer movie critic for The Slew
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody

Coin' South -kit
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di
rector and star of the movie, jack
Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.

Animal House
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics.' Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-)ohn to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kindoffeelingmust
please some people, and while
Crease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Interiors ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family

sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharplv defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

The Big Sleep
Friday, Kresge
Howard Hawks' "tough guy"
style fits this adaptation of the
Raymond Chandler novel per

Bogart with Lauren Bacall is
movie — and sexual — magic.
William Faulkner assisted
Chandler on the script. It's full of
fast-paced double entendres;
when they're spoken by Bogart

easy to understand. As they dis

Saturday, Cubberley
Mel Brooks really needs Gene

the perfect comic foil as Igor.

the performances or to
Bergman's assured visual con

finally, erased by joy. Even if In

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.

It would have been really easy

great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis

Peter Ustinov plays Hercule

perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors

14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
shctild keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well

unusual projects and new

Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharplv defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

The Big Sleep
Friday, Kresge
Howard Hawks' "tough guy"
style fits this adaptation of the
Raymond Chandler novel per
fectly. Philip Marlowe, the hard
boiled private eye, is a piece-of
cake characterization for Hum
phrey Bogart, and the pairing of
Bogart with Lauren Bacall is
movie — and sexual — magic.
William Faulkner assisted
Chandler on the script. It's full of
fast-paced double entendres;
when they're spoken by Bogart
and Bacall, they become very
easy to understand. As they dis
cuss the characteristics of horse
racing here, you know precisely
what they're getting at. By the
end of the movie, you probably
K won't know just who did what to
K whom, but chances are you

Brooks comes close to what can

Autumn Sonata ★★★ %
Surf, San Francisco
Ingrid Bergman and Liv

film about a parent-child rela

very frustrating, because its lan
guage cannot to justice to either

finally, erased by joy. Even if In

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub

script fails them.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair

on a semi-classy 'what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides

A solid mystery, nicely photo

perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
shctild keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well

unusual projects and new

The Boys from Brazil ★ ★
Coronet, San Francisco
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved

— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian

Somebody Killed
Her Husband ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar
ried to a man who's idea of a din
ner toast is to mumble "my first
today." Close friend Jeff Bridges
is a writer of children's books
who is unpublished for all the
right reasons. When the duo find
Farrah's husband stuck to a table
with a knife, they stash the
corpse in the refrigerator for
) want of anything better to do.
Even Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this half

baked non-mystery, and here the
blandness of the female lead and
the ineptness of director Lamont
Johnson combine to create an
entertainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.
—J.M.
The Cheap Detective ar
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PC-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Cilliatt,
summer movie critic for The Slew
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.
—R.L.
Coin' South -kit
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di
rector and star of the movie, jack
Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics.' Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-)ohn to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kindoffeelingmust
please some people, and while
Crease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Interiors ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

And at certain moments, such as

Somebody Killed

Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar

Coin' South is a relentlessly

Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges

though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and

Nicholson has thousands of act

Animal House
Old Mill

and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white

frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject

As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one

whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog

17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia

Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head

please some people, and while
Crease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Interiors ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
Woody Allen deserves high

sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In

there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his

While A Wedding often exhibits

to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharplv defined charac

dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father

former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support

script fails them.

Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father

great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis

14 million dollars to a different

The Boys from Brazil ★ ★

While I suppose that it is quite

but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved

— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless

Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar

is a writer of children's books
who is unpublished for all the
right reasons. When the duo find
Farrah's husband stuck to a table
with a knife, they stash the
corpse in the refrigerator for

Even Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this half

blandness of the female lead and
the ineptness of director Lamont
Johnson combine to create an
entertainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be

The Cheap Detective ar
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's

euphamisms, a "piece of

summer movie critic for The Slew
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody

Coin' South -kit
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di

Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog

running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-)ohn to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kindoffeelingmust
please some people, and while
Crease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.

level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.

Death on the Nile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the
patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo

graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
shctild keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.

The Boys from Brazil ★ ★
Coronet, San Francisco
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way. The worst
dampener is that you never really
get close enough to go involved

— the movie keeps its distance.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away. After a while you feel so
damn neutral, watching the film
that it begins to unnerve you.
The movie needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian

Somebody Killed
Her Husband ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Farrah Fawcett-Majors is mar
ried to a man who's idea of a din
ner toast is to mumble "my first
today." Close friend Jeff Bridges
is a writer of children's books
who is unpublished for all the
right reasons. When the duo find
Farrah's husband stuck to a table
with a knife, they stash the
corpse in the refrigerator for
) want of anything better to do.
Even Hitchcock would have had
trouble adding style to this half

baked non-mystery, and here the
blandness of the female lead and
the ineptness of director Lamont
Johnson combine to create an
entertainment that's doughy just
when it's trying hardest to be
light.

The Cheap Detective ar
Bijou
This movie, written by the
agonizingly prolific Neil Simon,
is often, to use one of the film's
maddening PC-rated
euphamisms, a "piece of
doodoo." Penelope Cilliatt,
summer movie critic for The Slew
Yorker, praised Simon for having
"rather an acute understanding
of middle-class America." But
this is precisely what Neil Simon
does not have, and it is this lack
of understanding that makes this
witless parody of '40s detective
(and Bogart) movies all the more
empty. Playing with Somebody
Killed Her Husband.

Coin' South -kit
Old Mill
Coin' South is a relentlessly
endearing movie, and it dies in its
own charm and cuteness. The di
rector and star of the movie, jack
Nicholson, has admitted that he
wanted to make a romantic fan
tasy like those of Preston Sturges
and Ernst Lubitsch. And even
though Nicholson and his movie
often are working unerringly in
this form, it appears that they are
holding themselves back to get
there. Coin' South's restraint and
balance are very frustrating;
Nicholson has thousands of act
ing moves which never surface
here, and the movie is so con
cerned with being pleasant that it
kills all of the material's potential
excitement.
—R.L.
Animal House
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

Crease ★
Old Mill
If there is such a thing, Robert
Stigwood must be "Mr. Demog
raphics.' Add the fact that 11 to
17 year olds see more than their
fair share of movies to a long
running play, throw in some
Happy Days '50s nostalgia, get
John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-)ohn to star, and you get
Crease, which Stigwood pro
duced in association with Allan
Carr. Crease is fairly inoffensive,
and I suppose that it is possible to
have a very good time at it. But
can't we demand a little bit better
than this kind of calculated enter
tainment, presold like one would
sell Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
Crease has an astounding
amount of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. The movie
also has Dolby sound, so while
watching Crease, I felt like a
3-year-old kid with a kaleidos
cope equipped with head
phones. That kindoffeelingmust
please some people, and while
Crease is hardly a good movie,
sensations like that help to make
it the ultimate in pacifiers.
—R.L.
Interiors ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished
form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharplv defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.
—R.L.
