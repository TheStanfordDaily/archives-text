## 'Schweik' simple minded 
### 
The Cood Soldier Schweik is
basically a simple-minded
political statement, and a chil
dish look at authority. One
meets, in the course of hero
Schweik's picaresque adven
tures, a stereotypical, vain au
tocratic lieutenant who
swishes around with a long
cigarette holder and terribly
British accent, a large hairy
peasant who has to be, by the
laws of cheap theatrical con
vention, entirely benevolent
and stupid, several peasant
women willing to sleep with
any man who stumbles into
their barn, a blind old farmer, a
plucky Cockney lad and finally
Schweik himself, the most in
sulting stereotype of all. When
have so many tired old two
dimensional characters con
verged on one pitiable stage?
The Czech playwright, Jaros
lav Hasek firmly employs his in
tolerance in the admirable
causes of peace and equality.
He bends over backwards to
convince the audience that war
is really a nasty business and
many people get killed in the
conducting of one. True, war
brings out the .worst in
everyone, from bisexual British
lieutenants to low-grade sol
diers like Schweik. As a conso
lation, Hasek offers the simple
joys of Czech urban life as a
more agreeable state of exis
tence. While teaching us about
war at this sophisticated level,
The Cood Soldier Schweik of
fers some of the most slapstick
visual gags since the Three
Stooges, concentrating on
sexist jokes, booze and
enemas.
Recruits
The play begins as an incred
ibly evil ramrod-straight Aust
rian bureaucrat suspiciously
noses around in poor old
loseph Schweik's favorite
warm-hearted Czech eatin
ghouse. He is looking for re
cruits to fight for Austria in
WWI. Schweik, knowing the

man is from the government,
tells a joke about flies shitting
on the Emperor's portrait, and
so off he goes, first to jail, then
into the army. The play goes
downhill from this tense and
eloquent opening, as Schweik
becomes one officer's adjutant
"swine," another's "idiot,"
and so on until the war ends,
for the common good, and
Schweik goes back to his beer
parlor, to resume his pre-war
occupation of dog-thief.
Local wit
There might be a spark of a
good idea in the Schweik story.
A local wit, as Schweik could
be described, gets drafted into
another country's war, discov
ers that a system of very ag
gressive mock-cooperation
with the authorities can keep
him away from the front for a
while, he eventually goes to
the front, but returns home to
philosophize upon the experi
ence. Unfortunately, Hasek
can offer no original or percep
tive perspectives on this
theme. He creates, by way of a
diversion, Schweik himself.
Schweik's stoicism and
long-suffering looks come ac
ross distinctly ethnic. Whether
or not Hasek wrote the part for
a gross stereotype he comes
out one in the production at
the Popular Theater. Schweik
is not psychologically alive on
stage. He never has an emotion
or line which isn't exaggerated
and within the narrow confines
of his established buffoon's
character. And, Joe Bellan does
not have the stage presence to
carry off the shadowy bit of flat
character which Schweik can
humbly call his own.
Interesting concepts
Director Dennis Moyer's
production of Schweik con
tains interesting concepts, but
like the play itself, they never
develop theatrically. The stark
black stage, hung with large
sheets, was visually intriguing
at first, but Moyer didn't make

clear, within this space, how
abstract or realistic a view of
reality he was dealing with. Too
often the (inadequate) cast rat
tled around in the inky void as
if they lacked orientation as
much as the audience. Dave
Ceiser provided some fascinat
ing cartoon figures and ani
mated segments which Moyer
neglected to incorporate into
the play in a meaningful way.
Moyer allowed the picaresque
tales of Schweik-at-war to drag
themselves out toward an un
certain conclusion, without
providing any sense of pur
pose to guide the action. To
create an effect of pur
poselessness, one does not di
rect without purpose.
Despite flashes of wit and
even humor, most of The Cood
Soldier Schweik is seltzer
bottle, vaudeville war humor
with some enticing European
flavor. Enjoying bigoted con
ceptions of man and stupid
ideas about politics, even
when its all pushing for the
"right" side, proves impossi
ble.
