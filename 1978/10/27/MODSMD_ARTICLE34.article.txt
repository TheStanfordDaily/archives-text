Israel to expand settlements
Tel Aviv — A defiant Israeli govern
ment, angered by U.S. statements on the
Palestinian issue and trying to cool political
dissent at home, disclosed plans yesterday
to expand its settlements on the West Bank
of the Jordan River. The move could raise a
major new obstacle in the Israeli-Egyptian
peace talks.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance reacted
quickly and sharply to the unexpected Israeli
decision, issuing a statement in Washington
saying the Carter administration was
"deeply disturbed" by the action and calling
it a "very serious" matter.
The State Department said President
)immy Carter sent a personal cable to Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin on the sub
ject.
The Israeli Cabinet voted Wednesday to
spend the equivalent of about $15 million to
build a reservoirand new housing in existing
Israeli settlements on the West Bank.
Foreign Minister Mosha Dayan defended
the decision as consistent with Israeli policy
and within Israel's rights. Dayan said Israel
agreed at the Camp David summit only to
refrain from establishing new West Bankset
tlements during the current period of
negotiations with^gypt.
Dayan acknowledged, however, that ex
pansion of the settlements "may make it dif
ficult" to reach a final agreement with Egypt
on a treaty.
Army copters buzz commune
Nashville — The Army said yesterday it was
investigating why a squadron of its helicop

ter gunships flew low over a southern Ten
nessee commune for several minutes,
frightening many of its 1,100 residents.
Matthew McClure, a spokesman for the
1750-acre commune called The Farm, said
the olive-green camouflaged Cobra helicop
ters dropped out of a low cloud bank at
lunchtime Tuesday.
"They came in flying fast and low," he
said. "They split into three groups and they
flew down lower into the fields and hovered
over the fields. And then they went and ho
vered outside our houses for as long as five
minutes. They also hovered around our
school and around our office."
Somalian rebels executed
Nairobi, Kenya — Thousands of Somalians
watched as a firing squad executed 17 army
officers yesterday for their part in the unsuc
cessful attempt last-spring to overthrow
President Mohammed Siad Barre,
Mogadishu radio reported.
"The executions were carried out by a fir
ing squad formed by soldiers of the armed
forces and were witnessed by thousands of
people from all areas of Mogadishu," the
broadcast said.
The National Security Court convicted the
17 on Sept. 12 for "offenses against the un
ity, independence and sovereignty of the
state," the radio said.
The government has blamed "new im
peralists hostile to Somalia" for the April 9
coup attempt. "New imperalists" is the gov
ernment's label for the Soviet Union and
Cuba which helped Ethiopia defeat Somali
forces in the Ogaden war last summer.

Carter wants help on inflation
Nashville — President ]immy Carter,
making yet another campaign appearance
for Democrats yesterday, exhorted a huge
crowd to help make his new anti-inflation
program work and shouted "Right on" when
the audience cheered.
In his Nashville speech, Carter departed
briefly from his political themes to remind
the crowd of the newly announced anti
inflation program combining wage and price
guidelines with fiscal restraint.
Yesterday's trip was the seventh in a series
the president has made since Labor Day,
campaigning in what the White House views
as key Democratic races. The appearance
came less than 48 hours after Carter an
nounced his new anti-inflation program to
the nation.
Woman climbs El Capitan
Yosemite National Park — A woman de
scribed as "a super, super climber" reached
the summit of awesome El Capitan yesterday
to become the first woman ever to solo
climb the sheer 3,000 ft. high vertical wall.
A Yosemite National Park official de
scribed Beverly Johnson, 33, of Los
Angeles, as "safe and probably very tired"
after she finished her nine-day climb.
She reached the top at mid-afternoon and
was hiking down a back trail to Yosemite
Valley where reporters and rangers were
waiting for her.
Chief park ranger Bill Wendt, describing
the difficulty of the climb, said, "It's risky to
climb it with a dozen people. We had a triple
fatality May 14. All three came off."

"To do it solo is really quite a feat," Wendt
added. "So far as we know, Bev is the first
woman. I'm sure it's been done by a male
before. I'd be willing to bet more than one."
Brown blasts commission
Los Angeles — Governor jerry Brown yes
terday called the California Coastal Com
mission officials "bureaucratic thugs" for
their suggestion that Malibu residents may
only be able to rebuild fire-ravaged homes if
they make their private beaches public.
Brown also said he will ask President
|immy Carter today to designate Mandeville
Canyon and Agoura as federal disaster areas.
In a meeting with Mayor Tom Bradley and
city Fire Chief john Gerrard, Brown blasted
the Coastal Commission's recent suggestion
that Malibu residents may be required to
increase public access to their front-yard
private beaches before they rebuild.
"This is no time to play games and it's not
the time to act as bureaucratic thugs." He
said the statment by the Commission staff
member "may represent the high-water
level in excessive bureaucracy."
The Coastal Commission had cited a pro
vision of the 1976 Coastal Act, stating that
"public access from the nearest public
roadway to the shoreline and along the coast
shall be provided in new development."
