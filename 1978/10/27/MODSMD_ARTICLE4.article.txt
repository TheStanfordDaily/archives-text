# Committee considers landscaping for Quad
## 
### 
Landscaping of the Inner Quad is
being investigated by a committee
under the direction of Council of
Presidents member Mary
Moromoto.
The committee is researching the
possibilities of planting grass or
shrubs in the gravel areas of the
Quad.
"The Quad is one of the most
beautiful areas on campus. I would
just love to be able to sit on grass
there and enjoy the peace," said
committee member Chris Mills.
However, there are many obstruc
tions preventing the immediate
landscaping of the Quad, the
foremost of which is financing.
"A round ballpark figure for the
landscaping of the Quad would be a

quarter of a million dollars," said Di
rector of Planning Phil Williams.
The possibilities of raising these
funds right now are dim, since they
would have to be raised from outside
sources, he said.
The maintenance of grass in this
area would also be a problem, ac
cording to Mills.
The shade and heavy foot traffic in
the Quad would make grass difficult
to grow. Water from the sprinkler
system that would wet the sandstone
walls would turn them black, he said.
Pathways would also have to be left
in the grass to allow for service vehi
cle traffic, Mills added. "Bicycles can
not be excluded from the Quad,
either."
