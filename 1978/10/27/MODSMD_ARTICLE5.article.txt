# 'Flagrant disregard for people'
## Fonda blasts big corporations

"IT&T plants in Nazi Germany
manufactured the bombs dropped
on American soldiers in World War
11. After the war was over, IT&T got
$27 million from the American gov
ernment for damage done to its Nazi
plants," said Jane Fonda, actress and
political activist.
Fonda used this statement, made
at a rally sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and SCOPE yester
day, to substantiate her claim that
corporations operate with a "flagrant
disregard for the welfare of the
American people."
She told a crowd of nearly 1000 that
the "Fortune 500" corporations, the
top 500 corporations in the U.S., are
responsible for many of America's
problems.
These companies' control of the
economic arena affords them perva
sive political power, Fonda said.
"My husband, Tom Hayden, asked
President Carter how does it feel to
be in the highest elected office in this
country and have less political power
than corporate executives. Carter
answered, 'You know, I learned that
my first year in office,' " she said.
The Fortune 500 corporations con
trol the political process because
they can afford to spend millions of

dollars lobbying for legislation in
their interest, Fonda said.
"Federal regulatory agencies are
also controlled by corporations,"
she added. "Three hundred and fifty
of the officials working for these
agencies used to work for the indus
tries they are supposed to be regulat
ing."
According to Fonda, political and
economic power has enabled big
corporations to effectively cripple
small business. Multi-million dollar
advertising has an enormous influ
ence on consumer behavior, she
said. Small businesses are at a devas
tating disadvantage because they
cannot afford such advertising.
"The notion of free competition is
becoming obsolete," she claimed.
Fonda said large American corpo
rations have invaded other coun
tries. Major American corporations
have become multinational, main
taining a parent company in the U.S.
while setting up subsidiaries
throughout the world, she said.
The multinationals build factories
in countries where "slave labor" is
readily available, Fonda said. By
doing so, multinationals increase
their profit margins.
However, they also cause drastic
decreases in the number of jobs av
ailable here, thereby aggravating, if
not causing, the unemployment
problem, Fonda continued.
Citing an AFL-CIO report, Fonda
said, "one million jobs are going to
workers in foreign countries." She
added that the "tragic irony" of Viet
nam is that corporations paid no in
come tax on the profits earned from
labor there.
Fonda said this non-taxing scheme
"may be" excusable if corporations
were to use the tax-free profits to
lower prices for the American con
sumers. But because the multina
tionals monopolize their markets,

they can sell their products at what
ever price they want, she said.
High unemployment and simul
taneous inflationary prices have
created an economic crisis here,
Fonda said.
"Whenever there is an economic
crisis and a shrinking job market,
white males become extremely
threatened by white females and
blacks. This increases social ten
sion," she said.
According to Fonda, these ten
sions led to the fight for Proposition
13. Middle-class Americans couldn't
afford to support extensive welfare
programs any longer, she said.
"Proposition 13 marks the end of
New-Deal liberalism."
It also exposes for the bankruptcy
that it is the conservatives' solution
of boosting the economy by helping
big business, Fonda said.
Proposition 13 gave big business
$4.1 million in windfall profits, she
said. The Campaign for Economic
Democracy (CED), a political activist
group Fonda co-founded, surveyed
41 corporations, and found that they
were pocketing the profits, she said.
Fonda said grassroots organiza
tions are combating this injustice.
Since property taxes have been re
duced by 20 percent, landlords
should increase rent rates only if jus
tified by inflation or improvements,
she said. Los Angeles has passed rent
stabilization laws to allow tenants to
profit from Proposition 13, she ad
ded.
Fonda urged the crowd to vote
"yes" on Measure Fl, a proposal
which would institute rent stabiliza
tion in the area. She stressed the
need for broad-based political op
position of big business.
"We've come to the end of the age
of expansion," Fonda said. "The only
frontier left is to improve the quality
of life."

Some listeners to the Jane Fonda speech found a way to see the movie star/activist
without getting crushed in the crowd.
