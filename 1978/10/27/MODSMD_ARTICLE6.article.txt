# Costs here outstripping income
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Vice President and Provost William Miller said the
University is considering its response to the wage and
price guidelines announced by President Jimmy Carter,
in light of the fact that the University's costs are rising
faster than its contributions.
Miller made the announcement at a meeting ot the
Faculty Senate yesterday. He said the proposed re
straints on prices which may apply to tuition, room and
board are only one-half of one percent below the ex
pected rate of increase for prices fixed by the University.
He did not speculate as to the effect of the guidelines on
wages here. ... ...
Miller also told the senate that contributions to the
University increased from the previous year and that the
increase is larger than most universities experienced.
The contributions, however, constitute a smaller per
centage of the University budget than they did last year.
What this means, he explained, is that the University s
costs are rising faster than the contributions it receives.
Miller said the University, therefore, must redouble
its efforts to make the growth in contributions match the
rise in costs. .
In other senate actions, Physics Professor Alan
Schwettman, who chairs the senate's subcommittee on
Advising, said the group will soon be making recom

mendations to the senate concerning changes in the
advising system.
He said two considerations are important in the com
mittee's work. First, the committee wants to draft a prog
ram thatis realistic for the University. Second, it wants to
provide guidelines to let an adviser know when he has
fulfilled his obligations.
He said the two major student concerns were greater
accessibility of advisers and a request that advisers be
willing to make inquiries on the student's behalf.
Also at the meeting, the senate approved a five-year
extension of the Mathematical Sciences Program begin
ning in 1980.
Vice Provost and Dean of Research Gerald Lieberman
submitted a report for the Committee on Research. Two
issues to be dealt with by the committee in the future
involve the use of research facilities here by private
companies and the possible loss of research revenue
because of new government regulations.
The University has, in the past, allowed private com
panies limited use of research facilities here, and the
committee plans to evalate this policy.
New federal guidelines on recovering the indirect
costs of research could mean the University will lose as
much as $7.5 million this year. A general outcry from
researchers has forced the government to reconsider its
position, and a revised statement is due in a couple of
weeks.
