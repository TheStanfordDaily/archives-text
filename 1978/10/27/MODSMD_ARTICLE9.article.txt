What can the public do to ensure that the
Marguerites go on running at night and to Tre
sidder and the Med Center this year?
-K.T.
According to Bob Hamrdla, chairperson of the
Committee on Parking and Transportation, "the
public" should write letters to the committee
and address them to the Stanford Police De
partment.
The Marguerites currently run to both Tresid
der and the Med Center.
They do not run at night though, he said.
Carol Christiansen, secretary to the committee,
said the Marguerites run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30
p.m.
"There was an experimental run to midnight
last year," Hamrdla said.
A permanent night service is too expensive to
be funded right now, he added.
Hamrdla said, "The Marguerites are paid for
by the parking fund which is completely used
each year." The parking fund consists of the
money made from selling on-campus parking
stickers.
Given the popularity of the Gutenberg Express
when it would carry students to Berkeley on a
regular schedule, what are the chances of some
part of the University coming up with a similar
program for the future? It's MISSED!
-K.T.
Clenna Letsinger, secretary to Provost Miller,
said the issue will be raised at meetings in the
Provost's Office in the near future.
The Gutenberg's passenger transport was an
offshoot of needing to transport books between
the two libraries, said Green Library's
Privileges/Service Division Sueprvisor, Susan
McCoy.

"These are needs that need to be addressed,
but not through the library system," she said.
The library currently runs two eleven
passenger vans between the two campuses.
The express service receives funding from the
U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library
Cooperative Program which in turn is funded by
a Sloan foundation grant through Aug. '78.
McCoy said those wishing to use the service
must apply at the library for a Program Bor
rower's Card. The cards are issued to faculty,
academic staff or currently registered graduate
students who need to use research materials.
She said any further questions concerning eligi
bility for acquiring a card should be addressed
to the Privileges/Services Desk at Green Library.

Will the University receive any property tax
reduction on dormitories and apartments on
campus due to the passage of Proposition 13? If
so, will rents be rebated or reduced accordingly?
-K.J.
"No, because on-campus housing is exempt
from property taxes," said Zera Coleman, assis
tant to the manager of real estate.
The California Education Code says that any
land used for educational purposes will be tax
exempt.
The residences are seen as "educational sup
port systems" and therefore are tax-free, she
said.
"I don't know what goes into figuring student
rents," Coleman said, but any reduction in them
would not come as a result of Proposition 13.

"There was an experimental run to midnight
last year," Hamrdla said.
A permanent night service is too expensive to
be funded right now, he added.
Hamrdla said, "The Marguerites are paid for
by the parking fund which is completely used
each year." The parking fund consists of the
money made from selling on-campus parking
stickers.
Given the popularity of the Gutenberg Express
when it would carry students to Berkeley on a
regular schedule, what are the chances of some
part of the University coming up with a similar
program for the future? It's MISSED!

Clenna Letsinger, secretary to Provost Miller,
said the issue will be raised at meetings in the
Provost's Office in the near future.
The Gutenberg's passenger transport was an
offshoot of needing to transport books between
the two libraries, said Green Library's
Privileges/Service Division Sueprvisor, Susan
McCoy.

"These are needs that need to be addressed,
but not through the library system," she said.
The library currently runs two eleven
passenger vans between the two campuses.
The express service receives funding from the
U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library
Cooperative Program which in turn is funded by
a Sloan foundation grant through Aug. '78.
McCoy said those wishing to use the service
must apply at the library for a Program Bor
rower's Card. The cards are issued to faculty,
academic staff or currently registered graduate
students who need to use research materials.
She said any further questions concerning eligi
bility for acquiring a card should be addressed
to the Privileges/Services Desk at Green Library.

Will the University receive any property tax
reduction on dormitories and apartments on
campus due to the passage of Proposition 13? If
so, will rents be rebated or reduced accordingly?
-K.J.
"No, because on-campus housing is exempt
from property taxes," said Zera Coleman, assis
tant to the manager of real estate.
The California Education Code says that any
land used for educational purposes will be tax
exempt.
The residences are seen as "educational sup
port systems" and therefore are tax-free, she
said.
"I don't know what goes into figuring student
rents," Coleman said, but any reduction in them
would not come as a result of Proposition 13.

What can the public do to ensure that the
Marguerites go on running at night and to Tre
sidder and the Med Center this year?
-K.T.
According to Bob Hamrdla, chairperson of the
Committee on Parking and Transportation, "the
public" should write letters to the committee
and address them to the Stanford Police De
partment.
The Marguerites currently run to both Tresid
der and the Med Center.
They do not run at night though, he said.
Carol Christiansen, secretary to the committee,
said the Marguerites run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30
p.m.
