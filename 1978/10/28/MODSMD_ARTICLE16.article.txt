# LSJUMB remembers Morris of feline fame

Stanford, fleeing rain and clean
air so that they may breathe
San Jose smog, use aerosol
deodorants, and drink from
no-deposit, no-return cans and
bottles. We eagerly await their
traditional Beaver formation.
In the wake of OSU's preci
sion marching and playing, the
LSJUMB proceeds to make an
axe of themselves.
For the pre-game show, the
Band thanks psychology's
founding king of kinkiness, Dr.
Sigmund Freud, a man who
taught us how natural our sick
desires and obsessions are.
Research on campus has re
vealed that a large number of
students express a desi re to get
into underwear worn by the
opposite sex (when that can be
determined). Perhaps the
transvestal versions of stu
dents found in the LSJUMB will
bring some things out of the
closetfortoday'sfantasies. The
audience, too, is encouraged
to let it all hang out.
The ways of the Greeks have
been revived on college cam
puses such as ours. Many of
the young boys carry on much
like that "Wayward Son"
OEDIPUS, going to great ends
to satisfy an abu ndant appetite.
But can there ever be a substi
tute for the love of a mother
towards her son?
Having been totally misin
terpreted through the years,
the LSJUMB at long last puts its
first real PHALLIC symbal on
the field. What went on in the
subconscious mind of the ar
chitect who designed that

It's Banned Day again, a
celebration of all those items
or ideas banned from campus
football games, polite soc
iety, or football fields.
In years past we would see
band formations such as ROTC
changing to NOT C, but we
no longer see that organization
around, just vestigial traces
such as the cadet's rifle range
where the LSJUMB continues
its sit-and-drink-in.
A show dealing with religion
is too certain to offend, hence
the band's brain police have
seen fit to ban formations deal
ing with Polish/Popish jokes.
Nostalgic geezers recall the
banned formation in which the
enlightened Cardinals change
PAPAL BULL to the more realis
tic POP A PILL ("I Got
Rhythm"?).
But in today's Banned Day
show we look to America's
pasttimes of smoking and
drinking. Acknowledging the
effects of Prop 5, the LSJUMB
spells WHEEZE HERE, a sign for
smokers to light up in the
proper place.
And drinking prohibitions
are remembered as...
What? You say this was to be
B-A-N-D Day? Bring in
thousands of pubescent high
school boys and girls to play
music? 00p5...
Well, never mind.
Hmmmm...
It's Halloween time again,
and the marching pumpkins of
the Oregon State Band have
made their bi-annual visit to

prominent erection here at
"My Old School"? Couldn't he
have designed a cube or a
pyramid that the band could
depict on the field without
being considered vile and
dirty?
You get the point; at Stan
ford we've got the shaft, and
we've learned to live with it.
Finally, Pavlovian theory,
takes hold, bells and whistles
sound, and Dr. Arthur P.
Barnes leads a brassy explosion
guaranteed to make every
member of the audience stand
up and sing to U.S.
Halftime arrives, and while
Darrin's and Steve's statistics
are compiled at the computer
center, the Stanford Band
chooses to salute a true Ameri
can celebrity.
In a country founded on
freedom of choice, we find the
citizen-consumers depending
on the dreaded species ad
manus nauseatus to tell them
what they need. What greater
representative of the man
ipulative possibilities of adver
tising has existed in recent
years than that pudgy pussy:
MORRIS THE CAT!?
We begin with a sad tribute
to Morris's creator, who bles
sed him with 9 LIVES, until he
went down for the count. Alas,
as of this past July, we are left
with a tight pussy, "Cold As
Ice" and pushing up the
daisies.
The video medium created
the message that this orange
feline messiah carried to con
sumer America. Rumors that

Morris was spotted many an
evening during his last few
years in seamy alleyways, un
controllably hitting the catnip,
remind us of the price that the
bright lights and fame ex
tracted from this once-trim
mouser, sending him to an
eary end.
From that great litter box in
the sky, Morris meows "You
Really Got Me" to the televi
sion industry which has already
forgotten its former hero.
Ah, how many of us have had
to deal with that catty nature
which Morris personified?
.Who hasn't taken opener to
can to prepare a feast for
pussy, only to be greeted with
the FINICKY response, "Not
Tonight"?
As tears stream down
cheeks, the LSJUMB concludes
its tribute to a truly American
champion, that king of CAT
CHOW. The audience is in
vited to join us in bidding

farewell to one of the impor
tant celebrities of our time.
We'll "Miss You," CAT. CIAO!

Murray, cousin of the world
famous and now-deceased
gourmet Morris the Cat, hopes to
replace his relative in he adver
tising face race. This afternoon
the LSJUMB salutes the top cat of
finicky eating, a picky pussy if
ever there was one.
