# Stanford aims to shoot Beavers
## Cards look for 2nd Pac-10 win 
### IVAN MAISEL 
Don't blame Oregon State
head coach Craig Fertig if he is
a little shellshocked. Not every
school has to face the air force
of the Stanford troops after
being run over by the USC
cavalry.
The Stanford Cardinals,
fresh off of a 43-27 shellacking
of Washington State, host Fer
tig's Oregon State Beavers,
who were manhandled by USC
last week, 38-7.
The big win by the Cards last
week in Pullman has breathed
new life into the Stanford
team, especially after the pre
vious two weeks' losses.
The 607 yards amassed by the
Cardinals last week thrust
them into the national spot
light.
Stanford currently ranks
third in the nation in total of
fense (459.7 yards per game),
behind fourth-ranked Neb
raska and top-ranked Ok
lahoma, a 35-29 opening game
victor over the Cards.
In passing offense, Stanford
ranks second in the country
with 282.3 yards per game, trail
ing only SMU.and their hot
sophomore quarterback, Mike
Ford.
The biggest individual win
ner of them all last week was
senior quarterback Steve Dils.
Dils completed 32 of 51 passes
last week for 430 yards, five
touchdowns, and no intercep
tions, rewriting the Pac-10 re
cord book and winning every
"player of the week" award
from sea to shining sea.
"Dils' record speaks for it
self," Head Coach Bill Walsh
said. "His pass protection ena
bled him to stride into his
throws. Namath and Stabler set
their records through great
protection."
Perhaps the most important
statistics in Dils' numbers for
last week is the one that isn't
there: the 0 in the interception

column. Interceptions have
plagued Dils all season long,
and he seems to have turned
the corner in learning how not
to throw them.
Fertigwell realizes the ability
of the senior signal-caller.
"Dils has thrown the ball ex
tremely well," Fertig said. Dils'
mobility, something predeces
sor Guy Benjamin lacked, gives
him an extra dimension in Fer
tig's eyes.
"If he gets in trouble, he will
run with it," Fertig said.
Speaking of running with the
football, the NCAA all-purpose
rushing leader will be lining up
alongside the nation's leading
passer.
Darrin Nelson, averaging
179.4 yards per game in all
purpose running, will lead the
Cardinal running attack along
with senior fullback Phil Fran
cis.
The offensive attack this
week will not consist of 50 pas
ses as did last week's. But "we
weren't planning on throwing
50 passes last week," Coach
Walsh said.
"We will try to split the run
and the pass about 50-50. Ore
gon State is a tough, rugged
team," Walsh said.
Last year Oregon State
blitzed with success against
Stanford, playing the Cards
close for three quarters before
the Cards pulled away for a 26-7
victory. This year, Walsh ex
pects more of the same.
"Oregon State has a beauti
fully conceived defense. They
blitz heavily," Walsh said.
"They did it last year."
Most of the defenses Stan
ford has faced this year have
used the blitz, and Walsh re
mains unruffled.
"The blitz hasn't worked out
too well against us," Walsh
said. "San Jose State had some
success with it early, but we ad
justed. It has hurt every team
that has tried it, because it

leaves our receivers with one
on-one coverage."
"To stop the blitz," Walsh
concluded, "we have to be
stout up front early."
There is a new face on that
offensive front. Sophomore
John Macaulay has taken over
the center position, and de
spite problems with holding
calls, he has pleased the coach
ing staff with his agility and
competitiveness.
"John could be one of the
top centers in the country as a
senior," Walsh said.
Stanford's albatross, better
known as the punting game,
struck again last week when
Washington State blocked a
punt that resulted in a late
touchdown for the Cougars.
"Our punting game is no
longer suspect," said Walsh.
"The conclusions are in. Our
punters are good if they ever
get a chance to kick it past the
line of scrimmage.
"We're working on it. The
punting game looks like it
ought to be, but it did before
last week's game , too," Walsh
said.
