# Chapman anchors defensive secondary
## 
### ROBERT REED 
Sunday afternoon, Robby
Chapman will be modeling
tennis wear at the Stanford
Mother's Club annual
Chrysanthemum Champagne
Party. This may be one day too
late as far as the Oregon State
Beavers are concerned. Satur
day Chapman will be in full
football gear laying his helmet
into any Beaver back or re
ceiver that may come his way.
Chapman, the hard-hitting
safety who last year came in
and solidified a porous de

fense, will (along with lineman
Chuck Evans and linebacker
Gordy Ceresino) lead the im
proved Cardinal defense
against the Beavers this Satur
day at the Stanford Stadium.
Head Coach Bill Walsh said
in this year's press guide that
"His (Chapman's) perfor
mance was a real factor in the
season improvement of our
defense (last year)." This year
that defense has only gotten
better, due, in no small part, to
Chapman's inspired perfor
mance.

"He's made a big differ
ence," said star linebacker
Gordy Ceresino on Chapman.
"It's comforting to know he's
back there," Ceresino said,
explaining that with Chapman,
"You have quick support on
the run. We didn't have that
most of last year. It's a comfort
to see your safety coming up
and slamming down the run
ning back on a sweep."
Oddly enough, tackling is
one area in which Chapman
said he needs improvement.
"I've been making the tack

les, but the ones I've mis
sed...," said Chapman, his
voice dying off. The safety
explained that though he's
been making his share of tack
les (He has 78, third best on the
team), the ones he's missed
have hurt (For instance, the
James Owens run in the UCLA
game). But this is due to the
fact that he is the safety, usually
the last man between the of
fensive player and the goal
line. In any instance, his play
has been exceptional.
One of the most exceptional
things about Chapman's play at
defensive back is that he is in
deed playing defensive back.
Chapman came to Stanford last
year as one of the most highly
recruited prep running backs
in the nation, but so did a guy
named Nelson.
Realizing that a fine athlete
was wasting away on the
bench, Walsh, midway
through the season, moved
Chapman to defensive back. In
ten days, Chapman won a start
ing job in the defensive
backfield. He's been starting
ever since.
Still, he's a relative baby at
his position.
Though he played a, little de
fensive back in high school, it
wasn't nearly as sophisticated
as the defense employed at
Stanford, and Chapman was at
first bewildered by it all.
"I didn't know any of the
concepts involved, but once I
got them down, I was pretty
confident," said the sopho
more, who explained that
though he became confi
dent later on, he still wasn't
very comfortable. "I didn't re
ally feel all that comfortable
right off the bat because I
didn't know all the coverages.
I'm still feeling out the posi
tion."
"He's adjusted as well
as anyone could. He came
over, and never looked back,"
said Defensive Back Coach
George Seifert on Chapman,
explaining that this was some
thing others could not do. This
high praise for Chapman did
not stop with the assistant
coach but went on up to the
top.
Head Coach Walsh called it
"amazing" what Chapman had

been able to do. Said Walsh,
"He's been a great competitor
ever since he arrived on cam
pus. Chapman is one of the top
one or two players on our de
fense. I can't say enough about
him."
High praise indeed fora man
who "was just trying to take the
switchover in stride."
Chapman is 6-foot-2-inch,
195-lb. sophomore from South
Pasadena, where he was
named a prep All-America and
voted the CIF 3A Player of the
Year two years in a row. A ver
satile athlete, Chapman was
also voted All-League in vol
leyball during his prep career.
The 19-year old economics
major's hobbies include
photography, backpacking,
and skiing. Somewhat quiet
and basically mellow, Chap
man has been labelled by his
coach as mature, intelligent,
and enjoyable.
Seifert said that Chapman's
lived up to all his expectations
as a defensive back and that the
only weakness he can spot in
Chapman is that, "he's a
sophomore and he's still learn
ing." But Seifert hastened to
add that he "can see him
(Chapman) getting better
every game."
Seifert noted that the safety's
size, range, and natural athletic
ability were all strong points of
Chapman's but he emphasized
that the sophomore's greatest
strength was his "willingness
to get better." Said Seifert, "He
works to get better. That's all a
coach wants."
When asked what makes him
the player he is, Chapman re
sponded, "My will to play."
This will helped him make a
move that has proved success
ful for the Cards. "I'm always
going to try hard," said Chap
man, explaining his general
philosophy about the game.
Asked about his goals,
Chapman replied, "I'd like to
play professional ball if the op
portunity came up," but he
added that because of his
speed this may not be possible.
As far as interceptions and
tackles are concerned, how
ever, Chapman explained that,
"I'm not really into my stats."
But what Chapman is into is
playing hard and winning.

and slamming down the run
ning back on a sweep."
Oddly enough, tackling is
one area in which Chapman
said he needs improvement.
"I've been making the tack

les, but the ones I've mis
sed...," said Chapman, his
voice dying off. The safety
explained that though he's
been making his share of tack
les (He has 78, third best on the
team), the ones he's missed
have hurt (For instance, the
James Owens run in the UCLA
game). But this is due to the
fact that he is the safety, usually
the last man between the of
fensive player and the goal
line. In any instance, his play
has been exceptional.
One of the most exceptional
things about Chapman's play at
defensive back is that he is in
deed playing defensive back.
Chapman came to Stanford last
year as one of the most highly
recruited prep running backs
in the nation, but so did a guy
named Nelson.
Realizing that a fine athlete
was wasting away on the
bench, Walsh, midway
through the season, moved
Chapman to defensive back. In
ten days, Chapman won a start
ing job in the defensive
backfield. He's been starting
ever since.
Still, he's a relative baby at
his position.
Though he played a, little de
fensive back in high school, it
wasn't nearly as sophisticated
as the defense employed at
Stanford, and Chapman was at
first bewildered by it all.
"I didn't know any of the
concepts involved, but once I
got them down, I was pretty
confident," said the sopho
more, who explained that
though he became confi
dent later on, he still wasn't
very comfortable. "I didn't re
ally feel all that comfortable
right off the bat because I
didn't know all the coverages.
I'm still feeling out the posi
tion."
"He's adjusted as well
as anyone could. He came
over, and never looked back,"
said Defensive Back Coach
George Seifert on Chapman,
explaining that this was some
thing others could not do. This
high praise for Chapman did
not stop with the assistant
coach but went on up to the
top.
Head Coach Walsh called it
"amazing" what Chapman had

been able to do. Said Walsh,
"He's been a great competitor
ever since he arrived on cam
pus. Chapman is one of the top
one or two players on our de
fense. I can't say enough about
him."
High praise indeed fora man
who "was just trying to take the
switchover in stride."
Chapman is 6-foot-2-inch,
195-lb. sophomore from South
Pasadena, where he was
named a prep All-America and
voted the CIF 3A Player of the
Year two years in a row. A ver
satile athlete, Chapman was
also voted All-League in vol
leyball during his prep career.
The 19-year old economics
major's hobbies include
photography, backpacking,
and skiing. Somewhat quiet
and basically mellow, Chap
man has been labelled by his
coach as mature, intelligent,
and enjoyable.
Seifert said that Chapman's
lived up to all his expectations
as a defensive back and that the
only weakness he can spot in
Chapman is that, "he's a
sophomore and he's still learn
ing." But Seifert hastened to
add that he "can see him
(Chapman) getting better
every game."
Seifert noted that the safety's
size, range, and natural athletic
ability were all strong points of
Chapman's but he emphasized
that the sophomore's greatest
strength was his "willingness
to get better." Said Seifert, "He
works to get better. That's all a
coach wants."
When asked what makes him
the player he is, Chapman re
sponded, "My will to play."
This will helped him make a
move that has proved success
ful for the Cards. "I'm always
going to try hard," said Chap
man, explaining his general
philosophy about the game.
Asked about his goals,
Chapman replied, "I'd like to
play professional ball if the op
portunity came up," but he
added that because of his
speed this may not be possible.
As far as interceptions and
tackles are concerned, how
ever, Chapman explained that,
"I'm not really into my stats."
But what Chapman is into is
playing hard and winning.

his position.
Though he played a, little de
fensive back in high school, it
wasn't nearly as sophisticated
as the defense employed at
Stanford, and Chapman was at
first bewildered by it all.
"I didn't know any of the
concepts involved, but once I
got them down, I was pretty
confident," said the sopho
more, who explained that
though he became confi
dent later on, he still wasn't
very comfortable. "I didn't re
ally feel all that comfortable
right off the bat because I
didn't know all the coverages.
I'm still feeling out the posi
tion."
"He's adjusted as well
as anyone could. He came
over, and never looked back,"
said Defensive Back Coach
George Seifert on Chapman,
explaining that this was some
thing others could not do. This
high praise for Chapman did
not stop with the assistant
coach but went on up to the
top.
Head Coach Walsh called it
"amazing" what Chapman had

been able to do. Said Walsh,
"He's been a great competitor
ever since he arrived on cam
pus. Chapman is one of the top
one or two players on our de
fense. I can't say enough about
him."
High praise indeed fora man
who "was just trying to take the
switchover in stride."
Chapman is 6-foot-2-inch,
195-lb. sophomore from South
Pasadena, where he was
named a prep All-America and
voted the CIF 3A Player of the
Year two years in a row. A ver
satile athlete, Chapman was
also voted All-League in vol
leyball during his prep career.
The 19-year old economics
major's hobbies include
photography, backpacking,
and skiing. Somewhat quiet
and basically mellow, Chap
man has been labelled by his
coach as mature, intelligent,
and enjoyable.
Seifert said that Chapman's
lived up to all his expectations
as a defensive back and that the
only weakness he can spot in
Chapman is that, "he's a
sophomore and he's still learn
ing." But Seifert hastened to
add that he "can see him
(Chapman) getting better
every game."
Seifert noted that the safety's
size, range, and natural athletic
ability were all strong points of
Chapman's but he emphasized
that the sophomore's greatest
strength was his "willingness
to get better." Said Seifert, "He
works to get better. That's all a
coach wants."
When asked what makes him
the player he is, Chapman re
sponded, "My will to play."
This will helped him make a
move that has proved success
ful for the Cards. "I'm always
going to try hard," said Chap
man, explaining his general
philosophy about the game.
Asked about his goals,
Chapman replied, "I'd like to
play professional ball if the op
portunity came up," but he
added that because of his
speed this may not be possible.
As far as interceptions and
tackles are concerned, how
ever, Chapman explained that,
"I'm not really into my stats."
But what Chapman is into is
playing hard and winning.

appearance. The sophomore is currently the team's leader in interceptions and is third in tackles for the
year.
Sunday afternoon, Robby
Chapman will be modeling
tennis wear at the Stanford
Mother's Club annual
Chrysanthemum Champagne
Party. This may be one day too
late as far as the Oregon State
Beavers are concerned. Satur
day Chapman will be in full
football gear laying his helmet
into any Beaver back or re
ceiver that may come his way.
Chapman, the hard-hitting
safety who last year came in
and solidified a porous de

fense, will (along with lineman
Chuck Evans and linebacker
Gordy Ceresino) lead the im
proved Cardinal defense
against the Beavers this Satur
day at the Stanford Stadium.
Head Coach Bill Walsh said
in this year's press guide that
"His (Chapman's) perfor
mance was a real factor in the
season improvement of our
defense (last year)." This year
that defense has only gotten
better, due, in no small part, to
Chapman's inspired perfor
mance.

"He's made a big differ
ence," said star linebacker
Gordy Ceresino on Chapman.
"It's comforting to know he's
back there," Ceresino said,
explaining that with Chapman,
"You have quick support on
the run. We didn't have that
most of last year. It's a comfort
to see your safety coming up
and slamming down the run
ning back on a sweep."
Oddly enough, tackling is
one area in which Chapman
said he needs improvement.
"I've been making the tack

les, but the ones I've mis
sed...," said Chapman, his
voice dying off. The safety
explained that though he's
been making his share of tack
les (He has 78, third best on the
team), the ones he's missed
have hurt (For instance, the
James Owens run in the UCLA
game). But this is due to the
fact that he is the safety, usually
the last man between the of
fensive player and the goal
line. In any instance, his play
has been exceptional.
One of the most exceptional
things about Chapman's play at
defensive back is that he is in
deed playing defensive back.
Chapman came to Stanford last
year as one of the most highly
recruited prep running backs
in the nation, but so did a guy
named Nelson.
Realizing that a fine athlete
was wasting away on the
bench, Walsh, midway
through the season, moved
Chapman to defensive back. In
ten days, Chapman won a start
ing job in the defensive
backfield. He's been starting
ever since.
Still, he's a relative baby at
his position.
Though he played a, little de
fensive back in high school, it
