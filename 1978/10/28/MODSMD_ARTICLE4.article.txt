# Nye trades All-Pro for Ph.D.

### CHRIS HAFT 
The library at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business
and Texas Stadium in Irving,
Texas are two of the most dis
parate places imaginable. The
one holds thick books and ear
nest students; the other
houses 60,000 loud football
fans on assorted Sundays.
Blaine Nye, a 1967 graduate
of Stanford who performed for
nine seasons in Texas Stadium
and other National Football
League temples as the Dallas
Cowboys' right guard, sud
denly retired prior to the 1977
campaign to enter business
school here full-time, thus ex
changing a locker-room stall
fora Biz School library cubicle.
Nye's decision was unique
for two reasons: first of all,
professional athletes rarely
leave their sport to resume
academics usually it's the
other way around.
Second, Nye was one of the
best offensive linemen in the
league. In 1976, which turned
out to be his final year, he was
named to the All-NFC and Pro
Bowl squads, and had previ
ously been a 1973 All-Pro and
1974 Pro Bowl participant.
Yet unlike many players, Nye
displayed prudent foresight in
realizing that football rep
resented just a temporary oc
cupation.
"I always looked forward to
what I would do afterfootball,"
Nye said. He took his first step
toward retirement when he en
tered Stanford's Ph.D program
in business finance in January,
1977.
Moreover, after nine NFL
seasons, Nye no longer felt he
had to stay in football for the
money. "It got to the point
where I had all financial re
quirements taken care of," he
said. "I wasn't hotto retire but I
wasn't hot to keep playing."
Nye wouldn't have minded
capitalizing on the current es
calating salary trend, however.
He would still be wearing No.
61 if the Cowboys' manage
ment had opened its wallet
more.
"I told them it's worth it to
me if you pay me a bunch," he
related, "but I had two years
left on my contract (Nye was
entering the fourth year of a

five-year package) and they
didn't want to set a precedent
by renegotiating."
Nye's teammates responded
with ambivalent thoughts con
cerning his departure. They
were jealous that he would be
relaxing while they suffered
physical punishment, but they
also failed to believe how he
could leave the wealth and
fame pro football afforded.
"Ballplayers have kind of a
love/hate attitude they hate
the bullshit and pressure, but
they love the money and the
glamour," Nye explained. "So
it depends on when you talk to
them: if you talk with someone
after practice, he'd be envious;
if it was after he got his
paycheck, he'd say, 'Your're a
fool.'"
The Dallas front office, Nye
claimed, felt somewhat uneasy
regarding his retirement. "The
wayitturned out, management
couldn't afford to lose me.
After I left Rayfield (Wright)
went down with a knee and
(John) Fitzgerald had gangrene
on an elbow, so they couldn't
have been real pleased about it
they were forced to start
rookies on the line for a
while."
By August of '77 Nye had de
finitely decided to add to his
MBA from Stanford and mas
ters in physics from the Uni
versity of Washington. Nye is
glad he left when he did, for he
had another essential obliga
tion: his family.
Had he continued playing,
Nye said his wife Annabelle
and his kids, Melissa and
Blaine Jr. "would have just
kicked meoutforsix months."
Now Blaine is quite happy
living in Menlo Park and at
tending school. Rather than
harbor bad feelings about his
Texas tenure, he speaks well of
Dallas in retrospect.
"It's a nice place to play in,"
he said. "Games are more im
portant to play there because
they're more important to the
people. Texans appreciate
football, so we did too."
Nye said he never experi
enced twinges of regret during
his first season of inactivity. "It
hurt just a littl'e bit when they
(Dallas) made the Super Bowl,
but overall, I played well

enough to be satisfied with my
career."
The adjustment from gridi
ron to classroom presented no
problems for Nye. "I've always
liked school it's a hell of a lot
better than working," he af
firmed.
Did he enjoy even his un
dergraduate years? With that
question Nye's face appeared
bemused. He answered slyly,
"Well, in those years there
were other things to occupy
your time besides school."
Though Nye still likes foot
ball, he pays little attention to
the NFL, including his former
teammates. "Strange, I wasn't
a Cowboy fan when they
drafted me (in the fifth round,
1968), and now that I'm not
with them anymore I don't root
for them. I like the college
game better."
One aspect of football that
needs improvement, Nye be
lieves, is high school coaching.
Too many coaches at that level
are in it for themselves, he
complained:
"You're not playing for the
school or the 'old alums'
you're playing for the coach.
He wants an undefeated sea
son so he can get a better,
higher-paying job..
"The coach robs football of

the pleasure it could be," Nye
continued. "If I had my way,
the coach would have to be a
teacher whose job didn't de
pend on the success of the
football team."
As a result, Nye's loveforthe
game remained tempered
throughout high school and
even at Stanford, where he let
tered from 1965-67. Not until
the 1970 season did his ap
preciation blossom.
"After three years as a pro I
started liking the game again,"
Nye said. "Basically, I just ma
tured. I was a part of the team

that went to the Super Bowl,
and I experienced for the first
time what it means to play a
'team' sport."
Nye singles out the week be
fore Super Bowl V, with its
concomitant hoopla and glit
ter, as his biggest pro thirll. "I
was still young and impres
sionable, and all that attention
got to me and for that week, I
was a really important man!"
he enthused. Playing in the
Super Bowl itself, he added,
was a "secondary" thrill in
comparison.

The library at Stanford's

Blaine Nye, a 1967 graduate
of Stanford who performed for
nine seasons in Texas Stadium
and other National Football
League temples as the Dallas
Cowboys' right guard, sud
denly retired prior to the 1977
campaign to enter business
school here full-time, thus ex
changing a locker-room stall
fora Biz School library cubicle.
Nye's decision was unique
for two reasons: first of all,
professional athletes rarely
leave their sport to resume
academics usually it's the
other way around.
Second, Nye was one of the
best offensive linemen in the
league. In 1976, which turned
out to be his final year, he was
named to the All-NFC and Pro
Bowl squads, and had previ
ously been a 1973 All-Pro and
1974 Pro Bowl participant.
Yet unlike many players, Nye
displayed prudent foresight in
realizing that football rep
resented just a temporary oc
cupation.
"I always looked forward to
what I would do afterfootball,"
Nye said. He took his first step
toward retirement when he en
tered Stanford's Ph.D program
in business finance in January,
1977.
Moreover, after nine NFL
seasons, Nye no longer felt he
had to stay in football for the
money. "It got to the point
where I had all financial re
quirements taken care of," he
said. "I wasn't hotto retire but I
wasn't hot to keep playing."
Nye wouldn't have minded
capitalizing on the current es
calating salary trend, however.
He would still be wearing No.
61 if the Cowboys' manage
ment had opened its wallet
more.
"I told them it's worth it to
me if you pay me a bunch," he
related, "but I had two years
left on my contract (Nye was
entering the fourth year of a

five-year package) and they
didn't want to set a precedent
by renegotiating."
Nye's teammates responded
with ambivalent thoughts con
cerning his departure. They
were jealous that he would be
relaxing while they suffered
physical punishment, but they
also failed to believe how he
could leave the wealth and
fame pro football afforded.
"Ballplayers have kind of a
love/hate attitude they hate
the bullshit and pressure, but
they love the money and the
glamour," Nye explained. "So
it depends on when you talk to
them: if you talk with someone
after practice, he'd be envious;
if it was after he got his
paycheck, he'd say, 'Your're a
fool.'"
The Dallas front office, Nye
claimed, felt somewhat uneasy
regarding his retirement. "The
wayitturned out, management
couldn't afford to lose me.
After I left Rayfield (Wright)
went down with a knee and
(John) Fitzgerald had gangrene
on an elbow, so they couldn't
have been real pleased about it
they were forced to start
rookies on the line for a
while."
By August of '77 Nye had de
finitely decided to add to his
MBA from Stanford and mas
ters in physics from the Uni
versity of Washington. Nye is
glad he left when he did, for he
had another essential obliga
tion: his family.
Had he continued playing,
Nye said his wife Annabelle
and his kids, Melissa and
Blaine Jr. "would have just
kicked meoutforsix months."
Now Blaine is quite happy
living in Menlo Park and at
tending school. Rather than
harbor bad feelings about his
Texas tenure, he speaks well of
Dallas in retrospect.
"It's a nice place to play in,"
he said. "Games are more im
portant to play there because
they're more important to the
people. Texans appreciate
football, so we did too."
Nye said he never experi
enced twinges of regret during
his first season of inactivity. "It
hurt just a littl'e bit when they
(Dallas) made the Super Bowl,
but overall, I played well

enough to be satisfied with my
career."
The adjustment from gridi
ron to classroom presented no
problems for Nye. "I've always
liked school it's a hell of a lot
better than working," he af
firmed.
Did he enjoy even his un
dergraduate years? With that
question Nye's face appeared
bemused. He answered slyly,
"Well, in those years there
were other things to occupy
your time besides school."
Though Nye still likes foot
ball, he pays little attention to
the NFL, including his former
teammates. "Strange, I wasn't
a Cowboy fan when they
drafted me (in the fifth round,
1968), and now that I'm not
with them anymore I don't root
for them. I like the college
game better."
One aspect of football that
needs improvement, Nye be
lieves, is high school coaching.
Too many coaches at that level
are in it for themselves, he
complained:
"You're not playing for the
school or the 'old alums'
you're playing for the coach.
He wants an undefeated sea
son so he can get a better,
higher-paying job..
"The coach robs football of

the pleasure it could be," Nye
continued. "If I had my way,
the coach would have to be a
teacher whose job didn't de
pend on the success of the
football team."
As a result, Nye's loveforthe
game remained tempered
throughout high school and
even at Stanford, where he let
tered from 1965-67. Not until
the 1970 season did his ap
preciation blossom.
"After three years as a pro I
started liking the game again,"
Nye said. "Basically, I just ma
tured. I was a part of the team

that went to the Super Bowl,
and I experienced for the first
time what it means to play a
'team' sport."
Nye singles out the week be
fore Super Bowl V, with its
concomitant hoopla and glit
ter, as his biggest pro thirll. "I
was still young and impres
sionable, and all that attention
got to me and for that week, I
was a really important man!"
he enthused. Playing in the
Super Bowl itself, he added,
was a "secondary" thrill in
comparison.

Blaine Nye is shown here in the Stanford uniform he wore from 1965
to 1967. Nye went on to become an All-Pro with the Dallas Cowboys
at his offensive guard position. Nye suddenly retired from his professional
sports career to enter the professional academic field at the
Stanford Business School, where he is studying for his Ph.D.
Training camp, the bane of
most players, is actually a fond
subject for Nye, now that he's
retired. "The best thing about
training camps is remembering
them. Hell, you sweat, drink
beer, go to sleep, sweat, and
drink beer: very clear, no
complications, no politics."
Nye doubts that other pros
will leave such joys to resume
studying as he did. "I'm not
Setting any trend," he said.
"Lots of athletes mature late
they become 30-year-old big
kids looking for a job but I
don't think a lot will rush back
to school."
Nye's objective in pursuing a
Ph.D. is to teach business or
economics at the university
level.
Where Nye thinks he will
teach is not a relevant issue,
and the notion of becoming an
instructor here is attractive but
distant. "Sure, I'd love to teach
at Stanford," he said, "but I'd
have to write some Nobel
Prize-winning papers first!"
The library at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business
and Texas Stadium in Irving,
Texas are two of the most dis
parate places imaginable. The
one holds thick books and ear
nest students; the other
houses 60,000 loud football
fans on assorted Sundays.
Blaine Nye, a 1967 graduate
of Stanford who performed for
nine seasons in Texas Stadium
and other National Football
League temples as the Dallas
Cowboys' right guard, sud
denly retired prior to the 1977
campaign to enter business
school here full-time, thus ex
changing a locker-room stall
fora Biz School library cubicle.
Nye's decision was unique
for two reasons: first of all,
professional athletes rarely
leave their sport to resume
academics usually it's the
other way around.
Second, Nye was one of the
best offensive linemen in the
league. In 1976, which turned
out to be his final year, he was
named to the All-NFC and Pro
Bowl squads, and had previ
ously been a 1973 All-Pro and
1974 Pro Bowl participant.
Yet unlike many players, Nye
displayed prudent foresight in
realizing that football rep
resented just a temporary oc
cupation.
"I always looked forward to
what I would do afterfootball,"
Nye said. He took his first step
toward retirement when he en
tered Stanford's Ph.D program
in business finance in January,
1977.
Moreover, after nine NFL
seasons, Nye no longer felt he
had to stay in football for the
money. "It got to the point
where I had all financial re
quirements taken care of," he
said. "I wasn't hotto retire but I
wasn't hot to keep playing."
Nye wouldn't have minded
capitalizing on the current es
calating salary trend, however.
He would still be wearing No.
61 if the Cowboys' manage
ment had opened its wallet
more.
"I told them it's worth it to
me if you pay me a bunch," he
related, "but I had two years
left on my contract (Nye was
entering the fourth year of a

five-year package) and they
didn't want to set a precedent
by renegotiating."
Nye's teammates responded
with ambivalent thoughts con
cerning his departure. They
were jealous that he would be
relaxing while they suffered
physical punishment, but they
also failed to believe how he
could leave the wealth and
fame pro football afforded.
"Ballplayers have kind of a
love/hate attitude they hate
the bullshit and pressure, but
they love the money and the
glamour," Nye explained. "So
it depends on when you talk to
them: if you talk with someone
after practice, he'd be envious;
if it was after he got his
paycheck, he'd say, 'Your're a
fool.'"
The Dallas front office, Nye
claimed, felt somewhat uneasy
regarding his retirement. "The
wayitturned out, management
couldn't afford to lose me.
After I left Rayfield (Wright)
went down with a knee and
(John) Fitzgerald had gangrene
on an elbow, so they couldn't
have been real pleased about it
they were forced to start
rookies on the line for a
while."
By August of '77 Nye had de
finitely decided to add to his
MBA from Stanford and mas
ters in physics from the Uni
versity of Washington. Nye is
glad he left when he did, for he
had another essential obliga
tion: his family.
Had he continued playing,
Nye said his wife Annabelle
and his kids, Melissa and
Blaine Jr. "would have just
kicked meoutforsix months."
Now Blaine is quite happy
living in Menlo Park and at
tending school. Rather than
harbor bad feelings about his
Texas tenure, he speaks well of
Dallas in retrospect.
"It's a nice place to play in,"
he said. "Games are more im
portant to play there because
they're more important to the
people. Texans appreciate
football, so we did too."
Nye said he never experi
enced twinges of regret during
his first season of inactivity. "It
hurt just a littl'e bit when they
(Dallas) made the Super Bowl,
but overall, I played well

enough to be satisfied with my
career."
The adjustment from gridi
ron to classroom presented no
problems for Nye. "I've always
liked school it's a hell of a lot
better than working," he af
firmed.
Did he enjoy even his un
dergraduate years? With that
question Nye's face appeared
bemused. He answered slyly,
"Well, in those years there
were other things to occupy
your time besides school."
Though Nye still likes foot
ball, he pays little attention to
the NFL, including his former
teammates. "Strange, I wasn't
a Cowboy fan when they
drafted me (in the fifth round,
1968), and now that I'm not
with them anymore I don't root
for them. I like the college
game better."
One aspect of football that
needs improvement, Nye be
lieves, is high school coaching.
Too many coaches at that level
are in it for themselves, he
complained:
"You're not playing for the
school or the 'old alums'
you're playing for the coach.
He wants an undefeated sea
son so he can get a better,
higher-paying job..
"The coach robs football of

the pleasure it could be," Nye
continued. "If I had my way,
the coach would have to be a
teacher whose job didn't de
pend on the success of the
football team."
As a result, Nye's loveforthe
game remained tempered
throughout high school and
even at Stanford, where he let
tered from 1965-67. Not until
the 1970 season did his ap
preciation blossom.
"After three years as a pro I
started liking the game again,"
Nye said. "Basically, I just ma
tured. I was a part of the team

that went to the Super Bowl,
and I experienced for the first
time what it means to play a
'team' sport."
Nye singles out the week be
fore Super Bowl V, with its
concomitant hoopla and glit
ter, as his biggest pro thirll. "I
was still young and impres
sionable, and all that attention
got to me and for that week, I
was a really important man!"
he enthused. Playing in the
Super Bowl itself, he added,
was a "secondary" thrill in

Blaine Nye is shown here in the Stanford uniform he wore from 1965
to 1967. Nye went on to become an All-Pro with the Dallas Cowboys
at his offensive guard position. Nye suddenly retired from his professional
sports career to enter the professional academic field at the
Stanford Business School, where he is studying for his Ph.D.
Training camp, the bane of
most players, is actually a fond
subject for Nye, now that he's
retired. "The best thing about
training camps is remembering
them. Hell, you sweat, drink
beer, go to sleep, sweat, and
drink beer: very clear, no
complications, no politics."
Nye doubts that other pros
will leave such joys to resume
studying as he did. "I'm not
Setting any trend," he said.
"Lots of athletes mature late
they become 30-year-old big
kids looking for a job but I
don't think a lot will rush back
to school."
Nye's objective in pursuing a
Ph.D. is to teach business or
economics at the university
level.
Where Nye thinks he will
teach is not a relevant issue,
and the notion of becoming an
instructor here is attractive but
distant. "Sure, I'd love to teach
at Stanford," he said, "but I'd
have to write some Nobel
Prize-winning papers first!"
The library at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business
and Texas Stadium in Irving,
Texas are two of the most dis
parate places imaginable. The
one holds thick books and ear
nest students; the other
houses 60,000 loud football
fans on assorted Sundays.
Blaine Nye, a 1967 graduate
of Stanford who performed for
nine seasons in Texas Stadium
and other National Football
League temples as the Dallas
Cowboys' right guard, sud
denly retired prior to the 1977
campaign to enter business
school here full-time, thus ex
changing a locker-room stall
fora Biz School library cubicle.
Nye's decision was unique
for two reasons: first of all,
professional athletes rarely
leave their sport to resume
academics usually it's the
other way around.
Second, Nye was one of the
best offensive linemen in the
league. In 1976, which turned
out to be his final year, he was
named to the All-NFC and Pro
Bowl squads, and had previ
ously been a 1973 All-Pro and
1974 Pro Bowl participant.
Yet unlike many players, Nye
displayed prudent foresight in
realizing that football rep
resented just a temporary oc
cupation.
"I always looked forward to
what I would do afterfootball,"
Nye said. He took his first step
toward retirement when he en
tered Stanford's Ph.D program
in business finance in January,
1977.
Moreover, after nine NFL
seasons, Nye no longer felt he
had to stay in football for the
money. "It got to the point
where I had all financial re
quirements taken care of," he
said. "I wasn't hotto retire but I
wasn't hot to keep playing."
Nye wouldn't have minded
capitalizing on the current es
calating salary trend, however.
He would still be wearing No.
61 if the Cowboys' manage
ment had opened its wallet
more.
"I told them it's worth it to
me if you pay me a bunch," he
related, "but I had two years
left on my contract (Nye was
entering the fourth year of a

five-year package) and they
didn't want to set a precedent
by renegotiating."
Nye's teammates responded
with ambivalent thoughts con
cerning his departure. They
were jealous that he would be
relaxing while they suffered
physical punishment, but they
also failed to believe how he
could leave the wealth and
fame pro football afforded.
"Ballplayers have kind of a
love/hate attitude they hate
the bullshit and pressure, but
they love the money and the
glamour," Nye explained. "So
it depends on when you talk to
them: if you talk with someone
after practice, he'd be envious;
if it was after he got his
paycheck, he'd say, 'Your're a
fool.'"
The Dallas front office, Nye
claimed, felt somewhat uneasy
regarding his retirement. "The
wayitturned out, management
couldn't afford to lose me.
After I left Rayfield (Wright)
went down with a knee and
(John) Fitzgerald had gangrene
on an elbow, so they couldn't
have been real pleased about it
they were forced to start
rookies on the line for a
while."
By August of '77 Nye had de
finitely decided to add to his
MBA from Stanford and mas
ters in physics from the Uni
versity of Washington. Nye is
glad he left when he did, for he
had another essential obliga
tion: his family.
Had he continued playing,
Nye said his wife Annabelle
and his kids, Melissa and
Blaine Jr. "would have just
kicked meoutforsix months."
Now Blaine is quite happy
living in Menlo Park and at
tending school. Rather than
harbor bad feelings about his
Texas tenure, he speaks well of
Dallas in retrospect.
"It's a nice place to play in,"
he said. "Games are more im
portant to play there because
they're more important to the
people. Texans appreciate
football, so we did too."
Nye said he never experi
enced twinges of regret during
his first season of inactivity. "It
hurt just a littl'e bit when they
(Dallas) made the Super Bowl,
but overall, I played well

enough to be satisfied with my
career."
The adjustment from gridi
ron to classroom presented no
problems for Nye. "I've always
liked school it's a hell of a lot
better than working," he af
firmed.
Did he enjoy even his un
dergraduate years? With that
question Nye's face appeared
bemused. He answered slyly,
"Well, in those years there
were other things to occupy
your time besides school."
Though Nye still likes foot
ball, he pays little attention to
the NFL, including his former
teammates. "Strange, I wasn't
a Cowboy fan when they
drafted me (in the fifth round,
1968), and now that I'm not
with them anymore I don't root
for them. I like the college
game better."
One aspect of football that
needs improvement, Nye be
lieves, is high school coaching.
Too many coaches at that level
are in it for themselves, he
complained:
"You're not playing for the
school or the 'old alums'
you're playing for the coach.
He wants an undefeated sea
son so he can get a better,
higher-paying job..
"The coach robs football of

the pleasure it could be," Nye
continued. "If I had my way,
the coach would have to be a
teacher whose job didn't de
pend on the success of the
football team."
As a result, Nye's loveforthe
game remained tempered
throughout high school and
even at Stanford, where he let
tered from 1965-67. Not until
the 1970 season did his ap
preciation blossom.
"After three years as a pro I
started liking the game again,"
Nye said. "Basically, I just ma
tured. I was a part of the team

that went to the Super Bowl,
and I experienced for the first
time what it means to play a
'team' sport."
Nye singles out the week be
fore Super Bowl V, with its
concomitant hoopla and glit
ter, as his biggest pro thirll. "I
was still young and impres
sionable, and all that attention
got to me and for that week, I
was a really important man!"
he enthused. Playing in the
Super Bowl itself, he added,
was a "secondary" thrill in
comparison.
