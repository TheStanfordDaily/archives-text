# Effective intelligence doesn't have to be covert

### BRIAN COPPLE 
In first quarter action, Ore
gon State has possession of the
ball on the left hash mark of
their own 37 yard line. It's sec
ond and eight. What will the
Beavers do?
Your guess is as good as
mine, but not as good as Stan
ford Head Coach Bill Walsh's.

As a matter of fact, the Cards
don't have to guess at all; they
know what the Beavers are
likely to do. This knowledge is
not due to ESP, but to the Car
dinal coaching staff's intensive
pre-game evaluation of the
opposition.
The highly competitive na
ture of NCAA football de

mands detailed preparation for
each game. An integral part of
that preparation is familiarity
with the opponent, achieved
through pre-game scouting.
NCAA practice dictates that
about a week and a half prior to
a scheduled game, opposing
teams exchange their season
game films. These films are the

prime source of informaton
about the opposition.
At Stanford, these films ar
rive at the offices of Dave
Ottmar and Jerry Leith, who
carry out the process of film
breakdown and enemy evalua
tion.
Ottmar is with Stanford's de
fensive staff, and so concen
trates on opposing offenses.
Leith charts rival defenses for
Stanford's offense. Together,
the two view the films and
evaluate them, recording every
play the opponent (in this case
Oregon State) has run in games
this year. Each play is listed on a
separate card which includes
down, yards to go, and field
position.
This data is then collated and
graphed into a tendency chart,
which lists, based on prece
dent, which plays and defenses
Oregon State is likely to run in
given situations. Thus, as long
as OSU's style of play remains
consistent with previous
games, the Beavers are some
what predictable to Stanford's
coaching staff.
Upon completion of film
breakdown, the entire coach
ing staff watches the films sev
eral times over. During these
viewings, coaches search out
the opposing team's general
strengths and weaknesses and
evaluate the rival personnel.
This information is crucial to
formation of a game plan; the
coaches plot ways to capitalize
on Oregon State's weak spots
and contain their strengths.
Specific situations are also
evaluated; for example, can
Ken Margerum beat the Beaver
secondary on a deep pattern or
can Gordy Ceresino blitz suc
cessfully over the left side of
the Beaver line?
The players also view the
films, usually for at least an
hour a day. In these off-the
field practices, individual Car
dinals acquaint themselves
with the opponent in general
and with specific gridders who
will be playing opposite them.

According to running back Phil
Francis, during these film ses
sions players generally con
centrate on personnel and let
the coaches worry about ten
dencies. The players also re
ceive playbooks of the opposi
tion to study.
After this film evaluation, the
knowledge of the opposition is
taken to the practice field. The
Coaching staff "scripts" the
foe's offenses and defenses
and Stanford non-starters form
a scouting team which runs
enemy offenses and defenses
for the Cards to practice
against.
By game ti me Saturday, Stan
ford's starters have hypotheti
cally already had a week of
practice against their oppo
nent, and should be ready to
play intelligent football.
Though films comprise the
greatest part of Stanford's sc
outing, there are other sources
of information about the op
position. Coaches often confer
with each other about, a third
team which is a common foe.
At times coaches become pre
dictable; after many years of
competition and acquain
tance, they may learn enough
about each other's per
sonalities and coaching
methods to accurately forecast
their game plans.
Surprisingly, watching a fu
ture foe in action is not a valid
scouting method at Stanford.
According to Ottmar, such sc
outing is of "negligible value"
because of the availability of
game films, which can be vie
wed over and over again (not
only fans value the instant re
play).
Stanford scouts did watch
San Jose State, Illinois, and
Tulane, but this scouting prac
tice is banned for Pac-10
games.
Players are the best judges of
how well they are prepared for
games, and Cardinal gridders
are generally laudatory of their
mentors when it comes to this
area.
