# Gazing into the future: schedules get tougher
## 
### IVAN MAISEL May, 1984 
Stanford, Ca. Tickets for
the September 8 season
opener against Oklahoma will
go on sale on. . . .
1984? Don't be so shocked,
for not only is Stanford's
datebook filled up through
1984, but Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz is currently working on
the schedule for 1991.
"When I came here seven
years ago," Ruetz said, "our
schedule was full through
1985."
Certainly there are no im
mediate advantages in
scheduling a game 13 years
hence. No one knows how
good Stanford will be, nor who
will be wearing the Cardinal
and Cream then (Jim Plunkett,
Jr. might be quarterbacking,
and Head Coach Bill Walsh's
seven-year-old daughter
Elizabeth may be a Stanford
Dolly).
Most importantly, Ruetz has
no way of predicting, nor does
anyone else for that matter,
how good a team will be next
week, regardless of 1991. If
anyone does, please call this
writer about a field trip to Las
Vegas.
With all those variables, why
are schools all over the country
booked solidly for the next 10
years? Ruetz doesn't profess to
have the answer, he just plays
the game.
"I kinda think it's silly, but
everybody does it," Ruetz ad
mitted. "If you don't schedule
a team far in advance, some
body else has them informally
scheduled and you're out of
business."
Because of the rush to
schedule, trying to fill an open
date in any of the next five
years would "face the problem
of not having any good teams
left," Ruetz said.
Some problems can't be av
oided. The deal that brought
Pac-10 brethren Arizona and
Arizona State into the fold was
hailed by everyone from the

school presidents to the
coaches. Everyone, that is, ex
cept the athletic directors.
When a school is brought
into a conference, there is usu
ally a 5-to-10 year grace period
in which schedules are rear
ranged and the "new boy in
class" can get accustomed to
all the new faces. With the
Arizona schools, the deal was
consummated only last year,
and they are playing a confer
ence schedule one year later.
"The problems caused were
so enormous that the schools
presidents did not want to get
involved," Ruetz said.
Every school had certain
traditions they wanted to keep,
and Stanford was no excep
tion.
"We always like to play Cal at
the end of the year," Ruetz
said. "We certainly didn't want
to switch them to the f i rst game
of the year.
"We wanted to keep USC
and UCLA on our schedule,
too, because of the downstate
rivalry and the big crowd they
always draw," Ruetz added.
There are over 130 schools
which field Division I football
teams, but Stanford can only
schedule 11 per year. Ruetz
outlined the criteria he uses in
filling those open Saturdays.
"Ideally, we like to schedule
the teams from the Big Ten,"
Ruetz said. "Schools such as
Michigan, Wisconsin and Il
linois are philosophically
closer to the Pac-10 schools in
academics. In addition, these
schools are all located in a big
population area."
Big populations areas mean
big crowds, which in turn
means big gate receipts. Ruetz
is not shy in admitting that
there is a financial side in set
ting up the schedule.
"There is a dollar implica
tion," Ruetz said. "Football is
the big income-producing
sport for our other sports.
"We look at a school's pat
tern of gate receipts," Ruetz
continued. "There is no sense

in scheduling a Ball State
where you get $5OOO in gate re
ceipts and it costs you $50,000
to go out there."
Being a West Coast school
can be hazardous in schedul
ing intersectional games. Add
that to the peculiarities of the
Bay Area, and they put re
straints on the schools to
schedule.
"Early in the season, we are
at a disadvantage," Ruetz said.
"We don't attract a great
number of people from the Bay
Area." In order to get a big
gate, it is usually necessary to
start on the road.
"If a team seems to be
alumni-supported, then we
will schedule them here. Ok
lahoma brought out 10,000
people this year," Ruetz said.
"But Michigan doesn't have
that support. We would be
lucky to get 40,000 here, where
we would get 100,000 if we
played them out there."
A Michigan or an Oklahoma
can also catch the attention of
ABC-TV, which would mean "a
significant amount of money
forour program. We are always
scheduling with the possibility
of a TV appearance in our
mind," Ruetz said.
The problems of scheduling
so far in advance can be seen in
full by glancing at Stanford's
schedules for 1975 and for next
year, 1979.
"An athletic director can
overschedule as we did in
1975," Ruetz said. "We played
Penn State and Michigan in a
row. (Stanford lost to Penn
State 34-14 and tied Michigan
19-19. Both games were on the
road.) It had a deleterious ef
fect on the attitude of our
players."
Next year Stanford opens the
season with Tulane, then plays
San Jose State, Army and Bos
ton College. Face it, they don't
exactly bring to mind Ok
lahoma, Penn State, Alabama
and Nebraska.
Sometimes there is a re
medy, if you can find a team
who has the opposite problem
that you have.
"Washington State's
schedule for the 1980 season
opened with Tennessee, Ok
lahoma and USC. We were
scheduled to start with Tulane,
Army and San Jose State (and
Oregon and Boston College),"
Ruetz said.
"We needed a good interse-

ctional game, and so we went
to Washington State and made
the switch, Oklahoma for
Army," Ruetz said.
Ruetz called a good
schedule a "very valuable re
cruiting tool."
"We play in the toughest
conference in the country. If
we can get one good intersec
tional game, it gives the players
a chance to see whether they
measure up," Ruetz said.
Take a glance at the next six
years' schedule. Add future
contests with Notre Dame,
Texas, Baylor and Kansas, and
it is easy to see that the Cards of
the future will be doing plenty
of measuring up in the years
ahead.

where you get $5OOO in gate re
ceipts and it costs you $50,000
to go out there."
Being a West Coast school
can be hazardous in schedul
ing intersectional games. Add
that to the peculiarities of the
Bay Area, and they put re
straints on the schools to
schedule.
"Early in the season, we are
at a disadvantage," Ruetz said.
"We don't attract a great
number of people from the Bay
Area." In order to get a big
gate, it is usually necessary to
start on the road.
"If a team seems to be
alumni-supported, then we
will schedule them here. Ok
lahoma brought out 10,000
people this year," Ruetz said.
"But Michigan doesn't have
that support. We would be
lucky to get 40,000 here, where
we would get 100,000 if we
played them out there."
A Michigan or an Oklahoma
can also catch the attention of
ABC-TV, which would mean "a
significant amount of money
forour program. We are always
scheduling with the possibility
of a TV appearance in our
mind," Ruetz said.
The problems of scheduling
so far in advance can be seen in
full by glancing at Stanford's
schedules for 1975 and for next
year, 1979.
"An athletic director can
overschedule as we did in
1975," Ruetz said. "We played
Penn State and Michigan in a
row. (Stanford lost to Penn
State 34-14 and tied Michigan
19-19. Both games were on the
road.) It had a deleterious ef
fect on the attitude of our
players."
Next year Stanford opens the
season with Tulane, then plays
San Jose State, Army and Bos
ton College. Face it, they don't
exactly bring to mind Ok
lahoma, Penn State, Alabama
and Nebraska.
Sometimes there is a re
medy, if you can find a team
who has the opposite problem
that you have.
"Washington State's
schedule for the 1980 season
opened with Tennessee, Ok
lahoma and USC. We were
scheduled to start with Tulane,
Army and San Jose State (and
Oregon and Boston College),"
Ruetz said.
"We needed a good interse-

ctional game, and so we went
to Washington State and made
the switch, Oklahoma for
Army," Ruetz said.
Ruetz called a good
schedule a "very valuable re
cruiting tool."
"We play in the toughest
conference in the country. If
we can get one good intersec
tional game, it gives the players
a chance to see whether they
measure up," Ruetz said.
Take a glance at the next six
years' schedule. Add future
contests with Notre Dame,
Texas, Baylor and Kansas, and
it is easy to see that the Cards of
the future will be doing plenty
of measuring up in the years
ahead.

1984? Don't be so shocked,
for not only is Stanford's
datebook filled up through
1984, but Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz is currently working on
the schedule for 1991.
"When I came here seven
years ago," Ruetz said, "our
schedule was full through
1985."
Certainly there are no im
mediate advantages in
scheduling a game 13 years
hence. No one knows how
good Stanford will be, nor who
will be wearing the Cardinal
and Cream then (Jim Plunkett,
Jr. might be quarterbacking,
and Head Coach Bill Walsh's
seven-year-old daughter
Elizabeth may be a Stanford
Dolly).
Most importantly, Ruetz has
no way of predicting, nor does
anyone else for that matter,
how good a team will be next
week, regardless of 1991. If
anyone does, please call this
writer about a field trip to Las
Vegas.
With all those variables, why
are schools all over the country
booked solidly for the next 10
years? Ruetz doesn't profess to
have the answer, he just plays
the game.
"I kinda think it's silly, but
everybody does it," Ruetz ad
mitted. "If you don't schedule
a team far in advance, some
body else has them informally
scheduled and you're out of
business."
Because of the rush to
schedule, trying to fill an open
date in any of the next five
years would "face the problem
of not having any good teams
left," Ruetz said.
Some problems can't be av
oided. The deal that brought
Pac-10 brethren Arizona and
Arizona State into the fold was
hailed by everyone from the

school presidents to the
coaches. Everyone, that is, ex
cept the athletic directors.
When a school is brought
into a conference, there is usu
ally a 5-to-10 year grace period
in which schedules are rear
ranged and the "new boy in
class" can get accustomed to
all the new faces. With the
Arizona schools, the deal was
consummated only last year,
and they are playing a confer
ence schedule one year later.
"The problems caused were
so enormous that the schools
presidents did not want to get
involved," Ruetz said.
Every school had certain
traditions they wanted to keep,
and Stanford was no excep
tion.
"We always like to play Cal at
the end of the year," Ruetz
said. "We certainly didn't want
to switch them to the f i rst game
of the year.
"We wanted to keep USC
and UCLA on our schedule,
too, because of the downstate
rivalry and the big crowd they
always draw," Ruetz added.
There are over 130 schools
which field Division I football
teams, but Stanford can only
schedule 11 per year. Ruetz
outlined the criteria he uses in
filling those open Saturdays.
"Ideally, we like to schedule
the teams from the Big Ten,"
Ruetz said. "Schools such as
Michigan, Wisconsin and Il
linois are philosophically
closer to the Pac-10 schools in
academics. In addition, these
schools are all located in a big
population area."
Big populations areas mean
big crowds, which in turn
means big gate receipts. Ruetz
is not shy in admitting that
there is a financial side in set
ting up the schedule.
"There is a dollar implica
tion," Ruetz said. "Football is
the big income-producing
sport for our other sports.
"We look at a school's pat
tern of gate receipts," Ruetz
continued. "There is no sense

in scheduling a Ball State

ceipts and it costs you $50,000

no way of predicting, nor does
anyone else for that matter,
how good a team will be next
week, regardless of 1991. If
anyone does, please call this
writer about a field trip to Las
Vegas.
With all those variables, why
are schools all over the country
booked solidly for the next 10
years? Ruetz doesn't profess to
have the answer, he just plays
the game.
"I kinda think it's silly, but
everybody does it," Ruetz ad
mitted. "If you don't schedule
a team far in advance, some
body else has them informally
scheduled and you're out of
business."
Because of the rush to
schedule, trying to fill an open
date in any of the next five
years would "face the problem
of not having any good teams
left," Ruetz said.
Some problems can't be av
oided. The deal that brought
Pac-10 brethren Arizona and
Arizona State into the fold was
hailed by everyone from the

school presidents to the
coaches. Everyone, that is, ex
cept the athletic directors.
When a school is brought
into a conference, there is usu
ally a 5-to-10 year grace period
in which schedules are rear
ranged and the "new boy in
class" can get accustomed to
all the new faces. With the
Arizona schools, the deal was
consummated only last year,
and they are playing a confer
ence schedule one year later.
"The problems caused were
so enormous that the schools
presidents did not want to get
involved," Ruetz said.
Every school had certain
traditions they wanted to keep,
and Stanford was no excep
tion.
"We always like to play Cal at
the end of the year," Ruetz
said. "We certainly didn't want
to switch them to the f i rst game
of the year.
"We wanted to keep USC
and UCLA on our schedule,
too, because of the downstate
rivalry and the big crowd they
always draw," Ruetz added.
There are over 130 schools
which field Division I football
teams, but Stanford can only
schedule 11 per year. Ruetz
outlined the criteria he uses in
filling those open Saturdays.
"Ideally, we like to schedule
the teams from the Big Ten,"
Ruetz said. "Schools such as
Michigan, Wisconsin and Il
linois are philosophically
closer to the Pac-10 schools in
academics. In addition, these
schools are all located in a big
population area."
Big populations areas mean
big crowds, which in turn
means big gate receipts. Ruetz
is not shy in admitting that
there is a financial side in set
ting up the schedule.
"There is a dollar implica
tion," Ruetz said. "Football is
the big income-producing
sport for our other sports.
"We look at a school's pat
tern of gate receipts," Ruetz
continued. "There is no sense

in scheduling a Ball State
where you get $5OOO in gate re
ceipts and it costs you $50,000
to go out there."
Being a West Coast school
can be hazardous in schedul
ing intersectional games. Add
that to the peculiarities of the
Bay Area, and they put re
straints on the schools to
schedule.
"Early in the season, we are
at a disadvantage," Ruetz said.
"We don't attract a great
number of people from the Bay
Area." In order to get a big
gate, it is usually necessary to
start on the road.
"If a team seems to be
alumni-supported, then we
will schedule them here. Ok
lahoma brought out 10,000
people this year," Ruetz said.
"But Michigan doesn't have
that support. We would be
lucky to get 40,000 here, where
we would get 100,000 if we
played them out there."
A Michigan or an Oklahoma
can also catch the attention of
ABC-TV, which would mean "a
significant amount of money
forour program. We are always
scheduling with the possibility
of a TV appearance in our
mind," Ruetz said.
The problems of scheduling
so far in advance can be seen in
full by glancing at Stanford's
schedules for 1975 and for next
year, 1979.
"An athletic director can
overschedule as we did in
1975," Ruetz said. "We played
Penn State and Michigan in a
row. (Stanford lost to Penn
State 34-14 and tied Michigan
19-19. Both games were on the
road.) It had a deleterious ef
fect on the attitude of our
players."
Next year Stanford opens the
season with Tulane, then plays
San Jose State, Army and Bos
ton College. Face it, they don't
exactly bring to mind Ok
lahoma, Penn State, Alabama
and Nebraska.
Sometimes there is a re
medy, if you can find a team
who has the opposite problem
that you have.
"Washington State's
schedule for the 1980 season
opened with Tennessee, Ok
lahoma and USC. We were
scheduled to start with Tulane,
Army and San Jose State (and
Oregon and Boston College),"
Ruetz said.
"We needed a good interse-

ctional game, and so we went
to Washington State and made
the switch, Oklahoma for
Army," Ruetz said.
Ruetz called a good
schedule a "very valuable re
cruiting tool."
"We play in the toughest
conference in the country. If
we can get one good intersec
tional game, it gives the players
a chance to see whether they
measure up," Ruetz said.
Take a glance at the next six
years' schedule. Add future
contests with Notre Dame,
Texas, Baylor and Kansas, and
it is easy to see that the Cards of
the future will be doing plenty
of measuring up in the years
ahead.

1984? Don't be so shocked,
for not only is Stanford's
datebook filled up through
1984, but Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz is currently working on
the schedule for 1991.
"When I came here seven
years ago," Ruetz said, "our
schedule was full through
1985."
Certainly there are no im
mediate advantages in
scheduling a game 13 years
hence. No one knows how
good Stanford will be, nor who
will be wearing the Cardinal
and Cream then (Jim Plunkett,
Jr. might be quarterbacking,
and Head Coach Bill Walsh's
seven-year-old daughter
Elizabeth may be a Stanford
Dolly).
