## Prop. 6 deserves defeat 
### 
(Ed. note: This is the first seg
ment of a two part series. Part
two will appear tomorrow.)
Proposition 6, written by
state Sen. John Briggs, is now
before us in the "California
Voters Pamphlet." When it ap
pears on the November 7 bal
lot, it is crucial that every regis
tered voter in this community,
whether his or her attitude to
wards homosexuality, should
be in the booth to vote "no."
Briggs' initiative would em
power local school boards to
refuse to hire any teacher and
to fire any teacher whose be
havior bears certain relation
ships to homosexuality de
fined in the initiative. I worded
that previous sentence care
fully because, as I will point out
later, heterosexuals as well as
homosexuals could be the ob
ject of discrimination if this in
itiative should pass.
< Consider the existing laws
on the subject. Section 44836
of the California Education
Code directs school boards not
to hire or retain persons con
victed of, among other sex of
fenses, sodomy or oral copula
tion, whether heterosexual or
homosexual, prior to the legis
lative year 1975-76. These are
the offenses to which Sections

286 and 288 of the Penal Code,
cited in the initiative, refer. In
1975-76 such acts between
consenting adults in private
became legal in this state and
are no longer grounds for re
jection or dismissal by school
boards.
Section 44837 directs school
boards not to hire or retain a
sexual psychopath.
Section 44932 lists the
grounds for dismissing a
teacher. Relevant to this issue
are immoral or unprofessional
conduct, evident unfitness for
service, a physical or mental
condition making the teacher
unfit to instruct or associate
with students, conviction of a
felony, and conviction of any
crime involving moral tur
pitude.
Section 44933 provides for
dismissal on grounds of unpro
fessional conduct other than
those listed in 44932, with the
stipulation that a charge
against a teacher shall specify
instances of behavior deemed
to constitute unprofessional
conduct.
Surely the particularity of the
references to sexual acts in
44836 and the generally
worded grounds for dismissal
in 44932 give school boards all

the powers they need to deal
with teachers whose
homosexual behavior endan
gers students.
Briggs thinks otherwise. He
would add an amendment
concerning hiring to 44837 and
an amendment concerning fir
ing to 44933. Both additions in
volve two categories of be
havior: what Briggs calls "pub
lic homosexual activity" and
"public homosexual conduct."
The first category aims at ac
tivity "which is not discreet and
practiced in private, whether
or not such act, at the time of
its commission, constituted a
crime." It is difficult to see how
this category adds anything to
existing law: a public act of
sodomy would be grounds for
dismissal as "immoral con
duct"; and, if the agent were
caught by the police and con
victed, he or she would be
dismissed on the ground of
conviction of a crime involving
moral turpitude.
An example may clarify the
importance of "discreet" and
the probably thrust of this sec
tion of the initiative. Larry
Berner is a second-grade
teacher in Healdsburg,
Sonoma County. In an article
about Proposition 6 for the
Sonoma County Lesbian and
Gay Alliance News, Berner said
he was a homosexual. A col
umnist for a Healdsburg news
paper drew attention to that
fact. Then some parents ap
pealed to the school board,
four of whose members have
consequently given public
support to Briggs' initiative as
the only way to get rid of
Berner.
Although Berner, in his op
position to the initiative, has
recently become an outspoken
advocate of allowing
homosexuals to teach in
schools and hence (presuma
bly in Briggs' view), an advo
cate of homosexuality, nothing
in the early stages of the case
suggests any tendency on
Berner's part to "advocate."
One of his most ardent
enemies concedes that Berner
has never discussed homosex
uality in the classroom. I think
that, in Briggs' view, Berner's
statement that he was a
homosexual turned his dis
creet and private activity into
"indiscreet" and "public" ac
tivity as defined in the initia
tive, and that Berner and
people like him are the reason
for Briggs 'introducing this first
category.

dismissal as "immoral con
duct"; and, if the agent were
caught by the police and con
victed, he or she would be
dismissed on the ground of
conviction of a crime involving
moral turpitude.
An example may clarify the
importance of "discreet" and
the probably thrust of this sec
tion of the initiative. Larry
Berner is a second-grade
teacher in Healdsburg,
Sonoma County. In an article
about Proposition 6 for the
Sonoma County Lesbian and
Gay Alliance News, Berner said
he was a homosexual. A col
umnist for a Healdsburg news
paper drew attention to that
fact. Then some parents ap
pealed to the school board,
four of whose members have
consequently given public
support to Briggs' initiative as
the only way to get rid of
Berner.
Although Berner, in his op
position to the initiative, has
recently become an outspoken
advocate of allowing
homosexuals to teach in
schools and hence (presuma
bly in Briggs' view), an advo
cate of homosexuality, nothing
in the early stages of the case
suggests any tendency on
Berner's part to "advocate."
One of his most ardent
enemies concedes that Berner
has never discussed homosex
uality in the classroom. I think
that, in Briggs' view, Berner's
statement that he was a
homosexual turned his dis
creet and private activity into
"indiscreet" and "public" ac
tivity as defined in the initia
tive, and that Berner and
people like him are the reason
for Briggs 'introducing this first
category.

Proposition 6, written by
state Sen. John Briggs, is now
before us in the "California
Voters Pamphlet." When it ap
pears on the November 7 bal
lot, it is crucial that every regis
tered voter in this community,
whether his or her attitude to
wards homosexuality, should
be in the booth to vote "no."
Briggs' initiative would em
power local school boards to
refuse to hire any teacher and
to fire any teacher whose be
havior bears certain relation
ships to homosexuality de
fined in the initiative. I worded
that previous sentence care
fully because, as I will point out
later, heterosexuals as well as
homosexuals could be the ob
ject of discrimination if this in
itiative should pass.
< Consider the existing laws
on the subject. Section 44836
of the California Education
Code directs school boards not
to hire or retain persons con
victed of, among other sex of
fenses, sodomy or oral copula
tion, whether heterosexual or
homosexual, prior to the legis
lative year 1975-76. These are
the offenses to which Sections

286 and 288 of the Penal Code,
cited in the initiative, refer. In
1975-76 such acts between
consenting adults in private
became legal in this state and
are no longer grounds for re
jection or dismissal by school
boards.
Section 44837 directs school
boards not to hire or retain a
sexual psychopath.
Section 44932 lists the
grounds for dismissing a
teacher. Relevant to this issue
are immoral or unprofessional
conduct, evident unfitness for
service, a physical or mental
condition making the teacher
unfit to instruct or associate
with students, conviction of a
felony, and conviction of any
crime involving moral tur
pitude.
Section 44933 provides for
dismissal on grounds of unpro
fessional conduct other than
those listed in 44932, with the
stipulation that a charge
against a teacher shall specify
instances of behavior deemed
to constitute unprofessional
conduct.
Surely the particularity of the
references to sexual acts in
44836 and the generally
worded grounds for dismissal
in 44932 give school boards all

the powers they need to deal
with teachers whose
homosexual behavior endan
gers students.
Briggs thinks otherwise. He
would add an amendment
concerning hiring to 44837 and
an amendment concerning fir
ing to 44933. Both additions in
volve two categories of be
havior: what Briggs calls "pub
lic homosexual activity" and
"public homosexual conduct."
The first category aims at ac
tivity "which is not discreet and
practiced in private, whether
or not such act, at the time of
its commission, constituted a
crime." It is difficult to see how
this category adds anything to
existing law: a public act of
sodomy would be grounds for
dismissal as "immoral con
duct"; and, if the agent were
caught by the police and con
victed, he or she would be
dismissed on the ground of
