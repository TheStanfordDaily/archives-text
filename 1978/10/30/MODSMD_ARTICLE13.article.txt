## Calvo avoids debating issues 
### 
To the ancient Greeks, one-on-one de
bate between candidates for office was the
highest form of political art. Too often our
own democratic process, because its scale
is so relatively huge, is hindered by super
ficiality, double-talk, and evasion of the
issues. This is why real debates, where as
pirants can encounter one another di
rectly, are so much more important for us.
And all in all, few things in polities can
come close to matching them in excite
ment or usefulness.
Vic Calvo, our incumbent assembly
man, has up till now, never been seriously
challenged for re-election. His first at
tempt was his hardest: a two-to-one vic
tory. Since then things have been even
easier. Maybe this is one reason why he
consistently shies from personal debates
with his opponents on the issues.
But this year's campaign is different. The
local race for Sacramento is hot, as are the
issues. Money, the elixir of present-day
politics, is pouring in: a combined total of
around $200,000 will be spent by the two
candidates to ensure that we decide
wisely.
In the face of such a strong challenge,
Calvo's insistent refusal to meet his oppo
nent one-on-one in an open forum begs
some obvious questions. Is it because he
scorns Greg Morris as unworthy and irres
ponsible? Does he think his constituents
don't deserve to see him actively pressed
by an opponent on the issues and his
Or is he simply content to play the
old-style politician, occasionally partaking
in the sterility of the candidates' forum,
but otherwise resting sedately on past
majorities and present apathy?
Unfortunately, there is some truth to
each of the above, as I personally found in
my own effort to set up a Calvo-Morris
debate as part of the American Studies
House theme. By the time Calvo came to
visit, it was all too apparent just how he
and his workers had once again managed
to evade an open, one-on-one debate,
while fostering the notion that he does
indeed do this.
From the start, I had no high hopes
about our own chances, based on the

snubs Calvo has given other community
groups trying to schedule debates.
For instance, late this past summer the
Palo Alto Jaycees tried for a time to set up a
Calvo-Morris encounter. Wendy Bell, a
nurse at Stanford Hospital, was in charge
of contacting the candidates. Encouraged
by the "anytime, anywhere" promise from
Morris, she called Calvo's office and gave
three possible dates when the jaycees
could accommodate the two of them. Ac
cording to his staff, Calvo was "too busy"
to make any of them.
Bell countered with "you name a date."
The staff member replied that her boss
"had already done several debates," and
promised someone would call her back.
No one ever did.
For Bell and the Jaycees, this unde
served slight was distressing. But more ob
jectionable was the false claim to having
already debated. For the record plainly
shows otherwise. All the joint appear
ances the two have made were within the
sanitized framework of "candidates'
nights." In this type of forum, many can
didates for various offices in turn answer a
set of pre-screened questions. Such a set
ting definitely does not allow for free ex
chagnes between two candidates; cer
tainly they do not qualify as debates, in the
Brown-Younger or even Gregorio-Garcia
sense.
Merle Bre'ndler, government affairs
vice-president of the Sunnyvale Chamber
of Commerce, had a similar experience.
She began trying to get Calvo to debate
Morris at one of the Chamber's "hot-seat"
luncheons in mid-summer. After being
routed round and round, she finally gave
up in mid-September, at which point
Calvo was still "too busy"; according to
his staff, he was also concerned that "the
public would be bored" by yet another
debate.
And as the race tightens toward the
finish, the Calvo campaign continues to
talk from two mouths. My own effort to set
up a debate shows this clearly.
My conversation with challenger Greg
Morris was quick and to the point: he
would debate "anytime, anywhere," and

would juggle his own cramped scheduhe
to accomodate Calvo.
Not surprisingly, the story was different
on the other side. Calvo campaign man
ager Dottie Comstock patiently explained
how busy the assemblyman was. She was
also very frank: there would be no debate.
"Vic doesn't like big events, crowds, 0r
public confrontation. He prefers small
groups, to operate one-on-one."
I asked if he would come alone, and she
promised to call me back.
My next contact was a visit at the house,
where a campaign worker tried to makie
me promise, among other things, that if
Calvo came, everything would be very low
key. He told me he feared that too much
publicity might entice Morris to make a
surprise appearance.
I went ahead and planned a Calvo visit
with Comstock. She reiterated that Calvo
wanted no publicity; the visit was for
house members â€” small groups of them in
a barbeque-type format. I even had to
persuade her to ask Calvo to start with"a
short talk tothe wholegroup, so members
would feel comfortable in approaching
him during dinner.
But two days before Calvo's appear
ance, when all the details were planned to
his stated preference, his mood appa
rently changed. Comstock called, hoping I
could set up some sort of "press confer
ence" so Calvo could get "maximum
coverage" out of his visit. Next, a second
campaign worker called, asking about
how we could get "campus-wide public
ity" for the event. I told her flatly that it was
too late; this should have been made clear
before. And that if he were really in
terested in a big turnout, he should have
consented to a debate. j
In all these cases, people have been
needlessly offended and Calvo's own re
cord of public service stained, a record he
ought to be willing to defend openly
against his opposition, if he feels he de
serves another term. Otherwise, it's time
for a change.
