McCloskey's
remarks
unbelievable
I sincerely hope that Con
gressman Pete McCloskey's
views {Daily, Oct. 23) were the
victims of gross misrepresenta
tion. The thought that anyone
could possibly make such an
unbelievably inane series of
remarks during the course of a
single speech is utterly incon
ceivable to me, particularly
when this individual is sup
posed to represent his con
stituents in Congress (al
though, I guess even members
of Congress are periodically
subject to dementia).
I will gladly concede
McCloskey's claim that we
should not let the U.S. Army
become the employer of exc
lusively minority group mem
bers. However, how can any
one possibly miss the prejudi
cial overtones of McCloskey's
following his initial statement
that, "You can't find any
reasonable young men in the
military now," with the asser
tion that, "What we're seeing
now is a growth in the
minorities in U.S. forces."
McCloskey's implication of
the cause-and-effect relation
ship between these two state
ments is too obvious to ignore:
the army should not have a
disproportionately large
number of minority group
members, not (as some might
claim) because this situation
would denote a limited
number of opportunities for
them in other vocations, but
rather because blacks,
Chicanos and other minority
ethnic groups are not "reason
able." If McCloskey is rep
resentative of Congress as a
whole, I would venture to say
that the army is not the only

government institution around
these days that suffers from
lack of men capable of exercis
ing the powers of reasoning.
Furthermore, the claim that
he uses to lend some validity to
this insupportable argument
about the dangers of an "all
black army," the accusation
that, "the Mafia was able to
maintain its political and finan
cial success by infiltrating the
New York Police Department,"
is at best, a glaring example of
non sequitur or, more likely, a
slap on the face directed at all
minority group members.
Can this man actually believe
that when any given minority
group converges in any sig
nificant number in any one
place, that an organization
such as the Mafia is necessarily
the result? May I remind you,
that crime is not monopolized
by minorities: the escapades of
a recent presidential administ
ration should convince you of
this fact.
After hearing of McCloskey's
nauseating attempt to conceal
his remarkably less than con
genial sentiments toward
ethnic minorities under the
guise of concern for national
defense, it comes as no great
surprise to hear him accuse the
Republican Party of being "de
void of thought." May I com
mend you on your amazing
perspicacity and excellent
analysis, Mr. McCloskey, al
though, you being one of this
intellectual void's most lavish
and frequent contributors,
presumably itwould have been
difficult for this to escape your
notice.

McCloskey
responds
I write in response to the
{Daily, Oct. 24) article in which
I was quoted as citing the dan
gers of an all-black army. This
particular quote should be
taken in the context of the en
tire discussion of the subject,
which lasted over an hour.
My principle concern is the
lack of combat-readiness in to
day's volunteer army, and the
failure of the current law to
give us a combat-ready army.
My opinion on this issue is
most clearly defined by a quo
tation of mine which appeared
the same day in the San Fran
cisco Examiner that the volun
teer army is "beginning to re
flect an imbalance in the
number of minorities in the en
listed ranks."
You may recall that during
the Vietnam war, minority
casualties in the combat units
were over twice the ratio of
minorities to the general popu
lation. Clearly minorities bore
the brunt of our wartime
casualties, and are today mak
ing up an unduly large propor
tion of our combat units. I
think this is both unfair and
unwise.
I would feel a great deal bet
ter if the combat infantry units
were made up of an approp
riate cross-section of American
young people . . . including
those qualified to attend Stan
ford University, as well as
those whose social and educa
tional background make them
unable to finish high school or
obtain high-level employment.
The successful defense of our
country requires the participa
tion of more men and women

with high school and college
educations. I am proposing
consideration of reinstituting
the draft because I think the
nation is better served if its
army is composed of reluctant
citizen-soldiers rather than
only those who can't get a job
elsewhere.
The quotation which the
Daily reporter chose to em
phasize should be taken in
context with these views, and I
welcome your attendance at
the Stanford debate on the
same subject on November'l
when I will try to lay out my
concerns with the present
"all-volunteer, all-professional
army" in more detail.

bers. However, how can any
one possibly miss the prejudi
cial overtones of McCloskey's
following his initial statement
that, "You can't find any
reasonable young men in the
military now," with the asser
tion that, "What we're seeing
now is a growth in the
minorities in U.S. forces."
McCloskey's implication of
the cause-and-effect relation
ship between these two state
ments is too obvious to ignore:
the army should not have a
disproportionately large
number of minority group
members, not (as some might
claim) because this situation
would denote a limited
number of opportunities for
them in other vocations, but
rather because blacks,
Chicanos and other minority
ethnic groups are not "reason
able." If McCloskey is rep
resentative of Congress as a
whole, I would venture to say
that the army is not the only

government institution around
these days that suffers from
lack of men capable of exercis
ing the powers of reasoning.
Furthermore, the claim that
he uses to lend some validity to
this insupportable argument
about the dangers of an "all
black army," the accusation
that, "the Mafia was able to
maintain its political and finan
cial success by infiltrating the
New York Police Department,"
is at best, a glaring example of
non sequitur or, more likely, a
slap on the face directed at all
minority group members.
Can this man actually believe
that when any given minority
group converges in any sig
nificant number in any one
place, that an organization
such as the Mafia is necessarily
the result? May I remind you,
that crime is not monopolized
by minorities: the escapades of
a recent presidential administ
ration should convince you of
this fact.
After hearing of McCloskey's
nauseating attempt to conceal
his remarkably less than con
genial sentiments toward
ethnic minorities under the
guise of concern for national
defense, it comes as no great
surprise to hear him accuse the
Republican Party of being "de
void of thought." May I com
mend you on your amazing
perspicacity and excellent
analysis, Mr. McCloskey, al
though, you being one of this
intellectual void's most lavish
and frequent contributors,
presumably itwould have been

McCloskey
responds
I write in response to the
{Daily, Oct. 24) article in which
I was quoted as citing the dan
gers of an all-black army. This
particular quote should be
taken in the context of the en
tire discussion of the subject,
which lasted over an hour.
My principle concern is the
lack of combat-readiness in to
day's volunteer army, and the
failure of the current law to
give us a combat-ready army.
My opinion on this issue is
most clearly defined by a quo
tation of mine which appeared
the same day in the San Fran
cisco Examiner that the volun
teer army is "beginning to re
flect an imbalance in the
number of minorities in the en
listed ranks."
You may recall that during
the Vietnam war, minority
casualties in the combat units
were over twice the ratio of
minorities to the general popu
lation. Clearly minorities bore
the brunt of our wartime
casualties, and are today mak
ing up an unduly large propor
tion of our combat units. I
think this is both unfair and
unwise.
I would feel a great deal bet
ter if the combat infantry units
were made up of an approp
riate cross-section of American
young people . . . including
those qualified to attend Stan
ford University, as well as
those whose social and educa
tional background make them
unable to finish high school or
obtain high-level employment.
The successful defense of our
country requires the participa
tion of more men and women

with high school and college
educations. I am proposing
consideration of reinstituting
the draft because I think the
nation is better served if its
army is composed of reluctant
citizen-soldiers rather than
only those who can't get a job
elsewhere.
The quotation which the
Daily reporter chose to em
phasize should be taken in

Chicanos and other minority
ethnic groups are not "reason
able." If McCloskey is rep
resentative of Congress as a
whole, I would venture to say
that the army is not the only

government institution around
these days that suffers from
lack of men capable of exercis
ing the powers of reasoning.
Furthermore, the claim that
he uses to lend some validity to
this insupportable argument
about the dangers of an "all
black army," the accusation
that, "the Mafia was able to
maintain its political and finan
cial success by infiltrating the
New York Police Department,"
is at best, a glaring example of
non sequitur or, more likely, a
slap on the face directed at all
minority group members.
Can this man actually believe
that when any given minority
group converges in any sig
nificant number in any one
place, that an organization
such as the Mafia is necessarily
the result? May I remind you,
that crime is not monopolized
by minorities: the escapades of
a recent presidential administ
ration should convince you of
this fact.
After hearing of McCloskey's
nauseating attempt to conceal
his remarkably less than con
genial sentiments toward
ethnic minorities under the
guise of concern for national
defense, it comes as no great
surprise to hear him accuse the
Republican Party of being "de
void of thought." May I com
mend you on your amazing
perspicacity and excellent
analysis, Mr. McCloskey, al
though, you being one of this
intellectual void's most lavish
and frequent contributors,
presumably itwould have been
difficult for this to escape your
notice.

McCloskey
responds
I write in response to the
{Daily, Oct. 24) article in which
I was quoted as citing the dan
gers of an all-black army. This
particular quote should be
taken in the context of the en
tire discussion of the subject,
which lasted over an hour.
My principle concern is the
lack of combat-readiness in to
day's volunteer army, and the
failure of the current law to
give us a combat-ready army.
My opinion on this issue is
most clearly defined by a quo
tation of mine which appeared
the same day in the San Fran
cisco Examiner that the volun
teer army is "beginning to re
flect an imbalance in the
number of minorities in the en
listed ranks."
You may recall that during
the Vietnam war, minority
casualties in the combat units
were over twice the ratio of
minorities to the general popu
lation. Clearly minorities bore
the brunt of our wartime
casualties, and are today mak
ing up an unduly large propor
tion of our combat units. I
think this is both unfair and
unwise.
I would feel a great deal bet
ter if the combat infantry units
were made up of an approp
riate cross-section of American
young people . . . including
those qualified to attend Stan
ford University, as well as
those whose social and educa
tional background make them
unable to finish high school or
obtain high-level employment.
The successful defense of our
country requires the participa
tion of more men and women

with high school and college
educations. I am proposing
consideration of reinstituting
the draft because I think the
nation is better served if its
army is composed of reluctant
citizen-soldiers rather than
only those who can't get a job
elsewhere.
The quotation which the
Daily reporter chose to em
phasize should be taken in
context with these views, and I
welcome your attendance at
the Stanford debate on the
same subject on November'l
when I will try to lay out my
concerns with the present
"all-volunteer, all-professional
army" in more detail.

McCloskey's
remarks
unbelievable
I sincerely hope that Con
gressman Pete McCloskey's
views {Daily, Oct. 23) were the
victims of gross misrepresenta
tion. The thought that anyone
could possibly make such an
unbelievably inane series of
remarks during the course of a
single speech is utterly incon
ceivable to me, particularly
when this individual is sup
posed to represent his con
stituents in Congress (al
though, I guess even members
of Congress are periodically
subject to dementia).
I will gladly concede
McCloskey's claim that we
should not let the U.S. Army
become the employer of exc
lusively minority group mem
bers. However, how can any
one possibly miss the prejudi
cial overtones of McCloskey's
following his initial statement
that, "You can't find any
reasonable young men in the
military now," with the asser
tion that, "What we're seeing
now is a growth in the
minorities in U.S. forces."
McCloskey's implication of
the cause-and-effect relation
ship between these two state
ments is too obvious to ignore:
the army should not have a
disproportionately large
number of minority group
members, not (as some might
claim) because this situation
would denote a limited
number of opportunities for
them in other vocations, but
rather because blacks,
Chicanos and other minority
ethnic groups are not "reason
able." If McCloskey is rep
resentative of Congress as a
whole, I would venture to say
that the army is not the only

government institution around
these days that suffers from
lack of men capable of exercis
ing the powers of reasoning.
