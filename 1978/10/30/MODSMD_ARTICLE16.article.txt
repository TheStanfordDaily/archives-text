# Rare, original books treasured here

"The linear accelerator of
the humanities" is what one
history professor here has cal
led the University's Depart
ment of Special Collections.
The Bender room on the top
floor of Green Library is the
scholar's laboratory. The
500,000 manuscripts and
books, some of which date
from 200 8.C., are his instru
ments.
The impressive collection of
rare books and manuscripts
had humble beginnings. In
1933 Nathan Van Patten, direc
tor of the University library
then, collected the University's
5000 scattered rare books and
placed them in an unused
seminar room on the top floor
of the library, later named the
Bender room for Albert A.
Bender, who had given many
of his books to the University
collection.
In addition to manuscripts,
prints, maps and photographs,
the collection now contains
over 60,000 books divided into
the general rare book collec
tion, the Felton Library of
British and American litera
ture, the Cunst Library on the
book arts, the Brasch collec
tion on Sir Isaac Newton and
the reference collection. The
materials are housed in the
Bender room and closed stacks
in the upper floors of Green
Library.
Though other universities
have rare book collections,

"Stanford's is distinctive be
cause of the depth of mate
rial," Florian Shaksy, chief of
special collections, said.
Original copies of Diderot's
Encyclopedic and Newton's
Principia are housed in the col
lection as are over 1000 Stein
beck letters and complete first
edition collections of D.H.
Lawrence and W. Somerset
Maugham.
"Some areas are truly out
standing," Shasky said. In
cluded in the major author col
lections of the Felton Library
are rare copies of works by
Hemingway, Whitman, Frost,
Dickens, Joyce, Yeats and
others.
The incunabulum collection,
which includes books printed
before 1501, contains the first
illustrated history of the world
from 1493 and the earliest illus
trated travel book, 1486. Many
other "firsts are housed
there," Shasky said.
Though the collections are
primarily used by faculty and
graduate students, they are av
ailable to undergraduates.
"We ask that the person is a
qualified researcher. No
browsing is allowed. The per
son must have not only the in
terest but the need for the
material," Shasky said. He
added that he was impressed
by the "intelligent and creative
use" of the collections by un
dergraduates.
Shasky said that interested
students are welcome to visit

the Bender room and discuss
their projects with librarians
there. "The more we know
about the research of our clien
tele, the more we can help
them," he said.
The Special Collections De
partment also provides an in
formal reference service,
Shasky said. "If a student can't
find an unusual book he needs
badly we can often locate and
obtain the book. Just because
you can't find it doesn't mean it
isn't here," he added.
The acquisition process is
"very complicated," Shasky
said. "We rely heavily on the
gifts of materials." The de

partment entertains requests
from faculty for books and
other materials. "We try to ac
quire the material most useful
to the students.
"The collection aims to
complement and extend the
research capabilities of the
University," Shasky said. He
added that primary sources are
useful to the young scholar.
"You get a keen sense of the
culture and the style of the
period from original manus
cripts."
The Bender room features
approximately four exhibitions
each year which "try to provide
an idea of the scope of our col

lection" by exhibiting books
and materials from the collec
tion, Shasky said. An exhibi
tion entitled "First Editions
from Private Presses" is cur
rently being prepared for pub
lic display.
Important literary works
exhibited are to be examples of
the "book arts," such as print
ing, binding and illustration.
"Students have no real idea of
how things can be done unless
they see them," Shasky said.
A visit to the Bender room is
a strong reminder that not only
the content of a book, but the
book itself, can be a work of
art.
