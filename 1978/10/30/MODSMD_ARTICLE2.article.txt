# Facilities protests by Hospital nurses may be nearing end

University Hospital administrators
here agreed Friday to provide addi
tional space and cleaning services for
the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. In
response a nurses' representative
said she was "optimistic" that 46 of
the unit's nurses would either re
scind their threats to resign or with
draw their resignations effective
Nov. 7, sometime next week.
Nurses' supeivisor Cecele Quain
tance added that "the threat of resig
nation is old already."
After Friday's meeting, Hospital
Administrator Gary Mecklenberg
and other administrators gave
nurses' representatives a written
pledge, requested by the nurses, to
start tearing down interior walls in
the unit on Wednesday to provide
more space. Administrators also
promised to provide the unit with
24-hour cleaning service, a parental
consultation room and a storage
closet by Nov. 13.
Dramatize need
To dramatize the need for more
doctors and space in the unit, J4 of
the 50 nurses either threatened to
resign or submitted resignations
Oct. 20. They later were joined by 12
more nurses. As a result of a meeting
between administrators and nurses
last Monday, an additional doctor
was assigned to the unit during the
evenings.
"I'm very hopeful that the nurses
are satisfied that we're concerned
with the same things they are," said
Mecklenberg. "If there are remain-

ing issues, we'll be more than happy
to talk to them, but I don't know of
anything else majoron the horizon."
The nurses' representative, who
wished to remain anonymous, said
that all the nurses would be briefed
on the administrators' proposal by
this afternoon, and a staff meeting is
planned for tonight or Tuesday.
Optimistic about us
"I'm very optimistic about us with
drawing our resignations sometime
next week," the nurse said. "They've
(the administration) come through
on all the issues we've been talking
about for the last several months,
and if there's anything else, I don't
know what it would be."
Mecklenberg said that construc
tion of a new building for the nursery
is scheduled to begin sometime next
year, but the nurse said she believed
it would be "several years" before
the $1.5 million expansion would be
finished. However, the remodeling
work in the present unit is expected
to be completed in a few months.
"We wanted substantive changes
next week . . . now . . . and it will be
real nice to get those walls down,"
the nurse added.
"We won't mind the noise â€” we'll
be cheering them (the workers who
start the remodeling) on. I really
think we'll have a ceremony with a
sledge-hammer so that everyone
gets a crack at the walls.
"It will be very therapeutic, be
cause people have been talking
about those walls for a long time,"
the nurse added.
