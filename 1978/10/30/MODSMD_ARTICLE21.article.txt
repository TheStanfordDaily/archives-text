# Despite high quitting rates, internal quarrels
## Yell leaders look for acceptance here 
### STEPHANIE POGGI 
Stanford cheerleaders could no more
make it past the gates of the University
stadium than beer now can. But yell
leaders? A co-ed group here wants
"spirit to reign at the games." The
group thinks yell leading is a means to
encourage that end.
But the squad has had problems
since its members were chosen last Ap
ril. Lack of enthusiasm among squad
members, internal quarrels, and a high
quitting rate are some of the difficulties
this year's yell leaders have faced.
Winners of the yell leader competi
tion, by virtue of their superior lung
power and high spirits, were sopho
mores Sue Goldtarb, Laurie Ostendorf,
Doug Greenfield, and Martin Pena.
Also selected were juniors Seth Ellison
and Karen Brower. Already half have
quit the squad.
Enthusiasm for the group was "sky
high" before tryouts, as one yell leader
said. Prospects for a wild yelling season
couldn't have looked better. Approxi
mately 20 students auditioned for the
six open positions. Each did a three to
five minute act, encouraging audience
participation. Then the prospective
members were judged by former Dol

lies and yell leaders, bandsmen, KZSU
representatives and athletes. I he six
elected members hardly knew one
another, but they hoped that after
creating routines, they woi'ld perform
and work well together.
The first blow to the group came after
auditions, before spring quarter en
ded. Ellison decided not to return here
this year. The other yell leaders were
still counting on a group of five when
Ostendorf bowed out after the Ok
lahoma football game this year. Before
the Caids played Tulane Pena had also
quit.
Three yell leaders remained. "A big
change of plans had to be made,
Brower said, fhe spell-out requires at
least five people. For the spell-out, yell
leaders lie on the ground, forming in
sequence, the letters S-1 -A-N-F-O-R-D.
At the Tulane game, yellers were forced
to use stuffed dummies in place qf
people. "There's really nothing you can
do with three people," Goldfarb said.
But why were only three leaders left?
Part of the problem was "a drift as far as
philosophies went," Pena, who quit,
said. He said that some of the other
leaders "wanted him to be a yell leader
first and a student second. I just didn't

see that as viable," he added.
Pena also mentioned "a lot of per
sonality conflicts" which accounted for
the team break-up. Ostendorf, another
member who quit, agreed.
"The yell leaders are all very different
people. It was often hard for us to agree
and work together," she said.
Following the mishap at the Tulane
game, the remaining three yell leaders
called an emergency meeting with their
adviser, Gary Cavalli, director of sports
publicity. Dispensing with the audi
tions procedure, each yell leader re
cruited replacements personally.
Sophomore Rico Hernandez and junior
Rob Kinsey joined the squad just in time
for the Cards' match-up vyith UCLA. Al
though Hernandez is still a yell leader,
it was Kinsey's first and last game. He
said he still supports yell leaders but his
academic load was too heavy. He also
said he "wanted to see a little more
innovation" in the routines.
Sophomore Ann Ezra joined the
group for the Washington game but
also quit immediately afterwards. "It
was a little bit unnerving. I wasn't really
comfortable up front," she said. Appa
rently it takes a particular kind of per
sonality to enjoy yell leading. "You

have to like the limelight. W-e're all
hams in a way," said DougGreenfield, <■
member who is determined to stay with
the group.
Senior Leslie Torvik is the latest and
probably last addition to this year's
squad. Brower says the team "will tryto
make it with five people this year.''
Still, problems remain. The members
don't feel ac cepted as a legitimate spirit
group by the student body.
"It's cool to put yell leaders down at
Stanford," Goldfarb said. Unlike the
Band, which has a definite place here,
the yell leaders have not established
themselves.
"We're still waiting to see what
they're going to do," Alex Jardetsky,
band manager, said.
But the yell leaders are still trying.
The current group thinks what they do
is worthwhile. "I see it as a challenge.
We have to work at it," said Hernandez.
Greenfield agreed that its not easy to
make yell leading a success. "There's a
lot of competition out on the field and a
lot of campus heroes in the Band. But
we fill in the gaps," he said.
"We're out there to make people
laugh and have a good time," Goldfarb
said. "I think we ( an do it."

Part of the problem was "a drift as far as
philosophies went," Pena, who quit,
said. He said that some of the other
leaders "wanted him to be a yell leader
first and a student second. I just didn't

see that as viable," he added.
Pena also mentioned "a lot of per
sonality conflicts" which accounted for
the team break-up. Ostendorf, another
member who quit, agreed.
"The yell leaders are all very different
people. It was often hard for us to agree
and work together," she said.
Following the mishap at the Tulane
game, the remaining three yell leaders
called an emergency meeting with their
adviser, Gary Cavalli, director of sports
publicity. Dispensing with the audi
tions procedure, each yell leader re
cruited replacements personally.
Sophomore Rico Hernandez and junior
Rob Kinsey joined the squad just in time
for the Cards' match-up vyith UCLA. Al
though Hernandez is still a yell leader,
it was Kinsey's first and last game. He
said he still supports yell leaders but his
academic load was too heavy. He also
said he "wanted to see a little more
innovation" in the routines.
Sophomore Ann Ezra joined the
group for the Washington game but
also quit immediately afterwards. "It
was a little bit unnerving. I wasn't really
comfortable up front," she said. Appa
rently it takes a particular kind of per
sonality to enjoy yell leading. "You

have to like the limelight. W-e're all
hams in a way," said DougGreenfield, <■
member who is determined to stay with
the group.
Senior Leslie Torvik is the latest and
probably last addition to this year's
squad. Brower says the team "will tryto
make it with five people this year.''
Still, problems remain. The members
don't feel ac cepted as a legitimate spirit
group by the student body.
"It's cool to put yell leaders down at
Stanford," Goldfarb said. Unlike the
Band, which has a definite place here,
the yell leaders have not established
themselves.
"We're still waiting to see what
they're going to do," Alex Jardetsky,
band manager, said.
But the yell leaders are still trying.
The current group thinks what they do
is worthwhile. "I see it as a challenge.
We have to work at it," said Hernandez.
Greenfield agreed that its not easy to
make yell leading a success. "There's a
lot of competition out on the field and a
lot of campus heroes in the Band. But
we fill in the gaps," he said.
"We're out there to make people
laugh and have a good time," Goldfarb
said. "I think we ( an do it."

Stanford cheerleaders could no more
make it past the gates of the University
stadium than beer now can. But yell
leaders? A co-ed group here wants
"spirit to reign at the games." The
group thinks yell leading is a means to
encourage that end.
But the squad has had problems
since its members were chosen last Ap
ril. Lack of enthusiasm among squad
members, internal quarrels, and a high
quitting rate are some of the difficulties
this year's yell leaders have faced.
Winners of the yell leader competi
tion, by virtue of their superior lung
power and high spirits, were sopho
mores Sue Goldtarb, Laurie Ostendorf,
Doug Greenfield, and Martin Pena.
Also selected were juniors Seth Ellison
and Karen Brower. Already half have
quit the squad.
Enthusiasm for the group was "sky
high" before tryouts, as one yell leader
said. Prospects for a wild yelling season
couldn't have looked better. Approxi
mately 20 students auditioned for the
six open positions. Each did a three to
five minute act, encouraging audience
participation. Then the prospective
members were judged by former Dol

lies and yell leaders, bandsmen, KZSU
representatives and athletes. I he six
elected members hardly knew one
another, but they hoped that after
creating routines, they woi'ld perform
and work well together.
The first blow to the group came after
auditions, before spring quarter en
ded. Ellison decided not to return here
this year. The other yell leaders were
still counting on a group of five when
Ostendorf bowed out after the Ok
lahoma football game this year. Before
the Caids played Tulane Pena had also
quit.

comfortable up front," she said. Appa
rently it takes a particular kind of per
sonality to enjoy yell leading. "You

have to like the limelight. W-e're all
hams in a way," said DougGreenfield, <■
member who is determined to stay with
the group.
Senior Leslie Torvik is the latest and
probably last addition to this year's
squad. Brower says the team "will tryto
make it with five people this year.''
Still, problems remain. The members
don't feel ac cepted as a legitimate spirit
group by the student body.
"It's cool to put yell leaders down at
Stanford," Goldfarb said. Unlike the
Band, which has a definite place here,
the yell leaders have not established
themselves.
"We're still waiting to see what
they're going to do," Alex Jardetsky,
band manager, said.
But the yell leaders are still trying.
The current group thinks what they do
is worthwhile. "I see it as a challenge.
We have to work at it," said Hernandez.
Greenfield agreed that its not easy to
make yell leading a success. "There's a
lot of competition out on the field and a
lot of campus heroes in the Band. But
we fill in the gaps," he said.
"We're out there to make people
laugh and have a good time," Goldfarb
said. "I think we ( an do it."
