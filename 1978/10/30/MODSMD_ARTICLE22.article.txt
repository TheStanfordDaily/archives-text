# Cards tranquilize crowd, OSU, 24-6
## Stanford flat; Oregon State flatter as Cards win No-Doz Bowl 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
If the Cards could bottle the
stuff that made their game so
tranquilizing Saturday, there
would be a world full of grate
ful insomniacs. Interspersed
with moments of vivacity, Stan
ford pulled out a lethargic 24-6
victory over the Oregon State
Beavers before a nodding Stan
ford Stadium crowd of almost
40,000.
Even the high school bands
that were to appear for Band
Day were so apathetic in their
response that they cancelled
the event. The only potential
for any kind of excitement was
the Freudian pre-game tribute
the LSJUMB erected on the
field.
"This was the flattest per
formance we've had since I've
been here," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh. It was flat
tened by the number of inter

ceptions, penalties and in
juries that occurred during the
interminable gridiron contest.
Leading Cardinal pass re
ceiver Phil Francis was
sidelined with a sprained ankle
at the end of the first quarter.
Gordy Ceresino followed him
to the bench shortly thereafter
with a knee sprain after reach
ing a career total of 499 tackles.
Both Francis and Ceresino's re
turns are "questionable" for
Saturday's confrontation with
the Trojans of USC.
"The loss of Phil Francis is
tough to overcome in our of
fense," Walsh said. "It hurts
our running game."
In spite of the injuries, the
Cards maintained enough
composure to capture the vic
tory, recovering from an une
ventful third quarter riddled
with penalties (five total) to
gain 141 yards passing — out of

a game total of 285 — in the
fourth quarter.
If there was any sparkle in
the contest at all, Card strong
safety Steve Foley claimed at
least part of it on his dazzling
53-yard interception return for
a TD on the first play of the final
period.
The next time the Cards had
possession of the pigskin, they
shone again — from one en
dzone to the other on an 80-
yard drive that started with a
goal-line interception by Card
Rick Parker and ended with a
flashy double reverse pass
(Dils to Nelson to Vince Mulroy
to Dils who threw to Marty
Smith) that put the Cards in for
another seven. (Defensive
back John Piggott and
linebacker Steve Budinger also
nabbed interceptions.)
"They had the type of de
fense we thought we could run

a double reverse against," said
Stanford QB Steve Dils. "We
were kind of shocked when the
coach called it, but he knows
what he's doing."
As part of that drive Darrin
Nelson caught a Dils pass and
ran it 19 crowd-pleasing yards
for a touchdown, only to have
it called back for stepping out
of bounds. Nelson finished the
game with only 52 yards rush
ing, the Beaver defense keying
on him the entire game.
Between the interception
and the double reverse pass,
Mulroy, replacing an injured
Andre Tyler, caught a 60-yard
bomb by Dils that eased him
into the honor of being the
leading pass receiver in the
game with five catches for 103
yards.
"Vince had a great week in
practice," complimented Dils.
"He played well today. He ran
good patterns."
The Card defense also ran
well — all over the Beaver of
fense, OSU quarterback Steve
Smith included. In addition to
forcing Smith to throw out of a
scamper all afternoon, he went
down behind the line of
scrimmage more than once —
or twice.

Outside linebacker Milt
McColl said, "We tried to force
their quarterback to pass. Their
offensive line was a little bit
tired. The QB had to start pas
sing and we knew how to key
on that pass."
Defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said, "When we
played man-to-man, and the
linebackers were blitzing, we
put more pressure on the quar
terback and he couldn't con
centrate on his timing. When
we played a zone, he picked us
apart."
Obviously he didn't pick
well or often enough. The
Cards opened the game by los
ing the coin toss, but scored
first on a 10-play 75-yard drive
that ended when Dils fired one
to Margerum over the middle
for 16 yards and a TD.
Oregon State came back on
the next series and moved
within the field goal range of
Kieron Walford who kicked a
35-yarder to put the Beavers on
the scoreboard.
In the second play of the
second quarter, Ken Naber
booted a 24 yard field goal to
give Stanford a 10-3 lead.
Naber performed well this

One incident did mar the
punt team's performance
against the Beavers when a
fake punt was called in the
huddle and one of the receiv
ers did not hear the play. Quar
terback Turk Schonert, sub
stituting for Dils, was caught
without a receiver. He was sac

"We got good blocking,"
said Naber, "We decided to
give up a few yards to get the
ball out."
They didn't sacrifice much,
though, as Naber averaged
39.5 yards per punt.
The last score of the half (and
the last one for Oregon State)
occurred with 20 seconds re
maining in the first half on
another Walford field goal, this
time from 47 yards out.
The Beavers left the field in
easy striking range of Stanford
which held a tenuous 10-6 lead.
Walsh said, "We knew we were

The important result was that
Stanford won, bringing its
Pacific-10 record to 2-2 as the
Cardinals begin preparing for

Several of the players attri
buted the low-energy level to
the fact that preparation for
Southern Cal has already be

hand, said he "couldn't get
going for the 'SC game yet or
this game wouldn't mean any

Then he asked for the score of

And Saturday they couldn't
expect perfection from the
team. The Cards were tagged
for a total of 161 yards in penal
ties — an additional opponent
for them to overcome.
"It's hard to play when
you're second-and-25 all the
time," Dils said. And in the
third quarter, it looked like

both teams ceased to play at
all.
The quarterbacks led their
teams up and down the field,
punting, passing, being
penalized and never quite
coming into scoring range.
But the fourth quarter was a
whole new ball game, one be
longing almost solely to the
Cards as Stanford put 14 points
on the board.
The important result was that
Stanford won, bringing its
Pacific-10 record to 2-2 as the
Cardinals begin preparing for
use.
Several of the players attri

the fact that preparation for

hand, said he "couldn't get

When asked to remark on
the USC game, Walsh re

toughest game of the year."
Then he asked for the score of
the USC-California game.
"Forty-two to seven?" he
asked incredulously. "Forty
two . . . ? Why don't we re
mark on the Oregon State
game?"
Waish wished to savor one
game which won't give Cardi
nal coaches, players or fans any
more sleepless nights.
If the Cards could bottle the
stuff that made their game so
tranquilizing Saturday, there
would be a world full of grate
ful insomniacs. Interspersed
with moments of vivacity, Stan
ford pulled out a lethargic 24-6
victory over the Oregon State
Beavers before a nodding Stan
ford Stadium crowd of almost
40,000.
Even the high school bands
that were to appear for Band
Day were so apathetic in their
response that they cancelled
the event. The only potential
for any kind of excitement was
the Freudian pre-game tribute
the LSJUMB erected on the
field.
"This was the flattest per
formance we've had since I've
been here," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh. It was flat
tened by the number of inter

ceptions, penalties and in
juries that occurred during the
interminable gridiron contest.
Leading Cardinal pass re
ceiver Phil Francis was
sidelined with a sprained ankle
at the end of the first quarter.
Gordy Ceresino followed him
to the bench shortly thereafter
with a knee sprain after reach
ing a career total of 499 tackles.
Both Francis and Ceresino's re
turns are "questionable" for
Saturday's confrontation with
the Trojans of USC.
"The loss of Phil Francis is
tough to overcome in our of
fense," Walsh said. "It hurts
our running game."
In spite of the injuries, the
Cards maintained enough
composure to capture the vic
tory, recovering from an une
ventful third quarter riddled
with penalties (five total) to
gain 141 yards passing — out of

a game total of 285 — in the
fourth quarter.
If there was any sparkle in
the contest at all, Card strong
safety Steve Foley claimed at
least part of it on his dazzling
53-yard interception return for
a TD on the first play of the final
period.
The next time the Cards had
possession of the pigskin, they
shone again — from one en
dzone to the other on an 80-
yard drive that started with a
goal-line interception by Card
Rick Parker and ended with a
flashy double reverse pass
(Dils to Nelson to Vince Mulroy
to Dils who threw to Marty
Smith) that put the Cards in for
another seven. (Defensive
back John Piggott and
linebacker Steve Budinger also
nabbed interceptions.)
"They had the type of de
fense we thought we could run

a double reverse against," said
Stanford QB Steve Dils. "We
were kind of shocked when the
coach called it, but he knows
what he's doing."
As part of that drive Darrin
Nelson caught a Dils pass and
ran it 19 crowd-pleasing yards
for a touchdown, only to have
it called back for stepping out
of bounds. Nelson finished the
game with only 52 yards rush
ing, the Beaver defense keying
on him the entire game.
Between the interception
and the double reverse pass,
Mulroy, replacing an injured
Andre Tyler, caught a 60-yard
bomb by Dils that eased him
into the honor of being the
leading pass receiver in the
game with five catches for 103
yards.
"Vince had a great week in
practice," complimented Dils.
"He played well today. He ran
good patterns."
The Card defense also ran
well — all over the Beaver of
fense, OSU quarterback Steve
Smith included. In addition to
forcing Smith to throw out of a
scamper all afternoon, he went
down behind the line of
scrimmage more than once —
or twice.

Outside linebacker Milt
McColl said, "We tried to force
their quarterback to pass. Their
offensive line was a little bit
tired. The QB had to start pas
sing and we knew how to key
on that pass."
Defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said, "When we
played man-to-man, and the
linebackers were blitzing, we
put more pressure on the quar
terback and he couldn't con
centrate on his timing. When
we played a zone, he picked us
apart."
Obviously he didn't pick
well or often enough. The
Cards opened the game by los
ing the coin toss, but scored
first on a 10-play 75-yard drive
that ended when Dils fired one
to Margerum over the middle
for 16 yards and a TD.
Oregon State came back on
the next series and moved
within the field goal range of
Kieron Walford who kicked a
35-yarder to put the Beavers on
the scoreboard.
In the second play of the
second quarter, Ken Naber
booted a 24 yard field goal to
give Stanford a 10-3 lead.
Naber performed well this

week, getting punts off with
out mishaps, and making extra
points without difficulty.
One incident did mar the
punt team's performance
against the Beavers when a
fake punt was called in the
huddle and one of the receiv
ers did not hear the play. Quar
terback Turk Schonert, sub
stituting for Dils, was caught
without a receiver. He was sac
ked, for a loss of six yards.
"We got good blocking,"
said Naber, "We decided to
give up a few yards to get the
ball out."
They didn't sacrifice much,
though, as Naber averaged
39.5 yards per punt.
The last score of the half (and
the last one for Oregon State)
occurred with 20 seconds re
maining in the first half on
another Walford field goal, this
time from 47 yards out.
The Beavers left the field in
easy striking range of Stanford
which held a tenuous 10-6 lead.
Walsh said, "We knew we were
in for a battering the second
half. I told the defense that
they would have to win it." He

week, getting punts off with
out mishaps, and making extra
points without difficulty.
One incident did mar the
punt team's performance
against the Beavers when a
fake punt was called in the
huddle and one of the receiv
ers did not hear the play. Quar
terback Turk Schonert, sub
stituting for Dils, was caught
without a receiver. He was sac
ked, for a loss of six yards.
"We got good blocking,"
said Naber, "We decided to
give up a few yards to get the
ball out."
They didn't sacrifice much,
though, as Naber averaged
39.5 yards per punt.
The last score of the half (and
the last one for Oregon State)
occurred with 20 seconds re
maining in the first half on
another Walford field goal, this
time from 47 yards out.
The Beavers left the field in
easy striking range of Stanford
which held a tenuous 10-6 lead.
Walsh said, "We knew we were
in for a battering the second
half. I told the defense that
they would have to win it." He
was right.
Stanford's offense appeared
stagnant.
"Dils was not his sharpest,"
Walsh said. "But that's often
the case with quarterbacks.
They have a great day (Dils
broke all kinds of records in
the game against Washington
State last week) then they
come back and play fair. We
can't expect perfection from

And Saturday they couldn't
expect perfection from the
team. The Cards were tagged
for a total of 161 yards in penal
ties — an additional opponent
for them to overcome.
"It's hard to play when
you're second-and-25 all the
time," Dils said. And in the
third quarter, it looked like

both teams ceased to play at
all.
The quarterbacks led their
teams up and down the field,
punting, passing, being
penalized and never quite
coming into scoring range.
But the fourth quarter was a
whole new ball game, one be
longing almost solely to the
Cards as Stanford put 14 points
on the board.
The important result was that
Stanford won, bringing its
Pacific-10 record to 2-2 as the
Cardinals begin preparing for
use.
Several of the players attri

the fact that preparation for
Southern Cal has already be

gun. Margerum, on the other
hand, said he "couldn't get
going for the 'SC game yet or
this game wouldn't mean any

When asked to remark on
the USC game, Walsh re
sponded "that it will be the
toughest game of the year."
Then he asked for the score of
the USC-California game.
"Forty-two to seven?" he
asked incredulously. "Forty
two . . . ? Why don't we re
mark on the Oregon State
game?"
Waish wished to savor one
game which won't give Cardi
nal coaches, players or fans any
more sleepless nights.
If the Cards could bottle the
stuff that made their game so
tranquilizing Saturday, there
would be a world full of grate
ful insomniacs. Interspersed
with moments of vivacity, Stan
ford pulled out a lethargic 24-6
victory over the Oregon State
Beavers before a nodding Stan
ford Stadium crowd of almost
40,000.
Even the high school bands
that were to appear for Band
Day were so apathetic in their
response that they cancelled
the event. The only potential
for any kind of excitement was
the Freudian pre-game tribute
the LSJUMB erected on the
field.
"This was the flattest per
formance we've had since I've
been here," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh. It was flat
tened by the number of inter

ceptions, penalties and in
juries that occurred during the
interminable gridiron contest.
Leading Cardinal pass re
ceiver Phil Francis was
sidelined with a sprained ankle
at the end of the first quarter.
Gordy Ceresino followed him
to the bench shortly thereafter
with a knee sprain after reach
ing a career total of 499 tackles.
Both Francis and Ceresino's re
turns are "questionable" for
Saturday's confrontation with
the Trojans of USC.
"The loss of Phil Francis is
tough to overcome in our of
fense," Walsh said. "It hurts
our running game."
In spite of the injuries, the
Cards maintained enough
composure to capture the vic
tory, recovering from an une
ventful third quarter riddled
with penalties (five total) to
gain 141 yards passing — out of

a game total of 285 — in the
fourth quarter.
If there was any sparkle in
the contest at all, Card strong
safety Steve Foley claimed at
least part of it on his dazzling
53-yard interception return for
a TD on the first play of the final
period.
The next time the Cards had
possession of the pigskin, they
shone again — from one en
dzone to the other on an 80-
yard drive that started with a
goal-line interception by Card
Rick Parker and ended with a
flashy double reverse pass
(Dils to Nelson to Vince Mulroy
to Dils who threw to Marty
Smith) that put the Cards in for
another seven. (Defensive
back John Piggott and
linebacker Steve Budinger also
nabbed interceptions.)
"They had the type of de
fense we thought we could run

a double reverse against," said
Stanford QB Steve Dils. "We
were kind of shocked when the
coach called it, but he knows
what he's doing."
As part of that drive Darrin
Nelson caught a Dils pass and
ran it 19 crowd-pleasing yards
for a touchdown, only to have
it called back for stepping out
of bounds. Nelson finished the
game with only 52 yards rush
ing, the Beaver defense keying
on him the entire game.
Between the interception
and the double reverse pass,
Mulroy, replacing an injured
Andre Tyler, caught a 60-yard
bomb by Dils that eased him
into the honor of being the
leading pass receiver in the
game with five catches for 103
yards.
"Vince had a great week in
practice," complimented Dils.
"He played well today. He ran
good patterns."
The Card defense also ran
well — all over the Beaver of
fense, OSU quarterback Steve
Smith included. In addition to
forcing Smith to throw out of a
scamper all afternoon, he went
down behind the line of
scrimmage more than once —
or twice.

Outside linebacker Milt
McColl said, "We tried to force
their quarterback to pass. Their
offensive line was a little bit
tired. The QB had to start pas
sing and we knew how to key
on that pass."
Defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said, "When we
played man-to-man, and the
linebackers were blitzing, we
put more pressure on the quar
terback and he couldn't con
centrate on his timing. When
we played a zone, he picked us
apart."
Obviously he didn't pick
well or often enough. The
Cards opened the game by los
ing the coin toss, but scored
first on a 10-play 75-yard drive
that ended when Dils fired one
to Margerum over the middle
for 16 yards and a TD.
Oregon State came back on
the next series and moved
within the field goal range of
Kieron Walford who kicked a
35-yarder to put the Beavers on

of bounds. Nelson finished the
game with only 52 yards rush
ing, the Beaver defense keying
on him the entire game.
Between the interception
and the double reverse pass,
Mulroy, replacing an injured
Andre Tyler, caught a 60-yard
bomb by Dils that eased him
into the honor of being the
leading pass receiver in the
game with five catches for 103
yards.
"Vince had a great week in
practice," complimented Dils.
"He played well today. He ran
good patterns."
The Card defense also ran
well — all over the Beaver of
fense, OSU quarterback Steve
Smith included. In addition to
forcing Smith to throw out of a
scamper all afternoon, he went
down behind the line of
scrimmage more than once —
or twice.

Outside linebacker Milt
McColl said, "We tried to force
their quarterback to pass. Their
offensive line was a little bit
tired. The QB had to start pas
sing and we knew how to key
on that pass."
Defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said, "When we
played man-to-man, and the
linebackers were blitzing, we
put more pressure on the quar
terback and he couldn't con
centrate on his timing. When
we played a zone, he picked us
apart."
Obviously he didn't pick
well or often enough. The
Cards opened the game by los
ing the coin toss, but scored
first on a 10-play 75-yard drive
that ended when Dils fired one
to Margerum over the middle
for 16 yards and a TD.
Oregon State came back on
the next series and moved
within the field goal range of
Kieron Walford who kicked a
35-yarder to put the Beavers on
the scoreboard.
In the second play of the
second quarter, Ken Naber
booted a 24 yard field goal to
give Stanford a 10-3 lead.

week, getting punts off with
out mishaps, and making extra
points without difficulty.
One incident did mar the
punt team's performance
against the Beavers when a
fake punt was called in the
huddle and one of the receiv
ers did not hear the play. Quar
terback Turk Schonert, sub
stituting for Dils, was caught
without a receiver. He was sac
ked, for a loss of six yards.
"We got good blocking,"
said Naber, "We decided to
give up a few yards to get the
ball out."
They didn't sacrifice much,
though, as Naber averaged
39.5 yards per punt.
The last score of the half (and
the last one for Oregon State)
occurred with 20 seconds re
maining in the first half on
another Walford field goal, this
time from 47 yards out.
The Beavers left the field in
easy striking range of Stanford
which held a tenuous 10-6 lead.
Walsh said, "We knew we were
in for a battering the second
half. I told the defense that
they would have to win it." He
was right.
Stanford's offense appeared
stagnant.
"Dils was not his sharpest,"
Walsh said. "But that's often
the case with quarterbacks.
They have a great day (Dils
broke all kinds of records in
the game against Washington
State last week) then they
come back and play fair. We
can't expect perfection from
the man."
And Saturday they couldn't
expect perfection from the
team. The Cards were tagged
for a total of 161 yards in penal
ties — an additional opponent
for them to overcome.
"It's hard to play when
you're second-and-25 all the
time," Dils said. And in the
third quarter, it looked like

both teams ceased to play at
all.
The quarterbacks led their
teams up and down the field,
punting, passing, being
penalized and never quite
coming into scoring range.
But the fourth quarter was a
whole new ball game, one be
longing almost solely to the
Cards as Stanford put 14 points
on the board.
The important result was that
Stanford won, bringing its
Pacific-10 record to 2-2 as the
Cardinals begin preparing for
use.
Several of the players attri
buted the low-energy level to
the fact that preparation for
Southern Cal has already be

gun. Margerum, on the other
hand, said he "couldn't get
going for the 'SC game yet or
this game wouldn't mean any
thing."
When asked to remark on
the USC game, Walsh re
sponded "that it will be the
toughest game of the year."
Then he asked for the score of
the USC-California game.
"Forty-two to seven?" he
asked incredulously. "Forty
two . . . ? Why don't we re
mark on the Oregon State
game?"
Waish wished to savor one
game which won't give Cardi
nal coaches, players or fans any
more sleepless nights.
If the Cards could bottle the
stuff that made their game so
tranquilizing Saturday, there
would be a world full of grate
ful insomniacs. Interspersed
with moments of vivacity, Stan
ford pulled out a lethargic 24-6
victory over the Oregon State
Beavers before a nodding Stan
ford Stadium crowd of almost
40,000.
Even the high school bands
that were to appear for Band
Day were so apathetic in their
response that they cancelled
the event. The only potential
for any kind of excitement was
the Freudian pre-game tribute
the LSJUMB erected on the
field.
"This was the flattest per
formance we've had since I've
been here," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh. It was flat
tened by the number of inter

ceptions, penalties and in
juries that occurred during the
interminable gridiron contest.
Leading Cardinal pass re
ceiver Phil Francis was
sidelined with a sprained ankle
at the end of the first quarter.
Gordy Ceresino followed him
to the bench shortly thereafter
with a knee sprain after reach
ing a career total of 499 tackles.
Both Francis and Ceresino's re
turns are "questionable" for
Saturday's confrontation with
the Trojans of USC.
"The loss of Phil Francis is
tough to overcome in our of
fense," Walsh said. "It hurts
our running game."
In spite of the injuries, the
Cards maintained enough
composure to capture the vic
tory, recovering from an une
ventful third quarter riddled
with penalties (five total) to
gain 141 yards passing — out of

a game total of 285 — in the
fourth quarter.
If there was any sparkle in
the contest at all, Card strong
safety Steve Foley claimed at
least part of it on his dazzling
53-yard interception return for
a TD on the first play of the final
period.
The next time the Cards had
possession of the pigskin, they
shone again — from one en
dzone to the other on an 80-
yard drive that started with a
goal-line interception by Card
Rick Parker and ended with a
flashy double reverse pass
(Dils to Nelson to Vince Mulroy
to Dils who threw to Marty
Smith) that put the Cards in for
another seven. (Defensive
back John Piggott and
linebacker Steve Budinger also
nabbed interceptions.)
"They had the type of de
fense we thought we could run

a double reverse against," said
Stanford QB Steve Dils. "We
were kind of shocked when the
coach called it, but he knows
what he's doing."
As part of that drive Darrin
Nelson caught a Dils pass and
ran it 19 crowd-pleasing yards
for a touchdown, only to have
it called back for stepping out
of bounds. Nelson finished the
game with only 52 yards rush
ing, the Beaver defense keying
on him the entire game.
Between the interception
and the double reverse pass,
Mulroy, replacing an injured
Andre Tyler, caught a 60-yard
