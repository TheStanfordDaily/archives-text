# Cards tranquilize crowd, OSU, 24-6
## Stanford flat; Oregon State flatter as Cards win No-Doz Bowl 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
If the Cards could bottle the
stuff that made their game so
tranquilizing Saturday, there
would be a world full of grate
ful insomniacs. Interspersed
with moments of vivacity, Stan
ford pulled out a lethargic 24-6
victory over the Oregon State
Beavers before a nodding Stan
ford Stadium crowd of almost
40,000.
Even the high school bands
that were to appear for Band
Day were so apathetic in their
response that they cancelled
the event. The only potential
for any kind of excitement was
the Freudian pre-game tribute
the LSJUMB erected on the
field.
"This was the flattest per
formance we've had since I've
been here," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh. It was flat
tened by the number of inter

ceptions, penalties and in
juries that occurred during the
interminable gridiron contest.
Leading Cardinal pass re
ceiver Phil Francis was
sidelined with a sprained ankle
at the end of the first quarter.
Gordy Ceresino followed him
to the bench shortly thereafter
with a knee sprain after reach
ing a career total of 499 tackles.
Both Francis and Ceresino's re
turns are "questionable" for
Saturday's confrontation with
the Trojans of USC.
"The loss of Phil Francis is
tough to overcome in our of
fense," Walsh said. "It hurts
our running game."
In spite of the injuries, the
Cards maintained enough
composure to capture the vic
tory, recovering from an une
ventful third quarter riddled
with penalties (five total) to
gain 141 yards passing — out of

a game total of 285 — in the
fourth quarter.
If there was any sparkle in
the contest at all, Card strong
safety Steve Foley claimed at
least part of it on his dazzling
53-yard interception return for
a TD on the first play of the final
period.
The next time the Cards had
possession of the pigskin, they
shone again — from one en
dzone to the other on an 80-
yard drive that started with a
goal-line interception by Card
Rick Parker and ended with a
flashy double reverse pass
(Dils to Nelson to Vince Mulroy
to Dils who threw to Marty
Smith) that put the Cards in for
another seven. (Defensive
back John Piggott and
linebacker Steve Budinger also
nabbed interceptions.)
"They had the type of de
fense we thought we could run

a double reverse against," said
Stanford QB Steve Dils. "We
were kind of shocked when the
coach called it, but he knows
what he's doing."
As part of that drive Darrin
Nelson caught a Dils pass and
ran it 19 crowd-pleasing yards
for a touchdown, only to have
it called back for stepping out
of bounds. Nelson finished the
game with only 52 yards rush
ing, the Beaver defense keying
on him the entire game.
Between the interception
and the double reverse pass,
Mulroy, replacing an injured
Andre Tyler, caught a 60-yard
bomb by Dils that eased him
into the honor of being the
leading pass receiver in the
game with five catches for 103
yards.
"Vince had a great week in
practice," complimented Dils.
"He played well today. He ran
good patterns."
The Card defense also ran
well — all over the Beaver of
fense, OSU quarterback Steve
Smith included. In addition to
forcing Smith to throw out of a
scamper all afternoon, he went
down behind the line of
scrimmage more than once —
or twice.

Outside linebacker Milt
McColl said, "We tried to force
their quarterback to pass. Their
offensive line was a little bit
tired. The QB had to start pas
sing and we knew how to key
on that pass."
Defensive backfield coach
George Seifert said, "When we
played man-to-man, and the
linebackers were blitzing, we
put more pressure on the quar
terback and he couldn't con
centrate on his timing. When
we played a zone, he picked us
apart."
Obviously he didn't pick
well or often enough. The
Cards opened the game by los
ing the coin toss, but scored
first on a 10-play 75-yard drive
that ended when Dils fired one
to Margerum over the middle
for 16 yards and a TD.
Oregon State came back on
the next series and moved
within the field goal range of
Kieron Walford who kicked a
35-yarder to put the Beavers on
the scoreboard.
In the second play of the
second quarter, Ken Naber
booted a 24 yard field goal to
give Stanford a 10-3 lead.
Naber performed well this
