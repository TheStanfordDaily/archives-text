# Flanker snags 5 passes for 103 yards
## Mulroy catches beavers napping 
### IVAN MAISEL 
"I wanted the game to go on
forever," flanker Vince Mulroy
said. "I never wanted it to
end."
As far as Mulroy's perfor
mance is concerned, the Stan
ford coaching staff never
wanted it to end either. Mulroy
caught five passes for 103 yards
in Saturday's 24-6 win over
Oregon State, including a 60-
yard bomb that was the key
play in the Cards' final
touchdown drive.
Ironically, the 6-foot, 180-
pound senior was not origi
nally scheduled to start.
Sophomore Andre Tyler, who
took the starting flanker posi
tion away from Mulroy earlier
in the season, pulled a groin
muscle in practice Tuesday and
was held out of action Satur
day.
Given another chance, Mul
roy made the most of it. Mulroy
said he felt that he was begin
ning to lose concentration
from not playing as frequently
as he had before, and credited
receiver coach Rod Dowhower
with keeping his momentum
up.
"Coach Dowhower talked to
me at practice Monday," Mul
roy said. "He told me not to get
frustrated and to hang in there.
It kind of gave me renewed en
thusiasm."
That enthusiasm showed
Saturday as Mulroy gave a
somewhat self-gratifying per
formance.
"Playing football is a great
experience if you're out on the
field. When you're on the
bench, you don't have the in

tensity of emotion that you
have on the field," Mulroy
said.
"When you win, you come in
with a hollow feeling unless
you've contributed," Mulroy
added.
Mulroy certainly contributed
Saturday. The receiver on the
other side of the field, split end
Kenny Margerum, was limited
to four catches, due to fre
quent double coverage by the
Beaver secondary. Add to that
the fact that the team's leading

receiver, fullback Phil Francis,
left the game with an ankle in
jury in the first quarter, and
one sees Mulroy's perfor
mance magnified in impor
tance.
"Their double covering of
Kenny forced Steve (Dils) to
throw more to the tight eiids
and the flanker," Mulroy said.
Tight ends Marty Smith and
Pat Bowe combined for four
catches for 34 yards, including
the final touchdown catch bv
Smith. Smith's 3-yard recep

tion capped off an eight-play,
80-yard drive, most of which
was covered in the bomb to
Mulroy.
"It was the longest pass I've
caught since I've been at Stan
ford," Mulroy said. "Earlier in
the game, I went \o Coach
Walsh and told him that they
were playing me tight. I
thought I could go deep.
Walsh called it later in the
game.
"It was a personal vindica
tion," Mulroy continued. "I
stuck my neck out and it
worked.
"Coaches have a tendency to
stereotype a receiver," Mulroy
added. "I think they were
thinking of me as a short, un
derneath receiver who can't go
deep . . . I'm not the deep
threat that Kenny Margerum is,
but I feel I can catch the long
pass and beat the opposing
team's defense."
Mulroy caught the ball near
the Oregon State 30, and drag
ged the defender for about 10
yards before he fell.
"I kept thinking, 'get off my
back, I haven't scored in two
years,' " Mulroy said.
Head coach Bill Walsh
praised Mulroy's play in Satur
day's game, saying, "Vinnie
made a big difference in this
game."
Perhaps the biggest differ
ence of all was the fact that
Mulroy was the star.
"When you don't play, you
can't feel that you can be a part
of the celebration in the locker
room," Mulroy said. One can
be sure that Mulroy celebrated
after Saturday's game.

roy said. "He told me not to get
frustrated and to hang in there.
It kind of gave me renewed en
thusiasm."
That enthusiasm showed
Saturday as Mulroy gave a
somewhat self-gratifying per
formance.
"Playing football is a great
experience if you're out on the
field. When you're on the
bench, you don't have the in

tensity of emotion that you
have on the field," Mulroy
said.
"When you win, you come in
with a hollow feeling unless
you've contributed," Mulroy
added.
Mulroy certainly contributed
Saturday. The receiver on the
other side of the field, split end
Kenny Margerum, was limited
to four catches, due to fre
quent double coverage by the
Beaver secondary. Add to that
the fact that the team's leading

receiver, fullback Phil Francis,
left the game with an ankle in
jury in the first quarter, and
one sees Mulroy's perfor
mance magnified in impor
tance.
"Their double covering of
Kenny forced Steve (Dils) to
throw more to the tight eiids
and the flanker," Mulroy said.
Tight ends Marty Smith and
Pat Bowe combined for four
catches for 34 yards, including
the final touchdown catch bv
Smith. Smith's 3-yard recep

tion capped off an eight-play,
80-yard drive, most of which
was covered in the bomb to
Mulroy.
"It was the longest pass I've
caught since I've been at Stan
ford," Mulroy said. "Earlier in
the game, I went \o Coach
Walsh and told him that they
were playing me tight. I
thought I could go deep.
Walsh called it later in the
game.
"It was a personal vindica
tion," Mulroy continued. "I
stuck my neck out and it
worked.
"Coaches have a tendency to
stereotype a receiver," Mulroy
added. "I think they were
thinking of me as a short, un
derneath receiver who can't go
deep . . . I'm not the deep
threat that Kenny Margerum is,
but I feel I can catch the long
pass and beat the opposing
team's defense."
Mulroy caught the ball near
the Oregon State 30, and drag
ged the defender for about 10
yards before he fell.
"I kept thinking, 'get off my
back, I haven't scored in two
years,' " Mulroy said.
Head coach Bill Walsh
praised Mulroy's play in Satur
day's game, saying, "Vinnie
made a big difference in this
game."
Perhaps the biggest differ
ence of all was the fact that
Mulroy was the star.
"When you don't play, you
can't feel that you can be a part
of the celebration in the locker
room," Mulroy said. One can
be sure that Mulroy celebrated
after Saturday's game.

Vince Mulroy, No. 40, catches a Dils pass to complete a 60-yard play
that boosted him to the top of the pass receiving statistics list with five
catches for 103 yards.
"I wanted the game to go on
forever," flanker Vince Mulroy
said. "I never wanted it to
end."
As far as Mulroy's perfor
mance is concerned, the Stan
ford coaching staff never
wanted it to end either. Mulroy
caught five passes for 103 yards
in Saturday's 24-6 win over
Oregon State, including a 60-
yard bomb that was the key
play in the Cards' final
touchdown drive.
Ironically, the 6-foot, 180-
pound senior was not origi
nally scheduled to start.
Sophomore Andre Tyler, who
took the starting flanker posi
tion away from Mulroy earlier
in the season, pulled a groin
muscle in practice Tuesday and
was held out of action Satur
day.
Given another chance, Mul
roy made the most of it. Mulroy
said he felt that he was begin
ning to lose concentration
from not playing as frequently
as he had before, and credited
receiver coach Rod Dowhower
with keeping his momentum
up.
