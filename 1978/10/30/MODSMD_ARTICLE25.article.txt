# Scotchers down LBS in last minute
## Cardinals rekindle hopes 
### SHARON SILVERSTEIN 
There are those who
claim that time has no real
meaning. But these same
people would probably say
that the Stanford field hoc
key team's last second win
over Long Beach State
Saturday didn't really hap
pen because they didn't
immediately perceive it.
The skeptics may have a
point in their second claim,
because Sukie Jackson's
clutch score had to be seen
to be believed.
While most of the Stan
ford community was bored
by the ease with which its
football team ran over Ore
gon State, some of the best
college hockey in the coun
try was being played on
Roble Field. The skeptics
should have been there be
cause the Cards moved
themselves into contention
for a regional berth by scor
ing a single goal on Long
Beach State, the Southern
Conference champion.
,After forcing a scoreless
standstill to the final sec
onds, the Cards mounted
their last drive against Long
Beach with a corner, an as
pect of the game that has
been troublesome for them
all year. But Saturday, every
thing went as if it were ac
cording to divine plan.
Whether pre-ordained or
not, all of the credit must go
to the principals in the play.
"(Amanda) Reed made a
perfect pass, and I was

hanging back ready for it,"
said Jackson, whose drive
filled the net and vaulted
the Cards into the realm of
post-season possibilities.
If Stanford beats Sac
ramento State Wednesday,
the Cards, along with Long
Beach, San Jose and
California will most proba
bly be chosen to play in the
Region 8 Tournament at
Berkeley Nov. 10 and 11.

The win over Long Beach
will probably catapult Stan
ford past Cal Poly-Pomona,
since the teams deadlocked
at 1-1 Saturday morning.
At the end of a half in
which the Broncos played
slightly better ball, Cindy
Vertulli scored for Pomona
off a hand stop with 15 sec
onds to go. The Cards came
out fighting in the second
half after Stanford coach
Barbara Longstreth told

them to "play with emotion
out there."
The team responded with
aggressive play. Midway
through the half, Kelly Wes
terwick scored from the top
of the striking circle.
That goal makes her the
team's leading scorer, going
into the final game of the
year, with seven goals.
Jackson and Nancy White
follow with six.
