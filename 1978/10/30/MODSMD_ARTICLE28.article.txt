### THEODORE HERHOLD 
Stanford's men's cross country team finished second in the
Pac-10 Southern Division Championship Saturday at UCLA be
hind a strong Arizona team.
The Cards' Roy Kissin ran an excellent race and led most of the
run before being edged at the finish by Tom Hunt of Arizona.
Hunt, running intelligently, stayed behind Kissin throughout
most of the race but came on strong at the 5000-meter mark and
finished with a time of 30:48.9. Kissin ran the 10,000-meter course
in 31:08.8. "I thought he (Kissin) had it won after the first 5000
meters, but Hunt just ran a smart race," said Stanford coach Dean
Clark.
The Cards started out the race in great shape, and ran well as a
group for the first three miles. But the second big hill of the
course, where Craig Corey, John Schaer and Tim Bolton faded,
proved fatal as it left Stanford with a bridesmaid finish in a race
the Cards could have won.
Finishing behind Kissin for Stanford were Rod Berry (seventh —
31:50.5), Bill Haldeman (ninth — 32:55), )erry Emory (11th —
32:22.5), Craig Corey (19th—32:55), John Schaer (26th — 32:40.6)
and Tim Bolton (27th — 33:48.1).
Rod Berry, only a freshmen, has already shown himself to be a
strong addition to the Cards' lineup. "Rod Berry has been Mr.
Consistent for us all year," Clark said. Berry started out well in the
back of a pack of 33 runners, but was able to move up as the race
progressed and finished a strong seventh for the Cards.
"Bill Haldeman ran the race of his life," said Clark of his junior
runner. Emory also ran well for the Cards. Emory, who has been
having fatigue problems, seemed well-rested for Saturday's
event and finished 11th. "I'm glad to see lerry up there where he
belongs," Clark said.
Arizona won the race with 20 points. Stanford was second with
48 points, followed by California and UCLA.
"I'm really very pleased with our effort Saturday," Clark said. "I
think it gave the guys confidence after not running up to their
potential in the Stanford Invitational. It should be a good tune-up
for the District Championship."
The District-8 Championship, featuring teams from the Pac-10
and the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, will be in Fresno on

strong addition to the Cards' lineup. "Rod Berry has been Mr.
Consistent for us all year," Clark said. Berry started out well in the
back of a pack of 33 runners, but was able to move up as the race
progressed and finished a strong seventh for the Cards.
"Bill Haldeman ran the race of his life," said Clark of his junior
runner. Emory also ran well for the Cards. Emory, who has been
having fatigue problems, seemed well-rested for Saturday's
event and finished 11th. "I'm glad to see lerry up there where he
belongs," Clark said.
Arizona won the race with 20 points. Stanford was second with
48 points, followed by California and UCLA.
"I'm really very pleased with our effort Saturday," Clark said. "I
think it gave the guys confidence after not running up to their
potential in the Stanford Invitational. It should be a good tune-up
for the District Championship."
The District-8 Championship, featuring teams from the Pac-10
and the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, will be in Fresno on
Nov. 11.
