# USF tops hooters, 3-0
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
The University of San Fran
cisco Dons. No conversation
about soccer dynasties is com
plete without them. The Dons,
three-time NCAA champions,
are currently ranked second in
the nation, sport a 20-1 record
and have outscored their op
ponents by a 79-to-15 margin.
Yet, in a match similar in re
spects to the football team's
performance against top-rated
Oklahoma, Stanford's soccer
squad put on a good showing
while losing to USF Saturday
morning 3-0.
Dag Olafsen and Roar An
dersen combined forthe Don's
first goal 22 minutes into the
first period. Filipe Magalhaes
added a pair of goals early in
the second half.
Before a crowd of 2000 pay
ing spectators, largest to view
soccer at Harry Maloney Field,
the Cardinals showed a lot of
poise — it'sa raregamewhen a
losing effort can be truly con
gratulated, but such was the
case in this conference con
test.
"The comments from the
USF players — I think this is an
indication," said Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge. "They've
never seen such an improved
Stanford team."
Assistant coach Phil Wright
said, "They're essentially an
all-star international team.
They've got some of the best
players from Europe and Africa
in the United States. There's
still a ways to go, but not that
far.
"Th ree or four years ago they
beat us 7-0 but today they beat
us 3-0 and they had to work for
that," he added.
Last year's trip up to

Kentfield ended in a 4-0 win for
the Dons and the Cards were
understandably nervous dur
ing the game. This season's
meeting was a different story,
as Stanford held USF to one
goal in the first period and ac
tually controlled the game in
the last 20 minutes.
"This year we were so much
cooler about the game," Rick
Cordon said. "You know next
year we're going to be able to
play them so much more
evenly."
Talking to senior Laird Ca
gan, Lodge said, "The last 20
minutes were yours. As a mat
ter of fact, I never saw anything
like it — you dominated. They
didn't even take a strike at the
goal."
"I thought we played a really
good game," said senior Mike
Knowles. "It's too bad we

couldn't play that well against
UCLA because we would've
beat them. It just shows we're a
group of winners that we cjjrr
come back after losing two and
playing one of the best tearris
in the country."
Besides the good news on
the field, the Cards also fared
well in conference develop
ments. Ted Rafalovich and D.an
McNevin are 1-2 in scoring in
the Pacific Soccer Con-'
ference, the duo dynamically
accounting for 40 of the Cards'
69 goals this season. RafalovicT)
also was named as Player of the
Week for his performances in
the Humboldt State and St."
Mary's games.

first period. Filipe Magalhaes
added a pair of goals early in
the second half.
Before a crowd of 2000 pay
ing spectators, largest to view
soccer at Harry Maloney Field,
the Cardinals showed a lot of
poise — it'sa raregamewhen a
losing effort can be truly con
gratulated, but such was the
case in this conference con
test.
"The comments from the
USF players — I think this is an
indication," said Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge. "They've
never seen such an improved
Stanford team."
Assistant coach Phil Wright
said, "They're essentially an
all-star international team.
They've got some of the best
players from Europe and Africa
in the United States. There's
still a ways to go, but not that
far.
"Th ree or four years ago they
beat us 7-0 but today they beat
us 3-0 and they had to work for
that," he added.
Last year's trip up to

Kentfield ended in a 4-0 win for
the Dons and the Cards were
understandably nervous dur
ing the game. This season's
meeting was a different story,
as Stanford held USF to one
goal in the first period and ac
tually controlled the game in
the last 20 minutes.
"This year we were so much
cooler about the game," Rick
Cordon said. "You know next
year we're going to be able to
play them so much more
evenly."
Talking to senior Laird Ca
gan, Lodge said, "The last 20
minutes were yours. As a mat
ter of fact, I never saw anything
like it — you dominated. They
didn't even take a strike at the
goal."
"I thought we played a really
good game," said senior Mike
Knowles. "It's too bad we

couldn't play that well against
UCLA because we would've
beat them. It just shows we're a
group of winners that we cjjrr
come back after losing two and
playing one of the best tearris
in the country."
Besides the good news on
the field, the Cards also fared
well in conference develop
ments. Ted Rafalovich and D.an
McNevin are 1-2 in scoring in
the Pacific Soccer Con-'
ference, the duo dynamically
accounting for 40 of the Cards'
69 goals this season. RafalovicT)
also was named as Player of the
Week for his performances in
the Humboldt State and St."
Mary's games.
Stanford, now 13-5, 2-3 in
league play, hosts Sacramento
State Tuesday at 3 p.m. on
Maloney Field in the next-to-'i
last home match of the season^
The University of San Fran
cisco Dons. No conversation
about soccer dynasties is com
plete without them. The Dons,
three-time NCAA champions,
are currently ranked second in
the nation, sport a 20-1 record
and have outscored their op
ponents by a 79-to-15 margin.
Yet, in a match similar in re
spects to the football team's
performance against top-rated
Oklahoma, Stanford's soccer
squad put on a good showing
while losing to USF Saturday
morning 3-0.
Dag Olafsen and Roar An
dersen combined forthe Don's
first goal 22 minutes into the
