# Assembly incumbent Calvo discusses energy, housing shortage
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
"l now hold positions that allow
me to influence major state deci
sions. I would like to go hack for that
reason," State Assemblyman Victor
Calvo said in an interview with the
Daily last week.
Democratic incumbent Calvo is up
for re-election against Republican
challenger Greg Morris for the as
sembly seat in the 21st district, which
includes the University. Calvo re
cently finished his first term in the
assembly. Prior to that, Calvo served
as a Santa Clara County Supervisor.
Calvo is chairman of the Assem
bly's Resources, Land Use and
Energy Committee and chairs a joint
committee of assemblymen and
senators which is examining the
sources and distribution of energy in
California.
He said that one of the most impor
tant ways to encourage the de
velopment of new energy sources is
to streamline procedures for intro
ducing new methods.
'Eliminate barriers'
"What we have to do through the
state ... is make it easier, eliminate
the institutional barriers and the pro
cedural arrangements required for
application. We have to also pass
laws that provide certain monetary
incentives and tax credits (to energy
companies)," Calvo said.
Calvo added that he does not think
nuclear power will play a dominant
role as an energy source in the next
decade unless the problem of dis
posal of nuclear wastes can be sol

ved.
He pointed out that the legislature
has passed two bills which make it
easier for companies to develop
geothermal power sources which
presently exist in the Imperial Valley.
He also said he is working on legisla
tion that will encourage co
generation as an energy source. Co
generation is the use of excess heat
produced in industrial processes for
the production of energy.
Modernize plants
Calvo said he feels that existing
power plants should be modernized
to add additional capacity. Although
he is not a strong proponent of coal,
he said it should not be dismissed as
a possible energy source.
Calvo said he recognized that, for
most residential and industrial
needs, solar energy will not be prac
tical forsometime. However, he said
that he and his committee have
proposed bills, which have since
been signed into law, which encour
age the development of solar and
other sources of energy.
To help solve the state's housing
shortage Calvo said he encourages
new approaches to land use. He also
said the state can help alleviate prob
lems through better public transpor
tation.
"Housing might be available (for
an organization's employees) . . .
but the housing is 15 or 20 miles
away. How do we move those people
(to their workplaces) when our
highway arterials are already over
burdened?" he asked.
"Working with public transporta

tion . . . becomes an essential ele
ment (in dealing with the problem),"
he said.
Calvo said he supports rent relief
for tenants and said that unless thero
are widespread voluntary rent-relief
programs adopted by landlords,
which he felt is unlikely, he will sup
port some sort of state-wide program
to allow renters to share in the sav
ings from Proposition 13.
Calvo expressed concern over the
continuing loss of "prime agricul
tural land" in the state. He said that
approximately 50,000 acres in the
state are converted each year to
other uses. Citing the importance of

agriculture as California's biggest
business, he said he wants to make
this prime land "inviolate" by provid
ing new zoning procedures and
more economic incentives to keep
these lands in agricultural produc
tion.
Prop. 13 wake
In the wake of Proposition 13,
Calvo said the state will have to
prioritize its spending by deciding
which services are the most essen
tial. He said he wants to make sure
that public education continues to
have adequate funding, but also that
it remains under local control.
Health and welfare programs must

be maintained, he added.
Calvo favors the elimination of the
business inventory tax and a stream
lining of regulatory controls "to
allow (business) to function more
freely." He also wants to make loans
more easily available to small
businesses.
Calvo supported a bill which
would have lowered the drinking age
in California to 19. He said he has also
supported all the laws that have re
duced the penalties for the use of
marijuana, but said he needed
"more time to think" before taking a
position on the legalization of the
drug.

Calvo said he feels the state water
supply is "in pretty good shape right
now." He said he is not in favor of
damming any of the state's remain
ing wild rivers. Since such bills will
have to go through his committee,
Calvo stated, "I just would not allow
that (the damming) to occur."
Calvo also said that he sees a
"leveling-off" of the state's medical
malpractice problems. He noted that
some bills had been passed to deal
with the problem and that he wanted
to wait to see if they will have any
effect. "I don't think there's any new
radical approach we can take at this
time," he said.
