# Cards back into Pac-10 lead
## Poloists douse Pepperdine, LBS 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
Without playing a confer
ence game this weekend, the
Stanford water polo team
gained an undisputed lock on
first place in the Pacific-10.
Before the weekend's con
tests, Stanford and California
were tied for first with unde
feated Pac-10 records. How
ever, while the Cards crushed
Pepperdine, 9-5, and de
molishea Long Beach State,
10-4, Cal had problems, losing
to USC and edging Long Beach
in overtime.
According to coach Dante
Dettamanti, Stanford's per
formance against Pepperdine

Friday was, in a word, "unim
pressive."
"I just didn't feel good about
the way we played," De
ttamanti said. "The only thing
that was going well was the
fast-break."
Part of the reason for Stan
ford's sub-par effort, said De
ttamanti, was the unorthodox
style of play the Waves
employed.
"They don't drive," De
ttamanti explained. "Every
other team in the country
drives, but against Pepperdine,
basically we were just trying to
stop one man."

That "one man" was Terry
Schroeder, the hole man for
the Waves, who is also the hole
man for the U.S. Olympic
team.
Against the Cards,
Schroeder managed only two
goals.
"I thought we did a good job
stopping him," Dettamanti
said.
Senior Robby Arnold led the
offense for Stanford with three
goals against the Waves, and
senior Tom Angelo and
freshman Alan Mouchawar
each added two to the Stanford
tally.

Friday night, the team went
to scout Long Beach State and
watched as the 49ers took Cal
into overtime. But when the
Cards took on Long Beach
Saturday night, the story was
different.
Stanford immediately
jumped out to a lead against
the 49ers, holding the hosts to
only two goals for the first
three quarters while scoring 10
of their own. With the Cards'
second unit in for the entire
fourth quarter, Long Beach
managed their final two goals.
"We really shut them down
defensively," said Dettamanti.
As against Pepperdine, the
Cardinal fast-break played a
major role in breaking the
49ers.
"The fast-break was really
good," Dettamanti said. "We
try to position ourselves on de
fense so we can have a free
man and we're able to react
because we have (John) Gansel
in the goal and we can count on
him to block it."
Arnold and freshman Chris
Kelsey each scored three goals
to pace the Stanford attack and
Angelo added two.
The victories give the Cards
an 18-0-1 record, but De
ttamanti still isn't predicting a
berth in the NCAAs.
"We haven't assured ourse
lves of a berth yet," the coach
said. "We still have three tough
games left â€” two against Cal
and one against USC."


Robby Arnold, who scored six goals this weekend, prepares to pass against UCLA. Stanford is now the
indisputable leader in the Pac-10 race with Cal's loss to USC.
