# Spartans dump spikers; Cards sweep Bulldogs
## 
### MIKE O'NEAL 
The Stanford women's volleyball team, playing without Chris Anderson
who is out for the season with a broken foot, ran into a tough San Jose State
team Friday night and went down hard in four games. The loss extinguishes
all but the faintest hopes of post-season play for the Cards as Stanford's fate is
now in the hands of San Jose State.
The Spartans must lose two conference matches, which is highly unlikely,
before Stanford can even be considered for the regional berth. The Cards will
probably finish second in the NCAC but this is little compensation for the fine
volleyball they have played all season as only one team can be sent to the
regionals.
Friday's match was no exception. Sporting new uniforms, the Cardinal
spikers provided the large and supportive crowd with something to shout
about on every point. One fan described the match as "electrifying."
Losing the first game quickly 5-6, Stanford came out in the second contest
more ready to play. With some long rallies and exciting side-outs, the Cards
played even with San Jose State until 4-4. But the momentum shifted to the
Spartans' side and they quickly jumped up 13-5. Stanford rallied to 13-8 on
some inspired play by Jan Linden and Liz Hughes only to go down 15-8.
Stanford came out flat in the third game and was forced into mistakes by the
fired-up San Jose State front line. However, after dropping quickly into a 4-1
deficit, the Cards pulled themselves together after a time out and came back
to tie the game at 5-5. The contest remained close until at 10-10 Stanford took
the edge from the Spartans and stayed alive to win 15-10. Again the spark that
set off Stanford's engine was Linden's stellar offense in "her best game of the
season," according to Stanford coach Fred Sturm.
In the fourth game the Spartans forced Stanford to make the sort of mental
mistakes that build on each other going ahead 11-5. The Cards fought back,
only to lose it 15-10. "San Jose State was just the better team tonight," Sturm
said.
Stanford played well in the fourth game and, though hindered by some
inconsistency, most of the match was marked by long rallies and scrappy
play. "They out-scrapped us," Hughes said.
The disappointed spikers rebounded strongly against Fresno State Satur
day and destroyed the Bulldogs in three games 15-9, 15-10 and 15-1. The
volleyball team now holds a 6-4 record overall and travels to Santa Clara
tomorrow for a 7:30 p.m. match.

Bassett, No. 1, looks on. The loss suffered at the hands of San Jose State last
weekend has almost assuredly cost the team a berth for regionals.
