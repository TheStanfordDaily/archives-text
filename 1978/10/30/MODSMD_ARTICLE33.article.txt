Smith doubts elections by Dec. 31
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith, who
seven months ago agreed to black-majority rule for
Rhodesia by the end of the year, said yesterday he
doubts his government can meet that deadline for the
promised hand-over of power.
This was Smith's first public acknowledgement of
what had long been predicted here — that the escalating
guerrilla warwould effectively ruleout holding peaceful
elections in Rhodesia's embattled countryside.
Smith, speaking at a news conference, said only that
the administration he heads with three black leaders was
having difficulty planning Rhodesia's first universal
suffrage elections, which had been scheduled to be held
by Dec. 31.
The white prime minister said it was almost certain
that "this exercise will spill over a few months into 1979."
The military command reported, meanwhile, that a
Rhodesian border outpost was shelled from neighbor
ing Zambia, the first such attack since Salisbury's forces
raided a dozen Rhodesian guerrilla camps in Zambia
Oct. 19, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
A communique said there was neither damage nor
casualties in the brief attack Saturday night.
Israeli radio says U.S. halts talks
Jerusalem — The United States has frozen the Israeli-
Egyptian peace negotiations while Washington awaits a
letter from Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to
President jimmy Carter, Israel Radio reported yesterday.
The radio's Washington correspondent, quoting U.S.
sources, said the State Department was analyzing the
Israeli and Egyptian positions, which include proposals
for "far-reaching changes" in the draft worked out by
the two sides before the Israeli delegation's return home
last week.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Ken
Brown declined comment when asked specifically
whether the talks were frozen, as Israel Radio reported.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance met with the two coun
tries' delegations separately Saturday, but no talks were
scheduled for yesterday.
Israel Radio said the Americans, after Begin's letter is
received, will prepare a new draft treaty to bridge the
differences separating the two sides.
Begin's letter was in reply to American complaints —
including a cable from Carter — that Israel's decision to
expand existing Jewish settlements in the occupied
West Bank of the jordan River was detrimental to the
peace talks.
Curb says Dymally will be indicted
Los Angeles — Mike Curb, the Republican candidate
for lieutenant governor, said yesterday he is "certain"
that Democratic incumbent Mervyn Dymally "will be
indicted for criminal wrongdoings."
"I don't want to be the accuser here. I want to be the
individual coming to a logical conclusion," Curb said in
a telephone interview.
In a speech Saturday night in Redlands, Curb had said
he was "certain" that Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally is a crimi
nal, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported in its Sunday
editions.
However, Curb told reporters after his speech to 300
supporters that he had no first-hand knowledge that
Dymally has committed any crimes. The newspaper
quoted Curb as saying he was basing his remarks on
newspaper articles "that prove his (Dymally's) guilt."
Curb claimed Dymally had used public funds in pri

vate business deals and had "diverted public funds into
his own pocket," the newspaper said.
Curb told The Associated Press yesterday that he was
reaching his conclusion based on a Bill Stout editorial on
KNXT-TV, Los Angeles, a statement by Attorney General
Evelle Younger and a published report last week in the
Los Angeles Times. All three dealt with whether suffi
cient evidence exists to seek an indictment against Dym
ally.
Dymally could not be reached for comment.
Brown, Younger debate tax policy
Los Angeles — Gov. jerry Brown — matching Republi
can Evelle Younger's tatfjcut promises — pledged yes
terday that he would cut taxes another $1 billion next
year if the state has the kind of surplus Younger predicts.
Unlike the first two debates between the gubernato
rial rivals, yesterday's 60-minute confrontation on
KNXT-TV in Los Angeles was relatively free of the per
sonal smears and attacks that dominated earlier face-to
face meetings.
The Democratic governor and his Republican rival
talked more about issues in their third televised debate,
drawing the sharpest difference between them over
nuclear power, which Younger strongly supports and
Brown opposes.
But they showed more disagreement over methods
than over goals, as both advocated tax cuts and economy
in government and both voice personal opposition to
busing.
And Brown and Younger clashed — as they have in
every debate — over estimates of future surpluses in the
state treasury.
Eight die in Iranian protests
Tehran, Iran — Thousands of protesters clashed with
security forces across Iran again yesterday, defying the
government's prohibition against demonstrations. Offi
cials said at least eight persons were killed.
Troops used tear gas and fired guns into the air to
disperse thousands of protesters in Tehran. No injuries
were reported, although riots in many parts of the capi
tal lasted all day.
Military trucks, armored cars and tanks rolled down
streets leading to Tehran University, where more than
10,000 persons gathered to demand the resignation of
the government and shout support for an exiled religi
ous leader.
An estimated 10,000 supporters of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi staged a counter-demonstration in Tehran,
shouting "Long Live the shah!" Police dispersed the
anti-government protesters before the opposing fac
tions could confront each other.
Reports reaching Tehran said anti-government de
monstrations occurred in 37 cities and towns, including
Kermanshah and Dezful, where the eight deaths were
reported.
Soviets to be sentenced for spying
Newark, N.J. — Two Soviets who face a maximum life
prison term for espionage sentenced today by a federal
judge who says they "demonstrated they hold no love
for this country."
The pair, both employees at the United Nations be
fore their arrest, were to appear for sentencing before
U.S. District judge Frederick Lacey for their conviction
on three counts of espionage. There is no minimum
mandatory sentence.
Valdik Enger, 39, and Rudolf Chernyayev, 43, were

found guilty Oct. 13 after a two-week trial.
The two were charged with conspiring with a Soviet
diplomat to pass U.S. defense secrets to their homeland.
The diplomat, Vladimir Zinyakin, was named as a co
conspirator but not indicted because of diplomatic im
munity. Attorneys for Enger and Chernyayev said they
would appeal.
Newspaper strike settlement seen
New York — A veteran labor mediator said New York's
12-week-old newspaper strike might be "wrapped up"
in a bargaining session that began yesterday and was
expected to last until this morning.
"I think they all want to get this thing over with," said
mediator Theodore Kheel as representatives of
pressmen and The New York Times and the Daily News
went into negotiations yesterday.
"The main job will be getting the agreement properly
set up in some kind of writing that can be submitted to
the members," Kheel said.

Kheel characterized the dispute as 70 percent settled.
He said "five or six collections of issues" were unresol
ved.
Those issues included the guarantee of five work
shifts for all active pressmen, work hours, various shop
practices and union demands dealing with arbitration
awards and grievance procedures, he said.
Kheel said the agreement reached last week on the
thorny problem of manning in the pressrooms, which
sparked the strike, was "as solid and firm as it can be,"
and in no danger of falling apart.
At the time of that agreement, Kheel estimated that
the remaining 30 percent of the contract could be ham
mered out within 48 hours.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Colder nights but warming
trend beginning tomorrow. Lows in the upper 30s and
40s. Highs today in the upper 60s to mid 70s and tomor
row in the 70s to low 80s.

Israeli radio says U.S. halts talks
Jerusalem — The United States has frozen the Israeli-
Egyptian peace negotiations while Washington awaits a
letter from Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to
President jimmy Carter, Israel Radio reported yesterday.
The radio's Washington correspondent, quoting U.S.
sources, said the State Department was analyzing the
Israeli and Egyptian positions, which include proposals
for "far-reaching changes" in the draft worked out by
the two sides before the Israeli delegation's return home
last week.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Ken
Brown declined comment when asked specifically
whether the talks were frozen, as Israel Radio reported.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance met with the two coun
tries' delegations separately Saturday, but no talks were
scheduled for yesterday.
Israel Radio said the Americans, after Begin's letter is
received, will prepare a new draft treaty to bridge the
differences separating the two sides.
Begin's letter was in reply to American complaints —
including a cable from Carter — that Israel's decision to
expand existing Jewish settlements in the occupied
West Bank of the jordan River was detrimental to the
peace talks.
Curb says Dymally will be indicted
Los Angeles — Mike Curb, the Republican candidate
for lieutenant governor, said yesterday he is "certain"
that Democratic incumbent Mervyn Dymally "will be
indicted for criminal wrongdoings."
"I don't want to be the accuser here. I want to be the
individual coming to a logical conclusion," Curb said in
a telephone interview.
In a speech Saturday night in Redlands, Curb had said
he was "certain" that Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally is a crimi
nal, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported in its Sunday
editions.
However, Curb told reporters after his speech to 300
supporters that he had no first-hand knowledge that
Dymally has committed any crimes. The newspaper
quoted Curb as saying he was basing his remarks on
newspaper articles "that prove his (Dymally's) guilt."
Curb claimed Dymally had used public funds in pri

vate business deals and had "diverted public funds into
his own pocket," the newspaper said.
Curb told The Associated Press yesterday that he was
reaching his conclusion based on a Bill Stout editorial on
KNXT-TV, Los Angeles, a statement by Attorney General
Evelle Younger and a published report last week in the
Los Angeles Times. All three dealt with whether suffi
cient evidence exists to seek an indictment against Dym
ally.
Dymally could not be reached for comment.
Brown, Younger debate tax policy
Los Angeles — Gov. jerry Brown — matching Republi
can Evelle Younger's tatfjcut promises — pledged yes
terday that he would cut taxes another $1 billion next
year if the state has the kind of surplus Younger predicts.
Unlike the first two debates between the gubernato
rial rivals, yesterday's 60-minute confrontation on
KNXT-TV in Los Angeles was relatively free of the per
sonal smears and attacks that dominated earlier face-to
face meetings.
The Democratic governor and his Republican rival
talked more about issues in their third televised debate,
drawing the sharpest difference between them over
nuclear power, which Younger strongly supports and
Brown opposes.
But they showed more disagreement over methods
than over goals, as both advocated tax cuts and economy
in government and both voice personal opposition to
busing.
And Brown and Younger clashed — as they have in
every debate — over estimates of future surpluses in the
state treasury.
Eight die in Iranian protests
Tehran, Iran — Thousands of protesters clashed with
security forces across Iran again yesterday, defying the
government's prohibition against demonstrations. Offi
cials said at least eight persons were killed.
Troops used tear gas and fired guns into the air to
disperse thousands of protesters in Tehran. No injuries
were reported, although riots in many parts of the capi
tal lasted all day.
Military trucks, armored cars and tanks rolled down
streets leading to Tehran University, where more than
10,000 persons gathered to demand the resignation of
the government and shout support for an exiled religi
ous leader.
An estimated 10,000 supporters of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi staged a counter-demonstration in Tehran,
shouting "Long Live the shah!" Police dispersed the
anti-government protesters before the opposing fac
tions could confront each other.
Reports reaching Tehran said anti-government de
monstrations occurred in 37 cities and towns, including
Kermanshah and Dezful, where the eight deaths were
reported.
Soviets to be sentenced for spying
Newark, N.J. — Two Soviets who face a maximum life
prison term for espionage sentenced today by a federal
judge who says they "demonstrated they hold no love
for this country."
The pair, both employees at the United Nations be
fore their arrest, were to appear for sentencing before
U.S. District judge Frederick Lacey for their conviction
on three counts of espionage. There is no minimum
mandatory sentence.
Valdik Enger, 39, and Rudolf Chernyayev, 43, were

found guilty Oct. 13 after a two-week trial.
The two were charged with conspiring with a Soviet
diplomat to pass U.S. defense secrets to their homeland.
The diplomat, Vladimir Zinyakin, was named as a co
conspirator but not indicted because of diplomatic im
munity. Attorneys for Enger and Chernyayev said they
would appeal.
Newspaper strike settlement seen
New York — A veteran labor mediator said New York's
12-week-old newspaper strike might be "wrapped up"
in a bargaining session that began yesterday and was
expected to last until this morning.
"I think they all want to get this thing over with," said
mediator Theodore Kheel as representatives of
pressmen and The New York Times and the Daily News
went into negotiations yesterday.
"The main job will be getting the agreement properly
set up in some kind of writing that can be submitted to
the members," Kheel said.

Kheel characterized the dispute as 70 percent settled.
He said "five or six collections of issues" were unresol
ved.
Those issues included the guarantee of five work
shifts for all active pressmen, work hours, various shop
practices and union demands dealing with arbitration
awards and grievance procedures, he said.
Kheel said the agreement reached last week on the
thorny problem of manning in the pressrooms, which
sparked the strike, was "as solid and firm as it can be,"
and in no danger of falling apart.
At the time of that agreement, Kheel estimated that
the remaining 30 percent of the contract could be ham
mered out within 48 hours.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Colder nights but warming
trend beginning tomorrow. Lows in the upper 30s and
40s. Highs today in the upper 60s to mid 70s and tomor
row in the 70s to low 80s.
Smith doubts elections by Dec. 31
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith, who
seven months ago agreed to black-majority rule for
Rhodesia by the end of the year, said yesterday he
doubts his government can meet that deadline for the
promised hand-over of power.
This was Smith's first public acknowledgement of
what had long been predicted here — that the escalating
guerrilla warwould effectively ruleout holding peaceful
elections in Rhodesia's embattled countryside.
Smith, speaking at a news conference, said only that
the administration he heads with three black leaders was
having difficulty planning Rhodesia's first universal
suffrage elections, which had been scheduled to be held
by Dec. 31.
The white prime minister said it was almost certain
that "this exercise will spill over a few months into 1979."
The military command reported, meanwhile, that a
Rhodesian border outpost was shelled from neighbor
ing Zambia, the first such attack since Salisbury's forces
raided a dozen Rhodesian guerrilla camps in Zambia
Oct. 19, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
A communique said there was neither damage nor
casualties in the brief attack Saturday night.

received, will prepare a new draft treaty to bridge the
differences separating the two sides.
Begin's letter was in reply to American complaints —
including a cable from Carter — that Israel's decision to
expand existing Jewish settlements in the occupied
West Bank of the jordan River was detrimental to the
peace talks.
Curb says Dymally will be indicted
Los Angeles — Mike Curb, the Republican candidate
for lieutenant governor, said yesterday he is "certain"
that Democratic incumbent Mervyn Dymally "will be
indicted for criminal wrongdoings."
"I don't want to be the accuser here. I want to be the
individual coming to a logical conclusion," Curb said in
a telephone interview.
In a speech Saturday night in Redlands, Curb had said
he was "certain" that Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally is a crimi
nal, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported in its Sunday
editions.
However, Curb told reporters after his speech to 300
supporters that he had no first-hand knowledge that
Dymally has committed any crimes. The newspaper
quoted Curb as saying he was basing his remarks on
newspaper articles "that prove his (Dymally's) guilt."
Curb claimed Dymally had used public funds in pri

vate business deals and had "diverted public funds into
his own pocket," the newspaper said.
Curb told The Associated Press yesterday that he was
reaching his conclusion based on a Bill Stout editorial on
KNXT-TV, Los Angeles, a statement by Attorney General
Evelle Younger and a published report last week in the
Los Angeles Times. All three dealt with whether suffi
cient evidence exists to seek an indictment against Dym
ally.
Dymally could not be reached for comment.
Brown, Younger debate tax policy
Los Angeles — Gov. jerry Brown — matching Republi
can Evelle Younger's tatfjcut promises — pledged yes
terday that he would cut taxes another $1 billion next
year if the state has the kind of surplus Younger predicts.
Unlike the first two debates between the gubernato
rial rivals, yesterday's 60-minute confrontation on
KNXT-TV in Los Angeles was relatively free of the per
sonal smears and attacks that dominated earlier face-to
face meetings.
The Democratic governor and his Republican rival
talked more about issues in their third televised debate,
drawing the sharpest difference between them over
nuclear power, which Younger strongly supports and
Brown opposes.
But they showed more disagreement over methods
than over goals, as both advocated tax cuts and economy
in government and both voice personal opposition to
busing.
And Brown and Younger clashed — as they have in
every debate — over estimates of future surpluses in the
state treasury.
Eight die in Iranian protests
Tehran, Iran — Thousands of protesters clashed with
security forces across Iran again yesterday, defying the
government's prohibition against demonstrations. Offi
cials said at least eight persons were killed.
Troops used tear gas and fired guns into the air to
disperse thousands of protesters in Tehran. No injuries
were reported, although riots in many parts of the capi
tal lasted all day.
Military trucks, armored cars and tanks rolled down
streets leading to Tehran University, where more than
10,000 persons gathered to demand the resignation of
the government and shout support for an exiled religi
ous leader.
An estimated 10,000 supporters of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi staged a counter-demonstration in Tehran,
shouting "Long Live the shah!" Police dispersed the
anti-government protesters before the opposing fac
tions could confront each other.
Reports reaching Tehran said anti-government de
monstrations occurred in 37 cities and towns, including
Kermanshah and Dezful, where the eight deaths were
reported.
Soviets to be sentenced for spying
Newark, N.J. — Two Soviets who face a maximum life
prison term for espionage sentenced today by a federal
judge who says they "demonstrated they hold no love
for this country."
The pair, both employees at the United Nations be
fore their arrest, were to appear for sentencing before
U.S. District judge Frederick Lacey for their conviction
on three counts of espionage. There is no minimum
mandatory sentence.
Valdik Enger, 39, and Rudolf Chernyayev, 43, were

found guilty Oct. 13 after a two-week trial.
The two were charged with conspiring with a Soviet
diplomat to pass U.S. defense secrets to their homeland.
The diplomat, Vladimir Zinyakin, was named as a co
conspirator but not indicted because of diplomatic im
munity. Attorneys for Enger and Chernyayev said they
would appeal.
Newspaper strike settlement seen
New York — A veteran labor mediator said New York's
12-week-old newspaper strike might be "wrapped up"
in a bargaining session that began yesterday and was
expected to last until this morning.
"I think they all want to get this thing over with," said
mediator Theodore Kheel as representatives of
pressmen and The New York Times and the Daily News
went into negotiations yesterday.
"The main job will be getting the agreement properly
set up in some kind of writing that can be submitted to
the members," Kheel said.

Kheel characterized the dispute as 70 percent settled.
He said "five or six collections of issues" were unresol
ved.
Those issues included the guarantee of five work
shifts for all active pressmen, work hours, various shop
practices and union demands dealing with arbitration
awards and grievance procedures, he said.
Kheel said the agreement reached last week on the
thorny problem of manning in the pressrooms, which
sparked the strike, was "as solid and firm as it can be,"
and in no danger of falling apart.
At the time of that agreement, Kheel estimated that
the remaining 30 percent of the contract could be ham
mered out within 48 hours.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Colder nights but warming
trend beginning tomorrow. Lows in the upper 30s and
40s. Highs today in the upper 60s to mid 70s and tomor

Smith doubts elections by Dec. 31
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith, who
seven months ago agreed to black-majority rule for
Rhodesia by the end of the year, said yesterday he
doubts his government can meet that deadline for the
promised hand-over of power.
This was Smith's first public acknowledgement of
what had long been predicted here — that the escalating
guerrilla warwould effectively ruleout holding peaceful
elections in Rhodesia's embattled countryside.
Smith, speaking at a news conference, said only that
the administration he heads with three black leaders was
having difficulty planning Rhodesia's first universal
suffrage elections, which had been scheduled to be held
by Dec. 31.
The white prime minister said it was almost certain
that "this exercise will spill over a few months into 1979."
The military command reported, meanwhile, that a
Rhodesian border outpost was shelled from neighbor
ing Zambia, the first such attack since Salisbury's forces
raided a dozen Rhodesian guerrilla camps in Zambia
Oct. 19, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
A communique said there was neither damage nor
casualties in the brief attack Saturday night.
Israeli radio says U.S. halts talks
Jerusalem — The United States has frozen the Israeli-
Egyptian peace negotiations while Washington awaits a
letter from Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to
President jimmy Carter, Israel Radio reported yesterday.
The radio's Washington correspondent, quoting U.S.
sources, said the State Department was analyzing the
Israeli and Egyptian positions, which include proposals
for "far-reaching changes" in the draft worked out by
the two sides before the Israeli delegation's return home
last week.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Ken
Brown declined comment when asked specifically
whether the talks were frozen, as Israel Radio reported.

Dymally has committed any crimes. The newspaper
quoted Curb as saying he was basing his remarks on
newspaper articles "that prove his (Dymally's) guilt."
Curb claimed Dymally had used public funds in pri

vate business deals and had "diverted public funds into
his own pocket," the newspaper said.
Curb told The Associated Press yesterday that he was
reaching his conclusion based on a Bill Stout editorial on
KNXT-TV, Los Angeles, a statement by Attorney General
Evelle Younger and a published report last week in the
Los Angeles Times. All three dealt with whether suffi
cient evidence exists to seek an indictment against Dym
ally.
Dymally could not be reached for comment.
Brown, Younger debate tax policy
Los Angeles — Gov. jerry Brown — matching Republi
can Evelle Younger's tatfjcut promises — pledged yes
terday that he would cut taxes another $1 billion next
year if the state has the kind of surplus Younger predicts.
Unlike the first two debates between the gubernato
rial rivals, yesterday's 60-minute confrontation on
KNXT-TV in Los Angeles was relatively free of the per
sonal smears and attacks that dominated earlier face-to
face meetings.
The Democratic governor and his Republican rival
talked more about issues in their third televised debate,
drawing the sharpest difference between them over
nuclear power, which Younger strongly supports and
Brown opposes.
But they showed more disagreement over methods
than over goals, as both advocated tax cuts and economy
in government and both voice personal opposition to
busing.
And Brown and Younger clashed — as they have in
every debate — over estimates of future surpluses in the
state treasury.
Eight die in Iranian protests
Tehran, Iran — Thousands of protesters clashed with
security forces across Iran again yesterday, defying the
government's prohibition against demonstrations. Offi
cials said at least eight persons were killed.
Troops used tear gas and fired guns into the air to
disperse thousands of protesters in Tehran. No injuries
were reported, although riots in many parts of the capi
tal lasted all day.
Military trucks, armored cars and tanks rolled down
streets leading to Tehran University, where more than
10,000 persons gathered to demand the resignation of
the government and shout support for an exiled religi
ous leader.
An estimated 10,000 supporters of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi staged a counter-demonstration in Tehran,
shouting "Long Live the shah!" Police dispersed the
anti-government protesters before the opposing fac
tions could confront each other.
Reports reaching Tehran said anti-government de
monstrations occurred in 37 cities and towns, including
Kermanshah and Dezful, where the eight deaths were
reported.
Soviets to be sentenced for spying
Newark, N.J. — Two Soviets who face a maximum life
prison term for espionage sentenced today by a federal
judge who says they "demonstrated they hold no love
for this country."
The pair, both employees at the United Nations be
fore their arrest, were to appear for sentencing before
U.S. District judge Frederick Lacey for their conviction
on three counts of espionage. There is no minimum
mandatory sentence.
Valdik Enger, 39, and Rudolf Chernyayev, 43, were

found guilty Oct. 13 after a two-week trial.
The two were charged with conspiring with a Soviet
diplomat to pass U.S. defense secrets to their homeland.
The diplomat, Vladimir Zinyakin, was named as a co
conspirator but not indicted because of diplomatic im
munity. Attorneys for Enger and Chernyayev said they
would appeal.
Newspaper strike settlement seen
New York — A veteran labor mediator said New York's
12-week-old newspaper strike might be "wrapped up"
in a bargaining session that began yesterday and was
expected to last until this morning.
"I think they all want to get this thing over with," said
mediator Theodore Kheel as representatives of
pressmen and The New York Times and the Daily News
went into negotiations yesterday.
"The main job will be getting the agreement properly
set up in some kind of writing that can be submitted to
the members," Kheel said.

Kheel characterized the dispute as 70 percent settled.
He said "five or six collections of issues" were unresol
ved.
Those issues included the guarantee of five work
shifts for all active pressmen, work hours, various shop
practices and union demands dealing with arbitration
awards and grievance procedures, he said.
Kheel said the agreement reached last week on the
thorny problem of manning in the pressrooms, which
sparked the strike, was "as solid and firm as it can be,"
and in no danger of falling apart.
At the time of that agreement, Kheel estimated that
the remaining 30 percent of the contract could be ham
mered out within 48 hours.
