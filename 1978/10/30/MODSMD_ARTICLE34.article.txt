Correction
In an article in Friday's Daily, Jane Fonda was mis
quoted as saying the Campaign for Economic Democ
racy has been instrumental in organizing grassroots
support for measures like Proposition 13. Fonda said
CED has been concerned with issues like Proposition 13
and has been organizing support for measures such as
Palo Alto's Measure H. The Daily regrets the error.
