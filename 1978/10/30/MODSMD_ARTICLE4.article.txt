Japanese Ambassador Fumihiko
Togo called the Japanese market "at
least as open as any other major mar
ket economy" in a speech on U.S.-
Japanese relations before the Com
monwealth Club Friday.
He denied that Japan is "flooding
the American market with Japanese
manufactured goods," thus
threatening American industry.
Japan only exports manufactured
goods because it has "almost no
thing else to offer the world," he
said.
Togo added that he hoped the
American people "do not look at the
Japanese market with an out-of-date

such as tariffs have been removed in
the last 15 years, to help expand
bilateral trade potential.
Moreover, the Japanese market is
"not too difficult or mysterious for
foreigners to penetrate," Togo said.
He said he supported U.S. Ambas
sador to Japan Mike Mansfield's as

sessment that opportunities for
American companies exist in Japan
"if they will come in for the long pull
and not the quick buck."

Togo conceded that Japan has set
some quotas on agricultural pro
ducts such as citrus and beef, but he
added that such restrictions are
common practice and that "even
these quotas have been gradually in
creased."
Togo said that expansion of citrus
and beef imports to Japan would only
marginally benefit the United States
but could cause "tragic social con
sequences" for farmers in Japan.
Responding to charges that
Japanese imports cost some Ameri
cans jobs, the ambassador said that
job expansion is taking place in what
he called the healthy American
economy â€” even in those industries
which consider themselves most
threatened by import competition.
