Japanese Ambassador Fumihiko
Togo called the Japanese market "at
least as open as any other major mar
ket economy" in a speech on U.S.-
Japanese relations before the Com
monwealth Club Friday.
He denied that Japan is "flooding
the American market with Japanese
manufactured goods," thus
threatening American industry.
Japan only exports manufactured
goods because it has "almost no
thing else to offer the world," he
said.
Togo added that he hoped the
American people "do not look at the
Japanese market with an out-of-date
image." He said protective features
such as tariffs have been removed in
the last 15 years, to help expand
bilateral trade potential.
Moreover, the Japanese market is
"not too difficult or mysterious for
foreigners to penetrate," Togo said.
He said he supported U.S. Ambas
sador to Japan Mike Mansfield's as

sessment that opportunities for
American companies exist in Japan
"if they will come in for the long pull
and not the quick buck."
Citrus, beef quotas
Togo conceded that Japan has set
some quotas on agricultural pro
ducts such as citrus and beef, but he
added that such restrictions are
common practice and that "even
these quotas have been gradually in
creased."
Togo said that expansion of citrus
and beef imports to Japan would only
marginally benefit the United States
but could cause "tragic social con
sequences" for farmers in Japan.
Responding to charges that
Japanese imports cost some Ameri
cans jobs, the ambassador said that
job expansion is taking place in what
he called the healthy American
economy — even in those industries
which consider themselves most
threatened by import competition.
"You cannot complain that im
ports are respoirsible for American
unemployment levels when un
employment is declining faster in
this country than anywhere else in
the world," he said.
U.S. trade deficit
Togo cited growing American de
pendence on costly energy imports
as a major cause of the U.S. trade
deficit. He stressed the need for
economic recovery in Western
Europe and Japan. A better economic
climate in those areas would help re
ctify the trade deficit imbalance by
providing larger markets for Ameri
can goods, he said.
"We are doing our best to stimu
late imports," Togo said.
Togo said he thought that the
economic aspects of the U.S.-
Japanese relationship are overem
phasized. His speech reflected

Japanese concern over the American
presence and security in East Asia.
"Economic relations must be car
ried out on the basis of peace and
stability," he said.
Can't be 'peacekeeper'
Togo conceded that the United
States "can't be a peacekeeper of all
the world" and that each country
should do its part. But "if the Rus
sians are expanding their military
capability, there is only U.S. military
strength to counter such force," he
cautioned.
The Japanese constitution,
enacted after WWII, renounces war
and the use of force in international
disputes, restricting Japan's military
capability.
U.S. military withdrawal from
South Korea worries Japan, accord
ing to Togo. "In view of the precari

ous military balance in South Korea,
we feel at this time that the U.S.
military presence is a very important
deterrent against the disruption of
peace there," he said.
'Treaty of Friendship'
The ambassador also said that the
recently-ratified Treaty of Friendship
between Japan and the People's Re
public of China is not directed
against the Soviet Union or the Un
ited States.
The treaty, which provides for sta
ble, friendly relations between Japan
and China, "does not affect the qual
ity of the relationship between the
United States and Japan," he said.
Japan recognized the People's Re
public of China in 1972 but continues
to maintain cultural and economic
relation with the Republican of China
(Taiwan).

manufactured goods," thus
threatening American industry.
Japan only exports manufactured
goods because it has "almost no
thing else to offer the world," he
said.
Togo added that he hoped the
American people "do not look at the
Japanese market with an out-of-date
image." He said protective features
such as tariffs have been removed in
the last 15 years, to help expand
bilateral trade potential.
Moreover, the Japanese market is
"not too difficult or mysterious for
foreigners to penetrate," Togo said.
He said he supported U.S. Ambas
sador to Japan Mike Mansfield's as

sessment that opportunities for
American companies exist in Japan
"if they will come in for the long pull
and not the quick buck."
Citrus, beef quotas
Togo conceded that Japan has set
some quotas on agricultural pro
ducts such as citrus and beef, but he
added that such restrictions are
common practice and that "even
these quotas have been gradually in
creased."
Togo said that expansion of citrus
and beef imports to Japan would only
marginally benefit the United States
but could cause "tragic social con
sequences" for farmers in Japan.
Responding to charges that
Japanese imports cost some Ameri
cans jobs, the ambassador said that
job expansion is taking place in what
he called the healthy American
economy — even in those industries
which consider themselves most
threatened by import competition.
"You cannot complain that im
ports are respoirsible for American
unemployment levels when un
employment is declining faster in
this country than anywhere else in
the world," he said.
U.S. trade deficit
Togo cited growing American de
pendence on costly energy imports
as a major cause of the U.S. trade
deficit. He stressed the need for
economic recovery in Western
Europe and Japan. A better economic
climate in those areas would help re
ctify the trade deficit imbalance by
providing larger markets for Ameri
can goods, he said.
"We are doing our best to stimu
late imports," Togo said.
Togo said he thought that the
economic aspects of the U.S.-
Japanese relationship are overem
phasized. His speech reflected

Japanese concern over the American
presence and security in East Asia.
"Economic relations must be car
ried out on the basis of peace and
stability," he said.
Can't be 'peacekeeper'
Togo conceded that the United
States "can't be a peacekeeper of all
the world" and that each country
should do its part. But "if the Rus
sians are expanding their military
capability, there is only U.S. military
strength to counter such force," he
cautioned.
The Japanese constitution,
enacted after WWII, renounces war
and the use of force in international
disputes, restricting Japan's military
capability.
U.S. military withdrawal from
South Korea worries Japan, accord
ing to Togo. "In view of the precari

ous military balance in South Korea,
we feel at this time that the U.S.
military presence is a very important
deterrent against the disruption of
peace there," he said.
'Treaty of Friendship'
The ambassador also said that the
recently-ratified Treaty of Friendship
between Japan and the People's Re
public of China is not directed
against the Soviet Union or the Un
ited States.
The treaty, which provides for sta
ble, friendly relations between Japan
and China, "does not affect the qual
ity of the relationship between the
United States and Japan," he said.
Japan recognized the People's Re
public of China in 1972 but continues
to maintain cultural and economic
relation with the Republican of China
(Taiwan).
