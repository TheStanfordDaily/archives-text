# Base camp manager describes incident
## Tragedy strikes climbers on way to summit 
### CRAIG DENNIS 
Vera Watson apparently fell to her
death within 45 minutes climbing
tihie of Camp V, the last stop-off
point before the summit of the
world's tenth-highest mountain, the
base camp leader said Friday at a
campus news conference.
Watson, 46, the wife of a University
professor, and Alison Chadwick-
Onyszkiewicz, 36, of Leeds, England,
were "on their way to the summit" of
Annapurna when disaster struck
Oct. 17, fellow mountaineer Christy
Tews said. Computer Science Prof.
John McCarthy, the director of
LOTS, received word of his wife's
death last Tuesday.
Tews, representing the American
Women's Himalayan Expedition, re
turned to San Francisco late Thurs
day.
"We'll never know exactly what
happened," she said. Roped to
gether, the two women died in a
"sliding fall" about 2000 feet down a
"steep, icy, snowy slope."
Hard mountain
"It was a very hard mountain to
climb," Tews added. "They were
climbing a steep and difficult route."
A lone Sherpa guide who planned to
accompany the team to the summit
was forced to turn back because of
illness early the day of the accident.
The base camp lost visual contact
through binoculars with the pair near
dusk, and concern mounted when
the climbers failed to make radio
contact upon reaching Camp V at the
24,500 foot level.
Two days later, Sherpa guides
found the women's bodies, but were
unable to retrieve them because they
were separated from the climbing
route by a deep crevasse.
A second unsuccessful attempt to
retrieve the bodies was made by two
expedition members, butexhaustion
and several frostbite cases forced the
clearing of the mountain on Oct. 22
to "avoid further risk to life," Tews
said.

"I don't know if the bodies will
ever be recovered," she said Friday.
Two other expedition members,
Irene Miller and Vera Komarkova,
had become the first Americans and
first women to reach the 26,558
summit two days before the tragedy.
They were far below Watson and
Chadwick, at Camp 111, when the ac
cident occurred.
"We climbed the mountain and
that was a tremendous success . . .
and .we were very saddened we lost
two team members," Tews said.
Annapurna has a reputation as one
of the most challenging climbs in the
Himalayas. Prior to the American
women's expedition, only three
other parties had reached the sum
mit. At least nine lives have been lost
in attempts by Japanese, Italian,
French, British and American clim
bers.
Big opportunity
McCarthy said last Thursday that
his late wife "looked upon this climb
as a big opportunity she never ex
pected to have."
Watson was the first woman to
solo climb Aconcagua in Argentina,
the highest peak in the Western
Hemisphere. But "she had never ex
pected to be invited to join an exped
ition to a major Himalayan peak,"
McCarthy said.
Tews described Watson as having
"a lovely childlike quality about her
that I found most charming."
A memorial service was held the
night before leaving the mountain,
and the two women's names were
added to seven others on a large rock
commemorating those climbers lost
on Annapurna.
"We shared with each other — the
significant things about Vera and Ali
son," Tews said.
Conquer summit
Despite the tragedy, Tews said the
climbers still felt elation that two of
them managed to conquer the sum
mit of the 26,545-foot Annapurna
main peak in Nepal.

She said she watched through
binoculars as Miller, 42, of Palo Alto,
and Komarkova, 35, of the University
of Colorado, reached the summit
with two Sherpa guides.
They planted three flagsat the top:
the flag of Nepal at the lowest point,
an American flag in the middle, and a
flag at the summit bearing the
legend: "A woman's place is on
top.''
The rest of the climbers are ex
pected to arrive in Katmandu, Nepal,
on Wednesday. Some of the team
members will return to the Bay Area
by Nov. 5 or 6, according to Tews.
Watson was born in 1932 in Dairen,
Manchuria, where she lived until
1953. She later moved to Brazil, then

to Canada in 1959 and the United
States in 1961.
She worked for IBM as a computer
programmer more than 15 years,
starting at its research laboratory in
Yorktown Heights, N.V. While she
lived in New York she became in
terested in rock climbing at the Rock
land and Shawangunk cliffs.
Watson moved to San lose four
years ago, continuing to work for
IBM, and married McCarthy in 1976.
Climbers on major expeditions
"think about the possibility" of acci
dents and death, McCarthy said last
week. "But it feels quite different
when it happens than when it's just
imagined. There's a lot more shock, a
lot more loss."
