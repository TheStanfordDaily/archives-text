# Slab serves as calendar
## 
### LAURIE MINSK 
In the lower courtyard of the
new Hoover building stands a
wood slab eight feet wide and
30 inches deep.
This cross-section, cut from
a 1090-year-old redwood, is the
Herbert Hoover Memorial
Growth-Ring Calendar, with 14
historical dates placed at the
appropriate tree rings.
Emeritus Education Prof.
Paul R. Hanna, a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover In
sitution, was instrumental in
acquiring the cross-section.
I Hanna first thought about
making the calendar in July
1«977, when the Hoover build
ifig was under construction.
He originally intended to use a
redwood slab, which he cut
from an old stump on his prop
erty.
| However, in February,
Hanna read about vandals cut
ting several redwoods in Hum
boldt State Park and decided to
call Russell Cahill, the director
oj the State Department of
Parks and Recreation, to ask if
tfiere might be a slab available
for his project.
Cahill first could not grant
h)s permission, because the
Hoover Institution is private
and after the vandals struck,
tlie slabs were designated to go
to public facilities. However,
Congress appropriated $7 mill
ion for construction of the
Hoover building which "made
us public," Hanna said, so

Cahill gave his permission.
After calling authorities at
Humboldt, Hanna and Darrell
Trent, associate director of the
Hoover Institution, selected a
cross-section, which was much
better quality than the one
Hanna originally had selected.
Using a rented truck, they
transported the three-ton slab
down to the University of
California Forest Products Lab
in Richmond. They arranged
with Prof. Fred Dickinson,
head of the lab, to cure the
piece, which entailed smoo
thing both sides and treating
the wood with a chemical sea
ler.
Then, Hanna and Trent went
to the Big Creek Lumber Com
pany in Davenport, where they
chose an eight-foot redwood
chunk to make the calendar
cradle, which was also readied
by the UC lab.
"They did a beautiful job
preparing it," Hanna said. It
was extremely difficult cutting
the log to fit the curves and
bumps of the cross-section, he
added. The whole process
took two months.
Meanwhile, Hanna and a
group of scholars chose 18
events to go on the calendar.
These dates range from the
tree's germination — 888 A.D.
— to the first moon walk
1969 — with four spaces de
voted to events in Herbert
Hoover's life.
After the events were cho

sen, brass and aluminum
marker plates depicting all the
dates then were cast.
Getting the slab and cradle
into the basement-level cour
tyard was not easy. They had to
prepare the floor to hold the
cross-section — three tons
plus the redwood cradle — be
cause they thought the exhibit
could fall through the tloor ot
the courtyard.
Protection
They placed the i ross
section undercover to protect it
from the elements, but be
cause the courtyard overhang
was only one inch higher than
the exhibit, placement was'dif
ficult. The marker plates were
placed on the tree rings after
the cross-section and cradle
were secured in the courtyard
— all in time for the Hoover
building's )ulv dedication
ceremony.
Hanna conservatively esti
mated the exhibit's cost at
$1500, which was paid bv the
Hoover Institution from pri
vate funds. That sum does not
include time volunteered by
the tree cutters in Humboldt
State Park and the cradle,
which was donated by the Big
Creek Lumber Company. \lso
not included were the nany
extra hours the UC Lab did not
charge for and the time spent
by the scholar in deckling
which historical dates should
go on the growth-ring c.tl n
dar.


Markers on the 1090-year-old slice of redwood tree, now on display at Hoover Institution, list events of
historical significance and events relating to the life of former president Herbert Hoover.
