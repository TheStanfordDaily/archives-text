# Mem Chu to hold special All Hallows Eve service
## 
### KATHY SHEIL 
The sound of tolling bells echoes throughout
the dimly-lit building. As the flickering jack-o
lanterns look on, the names of the dead are read
out and the sound of chanting rises from those
assembled.
This will be the scene at Memorial Church on
All Hallows Eve, Oct. 31. A special service com
bining the liturgical feasts of All Saints' Day and
All Souls' Day will be sponsored by the Canter
bury Foundation.
Halloween traditionally calls to mind images
of ghosts and goblins, witches and monsters,
trick-or-treating and bobbing for apples. Few
people connect Halloween with church ac
tivities, although the custom was originally a
religious one.
The custom began, in part, to counteract the
pagan Druid belief that on Nov. 1 and especially
the night before, the spirit of the dead escaped
from the underworld and returned to earth to
haunt the living.
The Christian celebration was meant to
change a "day of genuine fear to one of

thanksgiving," said Father Don Fox.
The Mem Chu service will consist ot two parts,
the first being a revival of a somber medieval
custom called a "Tinley." This includes a pro
cession during which partuipants chant the
"Dies Irae" or "Day of Wrath."
A tolling bell symbolizes "the mystical littini;
of prayers by sound," and the names of friends
and relatives who have died are read aloud dur
ing the intercessionary prayers. During this part
of the ceremony, the church will be darkened
and the celebrants will wear black vestments.
To celebrate the saints' day, the church will be
brightly lit during the second half and the vest
ments will be white. The purpose of the celebra
tion, said Father Fox, is to "give thanks for
people with faithful lives."
lack-o-lanterns, once used to scare away <>vil
spirits, will be used in a different way. 1 hey will
be carved with symbols representing diffen n'
saints and used to partially light the church.
After the service, the organizers plan a sort
of" costume party. Participants are encouraged
to come dressed as their favorite saint.
