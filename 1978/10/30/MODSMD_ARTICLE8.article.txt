## Editorials Brown effective leader 
### 
In the race for California governor,
Jerry Brown deserves reelection. His
past four years in office has proved
his effective leadership ability.
He is a politician who has taken
advantage of the right opportunities
during his four years in the gover
nor's chair. Brown's response to the
plight of minorities and farm workers
is commendable.
Despite his opposition to Proposi
tion 13 before it was approved, his
actions after the June election to
make sure it worked is praiseworthy.
He was opportunistic, but he rightly
recognized the will of the people and
made sure their desires were truly

represented.
In our opinion, his opponent
Evelle Younger has been a poor ad
ministrator during his eight year's in
the attorney general's seat. On an
admittedly personal note, Younger's
opposition to The Stanford Daily in
the recent Supreme Court search
warrant case is deplorable.
All voters should take a serious
look at Libertarian Party candidate Ed
Clark. Although Clark does not have
the money to make a serious run for
governor, his party's ideas are in
teresting, although not practical.
However, Brown's record war
rants his return to office.
