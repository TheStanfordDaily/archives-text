# No on Proposition 7
## 
### 
Proposition 7 is a measure de
signed to broaden the circumstances
in which the death penalty may be
imposed. It is another opportunistic
initiative sponsored by State Sen.
John Briggs and deserves rejection.
Last year the California legislature
enacted a carefully drafted death
penalty, one of the toughest in the
country designed to meet all tests of
constitutionality. ,
However, in the name of
"strengthening" the death penalty,
Proposition 7 embraces so many im
precisions and contradictions that it
invites rejection by the courts. And if
Proposition 7's addition of the death
penalty law makes the whole law un
constitutional, then Californians will
have no death penalty at all.
That is not what they want. They
have indicated repeatedly they favor
capital punishment. The present law
has not been given the opportunity

to demonstrate its effectiveness or
surmount legal challenges.
One major problem with Proposi
tion 7 is that it could leave juries con
fused. It brings in complicated new
provisions about aggravating and
mitigating factors and when they do
and do not apply. It also has at least
one ill-defined special cir
cumstances â€” "lying in wait."
Conceivably the passage of Prop
osition 7 could make it even more
difficult for a jury to render a deci
sion of guilty in a first-degree murder
case than it is now. Assuredly it
would expose a broader surface of
the law to attack and possible over
throw in appellate courts.
Presently, there is no need to
make the present death penalty law
stronger, and the only way to make
the existing death penalty more ef
fective is by a No vote on Proposition
7
