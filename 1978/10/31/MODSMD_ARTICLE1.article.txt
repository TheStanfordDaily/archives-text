# Reagan fields questions from students
## 
### SHERYL DAVIS 
San Jose — He's been in 26 states for 80 Repub
lican candidates since Labor Day, but yesterday
Ronald Reagan was back in his home state,
answering questions from Stanford students and
raising money for Republican candidates Evelle
Younger and Mike Curb.
The former California governor was in San )ose
speaking to an audience of nearly 400 at a fun
draising luncheon for the lieutenant governor
and gubernatorial candidates. Following the
luncheon, he held a news conference for a group
of Stanford communication students. Reagan
fielded questions on topics ranging from Proposi
tion 6 to his presidential aspirations.
Although he answered questions including why
he might want to run for president, Reagan did
not say whether he would be a candidate in 1980.
Still campaigning
But Reagan has not stopped campaigning since
he lost the Republican nomination to Gerald Ford
in 1976.
Following the loss, his campaign committee,
Citizens for Reagan, changed its name to Citizens
for the Republic (CFTR), and has continued to
operate with a staff of Reagan supporters. CFTR
works to get promising Republican congressional
candidates elected and this year has donated ap

proximately $400,000 to various campaigns
nationwide.
Age is a question that keeps popping up to
haunt Reagan. If he were to run and were elected
in 1980, Reagan would be 69 — a year older than
William Henry Harrison who still holds the
oldest-president honors.
Age-consciousness
Responding to questions concerning his age as
a possible campaign issue, Reagan replied, "I feel
fine, but I may have to arm-wrestle everyone to
prove it." In contrast to America's age
consciousness, Reagan said that on a recent trip
to |apan, people there thought he was too young
to become president.
Reagan said he doesn't feel that he or the Re
publican party should be written off or forgotten.
Despite the split between the conservatives and
the New Right movement in the party, and state
ments by candidates emphasizing that they are
not "typical Republicans," Reagan said that "I've
never seen as much unity as there is in the Repub
lican party now."
Proposition 13
"The Republicans need to do a better job of
communicating that what the people want is what
we have been doing," Reagan said. "What people
voted for with Proposition 13 is what we're ab

out."
A former New Deal Democrat during his days
as president of the Screen Actor's Guild, Reagan
admitted that there are ways that his show busi
ness experience helped him as governor during
the two terms he served from 1966 to 1974.
He said he learned that he could deal with
almost anyone after serving 20 years as negotiator
for the Guild.
Actor, politician
He was the polished actor and politician yes
terday. He appeared physically fit, although he
had some trouble hearing questions during the
press conference.
In the upcoming California balloting in
November, Reagan said that he will be voting
"no" on both Proposition 5 and 6. On Prop. 5 he
said, "the government is going too far in protect
ing us from ourselves," and on Prop. 6: "it's un
necessary and opens the possibility of possible
harm to innocent people."
On the chance that California may find itself
with a Democratic governor and a Republican
lieutenant governor, Reagan said, "I think it
would be great." He said it is conceivable that the
lieutenant governor could make political ap
pointments, *~n bills and veto legislation when
the governor is out of state.

with a Democratic governor and a Republican
lieutenant governor, Reagan said, "I think it
would be great." He said it is conceivable that the
lieutenant governor could make political ap
pointments, *~n bills and veto legislation when
the governor is out of state.

Ronald Reagan at a press conference for Stanford journalism students in San Jose yesterday.
San Jose — He's been in 26 states for 80 Repub
lican candidates since Labor Day, but yesterday
Ronald Reagan was back in his home state,
answering questions from Stanford students and
raising money for Republican candidates Evelle
Younger and Mike Curb.
The former California governor was in San )ose
speaking to an audience of nearly 400 at a fun
draising luncheon for the lieutenant governor
and gubernatorial candidates. Following the
luncheon, he held a news conference for a group
of Stanford communication students. Reagan
fielded questions on topics ranging from Proposi
tion 6 to his presidential aspirations.
Although he answered questions including why
he might want to run for president, Reagan did
not say whether he would be a candidate in 1980.
Still campaigning
But Reagan has not stopped campaigning since
he lost the Republican nomination to Gerald Ford
in 1976.
Following the loss, his campaign committee,
Citizens for Reagan, changed its name to Citizens
for the Republic (CFTR), and has continued to
operate with a staff of Reagan supporters. CFTR
works to get promising Republican congressional
candidates elected and this year has donated ap

proximately $400,000 to various campaigns
nationwide.
Age is a question that keeps popping up to
haunt Reagan. If he were to run and were elected
in 1980, Reagan would be 69 — a year older than
William Henry Harrison who still holds the
oldest-president honors.
Age-consciousness
Responding to questions concerning his age as
a possible campaign issue, Reagan replied, "I feel
fine, but I may have to arm-wrestle everyone to
prove it." In contrast to America's age
consciousness, Reagan said that on a recent trip
to |apan, people there thought he was too young
to become president.
Reagan said he doesn't feel that he or the Re
publican party should be written off or forgotten.
Despite the split between the conservatives and
the New Right movement in the party, and state
ments by candidates emphasizing that they are
not "typical Republicans," Reagan said that "I've
never seen as much unity as there is in the Repub
lican party now."
Proposition 13
"The Republicans need to do a better job of
communicating that what the people want is what
we have been doing," Reagan said. "What people
voted for with Proposition 13 is what we're ab

out."
A former New Deal Democrat during his days
as president of the Screen Actor's Guild, Reagan
admitted that there are ways that his show busi
ness experience helped him as governor during
the two terms he served from 1966 to 1974.
He said he learned that he could deal with
almost anyone after serving 20 years as negotiator
for the Guild.
Actor, politician
He was the polished actor and politician yes
terday. He appeared physically fit, although he
had some trouble hearing questions during the
press conference.
In the upcoming California balloting in
November, Reagan said that he will be voting
"no" on both Proposition 5 and 6. On Prop. 5 he
said, "the government is going too far in protect
ing us from ourselves," and on Prop. 6: "it's un
necessary and opens the possibility of possible
harm to innocent people."
On the chance that California may find itself
with a Democratic governor and a Republican
lieutenant governor, Reagan said, "I think it
would be great." He said it is conceivable that the
lieutenant governor could make political ap
pointments, *~n bills and veto legislation when
the governor is out of state.
