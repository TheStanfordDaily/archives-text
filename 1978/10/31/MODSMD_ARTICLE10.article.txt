# Clinic aids speech problems

Society is built around
words. Speaking, reading,
writing and even thinking de
pend upon a grasp of words
and their meanings. So what
does this mean for people
who have speech and lan
guage problems?
After the age of three hu
mans are "almost totally de
pendent on words," according
to Dr. Kathryn Beadle, director
of the Speech and Language
Clinic here. Humans are "con
stantly using language sys
tems.
Some children have trouble
with the first steps of language
development. Those problems
can lead to difficulties in
school and in later life, since
speech is the necessary pre
requisite for reading and writ
ing, Dr. Beadle said. In addi
tion, many people measure
"success" based on a person's
ability to speak, to read and to
write.
The Speech and Language
Clinic at the Children's Hospi
tal helps to solve speech dif
ficulties, most of which fall
into three inter-related
categories, Dr. Beadle said.
One major problem occurs
when children have difficulty
"decoding" the verbal sounds
they hear. A second major
problem concerns attention
span, and a third stumbling
block arises when a child has
good intake, or comprehen
sion, but the verbal "output"
is poor.
To deal with the variety of
language problems encoun
tered, the clinic has the two
basic programs, Dr. Beadle
said.
A preschool is run under the
direction of Dr. Donna
Dagenais for children whose
speech problems have been
detected at an early age. The
school runs five days a week,
with classes meeting three
hours each day just as "regu
lar" preschools. However, in
the clinic preschool, the chil
dren are bombarded with ver
bal sounds, Dr. Beadle said.
Often the children simply
need mere repetition to
"catch on," and overcome
their speech difficulties. The
f..ogram is designed to get the

children "ahead of the game,"
Dr. Beadle added, "a little
help may go a long way" in
solving potential learning dif
ficulties before they become
major.
The second program is
aimed toward people with less
obvious speech and language
problems, usually diagnosed
in children at an older age.
Both programs are oriented
toward solving speech prob
lems on an individual level,
according to Dr. Beadle.
This program also helps
people recovering from heart
attacks and operations involv
ing the speech aparatus.

In both programs, therapists
attempt to involve the patients
in everyday situations â€” situa
tions where speech and lan
guage are necessary.
Therapists also try to involve
the patients' families. One
way-mirrors and recording de
vices are used to allow families
to observe therapy techniques
to help them continue the
therapy at home.
Although attempts are made
to "pick up" speech and lan
guage problems early in a
child's life, there are some
problems which are not easily
diagnosed as language dif
ficulties.
