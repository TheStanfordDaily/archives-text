## Vending machine gets 'brain' 
### PETE VANSICKEL 
This is a story about a vend
ing machine that was given a
brain. This machine is in the
University Artificial Intelli
gence Laboratory, (Al Lab)
known to its users as "Foos
land." The Al Lab is a rather
enchanting place a tew miles
from the central University
campus. It is a place where
sophisticated research is being
conducted using computers;
place where miniature robots
and computer music are a re
alty; place where computers
are used to solve complex
mathematical problems; place
where you can sit at a prog
ramming terminal and com
municate with computer sci
entists at Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology or rer> •<> p
the latest news on T ln. As

sociated Press news wire. It's
also the home of a com
puterized vending machine.
But there was a time in the
land of Foos when the vending
machine didn't have a brain. It
seemed every machine in
Foosland had a brain. The
programming terminals had
brains and the printing
machines had brains.
Brainless, the vending
machine had no control over
its actions. It didn't care if all it
offered its users to eat were
Hostess Twinkies, fruit pies
and Fritos Corn Chips. It
didn't care if its users had to
have exact change to get it to
perform. It didn't care if it re
jected all your quarters.
Les Earnest, assistant direc
tor of the Al Lab said the basic
problem was that no one had

enough change or correct
change to use the machine.
Users couldn't very easily ob
tain correct change during
early morning hours. In addi
tion, no one really liked the
food the vending machine
company put in the machine,
Earnest said.
Researchers at the lab called
a meeting, at which various
solutions to the problem were
proposed. The possibility of
having a change machine in
stalled was considered. But
change machines are an ex
pensive form of another vend
ing machine. They also require
frequent service to install
change and insure correct op
eration. Instead, researchers
decided to "give the vending
machine a brain," by devising
an appropriate computer
program to produce vending
machine goods. Earnest said,
"For a few hundred dollars
worth of hardware and some
not too complicated prog
ramming the vending machine
was computerized." Now it
has its own teletype terminal
for human communication.The
teletype is connected to a
computer that is programmed
to interpret what an individual
has selected to eat. In turn,
the vending machine then re
sponds by producing the or
dered item. Digital Equipment
Corporation's KLIO computer
"runs" the vending machine
which has been named the
"Prancing Pony."
The Prancing Pony is so in
telligent its users don't need
correct change; in fact, they
don't need change at all. Users
type their Foosland passwords
and selections into the com
puter terminal. The Pony ser
vices the requests, commands
the user to "EAT! " and then
sends a bill at the end of the
month.
The Pony has a few amusing
features. One in every 128 re
quests is granted free-of
charge to the user. Another
added attraction which is a
favorite among the Al Lab
musicians is the option to
"Flip" for the cost of a selec
tion. Leland Smith, a musician
here, says, "It's the most hon
est game in town." When a
user types the letter "F" after
the food selection a program

runs that simulates the flip of a
coin. If the user wins the toss
he gets the selection for free
and the terminal types, "You
won! " then rings its bell. If
the user loses he pays double
the cost of his selection. Appa
rently musicians have reputa
tion for gambling on "Flip"
more often than other compu
ter scientists. "Musicians live
dangerously," Smith said. He
plays because he "likes to get
a free lunch once in awhile.
In order to implement all
this new vending machine
procedure several researhers
at the Al Lab negotiated with
the vending company and
bought the machine from
them. People soon staited
stocking the machine with
items such as delicatessen
sandwiches, yogurt, cottage
cheese, pork buns, potstic
kers, and a Chilean specialty,
empanadas. The Pony also
serves cold Budweiser,
Tuborg or Rainier. The com
puter, scanning data on the
user, can check his age
though. Anyone under 21
won't be served.
Charlie Hasselbach, an Al
Lab secretary, said she stocks
the Pony once each morning
and once in the late afternoon.
The Prancing Pony has been
satisfying the snacking appe
tites of people of Foosland for
six years. So then, why are
people off the Farm subjected
to the treatment of brainless
vending machines? Why ha
ven't vending machine com
panies taken up the banner of
the computer revolution that's
been going on all arond us for
10 years or more? Earnest said
several people from vending
companies visited the Al Lab
when the Prancing Pony was
first implemented but he
hasn't heard from anyone
since. Earnest said the Pony is
unique. He attributes this lack
of response to "technological
lethargy." People who man
ufacture vending machines
don't understand computers.
Making a computerized vend
ing machine requires an un
derstanding of both comput
ers and vending machines."
Apparently it takes too much
time and energy to convince
manufacturers this is the way
to go," Earnest said.*
