# Women organize Phi Daffa Duck
## 
### KATHY LANG 
With the return of sororities
to the University comes Phi
Daffa Duck (PDD), a women's
organization that is distin
guishable from sororities by
more than the unorthodox
quasi-Greek name.
Its creators, seniors Leesa
Fields, Shirley Gines and
Cathy Garzio, define their un
sorority as "a women's organi
zation for those who don't
want to join a sorority; a wo
men's consciousness-raising
group; hopefully, a commun
ity service organization."
Presently, PDD is comprised
of approximately 12 women,
who have decided that
"sororities aren't the answer,"
Gines said. The group meets
once a week, on Thursday
nights, "to bullshit," she ad
ded. This Thursday's meeting
will be different from the usual
meeting.
PDD's fifth meeting will
convene in Florence Moore's
Mirlo lounge. A representative
from "Friends Outside" will
speak to the group. Friends
Outside is a volunteer organi
zation that "speaks to convicts
and offers support to the
families of those in prison,"
Fields said. Fields expects PDD
will "somehow get involved
with Friends Outside, as some
sort of community service
function."
Meetings are usually held at
a member's residence. The
women assemble to discuss
problems and "have a good
time," Fields said. Currently,
the organization has no execu
tive leaders, such as a presi
dent. "I doubt there will be

any government because it
simply is unnecessary," Mary
McDaniel, a PDD member
said.
Though PDD members want
to be regarded as separate
from sororities, their "pur
pose is definitely not to rag on
the sororities. We don't want
to put down sororities," Fields
stated.
However, several weeks
ago, Fields, representing PDD,
stated on KZSU that, "The re
turn of sororities was really a
sick idea." Fields said, that in

retrospect, she didn't mean to
use "sick" in describing her
view of the return of
sororities. "It's just that the
selective nature of sororities
was not appealing."
The group formed in Flor
ence, Italy. Its creators were
picnicking in the Boboli Car
dens and read in the Daily that
sororities were returning to
campus.
"We were appalled and de
cided to form our own organi
zation," Cines said. The
group's first meeting was cal

led to determine the type of
activities the women wanted
to have. The women also dis
cussed what they disliked
about sororities. All members
reacted against the "sorority
stereotype, including the
selective exclusive nature of
sororities," Fields said.
"We really felt uncomforta
ble about what we perceived
as the exclusiveness of
sororities," McDaniel added.
Membership in the group is
open to all women here. Meet
ings are open.

a member's residence. The
women assemble to discuss
problems and "have a good
time," Fields said. Currently,
the organization has no execu
tive leaders, such as a presi
dent. "I doubt there will be

any government because it
simply is unnecessary," Mary
McDaniel, a PDD member
said.
Though PDD members want
to be regarded as separate
from sororities, their "pur
pose is definitely not to rag on
the sororities. We don't want
to put down sororities," Fields
stated.
However, several weeks
ago, Fields, representing PDD,
stated on KZSU that, "The re
turn of sororities was really a
sick idea." Fields said, that in

retrospect, she didn't mean to
use "sick" in describing her
view of the return of
sororities. "It's just that the
selective nature of sororities
was not appealing."
The group formed in Flor
ence, Italy. Its creators were
picnicking in the Boboli Car
dens and read in the Daily that
sororities were returning to
campus.
"We were appalled and de
cided to form our own organi
zation," Cines said. The
group's first meeting was cal

led to determine the type of
activities the women wanted
to have. The women also dis
cussed what they disliked
about sororities. All members
reacted against the "sorority
stereotype, including the
selective exclusive nature of
sororities," Fields said.
"We really felt uncomforta
ble about what we perceived
as the exclusiveness of
sororities," McDaniel added.
Membership in the group is
open to all women here. Meet
ings are open.
With the return of sororities
to the University comes Phi
Daffa Duck (PDD), a women's
organization that is distin
guishable from sororities by
more than the unorthodox
quasi-Greek name.
Its creators, seniors Leesa
Fields, Shirley Gines and
Cathy Garzio, define their un
sorority as "a women's organi
zation for those who don't
want to join a sorority; a wo
men's consciousness-raising
group; hopefully, a commun
ity service organization."
Presently, PDD is comprised
of approximately 12 women,
who have decided that
"sororities aren't the answer,"
Gines said. The group meets
once a week, on Thursday
nights, "to bullshit," she ad
ded. This Thursday's meeting
will be different from the usual
meeting.
PDD's fifth meeting will
convene in Florence Moore's
Mirlo lounge. A representative
from "Friends Outside" will
speak to the group. Friends
Outside is a volunteer organi
zation that "speaks to convicts
and offers support to the
families of those in prison,"
Fields said. Fields expects PDD
will "somehow get involved
with Friends Outside, as some
sort of community service
function."
