# Economics professor here examines high divorce rate
## 
### ROGER BATCHELOR 
Divorce rates have risen
dramatically since 1966. In 10
years, from 1962 to 1972, the
divorce rate doubled.
Economics Professor Robert
Michael, a specialist in labor
economics and director of the
local branch of the National
Bureau of Economic Research
here, is conducting research
as, "part of the thrust to study
divorce." He became in
terested in the topic because
of the sharp rise in the divorce
rate recently.
Why should an economist
be interested in marital prob
lems? Of course, sociologists
and psychologists have
studied the problem.
Economists have only recently
joined them. Rather than limit
ing themselves to studying
market economics, the be
havior of firms and
economies, some economists
are now investigating the
group behavior of humans,
the socioeconomic sphere of
behavior, Michael said. This is
"a little bit unorthodox" and
"controversial," he added.
"There is a good bit of skep
ticism from economists and
other social scientists as to
how powerful these economic
tools really are outside the
traditional areas of economics.
"Economics is at least 80
years old, while this study
(socioeconomics) is only
about 10 years old," Michael
added.
Economists approach prob
lems by "analyzing observable
group behavior, not opinions
or motives as sociologists and
social psychologists some
times do. We economists have
no background in it," Michael
said. Michael applies theories
developed for analyzing mar
ket systems to social prob
lems.
Michael is "big on seeing
marriage as a long term con
tract" with "implicit terms."
Failure of either party to carry
out the unstated terms in a
marriage contract is a "breach
of contract which terminates
it," causing divorce. Michael
applies various theories about
contracts and negotiation and
uses statistical methods of
analysis for market
economics.
Michael says a number of
unexpected occurrences or
actions can upset a marriage,
just as a contractual agree
ment may be disturbed. Unan
ticipated changes in income,
health, or the role of a spouse
can upset a marriage, Michael
said. When one partner re
ceives an inordinately high or

low income, the couple's rela
tions tend to be less stable,
Michael said. He thinks this is
because such incomes are sel
dom anticipated and are never
included in marriage con
tracts. No one could have pre-

dieted the changing role of
women and put it into a con
tract, Michael said.
Michael has also found that
young couples are more
divorce-prone. Michael thinks
that since "they don't know
enough about themselves,
they cannot put forth a good

contract." Also, "couples who
differ in culture, background,
and education have been
found to be more susceptible
to divorce."
There are still possibilities
for further research in the
economic study of the divorce
rate, according to Michael. A
cross-cultural study is neces
sary because "divorce rates
have risen rapidly in many
Western European countries
but not universally, so interna
tional data are both a rich
source and a major challenge.
"There is also surprisingly
little known about the repur
cussionsot marital instability."
Michael believes that the
spiralling upward trend in the
divorce rate might settle soon.
"The upward rate has already
slowed in the last two years."
The "baby boom effect," the
result of the great number of
births after World War 11,
"created a younger pool of
marriageables today who are
more prone to divorce."
Michael estimates the baby
boom effect will subside in
trom five to 20 years. This de
mographic factor is major.
Michael mathematically esti
mates one-third of all divorces
now are among people born
during the baby boom. The
trend of couples marrying at
older ages is growing.
Michael said that though fi
gures sometimes make the di
vorce situation look bleak,
"marriage as an institution is
not being abandoned. Rather,
each party in a marriage must
be sure to understand the
explicit and unstated parts of
the contract."
