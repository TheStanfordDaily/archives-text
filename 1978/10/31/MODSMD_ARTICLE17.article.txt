## Editorial Freedom of speech 
### 
Last Tuesday, a speech on campus
was prevented by disruptions of
students who disagreed with the
speaker's political stand. Continual
questions and loud heckling by stu
dents forced Sepehr Zabih, profes
sor of government at St. Mary's Col
lege, to cancel his talk.
This denial of free speech is highly
undesirable. The issue here is not
what the speaker may have said or
wanted to say; the fact that he rep
resented or upheld the legitimacy of
a repressive political regime should
not have any effect on our attitude
toward his right to express himself.
Free speech is not merely for
those who agree with us. For speech
to be "free," it means that the right
to express oneself must be ex
tended to those with whom we dis
agree.
Whether one approves or disap
proves of the regime in Iran is not
the question. Simply, if disagree
ment is to be expressed, it should
be stated through positive channels
such as a rally or debate of the op
posing view — not in the abrogation

of another's right to speak.
Had the places been reversed,
had it been the students attempting
to speak and "being shouted down"
— the students might have thought
differently about the action they
took.
Part of the alleged repressiveness
of the shah's government is his
supposed restriction on anti
government speech. But by prevent
ing the speaker from presenting his
views the students opposing the
shah's regime are guilty of repres
sion as well.
The organizers of the Bechtel
l-Center speech evidently were una
ware of the Iranian speaker's views.
If they had been, they might well
have realized the sensitivity of the
issue and arranged for a second
speaker to present an opposing
viewpoint.
But do not let the political issues
obscure the fundamental issue of
free speech. No speaker, no matter
how extreme his views, should be
prevented from expressing his or
her opinion.
