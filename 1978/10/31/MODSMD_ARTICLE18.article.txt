## 'Psyched' for mid-terms 
### 
Here they come. Those all
pervading shadows which en
velop the student body in
three weeks of agony. You've
got it — midterms. No matter
what your major is, or how
much money your dad makes,
or where you buy your socks,
you're not going to get away
from them. Here's how the
typical University student deals
with these marvelous inven
tions of our beloved academic
system.
Say you have a midterm in
history on Tuesday. Around
Friday you start getting nerv
ous. Friday morning you
spend an hour between clas
ses flipping through your 23-
page syllabus to see what you
haven't read yet — 3786 pages,
3725 of which are on reserve.
You promise yourself you'll
spend all weekend in the lib
rary.
Friday afternoon your
roommate's uncle (V.P. of
Hewlett-Packard) invited your
dorm to Trader Vic's for din
ner. You spend Saturday in
bed recovering from 14 rounds
of Mai Tais. You regain con
sciousness just in time to hit
the frat parties Saturday night.
Sunday you wake up ready
to roll — only to discover that
your roommate (still recover
ing from the frat parties) has
fallen off the top bunk and
broken his ankle. You both
pile into your car and head for
the hospital. You spend all af
ternoon in the emergency

room, watching the remains of
the University rugby team
come in for stitches. Realizing
the whole day is shot, you,
your roommate, a cast, and
two crutches head back to
campus in time for the Sunday
Flicks.
Monday morning you begin
getting panicky. Everyone in
the review section is asking
phenomenal questions and
you begin to wonder what
Fred Hargadon liked on your
application. That night, armed
with ASSU lecture notes, your
RA's midterm from last year,
and that blasted phone book
of a syllabus, you head for
Meyer.
You're about to go in when
you decide it would be a good
idea to get some coffee from
the vending machine. But
you're out of money. So you
sit on the orange vinyl couch
and wait for a familiar face to
go by.
Finally you see what's-her
name from your freshman
dorm. Smiling all the time, you
eventually acquire the crucial
coins. Unfortunately, her
generosity extends to a 45-
minute monologue of what
she's done since freshman
year. Later much, what's
your-name.
Three cups of coffee later,
your nerves wired by the caf
feine, you trudge up to the
third floor and slouch down in
another orange vinyl chair.
Amid popping flip tops, whis

pering, ruffling pages and
other distractions, you begin
to study. Every 20 minutes you
hop up to check the flashing
lights at the reserve desk to
see what's "in." Why do all
those jerks have to read the
stuff tonight, anyway? What a
hassle.
At 10 p.m. the "light
weights," studybreak bound,
start drifting out in packs of
two or three. At 10:30 the real
exodus begins. By 11:00
you're the only one left in the
room and it's getting embaras
sing. Rather than risk your
reputation (no one wants to be
a nerd, and besides, the whole
thing is so futile by now . . . ),
you decide to quit for the
night.
All the way home you keep
telling yourself that you never
really wanted to major in Poli
Sci, anyway. Law school just
isn't for everybody. In fact,
whose idea was college in the
first place? A good air condi
tioning repairman makes $15
an hour.
You keep up this banter
through two beers and the
"johnny Carson Show." But
after all, this is Stanford. As
you climb into bed you set the
alarm for 5 a.m. and stack the
ASSU lecture notes on your
desk. You can figure on a
good three hours of cramming
if you don't sleep through . . .

Monday morning you begin
getting panicky. Everyone in
the review section is asking
phenomenal questions and
you begin to wonder what
Fred Hargadon liked on your
application. That night, armed
with ASSU lecture notes, your
RA's midterm from last year,
and that blasted phone book
of a syllabus, you head for
Meyer.
You're about to go in when
you decide it would be a good
idea to get some coffee from
the vending machine. But
you're out of money. So you
sit on the orange vinyl couch
and wait for a familiar face to
go by.
Finally you see what's-her
name from your freshman
dorm. Smiling all the time, you
eventually acquire the crucial
coins. Unfortunately, her
generosity extends to a 45-
minute monologue of what
she's done since freshman
year. Later much, what's
your-name.
Three cups of coffee later,
your nerves wired by the caf
feine, you trudge up to the
third floor and slouch down in
another orange vinyl chair.
Amid popping flip tops, whis

pering, ruffling pages and
other distractions, you begin
to study. Every 20 minutes you
hop up to check the flashing
lights at the reserve desk to
see what's "in." Why do all
those jerks have to read the
stuff tonight, anyway? What a
hassle.
At 10 p.m. the "light
weights," studybreak bound,
start drifting out in packs of
two or three. At 10:30 the real
exodus begins. By 11:00
you're the only one left in the
room and it's getting embaras
sing. Rather than risk your
reputation (no one wants to be
a nerd, and besides, the whole
thing is so futile by now . . . ),
you decide to quit for the
night.
All the way home you keep
telling yourself that you never
really wanted to major in Poli
Sci, anyway. Law school just
isn't for everybody. In fact,
whose idea was college in the
first place? A good air condi
tioning repairman makes $15
an hour.
You keep up this banter
through two beers and the
"johnny Carson Show." But
after all, this is Stanford. As
you climb into bed you set the
alarm for 5 a.m. and stack the
ASSU lecture notes on your
desk. You can figure on a
good three hours of cramming
if you don't sleep through . . .
(Lois Nesbitt is a sophomore
majoring in communications
and art history.)
Here they come. Those all
pervading shadows which en
velop the student body in
three weeks of agony. You've
got it — midterms. No matter
what your major is, or how
much money your dad makes,
or where you buy your socks,
you're not going to get away
from them. Here's how the
typical University student deals
with these marvelous inven
tions of our beloved academic
system.
Say you have a midterm in
history on Tuesday. Around
Friday you start getting nerv
ous. Friday morning you
spend an hour between clas
ses flipping through your 23-
page syllabus to see what you
haven't read yet — 3786 pages,
3725 of which are on reserve.
You promise yourself you'll
spend all weekend in the lib
rary.
Friday afternoon your
roommate's uncle (V.P. of
Hewlett-Packard) invited your
dorm to Trader Vic's for din
ner. You spend Saturday in
bed recovering from 14 rounds
of Mai Tais. You regain con
sciousness just in time to hit
the frat parties Saturday night.
Sunday you wake up ready
to roll — only to discover that
your roommate (still recover
ing from the frat parties) has
fallen off the top bunk and
broken his ankle. You both
pile into your car and head for
the hospital. You spend all af
ternoon in the emergency

room, watching the remains of
the University rugby team
come in for stitches. Realizing
the whole day is shot, you,
your roommate, a cast, and
two crutches head back to
campus in time for the Sunday
Flicks.
