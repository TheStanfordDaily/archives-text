## Nader proposes an answer 
### 
A country that doesn't have time for citi
zen involvement, is a country that doesn't
have time for democracy.
Ralph Nader
Amidst the current wave of student
apathy, the national trend of self-assured
complacency and the uncritical accep
tance of mediocrity and the status quo,
Ralph Nader, consumer-advocate, spoke
last week at the University. He urged re
newed student activism, consumer
awareness and citizen participation —
necessary elements in the maintenance of
democracy. .
Nader advocated involvement, and he
advocated change — change through the
system. He appealed to our somewhat la
tent student values of educated inquiry,
critical concern and philosophic idealism.
Working together, Nader proclaimed,
"We can make a difference." He hit a
responsive chord. Indeed, over 200 Uni
versity students were inspired to sign par
ticipation forms for one of Nader's emerg
ing campus organizations.
Nader is perhaps the most charismatic
and conscientious heir to America's herit
age of progressive dissent — and is clearly
the most energetic and unscathed politi
cal survivor of the 60s. At first glance the
connection between Nader and the radi
cal tradition associated with the 60s seems
obscure. A drab, short-haired, Harvard
bred Lebanese lawyer, who shuns the
pleasures of the flesh and works through
the system in order to restore free enter
prise and cultivate the seeds of par
ticipatory democracy, Nader is by no
means militant. In many ways, however,
Nader represents the distilled essence of
what was good about the 60s, with all the
counter-productive elements sifted out.

Like the dissident youths of the past de
cade he calls for a healthier, freer
America. He is for "power to the people"
and for wrestling the control and defini
tion of the "public interest" out of the
hands of corporate management and put
ting it back in the hands of the people.
And yet amidst all this democratic
ideology, Nader is not an ideologue. On
the contrary, he argues, "don't fight over
symbols, fight over reality." He further
challenged students to match their
rhetoric with action. He taunted and he
critcized, but more than this he outlined a
plan, a vision for the future.
Nader's method works. Rather than ad
vancing some general, abstract, all
encompassing ideological scheme, he
single-mindedly attacks and exposes par
ticular problems. To Nader, the popular
reformist maxim rings true — "Sunshine
is the finest of disinfectants."
The strategy is not to attack the "official
values" of America, but rather to de
monstrate the extent of our institutional
hypocrisy and to reveal the system's fai
lures. Nader says he believes in free en
terprise, but he also knows it doesn't
exist. This approach has the advantage of
tapping a pre-existing consensus — it re
quires no radical thinking of our cultural
values. It insists only that our institutional
leaders abandon hypocrisy and live up to
their own professed ideals.
Nader made an intellectual appeal to
students, faculty and professionals alike
— to get involved. And, here at the Uni
versity, a practical framework for such ac
tion is being established. This Wednesday
the first meeting of a Public Interest Re
search Group (PIRC) will be held at 7
p.m. at American Studies.

With the encouragement of Ralph
Nader, over 350,000 students in 14 states
across the country have already begun
such programs. PIRG is a coalition of stu
dents, facutly and professionals —
lawyers, ecnomists, scientists and en
gineers — who investigate and initiate
solutions to community problems affect
ing consumer health, the environment,
government responsibility and other pub
lic concerns. These groups usually retain
a full-time staff of professionals funded by
a modest fee assessment and directed by
elected student boards. Within the PIRG
framework, diverse groups ranging from
minority and political organizations to
scientific associations can pool their
energy and abilities in a common cause.
PIRG's have proven to be potent in
sturments for the translation of student
ideals into pracical community action —
ranging from local reform of the jury
selection process, to their recent uncov
ering of a national multi-million dollar
meat packing scandal. Perhaps most im
portantly, participation in PIRG provides
the opportunity to strengthen one's
capacity to perform the duties of an active
citizen. It gives students the chance to
learn citizenship skills through experi
ence, combining those two essential
elements of a liberal education — thought
and action.
In light of Nader's most profound ap
peal, hopefully University students and
faculty will get involved and support the
newly emerging campus PIRG. It is our
chance to show that we still do have time
for democracy.
