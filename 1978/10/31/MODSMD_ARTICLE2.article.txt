# Mayor against vice-mayor
## Palo Alto rent measure debated 
### ALI WEBB 
Specters of court battles were
used as arguments against justice
and fairness in the Measure H de
bate Wednesday evening at the Palo
Alto Senior Citizen's Center. The
issue was rent control versus rent
relief and the conflict stemmed from
a difference in perspective.
Rent control would place a ceiling
on rent, while rent relief would pass
property tax savings that landlords
got from Proposition 13 on to re
nters.
Palo Alto Maypr Scott Carey and
Kermit Knopf, a local realtor,
squared off against Vice-mayor Alan
Henderson and Don Surath, a mer
chant, on the issue of landlord and
tenant reform. The special munici
pal election to be held with the gen
eral election on Nov. 7 sparked the
debate, which was jointly sponsored
by three community groups.
The proposed ordinance, Mea
sure H, would add a new title to the
municipal code, which would pass
on to renters a one-year rent reduc
tion in proportion to the property
tax savings received by landlords.
Under the measure, landlords
would be allowed to raise rents to
compensate for increased costs
which they have actually paid â€”
guaranteeing a "just and reasonable
rate of return on their property."
Tax relief inequity
Both sides agree that Proposition
13 provides for no direct tax relief
for renters. "I think that we all agree
that there is an inequity created
when landlords do not pass through
the savings that they are seeing from
Prop. 13 tax relief to their tenants,"
said Knopf, a member of the Palo
Altans Against Rent Control Com
mittee.
Henderson, speaking for the
Measure H, said, "The passage of
Proposition 13 resulted in substan
tial savings for all property owners.
That includes owners of rental
properties." He contended that
landlords, although eager to pass tax
costs on to tenants, were not so
eager to pass on their savings.
"All Measure H would do is to
pass back property tax savings for
one year.MeasureH is not rent con
trol," Henderson said.
Knopf disagreed, saying, "What
we have here is not rent relief but
rent control, hung on the coattails of
Proposition 13."
Carey, who also opposes Measure
H, said he spoke in his role as citi

zen, attorney and realtor, not as
mayor. He said the tax windfall be
nefits would simply shift from the
landlord to the tenants without solv
ing the basic inequities in the tax
system. The solution, he said, is to
be found at the state government
level.
One-year measure?
The pro-H forces contend that the
measure is a one-year attempt to ba
lance the savings from Proposition
13. "Hopefully the state will do
something in this period of time,"
Surath said.
Carey and Knopf disagreed that H
was a one-year measure." If you
read the initiative, everything goes
beyond one year except the provi
sion controlling rents," Carey
stated.
Henderson contended that the
measure must appear before the

voters after one year. But Carey said,
"If you don't think that the city
council can extend this measure I
suggest you check."
Charges of conspiracy and
counter-charges of funding by ves
ted interests were hurled from both
sides. Knopf and Carey said that an
outside organizer, "Mr. Blumberg"
was the "mastermind" behind the
proliferation of rent control mea
sures.
"If you think that this is a local
initiative, look at the initiatives in
Fresno, San Francisco or Berkeley. If
you don't think that they were writ
ten or masterminded by one person,
I'd be surprised," Carey said.
When asked for specific proof,
Knopf offered none.
Henderson and Surath denied
ever meeting a Mr. Blumberg. "I
