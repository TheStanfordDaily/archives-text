## Prop. 6 poses a threat to civil liberty 
### 
(Ed. note: This is the concluding segment
of the column which appeared yesterday.)
Briggs defines public homosexual con
duct as the "advocating, soliciting, impos
ing, encouraging or promoting of private
or public homosexual activity directed at,
or likely to come to the attention of,
school children and/or other employees"
in the school. This definition is badly writ
ten mish-mash. It seems to duplicate
existing law in the words "soliciting" and
"imposing." And it is impossible to know
what constitutes "advocating," "en
couraging " or promoting. But it is in
these last words — in this idea of "advo
cacy" — that we reach the potential of
this second category for the destruction
of civil liberties, not only of homosexuals.
Two hypothetical examples will reveal
the dangerous implications of this part of
the initiative. A heterosexual teacher in a
course on human sexuality for high
school seniors decides to use the text by
Herant Katchadourian and Donald Lunde.
Chapter 11 includes the statements that
64 percent of the 76 societies surveyed by
Ford and Beach approve some forms of
homosexualtiy and that "references to
certain kinds of behavior as 'natural' and
to others as 'unnatural' are difficult to
substantiate on the evidence of what ac
tually occrus in nature." If a school board
considers these statements to be "en
couraging" homosexuality it can fire the
teacher.
A heterosexual teacher of an Advanced
Placement cburse in drama assigns Mar
lowe's Edward II because he considers it
the best play in English before Shakes
peare. The play deals in part with Ed
ward's homosexuality. A student says he
finds the play replusive because it treats
this disgusting and unnatural subject. The
teacher responds that Marlowe himself
was probably homosexual, that 64 per
cent of the societies surveyed approve
some forms of homosexualtiy, and that he
himself does not regard homosexuality as

unnatural. The student, not receiving the
high grade he expects, reports the
teacher to the school board and the
teacher is on his way out of his job.
In each of these instances Briggs' Initia
tive denies the teacher's right to free
speech guaranteed by the First Amend
ment to the Constitution. The U.S. Sup
reme Court, in Brandenburg v. Ohio
(1969), ruled that advocacy is forbidden
only when it "is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and is
likely to incite or produce such action."
In neither example could any reasonable

I think the Briggs initiative
also denies the teacher's
right to equal protection
under the law as guaran
teed by the Fourteenth
Amendment.

person think the teacher was inciting the
students to imminent lawless action, and
yet their "advocacy," as Briggs sees it,
should cost them their jobs.
I think the Briggs' Initiative also denies
the teacher's right to equal protection
under the law guaranteed by the Four
teenth Amendment. If, for example, "di
vorce" were substituted for "homosexu
ality" in my last example, the teacher
would not be fired, and yet, ironically,
divorce is surely a greater threat than
homosexuality to "the establishment and
the preservation of the family unit" which
Briggs' Initiative purports to safeguard.
Equally appalling is the precedent
Briggs' Initiative would establish. In the
name of preserving the family by banning
teachers who are supposedly dangerous
role models, what will prevent banning
teachers who are divorced? Or use artifi
cial methods of birth control? Or life out
of wedlock with persons of the opposite

sex? The list is not endless but it could be
extended to an increasingly frightening
length. It is not surprising that the Field
Poll, reported in the Chronicle of Oct. 5,
found lews the strongest opponents of
Proposition 6 (78 percent against) and
blacks the second strongest (64 percent
against). They know what persecution is
and how easily it spreads.
The fear of role models dangerous to
the family is at the heart of Briggs' profes
sed reason for his initiative. From what I
have been able to learn from
psychologists and from the reading they
have recommended, there is still no evi
dence as to the impact, or lack therof,
which an admired teacher, known to be
homosexual, might have on the sexual
orientation of students between the ages
of five and 18. My common-sense guess is
that students would become more toler
ant of homosexuals but would not be in
fluenced in their sexual preference unless
they were already strongly disposed to
ward bisexuality or homosexuality by
other causes.
Briggs himself of course, has not
bothered to offer any evidence at all to
the contrary, and certainly the burden of
proof lies on the initiator. Even if Bell
were wrong and the sexual orientation of
some bisexual students were affected by
homosexual teachers, the frequency of
such a concurrence of factors would
probably be minute. But the damage
done to the civil liberties of teacheis
would be enormous.
The Field Poll also shows "yes" votes
only two percentage points ahead of "no"
votes as of late September — a vast im
provement over the thirty percentage
points of late August. A glance at the poll
will show that Christians can make the
difference. "No" is the only appropriate
vote on Prop. 6 for every member of the
community.
