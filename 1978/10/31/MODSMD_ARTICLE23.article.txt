Political prisoners
Six people are participating
in a hunger strike in the San
Bruno city jail. In spite of the
uproar that followed Andrew
Young's reference to "political
prisoners," they fit the term
under any definition. Arrested
last April in the San Francisco
Consulate of the Philippines
they were convicted in Sep
tember for "trespassing with
intent to disturb lawful activ
ity."
On April 7th, 1978 elections
were held in the Philippines.
They were scheduled by the
Marcos government under
U.S. pressure and were in
tended to show that civil nor
malization was under way in
that country. Strong resistance
to the regime was evident dur
ing the campaign and massive
rallies in Manilla promised a
sizable showing by the opposi
tion party. The results,
though, were quite different.
No opposition candidates
were elected. Marcos' wife,
Imelda, headed the winning
government slate. Accusations
of widespread fraud arose
immediately. Election day in
cidents included: routine
bomb scares and evacuation
of precincts, bribing of
teachers overseeing the elec
tion and bussing of voters.
Protest demonstrations er
rupted in the Philippines. In
the U.S., organizations such as
the "Friends of the Philippino
People" and the "Anti-Martial
Law Coalition" (AMLC) or
ganized a variety of dissent
ing activites. In San Francisco
seven representatives of the
demonstrators, tout of whom
wer U.S. citizens, entered the
Philippine Consulate to pre
sent a letter of protest to the
Marcos government. They
were refused.
At the request of the Cousul
the "AMLC seven" were ar

rested by the police. Initially
they were charged with sev
eral violations but following a
jury trial they were convicted
on only one count of trespas
sing. In a surprisingly unusual
move, the trial judge imposed
the maximum penalty al
lowed: 45 days imprisonment.
Since the defendants were
"first offenders," one may se
elements of vindictiveness.
The trial, conviction and
heavy sentencing set danger
ous precedents. Peacful de
monstrations have always
been a part of the American
political life. It is sufficiently

disturbing that U.S. foreign
policy makers support repres
sive regimes in their countries.
It is alarming when, even un
wittingly, the arm of these
governments is allowed to
suppress opposing political
activity in the U.S. The "AMLC
seven" case is not one of tres
passing in the hallway of a
consulate. It poses the ques
tion of whether the First
Amendment is still upheld in
this country.

Political prisoners
Six people are participating
in a hunger strike in the San
Bruno city jail. In spite of the
uproar that followed Andrew
Young's reference to "political
prisoners," they fit the term
under any definition. Arrested
last April in the San Francisco
Consulate of the Philippines
they were convicted in Sep
tember for "trespassing with
intent to disturb lawful activ
ity."
On April 7th, 1978 elections
were held in the Philippines.
They were scheduled by the
Marcos government under
U.S. pressure and were in
tended to show that civil nor
malization was under way in
that country. Strong resistance
to the regime was evident dur
ing the campaign and massive
rallies in Manilla promised a
sizable showing by the opposi
tion party. The results,
though, were quite different.
No opposition candidates
were elected. Marcos' wife,
Imelda, headed the winning
government slate. Accusations
of widespread fraud arose
immediately. Election day in
cidents included: routine
bomb scares and evacuation
of precincts, bribing of
teachers overseeing the elec
tion and bussing of voters.
Protest demonstrations er
rupted in the Philippines. In
the U.S., organizations such as
the "Friends of the Philippino
People" and the "Anti-Martial
Law Coalition" (AMLC) or
ganized a variety of dissent
ing activites. In San Francisco
seven representatives of the
demonstrators, tout of whom
wer U.S. citizens, entered the
Philippine Consulate to pre
sent a letter of protest to the
Marcos government. They
were refused.
