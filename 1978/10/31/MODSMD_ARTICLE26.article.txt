# American lifestyle puzzles Chinese

Tokyo — Chinese journalists
who toured the United States
found Americans to be
friendly, strangely dressed,
hard-working and scientifically
skilled, but questioned why so
many turn to drugs or religion.
Other things that made an
impression: joggers, dirt in
New York City, tipping, or
derly traffic and "annoying"
television commercials.
"We should study their sci
ence but refuse their
philosophy," Wang |e-shui
concluded in a series of arti
cles in the Comunist Party
newspaper People's Daily
based on a three-week tour he
and fellow journalist Feng
Hsi-liang made of America.
But Wang also said that
while the bourgeois lifestyle is
"eat, drink and be merry" and
while Americans call them
selves a consumer society,
there is no consumption with
out production.
"Without the diligent labor
of a great many workers and
scientists, you can't imagine

America's production rising at
today's levels or how America
could send a man to the
moon," he wrote.
In the offices and factories
he visited, Wang said, "there
was not one idle person, or
any idle chatting." For Ameri
cans, he wrote, "play is play
and work is work
Everywhere they went, he
said, they encountered good
will and friendly smiles —
"People were very willing to
approach us and talk."
Wang also notices numer
ous contrasts in American and
Chinese culture and social sys
tems.
"In the view of many Ameri
cans," Wang said, "China is a
mysterious country. On the
other hand, in the view of
many Chinese, America is a
strange country."
He also cited such superfi
cial differences as clothing —
American clothing that
Chinese find strange and
Chinese clothing that Ameri
cans find too boring.
