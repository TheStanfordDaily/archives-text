## rock/barbie fields A 						nightclub act for 10,000 â€” Joel's a real entertainer 
### 
Billy Joel came rocking into he Arena
at Oakland Coliseum Saturday night and
when he left after his fifth encore, there
was no doubt in anyone's mind that the
man is an entertainer. His stage presence,
like his rock ballads, are filled with per
sonality. Billy Joel knows how to play a
song for all it's worth.
Joel's music, with its truth-is- stranger
than-fiction characters like the "Piano
Man," lulled a West Coast audience into
identifying with this musician from the
streets of New York. And yet, Joel never
let the crowd get sentimental. His version
of "The Ballad of Billy the Kid," while
somewhat toned down on his I'iano Man
LP, was played with vitality and indignation
at the concert.
In between numbers Joel connected
with the audience by using a combination
of personal anecdotes and explanations
about his songs to the background tinkl
ing of his piano keys. Obviously relaxed,
Joel seemed to be playing to 40 people in

an intimate night club rather than ten
thousand at the Coliseum.
The concert covered a lot of ground
with several songs off Joel's latest release
52nd Street being worked in with old
favorites. "Big Shot" in Joel's words 'a
great hangover song' cavorted the
pumped-up entertainer from circling the
stage on top of pianos and amplifiers, to
sprawling at the foot of the stage on his
back.
His new song "Stiletto" was complete
with, as Billy confidentially told the audi
ence, "five finger snappers from the
Bronx imported just for theshow."
"New York State of Mind" off his
Turnstiles' LP, emphasized the quality
musicians backing Joel. Richie Cannata,
another Long Island musician, was par
ticularly impressive on the saxophone as
he quickly carved a niche of his own by
backing Joel flawlessly and stepping in for
solos with ease and feeling.
Doug Stegmeyer on bass, while not hav
ing the opportunity to star, provided a

consistent flow throughout the wide
range of Joel's music.
Liberty DeVitto, the drummer, played
rock and roll with all the stops pulled. It
was DeVitto who seemed to be keeping
everything loose and smooth through the
uncharacteristically high energy sound
that Joel was producing.
Technically, Joel and the band were on
target. The range and variation of their
instrumentation was on key most of the
night, despite what often sounded like
improvisations of the standard music. The
effective use of colored and white lights
in several combinations also enhanced
whatever mood was being created.
Billy Joel flirted with photographers,
shook hands with the crowd, and drank
Heineken between encores. Though he
can justifiably be called a star, Saturday
night's concert displayed just a regular
kind of guy who writes, plays and sings hit
songs about everyday experiences. And
that is what Billy Joel seems content to be.
