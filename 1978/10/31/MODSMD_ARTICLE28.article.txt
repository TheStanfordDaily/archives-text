## 'Sound of Music': same old story 
### 
It's pointless talking about
how dumb and sweet The
Sound of Music is. If you'll
fight it all the way down, don't
bother going.
But, if you'll accept the
show for what it is, forgetting
pretensions to logic and real
ity, you'll find this Civic Light
Opera revival surprisingly
painless.
It's satisfying — not dramat
ically — but like chocolate to a
sweet tooth. You'll hum a lot
and feel disturbingly warm in
side, knowing happy endings
(and the Von Trapps) still exist.
Yes, the family remains a
coed Vienna Boys' Choir.
Maria and the Captain still find

love and adventure during the
Nazi invasion of Austria.
But, director Michael kidd
has made this digestible by
quickening the pace and play
ing everything without embar
rassment or guilt. The Sound
of Music runs so fast you don't
always notice the strained or
syrupy parts. When you do,
the cast hurries along with a
"Well, what did you expect?"
Such impatience would hurt
a stronger show, but here,
speed and straightforwardness
are virtues. The audience
doesn't want new, stimulating
theater. It knows the story and
it knows the songs. (This is the
tirst production in a long time,

which used an ad, proclaiming
"Come hear these hits.")
Kidd plays this familiarity to
his advantage. He doesn't
stray from the 1959 original's
SUBSTANCE. His changes are
all STYLE.
After all, Rodgers and
Hammerstein's show is so
well-built commercially, it al
most runs by itself. The music
peaks at the right time, the
plot thickens and thins, and
the characters are approp
riately: a) good people, b) bad
people, c) children (score 10
points for automatic appeal
see Annie for details).
So Kidd has fattened the
score, adding a song from the

movie version and tailing out
the orchestrations. The de
signing is more clean cut than
the original, especially Robert
Randolph's impressive light
ing, though it all remains Aust
rian storybook. And that sen
timental stuff has been stream
lined, no longer meant to be
swallowed whole, but in bite
size pieces.
All this doesn't help the
fight against movie and TV
monsters, which haunt this
production. Everyone has
seen the film with its luscious
cinematography. Almost
everyone knows Florence
Henderson was Mrs. Brady
and Edward Mulhare was Mrs.

Muir's Ghost. Usually, you let
such bygones be, but here,
you can't help noticing. Hen
derson IS surrounded by
seven rosy-cheeked kids and
Mulhare does play a retired
navy captain, which isn't so
different from being the spirit
of a dead one.
Throughout the show you
hear a tiny voice asking "was
the movie like this?" or
"When is she going to tell
Alice to unpack the station
wagon?"
Briskness
Henderson does her best to
escape the TV image. In her
'50s, she naturally isn't a bright
young Maria. But her energy,
confidence and a full, slightly
brass voice carry the show.
Henderson's opening
number, a stab at playing the
young Maria, is as wobbly as
her footing on the Alpine set.
After that, she finds her mark,
becoming the show's driving
force and punter, her brisk
ness in bailing out faltering
scenes.
She also rescues Mulhare,
whose Captain Von Trapp
never thaws. His last major
musical roles were King Arthur

and Ffenry Higgins. If you
notice the pattern, you'll know
why he doesn't fit here. And
his throaty voice stands out
sorely against a cast which
sings beautifully.
Nuns
Beautifully, like Jean Fenn,
whose Mother Abbess has one
job: deliver with "Climb Every
Mountain."
She does.
Soaring words and music set
you up and Fenn knocks you
out with a voice, so powerful
because it's full of remem
bered pain — it isn't just a
museum-piece soprano.
Fenn also heads an amiable
crew of nuns, whose choral
numbers survive the Or
pheum's erratic sound system.
It's to their credit that these
holy sisters come off as indi
viduals; after all, they do look
alike.
So do the children. Kidd has
them running all over, but
wisely limits the kiddie-corn.
His other supporting charac
ters are handled with less care.
They're cardboard, which is
how they were written.
Susan Burkhimer, though, is
a refershing Liesl, played gir

lish not "ingenue."
Enough of this. The real
question is not how hut why
the Civic Light Opera is doing
the Sound of Music. Besides
the original, the movie and the
record, there have been
countless revivals, including a
CLO show not long ago. Vou
may not complain about too
much of a good thing, but a
show like this. . . .
Producers' explanations
might include nostalgia, and
the sure-bet syndrome. But,
maybe, the best reason came
from two women in the open
ing night audience.
Encased in fur and jewels,
one matron turned to her
companion. "At last, dear, a
REAL musical."
"But, Lois," the other snif
fed. "It's so silly. It's like
watching television."
"Exactly," the first snapped.
"It's such a relief not to have
to think all the time."
As W.C. Fields said, you'll
never go broke underestimat
ing the public.
The Sound of Music runs at the
Orpheum, 1192 Market St., San
Francisco, throunh Dec. 2.

stray from the 1959 original's
SUBSTANCE. His changes are
all STYLE.
After all, Rodgers and
Hammerstein's show is so
well-built commercially, it al
most runs by itself. The music
peaks at the right time, the
plot thickens and thins, and
the characters are approp
riately: a) good people, b) bad
people, c) children (score 10
points for automatic appeal
see Annie for details).
So Kidd has fattened the
score, adding a song from the

movie version and tailing out
the orchestrations. The de
signing is more clean cut than
the original, especially Robert
Randolph's impressive light
ing, though it all remains Aust
rian storybook. And that sen
timental stuff has been stream
lined, no longer meant to be
swallowed whole, but in bite
size pieces.
All this doesn't help the
fight against movie and TV
monsters, which haunt this
production. Everyone has
seen the film with its luscious
cinematography. Almost
everyone knows Florence
Henderson was Mrs. Brady
and Edward Mulhare was Mrs.

Muir's Ghost. Usually, you let
such bygones be, but here,
you can't help noticing. Hen
derson IS surrounded by
seven rosy-cheeked kids and
Mulhare does play a retired
navy captain, which isn't so
different from being the spirit
of a dead one.
Throughout the show you
hear a tiny voice asking "was
the movie like this?" or
"When is she going to tell
Alice to unpack the station
wagon?"
Briskness
Henderson does her best to
escape the TV image. In her
'50s, she naturally isn't a bright
young Maria. But her energy,
confidence and a full, slightly
brass voice carry the show.
Henderson's opening
number, a stab at playing the
young Maria, is as wobbly as
her footing on the Alpine set.
After that, she finds her mark,
becoming the show's driving
force and punter, her brisk
ness in bailing out faltering
scenes.
She also rescues Mulhare,
whose Captain Von Trapp
never thaws. His last major
musical roles were King Arthur

and Ffenry Higgins. If you
notice the pattern, you'll know
why he doesn't fit here. And
his throaty voice stands out
sorely against a cast which
sings beautifully.
Nuns
Beautifully, like Jean Fenn,
whose Mother Abbess has one
job: deliver with "Climb Every
Mountain."
She does.
Soaring words and music set
you up and Fenn knocks you
out with a voice, so powerful
because it's full of remem
bered pain — it isn't just a
museum-piece soprano.
Fenn also heads an amiable
crew of nuns, whose choral
numbers survive the Or
pheum's erratic sound system.
It's to their credit that these
holy sisters come off as indi
viduals; after all, they do look
alike.
So do the children. Kidd has
them running all over, but
wisely limits the kiddie-corn.
His other supporting charac
ters are handled with less care.
They're cardboard, which is
how they were written.
Susan Burkhimer, though, is
a refershing Liesl, played gir

lish not "ingenue."
Enough of this. The real
question is not how hut why
the Civic Light Opera is doing
the Sound of Music. Besides
the original, the movie and the
record, there have been
countless revivals, including a
CLO show not long ago. Vou
may not complain about too
much of a good thing, but a
show like this. . . .
Producers' explanations
might include nostalgia, and
the sure-bet syndrome. But,
maybe, the best reason came
from two women in the open
ing night audience.
Encased in fur and jewels,
one matron turned to her
companion. "At last, dear, a
REAL musical."
"But, Lois," the other snif
fed. "It's so silly. It's like
watching television."
"Exactly," the first snapped.
"It's such a relief not to have
to think all the time."
As W.C. Fields said, you'll
never go broke underestimat
ing the public.

Orpheum, 1192 Market St., San
Francisco, throunh Dec. 2.

It's pointless talking about
how dumb and sweet The
Sound of Music is. If you'll
fight it all the way down, don't
bother going.
But, if you'll accept the
show for what it is, forgetting
pretensions to logic and real
ity, you'll find this Civic Light
Opera revival surprisingly
painless.
It's satisfying — not dramat

side, knowing happy endings
(and the Von Trapps) still exist.

ing everything without embar
rassment or guilt. The Sound
of Music runs so fast you don't
always notice the strained or
syrupy parts. When you do,
the cast hurries along with a
"Well, what did you expect?"
Such impatience would hurt
a stronger show, but here,
speed and straightforwardness

hear a tiny voice asking "was
the movie like this?" or
"When is she going to tell
Alice to unpack the station
wagon?"
Briskness
Henderson does her best to
escape the TV image. In her
'50s, she naturally isn't a bright
young Maria. But her energy,
confidence and a full, slightly
brass voice carry the show.
Henderson's opening
number, a stab at playing the
young Maria, is as wobbly as
her footing on the Alpine set.
After that, she finds her mark,
becoming the show's driving
force and punter, her brisk
ness in bailing out faltering
scenes.
She also rescues Mulhare,
whose Captain Von Trapp
never thaws. His last major
musical roles were King Arthur

and Ffenry Higgins. If you
notice the pattern, you'll know
why he doesn't fit here. And
his throaty voice stands out
sorely against a cast which
sings beautifully.
Nuns
Beautifully, like Jean Fenn,
whose Mother Abbess has one
job: deliver with "Climb Every
Mountain."
She does.
Soaring words and music set
you up and Fenn knocks you
out with a voice, so powerful
because it's full of remem
bered pain — it isn't just a
museum-piece soprano.
Fenn also heads an amiable
crew of nuns, whose choral
numbers survive the Or
pheum's erratic sound system.
It's to their credit that these
holy sisters come off as indi
viduals; after all, they do look
alike.
So do the children. Kidd has
them running all over, but
wisely limits the kiddie-corn.
His other supporting charac
ters are handled with less care.
They're cardboard, which is
how they were written.
Susan Burkhimer, though, is
a refershing Liesl, played gir

lish not "ingenue."
Enough of this. The real
question is not how hut why
the Civic Light Opera is doing
the Sound of Music. Besides
the original, the movie and the
record, there have been
countless revivals, including a
CLO show not long ago. Vou
may not complain about too
much of a good thing, but a
show like this. . . .
Producers' explanations
might include nostalgia, and
the sure-bet syndrome. But,
maybe, the best reason came
from two women in the open
ing night audience.
Encased in fur and jewels,
one matron turned to her
companion. "At last, dear, a
REAL musical."
"But, Lois," the other snif
fed. "It's so silly. It's like
watching television."
"Exactly," the first snapped.
"It's such a relief not to have
to think all the time."
As W.C. Fields said, you'll
never go broke underestimat
ing the public.
The Sound of Music runs at the
Orpheum, 1192 Market St., San
Francisco, throunh Dec. 2.


Florence Henderson (Maria) and children sing "My Favorite Things" in the Civic Light Operation production of The Sound of Music.
It's pointless talking about
how dumb and sweet The
Sound of Music is. If you'll
fight it all the way down, don't
bother going.
But, if you'll accept the
show for what it is, forgetting
pretensions to logic and real
ity, you'll find this Civic Light
Opera revival surprisingly
painless.
It's satisfying — not dramat
ically — but like chocolate to a
sweet tooth. You'll hum a lot
and feel disturbingly warm in
side, knowing happy endings
(and the Von Trapps) still exist.
Yes, the family remains a
coed Vienna Boys' Choir.
Maria and the Captain still find

love and adventure during the
Nazi invasion of Austria.
But, director Michael kidd
has made this digestible by
quickening the pace and play
ing everything without embar
rassment or guilt. The Sound
of Music runs so fast you don't
always notice the strained or
syrupy parts. When you do,
the cast hurries along with a
"Well, what did you expect?"
Such impatience would hurt
a stronger show, but here,
speed and straightforwardness
are virtues. The audience
doesn't want new, stimulating
theater. It knows the story and
it knows the songs. (This is the
tirst production in a long time,

which used an ad, proclaiming
"Come hear these hits.")
Kidd plays this familiarity to
his advantage. He doesn't
stray from the 1959 original's
SUBSTANCE. His changes are
all STYLE.
After all, Rodgers and
Hammerstein's show is so
well-built commercially, it al
most runs by itself. The music
peaks at the right time, the
plot thickens and thins, and
the characters are approp
riately: a) good people, b) bad
people, c) children (score 10
points for automatic appeal
see Annie for details).
So Kidd has fattened the
score, adding a song from the

movie version and tailing out
the orchestrations. The de
signing is more clean cut than
the original, especially Robert
Randolph's impressive light
ing, though it all remains Aust
rian storybook. And that sen
timental stuff has been stream
lined, no longer meant to be
swallowed whole, but in bite
size pieces.
All this doesn't help the
fight against movie and TV
monsters, which haunt this
production. Everyone has
seen the film with its luscious
cinematography. Almost
everyone knows Florence
Henderson was Mrs. Brady
and Edward Mulhare was Mrs.

Muir's Ghost. Usually, you let
such bygones be, but here,
you can't help noticing. Hen
derson IS surrounded by
seven rosy-cheeked kids and
Mulhare does play a retired
navy captain, which isn't so
different from being the spirit
of a dead one.
