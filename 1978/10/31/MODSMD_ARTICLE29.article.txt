## Cunningham confusing, Lively Arts' Posin a delight 
### 
This weekend I saw two dance performances
that I will never forget. One because it was
good; the other because it was so bad.
Friday at the Flint Center, I saw Merce Cun
ningham and Dance Company "move through
time and space." And then Saturday at Memo
rial Auditorium I watched the Lively Arts pre
sentation of the Kathryn Posin Dance Company
give meaning to this phrase.
You see, after traveling to Cupertino I ex
pected the "electric" and "profoundly beauti
ful" performance I had been promised. Instead
I was profoundly bored: the only electricity
involved was the static sounding "musical" ac
companiment of John Cage.
Watching Cunningham's compositions was
like watching a three-ring circus — the move
ments of one dancer were rarely related to
those of the others.
Yet at the end of the evening the audience
applauded long and loud. (Maybe they felt they
had to for $12.50 a seat.) Had I lost my ability to
appreciate modern dance? I frankly felt I'd mis
sed something.
But my fears were allayed Saturday night as I
watched Kathryn Posin prove that modern
dance need not be mechanically meaningless
movements; rather it can be an art form serving
to delight and to instruct.
Both companies featured dancers whose
technique was outstanding. The difference was
in the integrity of Posin's composition: her
choreography unified the lighting, the accom
paniment and the set and costume designs,
with the dancers' skill.
The problem in Cupertino was with the
highly-touted Cunningham philosophy of au
tonomy for the composer, the choreographer
and the designers. The whole idea turned out
much like my mother's "leftover casseroles" —
full of independently admirable work sans con
sistency and flavor. In fact the titles seemed to
be as random and inappropriate as the dance
sequences themselves.

Consider Posin's opening number, Waves, in
which the dangers were waves, soothing, in
triguing and overwhelming me like the ocean.
In the second piece, Clear Signals, the lighting
and costuming were appropriate to the theme
of receiving messages from other worlds.
Possibly the most intriguing piece was the
evening's shortest, Ghost Train. The piece fea
tured David Shimotakahara as a blind man lead
ing a motley group of passengers on a trip to an
invisible destination. I interpreted this to sym
bolize the uncertain common goal of all human
life. However, many other interesting interpre
tations are possible.
The evening ended with Bach Pieces, the
most classical and polished and yet the most
abstract work on the program. While its theme
was not so meaningful as those of the previous
pieces, still it displayed the integrity charac
teristic of all Posin's works.
In contrast, the closing work in Cunnin
gham's performance, Changing Steps Et Cet
era, was an example of his juxtaposition of un
related movements and sounds. I found it dif
ficult to keep my attention on the stage,
perhaps because of the accompaniment, a
conglomeration of ugly noises layered one
upon another until nearly deafening. If there
was a meaning or purpose in all this, I certainly
didn't pick it out. (And neither, I might add, did
any of my friends who attended.) Cunnin
gham's other pieces, Summerspace and Ex
change, were equally confusing.
I would not want to say that Cunningham's
work is without artistic merit. I simply found
Posin's presentation more intellectually re
freshing.
The Posin performance certainly furthered
the reputation for fine dance presentations the
Lively Arts has earned over the past few years.
Posin was the series' first dance production of
the year. Others scheduled include Aman
(American International Folk Ballet) and
Pilobolus later this year.
