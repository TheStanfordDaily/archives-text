# In last week of race
## Brown has 23-pt. lead in poll 
### Associated Press 
Gov. Jerry Brown, describing him
self as the tightest governor ever
elected in California, yesterday
vowed to wade through another -
"painful" two years without a state
tax hike.
Brown, going into the last week of
his re-election campaigning armed
with a Los Angeles Times showing
him 23 points ahead of challenger
Evelle Younger, made that comment
to a )ewish group in San Francisco.
Younger, the Republican attorney
general, meanwhile told a Santa
Clara County gathering of about 400
Republicans that Brown doesn't un
derstand that the surplus really rep
resents overtaxation of the people.
"He still thinks that the surplus
belongs to him. He can't get it
through his head it belongs to you
and should be returned," Younger
said.

Younger was joined by former
Cov. Ronald Reagan in his assault on
the Democratic governor.
Desperate
At a Fresno appearance after his
San Francisco speech, Brown, not
ing the Los Angeles Times poll, ob
served Younger is "a desperate
man. He's behind in all the polls. I
think he's headed for some rather
serious repudiation next Tuesday."
In other campaign developments,
Brown again defended Democratic
Lt. Cov. Mervyn Dymally, saying it
was "reprehensible" for Republican
candidate Mike Curb to say he ex
pected criminal charges would be
brought against Dymally.
"For Mr. Curb to say that, with no
evidence whatsoever and very little
opportunity for the lieutenant gov
ernor to refute that, goes to just
what Mr. Curb is, and I hope the
voters take that into account,"
Brown said.
Curb repeated his claim yesterday
that Lt. Cov. Mervyn Dymally is
guilty of criminal conduct and will
be indicted in a federal probe of
political corruption.
'Unethical'
The Democratic lieutenant gover
nor called his Republican oppo
nent's statement "unethical and de
sperate tactics," denied any
wrong-doing on his part and indi
cated he would sue Curb.
Curb said Sunday that he was
"certain" Dymally. would be in
dicted, although admitted he had no
first-hand information backing up
his prediction.
He repeated his claim yesterday
prior to a fundraising luncheon at
tended by Younger, the GOP candi
date for governor, and former Gov.
Ronald Reagan.
"I believe he will be indicted, and
I think he's guilty of criminal of
fenses while in office," Curb told
reporters.
Key figure
Curb said he based his belief on a
report by KNXT reporter Bill Stout,

who said he had seen federal inves
tigators' reports; on a statement by
Younger that one of the seven
statewide officeholders would be
indicted; and a Los Angeles Times
story that Dymally was a key figure
in a federal probe of political cor
ruption.
He said he had not asked Younger
if Dymally was the person to whom
Younger referred, and did not in
tend to ask Younger. But, he added,
"I don't think there's any question
that Evelle Younger, in my opinion,
is referring to Mervyn Dymally."
Asked after the luncheon if Dym
ally would be indicted, Younger
said, "I have no comment on that. I
referred to statewide officeholders
and Mr. Dymally is one of the
statewide officeholders."
Refused
He refused to say if he thought
Curb's statements were proper, say
ing only that he "would not specu
late" on Dymally's guilt or inno
cence.
But as Dymaly and Curb continue
to zap each other with personal at
tacks in their tight race, both agree
that part of their battle is being
fought in another ring — the guber
natorial one.
Both men agree if Brown wins by a
large margin over Younger — as the
Times polls suggest — Dymally
could be swept back into office on
his coattails.
But Dymally says those polls don't
accurately forecast what will happen
Election Day.
"I don't think those polls are
statistically significant given the
wide lead the governor has over the
atorney general," he explained. "I
think that's going to have some di
rect bearing on the race for lieuten
ant governor."
Curb agrees.
"I have a good chance of win
ning," he said. "If Brown doesn't
win by a big margin, I will have a
great chance of winning. If Evelle
Younger wins, I will definitely win."

elected in California, yesterday
vowed to wade through another -
"painful" two years without a state
tax hike.
Brown, going into the last week of
his re-election campaigning armed
with a Los Angeles Times showing
him 23 points ahead of challenger
Evelle Younger, made that comment
to a )ewish group in San Francisco.
Younger, the Republican attorney
general, meanwhile told a Santa
Clara County gathering of about 400
Republicans that Brown doesn't un
derstand that the surplus really rep
resents overtaxation of the people.
"He still thinks that the surplus
belongs to him. He can't get it
through his head it belongs to you
and should be returned," Younger
said.

Younger was joined by former
Cov. Ronald Reagan in his assault on
the Democratic governor.
Desperate
At a Fresno appearance after his
San Francisco speech, Brown, not
ing the Los Angeles Times poll, ob
served Younger is "a desperate
man. He's behind in all the polls. I
think he's headed for some rather
serious repudiation next Tuesday."
In other campaign developments,
Brown again defended Democratic
Lt. Cov. Mervyn Dymally, saying it
was "reprehensible" for Republican
candidate Mike Curb to say he ex
pected criminal charges would be
brought against Dymally.
"For Mr. Curb to say that, with no
evidence whatsoever and very little
opportunity for the lieutenant gov
ernor to refute that, goes to just
what Mr. Curb is, and I hope the
voters take that into account,"
Brown said.
Curb repeated his claim yesterday
that Lt. Cov. Mervyn Dymally is
guilty of criminal conduct and will
be indicted in a federal probe of
political corruption.
'Unethical'
The Democratic lieutenant gover
nor called his Republican oppo
nent's statement "unethical and de
sperate tactics," denied any
wrong-doing on his part and indi
cated he would sue Curb.
Curb said Sunday that he was
"certain" Dymally. would be in
dicted, although admitted he had no
first-hand information backing up
his prediction.
He repeated his claim yesterday
prior to a fundraising luncheon at
tended by Younger, the GOP candi
date for governor, and former Gov.
Ronald Reagan.
"I believe he will be indicted, and
I think he's guilty of criminal of
fenses while in office," Curb told
reporters.
Key figure
Curb said he based his belief on a
report by KNXT reporter Bill Stout,

who said he had seen federal inves
tigators' reports; on a statement by
Younger that one of the seven
statewide officeholders would be
indicted; and a Los Angeles Times
story that Dymally was a key figure
in a federal probe of political cor
ruption.
He said he had not asked Younger
if Dymally was the person to whom
Younger referred, and did not in
tend to ask Younger. But, he added,
"I don't think there's any question
that Evelle Younger, in my opinion,
is referring to Mervyn Dymally."
Asked after the luncheon if Dym
ally would be indicted, Younger
said, "I have no comment on that. I
referred to statewide officeholders
and Mr. Dymally is one of the
statewide officeholders."
Refused
He refused to say if he thought
Curb's statements were proper, say
ing only that he "would not specu
late" on Dymally's guilt or inno
cence.
But as Dymaly and Curb continue
to zap each other with personal at
tacks in their tight race, both agree
that part of their battle is being
fought in another ring — the guber
natorial one.
Both men agree if Brown wins by a
large margin over Younger — as the
Times polls suggest — Dymally
could be swept back into office on
his coattails.
But Dymally says those polls don't
accurately forecast what will happen
Election Day.
"I don't think those polls are
statistically significant given the
wide lead the governor has over the
atorney general," he explained. "I
think that's going to have some di
rect bearing on the race for lieuten
ant governor."
Curb agrees.
"I have a good chance of win
ning," he said. "If Brown doesn't
win by a big margin, I will have a
great chance of winning. If Evelle
Younger wins, I will definitely win."
