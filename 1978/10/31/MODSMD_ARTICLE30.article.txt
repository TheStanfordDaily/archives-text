## Weak lyrics hurt 'Tormato' 
### 
On their latest outing, Tor
mato, Yes changes musical di
rection. The overall result is a
harder edged, 'rockier' sound
than they have previously
been associated with.
Unfortunately, the new style
doesn't work. It's not the ar
rangements or the musician
ship, both of which are as im
pressive here as ever. Instead,
the problem lies in the weak
ness of the writing.
Yes is not really known for
its writing. Though generally
adequate, and, on occasions,

quite good (and complex), Yes
has not been unknown to turn
out music of a sub-par caliber,
writing-wise (as found in por
tions of Tales From Tele
graphic Oceans, for example).
Progressive music, however,
lends itself well to masking
weaknesses in writing. That is,
progressive music, previously
Yes' mainstay, is often as con
cerned with the means to its
end (instrumentation, ar
rangement) as it is with the
music itself. Thus, writing has
seldom been a problem.

In choosing a more basic
rock approach, however, Yes
has run into a problem. Rock
music, unlike progressive,
won't hide mediocre writing
beneath a shower of dazzling
special effects and synthesiz
ers.
The album's full fledged
rocker, "On the Silent Wings
of Freedom," fails as it aim
lessly rambles on.
"Don't Kill the Whale" and
"Arriving UFO" too have fairly
strong rock undercurrents,
but each works. "Don't Kill the
Whale" works because of its
enjoyable baseline and its de
cipherable lyrics regarding the
preservation of an endangered
species (marking a departure
for Yes from their generally
obtuse style of lyric writing).
"IUFO" also works because of
its interesting, understandable
lyrics (a sort of "Close En
counter of the Yes Kind"). Ad
ditionally, it features some in
teresting synthesizer riffs by
Rick Wakeman.
Wakeman, incidentally,
co-wrote three of the songs on
this album, "Arriving UFO,"
"Future Times" and "Madri
gal," as compared with none
on Yes' last, Going For the
One.
"Madrigal" and "Onward"
are the album's two ballads.
"Madrigal" is well arranged
and played, and worth a listen
for this reason, but is of no
lasting interest. "Onward," on
the other hand, features the
album's most accessible
melody and, additionally, is
advantageously sweetened by
orchestration, Yes' first use of
orchestral accompaniment in
some time. Especially enticing
are the song's instrumental
passages.
It appears, then, that Yes is
in somewhat of a tight posi
tion. They wish to successfully
expand the range of their
music, but are confined by the
level of their writing. On their
next, should they continue
their current approach, a grea
ter effort should be spent on
the creation of strong
melodies. But as this album
proves, if they stick to their
old habits, that is, progressive,
sometimes 'spacey' music,
their next album will probably
be as good as their earlier
material.

level of their writing. On their
next, should they continue
their current approach, a grea
ter effort should be spent on
the creation of strong
melodies. But as this album
proves, if they stick to their
old habits, that is, progressive,
sometimes 'spacey' music,
their next album will probably
be as good as their earlier
material.
On their latest outing, Tor
mato, Yes changes musical di
rection. The overall result is a
harder edged, 'rockier' sound
than they have previously
been associated with.
Unfortunately, the new style
doesn't work. It's not the ar
rangements or the musician
ship, both of which are as im
pressive here as ever. Instead,
the problem lies in the weak
ness of the writing.
Yes is not really known for
its writing. Though generally
adequate, and, on occasions,

quite good (and complex), Yes
has not been unknown to turn
out music of a sub-par caliber,
writing-wise (as found in por
tions of Tales From Tele
graphic Oceans, for example).
Progressive music, however,
lends itself well to masking
weaknesses in writing. That is,
progressive music, previously
Yes' mainstay, is often as con
cerned with the means to its
end (instrumentation, ar
rangement) as it is with the
music itself. Thus, writing has
seldom been a problem.

In choosing a more basic
rock approach, however, Yes
has run into a problem. Rock
music, unlike progressive,
won't hide mediocre writing
beneath a shower of dazzling
special effects and synthesiz
ers.
The album's full fledged
rocker, "On the Silent Wings
of Freedom," fails as it aim
lessly rambles on.
"Don't Kill the Whale" and
"Arriving UFO" too have fairly
strong rock undercurrents,
but each works. "Don't Kill the
Whale" works because of its
enjoyable baseline and its de
cipherable lyrics regarding the
preservation of an endangered
species (marking a departure
for Yes from their generally
obtuse style of lyric writing).
"IUFO" also works because of
its interesting, understandable
lyrics (a sort of "Close En
counter of the Yes Kind"). Ad
ditionally, it features some in
teresting synthesizer riffs by
Rick Wakeman.
Wakeman, incidentally,
co-wrote three of the songs on
this album, "Arriving UFO,"
"Future Times" and "Madri
gal," as compared with none
on Yes' last, Going For the
One.
"Madrigal" and "Onward"
are the album's two ballads.
"Madrigal" is well arranged
and played, and worth a listen
for this reason, but is of no
lasting interest. "Onward," on
the other hand, features the
album's most accessible
melody and, additionally, is
advantageously sweetened by
orchestration, Yes' first use of
orchestral accompaniment in
some time. Especially enticing
are the song's instrumental
passages.
It appears, then, that Yes is
in somewhat of a tight posi
tion. They wish to successfully
expand the range of their
music, but are confined by the
level of their writing. On their
next, should they continue
their current approach, a grea
ter effort should be spent on
the creation of strong
melodies. But as this album

old habits, that is, progressive,
