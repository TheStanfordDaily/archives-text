## Too many plots 
### 
Dusk. The title summons
images of dying twilight, the
transition period during which
night life begins to stir. Where
better to watch this metamor
phosis than New York City's
Greenwich Village, right? Not
this time anyway.
Dusk, a one act play per
formed by the Berkeley Stage
Co., runs less than one hour.
In that short time it raises far
too many subplots and fails to
even resolve the central con
flict.
Francesca and Didi have
been friends for 20 years, and
share an apartment in Green
wich Village. The third player,
Johnny B. — and yes, his last
name should be good — is
friends with them both. Fran
cesca is leaving Didi who has
turned to prostitution to sup
port her drug habit, and to
meet the rent. It Francesca
abandons her, Didi won't be
able to pay the rent, and she
fears being thrown into the
street.
In between
Johnny B. agrees that Fran
cesca must leave, but he wants
her to do it in a "good" way —
which means she shouldn't
make a scene. Both Francesca
and Didi appeal their side to
Johnny B. He refuses to take
any responsibility. Edwin
Shorr plays this role of inbet
ween with a concentration the
other actors often lack.
Didi desperately wants an
affirmation of her value, to be
told what to do to make her
self worth caring about. Fran

cesca continually screeches at
Didi, making the audience
grow somewhat callous. Much
of this screeching is written
into the play, but Winifred
Cabiness overextends at times
when her tone might be more
forceful, less shrill.
Dragging conclusion
Francesca eventually re
lents, promising to take Didi
away with her — but only on
the condition that Didi im
mediately tell her pimp face
to-face that she quits. Fran
cesca is banking on a half
hearted hope that Didi won't
dump her pimp so her escape
from Didi will be legitimized.
She sends Didi off to confront
the pimp and meanwhile starts
making it with Johnny B.
Here is but one of the con
founding forays of subplot.
Either the playwright, Barry
Blisten, didn't know what to
do with Francesca and Johnny
B. while they were left alone in
the apartment, or he thought a
little sex might spice up a
dragging conclusion.
Didi comes back before the
two get anywhere, claiming
she has done what Francesca
required of her. Francesca re
fuses to believe it and sweeps
out the door in what Johnny B.

Dusk. The title summons
images of dying twilight, the
transition period during which
night life begins to stir. Where
better to watch this metamor
phosis than New York City's
Greenwich Village, right? Not
this time anyway.
Dusk, a one act play per
formed by the Berkeley Stage
Co., runs less than one hour.
In that short time it raises far
too many subplots and fails to
even resolve the central con
flict.
Francesca and Didi have
been friends for 20 years, and
share an apartment in Green
wich Village. The third player,
Johnny B. — and yes, his last
name should be good — is
friends with them both. Fran
cesca is leaving Didi who has
turned to prostitution to sup
port her drug habit, and to
meet the rent. It Francesca
abandons her, Didi won't be
able to pay the rent, and she
fears being thrown into the
street.
In between
Johnny B. agrees that Fran
cesca must leave, but he wants
her to do it in a "good" way —
which means she shouldn't
make a scene. Both Francesca
and Didi appeal their side to
Johnny B. He refuses to take
any responsibility. Edwin
Shorr plays this role of inbet
ween with a concentration the
other actors often lack.
Didi desperately wants an
affirmation of her value, to be
told what to do to make her
self worth caring about. Fran

cesca continually screeches at
Didi, making the audience
grow somewhat callous. Much
of this screeching is written
into the play, but Winifred
Cabiness overextends at times
when her tone might be more
forceful, less shrill.
Dragging conclusion
Francesca eventually re
lents, promising to take Didi
away with her — but only on
the condition that Didi im
mediately tell her pimp face
to-face that she quits. Fran
cesca is banking on a half
hearted hope that Didi won't
dump her pimp so her escape
from Didi will be legitimized.
She sends Didi off to confront
the pimp and meanwhile starts
making it with Johnny B.
Here is but one of the con
founding forays of subplot.
Either the playwright, Barry
Blisten, didn't know what to
do with Francesca and Johnny
B. while they were left alone in
the apartment, or he thought a
little sex might spice up a
dragging conclusion.
Didi comes back before the
two get anywhere, claiming
she has done what Francesca
required of her. Francesca re
fuses to believe it and sweeps
out the door in what Johnny B.
