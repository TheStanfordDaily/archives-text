## 'Horseman' rekindles the Western 
### 
Alan J. Pakula's Comes a
Horseman can't put a sudden
end to the long decline of the
American Western like cavalry
coming to the rescue, but
neither will this film hurry
along the genre's demise.
Comes a Horseman succeeds
in rekindling some of the
things that gave the Western
its mythic appeal: the magne
tic allure of the wide-screen
photography, the strong
characterizations and the op
timism.
And for this fflm, set not in
the exuberance of the 1800s
but at the uneasy period at the
end of World War 11, optimism
is a most unexpected virtue.
Director Pakula has made his
career with his dark examina
tions of the powerlessness of
the individual in films like
Klute and The Parallax View.
Even a relatively "up" venture
like All the President's Men left
his characters the nominative
victors but still adrift in a
paranoid world of anonymous
telephone calls and executive
misconduct. Yet Pakula's latest
film leaves its characters not
only alive but happily engaged
in building a new life.
Closeness
Nor is this simply a regres
sive excursion into the "sim
pler" values of a vanished era.
The one representative of the
old ways, a grizzled veteran of
the nineteenth century, dies
halfway through the film and
the younger characters are left
to their own devices. While
the story itself is familiar
Western fare â€” a woman must
fight to keep her land against
the designs of a neighboring
rancher, its closeness to our
time gives it new meaning.
Jane Fonda portrays Ella
Connors, owner of a small
ranch in Montana. It is the in
tegrity of her characterization
which helps give Comes a
Horseman its form. For an ac
tress whose roles have been
placed, for the most part, in
urban settings (ignoring her
romp through the feather
weight late-night television
favorite, Cat Ballou), Fonda

seems surprisingly at ease in
her rustic surroundings.
James Caan and Jason
Robards both do well by their
roles as, respectively, ranch
hand and archetypal heavy.
Less successful is George
Grizzard, who plays a ruthless
oil executive with such slimi
ness that he ends up with a
caricature instead of a charac
terization.
Seductive
Comes a Horseman is a very
seductive film, an effect pro
duced in large part by Gordon
C. Willis' photography and, to
a lesser extent, by Michael
Small's music. Both are in
teresting in that they appear to
be stylizations of an already
stylized genre form rather
than being slavish imitations
(or even the usually worse "af
fectionate" imitation) of it.
Willis' photography, espe
cially, adds new content to
what, in recent Westerns, has
been pretty post card art.
Comes a Horseman, though
by no means a perfect film or
even a great one, is nonethe
less very enjoyable for its in
herent good nature. Pakula,
on holiday from illustrating
the darker side of life, has sent
a valentine to the twentieth
century; it is a pleasure to ac
cept it.
