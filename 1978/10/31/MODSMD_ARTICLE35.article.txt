# Philadelphia zoo gets vampire bats
## 
### 
Philadelphia (AP) — The scene
was Pennsylvania, not Transyl
vania. But there were the vam
pires, rustling their wings in
overhead perches in a moss
filled, damp stone cave. Then
they swooped low, sampling the
blood spread across the cavern
floor.
The creepy rodents, feared in
mythology and repellent in the
flesh, are the new stars at the
Philadelphia Zoo, which opened
a vampire bat exhibit Sunday —
just in time for Halloween.
"Contrary to popular belief,
vampire bats do not suck the
blood of their victims," )eanne L.
Segal, the zoo's public informa
tion director, told spectators in
the mammal house for the open
ing.
"But they do drink it," she ad
ded, later explaining that they
"lap at the blood with their pink
tongues."
"It's not that we've manufac
tured evil, Gothic tales about
them. They do have some nega
tive aspects," she said.
For example, she said, while it
is untrue that the bats fly onto the
necks of intended victims, "they
usually land nearby and then
walk or leap onto some part of
the victim's body.

"They then make a small cut
with their sharp insisor teeth, not
always at the jugular, and often
without distrubing their prey, lap
the blood with their pink ton
gues," Ms. Segal said.
"Most authorities on vampires
agree that their saliva contains
some sort of anti-coagulant that
keeps the wound open while
they feed."
The five new occupants of the
wing will receive a daily diet of
vitamins mixed with about one
ounce each of blood acquired at
a local slaughterhouse, Ms. Segal
said. -
The vitamin-blood bowls are
placed on the cavern floor so the
bats can approach them as they
would a victim.
Vampire bats are grayish
brown creatures no more than
four inches long but with wing
spans of about 13 inches. They
are known to carry rabies and
usually feed on birds and mam
mals such as resting cattle.
Their fearsomeness was
popularized by Bram Stoker in his
1897 horror-thriller "Dracula,"
set in the Romanian region of
Transylvania. The zoo's new in
habitants are of a type native to
Mexico and further south into the
Tropics.
