Israel claims progress in talks
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan claimed "considerable progress" yester
day toward a peace treaty with Egypt.
"As far as we are concerned, I see no reason,
no obstacle for not reaching an agreement,"
Dayan said after a 90-minute session with Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance on a treaty text.
With the negotiations apparently back on
course, Vance scheduled a separate meeting with
the Egyptian delegation headed by Defense
Minister Kamal Hassan Ali. And American and
Israeli legal experts met to discuss treaty lan
guage.
In talking with reporters, Dayan defended Is
rael's decision to "thicken" Jewish settlements on
the West Bank of the Jordan River — a move that
has drawn sharp public criticism from the Carter
administration.
"We don't think the settlements are illegal,''
Dayan said. "We don't think the settlements are
an obstacle to peace.
"And I myself think that whenver we see Jews
settling on the ground without driving away a
single Arab, bringing prosperity to the area, be
coming farmers, producing agricultural products,
I think it is a great blessing."
Dayan said the settlements issue was discussed
with the Egyptians at a two-hour face-to-face
meeting on Sunday. But he said the issue was not
discussed with Vance or other U.S. officials.
Dollar plunges, gold prices soar
London — The once-mighty dollar plummeted
to new lows yesterday in one of its worst days
amid concern for U.S. economic difficulties. Gold
prices soared to new highs as a result.
Foreign exchange dealers would not predict
how far the U.S. currency would plunge and
some said only massive intervention in the form
of an International Monetary Fund loan could re
scue the failing dollar.
Cold bullion prices in Europe rose by as much
as $11 an ounce.
Dollar selling led to more selling, and at each
transaction, the price slipped lower. Few wanted
to buy dollars.
The U.S. currency lost 2 percent of its worth
against the West German mark and French franc,
and 1 percent of 2 percent against most other
major currencies.
The dollar's rapid slide over the past week ap
parently was due to skeptical reaction to Presi
dent Carter's voluntary anti-inflation plan.
Foreigners believe inflation is the central prob
lem weakening American economy.
High court to hear abortion issue
Washington — The Supreme Court said yester
day it will decide whether states may require
unwed females under 18 to get the consent of
parents or a judge before undergoing an abor
tion.
The test case from Massachusetts may provide
a distinction from a 1976 Supreme Court ruling
that banned laws giving parents "absolute" veto
power over young girls' decisions to have abor
tions. 3 i
The Supreme Court in 1973 legalized abortions,
basing its ruling on women's constitutional right

of privacy. They still-controversial decision said
states may not interfere with a woman's choice to
have an abortion during the first three months of
pregnancy.
States may play a role in protecting the wo
man's health in the pregnancy's second trimester
and may take steps to protect fetal life in the final
trimester, the court said
In 1976, the justices struck down a Missouri law
that gave spouses or parents of unwed minors
"absolute" veto power over a female's decision
to have an abortion.
The court's five-member majority also appa
rently did not foreclose the possibility that states
could play some role in cases involving minors.
Russians get 50-year sentence
Newark, N.|. — Two Russians convicted of try
ing to steal U.S. defense secrets were sentenced
to 50 years in prison yesterday. The judge said he
had no doubt the Soviet Union was "fully and
completely behind what occurred here."
U.S. District Judge Frederick Lacey then heard
arguments on whether the pair, former
employees of the United Nations, should remain
free pending appeal of their convictions. They
could have received life sentences.
U.S. Attorney Robert J. Del Tufo, who said he
conferred with U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell,
requested that the defendants be allowed to re
main free "for foreign policy considerations." But
he asked that they be restricted to a portion of the
Bronx, N.V. where the Soviet residential complex
is located.
Lacey said that the defendants, Valdik A. Enger,
39, and Rudolf P. Chernyayev, 43, obviously were
acting on orders from "a very high level" official
when they engaged in the activities for which
they were arrested May 20.
The defendants declined to speak on their own
behalf, telling the judge they concurred with the
arguments of their attorneys that the United
States should not use "vindictiveness and hostil
ity in its sentencing."
Typhoon, floodgates kill 200
Binagbag, Philippines — The death toll from
Typhoon Rita, which cut a swath across the
Philippines' main island of Luzon late last week,
rose to nearly 200 yesterday and many people
were still missing, officials said.
The toll includes 67 persons who died when the
government ordered floodgates of a dam opened
in Bulacan Province without giving enough warn
ing, survivors and local officials charged.
"This is not a calamity, it's criminality. We were
not warned at all," said Salvador Basbas, whose
house, along with 16 others at the edge of this
village in Bulacan Province, was washed away by
waters from Angat Dam.
Basbas complained to Bulacan Gov. Ignacio
Santiago, who heard a report that 67 persons
were killed and 35 were missing as the result of
the opening of the floodgates.
Santiago denied that National Power Corp. per
sonnel had failed to give adequate warning be
fore releasing water from the overflowing dam.
He said, however, the warning system left much
to be desired.
"They issued a warning, but whether the

people got it in time, I don t know, Santiago
said. "They use couriers. They don't have any
quick and direct link to local officials like a tele
phone or radio."
Search for plane crew stopped
Adak, Alaska — Ten survivors of the crash of a
U.S. Navy plane were reported in good condition
yesterday in the Soviet Union as the Coast Guard
abandoned its search for two airmen missing in
the North Pacific.
State Department officials in Washington con
firmed that the survivors arrived in the Soviet port
of Petropavlovsk on Sunday, where they had
been taken by a Russian trawler that rescued
them.
The State Department said the Americans
probably will be flown today to Khabarovsk,
where they will be received by U.S. medical and
consular officials.
Fifty-foot waves and fierce 60-knot winds ham
pered efforts to locate the men, who were aboard
a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft that ditched last Thurs
day midway between Siberia and the Aleutian Is
lands after reporting engine trouble.
California gas prices stay level
San Francisco — Although gasoline prices in
California remained at record highs, October was
the first month this year that statewide averages
did not increase.
The California Automobile Association's most
recent survey released Monday showed prices
actually declined slightly but not enough to sig
nificantly offset the record prices set in Sep
tember.
The AAA-affiliated auto club's October survey
showed regular grade brands sold for 73 cents a
gallon at full service stations, down .1 of a cent
from September, and at 67.7 cents at mini-serve
outlets, down .4 of a cent from last month.
Average price of premium grade was 78.3 cents
per gallon, down .2 of a cent at full service sta
tions and 75.2 cents, up .1 of a cent at open "gas
only" islands.
Southern California prices generally were a
fraction lower than in the San Francisco Bay Area,
while Nevada prices ranged from 1 to 1.5 cents
lower than in California.
Less familiar brands, those not nationally or
regionally advertised, frequently sold at 5 to 10
cents below better known labels.
Stocks rebound, close at 811.85
New York — The stock market bounced back
and forth today as one of the severest drops in
modern Wall Street history appeared to take at
least a short pause.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
by more than 17 points early in the session, re
bounded and finished ahead by 5.80 at 811.85.

California gas prices stay level
San Francisco — Although gasoline prices in
California remained at record highs, October was
the first month this year that statewide averages
did not increase.
The California Automobile Association's most
recent survey released Monday showed prices
actually declined slightly but not enough to sig
nificantly offset the record prices set in Sep
tember.
The AAA-affiliated auto club's October survey
showed regular grade brands sold for 73 cents a
gallon at full service stations, down .1 of a cent
from September, and at 67.7 cents at mini-serve
outlets, down .4 of a cent from last month.
Average price of premium grade was 78.3 cents
per gallon, down .2 of a cent at full service sta
tions and 75.2 cents, up .1 of a cent at open "gas
only" islands.
Southern California prices generally were a
fraction lower than in the San Francisco Bay Area,
while Nevada prices ranged from 1 to 1.5 cents
lower than in California.
Less familiar brands, those not nationally or
regionally advertised, frequently sold at 5 to 10
cents below better known labels.

Israel claims progress in talks
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe

"We don't think the settlements are illegal,''
Dayan said. "We don't think the settlements are
an obstacle to peace.
"And I myself think that whenver we see Jews
settling on the ground without driving away a
single Arab, bringing prosperity to the area, be
coming farmers, producing agricultural products,
I think it is a great blessing."
Dayan said the settlements issue was discussed
with the Egyptians at a two-hour face-to-face
meeting on Sunday. But he said the issue was not
discussed with Vance or other U.S. officials.
Dollar plunges, gold prices soar
London — The once-mighty dollar plummeted
to new lows yesterday in one of its worst days

Foreign exchange dealers would not predict

Cold bullion prices in Europe rose by as much

Dollar selling led to more selling, and at each

Russians get 50-year sentence
Newark, N.|. — Two Russians convicted of try

to 50 years in prison yesterday. The judge said he
had no doubt the Soviet Union was "fully and

U.S. District Judge Frederick Lacey then heard

free pending appeal of their convictions. They
could have received life sentences.
U.S. Attorney Robert J. Del Tufo, who said he
conferred with U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell,
requested that the defendants be allowed to re
main free "for foreign policy considerations." But
he asked that they be restricted to a portion of the
Bronx, N.V. where the Soviet residential complex
is located.
Lacey said that the defendants, Valdik A. Enger,
39, and Rudolf P. Chernyayev, 43, obviously were
acting on orders from "a very high level" official

they were arrested May 20.
The defendants declined to speak on their own

Typhoon, floodgates kill 200
Binagbag, Philippines — The death toll from
Typhoon Rita, which cut a swath across the
Philippines' main island of Luzon late last week,
rose to nearly 200 yesterday and many people
were still missing, officials said.
The toll includes 67 persons who died when the
government ordered floodgates of a dam opened
in Bulacan Province without giving enough warn
ing, survivors and local officials charged.
"This is not a calamity, it's criminality. We were
not warned at all," said Salvador Basbas, whose
house, along with 16 others at the edge of this
village in Bulacan Province, was washed away by
waters from Angat Dam.
Basbas complained to Bulacan Gov. Ignacio
Santiago, who heard a report that 67 persons
were killed and 35 were missing as the result of
the opening of the floodgates.
Santiago denied that National Power Corp. per
sonnel had failed to give adequate warning be
fore releasing water from the overflowing dam.
He said, however, the warning system left much
to be desired.
"They issued a warning, but whether the

people got it in time, I don t know, Santiago
said. "They use couriers. They don't have any
quick and direct link to local officials like a tele
phone or radio."

Typhoon, floodgates kill 200
Binagbag, Philippines — The death toll from
Typhoon Rita, which cut a swath across the
Philippines' main island of Luzon late last week,
rose to nearly 200 yesterday and many people
were still missing, officials said.
The toll includes 67 persons who died when the
government ordered floodgates of a dam opened
in Bulacan Province without giving enough warn
ing, survivors and local officials charged.
"This is not a calamity, it's criminality. We were
not warned at all," said Salvador Basbas, whose
house, along with 16 others at the edge of this
village in Bulacan Province, was washed away by
waters from Angat Dam.
Basbas complained to Bulacan Gov. Ignacio
Santiago, who heard a report that 67 persons
were killed and 35 were missing as the result of

Search for plane crew stopped
Adak, Alaska — Ten survivors of the crash of a
U.S. Navy plane were reported in good condition
yesterday in the Soviet Union as the Coast Guard

the North Pacific.
State Department officials in Washington con
firmed that the survivors arrived in the Soviet port
of Petropavlovsk on Sunday, where they had
been taken by a Russian trawler that rescued
them.
The State Department said the Americans
probably will be flown today to Khabarovsk,
where they will be received by U.S. medical and
consular officials.
Fifty-foot waves and fierce 60-knot winds ham

California gas prices stay level
San Francisco — Although gasoline prices in
California remained at record highs, October was
the first month this year that statewide averages
did not increase.
The California Automobile Association's most
recent survey released Monday showed prices
actually declined slightly but not enough to sig
nificantly offset the record prices set in Sep
tember.
The AAA-affiliated auto club's October survey
showed regular grade brands sold for 73 cents a
gallon at full service stations, down .1 of a cent
from September, and at 67.7 cents at mini-serve
outlets, down .4 of a cent from last month.
Average price of premium grade was 78.3 cents
per gallon, down .2 of a cent at full service sta
tions and 75.2 cents, up .1 of a cent at open "gas
only" islands.
Southern California prices generally were a
fraction lower than in the San Francisco Bay Area,
while Nevada prices ranged from 1 to 1.5 cents

Less familiar brands, those not nationally or
regionally advertised, frequently sold at 5 to 10

"We don't think the settlements are illegal,''
Dayan said. "We don't think the settlements are

"And I myself think that whenver we see Jews

Dollar plunges, gold prices soar
London — The once-mighty dollar plummeted
to new lows yesterday in one of its worst days
amid concern for U.S. economic difficulties. Gold
prices soared to new highs as a result.
Foreign exchange dealers would not predict
how far the U.S. currency would plunge and
some said only massive intervention in the form
of an International Monetary Fund loan could re
scue the failing dollar.
Cold bullion prices in Europe rose by as much
as $11 an ounce.
Dollar selling led to more selling, and at each
transaction, the price slipped lower. Few wanted

The U.S. currency lost 2 percent of its worth
against the West German mark and French franc,
and 1 percent of 2 percent against most other
major currencies.
The dollar's rapid slide over the past week ap
parently was due to skeptical reaction to Presi

High court to hear abortion issue
Washington — The Supreme Court said yester
day it will decide whether states may require
unwed females under 18 to get the consent of
parents or a judge before undergoing an abor

The test case from Massachusetts may provide
a distinction from a 1976 Supreme Court ruling
that banned laws giving parents "absolute" veto
power over young girls' decisions to have abor
tions. 3 i
The Supreme Court in 1973 legalized abortions,
basing its ruling on women's constitutional right

of privacy. They still-controversial decision said
states may not interfere with a woman's choice to
have an abortion during the first three months of
pregnancy.
States may play a role in protecting the wo
man's health in the pregnancy's second trimester
and may take steps to protect fetal life in the final
trimester, the court said
In 1976, the justices struck down a Missouri law
that gave spouses or parents of unwed minors
"absolute" veto power over a female's decision

The court's five-member majority also appa

could play some role in cases involving minors.
Russians get 50-year sentence
Newark, N.|. — Two Russians convicted of try

to 50 years in prison yesterday. The judge said he

U.S. District Judge Frederick Lacey then heard
arguments on whether the pair, former
employees of the United Nations, should remain
free pending appeal of their convictions. They
could have received life sentences.
U.S. Attorney Robert J. Del Tufo, who said he
conferred with U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell,
requested that the defendants be allowed to re

The U.S. currency lost 2 percent of its worth
against the West German mark and French franc,
and 1 percent of 2 percent against most other
major currencies.
The dollar's rapid slide over the past week ap
parently was due to skeptical reaction to Presi
dent Carter's voluntary anti-inflation plan.
Foreigners believe inflation is the central prob
lem weakening American economy.
High court to hear abortion issue
Washington — The Supreme Court said yester
day it will decide whether states may require
unwed females under 18 to get the consent of
parents or a judge before undergoing an abor
tion.
The test case from Massachusetts may provide
a distinction from a 1976 Supreme Court ruling
that banned laws giving parents "absolute" veto
power over young girls' decisions to have abor
tions. 3 i
The Supreme Court in 1973 legalized abortions,
basing its ruling on women's constitutional right

of privacy. They still-controversial decision said
states may not interfere with a woman's choice to
have an abortion during the first three months of
pregnancy.
States may play a role in protecting the wo
man's health in the pregnancy's second trimester
and may take steps to protect fetal life in the final
trimester, the court said
In 1976, the justices struck down a Missouri law
that gave spouses or parents of unwed minors
"absolute" veto power over a female's decision
to have an abortion.
The court's five-member majority also appa
rently did not foreclose the possibility that states
could play some role in cases involving minors.
Russians get 50-year sentence
Newark, N.|. — Two Russians convicted of try
ing to steal U.S. defense secrets were sentenced
to 50 years in prison yesterday. The judge said he
had no doubt the Soviet Union was "fully and
completely behind what occurred here."
U.S. District Judge Frederick Lacey then heard
arguments on whether the pair, former
employees of the United Nations, should remain
free pending appeal of their convictions. They
could have received life sentences.
U.S. Attorney Robert J. Del Tufo, who said he
conferred with U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell,
requested that the defendants be allowed to re
main free "for foreign policy considerations." But
he asked that they be restricted to a portion of the
Bronx, N.V. where the Soviet residential complex
is located.
Lacey said that the defendants, Valdik A. Enger,
39, and Rudolf P. Chernyayev, 43, obviously were
acting on orders from "a very high level" official
when they engaged in the activities for which
they were arrested May 20.
The defendants declined to speak on their own
behalf, telling the judge they concurred with the
arguments of their attorneys that the United
States should not use "vindictiveness and hostil
ity in its sentencing."
Typhoon, floodgates kill 200
Binagbag, Philippines — The death toll from
Typhoon Rita, which cut a swath across the
Philippines' main island of Luzon late last week,
rose to nearly 200 yesterday and many people
were still missing, officials said.
The toll includes 67 persons who died when the
government ordered floodgates of a dam opened
in Bulacan Province without giving enough warn
ing, survivors and local officials charged.
"This is not a calamity, it's criminality. We were
not warned at all," said Salvador Basbas, whose
house, along with 16 others at the edge of this
village in Bulacan Province, was washed away by
waters from Angat Dam.
Basbas complained to Bulacan Gov. Ignacio
Santiago, who heard a report that 67 persons
were killed and 35 were missing as the result of
the opening of the floodgates.
Santiago denied that National Power Corp. per
sonnel had failed to give adequate warning be
fore releasing water from the overflowing dam.
He said, however, the warning system left much
to be desired.
"They issued a warning, but whether the

people got it in time, I don t know, Santiago
said. "They use couriers. They don't have any
quick and direct link to local officials like a tele
phone or radio."
Search for plane crew stopped
Adak, Alaska — Ten survivors of the crash of a
U.S. Navy plane were reported in good condition
yesterday in the Soviet Union as the Coast Guard
abandoned its search for two airmen missing in
the North Pacific.
State Department officials in Washington con
firmed that the survivors arrived in the Soviet port
of Petropavlovsk on Sunday, where they had
been taken by a Russian trawler that rescued
them.
The State Department said the Americans
probably will be flown today to Khabarovsk,
where they will be received by U.S. medical and
consular officials.
Fifty-foot waves and fierce 60-knot winds ham
pered efforts to locate the men, who were aboard
a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft that ditched last Thurs
day midway between Siberia and the Aleutian Is
lands after reporting engine trouble.
California gas prices stay level
San Francisco — Although gasoline prices in
California remained at record highs, October was
the first month this year that statewide averages
did not increase.
The California Automobile Association's most
recent survey released Monday showed prices
actually declined slightly but not enough to sig
nificantly offset the record prices set in Sep
tember.
The AAA-affiliated auto club's October survey
showed regular grade brands sold for 73 cents a
gallon at full service stations, down .1 of a cent
from September, and at 67.7 cents at mini-serve
outlets, down .4 of a cent from last month.
Average price of premium grade was 78.3 cents
per gallon, down .2 of a cent at full service sta
tions and 75.2 cents, up .1 of a cent at open "gas
only" islands.
Southern California prices generally were a
fraction lower than in the San Francisco Bay Area,
while Nevada prices ranged from 1 to 1.5 cents
lower than in California.
Less familiar brands, those not nationally or
regionally advertised, frequently sold at 5 to 10
cents below better known labels.
Stocks rebound, close at 811.85
New York — The stock market bounced back
and forth today as one of the severest drops in
modern Wall Street history appeared to take at
least a short pause.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
by more than 17 points early in the session, re
bounded and finished ahead by 5.80 at 811.85.

Israel claims progress in talks
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan claimed "considerable progress" yester
day toward a peace treaty with Egypt.
"As far as we are concerned, I see no reason,
no obstacle for not reaching an agreement,"
Dayan said after a 90-minute session with Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance on a treaty text.
With the negotiations apparently back on
course, Vance scheduled a separate meeting with
the Egyptian delegation headed by Defense
Minister Kamal Hassan Ali. And American and
Israeli legal experts met to discuss treaty lan
guage.
In talking with reporters, Dayan defended Is
rael's decision to "thicken" Jewish settlements on
the West Bank of the Jordan River — a move that
has drawn sharp public criticism from the Carter
administration.
"We don't think the settlements are illegal,''
Dayan said. "We don't think the settlements are
an obstacle to peace.
"And I myself think that whenver we see Jews
settling on the ground without driving away a
single Arab, bringing prosperity to the area, be
coming farmers, producing agricultural products,
I think it is a great blessing."
Dayan said the settlements issue was discussed
with the Egyptians at a two-hour face-to-face
meeting on Sunday. But he said the issue was not
discussed with Vance or other U.S. officials.
Dollar plunges, gold prices soar
London — The once-mighty dollar plummeted
to new lows yesterday in one of its worst days
amid concern for U.S. economic difficulties. Gold
prices soared to new highs as a result.
Foreign exchange dealers would not predict
how far the U.S. currency would plunge and
some said only massive intervention in the form
of an International Monetary Fund loan could re
scue the failing dollar.
Cold bullion prices in Europe rose by as much
as $11 an ounce.
Dollar selling led to more selling, and at each
transaction, the price slipped lower. Few wanted
to buy dollars.
The U.S. currency lost 2 percent of its worth
against the West German mark and French franc,
and 1 percent of 2 percent against most other
major currencies.
