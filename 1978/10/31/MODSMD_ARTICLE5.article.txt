# Housing situation tight in area around campus

### LEX PASSARIS 
Each September the influx of re
turning Stanford students helps
cause a glut on the rental housing
market in the areas surrounding the
campus.
In 1977, Stanford housed 57 per
cent of the home-campus popula
tion. "That left 43 percent thaf went
elsewhere," said Philip Curry, ad
ministrative assistant of the Office of
Residential Education here. The 43
percent figure represents about 5000
students.

News Analysis

A survey of off-campus students in
1975 conducted through the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs de
termined that half of the sample
population lived within three miles
of the Quad, and 55 percent lived in
Palo Alto.
According to the Palo Alto Com
prehensive Plan, compiled by the ci
ty's Planning Department, nearly
half of the city's 23,800 housing units
are occupied by persons other than
the owner. However, few of these
rental units are in the low to moder
ate price range that students prefer.
Many students find housing
through rental of an extra room in a
private home. The city zoning ordi
nance for single family residences
allows up to five unrelated people to
live in the same dwelling, according

to Richard Cabrera, Palo Alto ordi
nance compliance insepctor.
Students who are seeking their
own accommodations in the low to
moderate income housing range
must compete with Palo Alto's poor
and elderly residents.
Senior citizen competition
With the vacancy rate in Palo Alto
at less than 1 percent and a turnover
rate of 35 percent, speed is a key
factor in locating available units.
Since students can generally move
more quickly than elderly people,

the elderly are at a particular disad
vantage, according to a report on
housing for senior citizens released
by the city of Palo Alto.
A study of University/Palo Alto re
lations conducted in 1974 by Sylvia
Seman, now of the Palo Alto Hous
ing Corporation, acknowledged the
problem of housing competition be
tween the elderly and the students.
The study said, "Seventy-five pecent
of the questionnaire respondents
did feel that Stanford should pro
vide additional student housing and

â€¢housing for persons with low and
moderate incomes."
Curry said that the University is
looking into the problem of addi
tional student housing. He noted
that this year there were more stu
dents on the waiting list for on
campus housing than there were last
year. But he said they also may have
been fewer units available.
"It certainly appears that this Au
gust and September we received
fewer listings (for off-campus hous
ing) than last August and Sep

tember," Curry said.
June Becker, residential education
supervisor here, said that a number
of staff members and professionals
are advertising in the student listings
to share housing units in order to
alleviate the increase in housing
costs.
Andrew Doty, Stanford's director
of community relations, points out
that the rise of housing problems
has also caused problems among
the faculty and staff as well, particu
larly in the area of recruitment.
