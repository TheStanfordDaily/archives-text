# Med Center to get cancer grant money

### CAYLE ASHTON 
The Stanford Medical Center will study the ef
fects of the protein interferon on cancer as part of
a $2 million research effort funded by the Ameri
can Cancer Society (ACS).
The Med Center will test the effects of interfe
ron on non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a tumor of the
lymphatic system. Four other research institu
tions also involved in the project will test other
forms of cancer.
Interferon is a protein produced by the human
body and was first identified in 1957. It has been
thought to respond primarily to viral infections of
the body. However, recent clinical results such as
tumor inhibition in animals have encouraged the
investigation of additional applications.
According to Dr. Thomas Merigan, head of the
Division of Infectious Diseases at the Med
Center, it is thought that interferon may have an

anti-tumor effect either by limiting cell growth or
by augmenting the natural defenses of the im
mune system.
Merigan said that because interferon is pro
duced naturally, large quantities of the substance
are less likely to be toxic than some artificial sub
stances currently used. He added that it is
thought that the disease being treated will be less
likely to be resistant to interferon.
Toxicity is still a problem, however, he said.
Also, interferon may not act specifically on the
tumor, but instead may affect other rapidly divid
ing cells such as bone marrow and lymphoid
cells.
The extraction of interferon, which is obtained
from human white blood cells, is expensive and
only 25 patients will be tested in each of the types
of cancer. Finland is the source of the interferon
being used in these experiments due to the ex

tensive blood donor system of the Finnish Red
Cross. Only recently have there been sufficient
quantities of interferon to undertake a sizeable
project.
For the same reason, the tests will not be con
ducted with pure interferon, Merigan said. Total
purification involves a great loss of interferon and
the available amount is already limited.
Although interferon synthesis has not yet been
achieved, Merigan said, it would be desirable.
The ACS cautions other cancer patients at the
same time that it encourages the scientific world
concerning interferon. Dr. Frank Hauscher, )r. (
ACS senior vice president for research said,
"Speculation which raises high hopes because of
the Society's unusually large financial commit
ment is premature. Interferon needs to be
checked out because its value has not yet been
proven."
