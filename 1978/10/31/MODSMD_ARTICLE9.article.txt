# Exclusive Washington club admits male members only
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Cosmos Club, whose
members have received more than 50 Nobel
and Pulitzer prizes, still admits only men and
accepts only half-heartedly such modern con
traptions as radio and television.
Nevertheless, as the exclusive men's club
creaks towards its 100 th birthday on Nov. 16, it
prides itself on being an important center of
American intellectual life.
It was in 1948, 50 years after the radio was
invented, that the first one finally was approved
for purchase by the membership.
Such mechanical marvels were simply "the
enemy of good conversation," one member
declared.
And in 1951, when a television set was
suggested, a prominent lawyer-member com
plained.
"We haven't even accepted radio yet," he
said.
The club decided it could not decline a do
nated set, but it has been ignominously stashed
away in an upstairs corner room ever since.
The Cosmos Club was founded in 1878 by a
scientists, explorer and humanist, John Wesley

Powell, with the guiding spirit that "no
philosophy is so serene and so comforting as
that which unites the love of study and of
books with the fellowship of men."
Men. Only men. Accepting female members
was soundly defeated in 1973 and 1975, and the
Cosmos Club makes no apologies.
"It would just be an entirely different club if
women were admitted," said its 97th president,
74-year-old Lloyd Wesley Swift. "With an all
men's club we have the associations, the ex
changes and the values we like."
Its 3000 members, representing the nation's
elite in science, literature and the arts, qualified
by being "distinguished," "cultivated" and by
having produced a "meritorious original
work."
The wood-panelled library where members
must abide by a "Reclining at Length" rule insti
tuted in 1891 that prohibits "undignified loung
ing" is filled with books by members.
The typical member is old enough to be a
grandfather several times. There are more than
350 octogenarian members, but less than 50
under the age of 40.
