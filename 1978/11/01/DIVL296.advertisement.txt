Ask Victoria Vespa
Two-Wheel Etiquette
Dear Vittoria, \
My girlfriend got into medita
tion. Now she says my _V t \ /
motorcycle startles her it I drive -jfihv *
up when she's in a trance. She
even makes fun of my tattoos. I -
like my macho image. Who is right? "
Max. U. of Cincinnati dropout
To tone down the image and noise level, yet
keep that feeling of power, trade for a Vespa Scooter. But what
do you want out of life? A good hot bath is a great place to think about it.
Vittoria
Dear Vittoria.
I got a Vespa Scooter and I really dig it. I think Vespas are the
answer to all the world's problems, except this one I miss my 62 Nash
(the seats fold down completely) because I can slip my arm around a
girl's shoulder in a car, but not on a scooter. Is there a solution?
Gary from Wayne University
Dear Gary,
Call me up sometime But first, go down to your Vespa dealer and take
a look at the nifty baskets he stocks. They're just right for books, a
picnic lunch and a blanket Get the idea?
XXXXX, Vittoria
