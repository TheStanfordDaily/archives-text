# Women candidates could make large political gains
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Helen
Reddy, an appointed state offi
cial as well as world-famous
singer, gazed over the lunc
heon tables spread on her back
yard, filled mostly with women
running for public office or fil
ling government posts.
"I'd like to say how person
ally gratifying it is to me to see
women here in numbers too
big to ignore," she said.
Some hours later, a singer
famous only among feminists,
Margie Adam, sang at a benefit
for 16 women candidates
backed by the Los Angeles
chapter of the National Wo
men's Political Caucus.
One of the candidates,
Gwen Moore, a black woman
running for a Los Angeles As
sembly seat, told the apprecia
tive audience, "We can't be as
bad as the men."
This is a year when women
candidates are being neither
ignored nor patient — they
stand to make their largest
gains to date in California gov
ernment, from statewide office
to local races.
Many of those women, some
of them the strongest candi
dates, are also members of
minority races.
Minorities, ironically, could
wind up with people in five
statewide offices, but are likely
to make few numerical gains in
the state's congressional dele
gation or in the Legislature.
The women and minority
candidates for offices ranging
from the Supreme Court and
governor down to the Assem
bly are in both major parties, as
well as minor parties.
In the statewide races, two of
the four Supreme Court jus
tices seeking confirmation are
Chief justice Rose Bird and jus
tice Wiley Manuel. Both ap
pointed by Gov. Edmund
Brown, jr., Bird was the first

woman and Manuel the first
black ever named to the state's
high court.
Brown, who has named
hundreds of women and
minority people to courts and
state posts, has said he consid
ers opening up government to
women and minorities — "the
breakdown of stereotypes" —
the one thing in his term that
will last forever.
But the governor's race itself
is largely for white males:
Brown and COP challenger
Evelle Younger. However, two
of the three minority party
candidates on the ballot are
women: Theresa Dietrich of
the American Independent
Party and Marilyn Seals of the
Peace & Freedom Party.
Re-election battle
In the next job, incumbent
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally was
the first black lieutenant gov

ernor in California, but he
faces a tough re-election battle
from Republican record mag
nate Mike Curb.
Secretary of State March
Fong Eu should have little
trouble capturing a second
term. Black Republican Donald
French is only a longshot
against incumbent Treasurer.
In the attorney general's
race, Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke, who was the first black
woman elected to Congress
from California, is running a
close race against state Sen.
George Deukmejian, R-Long
Beach. If elected, she would be
the nation's first woman
elected attorney general.
Wilson Riles, who was the
first black elected to statewide
office in California, was chosen
for his third nonpartisan term
in )une as state schools
superintendent.
