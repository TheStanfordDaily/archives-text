## Editorial What about a mascot? 
### 
Once again, the mascot issue has
hit the University. An organization
of athletes and their backers are
now proposing the Griffins, a mythi
cal character with lion and bird-like
characteristics.
Ever since the Indians was
abolished in 1973 and the Cardinals
resurrected, the issue has been a
simmering one. Conservative
alumni continue to support the In
dian, while students here in 1975
voted on such names as Robber Ba
rons, Sequoias and Railroaders.
A suitable nickname replacement
for the Indians was never found,
though, probably due to the ex
treme diversity of names offered.
Now, with the Friends of the Stan
ford Griffin proposing a viable mas
cot alternative, it is time for the Uni
versity administration to take the in
itiative to design a framework for
selecting a new mascot.
Without such a framework, divi
siveness that has resulted from the
dropping of the Indian as mascot
will surely be prolonged.

However, if there are other
suggested names in the works,
those sponsoring them should get
well organized. Every group of fans
as well as team members should be
given a voice in the selection pro
cess.
But any reconsideration of the In
dians as mascot should be put to
rest immediately. President Richard
Lyman has stated his unequivocal
opposition to the Indians; and the
opposition of most native Americans
to such a nickname warrants its re
jection.
Any mascot that fails to reach a
substantial consensus, including the
Griffin, should not be chosen at all.
To require only simple majority ap
proval will likely leave half the fans
displeased and lead to continued
divisiveness.
It is not a life and death matter to
be left in the present ambiguous
mascot situation. If a consensus can
not be reached, which would be un
fortunate, freedom of choice will be
left to reign a while longer.
