Hoover budget
Now that the Hoover Institu
tion has received $7 million
extra and thereby tripled its
endowment (Daily, Oct. 18). I
have a query of the administra
tion: Is the University still sup
plying 30 percent of Hoover's
operating budget?
I know for sure that next
year, when our contract
negotiations will come up, we
shall be told that the University
cannot afford a decent wage
for workers. All over the Uni
versity employees are denied
adequate pay or pay raises they
deserve; worthwhile projects
die on the vine "for lack of
funds;" students have to
scramble for financial support
and go deep into debt to pur
sue their studies.
In light of the $7 million en
dowment, these are the areas
into which the hundreds of
thousands normally given to
Hoover should go — instead of
feeding a far-right think-tank
already bulging at the seams
with money destined in a dead
man's will for the "sick, aged,
helpless and distressed."
I think the University com
munity deserves an answer to
this question.

Speed limit
has merit
There we were, speeding to
our hearts' content in power
ful, gas-guzzling machines —
when suddenly came the era of
fuel rationing, rising prices at
the pumps, odd-even gas
purchase restrictions and end
less early-morning lines of de
sperate motorists. Ever since,
Americans have accepted the
reality of the energy crisis and
obeyed thess-mph speed limit
with little objection. In a recent
Newsweek editorial, Charles
A. Lave, a UC-lrvine
economist, harshly criticized
the law for not being worth the
extra driving time it causes.
In fact, the 55-mph speed
limit has had two very benefi
cial effects. Government esti
mates state that it saves 1 to 2
percent of our annual gasoline
consumption. In addition, the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration indicates that
about 4500 lives are saved per
year because of the law.
Lave, through some fancy
calculations, states that it costs
about 102 man-years of extra
travel time to save one life
under the 55-mile restriction
Emphasizing that "time is
money," he maintains that the
law causes enough of a traffic
slowdown to waste about $6
billion worth of travel time per
year. In his opinion, the net re
sult is $1.3 million spent per life
saved, and he concludes that
there are much cheaper ways
of saving lives.
The absurdity of this argu
ment lies foremost in his at
tempt to place a price on
human life. Any entity which
saves lives (and fuel to boot, in
this instance), regardless of
how many orfew, is justifiable.
Furthermore, I wish to chal
lenge Lave by asking how
changing speed limit signs
from 55 to 65-plus is going to
help rush hour commuters
"save time." These hardy souls

brave crowded concrete park
ing lots twice daily as the crawl
back and forth to work, en
gines turning the sun's hard
work into smoke. It is here that
most of America's petroleum
energy is wasted, not on long
cross-country trips, which
have largely been replaced by
airplane travel. Considering
the latter, even if the speed
limit were raised from 55 to 65
on the open road, one would
have to drive for five and a half
days in order to save 24 hours
of travel time.
Lave rightly points out that
the average car in the U.S. now
gets about 15 miles per gallon,
and that we could save more
energy if more Americans
drove fuel-efficient cars. He
indicates that there are two
basic ways to get people to
drive smaller cars: pass a law
requiring it or increasing the
incentives for it. His solution is
a 55-mph limit forgas-guzzlers,
a 65-mph limit for economy
cars, and separate license
plates for the convenience of
police in distinguishing the
two. The differential speed is
to be allowed only on uncon
gested highways.
I do not wish to delve at
length into the extreme confu
sion and cost which would re
sult from such a plan. Instead,
we should completely ban the
sale of new automobiles whose
fuel consumption is clearly in
consistent with the reality of
energy shortage. A little
foresight and action along
these lines 15 years ago might
have obviated the need for
high gas prices as an incentive
for conservation. At present,
the economy motorist is forced
to help pay for the gas
guzzler's affluence at the
pumps. Perhaps a more
reasonable solution would in
volve a price rather than speed
differential in favor of the small
car owner.
In the meantime, the 55-mph
speed limit should be recog
nized as an asset, albeit small,
to our national effort to con
serve energy.

Hooker's Ball
experience
A "fraternity party-like at
mosphere" would not be quite
the words I would use to de
scribe the Hooker's Ball. I've
never seen a fraternity party
where the majority of people
were dressed up as K-2 jelly,
male sex organs, or contracep
tives. The ball remined me of a
few scenes from Fellini's
Satyricon intermingled with
slices of Central Park at night.
People who hear my descrip
tion of my experiences at the
ball usually say "Well, what did
you expect, for Cod's sake?
Look who sponsored it!" And,
of course, they are right. A ball
sponsored by hookers is
bound to have a few hookers
knocking about. And they can't
very well come without bring
ing along their pimps. And
then, of course, the
exhibitionists, perverts and
degenerates want to get in on
the scene. (I think they were
the polyester-suited
businessmen the Daily repor
ter must have been referring to
. . . I just didn't recognize

them with their clothes off.)
The first group I ran into on
the way to the Cow Palace con
sisted of a "woman" (and I use
the term loosely) attired in a
black leotard, with matching
leather high-heeled boots and
black seamed stockings. She
had fake blond curls cascading
down her back and a whip in
one hand, which she cracked
here and there as she swayed
forward. In her other hand she
gripped chains connected to
studded dog collars around the
necks of two meek little men in
black silk who trailed along
behind her.
In the outer hall of the Cow
Palace, a display of pornog
raphic 3-dimensional art
writhed and undulated furi
ously.
The "ball room" was packed.
People were dancing, drink
ing, smoking, and snorting.
Others were groping, pinch
ing, and molesting. I noticed a
little old lady sitting in the seat
section who looked like some
body's grandmother. She had
her hands folded in her lap and
was watching everything with a
placid little smile on her face.
My fellow University student
at the ball decided he was
going to try to meet a girl. (He
has a lousy sense of timing.) He
sparked up a conversation with
a young woman he thought
looked promising. She told
him she was from New jersey
— had just moved to L.A.- —
found a job waitressing — had
driven seven hours to go to the
ball — and was planning on
spending the weekend in
Reno. Nice kind. Later we saw
her doing a solo dance on the
walk ramp, her eyes closed and
body swaying sensuously. A
group of men stood around
her, eyes glued on her, expres
sions close to ecstacy on their
faces. I wonder if she ever
made it to Reno. . . .
George Carlin finally ap
peared in a sulking mood, and
proved that he could be just as
tasteless, unimaginative, and
boring as anyone. While I was
preoccupied booing him, my
friend (undaunted) slipped
away in search of women.
I thought I was dressed quite
conservatively but I must have
looked more authentic than I
intended. While my friend was
off hunting, two big fellows
came up to me and began ad
miring my legs . . . with their
hands. I shoved them politely
away. They shoved me politely
back. I shoved again. One
snarled (just like in a Western
where the bad guy intention
ally starts a fight with the puny
little bartender) "Nobody
pushes me around, baby," and
he pushed my shoulder.
Meanwhile, the people around
us just stood watching. This
pushing and shoving went on
for a few more minutes and
then I guess they got bored,
because they left.
When my friend wandered
back, we decided to leave.
There was a man in the hallway
bleeding profusely from cuts
all over his face.
We finally got through the
crowds and back to the car. I
sighed with relief as I sank to
the seat. He turned the car on.
It purred and died. Somebody
had siphoned the gas.
