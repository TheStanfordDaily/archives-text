## Explaining low voter turnout 
### 
On November 7, very few Americans
will trek to the polls to exercise their
"right" to participate in our society, i.e. to
vote. Political scientists, sociologists and
news persons all have their own opinion
about why people do not vote. However, I
would contend that the range of explana
tions offered by members of the select,
published, "public watchers" do not
begin to forward an explanation.
Two simple observations can begin to
contribute to an explanation for low voter
turnout in our political system: 1) Most
Americans are socialized through present
day social, political and economic institu
tions in a manner that leads to non
participation in the public and private —
i.e., workplace — affairs; and 2) Our polit
ical system does not offer opportunities
for participation.
Let me elaborate on my first point. From
childhood, most people are placed in in
stitutional arrangements that are directly
or indirectly hierarchical and undemocra
tic. The American educational system is a
prime example of an institution that de
fines for an individual his or her place in
society. This system's purpose, whether or
not this purpose is recognized by educa
tion "officials," is to sort young Ameri
cans. Children are routed in a manner that
will ultimately lead to predominantly
white middle class men — those who are
trained in the appropriate middle class
capitalist values and behavior patterns —
as the managerial, professional, and
capitalist elite. Further, the system distri
butes non-white men and women as well
as white women to the roles of the clerical
and laboring sub-classes. In accordance
with the track in which an individual is
placed, he or she is socialized either to

participate in decision making processes
(e.g., wide course choice or extracurricu
lar activities), or not to engage in such
participatory behavior. In the latter case
the child becomes a receptable for the
"knowledge" (or lack thereof) that consti
tutes adequate and appropriate prepara
tion for the bottom rungs of society's
hierarchy.
Now, in the context of most peoples'
(the members of the subclasses) feelings
of powerlessness and their predisposition
not to participate in decision making pro
cesses, we must look at the potential
hazards for those who would participate.
First, we must note that most Americans
do not have the time to follow the "politi
cal" scene's twists and turns. Most work
ing class Americans do not have the space
in their lives to become so educated, and if
they are fortunate enough to have some
time, they often do not have the basic
educational skills to become "aware about
the 'issues' " (remember the routing sys
tem). In addition, if a group of individuals
do become aware of, and interested in, a
cause or issue, these people may not have
the resources (financial, skills, person
power) to "compete" in the electoral pro
cess. It is those people who are well edu
cated, well-off financially, and possessing
adequate "leisure" time who seem to be
most active. These are also the people who
have "learned" in their educational and
workplace experiences that participation
is an appropriate and viable activity.
Thus, our society is left with a certain
group of people which is most apt and able
to enter into the electoral and public deci
sion making processes. These peoples' in
terests and solutions become the "burn
ing questions of our time." There is very

little choice in the electoral arena for any
alternative view points, alternatives lo
what society has labelled the "conserva
tive" and "liberal" lines. What G. Wright
Mills has termed the "power elite" and
others call the ruling class, not only
phrases the question, but it also provides
the spectrum from which an answer is to
be chosen, and then proceeds to play a
heavy part in determining the final "ans
wer."
All of this is done under the guise of
political democracy. Many people realize
that "all politicians are really the same."
They recognize that Gov. )erry Brown's
solutions are not really going to be that
different than Evelle Younger's. Karl Marx
ties up this notion nicely when he notes
that most elections only give the oppres
sed classes a chance to "choose their op
pressors." By this Marx means that a
choice of individuals from the ruling class
is offered up in the name of democracy.
For a long time I have considered myself
to be one of those people who felt that
there is really no choice in the political
"marketplace." Essentially, I still feel this
way. However, as of late I have seen issues
spring into the limelight that are not just of
the hum drum type. Rather, these "issues"
are a direct attack on people's basic
human rights, rights that our system has
continuously heralded as its own. For that
reason I will make if to the polls on Nov. 7
to vote no on Proposition 6 and 7. I urge
everyone to do the same, whether you are
politically alienated, prone to non
participation or feeling inefficacious.
