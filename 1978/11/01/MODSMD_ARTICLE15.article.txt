## A 						philosophical contradiction 
### 
Whenever someone uses
broad metaphors in discussing
a certain issue to support their
viewpoint, I tend to be wary,
as they often are used to cover
up weaknesses in the argu
ments presented. Tim Davis'
column in the Daily (Oct. 25),
is no exception. His charac
terization of liberals as "wary
sheep" and conservatives as
"lonely eagles" is the first
warning that the following dis
cussion might be rather dubi
ous. I disagree with his state
ment that because a perspec
tive is held by a majority of
people, it necessarily repre
sents the product of enslaved
minds. Neither can I accept
the opposite: that minority
views are held by independent
minds.
The fundamental problem
with his column is that he
states a basic philosophical
contradiction. On one hand,
Davis argues that we should all
be free to think for ourselves:
"Our country was based on
freedom â€” freedom for the
individual to think for himself,
not collectively." I wholehear
tedly concur with him on this
point. But his treatment of
abortion and homosexuality
contradicts this idea, leading
one to believe that the major
ity has the right to determine
for individuals what they may
do with their own bodies,
and/or opinions. Thus he
makes the following state
ment: "Being able to prevent
our children from being intro
duced to a way of life with
which we disagree should be a
basic tenet of the 'freedom' of
the majority." I can conceive
of no better way to turn a
people into a nation of
"sheep" than to keep them
from being exposed to ideas
and lifestyles that are labeled
"bad" simply because a major
ity of the population disagrees
with them. How can people
think for themselves when the
content of what they are ex
posed to is strictly regulated
by majority preferences?

Abortion can also be used as
an example of this contradic
tion. Davis is arguing that the
majority of people can decide,
based on their moral stan
dards, whether a fetus is a liv
ing creature and whether it
deserves the same protections
accorded to normal human be
ings. The individual woman
would be bound by such a de
cision. But if we adopt the
view that people must think
for themselves, then I believe
that we must agree with the
letter by Alex Madonik, in the
same issue of the Daily, that
"there are cases where society
must leave the determination
of good and evil to individual
conscience." I feel abortion is
such a situation.
Besides the glaring con
tradiction in his arguments, I
take strong objection to his
views in regards to both abor
tion and homosexuality. In his
comments on abortion, Davis
declares that women who
need abortion lack self
control, and that they seek to
avoid the consequences of
their action. What about
couples that practice birth
control, which, for whatever
reasons, fails to prevent con
ception? Or what about a
woman who engages in sexual
intercourse with the intent of
bearing children, who then
decides that she is not ready to
assume the responsibility in
volved in raising them, and
wants to terminate the pre
gnancy? Should we punish
these people with unwanted
children because other people
believe that the rights of the
unborn must be protected at
all costs?
Turning to homosexuality, I
am amazed at his statement
that homosexuals already have
their freedom. Besides the fact
that only a handful of states
have removed legal sanctions
against homosexual practices,
it is still obvious that
homosexuals receive dis
crimination almost anywhere

they go if they decide to come
out of the closet. Additionally,
the assumption of those who
support the Briggs Initiative is
that homosexual teachers will
automatically transmit their
sexual preferences to school
children. I find that difficult to
agree with, even if one as
sumes that there is something
inherently wrong with
homosexuality and we need to
protect our children from it.
To sum up, if Davis is going
to be consistent in his state
ment that we should not let
others do our thinking for us,
then it seems to me that
people should have the right
to decide for themselves on

such issues as abortion and
sexual preference. To allow
the majority to impose its
morals on the rest of society in
such matters is no more laud
able than the "sheepish
liberalism" that Davis con
demns. If Davis is correct in
his characterization of conser
vatives as "lonely eagles soar
ing high above in the cool,
clean air," and if his logic is
representative of this group,
one might indeed welcome
their addition to the list of en
dangered species.
