# Stamos unanimously elected chairperson
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Junior Peter Stamos was unanim
ously elected Chairperson of the
ASSU Senate at last night's special
meeting. Graduate Sen. George
Drysdale was chosen Deputy Chair
person.
Stamos said he has much hope for
the senate this year and feels that the
coming months will be a "turning
point for student legislature at Stan
ford."
Last Thursday, the senate post
poned electing their chairperson
until its members could more care
fully consider all the possible candi
dates. Stamos remained the
nominee at that meeting and ran un
opposed last night.
Drysdale ran against under
graduate Sen. Ron Johnson and
graduate Sen. Geoff Baskir, who was
not present at the meeting. Drysdale
said he felt it was "time a graduate
student got into the senate heirar
chy."
The first duty of the chairperson
and his deputy will be to form the
three senate standing committees.
Stamos said he plans to have all the
senators assigned to committees by
Thursday afternoon. Since nine bills
have already been sent to these
committees, Stamos emphasized
that they must be ready to give their
reports at the full senate meeting
next week.

Stamos said that to improve senate
efficiency, he intends to let only the
most urgent bills reach the senate
floor without going through commit
tee first.
Stamos said that the senators he
has spoken to are very enthusiastic
and share the same basic concerns
for improving the legitimacy and re
sponsiveness of the senate. "Our
goal is to do a good enough job so
that proposals like CRAP would be
looked on as an absurdity."
One of the first changes Stamos
said he wants to make is to include
his deputy chairperson in more deci
sions. "In the past it (deputy chair)
has been a name-only position," he
added, but this year he said he wants
Drysdale to have an "extended,
larger role."
In an effort to increase the senate's
visibility, Stamos mentioned a bill by
Senators Ron lohnson and Ted Gar
denswartz which would assign each
senator a group of dorms to occa
sionally eat and attend house meet
ings at, in order to get to know the
students who live there.
Stamos is also considering a "bring
a friend" policy to increase the at
tendance of non-senators at
meetings, which has been virtually
non-existent in the past. Each
senator would be urged to bring a
friend to meetings, who could speak
on issues of importance to them.
