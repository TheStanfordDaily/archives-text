### LIZ SCHERMER 
At last, even earless stu
dents here will have an al
ternative to the usual
weekend frat parties and
movies. Encina Commons is
turning into a "nightclub"
five times this quarter, offer
ing a variety of name enter
tainment, beerand food in a
relaxed atmosphere for a
price unbeatable anywhere
in the Bay Area.
"This is one of the best
programs that ever hit Stan
ford," said ASSU Special
Events Director Brian
Becker.
The Commons' in
concert series offers various
types of entertainment in
cluding jazz acts, contem
porary music and comedy.
There are shows approxi
mately twice a month,
Becker said.

The series began with jazz
musicians Eddie Jefferson
and Richie Cole in early Oc
tober and continued with
three groups who per
formed last weekend.
Cal Tjader, known around
the world as a vibes player,
appeared in two consecu
tive shows Friday night. Tim
Moore, associate director of
special events and director
of the Commons' in-concert
series, called Tjader "the
Bay Area's top Latin Jazz ar
tist."
Saturday night's enter
tainment featured "new
wave" rock and roll with
The Readymades and Crispy
Baby in a special Halloween
celebration. In two weeks, a
comedy troupe, called The
Duck's Breath Mystery The
ater will appear. According
to Moore, the group's act

will be "much like Firesign
Theater or Monty Python."
Free poocorn
Popcorn is served free
and the beer is only 35 cents
during the Commons' con
certs. Unlike most clubs,
"you don't have to be 21 to
go," said Heather McCall
ion, assistant director for
the in-concert series.
Though Eddie Jefferson
drew a full house, Moore
said he expects an "even
stronger crowd" for future
concerts.
Moore said the Commons
is a good place forclub con
certs. "Just about every seat
is a good seat. You feel like
you're part of the show," he
commented.
The in-concert series is
sponsored by ASSU Special
Events in association with
Tresidder Union.

The Office of Student Ac- 112
tivities is also "being very E
supportive financially," ac- [
cording to Moore.
The Special Events office
is working with UC-
Berkeley to acquire acts not
in competition with the San
Francisco clubs.
This means the Commons £
can obtain cheaper rates
from the performers tour- H
ing the Bay Area. Since the
concerts are not intended to
make large profits, the □
Commons is able to offer
name entertainment to stu- 5
dents here at a low cost. q
One student who at- 0
tended the Eddie Jefferson
concert said, "The scene jJ
was really relaxed, they
music was excellent, the []
beer cheap. What more can E
you ask for three bucks?" □

Though Eddie Jefferson
drew a full house, Moore
said he expects an "even
stronger crowd" for future
concerts.
Moore said the Commons
is a good place forclub con
certs. "Just about every seat
is a good seat. You feel like
you're part of the show," he
commented.
The in-concert series is
sponsored by ASSU Special
Events in association with
Tresidder Union.

The Office of Student Ac- 112
tivities is also "being very E
supportive financially," ac- [
cording to Moore.
The Special Events office
is working with UC-
Berkeley to acquire acts not
in competition with the San
Francisco clubs.
This means the Commons £
can obtain cheaper rates
from the performers tour- H
ing the Bay Area. Since the
concerts are not intended to
make large profits, the □
Commons is able to offer
name entertainment to stu- 5
dents here at a low cost. q
One student who at- 0
tended the Eddie Jefferson
concert said, "The scene jJ
was really relaxed, they
music was excellent, the []
beer cheap. What more can E
you ask for three bucks?" □
At last, even earless stu
dents here will have an al
ternative to the usual
weekend frat parties and
movies. Encina Commons is
turning into a "nightclub"
five times this quarter, offer
ing a variety of name enter
tainment, beerand food in a
relaxed atmosphere for a
price unbeatable anywhere
in the Bay Area.
"This is one of the best
programs that ever hit Stan
ford," said ASSU Special
Events Director Brian
Becker.
The Commons' in
concert series offers various
types of entertainment in
cluding jazz acts, contem
porary music and comedy.
There are shows approxi
mately twice a month,
Becker said.

The series began with jazz
musicians Eddie Jefferson
and Richie Cole in early Oc
tober and continued with
three groups who per
formed last weekend.
Cal Tjader, known around
the world as a vibes player,
appeared in two consecu
tive shows Friday night. Tim
Moore, associate director of
special events and director
of the Commons' in-concert
series, called Tjader "the
Bay Area's top Latin Jazz ar
tist."
Saturday night's enter
tainment featured "new
wave" rock and roll with
The Readymades and Crispy
Baby in a special Halloween
celebration. In two weeks, a
comedy troupe, called The
Duck's Breath Mystery The
ater will appear. According
to Moore, the group's act

will be "much like Firesign
Theater or Monty Python."
Free poocorn
Popcorn is served free
and the beer is only 35 cents
during the Commons' con
certs. Unlike most clubs,
"you don't have to be 21 to
go," said Heather McCall
ion, assistant director for
the in-concert series.
