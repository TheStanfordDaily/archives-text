# Soccer team stings Hornets, 10-4
## Rafalovich sets record in win 
### DEAN EYRE 
It seems that Stanford's soccer team
needs to suffer shutouts before the of
fense is shocked into reality. After Santa
Clara blanked the Cardinals 2-0 almost two
weeks ago, the offense cot back on track,
taking out their trust its >n Sonoma
State and St. Mary's in 27 ll attack.
Yesterday, the Cards "entertained" Sac
ramento State with Ted Rafalovich and
Dan McNevin putting on the show at
center stage on the way to a 10-4 win over
the Hornets.
The victory breaks a string of three con
secutive shutout losses — 1-0 at LA State,
2-0 at UCLA and 3-0 against visiting USF. In
addition to the team laurels, a personal
triumph was celebrated by Rafalovich on
All Hallows' Eve — the freshman's hat trick
plus one gives him a total of 27 goals for
the season, a new school record. The pre
vious mark of 26 was established by Bob
Geiger, as a senior in the 1976 season, and
Rafalovich still has two more opportunities
to build on his total.
"Despite scoring 17 and 10 goals against
Sonoma arid St. Mary's, we have not been
playing good offense," said assistant
coach Phil Wright. "We switched to offen

sive drills in practice."
According to Wright, the result of the
workouts since the USF game has been to
create "a lot more movement, more fluid
ity, and the execution was much better."
Concentrating on t l, coring paid full
dividends as in.prov ill handling of
fered the Cards moi m a few oppor
tunities in the Hornet s goal area.
Sacramento's offense was dominated by
Fred Dass, who recorded all four Hornet
goals. For the Cards, McNevin and
Rafalovich both logged four scores and
three assists. Also breaking through to
tally for Stanford were Paul Kozachenko
with a goal and an assist and Peter Phillips
with one goal. Mark Triska and Rick Gor
don both had assists.
"The Rafalovich-McNevin combination
blew them off the field," Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge observed. "I was concerned
because of the three losses. In my pre
game talk I emphasized finishing with a
respectable season."
While the loss to UCLA last week just
about eliminated Stanford from any post
season considerations, Lodge said, "If we
beat USC and Berkeley the same way, it
will confuse the rating people, especially if

UCLA and Santa Clara have bad
weekends."
Lodge likened the Hornets to the San
Francisco State team, which put up a good
fight until the Cards opened up in the sec
ond half and emerged with a 5-3 win.
"They kept coming even though they were
down 5-2 and one player down (because of
a red card with2o minutes remaining in the
game)," Lodge said.
"A lot of good goals were scored today,"
Rafalovich said. "This team (Sacramento)
is good, too — not a 10-4 team. We have
been moving well, especially against USF.
We started moving because we had to."
And what about the scoring record?
"Forone thing, I'm glad it'sover — there's
no pressure now. Next season should be
better for me; in my first year there have
been things to get adjusted to," he said.
Lodge was obviously pleased with the
win, the return of the offense and
Rafalovich's record, but he also singled
out McNevin's role at midfield. "He had
one of the finest games I've seen him
play," he commented.

ramento State with Ted Rafalovich and
Dan McNevin putting on the show at
center stage on the way to a 10-4 win over
the Hornets.
The victory breaks a string of three con
secutive shutout losses — 1-0 at LA State,
2-0 at UCLA and 3-0 against visiting USF. In
addition to the team laurels, a personal
triumph was celebrated by Rafalovich on
All Hallows' Eve — the freshman's hat trick
plus one gives him a total of 27 goals for
the season, a new school record. The pre
vious mark of 26 was established by Bob
Geiger, as a senior in the 1976 season, and
Rafalovich still has two more opportunities
to build on his total.
"Despite scoring 17 and 10 goals against
Sonoma arid St. Mary's, we have not been
playing good offense," said assistant
coach Phil Wright. "We switched to offen

sive drills in practice."
According to Wright, the result of the
workouts since the USF game has been to
create "a lot more movement, more fluid
ity, and the execution was much better."
Concentrating on t l, coring paid full
dividends as in.prov ill handling of
fered the Cards moi m a few oppor
tunities in the Hornet s goal area.
Sacramento's offense was dominated by
Fred Dass, who recorded all four Hornet
goals. For the Cards, McNevin and
Rafalovich both logged four scores and
three assists. Also breaking through to
tally for Stanford were Paul Kozachenko
with a goal and an assist and Peter Phillips
with one goal. Mark Triska and Rick Gor
don both had assists.
"The Rafalovich-McNevin combination
blew them off the field," Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge observed. "I was concerned
because of the three losses. In my pre
game talk I emphasized finishing with a
respectable season."
While the loss to UCLA last week just
about eliminated Stanford from any post
season considerations, Lodge said, "If we
beat USC and Berkeley the same way, it
will confuse the rating people, especially if

UCLA and Santa Clara have bad
weekends."
Lodge likened the Hornets to the San
Francisco State team, which put up a good
fight until the Cards opened up in the sec
ond half and emerged with a 5-3 win.
"They kept coming even though they were
down 5-2 and one player down (because of
a red card with2o minutes remaining in the
game)," Lodge said.
"A lot of good goals were scored today,"
Rafalovich said. "This team (Sacramento)
is good, too — not a 10-4 team. We have
been moving well, especially against USF.
We started moving because we had to."
And what about the scoring record?
"Forone thing, I'm glad it'sover — there's
no pressure now. Next season should be
better for me; in my first year there have
been things to get adjusted to," he said.
Lodge was obviously pleased with the
win, the return of the offense and
Rafalovich's record, but he also singled
out McNevin's role at midfield. "He had
one of the finest games I've seen him
play," he commented.
