# Zetes overtake Theta Delts in race for IM football title
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
The Zetes knocked off the
Theta Delts 6-0 last week to
earn the top ranking in the "A"
division of intramural football.
The victory gives the Zetes a
3-0 record on the year and
drops the Theta Delts to 3-1.
Both teams have clinched
berths in the "A" league
playoffs and it appears likely
they will square off again for
the championship.
In the "B" leagues it was a
big week for both Bootables
teams as they remained unde
feated and cracked the top 10.

Bootables II moved their re
cord to 4-0 after stopping the
12th ranked Woosies, 25-12.
Bootables I are also 4-0 after
posting a 46-0 shutout this
week.
Elsewhere in the "B"
leagues, all the top-10 teams
were successful. Kappa Sigma
had a scare, however, barely
holding off El Cuadro, 2-0. The
Ghetto was particularly impre
ssive as they wallopped the
previously undefeated Phi
Delts, 40-6.
In the coed leagues, the
only top-10 casualty was Bur
bank, a 13-6 loser to Los Arcos.

Taste of Honey remains the top
co-ed team with a 4-0 record.
In women's league play, the
two standout teams continued
to dominate. Top-ranked High
Energy won to improve their
record to 3-0, while Taste of
Honey, the second-ranked
team, won their second con
secutive game.
Playoffs for all divisions
begin Friday, Oct. 10. After the
regular season concludes Sun
day, a make-up week will be
held for all postponed games.
The top two teams from each
six-team league will qualify for
the playoffs.

The Zetes knocked off the
Theta Delts 6-0 last week to
earn the top ranking in the "A"
division of intramural football.
The victory gives the Zetes a
3-0 record on the year and
drops the Theta Delts to 3-1.
Both teams have clinched
berths in the "A" league
playoffs and it appears likely
they will square off again for
the championship.
In the "B" leagues it was a
big week for both Bootables
teams as they remained unde
feated and cracked the top 10.

Bootables II moved their re
cord to 4-0 after stopping the
12th ranked Woosies, 25-12.
Bootables I are also 4-0 after
posting a 46-0 shutout this
week.
Elsewhere in the "B"
leagues, all the top-10 teams
were successful. Kappa Sigma
had a scare, however, barely
holding off El Cuadro, 2-0. The
Ghetto was particularly impre
ssive as they wallopped the
previously undefeated Phi
Delts, 40-6.
