# Santa Clara bows to Cards
## 
### JEFF POWELL 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team coasted past hap
less host Santa Clara last night
15-4, 15-5, 15-8 in an effort
characterized by "overall unin
spired play," according to as
sistant coach John Bekins. The
victory, however, raised the
spiker's ledger to 7-4.
Hoping to rebound from a
disheartening loss to San Jose
State Friday night, the Cardi
nals turned in an average per
formance considering the rela
tively weak competition.
Stanford's sub-par play
wasn't a post-San Jose letdown
but rather a response to the
poor caliber of Santa Clara
play. Even if Stanford had
beaten San Jose, Bekins said he
felt that the squad would have
turned in a similar perfor
mance. The play "wasn't poor
but it wasn't the same kind of
performance we had against San
Jose, either, as it was very hard
to get up emotionally for a
weaker team,' said Bekins.
Later this week the spikers
travel south once again, this
time to participate in the UCLA
invitational tournament to
morrow through Saturday. The

tourney is divided into four di
visions of six teams apiece and
the women unfortunately find
themselves drawn into an ex
ceedingly tough pool.
Within their division, the
Cards face the likes of Hawaii,
Long Beach State and Alabama.
From there, they must finish
first or second to move on to
the resulting eight-team tour
ney.
The UCLA tournament is a
"prestigious tournament and
most good teams in the nation
venture to Southern California
to play," said Bekins.
A good showing is essential
for the spikers to keep their
slim hopes for a regional berth
alive.
Although the official answer
won't be known for a while,
there are a few open spots and
consequently, a slight oppor
tunity for the Cards to sneak in
via qualification as a second
place league finisher. How
ever, the Cards must 1) per
form admirably at UCLA and 2)
win the remainder of their
three league matches.
The outcome of the former
will be determined later this
week in the City of the
Angels.
