# Fourth mentor in three years
## Another coach for 49ers 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Pete
McCulley was fired and re
placed by one of his assistants,
Fred O'Connor, as the San
Francisco 49ers changed head
coaches Tuesday for the fourth
time in three years.
"We felt a change had to be
made, and right now, not at the
end of the season," said team
owner Edward Deßartolo Jr.
who, with General Manager
Joe Thomas, decided after
Sunday's 38-20 loss to the
Washington Redskins that
McCulley must go.
McCulley got the word
Tuesday from Thomas, the
man who hired him last
January, signed him to a
three-year contract and said, "I
believe together we can give
San Francisco fans the kind of
team they've been waiting
for."
Instead, the 39-year-old
O'Connor takes over a
mistake-prone young team —
15 players are rookies — that
under McCulley, 46, was 1-8.
There is no worse record in the
National Football League.
"Fred O'Connor has been
made interim coach for the
remainder of the season, and
Dan Radakovich is returning to

the team as defensive coor
dinator," said Deßartolo, who
also announced the firing of a
defensive assistant, Jimmy
Carr.
Radakovich, who was with
the Pittsburgh Steelers when
they won Super Bowl titles,
came to the 49ers this season
but left this summer aflera dis
pute with McCulley.
Deßartolo, at 32 the NFL's
youngest team owner, bought
the 49ers before the 1977 sea
son and fired Monte Clark,
who had steered the team to an
8-6 finish in 1976, his first year
as a head coach. Clark served
as general manager as well as
coach, and the new owner

wanted Thomas, to run the
team.
Thomas, with a winning NFL
record behind him in stops at
Minnesota, Miami and Balti
more, hired a Los Angeles
Rams assistant, Ken Meyer, to
coach the 49ers last year. He
fired him after a 5-9 season.
Deßartolo said he felt the
latest coaching change was "a
joint decision that Joe and I
made."
He added, "Joe Thomas is
going to make this club a win
ner. He's already gotten us
some excellent playing mate
rial. I really believe it's just a
matter of time before we're a
winner."
