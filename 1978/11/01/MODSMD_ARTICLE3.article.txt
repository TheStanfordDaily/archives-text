# Letters sent to secondary schools outlining good academic programs
## 
### STEVE WARILA 
Students here are the lucky survivors of this country's
deteriorating secondary school system, or so the mem
bers of the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid (CUAFA) believe.
CUAFA is a committee of the Academic Senate which
makes suggestions to the senate concerning admissions
and financial aids policies. The committee, made up of
faculty, students and administrators, last June com
pleted 18 months of evaluating high school academic
programs.
As a result, Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon re
cently mailed a letter to 10,000 high schools across the
country outlining what a good high school program
should include.
Hargadon said he is concerned that "too many students
avoid math or science or English classes because they
don't like them." Consequently, too many students are
taking very weak schedules in high school and "closing
off large areas of interest early in life and limiting their
options," he added.
"The idea (of the letter) is to sound a warning bell,"
Hargadon said. "We have no problem finding qualified
students because we draw upon a large number of the
best students. But as a leading institution we have a
responsibility to state our concern that students are not
taking adequate class loads in high school."
Hargadon cited the lack of a sufficient background in
English as an important example.
Reading problems
"Inabilities in reading and writing have a cumulative
effect. Vou can avoid English classes, but if you don't
read well you are going to have a lot of trouble with
humanities and social science classes â€” even in the
sciences," Hargadon said.
Because of this, students start at a lower level, or don't
learn as much in a given period of time as they should,
according to Hargadon.
The committee found budget problems, such as those
related to Proposition 13, to be a cause of limited course
selection, said Hargadon.
He is also worried about what he calls "a buyers mar
ket" at the college level. Many good colleges are finding
it difficult to fill their freshman classes and are lowering

theiradmission requirements. The result, he said, is less
pressure on high school students to take demanding
courses.
One member of the committee, Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, said he felt so strongly about the com
mittee's work in this area that he "raised hell a couple of
times."
Study content
He said he also feels that "the content of high school
study has been eroded because high school require
ments are so flexible. Students can satisfy their require
ments by taking non-solid courses. Teachers of solid
courses then water down their courses to keep up en
rollment. The whole process seems to be one of ero
sion."
jack Friedenthal, professor of law and chairman of
CUAFA, emphasized another weakness in the system.
"Students with very good grades are applying and
being rejected without knowing why. They did not take
significant course loads. They avoided the hard-core
curriculum." The fault, said Friedenthal, often lies with
the high school counselors, who "have very little idea
about what's going on."
The committee as a whole found secondary education
to be in a "state of decay." Too many schedules, said
Marshall, consist of "leadership, baton-twirling and
basket-weaving."
The committee's purpose in writing the letter, said
Friedenthal, was to inform the public of this and to give
high school students a clear idea of what the better
universities are looking for. The letter specifically re
commends that applicants to the University take three
years each of English, mathematics and a foreign lan
guage, two years of history, a year of laboratory science
and some instruction in the fine arts.
Although the admissions office has already received
requests for copies of this document produced by
CUAFA, its impact cannot yet be determined, according
to Hargadon. Members of the committee describe it as
"one of the most important, precise and fairest of its
kind," and "possibly the first step in a major change."
Marshall said he regards it as an attempt to further the
cause of higher education and feels that because of it
' we can hold our heads a little higher."
