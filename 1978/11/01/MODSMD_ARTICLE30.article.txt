Oil strike threatening
Tehran, Iran — A strike by 37,000 refinery
workers threatened to cripple Iran's huge pet
roleum industry yesterday.
So far, the strike in the riot-torn country has
reduced oil exports to the United States and
other world markets by 40 percent, a govern
ment official said.
The oil workers' demands include higher
pay and repeal of martial law.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter is
sued a strong public statement in support of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, praising him
for moving "toward democracy." Carter also
met with the shah's son, Crown Prince Reza.
U.S. energy officials in Washington said it
was too early to determine what impact the
strike will have on the United States, which
imports a total of 9.16 million barrels of oil
daily.
But State Department spokesman Hodding
Carter said the strike would have no im
mediate effect in the United States because
transport of oil from Iran requires six to eight
weeks.
Iran, which produces about 10 percent of
the oil in the non-Communist world, is the
second biggest U.S. oil supplier behind Saudi
Arabia. The United States imports 919,700 bar
relsaday from Iran and 1.2 million barrelsdaily
from the Saudis.
U.S. obstructs treaty

Brown contributes to Dymally
Los Angeles — In the wake of a poll showing
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally falling behind Repub
lican Mike Curb, Gov. Jerry Brown made a
$40,000 contribution yesterday to his Democ
ratic running mate.
Two contributions were the focus of political
attention yesterday — the Brown donation to
Dymally, and a $25,000 contribution received
by Brown from a harness race promoter.
Brown's gift to Dymally's campaign was an
nounced the same day the Los Angeles Times
published a poll showing Curb pulling three
percentage points ahead of Dymally, who had
led earlier polls.
"It could be as easily said that Curb will be
indicted as to say the lieutenant governor
would," Brown said. . . He's just making
these wild charges. . . . It's just whole cloth
and it has no part in California politics."
Floods feared after fires
Los Angeles — Fears of massive flooding in
the wake of three major fires last week were
expected to prompt a plea to the Board of
Supervisors today for $2.9 million for extra
equipment and staff to avert flood damage ex
pected to hit canyon areas.
"There is a serious potential for the homes
to be overwhelmed by rocks and mud" when
the rainy season starts, said county Chief En
gineer Arthur Bruington. He said extra funds
were needed for emergency debris retention
structures and for an additional 114 workers to
bring his depleted staff up to budgeted
strength.
The greatest flood and mud damage poten
tial is in the Trancas Canyon, below the

Aguora-Malibu fire, he said, noting that the
channel and side drains there cannot handle
rootless debris from the burned hillsides.
Younger won't back Curb
San lose — Evelle Younger is refusing to back
or repudiate a prediction by his running mate
for lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, that Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally is guilty of criminal con
duct and will be indicted.
The Republican candidate for governor said
he "would not speculate" on Democrat Dym
ally's guilt or innocence, even though Curb
said he based his comments in part on the
attorney general's own statement about an FBI
probe of possible political corruption in
California.
In other campaign developments Monday,
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said he is "de
termined" to make it through the next two
years without a tax increase, and Younger suf
fered another setback with the publication of a
Los Angeles Times poll showing Brown's lead
stretching to 23 percentage points.
Curb, on Saturday, predicted an indictment
against Dymally for unspecified criminal of
fenses. And on Monday, Curb told reporters,
"I believe Dymally will be indicted, and I think
he's guilty of criminal offenses while in office."
Brown joined the fray over Curb's remark,
calling it "probably the most reprehensible
comment I have ever heard in a California elec
tion with one week to go.
"For Mr. Curb to say that, with no evidence
whatsoever and very little opportunity for the
lieutenant governor to refute that, goes to
show just what Mr. Curb is," Brown said.
And Dymally, who for two days did not re
spond to the Curb attack, finally issued a de
nial of wrongdoing and branded Curb's re
marks as "unethical and desperate tactics,
which are obviously a deliberate political
smear."
Congressional races expensive
Washington — Thirty members of Congress
raised more than $1.7 million and spent over $1
million defending their seats even though they
had no opposition in either the primary or
general election.
Another 26 candidates who faced minor op
position — they won with more than 70 per
cent of the vote in the primary or faced only
third-party or write-in candidates in the gen
eral election — raised nearly $1.7 million and
spent $1.4 million in their races, according to
the latest figures from the Federal Election
Commission.
The figures show that running for Congress
can be an expensive proposition — even when
no one else wants the job.
Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Calif.) has said, "I

always run scared, even when I'm unop
posed." This election, however, Roybal faces
opposition.
There is nothing illegal about such fund
raising and, in fact, a well-stocked campaign
chest often can aid a congressman's bid for
re-election by discouraging opposition.

raised more than $1.7 million and spent over $1
million defending their seats even though they
had no opposition in either the primary or
general election.
Another 26 candidates who faced minor op
position — they won with more than 70 per
cent of the vote in the primary or faced only
third-party or write-in candidates in the gen
eral election — raised nearly $1.7 million and
spent $1.4 million in their races, according to
the latest figures from the Federal Election
Commission.
The figures show that running for Congress
can be an expensive proposition — even when
no one else wants the job.
Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Calif.) has said, "I

always run scared, even when I'm unop
posed." This election, however, Roybal faces
opposition.
There is nothing illegal about such fund
raising and, in fact, a well-stocked campaign
chest often can aid a congressman's bid for

Oil strike threatening
Tehran, Iran — A strike by 37,000 refinery
workers threatened to cripple Iran's huge pet
roleum industry yesterday.
So far, the strike in the riot-torn country has
reduced oil exports to the United States and
other world markets by 40 percent, a govern
ment official said.
The oil workers' demands include higher
pay and repeal of martial law.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter is
sued a strong public statement in support of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, praising him
for moving "toward democracy." Carter also
met with the shah's son, Crown Prince Reza.
U.S. energy officials in Washington said it
was too early to determine what impact the
strike will have on the United States, which
imports a total of 9.16 million barrels of oil
daily.
But State Department spokesman Hodding
Carter said the strike would have no im
mediate effect in the United States because
transport of oil from Iran requires six to eight
weeks.
Iran, which produces about 10 percent of
the oil in the non-Communist world, is the
second biggest U.S. oil supplier behind Saudi
Arabia. The United States imports 919,700 bar

Brown contributes to Dymally
Los Angeles — In the wake of a poll showing
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally falling behind Repub
lican Mike Curb, Gov. Jerry Brown made a
$40,000 contribution yesterday to his Democ
ratic running mate.
Two contributions were the focus of political
attention yesterday — the Brown donation to
Dymally, and a $25,000 contribution received
by Brown from a harness race promoter.
Brown's gift to Dymally's campaign was an
nounced the same day the Los Angeles Times
published a poll showing Curb pulling three
percentage points ahead of Dymally, who had
led earlier polls.
"It could be as easily said that Curb will be
indicted as to say the lieutenant governor
would," Brown said. . . He's just making
these wild charges. . . . It's just whole cloth
and it has no part in California politics."
Floods feared after fires
Los Angeles — Fears of massive flooding in
the wake of three major fires last week were
expected to prompt a plea to the Board of
Supervisors today for $2.9 million for extra
equipment and staff to avert flood damage ex
pected to hit canyon areas.
"There is a serious potential for the homes
to be overwhelmed by rocks and mud" when
the rainy season starts, said county Chief En
gineer Arthur Bruington. He said extra funds
were needed for emergency debris retention
structures and for an additional 114 workers to
bring his depleted staff up to budgeted
strength.
The greatest flood and mud damage poten
tial is in the Trancas Canyon, below the

Aguora-Malibu fire, he said, noting that the
channel and side drains there cannot handle
rootless debris from the burned hillsides.
Younger won't back Curb
San lose — Evelle Younger is refusing to back
or repudiate a prediction by his running mate
for lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, that Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally is guilty of criminal con
duct and will be indicted.
The Republican candidate for governor said
he "would not speculate" on Democrat Dym
ally's guilt or innocence, even though Curb
said he based his comments in part on the
attorney general's own statement about an FBI
probe of possible political corruption in
California.
In other campaign developments Monday,
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said he is "de
termined" to make it through the next two
years without a tax increase, and Younger suf
fered another setback with the publication of a
Los Angeles Times poll showing Brown's lead
stretching to 23 percentage points.
Curb, on Saturday, predicted an indictment
against Dymally for unspecified criminal of
fenses. And on Monday, Curb told reporters,
"I believe Dymally will be indicted, and I think
he's guilty of criminal offenses while in office."
Brown joined the fray over Curb's remark,
calling it "probably the most reprehensible
comment I have ever heard in a California elec
tion with one week to go.
"For Mr. Curb to say that, with no evidence
whatsoever and very little opportunity for the
lieutenant governor to refute that, goes to
show just what Mr. Curb is," Brown said.
And Dymally, who for two days did not re
spond to the Curb attack, finally issued a de
nial of wrongdoing and branded Curb's re
marks as "unethical and desperate tactics,
which are obviously a deliberate political
smear."

Younger won't back Curb
San lose — Evelle Younger is refusing to back
or repudiate a prediction by his running mate
for lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, that Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally is guilty of criminal con
duct and will be indicted.
The Republican candidate for governor said
he "would not speculate" on Democrat Dym
ally's guilt or innocence, even though Curb
said he based his comments in part on the
attorney general's own statement about an FBI
probe of possible political corruption in
California.
In other campaign developments Monday,
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said he is "de
termined" to make it through the next two
years without a tax increase, and Younger suf
fered another setback with the publication of a
Los Angeles Times poll showing Brown's lead
stretching to 23 percentage points.
Curb, on Saturday, predicted an indictment
against Dymally for unspecified criminal of
fenses. And on Monday, Curb told reporters,
"I believe Dymally will be indicted, and I think
he's guilty of criminal offenses while in office."
Brown joined the fray over Curb's remark,
calling it "probably the most reprehensible
comment I have ever heard in a California elec
tion with one week to go.
"For Mr. Curb to say that, with no evidence
whatsoever and very little opportunity for the
lieutenant governor to refute that, goes to
show just what Mr. Curb is," Brown said.
And Dymally, who for two days did not re
spond to the Curb attack, finally issued a de
nial of wrongdoing and branded Curb's re
marks as "unethical and desperate tactics,
which are obviously a deliberate political
smear."
Congressional races expensive
Washington — Thirty members of Congress
raised more than $1.7 million and spent over $1
million defending their seats even though they
had no opposition in either the primary or
general election.
Another 26 candidates who faced minor op
position — they won with more than 70 per
cent of the vote in the primary or faced only
third-party or write-in candidates in the gen
eral election — raised nearly $1.7 million and
spent $1.4 million in their races, according to
the latest figures from the Federal Election
Commission.
The figures show that running for Congress
can be an expensive proposition — even when
no one else wants the job.
Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Calif.) has said, "I

always run scared, even when I'm unop
posed." This election, however, Roybal faces
opposition.
There is nothing illegal about such fund

Oil strike threatening
Tehran, Iran — A strike by 37,000 refinery
workers threatened to cripple Iran's huge pet
roleum industry yesterday.
So far, the strike in the riot-torn country has
reduced oil exports to the United States and
other world markets by 40 percent, a govern

The oil workers' demands include higher
pay and repeal of martial law.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter is
sued a strong public statement in support of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, praising him
for moving "toward democracy." Carter also
met with the shah's son, Crown Prince Reza.
U.S. energy officials in Washington said it
was too early to determine what impact the
strike will have on the United States, which
imports a total of 9.16 million barrels of oil
daily.
But State Department spokesman Hodding
Carter said the strike would have no im

transport of oil from Iran requires six to eight
weeks.
Iran, which produces about 10 percent of
the oil in the non-Communist world, is the

Brown contributes to Dymally
Los Angeles — In the wake of a poll showing
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally falling behind Repub

$40,000 contribution yesterday to his Democ
ratic running mate.
Two contributions were the focus of political
attention yesterday — the Brown donation to
Dymally, and a $25,000 contribution received
by Brown from a harness race promoter.
Brown's gift to Dymally's campaign was an
nounced the same day the Los Angeles Times
published a poll showing Curb pulling three
percentage points ahead of Dymally, who had
led earlier polls.
"It could be as easily said that Curb will be
indicted as to say the lieutenant governor
would," Brown said. . . He's just making
these wild charges. . . . It's just whole cloth
and it has no part in California politics."
Floods feared after fires
Los Angeles — Fears of massive flooding in
the wake of three major fires last week were
expected to prompt a plea to the Board of
Supervisors today for $2.9 million for extra
equipment and staff to avert flood damage ex
pected to hit canyon areas.
"There is a serious potential for the homes
to be overwhelmed by rocks and mud" when
the rainy season starts, said county Chief En
gineer Arthur Bruington. He said extra funds
were needed for emergency debris retention
structures and for an additional 114 workers to
bring his depleted staff up to budgeted
strength.
The greatest flood and mud damage poten

Aguora-Malibu fire, he said, noting that the
channel and side drains there cannot handle
rootless debris from the burned hillsides.

Brown contributes to Dymally
Los Angeles — In the wake of a poll showing
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally falling behind Repub
lican Mike Curb, Gov. Jerry Brown made a
$40,000 contribution yesterday to his Democ
ratic running mate.
Two contributions were the focus of political
attention yesterday — the Brown donation to
Dymally, and a $25,000 contribution received
by Brown from a harness race promoter.
Brown's gift to Dymally's campaign was an
nounced the same day the Los Angeles Times
published a poll showing Curb pulling three
percentage points ahead of Dymally, who had
led earlier polls.
"It could be as easily said that Curb will be
indicted as to say the lieutenant governor
would," Brown said. . . He's just making
these wild charges. . . . It's just whole cloth
and it has no part in California politics."
Floods feared after fires
Los Angeles — Fears of massive flooding in
the wake of three major fires last week were
expected to prompt a plea to the Board of
Supervisors today for $2.9 million for extra
equipment and staff to avert flood damage ex
pected to hit canyon areas.
"There is a serious potential for the homes
to be overwhelmed by rocks and mud" when
the rainy season starts, said county Chief En
gineer Arthur Bruington. He said extra funds
were needed for emergency debris retention
structures and for an additional 114 workers to
bring his depleted staff up to budgeted
strength.
The greatest flood and mud damage poten
tial is in the Trancas Canyon, below the

Aguora-Malibu fire, he said, noting that the
channel and side drains there cannot handle
rootless debris from the burned hillsides.
Younger won't back Curb
San lose — Evelle Younger is refusing to back
or repudiate a prediction by his running mate
for lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, that Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally is guilty of criminal con
duct and will be indicted.
The Republican candidate for governor said
he "would not speculate" on Democrat Dym
ally's guilt or innocence, even though Curb
said he based his comments in part on the
attorney general's own statement about an FBI
probe of possible political corruption in
California.
In other campaign developments Monday,
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said he is "de
termined" to make it through the next two
years without a tax increase, and Younger suf
fered another setback with the publication of a
Los Angeles Times poll showing Brown's lead
stretching to 23 percentage points.
Curb, on Saturday, predicted an indictment
against Dymally for unspecified criminal of
fenses. And on Monday, Curb told reporters,
"I believe Dymally will be indicted, and I think
he's guilty of criminal offenses while in office."
Brown joined the fray over Curb's remark,
calling it "probably the most reprehensible
comment I have ever heard in a California elec
tion with one week to go.
"For Mr. Curb to say that, with no evidence
whatsoever and very little opportunity for the
lieutenant governor to refute that, goes to
show just what Mr. Curb is," Brown said.
And Dymally, who for two days did not re
spond to the Curb attack, finally issued a de
nial of wrongdoing and branded Curb's re
marks as "unethical and desperate tactics,
which are obviously a deliberate political
smear."
Congressional races expensive
Washington — Thirty members of Congress
raised more than $1.7 million and spent over $1
million defending their seats even though they
had no opposition in either the primary or
general election.
Another 26 candidates who faced minor op
position — they won with more than 70 per
cent of the vote in the primary or faced only
third-party or write-in candidates in the gen
eral election — raised nearly $1.7 million and
spent $1.4 million in their races, according to
the latest figures from the Federal Election
Commission.
The figures show that running for Congress
can be an expensive proposition — even when
no one else wants the job.
Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Calif.) has said, "I

always run scared, even when I'm unop
posed." This election, however, Roybal faces
opposition.
There is nothing illegal about such fund
raising and, in fact, a well-stocked campaign
chest often can aid a congressman's bid for
re-election by discouraging opposition.
Dow Jones slides
New York — The Dow (ones industrial aver
age skidded below the 800 level to its lowest
close in nearly six months yesterday as the
stock market resumed its severe late-October
slide.
The Dow (ones average of 30 industrials fell
19.40 points to 792.45, its lowest close since it
finished at 775.21 last April 13.
The day's volume on the Big Board totaled
42.88 million shares, down from Monday's
59.48 million, which was the third largest total
in exchange history.
Today's weather

Oil strike threatening
Tehran, Iran — A strike by 37,000 refinery
workers threatened to cripple Iran's huge pet
roleum industry yesterday.
So far, the strike in the riot-torn country has
reduced oil exports to the United States and
other world markets by 40 percent, a govern
ment official said.
The oil workers' demands include higher
pay and repeal of martial law.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter is
sued a strong public statement in support of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, praising him
for moving "toward democracy." Carter also
met with the shah's son, Crown Prince Reza.
U.S. energy officials in Washington said it
was too early to determine what impact the
strike will have on the United States, which
imports a total of 9.16 million barrels of oil
daily.
But State Department spokesman Hodding
Carter said the strike would have no im
mediate effect in the United States because
transport of oil from Iran requires six to eight
weeks.
Iran, which produces about 10 percent of
the oil in the non-Communist world, is the
second biggest U.S. oil supplier behind Saudi
Arabia. The United States imports 919,700 bar
relsaday from Iran and 1.2 million barrelsdaily
from the Saudis.
U.S. obstructs treaty
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem
Begin leaves today on a trip to the United
States and Canada amid hopes for an early
signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. But
some Israeli officials grumbled that
Washington was obstructing progress on the
pac"*
Begin is to receive an award from the New
York Council of Churches and go on to Canada
for an official visit Nov. 6. Besides addressing
the United Jewish Appeal group in Los
Angeles, the prime minister also will meet Is
rael's negotiating team to the Washington
peace talks.
At a party yesterday with Likud Party mem
bers honoring the award of the Nobel Peace
Prize, Begin said "a number of serious obsta
cles have been overcome" in the Washington
peace talks and it was possible that the treaty
would be signed quickly.
He said Dec. 9, the day before the awarding
of the Nobel, has been mentioned as a date. "If
the treaty will be ready by then, I think this will
be the best day,"he said.
"From my conversations today with
Washington, I can say there is a possibility that
a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt will be
signed soon," the prime minister said.

He said a number of obstacles separating the
Egyptian and Israeli positions had been over r
come, but cautioned that "not all obstacles
had been removed" and "great care must be
taken regarding what I'm saying.
USSR explains flight cutoff
Moscow — The Soviet Union, having quietly
grounded its trouble-plagued supersonic
Tu-144 passenger plane, observes the first an
niversary of its inaugural passenger flight
today without a single sonic boom to mark the
day.
The last flight known to Western aviation
experts here was June 6, and Soviet aviation
officials confirmed privately that one of the
aircraft has crashed. The ticket office at the
Soviet airline Aeroflot says flights are off until
at least the end of the year.
The Tu-144 has been having technical trou
ble ever since it made its first prototype flight
in 1968.
