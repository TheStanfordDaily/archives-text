# Newborn intensive care unit to expand
## Hospital nurses withdraw resignations 
### KEVIN COX 
University Hospital nurses here,
who had threatened to resign Nov. 7
withdrew their resignations yester
day after Hospital administrators ag
reed to provide the Newborn Inten
sive Care Unit with more doctors and
space.
However, a nurse in the unit said
that the tension over the 46 nurses'
"drastic action" remains in the unit.
She was one of 30 nurses in the
unit who attended a meeting called
by staff physicians in the unit, for
what she termed a "general sharing
of feelings.
"We had a talk with the physicians
to keep the lines of communication
open," said the nurse, who wished
to remain anonymous. "There were a
lot of different feelings about why
the nurses had to do what they did,
and people said what they felt.
"Our relationship with the physi
cians has changed because of our ac
tion. It will take a long time to heal
and get the spirit back in the unit,
which is so important to a nursery of
that kind," she commented.
She said her colleagues were
"generally happy" that they adminis
trators agreed to their demands of a
24-hour cleaning service, an extra
staff doctor, a parental consultation
room and additional space, includ
ing interior renovations and a stor
age closet.
But the nurse added that her col
leagues "regret their drastic action
because of the adverse publicity it
has brought to the unit."
The Hospital administration feels
"no animosity" toward the nurses,
according to Hospital Administrator
Gary Mecklenberg, adding that exist
ing "channels of communication"
will be maintained.
"We were sensitive to the nurses'
problems before all this happened,
and were working on solutions," he
said. "Obviously, something didn't

go entirely right, but I don't think it
calls for any reorganization."
Mecklenberg said that Head Nurse
Cecele Quaintance and Director of
Nursing Duane Walker were "excel
lent administrators," and that he
"expects good communication from
that process.
"I think there was open communi
cation," he said. "Obviously, the
nurses thought it wasn't good
enough."
He added that he was happy that
the nurses withdrew their resigna
tions.
"I'm glad the nurses won't resign,"

he said, "because that means we can
continue to give uninterrupted care.
It is a very valuable service to the
community."
Meanwhile, Hospital adminis
trators reported yesterday that
workmen began technical prepara
tions necessary for the removal of
interior walls in the unit, and that
babies were moved Monday night
from the rooms where construction
will take place.
Mecklenberg said that construc
tion of an entirely new unit will begin
next year, with July being "as good a
date as we've got right now."

"It's very imprecise," he said, ad
ding that the state still must approve
the architectural plans before con
struction can begin.
The nurse, however, said that she
is skeptical.
"They (the administrators) keep
saying that construction will start in
July, but I don't believe it," she said,
"and I'll only believe it when they
start.
"But with the additional space, we
can deal with the situation now.
They've come through with some
improvements and we'll be able to
live in that environment tor a while."
