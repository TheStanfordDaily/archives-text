"If they had a chance to get what
we have in Atlanta (Georgia-style
human rights), I think all Africans
would buy it," U.N. Ambassador An
drew Young told a crowd of 1500 yes
terday at a conference on U.S.
Foreign Policy in Africa. The confer

Young defended U.S. policy in Af

Young cautioned that it is impossi
ble for the U.S. to have an "African
policy" because of the diversity
within the continent, but he added
that Africans and Americans have "a
great deal" of shared interests.

telephones and communication

providing Africans with valuable in
frastructure and Americans a stake in
the new order developing in Africa.
"It just so happens that we (Ameri
cans) do things better than anyone
else on earth," he said.
Young said he believes that after
years of debate and experimentation
with other social systems, Africa is
turning to the West as a model. Afri
cans fought revolutions to make life
better for their people but "life now
is not better," Young quoted an An
golan official as saying. The official
concluded that Africans need to im
prove relations with the West.
The West also benefits from im
proved relations, according to
Young.
As the United States has used up its
mineral resources, it has "reached
out to the African continent to share
in its mineral wealth" and has paid
