"If they had a chance to get what
we have in Atlanta (Georgia-style
human rights), I think all Africans
would buy it," U.N. Ambassador An
drew Young told a crowd of 1500 yes
terday at a conference on U.S.
Foreign Policy in Africa. The confer
ence was co-sponsored by the De
partment of State and the World Af
fairs Council of Northern California.
Young defended U.S. policy in Af
rica as "the best of what the U.S. has
to offer." Increasing American in
volvement in Africa is mutually bene
ficial, he said, because "we are work
ing with them on their terms."
Young cautioned that it is impossi
ble for the U.S. to have an "African
policy" because of the diversity
within the continent, but he added
that Africans and Americans have "a
great deal" of shared interests.
For example, African need for
telephones and communication

networks benefit both nations by
providing Africans with valuable in
frastructure and Americans a stake in
the new order developing in Africa.
"It just so happens that we (Ameri
cans) do things better than anyone
else on earth," he said.
Young said he believes that after
years of debate and experimentation
with other social systems, Africa is
turning to the West as a model. Afri
cans fought revolutions to make life
better for their people but "life now
is not better," Young quoted an An
golan official as saying. The official
concluded that Africans need to im
prove relations with the West.
The West also benefits from im
proved relations, according to
Young.
As the United States has used up its
mineral resources, it has "reached
out to the African continent to share
in its mineral wealth" and has paid


Andrew Young
money in return, he said. African na
tions are using this money to purch
ase technical and developmental as
sistance from the United States, ac
cording to Young.
"I would be the last to say that we
have solved any problems. But I
would also fight to say that we have
made progress," he said.
Young conceded there have been
setbacks to what he considers
"amazing headway" made by the
Carter administration. The recent
visit of Rhodesian Prime Minister lan
Smith "threw us for a loss," accord
ing to Young. Young said that Smith
lied when he claims before a control
led press in Rhodesia that he had
won the support of the U.S. Senate,
but added that Smith's visit would
not irreparably damage diplomatic
ties.
Young said he is optimistic about
what he termed "experiments in dip
lomacy" in Namibia (Southwest Af
rica) and Rhodesia. He predicted that
Namibia would be independent
under U.N. supervision within the
coming year largely because of
American policies pursued in the
past year.
"We don't have a stick. We try to
use carrots," Young said, referring to
the American diplomatic approach to
Africa. Given American resistance to
any military involvement, Young said
that diplomacy, economic ties and
goodwill potential are all the United
States has to use.

providing Africans with valuable in

"It just so happens that we (Ameri
cans) do things better than anyone
else on earth," he said.
Young said he believes that after
years of debate and experimentation
with other social systems, Africa is
turning to the West as a model. Afri
cans fought revolutions to make life
better for their people but "life now
is not better," Young quoted an An
golan official as saying. The official
concluded that Africans need to im
prove relations with the West.
The West also benefits from im
proved relations, according to
Young.
As the United States has used up its
mineral resources, it has "reached
out to the African continent to share
in its mineral wealth" and has paid


Andrew Young
money in return, he said. African na
tions are using this money to purch
ase technical and developmental as
sistance from the United States, ac
cording to Young.
"I would be the last to say that we
have solved any problems. But I
would also fight to say that we have
made progress," he said.
Young conceded there have been
setbacks to what he considers
"amazing headway" made by the
Carter administration. The recent
visit of Rhodesian Prime Minister lan
Smith "threw us for a loss," accord
ing to Young. Young said that Smith
lied when he claims before a control
led press in Rhodesia that he had
won the support of the U.S. Senate,
but added that Smith's visit would
not irreparably damage diplomatic
ties.
Young said he is optimistic about
what he termed "experiments in dip
lomacy" in Namibia (Southwest Af
rica) and Rhodesia. He predicted that
Namibia would be independent
under U.N. supervision within the
coming year largely because of
American policies pursued in the
past year.
"We don't have a stick. We try to
use carrots," Young said, referring to
the American diplomatic approach to
Africa. Given American resistance to
any military involvement, Young said
that diplomacy, economic ties and
goodwill potential are all the United
States has to use.
"If they had a chance to get what
we have in Atlanta (Georgia-style
human rights), I think all Africans
would buy it," U.N. Ambassador An
drew Young told a crowd of 1500 yes
terday at a conference on U.S.
Foreign Policy in Africa. The confer
ence was co-sponsored by the De
partment of State and the World Af
fairs Council of Northern California.
Young defended U.S. policy in Af
rica as "the best of what the U.S. has
to offer." Increasing American in
volvement in Africa is mutually bene
ficial, he said, because "we are work
ing with them on their terms."
Young cautioned that it is impossi
ble for the U.S. to have an "African
policy" because of the diversity
within the continent, but he added
that Africans and Americans have "a
great deal" of shared interests.
For example, African need for
telephones and communication

networks benefit both nations by
providing Africans with valuable in
frastructure and Americans a stake in
the new order developing in Africa.
