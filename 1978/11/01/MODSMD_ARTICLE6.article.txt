# AFL-CIO rejects anti-inflation program

### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter's anti-inflation prog
ram was rejected as inequitable and
unfair yesterday by the AFL-CIO,
which called for a special session of
Congress to impose wage and price
controls.
The labor federation's decision
came as the administration began try
ing to implement its anti-inflation
plan with more detailed explanations
of the voluntary restraints it is asking
of workers and businessmen.
Meanwhile, the world's money
managers continued to show little
confidence in the administration's
ability to bring the economy under
control. The dollar fell to new lows in
several countries, and the New York
stock exchange continued its long
slide.
The AFL-ClO's decision, an
nounced after a meeting of its execu

tive council here, was a sharp rebuke
to the administration, which needs
the cooperation of millions of work
ers to make its program work.
Don't meet principles
The giant labor union said Carter's
program of voluntary controls on
wages and prices do not "meet the
principles of equity and fairness,"
contending that in practice it would
hold down only wages, not prices.
The union called for mandatory
controls on wages, prices, di
vidends, profit margins and interest
rates as the only way to ensure that
everyone suffers a fair share of the
burden.
Meanwhile, the Council on Wage
and Price Stability told the nation's
workers that all compensation —
from wages and insurance to sick
leave and vacation — must be consi
dered in computing the 7 percent
voluntary ceiling on pay increases
the program includes.
Only exception
The only exception for the wage
earner is increased overtime pay, the
council said, and that applies only

"as long as the conditions of that pay
are not changed."
Prices would be held to 0.5 percen
tage points below the increases in
the previous year, but the council
said businesses can raise prices by
more if it shows its costs increased
markedly in such areas as interest
rates, raw materials, crude pet
roleum and natural gas.
Economic news
Other economic news was mixed:
— The dollar continued its drop at
currency exchanges in Frankfurt and
Tokyo, although it posted modest
gains in early trading in Paris and
London. The dollar dropped to new
lows against the Japanese yen, the
Italian lire and the German mark.
Currency dealers said there were
some early signs of recovery, and the
markets were reported calmer than
during Monday's frantic dollar
plunge. But a West German dealer
said that, "There's no conscious
change in the market."
— In New York, the stock market
continued to drop as well. The Dow
Jones industrial average dropped

19.40 points to 792.45 yesterday, and
analysts continued to blame the long
slide on fears that the administration
will be unable to cope with inflation.
Recession 'inevitable'
— The director of the Council on
Wage and Price Stability said in New
York that a recession is "absolutely
inevitable" unless the administration
can demonstrate within the next six
months to a year that it can bring
inflation under control.
Barry Bosworth, the director, said
the administration must ignore un
employment for now and turn its at
tention to cutting spending. If it fails
to do so, Bosworth said, the country
will face the worst recession of the
post-war era.
Good news
— In a bit of good news, the Or
ganization for Economic Coopera
tion and Development reported in
Paris that U.S. energy imports fell
12.5 percent in the first eight months
of 1978 compared with the same
period in 1977.
