# Earn a degree by watching TV?

"Does anyone have questions?" a professor asks.
There is silence in the lecture hall here. None of the
students has a question. Then, a student miles away
asks a question. Other students in classrooms around
the Bay Area hear the question. Students here listen
to the question. The professor proceeds to answer.
This type of communication is possible through a
program here that uses television as a teaching
medium.
The Stanford Instructional Television Network
(SITN) is a program geared to "allowing people out
side of Stanford to do most of their coursework for a
masters degree through TV," Mary Lou Allen, assis
tant director of SITN, said. Employees from various
industries go to classrooms, sit at desks and listen to
the lectures of professors here. Via special "talk-back
systems," the students can ask questions and hear
professors' responses. The programs are televised on
four channels with frequencies appropriate for edu
cational television coverage, Allen said. A microwave
receiving disk at each of the industries transmits the
program down into the industry classroom. Lectures
are also video taped and mailed to industries and
corporations around the United States.
SITN, a program started 25 years ago, was originally
designed to develop a good relationship between
various industries and the University. Graduate
courses in numerous science-related fields, from
electrical engineering to computer science to physics
are televised as part of the program to corporations
such as Hewlett-Packard and the International Busi
ness Machines Corporation (IBM).
Delivery
Couriers pick up handouts and reading material at
professors' offices here and take them to the industry
classrooms for use by students there. The courses are
not specially designed for SITN. Rather, when an
industry request is made to a professor here to lec
ture "live," the professor goes to one of the televi
sion studios in Terman Engineering Center and deliv
ers the lecture. Students enrolled in the course here
attend class as usual. The lecture is then televised and
seen live in the industry classroom.
Certainly, "teaching through TV" is a different type

of experience than lecturing for a regular University
course. David Luenberger, professor of engineering
economic systems, said, "I can reach people out
there who wouldn't be able to take the classes other
wise." Luenberger said he thinks the program, has
"great potential."
Prof. Bernard Widrow, who teaches a course in
electrical engineering, said that, while at first lectur
ing to a television camera "seemed strange, it just
takes some adapting to. In addition, it was a step we
really needed to take. The long-term implications
were such that we needed to try out this type of
program."
Technicians
The television cameras are run almost exclusively
by undergraduate students here. Technical directors
(TDs), as the camera operators are called, learn their
craft by watching an experienced technical director
one or two times. After operating the cameras once
under observation, the TDs are on their own.
"We try to make the program enjoyable for those
out there in TV land," senior Diane Reedy said.
Senior Jay Roach, who majors in communications
and economics, said that a TD must deal with several
specific and unique problems. "The most basic
screw-ups occur because you don't have enough
hands," to manipulate the camera into innovative
positions for non-standard coverage of a lecture.
"In addition, it can be very intimidating to run
those cameras. Thereare tons of buttons and needles
all over the place, and you realize that you're all alone
in there." Once the basic techniques are mastered,
however, a TD may experiment with various creative
additions to the television coverage.
Classes are televised 12 hours a day over four chan
nels, all of which are used regularly, Allen said. Stu
dents in the industry-based classrooms take exams
and receive grades, like students here. Televising
classes is relatively inexpensive so only two or three
students need to show interest for a class to be tele
vised. This quarter, 1300 students from 55 Bay Area
industries are enrolled in the SITN program.
Expenses
Operating expenses total $200,000 annually. Re
venue accrues from fees charged to the industries

using the program. Industry students also pay tuition
fees to the University.
Industry students can enroll in any of three diffe
rent SITN programs. Students working for a masters
degree in a given field enroll in the Honors Coopera
tive Program (HCP). The non-registered option
(NRO) is available to students who have not yet been
admitted to the University graduate program of their
choice, but wish to continue their studies beyond a
bachelor's degree education. Students in this group
receive class handouts, complete homework assign
ments, take exams and are graded, as are HCP stu
dents. Finally, students in industries outside the Uni
versity may audit classes.
Despite the apparent success of the program, in
ductry students who view the televised classes have
complaints.
"Psychologically-speaking, the classroom struc
ture isn't there. Atmosphere can really make a differ
ence," |im Thallman, an employee of Hewlett-
Packard, said.
Another student in the program, Nancy
Schweigert, said the delay getting homework as
signments returned to industry students has "defi
nitely made the program less beneficial than a clas
sroom situation."
On the other hand, students agree that the prog
ram is "quite convenient. I could never have gone
through school without it."
Innovations
Professors here have conceived possible im
provements to the program. Leunberger said that
video taped lectures might be played for students in
the industrial classrooms. A teaching assistant would
be present foreach lecture to answer questions. Wid
row foresees a nationwide network system that
would operate between universities. "In this way,
students could take courses from people who are the
best in their business.
The SITN staff is comprised of approximately 10
people, excluding the TDs. Allen determines the cur
riculum each quarter, hires camera operators and
acts as a. liaison between faculty here and students
from the various industries.

program here that uses television as a teaching
medium.
The Stanford Instructional Television Network
(SITN) is a program geared to "allowing people out
side of Stanford to do most of their coursework for a
masters degree through TV," Mary Lou Allen, assis
tant director of SITN, said. Employees from various
industries go to classrooms, sit at desks and listen to
the lectures of professors here. Via special "talk-back
systems," the students can ask questions and hear
professors' responses. The programs are televised on
four channels with frequencies appropriate for edu
cational television coverage, Allen said. A microwave
receiving disk at each of the industries transmits the
program down into the industry classroom. Lectures
are also video taped and mailed to industries and
corporations around the United States.
SITN, a program started 25 years ago, was originally
designed to develop a good relationship between
various industries and the University. Graduate
courses in numerous science-related fields, from
electrical engineering to computer science to physics
are televised as part of the program to corporations
such as Hewlett-Packard and the International Busi
ness Machines Corporation (IBM).
Delivery
Couriers pick up handouts and reading material at
professors' offices here and take them to the industry
classrooms for use by students there. The courses are
not specially designed for SITN. Rather, when an
industry request is made to a professor here to lec
ture "live," the professor goes to one of the televi
sion studios in Terman Engineering Center and deliv
ers the lecture. Students enrolled in the course here
attend class as usual. The lecture is then televised and
seen live in the industry classroom.
Certainly, "teaching through TV" is a different type

of experience than lecturing for a regular University
course. David Luenberger, professor of engineering
economic systems, said, "I can reach people out
there who wouldn't be able to take the classes other
wise." Luenberger said he thinks the program, has
"great potential."
Prof. Bernard Widrow, who teaches a course in
electrical engineering, said that, while at first lectur
ing to a television camera "seemed strange, it just
takes some adapting to. In addition, it was a step we
really needed to take. The long-term implications
were such that we needed to try out this type of
program."
Technicians
The television cameras are run almost exclusively
by undergraduate students here. Technical directors
(TDs), as the camera operators are called, learn their
craft by watching an experienced technical director
one or two times. After operating the cameras once
under observation, the TDs are on their own.
"We try to make the program enjoyable for those
out there in TV land," senior Diane Reedy said.
Senior Jay Roach, who majors in communications
and economics, said that a TD must deal with several
specific and unique problems. "The most basic
screw-ups occur because you don't have enough
hands," to manipulate the camera into innovative
positions for non-standard coverage of a lecture.
"In addition, it can be very intimidating to run
those cameras. Thereare tons of buttons and needles
all over the place, and you realize that you're all alone
in there." Once the basic techniques are mastered,
however, a TD may experiment with various creative
additions to the television coverage.
Classes are televised 12 hours a day over four chan
nels, all of which are used regularly, Allen said. Stu
dents in the industry-based classrooms take exams
and receive grades, like students here. Televising
classes is relatively inexpensive so only two or three
students need to show interest for a class to be tele
vised. This quarter, 1300 students from 55 Bay Area
industries are enrolled in the SITN program.
Expenses
Operating expenses total $200,000 annually. Re
venue accrues from fees charged to the industries

using the program. Industry students also pay tuition
fees to the University.
Industry students can enroll in any of three diffe
rent SITN programs. Students working for a masters
degree in a given field enroll in the Honors Coopera
tive Program (HCP). The non-registered option
(NRO) is available to students who have not yet been
admitted to the University graduate program of their
choice, but wish to continue their studies beyond a
bachelor's degree education. Students in this group
receive class handouts, complete homework assign
ments, take exams and are graded, as are HCP stu
dents. Finally, students in industries outside the Uni
versity may audit classes.
Despite the apparent success of the program, in
ductry students who view the televised classes have
complaints.
"Psychologically-speaking, the classroom struc
ture isn't there. Atmosphere can really make a differ
ence," |im Thallman, an employee of Hewlett-
Packard, said.
Another student in the program, Nancy
Schweigert, said the delay getting homework as
signments returned to industry students has "defi
nitely made the program less beneficial than a clas
sroom situation."
On the other hand, students agree that the prog
ram is "quite convenient. I could never have gone
through school without it."
Innovations
Professors here have conceived possible im
provements to the program. Leunberger said that
video taped lectures might be played for students in
the industrial classrooms. A teaching assistant would
be present foreach lecture to answer questions. Wid
row foresees a nationwide network system that
would operate between universities. "In this way,
students could take courses from people who are the
best in their business.
The SITN staff is comprised of approximately 10
people, excluding the TDs. Allen determines the cur
riculum each quarter, hires camera operators and
acts as a. liaison between faculty here and students
from the various industries.

the lectures of professors here. Via special "talk-back
systems," the students can ask questions and hear
professors' responses. The programs are televised on
four channels with frequencies appropriate for edu
cational television coverage, Allen said. A microwave
receiving disk at each of the industries transmits the
program down into the industry classroom. Lectures
are also video taped and mailed to industries and
corporations around the United States.
SITN, a program started 25 years ago, was originally
designed to develop a good relationship between
various industries and the University. Graduate
courses in numerous science-related fields, from
electrical engineering to computer science to physics
are televised as part of the program to corporations
such as Hewlett-Packard and the International Busi
ness Machines Corporation (IBM).
Delivery
Couriers pick up handouts and reading material at
professors' offices here and take them to the industry
classrooms for use by students there. The courses are
not specially designed for SITN. Rather, when an
industry request is made to a professor here to lec
ture "live," the professor goes to one of the televi
sion studios in Terman Engineering Center and deliv
ers the lecture. Students enrolled in the course here
attend class as usual. The lecture is then televised and
seen live in the industry classroom.
Certainly, "teaching through TV" is a different type

of experience than lecturing for a regular University
course. David Luenberger, professor of engineering
economic systems, said, "I can reach people out
there who wouldn't be able to take the classes other
wise." Luenberger said he thinks the program, has
"great potential."
Prof. Bernard Widrow, who teaches a course in
electrical engineering, said that, while at first lectur
ing to a television camera "seemed strange, it just
takes some adapting to. In addition, it was a step we
really needed to take. The long-term implications
were such that we needed to try out this type of
program."
Technicians
The television cameras are run almost exclusively
by undergraduate students here. Technical directors
(TDs), as the camera operators are called, learn their
craft by watching an experienced technical director
one or two times. After operating the cameras once
under observation, the TDs are on their own.
"We try to make the program enjoyable for those
out there in TV land," senior Diane Reedy said.
Senior Jay Roach, who majors in communications
and economics, said that a TD must deal with several
specific and unique problems. "The most basic
screw-ups occur because you don't have enough
hands," to manipulate the camera into innovative
positions for non-standard coverage of a lecture.
"In addition, it can be very intimidating to run
those cameras. Thereare tons of buttons and needles
all over the place, and you realize that you're all alone
in there." Once the basic techniques are mastered,
however, a TD may experiment with various creative
additions to the television coverage.
Classes are televised 12 hours a day over four chan
nels, all of which are used regularly, Allen said. Stu
dents in the industry-based classrooms take exams
and receive grades, like students here. Televising
classes is relatively inexpensive so only two or three
students need to show interest for a class to be tele
vised. This quarter, 1300 students from 55 Bay Area
industries are enrolled in the SITN program.
Expenses
Operating expenses total $200,000 annually. Re
venue accrues from fees charged to the industries

using the program. Industry students also pay tuition
fees to the University.
Industry students can enroll in any of three diffe
rent SITN programs. Students working for a masters
degree in a given field enroll in the Honors Coopera
tive Program (HCP). The non-registered option
(NRO) is available to students who have not yet been
admitted to the University graduate program of their
choice, but wish to continue their studies beyond a
bachelor's degree education. Students in this group
receive class handouts, complete homework assign
ments, take exams and are graded, as are HCP stu
dents. Finally, students in industries outside the Uni
versity may audit classes.
Despite the apparent success of the program, in
ductry students who view the televised classes have
complaints.
"Psychologically-speaking, the classroom struc
ture isn't there. Atmosphere can really make a differ
ence," |im Thallman, an employee of Hewlett-
Packard, said.
Another student in the program, Nancy
Schweigert, said the delay getting homework as
signments returned to industry students has "defi
nitely made the program less beneficial than a clas
sroom situation."
On the other hand, students agree that the prog
ram is "quite convenient. I could never have gone
through school without it."
Innovations
Professors here have conceived possible im
provements to the program. Leunberger said that
video taped lectures might be played for students in
the industrial classrooms. A teaching assistant would
be present foreach lecture to answer questions. Wid
row foresees a nationwide network system that
would operate between universities. "In this way,
students could take courses from people who are the
best in their business.
The SITN staff is comprised of approximately 10
people, excluding the TDs. Allen determines the cur
riculum each quarter, hires camera operators and
acts as a. liaison between faculty here and students
from the various industries.

Sharp tuning adjustments can be made by the student who runs the master c ontrols. "Signals" are sent to
a "disc" atop Black Mountain near Foothill College, that receives microwave signals and relays the
televised program to industry classrooms.
"Does anyone have questions?" a professor asks.
There is silence in the lecture hall here. None of the
students has a question. Then, a student miles away
asks a question. Other students in classrooms around
the Bay Area hear the question. Students here listen
to the question. The professor proceeds to answer.
This type of communication is possible through a
program here that uses television as a teaching
medium.
