# Alpha Phi Omega redesigns ride board
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Seven hammer-laden mem
bers of the Stanford chapter of
the Alpha Phi Omega (APO),
service fraternity renovated
their Tresidder ride board
Monday night.
Located on the wall adjacent
to Sequoia Travel Agency in the
main lobby of Tresidder, the
ride board serves as a method
of communication between
prospective automobile
travelers. Especially with the
approach of the Thanksgiving
and Christmas holidays, APO
members hope to make stu
dents more aware of a poten
tially valuable resource, ac
cording to APO member Char
lie Parker.
The former ride board was
constructed two years ago after
remodeling work done on
Sequoia Travel Center had de
stroyed the original plywood
model. To replace that ride
board, then-President Russ Rit
ter mounted a regionally
divided map of the United
States behind plexiglass. Using
that board, passengers and
drivers with similar destina
tions contacted each other via
index cards in geographically
labelled cubby-holes near the
map.
But after problems including
card abuse and general de
terioration, APO members de

cided to revamp the ride
board.
Monday's reconstruction
was designed to create a more
"professional-looking" dis
play, said APO secretary Jim
Laßelle.
A shelf, supplied with bin
ders and color-coded, printed
cards, was built to replace the
obsolete cubby-holes. APO is
also testing a new map — now
divided according to major in
terstate routes, to help facili
tate rider/driver connections.
APO members will check
card provisions and out-dated
backlogs weekly. In the past,
this averaged about 30 cards
each month. In an effort to in
crease this total, APO mem
bers are planning a publicity
campaign of distributing
printed tliers to residence din
ing rooms through November.
Boy Scout origin
Alpha Phi Omega is a na
tional fraternity, which was es
tablished as an outshoot of the
Boy Scouts of America prog
ram during the latter part of the
nineteenth century. The group
has since expanded to include
active offices on university
campuses throughout the
country, Parker said.
Although the national entity
functions in much the same
manner as the more familiar
social fraternity, APO is a vol
unteer organization whose
members work for community
service and charitable projects.
APO strives to form a cohe
sive unit working in "service
for each other, the nation, and
the community," Parker ad
ded.
The Zeta chapter, estab
lished here 51 years ago, now
describes itself as a "loose"
and "open" co-ed structure.

After a peak in membership
about two years ago, most of
the work this year is done by a
core group of 10 juniors and
seniors.
Pet projects
To obtain a further sense of
responsibility and commit
ment, each member has cho
sen a "pet project," said )ohn
Lau, APO president.
For example, Parker now
leads the group's Red Cross
blood drive events. Before the
advent of on-campus blood
mobiles, APO members drove
shuttle buses on Saturday
mornings between Stanford
and the Red Cross headquar
ters in Palo Alto.
About five years ago, APO

members sponsored the first
bloodmobiles to come on
campus. Following a
Stanford-USC blood donation
race, more than 45 blood
mobiles have come to campus
annually for the past three
years.
The APO group has been in
strumental in this expansion,
and remains a recruiting liaison
fora blood driveeach month at
Tresidder, Parker said.
Packet stuffing
At the beginning of every
quarter, APO mails question
naires to local committees who
wish to communicate with the
student population, and then
uses the information to direct
registration packet stuffing.

This autumn APO supervised
60 people compiling 10,000
packets.
Earlier this quarter, mem
bers helped distribute litera
ture at the bike fair held at Tre
sidder. APO also plans to par
ticipate in the next bike inspec
tion, depending upon the
Stanford police getting new
licenses and registration tags.
APO will soon deliver
SWOPSI information to dor
mitories in an effort started by
one of their sponsors, Laura
Celznic, director of under
graduate special programs.
Other future plans include a
variety of fundraisers to benefit
charity organizations.
