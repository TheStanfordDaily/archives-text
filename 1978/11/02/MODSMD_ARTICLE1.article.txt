# Workers claim safety checks too rare at SLAC project site

### TONY RUPERT 
A controversy has erupted over
worker safety at the construction site
of the new Positron-Electron Project
(PEP) at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
Bob Gilmore, business manager of
the San Mateo Building and Con
struction Trades Council, said that he
and his safety consultant visited the
site Oct. 17 in response to several
worker complaints over safety.
Gilmore said that he began receiv
ing complaints last summer but his
inspection was prompted by a work
er's complaint Sept. 28.
"We found some of the same
safety problems that exist on any
job," Gilmore said. "There are no
specific violations out there that con
stitute a major safety problem. The
real problem is the procedure by
which safety is policed."
Gilmore explained that Stanford
and UC-Berkeley signed a contract
with the Department of Energy
(DOE) to build the $78 million PEP
project. "The problem," Gilmore
said, "is that since DOE is a party to
the contract, the state and federal
Occupational Safety and Health Ad
ministration (OSHA) lost jurisdiction
over safety and DOE acquired it."
Gilmore said DOE had approxi
mately the same safety standards as
OSHA but did not have the same en
forcement powers.
"DOE does not have the crucial
power to fine violators," he said.
"They can only threaten to break the
contract. This simply does not create
enough incentive to be in com
pliance.
"The solution," Gilmore said, "is
for DOE to either acquire the power
to fine or else give up safety jurisdic
tion to OSHA. In the meantime DOE
officials have assured us they will
step up their inspections, and the
subcontracting firm on the job, the
Fred ). Early Co., has agreed to ex
pand use of labor stewards (to report
safety violations)."
Alan Carrico, safety engineer at
DOE disagreed with Gilmore. "Fines

will get nothing done any quicker,"
he said. "We already require that
they meet rules that are tougher than
OSHA's. If they don't meet these
rules, we can break the contract."
When asked what he thought of
OSHA assuming responsibility for
safety conditions on the job, Carrico
replied, "With their backlog of cases,
I'd like to know how often they'd get
out there. Every five years? Right
now, I get out there every week or
two."
The safety controversy flared up
Sept. 28 when Arnold Poole, an Early
employee, injured his back while
operating a mucker (a tractor used to
extract mud and water) in the tunnel.

Last week, Poole's doctor, Frank
Ruys, told him that one of Poole's
discs had become worn down and
had begun to pinch a nerve. Dr. Ruys
also told him that the injury had de
veloped over several years and could
only have been worsened marginally
Sept. 28.
Poole admitted having had back
trouble in the past t?ut said he still
maintains his allegations of other
safety violations at PEP.
DOE safety engineer Carrico said
that Poole called him Sept. 28 and
claimed there were safety violations
at the PEP worksite. Carrico said he
asked Poole to submit a written list of
them but "he (Poole) hung up."
