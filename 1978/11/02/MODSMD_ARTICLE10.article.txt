# Editor's perspective
## Communications gap 
### 
Too many times we at the Daily are
asked why a particular event was not
reported in our pages. Quite often
the answer is a lack of communica
tions between the sponsoring group
and us.
A classic example: Last year a dorm
producing a play called the Daily the
night before curtain time asking for a
same day review. Poor planning, to
say the least, as we were unable to
assign a reviewer that late. The Daily
should have been called at the
minimum one week earlier.
To help solve this continual prob
lem of poor communications, The
Stanford Daily and KZSU are sponsor
ing a publicity workshop next Wed
nesday from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Meyer
Forum Room. This workshop is open
to all campus organizations, depart
ments and living groups, and I hope
all attempt to send representatives.
We hope to overcome this com
munications gap by exchanging ideas
on how campus organizations can
best communicate with us. And a
publicity workshop is the logical step
toward successfully reaching out to
the Stanford community.
The Daily and KZSU offer com

plementary publicity services. At the
workshop, we will each offer a half
hour presentation on our respective
needs and services, including news
policies, deadlines and effective ways
of expressing your ideas.
Before closing, the workshop will
be opened to feedback, questions
and suggestions. Tom Price, KZSU
station manager, and I also plan on
introducing a few members of our
staff.
We would hope that after attending
the workshop, representatives of or
ganizations can return to their re
spective groups with a better idea of
how we operate, as well as the ser
vices we can best offer each other.
This forum will be beneficial to the
whole Stanford campus. We all have
the same goal of reaching the com
munity, and the better the media and
campus groups work together, the
easier that goal becomes attainable.
If you think your organization
would benefit by this workshop, or if
you are just interested in learning
more about KZSU and the Daily, I
hope to see you next Wednesday.
