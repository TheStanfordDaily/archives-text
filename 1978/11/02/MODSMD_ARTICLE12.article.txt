## Proposition 5 goes too far 
### 
Californians are once again faced with
the quandary of voting on an initiative
which seeks to remedy a major problem,
but which goes too far. That initiative is
Proposition 5, the "Clean Air Act of 1978."
The rights of non-smokers have cor
rectly been receiving increasing publicity
and interest over the years. Organizations
such as the Croup Against Smoking Pollu
tion (GASP) have been growing, and have
hadan increasing impact on governmental
policy. Proposition 5 marks the apex of the
efforts for non-smokers' rights in Califor
nia, and perhaps the nation.
The concern of these groups is justified.
At the very least, smoking causes major
discomfort to many non-smokers. Furth
ermore, smoking does not simply en
danger the smoker — who has the right to
kill him or herself. Unfortunately, it also
endangers non-smokers who inhale the
smoke. In fact, there is some evidence that
the smoke inhaled by by-standers is more
dangerous than that inhaled by the
smoker.
The proposed solution to the problem is
Proposition 5, which would outlaw smok
ing in any enclosed public place, place of
employment, educational facility, health
facility, and clinic.
Proposition 5 then provides for a sig
nificant number of exceptions to the gen
eral prohibition, including bars, retail to
bacco stores, hotel and motel rooms, pri
vate hospital rooms, gambling halls, dor
mitory rooms, and taxicabs. Some other
exceptions are provided if not more than
half of the area is designated for smokers,
such as lobbies, waiting areas, student and
employee lounges, and railroad sleeping
cars.

Finally, the most controversial excep
tion involves "an arena, auditorium, or
theater when used for a rock concert, a
professional boxing contest, a profes
sional wrestling exhibition, or a profes
sional roller derby . . .
Proposition 5 further provides that re
staurants establish nonsmoking sections,
and that no smoking signs (the size of
which is specifically regulated) would have
to be placed wherever smoking is prohi
bited. Finally, violators of the law would be
punished by a $50 fine.
Unfortunately, the cure is worse than
the disease. Though it is rather distasteful
to side with the tobacco companies, who
are throwing millions of dollars into the
campaign (and are buying obnoxious and
peurile commercials), Proposition 5
should be defeated.
First, it contains some bothersome in
consistencies. Rock concerts are exempt
because the law would be "difficult to en
force." Though rock concerts may be the
toughest to control, difficulty of enforce
ment plagues jazz concerts, country and
western concerts — and the entire initia
tive. Further, professional, but not
amateur, boxing, wrestling, and roller
derby events are exempted; this simply
makes no sense.
Second, the measure will be expensive
to operate. Signs are mandated through
out California, partitions or walls will have
to be built, etc. This will cost consumers,
and might increase unemployment some.
Finally, the initiative increases the
monumental government regulation of
our private lives. The pervasiveness of the

proposed government control is illus
trated by what the initiative must specifi
cally exempt: private offices, taxicabs, and
semi-private hospital rooms (though only
if both patients have requested, in writing,
to be placed in a smoking room). If the
initiative merely dealt with government
facilities (truly "public" areas), rather than
private activities, it would deserve sup
port. Unfortunately, it goes way too far.
Smoking in semi-private rooms would
require written consent. Restaurants
would have to set up different sections. All
businesses that aren't exempted would
have to put up signs. Smoking would be
outlawed at most every place of employ
ment and at educational faciliteis.
We just can't afford more government
regulation — particularly when it would be
this übiquitous. Rather, private businesses
should remain subject to pressure from
consumers and employees. The individual
business could then balance the compet
ing interests and come up with the best
solution for its own individual situation,
rather than being subject to arbitrary and
inefficient government requirements. In
fact, many companies have already dealt
with this problem through a variety of
measures, including outright prohibition,
designated smoking areas, and non
smoking incentive programs. The variety
of private situations need a variety of pri
vate solutions.
As a non-smoker who is irritated by
cigarette and cigar smoke, I sympathize
with the objectives of the initiative; how
ever, it is expensive overkill and should be
defeated.
