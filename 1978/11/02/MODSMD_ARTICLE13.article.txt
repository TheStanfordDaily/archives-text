Individual
Responsibility
I would like to respond to
Steve Barton's discussion
"McCloskey plan distressing"
printed in the Oct. 26 issue of
the Daily. It seems to me he
quite artfully avoided the ques
tion of individual responsibility
in a real world.
The presence of nuclear
power negates the obligation of
continuing to strive towards vi
able institutions. T he U.S.
must maintain some type of
military force for some time.
The only issue is "What kind?"
Switzerland, perhaps the
most impregnable country in
the world in terms of geog
raphic location, maintains a

mandatory draft. Apparently
the Swiss believe it is necessary
to preserve a backbone of an
alert, intelligent, concerned
and trained citizenry, even
though the possibility of their
active service is remote.
U.S. law declares 18-year-old
men and women are suffi
ciently mature to participate in
the electoral process â€” to have
a voice in determining the laws
they will live by. Are they also
willing to assume a furtiier re
sponsibility by contributing a
minute portion of their lives
towards the security of the land
in which these laws obtain?
Perhaps the value of such indi
vidual affirmations goes
beyond the act itself, towards
the spiritual strength of our
country.

An older generation, which
has lived through war, now
most earnestly seeks peace,
and could hope for the assur
ance of these on-going values
in the operable convictions of
the young.
Has "patriotism" become a
bad word?

Don't use us
for a mascot
In response to Leslie Hee
ter's letter (Daily, Oct. 27) and
to answer all others who might
confuse "Irishmen, Trojans,
Spartans, not to mention Cow
boys," with racial groups, I
would like to make the follow
ing points. The very reason that
we as Indian people oppose
the use of our name and our
heritages as a rallying point
behind which wealthy white
alumni and students can gather
is that these people seem to
forget that we are still here.
We have not gone the way of
the dinosaur as have the Spar
tans and Trojans. Nor have we
chosen to be Indians as a
career or occupation. As for
the Irish, if they don't object to
the use of their name as a mas
cot, then fine. Perhaps they
don't feel, as Indian peopledo,
that their rights as members of
this society are in jeopardy. Or
perhaps more simply, they
don't identify as a group as
strongly as Indian people do.
But whatever the reason, it is
apparently up to the Irish to
decide whether the label of
their nationality be used for re
creational rallying.
Whatever the purported be
nevolent intentions behind the
use of our name, we are sick of
the insensitivity to our cultures
(the dances, music and cos
tumes) that is currently being
displayed on Saturday after
noons. I would remind non-
Indian people that most Indian
nations still practice their tradi
tional dances and ceremonies
despite over 400 years of mis
sionary, military, and govern

ment activity to abolish them.
We are not relics of a by
gone era. We are still here, be
lieve it or not. And we are here
at Stanford to gain the experi
ence and skills we believe are
necessary to help our people
back home. There, people are
struggling to keep their land,
their water, and fishing rights,
among others promised us in
over 400 treaties with the Un
ited States that are currently
being threatened in Congress
and other political arenas.
We have more important
things to do than to have to
seasonally defend our rights to
be a proud and present, but
still struggling people. If the
Stanford community is in such
need of "something to emu
late" and gets no satisfaction
from Cardinals, then I would
suggest that a name is chosen
that reflects a common charac
teristic from among those who
feel this need. I will refrain
from carrying my point further.
I merely would like to see
this damned issue laid to rest
for once and for all. The fact
that we take multi-lateral of
fense should be enough. Ap
parently it isn't. We have heard
all the pro-Indian mascot ar
guments and have found them
unacceptable, thank you.
Please, please find an animal or
an occupation or some extra
terrestrial entity to emulate,
but please leave us alone.

Fonda given
too much coverage
Although I fear to encourage
press news censorship, the
amount of coverage the Daily
gave to the views expressed by
)ane Fonda in your Thursday
edition was distressing. The
fact that she was on campus
may have been newsworthy,
but the views themselves are
not. They were a staggering
collection of half truths, blat
ant falsehoods and general dis

tortion of fact by misplacing
emphasis.
I for one was surprised to
learn about the tremendously
high current unemployment
levels and that unemployment
would be 15-25 percent by the
time I graduated. Employment
as a percent of working age
population is at an all time high
and help wanted advertising is
at near record levels. There are
certainly unemployment prob
lems among disadvantaged
youth and in certain areas, but
this does not prove the system
is a failure.
Regarding big business
domination of the economy,
although big government is
making it more difficult for
small business to thrive, big
business has not substantially
increased its GNP domination
for 50 years.
Finally, she seems to be de
void of solutions to even the
problems which she claims.
Solar energy may be wonder
ful, and advocating women,
worker and youth activism is
cute, but these are hardly solu
tions to even vaguely defined
problems. I would have hoped
that this sort of vacuous
radical-liberal ranting about
big business would have been
worth less than half a page of
the Daily.

Blame lies
within society
David Miller (Daily, Oct. 25)
argues, "Nor is it right to attri
bute a person's crime to soci
ety or to his environment
rather than considering the
person himself. To attribute
crime to poverty or racism not
only betrays an ignorance of
the historical evidence to the
contrary, but it is also an insult
to an overwhelming number of
poor and minorities." Com
ments like these serve only to
perpetuate the myth that social
problems are caused by a class
of deviants. This distorted view

leads one to attribute un
employment to a group of
people who do not want to
work, poverty to those who re
fuse to engage in hard work,
and crime to those who are in
herently evil.
Social problems arise from
and have their roots within the
structure of society; they can
not be explained by "consider
ing the person himself." Thus,
when analyzing the phenome
non of crime, the focus of
study must draw away from the
"deviant" individual, and
center on the society which
carries racist attitudes and
promotes economic inequal
ity. The longer we look at the
deviant as the source of
societal ills, the farther we are
from solving our problems.

Give us
more credit
Tim Davis chides young
people in general for their
"sheepish liberalism," claim
ing as an example that they
"scurry quickly" to the au
tomatic and unthinking de
fense of liberal values against
the Briggs initiative, and imply
ing that a thoughtful analysis
unimpeded by cliches and
platitudes would reveal the
beneficent character of Prop
osition 6 (Daily, Oct. 25). I am
neither sheepish nor far-fringe
liberal, and my scurrying is
rather clumsy and oafish.
Nevertheless, I disagree with
Davis' position regarding the
initiative.
Davis states that the issue "is
not whether homosexuals will
or will not be free." When a
competent teacher can be fired
because of criteria totally unre
lated to his academic comep
tence, his freedom is jeopar
dized. Sexual preference is as
valid a standard in this regard
as race or religion. He con
tinues by saying that "the vast
majority of society should be
able to determine the ethics of
the society." "Ethics" implies

the existence of free choice,
and homosexuals choose to be
gay as much as Negroes
choose to be black or short
people choose to lack physical
stature. "Ethics" is not an is
sue. Davis goes on, "Being
able to prevent our children
from being introduced to away
of life with which we disagree
should be a basic tenet of the
'freedom' of the majority."
Sexual preference is estab
lished in a child long before a
"role model" in the classroom
can possibly have any effect.
The present laws against child
molestation are adequate. Be
sides, most homosexuals are
born of and raised by
heterosexual parents, which
raises the interesting question
of whether Sen. Briggs is cor
rect in choosing the schools as
his target.
My opposition to Proposi
tion 6 is not the product of a
mind "enslaved" or stam
peded into a liberal-led,
"follow-the-leader" approach
to political decisions, as Davis
seems to believe, and I doubt
that many others have decided
on the issue without consider
ing it seriously. I realize that my
arguments against the Briggs
initiative are subject to much
dispute. However, Davis sup
poses that those of us, espe
cially those of us in college,
who happen to disagree with
him do so because of an inabil
ity to make our own decisions.
He should give us more credit.

In response to Leslie Hee
ter's letter (Daily, Oct. 27) and
to answer all others who might
confuse "Irishmen, Trojans,
Spartans, not to mention Cow
boys," with racial groups, I
would like to make the follow
ing points. The very reason that
we as Indian people oppose
the use of our name and our
heritages as a rallying point
behind which wealthy white
alumni and students can gather
is that these people seem to
forget that we are still here.
We have not gone the way of
the dinosaur as have the Spar
tans and Trojans. Nor have we
chosen to be Indians as a
career or occupation. As for
the Irish, if they don't object to
the use of their name as a mas
cot, then fine. Perhaps they
don't feel, as Indian peopledo,
that their rights as members of
this society are in jeopardy. Or
perhaps more simply, they
don't identify as a group as
strongly as Indian people do.
But whatever the reason, it is
apparently up to the Irish to
decide whether the label of
their nationality be used for re
creational rallying.
Whatever the purported be
nevolent intentions behind the
use of our name, we are sick of
the insensitivity to our cultures
(the dances, music and cos
tumes) that is currently being
displayed on Saturday after
noons. I would remind non-
Indian people that most Indian
nations still practice their tradi
tional dances and ceremonies
despite over 400 years of mis
sionary, military, and govern

ment activity to abolish them.
We are not relics of a by
gone era. We are still here, be
lieve it or not. And we are here
at Stanford to gain the experi
ence and skills we believe are
necessary to help our people
back home. There, people are
struggling to keep their land,
their water, and fishing rights,
among others promised us in
over 400 treaties with the Un
ited States that are currently
being threatened in Congress
and other political arenas.
We have more important
things to do than to have to
seasonally defend our rights to
be a proud and present, but
still struggling people. If the
Stanford community is in such
need of "something to emu
late" and gets no satisfaction
from Cardinals, then I would
suggest that a name is chosen
that reflects a common charac
teristic from among those who
feel this need. I will refrain
from carrying my point further.
I merely would like to see
this damned issue laid to rest
for once and for all. The fact
that we take multi-lateral of
fense should be enough. Ap
parently it isn't. We have heard
all the pro-Indian mascot ar
guments and have found them
unacceptable, thank you.
Please, please find an animal or
an occupation or some extra
terrestrial entity to emulate,
but please leave us alone.

Fonda given
too much coverage
Although I fear to encourage
press news censorship, the
amount of coverage the Daily
gave to the views expressed by
)ane Fonda in your Thursday
edition was distressing. The
fact that she was on campus
may have been newsworthy,
but the views themselves are
not. They were a staggering
collection of half truths, blat
ant falsehoods and general dis

tortion of fact by misplacing
emphasis.
I for one was surprised to
learn about the tremendously
high current unemployment
levels and that unemployment
would be 15-25 percent by the
time I graduated. Employment
as a percent of working age
population is at an all time high
and help wanted advertising is
at near record levels. There are
certainly unemployment prob
lems among disadvantaged
youth and in certain areas, but
this does not prove the system
is a failure.
Regarding big business
domination of the economy,
although big government is
making it more difficult for
small business to thrive, big
business has not substantially
increased its GNP domination
for 50 years.
Finally, she seems to be de
void of solutions to even the
problems which she claims.
Solar energy may be wonder
ful, and advocating women,
worker and youth activism is
cute, but these are hardly solu
tions to even vaguely defined
problems. I would have hoped
that this sort of vacuous
radical-liberal ranting about
big business would have been
worth less than half a page of
the Daily.

Blame lies
within society
David Miller (Daily, Oct. 25)
argues, "Nor is it right to attri
bute a person's crime to soci
ety or to his environment
rather than considering the
person himself. To attribute
crime to poverty or racism not
only betrays an ignorance of
the historical evidence to the
contrary, but it is also an insult
to an overwhelming number of
poor and minorities." Com
ments like these serve only to
perpetuate the myth that social
problems are caused by a class
of deviants. This distorted view

leads one to attribute un
employment to a group of
people who do not want to
work, poverty to those who re
fuse to engage in hard work,
and crime to those who are in
herently evil.
Social problems arise from
and have their roots within the
structure of society; they can
not be explained by "consider
ing the person himself." Thus,
when analyzing the phenome
non of crime, the focus of
study must draw away from the
"deviant" individual, and
center on the society which
carries racist attitudes and
promotes economic inequal
ity. The longer we look at the
deviant as the source of
societal ills, the farther we are
from solving our problems.

Give us
more credit
Tim Davis chides young
people in general for their
"sheepish liberalism," claim
ing as an example that they
"scurry quickly" to the au
tomatic and unthinking de
fense of liberal values against
the Briggs initiative, and imply
ing that a thoughtful analysis
unimpeded by cliches and
platitudes would reveal the
beneficent character of Prop
osition 6 (Daily, Oct. 25). I am
neither sheepish nor far-fringe
liberal, and my scurrying is
rather clumsy and oafish.
Nevertheless, I disagree with
Davis' position regarding the
initiative.
Davis states that the issue "is
not whether homosexuals will
or will not be free." When a
competent teacher can be fired
because of criteria totally unre
lated to his academic comep
tence, his freedom is jeopar
dized. Sexual preference is as
valid a standard in this regard
as race or religion. He con
tinues by saying that "the vast
majority of society should be
able to determine the ethics of
the society." "Ethics" implies

the existence of free choice,
and homosexuals choose to be
gay as much as Negroes
choose to be black or short
people choose to lack physical
stature. "Ethics" is not an is
sue. Davis goes on, "Being
able to prevent our children
from being introduced to away
of life with which we disagree
should be a basic tenet of the
'freedom' of the majority."
Sexual preference is estab
lished in a child long before a
"role model" in the classroom
can possibly have any effect.
The present laws against child
molestation are adequate. Be
sides, most homosexuals are
born of and raised by
heterosexual parents, which
raises the interesting question
of whether Sen. Briggs is cor
rect in choosing the schools as
his target.
My opposition to Proposi
tion 6 is not the product of a
mind "enslaved" or stam
peded into a liberal-led,
"follow-the-leader" approach
to political decisions, as Davis
seems to believe, and I doubt
that many others have decided
on the issue without consider
ing it seriously. I realize that my
arguments against the Briggs
initiative are subject to much
dispute. However, Davis sup
poses that those of us, espe
cially those of us in college,
who happen to disagree with
him do so because of an inabil
ity to make our own decisions.
He should give us more credit.

Responsibility
I would like to respond to
Steve Barton's discussion
"McCloskey plan distressing"
printed in the Oct. 26 issue of
the Daily. It seems to me he
quite artfully avoided the ques
tion of individual responsibility
in a real world.
The presence of nuclear
power negates the obligation of
continuing to strive towards vi
able institutions. T he U.S.
must maintain some type of
military force for some time.
The only issue is "What kind?"
Switzerland, perhaps the
most impregnable country in
the world in terms of geog
raphic location, maintains a

mandatory draft. Apparently
the Swiss believe it is necessary
to preserve a backbone of an
alert, intelligent, concerned
and trained citizenry, even
though the possibility of their
active service is remote.
U.S. law declares 18-year-old
men and women are suffi
ciently mature to participate in
the electoral process â€” to have
a voice in determining the laws
they will live by. Are they also
willing to assume a furtiier re
sponsibility by contributing a
minute portion of their lives
towards the security of the land
in which these laws obtain?
Perhaps the value of such indi
vidual affirmations goes
beyond the act itself, towards
the spiritual strength of our
country.

An older generation, which
has lived through war, now
most earnestly seeks peace,
and could hope for the assur
ance of these on-going values
in the operable convictions of
the young.
Has "patriotism" become a
bad word?

Fonda given
too much coverage
Although I fear to encourage
press news censorship, the
amount of coverage the Daily
gave to the views expressed by
)ane Fonda in your Thursday
edition was distressing. The
fact that she was on campus
may have been newsworthy,
but the views themselves are
not. They were a staggering
collection of half truths, blat
ant falsehoods and general dis

tortion of fact by misplacing
emphasis.
I for one was surprised to
learn about the tremendously
high current unemployment
levels and that unemployment
would be 15-25 percent by the
time I graduated. Employment
as a percent of working age
population is at an all time high
and help wanted advertising is
at near record levels. There are
certainly unemployment prob
lems among disadvantaged
youth and in certain areas, but
this does not prove the system
is a failure.
Regarding big business
domination of the economy,
although big government is
making it more difficult for
small business to thrive, big
business has not substantially
increased its GNP domination
for 50 years.
Finally, she seems to be de
void of solutions to even the
problems which she claims.
Solar energy may be wonder
ful, and advocating women,
worker and youth activism is
cute, but these are hardly solu
tions to even vaguely defined
problems. I would have hoped
that this sort of vacuous
radical-liberal ranting about
big business would have been
worth less than half a page of
the Daily.

Blame lies
within society
David Miller (Daily, Oct. 25)
argues, "Nor is it right to attri
bute a person's crime to soci
ety or to his environment
rather than considering the
person himself. To attribute
crime to poverty or racism not
only betrays an ignorance of
the historical evidence to the
contrary, but it is also an insult
to an overwhelming number of
poor and minorities." Com
ments like these serve only to
perpetuate the myth that social
problems are caused by a class
of deviants. This distorted view

leads one to attribute un
employment to a group of
people who do not want to
work, poverty to those who re
fuse to engage in hard work,
and crime to those who are in
herently evil.
Social problems arise from
and have their roots within the
structure of society; they can
not be explained by "consider
ing the person himself." Thus,
when analyzing the phenome
non of crime, the focus of
study must draw away from the
"deviant" individual, and
center on the society which
carries racist attitudes and
promotes economic inequal
ity. The longer we look at the
deviant as the source of
societal ills, the farther we are
from solving our problems.

Give us
more credit
Tim Davis chides young
people in general for their
"sheepish liberalism," claim
ing as an example that they
"scurry quickly" to the au
tomatic and unthinking de
fense of liberal values against
the Briggs initiative, and imply
ing that a thoughtful analysis
unimpeded by cliches and
platitudes would reveal the
beneficent character of Prop
osition 6 (Daily, Oct. 25). I am
neither sheepish nor far-fringe
liberal, and my scurrying is
rather clumsy and oafish.
Nevertheless, I disagree with
Davis' position regarding the
initiative.
Davis states that the issue "is
not whether homosexuals will
or will not be free." When a
competent teacher can be fired
because of criteria totally unre
lated to his academic comep
tence, his freedom is jeopar
dized. Sexual preference is as
valid a standard in this regard
as race or religion. He con
tinues by saying that "the vast
majority of society should be
able to determine the ethics of
the society." "Ethics" implies

the existence of free choice,
and homosexuals choose to be
gay as much as Negroes
choose to be black or short
people choose to lack physical
stature. "Ethics" is not an is
sue. Davis goes on, "Being
able to prevent our children
from being introduced to away
of life with which we disagree
should be a basic tenet of the
'freedom' of the majority."
Sexual preference is estab
lished in a child long before a
"role model" in the classroom
can possibly have any effect.
The present laws against child
molestation are adequate. Be
sides, most homosexuals are
born of and raised by
heterosexual parents, which
raises the interesting question
of whether Sen. Briggs is cor
rect in choosing the schools as
his target.
My opposition to Proposi
tion 6 is not the product of a
mind "enslaved" or stam
peded into a liberal-led,
"follow-the-leader" approach
to political decisions, as Davis
seems to believe, and I doubt
that many others have decided
on the issue without consider
ing it seriously. I realize that my
arguments against the Briggs
initiative are subject to much
dispute. However, Davis sup
poses that those of us, espe
cially those of us in college,
who happen to disagree with
him do so because of an inabil
ity to make our own decisions.
He should give us more credit.

I would like to respond to
Steve Barton's discussion
"McCloskey plan distressing"
printed in the Oct. 26 issue of
the Daily. It seems to me he
quite artfully avoided the ques
tion of individual responsibility
in a real world.
The presence of nuclear
power negates the obligation of
continuing to strive towards vi
able institutions. T he U.S.
must maintain some type of
military force for some time.
The only issue is "What kind?"
Switzerland, perhaps the
most impregnable country in
the world in terms of geog
raphic location, maintains a

mandatory draft. Apparently
the Swiss believe it is necessary
to preserve a backbone of an
alert, intelligent, concerned
and trained citizenry, even
though the possibility of their
active service is remote.
U.S. law declares 18-year-old
men and women are suffi
ciently mature to participate in
the electoral process â€” to have
a voice in determining the laws
they will live by. Are they also
willing to assume a furtiier re
sponsibility by contributing a
minute portion of their lives
towards the security of the land
in which these laws obtain?
Perhaps the value of such indi
vidual affirmations goes
beyond the act itself, towards
the spiritual strength of our
country.

An older generation, which
has lived through war, now
most earnestly seeks peace,
and could hope for the assur
ance of these on-going values
in the operable convictions of
the young.
Has "patriotism" become a

Don't use us
for a mascot
In response to Leslie Hee
ter's letter (Daily, Oct. 27) and
to answer all others who might
confuse "Irishmen, Trojans,
Spartans, not to mention Cow
boys," with racial groups, I
would like to make the follow
ing points. The very reason that
we as Indian people oppose
the use of our name and our
heritages as a rallying point
behind which wealthy white
alumni and students can gather
is that these people seem to
forget that we are still here.
We have not gone the way of
the dinosaur as have the Spar
tans and Trojans. Nor have we
chosen to be Indians as a
career or occupation. As for
the Irish, if they don't object to
the use of their name as a mas
cot, then fine. Perhaps they
don't feel, as Indian peopledo,
that their rights as members of
this society are in jeopardy. Or
perhaps more simply, they
don't identify as a group as
strongly as Indian people do.
But whatever the reason, it is
apparently up to the Irish to
decide whether the label of
their nationality be used for re
creational rallying.
Whatever the purported be
nevolent intentions behind the
use of our name, we are sick of
the insensitivity to our cultures
(the dances, music and cos
tumes) that is currently being
displayed on Saturday after
noons. I would remind non-
Indian people that most Indian
nations still practice their tradi
tional dances and ceremonies
despite over 400 years of mis
sionary, military, and govern

ment activity to abolish them.
We are not relics of a by
gone era. We are still here, be
lieve it or not. And we are here

collection of half truths, blat
ant falsehoods and general dis

tortion of fact by misplacing
emphasis.
I for one was surprised to
learn about the tremendously
high current unemployment
levels and that unemployment
would be 15-25 percent by the
time I graduated. Employment
as a percent of working age
population is at an all time high
and help wanted advertising is
at near record levels. There are
certainly unemployment prob
lems among disadvantaged
youth and in certain areas, but
this does not prove the system
is a failure.
Regarding big business
domination of the economy,
although big government is
making it more difficult for
small business to thrive, big
business has not substantially
increased its GNP domination
for 50 years.
Finally, she seems to be de
void of solutions to even the
problems which she claims.
Solar energy may be wonder
ful, and advocating women,
worker and youth activism is
cute, but these are hardly solu
tions to even vaguely defined
problems. I would have hoped
that this sort of vacuous
radical-liberal ranting about
big business would have been
worth less than half a page of

Blame lies
within society
David Miller (Daily, Oct. 25)
argues, "Nor is it right to attri
bute a person's crime to soci
ety or to his environment
rather than considering the
person himself. To attribute
crime to poverty or racism not
only betrays an ignorance of
the historical evidence to the
contrary, but it is also an insult
to an overwhelming number of
poor and minorities." Com
ments like these serve only to
perpetuate the myth that social
problems are caused by a class
of deviants. This distorted view

leads one to attribute un
employment to a group of
people who do not want to
work, poverty to those who re
fuse to engage in hard work,
and crime to those who are in
herently evil.
Social problems arise from
and have their roots within the
structure of society; they can
not be explained by "consider
ing the person himself." Thus,
when analyzing the phenome
non of crime, the focus of
study must draw away from the
"deviant" individual, and
center on the society which
carries racist attitudes and
promotes economic inequal
ity. The longer we look at the
deviant as the source of
societal ills, the farther we are
from solving our problems.

Give us
more credit
Tim Davis chides young
people in general for their
"sheepish liberalism," claim
ing as an example that they
"scurry quickly" to the au
tomatic and unthinking de
fense of liberal values against
the Briggs initiative, and imply
ing that a thoughtful analysis
unimpeded by cliches and
platitudes would reveal the
beneficent character of Prop
osition 6 (Daily, Oct. 25). I am
neither sheepish nor far-fringe
liberal, and my scurrying is
rather clumsy and oafish.
Nevertheless, I disagree with
Davis' position regarding the
initiative.
Davis states that the issue "is
not whether homosexuals will
or will not be free." When a
competent teacher can be fired
because of criteria totally unre
lated to his academic comep
tence, his freedom is jeopar
dized. Sexual preference is as
valid a standard in this regard
as race or religion. He con
tinues by saying that "the vast
majority of society should be
able to determine the ethics of
the society." "Ethics" implies

the existence of free choice,
and homosexuals choose to be
gay as much as Negroes
choose to be black or short
people choose to lack physical
stature. "Ethics" is not an is
sue. Davis goes on, "Being
able to prevent our children
from being introduced to away
of life with which we disagree
should be a basic tenet of the
'freedom' of the majority."
Sexual preference is estab
lished in a child long before a
"role model" in the classroom
can possibly have any effect.
The present laws against child
molestation are adequate. Be
sides, most homosexuals are
born of and raised by
heterosexual parents, which
raises the interesting question
of whether Sen. Briggs is cor
rect in choosing the schools as
his target.
My opposition to Proposi
tion 6 is not the product of a
mind "enslaved" or stam
peded into a liberal-led,
"follow-the-leader" approach
to political decisions, as Davis
seems to believe, and I doubt
that many others have decided
on the issue without consider
ing it seriously. I realize that my
arguments against the Briggs
initiative are subject to much
dispute. However, Davis sup
poses that those of us, espe
cially those of us in college,
who happen to disagree with
him do so because of an inabil
ity to make our own decisions.
He should give us more credit.

I would like to respond to
Steve Barton's discussion
"McCloskey plan distressing"
printed in the Oct. 26 issue of
the Daily. It seems to me he
quite artfully avoided the ques
tion of individual responsibility
in a real world.
The presence of nuclear
power negates the obligation of
continuing to strive towards vi
able institutions. T he U.S.
must maintain some type of
military force for some time.
The only issue is "What kind?"
Switzerland, perhaps the
most impregnable country in
the world in terms of geog
raphic location, maintains a

mandatory draft. Apparently
the Swiss believe it is necessary
to preserve a backbone of an
alert, intelligent, concerned
and trained citizenry, even
though the possibility of their
active service is remote.
U.S. law declares 18-year-old
men and women are suffi
ciently mature to participate in
the electoral process â€” to have
a voice in determining the laws
they will live by. Are they also
willing to assume a furtiier re
sponsibility by contributing a
minute portion of their lives
towards the security of the land
in which these laws obtain?
Perhaps the value of such indi
vidual affirmations goes
beyond the act itself, towards
the spiritual strength of our
country.

An older generation, which
has lived through war, now
most earnestly seeks peace,
and could hope for the assur

in the operable convictions of
the young.

Don't use us
for a mascot
In response to Leslie Hee
ter's letter (Daily, Oct. 27) and
to answer all others who might
confuse "Irishmen, Trojans,
Spartans, not to mention Cow
boys," with racial groups, I
would like to make the follow
ing points. The very reason that
we as Indian people oppose
the use of our name and our
heritages as a rallying point
behind which wealthy white
alumni and students can gather
is that these people seem to
forget that we are still here.
We have not gone the way of
the dinosaur as have the Spar
tans and Trojans. Nor have we
chosen to be Indians as a
career or occupation. As for
the Irish, if they don't object to
the use of their name as a mas
cot, then fine. Perhaps they
don't feel, as Indian peopledo,
that their rights as members of
this society are in jeopardy. Or
perhaps more simply, they
don't identify as a group as
strongly as Indian people do.
But whatever the reason, it is
apparently up to the Irish to
decide whether the label of
their nationality be used for re
creational rallying.
Whatever the purported be
nevolent intentions behind the
use of our name, we are sick of
the insensitivity to our cultures
(the dances, music and cos
tumes) that is currently being
displayed on Saturday after
noons. I would remind non-
Indian people that most Indian
nations still practice their tradi
tional dances and ceremonies
despite over 400 years of mis
sionary, military, and govern

ment activity to abolish them.
We are not relics of a by
gone era. We are still here, be
lieve it or not. And we are here
at Stanford to gain the experi
ence and skills we believe are
necessary to help our people
back home. There, people are
struggling to keep their land,
their water, and fishing rights,
among others promised us in
over 400 treaties with the Un
ited States that are currently
being threatened in Congress
and other political arenas.
We have more important
things to do than to have to
seasonally defend our rights to
be a proud and present, but
still struggling people. If the
Stanford community is in such
need of "something to emu
late" and gets no satisfaction
from Cardinals, then I would
suggest that a name is chosen
that reflects a common charac
teristic from among those who
feel this need. I will refrain
from carrying my point further.
I merely would like to see
this damned issue laid to rest
for once and for all. The fact
that we take multi-lateral of
fense should be enough. Ap
parently it isn't. We have heard
all the pro-Indian mascot ar
guments and have found them
unacceptable, thank you.
Please, please find an animal or
an occupation or some extra
terrestrial entity to emulate,
but please leave us alone.

perpetuate the myth that social
problems are caused by a class
of deviants. This distorted view

leads one to attribute un
employment to a group of
people who do not want to
work, poverty to those who re
fuse to engage in hard work,
and crime to those who are in
herently evil.
Social problems arise from
and have their roots within the
structure of society; they can
not be explained by "consider
ing the person himself." Thus,
when analyzing the phenome
non of crime, the focus of
study must draw away from the
"deviant" individual, and
center on the society which
carries racist attitudes and
promotes economic inequal
ity. The longer we look at the
deviant as the source of
societal ills, the farther we are
from solving our problems.

Give us
more credit
Tim Davis chides young
people in general for their
"sheepish liberalism," claim
ing as an example that they
"scurry quickly" to the au
tomatic and unthinking de
fense of liberal values against
the Briggs initiative, and imply
ing that a thoughtful analysis
unimpeded by cliches and
platitudes would reveal the
beneficent character of Prop
osition 6 (Daily, Oct. 25). I am
neither sheepish nor far-fringe
liberal, and my scurrying is
rather clumsy and oafish.
Nevertheless, I disagree with
Davis' position regarding the
initiative.
Davis states that the issue "is
not whether homosexuals will
or will not be free." When a
competent teacher can be fired
because of criteria totally unre
lated to his academic comep
tence, his freedom is jeopar
dized. Sexual preference is as
valid a standard in this regard
as race or religion. He con
tinues by saying that "the vast
majority of society should be
able to determine the ethics of
the society." "Ethics" implies

the existence of free choice,
and homosexuals choose to be
gay as much as Negroes
choose to be black or short
people choose to lack physical
stature. "Ethics" is not an is
sue. Davis goes on, "Being
able to prevent our children
from being introduced to away
of life with which we disagree
should be a basic tenet of the
'freedom' of the majority."
Sexual preference is estab
lished in a child long before a
"role model" in the classroom
can possibly have any effect.
The present laws against child
molestation are adequate. Be
sides, most homosexuals are
born of and raised by
heterosexual parents, which
raises the interesting question
of whether Sen. Briggs is cor
rect in choosing the schools as
his target.
My opposition to Proposi
tion 6 is not the product of a
mind "enslaved" or stam
peded into a liberal-led,
"follow-the-leader" approach
to political decisions, as Davis
seems to believe, and I doubt
that many others have decided
on the issue without consider
ing it seriously. I realize that my
arguments against the Briggs
initiative are subject to much
dispute. However, Davis sup
poses that those of us, espe
cially those of us in college,
who happen to disagree with
him do so because of an inabil
ity to make our own decisions.
He should give us more credit.
