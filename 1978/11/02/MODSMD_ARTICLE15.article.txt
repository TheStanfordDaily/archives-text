## San Francisco's city inside a city 
### CLAIRE CHAMBERLAIN LOIS NESBITT 
San Francisco has always been a city wil
ling to set precedents. In the 1930s they
said no bridge could span the opening of
the Bay, but by the end of the decade Chief
Engineer Joseph Strauss had proved them
wrong. In 1939, construction on the Gol
den Gate Bridge was completed and the
impossible had become a reality.
Today, in the 19705, the challenge faeing
San Francisco is no longer one of en
gineering and technology alone. Instead,
the emphasis is on adapting the existing
resources to meet the demands of a chang
ing urban population. Embarcadero
Center, located in the City's financial dis
trict, on the site where San Francisco first
began, represents a bold attempt to com
bine living, business, and shopping in a
downtown complex.
Architect John Pullman designed the
Center to encompass three spectacular of
fice buildings rising above interconnect
ing levels of shops, stores, cafes and re
staurants.
With a committment to creating a total
environment, Embarcadero Center has

designated one percent of its construction
costs to financing works of art in its public
areas. Scattered throughout the center are
sculptures by contemporaryartists Louise
Nevelson, Willi Gutmann, Nicholas Schof
fer and Barbara Shawcroft, as well as a
variety of tapestries and paintings. Open
air mosaic walkways, fountains, and care
ful landscaping enforce the harmony of
this living-working community.
The Downtown Art Center, on the
podium level of Three Embarcadero, pro
vides another means of exploring the San
Francisco art scene. Affiliated with the Fine
Arts Museums of San Francisco, the
museum is now sponsoring a major exhib
ition of contemporary art, historic photo
graphs, and objects based on the theme of
"work" and the water. The show, which
features works by Duane Hanson, George
Segal, and Robert Arneson, will run
through Nov. 11.
For those interested in smaller private
galleries, the nearby )ackson Square area
offers several, including the Museum Print
Shop, the )ohn Bolles Gallery, and the
Marquoit Gallery. The 19th century brick
warehouses of this neighborhood are re

mnants of the city's first commercial dis
trict.
Shops and restaurants fill the first three
floors of Embarcadero Center. Since many
establishments follow standard office
hours, daytime or early evening is the best
time to visit the center.
Shops worth looking into are:
David-Anderson of Norway — Scandina
vian gold and silver jewelry, flatware,
porcelain, crystal, and pewter.
Mrs. Robinson's — a gourmet's delight of
food and wines.
Along the way, you might want to stop
by these restaurants:
Le Scoop Ice Cream and Frozen Yogurt Bar
— featuring soft frozen yogurt and the in
comparable Bud's ice cream.
Restaurant and Bar — sophis
ticated cafeteria style, with great
homemade soup and quiche, fresh salads,
and rich desserts.
Scott's Seafood Bar and Grill — fresh sea
food luncheons and dinners, expensive
but with a touch of class.
These are four levels of convenient park
ing under each Embarcadero Center build
ing.


Embarcadero Center is located just north of California Street. The center is easily accessible from the
California cable car and a nearby Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station on Market Street.
