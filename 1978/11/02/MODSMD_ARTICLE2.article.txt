# Tackles domestic violence
## Group helps abused women 
### KATHLEEN WHEATON 
Imagine an argument in which a
husband begins to hit his wife; she
calls the police, and an officer tells
her to calm down and not become
hysterical. Or imagine a coed who is
physically threatened by her ex
boyfriend; her friends convince her
not to report the incident, saying that
she will ruin his chances for medical
school.
Both of these cases are similar to
incidents of domestic violence hand
led recently by the local Mid-
Peninsula Support League, said
league coordinator Cynthia Ellwood.
The league receives more than 80
calls per week dealing with domestic
violence against women.
"Physical abuse doesn't respect
economic or educational bound
aries," Ellwood said, who reports
that the league gets as many calls
from the Stanford community as
from East Palo Alto. The callers here
included both faculty wives and stu
dents.

"The pressures of college often
provoke violence, buf in upper
middle-class communities like this
one, it's kept secret," she said.
Volunteer staff
Staffed by professionally-trained
volunteers, the league offers both
legal and psychological counseling
to callers. Staff members also find
temporary homes in the community
forabused women and theirchildren
and employment and welfare advice
is given to housewives who must
suddenly be self-supporting.
"The tragedy of domestic violence
is that most women feel they have no
recourse," Ellwood said. "The police
can do little unless they actually wit
ness a beating. And friends and rela
tives often refuse to support or even
believe the woman."
Ellwood said violence occurs "with
some regularity" in 35 percent of
American families.
"Many of the causes stem from our
upbringing," she said. For example,
white women learn to be dependent

on men for both economic and
psychological support.
"Often the woman is made to feel
that the violence is her fault. We find
that an abusive man is usually an out
going, likeable person â€” people as
sume she must be doing something
pretty terrible to provoke him,"
Ellwood said.
Preventive medicine
The league stresses preventive
education as well as crisis interven
tion. Rap sessions and seminars help
women to foresee potential vio
lence, and to take action when it oc
curs.
Funded almost entirely through
local contributions, the league is
seeking closerties with thecommun
ity, Ellwood said.
"Families in which domestic vio
lence occurs tend to have isolated
themselves socially," she said.
"We need to extend our conception
of the family beyond the nuclear
unit. Other ties, other contacts, give
couples the outlet they need."
