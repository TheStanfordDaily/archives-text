# Cowell handles common complaints
## 
### KATHY SHEIL 
Like many medical clinics, the Cowell
Student Health Center here is both
criticized and complimented frequently.
"They are not terribly efficient."
"It's free and it's always there."
"They leave you up in the air."
"They do provide a lot of excellent ser
vices."
Cowell director Dr. James McClenahan
said much of the dissatisfaction with the
clinic stems from a what he called," a dif
ference in perception of urgency or expec
tations of what can be done."
In the past students have complained
that the clinic is overly cautious in dispens
ing medicine, and that unless a patient
feels like he is "dying," Cowell staff will
not give treatment.
McClenahan said that many problems
between Cowell and students arise be
cause the clinic system differs from the
private doctor services to which many stu
dents are accustomed.
"You cannot expect to get the same ki nd
of treatment you do from a family doctor,"
acknowledged one student.
Referring to the complaints, McClena
han said "Health services and dorm food
have certain reputations. Health services
is essentially people, and there are per
sonality conflicts. And itisn'tas thoughwe
never made a mistake.
Low staff turnover
"We choose our own staff, and there's
not a big turnover," McClenahan added.
"We're pretty lucky at Stanford. It's a nice
neighborhood and it attracts good
people."

On an average day, Cowell staff see
about 150 and 175 patients, McClenahan
said. Mondays are the busiest days, be
cause of weekend activities, he added.
The most common complaints are infecti
ous diseases like colds or the flu.
"It is pretty much a reflection of the
general population in tprms of illness,"
McClenahan said. "Of course, we do see a
fairly large number of accidents, with all
the intramural sports and the bicycles."
Cowell is arranged so that most services
are free, he said. Student health services
are paid through "general funds like the
English Department or the Athletic De
partment," McClenahan said. The funds
cover all expenses for "in-building"
treatment, consultation that doesn't in
volve surgery or accident, and short-term
counseling, he added.
Prescription medicines and hospitaliza
tion are not covered by tuition. "That's
why we push insurance," McClenahan
said.
"We have a good program here," he
commented. In addition to the regular
medical services, Cowell offers
gynecological and contraceptive care, al
lergy treatment, immunizations, der
matological care, physical therapy, and
counseling and psychological services.
Five full-time doctors
Five full-time doctors are on the Health
Services staff. Part-time members include
a gynecologist, a dermatologist and an or
thopedic surgeon. Other medical staff
members include nurse practitioners, out
patient nurses, infirmary nurses, a senior
resident in pediatrics and a physical

therapist.
Cowell also offers counseling services
with a staff of three psychiatrists and ap
proximately 10 psychologists — social
workers. About 9 percent of the stu
dent body comes in at some time for help
with emotional problems, McClenahan
estimated.
"This is a time for a lot of decisions,"
said McClenahan. "A lot of people just
need to talk."
Cowell's set up is "a little bit unusual,"
he said. After World War II, as the Univer
sity grew larger and the Health Center ex
panded, it contracted with the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, a private practice group.
Cowell still has ties with the clinic, refer
ring some patients there. Some of the staff
members at Cowell also work at the Palo
Alto clinic.
Appointments recommended
Cowell staff members recommend that
students call to make appointments.
Making an appointment will reduce the
waiting time and give the staff an idea of
the type of treatment that will be needed,
McClenahan said. If necessary, arrange
ments for lab work or X-rays can be
pre-arranged. Cowell staff can also give
medical advice by telephone if the com
plaint is minor.
After regular hours, injuries and illness
are handled at the infirmary. A nurse does
the preliminary examination, consulting
or calling in a doctor if necessary. A physi
cian and psychiatrist are always on call and
consultants are available at the Palo Alto
clinic.

that the clinic is overly cautious in dispens
ing medicine, and that unless a patient
feels like he is "dying," Cowell staff will
not give treatment.
McClenahan said that many problems
between Cowell and students arise be
cause the clinic system differs from the
private doctor services to which many stu
dents are accustomed.
"You cannot expect to get the same ki nd
of treatment you do from a family doctor,"
acknowledged one student.
Referring to the complaints, McClena
han said "Health services and dorm food
have certain reputations. Health services
is essentially people, and there are per
sonality conflicts. And itisn'tas thoughwe
never made a mistake.
Low staff turnover
"We choose our own staff, and there's
not a big turnover," McClenahan added.
"We're pretty lucky at Stanford. It's a nice
neighborhood and it attracts good
people."

On an average day, Cowell staff see
about 150 and 175 patients, McClenahan
said. Mondays are the busiest days, be
cause of weekend activities, he added.
The most common complaints are infecti
ous diseases like colds or the flu.
"It is pretty much a reflection of the
general population in tprms of illness,"
McClenahan said. "Of course, we do see a
fairly large number of accidents, with all
the intramural sports and the bicycles."
Cowell is arranged so that most services
are free, he said. Student health services
are paid through "general funds like the
English Department or the Athletic De
partment," McClenahan said. The funds
cover all expenses for "in-building"
treatment, consultation that doesn't in
volve surgery or accident, and short-term
counseling, he added.
Prescription medicines and hospitaliza
tion are not covered by tuition. "That's
why we push insurance," McClenahan
said.
"We have a good program here," he
commented. In addition to the regular
medical services, Cowell offers
gynecological and contraceptive care, al
lergy treatment, immunizations, der
matological care, physical therapy, and
counseling and psychological services.
Five full-time doctors
Five full-time doctors are on the Health
Services staff. Part-time members include
a gynecologist, a dermatologist and an or
thopedic surgeon. Other medical staff
members include nurse practitioners, out
patient nurses, infirmary nurses, a senior
resident in pediatrics and a physical

therapist.
Cowell also offers counseling services
with a staff of three psychiatrists and ap
proximately 10 psychologists — social
workers. About 9 percent of the stu
dent body comes in at some time for help
with emotional problems, McClenahan
estimated.
"This is a time for a lot of decisions,"
said McClenahan. "A lot of people just
need to talk."
Cowell's set up is "a little bit unusual,"
he said. After World War II, as the Univer
sity grew larger and the Health Center ex
panded, it contracted with the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, a private practice group.
Cowell still has ties with the clinic, refer
ring some patients there. Some of the staff
members at Cowell also work at the Palo
Alto clinic.
Appointments recommended
Cowell staff members recommend that
students call to make appointments.
Making an appointment will reduce the
waiting time and give the staff an idea of
the type of treatment that will be needed,
McClenahan said. If necessary, arrange
ments for lab work or X-rays can be
pre-arranged. Cowell staff can also give
medical advice by telephone if the com
plaint is minor.
After regular hours, injuries and illness
are handled at the infirmary. A nurse does
the preliminary examination, consulting
or calling in a doctor if necessary. A physi
cian and psychiatrist are always on call and
consultants are available at the Palo Alto
clinic.

Like many medical clinics, the Cowell
Student Health Center here is both
criticized and complimented frequently.
"They are not terribly efficient."
"It's free and it's always there."
"They leave you up in the air."
"They do provide a lot of excellent ser
vices."
Cowell director Dr. James McClenahan
said much of the dissatisfaction with the
clinic stems from a what he called," a dif
ference in perception of urgency or expec
