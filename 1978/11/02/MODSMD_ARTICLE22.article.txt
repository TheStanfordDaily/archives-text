# Topics include sex, vegetables
## Club promotes speaking skills 
### CHRIS GREENE 
The Bassett Club, Stanford's
chapter of the Toastmasters In
ternational, is taking a new in
terest in promoting participa
tion by University members,
according to a spokesman. Re
gretting the "de-emphasized
relationship" with the Univer
sity, club President Gerry Can
non said he is "looking forward
to more interaction with stu
dents and faculty."
"This is not a marriage but it
is a strong relationship," Can
non said, referring to the fact
that although the club is inde
pendent of the University it has
always been associated with it.
Begun in 1934 by Virgil An
derson, a professor emeritus
of hearing and speech science
here, the club was named in
honor of another professor of
speech here, Lee Emerson Bas
sett. It was the thirty-third club
of Toastmasters International,
which now has more than 4000
clubs worldwide.
The Club was formed to help
businessmen and profession
als with their speaking ability.
"They needed expertise in
holding meetings and addres
sing conferences," Anderson
said.
"They were terribly
frightened when they started,"
Anderson added. "I think they
all greatly benefited."
Some early members be
came prominent judges and
later told Anderson the con
structive criticism of their

speeches at the club was "in
strumental in getting them
ready to go where they wanted
to be," he said.
Cannon said because of the
club's age it is well-established
and so can now offer new
programs to community mem
bers. Within a month, club
members plan to initiate a
program of eight meetings on
successive weeks that can be
attended at no charge by any
one interested in learning "to
pick up the nuts and bolts of
the Toastmasters program," he
added. The program will stress
improvement of speaking
skills..
Wednesday meetings
The Bassett Club meets on
campus every Wednesday
evening. It has 37 members,
about one third of whom are
women, Cannon said. Mem
bers include an assistant dis
trict attorney, a real estate
speculator, as well as profes
sors and a few graduate stu
dents.
At the weekly meetings
members practice their speak
ing skills. At the beginning of
the evening each person gives
a two-minute extemporaneous
speech on a topic chosen by
the so-called Topic Master,
who runs this part of the meet
ing. Topics are varied and have
included current events, sex
ual preferences, and the grow
ing of vegetables, Cannon
said.
The main speaking program

consists of prepared 7 to 10 mi
nute speeches by three or four
members. The speech topics
are chosen from lists in the
Toastmasters Manual, a book
let supplied by the interna
tional unit. After the speeches,
assigned evaluators give con
structive criticism on the
sppech content and delivery.
Trophies awarded
At the close of the meeting,
members vote on the
speeches, and award trophies
to the best extemporaneous
speaker, the best main
speaker, and to the best man
ager. The latter award can be
presented to the Toastmaster
of the evening, the Topic Mas
ter, or the Master Evaluator,
who assigns speech
evaluators.
Each week the three "man
agerial" positions are rotated
among club members.
Jerry Mulenburg, Bassett
Club administrative vice presi
dent, said he encouraged stu
dents and faculty members
here to attend some of the
weekly meetings. He said stu
dents might benefit from some
public speaking experience
and improve their skills from
some constructive criticism.
Mulenburg mentioned the
possibility that if enough stu
dents and faculty showed in
terest a new club might be
chartered on campus to meet
what he called the special
needs and schedules of Uni
versity members.
