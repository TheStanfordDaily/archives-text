## Movies/ron lillejord 'The Wiz': nowhere over the rainbow 
### 
The Wiz is a disheartening
movie, not so much because it
is bad, but because it is the
kind of movie that makes you
start to think that you never
want to go to the movies again.
You really begin to question
the value of movies when what
should have been a little
breeze of a film gets turned
into a $30 million wide-screen
sledgehammer equipped with
overkill Dolby sound. The Wiz
is a technological marvel, all
right, but it's a wasteland of a
movie.
But I'm taking the whole
thing too seriously; there's no
need to bother with deep
philosophical questions in dis

cussing The Wiz. The movie is
simply a non-musical that pre
tends to be the "biggest movie
musical ever made iri the his
tory of the universe" (or what
ever other loaded phrase
Motown and Universal wish to
use to describe their huge hus
tle).
Or better yet, The Wiz is a
corporate executive's idea of a
movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure we
don't offend anybody.
And it takes someone with a
corporate mentality to cast
Diana Ross as Dorothy. "Hey,
she's the biggest black star
around. Let's get her to play
the role."

Actually, the casting of Ross
would've worked if the
filmmakers had fit the movie to
her talents, rather than try to
change her to fit Joel
Schumacher's relentlessly in
nocent script. "Get her out of
that lavender dress!" You want
to scream when you first see
her here.
Diana Ross is a tough lady —
her dogged "performance" in
this movie just provides more
proof of that. Her determina
tion is incredible (if not very
appealing).
But Ross is so obviously
wrong in her role here — a
prim, 24-year-old school
teacher — that you almost,

perversely, begin to care what
happens to her. Ross is at best
miscast, and at worst a hole in
the screen. To play the
Dorothy as written, she has to
stifle everything that she's got
(why didn't someone give her
role some toughness, some
humor, anything l .).
The replacement
The producer's original
choice for director was )ohn
Badham (Saturday Night
Fever), but Badham quit rather
than accept Ross. His replace
ment, Sidney Lumet, flounders
about rather helplessly.
As always, Lumet brings in
the best technicians, particu
larly designer Tony Walton
(who must have had the time of
his life filling the huge sets) and
cinematographer Oswald Mor
ris, but he still looks lost.
Lumet's best movies (Dog Day
Afternoon, especially) have a
street toughness to them — it
comes from working fast and
hard. At the very least, Lumet
films have energy, strong act
ing tone.
Not here. Lumet never gets a
grip on himself. In his desire to
energize this sprawling mess,
Lumet simply increased the
budget (for the first time in his
career, he was over budget
with The Wiz), turned the vol
ume up and enlarged the sets.
Individuality and subtlety are
trampled by all the technology.
Questions
But who do we focus on?
Where do we place our hopes,
who do we fear for? You can't
have a fantasy if there's no
thing to fantasize about, if
there are no details for you to
wonder at. Everything is so
loud and huge in The Wiz that
fantasy never has a chance.
Lumet appears to be so thril
led to be directing this multi

megabuck extravanganza (The
Wiz is his first musical and by
far his biggest budget) that he
wants everyone to see just how
huge it is. He shoots all the
dance scenes as if he was a
mother with 14 kids. To get all
his dancers in the same frame,
he has to get so far away with
the camera that you can barely
make out their forms.
You assume they're dancing
well, but you're too far away to
know for sure.
Busby Berkeley
The movie musical is Gene
Kelly or Cyd Charisse — up
close — playing off the cam
era, their eyes shining; not
hundreds of precision dancers
marching about over and over
again in massive production
numbers. Lumet must have
decided that the easiest musi
cal impression he could do was
one of Busby Berkeley.
And what an impression. The
Wiz must have some of the
biggest sets in movie history,
more dancers, more lights,
more costumes.
But the endless repetition of
bigness kills the movie com
pletely. The supporting per
formers struggle valiantly, but
you know that it's inevitably
hopeless — they're set at the
wrong scale.
Michael )ackson (in his
movie debut as the Scarecrow)
and Ted Ross (repeating his
stage role as the Cowardly
Lion) go at their parts with a lot
of energy, and you enjoy them
when you can see them. Lumet
ruins Ross' big scene by shoot
ing it in front of a courthouse
— making sure that none of the
courthouse is cropped out. As
the Lion struts about on the yel
low brick road in front of the
courthouse, he looks so small
compared to everything else,
that you feel very far away from
him — and it shouldn't be that
way at all.
Best thing
Nipsey Russell is probably
the best thing in the movie. As
the Tin Man, Russell will hardly
make you forget Jack Haley,
but he has some flash and a
little low comedy in him, and
the film pauses just long
enough for you to notice it.
Richard Pryor suffers the
most — he's probably the
biggest human victim in the
movie. As the Wiz, Pryor just
looks tired. You keep waiting
for something to happen; for
those eyes to flash, for some
trick of timing. But the
filmmakers won't let Pryor do
anything; after all, the film is
C-rated. Pryor represents just
another corporate casting
move.
After The Wiz is done lurch
ing from one big production
numbet to the next, and Diana
Ross is returned home to Har
lem, you sit there, desen
sitized.
Perhaps a few idle thoughts
come to mind. Towards the
end of The Wiz, someone says
something about "success,
fame and fortune" being "all
illusions." If only the people
who made this movie had ever
thought that to be something
other than pap for the masses.
Fantasies die in the board
room.
