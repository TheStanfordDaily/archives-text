## Rose: real fusion 
### 
The violin, perhaps the
most expressive instru
ment of compositional
music, has lately fallen into
a very low position in musi
cal improvisation. Jean-Luc
Ponty seems content to at
tract rock fans, while
Stephane Grappelli is mov
ing in the same direction.
Similarly newcomers such
as Noel Pointer have failed
to exhibit even a touch of
creativity. With the passing
of the old master )oe Ven
uti, it appeared that there
was a large unfilled gap in
the state of jazz violin.
This state of affairs makes
David Rose's album. Dis
tance Between Dreams, all
the more welcome. Rose
exhibits equal fluency with
electric and acoustic
mediums, and brings to
both an individuality and
inspiration lacking in much
contemporary music.
Real fusion
His group, which con
sists mostly of European
jazz musicians, is not afraid
to create a real fusion.
Acoustic and electric in
strument are mixed on the
same tracks; it is not un
usual to hear an acoustic
bass pulsating in the
background of a highly
synthesized section. Un
like the so-called fusion,
which simply displays a
contrived pop-funk format,
Rose mixes musical styles
in an attractive manner He
is not afraid of dissonance,

nor is he obsessed by it. His
music treads that difficult
bridge between the famil
iar and the experimental.
Rose blends these poten
tially dangerous elements
into a successful approach.
Promise
Rose has yet to attain
Ponty's talents as an impro
viser, or Venuti's rhythmic
drive — still, the basic in
genuity and creativity of his
style show considerable
promise.
Peter Eggers deserves
credit for his contribution
on keyboards. He is ex
tremely sensitive to the
flow of the music, and pro
vides a variety of textrues
for Rose to work with.

jazz musicians, is not afraid
to create a real fusion.
Acoustic and electric in
strument are mixed on the
same tracks; it is not un
usual to hear an acoustic
bass pulsating in the
background of a highly
synthesized section. Un
like the so-called fusion,
which simply displays a
contrived pop-funk format,
Rose mixes musical styles
in an attractive manner He
is not afraid of dissonance,

nor is he obsessed by it. His
music treads that difficult
bridge between the famil
iar and the experimental.
Rose blends these poten
tially dangerous elements
into a successful approach.
Promise
Rose has yet to attain
Ponty's talents as an impro
viser, or Venuti's rhythmic
drive — still, the basic in
genuity and creativity of his
style show considerable
promise.
Peter Eggers deserves
credit for his contribution
on keyboards. He is ex
tremely sensitive to the
flow of the music, and pro
vides a variety of textrues
for Rose to work with.
