## A 						hot night in Maples 
### 
On Sunday evening, great lines poured into
Maples Pavillion to hear Sea Level, U.F.0., and
the top-billed Atlanta Rhythm Section perform
their diverse music.
As the lights finally dimmed and Sea Level
took the stage, the near capacity crowd went
wild. The crowd remained enthused as the band
wailed out several hot numbers, including "A
Lot of Colada," a jazzed tune filled out with
intricate keyboards and a rasping sax. Sea Level
played on to a great finale and definitely left the
chanting crowd wanting more.
As U.F.O. appeared and their first few chords
shattered the air, hard-core rockers down on
the floor began clapping and swaying to the
beat. The band dragged out song after song with
seemingly endless repetition.
Attempt
The "musicians" attempted to spark the audi
ence with a series of on-stage antics: stripping
off their shirts and tossing them out to groupies
in the front row, then gazing at the lead vocalist
as he thrust his microphone down his pants —
unfortunately, this did little to stimulate his per
formance. As a final touch, the lead guitarist

began strumming behind his back, but with no
noticable improvement in the quality of his play
ing. After a surprisingly well-played encore,
U.F.O. finally trouped offstage to enthusiastic
applause.
Ready
As the stage crew slowly set up for the final
act, the crowd amused itself with frisbees,
homework, and drugs. When the Atlanta
Rhythm Section finally took the stage, everyone
was ready for some red-hot rock 'n' roll.
They opened their set with a rather dry rendi
tion of "Sky High," but soon the crowd was
clapping and stomping to "Not Going to Let it
Bother Me Tonight," and an excellent version of
"So Into You." The set reached an awesome
climax as A.R.S. passed out a bottle of cham
pagne and fired out "Champagne Jam" to some
lightning fast guitar licks and a short bass solo.
As an encore the band played the classic Beatle
tune "Rocky Raccoon." Overall, the set was very
short and very professional, perhaps a little dis
appointing to those familiar with the band's
music.
