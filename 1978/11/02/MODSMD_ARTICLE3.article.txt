# Conservative, liberal alumni vie for seat
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
California's 20th Assembly District represents
no more of the University than the largely empty
480-acre area used by Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) deep in the foothills of San Mateo
County, well behind the main campus.
Yet by the looks of the upcoming election, there
might be a reason to relocate the district here â€”
for the race matches two University graduates in
the assembly contest.

News analysis

Republican candidate Robert Naylor, class of
1966, faces Democrat Chris Cobey, who graduated
in 1971. Cobey has said several times that Naylor is
too conservative to represent the 20th District.
The claims may have a basis: when Naylor was
the editor of the Daily here 14 years ago, he
shocked the campus by endorsing Barry Goldwa
terforpresident. Naylorsaid he has moderated his
political views since that time, but some San
Mateo County Democratic leaders still say he is
too conservative, including Anna Eshoo, San
Mateo County central committee chairman.
According to Naylor, Cobey is a more danger
ous liberal threat than Naylor might be as a con
servative threat. "If you look at the vote-getting
records of people we have supported, his candi
dates are more extreme," Naylor said.
The day after Naylor wrote his controversial
editorial backingColdwater in 1964, the remaining
seven of the eight members of the Daily editorial
board wrote a dissenting opinion endorsing in

cumbent Lyndon )ohnson. One of the editors was
Naylor's own roommate, Naylor said recently.
But more contemporary issues will decide the
winner in next Tuesday's election. Naylor said he
and Cobey have sharp ideological differences.
"People ought to take a look at positions on
issues and not deal in labels that have become
fairly meaningless in the past 10 years," he said.
Since late September, the two candidates have
held 14 debates throughout the 20th District,
which includes roughly the area between San
Mateo and Menlo Park.
The main Stanford campus is in the 21st Assem
bly District.
Naylor says that he opposes the legalization of
strikes by public employees while Cobey says that
he supports it, with the exception of strikes by
police and fire departments.
On Proposition 5, the anti-smoking initiative,
Naylor said he opposes the measure, calling it "an
excessive government regulation of personal be
havior and largely unenforceable." Cobey said he
supports Proposition 5.
Both candidates oppose Proposition 6, the
anti-homosexual initiative which would allow
school committees to fire homosexual teachers or
those who publicly advocate homosexuality.
On Proposition 7, which calls for broader appli
cation of the death penalty, Naylor said he sup
ports the measure while Cobey said he opposes it.
Cobey said that Naylor "doesn't represent the
type of moderate and independent candidates this
district has elected in the past," while Naylor said
he takes "a more libertarian view than Cobey on a

lot of things."
The two candidates are vying for the position left
vacant by Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, who cam
paigned unsuccessfully for the Republican nomi
nation for state controller.
Naylor has conducted the most expensive as
sembly campaign in San Mateo county history ac
cording to county records. Naylor spent $56,000 in
the primary campaign, while Cobey spent $12,000.
Naylor said he has budgeted $90,000 for the gen
eral election; Cobey said he is spending under
$50,000.
Naylor claims that his expenditures actually rep
resent "a relatively modest campaign for a tightly
contested registration situation." Fie said that
while his own expenses are the highest in county
history, there have been assembly contests in
other counties where candidates have spent up to
$300,000.
Cobey was selected as a delegate supporting
liberal Sen. Frank Church (D-ldaho) to the 1976
Democratic Convention, but he did not attend
because Church failed to receive enough votes in
California. Naylor said he has been a steady sup
porter of Ronald Reagan and was a Reagan dele
gate at the 1976 Republican convention.
Cobey also has charged that Naylor is chiefly a
"probate attorney" whose San Francisco law firm
of Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro "doesn't really
represent the little guy," according to Eshoo. But
Naylor says that probate work only takes 15 per
cent of his time, and that he spent much more time
on matters dealing with state and federal political
reform acts.
