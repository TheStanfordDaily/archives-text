Students will get tuition credits
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed
legislation yesterday making more than 1 million
students from middle-income families eligible for
federal help to pay college tuition.
Basic education grants, now limited to families
with annual incomes of less than $16,000, will be
come available to families with incomes up to
$26,000, depending on future appropriations.
Sponsors said this would make an additional 1.5
million students eligible.
Grants for students in lower-income families
will be increased. A student from a family with
$14,000 income will be eligible for $1158 a year
instead of the present $462, for instance.
The bill also lifts the family income requirement
from a program under which the federal govern
ment assists in paying interest on guaranteed
loans for higher education. These are now limited
to families with incomes below $25,000. Additional
inducements will be offered to lending institu
tions to participate in the program.
Amin annexes Tanzanian strip
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Ugandan President
Idi Amin claimed yesterday that he has annexed a
710-square-mile strip of Tanzanian territory along
the western shore of Lake Victoria amid reports of
fierce fighting between troops of the two East Afri
can nations.
A Radio Uganda broadcast monitored here
quoted a military spokesman as saying the annexa
tion was accomplished with "supersonic speed,"
and was in retaliation forTanzania'salleged attack
on Uganda last week.
The military spokesman, believed to be Amin
himself, declared the new boundary between the
states as the Kagera River, about 20 miles south of
the original border.
The annexation announcement was LJganda's
first official confirmation that its forces, which
have both Soviet and British equipment, had in
vaded Tanzanian territory and that clashes were
taking place with Tanzanian security forces, which
have some Soviet equipment.
Tanzanian government sources said clashes be
tween an undisclosed number of Tanzanian sol
diers and 2000 to 3000 Ugandan troops, backed by
tanks and heavy artillery, were centered near the
town of Kyaka.
Tanzanian sources said troops had been rushed
to the battle area and the government, apparently
preparing for a protracted war, began requisition
ing private and government-owned trucks and
buses to aid in ferrying troops and supplies.
Iran to free political prisoners
Tehran, Iran — In an apparent move to curb
strikes and stem the tide of anti-government riots,
Justice Minister Hussein Najafi announced yester
day that all political prisoners in Iran will be freed
Dec. 10.

Meanwhile, a strike by 37,000 oil refinery work
ers cut Iran's huge oil export flow by more than
half even though some employees of the National
Iranian Oil Co. began returning to their jobs. The
011 workers' demands include more money and
freedom for political prisoners.
The announcement that the government would
free the prisoners came as reports poured into the
capital of new strikes and more violent demonstra
tions across the country.
Authorities said 23 anti-government protesters
were killed and at least 56 injured in clashes with
troops or supporters of Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi.
The demonstrators demanded the release of
persons jailed for their opposition to the shah,
Iran's imperial ruler. The rioters, incited by Mos
lem religious leaders, have clashed with Iranian
security forces despite the government's martial
law declaration, issued in September, that affects
12 cities, including Tehran.
Dymally reports Curb's slander
Los Angeles — Mike Curb, the Republican can
didate for lieutenant governor, was accused in two
reports to police yesterday of possible criminal
slander against Democratic incumbent Mervyn
Dymally.
The accusations, filed on behalf of Dymally by
attorneys in Redlands and San Jose, were based on
statements Curb made at weekend fundraisers.
Beverly Hills attorney L. John Arden, who filed
the report with the Redlands Police Department,
said it was prompted by Curb's speech Saturday
night, in which he had called Dymally a "criminal"
who had used public funds for private purposes.
Curb's remark "constituted criminal slander and
far exceeds the bounds of fair play," Arden said.
The San Jose filing by attorney John Thorne,
asking the police chief to seek a criminal slander
complaint against Curb, was based on similar
statements that Curb had made in that city Sunday.
Redlands Police Chief Robert Brickley said his
department would investigate the report and, if
necessary, present evidence to the San Bernar
dino district attorney's office for possible prosecu
tion.
Brickley said it was the first criminal slander ac
cusation his department had ever received.
A criminal slander conviction carries a maximum
sentence of one year in jail and a $5000 fine.
Responding late yesterday to news of the filings,
Curb said, "Since I am leading in all the statewide
polls, I'm not surprised at anything that he (Dym
ally) might try to do."
Refugees settling in Honduras
San Pedro Sula, Honduras — Thousands of Pales
tinians have settled in this Central American na
tion over the years, fleeing political violence and
discrimination in their homeland. Most say they
intend to remain, even if peace comes to the
Mideast.

The Palestinians, with a smattering of Syrians
and Lebanese, number about 20,000 and form the
backbone of the nation's industrial and commer
cial class.
Many of the major businesses and factories that
line the narrow streets of San Pedro Sula, the na
tion's industrial and commercial center, are dot
ted with Arabic names and a few of the signs are in
Arabic.
Some of the settlers continue to speak Arabic,
especially at home, although virtually all speak
Spanish. Most are Christian and some have tight
family ties.
Moscone 'cleared' in bribe case
San Francisco — An intensive investigation by
station KRON turned up no evidence that Mayor
George Moscone got a $10,000 payoff from bil
lionaire Howard Hughes, the television station
said yesterday.
KRON said it found instead that the $10,000 ap
parently went from Hughes' attorney James
Wadsworth to Los Angeles political consultant
Joseph Cerrel as part of a contract for public rela
tions work on behalf of Hughes interests.
It had been alleged that the money was paid to
Moscone for his support on behalf of an expan
sion program at San Francisco International Air
port which would benefit Hughes Airwest.
Moscone angrily denied any knowledge of or
involvement with the $10,000 check on Sept. 27,
the day after published reports alleged he had
received the money.

Moscone 'cleared' in bribe case
San Francisco — An intensive investigation by
station KRON turned up no evidence that Mayor
George Moscone got a $10,000 payoff from bil
lionaire Howard Hughes, the television station
said yesterday.
KRON said it found instead that the $10,000 ap
parently went from Hughes' attorney James
Wadsworth to Los Angeles political consultant
Joseph Cerrel as part of a contract for public rela
tions work on behalf of Hughes interests.
It had been alleged that the money was paid to
Moscone for his support on behalf of an expan
sion program at San Francisco International Air
port which would benefit Hughes Airwest.
Moscone angrily denied any knowledge of or
involvement with the $10,000 check on Sept. 27,
the day after published reports alleged he had
received the money.

Students will get tuition credits
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed
legislation yesterday making more than 1 million
students from middle-income families eligible for
federal help to pay college tuition.
Basic education grants, now limited to families
with annual incomes of less than $16,000, will be
come available to families with incomes up to
$26,000, depending on future appropriations.
Sponsors said this would make an additional 1.5
million students eligible.
Grants for students in lower-income families
will be increased. A student from a family with
$14,000 income will be eligible for $1158 a year
instead of the present $462, for instance.
The bill also lifts the family income requirement
from a program under which the federal govern
ment assists in paying interest on guaranteed
loans for higher education. These are now limited
to families with incomes below $25,000. Additional
inducements will be offered to lending institu
tions to participate in the program.
Amin annexes Tanzanian strip
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Ugandan President
Idi Amin claimed yesterday that he has annexed a
710-square-mile strip of Tanzanian territory along
the western shore of Lake Victoria amid reports of
fierce fighting between troops of the two East Afri
can nations.
A Radio Uganda broadcast monitored here
quoted a military spokesman as saying the annexa
tion was accomplished with "supersonic speed,"
and was in retaliation forTanzania'salleged attack
on Uganda last week.
The military spokesman, believed to be Amin
himself, declared the new boundary between the
states as the Kagera River, about 20 miles south of
the original border.
The annexation announcement was LJganda's
first official confirmation that its forces, which
have both Soviet and British equipment, had in
vaded Tanzanian territory and that clashes were
taking place with Tanzanian security forces, which
have some Soviet equipment.
Tanzanian government sources said clashes be
tween an undisclosed number of Tanzanian sol
diers and 2000 to 3000 Ugandan troops, backed by
tanks and heavy artillery, were centered near the
town of Kyaka.
Tanzanian sources said troops had been rushed
to the battle area and the government, apparently
preparing for a protracted war, began requisition
ing private and government-owned trucks and
buses to aid in ferrying troops and supplies.
Iran to free political prisoners
Tehran, Iran — In an apparent move to curb
strikes and stem the tide of anti-government riots,
Justice Minister Hussein Najafi announced yester
day that all political prisoners in Iran will be freed
Dec. 10.

Meanwhile, a strike by 37,000 oil refinery work
ers cut Iran's huge oil export flow by more than
half even though some employees of the National
Iranian Oil Co. began returning to their jobs. The
011 workers' demands include more money and
freedom for political prisoners.
The announcement that the government would
free the prisoners came as reports poured into the
capital of new strikes and more violent demonstra
tions across the country.
Authorities said 23 anti-government protesters
were killed and at least 56 injured in clashes with
troops or supporters of Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi.
The demonstrators demanded the release of
persons jailed for their opposition to the shah,
Iran's imperial ruler. The rioters, incited by Mos
lem religious leaders, have clashed with Iranian
security forces despite the government's martial
law declaration, issued in September, that affects
12 cities, including Tehran.
Dymally reports Curb's slander
Los Angeles — Mike Curb, the Republican can
didate for lieutenant governor, was accused in two
reports to police yesterday of possible criminal
slander against Democratic incumbent Mervyn
Dymally.
The accusations, filed on behalf of Dymally by
attorneys in Redlands and San Jose, were based on
statements Curb made at weekend fundraisers.
Beverly Hills attorney L. John Arden, who filed
the report with the Redlands Police Department,
said it was prompted by Curb's speech Saturday
night, in which he had called Dymally a "criminal"
who had used public funds for private purposes.
Curb's remark "constituted criminal slander and
far exceeds the bounds of fair play," Arden said.
The San Jose filing by attorney John Thorne,
asking the police chief to seek a criminal slander
complaint against Curb, was based on similar
statements that Curb had made in that city Sunday.
Redlands Police Chief Robert Brickley said his
department would investigate the report and, if
necessary, present evidence to the San Bernar
dino district attorney's office for possible prosecu
tion.
Brickley said it was the first criminal slander ac
cusation his department had ever received.
A criminal slander conviction carries a maximum
sentence of one year in jail and a $5000 fine.
Responding late yesterday to news of the filings,
Curb said, "Since I am leading in all the statewide
polls, I'm not surprised at anything that he (Dym
ally) might try to do."

The accusations, filed on behalf of Dymally by
attorneys in Redlands and San Jose, were based on
statements Curb made at weekend fundraisers.
Beverly Hills attorney L. John Arden, who filed
the report with the Redlands Police Department,
said it was prompted by Curb's speech Saturday
night, in which he had called Dymally a "criminal"
who had used public funds for private purposes.
Curb's remark "constituted criminal slander and
far exceeds the bounds of fair play," Arden said.
The San Jose filing by attorney John Thorne,
asking the police chief to seek a criminal slander
complaint against Curb, was based on similar
statements that Curb had made in that city Sunday.
Redlands Police Chief Robert Brickley said his
department would investigate the report and, if
necessary, present evidence to the San Bernar
dino district attorney's office for possible prosecu
tion.
Brickley said it was the first criminal slander ac
cusation his department had ever received.
A criminal slander conviction carries a maximum
sentence of one year in jail and a $5000 fine.
Responding late yesterday to news of the filings,
Curb said, "Since I am leading in all the statewide
polls, I'm not surprised at anything that he (Dym
ally) might try to do."
Refugees settling in Honduras
San Pedro Sula, Honduras — Thousands of Pales
tinians have settled in this Central American na
tion over the years, fleeing political violence and
discrimination in their homeland. Most say they
intend to remain, even if peace comes to the
Mideast.

The Palestinians, with a smattering of Syrians
and Lebanese, number about 20,000 and form the
backbone of the nation's industrial and commer
cial class.
Many of the major businesses and factories that
line the narrow streets of San Pedro Sula, the na
tion's industrial and commercial center, are dot
ted with Arabic names and a few of the signs are in
Arabic.
Some of the settlers continue to speak Arabic,
especially at home, although virtually all speak
Spanish. Most are Christian and some have tight
family ties.
Moscone 'cleared' in bribe case
San Francisco — An intensive investigation by
station KRON turned up no evidence that Mayor
George Moscone got a $10,000 payoff from bil
lionaire Howard Hughes, the television station
said yesterday.
KRON said it found instead that the $10,000 ap
parently went from Hughes' attorney James
Wadsworth to Los Angeles political consultant
Joseph Cerrel as part of a contract for public rela
tions work on behalf of Hughes interests.
It had been alleged that the money was paid to
Moscone for his support on behalf of an expan
sion program at San Francisco International Air
port which would benefit Hughes Airwest.
Moscone angrily denied any knowledge of or
involvement with the $10,000 check on Sept. 27,
the day after published reports alleged he had
received the money.

Students will get tuition credits
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed
legislation yesterday making more than 1 million
students from middle-income families eligible for
federal help to pay college tuition.
Basic education grants, now limited to families
with annual incomes of less than $16,000, will be
come available to families with incomes up to
$26,000, depending on future appropriations.
Sponsors said this would make an additional 1.5
million students eligible.
Grants for students in lower-income families
will be increased. A student from a family with
$14,000 income will be eligible for $1158 a year
instead of the present $462, for instance.
The bill also lifts the family income requirement
from a program under which the federal govern
ment assists in paying interest on guaranteed
loans for higher education. These are now limited
to families with incomes below $25,000. Additional
inducements will be offered to lending institu
tions to participate in the program.
Amin annexes Tanzanian strip
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Ugandan President
Idi Amin claimed yesterday that he has annexed a
710-square-mile strip of Tanzanian territory along
the western shore of Lake Victoria amid reports of
fierce fighting between troops of the two East Afri
can nations.
A Radio Uganda broadcast monitored here
quoted a military spokesman as saying the annexa
tion was accomplished with "supersonic speed,"
and was in retaliation forTanzania'salleged attack
on Uganda last week.
The military spokesman, believed to be Amin
himself, declared the new boundary between the
states as the Kagera River, about 20 miles south of
the original border.
The annexation announcement was LJganda's
first official confirmation that its forces, which
have both Soviet and British equipment, had in
vaded Tanzanian territory and that clashes were
taking place with Tanzanian security forces, which
have some Soviet equipment.
Tanzanian government sources said clashes be
tween an undisclosed number of Tanzanian sol
diers and 2000 to 3000 Ugandan troops, backed by
tanks and heavy artillery, were centered near the
town of Kyaka.
Tanzanian sources said troops had been rushed
to the battle area and the government, apparently
preparing for a protracted war, began requisition
ing private and government-owned trucks and
buses to aid in ferrying troops and supplies.
Iran to free political prisoners
Tehran, Iran — In an apparent move to curb
strikes and stem the tide of anti-government riots,
Justice Minister Hussein Najafi announced yester
day that all political prisoners in Iran will be freed
Dec. 10.

Meanwhile, a strike by 37,000 oil refinery work
ers cut Iran's huge oil export flow by more than
half even though some employees of the National
Iranian Oil Co. began returning to their jobs. The
011 workers' demands include more money and
freedom for political prisoners.
The announcement that the government would
free the prisoners came as reports poured into the
capital of new strikes and more violent demonstra
tions across the country.
Authorities said 23 anti-government protesters
were killed and at least 56 injured in clashes with
troops or supporters of Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi.
The demonstrators demanded the release of
persons jailed for their opposition to the shah,
Iran's imperial ruler. The rioters, incited by Mos
lem religious leaders, have clashed with Iranian
security forces despite the government's martial
law declaration, issued in September, that affects
12 cities, including Tehran.
