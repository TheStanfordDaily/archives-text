# Who's trying to steal the Axe?

### 
Maybe UC-Berkeley is getting nervous. The
school may have suddenly realized it stands no
chance to regain the symbolic Axe by winning the
upcoming Big Game.
An unsuccessful attempt to steal the Axe was
reported late last night by the Department of Pub
lic Safety. Shortly after 12:30 a.m. the first glass
layer in the Axe case was shattered, sounding an
alarm. Watch Commander Ernie Brooks said the
police were at Tresidder "within a minute" and
found no one. Three persons were seen "fleeing"
Tresidder. Brooks said the only description given
by a janitor in the vicinity was that one of the
fleeing subjects was wearing a blue backpack.
About 1:20 a.m. the Daily received a call from an
unidentified male who said, "Stanford Daily, we
did not get the Axe this time, but we will next time,
you 'wusses'."
