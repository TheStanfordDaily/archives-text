# Speaker says stress affects black males
## 
### KATHLEEN WHEATON 
"Stress is doing a job on us. It's
one of the biggest killers of the black
male population."
Cecil Reeves of the San Mateo De
partment of Education gave his opin
ions on stress in the black male popu
lation Tuesday in a speech spon
sored by the Center foi Research on
Women (CROW).
Reeves, who received a doctorate
in counseling psychology here has
conducted studies throughout the
state on stress and its causes.
He told the 30 listerners in Terman
Auditorium that a disproportionate
number of black males die in their
"productive years," ages 15 to 44,
and that most deaths are related to
stress-produced illnesses such as
hypertension and heart disease.
Suicide, a direct and dramatic re
sponse to unbearable stress, is the
third largest killer of black men.
Three stages
"The three stages of stress are
alarm, resistance, and exhaustion,"
Reeves said. "A black child may enter
the alarm stage when he starts school
at age three or four. He sees that his
values and world-view are not that of
the majority, that his race makes him
somehow unacceptable. In his teens
he resists through violence, and by
his early twenties, he shows signs of
exhaustion through mental or physi
cal illness."
The negative self-image that a child
acquires in school determines his fu
ture, according to Reeves. "The av
erage teacher can tell you how long a
child will live by the time he's in third
grade."
For a child who experiences ra
cism, dropping out of school may be
good because it lessens the internal
conflict, he added.
'Stress warfare'
Reeves pointed to "stress warfare"
as the biggest threat to the black
community. "Black people are still in
slavery in the twentieth century," he
said. "The shackles are gone but the
still try to enter (society) through the
back door."
Reeves used as an example of
stress warfare the pressure placed on
males to be economic successes.
"While the media pushes certain
jobs and material possessions, the
reality is that a disproportionate
number of black males hold jobs
which society terms undesirable,"
he said.

Reeves described several
mechanisms used by black males to
cope with stress. One method is the
adoption of white culture and values
by the black male. This man attri
butes the discrimination he encoun
ters to personal failings, rather than
racism, Reeves said.
Another mechanism is one in
which a black male does recognize
his relationship to the black com
munity, and is able to maintain ties
with it while "realizing" his own po
tential, Reeves added.
"The first man, for example, would
belong to a white medical associa
tion and go to white doctors,"
Reeves said. "The second would be
long to a black medical society,
which would make him suspect
within the white medical commun
ity."
The second type, while taking a
more lealistic view of society, is most
likely to suffer symptoms of stress,
according to Reeves. "This man is
constantly having to compromise
and sacrifice in order to make it. He
will encounter more discrimination
because he remains politically con
scious of his race."
'Illegitimate success'
Reeves also pointed to other cop
ing mechanisms such as withdrawal
through drugs and alcoholism, or
crime, which he termed "an illegiti
mate means of success."
There are two ways of looking at
stress, he said. "One is to react with
anxiety, hostility and fear. Another
way is to recognize the existence of
racism, but believe work will pro
duce beneficial results."
Of this second attitide, Reeves
said, "Society is trying to systemati
cally destroy it."
