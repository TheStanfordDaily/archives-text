# President acts quickly to rescue plummeting dollar

Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter rushed to
the aid of the battered U.S. dollar with drastic actions
vesterday, including higher interest rates, plans to bor
row $30 billion in foreign money and an increase in U.S.
sales.
Carter said the long two-year slide in the dollar, which
has become worse in the past few weeks, is unwarranted
and must be stopped because it "threatens economic
progress at home and abroad and the success of our
anti-inflation program."
The Federal Reserve Board's key interest rate, the dis
count rate, was raised by an almost unprecedented one
percent to 9.5 percent, a new high that signaled yet
another increase in interest rates throughout the
economy.
The $30 billion in foreign currencies, much of which
would be borrowed from Germany, Japan and Switzer
land, would be used to buy up unwanted dollars on world
money markets to support the greenback's value, which
has declined as much as 40 percent against some major
currencies in the past year.
Risks justified
While higher interest rates could tip the nation's
economy closer to a recession in 1979 by making both
consumer and business loans more expensive, Carter
made clear the risk is justified by the need to stop the
skidding dollar. The interest rates are aimed at slowing
inflation in this country, which is considered a major
cause of the dollar's slide.
The administration is worried about the dollar decline
because it pushes up prices of imported goods and
encourages U.S. producers to also raise prices, thus
worsening inflation at home. It also undermines confi
dence in the nation's economy both here and abroad
where holders of about one-half trillion in American
dollars have seen their assets dwindle steadily.
There is fear that the sliding dollar will cause oil
exporting nations to sharply increase oil prices next year
to offset the erosion of their dollar earnings — a move
that could cause new problems for the American
economy. A moderate increase is now considered likely
in any event.
Reaction to the administration measures was im
mediate and favorable. The dollar regained some of its
recent losses against both the Japanese yen and the
German mark.
Turning to the stock market, word of government

plans for some strong new medicine for the ailing dollar
touched off a record-breaking rally yesterday, dramati
cally reversing Wall Street's recent slide.
The Dow )ones average of JO industrials soared 35. 14
to 827.79 points for its biggest single-day gain in history.
The previous record had been 32.93 points on Aug. 16,
1971, when President Richard Nixon announced a series
of drastic economic measures including a wage-price
freeze.
The upsurge marked an abrupt change of mood for
the financial community. In the last 12 trading days in
October, the Dow had taken a 104-point drop, culminat
ing in a 19.40 drop on Tuesday.
Bank investigation
Meanwhile, government is investigating charges that
leading banks in the United States conspired to drive
down the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign money
markets in order to reap windfall profits, it was disclosed
yesterday.
A justice Department official, who asked not to be
identified by name, said the investigation began about
two months ago and is focusing on charges that major
American banks "acted in concert" to drive down the
value of the dollar on international markets.
The official said that it the allegations are accurate, the
banks could be charged with price-fixing violations
under the Sherman Anti-trust Act.
The justice Department official said yesterday thai
among the sources of the allegations was David Ed
wards, a former employee of Citibank, who has filed a
civil suit against the bank.
Edwards, who charged that he was fired after making
the allegations, has said Citibank and other major banks
capitalized on the weakness of the dollar in relation to
other foreign currencies by "selling short" one day and
then buying back dollars the next day after they had
declined in value.
When traders sell dollars short, they borrow dollars
and sell them at the going price and must later replace
the borrowed dollars.
If the price of the dollar is forced down in the mean
time, the traders can make a quick profit by buying back
the borrowed dollars at a cost lower than it was when
they borrowed them.
justice Department sources said a number of other
major U.S. banks are involved in the investigation, but
they declined to name them.
