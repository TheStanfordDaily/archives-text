Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, "an innocent
man, is going to hang in a few days,"
said Murtaza Bhutto, son of Pakis
tan's former prime minister.
The younger Bhutto spoke at the
Bechtel International Center last
night. Fie was brought here by the
Committee to Set Bhutto Free Now, a
national organization based in San
Francisco, to rally support for his
father's freedom. Several students
here are members of the organiza
tion, but refuse to release their
names for fear of possible retaliation
from the Pakastani government, said
one of the speech organizers,
Michael Economides.
"On September 9, 1977, my father
was arrested on charges of conspi
racy to murder," Bhutto said. The
military government had Bhutto ar
rested because they feared his politi
cal power, he explained.
When General Zia ul-hag seized
power of Pakistan after the July 1977
election, he promised a "free and fair
election," Bhutto said, adding that
Zia alleged the prime minister's gov
ernment cheated in the first election.
Zia has now postponed an election
"until my father is cleared of mur
der," Bhutto said.
In March 1978, Zulfikar Bhutto was
convicted of murder and sentenced
to death before a firing squad, ac
cording to a New York Times article
appearing that month. His convic
tion rested on circumstantial evi
dence, the coerced confession of a
tortured man, Bhutto said.
"Four men accused of conspiring
with my father were locked up and
tortured," he added. "They all con
fessed to the conspiracy, thereby
implicating my father.
"Three of the four withdrew their
confessions in court," Bhutto con
tinued. "Only one, Masood
Mahmood, said that my father is
guilty."
Bhutto said that if his father is
guilty he wants him to be prosecuted

in accordance with the law, adding
that in Pakistan "conspiracy to mur
der does not carry the death pen
alty."
"My father is appealing his sen
tence in Pakistan's supreme court,"
Bhutto said. But Bhutto fears there is
little hope of his father's death sen
tence being set aside.
According to Bhutto, members of
the Pakistan judiciary have de
nounced their allegiance to the
Pakistan constitution and have sworn
an oath of allegiance to the military
government of General Zia.
"By doing so they promise to sen
tence my father to death if General
Zia wants him killed," Bhutto said.
Zia's military government feels
that the former prime minister's
death is essential to its survival,
Bhutto said. "Zia fears that if my
father is freed he will once again gain
political control and retaliate," he
added.
"We have tried to show them that
this is not so. But if Bhutto is killed
there will be no compromise."
Bhutto said the outcome of his
father's trial is not just "a family mat
ter. If he is killed, a civil war is bound
to follow," Bhutto said.
Zulfikar Bhutto's death by execu
tion is likely to cause a Pakistan up
heaval because much of the popula
tion there supports him, Bhutto said.
"Grotesque military leviathans are
ruling us," Bhutto said. "Our dream
is to live free in our own land."
Bhutto has come to the United
States to enlist U.S. governmental
support for his father's freedom.
"This is a human rights problem and
the United States should not dis
criminate on the enforcement of
such rights," Bhutto said.
Bhutto quoted Rousseau as having
said "once freedom is lost it can
never be regained." Bhutto said, "I
have come to the U.S. to seek assis
tance of the American government in
defying Rousseau."
