## Latest Chappie hits mark 
### 
You'll never walk past this one
on the table in White Plaza or the
magazine stand next to the cash
register in the Bookstore. No
way. The little brat on the cover,
dirty fingernails, snot in the nose
and all, is shown eating one of
those multicolored, sugar-coated
cereals that everyone is trving to
keep from being advertised on
Saturday mornings. His eyes
show the weariness that comes
from watching 17 straight hours
of violence and sexual
pervertedness-induced TV. Yep,
he looks |ust like your average
10-year-old. just like you used to
look.
The latest issue of Chaparral is
titled, "kids.'' It breaks with the
"let's-make- an - ass-out-ot
everyone-who-doesn't -work
for-the-Chappie" humor that
has prevailed in the magazine in
recent years. Granted, that was
tunny at times but it never
reached the broad popularity it
could have because ol all the
in-house humor about the
ASSU, the Daily and the other
sitting duck targets on campus.
But we were all kids once
(many still are) and so we can
relate to Highlights (remember
Goofus and Gallant?), being
sent to our rooms and skipping
fifth-period Fnglish class in
high school.
Chaparral has taken .1 new (ii
rection with this issue and ( re

dd is due its staff for that
reason alone. You won't find
the National Lampoon letters
parody in this issue or the
ASSU political crap that used to
dominate the first few pages.
Instead, the magazine seeks to
explain why modern children
gorw up to be rancid people:
the Son of Sam, the Riddler,
and Idi Amin to suggest only a
few."
|im Sarina's "You Must Leave
Now," although it has little in
common with the theme of the
issue, gives us an excellent
preview of the political trials
competition slated for inclu
sion into the Olympics in the
1980 Moscow summer games.
Both the "Perfumed
Sandbox" and "le Bon, le Mai,
et la I aide" revive memories of
our earliest sexual thoughts
and fantasies. The most poig
nant part ot these pieces is that
the fulfillment of subjects' fan
tasies is as remotely possible
now lor most people here as it
was for all of us at the age of
eight.
Remember those students in
|urnor and senior high school
who smoked in the johns and
skipped c lasses to drive to the
shopping mall to look at re
cords or buy an ice cream
cone? Well, if you do — or
don't or were one ot those
decadent tvDes yourself, you

can relive their or your es
capades through town and
around the attendance office
in "sth Period," a nice photo
graphic piece featuring two
beautiful fun-loving types who
drop the on-the-make, pick
up-minded guy cold after par
taking of some of his pot in the
cemetery. It'll be deja vu for
some of you, both male and
female.
The last time you read High
lights was probably in the de
ntist's office this summer,
right? Well, you never have to
go to the dentist again because
Chaparral has brought High
lights to Stanford. Yes, the
Timbertoes, the Bear family,
and a section on "Things To Do
With Your Pets" await your read
ing during Econ. 1.
I he Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals may
disapprove ot reclawing cats,
and that section is probably the
issue's lowest, cruelest and
most inhuman attempt at
humor, but most people will
laugh anyway. That's Stanford
students for you.
The magazine is also quite
educational in parts. You'll
learn how to escape from
Moonies by warning them ot
the airport's impending clos
ing and you'll never have to
read Sophocles because the
whole story of Oedipus Rex is

on one i omplete vvilli il
lustrations.
Of course nothing is per
fect, and I quus of Chin
coteague" must have bored
even the author. But it's a
minor flaw, rhis campus c an be

mui h more proud of its humor
magazine and its new mentality
than in years past. For 50 cents,
it's quite a bargain. You'll see it
on campus today — just look
lor thf kid stuffing his mouth
with cereal.

with cereal.

You'll never walk past this one
on the table in White Plaza or the
magazine stand next to the cash
register in the Bookstore. No
way. The little brat on the cover,
dirty fingernails, snot in the nose
and all, is shown eating one of
those multicolored, sugar-coated
cereals that everyone is trving to
keep from being advertised on
Saturday mornings. His eyes
show the weariness that comes
from watching 17 straight hours
of violence and sexual
pervertedness-induced TV. Yep,
he looks |ust like your average
10-year-old. just like you used to
look.
The latest issue of Chaparral is
titled, "kids.'' It breaks with the
"let's-make- an - ass-out-ot
everyone-who-doesn't -work
for-the-Chappie" humor that
has prevailed in the magazine in
recent years. Granted, that was
tunny at times but it never
reached the broad popularity it
could have because ol all the
in-house humor about the
ASSU, the Daily and the other
sitting duck targets on campus.
But we were all kids once
(many still are) and so we can
relate to Highlights (remember
Goofus and Gallant?), being
sent to our rooms and skipping
fifth-period Fnglish class in
high school.
Chaparral has taken .1 new (ii
rection with this issue and ( re

dd is due its staff for that
reason alone. You won't find
the National Lampoon letters
parody in this issue or the
ASSU political crap that used to
dominate the first few pages.
Instead, the magazine seeks to
explain why modern children
gorw up to be rancid people:
the Son of Sam, the Riddler,
and Idi Amin to suggest only a
few."
|im Sarina's "You Must Leave
Now," although it has little in
common with the theme of the
issue, gives us an excellent
preview of the political trials
competition slated for inclu
sion into the Olympics in the
1980 Moscow summer games.
Both the "Perfumed
Sandbox" and "le Bon, le Mai,
et la I aide" revive memories of
our earliest sexual thoughts
and fantasies. The most poig
nant part ot these pieces is that
the fulfillment of subjects' fan
tasies is as remotely possible
now lor most people here as it
was for all of us at the age of
eight.
Remember those students in
|urnor and senior high school
who smoked in the johns and
skipped c lasses to drive to the
shopping mall to look at re
cords or buy an ice cream
cone? Well, if you do — or
don't or were one ot those
decadent tvDes yourself, you

can relive their or your es
capades through town and
around the attendance office
in "sth Period," a nice photo
graphic piece featuring two
beautiful fun-loving types who
drop the on-the-make, pick
up-minded guy cold after par
taking of some of his pot in the
cemetery. It'll be deja vu for
some of you, both male and
female.
The last time you read High
lights was probably in the de
ntist's office this summer,
right? Well, you never have to
go to the dentist again because
Chaparral has brought High
lights to Stanford. Yes, the
Timbertoes, the Bear family,
and a section on "Things To Do
With Your Pets" await your read
ing during Econ. 1.
I he Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals may
disapprove ot reclawing cats,
and that section is probably the
issue's lowest, cruelest and
most inhuman attempt at
humor, but most people will
laugh anyway. That's Stanford
students for you.
The magazine is also quite
educational in parts. You'll
learn how to escape from
Moonies by warning them ot
the airport's impending clos
ing and you'll never have to
read Sophocles because the
whole story of Oedipus Rex is

on one i omplete vvilli il
lustrations.
Of course nothing is per
fect, and I quus of Chin
coteague" must have bored
even the author. But it's a
minor flaw, rhis campus c an be

mui h more proud of its humor
magazine and its new mentality
than in years past. For 50 cents,
it's quite a bargain. You'll see it
on campus today — just look
lor thf kid stuffing his mouth
with cereal.
