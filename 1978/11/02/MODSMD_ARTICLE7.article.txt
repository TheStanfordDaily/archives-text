# Political 'Star War' for House seat continues in So. Cal.
## 
### 
Santa Monica (AP) â€” Some of
the biggest names in Hol
lywood are playing supporting
roles in a congressional race
dubbed a political "Star War
because of heavy show busi
ness financing.
The reason: both candidates
have close ties to the movie
and television industry, and
Hollywood personalities have
responded with big donations
for both campaigns.
The challenger is Democrat
Carey Peck, the 29-year-old
son of actor Gregory Peck, who
is trying to unseat freshman
Rep. Robert Dornan, a flam
boyant ex-television talk show
host and former actor.
Peck's supporters include
his father, Johnny Carson,
Frank Sinatra, Henry Fonda,
Kirk Douglas, Angie Dickin
son, Ed McMahon, Natalie
Wood, Dinah Shore and Mrs.
Jack Benny.
Dornan, labeled Hol
lywood's "Great Right Hope,''
says he has drawn aid from
Gene Autry, John Wayne, Bob
Hope, Pat Boone, and his un
cle, Jack Haley, the Tin Man in
the Wizard of Oz.
Actor James Stewart has
given money to both camps.
The battle is over a congres
sional district that takes in a

strip of Southern California
beach cities several miles from
Los Angeles' movie and televi
sion studios.
Dornan won the seat two
years ago after a bitter cam
paign, and quickly became ,i
darling of the right on such is
sues as the Panama Canal
treaties and the Equal Rights
Amendment, both of which lie
opposed.
He also became known as a
politician with a flair for tht
dramatic and his eye on higher
office.
Dornan once warned his
colleagues that Soviet agents
probably were watching them
from House visitor galleries
and called Panamanian Gen.
Omar Toriijos "an immoral
pip-squeak whose brother
runs whorehouses and pushes
heroin."
In contrast, Peck is soft
spoken and reflective, a cauti
ous moderate running in a dis
trict with a slight Democratic
registration edge but a history
of electing Republicans.
There is a resemblance to his
father, particularly in his voicc
and protile.
He often talks in Kennedy
like phrases and describes
Dornan as a pessimistic
"naysayer."
