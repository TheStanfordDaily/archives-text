# Students vote 'no confidence' in Law Association
## 
### LEAH HALPER 
This is the story of Kristi Van
Kirk, who, for three years as
manager of the University's law
lounge, baked cookies and
brewed soups forstudents. It is
also the story of questionable
labor practice, the place for
human warmth in academia,
and the story of a law school
which can't find .< copy of its
constitution, and > tind its
body ot elected student offic
ers in danger ot being recalled
after an election to be held to
day.
Fired in September by the
lounge's student manager, Van
Kirk's reinstatement has be
come a symbolic rallying point

News and lysis

for many law students. In their
efforts to put Van Kirk's rehire
to a referendum student
however, these students nave
uncovered a monolith of con
stitutional issues at the Law
School. These issues culmi
nated Tuesday with a vote of no
confidence in the way the
four-member, student-elec terl
Law Association (LA) has over
seen the Van Kirk affair.
Of 264 votes cast, 172 at

firmed that the students have
"no confidence" in the actions
of the LA as it dealt with Van
Kirk's dismissal and sub
sequent events. "This is quite a
substantial vote for the Law
School" of approximately 507
students, said Don Koblitz,
one of the students interested
in reinstating Van Kirk. "But I
have no faith that they'll (LA)
trs and respond to student
opinion because nothing
forces them to respond." Be
cause of confusion among stu
dents on what the no confi
dence vote means, the LA of
ficers are calling another, more
specific, vote today.
"This will read, 'Because the
Law Association officers refuse
to direct that Kristi Van Kirk be
rehired, I feel they should res
ign,' " Peter Farranto, presi
dent of the LA said. He added
that he doesn't know what the
outcome of today's vote will
be, but foresees that "it'sgoing
to be a mess.
"One potential problem is if
we do have to resign, the cur
rent constitution requires that
we wait three weeks for
another election, and then
only permits second-year stu
dents to run." Farranto said he
and the three other LA officers

were not elected according to
these constitutional
guidelines. He hopes that the
constitutional ramifications of
today's vote will be helpful in
determining the future of the
LA.
"No one wants to boot them
out a la Nixon," said Koblitz.
"We're hoping for more of a
cumulative effect. Possibly the
administration will get ott their
asses and step in."
)ohn Lewis, a third-year law
student who has supported the
movement to bring Van Kirk
back as manager since her fir
ing, said that since the ad
ministration holds the
mortgage to the lounge, they
should ultimately determine
who works there. Van Kirk, he
believes, would be an asset.
"The administration will not
get involved," he said, "but
they hold the capital of the
lounge. We're not encourag
ing anyone to boycott, but ap
parently a lot of people are.
There has been a gross de
crease in receipts since Kristi
left. In that sense Kristi was a
profit maximizer. People came
to the lounge because of her
and the vast majority of staft
and students are behind her."
It appears that the students

will have to settle the dispute
on their own. Charles Meyer,
dean of the Law School, is un
equivocal about his intention
to remain neutral. "I am stay
ing strictly and completely out
of it,"he said. ' That's a prob
lem of the students."
As manager, Van Kirk also
had to keep the lounge clean
and do day-to-day accounting.
Major accounting, as well as
the hiring of employees and
general oversight, is tradition
ally done bya law student hired
from a pool of applicants by the
LA. This year's student man
ager, Allen Nopar, began work
in May. By September, he was
convinced he could not work
cooperatively with' Van Kirk,
and he told her on Sept. 1 not
to come back to work on Sept.
2,
"I call it firing." said Van
Kirk, who is waiting until
lanuary to look lor employ
ment elsewhere because of the
student effort to rehire her.
"The memos circulated by

Allen trying to justify it were, to
me, just pure lies. I think some
of the students bought it,
though."
Contrary to University labor
practice, in fact, Van Kirk was
fired without prior notice. Ad
ditionally, Nopar admits he
failed to tell Van Kirk the
reasons for his dissatisfaction
with her work. Despite the fact
that Van Kirk was technically a
Law School employee and not
a University worker, Lewis said
that "this is no reason to treat
her differently. The Law School
should operate like an arm of
the University."
Floping to put the issue to a
referendum student vote,
supporters searched for re
ferendum provisions in a
now-detunct 1959 constitu
tion, the only constitution
anyone had found.
Finding no reference to re
ferendum procedures, sup
porters attempted on Oct. 16
to amend the constitution so it
would allow for referendum

votes.
About this time, however,
the LA found what it thinks is
an active 1966 copy of the con
stitution. They then proposed
a second amendment for re
ferendum procedures, and the
resultant split vote between
the two amendments left the
Law School without a referen
dum procedure. It also raised
many questions as to which
constitution, if any, is active in
the Law School today.
The referendum vote did
signify, however, that about 90
percent of the students who
voted favor a referendum pro
cess of some kind. Without a
mechanism to revise Law
School procedure, the LA had
planned to revise the constitu
tion to include referendum
provisions. Admitting that he
has "no idea" how long such a
referendum will take, Seaver
says that the LA is presently at
an impasse, unwilling to fire
Van Kirk's replacement, John
Olson, and unable to hire Van

Kirk back unless Olson is relo
cated. "It appears that they'd
have to get rid of us before
we'd make |ohn Olson seek
employment elsewhere," he
said, adding that Van Kirk stu
dent supporters have not been
able to find Olson an accepta
ble alternate job.
Lewis said, "We don't want
to can John (Olson). That's the
principle we're supporting
Kristi on in the first place.''
He and many other students
continue to insist, however,
that Van Kirk must be rehired.
"They botched up the only un
adulterated place of friendly
humanity in the Law School,"
said Bob Weisberg, student
president ot the Law Review.
"Only first-year students go in
there now. Lohdpll said.
"They have nothing to com
pare it to Ihcre .ire not many
thing-- you ran t'o' e\cited
aboui in school, she
mused H<".*th v taken
away our one human touch in
the name ot efficiency."

students, said Don Koblitz,
one of the students interested
in reinstating Van Kirk. "But I
have no faith that they'll (LA)
trs and respond to student
opinion because nothing
forces them to respond." Be
cause of confusion among stu
dents on what the no confi
dence vote means, the LA of
ficers are calling another, more
specific, vote today.
"This will read, 'Because the
Law Association officers refuse
to direct that Kristi Van Kirk be
rehired, I feel they should res
ign,' " Peter Farranto, presi
dent of the LA said. He added
that he doesn't know what the
outcome of today's vote will
be, but foresees that "it'sgoing
to be a mess.
"One potential problem is if
we do have to resign, the cur
rent constitution requires that
we wait three weeks for
another election, and then
only permits second-year stu
dents to run." Farranto said he
and the three other LA officers

were not elected according to
these constitutional
guidelines. He hopes that the
constitutional ramifications of
today's vote will be helpful in
determining the future of the
LA.
"No one wants to boot them
out a la Nixon," said Koblitz.
"We're hoping for more of a
cumulative effect. Possibly the
administration will get ott their
asses and step in."
)ohn Lewis, a third-year law
student who has supported the
movement to bring Van Kirk
back as manager since her fir
ing, said that since the ad
ministration holds the
mortgage to the lounge, they
should ultimately determine
who works there. Van Kirk, he
believes, would be an asset.
"The administration will not
get involved," he said, "but
they hold the capital of the
lounge. We're not encourag
ing anyone to boycott, but ap
parently a lot of people are.
There has been a gross de
crease in receipts since Kristi
left. In that sense Kristi was a
profit maximizer. People came
to the lounge because of her
and the vast majority of staft
and students are behind her."
It appears that the students

will have to settle the dispute
on their own. Charles Meyer,
dean of the Law School, is un
equivocal about his intention
to remain neutral. "I am stay
ing strictly and completely out
of it,"he said. ' That's a prob
lem of the students."
As manager, Van Kirk also
had to keep the lounge clean
and do day-to-day accounting.
Major accounting, as well as
the hiring of employees and
general oversight, is tradition
ally done bya law student hired
from a pool of applicants by the
LA. This year's student man
ager, Allen Nopar, began work
in May. By September, he was
convinced he could not work
cooperatively with' Van Kirk,
and he told her on Sept. 1 not
to come back to work on Sept.
2,
"I call it firing." said Van
Kirk, who is waiting until
lanuary to look lor employ
ment elsewhere because of the
student effort to rehire her.
"The memos circulated by

Allen trying to justify it were, to
me, just pure lies. I think some
of the students bought it,
though."
Contrary to University labor
practice, in fact, Van Kirk was
fired without prior notice. Ad
ditionally, Nopar admits he
failed to tell Van Kirk the
reasons for his dissatisfaction
with her work. Despite the fact
that Van Kirk was technically a
Law School employee and not
a University worker, Lewis said
that "this is no reason to treat
her differently. The Law School
should operate like an arm of
the University."
Floping to put the issue to a
referendum student vote,
supporters searched for re
ferendum provisions in a
now-detunct 1959 constitu
tion, the only constitution
anyone had found.
Finding no reference to re
ferendum procedures, sup
porters attempted on Oct. 16
to amend the constitution so it
would allow for referendum

votes.
About this time, however,
the LA found what it thinks is
an active 1966 copy of the con
stitution. They then proposed
a second amendment for re
ferendum procedures, and the
resultant split vote between
the two amendments left the
Law School without a referen
dum procedure. It also raised
many questions as to which
constitution, if any, is active in
the Law School today.
The referendum vote did
signify, however, that about 90
percent of the students who
voted favor a referendum pro
cess of some kind. Without a
mechanism to revise Law
School procedure, the LA had
planned to revise the constitu
tion to include referendum
provisions. Admitting that he
has "no idea" how long such a
referendum will take, Seaver
says that the LA is presently at
an impasse, unwilling to fire
Van Kirk's replacement, John
Olson, and unable to hire Van

Kirk back unless Olson is relo
cated. "It appears that they'd
have to get rid of us before
we'd make |ohn Olson seek
employment elsewhere," he
said, adding that Van Kirk stu
dent supporters have not been
able to find Olson an accepta
ble alternate job.
Lewis said, "We don't want
to can John (Olson). That's the
principle we're supporting
Kristi on in the first place.''
He and many other students
continue to insist, however,
that Van Kirk must be rehired.
"They botched up the only un
adulterated place of friendly
humanity in the Law School,"
said Bob Weisberg, student
president ot the Law Review.
"Only first-year students go in
there now. Lohdpll said.
"They have nothing to com

administration will get ott their
asses and step in."
)ohn Lewis, a third-year law
student who has supported the
movement to bring Van Kirk
back as manager since her fir
ing, said that since the ad
ministration holds the
mortgage to the lounge, they
should ultimately determine
who works there. Van Kirk, he
believes, would be an asset.
"The administration will not
get involved," he said, "but
they hold the capital of the
lounge. We're not encourag
ing anyone to boycott, but ap
parently a lot of people are.
There has been a gross de
crease in receipts since Kristi
left. In that sense Kristi was a
profit maximizer. People came
to the lounge because of her
and the vast majority of staft
and students are behind her."
It appears that the students

will have to settle the dispute
on their own. Charles Meyer,
dean of the Law School, is un
equivocal about his intention
to remain neutral. "I am stay
ing strictly and completely out
of it,"he said. ' That's a prob
lem of the students."
As manager, Van Kirk also
had to keep the lounge clean
and do day-to-day accounting.
Major accounting, as well as
the hiring of employees and
general oversight, is tradition
ally done bya law student hired
from a pool of applicants by the
LA. This year's student man
ager, Allen Nopar, began work
in May. By September, he was
convinced he could not work
cooperatively with' Van Kirk,
and he told her on Sept. 1 not
to come back to work on Sept.
2,
"I call it firing." said Van
Kirk, who is waiting until
lanuary to look lor employ
ment elsewhere because of the
student effort to rehire her.
"The memos circulated by

Allen trying to justify it were, to
me, just pure lies. I think some
of the students bought it,
though."
Contrary to University labor
practice, in fact, Van Kirk was
fired without prior notice. Ad
ditionally, Nopar admits he
failed to tell Van Kirk the
reasons for his dissatisfaction
with her work. Despite the fact
that Van Kirk was technically a
Law School employee and not
a University worker, Lewis said
that "this is no reason to treat
her differently. The Law School
should operate like an arm of
the University."
Floping to put the issue to a
referendum student vote,
supporters searched for re
ferendum provisions in a
now-detunct 1959 constitu
tion, the only constitution
anyone had found.
Finding no reference to re
ferendum procedures, sup
porters attempted on Oct. 16
to amend the constitution so it
would allow for referendum

votes.
About this time, however,
the LA found what it thinks is
an active 1966 copy of the con
stitution. They then proposed
a second amendment for re
ferendum procedures, and the
resultant split vote between
the two amendments left the
Law School without a referen
dum procedure. It also raised
many questions as to which
constitution, if any, is active in
the Law School today.
The referendum vote did
signify, however, that about 90
percent of the students who
voted favor a referendum pro
cess of some kind. Without a
mechanism to revise Law
School procedure, the LA had
planned to revise the constitu
tion to include referendum
provisions. Admitting that he
has "no idea" how long such a
referendum will take, Seaver
says that the LA is presently at
an impasse, unwilling to fire
Van Kirk's replacement, John
Olson, and unable to hire Van

Kirk back unless Olson is relo
cated. "It appears that they'd
have to get rid of us before
we'd make |ohn Olson seek
employment elsewhere," he
said, adding that Van Kirk stu
dent supporters have not been
able to find Olson an accepta
ble alternate job.
Lewis said, "We don't want
to can John (Olson). That's the
principle we're supporting
Kristi on in the first place.''
He and many other students
continue to insist, however,
that Van Kirk must be rehired.
"They botched up the only un
adulterated place of friendly
humanity in the Law School,"
said Bob Weisberg, student
president ot the Law Review.
"Only first-year students go in
there now. Lohdpll said.
"They have nothing to com

This is the law lounge where Kristi Van Kirk, three-year manager, worked until her firing Sept. 1. A group
of supporters hopes to hring Van Kirk back to work here.
This is the story of Kristi Van
Kirk, who, for three years as
manager of the University's law
lounge, baked cookies and
brewed soups forstudents. It is
also the story of questionable
labor practice, the place for
human warmth in academia,
and the story of a law school
which can't find .< copy of its
constitution, and > tind its
body ot elected student offic
ers in danger ot being recalled
after an election to be held to

Fired in September by the
lounge's student manager, Van
Kirk's reinstatement has be
come a symbolic rallying point

News and lysis

for many law students. In their
efforts to put Van Kirk's rehire
to a referendum student
however, these students nave
uncovered a monolith of con
stitutional issues at the Law
School. These issues culmi
nated Tuesday with a vote of no
confidence in the way the
four-member, student-elec terl
Law Association (LA) has over
seen the Van Kirk affair.
Of 264 votes cast, 172 at

firmed that the students have
"no confidence" in the actions
of the LA as it dealt with Van
Kirk's dismissal and sub
sequent events. "This is quite a
substantial vote for the Law
School" of approximately 507
students, said Don Koblitz,
one of the students interested
in reinstating Van Kirk. "But I
have no faith that they'll (LA)
trs and respond to student
opinion because nothing
forces them to respond." Be
cause of confusion among stu
dents on what the no confi
dence vote means, the LA of
ficers are calling another, more
specific, vote today.
"This will read, 'Because the
Law Association officers refuse
to direct that Kristi Van Kirk be
rehired, I feel they should res
ign,' " Peter Farranto, presi
dent of the LA said. He added
that he doesn't know what the
outcome of today's vote will
be, but foresees that "it'sgoing

"One potential problem is if
we do have to resign, the cur
rent constitution requires that
we wait three weeks for
another election, and then
only permits second-year stu

and the three other LA officers

were not elected according to
these constitutional
guidelines. He hopes that the
constitutional ramifications of
today's vote will be helpful in
determining the future of the
LA.

from a pool of applicants by the
LA. This year's student man
ager, Allen Nopar, began work
in May. By September, he was
convinced he could not work
cooperatively with' Van Kirk,
and he told her on Sept. 1 not
to come back to work on Sept.
2,
"I call it firing." said Van
Kirk, who is waiting until
lanuary to look lor employ
ment elsewhere because of the
student effort to rehire her.
"The memos circulated by

Allen trying to justify it were, to
me, just pure lies. I think some
of the students bought it,
though."
Contrary to University labor
practice, in fact, Van Kirk was
fired without prior notice. Ad
ditionally, Nopar admits he
failed to tell Van Kirk the
reasons for his dissatisfaction
with her work. Despite the fact
that Van Kirk was technically a
Law School employee and not
a University worker, Lewis said
that "this is no reason to treat
her differently. The Law School
should operate like an arm of
the University."
Floping to put the issue to a
referendum student vote,
supporters searched for re
ferendum provisions in a
now-detunct 1959 constitu
tion, the only constitution
anyone had found.
Finding no reference to re
ferendum procedures, sup
porters attempted on Oct. 16
to amend the constitution so it
would allow for referendum

votes.
About this time, however,
the LA found what it thinks is
an active 1966 copy of the con
stitution. They then proposed
a second amendment for re
ferendum procedures, and the
resultant split vote between
the two amendments left the
Law School without a referen
dum procedure. It also raised
many questions as to which
constitution, if any, is active in
the Law School today.
The referendum vote did
signify, however, that about 90
percent of the students who
voted favor a referendum pro
cess of some kind. Without a
mechanism to revise Law
School procedure, the LA had
planned to revise the constitu
tion to include referendum
provisions. Admitting that he
has "no idea" how long such a
referendum will take, Seaver
says that the LA is presently at
an impasse, unwilling to fire
Van Kirk's replacement, John
Olson, and unable to hire Van

Kirk back unless Olson is relo
cated. "It appears that they'd
have to get rid of us before
we'd make |ohn Olson seek
employment elsewhere," he
said, adding that Van Kirk stu
dent supporters have not been
able to find Olson an accepta
ble alternate job.
Lewis said, "We don't want
to can John (Olson). That's the
principle we're supporting
Kristi on in the first place.''
He and many other students
continue to insist, however,
that Van Kirk must be rehired.
"They botched up the only un
adulterated place of friendly
humanity in the Law School,"
said Bob Weisberg, student
president ot the Law Review.
"Only first-year students go in
there now. Lohdpll said.
"They have nothing to com
pare it to Ihcre .ire not many
thing-- you ran t'o' e\cited
aboui in school, she
mused H<".*th v taken
away our one human touch in
the name ot efficiency."
