## Editorial Reelect McCloskey 
### 
Congressman Paul "Pete" McClos
key (R-Menlo Park), the incumbent
from California's 12th District that in
cludes the Stanford campus, has a
special quality of independence that
strikes us as being important in to
day's Congress, and for that primary
reason warrants his reelection to
Congress.
McCloskey's willingness to oppose
a special interest Cargo Preference
Act despite extreme opposition from
the maritime industry and unions is
one indication of this independence.
And he was the only Republican in
the House of Representatives to re
ceive a 100 percent rating from Com
mon Cause. Only two Democrats re
ceived the same high rating. Often he
takes stands contrary to the Republi
can party line.

His Democratic opponent, Kirsten
Olsen, has failed to mount a serious
campaign in our estimation, and her
desire to serve in Congress has to be
called into question.
McCloskey's recent proposal man
dating one year of national service for
all 18-year-olds has serious potential
problems, but until he explains it
more fully, which he should do at to
night's debate with Olsen in Kresge
Auditorium, it is very difficult to pass
judgment. It is doubtful this plan
would ever go far in Congress.
This trait of candidly saying what he
believes has to be respected, even
when in disagreement with him.
McCloskey, a Stanford alum, is al
ways in contact with students. He de
serves a return to Congress for what
he has said might very well be his last
full term.
