An open letter to the
Stanford community
The NEWZOO y
The Stanford Daily and
Invite you to a publicity workshop
November 3, 1978
Dear Friends: .
The Stanford Daily and KZSU cordially invite you or a
representative of your organization, department or living
group to a publicity workshop on Wednesday, November 8
from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Meyer Forum Room.
We are both faced continually by questions of why we did
not cover a particular event. Quite often the answer is
a lack of communications between the sponsoring group and
us.
We want to overcome this gap by exchanging ideas on how
your organization can best communicate with us. And a
publicity workshop is the logical step toward successfully
reaching out to the Stanford community.
The Daily and KZSU have complementary publicity services
that can be offered your organization. At the workshop,
we will each offer a half-hour presentation on our respec
tive needs and services, including news policies, deadlines
and effective ways of expressing your ideas. Before closing,
the workshop will be opened to feedback, questions and
suggestions.
We would hope that after attending this workshop you
could return to your organization with a better idea of
how we operate, as well as the services we can best offer
each other.
This forum will be beneficial to the whole Stanford
campus. We all have the same goal of reaching the whole
community, and the better we work together, the easier
that goal becomes attainable. We look forward to seeing
you on November 8.
Sincerely,
(2^ua, ( ' loht idcc*^
