Dear
I am Kirsten Olsen and I am running against Pete McCloskey for
Congress. As a woman, I have never been subject to the military
draft, although with the Equal Rights Amendment (which I strongly
support) I might be. But with or without ERA, I don't want to be
subject to the draft during peacetime, and I don't think you want to
be either. Pete McCloskey wants us to be. He says a Volunteer Army
is "too expensive". As someone born in Denmark during the Nazi
Occupation, I'm here to tell you thatfreedom does not come cheaply,
including the freedom to choose one's livelihood during peacetime.
I hope you will join with me in fighting to the last bureaucrat the
Pentagon's drive, supported by my opponent, to reinstate the draft.
