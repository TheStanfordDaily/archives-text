# Fiery accidents in 1976-77
## 13 Ford Pintos involved in fatal crashes 
### 
Detroit (AP) — Thirteen Ford
Pintos — more than double
what might be expected from
the number of Pintos on the
road — were involved in fiery,
fatal rear-end crashes in 1976
and 1977, federal figu res show.
The figures are different than
those Ford used to defend it
self against charges about the
Pinto and its gas tank near the
rear bumper, and they show
more rear-end crashes with
fires and deaths than the Ford
figures would indicate.
The new figures on such
rear-end crashes were com
piled from National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration
computer files at the request of
The Associated Press.
They also show that two
small cars with fuel tanks away
from the rear bumper, the
Toyota Corolla and Volkswa
gen Rabbit, were not involved
in a single such fatal crash over
the two years.
American Motors Corp.'s
Gremlin had, like the Pinto,
more rear-end, fire
accompanied fatal crashes
than would be expected. But
the low number of such acci
dents involving Gremlins —
four — made the Gremlin re
sults less conclusive.
Police reports
Drawn from police reports,
the statistics show the number
of cars in which one or more
fatalities occurred when the
vehicles were struck from the
rear and a fire occurred. They
do not mean that the fires were
serious, caused the deaths or
stemmed from fuel tank leaks.
However, the figures were
described by a University of
Michigan authority as statisti
cally significant and strong evi
dence that the controversial
Pinto is more susceptible to
serious fuel-fed fires than
other cars.
Peter Cooley, author of a
1974 industry-sponsored study
on the subject by the universi
ty's Highway Safety Research
Institute, said that the new
statistics also support the ar
gument of many safety en
gineers that fuel tanks should
go above or ahead of the rear
axle.
At the same time, the data
and other studies support the

auto industry's contention that
deaths caused by fuel-fed fires
in auto crashes, while espe
cially ugly and painful, are not
frequent.
Fires of some sort — most of
them minor — occurin aboutl
percent of motor vehicle acci
dents, the Michigan study es
timated. NHTSA agrees with
the Michigan finding that 450-
650 deaths a year are directly
caused by fires in vehicle acci
dents, or Ito 1.5 percent of the
annual highway death toll.
1444 fires
The NHTSA figures say 1444
cars had fires of some sort in
fatal crashes in 1976 and 1977.
Of those, 265 cars had been
struck in the rear, meaning a

greater likelihood that the fire
stemmed from a fuel tank leak.
Fires in rear-enders are typi
cally more serious than in
other crashes. Severe frontal
crashes, for instance, often re
sult in minor fires under the
hood that rarely cause deaths,
Cooley says, but are still listed
as fire-accompanied crashes.
NHTSA acknowledges that
its statistics are plagued by un
even police reporting of acci
dents. But the accuracy is
"reasonable" and the statistics
are sound for comparing one
car with another, said Nancy
Stubbs of NHTSA's National
Center for Statistics and
Analysis.
Ford recalled about 1.5 mill

ion 1971-76 Pinto sedans in
June after NHTSA crash tests
showed the fuel system consis
tently leaked large amounts of
fuel when struck from behind
at moderate speeds.
NHTSA said the Pinto fuel
tank's closeness to the rear
bumper and the presence of
four sharp bolts just ahead of it
combined to make the tank
especially puncture-prone
when the car is hit from be
hind.
Beginning with all 1977
model cars, improvements
were made to meet new fed
eral fuel-system safety re
quirements in rear-end colli
sions. The 1977, 1978 an 1979
Pintos are not under attack.
