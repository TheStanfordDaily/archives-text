Why are there no reflectors on any roads at
Stanford? Are there any plans to add some?
Nighttime driving on Serra St. can be a definite
hazard!
-M.R.
"This question has never really come up,"
said Oscar Nelson, master planner in the
Facilities Planning Office.
"I guess we've never considered the flow of
night traffic to be heavy enough to warrant
them," he said.
The paint used for the current lane stripes has
a reflective quality. It is supposed to react to
headlights.
Nelson noted the installation and mainte
nance costs. "It would be better not to have
them at all, than to have them and not be able to
maintain them," he said.

Is it true that any Stanford woman wishing to
obtain a contraceptive device at Cowell must
first attend a meeting with the Cowell staff con
cerning birth control counseling?
-L.A.L.
This depends on what type of contraceptive
she wants to use, according to Carol Moore, a
front office supervisor there.
Anyone who is interested in using a diap
hragm is asked to attend one of the diaphragm
classes held at Cowell every Wednesday at 7:30
p.m. and every Thursday at 3:45 p.m. The clas
ses give the students "a chance to learn how to

use it," Moore said. If a woman then decides she
wants to obtain a diaphragm, she can make an
appointment for a fitting, she said.
A woman who wants to obtain any other type
of contraceptive from Cowell must first make an
appointment to talk with either a staff physician,
nurse practitioner or peer counselor, she said.

I have been reading the San Francisco Chroni
cle for months now, and I have seen issues with
four, six and eight sections. Why is the number
of sections always even? Is there some technical
or editorial reason why thiee, five or seven sec
tions wouldn't do?
-L.R.
According to Dave Perona, the Chronicle's
assistant circulation manager for the Peninsula,
the reason is a technical one.
"An uneven section wouldn't print because
the machine would be out of balance," Perona
said.
He said an "eight stage press" is used. Each
stage has two sides. Because of the way the
paper folds and comes down on the press, the
number of sections therefore will always be
even.
