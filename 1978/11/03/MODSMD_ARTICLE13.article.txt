# Band was 'reaching for laughs'
## LSJUMB: 'less crudity, still crazy' 
### CYNTHIA SANTANA 
Rumor has it that the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB) is
changing its style. Reliable
sources say it's true!
No, a precision-conscious
LSJUMB is not in store for
rowdy band fans, but routines
Will supposedly be a bit more
kosher. Creativity is the word
for LSJLJMB this year. "We hit
an all time low in basic crudity
last year," said Band Manager

Al Jardetsky. "This year we're
psyched to be crazier, funnier
and more energetic," he said.
Jardetsky said that last year
the band had a standard for
mula for shows consisting of
two spell-outs and a picture
formation that created uproar
in the audience. "The students
wanted shows that were ris
que, and we didn't like being
tame, so shows were crude
which is what the students en
joyed," Jardetsky said. Appar

antly, alumni didn't enjoy half
time shows quite as much as
the students.
President Richard Lyman
met with the Band earlier this
year, attempting to raise the
band's consciousness, Jar
detsky said. Lyman said the
Band had been "reaching for
laughs," and some routines
were done in "poor taste," as
some alumni letters stated.
Seemingly, Lyman's appear
ance before the band had vary

ing effects. "There was a dis
tinct change in the atmosphere
of the Band," said lardetsky.
"We were getting flack from all
different sides. Impressiona
blefreshman became inhibited
and other Band members got
scared and chicken-hearted."
Another Band member
stated that Lyman was not
threatening "and really caused
us to look at what else we could
do."
So LSJUMB will be putting it
self to the test trying to steer
clear of its old formula and put
on impressive and outrage
ously funny shows, lardetsky
feels that there are ways of
doing this without regressing
to last year's style, while still
allowing the Band to have a
good time. Said lardetsky, "In
planning our half time shows
we will take into consideration
whether we will be having fun
doing this routine and whether
the students wilt ane a good
time watching. And third, what
will the rest of the stadium
think? Well, we really don't
care about that."
Every Monday night Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers
(SMUT), armed with a keg of
beer, sit down and plan the
half-time shows. Jardetsky
noted the impact of Lyman's
talk. "We were paying too
much attention to the criti
cism, and not enough to enjoy
ing ourselves," lardetsky said.
Band members say they are
doing what they want, al
though Jardetsky admits to a
certain degree of concern,
upon occasion.
Summing up this same line
of thinking, Clare Carlson,

Band librarian said, "Nobody
loves us as much as we love us.
We want to be entertainers and
make people watching us have
a good time, but we're also in
here for the fun of it."
Obviously, the LSJUMB is on
an ego trip, but Band members
say this serves to improve the
Band's performance. Lately,
response to the Band has been
encouraging. In keeping with
its one-and-only tradition —
LSJUMB has no traditions and
trys not to repeat itself — half
time shows have been praised,
and Jardetsky said the Band has
even received "love mail."
"The press box commented
that the creativity is still there
inthe LSJUMB," Jardetsky said.
About the Tulane game for
which the LSJUMB was spiffed
up in suits and new hats, one
woman wrote, "It was really
nice to see the band in uniform
again." Jardetsky thought the
letter was "gross."
Post-game concerts have
also been well received, and
have increased Band en
thusiasm. "It's great to get a
good reaction from the Stan
ford crowd, and seeing people
enjoying the Band," said
saxophone player Dave Pierce.
LSJUMB's announcer, Hal
Mickelson, said, "It reinforces
a student's emotional identity
with Stanford, I think, to see a
group that is very good at what
they do while at the same time
they are very loose about how
they do it."
As for music this year, the
Band is "the ultimate," said
Jardetsky. "We're going to be
doing some funk, rock and a
little disco. It's going to be stuff

people like to listen to," he
said.
Planning to be nothing less
than ultimate, LSJUMB is look
ing forward to Big Game week,
and the annual trek to the City.
The Arizona St. game and to
morrow's USC match are also
high on their "excitement list."

An on-campus rally before to
morrow's game is planned for
tonight. LSJUMB's objective
during these times is to have
fun and rally the Stanford fans
in any way it can. This means
being creative, and as far as
being creative goes, LSJUMB is
"incomparable."

Never let it be said that the Band doesn't have its solemn members.
This loyal member pauses between fiddle routines to eye the Band's
"other half" of game entertainment, the football players.
