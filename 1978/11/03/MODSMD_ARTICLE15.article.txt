# Booklets on undergraduate majors being compiled for all departments
## 
### KRISAN FROELICH 
Many undergraduates here have little
knowledge of how to choose an academic
major, what careers relate to which majors
and which major would best suit an indi
vidual's needs. To help cope with this
problem, Herant Katchedourian, dean of
undergraduate studies here, has divised a
project to create manuals about numerous
undergraduate majors.
Senior Lorraine Fox, a sociology major,
will complete the project for Katchedou
rian. Booklets for each major will be pub
lished and distributed to interested stu
dents, Fox said. Each booklet will contain
career opportunities relating to the major,
various programs in each department, and
a description of every faculty member in
each department.
Different flavor
"The pamphlets will be different in
flavor than Courses and Degrees is. Major
ing in a subject details more than just re
quirements," Fox said.
Katchedourian conceived the idea last
year. Fox had prepared a similar booklet
for the Philosophy Department. Katch
edourian approached Fox, requesting that
she complete similar pamphlets for all de
partments here. Fox works approximately
20 hours each week on the task.
She began the research by approaching
department secretaries, asking for availa
ble materials about majors.
"I usually got a run-around by the sec

retary. At most departments, they were
inattentive to my needs and there was very
little material out on tables," Fox said.
FHaving gathered few materials this way,
Fox then returned to each department and
admitted that she was working on a project
with Katchedourian. She said she had
"much more success getting materials."
Career options
In addition to gathering available in
formation here, Fox is contacting numer
ous organizations to inquire about career
opportunities for each major. When all the
materials are gathered, Katchedourian in
tends to hire students to compile the in
formation into small booklets. Fox said the
booklets should be available for student
and faculty use by spring quarter.
Reactions to the project, while mixed,
havegenerally been positive. Ralph Keller,
director of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) said, "Anything
like this, that helps the student gain some
perspective, is a useful tool." Keller added
that, "At the undergraduate level, unless
you're in something like engineering or
business administration it's hard to pre
pare for a career."
Some department chairment say they
have employed other methods for dis
seminating booklet-type information to
students. Joseph Berger, chairman of the
Sociology Department, said the Sociology
Department offers a seminar for students
considering a sociology major.

"The seminar describes the field and
ways the field can be used to go on with
education. It's an orientation to the de
partment, an orientation to the field, an
orientation also to career opportunities,"
Berger said. He added, though, that if the
handbooks help students become familiar
"with what's going on in the world of Stan
ford, they're basically a good idea."
Prof. Henry Breitrose, chairman of the
Communications Department, shares
Berger's opinion that other methods suc
cessfully distribute information. Breitrose
said that students "tend to rely heavily on
human beings. By in large, students use
their advisor and anyone else they can talk
to."
One of the problem's with a manual,
Breitrose said, is that while it can answer
questions, it can't ask them.
Combination
"But anything that betters the student's
understanding is useful. The manuals are
certainly a good idea, but must be used
also with a combination of the information
in Courses and Degrees and an accessible
faculty," he said.
Prof. Gordon Bower, chairman of the
Psychology Department, thinks most stu
dents get their information "under
ground. The kind of information the
handbook would present can be gotten by
any student with a trifle of effort." He said
also that the manuals will be out of date in
two to four years.
