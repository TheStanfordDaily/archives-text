## Editorials Vote 'no' on H 
### 
Measure H on the November 7 bal
lot is in itself not very devastating. It
provides temporary rent relief for
Palo Alto renters as part of the tax cuts
landlords received from Proposition
13.
But a problem with the measure is
that it could potentially lead to rent
co'ntrol. This is not just a matter of
semantics, as supporters of Measure
H would have us believe. Measure H
would essentially freeze rents in Palo
Alto for a period of 19 months. After
that, the law could possibly be ex
tended. Historically, this has been
the case — out of 200 similar laws
passed in this country, only four have
ended.
Basic economic analysis shows that
any extended form of rent control
leads to a disincentive; investments
decline in a controlled area, leading
to deterioration and lack of upkeep.

Measure H provides landlords with
a method for raising rents, but only if
they can prove "maintenance" costs.
Owners would have to spend the
money first from their own pockets,
and later substantiate this expendi
ture to their tenants. This could pos
sibly entail a court case — further
money and added hassle, possibly
lowering any incentive for improving
property.
Another legal opportunity for land
lords to raise rents is if they can prove
"hardship." But again, this would en
tail more than a few court battles,
which would be costly and would
strain an already overburdened court
system.
Thus, while Measure H is only tem
porary, it is possible that it would be
come permanent. While the need for
relief is acknowledged, long-term
rent control is not the answer. Mea
sure H deserves a NO vote.
