# Keep Rose Bird
## 
### 
California Supreme Court Justice
Rose Bird faces a vote for confirma
tion in Tuesday's election and we find
the arguments against retaining her
without merit and strongly recom
mend that the voters of California
support her.
Bird's opponents are attempting to
turn the judicial process of this state
into a political sham. To them, Bird is
a sitting duck who can be blown out
of the water as a sign of protest
against Gov. Brown and his policies.
Politicizing the courts in this manner
isa dangerous threat which the voters
should stop now.
The court can only function inde
pendently of partisan politics and
ever-swaying public opinion to up
hold the integrity and independence
it needs to judge each case in ad
cordance with the laws and the con
stitution. The popularity of a decision
cannot be a factor the courts have to
take into account.
Her concurring opinion in the con
troversial Caudillo rape case has
angered feminists and tough law en
forcement proponents alike, but the
court's role in that case was not to
determine whether the laws of this
state should have included rape as
one of the crimes inflicting "great
bodily injury" to the victim.
The court simply had the power to
determine whether sentencing a

convicted rapist to three extra years
in prison was in line with what the
legislature intended. It clearly was
not and the court did its job, and no
more, as should be the case With jud
icial review.
Bird's opponents have cited her
lack of previous judicial experience
as reason for not confirming her. Ex
perience does not necessarily endow
one with more ability to judge cases.
Some of this nation's finest justices,
including Felix Frankfurter, Louis
Brandeis, John Marshall and Earl War
ren had no experience on the bench
at the time of their selection to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
Rose Bird has refrained from cam
paigning for her own confirmation as
she should have. Her regard for the
integrity of the judicial system pre
vents her from entering into the same
arena with her opponents who have
spent considerable sums of money
on the campaign to defeat her. But
many highly regarded persons
around the state realize that Califor
nia stands to lose a fine chief justice if
she is defeated and have rallied to her
support.
Rose Bird deserves the support of
the voters of this state. Keep the judi
cial process out of the political mudsl
inging process her opponents are try
ing to lower it to. Vote to keep Rose
Bird.
