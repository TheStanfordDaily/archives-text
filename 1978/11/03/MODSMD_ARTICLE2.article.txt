## Brown attacked by Younger 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Evelle Younger
condemned Gov. Jerry Brown as
"the biggest spender in the history of
California" in their fourth debate
yesterday and again blamed Brown
for forced busing in Los Angeles.
The Democratic governor dis
puted both allegations ( saying his
administration was a model of fiscal
frugality and denying any responsi
bility for busing to integrate Los
Angeles schools.
Brown and Younger, the Republi
can nominee in the governor's race,
also tried to top each other as to who
is tougher on crime. Brown said he
consulted Republicans to find the
toughest parole people, while
Younger said Brown "hasn't shown
any leadership" in curbing crime.
Light start
Theissueofwhetherßrown isabig
spender started on a light note, with
Younger contrasting his lifestyle as a
family man with Brown's bachelor
hood and adding:
"I do think I like people more than
the governor does. I have never seen
any demonstration of warmth on the
governor's part. He lacks the Irish
charm of his father," former Gov. Pat
Brown.
"I may lack the Irish charm of my
father, but I certainly possess the fis
cal frugality of my mother," the 40-
year-old governor said.
"There has never been a time Mr.

Younger has cut a tax or cut a
budget," Brown said, asserting his
office budget increased 12 percent in
a four-year period in which
Younger's office budget increased
209 percent.
Frugality 'fiction'
"The frugality the governor is talk
ing about is pure fiction," Younger
replied. "He's the biggest spender in
the history of California . . . the total
tax burden of our people is the third
highest in the country."
Brown went to the attack on the
issue of nuclear power, which he
opposes, and challenged Younger to
say exactly where he would put the
radioactive waste from the 30 nuclear
reactors Younger wants to build in
California.
"In which counties do you prop
ose to store that cancer-causing
radioactive waste?" Brown said,. .
Los Angeles, Beverly Hills. . .
Younger replied the question was
"absurd," saying there are "a
number of sites that would be ac
ceptable" and that the best choice
would be to dig a "mile deep some
where in the desert."
"There has never been any case
where cancer can be traced to any
one of the 200 registered nuclear
power plants anywhere in the
world," Younger said.
On the topic of education, Brown
claimed he has proposed "the most

comprehensive educational reform
anywhere in the country," and has
imposed a "back to basics concept in
high schools" including new stan
dards for reading, writing and
mathematical skills needed to get a
high school diploma.
"You say you're for getting back to
basics, but you just signed a bill that
gave $55 million to the Los Angeles
school system and you salvaged a
forced busing plan under which . . .
we're going to spend about $1 billion
in the next 10 years on forced bus
ing," Younger said.
