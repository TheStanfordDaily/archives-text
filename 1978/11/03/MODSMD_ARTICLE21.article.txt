## Fonda supplies needed agitation 
### 
My first impression upon hearing |ane
Fonda speak last week was something ap
proaching disdain. A friend who went with
me to both her speech in White Plaza and
the seminar she held later at Cedro
Lounge burst into laughter at some of her
comments and statements. He finally left
after one particularly explosive outburst.
While I listened to her proposals for sol
ving the ills of society, I kept thinking to
myself "But . . . that's ridiculous! It'll
never work!" and so on and so forth. I
came away wondeirng about the intelli
gence of SCOPE for having invited her to
speak to a University audience. I felt al
most betrayed.

For all her qualities, Jane Fonda is among the
leaders of a trend - the trend towards easy
solutions for incredibly complicated problems
and the trend away from rational consideration of
those problems.

I, along with many others, went to hear
her out of curiosity. )ane Fonda was a sort
of enigma — she had a certain appeal. I
went hoping to hear a speech intelligently
conceived and thought out and an ideol
ogy I could understand and deal with on a
rational basis. When I left, I felt all I had
gotten was the unrestrained political and
emotional lambasting of some liberal
minded activist whose only real claim to
fame was her talent as an actress. I con
cluded that Jane Fonda had been getting
far more attention than she deserved, and
left it at that.
There is a little more to it than that. I
started thinking about the whole thing
after dinner that night. Second thoughts
about Fonda and what she said led me to
see in her other, more valuable aspects.

One of the topics she touched on several
times was student apathy. I was impressed
with hervigorand initiative in pointing out
to us the injustices and contradictions in
our socio-economic system. Too often I
have seen students waste their intellectual
resources arguing over robber barons and
trees or whether to have a bonfire; Fonda, I
hope, has succeeded in pointing out
that they are other, much greater prob
lems outside of Stanford that require all
our energy and resources. I think it is im
portant to get this mental stimulus.
We at Stanford often get so caught up in
our work and play that the outside world
seems to fade into the back of our minds,

like a bad dream we don't want to wake up
to. Once out there, we tend to absorb
ourselves in the routine of work, play, eat
and sleep.
Occasionally, some will spend time
thinking about the various problems fac
ing us and work to solve them. Most of us
are not even aware of the problems that
exist, and sometimes it takes someone like
Fonda to shake us out of our reverie and
make us look at the world with both eyes
wide open.
All this is not to say that I agree with her
on her proposed solutions. For all her
qualities, )ane Fonda is among the leaders
of a trend — the trend toward easy solu
tions for incredibly complicated prob
lems, and the trend away from rational
consideration of those problems, possible

solutions and their consequences. Her
solutions are simplistic, overlooking im
portant qualifying factors and potential
consequences.
Forexample, Fonda ignores the fact that
a significant reduction in military spending
would require significant structural ad
justments in the international position of
the U.S. How is the government supposed
to maintain all its overseas security com
mitments with only half its present military
budget?
Of course, one can argue that we are
over-committed and should let |apan and
NATO stand on their own, but what are the
consequences of cutting off these com
mitments? It cannot be argued that peace
and prosperity will result. In this day of
diminishing resources and increased
competition for markets, there are too
many factors working against that stability
without some kind of deterent, however
questionable. What would the effects be
on those countries, like lapan and West
ern Europe, who depend on the U.S. for
their security needs? Are these countries
capable of assuring their own needs, and if
so, what would be the effects on the stabil
ity of their respective spheres of influ
ence?
Fonda sees many things wrong wtih our
society, our economy and our civilization
in general. Though her solutions are
simplistic, she plays a vital and necessary
role as the agitator, the cata\y<rt, \he
motivator for change.
For now, though, I for one hope that
Jane Fonda will continue to campaign for
the changes she sees as being needed.
Many times we are unaware of a problem,
and often it is only a matter of getting the
problem noticed by enough people be
fore a workable solution is proposed and
effected. So listen to her — )ane Fonda is
definitely worth listening to. But listen crit
ically — avoid her tendency toward
simplistic solutions: there are no simple
solutions, only intelligent choices,

consideration of those problems, possible

solutions and their consequences. Her
solutions are simplistic, overlooking im
portant qualifying factors and potential
consequences.
Forexample, Fonda ignores the fact that
a significant reduction in military spending
would require significant structural ad
justments in the international position of
the U.S. How is the government supposed
to maintain all its overseas security com
mitments with only half its present military
budget?
Of course, one can argue that we are
over-committed and should let |apan and
NATO stand on their own, but what are the
consequences of cutting off these com
mitments? It cannot be argued that peace
and prosperity will result. In this day of
diminishing resources and increased
competition for markets, there are too
many factors working against that stability
without some kind of deterent, however
questionable. What would the effects be
on those countries, like lapan and West
ern Europe, who depend on the U.S. for
their security needs? Are these countries
capable of assuring their own needs, and if
so, what would be the effects on the stabil
ity of their respective spheres of influ
ence?
Fonda sees many things wrong wtih our
society, our economy and our civilization
in general. Though her solutions are
simplistic, she plays a vital and necessary
role as the agitator, the cata\y<rt, \he
motivator for change.
For now, though, I for one hope that
Jane Fonda will continue to campaign for
the changes she sees as being needed.
Many times we are unaware of a problem,
and often it is only a matter of getting the
problem noticed by enough people be
fore a workable solution is proposed and
effected. So listen to her — )ane Fonda is
definitely worth listening to. But listen crit
ically — avoid her tendency toward
simplistic solutions: there are no simple
solutions, only intelligent choices,
(Mark Nassutti is a senior majoring in in

My first impression upon hearing |ane
Fonda speak last week was something ap
proaching disdain. A friend who went with
me to both her speech in White Plaza and
the seminar she held later at Cedro
Lounge burst into laughter at some of her
comments and statements. He finally left
after one particularly explosive outburst.
While I listened to her proposals for sol
ving the ills of society, I kept thinking to
myself "But . . . that's ridiculous! It'll
never work!" and so on and so forth. I
came away wondeirng about the intelli
gence of SCOPE for having invited her to
speak to a University audience. I felt al
most betrayed.

For all her qualities, Jane Fonda is among the
leaders of a trend - the trend towards easy
solutions for incredibly complicated problems
and the trend away from rational consideration of
those problems.

I, along with many others, went to hear
her out of curiosity. )ane Fonda was a sort
of enigma — she had a certain appeal. I
went hoping to hear a speech intelligently
conceived and thought out and an ideol
ogy I could understand and deal with on a
rational basis. When I left, I felt all I had
gotten was the unrestrained political and
emotional lambasting of some liberal
minded activist whose only real claim to
fame was her talent as an actress. I con
cluded that Jane Fonda had been getting
far more attention than she deserved, and
left it at that.
There is a little more to it than that. I
started thinking about the whole thing
after dinner that night. Second thoughts
about Fonda and what she said led me to
see in her other, more valuable aspects.

One of the topics she touched on several
times was student apathy. I was impressed
with hervigorand initiative in pointing out
to us the injustices and contradictions in
our socio-economic system. Too often I
have seen students waste their intellectual
resources arguing over robber barons and
trees or whether to have a bonfire; Fonda, I
hope, has succeeded in pointing out
that they are other, much greater prob
lems outside of Stanford that require all
our energy and resources. I think it is im
portant to get this mental stimulus.
We at Stanford often get so caught up in
our work and play that the outside world
seems to fade into the back of our minds,

like a bad dream we don't want to wake up
to. Once out there, we tend to absorb
ourselves in the routine of work, play, eat
and sleep.
Occasionally, some will spend time
thinking about the various problems fac
ing us and work to solve them. Most of us
are not even aware of the problems that
exist, and sometimes it takes someone like
Fonda to shake us out of our reverie and
make us look at the world with both eyes
wide open.
All this is not to say that I agree with her
on her proposed solutions. For all her
