Daily column
misleading
I write in response to a col
umn on the editorial page
(Daily, Oct. 30) in which
Richard Wohl alleged that I am
unwilling to meet my oppo
nent in the 21st Assembly Dis
trict race, Greg Morris, in a
one-to-one debate in the "an
cient Creek" style. I must re
spond that much of what Wohl
writes is inaccurate and mis
leading.
To date Morris and I have
appeared together in public a
total of at least seven times;
whether these meetings are
termed "debates," "joint ap
pearances," or something else
seems to me to be a matter of
semantics. I emphasize that I
have repeatedly debated the
issues with Morris at public
gatherings and will do so again
during the next week.
I would like to comment on
one instancewhere I did refuse
to appear with Morris. On
Sept. 27 I received a letter invit
ing me to debate Morris at a
luncheon meeting of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce.
That letter was signed by a per
son whose name is listed on
Morris' campaign stationery.
He is also pictured with Morris
in one of the Morris campaign
brochures. This is not to say
that I think the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce is par
tial toward Morris. However, I
chose not to appear at a forum
that was arranged by a leader of
the Morris campaign.
Finally, I would like to point
out that Wohl was present
when I visited the American
Studies House for two hours
on Oct. 26. At no time did Wohl
indicate that he was present as
a journalist and was in the pro
cess of writing a newspaper
column about the campaign.
Anyone familiar with journalis

tic ethics knows that Wohl had
an obligation both to inform
me that he was writing a story,
and to fully solicit my views on
the subject at hand. As a Stan
ford graduate, I closely follow
the Daily and have come to ex
pect higher standards.

Editor's Note: Richard Wohl
maintains that he told Calvo at
the start of the conversation
that he was writing an article on
the subject of debates.
The opinions section is the
one page we open up to the
Stanford community. Daily
columnists are not regular
members of the staff, but are
selected by us to represent dif
ferent viewpoints. Wohl was
not writing his column as a
journalist and a member of the
Daily staff but instead was
communicating his own per
sonal reflections on his rela
tions with the Calvo and Morris
campaigns. The Daily is neutral
with regard to Wohl's remarks
on the subject.

Real issues
ignored
On Wednesday, October 25,
the Daily reported on the front
page an account of what had
taken place at the l-Center the
day before. Anne Bowden,
who reported the incident,
concentrated only on what the
Iranian students did to prevent
the Tuesday luncheon speaker
from delivering his speech and
cause the cancellation of the
speech.
While she did not mention it,
the reader will conclude that
those Iranians do not under
stand, or else have no respect
for democracy and the free
dom of speech. Additionally,
they hurt their own cause by

not seizing upon this "creative
opportunity" as l-Center Di
rector Lee Zeigler put it (to
question the speaker), and by
losing some undecided listen
ers (who would support the
shah now as a result of the in
cident!)
Bowden failed or never actu
ally attempted to put things in
the right perspective. The issue
is not the pro and con of the
Shah of Iran and his policies.
The issue is the tortures, mass
killings and all sorts of human
miseries thrown upon the Ira
nian people by the shah since
his accession to the throne.
Particularly during the last few
weeks, the American news
media has ignored the facts
and described it as a religious
campaign against moderniza
tion.
This isaclearand grossinsult
to the American reader and his
intellectual capability. Who on
earth would believe that
thousands lose their lives just
to prevent "modernization"?
The truth of the matter is that
thousands of innocent Iranians
have been killed ruthlessly,
and many millions live in fear
and terror, under the shah's
repressive regime. Those many
courageous Iranians sacrifice
their lives to demand freedom,
justice and human dignity for
themselves and for future gen
erations. All of this is twisted or
ignored by the Western press.
Bowden, even in an
academic community such as
Stanford, chooses to follow
suit and ignore the underlying
facts, which does a disservice
to all people who want to know
the truth.
Bowden, furthermore, re
ports the topic as "Causes and
Effects of the Contemporary
Political Crisis," which sounds
relevant to the recent crisis and
makes the reader wonder why
the Iranians were dissatisfied.
The topic was to have been

"Iran: Island of Stability or Im
pending Volcano," which is
general and does not address
the present problem. That is
why some Iranian students
questioned the whole matter.
Finally, and more impor
tantly, Bowden quotes Zeigler,
as saying he had not known
that the speaker, Professor
SepehrZabin, is a shah suppor
ter. If this were true, then
Zeigler or the l-Center is to be
blamed for not bothering to
know enough about who to in
vite and what to talk about.
However, if he had known
about where this speaker's
loyalty lay, then he should have
chosen a topic related to a vital
issue confronting Iran today
such as the recent uprising.
The Iranian students did not
and do not want to deprive
anyone of his or her right to
speak. Rather they knew that
by inviting a shah's puppet
whose main task was to mistify
the issues and mislead the
Stanford community, the
l-Center, was, actually, reflect
ing Washington's policies to
wards Iran and the rest of the
Thrid World, and they wanted
to voice their opposition to it.
The real issues in Iran today
are oppression, torture, mas
sive starvation, corruption,
massive spending on arms, in
flation, U.S. intervention, CIA
penetration, foreign business
monopoly and so on. The
shah's "modernization"
scheme is nothing but an
example of how the multi
national businesses (mostly
U.S.) and a few natives benefit
from the country's wealth. De
spite all this, President Jimmy
Carter telephoned the shah to
express his moral support (ap
parently for killing so many),
and the l-Center brings in
someone to praise the shah.
The cancellation of the pre
sentation cannot and should
not, therefore, be blamed on

the Iranian students. Rather,
the blame, should fall on
Zeigler and the I-Center for
choosing to ignore the real is
sues of the moment.

Editor's note: Our reporter,
Anne Bowden, was not as
signed to analyze the political
climate in Iran today. She was
to cover a particular speech
which was interrupted by a
group of Iranian students. Her
coverage of the event was ac
curate and fair.

Must be
somebody else
May I please correct a state
ment by Henry Organ, pub
lished in the Daily of October
24, in an article entitled "Re
percussions of the Bakke
Case"? Organ states, I do not
know why, that my "attitude
. . . about black people is
known to many black workers
at the Palo Alto V.A. Hospital."
I have never worked at the
Palo Alto V.A. Hospital, nor
have I ever had any interac
tions with non-faculty
employees at that hospital. In
all the institutions I have
worked, my interactions with,
and attitude about, all workers,
black and others, have always
been peaceful and friendly. I
have not the faintest idea of
what Organ is talking about.
Presumably he must be mixing
me up with somebody else.

More controversy
There's been a number of
controversial pieces in the
Daily recently. Tim Davis's col
umn on "sheepish liberalism"

(Daily, Oct. 25) was no excep
tion. Even more offensive than
his claim that "homosexuals al
ready have their freedom"
were his outrageous reactio
nary (yes, reactionary) attitudes
toward a woman's "sole right"
to her own body. As Davis has
no need to worry about he
himself becoming pregnant
because he failed to exercise
self-control, I feel it is rather
presumptuous of him to dis
cuss equal rights for pregnant
women. It is also downright
rude of him to label a woman
with an unwanted pregnancy

as the careless partner.
And as for the "freedom" of
homosexuals (or any other
"oppressed" minority), there
can be no such thing until any
one can obtain the job he or
she is qualified for regardless
of sexual persuasion.
