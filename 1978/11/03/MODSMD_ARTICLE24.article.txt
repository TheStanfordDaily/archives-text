# Political scandal-makers running, not on the run in election

Wilkes-Barre, Pa. (AP) — Last time around,
they fled Washington and politics, or were
pushed out.
Wayne Hays gave up 30 years in Congress
and returned to his native Ohio rather than
face those who accused him of keeping his
mistress on the congressional payroll.
Wilbur Mills forfeited his chairmanship of
the House Ways and Means Committee
when he attempted to launch "Fanne Fox,
the Argentine bombshell" into movies, and
pulled out of the House entirely after admit
ting to alcoholism.
Allan T. Howe, a Democratic congressman
from Utah, was abandoned by party leaders
and voters after being convicted of soliciting
an undercover policewoman.
But this year's crop of Washington
scandal-makers are standing fast and hoping
for re-election in" November despite the
headlines.
Camble paying off
Their gamble seems to be paying off. An
inquiry by The Associated Press suggests
that the folks back home have developed a
high tolerance for the wrongdoings of their
elected officials.
Several congressmen who have admitted

to, been convicted of, or indicted on various
charges seem certain of re-election.
"Wayne Hays' mistake was that he ran
away," said Lou Cordon, press aide to one of
the most controversial congressmen, Fre
derick W. Richmond, 54, of New York, who
admitted he solicited "with payment of
money" sexual relations with a 16-year-old
boy and an undercover policeman.
Richmond handily won his September prim
ary, and is seen as the likely victor in
November.
Similarly confident are the backers of
Daniel Flood, 74, the mustachioed, long
term congressman from Pennsylvania's
Wyoming Valley, who has been charged
with 13 felony counts.
'Newspaper talk'
"It's all newspaper talk," said Wilkes-
Barre jeweler Bernard Bartkiowsky, chair
man of a "Trust Flood" campaign to raise
$250,000 for his defense. "If he was shady in
any way, I would have nothing to do with
him," said the wealthy jeweler, who
brushed aside charges that the congressman
lied under oath, accepted $65,000 in payoffs
and 100 shares of bank stock from eight
sources since 1971, and sought another

$100,000 from a developer in his home dis
trict.
Rep. Charles C. Diggs (D-Mich.) the
senior black man in Congress, was con
victed in October on all 29 counts of mail
fraud and illegally diverting more than
$60,000 of a congressional employee's salary
to pay his personal bills. He faces five years
imprisonment on each count and up to
$191,000 in fines, but Diggs expects to be
re-elected next week to his 13th term.
A dozen other legislators are also trying to
ride out the political firestorms brought
about by what many of them perceive as a
post-Watergate moral crusade. They in
clude:
— Three California congressmen who re
ceived House reprimands following the
"Koreagate" probe into South Korean
influence-buying: Reps. John J. McFall, Ed
ward R. Roybal and Charles H. Wilson.
— Six-term Rep. Joshua Eilberg (D-Pa.),
indicted on charges of receiving compensa
tion for helping a Philadelphia hospital pro
ject obtain federal funds.
— U.S. Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.), the
first black senator since 1880, who has been
haunted by the fallout from a bitter divorce

battle, and has been under investigation by
the Senate Ethics committee. He seems to be
the one in the most trouble with voters.
— Six-term Rep. Herbert Burke (R-Fla.),
who has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
charges of being disorderly and resisting ar
rest at a Fort Lauderdale bar featuring nude
dancers.
Hays back
Even Wayne Hays is back, this time run
ning for the Ohio Legislature.
While the number of besmirched officials
seeking re-election is much higher this year
than normal, there are many precedents in
American political history.
One case often mentioned to show voter
tolerance is the colorful mayor of Boston,
James M. Curley, who in 1946 ran for re
election from prison, where he was serving
time for federal mail fraud. He won handily
and was later released to fulfill his mayoral
duties.
Rep. Flood best fits the Curley mold this
year, the hometown boy pushed around by
the feds. "The peoplewill go all theway with
Flood. They don't believe the indictments,"
commented a Wilkes-Barre editor, adding
that Flood, the county's "most powerful

man," retains the common touch by living in
a working class neighborhood.
Flood responsible
"He is in a large measure responsible for
our very existence," said lawyer John
Moses, referring to Flood's work in helping
the area rebuild from the devastation of
tropical storm Agnes in 1972.
One important factor in Flood's continued
support is that he still delivers. Wilkes-Barre
has gotten $16 million in federal grants
within the past few weeks.
Similar clout in Congress is seen as one
reason why Rep. Richmond survived his
primary race in Brooklyn even though he
was publicly accused of being a "child mo
lester." In politics, a morals charge has usu
ally proved fatal, but Richmond is expected
to retain his seat mainly because community
leaders saw that his colleagues in Congress
and the New York Democratic establish
ment generally supported him.
Detroit's Rep. Diggs has ties as tight with
his own county as Flood has with Wilkes-
Barre, having served since 1955. Diggs' sup
porters charge that he has been singled out
by the "white establishment" for prosecu
tion because of his seniority in Congress.
