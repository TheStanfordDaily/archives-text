# Stanford seeks sounds of silence against Trojans
## Cards aim to mute offensive symphony as they tune up for USC; Trojans, however, sound impressive as they march into Palo Alto snorts Canned food drive 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The hoofbeats of Traveler 111 still ring in
the ears of Stanford football players. The
strains of "Conquest" still haunt the Car
dinals. TheTommyTrojan-laden stall
ion and the cardinal and gold bedecked
'SC marching band thundered through
seven touchdown celebrations last Nov. 5
when the Trojans humiliated Stanford 49-0
in the L.A. Coliseum.
To silence the brassy Sousaphiles to
morrow when the Trojans parade into
Stanford Stadium for a 1 p.m. contest, the
Cardinals, 5-3 overall, 2-2 in the Pac-10,
must mute the offensive explosiveness of
Charles White and the Pac-10's most pro
lific rushing attack.
USC, 6-1 on the season, 3-1 in confer
ence, brings its usual army of talent to the
Mid-Peninsula. Asked whether the Tro
jans appeared to have any weaknesses fol
lowing his team's 38-7 loss to the Los Ange
lens, Oregon State coach Craig Fertig re
sponded: "Yes, we did find one weakness
— their equipment manager is Polish. No,
really, I think the horse slowed up at the
end of the game."
"This is a typical USC team," Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said. "They have great
size and awesome talent."
Most visible amid the 'SC cornucopia is
tailback Charles White. The elusive junior
rushed for 126 yards and scored three TDs
against Stanford in last year's carnage. The
nation's No. 3 rusher this season, White
has rushed for 144.3 yards a game and
scored eight TDs. He leads the nation in
all-purpose yardage with 175.3 yards a
game.
White's running mate, fullback Lynn
Cain, has rushed f0r523 yards — including
133 yards last week against California — on
97 carries for a 5.4 yard average.
Directing the Trojan attack, junior QB
Paul McDonald now tops the Pac-10 in
passing, according to the complex rating
system used by the conference. The first
year starter has completed 64 of 123 passes
(52.0 percent) for 12 touchdowns afid six
interceptions.
"Their passing game is dangerous with
such great speed at receivers," Walsh said.
"Their quarterback throws it long and
every game they seem to score on a long

pass play.
"One of their receivers, Kevin Williams,
will be the fastest man on the field," Walsh
added.
Williams, who finished sixth in the
NCAA 100 meters last spring, has caught 12
passes for seven touchdowns. Split end
Calvin Sweeney leads the Trojans with 17
receptions for 288 yards.
McDonald stands behind an offensive
line which has been wracked by injuries
(eight linemen have been injured at some
point or another, including five centers)
which would have decimated a lesser
team. Trojan coach John Robinson, how
ever, continues to tap a seemingly in
exhaustible reservoir of talented big
people to fill any holes.
The unenviable task of defending the
Trojans has been complicated by an injury
to inside linebacker Cordy Ceresino,
which may sideline Stanford's career tackl
ing leader. Craig Zellman replaced Cere
sino in the second quarter last week and
ended the game with a team high of 15
tackles.
The puzzle of how to stop the Trojans
equals the labyrinthine problem the Tro
jans face in trying to neutralize the Stan
ford passing game.
Stanford quarterback Steve Dils has led
the nation in passing since the first week of
the season and has now completed 194 of
300 passes (64.7 percent) f0r2257 yards, 18
touchdowns and 14 interceptions.
Much-maligned earlier in the season for
throwing too many interceptions, Dils has
the/owest interception percentage among
starting quarterbacks in the conference.
Dils' targets include the Pac-10's three
leading receivers, Phil Francis (49 recep
tions), Darrin Nelson (41) and Ken
Margerum (37).
Francis, however, sprained his ankle last
week and may not play tomorrow.
Taking Francis' place in the starting
lineup is Gordon Banks. He takes his place
along side Nelson, Stanford's leading
rusher with 777 yards on 120 carries and a
Pac-10-leading 6.5 yard average. Nelson is
second to White nationally in all-purpose
yardage with 17.3 yards a game.
The presence of Banks in the starting
lineup and USC across the line of scrim

mage has led to some new twists in the
already varied Stanford offense. Stanford
will attempt to blend some new looks with
the old.
"For example," Banks said, "if we run a
new play, it will be from a formation
they've seen. If we run an old play, it may
be from a formation they've never seen
before."
"We can't just throw the ball all day,"
Walsh said. "We have to mix it up and
work for a balanced attack.
"If Francis doesn't play, then we'll lean
more to the passing game. But we have to
keep running, even if its just for a couple
yards a play, to keep the passing game
open."
The Trojan pass defense averages an in
terception for every 10 passes thrown its
way and last year pirated four Guy Benja
min aerials as they blanked the Stanford
offense.
"It's the best pass defense we've played
against this year," Walsh said.
"Washington was supposed to be the
best, but 'SC has a much better defense.
"Their defensive backs are big and they
hit when they tackle,' Walsh added.
Should the Southern Cal defense stop
the Stanford offense, the Cardinals will
send out the punting team and then hold
their breath.
"You're always suspect when it's hap
pened before," Walsh said, "and we've
had three blocked. Every time they go out
there we have to be concerned."
Last week punter Ken Naber got off
eight punts cleanly fora 39.5 yard average.
To erase last year's embarrassment, all
phases of the Stanford game must be in
sync.
When asked if revenge for last year's
game might be a factor Saturday, Walsh
said, "If we had the USC team playing
Stanford, we could talk revenge. We just
want to stay in the game. Revenge should
not affect either team."
Maybe not, but strangely enough there
exists a unanimity among Stanford players
that they will have no problems with the
flatness they had last week against Ore
gon.
Any flatness will be removed by a few
bars of "Conquest."

The Delta Tau Delta frater
nity is sponsoring a canned
food drive at tomorrow's foot
ball game against USC. The
Delts are collecting cans of
food for needy senior citizens
of the Bay Area.
Stanford football followers
are asked to deposit contribu
tions in the collection barrels
which will be located at each
gate into the stadium.
The canned food drive is
being run in conjunction with
the Food Bank of San )ose. The
annual food drive comes to
Stanford Stadium each year
when one of Stanford's South
ern California Pac-10 oppo
nents comes to town.
