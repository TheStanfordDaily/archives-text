# Hal announces Pacific-10 finals; also gives key halftime results
## 
### 
Monday through Friday freshman En
glish instructors try, often in vain, to
elucidate the difference between the
active voice and the passive voice. On
Saturday, however, as Stanford
Stadium fills and your beer keg
empties, the difference becomes un
mistakeably clear.
First, the passive voice. The opposing
team's band announcer, a speech de
partment dropout who inevitably
sounds as if his pants are three sizes too
small, takes the microphone and, in a
synchronized effort with his band, puts

everyong to sleep.
Now, the active voice. With unimita
ble elocution, which rouses the slum
bering student section, LSJUMB Band
Announcer Hal Michelson sends the
Band into action and the crowd into
paroxysms of orgiastic ecstasy.
Michelson, a '71 Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Stanford, also happens to
be on the Daily board of directors and,
being an incestuous bunch, we take
care of our own. We have invited him to
be our Cuest Creek of the Week. So
take it over Hal — you old Greek, you.

"Kelly James, the musical director at
UCLA, told us that the bands down in
Cactusland are even more Sousafied
than the Big 10. We've heard that Zona
has a "drill consultant" who is wanted
somewhere for war crimes. Now that's
the kind of information you need to
pick this week's winners. Our prognos
tications follow:
"1. Zona State thinks that Berkeley
represents High Culture so they're
doing a heavy musical show— the over
ture and highlights from Naughty
Marietta. This should fire up their fans
and make their team ready to kill some
body. We foretell grim times for the
Golden Fleabags. Arizona State 35, Cal
13.
"2. No one from Tucson has any idea
how much it can and will rain onthem in
Seattle. The Dogs will win in a snore
fest. Washington 14, Arizona 7.
"3. The Bruin Band couldn't care less
about the game with Oregon. As far as
we know, they're taking the day off and
calling in the Kilgore Rangerettes. We
think that the second and third strings
will be too busy waving at the cameras
to score very many touchdowns for the
Power Blue. UCLA 27, Oregon 10.
"4. A weekend in Pullman would be
far too dull even for the Beaver Band;
they're staying home this Saturday.
Their manager told us that he needed
the time to study for an "arithmetic
quiz" and to write a three-sentence
essay for his class fn Remedial Personal
Development. By the way, the Oregon
State Band director told them not to
ingest any of the trick-or-threats they
picked up from our drum section last
weekend — not until the analysis came
back from the FBI. Washington State
will romp. WSU 30, Oregon State 3.
"5. The Mighty Trees will of course
prevail over the lowest form of life, the
comtemptible University of Second
Choice. You've probably heard that an
Arab prince has bought most of the real
estate south of 28th Street and north of
Exposition Park. The papier-mache
helmets and the Trojan horse will be
replaced by burnooses and a dromed
ary. If the prince thinks that pigskin is
unspeakably filthy, they'll have to kick
around an old bag stuffed with money.
(And, speaking of old bags stuffed with
money, let's be nice to the SC alumni
for a change.) Stanford 27, USC 24.
"Well, kids, that's it. More than ev
erything we know about this week's
gridiron action and halftime prospects.
Don't bet your tuition money."

Hal Michelson
Guest Greek of the Week
Monday through Friday freshman En
glish instructors try, often in vain, to
elucidate the difference between the
active voice and the passive voice. On
Saturday, however, as Stanford
Stadium fills and your beer keg
empties, the difference becomes un
mistakeably clear.
First, the passive voice. The opposing
team's band announcer, a speech de
partment dropout who inevitably
sounds as if his pants are three sizes too
small, takes the microphone and, in a
synchronized effort with his band, puts

everyong to sleep.
Now, the active voice. With unimita
ble elocution, which rouses the slum
bering student section, LSJUMB Band
Announcer Hal Michelson sends the
Band into action and the crowd into
paroxysms of orgiastic ecstasy.
Michelson, a '71 Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Stanford, also happens to
be on the Daily board of directors and,
being an incestuous bunch, we take
care of our own. We have invited him to
be our Cuest Creek of the Week. So
take it over Hal — you old Greek, you.

"Kelly James, the musical director at
UCLA, told us that the bands down in
Cactusland are even more Sousafied
than the Big 10. We've heard that Zona
has a "drill consultant" who is wanted
somewhere for war crimes. Now that's
the kind of information you need to
pick this week's winners. Our prognos
tications follow:
"1. Zona State thinks that Berkeley
represents High Culture so they're
doing a heavy musical show— the over
ture and highlights from Naughty
Marietta. This should fire up their fans
and make their team ready to kill some
body. We foretell grim times for the
Golden Fleabags. Arizona State 35, Cal
13.
"2. No one from Tucson has any idea
how much it can and will rain onthem in
Seattle. The Dogs will win in a snore
fest. Washington 14, Arizona 7.
"3. The Bruin Band couldn't care less
about the game with Oregon. As far as
we know, they're taking the day off and
calling in the Kilgore Rangerettes. We
think that the second and third strings
will be too busy waving at the cameras
to score very many touchdowns for the
Power Blue. UCLA 27, Oregon 10.
"4. A weekend in Pullman would be
far too dull even for the Beaver Band;
they're staying home this Saturday.
Their manager told us that he needed
the time to study for an "arithmetic
quiz" and to write a three-sentence
essay for his class fn Remedial Personal
Development. By the way, the Oregon
State Band director told them not to
ingest any of the trick-or-threats they
picked up from our drum section last
weekend — not until the analysis came
back from the FBI. Washington State
will romp. WSU 30, Oregon State 3.
"5. The Mighty Trees will of course
prevail over the lowest form of life, the
comtemptible University of Second
Choice. You've probably heard that an
Arab prince has bought most of the real
estate south of 28th Street and north of
Exposition Park. The papier-mache
helmets and the Trojan horse will be
replaced by burnooses and a dromed
ary. If the prince thinks that pigskin is
unspeakably filthy, they'll have to kick
around an old bag stuffed with money.
(And, speaking of old bags stuffed with
money, let's be nice to the SC alumni
for a change.) Stanford 27, USC 24.
"Well, kids, that's it. More than ev
erything we know about this week's
gridiron action and halftime prospects.
Don't bet your tuition money."
