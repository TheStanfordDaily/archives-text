# Protesters harass McCloskey at national service plan debate
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Shouting "racist," more than 25
minority students'stormed out of
Kresge Auditorium last night in op
position to Rep. Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) and his national ser
vice plan.
After the heated name-calling de
monstration and a short skit per
formed by several black and chicano
students, McCloskey debated his
proposed program with his two Dis
trict 12 challengers — Democrat
Kirsten Olsen and Peace and Free
dom Party candidate Adele Fumino.
The Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education (SCOPE) sponsored
the 1 1 /2-hour debate. Alex Alben,
SCOPE co-director said that although
the organization believes in free
speech, "we hope that in the future
everybody's right to express them
selves will be respected, including
the panel of candidates," as opposed
to the audience members.
McCloskey clarified statements he
made here two weeks ago when he
said the armed forces contained no
"reasonable" men.
"Let me ask how many reasonable
young men there are in this room
tonight — black, white or chicano —
who would choose to spend two
years running 20 miles a day and pre
paring themselves to fight on 24
hours notice," he told the 400 listen
ers.
Reasonable people?
"I would say that this is the last
place in the country where we would
say that reasonable young people
want to join the military service.
"Do we want to take the chance
that our army will not be made up of
the most reasonable young people?
Should we not look to an army that is
a reasonable cross-section of the
American people?"
McCloskey was asked to explain
another statement he made regard
ing the "dangers" of an all-black
army.

"No one group — whether they be
all-whites, all-blacks or all-Irish —»
should be carrying all the weapons in
the military," he said.
Regarding an all-professional
army, McCloskey said, "I think that
in a democracy the danger of an all
professional army is manifest, and I
would much prefer that an army be
made up of people who would go in
for two years, not people who go in
and make it their careers."
McCloskey's national service plan
calls for mandatory labor by all 18-
year-olds. Those who go into the
military for one year would receive
four years free college education 1 ,
while those choosing to remain civi
lians would work for the government
in hospitals, forests or as agricultural
laborers.
Different approach
Kirsten Olsen had an entirely diffe
rent suggestion for the military situa

tion.
"I think the first people who
should be drafted are the politicians
and the diplomats," the stock firm
employee said. "They're the ones
who make the wars and the police
action.
"I'm tired of being the policeman
of the world fighting the civil wars of
other countries," she added.
Fumino too, argued against
McCloskey's national service plan,
because "the United States still has
the most powerful forces in the
world. An appeal to militarism is an
appeal from weakness, not from
strength."
Fumino, a technical writer, also
urged the government to cut the $118
billion defense budget "in these days
of limited spending. The only single
thing they cut out of that budget (this
year) was money for abortions for
women in the service."

dom Party candidate Adele Fumino.
The Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education (SCOPE) sponsored
the 1 1 /2-hour debate. Alex Alben,
SCOPE co-director said that although
the organization believes in free
speech, "we hope that in the future
everybody's right to express them
selves will be respected, including
the panel of candidates," as opposed
to the audience members.
McCloskey clarified statements he
made here two weeks ago when he
said the armed forces contained no
"reasonable" men.
"Let me ask how many reasonable
young men there are in this room
tonight — black, white or chicano —
who would choose to spend two
years running 20 miles a day and pre
paring themselves to fight on 24
hours notice," he told the 400 listen
ers.
Reasonable people?
"I would say that this is the last
place in the country where we would
say that reasonable young people
want to join the military service.
"Do we want to take the chance
that our army will not be made up of
the most reasonable young people?
Should we not look to an army that is
a reasonable cross-section of the
American people?"
McCloskey was asked to explain
another statement he made regard
ing the "dangers" of an all-black
army.

"No one group — whether they be
all-whites, all-blacks or all-Irish —»
should be carrying all the weapons in
the military," he said.
Regarding an all-professional
army, McCloskey said, "I think that
in a democracy the danger of an all
professional army is manifest, and I
would much prefer that an army be
made up of people who would go in
for two years, not people who go in
and make it their careers."
McCloskey's national service plan
calls for mandatory labor by all 18-
year-olds. Those who go into the
military for one year would receive
four years free college education 1 ,
while those choosing to remain civi
lians would work for the government
in hospitals, forests or as agricultural
laborers.
Different approach
Kirsten Olsen had an entirely diffe
rent suggestion for the military situa

tion.
"I think the first people who
should be drafted are the politicians
and the diplomats," the stock firm
employee said. "They're the ones
who make the wars and the police
action.
"I'm tired of being the policeman
of the world fighting the civil wars of
other countries," she added.
Fumino too, argued against
McCloskey's national service plan,
because "the United States still has
the most powerful forces in the
world. An appeal to militarism is an
appeal from weakness, not from
strength."
Fumino, a technical writer, also
urged the government to cut the $118
billion defense budget "in these days
of limited spending. The only single
thing they cut out of that budget (this
year) was money for abortions for
women in the service."
Shouting "racist," more than 25
minority students'stormed out of
Kresge Auditorium last night in op
position to Rep. Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) and his national ser
vice plan.
After the heated name-calling de
monstration and a short skit per
formed by several black and chicano
students, McCloskey debated his
proposed program with his two Dis
trict 12 challengers — Democrat
Kirsten Olsen and Peace and Free
dom Party candidate Adele Fumino.
