## Poloists host LBS, 'physical' 'SC

With just three weekends left in the 1978 Pacific-10 water polo
season, the conference-leading Stanford Cardinals host Long
Beach State and second-place Pac-10 rival USC at deCuerre pool
this weekend.
Today at 3 p.m., Stanford battles the Long Beach State 49ers — a
team that just last week took California into overtime before
being edged by the Bears. The following day, the Cards beat the
49ers in Long Beach, 10-4.
"I expect a tougher game from them this time," said Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti. "We surprised them last time. They
showed their true capabilities when they took Cal into overtime."
"We're going to have to do an excellent job defensively be
cause they have some very good offensive players," Dettamanti
added. "They've got one of the better freshman players — Bob
Dolan. He can put the ball in the goal."
One of the Cards responsible for defense will be goalie Vince
Vannelli, who is getting the starting call for the second time this
year.
"Our whole team is aware of Dolan," VAnnelli said. "John
(Gansel) and I will be more aware of his outside arm."
The Trojans, meanwhile, after facing Cal today in Berkeley, will

invade the Farm tomorrow for a 10 a.m. game.
According to most members of the Cardinal team, tomorrow's
game will best be described by one word — physical.
"It's always physical," said senior Tom Angelo. "The game just
gets more intense right away(againsl USC)."
According to Dettamanti, the looser officiating in Northern
California helps the Trojans more than it does Stanford.
"We have to keep our cool," he said. "Playing more physically
doesn't mean you're going to win the game. We've got to play our
game and not get drawn into it (the physical part)."
Bearing a large part of the physical burden will be freshman
hole man Jody Campbell.
"I don't think they'reany more physical in the hole than Cal is,"
said Campbell. "They just do more things that are gross. They
don't have as much finesse."
The difference between Cal and USC, according to senior
Doug Burke, is that USC might "hityouforthe hell of it. With Cal,
the hitting is just competitive.play."
"They (USC) are a very emotional team," said Dettamanti. "If
you get ahead of them early, they get down on themselves. Some
of their players are foul-prone — we'll definitely be working on
them."
