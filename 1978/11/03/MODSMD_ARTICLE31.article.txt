## 
### JULIE HILL 
A drained Cardinal field
hockey team perked up in the
last two minutes of Wednes
day's game to prevent a tie with
Sacramento State, by grabbing
a 2-1 victory.
'• The win, which boosts Stan
ford's season record to 7-2-5,
"almost assures us of a berth"
in the regionals, according to
head coach Barbara
Longstreth.
Kelly Westerwick scored
and yet, we were able to win a
game when we couldn't play
well." She felt this was indica

tive of the type of team Stan
ford is and was pleased to add
that "it looks real good" for re
both goals for the Cards. The
first was an individual effort
mid-way into the first half. The
Hornets scored next off a "dis
puted" penalty stroke call on
Buffie Bergerwith five minutes
to go in the game. But the de
termined Stanford scotchers
came right back, forced a
corner kick and Westerwick
scored again off a deflected
Nancy White shot.
Coach Longstreth said about
the game, "We were very flat

gionals. She also singled out
the effectiveness of sweeper
Jeanine Valadez.
One fact which should help
the Region-8 Sports Commit
tee pick two teams for the at
large spots on Sunday is what
Stanford has done since Oct. 7,
the day of the San Jose State
match. The Cards' record at
that time was 1-2-2 — since
then they've added six wins, no
losses and three ties.
The junior varsity team did
not fare so well Wednesday,
losing 3-1 to American River,
with Veronica Vella scoring the
lone Stanford goal.
