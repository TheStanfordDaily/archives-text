# Lodge ignites Cards at half
## Booters vivisect USC, 4-1 
### DEAN EYRE 
Whenever Stanford and USC
meet in head-to-head competi
tion there is a certain anticipa
tion in the air. Yesterday was
no exception as Stanford won
its final home soccer appear
ance of this season, beating
USC, 4-1.
While the match promised to
be exciting because of the
schools' rivalry, the anticipa
tion quickly soured as the
Cards played a first half that
was as flat as warm beer. The
Trojans made convincing
threats at the goal, unlike the
Cardinals, who found them
selves tripping over their own
feet in uncapitalized oppor
tunities.
With 16 minutes remaining
in the first period, Steve Legg
put the Trojans ahead and it
seemed as though Stanford
was in for a long, disappointing
afternoon. The lack of intensity
could very well have cost the

Cards the game if it weren't for
an emotional halftime re
primand from the coaches.
"It was the worst play I've
seen in many years as far as any
Stanford team," said Stanford
coach Neslon Lodge. "It was
purely a mental thing — there
was no emotion, no desire. I
can see it happening in one or
two players but I was really
frightened because it caught
on to 11 players."
The football version of a
chalk talk did a world of good,
for, a/a Knute Rockne, the
coaches inspired the lackluster
Cards into playing up to their
capabilities.
"What turned the game
around was the halftime,
Lodge said. "I very rarely get
emotional because I'm dealing
with a very rational type of boy.
I just told them that the game
they were playing was rubbish
and that if they're not going to
play well they're going to sit on

the bench. They came out and
seven minutes later there were
two goals in the net."
"The coach had to really kick
our bottoms to get us going,"
said Ted Rafalovich.
"There was just no compari
son (between the halves)" as
sistant coach Phil Wright said.
"I was quite surprised to see us
come out so flat.
"They came out second half
very ready. I went out right be
fore the second half started
and simply said to the starting
eleven, The first guy (I see)
walking and there's no reason,
I'm pulling you — that's it and
you won't go back in.'
"We were behind 1 -0, it was
a crucial game and there are 20
people on the bench who want
to play," Wright added.
Senior Laird Cagan started
the Cards on the comeback
trail, putting in a goal four mi
nutes into the second half with
an assist by Rafalovich. In three

minutes, Cagan added a sec
ond score. Paul Kozachenko
and Dan McNevin gave a dou
ble assist to Rafalovich to put
Stanford ahead 3-1 still only 17
minutes into the final half. The
final tally for the Cards came
seven minutes later as
Rafalovich fed the ball to Jack
McCannon.
Stanford, now with a 15-5
mark, travels to Berkeley to
morrow fora 1:30 p.m. contest
with California. "I think it's
going to be close — I would
have to say it would be 1-0 and
tenser than hell," Lodge said.
"You could cut the air with a
knife because it's the last game
of the year for us. If we beat
Berkeley we still have an out
side chance (for post-season
consideration) according to
Cliff McGrath who's the head
rater at Seattle Pacific.
"It's still not a good season
until we beat Berkeley," he ad
ded.

Mike Knowles crashes the goal area as Paul Kozachenko sets to head the ball in yesterday's match with
USC. The Cards exploded for all four of their goals in 19 minutes to erase a 1-0 Trojan lead. The Cards
are now 15-5.
Whenever Stanford and USC
meet in head-to-head competi
tion there is a certain anticipa
tion in the air. Yesterday was
no exception as Stanford won
its final home soccer appear
ance of this season, beating
USC, 4-1.
While the match promised to
be exciting because of the
schools' rivalry, the anticipa
tion quickly soured as the
Cards played a first half that
was as flat as warm beer. The
Trojans made convincing
threats at the goal, unlike the
Cardinals, who found them
selves tripping over their own
feet in uncapitalized oppor
tunities.
With 16 minutes remaining
in the first period, Steve Legg
put the Trojans ahead and it
seemed as though Stanford
was in for a long, disappointing
afternoon. The lack of intensity
could very well have cost the

Cards the game if it weren't for
an emotional halftime re
primand from the coaches.
"It was the worst play I've
seen in many years as far as any
Stanford team," said Stanford
coach Neslon Lodge. "It was
purely a mental thing — there
was no emotion, no desire. I
can see it happening in one or
two players but I was really
frightened because it caught
on to 11 players."
The football version of a
chalk talk did a world of good,
for, a/a Knute Rockne, the
coaches inspired the lackluster
Cards into playing up to their
capabilities.
"What turned the game
around was the halftime,
Lodge said. "I very rarely get
emotional because I'm dealing
with a very rational type of boy.
I just told them that the game
they were playing was rubbish
and that if they're not going to
play well they're going to sit on

the bench. They came out and
seven minutes later there were
two goals in the net."
"The coach had to really kick
our bottoms to get us going,"
said Ted Rafalovich.
"There was just no compari
son (between the halves)" as
sistant coach Phil Wright said.
"I was quite surprised to see us
come out so flat.
"They came out second half
very ready. I went out right be
fore the second half started
and simply said to the starting
eleven, The first guy (I see)
walking and there's no reason,
I'm pulling you — that's it and
you won't go back in.'
"We were behind 1 -0, it was
a crucial game and there are 20
people on the bench who want
to play," Wright added.
Senior Laird Cagan started
the Cards on the comeback
trail, putting in a goal four mi
nutes into the second half with
an assist by Rafalovich. In three

minutes, Cagan added a sec
ond score. Paul Kozachenko
and Dan McNevin gave a dou
ble assist to Rafalovich to put
Stanford ahead 3-1 still only 17
minutes into the final half. The
final tally for the Cards came
seven minutes later as
Rafalovich fed the ball to Jack
McCannon.
Stanford, now with a 15-5
mark, travels to Berkeley to
morrow fora 1:30 p.m. contest
with California. "I think it's
going to be close — I would
