# Spikers travel south for UCLA net invite
## 
### JEFF POWELL 
Don't look for Liz Hughes, Shawn Hoover, Jane Bassett, Jan
Linden or any other members of the women's volleyball team to
be watching the USC-Stanford football game on Saturday. In
stead, they'll be down in Los Angeles as the spikers participate in
the 11th annual UCLA Invitational Tournament opening this even
ing and concluding late tomorrow night.
Twenty-three other teams plan to be there also, drawn from
nine states and Canada. The tourney is divided into four divisions
of six teams apiece and the Cardinals find themselves in an
exceedingly tough pool. Within their division, the Cards face the
likes of nationally ranked Hawaii and Long Beach State.
UC-Riverside, Arizona State and Illinois-Chicago Circle round
out the pool. This bracket is played in round-robin fashion.
From there, they must finish first or second in order to move on
to the resulting quarterfinals beginning Saturday afternoon.
However, the competition is stiff. According to assistant coach
John Bekins, the UCLA Tournament is "a prestigious tournament
and most good teams in the nation venture to Southern California
to play."
In fact, the top eight teams in the nation are entered. Unde
feated and nationally No. 1 ranked Utah State is the odds-on
favorite. Yet No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 USC, with ample hometown
support, are not to be taken lightly. USC is both the defending
national champion and the returning tournament champ.
Up to this, the 11th year of the tourney, the first 10 winners have
eventually gone on to capture the AIAW Championship, only
adding to the excitement of this weekend.
A good showing is essential for the spikers to keep their slim
hopes for a regional berth flickering. Most likely, their only
chance to receive consideration would be to pull a major upset.
The spikers will have plenty of opportunity here. Both Hawaii and
Long Beach State are nationally ranked: Hawaii, No. 5, and Long
Beach, No. 8. Moreover, Hawaii was rated No. 1 in the preseason.
Hawaii is the first match for the women tonight at 7 p.m. while
Long Beach State represents the next obstacle a mere hour later.
