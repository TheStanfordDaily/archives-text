"This is it; this is the big
one," said Stanford women's
cross country coach Laurel
Treon of Saturday's WAIAW
Regional Cross Country Meet
to be hosted by Long Beach
State.
The 5,000-meter event at El
Dorado Park in Long Beach,
will determine which three
teams and 10 individuals will
represent Region 8 in the na
tionals on Nov. 18 in Denver,
Colo. Region 8 is made up of
teams from California, Nevada
and Hawaii.
The Cards are hoping to do
well enough to send the whole
team to the national meet but,
if the team doesn't make it,
three of Stanford's runners
have good shots at qualifying
by their individual perfor
mances.
This year's competition will
be tougher than in years past.
Last year a total of seven full
teams participated in the reg
ional qualifying meet. This year
there will be 25 teams rep
resented. "The competition
has improved a whole lot,
which makes the region a

much more respected area in
terms of the nationals," Treon
said.
Stanford finished third at last
year's qualifying meet, earning
a trip to the nationals where
they finished 18th. Stanford's
hopes of a repeat performance
hinge largely on the showings
of Anne Thrupp, Susan Brag
don and Annette Mungai. All
three are strong prospects for
individual bids to the national,
if the team doesn't qualify.
Buta few question marks still
remain about this year's team.
First of all, the Cards have been
hampered by injuries. Al
though the team is basically
healthy again, there is still a
question as to how well pre
pared they are fora tough race.
Secondly, Stanford hasn't run
against most of the teams
competing on Saturday.
The race will definitely be a
fast one, due to the flatness of
the course, with the runners
starting out quickly. Because of
this, Treon has been emphasiz
ing speed in the team's work
outs over the past week. "It's
now or never," said Treon.

a trip to the nationals where
they finished 18th. Stanford's
hopes of a repeat performance
hinge largely on the showings
of Anne Thrupp, Susan Brag
don and Annette Mungai. All
three are strong prospects for
individual bids to the national,
if the team doesn't qualify.
Buta few question marks still
remain about this year's team.
First of all, the Cards have been
hampered by injuries. Al
though the team is basically
healthy again, there is still a
question as to how well pre
pared they are fora tough race.
Secondly, Stanford hasn't run
against most of the teams
competing on Saturday.
The race will definitely be a
fast one, due to the flatness of
the course, with the runners
starting out quickly. Because of
this, Treon has been emphasiz
ing speed in the team's work
outs over the past week. "It's
now or never," said Treon.
