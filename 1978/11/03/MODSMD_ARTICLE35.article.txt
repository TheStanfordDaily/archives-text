THE BLACK OAK
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
327-0684
With the 'SC game this
weekend you may be trying to
come up with a good restaur
ant for your parents to take you
to. The Black Oak (practically
right next to campus) has the
great food your parents can
probably afford.
Promptness and courtesy
were characteristic of the ser
vice at the Black Oak. Our
waitress couldn't have been
more attentive and helpful
with dinner suggestions.
The continental menu is
quite extensive, listing around
20 entrees, mostly between $8
and $9 and recommending a
particular wine for each. We
opted for the house chablis
Ten beers, imported from 10
different countries, are also of
fered ($1.65) including Swan
lager from Australia and Bass
Ale from England. A selection
of domestic beers at under $1 is
also available.
For appetizers we had the
strongly spiced Escargots
Bourguignon in a buttery garlic
sauce ($3.95) and a heaping
bowl of fresh fruit. The snails
literally dissolve in the mouth.
The fruit included honeydew
melon, pineapple, cantelope,
strawberries, grapes and top

ping of a lightly sweetened
sour cream sauce, setting it
apart from "just another bowl
of fruit.
Included with the meal is a
choice of butter lettuce or
chef's coup. The lettuce was
beautifully fresh, piled high on
a chilled plate and eaten with a
chilled fork. The oil and vin
egar dressing, however, was
much too sweet.
The soup that night was clam
chowder — extremely delicate,
not too fishy and of the correct
consistency, not gluey as
chowders often are.
Also included with the din
ner is a small saucer of Italian
pasta smothered in a thick to
mato sauce.
Of the main courses, Tour
nedos de Boeuf Cinderella
($9.75), consisted of two in
credibly tender pieces of beef,
each broiled on an artichoke
heart and covered with a light
hollandaise sauce. The taste
was divine. One of the ar
tichoke hearts, however, was a
little scaley on the outside from
being over-cooked.
An old fashioned plate of
Sweetbreads, Saute Madeira
was well prepared and the
mushroom sauce was an excel
lent compliment to the taste.
It was necessary to take a
breather before we ordered
dessert, Baked Alaska for two

($6.50). An enormous white
mountain, easily enough for
four, was rolled out to our
table and appropriately set af
lame. Watching this spectacle
was as much fun as eating the
fluffy meringue-coated cake
with its ice cream center.
Over coffee, we sat back and
listened to the four piece band.
By this time the music had dig
ressed to slowed-up top '50s
hits, "Crease," and Debbie
Boone hits — which probably
have more appeal to the major
ity of the clientele, generally
middle-aged and older. The
first set, however, featured old
Stevie Wonder songs, George
Benson and "Girl from
Ipanema," preferable for the
younger crowd, which, an
employee confided, the re
staurant (only opened a month
ago) is hoping to attract.
The building itself has ter
raced eating areas, avoiding an
over-crowded feeling. The
timber and rough stone con
struction materials are fea
tured in the decor, which tries
to carry a theme of rural
America about the turn of the
century. The Americana hang
ing on the walls, such as rusty
farm tools and faded pictures,
along with an abundance of
dried vegetables all seemed
rather trite. This was also an
uncomfortable contrast to the

elegant menu and tuxedos
worn by both waiters and wait
resses. The decor was the only
weak spot in the evening.
A student's budget doesn't
allow for this sort of pleasure
frequently, so for a special
treat take yourself (and maybe
a friend) to an evening at The
Black Oak, dancing and eating
fabulous food at a cost that's
certainly reasonable for what
you get.
Lunch and dinner are served
Monday through Friday; din
ner only on the weekend. The
band plays until about 1:30
a.m.

Palo Alto

You can still get good food
for a reasonable price and you
don't have to go to San Fran
cisco to get it. Restaurant Des
Alpes, in Palo Alto, just a jog
down the road from Kirk's
hamburger joint, offers good
eating in a pleasant atmos
phere.
The small restaurant deco
rated a la suisse is charac
terized by two oak panelled
rooms, red tableclothes, stiff
backed (though not uncom
fortable) wooden chairs, hang
ing plants and Swiss rooster
paper cut-outs sprinkling the
walls.
The decor has simplicity in
its favor. Its "Swiss-ness" is at
tractive and recognizable
without being hokey. I ap
preciated the selection of clas
sical music instead of the all
too frequent cliche polka
music.

The toned-down atmos
phere of Des Alpes makes it
conducive to good conversa
tion and the relaxed enjoyment
of fine food.
And the food is fine. Al
though the choice of entrees is
limited to about six entrees in
cluding the usual continental
fares of steak, roast beef and
chicken, plus a German saus
age and cabbage dish, the
items we sampled were un
iformly good. Highly recom
mended is the Chicken Breasts
a la Excelsior; although odd
looking, once sliced into, it re
veals a tasy concoction of chic
ken, herbs and melted gruyere
in a red wine sauce.
Along with the regular menu
offerings are nightly seafood
specials. Trout and salmon are
frequently offered. The trout
which was very fresh and
flavorful is also recommended.
The dinners all include a
choice of soup or salad, French
bread and vegetables followed
by ice cream for dessert. While
the soup de jour, lentil, was

rather bland, the salad was a
hearty one of crisp lettuce,
cucumber and tomatoes top
ped with an unusually interest
ing buttermilk and herb dres
sing.
The wine list, though far
from exotic, offers a nice array
of German white wines among
which is the semi-dry Zeller
Schwarz Katze, a delightful
companion to fresh trout.
The service was fast and
friendly. Des Alpes appears to
be a popular place among its
somewhat older clientele;
both rooms being nearly full
on an early week night.
The prices are inexpensive to
moderate, complete dinners
ranging from $4.50-$7.50 with
an excellent children's menu at
reduced rates. A nice change
from the usual pilgrimmage to
Ramona's, Des Alpes is proba
bly not much more expensive
by the time you buy two pizzas
and a few pitchers of beer.
Opens 6 p.m. daily. Closed
Sundays and Mondays.

ressed to slowed-up top '50s
hits, "Crease," and Debbie
Boone hits — which probably
have more appeal to the major
ity of the clientele, generally
middle-aged and older. The
first set, however, featured old
Stevie Wonder songs, George
Benson and "Girl from
Ipanema," preferable for the
younger crowd, which, an
employee confided, the re
staurant (only opened a month
ago) is hoping to attract.
The building itself has ter
raced eating areas, avoiding an
over-crowded feeling. The
timber and rough stone con
struction materials are fea
tured in the decor, which tries
to carry a theme of rural
America about the turn of the
century. The Americana hang
ing on the walls, such as rusty
farm tools and faded pictures,
along with an abundance of
dried vegetables all seemed
rather trite. This was also an
uncomfortable contrast to the

elegant menu and tuxedos
worn by both waiters and wait
resses. The decor was the only
weak spot in the evening.
A student's budget doesn't
allow for this sort of pleasure
frequently, so for a special
treat take yourself (and maybe
a friend) to an evening at The
Black Oak, dancing and eating
fabulous food at a cost that's
certainly reasonable for what
you get.

You can still get good food
for a reasonable price and you
don't have to go to San Fran
cisco to get it. Restaurant Des
Alpes, in Palo Alto, just a jog
down the road from Kirk's
hamburger joint, offers good
eating in a pleasant atmos
phere.
The small restaurant deco
rated a la suisse is charac
terized by two oak panelled
rooms, red tableclothes, stiff
backed (though not uncom
fortable) wooden chairs, hang
ing plants and Swiss rooster
paper cut-outs sprinkling the
walls.
The decor has simplicity in
its favor. Its "Swiss-ness" is at
tractive and recognizable
without being hokey. I ap
preciated the selection of clas
sical music instead of the all
too frequent cliche polka
music.

The toned-down atmos
phere of Des Alpes makes it
conducive to good conversa
tion and the relaxed enjoyment
of fine food.
And the food is fine. Al
though the choice of entrees is
limited to about six entrees in
cluding the usual continental
fares of steak, roast beef and
chicken, plus a German saus
age and cabbage dish, the
items we sampled were un
iformly good. Highly recom
mended is the Chicken Breasts
a la Excelsior; although odd
looking, once sliced into, it re
veals a tasy concoction of chic
ken, herbs and melted gruyere
in a red wine sauce.
Along with the regular menu
offerings are nightly seafood
specials. Trout and salmon are
frequently offered. The trout
which was very fresh and
flavorful is also recommended.
The dinners all include a
choice of soup or salad, French
bread and vegetables followed
by ice cream for dessert. While
the soup de jour, lentil, was

rather bland, the salad was a
hearty one of crisp lettuce,
cucumber and tomatoes top
ped with an unusually interest
ing buttermilk and herb dres
sing.
The wine list, though far
from exotic, offers a nice array
of German white wines among
which is the semi-dry Zeller
Schwarz Katze, a delightful
companion to fresh trout.
The service was fast and
friendly. Des Alpes appears to
be a popular place among its
somewhat older clientele;
both rooms being nearly full
on an early week night.
The prices are inexpensive to
moderate, complete dinners
ranging from $4.50-$7.50 with
an excellent children's menu at
reduced rates. A nice change
from the usual pilgrimmage to
Ramona's, Des Alpes is proba
bly not much more expensive
by the time you buy two pizzas
and a few pitchers of beer.
Opens 6 p.m. daily. Closed
Sundays and Mondays.

THE BLACK OAK
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
327-0684
With the 'SC game this
weekend you may be trying to
come up with a good restaur
ant for your parents to take you
to. The Black Oak (practically
right next to campus) has the
great food your parents can
probably afford.
Promptness and courtesy
were characteristic of the ser
vice at the Black Oak. Our
waitress couldn't have been
more attentive and helpful
with dinner suggestions.
The continental menu is
quite extensive, listing around
20 entrees, mostly between $8
and $9 and recommending a
particular wine for each. We
opted for the house chablis
Ten beers, imported from 10
different countries, are also of
fered ($1.65) including Swan
lager from Australia and Bass
Ale from England. A selection
of domestic beers at under $1 is
also available.
For appetizers we had the
strongly spiced Escargots
Bourguignon in a buttery garlic
sauce ($3.95) and a heaping
bowl of fresh fruit. The snails
literally dissolve in the mouth.
The fruit included honeydew
melon, pineapple, cantelope,
strawberries, grapes and top

ping of a lightly sweetened
sour cream sauce, setting it
apart from "just another bowl
of fruit.
Included with the meal is a
choice of butter lettuce or
chef's coup. The lettuce was
beautifully fresh, piled high on
a chilled plate and eaten with a
chilled fork. The oil and vin
egar dressing, however, was
much too sweet.
The soup that night was clam
chowder — extremely delicate,
not too fishy and of the correct
consistency, not gluey as
chowders often are.
Also included with the din
ner is a small saucer of Italian
pasta smothered in a thick to
mato sauce.
Of the main courses, Tour
nedos de Boeuf Cinderella
($9.75), consisted of two in
credibly tender pieces of beef,
each broiled on an artichoke
heart and covered with a light
hollandaise sauce. The taste
was divine. One of the ar
tichoke hearts, however, was a
little scaley on the outside from
being over-cooked.
An old fashioned plate of
Sweetbreads, Saute Madeira
was well prepared and the
mushroom sauce was an excel
lent compliment to the taste.
It was necessary to take a
breather before we ordered
dessert, Baked Alaska for two

($6.50). An enormous white
mountain, easily enough for
four, was rolled out to our
table and appropriately set af
lame. Watching this spectacle
was as much fun as eating the
fluffy meringue-coated cake
with its ice cream center.
Over coffee, we sat back and
listened to the four piece band.

ressed to slowed-up top '50s

a la Excelsior; although odd
looking, once sliced into, it re
veals a tasy concoction of chic
ken, herbs and melted gruyere

Along with the regular menu
offerings are nightly seafood
specials. Trout and salmon are
frequently offered. The trout
which was very fresh and
flavorful is also recommended.
The dinners all include a
choice of soup or salad, French
bread and vegetables followed
by ice cream for dessert. While
the soup de jour, lentil, was

rather bland, the salad was a
hearty one of crisp lettuce,
cucumber and tomatoes top

The wine list, though far
from exotic, offers a nice array
of German white wines among
which is the semi-dry Zeller

The service was fast and
friendly. Des Alpes appears to
be a popular place among its
somewhat older clientele;
both rooms being nearly full
on an early week night.
The prices are inexpensive to
moderate, complete dinners
ranging from $4.50-$7.50 with
an excellent children's menu at
reduced rates. A nice change
from the usual pilgrimmage to
Ramona's, Des Alpes is proba
bly not much more expensive

and a few pitchers of beer.
Opens 6 p.m. daily. Closed

THE BLACK OAK
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
327-0684
With the 'SC game this
weekend you may be trying to
come up with a good restaur
ant for your parents to take you
to. The Black Oak (practically
right next to campus) has the
great food your parents can
probably afford.
Promptness and courtesy
were characteristic of the ser
vice at the Black Oak. Our
waitress couldn't have been
more attentive and helpful
with dinner suggestions.
The continental menu is
quite extensive, listing around
20 entrees, mostly between $8
and $9 and recommending a
particular wine for each. We
opted for the house chablis
Ten beers, imported from 10
different countries, are also of
fered ($1.65) including Swan
lager from Australia and Bass
Ale from England. A selection
of domestic beers at under $1 is
also available.
For appetizers we had the
strongly spiced Escargots
Bourguignon in a buttery garlic
sauce ($3.95) and a heaping
bowl of fresh fruit. The snails
literally dissolve in the mouth.
The fruit included honeydew
melon, pineapple, cantelope,
strawberries, grapes and top

ping of a lightly sweetened
sour cream sauce, setting it
apart from "just another bowl
of fruit.
Included with the meal is a
choice of butter lettuce or
chef's coup. The lettuce was
beautifully fresh, piled high on
a chilled plate and eaten with a
chilled fork. The oil and vin
egar dressing, however, was
much too sweet.
The soup that night was clam
chowder — extremely delicate,
not too fishy and of the correct
consistency, not gluey as
chowders often are.
Also included with the din
ner is a small saucer of Italian
pasta smothered in a thick to
mato sauce.
Of the main courses, Tour
nedos de Boeuf Cinderella
($9.75), consisted of two in
credibly tender pieces of beef,
each broiled on an artichoke
heart and covered with a light
hollandaise sauce. The taste
was divine. One of the ar
tichoke hearts, however, was a
little scaley on the outside from
being over-cooked.
An old fashioned plate of
Sweetbreads, Saute Madeira
was well prepared and the
mushroom sauce was an excel
lent compliment to the taste.
It was necessary to take a
breather before we ordered
dessert, Baked Alaska for two

($6.50). An enormous white
mountain, easily enough for
four, was rolled out to our
table and appropriately set af
lame. Watching this spectacle
was as much fun as eating the
fluffy meringue-coated cake
with its ice cream center.
Over coffee, we sat back and
listened to the four piece band.
By this time the music had dig
ressed to slowed-up top '50s
hits, "Crease," and Debbie
Boone hits — which probably
have more appeal to the major
ity of the clientele, generally
middle-aged and older. The
first set, however, featured old
Stevie Wonder songs, George
Benson and "Girl from
Ipanema," preferable for the
younger crowd, which, an
employee confided, the re
staurant (only opened a month
ago) is hoping to attract.
The building itself has ter
raced eating areas, avoiding an
over-crowded feeling. The
timber and rough stone con
struction materials are fea
tured in the decor, which tries
to carry a theme of rural
America about the turn of the
century. The Americana hang
ing on the walls, such as rusty
farm tools and faded pictures,
along with an abundance of
dried vegetables all seemed
rather trite. This was also an
uncomfortable contrast to the

elegant menu and tuxedos
worn by both waiters and wait
resses. The decor was the only
weak spot in the evening.
A student's budget doesn't
allow for this sort of pleasure
frequently, so for a special
treat take yourself (and maybe
a friend) to an evening at The
Black Oak, dancing and eating
fabulous food at a cost that's
certainly reasonable for what
you get.
Lunch and dinner are served
Monday through Friday; din
ner only on the weekend. The
band plays until about 1:30
a.m.

You can still get good food
for a reasonable price and you
don't have to go to San Fran
cisco to get it. Restaurant Des
Alpes, in Palo Alto, just a jog
down the road from Kirk's
hamburger joint, offers good
eating in a pleasant atmos
phere.
The small restaurant deco
rated a la suisse is charac
terized by two oak panelled
rooms, red tableclothes, stiff
backed (though not uncom
fortable) wooden chairs, hang
ing plants and Swiss rooster
paper cut-outs sprinkling the
walls.
The decor has simplicity in
its favor. Its "Swiss-ness" is at
tractive and recognizable
without being hokey. I ap
preciated the selection of clas
sical music instead of the all
too frequent cliche polka
music.

The toned-down atmos
phere of Des Alpes makes it
conducive to good conversa
tion and the relaxed enjoyment
of fine food.
And the food is fine. Al
though the choice of entrees is
limited to about six entrees in
cluding the usual continental
fares of steak, roast beef and
chicken, plus a German saus
age and cabbage dish, the
items we sampled were un
