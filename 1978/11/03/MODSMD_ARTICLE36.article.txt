# Not by bread alone
## Three favorite holes-in-the-wall 
### Harry Killas 
Friday afternoon. You have completed
the Dish, taken a shower, and now face
that seductive prospect, dorm food.
How about dining out? You eliminate
French restaurants with French food and
French service, as well as those restaur
ants of the lack-in-the-Box genre.
So what choise is left you? Perhaps
those quiet, "hole-in-the-wall" estab
lishments that are both interesting and
gentle to the pocketbook.
Here are my three favorite restaurants
around Stanford that meet those criteria.
(Actually, they are my three favorites re
gardless of any criteria.)
* * » * *
Chinese dining is not the "deal" it
once was. But the Hsi-nan, a Chinese
kitchen in the Town and Country Village,
has kept its prices reasonable without
lowering the quality of its cuisine.
Hsi-nan specializes in Szechuan cook
ery, renowned for its hot and spicy dis
hes. The spicing at Hsi-nan is more dis
tinct and hotter than the other
Szechuan-style restaurants in the area. It
is "the way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner. However, after
much experience with a "paralyzed"
tongue here, I suggest you have the
owner after the hotness to suit your
tastes.
It is commendable that dishes do not
arrive all at once at the Hsi-nan. Pot stic
kers, the subtle Pork and Chinese Turnip
Soup and the peppery Hot and Sour
Soup are three great starters.
The Chicken in Peking sauce is a must
for aficionados of hot black bean sauce.
Szechuan shredded beef is a "knock
out" dish in generous portion. Chicken
with hot pepper will delight the oral
masochist.

Hsi-nan serves many mild specialties.
Only a fool will design a meal comprised
solely of spicey dishes.
There is nothing pretentious about the
Hsi-nan. The portions are generous and
the menu varied. About $5 should do
you nicely; more with beer.

I love Mekong Its people, its atmos
phere and its food are all great. Once
vice-premier of Vietnam, Nguyenton
Hoan has run the Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain Viewforalmost eightyears. As
he seats you, he tells you of the origins of
Vietnamese cuisine (it is derived from
China and India, with some French re
finement)." We are very proud of our
culture and the way we eat," he says.
Hoan is genuinely concerned that you
enjoy all the dishes from his country.
The authentic menu lists five soups.
Most of the 23 entrees are in the $3 range
and include Vietnamese specialties,
sweet and sour dishes, barbecue and
French-influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelette.
Vietnamese cooking uses marinades
and spices extensively but they never
overpower the ingredients' own charac
ter. The distinct but subtle spicing and
the fresh ingredients reflects the great
care in the preparation of food at the
MeKong.
An excellent appetizer is the imperial
roll. It is similar to the Chinese spring
roll, but it is larger, richer in taste and is
wrapped in rice paper.
The Abaloneand Rice soup is superb; I
consider it one of the Mekong's best
dishes.
Of the entrees the unusual barbecue

chicken is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce. Another standout is the
Mekong's curries. Each curry is made
from a different combination of 12
spices.
Dessert here is worth the calories. The
house special, banana beignets (fritters)
smothered in coconut cream and
crushed peanuts, is heavenly.
With Oriental screens, ferns and clas
sical guitarand chamber music, I find the
Mekong makes for a very civilized even
ing (but the atmosphere is casual). Up
wards of $4.50.
*****
To my mind, the best Mexican restaur
ant in the Stanford area is La Estrallita.
Estrallita, located on San Antonio and El
Camino, means "little star," but it de
serves four big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita was run by
nuns, with the profits of the restaurant
going to their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the service fas
ter.
Humongous portions of quality fare at
incredible prices are the formula forsuc
cess at this establishment.
Anything you order will be tremend
ous, from the super-hot sauce to the
tamales, enchiladas and chile rellenos.
An outstanding value is the gargantuan
chicken or beef burrito ($3), with grand
chunks of meat in and atop it. Tostadas
with guacamole are very fine as well.
I cannot recommend Estrallita highly
enough. But a word of caution: it is dif
ficult to manage more than two main
items at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get by easily with $4.

care in the preparation of food at the
MeKong.
An excellent appetizer is the imperial
roll. It is similar to the Chinese spring
roll, but it is larger, richer in taste and is
wrapped in rice paper.
The Abaloneand Rice soup is superb; I
consider it one of the Mekong's best
dishes.
Of the entrees the unusual barbecue

chicken is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce. Another standout is the
Mekong's curries. Each curry is made
from a different combination of 12
spices.
Dessert here is worth the calories. The
house special, banana beignets (fritters)
smothered in coconut cream and
crushed peanuts, is heavenly.
With Oriental screens, ferns and clas
sical guitarand chamber music, I find the
Mekong makes for a very civilized even
ing (but the atmosphere is casual). Up
wards of $4.50.

To my mind, the best Mexican restaur
ant in the Stanford area is La Estrallita.
Estrallita, located on San Antonio and El
Camino, means "little star," but it de
serves four big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita was run by
nuns, with the profits of the restaurant
going to their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the service fas
ter.
Humongous portions of quality fare at
incredible prices are the formula forsuc
cess at this establishment.
Anything you order will be tremend
ous, from the super-hot sauce to the
tamales, enchiladas and chile rellenos.
An outstanding value is the gargantuan
chicken or beef burrito ($3), with grand
chunks of meat in and atop it. Tostadas
with guacamole are very fine as well.
I cannot recommend Estrallita highly
enough. But a word of caution: it is dif
ficult to manage more than two main
items at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get by easily with $4.
Friday afternoon. You have completed
the Dish, taken a shower, and now face
that seductive prospect, dorm food.
How about dining out? You eliminate
French restaurants with French food and
French service, as well as those restaur
ants of the lack-in-the-Box genre.
So what choise is left you? Perhaps
those quiet, "hole-in-the-wall" estab
lishments that are both interesting and
gentle to the pocketbook.
Here are my three favorite restaurants
around Stanford that meet those criteria.
(Actually, they are my three favorites re
gardless of any criteria.)
* * » * *
Chinese dining is not the "deal" it
once was. But the Hsi-nan, a Chinese
kitchen in the Town and Country Village,
has kept its prices reasonable without
lowering the quality of its cuisine.
Hsi-nan specializes in Szechuan cook
ery, renowned for its hot and spicy dis
hes. The spicing at Hsi-nan is more dis
tinct and hotter than the other
Szechuan-style restaurants in the area. It
is "the way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner. However, after
much experience with a "paralyzed"
tongue here, I suggest you have the
owner after the hotness to suit your
tastes.
It is commendable that dishes do not
arrive all at once at the Hsi-nan. Pot stic
kers, the subtle Pork and Chinese Turnip
Soup and the peppery Hot and Sour
Soup are three great starters.
The Chicken in Peking sauce is a must
for aficionados of hot black bean sauce.
Szechuan shredded beef is a "knock
out" dish in generous portion. Chicken
with hot pepper will delight the oral
masochist.

Hsi-nan serves many mild specialties.
Only a fool will design a meal comprised
solely of spicey dishes.
There is nothing pretentious about the
Hsi-nan. The portions are generous and
the menu varied. About $5 should do
you nicely; more with beer.

I love Mekong Its people, its atmos
phere and its food are all great. Once
vice-premier of Vietnam, Nguyenton
Hoan has run the Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain Viewforalmost eightyears. As
he seats you, he tells you of the origins of
Vietnamese cuisine (it is derived from
China and India, with some French re
finement)." We are very proud of our
culture and the way we eat," he says.
Hoan is genuinely concerned that you
enjoy all the dishes from his country.
The authentic menu lists five soups.
Most of the 23 entrees are in the $3 range
and include Vietnamese specialties,
sweet and sour dishes, barbecue and
French-influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelette.
Vietnamese cooking uses marinades
and spices extensively but they never
overpower the ingredients' own charac
ter. The distinct but subtle spicing and
the fresh ingredients reflects the great
care in the preparation of food at the
MeKong.
