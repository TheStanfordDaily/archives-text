# Profit, patriotism at Grand National Rodeo

Daly City — Inside the warm, smoke-filled Cow
Palace, cowboys without rhinestones wrestled
steers, roped calves and challenged brahma bulls in
the 34th annual Grand National Rodeo.
Outside the Cow Palace, in the chill wind of a foggy
night, seven demonstrators from the Fund for Ani
mals distributed literature vividly describing the
cruelty of wrestling steers, roping calves and chal
lenging brahma bulls. Few listened, or cared to.
"They told us to get out of the parking lot after a
man hit me in the face, but he wasn't arrested," said
Gael Murphy, one of the protestors. "He said I was
full of shit."
No worry
Not many among the 9,000 who attended opening
night ceremonies on Oct. 27 worried whether ani
mals were, as Murphy claimed, being "tortured" for
the crowd's enjoyment. This was, after all, the Grand
National, a San Francisco tradition, and a chance for
the cowboys from Salinas and Visalia to come to the
big city for a good time.
It was also a chance for the entrepreneurs from
Danville and Roseburg to come to the big city and
make some money. The only differences between the
folks at the Grand National and a convention of doc
tors were boots, blue jeans, 10-gallon hats and beer
bellies.
The Grand National mixed a little patriotism with a
lot of profit. Bob Tallman, the master of ceremonies
with a deep, mellow voice, gazed down on a sea of
horses, riders and flags, and told the crowd, "In the
year of 1978, the year of the horse, and the opening of
the Grand National we look to the arena floor where
the most predominant color is America." The house
lights dimmed, the "Star Spangled Banner" filled the
Cow Palace and tiny bubbles, a la Lawrence Welk,
cascaded from the equestrian judging box, sus
pended high over the arena floor.
It's green, they say
But on the concourse surrounding the arena, the
most predominant color was green, money.
Hucksters peddled anything and everything the
cowboy-about-town would ever need.
Ben Hudgins sat slumped in a green lawn chair in
front of his display for Tizwhiz, the horse feed re

commended by "leading breeders and trainers."
Tizwhiz, named for Dr. William J. Tiznik, has "40
percent more energy, 40 percent more protein and
double the vitamins and minerals" of oats and sweet
feeds, according to the product's promotional mate
rial.
Hudgins had displayed bona fide testimonials from
satisfied customers. Diana Howell from Morgan Hill
had allegedly said, "We tried everything . . . and . . .
finally found Tizwhiz." Cecil Skinner from Myrtle
Creek allegedly swore, "In my 20 years of breeding
and showing ... I like Tizwhiz best . .
Hudgins said Tizwhiz is sold in the United States,
Canada and "even Puerto Rico."
Deflecting the men
A few stalls down from Tizwhiz, a red-haired rodeo
"honey" wearing a white blouse and black satin pants
with fast white stripes deflected the advances of some
cowboys more interested in her than in the songs of
the "pro-rodeo singing cowboy," Chris LeDoux. The
singing cowboy's latest hits, "Cowboys Ain't Easy to
Love" and "Tennessee Stud," could be had for $8
(eight-track tapes) or $7 (albums). The teaser on the
tape cartridge guaranteed that LeDoux sings "pure
western country" and "his thrust and direction are
sure and his songs truly authentic for he's a real-life
rodeo cowboy."
Since everybody came to the big city in a camper or
a car, each could leave with a permanent reminder of
the cowboy culture on his bumper. Bumberstickers
forsale included "I'm a Drinker, I'm a Lier, I'm a Wild
Filly Rider" and "To all you VIRGINS, Thanks for NO
THING" and "COWBOYS can handle anything
HORNY" and "COWGIRLS have it . . . COWBOYS
want it . . ."
The commercialism extended into the arena. The
scoreboard used in rodeo events was provided by the
J.R. Reynolds Tobacco Co., which has sold America on
bad lungs and bad grammar ("Winston tastes good
like a cigarette should"). The company supplies six
scoreboards for all Professional Rodeo Cowboys As
sociation events.
Last year, Winston scoreboards appeared before
almost four million rodeo fans, pushing the sublimi
nal message "buy Winstons." The Grand National's
souvenir program carried a four-color Winston ad

that read: "Rodeo is my life. I give it everything I've
got. My cigarette gives me everything I want. My
cigarette is Winston. Winston is real taste and real
pleasure. Rodeo and Winston. They're both for me."
Hootin'
On the arena floor, the fans were hootin' and holla
rin', and Bob Tallman, master of ceremonies, made
sure they kept on hootin' and hollarin'. During one
wild bareback bronc ride, Tallman ,his microphone
set at an ear-splitting volume, yelled, "Hey, Come on,
right now. He's got it. I don't know what we're gonna
do to get any wilder than what you're seein' right
now."
When things slowed down, rodeo clown Wilbur
Plaugher, with red face and baggy pants, tried to be a
wild and crazy guy. He succeeded by hitting a small
rubber ball into the stands with a broom. This left the
crowd rolling in the aisles. Plaugher further stirred up
the audience by playing one side of the crowd against
the other. Whichever side yelled the loudest got the
rubber ball.
Later in the show, Wilbur brought four young boys
into the middle of the arena for another contest, this
one to see which kid could "die the best." Wilbur
fired a gun; it had blanks, and each boy took turns
clutching his stomach, closing his eyes, groanding
and crumpling to the ground. Some emphasized the
crumple over the clutch.
The winner looked to be about six years old and
wore a cowboy hat three sizes too large.
Forsome, however, Wilburand the rodeo were too
much. Fred Dole relaxed on a crate outside the main
arena, smoking a stogie and sipping an Old Mil
waukee beer. Dole said that when he was younger he
used to drive all the way from Colorado to compete in
the Grand National, but not anymore.
"I used to ride horses quite a bit, but I try to stay off
them as much as possible," he said. "Shit, these kids
in there now are 17 and 18 years old."
Although Dole, now3s, has given up riding horses,
he could still enter the event last night called the
"Winston Rodeo Cowboy Fight Night," when
cowboy combatants make the faces of their op
poennts resemble bowls of chili. Steve Martin, take
note.


Cowboy see, cowboy do! Gents watch fellow cowboys in the bareback bronc riding event. The horses react wildly because
of a rope wrapped tightly about their flanks.

You can't be bashful when asking for these bumper stickers. Extolling
the cowboy and rodeo culture, stickers were sold for as much as $3
apiece.


In steer wrestling, the cowboy catches the steer from behind and wrenches its neck until the rest of the body follows.
The purse for this event at the Cow Palace was nearly $30,000.
