						light-hearted success 
### 
The combination of Shakespeare and a mod
ern Italian-disco setting seems an ill-made mar
riage. Yet, against all odds, the Stanford Drama
Department's Two Gentlemen of Verona suc
ceeds.
The production's visual appeal is its most
striking aspect. William Eddelman suspends re
volving panels â€” silver on one side, black and
white scenes of Italy on the reverse, above func
tional split-level stage platforms. The set, beaut
iful in its simplicity, adapts easily from pool-side
scenes, to the court, to a discotheque. . . .
The romantic comedy begins with the word
less encounter of Proteus (Martin Curland) and
his beloved, Julia (Melissa Weber). Their ex
tremely stylish and sensual clothing, also de
signed by Eddelman, introduces the theme of
superficial infatuations. During the course of
action, Proteus becomes enamored of Sylvia
(Kathy Lubar) beloved of his best friend, Valen
tine (Al Mellinkoff). This infatuation causes him
to waver from old loyalties: his deceit results in
the banishment of Valentine.
Julia, the first of Shakespeare's heroines to
teach lessons of true love in the guise of a boy,
follows Proteus, unhappily helps him woo Syl
via, and eventually wins his love again.

Director Charles Lyons' attitude toward the
modern society saves the production from ab
surdity. The early entrance of a waiter wearing
dark sunglasses alerts the audience to the light
vein of parody. Occassionally this parody carica
tures but the result is nevertheless delightful.
Among others, Launce (Jim Carmody) comes to
mind. Proteus' rough-hewn servant, dressed in
ageless course gray clothing elicits laughter just
by sitting and looking at his incredibly homely,
tail-less dog, Crab (Champion Helzinki Von
Flick).
The acting of the four leads is uniformly
smooth and well-done. Northworthy others in
clude Scott Enright as the effete, aristocratically
blase Duke of Milan; Anthony Crumbach as
Speed, Valentine's witty and sarcastic servant;
and Roger Awad, Marc Fajer and Kevin Reidy as
outlaws with styled hair and tinted glasses.
That this incongruous blend succeeds is a tri
bute to Shakespeare's perception of the immor
tal foolishness of lovers.
All in all, the Drama Department's Two Gent
lemen of Verona is an imaginative and energetic
production deserving of one's time and atten
tion. The production plays from November 1-4
and 7-11 at the Little Theater.
