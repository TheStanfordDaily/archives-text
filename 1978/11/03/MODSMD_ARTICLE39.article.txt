Northpoint, San Francisco
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room.

The Buddy Holly Story frtck
Tonight, New Varsity
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Buseycan sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor. When the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.
—John Nielsen
The Turning Point ♦
Sunday, Mem Aud
A lot of people think this is a
tremendous movie, very power
ful, with much to say about living
and dancing and dealing with the
problems of age. Baloney. Don't
call me at home about this, be
cause I know it smells of man
slaughter, but Turning Point is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious fake
salvageable only because it inci
dentally features the finest
dancer on the planet. The actors'
credentials are impeccable, but
they cannot save the thing from
its grocery store pulp novel state
of mind.

Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and

strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.

The Boys from Brazil irk
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ V 2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Death on the Mile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the

patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished

form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.
—R.L.
Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet if if it
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,

and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-)ackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.
—Jim Mattson

Interiors ★ ★★
Park, Menlo Hark
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadlylhumorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Cerstin
• Animal Flouse ★★★★
Old Mill
Animal Flouse is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal Flouse has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.

The Buddy Holly Story frtck
Tonight, New Varsity
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Buseycan sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor. When the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

The Turning Point ♦
Sunday, Mem Aud
A lot of people think this is a
tremendous movie, very power
ful, with much to say about living
and dancing and dealing with the
problems of age. Baloney. Don't
call me at home about this, be
cause I know it smells of man
slaughter, but Turning Point is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious fake
salvageable only because it inci
dentally features the finest
dancer on the planet. The actors'
credentials are impeccable, but
they cannot save the thing from
its grocery store pulp novel state
of mind.
-j.N.
Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and

strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.

The Boys from Brazil irk
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ V 2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Death on the Mile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the

patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished

form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet if if it
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,

and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-)ackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.

Interiors ★ ★★
Park, Menlo Hark
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Midnight Express

This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified

Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadlylhumorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Cerstin
• Animal Flouse ★★★★
Old Mill
Animal Flouse is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal Flouse has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Tonight, New Varsity
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Buseycan sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor. When the
plot gets saccharine towards the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now.

The Turning Point ♦
Sunday, Mem Aud
A lot of people think this is a
tremendous movie, very power
ful, with much to say about living
and dancing and dealing with the
problems of age. Baloney. Don't
call me at home about this, be
cause I know it smells of man
slaughter, but Turning Point is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious fake
salvageable only because it inci
dentally features the finest
dancer on the planet. The actors'
credentials are impeccable, but
they cannot save the thing from
its grocery store pulp novel state
of mind.
-j.N.
Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and

strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.

The Boys from Brazil irk
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ V 2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Death on the Mile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the

patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished

form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet if if it
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,

and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-)ackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.

Interiors ★ ★★
Park, Menlo Hark
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified

Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadlylhumorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Cerstin
• Animal Flouse ★★★★
Old Mill
Animal Flouse is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal Flouse has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

A corporate executive's idea of

The movie has huge sets, hun

Who do we fear for? You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing

The Turning Point ♦
Sunday, Mem Aud
A lot of people think this is a
tremendous movie, very power
ful, with much to say about living
and dancing and dealing with the
problems of age. Baloney. Don't
call me at home about this, be
cause I know it smells of man
slaughter, but Turning Point is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious fake
salvageable only because it inci
dentally features the finest
dancer on the planet. The actors'
credentials are impeccable, but
they cannot save the thing from
its grocery store pulp novel state
of mind.
-j.N.
Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and

strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.

The Boys from Brazil irk
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ V 2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Death on the Mile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the

patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished

form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet if if it
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,

and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-)ackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.
—Jim Mattson

Interiors ★ ★★
Park, Menlo Hark
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American

Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadlylhumorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Cerstin
• Animal Flouse ★★★★
Old Mill
Animal Flouse is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal Flouse has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

A corporate executive's idea of

technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe

Who do we fear for? You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no

Gary Busey's upper lip and ex

inflated, shrill, pretentious fake
salvageable only because it inci
dentally features the finest
dancer on the planet. The actors'
credentials are impeccable, but
they cannot save the thing from
its grocery store pulp novel state
of mind.

Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue — if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and

strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.

The Boys from Brazil irk
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ V 2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Death on the Mile ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Peter Ustinov plays Hercule
Poirot for comedy, but he slides
into seriousness in time for the

patented Agatha Christie climax.
A solid mystery, nicely photo
graphed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (who
own Paramount, the distributors
of this film) could have put their
14 million dollars to a different
use. Or, better yet, maybe they
should keep making these safe,
inoffensive and generally well
made entertainments and use the
profits to take some chances with
unusual projects and new
filmmakers. Probably won't hap
pen though; the board of direc
tors would never allow it.
—R.L.
A Wedding ★★
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Writer-director Robert Altman
returns to Nashville's style but his
subject is not nearly so arresting.
While A Wedding often exhibits
quick flashes of brilliance, on ba
lance, too many elements appear
to have been left in unfinished

form, and the characterization is
particularly lazy.
Only Carol Burnett manages to
create a sharply defined charac
ter, and as a consequence, she
dominates the movie in what is a
performance of great emotional
range.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europet if if it
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,

and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-)ackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.
—Jim Mattson

Interiors ★ ★★
Park, Menlo Hark
Woody Allen deserves high
praise for his courage in making
this serious work about a family
in crisis, especially on the heels
of Annie Hall. While Interiors is
sometimes too forced, too
worked out, what is surprising is
that it is not more so, since this
movie is so different from Allen's
previous movie experience.
But when Interiors works, and
it often does, brilliantly; the per
formances are the reason why.
Ceraldine Page, Maureen Staple
ton, Diane Keaton and Marybeth
Hurt are all excellent in demand
ing roles, and the rest of the
nine-member ensemble are fine.
While I don't think that In
teriors is a great movie, honest
and deeply felt effort obviously
went into the making of it, and
there is something great (and,
sadly, rare) in that.
—R.L.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college drop out imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadlylhumorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Cerstin
• Animal Flouse ★★★★
Old Mill
Animal Flouse is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal Flouse has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
