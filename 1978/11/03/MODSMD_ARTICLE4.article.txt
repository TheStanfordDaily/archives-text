## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
It will be a few months before stu
dents here will learn if they're eligi
ble for more financial aid now that
President Jimmy Carter has signed a
new tuition grant bill, spokesmen
from the Financial Aids Office said
yesterday.
"It's going to take a while for us to
get the new regulations from the
state Office of Education and learn
the application procedures,"
explained Robert Huff, director of fi
nancial aids.
"We're currently in the process of
calculating how many students will
be affected by the new law and how it
will affect the University dollar
wise," he added.

Carter Wednesday signed the
Middle Income Student Assistance
Act, which made more than one mill
ion students eligible for college tui
tion grants. The University had lob
bied for the bill's passage.
"President Richard Lyman wrote a
number of letters last year encourag
ing the bill while University staff
talked with congressmen and several
organizations in Washington," said
Robert Freelan, director of govern
ment relations.
Depending on future House ap
propriations, basic education grants
will be open next year to families
with incomes of up to $26,000. For
merly only families with incomes
below $16,000 were eligible.
In addition, the new law increases
the maximum annual basic grant
from $1600 to $1800, Huff said.
Interest rates
Interest rates on guaranteed stu
dent loans from banks were also af
fected by the bill. In the past, only
families with incomes below $25,000
could have the federal government
pay the 7 percent interest rate on
those loans. But in 60 days, the gov
ernment will begin paying the in
terest rate on all higher education
loans regardless of the borrower's
income, Huff explained.
The federal government now also
is required to provide additional in
ducements to lending institutions to
participate in the guaranteed student
loan program.
