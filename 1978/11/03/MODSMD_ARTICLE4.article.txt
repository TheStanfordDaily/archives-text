### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
It will be a few months before stu
dents here will learn if they're eligi
ble for more financial aid now that
President Jimmy Carter has signed a
new tuition grant bill, spokesmen
from the Financial Aids Office said
yesterday.
"It's going to take a while for us to
get the new regulations from the
state Office of Education and learn
the application procedures,"
explained Robert Huff, director of fi
nancial aids.
"We're currently in the process of
calculating how many students will
be affected by the new law and how it
will affect the University dollar
wise," he added.

Carter Wednesday signed the
Middle Income Student Assistance
Act, which made more than one mill
ion students eligible for college tui
tion grants. The University had lob
bied for the bill's passage.
"President Richard Lyman wrote a
number of letters last year encourag
ing the bill while University staff
talked with congressmen and several
organizations in Washington," said
Robert Freelan, director of govern
ment relations.
Depending on future House ap
propriations, basic education grants
will be open next year to families
with incomes of up to $26,000. For
merly only families with incomes
below $16,000 were eligible.
