# Associated Press News Summary

### 
Dollar soars, gold prices fall
A dramatic boost in the overseas value of
U.S. currency greeted President Jimmy Car
ter's emergency save-the-dollar campaign yes
terday, but there were disturbing new signals
that his companion battle to curb inflation will
be long and hard.
Administration strategists were heartened
by reports from foreign exchange markets that
the dollar soared against every major West
European currency, while gold bullion prices
fell. In Tokyo, the dollar jumped by more than
4 percent against the Japanese yen in the first
hours of trading after Carter's announcement
Wednesday.
And in New York, the stock market dropped
by 10.8 points to 816.% in fairly heavy trading
yesterday, as investors sold for profit. How
ever, advances held a more than 2-1 lead over
declines after a buoyant day that saw the
largest single-session gain in history Wednes
day, a rise of 35.34 points.
Wholesale food prices rise
Washington — Wholesale food prices rose
sharply in October for the second straight
month, assuring shoppers they'll see more big
price jumps at grocery stores and signaling
sustained high inflation fortherestof theyear.
The Labor Department said yesterday that
wholeslale food prices alone jumped 1.7 per
cent last month, matching September for the
highest monthly rise since April.
Price hikes at this level translate into in
creases to shoppers in the coming months.
Food prices already have jumped 10 percent in
the first nine months of the year.
Adding to the ominous report issued yester
day were figures showing that wholesale price
rises for some non-food goods and increases
for products at earlier stages of production
were the highest in four years.
Government economists said meat prices
were the leading contributor to the latest
wholesale increase for food. The food price
increase pushed the government's overall
wholesale — or "finished goods" — index up
0.9 percent in October. That also tied Sep
tember for the highest monthly rise since Ap
ril.
Vietnam attacked by Chinese
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam said yesterday
its forces repulsed two separate attacks by
hundreds of Chinese troops who crossed into
northern Vietnam and killed or wounded
many Vietnamese soldiers.
A Voice of Vietnam broadcast from Hanoi
said thousands of Chinese reinforcements
were dispatched to the border area on the
Chinese side. It described the situation as
"critical" and said the Foreign Ministry con
demned the alleged border violations as
"criminal acts."
Western sources in Bangkok said tension
along the frontier has mounted in recent
weeks, but speculated that a full-scale conflict
was unlikely. They also noted that official
Chinese media has not reported much on the

border situation.
The quarrel was sparked earlier this year by
Chinese accusations that Vietnam was mis
treating its ethnic Chinese population. The
situation worsened as about 160,000 of the
Chinese made their way to China.
Beneath this, most analysts see China's
anger at Vietnam's close ties to the Soviet
Union and Vietnam's ongoing border war with
Cambodia, a Chinese ally.
Rhodesian planes bomb Zambia
Lusaka, Zambia — Rhodesian warplanes, de
fiantly ignoring British efforts to build up Zam
bia's air defenses, staged a lightning bombing
run yesterday on a black nationalist position
outside this capital city, reportedly inflicting at
least 100 casualties.
The Rhodesian military said the target was a
black Rhodesian guerrilla camp. The Zambian
government contended it was a refugee chil
dren's camp, but at least one independent
source disputed this.
It was the Rhodesians' first cross-border
strike into Zambia since airborne raiders at
tacked a dozen black guerrilla camps two
weeks ago, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
Since then Britain has airlifted ground-to-air
missiles, radar networks and anti-aircraft bat
teries to Zambia, a former colony, in an obvi
ous effort to ward off further Rhodesian air
attacks.
The Carter administration quickly de
nounced the cross-border sally, as it did after
the Oct. 19-21 raids. In Washington, State De
partment spokesman Kenneth Brown called
the latest attack a "further unwarranted and
deplorable escalation of the Rhodesian war."
Cosmonauts end longest flight
Moscow — Cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalenok
and Alexander Ivanchenkov parachuted onto
the steppes of Soviet Central Asia yesterday,
ending the longest spaceflight in history —139
days, 14 hours and 49 minutes, the Tass news
agency reported.
The new endurance record surpasses the
earlier Soviet-held record of 96 days, set March
16. The longest American space flight, which
had stood as a record for four years, was 84
days, set in early 1974 by astronauts Gerald
Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard Skylab 4.
A television announcer said "the men feel
excel lent" after their soft-landing. He said they
were ferried by helicopter to the Baikonur
Space Center.
Jarvis withholds endorsement
Sacramento —Proposition 13 author Howard
Jarvis yesterday declared he will endorse
neither Gov. Jerry Brown nor Republican
nominee Evelle Younger for governor.
The 75-year-old tax revolt leader last month
taped television commercials praising both the
Democratic governor and his GOP rival for
their efforts to implement Proposition 13.
But he said then he was withholding judg
ment on whether to endorse either.
Today, Jarvis made that final.

"I am announcing today that I have decided
not to endorse either Evelle Younger or Jerry
Brown for governor," Jarvis said in a statement
issued from Detroit, where he is campaigning
for Michigan's Measure I, a Proposition 13-
style ballot measure.
lacocca to head Chrysler
Detroit Lee lacocca, ousted president of
Ford Motor Co., jumped into the president's
job at financially strapped Chrysler Corp. yes
terday in a rescue operation that stunned the
auto industry.
With the surprise move, the cigar-chomping
lacocca, 54, forefeited more than $1 million in
deferred bonuses he stood to receive from his
former employer. His salary at Chrysler was
not disclosed.
lacocca, a sales and marketing whiz at Ford,
is expected to have a free hand as chief operat
ing officer of the No. 3 automaker. He had
been ousted from Ford, which is No. 2 behind
General Motors, in July after Chairman Henry
Ford II reportedly told him, "I just don't like
you."
"It's an astounding development," said
Detroit-based auto analyst Arvid jouppi. "It's
terrific news for Chrysler. And lacocca has an
opportunity to be a hero."
For the colorful lacocca, it was a bold move
in keeping with his character. But the quick
ness of his move, less than four months after
his firing, startled Detroit.
ITT charged with illegalities
Washington —The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged yesterday that Interna
tional Telephone and Telegraph Corp. made
millions of dollars in "illegal, improper, cor
rupt and questionable payments" to foreign
government and business officials from 1970 to
1976.
In a new disclosure of widespread attempts
by an American corporation to buy influence
overseas, the SEC detailed complaints against
ITT in nine countries.
In a previously sealed complaint ordered re
leased by a federal judge yesterday, the agency
cited ITT's operations in Indonesia, Iran, the
Philippines, Algeria, Nigeria, Mexico, Italy,
Turkey and Chile.
The SEC said the questionable payments re
sulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of
business for the giant international corpora
tion.
The gains were concealed through "false
and fictitious entries" made on the books of
ITT and its subsidiaries and affiliates in Belgium
and West Germany.
Explosion victims uncovered
Willahermosa, Mexico — Rescue workers
dug bodies yesterday from the smoldering
ashes of a crossroads truck-stop destroyed
when a natural gas pipeline ruptured and sent
a fireball flashing through a dozen small re
staurants arid taco stands.
Adolfo Arroyp Villasenor, chief security of
ficer for the national petroleum company PE
MEX, which operates the pipeline, said 40 per

sons were killed by the blast and 11 severely
burned. He said an earlier casualty toll of 52
dead and 21 injured resulted from incorrect
counting of the badly charred victims.
Small fires still burned in the area yesterday
afternoon. Gaston Rodriguez Ferrara, a pilot
employed by the state, said the explosion
wiped out large chunks of the highways and
left "a very deep crater approximately 240 feet
in diameter. Everything was wiped out."
Dow Jones falls 10.83
New York — Not even a visit by President
Jimmy Carter — whose administration
triggered the biggest run-up in Wall Street his
tory Wednesday by moving to strengthen the
dollar — could keep the stock market from
falling yesterday amid fears about what that
program would mean for already-high interest
rates.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial issues soared 35.34 points, the
biggest gain in its history, after the announce
ment of the dollar-strengthening plan.
But the widely watched average see-sawed
yesterday before closing with a drop of 10.83 to
816.%.
Although trading was active at 40.03 million
shares, it was substantially off Wednesday's
50.45 million-share pace.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patches of fog
or low overcast nights and mornings. Lows in
the 40s and lower 50s. Highs in the mid 60s to
mid 70s.

missiles, radar networks and anti-aircraft bat
teries to Zambia, a former colony, in an obvi
ous effort to ward off further Rhodesian air
attacks.
The Carter administration quickly de
nounced the cross-border sally, as it did after
the Oct. 19-21 raids. In Washington, State De
partment spokesman Kenneth Brown called
the latest attack a "further unwarranted and
deplorable escalation of the Rhodesian war."
Cosmonauts end longest flight
Moscow — Cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalenok
and Alexander Ivanchenkov parachuted onto
the steppes of Soviet Central Asia yesterday,
ending the longest spaceflight in history —139
days, 14 hours and 49 minutes, the Tass news
agency reported.
The new endurance record surpasses the
earlier Soviet-held record of 96 days, set March
16. The longest American space flight, which
had stood as a record for four years, was 84
days, set in early 1974 by astronauts Gerald
Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard Skylab 4.
A television announcer said "the men feel
excel lent" after their soft-landing. He said they
were ferried by helicopter to the Baikonur
Space Center.
Jarvis withholds endorsement
Sacramento —Proposition 13 author Howard
Jarvis yesterday declared he will endorse
neither Gov. Jerry Brown nor Republican
nominee Evelle Younger for governor.
The 75-year-old tax revolt leader last month
taped television commercials praising both the
Democratic governor and his GOP rival for
their efforts to implement Proposition 13.
But he said then he was withholding judg
ment on whether to endorse either.
Today, Jarvis made that final.

"I am announcing today that I have decided
not to endorse either Evelle Younger or Jerry
Brown for governor," Jarvis said in a statement
issued from Detroit, where he is campaigning
for Michigan's Measure I, a Proposition 13-
style ballot measure.
lacocca to head Chrysler
Detroit Lee lacocca, ousted president of
Ford Motor Co., jumped into the president's
job at financially strapped Chrysler Corp. yes
terday in a rescue operation that stunned the
auto industry.
With the surprise move, the cigar-chomping
lacocca, 54, forefeited more than $1 million in
deferred bonuses he stood to receive from his
former employer. His salary at Chrysler was
not disclosed.
lacocca, a sales and marketing whiz at Ford,
is expected to have a free hand as chief operat
ing officer of the No. 3 automaker. He had
been ousted from Ford, which is No. 2 behind
General Motors, in July after Chairman Henry
Ford II reportedly told him, "I just don't like
you."
"It's an astounding development," said
Detroit-based auto analyst Arvid jouppi. "It's
terrific news for Chrysler. And lacocca has an
opportunity to be a hero."
For the colorful lacocca, it was a bold move
in keeping with his character. But the quick
ness of his move, less than four months after
his firing, startled Detroit.
ITT charged with illegalities
Washington —The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged yesterday that Interna
tional Telephone and Telegraph Corp. made
millions of dollars in "illegal, improper, cor
rupt and questionable payments" to foreign
government and business officials from 1970 to
1976.
In a new disclosure of widespread attempts
by an American corporation to buy influence
overseas, the SEC detailed complaints against
ITT in nine countries.
In a previously sealed complaint ordered re
leased by a federal judge yesterday, the agency
cited ITT's operations in Indonesia, Iran, the
Philippines, Algeria, Nigeria, Mexico, Italy,
Turkey and Chile.
The SEC said the questionable payments re
sulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of
business for the giant international corpora
tion.
The gains were concealed through "false
and fictitious entries" made on the books of
ITT and its subsidiaries and affiliates in Belgium
and West Germany.
Explosion victims uncovered
Willahermosa, Mexico — Rescue workers
dug bodies yesterday from the smoldering
ashes of a crossroads truck-stop destroyed
when a natural gas pipeline ruptured and sent
a fireball flashing through a dozen small re
staurants arid taco stands.
Adolfo Arroyp Villasenor, chief security of
ficer for the national petroleum company PE
MEX, which operates the pipeline, said 40 per

sons were killed by the blast and 11 severely
burned. He said an earlier casualty toll of 52
dead and 21 injured resulted from incorrect
counting of the badly charred victims.
Small fires still burned in the area yesterday
afternoon. Gaston Rodriguez Ferrara, a pilot
employed by the state, said the explosion
wiped out large chunks of the highways and
left "a very deep crater approximately 240 feet
in diameter. Everything was wiped out."
Dow Jones falls 10.83
New York — Not even a visit by President
Jimmy Carter — whose administration
triggered the biggest run-up in Wall Street his
tory Wednesday by moving to strengthen the
dollar — could keep the stock market from
falling yesterday amid fears about what that
program would mean for already-high interest
rates.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial issues soared 35.34 points, the
biggest gain in its history, after the announce
ment of the dollar-strengthening plan.
But the widely watched average see-sawed
yesterday before closing with a drop of 10.83 to
816.%.
Although trading was active at 40.03 million
shares, it was substantially off Wednesday's
50.45 million-share pace.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patches of fog
or low overcast nights and mornings. Lows in
the 40s and lower 50s. Highs in the mid 60s to
mid 70s.
Dollar soars, gold prices fall
A dramatic boost in the overseas value of
U.S. currency greeted President Jimmy Car
ter's emergency save-the-dollar campaign yes
terday, but there were disturbing new signals
that his companion battle to curb inflation will
be long and hard.
Administration strategists were heartened
by reports from foreign exchange markets that
the dollar soared against every major West
European currency, while gold bullion prices
fell. In Tokyo, the dollar jumped by more than
4 percent against the Japanese yen in the first
hours of trading after Carter's announcement
Wednesday.
And in New York, the stock market dropped
by 10.8 points to 816.% in fairly heavy trading
yesterday, as investors sold for profit. How
ever, advances held a more than 2-1 lead over
declines after a buoyant day that saw the
largest single-session gain in history Wednes
day, a rise of 35.34 points.
Wholesale food prices rise
Washington — Wholesale food prices rose
sharply in October for the second straight
month, assuring shoppers they'll see more big
price jumps at grocery stores and signaling
sustained high inflation fortherestof theyear.
The Labor Department said yesterday that
wholeslale food prices alone jumped 1.7 per
cent last month, matching September for the
highest monthly rise since April.
Price hikes at this level translate into in
creases to shoppers in the coming months.
Food prices already have jumped 10 percent in
the first nine months of the year.
Adding to the ominous report issued yester
day were figures showing that wholesale price
rises for some non-food goods and increases
for products at earlier stages of production
were the highest in four years.
Government economists said meat prices
were the leading contributor to the latest
wholesale increase for food. The food price
increase pushed the government's overall
wholesale — or "finished goods" — index up
0.9 percent in October. That also tied Sep
tember for the highest monthly rise since Ap
ril.
Vietnam attacked by Chinese
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam said yesterday
its forces repulsed two separate attacks by
hundreds of Chinese troops who crossed into
northern Vietnam and killed or wounded
many Vietnamese soldiers.
A Voice of Vietnam broadcast from Hanoi
said thousands of Chinese reinforcements
were dispatched to the border area on the
Chinese side. It described the situation as
"critical" and said the Foreign Ministry con
demned the alleged border violations as
"criminal acts."
Western sources in Bangkok said tension
along the frontier has mounted in recent
weeks, but speculated that a full-scale conflict
was unlikely. They also noted that official
Chinese media has not reported much on the

border situation.
The quarrel was sparked earlier this year by
Chinese accusations that Vietnam was mis
treating its ethnic Chinese population. The
situation worsened as about 160,000 of the
Chinese made their way to China.
Beneath this, most analysts see China's
anger at Vietnam's close ties to the Soviet
Union and Vietnam's ongoing border war with
Cambodia, a Chinese ally.
Rhodesian planes bomb Zambia
Lusaka, Zambia — Rhodesian warplanes, de
fiantly ignoring British efforts to build up Zam
bia's air defenses, staged a lightning bombing
run yesterday on a black nationalist position
outside this capital city, reportedly inflicting at
least 100 casualties.
The Rhodesian military said the target was a
black Rhodesian guerrilla camp. The Zambian
government contended it was a refugee chil
dren's camp, but at least one independent
source disputed this.
It was the Rhodesians' first cross-border
strike into Zambia since airborne raiders at
tacked a dozen black guerrilla camps two
weeks ago, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
Since then Britain has airlifted ground-to-air
missiles, radar networks and anti-aircraft bat

Explosion victims uncovered
Willahermosa, Mexico — Rescue workers
dug bodies yesterday from the smoldering
ashes of a crossroads truck-stop destroyed
when a natural gas pipeline ruptured and sent
a fireball flashing through a dozen small re
staurants arid taco stands.
Adolfo Arroyp Villasenor, chief security of
ficer for the national petroleum company PE
MEX, which operates the pipeline, said 40 per

sons were killed by the blast and 11 severely
burned. He said an earlier casualty toll of 52
dead and 21 injured resulted from incorrect
counting of the badly charred victims.
Small fires still burned in the area yesterday
afternoon. Gaston Rodriguez Ferrara, a pilot
employed by the state, said the explosion
wiped out large chunks of the highways and
left "a very deep crater approximately 240 feet
in diameter. Everything was wiped out."
Dow Jones falls 10.83
New York — Not even a visit by President
Jimmy Carter — whose administration
triggered the biggest run-up in Wall Street his
tory Wednesday by moving to strengthen the
dollar — could keep the stock market from
falling yesterday amid fears about what that
program would mean for already-high interest
rates.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial issues soared 35.34 points, the
biggest gain in its history, after the announce
ment of the dollar-strengthening plan.
But the widely watched average see-sawed
yesterday before closing with a drop of 10.83 to
816.%.
Although trading was active at 40.03 million
shares, it was substantially off Wednesday's
50.45 million-share pace.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patches of fog
or low overcast nights and mornings. Lows in
the 40s and lower 50s. Highs in the mid 60s to
mid 70s.
Dollar soars, gold prices fall
A dramatic boost in the overseas value of
U.S. currency greeted President Jimmy Car
ter's emergency save-the-dollar campaign yes
terday, but there were disturbing new signals
that his companion battle to curb inflation will
be long and hard.
Administration strategists were heartened
by reports from foreign exchange markets that
the dollar soared against every major West
European currency, while gold bullion prices
fell. In Tokyo, the dollar jumped by more than
4 percent against the Japanese yen in the first
hours of trading after Carter's announcement
Wednesday.
And in New York, the stock market dropped
by 10.8 points to 816.% in fairly heavy trading
yesterday, as investors sold for profit. How
ever, advances held a more than 2-1 lead over
declines after a buoyant day that saw the
largest single-session gain in history Wednes
day, a rise of 35.34 points.
Wholesale food prices rise
Washington — Wholesale food prices rose
sharply in October for the second straight
month, assuring shoppers they'll see more big
price jumps at grocery stores and signaling
sustained high inflation fortherestof theyear.
The Labor Department said yesterday that
wholeslale food prices alone jumped 1.7 per
cent last month, matching September for the
highest monthly rise since April.
Price hikes at this level translate into in
creases to shoppers in the coming months.
Food prices already have jumped 10 percent in
the first nine months of the year.
Adding to the ominous report issued yester
day were figures showing that wholesale price
rises for some non-food goods and increases
for products at earlier stages of production
were the highest in four years.
Government economists said meat prices
were the leading contributor to the latest
wholesale increase for food. The food price
increase pushed the government's overall
wholesale — or "finished goods" — index up
0.9 percent in October. That also tied Sep
tember for the highest monthly rise since Ap
ril.
Vietnam attacked by Chinese
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam said yesterday
its forces repulsed two separate attacks by
hundreds of Chinese troops who crossed into
northern Vietnam and killed or wounded
many Vietnamese soldiers.
A Voice of Vietnam broadcast from Hanoi
said thousands of Chinese reinforcements
were dispatched to the border area on the
Chinese side. It described the situation as
"critical" and said the Foreign Ministry con
demned the alleged border violations as
"criminal acts."
Western sources in Bangkok said tension
along the frontier has mounted in recent
weeks, but speculated that a full-scale conflict
was unlikely. They also noted that official
Chinese media has not reported much on the

border situation.
The quarrel was sparked earlier this year by
Chinese accusations that Vietnam was mis
treating its ethnic Chinese population. The
situation worsened as about 160,000 of the
Chinese made their way to China.
Beneath this, most analysts see China's
anger at Vietnam's close ties to the Soviet
Union and Vietnam's ongoing border war with
Cambodia, a Chinese ally.
Rhodesian planes bomb Zambia
Lusaka, Zambia — Rhodesian warplanes, de
fiantly ignoring British efforts to build up Zam
bia's air defenses, staged a lightning bombing
run yesterday on a black nationalist position
outside this capital city, reportedly inflicting at
least 100 casualties.
The Rhodesian military said the target was a
black Rhodesian guerrilla camp. The Zambian
government contended it was a refugee chil
dren's camp, but at least one independent
source disputed this.
It was the Rhodesians' first cross-border
strike into Zambia since airborne raiders at
tacked a dozen black guerrilla camps two
weeks ago, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
Since then Britain has airlifted ground-to-air
missiles, radar networks and anti-aircraft bat
teries to Zambia, a former colony, in an obvi
ous effort to ward off further Rhodesian air
attacks.
The Carter administration quickly de
nounced the cross-border sally, as it did after
the Oct. 19-21 raids. In Washington, State De
partment spokesman Kenneth Brown called
the latest attack a "further unwarranted and
deplorable escalation of the Rhodesian war."
Cosmonauts end longest flight
Moscow — Cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalenok
and Alexander Ivanchenkov parachuted onto
the steppes of Soviet Central Asia yesterday,
ending the longest spaceflight in history —139
days, 14 hours and 49 minutes, the Tass news
agency reported.
The new endurance record surpasses the
earlier Soviet-held record of 96 days, set March
16. The longest American space flight, which
had stood as a record for four years, was 84
days, set in early 1974 by astronauts Gerald
Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard Skylab 4.
A television announcer said "the men feel
excel lent" after their soft-landing. He said they
were ferried by helicopter to the Baikonur
Space Center.
Jarvis withholds endorsement
Sacramento —Proposition 13 author Howard
Jarvis yesterday declared he will endorse
neither Gov. Jerry Brown nor Republican
nominee Evelle Younger for governor.
The 75-year-old tax revolt leader last month
taped television commercials praising both the
Democratic governor and his GOP rival for
their efforts to implement Proposition 13.
But he said then he was withholding judg
ment on whether to endorse either.
Today, Jarvis made that final.

"I am announcing today that I have decided
not to endorse either Evelle Younger or Jerry
Brown for governor," Jarvis said in a statement
issued from Detroit, where he is campaigning
for Michigan's Measure I, a Proposition 13-
style ballot measure.
lacocca to head Chrysler
Detroit Lee lacocca, ousted president of
Ford Motor Co., jumped into the president's
job at financially strapped Chrysler Corp. yes
terday in a rescue operation that stunned the
auto industry.
With the surprise move, the cigar-chomping
lacocca, 54, forefeited more than $1 million in
deferred bonuses he stood to receive from his
former employer. His salary at Chrysler was
not disclosed.
lacocca, a sales and marketing whiz at Ford,
is expected to have a free hand as chief operat
ing officer of the No. 3 automaker. He had
been ousted from Ford, which is No. 2 behind
General Motors, in July after Chairman Henry
Ford II reportedly told him, "I just don't like
you."
"It's an astounding development," said
Detroit-based auto analyst Arvid jouppi. "It's
terrific news for Chrysler. And lacocca has an
opportunity to be a hero."
For the colorful lacocca, it was a bold move
in keeping with his character. But the quick
ness of his move, less than four months after
his firing, startled Detroit.
ITT charged with illegalities
Washington —The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged yesterday that Interna
tional Telephone and Telegraph Corp. made
millions of dollars in "illegal, improper, cor
rupt and questionable payments" to foreign
government and business officials from 1970 to
1976.
In a new disclosure of widespread attempts
by an American corporation to buy influence
overseas, the SEC detailed complaints against
ITT in nine countries.
In a previously sealed complaint ordered re
leased by a federal judge yesterday, the agency
cited ITT's operations in Indonesia, Iran, the
Philippines, Algeria, Nigeria, Mexico, Italy,
Turkey and Chile.
The SEC said the questionable payments re
sulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of
business for the giant international corpora
tion.
The gains were concealed through "false

day were figures showing that wholesale price
rises for some non-food goods and increases
for products at earlier stages of production
were the highest in four years.
Government economists said meat prices
were the leading contributor to the latest
wholesale increase for food. The food price
increase pushed the government's overall
wholesale — or "finished goods" — index up
0.9 percent in October. That also tied Sep
tember for the highest monthly rise since Ap
ril.
Vietnam attacked by Chinese
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam said yesterday
its forces repulsed two separate attacks by
hundreds of Chinese troops who crossed into
northern Vietnam and killed or wounded
many Vietnamese soldiers.
A Voice of Vietnam broadcast from Hanoi
said thousands of Chinese reinforcements
were dispatched to the border area on the
Chinese side. It described the situation as
"critical" and said the Foreign Ministry con
demned the alleged border violations as
"criminal acts."
Western sources in Bangkok said tension
along the frontier has mounted in recent
weeks, but speculated that a full-scale conflict
was unlikely. They also noted that official
Chinese media has not reported much on the

border situation.
The quarrel was sparked earlier this year by
Chinese accusations that Vietnam was mis
treating its ethnic Chinese population. The
situation worsened as about 160,000 of the
Chinese made their way to China.
Beneath this, most analysts see China's
anger at Vietnam's close ties to the Soviet
Union and Vietnam's ongoing border war with
Cambodia, a Chinese ally.
Rhodesian planes bomb Zambia
Lusaka, Zambia — Rhodesian warplanes, de
fiantly ignoring British efforts to build up Zam
bia's air defenses, staged a lightning bombing
run yesterday on a black nationalist position
outside this capital city, reportedly inflicting at
least 100 casualties.
The Rhodesian military said the target was a
black Rhodesian guerrilla camp. The Zambian
government contended it was a refugee chil
dren's camp, but at least one independent
source disputed this.
It was the Rhodesians' first cross-border
strike into Zambia since airborne raiders at
tacked a dozen black guerrilla camps two
weeks ago, killing a reported 1500 insurgents.
Since then Britain has airlifted ground-to-air
missiles, radar networks and anti-aircraft bat
teries to Zambia, a former colony, in an obvi
ous effort to ward off further Rhodesian air
attacks.
The Carter administration quickly de
nounced the cross-border sally, as it did after
the Oct. 19-21 raids. In Washington, State De
partment spokesman Kenneth Brown called
the latest attack a "further unwarranted and
deplorable escalation of the Rhodesian war."
Cosmonauts end longest flight
Moscow — Cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalenok
and Alexander Ivanchenkov parachuted onto
the steppes of Soviet Central Asia yesterday,
ending the longest spaceflight in history —139
days, 14 hours and 49 minutes, the Tass news
agency reported.
The new endurance record surpasses the
earlier Soviet-held record of 96 days, set March
16. The longest American space flight, which
had stood as a record for four years, was 84
days, set in early 1974 by astronauts Gerald
Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard Skylab 4.
A television announcer said "the men feel
excel lent" after their soft-landing. He said they
were ferried by helicopter to the Baikonur
Space Center.
Jarvis withholds endorsement
Sacramento —Proposition 13 author Howard
Jarvis yesterday declared he will endorse
neither Gov. Jerry Brown nor Republican
nominee Evelle Younger for governor.
The 75-year-old tax revolt leader last month
taped television commercials praising both the
Democratic governor and his GOP rival for
their efforts to implement Proposition 13.
But he said then he was withholding judg
ment on whether to endorse either.
Today, Jarvis made that final.

"I am announcing today that I have decided
not to endorse either Evelle Younger or Jerry
Brown for governor," Jarvis said in a statement
issued from Detroit, where he is campaigning
for Michigan's Measure I, a Proposition 13-
style ballot measure.
lacocca to head Chrysler
Detroit Lee lacocca, ousted president of
Ford Motor Co., jumped into the president's
job at financially strapped Chrysler Corp. yes
terday in a rescue operation that stunned the
auto industry.
With the surprise move, the cigar-chomping
lacocca, 54, forefeited more than $1 million in
deferred bonuses he stood to receive from his
former employer. His salary at Chrysler was
not disclosed.
lacocca, a sales and marketing whiz at Ford,
is expected to have a free hand as chief operat
ing officer of the No. 3 automaker. He had
been ousted from Ford, which is No. 2 behind
General Motors, in July after Chairman Henry
Ford II reportedly told him, "I just don't like
you."
"It's an astounding development," said
Detroit-based auto analyst Arvid jouppi. "It's
terrific news for Chrysler. And lacocca has an
opportunity to be a hero."
For the colorful lacocca, it was a bold move
in keeping with his character. But the quick
ness of his move, less than four months after
his firing, startled Detroit.
ITT charged with illegalities
Washington —The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged yesterday that Interna
tional Telephone and Telegraph Corp. made
millions of dollars in "illegal, improper, cor
rupt and questionable payments" to foreign
government and business officials from 1970 to
1976.
In a new disclosure of widespread attempts
by an American corporation to buy influence
overseas, the SEC detailed complaints against
ITT in nine countries.
In a previously sealed complaint ordered re
leased by a federal judge yesterday, the agency
cited ITT's operations in Indonesia, Iran, the
Philippines, Algeria, Nigeria, Mexico, Italy,
Turkey and Chile.
The SEC said the questionable payments re
sulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of
business for the giant international corpora
tion.
The gains were concealed through "false
and fictitious entries" made on the books of
ITT and its subsidiaries and affiliates in Belgium
and West Germany.
Explosion victims uncovered
Willahermosa, Mexico — Rescue workers
dug bodies yesterday from the smoldering
ashes of a crossroads truck-stop destroyed
when a natural gas pipeline ruptured and sent
a fireball flashing through a dozen small re
staurants arid taco stands.
Adolfo Arroyp Villasenor, chief security of
ficer for the national petroleum company PE
MEX, which operates the pipeline, said 40 per

sons were killed by the blast and 11 severely
burned. He said an earlier casualty toll of 52
dead and 21 injured resulted from incorrect
counting of the badly charred victims.
Small fires still burned in the area yesterday
afternoon. Gaston Rodriguez Ferrara, a pilot
employed by the state, said the explosion
wiped out large chunks of the highways and
left "a very deep crater approximately 240 feet
in diameter. Everything was wiped out."
Dow Jones falls 10.83
New York — Not even a visit by President
Jimmy Carter — whose administration
triggered the biggest run-up in Wall Street his
tory Wednesday by moving to strengthen the
dollar — could keep the stock market from
falling yesterday amid fears about what that
program would mean for already-high interest
rates.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial issues soared 35.34 points, the
biggest gain in its history, after the announce
ment of the dollar-strengthening plan.
But the widely watched average see-sawed
yesterday before closing with a drop of 10.83 to
816.%.
Although trading was active at 40.03 million
shares, it was substantially off Wednesday's
50.45 million-share pace.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patches of fog
or low overcast nights and mornings. Lows in
the 40s and lower 50s. Highs in the mid 60s to
mid 70s.
Dollar soars, gold prices fall
A dramatic boost in the overseas value of
U.S. currency greeted President Jimmy Car
ter's emergency save-the-dollar campaign yes
terday, but there were disturbing new signals
that his companion battle to curb inflation will
be long and hard.
Administration strategists were heartened
by reports from foreign exchange markets that
the dollar soared against every major West
European currency, while gold bullion prices
fell. In Tokyo, the dollar jumped by more than
4 percent against the Japanese yen in the first
hours of trading after Carter's announcement
Wednesday.
And in New York, the stock market dropped
by 10.8 points to 816.% in fairly heavy trading
yesterday, as investors sold for profit. How
ever, advances held a more than 2-1 lead over
declines after a buoyant day that saw the
largest single-session gain in history Wednes
day, a rise of 35.34 points.
Wholesale food prices rise
Washington — Wholesale food prices rose
sharply in October for the second straight
month, assuring shoppers they'll see more big
price jumps at grocery stores and signaling
sustained high inflation fortherestof theyear.
The Labor Department said yesterday that
wholeslale food prices alone jumped 1.7 per
cent last month, matching September for the
highest monthly rise since April.
Price hikes at this level translate into in
creases to shoppers in the coming months.
Food prices already have jumped 10 percent in
the first nine months of the year.
