"For 20 years, the Romanians have
hoped against hope that the Ameri
cans would come one day to liberate
(he country. America did not arrive.
Nobody in Romania waits for them
anymore," said Romanian novelist
and freedom-fighter Paul Goma in a
speech yesterday at the Meyer
Forum room.
"Fortunately, the government of
this country (America) is one thing
and the people of this country are
something else. You have the press,
public opinion anda numberof intel
ligent people who might help. This is
the reason why we try to inform

those who are free of thought and
who are objective enough to under
stand the realities of the day,"he
said.
Prisoner
One of" Romania's best known
novelists, Goma has spent almost
nine years in Romanian prisons and
work camps. According to George
Duca, Goma's translator at yester
day's lecture, "It is very difficult to
describe the life of someone who has
suffered so intensely as Mr. Goma
has for his political ideas.
"He was not quite 16 when he was
accused by the authorities," Duca
said, "not of doing something par

ticularly against the regime, but of
his attitude, utterances and gestures
that they considered traitorous, even
in a little boy of age 16. He was
thrown in jail for a year."
During later years, he served seven
more years in jail and was persecuted
to the point of near execution, Duca
said.
"We were persecuted, thrown into
jail and tortured," Goma said. "This
happened in Romania, a country you
believe is independent, democratic
and liberal. This is not true."
Goma is currently on a national
college tour lecturing about condi
