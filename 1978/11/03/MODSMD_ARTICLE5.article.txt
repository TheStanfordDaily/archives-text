"For 20 years, the Romanians have
hoped against hope that the Ameri
cans would come one day to liberate
(he country. America did not arrive.
Nobody in Romania waits for them
anymore," said Romanian novelist
and freedom-fighter Paul Goma in a
speech yesterday at the Meyer
Forum room.
"Fortunately, the government of
this country (America) is one thing
and the people of this country are
something else. You have the press,
public opinion anda numberof intel
ligent people who might help. This is
the reason why we try to inform

those who are free of thought and
who are objective enough to under
stand the realities of the day,"he
said.
Prisoner
One of" Romania's best known
novelists, Goma has spent almost
nine years in Romanian prisons and
work camps. According to George
Duca, Goma's translator at yester
day's lecture, "It is very difficult to
describe the life of someone who has
suffered so intensely as Mr. Goma
has for his political ideas.
"He was not quite 16 when he was
accused by the authorities," Duca
said, "not of doing something par

ticularly against the regime, but of
his attitude, utterances and gestures
that they considered traitorous, even
in a little boy of age 16. He was
thrown in jail for a year."
During later years, he served seven
more years in jail and was persecuted
to the point of near execution, Duca
said.
"We were persecuted, thrown into
jail and tortured," Goma said. "This
happened in Romania, a country you
believe is independent, democratic
and liberal. This is not true."
Goma is currently on a national
college tour lecturing about condi

!ions in present-day Romania. His
speech at the Meyer was co
sponsored by the ASSU Speakers'
Bureau and the Hoover Institute.
Coma described Romania's in
timidation of dissidents. "You are a
white-collar man who works for the
government and you are a known
dissident. One day you go to your
office. The next day the police call
you in, and for four, five, even eight
hours sometimes, they interrogate
you. Next day you go back to your
job and the whole thing starts over
again."
He also said that the Romanian Or
thodox Church is a tool of the state.
"I admit that I am ashamed to be an
Orthodox. I admit that the Church
has never been anything but a 'yes
man' to the government. They (the
Romanians) say that those at the
head of the Orthodox Church are
policemen dressed up as priests."
Coma said he was concerned over
American aid to Eastern European
countries.
U.S. aid
"The American government has
not only give Romania but other
countries in Soviet Russia all the
technology, agricultural products
. . . that they have asked for," Coma
said. "The reality is that all of this
never helped and never will help the
people. It helps the government
which oppresses the people."
Coma closed his speech with the
hope that his lecture helped expose
the truth about Romania:
"You, the students, the press, the
public organizations are helping by
just listening to people like me.
Romania is afraid of public foreign
opinion.
"We don't ask for money, con
tributions, or the American army,
only to listen and believe what we are
saying."

suffered so intensely as Mr. Goma
has for his political ideas.
"He was not quite 16 when he was
accused by the authorities," Duca
said, "not of doing something par

ticularly against the regime, but of
his attitude, utterances and gestures
that they considered traitorous, even
in a little boy of age 16. He was
thrown in jail for a year."
During later years, he served seven
more years in jail and was persecuted
to the point of near execution, Duca
said.
"We were persecuted, thrown into
jail and tortured," Goma said. "This
happened in Romania, a country you
believe is independent, democratic
and liberal. This is not true."
Goma is currently on a national
college tour lecturing about condi


Paul Goma
!ions in present-day Romania. His
speech at the Meyer was co
sponsored by the ASSU Speakers'
Bureau and the Hoover Institute.
Coma described Romania's in
timidation of dissidents. "You are a
white-collar man who works for the
government and you are a known
dissident. One day you go to your
office. The next day the police call
you in, and for four, five, even eight
hours sometimes, they interrogate
you. Next day you go back to your
job and the whole thing starts over
again."
He also said that the Romanian Or
thodox Church is a tool of the state.
"I admit that I am ashamed to be an
Orthodox. I admit that the Church
has never been anything but a 'yes
man' to the government. They (the
Romanians) say that those at the
head of the Orthodox Church are
policemen dressed up as priests."
Coma said he was concerned over
American aid to Eastern European
countries.
U.S. aid
"The American government has
not only give Romania but other
countries in Soviet Russia all the
technology, agricultural products
. . . that they have asked for," Coma
said. "The reality is that all of this
never helped and never will help the
people. It helps the government
which oppresses the people."
Coma closed his speech with the
hope that his lecture helped expose
the truth about Romania:
"You, the students, the press, the
public organizations are helping by
just listening to people like me.
Romania is afraid of public foreign
opinion.
"We don't ask for money, con
tributions, or the American army,
only to listen and believe what we are
saying."
"For 20 years, the Romanians have
hoped against hope that the Ameri
cans would come one day to liberate
(he country. America did not arrive.
Nobody in Romania waits for them
anymore," said Romanian novelist
and freedom-fighter Paul Goma in a
speech yesterday at the Meyer
Forum room.
"Fortunately, the government of
this country (America) is one thing
and the people of this country are
something else. You have the press,
public opinion anda numberof intel
ligent people who might help. This is
the reason why we try to inform

those who are free of thought and
who are objective enough to under
stand the realities of the day,"he
said.
Prisoner
One of" Romania's best known
novelists, Goma has spent almost
nine years in Romanian prisons and
work camps. According to George
Duca, Goma's translator at yester
day's lecture, "It is very difficult to
describe the life of someone who has
suffered so intensely as Mr. Goma
has for his political ideas.
