# Late night attempt to steal Big Game Axe ends in failure
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
An apparent attempt to steal the Axe, symbol of Big
Came rivalry, failed early yesterday, according to
University police.
They said three men were seen leaving the area
near the Axe's Tresidder Union display case, shortly
after 12:35 a.m. The janitors who saw the men said, in
a statement to police, that one of the three carried a
hammer.
The Department of Public Safety said two blows
were struck at the case "with a heavy object like a
sledgehammer," but the glass was only cracked, not
broken.
The force of the blows set off an alarm, police said,
which brought officers to the scene within minutes.
The Axe has been removed from its case, until the
glass is replaced. Police refused to disclose its loca
tion. They said it will be some time before special
laminated glass for the case is available.
Even if the glass had broken, it would have been
impossible to remove the Axe, said Doug Williams,
communication officer for the public safety depart
ment.
He said the Axe fits very tightly into the case and the
plaque to which it is attached ordinarily cannot be
removed from the case window.
The Axe is kept in a case next to the Alpha Phi

Omega ride board and the Sequoia Travel Center in
Tresidder Union. The corridor is left unlocked until 1
or 2 a.m. to provide access to restrooms from the
Tresidder Coffee House.
The Coffee House was closed at the time of the
incident, but employees were still in the building.
Traditionally, Stanford and Berkeley students try to
take the Axe from each other and hold onto it for as
long as possible. It originally belonged to Stanford
but Cal stole it in 1899 and retained unlawful posses
sion for 31 years.
In 1930, the "Immortal 21" orchestrated an attack
on the Axe pretending to be news photographers
who wanted to take pictures of it.
Since then, the Axe has been awarded to the win
ner of the Big Came.
The Axe has been stolen eight times since 1930,
most recently in 1973, when three students in the
Theta Delt fraternity pulled off what they called a
"simple, smooth" heist.
One posed over the phone as then-Cal football
coach Mike White, luring Berkeley students, Axe in
hand, to a Palo Alto restaurant. With the other two
disguised as letter-jacketed Cal athletes, the Theta
Delts made off with the trophy from the restaurant
parking lot, just yards from where the bona fide Mike
White was eating lunch.

hammer.
The Department of Public Safety said two blows
were struck at the case "with a heavy object like a
sledgehammer," but the glass was only cracked, not
broken.
The force of the blows set off an alarm, police said,
which brought officers to the scene within minutes.
The Axe has been removed from its case, until the
glass is replaced. Police refused to disclose its loca
tion. They said it will be some time before special
laminated glass for the case is available.
Even if the glass had broken, it would have been
impossible to remove the Axe, said Doug Williams,
communication officer for the public safety depart
ment.
He said the Axe fits very tightly into the case and the
plaque to which it is attached ordinarily cannot be
removed from the case window.
The Axe is kept in a case next to the Alpha Phi

Omega ride board and the Sequoia Travel Center in
Tresidder Union. The corridor is left unlocked until 1
or 2 a.m. to provide access to restrooms from the
Tresidder Coffee House.
The Coffee House was closed at the time of the
incident, but employees were still in the building.
Traditionally, Stanford and Berkeley students try to
take the Axe from each other and hold onto it for as
long as possible. It originally belonged to Stanford
but Cal stole it in 1899 and retained unlawful posses
sion for 31 years.
In 1930, the "Immortal 21" orchestrated an attack
on the Axe pretending to be news photographers
who wanted to take pictures of it.
Since then, the Axe has been awarded to the win
ner of the Big Came.
The Axe has been stolen eight times since 1930,
most recently in 1973, when three students in the
Theta Delt fraternity pulled off what they called a
"simple, smooth" heist.
One posed over the phone as then-Cal football
coach Mike White, luring Berkeley students, Axe in
hand, to a Palo Alto restaurant. With the other two
disguised as letter-jacketed Cal athletes, the Theta
Delts made off with the trophy from the restaurant
parking lot, just yards from where the bona fide Mike
White was eating lunch.

early yesterday morning, but were scared off by the alarm.
