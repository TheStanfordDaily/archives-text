# Hollywood has stellar election role
## 
### 
Hollywood (AP) — Hollywood, the magic
place that gave us "Celebrith Bowling,"
has a similar new project already deeply in
the works — "Celebrity Politicking."
Like its kin show, "Celebrity Politicking"
is a fun game that delivers lots of stars to
compensate for what it lacks in substance.
Best of all, it's a show with a built-in cancel
lation date — Nov. 8, the day after elec
tions.
"Celebrity Politicking" goes something
like this. You need two candidates, a
lackluster contest, a stable of celebrities
for each side and, most important, an
apathetic electorate.
Apathy is crucial to the game. Without it,
candidates wouldn't need celebrities to
grab the attention of the voters, and an
election could be decided on issues alone.
The idea is for each candidate to attract
as many voters as possible with his stance,
or stances, on the issues. Then he pulls out
the stars. If you don't like his political
posture (postures) maybe you'll like the
fact that The Muppets are in his corner.
The celebrities help their candidate with
fund-raisers, commericals, public appear
ances, endorsements, donations and all
around association with their favorite
politico.
California's race for the 27th Congres
sional District is an example of "Celebrity

Politicking" at is finest. In fact, the race
between Rep. Robert Dornan and Carey
Peck has been dubbed "Star Wars" for all
the glimmer and glamour fallout the fray
has produced.
Dornan is a former TV newscaster, a
celebrity's celebrity in these parts.
Peck...well, Gregory, the actor, is his dad.
Young Peck counts on his side such
lumninaries as his famous father and
many of his famous father's famous
friends — including Liza Minnelli,
Charlton Heston and Cheryl Ladd.
In Dornan's corner luminate Pat Boone
and his singing dauhter, Debby, plus the
Tin Man from"The Wizard of Oz" Jack
Haley and singin' cowboy Gene Autrey.
Linda sings support
In the governor's race, singers Helen
Reddy and Linda Ronstadt are pulling for
Gov. Jerry Brown. So are Red Buttons, Lily
Tomlin and Cindy Williams.
Brown's opponent, Evelle Younger,
hasn't really proven adept at "Celebrity
Politicking," but his running mate,
lieutenant governor candidate Mike Curb,
a record company executive, is a living
example of the hidden wisdom behind the
game.
In fact, Curb entered politics by supply
ing recording stars to Republican soirees
in need of a little light. Candidates are not

always necessary to the game, only the
stars.
For example, one of the state's hottest
issues, Proposition 5, promises to limit
smoking in public places, and among
those lending their names in support are
Michael York, Carol Burnett and Charlton
Heston.

One of the most-in-demand celebrities
this Fall season is not a movie star, but an
ornery old man who cusses and hollers
when he faces a crowds — Howard Jarvis,
the father of California's anti-property tax
initiative, Proposition 13.
Any politician with a damp finger to the
wind knows this is the season to anti-tax
and anti-government spending, and Jarvis
is the personification of those sentiments.
Those seeking his support for their can
didacies "are lining up like Goddamned
lemmings," he says.
To get Jarvis' endorsement is even bet
ter than getting John Wayne's. In fact,
John Wayne may someday play Howard
Jarvis is a movie.
But Jarvis is not your normal "Celebrity
Politicker." He isn't what you'd call a team
player. He'll endorse anyone who has ever
uttered a kindness about Proposition 13.
He has cut commericials for both Younger
and Brown in the governor's race.

The idea is for each candidate to attract
as many voters as possible with his stance,
or stances, on the issues. Then he pulls out
the stars. If you don't like his political
posture (postures) maybe you'll like the
fact that The Muppets are in his corner.
The celebrities help their candidate with
fund-raisers, commericals, public appear
ances, endorsements, donations and all
around association with their favorite
politico.
California's race for the 27th Congres
sional District is an example of "Celebrity

Politicking" at is finest. In fact, the race
between Rep. Robert Dornan and Carey
Peck has been dubbed "Star Wars" for all
the glimmer and glamour fallout the fray
has produced.
Dornan is a former TV newscaster, a
celebrity's celebrity in these parts.
Peck...well, Gregory, the actor, is his dad.
Young Peck counts on his side such
lumninaries as his famous father and
many of his famous father's famous
friends — including Liza Minnelli,
Charlton Heston and Cheryl Ladd.
In Dornan's corner luminate Pat Boone
and his singing dauhter, Debby, plus the
Tin Man from"The Wizard of Oz" Jack
Haley and singin' cowboy Gene Autrey.
Linda sings support
In the governor's race, singers Helen
Reddy and Linda Ronstadt are pulling for
Gov. Jerry Brown. So are Red Buttons, Lily
Tomlin and Cindy Williams.
Brown's opponent, Evelle Younger,
hasn't really proven adept at "Celebrity
Politicking," but his running mate,
lieutenant governor candidate Mike Curb,
a record company executive, is a living
example of the hidden wisdom behind the
game.
In fact, Curb entered politics by supply
ing recording stars to Republican soirees
in need of a little light. Candidates are not

always necessary to the game, only the
stars.
For example, one of the state's hottest
issues, Proposition 5, promises to limit
smoking in public places, and among
those lending their names in support are
Michael York, Carol Burnett and Charlton
Heston.

One of the most-in-demand celebrities
this Fall season is not a movie star, but an
ornery old man who cusses and hollers
when he faces a crowds — Howard Jarvis,
the father of California's anti-property tax
initiative, Proposition 13.
Any politician with a damp finger to the
wind knows this is the season to anti-tax
and anti-government spending, and Jarvis
is the personification of those sentiments.
Those seeking his support for their can
didacies "are lining up like Goddamned
lemmings," he says.
To get Jarvis' endorsement is even bet
ter than getting John Wayne's. In fact,
John Wayne may someday play Howard
Jarvis is a movie.
But Jarvis is not your normal "Celebrity
Politicker." He isn't what you'd call a team
player. He'll endorse anyone who has ever
uttered a kindness about Proposition 13.
He has cut commericials for both Younger
and Brown in the governor's race.
Hollywood (AP) — Hollywood, the magic
place that gave us "Celebrith Bowling,"
has a similar new project already deeply in
the works — "Celebrity Politicking."
Like its kin show, "Celebrity Politicking"
is a fun game that delivers lots of stars to
compensate for what it lacks in substance.
Best of all, it's a show with a built-in cancel
lation date — Nov. 8, the day after elec
tions.
"Celebrity Politicking" goes something
like this. You need two candidates, a
lackluster contest, a stable of celebrities
for each side and, most important, an
apathetic electorate.
Apathy is crucial to the game. Without it,
candidates wouldn't need celebrities to
grab the attention of the voters, and an
election could be decided on issues alone.
