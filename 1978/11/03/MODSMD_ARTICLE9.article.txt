# Tough attorney general's race one of big contrasts
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — If Yvonne Burke, California's
first black congresswoman, becomes the na
tion's first elected female state attorney general,
she will have overcome a tough law-and-order
foe, state Sen. George Deukmejian.
The 46-year-old Democrat, daughter of a
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer janitor, started out in a
yellow stucco house in the Los Angeles ghetto,
later became a lawyer, three-term as
semblywoman and three-term congresswoman.
"If I did not expect to win, I would not run,"
the beautiful, impeccably dressed woman told
reporters the day she announced her candidacy
in February.
Now between her and Nov. 7 election victory
stands a 50-year-old Deukmejian, a 16-yearvete
ran of the Legislature who is Republican floor
leader of the Senate and author of California's
death penalty law.
In an era when more and more Californians
live in fear of crime, Mrs. Burke has a major
problem: She is a liberal Democrat running for
the job of top state prosecutor.
Soft on crime
And Deukmejian, in his low-key, persistent
way, bears down on that point. His message is
simple: Californians can't afford to have an at
torney general like Burke who would be
soft on crime.
Mrs. Burke has her own message: Deukme
jian is too pro-special interests to protect con
sumers.
Deukmejian plans to spend about
$600,000and Mrs. Burke up to $850,000 putting
these messages across.
The polls — confounding some political ex
perts who swore California wasn't ready for a
liberal black woman in this job — show
Deukmejian trailing a few points behind Mrs.
Burke.
So there he is — son of an Armenian
businessman, out on the campaign trail trying
for a post that he failed to get once before, when
he lost the 1970 COP primary.
Loaded with crime statistics, he daily repeats
his contention that Mrs. Burke supports ultra
liberal causes while he would be tough on
crime.
No confidence
In his gentlemanly way, Deukmejian also
stresses Mrs. Burke would not have law en
forcement's confidence if she were elected to
succeed Evelle Younger, who is running for
governor.
In his subdued attack, Deukmejian talks little
about consumer fraud or environmental suits,
two other areas the attorney general oversees.
His clear focus is street crime and tough prison
sentences.
His television commericals all carry the
pledge: "When I'm your attorney general, if
someone commits a crime, they are going to pay
the price."
It is a focus that comes easily for Deukmejian,
who has been on friendly terms with officers
since he was growing up near Albany, N.Y., in a
flat next to the police and fire station.
Mrs. Burke's commericals stress her qualifica
tions. In one she says, "I've always believed you
can accomplish great things if you're not afraid
to reach out and explore new ground."

She has also challenged Deukmejian to reveal
his law firm's clients and questioning some of
his votes on consumer issues.
Because polls show Deukmejian lagging be
hind, hampered by the Democratic Party's 3-2
registraton edge, some campaign strategists had
expected he would hit harder than he has.
And Mrs. Burke has some vulnerable points.
The most obvious one is that she is a black
woman running for the post billed as the state's
"top cop," although the job actually involves
much appeal work and little street crime pro
secution.
First woman
She would be the first woman ever elected to
that post in this country. The closest a woman
ever came before was when Pennsylvania's gov
ernor appoi nted a female state attorney general,
Ann Alpern, from 1959-1961.
Mrs. Burke also would be only the second
black to hold the post, after Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts.
However, Mrs. Burke has had some defend
ing to do out on the campaign trail if she is to
reach those landmarks.
At a San Francisco debate, Deukmejian
paraded the fact he has introduced numerous
law-and-order bills and said her voting record
showed an anti-law enforcement stance.
Mrs. Burke was consistently on the defensive,
and after a second debate where Deukmejian
repeated his charge that she had a terrible law
enforcement record, she bowed out of their
third debate.
Ample time
Her campaign's stated reason was that she
had not been given ample time to discuss as
pects of the office that she felt were important.
Later, by making his own 1977 federal income
tax report public, Deukmejian put the limelight
on his personal finances and demanded similar
details from Mrs. Burke.
Deukmejian revealed he and his wife had a
net worth of about $156,000. Mrs. Burke then
revealed she and her husband, William Burke,
have a net worth of $733,500.
Burke's real political liability in connection
with her husband is not the couple's net woth,
however. It is that Burke, a funeral home owner
she married in 1972, is a former consultant to a
prepaid health plan, Omni-Rx, that is now the
target of two state suits and one federal suit.
Two suits
While Deukmejian has avoided making an
issue of this fact, it is the attorney general's
office that is prosecuting the two state suits
against Omni-Rx, which is now in receivership.
Mrs. Burke emphasizes her husband is not a
defendant in the cases and says she would have
no problem prosecuting the cases. When
people, such as a lady who called into a radio
talk show, asked about Omni-Rx, Mrs. Burke
gives few details and drops the matter quickly.
Through it all, Deukmejian moves from cam
paign appearance to appearance, insisting his
anticrime record and strong law enforcement
backing make him the ideal candidate.
His campaign slogans use his nickname —
"Duke" — in a clear hope that voters w\U re
member that if they can't remember his difficult
last name, pronounced Duke-may-jin.

In an era when more and more Californians
live in fear of crime, Mrs. Burke has a major
problem: She is a liberal Democrat running for
the job of top state prosecutor.
Soft on crime
And Deukmejian, in his low-key, persistent
way, bears down on that point. His message is
simple: Californians can't afford to have an at
torney general like Burke who would be
soft on crime.
Mrs. Burke has her own message: Deukme
jian is too pro-special interests to protect con
sumers.
Deukmejian plans to spend about
$600,000and Mrs. Burke up to $850,000 putting
these messages across.
The polls — confounding some political ex
perts who swore California wasn't ready for a
liberal black woman in this job — show
Deukmejian trailing a few points behind Mrs.
Burke.
So there he is — son of an Armenian
businessman, out on the campaign trail trying
for a post that he failed to get once before, when
he lost the 1970 COP primary.
Loaded with crime statistics, he daily repeats
his contention that Mrs. Burke supports ultra
liberal causes while he would be tough on
crime.
No confidence
In his gentlemanly way, Deukmejian also
stresses Mrs. Burke would not have law en
forcement's confidence if she were elected to
succeed Evelle Younger, who is running for
governor.
In his subdued attack, Deukmejian talks little
about consumer fraud or environmental suits,
two other areas the attorney general oversees.
His clear focus is street crime and tough prison
sentences.
His television commericals all carry the
pledge: "When I'm your attorney general, if
someone commits a crime, they are going to pay
the price."
It is a focus that comes easily for Deukmejian,
who has been on friendly terms with officers
since he was growing up near Albany, N.Y., in a
flat next to the police and fire station.
Mrs. Burke's commericals stress her qualifica
tions. In one she says, "I've always believed you
can accomplish great things if you're not afraid
to reach out and explore new ground."

She has also challenged Deukmejian to reveal
his law firm's clients and questioning some of
his votes on consumer issues.
Because polls show Deukmejian lagging be
hind, hampered by the Democratic Party's 3-2
registraton edge, some campaign strategists had
expected he would hit harder than he has.
And Mrs. Burke has some vulnerable points.
The most obvious one is that she is a black
woman running for the post billed as the state's
"top cop," although the job actually involves
much appeal work and little street crime pro
secution.
First woman
She would be the first woman ever elected to
that post in this country. The closest a woman
ever came before was when Pennsylvania's gov
ernor appoi nted a female state attorney general,
Ann Alpern, from 1959-1961.
Mrs. Burke also would be only the second
black to hold the post, after Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts.
However, Mrs. Burke has had some defend
ing to do out on the campaign trail if she is to
reach those landmarks.
At a San Francisco debate, Deukmejian
paraded the fact he has introduced numerous
law-and-order bills and said her voting record
showed an anti-law enforcement stance.
Mrs. Burke was consistently on the defensive,
and after a second debate where Deukmejian
repeated his charge that she had a terrible law
enforcement record, she bowed out of their
third debate.
Ample time
Her campaign's stated reason was that she
had not been given ample time to discuss as
pects of the office that she felt were important.
Later, by making his own 1977 federal income
tax report public, Deukmejian put the limelight
on his personal finances and demanded similar
details from Mrs. Burke.
Deukmejian revealed he and his wife had a
net worth of about $156,000. Mrs. Burke then
revealed she and her husband, William Burke,
have a net worth of $733,500.
Burke's real political liability in connection
with her husband is not the couple's net woth,
however. It is that Burke, a funeral home owner
she married in 1972, is a former consultant to a
prepaid health plan, Omni-Rx, that is now the
target of two state suits and one federal suit.
Two suits
While Deukmejian has avoided making an
issue of this fact, it is the attorney general's
office that is prosecuting the two state suits
against Omni-Rx, which is now in receivership.
Mrs. Burke emphasizes her husband is not a
defendant in the cases and says she would have
no problem prosecuting the cases. When
people, such as a lady who called into a radio
talk show, asked about Omni-Rx, Mrs. Burke
gives few details and drops the matter quickly.
Through it all, Deukmejian moves from cam
paign appearance to appearance, insisting his
anticrime record and strong law enforcement
backing make him the ideal candidate.
His campaign slogans use his nickname —
"Duke" — in a clear hope that voters w\U re
member that if they can't remember his difficult
last name, pronounced Duke-may-jin.
Sacramento (AP) — If Yvonne Burke, California's

businessman, out on the campaign trail trying
for a post that he failed to get once before, when
he lost the 1970 COP primary.
Loaded with crime statistics, he daily repeats
his contention that Mrs. Burke supports ultra
liberal causes while he would be tough on
crime.
No confidence
In his gentlemanly way, Deukmejian also
stresses Mrs. Burke would not have law en
forcement's confidence if she were elected to
succeed Evelle Younger, who is running for
governor.
In his subdued attack, Deukmejian talks little
about consumer fraud or environmental suits,
two other areas the attorney general oversees.
His clear focus is street crime and tough prison
sentences.
His television commericals all carry the
pledge: "When I'm your attorney general, if
someone commits a crime, they are going to pay
the price."
It is a focus that comes easily for Deukmejian,
who has been on friendly terms with officers
since he was growing up near Albany, N.Y., in a
flat next to the police and fire station.
Mrs. Burke's commericals stress her qualifica
tions. In one she says, "I've always believed you
can accomplish great things if you're not afraid
to reach out and explore new ground."

She has also challenged Deukmejian to reveal
his law firm's clients and questioning some of
his votes on consumer issues.
Because polls show Deukmejian lagging be
hind, hampered by the Democratic Party's 3-2
registraton edge, some campaign strategists had
expected he would hit harder than he has.
And Mrs. Burke has some vulnerable points.
The most obvious one is that she is a black
woman running for the post billed as the state's
"top cop," although the job actually involves
much appeal work and little street crime pro
secution.
First woman
She would be the first woman ever elected to
that post in this country. The closest a woman
ever came before was when Pennsylvania's gov
ernor appoi nted a female state attorney general,
Ann Alpern, from 1959-1961.
Mrs. Burke also would be only the second
black to hold the post, after Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts.
However, Mrs. Burke has had some defend
ing to do out on the campaign trail if she is to
reach those landmarks.
At a San Francisco debate, Deukmejian
paraded the fact he has introduced numerous
law-and-order bills and said her voting record
showed an anti-law enforcement stance.
Mrs. Burke was consistently on the defensive,
and after a second debate where Deukmejian
repeated his charge that she had a terrible law
enforcement record, she bowed out of their
third debate.
Ample time
Her campaign's stated reason was that she
had not been given ample time to discuss as
pects of the office that she felt were important.
Later, by making his own 1977 federal income
tax report public, Deukmejian put the limelight
on his personal finances and demanded similar
details from Mrs. Burke.
Deukmejian revealed he and his wife had a
net worth of about $156,000. Mrs. Burke then
revealed she and her husband, William Burke,
have a net worth of $733,500.
Burke's real political liability in connection
with her husband is not the couple's net woth,
however. It is that Burke, a funeral home owner
she married in 1972, is a former consultant to a
prepaid health plan, Omni-Rx, that is now the
target of two state suits and one federal suit.
Two suits
While Deukmejian has avoided making an
issue of this fact, it is the attorney general's
office that is prosecuting the two state suits
against Omni-Rx, which is now in receivership.
Mrs. Burke emphasizes her husband is not a
defendant in the cases and says she would have
no problem prosecuting the cases. When
people, such as a lady who called into a radio
talk show, asked about Omni-Rx, Mrs. Burke
gives few details and drops the matter quickly.
Through it all, Deukmejian moves from cam
paign appearance to appearance, insisting his
anticrime record and strong law enforcement
backing make him the ideal candidate.
His campaign slogans use his nickname —
"Duke" — in a clear hope that voters w\U re
member that if they can't remember his difficult
last name, pronounced Duke-may-jin.
Sacramento (AP) — If Yvonne Burke, California's
first black congresswoman, becomes the na
tion's first elected female state attorney general,
she will have overcome a tough law-and-order
foe, state Sen. George Deukmejian.
The 46-year-old Democrat, daughter of a
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer janitor, started out in a
yellow stucco house in the Los Angeles ghetto,
later became a lawyer, three-term as
semblywoman and three-term congresswoman.
"If I did not expect to win, I would not run,"
the beautiful, impeccably dressed woman told
reporters the day she announced her candidacy
in February.
Now between her and Nov. 7 election victory
stands a 50-year-old Deukmejian, a 16-yearvete
ran of the Legislature who is Republican floor
leader of the Senate and author of California's
death penalty law.
In an era when more and more Californians
live in fear of crime, Mrs. Burke has a major
problem: She is a liberal Democrat running for
the job of top state prosecutor.
Soft on crime
And Deukmejian, in his low-key, persistent
way, bears down on that point. His message is
simple: Californians can't afford to have an at
torney general like Burke who would be
soft on crime.
Mrs. Burke has her own message: Deukme
jian is too pro-special interests to protect con
sumers.
Deukmejian plans to spend about
$600,000and Mrs. Burke up to $850,000 putting
these messages across.
The polls — confounding some political ex
perts who swore California wasn't ready for a
liberal black woman in this job — show
Deukmejian trailing a few points behind Mrs.
Burke.
