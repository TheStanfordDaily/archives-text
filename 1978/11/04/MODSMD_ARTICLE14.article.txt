# A 						'little' technician who isn't so small at all
## 
### YVONNE RANDLE 
A 6-foot-3 offensive guard
who tips the scale at 240
pounds would certainly not be
considered "little" by most
people's standards. But, to
Stanford's football team, just
such an individual, Jim
Stephens, is known as "Little
Jimmy."
Stephens, a transfer from
Butte Junior College (Chicoj,
said that even though he is still
known as "little" he is no
longer the smallest lineman.
He added, however, that while
he had been one of the largest
linemen in his JC conference,
he was "astounded by the

size" of his teammates when
he first arrived here. Remark
ing about his size, he said, "It
made me realize that I had to
learn techniques."
This perfecting of technique
is the means to a successful
game for Stephens.. Offensive
Line Coach Doug Single said,
"Jim's major asset is that he
makes no mistakes on the
field. He is very intelligent and
knows the assignments of
everyone."
As offensive guard,,
Stephens' main respon
sibilities on the field are run
blocking and pass protection.
According to Coach Single, the

senior lineman is "both effec
tive and efficient" in the way he
performs the duties that he is
assigned.
In the area of blocking,
Stephens claims that he has an
advantage due to his size. "I
have more leverage than taller
men," he said. "I can get lower
than a taller opponent and this
puts him at a disadvantage."
His other assignment, he
claims is the most difficult of
the two: "Pass protection is the
hardest thing a football player
can learn to do, because it's so
unnatural," said Stephens.
"Experience is a lot of it."
Experience is exactly what

Stephens got, first as a red
shirt, and then as a starter in
mid-season of last year.
It took not only experience,
but a lot of dedication to move
up to the starting position and
to retain it. Coach Single com
mented that, "No one's
worked harder than Jim. He
developed into a starter with a
lot of persistence and hard
work."
Stephens exhibits this per
sistence and hard work not
only on the field, but off as
well. While some people may
think that athletes only go to
college to participate in a
sport, the human biology
major can attest to the fact that
school work is just as difficult
for the athlete as for any one
else, if not more so. "Football
can take up to 64 hours a week
and it saps your energy. While
other people are up studying
you find yourself falling asleep
at eleven o'clock," Stephens
said.
The problem of not getting
enough sleep may be inten
sified by the fact that Stephens
lives in a fraternity, Delta Tau
Delta. He is currently serving
as Vice President and was in
volved in the organization of
today's canned food drive to
benefit the elderly.
Going to school and playing
football in a major university in
the Bay Area is quite a transi
tion for the Chico native. In
fact, Stephens said that he is
always getting asked questions
like "What's in Chico?" and

"What's it like being from the
back woods?" But, Stephens
said that he likes his hometown
and enjoys being from there.
Since he aspires to become a
dentist, a great deal of his time
at Stanford has been spent
studying. And while Stephens
said that the time spent on
football could cause some
problems, he also added that
the pressure which results
from playing football, added to
that of the classroom, can be a
valuable experience to have.
"It takes will power and
strength to hang in there. The
thing is to not let either one
(classroom or football) take
you low."
For Stephens, playing on the
offensive line is not a low, but a
high. He said that he likes play
ing guard because of a certain
rapport that develops between
the linemen. "The line is a play
ing unit and team work is really
important to me," he said.
Stephens said that this is
what really appeals to him:
"The team thing." Last year, a
member of the team with
whom he shared the respon
sibilities of the line was offen
sive tackle Gordon King. It was
King who was instrumental in
the acquisition of his present
nickname, "Little Insignificant
Jimmy Stephens."
However, a letter which
Stephens received from King
this year may make the name
have more meaning, for King
summed it up by saying, "He's
the littlest, but the best."

worked harder than Jim. He
developed into a starter with a
lot of persistence and hard
work."
Stephens exhibits this per
sistence and hard work not
only on the field, but off as
well. While some people may
think that athletes only go to
college to participate in a
sport, the human biology
major can attest to the fact that
school work is just as difficult
for the athlete as for any one
else, if not more so. "Football
can take up to 64 hours a week
and it saps your energy. While
other people are up studying
you find yourself falling asleep
at eleven o'clock," Stephens
said.
The problem of not getting
enough sleep may be inten
sified by the fact that Stephens
lives in a fraternity, Delta Tau
Delta. He is currently serving
as Vice President and was in
volved in the organization of
today's canned food drive to
benefit the elderly.
Going to school and playing
football in a major university in
the Bay Area is quite a transi
tion for the Chico native. In
fact, Stephens said that he is
always getting asked questions
like "What's in Chico?" and

"What's it like being from the
back woods?" But, Stephens
said that he likes his hometown
and enjoys being from there.
Since he aspires to become a
dentist, a great deal of his time
at Stanford has been spent
studying. And while Stephens
said that the time spent on
football could cause some
problems, he also added that
the pressure which results
from playing football, added to
that of the classroom, can be a
valuable experience to have.
"It takes will power and
strength to hang in there. The
thing is to not let either one
(classroom or football) take
you low."
For Stephens, playing on the
offensive line is not a low, but a
high. He said that he likes play
ing guard because of a certain
rapport that develops between
the linemen. "The line is a play
ing unit and team work is really
important to me," he said.
Stephens said that this is
what really appeals to him:
"The team thing." Last year, a
member of the team with
whom he shared the respon
sibilities of the line was offen
sive tackle Gordon King. It was
King who was instrumental in
the acquisition of his present
nickname, "Little Insignificant
Jimmy Stephens."
However, a letter which
Stephens received from King
this year may make the name
have more meaning, for King
summed it up by saying, "He's
the littlest, but the best."

Cardinal Offensive Guard, Jim Stephens (63), doing what he does best: run blocking. He is shown here,
holding back the Beaver defense in last week's game, in order to give running back, Darrin Nelson (31) an
open highway to the goal.
A 6-foot-3 offensive guard
who tips the scale at 240
pounds would certainly not be
considered "little" by most
people's standards. But, to
Stanford's football team, just
such an individual, Jim
Stephens, is known as "Little
Jimmy."
Stephens, a transfer from
Butte Junior College (Chicoj,
said that even though he is still
known as "little" he is no
longer the smallest lineman.
He added, however, that while
he had been one of the largest
linemen in his JC conference,
he was "astounded by the

size" of his teammates when
he first arrived here. Remark
ing about his size, he said, "It
made me realize that I had to
learn techniques."
This perfecting of technique
is the means to a successful
game for Stephens.. Offensive
Line Coach Doug Single said,
"Jim's major asset is that he
makes no mistakes on the
field. He is very intelligent and
knows the assignments of
everyone."
As offensive guard,,
Stephens' main respon
sibilities on the field are run
blocking and pass protection.
According to Coach Single, the

senior lineman is "both effec
tive and efficient" in the way he
performs the duties that he is
assigned.
In the area of blocking,
Stephens claims that he has an
advantage due to his size. "I
have more leverage than taller
men," he said. "I can get lower
than a taller opponent and this
puts him at a disadvantage."
His other assignment, he
claims is the most difficult of
the two: "Pass protection is the
hardest thing a football player
can learn to do, because it's so
unnatural," said Stephens.
"Experience is a lot of it."
Experience is exactly what

Stephens got, first as a red
shirt, and then as a starter in
mid-season of last year.
It took not only experience,
but a lot of dedication to move
up to the starting position and
to retain it. Coach Single com
mented that, "No one's
worked harder than Jim. He
developed into a starter with a
lot of persistence and hard
work."

sive tackle Gordon King. It was
King who was instrumental in

summed it up by saying, "He's
the littlest, but the best."
