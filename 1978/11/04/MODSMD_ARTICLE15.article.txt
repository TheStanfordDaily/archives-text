# LSJUMB sets for the Trojan 'Animal Team'
## 
### KEN JOHNSON 
Greetings alumni, alumnae
and alothers. For those of you
who may see no other football
game at Stanford this year, this
is your chance to see if Cardi
nals, Trojans, or LSJUMB's ever
change. Caveat videoditor!
Before the game begins, the
audience is asked to powder its
noses and gargle suitably
strong medicine in preparation
for the lights and sounds of
Hollywood cinema.

As the last available beams of
sunlight over Lost Angeles drift
out to the ocean, movie pro
ducers are forced to move the
sites of outdoor filming to sun
nier climes. Hence the Bay
Area's growing importance in
the film world. After its a-word
winning performances in "Two
Minute Warning" and Dr. De
mented's dream fantasies, the
LSJUMB has attracted movie
companies to film both pre
game performances.
First, the University of
Southern Conshohocken pre
sents scenes from its autobiog
raphical documentary "Animal
Team." (Parental guidance
needed.) In the first scene we
see pseudo-student/athletes
Pluto and VJ-Day weaving
home from an evening's ablu
tions on the Strip. The USC
band depicts our dynamic

duo's Deathomatic crossing
the median strip and crashing
into another car containing a
family of three, and then the
fun begins!

VJ eloquently curses at the
father in five yet-unknown lan
guages as Pluto playfully wraps
a tire iron around the head of
the eleven-year old daughter.
As the blood begins to flow,
our wacky sickos frolic in the
best Peckinpaughian tradition.

In the next scene Pluto and
VJ have been placed on
"double-secret demotion" to
the second team, but watch as
these Hun knees, elbows, and
fists are used for contract work
on opposition quarterbacks,
running backs, and receivers.
This scene will be completed in
the course of today's game, so
keep your binoculars trained
on your favorite USC animals
as they gouge, kick, and bite
their way to Hollywood star
dom and the Trojan honor roll.

In the final scene, the SiCk
band recreates their own
memorable performance in
and on a short subject at
peace-loving Berkeley last sea
son. See the Trojan helmet
"borrowed." See the Goon
Squad politely ask for the re
turn of the haberdashery as
they subtly aye-for-an-eyely
break the bones of the thief.

Listen to the heart-rending
apology, while the sounds of
violence fill the air.
In the second half of our
movie matinee, the Stanford
Band takes the field for a more
cerebral selection, a historical
mellowdrama portraying the
famous Greece versus Troy tilt
of centuries past.
First, however, this being a
low-budget production, the
Band offers for auction an old
double-bladed relic from the
back lot of the University City
studios. Donations in any
form, animal, vegetable, her
bal, or silver, will be accepted.
In the original plan, the first
scene was to feature a cast of
thousands depicting the Sack
of Troy. Economic reality and a
fear of the effect of violence on
children have altered the final
version of this scene. As the
LSJUMB portrays the sacking of
that ancient city, the audience
is invited to become Greek,

singing to the Trojan adver
saries "You're No Good."
The siege of Troy required
much back-and-forth volleying
as the attack was mounted to
break through the protective
walls. As the rams battered
against the Trojan defenses,
the frustrated wallbangers
found that "It Don't Come
Easy."
The ingenious Greeks cried
out "There Ain't Nothing
Stopping Us Now" as they
slipped into the Trojan whorse,
bringing the struggle to an ex
citing climax.
Lighting a victory cigarette,
the LSJUMB takes its Oddacy
back to the homeland. Re
joyceing, yes, at the figtrees in
the Alameda gardens yes and
all the queer little streets yes I
said yes I will Yes. play the Na
tional Anthem.
One certain thing in football
is halftime.
In life and time, the only cer

tain things are death and poli
tics. Having tenderly treated
the former category last week,
the Band, advised by one of its
consorts, Polly Sigh, takes up
the latter to climb aboard the
bandwagon leading to Election
Day next Tuesday.
As students of life as well as
the University, the LSJUMB
worries about the fate of its
members if PROP SIX should
pass. Can we learn any better if
the PROF's SEX is changed?
Teachers forced to visit the
parts exchange at the Stanford
Hospital will be asked "Who
Are You" by their classes when
they return, and sexual confu
sion will reign.
That problem is not the
Guv's, as he seeks re-election.
Jerry has found security with
his not-too-common-law
friend Linda. As this terribly
romantic relationship con
tinues, with Jerry entering in
and out or Linda's lite, tne Band
wonders if perhaps loss of cre
dibility and the election may
end this fascinating supply of
gossip column fodder, and J.B.
finding himself a "Three Time
Loser."
Another number in the news
is Five. If the people proposes,
then man disposes, of his right
to smoke wherever he
chooses. Credit arbitrariness if
the concertgoer finds that he
can smoke at a rock concert
butt not at a jazz festival. On a
sojourn "Down to the Night
club" the smoker may have to
throw his BUTT OUT if others
so desire.
Politics is more a matter of
names and faces, not numbers.
In the final formation, the Band
portrays a too well known face,
reminding us all that the rocky
road of politics may quickly
upset a once-"Respectable"
office-holder's applecart. Dick
knows.

the second team, but watch as
these Hun knees, elbows, and
fists are used for contract work
on opposition quarterbacks,
running backs, and receivers.
This scene will be completed in
the course of today's game, so
keep your binoculars trained
on your favorite USC animals
as they gouge, kick, and bite
their way to Hollywood star
dom and the Trojan honor roll.

In the final scene, the SiCk
band recreates their own
memorable performance in
and on a short subject at
peace-loving Berkeley last sea
son. See the Trojan helmet
"borrowed." See the Goon
Squad politely ask for the re
turn of the haberdashery as
they subtly aye-for-an-eyely
break the bones of the thief.

Listen to the heart-rending
apology, while the sounds of
violence fill the air.
In the second half of our
movie matinee, the Stanford
Band takes the field for a more
cerebral selection, a historical
mellowdrama portraying the
famous Greece versus Troy tilt
of centuries past.
First, however, this being a
low-budget production, the
Band offers for auction an old
double-bladed relic from the
back lot of the University City
studios. Donations in any
form, animal, vegetable, her
bal, or silver, will be accepted.
In the original plan, the first
scene was to feature a cast of
thousands depicting the Sack
of Troy. Economic reality and a
fear of the effect of violence on
children have altered the final
version of this scene. As the
LSJUMB portrays the sacking of
that ancient city, the audience
is invited to become Greek,

singing to the Trojan adver
saries "You're No Good."
The siege of Troy required
much back-and-forth volleying
as the attack was mounted to
break through the protective
walls. As the rams battered
against the Trojan defenses,
the frustrated wallbangers
found that "It Don't Come
Easy."
The ingenious Greeks cried
out "There Ain't Nothing
Stopping Us Now" as they
slipped into the Trojan whorse,
bringing the struggle to an ex
citing climax.
Lighting a victory cigarette,
the LSJUMB takes its Oddacy
back to the homeland. Re
joyceing, yes, at the figtrees in
the Alameda gardens yes and
all the queer little streets yes I
said yes I will Yes. play the Na
tional Anthem.
One certain thing in football
is halftime.
In life and time, the only cer

tain things are death and poli
tics. Having tenderly treated
the former category last week,
the Band, advised by one of its
consorts, Polly Sigh, takes up
the latter to climb aboard the
bandwagon leading to Election
Day next Tuesday.
As students of life as well as
the University, the LSJUMB
worries about the fate of its
members if PROP SIX should
pass. Can we learn any better if
the PROF's SEX is changed?
Teachers forced to visit the
parts exchange at the Stanford
Hospital will be asked "Who
Are You" by their classes when
they return, and sexual confu
sion will reign.
That problem is not the
Guv's, as he seeks re-election.
Jerry has found security with
his not-too-common-law
friend Linda. As this terribly
romantic relationship con
tinues, with Jerry entering in
and out or Linda's lite, tne Band
wonders if perhaps loss of cre
dibility and the election may
end this fascinating supply of
gossip column fodder, and J.B.
finding himself a "Three Time
Loser."
Another number in the news
is Five. If the people proposes,
then man disposes, of his right
to smoke wherever he
chooses. Credit arbitrariness if
the concertgoer finds that he
can smoke at a rock concert
butt not at a jazz festival. On a
sojourn "Down to the Night
club" the smoker may have to
throw his BUTT OUT if others
so desire.
Politics is more a matter of
names and faces, not numbers.
In the final formation, the Band
portrays a too well known face,
reminding us all that the rocky
road of politics may quickly
upset a once-"Respectable"
office-holder's applecart. Dick

Greetings alumni, alumnae
and alothers. For those of you
who may see no other football
game at Stanford this year, this
is your chance to see if Cardi
nals, Trojans, or LSJUMB's ever
change. Caveat videoditor!
Before the game begins, the
audience is asked to powder its
noses and gargle suitably
strong medicine in preparation
for the lights and sounds of
Hollywood cinema.

As the last available beams of
sunlight over Lost Angeles drift
out to the ocean, movie pro
ducers are forced to move the
sites of outdoor filming to sun
nier climes. Hence the Bay
Area's growing importance in
the film world. After its a-word
winning performances in "Two
Minute Warning" and Dr. De
mented's dream fantasies, the
LSJUMB has attracted movie
companies to film both pre
game performances.
First, the University of
Southern Conshohocken pre
sents scenes from its autobiog
raphical documentary "Animal
Team." (Parental guidance
needed.) In the first scene we
see pseudo-student/athletes
Pluto and VJ-Day weaving
home from an evening's ablu
tions on the Strip. The USC
band depicts our dynamic

duo's Deathomatic crossing
the median strip and crashing
into another car containing a
family of three, and then the
fun begins!

VJ eloquently curses at the
father in five yet-unknown lan
guages as Pluto playfully wraps
a tire iron around the head of
the eleven-year old daughter.
As the blood begins to flow,
our wacky sickos frolic in the
best Peckinpaughian tradition.

In the next scene Pluto and
VJ have been placed on
"double-secret demotion" to
the second team, but watch as
these Hun knees, elbows, and
fists are used for contract work
on opposition quarterbacks,
running backs, and receivers.

Greetings alumni, alumnae
and alothers. For those of you
who may see no other football
game at Stanford this year, this
is your chance to see if Cardi
nals, Trojans, or LSJUMB's ever
change. Caveat videoditor!
Before the game begins, the
audience is asked to powder its
noses and gargle suitably
strong medicine in preparation
for the lights and sounds of
Hollywood cinema.

As the last available beams of
sunlight over Lost Angeles drift
out to the ocean, movie pro
ducers are forced to move the
sites of outdoor filming to sun
nier climes. Hence the Bay
Area's growing importance in
the film world. After its a-word
winning performances in "Two
Minute Warning" and Dr. De
mented's dream fantasies, the
LSJUMB has attracted movie
companies to film both pre
game performances.
First, the University of
Southern Conshohocken pre
sents scenes from its autobiog
raphical documentary "Animal
Team." (Parental guidance
needed.) In the first scene we
see pseudo-student/athletes
Pluto and VJ-Day weaving
home from an evening's ablu
tions on the Strip. The USC
band depicts our dynamic

duo's Deathomatic crossing
the median strip and crashing
into another car containing a
family of three, and then the
fun begins!

VJ eloquently curses at the
father in five yet-unknown lan
guages as Pluto playfully wraps
a tire iron around the head of
the eleven-year old daughter.
As the blood begins to flow,
our wacky sickos frolic in the
best Peckinpaughian tradition.

In the next scene Pluto and
VJ have been placed on
"double-secret demotion" to
the second team, but watch as
these Hun knees, elbows, and
fists are used for contract work
on opposition quarterbacks,
running backs, and receivers.
This scene will be completed in
the course of today's game, so
keep your binoculars trained
on your favorite USC animals
as they gouge, kick, and bite
their way to Hollywood star
dom and the Trojan honor roll.

In the final scene, the SiCk
band recreates their own
memorable performance in
and on a short subject at
peace-loving Berkeley last sea
son. See the Trojan helmet
"borrowed." See the Goon
Squad politely ask for the re
turn of the haberdashery as
they subtly aye-for-an-eyely
break the bones of the thief.

Listen to the heart-rending
apology, while the sounds of
violence fill the air.
In the second half of our
movie matinee, the Stanford
Band takes the field for a more
cerebral selection, a historical
mellowdrama portraying the
famous Greece versus Troy tilt
of centuries past.
First, however, this being a
low-budget production, the
Band offers for auction an old
double-bladed relic from the
back lot of the University City
studios. Donations in any
form, animal, vegetable, her
bal, or silver, will be accepted.
In the original plan, the first
scene was to feature a cast of
thousands depicting the Sack
of Troy. Economic reality and a
fear of the effect of violence on
children have altered the final
version of this scene. As the
LSJUMB portrays the sacking of
that ancient city, the audience
is invited to become Greek,

singing to the Trojan adver
saries "You're No Good."
The siege of Troy required
much back-and-forth volleying

break through the protective
walls. As the rams battered
against the Trojan defenses,
the frustrated wallbangers
