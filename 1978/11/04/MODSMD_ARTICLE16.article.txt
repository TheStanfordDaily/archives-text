## Players form teams of two

Married college students
often find themselves in limbo.
While still saddled with
academic obligations, a whole
new set of responsibilities face
them as well.
If college football and full
time occupations are also mak
ing demands on time, married
life begins to pose some spe
cial problems.
Among Stanford's footbal
lers, Gene Engle and Andy
Sickmeier met and married
their wives under different cir
cumstances, but are confront
ing some of the same difficul
ties. Both Terri and Nancy work
full-time, both are unfamiliar
with this area, yet neither
would be eager to change their
arrangements.
The Engles' premier en
counter could be the pilot for a
touching, yet humorous serial:
football player pulls groin
muscle, receives ultra-sound
treatment from attractive
young woman who he later
falls in love with and marries.
As Terri readily admits, "I re
ally did meet Gene in the train
ing room because of his in
jury." Terri graduated from

UCLA in June of 1977 with a
degree in kinesiology,
specializing in physical
therapy. She became disil
lusioned with the idea of work
ing in a hospital and began in
vestigating other fields in
therapy.
"I arranged through a friend
to come up to Stanford and talk
to Sherry Kovak, the first
female to be licensed as an ath
letic trainer in the nation,"
Terri explained. Kovak offered
her hours toward an eventual
license in athletic training, so
Terri came to Stanford in the
fall of 1977. In August of 1978
she married Gene.
After honeymooning in
Hawaii for a week, Terri had to
immediately adjust to being
married to a football player.
The night they returned, Gene
was due back at Stanford for
pre-season ball. Now that the
football season has started, the
separation begins on Friday
evening and lasts until Satur
day afternoon. "I really start to
miss him by Saturday night,"
Terri said.
One advantage to being
married to a football player,
Terri said, is that it brings both

sides of the family closer
"Gene's from a large family
and every weekend they come
up for the game. My parents
come also, so we all eat break
fast together at Ricky's Satur
day morning. Gene can usually
sit with us for an hour before
the bus leaves, so we've all got
ten to know each other bet
ter."
Future plans hinge on
whether Gene gets drafted into
the pros. "I really can't start my
graduate work until I know
where we're going to be, so
we're just waiting to find out
until May," said Terri.
In Nancy and Andy
Sickmeier's initial meeting, the
topic of conservation might
have ranged from pet frogs to
spelling tests. They met for the
first time in fourth grade,
started dating in ninth grade,
and have been together ever
since. "We decided to get mar
ried because we felt we were
ready. We wanted to be to
gether," said Nancy.
Nancy came up to Stanford
last April from southern
California and got a job work
ing as a dental assistant. "My
job is very rewarding. The pa

tients and people I work with
make it enjoyable." It does
however put togetherness at a
premium.
"Andy goes to class and then
practice, so I don't see him
until 6 or 6:45 p.m. when he
gets back," she said. "It's a lit
tle bit more difficult for us right
now because Andy isn't play
ing a whole lot. He's happier
when he's traveling."
As for socializing, Nancy
hasn't been able to meet a lot
of girls her age, so the couple
relies primarily on Andy's

football friends for compan
ionship. "I really enjoy the
area, and in the future we
might decide to stay here in
Palo Alto. I'm kind of leaning
toward the beach area of
southern California though."
Naturally, both young
couples are finding the early
stages of marriage as challeng
ing as would any newlyweds.
While football might be mak
ing life a bit more difficult, it is
certainly responsible for pro
viding a unique and exciting
opportunity as well.

southern California though."
Naturally, both young
couples are finding the early
stages of marriage as challeng
ing as would any newlyweds.
While football might be mak
ing life a bit more difficult, it is
certainly responsible for pro
viding a unique and exciting
opportunity as well.

Two Cardinals share their room and their meals, when they aren't
eating at the training table, with two special women. Linebacker
Andy Sickmeier (54) and Offensive Tackle Gene Engle (70) are two of
the married players on Stanford's team.

Married college students
often find themselves in limbo.
While still saddled with
academic obligations, a whole
new set of responsibilities face
them as well.
If college football and full
time occupations are also mak
ing demands on time, married
life begins to pose some spe
cial problems.
Among Stanford's footbal
lers, Gene Engle and Andy
Sickmeier met and married
their wives under different cir
cumstances, but are confront
ing some of the same difficul
ties. Both Terri and Nancy work
full-time, both are unfamiliar
with this area, yet neither
would be eager to change their
arrangements.
The Engles' premier en
counter could be the pilot for a
touching, yet humorous serial:
football player pulls groin
muscle, receives ultra-sound
treatment from attractive
young woman who he later
falls in love with and marries.
As Terri readily admits, "I re
ally did meet Gene in the train
ing room because of his in
jury." Terri graduated from

UCLA in June of 1977 with a
degree in kinesiology,
specializing in physical
therapy. She became disil
lusioned with the idea of work
ing in a hospital and began in
vestigating other fields in
therapy.
"I arranged through a friend
to come up to Stanford and talk
to Sherry Kovak, the first
female to be licensed as an ath
letic trainer in the nation,"
Terri explained. Kovak offered
her hours toward an eventual
license in athletic training, so
Terri came to Stanford in the
fall of 1977. In August of 1978
she married Gene.
After honeymooning in
Hawaii for a week, Terri had to
immediately adjust to being
married to a football player.
The night they returned, Gene
was due back at Stanford for
pre-season ball. Now that the
football season has started, the
separation begins on Friday
evening and lasts until Satur
day afternoon. "I really start to
miss him by Saturday night,"
Terri said.
One advantage to being
married to a football player,
Terri said, is that it brings both

sides of the family closer
"Gene's from a large family
and every weekend they come
up for the game. My parents
come also, so we all eat break
fast together at Ricky's Satur
day morning. Gene can usually
sit with us for an hour before
the bus leaves, so we've all got
ten to know each other bet
ter."
Future plans hinge on
whether Gene gets drafted into
the pros. "I really can't start my
graduate work until I know
where we're going to be, so
we're just waiting to find out
until May," said Terri.
In Nancy and Andy
Sickmeier's initial meeting, the
topic of conservation might
have ranged from pet frogs to
spelling tests. They met for the
first time in fourth grade,
started dating in ninth grade,
and have been together ever
since. "We decided to get mar
ried because we felt we were
ready. We wanted to be to
gether," said Nancy.
Nancy came up to Stanford
last April from southern
California and got a job work
ing as a dental assistant. "My
job is very rewarding. The pa

tients and people I work with
make it enjoyable." It does
however put togetherness at a
premium.
"Andy goes to class and then
practice, so I don't see him
until 6 or 6:45 p.m. when he
gets back," she said. "It's a lit
tle bit more difficult for us right
now because Andy isn't play
ing a whole lot. He's happier
when he's traveling."
As for socializing, Nancy
hasn't been able to meet a lot
of girls her age, so the couple
relies primarily on Andy's

football friends for compan
ionship. "I really enjoy the
area, and in the future we
might decide to stay here in
Palo Alto. I'm kind of leaning
toward the beach area of
southern California though."
