# Cards ready to wilt USC roses
## Top arm Dils vs. tough defense USC's White aims for record 
### IVAN MAISEL 
This is what Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh calls a typical
Southern California football
team.
"They have a lot of talent,
depth, confidence and they are
well-coached."
That is a typical USC team.
Now, listen to California Head
Coach Roger Theder, who
watched his Golden Bear team
be humiliated by USC last
week, 42-17:
"They were as good of an SC
team as I have seen in six or
seven years."
The University of Southern
California Trojans invade the
friendly confines of Stanford
Stadium to play the Stanford
Cardinals today in a game that
is the turning point of the sea
son for both teams.
USC, 6-1 this season, is cur
rently sixth-ranked. The Tro
jans' lone defeat was at the
hands of Arizona State.
In past years, that loss would
not have had as much mean
ing, but in past years, Arizona
State was not a member of the
Pac-10 Conference.
The 20-7 loss at the hands of
the Sun Devils touched a nerve
in the Trojan football team.
Since that conference loss,
they have humiliated two
straight conference oppo
nents, running roughshod
over Oregon State, 38-7, and
humiliating California, 48-17,
last week.
Still, the Trojans have one
conference loss, and another
one today would mean no pil
grimmage to that Mecca of the

college football religion, the
Rose Bowl. USC Head Coach
John Robinson grimly realizes
this and pointed it out as a
great motivation for his team.
"We have great motivation,
too, and it's called survival.
We're trying to survive in the
conference race and if we
lose Saturday, we're out,"
Robinson said.
As for the hometown Cards,
a win today could be the differ
ence between a good season
and a great one. Stanford is 5-3
on the season year, and 2-2 in
the conference. Defeating
USC could salve the wounds
that losses to UCLA and
Washington inflicted, keep
Stanford's slim Rose Bowl
hopes alive and, more realisti
cally, put the Cards in the run
ning for another bowl, such as
the Fiesta or the Sun.
The Cardinal offense, led by
the nation's most prolific of
fensive threat, Steve Dils,
ranks third in the nation in total
offense, averaging 454 yards
per game.
Sophomore running back
Darrin Nelson is second in the
country in all-purpose rushing
with 173.3 yards, averaging two
yards less per game than USC
tailback Charles Whit^.
Robinson said he sees no dif
ference at all between the two
stars.
"They are two of the best in
running backs in the nation,"
Robinson said. "Charlie is big
ger and more physical, where
Nelson has exceptional ba
lance and is quicker."
A vital .cog of Stanford's run

ning game and Nelson's
success might be missing
from the Stanford offensive
machine.
Fullback Phil Francis
sprained his ankle last week in
the first quarter against Ore
gon State, and at press time,
his playing status was un
known.
"Losing Francis early in the
game (against Oregon State)
hurt us more than we realized.
It was painfully evidentthat our

offense was impaired with
Francis not in the game,"
Walsh said.
"If you have all week to pre
pare without someone, you
can make adjustments," Walsh
said. "But to lose Francis dur
ing the game, we had trouble
adjusting."
As for Stanford's passing
game, it's the Trojans who will
have to do the adjusting.
"I don't know that anybody
can stop Dils," Robinson said.

The senior quarterback leads
the nation's top passing of
fense. Stanford is throwing for
282.6 yards a game.
Robinson doesn't cry too
loudly, though.
"We played Michigan State
this season, and Rogers had
quite a good arm. Being from
the Pac-10 you become aware
of how to play a passing of
fense.
"Our secondary is good. We

Beaver quarterback with a calling card at last week's game. Today, the Cardinals face the coming of the
Trojan horse.
