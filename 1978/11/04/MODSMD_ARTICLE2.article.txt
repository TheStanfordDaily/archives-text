# Cards ready to wilt USC roses
## Top arm Dils vs. tough defense USC's White aims for record 
### IVAN MAISEL 
This is what Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh calls a typical
Southern California football
team.
"They have a lot of talent,
depth, confidence and they are
well-coached."
That is a typical USC team.
Now, listen to California Head
Coach Roger Theder, who
watched his Golden Bear team
be humiliated by USC last
week, 42-17:
"They were as good of an SC
team as I have seen in six or
seven years."
The University of Southern
California Trojans invade the
friendly confines of Stanford
Stadium to play the Stanford
Cardinals today in a game that
is the turning point of the sea
son for both teams.
USC, 6-1 this season, is cur
rently sixth-ranked. The Tro
jans' lone defeat was at the
hands of Arizona State.
In past years, that loss would
not have had as much mean
ing, but in past years, Arizona
State was not a member of the
Pac-10 Conference.
The 20-7 loss at the hands of
the Sun Devils touched a nerve
in the Trojan football team.
Since that conference loss,
they have humiliated two
straight conference oppo
nents, running roughshod
over Oregon State, 38-7, and
humiliating California, 48-17,
last week.
Still, the Trojans have one
conference loss, and another
one today would mean no pil
grimmage to that Mecca of the

college football religion, the
Rose Bowl. USC Head Coach
John Robinson grimly realizes
this and pointed it out as a
great motivation for his team.
"We have great motivation,
too, and it's called survival.
We're trying to survive in the
conference race and if we
lose Saturday, we're out,"
Robinson said.
As for the hometown Cards,
a win today could be the differ
ence between a good season
and a great one. Stanford is 5-3
on the season year, and 2-2 in
the conference. Defeating
USC could salve the wounds
that losses to UCLA and
Washington inflicted, keep
Stanford's slim Rose Bowl
hopes alive and, more realisti
cally, put the Cards in the run
ning for another bowl, such as
the Fiesta or the Sun.
The Cardinal offense, led by
the nation's most prolific of
fensive threat, Steve Dils,
ranks third in the nation in total
offense, averaging 454 yards
per game.
Sophomore running back
Darrin Nelson is second in the
country in all-purpose rushing
with 173.3 yards, averaging two
yards less per game than USC
tailback Charles Whit^.
Robinson said he sees no dif
ference at all between the two
stars.
"They are two of the best in
running backs in the nation,"
Robinson said. "Charlie is big
ger and more physical, where
Nelson has exceptional ba
lance and is quicker."
A vital .cog of Stanford's run

ning game and Nelson's
success might be missing
from the Stanford offensive
machine.
Fullback Phil Francis
sprained his ankle last week in
the first quarter against Ore
gon State, and at press time,
his playing status was un
known.
"Losing Francis early in the
game (against Oregon State)
hurt us more than we realized.
It was painfully evidentthat our

offense was impaired with
Francis not in the game,"
Walsh said.
"If you have all week to pre
pare without someone, you
can make adjustments," Walsh
said. "But to lose Francis dur
ing the game, we had trouble
adjusting."
As for Stanford's passing
game, it's the Trojans who will
have to do the adjusting.
"I don't know that anybody
can stop Dils," Robinson said.

The senior quarterback leads
the nation's top passing of
fense. Stanford is throwing for
282.6 yards a game.
Robinson doesn't cry too
loudly, though.
"We played Michigan State
this season, and Rogers had
quite a good arm. Being from
the Pac-10 you become aware
of how to play a passing of
fense.
"Our secondary is good. We

Beaver quarterback with a calling card at last week's game. Today, the Cardinals face the coming of the
Trojan horse.
do a good enough job," Robin
son said.
Stanford's defense is a con
sensus choice as the most im
proved in the Pac-10. There is
no better place to prove that
than today at Stanford
Stadium.
"Stanford's defense is
much-improved," Robinson
said. "They have a talented
group of people."
Robinson doesn't discount
the revenge factor.
"They do have an emotional
factor against us," Robinson
said. Robinson singled out the
linebacking corps of Gordy
Ceresino (who, despite a knee
strain received in last week's
game, is expected to play),
Steve Budinger, Tom Hall and
Milt McColl, calling them "tall,
rangy and improving."
Walsh discounts the revenge
motive, "I don't think last
year's game will be having any
effect on us."
Not that Stanford needs
something like that to get them
going. Robinson called this
week's game "the continua
tion of a great rivalry."
Seven-and-a-half point favo
rites, the Trojans are fighting
for their lives as far as the Rose
Bowl is concerned. Quite
strange that such an awesome
team is only one loss away from
elimination.
The tailback is an All-
American, Heisman Trophy
candidate. The quarterback fits
the mold of past USC quarter
backs: quick runner, strong
arm and cagey thinker.
The tailback is Charles
White, a 5-foot-11, 183-pound
junior who ranks fourth in
Pac-10 career rushing.
White has rushed for 3346
yards in just more than 2V2
years, and he's only regularly
started since he was a sopho
more.
What's more, White is only
379 yards away from being the
conference's leading career
rusher, a feat he could con
ceivably reach before the end

of his junior year.
Paul McDonald is the Tro
jans' signal-caller. A 6-foot-2,
180-pound junior, McDonald
holds the distinction of being
the only quarterback in the na
tion who is ranked ahead of
Stanford's Steve Dils.
While the NCAA recognizes
Dils as possessing the coun
try's best arm, the Pac-10 begs
to differ. The Pac-10 uses the
NFL's formula for rating pas
sers, taking into consideration
percentages instead of straight
numbers.
Robinson calls McDonald "a
great passer with a natural fluid
motion." Walsh is equal in
praise of McDonald and the
entire Trojan passing attack.
"They have tremendous
speed at the receivers.
McDonald has a good, strong
arm," Walsh said. "They're not
as polished and skilled, but
Kevin Williams at flanker will
be the fastest man on the
field."
As a member of the nation's
natural championship track
team, Williams finished sixth in
the NCAA 100-meter dash last
year, with a sizzling time of
10.38.
The Trojans did not advance
this far on offensive firepower
alone. They have got a unit that
has doused some pretty large
offensive blazes. The Trojans
are giving up just more than 12
points per game. Besides the
one lapse against Arizona
State, the defense has been un
forgiving.
California scored 17 points
last week, the Bears' two
touchdowns came late in the
game, too, after the Trojans
had built up a 35-3 lead.
The only other team to score
two touchdowns against USC
is third-ranked Alabama, who
was knocked out of the No. 1
ranking by the Trojans, 24-14.
"Their defense is the best
we'll have played," Walsh said.
"Washington was supposed to
have the best, but USC is much
better."

No matter how good the
USC defense is, they haven't
been tested like they will be
today. -
"Stanford has lost three
games this year. The films
show they beat UCLA and
kicked the hell out of
Washington, yet they lost both
because of bad breaks. I con
sider them one of the top 10 or
15 teams in the nation," Robin
son said.
While Walsh is not as free in
handing out praise to USC
(some call it buttering up), he
has a healthy respect for them.
"It's obvious they have an
awesome defense. We can't af
ford to just throw the ball. We
will have to mix-up our game
plan," Walsh said.
For the winner, it's a boost
in the heart of the Pac-10 race
and bowl scene. For the loser,
a pat on the back and another
lost trip to Pasadena is in store.
Both teams have tough roads
ahead. USC plays Washington,
UCLA and Notre Dame before
closing out against Hawaii.
Stanford travels to Arizona
State next week and then plays
the Big Game at Berkeley.
There is only one safe bet
about the outcome of this
game. It will not be 49-0.
This is what Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh calls a typical
Southern California football
team.
"They have a lot of talent,
depth, confidence and they are
well-coached."
That is a typical USC team.

game, too, after the Trojans
had built up a 35-3 lead.
The only other team to score
two touchdowns against USC
is third-ranked Alabama, who
was knocked out of the No. 1
ranking by the Trojans, 24-14.
"Their defense is the best
we'll have played," Walsh said.
"Washington was supposed to
have the best, but USC is much
better."

No matter how good the
USC defense is, they haven't
been tested like they will be
today. -
"Stanford has lost three
games this year. The films
show they beat UCLA and
kicked the hell out of
Washington, yet they lost both
because of bad breaks. I con
sider them one of the top 10 or
15 teams in the nation," Robin
son said.
While Walsh is not as free in
handing out praise to USC
(some call it buttering up), he
has a healthy respect for them.
"It's obvious they have an
awesome defense. We can't af
ford to just throw the ball. We
will have to mix-up our game
plan," Walsh said.
For the winner, it's a boost
in the heart of the Pac-10 race
and bowl scene. For the loser,
a pat on the back and another
lost trip to Pasadena is in store.
Both teams have tough roads
ahead. USC plays Washington,
UCLA and Notre Dame before
closing out against Hawaii.
Stanford travels to Arizona

the Big Game at Berkeley.

do a good enough job," Robin
son said.
Stanford's defense is a con
sensus choice as the most im
proved in the Pac-10. There is
no better place to prove that
than today at Stanford
Stadium.
"Stanford's defense is
much-improved," Robinson
said. "They have a talented
group of people."
Robinson doesn't discount
the revenge factor.
"They do have an emotional
factor against us," Robinson
said. Robinson singled out the
linebacking corps of Gordy
Ceresino (who, despite a knee
strain received in last week's
game, is expected to play),
Steve Budinger, Tom Hall and
Milt McColl, calling them "tall,
rangy and improving."
Walsh discounts the revenge
motive, "I don't think last
year's game will be having any
effect on us."
Not that Stanford needs
something like that to get them
going. Robinson called this
week's game "the continua
tion of a great rivalry."
Seven-and-a-half point favo
rites, the Trojans are fighting
for their lives as far as the Rose
Bowl is concerned. Quite
strange that such an awesome
team is only one loss away from
elimination.
The tailback is an All-
American, Heisman Trophy
candidate. The quarterback fits
the mold of past USC quarter
backs: quick runner, strong
arm and cagey thinker.
The tailback is Charles
White, a 5-foot-11, 183-pound
junior who ranks fourth in
Pac-10 career rushing.
White has rushed for 3346
yards in just more than 2V2
years, and he's only regularly
started since he was a sopho
more.
What's more, White is only
379 yards away from being the
conference's leading career
rusher, a feat he could con
ceivably reach before the end

of his junior year.
Paul McDonald is the Tro
jans' signal-caller. A 6-foot-2,
180-pound junior, McDonald
holds the distinction of being
the only quarterback in the na
tion who is ranked ahead of
Stanford's Steve Dils.
While the NCAA recognizes
Dils as possessing the coun
try's best arm, the Pac-10 begs
to differ. The Pac-10 uses the
NFL's formula for rating pas
sers, taking into consideration
percentages instead of straight
numbers.
Robinson calls McDonald "a
great passer with a natural fluid
motion." Walsh is equal in
praise of McDonald and the
entire Trojan passing attack.
"They have tremendous
speed at the receivers.
McDonald has a good, strong
arm," Walsh said. "They're not
as polished and skilled, but
Kevin Williams at flanker will
be the fastest man on the
field."
As a member of the nation's
natural championship track
team, Williams finished sixth in
the NCAA 100-meter dash last
year, with a sizzling time of
10.38.
The Trojans did not advance
this far on offensive firepower
alone. They have got a unit that
has doused some pretty large
offensive blazes. The Trojans
are giving up just more than 12
points per game. Besides the
one lapse against Arizona
State, the defense has been un
forgiving.
California scored 17 points
last week, the Bears' two
touchdowns came late in the
game, too, after the Trojans
had built up a 35-3 lead.
The only other team to score
two touchdowns against USC
is third-ranked Alabama, who
was knocked out of the No. 1

game. It will not be 49-0.
This is what Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh calls a typical
Southern California football
team.
"They have a lot of talent,
depth, confidence and they are
well-coached."
That is a typical USC team.
Now, listen to California Head
Coach Roger Theder, who
watched his Golden Bear team
be humiliated by USC last
week, 42-17:
"They were as good of an SC
team as I have seen in six or
seven years."
The University of Southern
California Trojans invade the
friendly confines of Stanford
Stadium to play the Stanford
Cardinals today in a game that
is the turning point of the sea
son for both teams.
USC, 6-1 this season, is cur
rently sixth-ranked. The Tro
jans' lone defeat was at the
hands of Arizona State.
In past years, that loss would
not have had as much mean
ing, but in past years, Arizona
State was not a member of the
Pac-10 Conference.
The 20-7 loss at the hands of
the Sun Devils touched a nerve
in the Trojan football team.
Since that conference loss,
they have humiliated two
straight conference oppo
nents, running roughshod
over Oregon State, 38-7, and
humiliating California, 48-17,
last week.
Still, the Trojans have one
conference loss, and another
one today would mean no pil
grimmage to that Mecca of the

college football religion, the
Rose Bowl. USC Head Coach
John Robinson grimly realizes
this and pointed it out as a
great motivation for his team.
"We have great motivation,
too, and it's called survival.
We're trying to survive in the
conference race and if we
lose Saturday, we're out,"
Robinson said.
As for the hometown Cards,
a win today could be the differ
ence between a good season
and a great one. Stanford is 5-3
on the season year, and 2-2 in
the conference. Defeating
USC could salve the wounds
that losses to UCLA and
Washington inflicted, keep
Stanford's slim Rose Bowl
hopes alive and, more realisti
cally, put the Cards in the run
ning for another bowl, such as
the Fiesta or the Sun.
The Cardinal offense, led by
the nation's most prolific of
fensive threat, Steve Dils,
ranks third in the nation in total
offense, averaging 454 yards
per game.
Sophomore running back
Darrin Nelson is second in the
country in all-purpose rushing
with 173.3 yards, averaging two
yards less per game than USC
tailback Charles Whit^.
Robinson said he sees no dif
ference at all between the two
stars.
"They are two of the best in
running backs in the nation,"
Robinson said. "Charlie is big
ger and more physical, where
Nelson has exceptional ba
lance and is quicker."
A vital .cog of Stanford's run

ning game and Nelson's
success might be missing
from the Stanford offensive
machine.
Fullback Phil Francis
sprained his ankle last week in
the first quarter against Ore
gon State, and at press time,
his playing status was un
known.
"Losing Francis early in the
game (against Oregon State)
hurt us more than we realized.
It was painfully evidentthat our

offense was impaired with
Francis not in the game,"
Walsh said.
"If you have all week to pre
pare without someone, you
can make adjustments," Walsh
said. "But to lose Francis dur
ing the game, we had trouble
adjusting."
As for Stanford's passing
game, it's the Trojans who will
have to do the adjusting.
"I don't know that anybody
can stop Dils," Robinson said.

The senior quarterback leads
the nation's top passing of
fense. Stanford is throwing for
282.6 yards a game.
Robinson doesn't cry too
loudly, though.
"We played Michigan State
this season, and Rogers had
quite a good arm. Being from
the Pac-10 you become aware
of how to play a passing of
fense.
"Our secondary is good. We

The tailback is an All-
American, Heisman Trophy
candidate. The quarterback fits
the mold of past USC quarter
backs: quick runner, strong
arm and cagey thinker.
The tailback is Charles
White, a 5-foot-11, 183-pound
junior who ranks fourth in
Pac-10 career rushing.
White has rushed for 3346
yards in just more than 2V2
years, and he's only regularly
started since he was a sopho
more.
What's more, White is only
379 yards away from being the
conference's leading career
rusher, a feat he could con
ceivably reach before the end

of his junior year.
Paul McDonald is the Tro
jans' signal-caller. A 6-foot-2,
180-pound junior, McDonald
holds the distinction of being
the only quarterback in the na
tion who is ranked ahead of
Stanford's Steve Dils.
While the NCAA recognizes
Dils as possessing the coun
try's best arm, the Pac-10 begs
to differ. The Pac-10 uses the
NFL's formula for rating pas
sers, taking into consideration
percentages instead of straight
numbers.
Robinson calls McDonald "a
great passer with a natural fluid
motion." Walsh is equal in
praise of McDonald and the
entire Trojan passing attack.
"They have tremendous
speed at the receivers.
McDonald has a good, strong
arm," Walsh said. "They're not
as polished and skilled, but
Kevin Williams at flanker will
be the fastest man on the
field."
As a member of the nation's
natural championship track
team, Williams finished sixth in
the NCAA 100-meter dash last
year, with a sizzling time of
10.38.
The Trojans did not advance
this far on offensive firepower
alone. They have got a unit that
has doused some pretty large
offensive blazes. The Trojans
are giving up just more than 12
points per game. Besides the
one lapse against Arizona
State, the defense has been un
forgiving.
California scored 17 points
last week, the Bears' two
touchdowns came late in the
game, too, after the Trojans
had built up a 35-3 lead.
The only other team to score
two touchdowns against USC
is third-ranked Alabama, who
was knocked out of the No. 1
ranking by the Trojans, 24-14.
"Their defense is the best
we'll have played," Walsh said.
"Washington was supposed to
have the best, but USC is much
better."

No matter how good the
USC defense is, they haven't
been tested like they will be
today. -
"Stanford has lost three
games this year. The films
show they beat UCLA and
kicked the hell out of
Washington, yet they lost both
because of bad breaks. I con
sider them one of the top 10 or
15 teams in the nation," Robin
son said.
While Walsh is not as free in
handing out praise to USC
(some call it buttering up), he
has a healthy respect for them.
"It's obvious they have an
awesome defense. We can't af
ford to just throw the ball. We
will have to mix-up our game
plan," Walsh said.
For the winner, it's a boost
in the heart of the Pac-10 race
and bowl scene. For the loser,
a pat on the back and another
lost trip to Pasadena is in store.
Both teams have tough roads
ahead. USC plays Washington,
UCLA and Notre Dame before
closing out against Hawaii.
Stanford travels to Arizona
State next week and then plays
the Big Game at Berkeley.
There is only one safe bet
about the outcome of this
game. It will not be 49-0.
This is what Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh calls a typical
Southern California football
team.
"They have a lot of talent,
depth, confidence and they are
well-coached."
That is a typical USC team.
Now, listen to California Head
Coach Roger Theder, who
watched his Golden Bear team
be humiliated by USC last
week, 42-17:
"They were as good of an SC
team as I have seen in six or
seven years."
The University of Southern
California Trojans invade the
friendly confines of Stanford
Stadium to play the Stanford
Cardinals today in a game that
is the turning point of the sea
son for both teams.
USC, 6-1 this season, is cur
rently sixth-ranked. The Tro
jans' lone defeat was at the
hands of Arizona State.
In past years, that loss would
not have had as much mean
ing, but in past years, Arizona
State was not a member of the
Pac-10 Conference.
The 20-7 loss at the hands of
the Sun Devils touched a nerve
in the Trojan football team.
Since that conference loss,
they have humiliated two
straight conference oppo
nents, running roughshod
over Oregon State, 38-7, and
humiliating California, 48-17,
last week.
Still, the Trojans have one
conference loss, and another
one today would mean no pil
grimmage to that Mecca of the

college football religion, the
Rose Bowl. USC Head Coach
John Robinson grimly realizes
this and pointed it out as a
great motivation for his team.
"We have great motivation,
too, and it's called survival.
We're trying to survive in the
conference race and if we
lose Saturday, we're out,"
Robinson said.
As for the hometown Cards,
a win today could be the differ
ence between a good season
and a great one. Stanford is 5-3
on the season year, and 2-2 in
the conference. Defeating
USC could salve the wounds
that losses to UCLA and
Washington inflicted, keep
Stanford's slim Rose Bowl
hopes alive and, more realisti
cally, put the Cards in the run
ning for another bowl, such as
the Fiesta or the Sun.
The Cardinal offense, led by
the nation's most prolific of
fensive threat, Steve Dils,
ranks third in the nation in total
offense, averaging 454 yards
per game.
Sophomore running back
Darrin Nelson is second in the
country in all-purpose rushing
with 173.3 yards, averaging two
yards less per game than USC
tailback Charles Whit^.
Robinson said he sees no dif
ference at all between the two
stars.
"They are two of the best in
running backs in the nation,"
Robinson said. "Charlie is big
ger and more physical, where
Nelson has exceptional ba
lance and is quicker."
A vital .cog of Stanford's run

ning game and Nelson's
success might be missing
from the Stanford offensive
machine.
Fullback Phil Francis
sprained his ankle last week in
the first quarter against Ore
gon State, and at press time,
his playing status was un
known.
"Losing Francis early in the
game (against Oregon State)
hurt us more than we realized.
It was painfully evidentthat our

offense was impaired with
Francis not in the game,"
Walsh said.
"If you have all week to pre
pare without someone, you
can make adjustments," Walsh
said. "But to lose Francis dur
ing the game, we had trouble
adjusting."
As for Stanford's passing
game, it's the Trojans who will
have to do the adjusting.
"I don't know that anybody
can stop Dils," Robinson said.

The senior quarterback leads
the nation's top passing of
fense. Stanford is throwing for
282.6 yards a game.
Robinson doesn't cry too
loudly, though.
"We played Michigan State
this season, and Rogers had
quite a good arm. Being from
the Pac-10 you become aware
of how to play a passing of
fense.
"Our secondary is good. We

Trojan horse.
do a good enough job," Robin
son said.
Stanford's defense is a con
sensus choice as the most im
proved in the Pac-10. There is
no better place to prove that
than today at Stanford
Stadium.
"Stanford's defense is
much-improved," Robinson
said. "They have a talented
group of people."
Robinson doesn't discount
the revenge factor.
"They do have an emotional
factor against us," Robinson
said. Robinson singled out the
linebacking corps of Gordy
Ceresino (who, despite a knee
strain received in last week's
game, is expected to play),
Steve Budinger, Tom Hall and
Milt McColl, calling them "tall,
rangy and improving."
Walsh discounts the revenge
motive, "I don't think last
year's game will be having any
effect on us."
Not that Stanford needs
something like that to get them
going. Robinson called this
week's game "the continua
tion of a great rivalry."
Seven-and-a-half point favo
rites, the Trojans are fighting
for their lives as far as the Rose
Bowl is concerned. Quite
strange that such an awesome
team is only one loss away from
elimination.

because of bad breaks. I con
sider them one of the top 10 or
15 teams in the nation," Robin
son said.
While Walsh is not as free in
handing out praise to USC
(some call it buttering up), he
has a healthy respect for them.
"It's obvious they have an
awesome defense. We can't af
ford to just throw the ball. We
will have to mix-up our game
plan," Walsh said.
For the winner, it's a boost
in the heart of the Pac-10 race
and bowl scene. For the loser,
a pat on the back and another
lost trip to Pasadena is in store.
Both teams have tough roads
ahead. USC plays Washington,
UCLA and Notre Dame before
closing out against Hawaii.
Stanford travels to Arizona
State next week and then plays
the Big Game at Berkeley.
There is only one safe bet
about the outcome of this
game. It will not be 49-0.
This is what Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh calls a typical
Southern California football
team.
"They have a lot of talent,
depth, confidence and they are
well-coached."
That is a typical USC team.
Now, listen to California Head
Coach Roger Theder, who
watched his Golden Bear team
be humiliated by USC last
week, 42-17:
"They were as good of an SC
team as I have seen in six or
seven years."
The University of Southern
California Trojans invade the
friendly confines of Stanford
Stadium to play the Stanford
Cardinals today in a game that
is the turning point of the sea
son for both teams.
USC, 6-1 this season, is cur
rently sixth-ranked. The Tro
jans' lone defeat was at the
hands of Arizona State.
In past years, that loss would
not have had as much mean
ing, but in past years, Arizona
State was not a member of the
Pac-10 Conference.
The 20-7 loss at the hands of
the Sun Devils touched a nerve
in the Trojan football team.
Since that conference loss,
they have humiliated two
straight conference oppo
nents, running roughshod
over Oregon State, 38-7, and
humiliating California, 48-17,
last week.
Still, the Trojans have one
conference loss, and another
one today would mean no pil
grimmage to that Mecca of the

college football religion, the
Rose Bowl. USC Head Coach
John Robinson grimly realizes
this and pointed it out as a
great motivation for his team.
"We have great motivation,
too, and it's called survival.
We're trying to survive in the
conference race and if we
lose Saturday, we're out,"
Robinson said.
As for the hometown Cards,
a win today could be the differ
ence between a good season
and a great one. Stanford is 5-3
on the season year, and 2-2 in
the conference. Defeating
USC could salve the wounds
that losses to UCLA and
Washington inflicted, keep
Stanford's slim Rose Bowl
hopes alive and, more realisti
cally, put the Cards in the run
ning for another bowl, such as
the Fiesta or the Sun.
The Cardinal offense, led by
the nation's most prolific of
fensive threat, Steve Dils,
ranks third in the nation in total
offense, averaging 454 yards
per game.
Sophomore running back
Darrin Nelson is second in the
country in all-purpose rushing
with 173.3 yards, averaging two
yards less per game than USC
tailback Charles Whit^.
Robinson said he sees no dif
ference at all between the two
stars.
"They are two of the best in
running backs in the nation,"
Robinson said. "Charlie is big
ger and more physical, where
Nelson has exceptional ba
lance and is quicker."
A vital .cog of Stanford's run

ning game and Nelson's
success might be missing
from the Stanford offensive
machine.
Fullback Phil Francis
sprained his ankle last week in
the first quarter against Ore
gon State, and at press time,
his playing status was un
known.
"Losing Francis early in the
game (against Oregon State)
hurt us more than we realized.
It was painfully evidentthat our

offense was impaired with
Francis not in the game,"
Walsh said.
"If you have all week to pre
pare without someone, you
can make adjustments," Walsh
said. "But to lose Francis dur
ing the game, we had trouble
adjusting."
As for Stanford's passing
game, it's the Trojans who will
have to do the adjusting.
"I don't know that anybody
can stop Dils," Robinson said.

The senior quarterback leads
the nation's top passing of
fense. Stanford is throwing for
282.6 yards a game.
Robinson doesn't cry too
loudly, though.
"We played Michigan State
this season, and Rogers had
quite a good arm. Being from
the Pac-10 you become aware
of how to play a passing of
fense.
"Our secondary is good. We

Trojan horse.
do a good enough job," Robin
son said.
Stanford's defense is a con
sensus choice as the most im
proved in the Pac-10. There is
no better place to prove that
than today at Stanford
Stadium.
"Stanford's defense is
much-improved," Robinson
said. "They have a talented
group of people."
Robinson doesn't discount
the revenge factor.
"They do have an emotional
factor against us," Robinson
said. Robinson singled out the
linebacking corps of Gordy
Ceresino (who, despite a knee
strain received in last week's
game, is expected to play),
Steve Budinger, Tom Hall and
Milt McColl, calling them "tall,
rangy and improving."
Walsh discounts the revenge
motive, "I don't think last
year's game will be having any
effect on us."
Not that Stanford needs
something like that to get them
going. Robinson called this
week's game "the continua
tion of a great rivalry."
Seven-and-a-half point favo
rites, the Trojans are fighting
for their lives as far as the Rose
Bowl is concerned. Quite
strange that such an awesome
team is only one loss away from
elimination.
The tailback is an All-
American, Heisman Trophy
candidate. The quarterback fits
the mold of past USC quarter
backs: quick runner, strong
arm and cagey thinker.
The tailback is Charles
White, a 5-foot-11, 183-pound
junior who ranks fourth in
Pac-10 career rushing.
White has rushed for 3346
yards in just more than 2V2
years, and he's only regularly
started since he was a sopho
more.
What's more, White is only
379 yards away from being the
conference's leading career
rusher, a feat he could con
ceivably reach before the end

of his junior year.
Paul McDonald is the Tro
jans' signal-caller. A 6-foot-2,
180-pound junior, McDonald
holds the distinction of being
the only quarterback in the na
tion who is ranked ahead of
Stanford's Steve Dils.
While the NCAA recognizes
Dils as possessing the coun
try's best arm, the Pac-10 begs
to differ. The Pac-10 uses the
NFL's formula for rating pas
sers, taking into consideration
percentages instead of straight
numbers.
Robinson calls McDonald "a
great passer with a natural fluid
motion." Walsh is equal in
praise of McDonald and the
entire Trojan passing attack.
"They have tremendous
speed at the receivers.
McDonald has a good, strong
arm," Walsh said. "They're not
as polished and skilled, but
Kevin Williams at flanker will
be the fastest man on the
field."
As a member of the nation's
natural championship track
team, Williams finished sixth in
the NCAA 100-meter dash last
year, with a sizzling time of
10.38.
The Trojans did not advance
this far on offensive firepower
alone. They have got a unit that
has doused some pretty large
offensive blazes. The Trojans
are giving up just more than 12
points per game. Besides the
one lapse against Arizona
State, the defense has been un
forgiving.
California scored 17 points
last week, the Bears' two
touchdowns came late in the
game, too, after the Trojans
had built up a 35-3 lead.
The only other team to score
two touchdowns against USC
is third-ranked Alabama, who
was knocked out of the No. 1
ranking by the Trojans, 24-14.
"Their defense is the best
we'll have played," Walsh said.
"Washington was supposed to
have the best, but USC is much
better."

No matter how good the
USC defense is, they haven't
been tested like they will be
today. -
"Stanford has lost three
games this year. The films
show they beat UCLA and
kicked the hell out of
Washington, yet they lost both
because of bad breaks. I con
sider them one of the top 10 or
15 teams in the nation," Robin
