## Griffin would solve mascot mess 
### Ivan Maisel 
The Griffin, according to scho
lars of Greek mythology, has
"the body of a lion, the wings
and talons of an eagle, and ears
in a forward position. It is a sym
bol of courage, enlightenment,
eternal vigilance, magnamity,
perseverance, swiftness, valor
and wisdom."

The Stanford Daily ran an editorial on Wednesday of this week
urging that a decision, any decision, be made concerning the fact
that Stanford University does not have a viable mascot. While the
editorial board of the Daily decided not to play favorites, I will not be
as shy in declaring my preference: the Griffin.
First of all, take a look at why we should not adopt theGjriffin. The
loudest argument is put forth by the alumni who favor a return to the
hallowed mascot of years past, the Indian.
The Indian was removed because of the insult it inferred upon the
native American community. The argument that the Indian was
considered in a heroic sense, and therefore inoffensive, simply does
not hold water. One set of people designating another as their
"mascot," or lucky symbol, is as insulting of a proposition as I have
ever heard.
The alumni claim that the Indian is a tradition, and as such, should
be maintained. Traditions, however, are practical only as long as
everyone in the receiving generation accepts them and honors them
as did the previous generation. That is obviously not the case with
the Indian.
Let the Indian go the way all artifacts go: let him fade out grace
fully. The diehards who won't let go are living in the past, not willing
to face reality. President Richard Lyman has decreed that any mascot
must be backed by a consensus of the community. Since this is not
possible, for the Indian, we must look to alternatives. Some that
have been suggested are the Tree, the Robber Baron and the Griffin.
The Tree is unique, and cute, but it is also innocuous. Has anyone
ever seen a fierce redwood? Does someone know of a fighting oak
tree that could spur our athletes on to victory? Has anyone any

knowledge of a proud scotch pine that could send us to Berkeley
with fire in our eyes?
The Tree belongs to the LSJUMB, if anyone; let them keep it.
As for the Robber Baron, it is funny and makes a somewhat telling
judgment of our beloved founder. However, other schools haven't a
mascot named after their founders. The Brigham Young Mormons?
The Brandeis Judges? The Duke Tobacco Barons?
Now, look at the Griffin. It is a proud figure of Greek mythology,
with a lion's body, and an eagle's head and wings. What could be
more menacing?
Of course, there are other creatures, mythological and real, that
might compare with the Griffin. None of them, however, have
caught on as the Griffin has.
"It is the thing that has stuck," Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said. "There have been lots of ideas in the past four or five
years, but the Griffin is the only one that has stayed and rounded up
support."
That support seems to come together when given a chance. In last
week's edition of this football issue, we ran a picture of the Griffin on
the cover. All week long we have received calls from old and new
admirers of the Griffin. In addition, the football team sent a rep
resentative to ask if we would run the cover again this week. In the
interest of journalism, we regretfully declined.
Lyons has openly been in favor of the Griffin for some time. He is
impressed with the amount of student support it has maintained,
despite the fact that no public relations group has been openly

campaigning for it.
One department that has not been campaigning for or against the
Griffin is the Athletic Department. They have maintained a rather
deafening silence about the whole affair. One can speculate that
they receive the most flack about the issue from the Indian suppor
ters, and thus remain discreetly quiet.
The group in favor of it that most impresses Lyons is the athletes
themselves.

"A mascot doesn't represent the University as a whole. It's a
symbol to be used by the athletic teams. As a group, they have been
full and enthusiastic in their support."
A petition signed by 225 student athletes was presented to Lyman
last spring. They are the ones who have set the present drive in
motion.
Dean Wilson, a starter on the defensive line, is one of those who
signed the petition.
"Stanford is a unique university, and we deserve a unique mascot.
No other major college uses the Griffin," Wilson said. "The tradi
tional color of the Griffin is red, so it fits in the University's tradi
tion."
The two statues of the Griffin which currently grace the grounds of
the Children's Hospital are a link to Stanford's tradition, too. The
Hospital is on the grounds that used to be Stanford's private home.
We need a mascot. It has been six years since we have had one.
The Cardinal has been a barely adequate interim, but there is no
better time than the present to make a choice. And as Wilson
pointed out, "We need to push for it (the Griffin) soon. If it hangs
around too long, people might get tired of hearing about it."
Lyman's official view is that a consensus must be had behind any
mascot. He has kept his personal feelings to himself, but another
member of the Lyman household has chucked her inhibitions. Mrs.
Lyman donned a Griffin T-shirt for last week's game against Oregon
State.
The timing of this pitch for the Griffin is more than coincidental.
There is a method in this madness.
According to Dean Lyons, "Griffins have long been known to
devour horses. That point must not be lost this weekend."
Hold on to your saddle, Tommy Trojan. The Griffins are riding fast
on your rear.

We need a mascot. It has been six years since we have had one.
The Cardinal has been a barely adequate interim, but there is no
better time than the present to make a choice. And as Wilson
pointed out, "We need to push for it (the Griffin) soon. If it hangs
around too long, people might get tired of hearing about it."
Lyman's official view is that a consensus must be had behind any
mascot. He has kept his personal feelings to himself, but another
member of the Lyman household has chucked her inhibitions. Mrs.
Lyman donned a Griffin T-shirt for last week's game against Oregon
State.
The timing of this pitch for the Griffin is more than coincidental.
There is a method in this madness.
According to Dean Lyons, "Griffins have long been known to
devour horses. That point must not be lost this weekend."
Hold on to your saddle, Tommy Trojan. The Griffins are riding fast
on your rear.
The Griffin, according to scho
lars of Greek mythology, has
"the body of a lion, the wings
and talons of an eagle, and ears
in a forward position. It is a sym
bol of courage, enlightenment,
eternal vigilance, magnamity,
perseverance, swiftness, valor
and wisdom."

The Stanford Daily ran an editorial on Wednesday of this week
urging that a decision, any decision, be made concerning the fact
that Stanford University does not have a viable mascot. While the
editorial board of the Daily decided not to play favorites, I will not be
as shy in declaring my preference: the Griffin.
First of all, take a look at why we should not adopt theGjriffin. The
loudest argument is put forth by the alumni who favor a return to the
hallowed mascot of years past, the Indian.
The Indian was removed because of the insult it inferred upon the
native American community. The argument that the Indian was
considered in a heroic sense, and therefore inoffensive, simply does
not hold water. One set of people designating another as their
"mascot," or lucky symbol, is as insulting of a proposition as I have
ever heard.
The alumni claim that the Indian is a tradition, and as such, should
be maintained. Traditions, however, are practical only as long as
everyone in the receiving generation accepts them and honors them
as did the previous generation. That is obviously not the case with
the Indian.
Let the Indian go the way all artifacts go: let him fade out grace
fully. The diehards who won't let go are living in the past, not willing
to face reality. President Richard Lyman has decreed that any mascot
must be backed by a consensus of the community. Since this is not
possible, for the Indian, we must look to alternatives. Some that
have been suggested are the Tree, the Robber Baron and the Griffin.
The Tree is unique, and cute, but it is also innocuous. Has anyone
ever seen a fierce redwood? Does someone know of a fighting oak
tree that could spur our athletes on to victory? Has anyone any

knowledge of a proud scotch pine that could send us to Berkeley
with fire in our eyes?
The Tree belongs to the LSJUMB, if anyone; let them keep it.
As for the Robber Baron, it is funny and makes a somewhat telling
judgment of our beloved founder. However, other schools haven't a
mascot named after their founders. The Brigham Young Mormons?
The Brandeis Judges? The Duke Tobacco Barons?
Now, look at the Griffin. It is a proud figure of Greek mythology,
with a lion's body, and an eagle's head and wings. What could be
more menacing?
Of course, there are other creatures, mythological and real, that
might compare with the Griffin. None of them, however, have
caught on as the Griffin has.
"It is the thing that has stuck," Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said. "There have been lots of ideas in the past four or five
years, but the Griffin is the only one that has stayed and rounded up
support."
That support seems to come together when given a chance. In last
week's edition of this football issue, we ran a picture of the Griffin on
the cover. All week long we have received calls from old and new
admirers of the Griffin. In addition, the football team sent a rep
resentative to ask if we would run the cover again this week. In the
interest of journalism, we regretfully declined.
Lyons has openly been in favor of the Griffin for some time. He is
impressed with the amount of student support it has maintained,
despite the fact that no public relations group has been openly

campaigning for it.
One department that has not been campaigning for or against the
Griffin is the Athletic Department. They have maintained a rather
deafening silence about the whole affair. One can speculate that
they receive the most flack about the issue from the Indian suppor
ters, and thus remain discreetly quiet.
The group in favor of it that most impresses Lyons is the athletes
themselves.

"A mascot doesn't represent the University as a whole. It's a
symbol to be used by the athletic teams. As a group, they have been
full and enthusiastic in their support."
A petition signed by 225 student athletes was presented to Lyman
last spring. They are the ones who have set the present drive in
motion.
Dean Wilson, a starter on the defensive line, is one of those who
signed the petition.
"Stanford is a unique university, and we deserve a unique mascot.
No other major college uses the Griffin," Wilson said. "The tradi
tional color of the Griffin is red, so it fits in the University's tradi
tion."
The two statues of the Griffin which currently grace the grounds of
the Children's Hospital are a link to Stanford's tradition, too. The
Hospital is on the grounds that used to be Stanford's private home.

ters, and thus remain discreetly quiet.
The group in favor of it that most impresses Lyons is the athletes
themselves.

"A mascot doesn't represent the University as a whole. It's a
symbol to be used by the athletic teams. As a group, they have been
full and enthusiastic in their support."
A petition signed by 225 student athletes was presented to Lyman
last spring. They are the ones who have set the present drive in
motion.
Dean Wilson, a starter on the defensive line, is one of those who
signed the petition.
"Stanford is a unique university, and we deserve a unique mascot.
No other major college uses the Griffin," Wilson said. "The tradi
tional color of the Griffin is red, so it fits in the University's tradi
tion."
The two statues of the Griffin which currently grace the grounds of
the Children's Hospital are a link to Stanford's tradition, too. The
Hospital is on the grounds that used to be Stanford's private home.
We need a mascot. It has been six years since we have had one.
The Cardinal has been a barely adequate interim, but there is no
better time than the present to make a choice. And as Wilson
pointed out, "We need to push for it (the Griffin) soon. If it hangs
around too long, people might get tired of hearing about it."
Lyman's official view is that a consensus must be had behind any
mascot. He has kept his personal feelings to himself, but another
member of the Lyman household has chucked her inhibitions. Mrs.
Lyman donned a Griffin T-shirt for last week's game against Oregon
State.
The timing of this pitch for the Griffin is more than coincidental.
There is a method in this madness.
According to Dean Lyons, "Griffins have long been known to
devour horses. That point must not be lost this weekend."
Hold on to your saddle, Tommy Trojan. The Griffins are riding fast
on your rear.
The Griffin, according to scho
lars of Greek mythology, has
"the body of a lion, the wings
and talons of an eagle, and ears
in a forward position. It is a sym
bol of courage, enlightenment,
eternal vigilance, magnamity,
perseverance, swiftness, valor
and wisdom."

The Stanford Daily ran an editorial on Wednesday of this week
urging that a decision, any decision, be made concerning the fact
that Stanford University does not have a viable mascot. While the
editorial board of the Daily decided not to play favorites, I will not be
as shy in declaring my preference: the Griffin.
First of all, take a look at why we should not adopt theGjriffin. The
loudest argument is put forth by the alumni who favor a return to the
hallowed mascot of years past, the Indian.
The Indian was removed because of the insult it inferred upon the
native American community. The argument that the Indian was
considered in a heroic sense, and therefore inoffensive, simply does
not hold water. One set of people designating another as their
"mascot," or lucky symbol, is as insulting of a proposition as I have
ever heard.
The alumni claim that the Indian is a tradition, and as such, should
be maintained. Traditions, however, are practical only as long as
everyone in the receiving generation accepts them and honors them
as did the previous generation. That is obviously not the case with
the Indian.
Let the Indian go the way all artifacts go: let him fade out grace
fully. The diehards who won't let go are living in the past, not willing
to face reality. President Richard Lyman has decreed that any mascot
must be backed by a consensus of the community. Since this is not
possible, for the Indian, we must look to alternatives. Some that
have been suggested are the Tree, the Robber Baron and the Griffin.
The Tree is unique, and cute, but it is also innocuous. Has anyone
ever seen a fierce redwood? Does someone know of a fighting oak
tree that could spur our athletes on to victory? Has anyone any

knowledge of a proud scotch pine that could send us to Berkeley
with fire in our eyes?
The Tree belongs to the LSJUMB, if anyone; let them keep it.
As for the Robber Baron, it is funny and makes a somewhat telling
judgment of our beloved founder. However, other schools haven't a
mascot named after their founders. The Brigham Young Mormons?
The Brandeis Judges? The Duke Tobacco Barons?
Now, look at the Griffin. It is a proud figure of Greek mythology,
with a lion's body, and an eagle's head and wings. What could be
more menacing?
Of course, there are other creatures, mythological and real, that
might compare with the Griffin. None of them, however, have
caught on as the Griffin has.
"It is the thing that has stuck," Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said. "There have been lots of ideas in the past four or five
years, but the Griffin is the only one that has stayed and rounded up
support."
That support seems to come together when given a chance. In last
week's edition of this football issue, we ran a picture of the Griffin on
the cover. All week long we have received calls from old and new
admirers of the Griffin. In addition, the football team sent a rep
resentative to ask if we would run the cover again this week. In the
interest of journalism, we regretfully declined.
Lyons has openly been in favor of the Griffin for some time. He is
impressed with the amount of student support it has maintained,
despite the fact that no public relations group has been openly

campaigning for it.
One department that has not been campaigning for or against the
Griffin is the Athletic Department. They have maintained a rather
deafening silence about the whole affair. One can speculate that
they receive the most flack about the issue from the Indian suppor
ters, and thus remain discreetly quiet.
The group in favor of it that most impresses Lyons is the athletes
themselves.
