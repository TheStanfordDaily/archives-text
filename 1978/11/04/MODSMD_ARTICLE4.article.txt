# 'Junior' Nelson stands tall as Card threat
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Be it lakeside keggers or Old
Union sit-ins, spring is the time
for collegiate frivolity. Each
spring, touched by May mad
ness, Theta Delta Chi has a
"pledge-active war." Last
spring the pledges kidnapped
the house president, dressed
him in ridiculous garb and sent
him to Reno.
In retaliation, the actives de
cided to kidnap three pledges,
dress them in similarly gawdy
clothing and drive them to
Berkeley.
Pledge Darrin Nelson
thought he was safely locked in
his room, out of harm's path
when the actives unhinged his
door and proceeded to dress
him in an outfit that would em
barrass Bozo the clown: yellow
blouse, pink bloomers, striped
knee socks and pink slippers.
The actives drove him across
the Bay, then tied him to a tele
phone pole in front of the Cal
football frat. The big boys from
Beta Theta Pi sauntered down
to take a closer look at the
source of the commotion. To
their surprise it was Darrin Nel
son.
Looking at the grinning
5-foot-9 freshman they must
have been hard pressed to be
lieve he was the same Darrin
Nelson who had eluded their
grasps during their 21-3 Big
Game loss to the Cardinals last
November.
Like the Golden Bears,
nearly all of the teams Stanford
faced last season would have
liked a second look, .a second
shot, at the 170-pound running
dynamo.
At a school where passing is
religion, Nelson is an anomaly.
When the freshman dervish
from Pius X High School in Los
Angeles appeared in the Car
dinal backfield last September,
it took most Stanford fans sev
eral games to adjust to the fact
that Nelson was carrying the
ball for the Cardinals, not
against them.
Great running backs play for

the men across the line today,
not for the Cards.
But while Nelson is dwarfed
in size by most of his team
mates, his contributions to
Stanford last year and this have
been gargantuan.
"You look back now and
wonder where we might have
been without Darrin," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said after
finishing his first year at the
reins of the Cards as Pac-8
Coach of the Year. Nelson was
one of the first coups in
Walsh's effort to recruit more
blacks from urban areas. It is a
recruiting strategy that yielded
big dividends immediately.
In his 18th game at Stanford,
two weeks ago against
Washington State in Pullman,
Wash., Nelson became Stan
ford's career rushing leader.
He now has rushed for 1846
yards on 303 carries and a 6.1
yard average.
With jackrabbit starts, gyros
copic balance and Harry
Houdini escapes, Nelson is not
only one of collegiate foot
ball's most dangerous runners,
he is one of the most enjoyable
to watch.
"I'm just a quickness run
ner," Nelson said. "I don't run
over people." Nelson said
good peripheral vision and
speed are needed for success
with his style of running.
What about his unimitable
moves? "Moves and spins are
something that are hard to
work on," he said. "Unless
they are automatic, when it
comes time to use them, if you
have to stop and think about
them, by the time you do it will
be too late."
Nelson said he has been
playing football since he was
eight and added that his run
ning style has always been
pretty much the same as it is
now. "You develop certain
things as the caliber of play
gets better," he said. "But you
can never sit around learning
how to do it. It must be instinc
tive."

Nelson has not only proven
that running need not be a
heretical act on the Farm, he
has had a positive impact on
the vaunted Stanford passing
attack. His slashing dashes up
the middle and quick bursts to
the outside keep defenses
honest and take pressure off
Stanford QB Steve Dils. More
importantly, although he
caught but five passes his
senioryear in high school, Nel
son has now become one of
the West Coast's leading re
ceivers.
The elfin speedster set an
NCAA freshman record with 50
receptions last year while be
coming the first player in the
108-year history of the NCAA to
snag 50 passes and rush for
more than 1,000 yards in the
same season. This year he has
already grabbed 41 passes.
"He can take a short flat pass
and turn it into a touchdown or
a 20 or 30 yard gain," Dils said.
"For instance, he almost
scored on that screen pass
against Oregon State last
week."
In his first game in a Cardinal
uniform, Nelson turned a Guy
Benjamin screen pass into a
56-yard touchdown. Against
Oregon last autumn a screen
pass went for 65 yards. And
with Stanford clinging to a
17-14 edge over LSU with 2V2
minutes remaining in the Sun
Bowl, Benjamin flipped a safety
valve pass to Nelson in the left
flat. He dodged one tackier
while tightrope-walking the
sideline, then burst free with a
36-yard touchdown. Bayou
Bengal mentor Charlie
McClendon said that Nelson's
TD was the kayo punch.
Despite his huge talents
which also include sprinting
and long jumping for the Card
track team one cannot help
but feel that there is a certain
inequity when 250-pound
Godzillas seek after the flesh,
precious little of it that there is,

When fullback Phil Francis
first saw Nelson, he thought

Nelson has not only proven
that running need not be a
heretical act on the Farm, he
has had a positive impact on
the vaunted Stanford passing
attack. His slashing dashes up
the middle and quick bursts to
the outside keep defenses
honest and take pressure off
Stanford QB Steve Dils. More
importantly, although he
caught but five passes his
senioryear in high school, Nel
son has now become one of
the West Coast's leading re
ceivers.
The elfin speedster set an
NCAA freshman record with 50
receptions last year while be
coming the first player in the
108-year history of the NCAA to
snag 50 passes and rush for
more than 1,000 yards in the
same season. This year he has
already grabbed 41 passes.
"He can take a short flat pass
and turn it into a touchdown or
a 20 or 30 yard gain," Dils said.
"For instance, he almost
scored on that screen pass
against Oregon State last
week."
In his first game in a Cardinal
uniform, Nelson turned a Guy
Benjamin screen pass into a
56-yard touchdown. Against
Oregon last autumn a screen
pass went for 65 yards. And
with Stanford clinging to a
17-14 edge over LSU with 2V2
minutes remaining in the Sun
Bowl, Benjamin flipped a safety
valve pass to Nelson in the left
flat. He dodged one tackier
while tightrope-walking the
sideline, then burst free with a
36-yard touchdown. Bayou

Nelson was the coach's son

his Cheshire cat grin, "they just
wanted to meet all the big

his room, out of harm's path
when the actives unhinged his
door and proceeded to dress

knee socks and pink slippers.
The actives drove him across
the Bay, then tied him to a tele
phone pole in front of the Cal
football frat. The big boys from
Beta Theta Pi sauntered down
to take a closer look at the
source of the commotion. To
their surprise it was Darrin Nel

nearly all of the teams Stanford
faced last season would have
liked a second look, .a second

dynamo.
At a school where passing is
religion, Nelson is an anomaly.
When the freshman dervish
from Pius X High School in Los
Angeles appeared in the Car
dinal backfield last September,
it took most Stanford fans sev
eral games to adjust to the fact
that Nelson was carrying the
ball for the Cardinals, not
against them.
Great running backs play for

the men across the line today,
not for the Cards.
But while Nelson is dwarfed
in size by most of his team
mates, his contributions to
Stanford last year and this have
been gargantuan.
"You look back now and
wonder where we might have
been without Darrin," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said after
finishing his first year at the
reins of the Cards as Pac-8
Coach of the Year. Nelson was
one of the first coups in
Walsh's effort to recruit more
blacks from urban areas. It is a
recruiting strategy that yielded
big dividends immediately.
In his 18th game at Stanford,
two weeks ago against
Washington State in Pullman,
Wash., Nelson became Stan
ford's career rushing leader.
He now has rushed for 1846
yards on 303 carries and a 6.1
yard average.
With jackrabbit starts, gyros
copic balance and Harry
Houdini escapes, Nelson is not
only one of collegiate foot
ball's most dangerous runners,
he is one of the most enjoyable
to watch.
"I'm just a quickness run
ner," Nelson said. "I don't run
over people." Nelson said
good peripheral vision and
speed are needed for success
with his style of running.
What about his unimitable
moves? "Moves and spins are
something that are hard to
work on," he said. "Unless
they are automatic, when it
comes time to use them, if you
have to stop and think about
them, by the time you do it will
be too late."
Nelson said he has been
playing football since he was
eight and added that his run
ning style has always been
pretty much the same as it is
now. "You develop certain
things as the caliber of play
gets better," he said. "But you
can never sit around learning

thought he was safely locked in
his room, out of harm's path
when the actives unhinged his
door and proceeded to dress
him in an outfit that would em
barrass Bozo the clown: yellow
blouse, pink bloomers, striped
knee socks and pink slippers.
The actives drove him across
the Bay, then tied him to a tele
phone pole in front of the Cal
football frat. The big boys from
Beta Theta Pi sauntered down
to take a closer look at the
source of the commotion. To
their surprise it was Darrin Nel
son.
Looking at the grinning
5-foot-9 freshman they must
have been hard pressed to be
lieve he was the same Darrin
Nelson who had eluded their
grasps during their 21-3 Big
Game loss to the Cardinals last
November.
Like the Golden Bears,
nearly all of the teams Stanford
faced last season would have
liked a second look, .a second
shot, at the 170-pound running
dynamo.
At a school where passing is
religion, Nelson is an anomaly.
When the freshman dervish
from Pius X High School in Los
Angeles appeared in the Car
dinal backfield last September,
it took most Stanford fans sev
eral games to adjust to the fact
that Nelson was carrying the
ball for the Cardinals, not
against them.
Great running backs play for

the men across the line today,
not for the Cards.
But while Nelson is dwarfed
in size by most of his team
mates, his contributions to
Stanford last year and this have
been gargantuan.
"You look back now and
wonder where we might have
been without Darrin," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said after
finishing his first year at the
reins of the Cards as Pac-8
Coach of the Year. Nelson was
one of the first coups in
Walsh's effort to recruit more
blacks from urban areas. It is a
recruiting strategy that yielded
big dividends immediately.
In his 18th game at Stanford,
two weeks ago against
Washington State in Pullman,
Wash., Nelson became Stan
ford's career rushing leader.
He now has rushed for 1846
yards on 303 carries and a 6.1
yard average.
With jackrabbit starts, gyros
copic balance and Harry
Houdini escapes, Nelson is not
only one of collegiate foot
ball's most dangerous runners,
he is one of the most enjoyable
to watch.
"I'm just a quickness run
ner," Nelson said. "I don't run
over people." Nelson said
good peripheral vision and
speed are needed for success
with his style of running.
What about his unimitable
moves? "Moves and spins are
something that are hard to
work on," he said. "Unless
they are automatic, when it
comes time to use them, if you
have to stop and think about
them, by the time you do it will
be too late."
Nelson said he has been
playing football since he was
eight and added that his run
ning style has always been
pretty much the same as it is
now. "You develop certain
things as the caliber of play
gets better," he said. "But you
can never sit around learning
how to do it. It must be instinc
tive."

Nelson has not only proven
that running need not be a
heretical act on the Farm, he
has had a positive impact on
the vaunted Stanford passing
attack. His slashing dashes up
the middle and quick bursts to
the outside keep defenses
honest and take pressure off
Stanford QB Steve Dils. More
importantly, although he
caught but five passes his
senioryear in high school, Nel
son has now become one of
the West Coast's leading re
ceivers.
The elfin speedster set an
NCAA freshman record with 50
receptions last year while be
coming the first player in the
108-year history of the NCAA to
snag 50 passes and rush for
more than 1,000 yards in the
same season. This year he has
already grabbed 41 passes.
"He can take a short flat pass
and turn it into a touchdown or
a 20 or 30 yard gain," Dils said.
"For instance, he almost
scored on that screen pass
against Oregon State last
week."
In his first game in a Cardinal
uniform, Nelson turned a Guy
Benjamin screen pass into a
56-yard touchdown. Against
Oregon last autumn a screen
pass went for 65 yards. And
with Stanford clinging to a
17-14 edge over LSU with 2V2
minutes remaining in the Sun
Bowl, Benjamin flipped a safety
valve pass to Nelson in the left
flat. He dodged one tackier
while tightrope-walking the
sideline, then burst free with a
36-yard touchdown. Bayou
Bengal mentor Charlie
McClendon said that Nelson's
TD was the kayo punch.
Despite his huge talents
which also include sprinting
and long jumping for the Card

but feel that there is a certain

When fullback Phil Francis
first saw Nelson, he thought
Darrin was the son of assistant

time on Nelson has been

Francis carried the joke into
a restaurant one evening last
fall when the team went out to
eat. He told the waitress that
Nelson was the coach's son
