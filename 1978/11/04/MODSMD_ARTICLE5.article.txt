# Humble Trojan White runs boldly to fame
## 
### RICHARD MARTINEZ 
Three years ago Charles
White was perhaps the finest
high school running back in
the country. Now as a junior,
he may wfell be the best rusher
in collegiate football. That's an
awful big statement to make
about one player. Then again,
White has done big things.
While at San Fernando High,
White averaged an amazing 9.5
yards per carry, was Southern
California Prep Athlete of the
Year for 1975-76, shared Los
Angeles City Player of the Year
honors with San Fernando and
USC teammates Kevin Williams
and Kenny Moore, was chosen
first team All-City and Scholas
tic Coach All-American.
The most awesome aspect
about this situaton is that
White is on his way to accruing
more honors at USC than he
did in high school. In just two
years, Charles White has be
come the fourth leading rusher
in USC history, and is on his
way to becoming number one
perhaps this year. The run
ners ahead of him include
Heisman Trophy winner O.J.
Simpson, and two Heisman
runners-up, Ricky Bell and An
thony Davis.
Already gaining 1,010 yards
so far this season, the 5-foot-11
183-pounder needs only 379
yards to pass Davis and be
come the top Trojan ever.

"White should be an Ail-
American," said John Robin
son, head coach of USC. "He's
earned the right now to be

classed in the great tradition of
USC tailbacks. He's a threat to
break a long run every time he
carries the ball."
White has been touched by
greatness ever since he don
ned a Trojan uniform. On his
third USC carry ever, he broke
two tackles and ran six yards
for a touchdown. On his sixth,
he ran 79 yards fo another
touchdown. In 1976 the latest
great USC tailback was named
first team freshman All-
American by the "Football
News." Last year he was named
first team All-West Coast (UPI
and AP) and first team All Pac-8.
While these achievements
would represent a fine career
for most players, White is far
from remaining complacent
with his success. He still notes
areas where he is trying to im
prove.
"I still need a lot of work in
perfecting my blocking
techniques. This is a vital as
pect if you want to be a well
rounded back. I think I'm be
coming a progressively more
intelligent runner. Maturity
and intelligence will distin
guish my last two years from
my first two," White said.
Although he receives so
much publicity and attention,
White fervently disagrees with
those who put too much em
phasis on the importance of
one player to a team's success.
"Sure I feel one player can
break a game open for you, but
a championship caliber club
will rely more on their entire

squad than on one individual,"
White said.
Charles White is one indi
vidual the Cards will have to
hold in check if they are to av
enge last year's 49-0 humilia
tion. The Trojans won't be tak
ing Stanford lightly though.
"They're a different squad
from last year's team and
they've proven in games
with Oklahoma, UCLA, and
Washington that they play
extremely well when in con
tention with a powerful team,"
White said.
Stanford is the first of three
crucial consecutive games that
USC must win in order to main
tain their Rose Bowl bid. Fol
lowing the Cards, USC must
face Washington and UCLA.
The Trojans finish their season
with Notre Dame and Hawaii.
White prefers this tough
scheduling. "Our team will
remain sharper if we're playing
these tough games consecu
tively. That way we could
minimize the possibility of an
off week with a weaker team.
We're a quality team and we'll
finish the season well off," he
said.
The 1978 Trojan squad is also
fairly young. There are many
more sophomore and junior
starters than on last year's
team. Already impressive this
year, next year's team should
prove to be even more volatile
with another year's experi
ence. White is not concerned
with the future, though.

Charles White leads the nation in all-purpose running, and is less than
400 yards away from being the most prolific runner in the history of
the Pac-10. If history is used as a guide, White will be trouble for
Stanford, for he has averaged 131 yards per game against the Cards in
his career.
"I can't look past this Satur
day. When players start to
dream about the future, they
often times blow a game they
were taking for granted."
White said.
Not only does the speech
communications major hold
the proper perspective for a
talented athlete, he also has a
heart. After the Trojans de
feated Alabama earlier this sea
son on national television,
White told the ABC network to
leave him alone so he could
sign autographs for his
younger fans.
"All too often football
players are not thought to be
human," White said. "Some
people don't understand that
there's more to our lives than
running, tackling, and block
ing."
While the Cards are sure
Charles White is a nice guy,
they'd rather get to know him
better outside of their own end
zone.

The 1978 Trojan squad is also
fairly young. There are many
more sophomore and junior
starters than on last year's
team. Already impressive this
year, next year's team should
prove to be even more volatile
with another year's experi
ence. White is not concerned
with the future, though.

Charles White leads the nation in all-purpose running, and is less than
400 yards away from being the most prolific runner in the history of
the Pac-10. If history is used as a guide, White will be trouble for
Stanford, for he has averaged 131 yards per game against the Cards in
his career.
"I can't look past this Satur
day. When players start to
dream about the future, they
often times blow a game they
were taking for granted."
White said.
Not only does the speech
communications major hold
the proper perspective for a
talented athlete, he also has a
heart. After the Trojans de
feated Alabama earlier this sea
son on national television,
White told the ABC network to
leave him alone so he could
sign autographs for his
younger fans.
"All too often football
players are not thought to be
human," White said. "Some
people don't understand that
there's more to our lives than
running, tackling, and block
ing."
While the Cards are sure
Charles White is a nice guy,
they'd rather get to know him
better outside of their own end
zone.
Three years ago Charles
White was perhaps the finest
high school running back in
the country. Now as a junior,
he may wfell be the best rusher
in collegiate football. That's an
awful big statement to make
about one player. Then again,
White has done big things.
While at San Fernando High,
White averaged an amazing 9.5
yards per carry, was Southern
California Prep Athlete of the
Year for 1975-76, shared Los
Angeles City Player of the Year
honors with San Fernando and
USC teammates Kevin Williams
and Kenny Moore, was chosen
first team All-City and Scholas
tic Coach All-American.
The most awesome aspect
about this situaton is that
White is on his way to accruing
more honors at USC than he
did in high school. In just two
years, Charles White has be
come the fourth leading rusher
in USC history, and is on his
way to becoming number one
perhaps this year. The run
ners ahead of him include
Heisman Trophy winner O.J.
Simpson, and two Heisman
runners-up, Ricky Bell and An
thony Davis.
Already gaining 1,010 yards
so far this season, the 5-foot-11
183-pounder needs only 379
yards to pass Davis and be
come the top Trojan ever.

"White should be an Ail-
American," said John Robin
son, head coach of USC. "He's
earned the right now to be

classed in the great tradition of
USC tailbacks. He's a threat to
break a long run every time he
carries the ball."
White has been touched by
greatness ever since he don
ned a Trojan uniform. On his
third USC carry ever, he broke
two tackles and ran six yards
for a touchdown. On his sixth,
he ran 79 yards fo another
touchdown. In 1976 the latest
great USC tailback was named
first team freshman All-
American by the "Football
News." Last year he was named
first team All-West Coast (UPI
and AP) and first team All Pac-8.
While these achievements
would represent a fine career
for most players, White is far
from remaining complacent
with his success. He still notes
areas where he is trying to im
prove.
"I still need a lot of work in
perfecting my blocking
techniques. This is a vital as
pect if you want to be a well
rounded back. I think I'm be
coming a progressively more
intelligent runner. Maturity
and intelligence will distin
guish my last two years from
my first two," White said.
Although he receives so
much publicity and attention,
White fervently disagrees with
those who put too much em
phasis on the importance of
one player to a team's success.
"Sure I feel one player can
break a game open for you, but
a championship caliber club
will rely more on their entire

squad than on one individual,"
White said.
Charles White is one indi
vidual the Cards will have to
hold in check if they are to av
enge last year's 49-0 humilia
tion. The Trojans won't be tak
ing Stanford lightly though.
"They're a different squad
from last year's team and
they've proven in games
with Oklahoma, UCLA, and
Washington that they play
extremely well when in con
tention with a powerful team,"
White said.
Stanford is the first of three
crucial consecutive games that
USC must win in order to main
tain their Rose Bowl bid. Fol
lowing the Cards, USC must
face Washington and UCLA.
The Trojans finish their season
with Notre Dame and Hawaii.
White prefers this tough
scheduling. "Our team will
remain sharper if we're playing
these tough games consecu
tively. That way we could
minimize the possibility of an
off week with a weaker team.
We're a quality team and we'll
finish the season well off," he
said.

and intelligence will distin
guish my last two years from
my first two," White said.
Although he receives so
much publicity and attention,
White fervently disagrees with
those who put too much em
phasis on the importance of
one player to a team's success.
"Sure I feel one player can
break a game open for you, but
a championship caliber club
will rely more on their entire

squad than on one individual,"
White said.
Charles White is one indi
vidual the Cards will have to
hold in check if they are to av
enge last year's 49-0 humilia
tion. The Trojans won't be tak
ing Stanford lightly though.
"They're a different squad
from last year's team and
they've proven in games
with Oklahoma, UCLA, and
Washington that they play
extremely well when in con
tention with a powerful team,"
White said.
Stanford is the first of three
crucial consecutive games that
USC must win in order to main
tain their Rose Bowl bid. Fol
lowing the Cards, USC must
face Washington and UCLA.
The Trojans finish their season
with Notre Dame and Hawaii.
White prefers this tough
scheduling. "Our team will
remain sharper if we're playing
these tough games consecu
tively. That way we could
minimize the possibility of an
off week with a weaker team.
We're a quality team and we'll
finish the season well off," he
said.
The 1978 Trojan squad is also
fairly young. There are many
more sophomore and junior
starters than on last year's
team. Already impressive this
year, next year's team should
prove to be even more volatile
with another year's experi
ence. White is not concerned
with the future, though.

Charles White leads the nation in all-purpose running, and is less than
400 yards away from being the most prolific runner in the history of
the Pac-10. If history is used as a guide, White will be trouble for
Stanford, for he has averaged 131 yards per game against the Cards in
his career.
"I can't look past this Satur
day. When players start to
dream about the future, they
often times blow a game they
were taking for granted."
White said.
Not only does the speech
communications major hold
the proper perspective for a
talented athlete, he also has a
heart. After the Trojans de
feated Alabama earlier this sea
son on national television,
White told the ABC network to
leave him alone so he could
sign autographs for his
younger fans.
"All too often football
players are not thought to be
human," White said. "Some
people don't understand that
there's more to our lives than
running, tackling, and block
ing."
While the Cards are sure
Charles White is a nice guy,
they'd rather get to know him
better outside of their own end
zone.
Three years ago Charles
White was perhaps the finest
high school running back in
the country. Now as a junior,
he may wfell be the best rusher
in collegiate football. That's an
awful big statement to make
about one player. Then again,
White has done big things.
While at San Fernando High,
White averaged an amazing 9.5
yards per carry, was Southern
California Prep Athlete of the
Year for 1975-76, shared Los
Angeles City Player of the Year
honors with San Fernando and
USC teammates Kevin Williams
and Kenny Moore, was chosen
first team All-City and Scholas
tic Coach All-American.
The most awesome aspect
about this situaton is that
White is on his way to accruing
more honors at USC than he
did in high school. In just two
years, Charles White has be
come the fourth leading rusher
in USC history, and is on his
way to becoming number one
perhaps this year. The run
ners ahead of him include
Heisman Trophy winner O.J.
Simpson, and two Heisman
runners-up, Ricky Bell and An
thony Davis.
Already gaining 1,010 yards
so far this season, the 5-foot-11
183-pounder needs only 379
yards to pass Davis and be
come the top Trojan ever.

"White should be an Ail-
American," said John Robin
son, head coach of USC. "He's
earned the right now to be

classed in the great tradition of
USC tailbacks. He's a threat to
break a long run every time he
carries the ball."
White has been touched by
greatness ever since he don
ned a Trojan uniform. On his
third USC carry ever, he broke
two tackles and ran six yards
for a touchdown. On his sixth,
he ran 79 yards fo another
touchdown. In 1976 the latest
great USC tailback was named
first team freshman All-
American by the "Football
News." Last year he was named
first team All-West Coast (UPI
and AP) and first team All Pac-8.
While these achievements
would represent a fine career
for most players, White is far
from remaining complacent
with his success. He still notes
areas where he is trying to im
prove.
"I still need a lot of work in
perfecting my blocking
techniques. This is a vital as
pect if you want to be a well
rounded back. I think I'm be
coming a progressively more
intelligent runner. Maturity
and intelligence will distin
guish my last two years from
my first two," White said.
Although he receives so
much publicity and attention,
White fervently disagrees with
those who put too much em
phasis on the importance of
