# Wilson ranks as defensive Dean
## 
### BRIAN COPPLE 
Stanford's defense this year
utilizes only three down line
men, three men on the scrim
mage line facing at least five
offensive linemen. Obviously,
these three must be good.
Tackle Dean Wilson fills the
bill.
Like most major college
athletes, Wilson excelled in
high school sports, earning
all-San Diego County honors in
football and a city title in
wrestling.
His football career con
tinued for one year at
Grossmont Junior College, and
then stopped abruptly when
he quit the team after playing
half the first game. A twisted
ankle helped dampen his al
ready dwindling enthusiasm
for the game. "I thought it was
kindofa burn going toajunior
college," he said. "I wanted to
be at a fdur year school."
Stanford looked appealing
to Dean because it offered him
a good balance between excel
lence in academics and high
caliber football.
A problem arose: idle junior
college football players are
generally not hot items on the
recruiting lists of major univer
sity athletic programs. So Wil
son decided to recruit himself.
He traveled to the Farm and
pleaded his case to then-Head
Coach Jack Christiansen, who
expressed some interest.
Soon after, Christiansen and
most of his staff were replaced
by Bill Walsh and his crew. Wil
son feared his chances at Stan
ford had faded with Christian

sen's job, but Norb Hecker, a
holdover from the old staff,
likened the new coaching staff
to the idea of recruiting him.
Not long after, he was headed
for Stanford with a football
scholarship.
Wilson's career has been a
bright spot for Stanford foot
ball. Since he became eligible
in 1977, he's been a starter in
every game with the Cardinals,
and last year he was seventh on
the team in tackles with 60. He
already has 42 tackles this year.
What made Dean turn back
to football? What motivates
him to dedicate an average of
five hours a day to a grueling
game?
Competition. "Football of
fers me physical and mental
competition I can't get in any
other sport," he said. "That
competition thrills me."
Of course with the benefits,
football has its drawbacks. Wil
son recognizes the possibility
of injury, of being maimed for
life. "I've seen it happen," he
testified. "One hit and a guy's
knee is gone. Three operations
later he still can't run at top
speed. But the risk of injury is
part of the game. You just don't
think about it."
On the field, there is plenty
to keep Wilson's mind off the
risk of injury. These diversions
usually come in 250-pound
parcels and are called offensive
linemen. His job is to beat
them, and it takes effort, both
mentally and physically.
The problem is com
pounded by Dean's relatively
small size (220 pounds). He

could beef up with a little
weightlifting, but the coaches
have long since given up trying
to drag him to Encina gym to
pump the iron.
"I hate weights," Wilson
said. "They're so boring. I can't
imagine spending two hours a
day three days a week doing
something I don't like."
What Wilson yields in size he
recovers with speed and
brains. For example, at one
point against Oregon State he
kept lining up leaning more
and more to his left, telegraph
ing his movement to the offen
sive lineman. Then one play he
leaned left again, then rushed
to his right, moving around the
fineman and sacking the quar
terback.
"I heard that lineman say 'oh
shit.' It was one of the best 'oh
shits' I've ever heard," Wilson
said.
Wilson has no special pro
cess of preparation for these
Saturday battles. He just goes
through the team's pre-game
routine, which includes spend
ing Friday night at a hotel and
watching cartoons Saturday
morning. He notes that it does
psych him up to run onto the
field with the band playing and
all the students cheering and
going crazy.
Wilson is presently unsure
about his future. He is an
academic senior with a major
in economics. Upon gradua
tion, his goal is to "find a career
I like." He is considering busi
ness school or some manage
ment training program.
In terms of athletic eligibil

ity, Dean is only a junior be
cause of the year he skipped in
junior college. Thus, he refer
red to next year as "my option
year." He might play football
for the Cards and he might not.
Jokingly, Wilson added that
he might be more inclined to
play out the last year of his
eligibility of the coaching staff

would "fatten my contract by
exempting me from spring
practice."
Off the field, Dean Wilson
admits, "I'm really into toys."
His room at the Zeta Psi house
is full of Spider Man items
mugs, punching bags, signs
and the like.

One member of the threesome which comprise Stanford's defensive
line is Tackle Dean Wilson (91). Shown here about to sack Oklahoma's
quarterback, Thomas Lott (6), Wilson will be looking for such an
opportunity today as the Cards meet the Trojans.
