# Tradition of greatness surrounds USC grid
## 
### ROBERT REED 
"We won a lot of games at USC
before we put on our pads" -
former USC assistant coach
Craig Fertig.
USC went into fall practice
this year led by a quarterback
who hadn't yet played a full
game of college football, with
out a proven fullback, and with
only 11 returning starters off a
1977 squad that went only 8-4
on the season. In the UPI pre
season poll, the USC Trojans
were ranked seventh in the na
tion.
If this were any other college
football team, it would have
been lucky to be ranked at all.
But this isn't any other college
football team, this is USC.
When people write about
USC, they tend to use all capi
tal letters (and boldface print, if
they have it). When they speak
of USC, they tend to lower
their voice several octaves.
This is because USC is diffe
rent, something special, and
seemingly on a level above any
other college football team.
There is an aura about them, an
aura that comes from winning.
Year after year, USC marches
onto the football field with the
biggest, strongest, and most
talented players in the country.
And year after year, they march
off the field with one of the
best teams in the nation.
Though the Trojans have not
won a national championship
in several years, they are con
sistently battling for this con
verted title.
The Trojans, in striving for
excellence, have created a
winning tradition that is un
matched in college football.
Southern Cal is the No. 1
bowl team in college football
with an impressive 17-6 re
cord. In post-season bowl
games, USC has the most wins
(17) and the best percentage
(.738) of any team around.
The Trojans have sustained
much of this success while de
veloping one of the most pow
erful offenses in college foot
ball the power I.
In this power I, the Trojans
don't do anything fancy, they
just come right at you with the
biggest and strongest lineman
in the country leading the way
for the country's best blocking
fullback and the country's
most talented tailback.
And over the years, the Tro
jans' glorious tailback has led
the way for USC into the na
tional spotlight.
The Trojan tailback has been
synonymous with greatness.
The list of great Trojan tail
backs seems to go on forever.
It includes such notables as
O.J. Simpson, Ricky Bell, An
thony Davis, Mike Garrett,
Clarence Davis, Frank Gifford,
and of course, Charles White.
Even 'SC tailbacks that don't
start do better than most
schools' running backs. White,
as a freshman playing behind
Ricky Bell, rushed for 744 yards
in 1976.
USC has more players ip the
NFL any other college in
the nation. Last year they had

45 players on the final rosters
of the NFL teams. At the begin
ning of this season, there were
at least 60 Trojans on 25 of the
28 NFL teams. Maybe this is
why some people say playing
SC is like playing the pros.
Many people actually be
lieve playing USC is like play
ing the pros. This is one of the
best things USC has going for
them. People expect them to
be great, so they are. Many
teams have been 'psyched out'
by this aura of excellence. They
have been defeated, by anxiety
and fear, even before the battle
with the mighty Trojans has
begun. This what prompted
Coach Fertig's anecdote at the
start of this article. People are
afraid of SC because of the
winning tradition they have
maintained.
Even following a 'disappoint
ing" 8-4 season and an even
more 'disappointing' No. 13
ranking in the final polls (any
thing short of a 12-0 record and
at least one wire poll ranking of
No. 1 is disappointing for
USC), people expect greatness
from USC.
So far this year, these people
have gotten pretty much what
they expected. The sixth
ranked Trojans are 6-1, includ
ing an impressive win over
previously top-ranked Ala
bama.
What is it, one has to won
der, that started such an awe
some tradition?
"Well, they've always had a
tremendous athletic tradition.
But I think it was their rivalry
with Notre Dame," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz, explaining that USC's
longtime intersectional rivalry
with Notre Dame (which has
one of the great football tradi
tions of all times) helped build
their own tradition.
"Notre Dame's tradition,
with Rockne and everybody
else, I think, wore off on them,
because they've always been
such great competitors,"
speculated Ruetz. "They've
always wanted to be strong

against Notre Dame."
Craig Fertig, who now
coaches the Oregon State
Beavers, doesn't believe the
tradition started quite so far
back.
"I think it started with
McKay," said Fertig of his
former mentor John McKay.
"McKay got the big, strong
players that didn't do anything
fancy, they just beat you up."
The Trojans, though noted
primarily for their bruising of
fense, have led the Pac-8 in de
fense for the past six straight
seasons.
Fertig said also that many
teams were both "scared" of
USC and in "awe" of their
power. Apparently, however,
this is not the way the Trojan
tradition began.
USC's nickname, "Trojans,"
originated in 1912. Up to that
time the USC teams were cal
led the Methodists or Wes
leyans, nicknames which were
not looked upon with favor by
university officials.
So, Los Angeles Times sports
editor Owen Bird was asked by
USC officials to select an ap
propriate nickname.
"At this time, the athletes
and the coaches of the univer
sity were under terrific hand
icaps," recalled Bird. "They
were facing teams that were
bigger and better equipped,
yet they had splendid fighting
spirit. The name' Trojans' fitted
them.
"I came out with an article
prior to a showdown between
USC and Stanford in which I
called attention,to the fighting
spirit of USC athletes and
named them 'Trojans.' From
then on, we used the term 'Tro
jan' all the time, and it stuck."
The fighting spirit still re
mains but the Trojans no
longer play under terrific hand
icaps.
"They play with all the
odds," said Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh, explaining
that USC now comes to battle
better-manned and better
equipped than most other

teams.
"They've always (unless we
call on ancient history) had a
tremendous wealth of talent,"
Walsh said. "They recruit the
best players to play football.
They just say, 'lt's important to
our school to have a good
football team, and we're going
to have one whatever it
takes.' "
Walsh was quick to add that
he does not quarrel with USC's
recruiting methods. Others
have not been quite so quick.
Some charge that USC has
been able to get the best
athletes in the country year
after year only because of their
laxity in admissions' standards.
These people question

whether all of USC's players
are academically eligible, and
they are disturbed that USC's
players are accorded special
educational treatment. But this
usually comes from people
who come up short on the
scoreboard.
"That's just sour grapes,"
said USC Head football Coach
John Robinson, commenting
on that criticism. While not
denying the allegations,
Robinson said, "I don't believe
we've recruited a player in the
last decade that wasn't also re
cruited by UCLA or Cal." It's
just that nobody does it better.
Last year, USC was ranked
No. 1 among the nation's col-

O.J. Simpson (32) and Mike Garrett (30) are two reasons that the USC
football tradition stands proud. Each man won the Heisman Trophy,
annually given to the nation's best collegiate player. Other backs who
continued in these men's great footsteps are Anthony Davis, Ricky
Bell and the current USC star, Charles White.

leges ih high school recruiting,
picking up 24 of the most
talented prep stars in the na
tion, among them 10 high
school Ail-Americans. They re
cruited well the year before. In
fact, one must think, in retros
pect, that they recruited re
markably well, considering the
athletes they passed up.
"I wanna show 'em I can
play. They didn't recruit me,"
said sophomore split end
Kenny Margerum, who pre
pped in Southern California.
"When I was a little kid, I al
ways dreamed of playing for
'SC. I didn't get a chance. I
guess the next best thing is to
beat 'em."
USC did so well in its recruit
ing that year that it passed up
Margerum, who now leads the
Pac-10 in touchdown recep
tions and receiving yardage.
The Trojans also neglected to
heavily recruit Darrin Nelson,
also a Southern California na
tive. They thought they had
better athletes.

Said Robinson, "Thre's a
strong identity with the univer
sity."
That's understandable.
Everybody loves a winner, and
USC has a winning tradition..
The Cardinals' task will be to
try to change that tradition, at
least for a day.
Also instrumental in the con
tinuance of the USC tradition is
the tremendous support they
receive from their alumni and
fans. Ruetz said that USC's
"tradition has been built on a
consistency of alumni sup
port." Ruetz indicated that,
"They raise more money for
scholarships than our Buck
Club."
The alumni and fans of USC
support the Trojans not only
financially, but spiritually.
More than 20,000 USC boos
ters are expected to make the
haul up north for the match
against the Cards.
Also fundamental to the

maintenance of Trojan excel
lence is the University's high
regard for the Trojan spirit of
athletic competition. People at
USC are not USC students,
workers, or staff members.
They are Trojans.
USC has as a mascot a
powerful-looking Trojan horse
named Traveler 111 who serves
as a symbol of strength and en
durance for the Trojans.
A statue of a Trojan warrior,
appropriately named Tommy
Trojan, stands in the center of
the campus and serves as a
symbol of the school's pride
and spirit.
Even their band exists as part
of the Trojan spirit of athletic
competition, unlike Stanford's
band which exists as an entity
in and of itself. Southern Cal's
band is not the USC marching
band, but the Trojan marching
band.
At USC, everything is geared
toward the Trojan spirit and
tradition.

of USC, they tend to lower
their voice several octaves.
This is because USC is diffe
rent, something special, and
seemingly on a level above any
other college football team.
There is an aura about them, an
aura that comes from winning.
Year after year, USC marches
onto the football field with the
biggest, strongest, and most
talented players in the country.
And year after year, they march
off the field with one of the
best teams in the nation.
Though the Trojans have not
won a national championship
in several years, they are con
sistently battling for this con
verted title.
The Trojans, in striving for
excellence, have created a
winning tradition that is un
matched in college football.
Southern Cal is the No. 1
bowl team in college football
with an impressive 17-6 re
cord. In post-season bowl
games, USC has the most wins
(17) and the best percentage
(.738) of any team around.
The Trojans have sustained
much of this success while de
veloping one of the most pow
erful offenses in college foot
ball the power I.
In this power I, the Trojans
don't do anything fancy, they
just come right at you with the
biggest and strongest lineman
in the country leading the way
for the country's best blocking
fullback and the country's
most talented tailback.
And over the years, the Tro
jans' glorious tailback has led
the way for USC into the na
tional spotlight.
The Trojan tailback has been
synonymous with greatness.
The list of great Trojan tail
backs seems to go on forever.
It includes such notables as
O.J. Simpson, Ricky Bell, An
thony Davis, Mike Garrett,
Clarence Davis, Frank Gifford,
and of course, Charles White.
Even 'SC tailbacks that don't
start do better than most
schools' running backs. White,
as a freshman playing behind
Ricky Bell, rushed for 744 yards
in 1976.
USC has more players ip the
NFL any other college in
the nation. Last year they had

45 players on the final rosters
of the NFL teams. At the begin
ning of this season, there were
at least 60 Trojans on 25 of the
28 NFL teams. Maybe this is
why some people say playing
SC is like playing the pros.
Many people actually be
lieve playing USC is like play
ing the pros. This is one of the
best things USC has going for
them. People expect them to
be great, so they are. Many
teams have been 'psyched out'
by this aura of excellence. They
have been defeated, by anxiety
and fear, even before the battle
with the mighty Trojans has
begun. This what prompted
Coach Fertig's anecdote at the
start of this article. People are
afraid of SC because of the
winning tradition they have
maintained.
Even following a 'disappoint
ing" 8-4 season and an even
more 'disappointing' No. 13
ranking in the final polls (any
thing short of a 12-0 record and
at least one wire poll ranking of
No. 1 is disappointing for
USC), people expect greatness
from USC.
So far this year, these people
have gotten pretty much what
they expected. The sixth
ranked Trojans are 6-1, includ
ing an impressive win over
previously top-ranked Ala
bama.
What is it, one has to won
der, that started such an awe
some tradition?
"Well, they've always had a
tremendous athletic tradition.
But I think it was their rivalry
with Notre Dame," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz, explaining that USC's
longtime intersectional rivalry
with Notre Dame (which has
one of the great football tradi
tions of all times) helped build
their own tradition.
"Notre Dame's tradition,
with Rockne and everybody
else, I think, wore off on them,
because they've always been
such great competitors,"
speculated Ruetz. "They've
always wanted to be strong

against Notre Dame."
Craig Fertig, who now
coaches the Oregon State
Beavers, doesn't believe the
tradition started quite so far
back.
"I think it started with
McKay," said Fertig of his
former mentor John McKay.
"McKay got the big, strong
players that didn't do anything
fancy, they just beat you up."
The Trojans, though noted
primarily for their bruising of
fense, have led the Pac-8 in de
fense for the past six straight
seasons.
Fertig said also that many
teams were both "scared" of
USC and in "awe" of their
power. Apparently, however,
this is not the way the Trojan
tradition began.
USC's nickname, "Trojans,"
originated in 1912. Up to that
time the USC teams were cal
led the Methodists or Wes
leyans, nicknames which were
not looked upon with favor by
university officials.
So, Los Angeles Times sports
editor Owen Bird was asked by
USC officials to select an ap
propriate nickname.
"At this time, the athletes
and the coaches of the univer
sity were under terrific hand
icaps," recalled Bird. "They
were facing teams that were
bigger and better equipped,
yet they had splendid fighting
spirit. The name' Trojans' fitted
them.
"I came out with an article
prior to a showdown between
USC and Stanford in which I
called attention,to the fighting
spirit of USC athletes and
named them 'Trojans.' From
then on, we used the term 'Tro
jan' all the time, and it stuck."
The fighting spirit still re
mains but the Trojans no
longer play under terrific hand
icaps.
"They play with all the
odds," said Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh, explaining
that USC now comes to battle
better-manned and better
equipped than most other

teams.
"They've always (unless we
call on ancient history) had a
tremendous wealth of talent,"
Walsh said. "They recruit the
best players to play football.
They just say, 'lt's important to
our school to have a good
football team, and we're going
to have one whatever it
takes.' "
Walsh was quick to add that
he does not quarrel with USC's
recruiting methods. Others
have not been quite so quick.
Some charge that USC has
been able to get the best
athletes in the country year
after year only because of their
laxity in admissions' standards.
These people question

whether all of USC's players
are academically eligible, and
they are disturbed that USC's
players are accorded special
educational treatment. But this
usually comes from people
who come up short on the
scoreboard.
"That's just sour grapes,"
said USC Head football Coach
John Robinson, commenting
on that criticism. While not
denying the allegations,
Robinson said, "I don't believe
we've recruited a player in the
last decade that wasn't also re
cruited by UCLA or Cal." It's
just that nobody does it better.
Last year, USC was ranked
No. 1 among the nation's col-

O.J. Simpson (32) and Mike Garrett (30) are two reasons that the USC
football tradition stands proud. Each man won the Heisman Trophy,
annually given to the nation's best collegiate player. Other backs who
continued in these men's great footsteps are Anthony Davis, Ricky
Bell and the current USC star, Charles White.

picking up 24 of the most
talented prep stars in the na
tion, among them 10 high
school Ail-Americans. They re
cruited well the year before. In
fact, one must think, in retros
pect, that they recruited re
markably well, considering the
athletes they passed up.
"I wanna show 'em I can
play. They didn't recruit me,"
said sophomore split end
Kenny Margerum, who pre
pped in Southern California.
"When I was a little kid, I al
ways dreamed of playing for
'SC. I didn't get a chance. I
guess the next best thing is to
beat 'em."
USC did so well in its recruit
ing that year that it passed up
Margerum, who now leads the
Pac-10 in touchdown recep
tions and receiving yardage.
The Trojans also neglected to
heavily recruit Darrin Nelson,
also a Southern California na
tive. They thought they had
better athletes.

Said Robinson, "Thre's a
strong identity with the univer
sity."
That's understandable.
Everybody loves a winner, and
USC has a winning tradition..
The Cardinals' task will be to
try to change that tradition, at
least for a day.
Also instrumental in the con
tinuance of the USC tradition is
the tremendous support they
receive from their alumni and
fans. Ruetz said that USC's
"tradition has been built on a
consistency of alumni sup
port." Ruetz indicated that,
"They raise more money for
scholarships than our Buck
Club."
The alumni and fans of USC
support the Trojans not only
financially, but spiritually.
More than 20,000 USC boos
ters are expected to make the
haul up north for the match
against the Cards.
Also fundamental to the

maintenance of Trojan excel
lence is the University's high
regard for the Trojan spirit of
athletic competition. People at
USC are not USC students,
workers, or staff members.
They are Trojans.
USC has as a mascot a
powerful-looking Trojan horse
named Traveler 111 who serves
as a symbol of strength and en
durance for the Trojans.
A statue of a Trojan warrior,
appropriately named Tommy
Trojan, stands in the center of
the campus and serves as a
symbol of the school's pride
and spirit.
Even their band exists as part
of the Trojan spirit of athletic
competition, unlike Stanford's
band which exists as an entity
in and of itself. Southern Cal's
band is not the USC marching
band, but the Trojan marching
band.
At USC, everything is geared
toward the Trojan spirit and
tradition.

"We won a lot of games at USC
before we put on our pads" -
former USC assistant coach
Craig Fertig.
USC went into fall practice
this year led by a quarterback
who hadn't yet played a full
game of college football, with
out a proven fullback, and with
only 11 returning starters off a
1977 squad that went only 8-4
on the season. In the UPI pre
season poll, the USC Trojans
were ranked seventh in the na
tion.
If this were any other college
football team, it would have
been lucky to be ranked at all.
But this isn't any other college

"That's just sour grapes,"
said USC Head football Coach
John Robinson, commenting
on that criticism. While not
denying the allegations,
Robinson said, "I don't believe

leges ih high school recruiting,
picking up 24 of the most
talented prep stars in the na
tion, among them 10 high
school Ail-Americans. They re
cruited well the year before. In
fact, one must think, in retros
pect, that they recruited re
markably well, considering the
athletes they passed up.
"I wanna show 'em I can
play. They didn't recruit me,"
said sophomore split end
Kenny Margerum, who pre
pped in Southern California.
"When I was a little kid, I al
ways dreamed of playing for
'SC. I didn't get a chance. I
guess the next best thing is to
beat 'em."
USC did so well in its recruit
ing that year that it passed up
Margerum, who now leads the
Pac-10 in touchdown recep
tions and receiving yardage.
The Trojans also neglected to
heavily recruit Darrin Nelson,
also a Southern California na
tive. They thought they had
better athletes.

Said Robinson, "Thre's a
strong identity with the univer
sity."
That's understandable.
Everybody loves a winner, and
USC has a winning tradition..
The Cardinals' task will be to
try to change that tradition, at
least for a day.
Also instrumental in the con
tinuance of the USC tradition is
the tremendous support they
receive from their alumni and
fans. Ruetz said that USC's
"tradition has been built on a
consistency of alumni sup
port." Ruetz indicated that,
"They raise more money for
scholarships than our Buck
Club."
The alumni and fans of USC
support the Trojans not only
financially, but spiritually.
More than 20,000 USC boos
ters are expected to make the
haul up north for the match
against the Cards.
Also fundamental to the

maintenance of Trojan excel
lence is the University's high
regard for the Trojan spirit of
athletic competition. People at
USC are not USC students,
workers, or staff members.
They are Trojans.
USC has as a mascot a
powerful-looking Trojan horse
named Traveler 111 who serves
as a symbol of strength and en
durance for the Trojans.
A statue of a Trojan warrior,
appropriately named Tommy
Trojan, stands in the center of
the campus and serves as a
symbol of the school's pride
and spirit.
Even their band exists as part
of the Trojan spirit of athletic
competition, unlike Stanford's
band which exists as an entity
in and of itself. Southern Cal's
band is not the USC marching
band, but the Trojan marching
band.
At USC, everything is geared
toward the Trojan spirit and
tradition.
"We won a lot of games at USC
before we put on our pads" -
former USC assistant coach
Craig Fertig.
USC went into fall practice
this year led by a quarterback
who hadn't yet played a full
game of college football, with
out a proven fullback, and with
only 11 returning starters off a
1977 squad that went only 8-4
on the season. In the UPI pre
season poll, the USC Trojans
were ranked seventh in the na
tion.
If this were any other college
football team, it would have
been lucky to be ranked at all.
But this isn't any other college
football team, this is USC.
When people write about
USC, they tend to use all capi
tal letters (and boldface print, if
they have it). When they speak
of USC, they tend to lower
their voice several octaves.
This is because USC is diffe
rent, something special, and
seemingly on a level above any
other college football team.
There is an aura about them, an
aura that comes from winning.
Year after year, USC marches
onto the football field with the
biggest, strongest, and most
talented players in the country.
And year after year, they march
off the field with one of the
best teams in the nation.
Though the Trojans have not
won a national championship
in several years, they are con
sistently battling for this con
verted title.
The Trojans, in striving for
excellence, have created a
winning tradition that is un
matched in college football.
Southern Cal is the No. 1
bowl team in college football
with an impressive 17-6 re
cord. In post-season bowl
games, USC has the most wins
(17) and the best percentage
(.738) of any team around.
The Trojans have sustained
much of this success while de
veloping one of the most pow
erful offenses in college foot
ball the power I.
In this power I, the Trojans
don't do anything fancy, they
just come right at you with the
biggest and strongest lineman
in the country leading the way
for the country's best blocking
fullback and the country's
most talented tailback.
And over the years, the Tro
jans' glorious tailback has led
the way for USC into the na
tional spotlight.
The Trojan tailback has been
synonymous with greatness.
The list of great Trojan tail
backs seems to go on forever.
It includes such notables as
O.J. Simpson, Ricky Bell, An
thony Davis, Mike Garrett,
Clarence Davis, Frank Gifford,
and of course, Charles White.
Even 'SC tailbacks that don't
start do better than most
schools' running backs. White,
as a freshman playing behind
Ricky Bell, rushed for 744 yards
in 1976.
USC has more players ip the
NFL any other college in
the nation. Last year they had

45 players on the final rosters
of the NFL teams. At the begin
ning of this season, there were
at least 60 Trojans on 25 of the
28 NFL teams. Maybe this is
why some people say playing
SC is like playing the pros.
Many people actually be
lieve playing USC is like play
ing the pros. This is one of the
best things USC has going for
them. People expect them to
be great, so they are. Many
teams have been 'psyched out'
by this aura of excellence. They
have been defeated, by anxiety
and fear, even before the battle
with the mighty Trojans has
begun. This what prompted
Coach Fertig's anecdote at the
start of this article. People are
afraid of SC because of the
winning tradition they have
maintained.
Even following a 'disappoint
ing" 8-4 season and an even
more 'disappointing' No. 13
ranking in the final polls (any
thing short of a 12-0 record and
at least one wire poll ranking of
No. 1 is disappointing for
USC), people expect greatness
from USC.
So far this year, these people
have gotten pretty much what
they expected. The sixth
ranked Trojans are 6-1, includ
ing an impressive win over
previously top-ranked Ala
bama.
What is it, one has to won
der, that started such an awe
some tradition?
"Well, they've always had a
tremendous athletic tradition.
But I think it was their rivalry
with Notre Dame," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz, explaining that USC's
longtime intersectional rivalry
with Notre Dame (which has
one of the great football tradi
tions of all times) helped build
their own tradition.
"Notre Dame's tradition,
with Rockne and everybody
else, I think, wore off on them,
because they've always been
such great competitors,"
speculated Ruetz. "They've
always wanted to be strong

against Notre Dame."
Craig Fertig, who now
coaches the Oregon State
Beavers, doesn't believe the
tradition started quite so far
back.
"I think it started with
McKay," said Fertig of his
former mentor John McKay.
"McKay got the big, strong
players that didn't do anything
fancy, they just beat you up."
The Trojans, though noted
primarily for their bruising of
fense, have led the Pac-8 in de
fense for the past six straight
seasons.
Fertig said also that many
teams were both "scared" of
USC and in "awe" of their
power. Apparently, however,
this is not the way the Trojan
tradition began.
USC's nickname, "Trojans,"
originated in 1912. Up to that
time the USC teams were cal
led the Methodists or Wes
leyans, nicknames which were
not looked upon with favor by
university officials.
So, Los Angeles Times sports
editor Owen Bird was asked by
USC officials to select an ap
propriate nickname.
"At this time, the athletes
and the coaches of the univer
sity were under terrific hand
icaps," recalled Bird. "They
were facing teams that were
bigger and better equipped,
yet they had splendid fighting
spirit. The name' Trojans' fitted
them.
"I came out with an article
prior to a showdown between
USC and Stanford in which I
called attention,to the fighting
spirit of USC athletes and
named them 'Trojans.' From
then on, we used the term 'Tro
jan' all the time, and it stuck."
The fighting spirit still re
mains but the Trojans no
longer play under terrific hand
icaps.
"They play with all the
odds," said Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh, explaining
that USC now comes to battle
better-manned and better
equipped than most other

teams.
"They've always (unless we
call on ancient history) had a
tremendous wealth of talent,"
Walsh said. "They recruit the
best players to play football.
They just say, 'lt's important to
our school to have a good
football team, and we're going
to have one whatever it
takes.' "
Walsh was quick to add that
he does not quarrel with USC's
recruiting methods. Others
have not been quite so quick.
Some charge that USC has
been able to get the best
athletes in the country year
after year only because of their
laxity in admissions' standards.

teams were both "scared" of
USC and in "awe" of their
power. Apparently, however,
this is not the way the Trojan
tradition began.
USC's nickname, "Trojans,"
originated in 1912. Up to that
time the USC teams were cal
led the Methodists or Wes
leyans, nicknames which were
not looked upon with favor by
university officials.
So, Los Angeles Times sports
editor Owen Bird was asked by
USC officials to select an ap
propriate nickname.
"At this time, the athletes
and the coaches of the univer
sity were under terrific hand
icaps," recalled Bird. "They
were facing teams that were
bigger and better equipped,
yet they had splendid fighting
spirit. The name' Trojans' fitted
them.
"I came out with an article
prior to a showdown between
USC and Stanford in which I
called attention,to the fighting
spirit of USC athletes and
named them 'Trojans.' From
then on, we used the term 'Tro
jan' all the time, and it stuck."
The fighting spirit still re
mains but the Trojans no
longer play under terrific hand
icaps.
"They play with all the
odds," said Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh, explaining
that USC now comes to battle
better-manned and better
equipped than most other

teams.
"They've always (unless we
call on ancient history) had a
tremendous wealth of talent,"
Walsh said. "They recruit the
best players to play football.
They just say, 'lt's important to
our school to have a good
football team, and we're going
to have one whatever it
takes.' "
Walsh was quick to add that
he does not quarrel with USC's
recruiting methods. Others
have not been quite so quick.
Some charge that USC has
been able to get the best
athletes in the country year
after year only because of their
laxity in admissions' standards.
These people question

whether all of USC's players
are academically eligible, and
they are disturbed that USC's
players are accorded special
educational treatment. But this
usually comes from people
who come up short on the
scoreboard.
"That's just sour grapes,"
said USC Head football Coach
John Robinson, commenting
on that criticism. While not
denying the allegations,
Robinson said, "I don't believe
we've recruited a player in the
last decade that wasn't also re
cruited by UCLA or Cal." It's
just that nobody does it better.
Last year, USC was ranked
No. 1 among the nation's col-

O.J. Simpson (32) and Mike Garrett (30) are two reasons that the USC

leges ih high school recruiting,
picking up 24 of the most
talented prep stars in the na
tion, among them 10 high
school Ail-Americans. They re
cruited well the year before. In
fact, one must think, in retros
pect, that they recruited re
markably well, considering the
athletes they passed up.
"I wanna show 'em I can
play. They didn't recruit me,"
said sophomore split end
Kenny Margerum, who pre
pped in Southern California.
"When I was a little kid, I al
ways dreamed of playing for
'SC. I didn't get a chance. I
guess the next best thing is to
beat 'em."
USC did so well in its recruit
ing that year that it passed up
Margerum, who now leads the
Pac-10 in touchdown recep
tions and receiving yardage.
The Trojans also neglected to
heavily recruit Darrin Nelson,
also a Southern California na
tive. They thought they had
better athletes.

Said Robinson, "Thre's a
strong identity with the univer
sity."
That's understandable.
Everybody loves a winner, and
USC has a winning tradition..
The Cardinals' task will be to
try to change that tradition, at
least for a day.
Also instrumental in the con
tinuance of the USC tradition is
the tremendous support they
receive from their alumni and
fans. Ruetz said that USC's
"tradition has been built on a
consistency of alumni sup
port." Ruetz indicated that,
"They raise more money for
scholarships than our Buck
Club."
The alumni and fans of USC
support the Trojans not only
financially, but spiritually.
More than 20,000 USC boos
ters are expected to make the
haul up north for the match
against the Cards.
Also fundamental to the

maintenance of Trojan excel
lence is the University's high
regard for the Trojan spirit of
athletic competition. People at
USC are not USC students,
workers, or staff members.
They are Trojans.
USC has as a mascot a
powerful-looking Trojan horse
named Traveler 111 who serves
as a symbol of strength and en
durance for the Trojans.
A statue of a Trojan warrior,
appropriately named Tommy
Trojan, stands in the center of
the campus and serves as a
symbol of the school's pride
and spirit.
Even their band exists as part
of the Trojan spirit of athletic
competition, unlike Stanford's
band which exists as an entity
in and of itself. Southern Cal's
band is not the USC marching
band, but the Trojan marching
band.
At USC, everything is geared
toward the Trojan spirit and
tradition.
"We won a lot of games at USC
before we put on our pads" -
former USC assistant coach
Craig Fertig.
USC went into fall practice
this year led by a quarterback
who hadn't yet played a full
game of college football, with
out a proven fullback, and with
only 11 returning starters off a
1977 squad that went only 8-4
on the season. In the UPI pre
season poll, the USC Trojans
were ranked seventh in the na
tion.
If this were any other college
football team, it would have
been lucky to be ranked at all.
But this isn't any other college
football team, this is USC.
When people write about
USC, they tend to use all capi
tal letters (and boldface print, if
they have it). When they speak
of USC, they tend to lower
their voice several octaves.
This is because USC is diffe
rent, something special, and
seemingly on a level above any
other college football team.
There is an aura about them, an
aura that comes from winning.
Year after year, USC marches
onto the football field with the
biggest, strongest, and most
talented players in the country.
And year after year, they march
off the field with one of the
best teams in the nation.
Though the Trojans have not
won a national championship
in several years, they are con
sistently battling for this con
verted title.
The Trojans, in striving for
excellence, have created a
winning tradition that is un
matched in college football.
Southern Cal is the No. 1
bowl team in college football
with an impressive 17-6 re
cord. In post-season bowl
games, USC has the most wins
(17) and the best percentage
(.738) of any team around.
The Trojans have sustained
much of this success while de
veloping one of the most pow
erful offenses in college foot
ball the power I.
In this power I, the Trojans
don't do anything fancy, they
just come right at you with the
biggest and strongest lineman
in the country leading the way
for the country's best blocking
fullback and the country's
most talented tailback.
And over the years, the Tro
jans' glorious tailback has led
the way for USC into the na
tional spotlight.
The Trojan tailback has been
synonymous with greatness.
The list of great Trojan tail
backs seems to go on forever.
It includes such notables as
O.J. Simpson, Ricky Bell, An
thony Davis, Mike Garrett,
Clarence Davis, Frank Gifford,
and of course, Charles White.
Even 'SC tailbacks that don't
start do better than most
schools' running backs. White,
as a freshman playing behind
Ricky Bell, rushed for 744 yards
in 1976.
USC has more players ip the
NFL any other college in
the nation. Last year they had

45 players on the final rosters
of the NFL teams. At the begin
ning of this season, there were
at least 60 Trojans on 25 of the
28 NFL teams. Maybe this is
why some people say playing
SC is like playing the pros.
Many people actually be
lieve playing USC is like play
ing the pros. This is one of the
best things USC has going for
them. People expect them to
be great, so they are. Many
teams have been 'psyched out'
by this aura of excellence. They
have been defeated, by anxiety
and fear, even before the battle
with the mighty Trojans has
begun. This what prompted
Coach Fertig's anecdote at the
start of this article. People are
afraid of SC because of the
winning tradition they have
maintained.
Even following a 'disappoint
ing" 8-4 season and an even
more 'disappointing' No. 13
ranking in the final polls (any
thing short of a 12-0 record and
at least one wire poll ranking of
No. 1 is disappointing for
USC), people expect greatness
from USC.
So far this year, these people
have gotten pretty much what
they expected. The sixth
ranked Trojans are 6-1, includ
ing an impressive win over
previously top-ranked Ala
bama.
What is it, one has to won
der, that started such an awe
some tradition?
"Well, they've always had a
tremendous athletic tradition.
But I think it was their rivalry
with Notre Dame," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz, explaining that USC's
longtime intersectional rivalry
with Notre Dame (which has
one of the great football tradi
tions of all times) helped build
their own tradition.
"Notre Dame's tradition,
with Rockne and everybody
else, I think, wore off on them,
because they've always been
such great competitors,"
speculated Ruetz. "They've
always wanted to be strong

against Notre Dame."
Craig Fertig, who now
coaches the Oregon State
Beavers, doesn't believe the
tradition started quite so far
back.
"I think it started with
McKay," said Fertig of his
former mentor John McKay.
"McKay got the big, strong
players that didn't do anything
fancy, they just beat you up."
The Trojans, though noted
primarily for their bruising of
fense, have led the Pac-8 in de
fense for the past six straight
seasons.
Fertig said also that many
teams were both "scared" of
USC and in "awe" of their
power. Apparently, however,
this is not the way the Trojan
tradition began.

Coach Fertig's anecdote at the
start of this article. People are
afraid of SC because of the
winning tradition they have
maintained.
Even following a 'disappoint
ing" 8-4 season and an even
more 'disappointing' No. 13
ranking in the final polls (any
thing short of a 12-0 record and
at least one wire poll ranking of
No. 1 is disappointing for
USC), people expect greatness
from USC.
So far this year, these people
have gotten pretty much what
they expected. The sixth
ranked Trojans are 6-1, includ
ing an impressive win over
previously top-ranked Ala
bama.
What is it, one has to won
der, that started such an awe
some tradition?
"Well, they've always had a
tremendous athletic tradition.
But I think it was their rivalry
with Notre Dame," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz, explaining that USC's
longtime intersectional rivalry
with Notre Dame (which has
one of the great football tradi
tions of all times) helped build
their own tradition.
"Notre Dame's tradition,
with Rockne and everybody
else, I think, wore off on them,
because they've always been
such great competitors,"
speculated Ruetz. "They've
always wanted to be strong

against Notre Dame."
Craig Fertig, who now
coaches the Oregon State
Beavers, doesn't believe the
tradition started quite so far
back.
"I think it started with
McKay," said Fertig of his
former mentor John McKay.
"McKay got the big, strong
players that didn't do anything
fancy, they just beat you up."
The Trojans, though noted
primarily for their bruising of
fense, have led the Pac-8 in de
fense for the past six straight
seasons.
Fertig said also that many
teams were both "scared" of
USC and in "awe" of their
power. Apparently, however,
this is not the way the Trojan
tradition began.
USC's nickname, "Trojans,"
originated in 1912. Up to that
time the USC teams were cal
led the Methodists or Wes
leyans, nicknames which were
not looked upon with favor by
university officials.
So, Los Angeles Times sports
editor Owen Bird was asked by
USC officials to select an ap
propriate nickname.
"At this time, the athletes
and the coaches of the univer
sity were under terrific hand
icaps," recalled Bird. "They
were facing teams that were
bigger and better equipped,
yet they had splendid fighting
spirit. The name' Trojans' fitted
them.
"I came out with an article
prior to a showdown between
USC and Stanford in which I
called attention,to the fighting
spirit of USC athletes and
named them 'Trojans.' From
then on, we used the term 'Tro
jan' all the time, and it stuck."
The fighting spirit still re
mains but the Trojans no
longer play under terrific hand
icaps.
"They play with all the
odds," said Stanford Head
Coach Bill Walsh, explaining
that USC now comes to battle
better-manned and better
equipped than most other

teams.
"They've always (unless we
call on ancient history) had a
tremendous wealth of talent,"
Walsh said. "They recruit the
best players to play football.
They just say, 'lt's important to
our school to have a good
football team, and we're going
to have one whatever it
takes.' "
Walsh was quick to add that
he does not quarrel with USC's
recruiting methods. Others
have not been quite so quick.
Some charge that USC has
been able to get the best
athletes in the country year
after year only because of their
laxity in admissions' standards.
These people question

whether all of USC's players
are academically eligible, and
they are disturbed that USC's
players are accorded special
educational treatment. But this
usually comes from people
who come up short on the
scoreboard.
"That's just sour grapes,"
said USC Head football Coach
John Robinson, commenting
on that criticism. While not
denying the allegations,
Robinson said, "I don't believe
we've recruited a player in the
last decade that wasn't also re
cruited by UCLA or Cal." It's
just that nobody does it better.
Last year, USC was ranked
No. 1 among the nation's col-

O.J. Simpson (32) and Mike Garrett (30) are two reasons that the USC
football tradition stands proud. Each man won the Heisman Trophy,
annually given to the nation's best collegiate player. Other backs who
continued in these men's great footsteps are Anthony Davis, Ricky
Bell and the current USC star, Charles White.

leges ih high school recruiting,
picking up 24 of the most
talented prep stars in the na
tion, among them 10 high
school Ail-Americans. They re
cruited well the year before. In
fact, one must think, in retros
pect, that they recruited re
markably well, considering the
athletes they passed up.
"I wanna show 'em I can
play. They didn't recruit me,"
said sophomore split end
Kenny Margerum, who pre
pped in Southern California.
"When I was a little kid, I al
ways dreamed of playing for
'SC. I didn't get a chance. I
guess the next best thing is to
beat 'em."
USC did so well in its recruit
ing that year that it passed up
Margerum, who now leads the
Pac-10 in touchdown recep
tions and receiving yardage.
The Trojans also neglected to
heavily recruit Darrin Nelson,
also a Southern California na
tive. They thought they had
better athletes.

Said Robinson, "Thre's a
strong identity with the univer
sity."
That's understandable.
Everybody loves a winner, and
USC has a winning tradition..
The Cardinals' task will be to
try to change that tradition, at
least for a day.
Also instrumental in the con
tinuance of the USC tradition is
the tremendous support they
receive from their alumni and
fans. Ruetz said that USC's
"tradition has been built on a
consistency of alumni sup
port." Ruetz indicated that,
"They raise more money for
scholarships than our Buck
Club."
The alumni and fans of USC
support the Trojans not only
financially, but spiritually.
More than 20,000 USC boos
ters are expected to make the
haul up north for the match
against the Cards.
Also fundamental to the

maintenance of Trojan excel
lence is the University's high
regard for the Trojan spirit of
athletic competition. People at
USC are not USC students,
workers, or staff members.
They are Trojans.
USC has as a mascot a
powerful-looking Trojan horse
named Traveler 111 who serves
as a symbol of strength and en
durance for the Trojans.
A statue of a Trojan warrior,
appropriately named Tommy
Trojan, stands in the center of
the campus and serves as a
symbol of the school's pride
and spirit.
Even their band exists as part
of the Trojan spirit of athletic
competition, unlike Stanford's
band which exists as an entity
in and of itself. Southern Cal's
band is not the USC marching
band, but the Trojan marching
band.
At USC, everything is geared
toward the Trojan spirit and
tradition.
"We won a lot of games at USC
before we put on our pads" -
former USC assistant coach
Craig Fertig.
USC went into fall practice
this year led by a quarterback
who hadn't yet played a full
game of college football, with
out a proven fullback, and with
only 11 returning starters off a
1977 squad that went only 8-4
on the season. In the UPI pre
season poll, the USC Trojans
were ranked seventh in the na
tion.
If this were any other college
football team, it would have
been lucky to be ranked at all.
But this isn't any other college
football team, this is USC.
When people write about
USC, they tend to use all capi
tal letters (and boldface print, if
they have it). When they speak
of USC, they tend to lower
their voice several octaves.
This is because USC is diffe
rent, something special, and
seemingly on a level above any
other college football team.
There is an aura about them, an
aura that comes from winning.
Year after year, USC marches
onto the football field with the
biggest, strongest, and most
talented players in the country.
And year after year, they march
off the field with one of the
best teams in the nation.
Though the Trojans have not
won a national championship
in several years, they are con
sistently battling for this con
verted title.
The Trojans, in striving for
excellence, have created a
winning tradition that is un
matched in college football.
Southern Cal is the No. 1
bowl team in college football
with an impressive 17-6 re
cord. In post-season bowl
games, USC has the most wins
(17) and the best percentage
(.738) of any team around.
The Trojans have sustained
much of this success while de
veloping one of the most pow
erful offenses in college foot
ball the power I.
In this power I, the Trojans
don't do anything fancy, they
just come right at you with the
biggest and strongest lineman
in the country leading the way
for the country's best blocking
fullback and the country's
most talented tailback.
And over the years, the Tro
jans' glorious tailback has led
the way for USC into the na
tional spotlight.
The Trojan tailback has been
synonymous with greatness.
The list of great Trojan tail
backs seems to go on forever.
It includes such notables as
O.J. Simpson, Ricky Bell, An
thony Davis, Mike Garrett,
Clarence Davis, Frank Gifford,
and of course, Charles White.
Even 'SC tailbacks that don't
start do better than most
schools' running backs. White,
as a freshman playing behind
Ricky Bell, rushed for 744 yards
in 1976.
USC has more players ip the
NFL any other college in
the nation. Last year they had

45 players on the final rosters
of the NFL teams. At the begin
ning of this season, there were
at least 60 Trojans on 25 of the
28 NFL teams. Maybe this is
why some people say playing
SC is like playing the pros.
Many people actually be
lieve playing USC is like play
ing the pros. This is one of the
best things USC has going for
them. People expect them to
be great, so they are. Many
teams have been 'psyched out'
by this aura of excellence. They
have been defeated, by anxiety
and fear, even before the battle
with the mighty Trojans has
begun. This what prompted
Coach Fertig's anecdote at the
start of this article. People are
afraid of SC because of the
winning tradition they have
maintained.
Even following a 'disappoint
ing" 8-4 season and an even
