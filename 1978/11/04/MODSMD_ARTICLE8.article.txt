# USC plays safe with Smith

If the Stanford backfield ex
pects to go anywhere on
Saturday they had better be
ware of Dennis Smith
6-foot-3, 200-pounds and a
high jump champion. He leads
the USC team in interceptions.
Apparently he likes to eat quar
terbacks. And running backs.
And wide receivers. His team
mates call him Kojak.
Smith is an excellent athlete
according to Ken Margerum
and Andre Tyler, both of whom
remember him from their high
school days. "He's a great
athlete. He's real big and
strong," Margerum said. "He's
really an exceptional athlete,"
Tyler agreed.
How exceptional? Well, last
year coach John Robinson ex
cused him from two days of
spring practice and sent him
over to the track team. He
worked out a couple of times,

and then cleared seven feet in
the high jump to take second in
the USC-UCLA meet. He did it
again to take third in the Pac-8
championships.
Smith is a sophomore, re
placing graduated All-
American Dennis Thurman. As
a freshman he played a total of
55 minutes, rrjade half a dozen
tackles, and intercepted two
passes against TCU, returning
one for 13 yards. This year he
has a team-leading total of four
interceptions.
He graduated from the same
high school as his predecessor
Thurman, Santa Monica.
He didn't do too badly there
either. He was named 1976
CIF 4A (large schools) Co-
Player of the Year.
He made the Coach and
Athlete, Scholastic Coach and
Joe Namath Magazine All-
American teams, playing both
defensive back and wide re

ceiver.
As a senior he caught 33 pas
ses for 777 yards, with a 23.5
average. But he only had three
interceptions. Know why? Op
posing teams refused to throw
in his area.
However, the Stanford
backfield doesn't seem overly
concerned about Smith, even
though he has an advantage in
size.
According to Andre Tyler,
he's not as fast as he could be.
"It's going to be a tough task,
but he isn't real fast as far as
foot speed. He covers a lot of
ground, but I think I can beat
him."
Kenny Margerum has some
reservations, but he too is not
overly concerned. "I'm a little
apprehensive. He's a great
athlete.
"He's big and strong, but
he's not all that fast. I'm faster

Trojan sophomore Dennis Smith takes a breather on the sidelines
during a recent USC battle. Smith co-leads the team (with cornerback
Herb Ward) in interceptions with four. Smith will be put to the
ultimate test today against the nation's leading passer, Stanford's
Steve Dils.
