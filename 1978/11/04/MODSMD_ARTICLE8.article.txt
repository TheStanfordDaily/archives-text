# USC plays safe with Smith
## 
### SALLY JENKINS 
If the Stanford backfield ex
pects to go anywhere on
Saturday they had better be
ware of Dennis Smith
6-foot-3, 200-pounds and a
high jump champion. He leads
the USC team in interceptions.
Apparently he likes to eat quar
terbacks. And running backs.
And wide receivers. His team
mates call him Kojak.
Smith is an excellent athlete
according to Ken Margerum
and Andre Tyler, both of whom
remember him from their high
school days. "He's a great
athlete. He's real big and
strong," Margerum said. "He's
really an exceptional athlete,"
Tyler agreed.
How exceptional? Well, last
year coach John Robinson ex
cused him from two days of
spring practice and sent him
over to the track team. He
worked out a couple of times,

and then cleared seven feet in
the high jump to take second in
the USC-UCLA meet. He did it
again to take third in the Pac-8
championships.
Smith is a sophomore, re
placing graduated All-
American Dennis Thurman. As
a freshman he played a total of
55 minutes, rrjade half a dozen
tackles, and intercepted two
passes against TCU, returning
one for 13 yards. This year he
has a team-leading total of four
interceptions.
He graduated from the same
high school as his predecessor
Thurman, Santa Monica.
He didn't do too badly there
either. He was named 1976
CIF 4A (large schools) Co-
Player of the Year.
He made the Coach and
Athlete, Scholastic Coach and
Joe Namath Magazine All-
American teams, playing both
defensive back and wide re

ceiver.
As a senior he caught 33 pas
ses for 777 yards, with a 23.5
average. But he only had three
interceptions. Know why? Op
posing teams refused to throw
in his area.
However, the Stanford
backfield doesn't seem overly
concerned about Smith, even
though he has an advantage in
size.
According to Andre Tyler,
he's not as fast as he could be.
"It's going to be a tough task,
but he isn't real fast as far as
foot speed. He covers a lot of
ground, but I think I can beat
him."
Kenny Margerum has some
reservations, but he too is not
overly concerned. "I'm a little
apprehensive. He's a great
athlete.
"He's big and strong, but
he's not all that fast. I'm faster

Trojan sophomore Dennis Smith takes a breather on the sidelines

ultimate test today against the nation's leading passer, Stanford's
Steve Dils.
than he is but he's got great
range. We just have to split the
zones and get out of his range.
We have a couple of plays to do
this," Margerum said.
As for Smith himself, the
speed factordoesn't worry him
at all. "Margerum's fast, but all
the team's we've played so far
have had something as far as
speed. I'm not really worried
about that," he said.
One might wonder if Smith
suffers from any lack of experi
ence being a sophomore. "At
first maybe, but it seems like I
improved every game. I feel
pretty comfortable right now,"
he said.
Tyler and Margerum both
agree, seeing as how they're
both sophomores, also. "Ear
lier in the season it might have
made a difference. But right
now it should be pretty even,"
Tyler said.
Even so, another player re
ports that on film, Smith shows
a tendency to be fooled by cer
tain types of pass plays. This
could be evidence of inexperi
ence.
Smith plays a particularly
deep safety position. How will
this affect Stanford's passing
game in terms of the bomb?
Again Smith isn't worried.
"We are expecting some prob
lems. Dils is a great passer. But
you have to fear the bomb
every week. Let 'em catch the
short ones and then tackle
'em," he said.
Margerum is a little hesitant
about the bomb. "It's really
hard to say, because Smith
plays so deep, unless we go
underneath him so he has to
come up. Then when Coach
Walsh picks the right time,
bang," he said.
Tyler agrees but in a different
way. "We're definitely going to
throw deep. They play a cover
age that is conducive to throw
ing the bomb. We will throw
deep but in a different form,"
he said.
As for his habit of eating

quarterbacks, coach Robinson
said, "Dennis has unlimited
potential. His size, speed and
great leaping ability give him
great range as a safety man, but
perhaps his greatest quality is
his ability to hit. If a quarter
back takes off and runs, he'll
come up and wallop him."
But Smith say§ it's not just
quarterbacks, but "whoever's
running the ball. I expect Nel
son to be rushing a lot, catch
ing some passes. I'll be meet
ing up with Darrin."
What does Steve Dils think

of all this? "If I'm running the
ball at all I'll generally be
scrambling or getting rid of it,"
Dils laughed.
When told about Smith's
four interceptions, Dils shrug
ged and waved his hand.
"Aaah, that's nothing," Dils
said.
One can only hope it's no
thing. With Dennis Smith in
the secondary, Dils will have to
beat his best. Otherwise, it will
be a long afternoon.

than he is but he's got great
range. We just have to split the
zones and get out of his range.
We have a couple of plays to do
this," Margerum said.
As for Smith himself, the
speed factordoesn't worry him
at all. "Margerum's fast, but all
the team's we've played so far
have had something as far as
speed. I'm not really worried
about that," he said.
One might wonder if Smith
suffers from any lack of experi
ence being a sophomore. "At
first maybe, but it seems like I
improved every game. I feel
pretty comfortable right now,"
he said.
Tyler and Margerum both
agree, seeing as how they're
both sophomores, also. "Ear
lier in the season it might have
made a difference. But right
now it should be pretty even,"
Tyler said.
Even so, another player re
ports that on film, Smith shows
a tendency to be fooled by cer
tain types of pass plays. This
could be evidence of inexperi
ence.
Smith plays a particularly
deep safety position. How will
this affect Stanford's passing
game in terms of the bomb?
Again Smith isn't worried.
"We are expecting some prob
lems. Dils is a great passer. But
you have to fear the bomb
every week. Let 'em catch the
short ones and then tackle
'em," he said.
Margerum is a little hesitant
about the bomb. "It's really
hard to say, because Smith
plays so deep, unless we go
underneath him so he has to
come up. Then when Coach
Walsh picks the right time,
bang," he said.
Tyler agrees but in a different
way. "We're definitely going to
throw deep. They play a cover
age that is conducive to throw
ing the bomb. We will throw
deep but in a different form,"
he said.
As for his habit of eating

quarterbacks, coach Robinson
said, "Dennis has unlimited
potential. His size, speed and
great leaping ability give him
great range as a safety man, but
perhaps his greatest quality is
his ability to hit. If a quarter
back takes off and runs, he'll
come up and wallop him."
But Smith say§ it's not just
quarterbacks, but "whoever's
running the ball. I expect Nel
son to be rushing a lot, catch
ing some passes. I'll be meet
ing up with Darrin."
What does Steve Dils think

of all this? "If I'm running the
ball at all I'll generally be
scrambling or getting rid of it,"
Dils laughed.
When told about Smith's
four interceptions, Dils shrug
ged and waved his hand.
"Aaah, that's nothing," Dils
said.
One can only hope it's no
thing. With Dennis Smith in
the secondary, Dils will have to
beat his best. Otherwise, it will
be a long afternoon.
If the Stanford backfield ex
pects to go anywhere on
Saturday they had better be
ware of Dennis Smith
6-foot-3, 200-pounds and a
high jump champion. He leads
the USC team in interceptions.
Apparently he likes to eat quar
terbacks. And running backs.
And wide receivers. His team
mates call him Kojak.
Smith is an excellent athlete
according to Ken Margerum
and Andre Tyler, both of whom
remember him from their high
school days. "He's a great
athlete. He's real big and
strong," Margerum said. "He's
really an exceptional athlete,"
Tyler agreed.
How exceptional? Well, last
year coach John Robinson ex
cused him from two days of
spring practice and sent him
over to the track team. He
worked out a couple of times,

and then cleared seven feet in
the high jump to take second in
the USC-UCLA meet. He did it
again to take third in the Pac-8
championships.
Smith is a sophomore, re
placing graduated All-
American Dennis Thurman. As
a freshman he played a total of
55 minutes, rrjade half a dozen
tackles, and intercepted two
passes against TCU, returning
one for 13 yards. This year he
has a team-leading total of four
interceptions.
He graduated from the same
high school as his predecessor
Thurman, Santa Monica.
He didn't do too badly there
either. He was named 1976
CIF 4A (large schools) Co-
Player of the Year.
He made the Coach and
Athlete, Scholastic Coach and
Joe Namath Magazine All-
American teams, playing both
defensive back and wide re

ceiver.
As a senior he caught 33 pas

ports that on film, Smith shows
a tendency to be fooled by cer
tain types of pass plays. This
could be evidence of inexperi
ence.
Smith plays a particularly
deep safety position. How will
this affect Stanford's passing
game in terms of the bomb?
Again Smith isn't worried.
"We are expecting some prob
lems. Dils is a great passer. But
you have to fear the bomb
every week. Let 'em catch the
short ones and then tackle
'em," he said.
Margerum is a little hesitant
about the bomb. "It's really
hard to say, because Smith
plays so deep, unless we go
underneath him so he has to
come up. Then when Coach
Walsh picks the right time,
bang," he said.
Tyler agrees but in a different
way. "We're definitely going to
throw deep. They play a cover
age that is conducive to throw
ing the bomb. We will throw
deep but in a different form,"
he said.
As for his habit of eating

quarterbacks, coach Robinson
said, "Dennis has unlimited
potential. His size, speed and
great leaping ability give him
great range as a safety man, but
perhaps his greatest quality is
his ability to hit. If a quarter
back takes off and runs, he'll
come up and wallop him."
But Smith say§ it's not just
quarterbacks, but "whoever's
running the ball. I expect Nel
son to be rushing a lot, catch
ing some passes. I'll be meet
ing up with Darrin."
What does Steve Dils think

of all this? "If I'm running the
ball at all I'll generally be
scrambling or getting rid of it,"
Dils laughed.
When told about Smith's
four interceptions, Dils shrug
ged and waved his hand.
"Aaah, that's nothing," Dils
said.
One can only hope it's no
thing. With Dennis Smith in
the secondary, Dils will have to
beat his best. Otherwise, it will
be a long afternoon.
If the Stanford backfield ex
pects to go anywhere on
Saturday they had better be
ware of Dennis Smith
6-foot-3, 200-pounds and a
high jump champion. He leads
the USC team in interceptions.
Apparently he likes to eat quar
terbacks. And running backs.
And wide receivers. His team
mates call him Kojak.
Smith is an excellent athlete
according to Ken Margerum
and Andre Tyler, both of whom
remember him from their high
school days. "He's a great
athlete. He's real big and
strong," Margerum said. "He's
really an exceptional athlete,"
Tyler agreed.
How exceptional? Well, last
year coach John Robinson ex
cused him from two days of
spring practice and sent him
over to the track team. He
worked out a couple of times,

and then cleared seven feet in
the high jump to take second in
the USC-UCLA meet. He did it
again to take third in the Pac-8
championships.
Smith is a sophomore, re
placing graduated All-
American Dennis Thurman. As
a freshman he played a total of
55 minutes, rrjade half a dozen
tackles, and intercepted two
passes against TCU, returning
one for 13 yards. This year he
has a team-leading total of four
interceptions.
He graduated from the same
high school as his predecessor
Thurman, Santa Monica.
He didn't do too badly there
either. He was named 1976
CIF 4A (large schools) Co-
Player of the Year.
He made the Coach and
Athlete, Scholastic Coach and
Joe Namath Magazine All-
American teams, playing both
defensive back and wide re

ceiver.
As a senior he caught 33 pas
ses for 777 yards, with a 23.5
average. But he only had three
interceptions. Know why? Op
posing teams refused to throw
in his area.
However, the Stanford
backfield doesn't seem overly
concerned about Smith, even
though he has an advantage in
size.
According to Andre Tyler,
he's not as fast as he could be.
"It's going to be a tough task,
but he isn't real fast as far as
foot speed. He covers a lot of
ground, but I think I can beat
him."
Kenny Margerum has some
reservations, but he too is not
overly concerned. "I'm a little
apprehensive. He's a great
athlete.
"He's big and strong, but
he's not all that fast. I'm faster

range. We just have to split the
zones and get out of his range.

this," Margerum said.
As for Smith himself, the

at all. "Margerum's fast, but all
the team's we've played so far
have had something as far as

One might wonder if Smith
suffers from any lack of experi
ence being a sophomore. "At
first maybe, but it seems like I
improved every game. I feel
pretty comfortable right now,"
he said.
Tyler and Margerum both
agree, seeing as how they're
both sophomores, also. "Ear
lier in the season it might have
made a difference. But right
now it should be pretty even,"
Tyler said.
