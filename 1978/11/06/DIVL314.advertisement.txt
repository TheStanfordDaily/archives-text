Palo Alto Tenants!
Your landlord wants you to
vote against yourself November 7
Measure H on the Palo Alto ballot would give each tenant his or her pro-rated
share of the landlord's property tax savings from Proposition 13. If Measure H passes,
your monthly rent in 1979 will be about 10% less than it was last June 6.
Homeowners are receiving the benefits of Proposition 13 tax reductions. Renters
should receive the same benefits, because their rents are used to pay landlords'
property taxes.
Measure H permits landlords to increase rents for net increases in costs and to
maintain just and reasonable rates of return. But it also requires landlords to docu
ment the need for rent increases, so that landlords do not use unjustified rent
increases to recover the tax savings they are required to give to renters.
Palo Alto landlords admit raising $50,000 to defeat Measure H. Landlords
throughout the state are raising $350,000 for television and radio ads to distort the
facts about Measure H.
These landlords have taken thousands of dollars of your rent money to try to
convince you to vote against yourself.
But their best hope is that you won't vote at all. Take a walk to the voting booth
November 7 and Vote FOR Measure H.
