# Medicare deficits to blame
## Med School tuition may rise 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich told about 500 stu
dents Friday why three-quarter tuition may rise to almost
$6000 next year, why students would have to pay that
tuition for 13 mandatory quarters instead of 11 and why
new students would have to pay a one-time fee of $1500
in addition to their tuition.
But the only reason which students accepted, judging
from their loud applause, was the one proposed by
fourth-year student Martin Cherniack — "serious mis
management in the Medical School administration."
The major reason for the sharp increase in student
tuition, according to Rich, stems from a possible $2.3
million loss in Medicare payments made to the clinics.
Slightly less than half of these funds are normally trans
ferred to the medical school. Because of the loss, this
year's budget is expected to show an estimated $875,000
deficit. Although the deficit can be recovered from re
serves this year, other steps must be taken to recover
losses in future years, Rich-said.
The University will learn the exact deficit later this
month when it submits its claim to Medicare. Under a

new ruling made by the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, professional fees of salaried faculty
physicians that are turned over to the Medical School to
support operations mi/st be deducted from Medicare
claims.
Not definite
Rich said the tuition hikes are not definite, and added
that the Faculty Senate, Board of Trustees and other
officials must work out the plan so it does not conflict
with President Jimmy Carter's price control program.
"The government won't want to do business with the
people who don't follow the president's guidelines," he
said, adding that the Medical School receives a consider
able amount of funding from federal grants.
Under the new plan, developed by an advisory com
mittee on tuition policy and recently approved by the
Executive Committee, each student would be required
to pay for 13 quarters of tuition in order to get an M.D.
degree, but could then take classes for five quarters,
free of tuition.
"That is to make it possible for students to take full
advantage of the elective curriculum and to shape their
education at Stanford in response to scholarly objectives
rather than being constrained because of the cost of
tuition," Rich stated in an October memo to the Faculty
Senate and Executive Committee.
Suit possible
But because Rich is suggesting the mandatory 13 quar
ters for students currently matriculated as well as for
incoming students, he was told by one audience
member Friday of the possibilities of a class action suit.
"The catalogs, which say students have to take a man
datory 11 quarters, are implied contracts," one student
said. "All the students could file a class suit for
breach of contract."
Students also objected to the proposed $1500 one
time fee for incoming students and the corresponding
$500 one-time charge for those currently enrolled.
Minorities deterred
"I'm wondering who's even going to consider coming
here at that price," one student said. Others said they
believed the cost increase would deter minorities from
enrolling.
"Stanford seems to love and want minorities, yet first
you change the minority admissions to something the
minorities don't approve of and then you increase the
amount of tuition," said Cory Anderson, a minority stu
dent.
Other students protested the tuition hike when
Michael Cowan, an administrative assistant in the Office
of Student Affairs, said no more scholarships would be
made available even after the increase.
"The loan resources would increase, but so would the
interest rate," Cowan said. "It would be the middle
income families who would have the hardest time."

mittee on tuition policy and recently approved by the
Executive Committee, each student would be required
to pay for 13 quarters of tuition in order to get an M.D.
degree, but could then take classes for five quarters,
free of tuition.
"That is to make it possible for students to take full
advantage of the elective curriculum and to shape their
education at Stanford in response to scholarly objectives
rather than being constrained because of the cost of
tuition," Rich stated in an October memo to the Faculty
Senate and Executive Committee.
Suit possible
But because Rich is suggesting the mandatory 13 quar
ters for students currently matriculated as well as for
incoming students, he was told by one audience
member Friday of the possibilities of a class action suit.
"The catalogs, which say students have to take a man
datory 11 quarters, are implied contracts," one student
said. "All the students could file a class suit for
breach of contract."
Students also objected to the proposed $1500 one
time fee for incoming students and the corresponding
$500 one-time charge for those currently enrolled.
Minorities deterred
"I'm wondering who's even going to consider coming
here at that price," one student said. Others said they
believed the cost increase would deter minorities from
enrolling.
"Stanford seems to love and want minorities, yet first
you change the minority admissions to something the
minorities don't approve of and then you increase the
amount of tuition," said Cory Anderson, a minority stu
dent.
Other students protested the tuition hike when
Michael Cowan, an administrative assistant in the Office
of Student Affairs, said no more scholarships would be
made available even after the increase.
"The loan resources would increase, but so would the
interest rate," Cowan said. "It would be the middle
income families who would have the hardest time."

San Jose to be fro/en and prevent molding. It could cost $1
million to restore the books to original condition.

Close to 3900 boxes of books were loaded onto donated
trucks yesterday in front of Meyer Library to be shipped to
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich told about 500 stu
dents Friday why three-quarter tuition may rise to almost
$6000 next year, why students would have to pay that
tuition for 13 mandatory quarters instead of 11 and why
new students would have to pay a one-time fee of $1500
in addition to their tuition.
But the only reason which students accepted, judging
from their loud applause, was the one proposed by
fourth-year student Martin Cherniack — "serious mis
management in the Medical School administration."
The major reason for the sharp increase in student
tuition, according to Rich, stems from a possible $2.3
million loss in Medicare payments made to the clinics.
Slightly less than half of these funds are normally trans
ferred to the medical school. Because of the loss, this
year's budget is expected to show an estimated $875,000
deficit. Although the deficit can be recovered from re
serves this year, other steps must be taken to recover
losses in future years, Rich-said.
The University will learn the exact deficit later this
month when it submits its claim to Medicare. Under a

new ruling made by the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, professional fees of salaried faculty
physicians that are turned over to the Medical School to
support operations mi/st be deducted from Medicare
claims.
Not definite
Rich said the tuition hikes are not definite, and added
that the Faculty Senate, Board of Trustees and other
officials must work out the plan so it does not conflict
with President Jimmy Carter's price control program.
"The government won't want to do business with the
people who don't follow the president's guidelines," he
said, adding that the Medical School receives a consider
able amount of funding from federal grants.
Under the new plan, developed by an advisory com
mittee on tuition policy and recently approved by the

to pay for 13 quarters of tuition in order to get an M.D.
degree, but could then take classes for five quarters,
free of tuition.
