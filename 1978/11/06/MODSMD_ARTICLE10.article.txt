## 'National origin' needs definition 
### 
Does "national origin" mean place of
birth, cultural heritage, citizenship or
some combination of the three? This ques
tion has been put before the Faculty Se
nate Committee on Research, and in the
past three meetings (including two special
summer sessions and one open forum)
much debate has been heard. The defini
tion of "national origin" is not only of
academic or semantic interest. The in
terpretation of this phrase could have a
wide effect on the type of research which
is done at the University an could even
determine whether or not some students
would be allowed to work on particular
research projects. While there has been
much discussion on this question, little
has been heard from students. The pur
pose of this article is to call attention to the
fact that a substantial element of the Uni
versity's foreign contracts policy is being
formed almost devoid of any student dis
cussion or debate.
The University obviously does not have
the funds available to finance every re
search project. In order to alleviate this
problem, the University encourages inves
tigators to solicit funds from outside
sources, including foreign governments.
The University generally maintains a
"hands-off" policy towards these foreign
contracts, not wanting to be put in the
position of regulating what kinds of re
search projects are to be allowed.
Although the funding derived from
these foreign contracts is small (only
about seven percent of the University's
total research budget), it comprises the
entire research budget for certain depart
ments.
The University currently maintains a set
of guidelines which outline its contract re
quirements. It is the "non-discrimination"
clause reqiiired for all foreign contracts by
these guidelines which requires clarifica

tion. The clause is presently written as fol
lows:
Stanford agrees that it will not discriminate
against any employees or applicant for
employment because of race, color, relig
ion, sex or national origin. (The foreign
institution) agrees that it will not discrimi
nate against any employee because of
race, color, religion, sex or national ori
gin.
If "national origin" means place of birth
and/or ancestry and not citizenship, then
the University is in effect signing a contract
which says that the foreign country has the
right to refuse a student access to a project
on the basis of his or her citizenship alone.
This could mean that the student would
not be allowed to go into the sponsoring
nation in order to do field work. This defin
ition could also be interpreted so as to
require that students of specified
nationalities would not be allowed to work
in particular research programs while
here.
Another approach would be to define
"national origin" so as to include citizen
ship. In this event, citizenship could not
be used as a criteria in selecting University
employees. Students could not only work
on foreign contracts while here at the Uni
versity, but they would also be allowed
into the sponsoring country in order to do
any necessary field work, regardless of
their citizenship.
The problem with this second approach
is that almost all nations have some restric
tions on who can and who cannot enter
their country â€” almost always including
restrictions based on citizenship alone.
The University would in effect be requir
ing that nations suspend their own foreign
policies in regards to University students if
they wish to sign a contract with the Uni
versity. The most likely result of this policy
would be that many governments will re

fuse to sign contracts with the University
and a fair amount of research money will
be lost.
Another possibility would be to divide
the clause so that for any research oppor
tunity here on campus selection could not
be based on race, color, religion, sex,
birthplace, cultural heritage or citizen
ship. But if the research required data col
lection or other work in the sponsoring
country, then that country could enforce
its entry limitation laws as it deems ap
propriate.
At stake are several issues. On one
hand, there is the feeling that all Stanford
students should have the right to apply for
any research positions available here at
the University without consideration of
their citizenship. On the other hand, there
is the right of professors to seek support
for their research unhindered by any Uni
versity requirement save the demand for
educational and scholarly merit. As well,
there is the question as to whether or not
the University can or should attempt to
change the foreign policies of other na
tions in regards to this issue. The other
side of this argument is that Stanford
should not allow other countries to dictate
the University's policies on filling research
positions.
These questions are not easy ones. It
would be greatly beneficial to the student
members of the Committee on Research
to receive some student input on this is
sue. We've only a week or two before the
committee will once again be meeting to
discuss this question, possibly for the last
time. Anyone who would like to share
their opinions and insights on this prob
lem are strongly encouraged to do so. You
can leave any notes or messages for us
with the ASSU office.
