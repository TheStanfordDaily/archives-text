Mascot issue
overblown
Most of us would probably
agree that a school's mascot is
not ultimately important.
Nevertheless, certain people
continue to make an over
blown issue out of it. Uli Haller
(Daily, Oct. 23) displays such
tendencies in asking us to hide
our feathers at football games.
I'm sure the majority of
students would agree with Hal
ler's resolve against the Indian
as our mascot. But I suspect
that a good percentage of
those wearing feathers this
year sincerely believe they're
supporting the Cardinal (I
know, it's the color, not the
bird). Why disillusion them by
resurrecting the Indian issue?
Haller and others have mis
sed the crucial point in this
whole mascot problem. The
only real purpose the mascot
serves is as a symbol of unity;
one that everyone can support,
enjoy and perhaps feel proud
if. No reasonable student
would argue that the Cardinal
(or the Indian) succeeds on
these counts. For that matter,
none of the suggestions I have
heard in the last four years
have come close, with the sin
gular exception of the Tree.
But the Tree has failed too. In
its present form, it is too open
to criticism from other schools
as well as from alumni. At this
point, an analogy to the Leland
Stanford Jr. University March
ing Band seems enlightening.
How did we create a marching
band that is truly incompara
ble?
First, by making it a non
marching band. It avoids at
tempting the idiocies per
formed by other bands, and
thus is above comparison. In
fact, the band attempts the an
tithesis of such inanities — and
succeeds. Their show on
apathy was one such master
piece. I simply submit that our
search for a mascot should re
ally be a search for its an

tithesis, for it is in that quality
that its incomparability will in
here.
Again, it is not because I at
tach great importance to this
mascot problem that I'm
speaking out, but because I
knowthat alumni, otherPac-10
schools, radio announcers,
and some of our mothers do.
But Stanford should not fol
low the rest of the league by
pretending we have a mascot
worthy of praise — we don't.
Instead, we should destroy the
conceptual blocks surround
ing mascots as we did to those
surrounding marching bands.
As our band's goal is to "get
happy," our mascot should be
similarly inspiring.

"Yes" urged on
Measure H
Thank you for your coverage
of the debate on Measure H,
the Palo Alto rent relief initia
tive (Daily, Oct. 31).
I would like to remind Palo
Alto voters of the central issue
that is addressed by Measure
H. That is the issue of tax equity
for landlords and renters.
Whether or not Measure H
passes, all homeowners will
keep 100 percent of their sav
ings from Proposition 13 on
their homes. Therefore, land
lords will keep 100 percent of
their tax savings from Prop. 13
on their homes as well as on all
property that they own outside
of Palo Alto. Most landlords in
tend to keep all their Prop. 13
tax savings on their rental
properties for themselves in
stead of returning them to their
tenants.
Renters also have homes and
pay state taxes. In addition, re
nters pay their landlords'
property taxes in the form of
rent payments. But renters re
ceive no Prop. 13 tax savings on
their homes.
Measure H would require

that landlords pass through
their Prop. 13 tax savings to
their tenants.
I urge Palo Alto voters to vote
"Yes" on Measure H.

Daily editorial
on 'H' stinks
Only at Stanford would the
student newspaper frantically
flee logic to help the proper
tied exploit the others. Your
Nov. 3 editorial says that Mea
sure H "provides temporary
rent relief." Then you con
clude that "while the need for
rent relief is acknowledged,
long-term rent control is not
the answer." Great. But how
can that possibly add up to a
"No" vote? We should vote
down what's precisely right
because it "could possibly"
later be voted into something
wrong?
So when landlords want to
make improvements to in
crease the value of their prop
erty, they may have to use
money "from their own poc-
before taking it back
from their tenants. Oh no!
I've lived in the same apart
ment for almost three years
with only emergency mainte
nance. Last month my rent shot
up another $40 a month. What
am I, or poorer people in my
position, supposed to do? Wait
for some future measure that is
magically more temporary than
temporary? The cuts in services
from Prop. 13 (daycare, for
example) hit our lowest
income citizens the hardest.
The Daily, biting its nails over
property values, is willing to
see them hit again.
As a logical argument, as a
service to your community, as
simple justice, your "No on
'H' " editorial stinks.

Refuting the
Spec-Myth
I would like to reply to the
article that appeared in the
Sounds insert {Daily, Oct. 24),
called "A Guide to Those
Stereo Numbers — The
Specs." I suppose that my
proper attitude should be one
of indifference, but when I
think of all the people spend
ing time and money on stereos
and getting good specs instead
of good sound, I feel I have to
reply to the Spec-Myth.
The only way to decide bet
ween two stereo components
is to play a few minutes of
music through one of them,
then play the same music
through the other one. Listen
for details like the number of
voices or instruments or
whether the louder instru
ments drown out the softer
ones. Listen to hear if the in
struments sound anything like
the real thing. And listen for
placement of the instruments
in all three dimensions, prefer
ably on a good classical record
ing. Any good stereo store
(such as Avant-Garde in
Saratoga, or Music and Sound
in L.A., or even The Audible
Difference in Palo Alto) will al
most never quote specs, ex
cept on occasional power rat
ing of an amplifier.
The spec followers might be
interested in the fact that the
Audio Research D-150
amplifier, which has lousy specs
(.5 percent THD, .5 percent IM,
slow rise time, damping factor
of 11), had the best sound of
any power amplifier available
in 1975.
I am not against measure
ments. There are some very

smart people devoting a lot of
time to finding specifications
that correlate with the sonic
performance of a piece of
audio equipment. The few that
have been found tend to be
more sophisticated than the
high pressure salespeople who
push good specs would have
us believe.
Buying a stereo is difficult
because each part contributes
some coloration to the final
sound. I would say the car
tridge and the speaker are the
most crucial, but the elec
tronics, the tonearm and the
platter are not far behind in
their influence. The answer is
more complicated than
Sounds would have us believe.

Concern shared
over minority
admissions
Henry Organ's editorial in
the Oct. 24 Daily, brings up all
the key issues surrounding the
dissolution of the Minority
Admissions Committee at
Stanford Medical School. I
share his concern for the con
tinued existence of a student
body representative of all the
peoples of this country.
I belief, as does Organ,
that in a few short years Stan
ford Medical School will be as
"bleak and colorless" as it was
prior to the inception of the
Minority Admissions Commit
tee in 1969. I am further dis
couraged by the dismissal of
the Minority Admissions
Coordinator — a. person whose

specialized talents could have
contributed greatly to this year
of transition.
At best I would say that the
decision reached by the Medi
cal School Faculty Senate is a
trade-off. It jeopardizes a suc
cessful minority admissions
program in an attempt to de
crease the role minority re
viewers play in evaluating
black, Chicano and native
American applicants. At worst,
the decision is reactionary, a
vote of no confidence in the
abilities of minority medical
students and the Committee
which selected them.
Organ observed quite ap
propriately that the Supreme

Court's splintered judgment
on the Bakke case allows edu
cational institutions to do what
they want with their minority
admissions programs. It is now
all too obvious where the Uni
versity's heart lies in this mat
ter.
I can only add one further
note of pessimism: I sense that
the University is systematically
abandoning its professed
commitment to the presence
of minorities at all levels of its
structure. I see nothing to indi
cate otherwise and cannot in
telligently expect to.
