## 
### 
Oakland (AP) — An Oak
land widow who lost her
hearing tour years ago is the
first deaf person in Califor
nia to "hear" through the
ears of a specially trained
dog.
Carolyn Roach, 51, will be
accompanied by Mandy, an
18-month-old Sheltie mix
trained by the San Francisco
Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.
Mandy is the first
"hearing-ear" dog in the
state. She will alert her mis
tress if there is a door
knock, a phone call or a
smoke alarm sound and can
probably identify and react

to other sounds.
Ralph Dennard, Mandy's
trainer at the SPCA, said the
idea for a hearing ear dog
originated when people
noticed that seeing eye
dogs responded to sounds
and alerted their own own
ers.
"The dog will hear a
sound and makea judgment
that it is something his
ownershould knowabout,"
Dennard said at a press con
ference this week.
The American Humane
Society initiated a hearing
dog program in Denver two
years ago which has placed
about 60 dogs.
