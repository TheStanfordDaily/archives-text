# Committee plan bicycle safety campaign
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
The scene is all too common. Two
bicyclists traveling in opposite direc
tions cross up on their signals and, be
fore either knows what happened, their
bikes become entangled and both are
sprawled on the ground.
Usually, the mishap ends in mum
bled apologies and quick smiles. The
cyclists are soon on their way.
But, the accidents can and have been
more serious.
Due to growing concern over the is
sue, a special Bicycle Safety Committee
was formed this year. Kevin Karplus, a
graduate student in computer science,
was named chairman Thursday follow
ing a meeting of the committee at En
cina Hall.

Robert Beth, director of insurance
risk and management here, had led the
committee until a permanent chairman
was selected.
Eour E's
The main focus of the meeting was
the "Four E's" safety campaign which
the committee began earlier this year.
The E's stand for education, equip
ment, engineering and enforcement.
Some steps have already been taken
in the campaign, such as designating a
separate parking area for bicycles in
front of Meyer library to prohibit them
from blocking the entrance.
The committee also debated separat
ing bicycle traffic into two directions in
front of Meyer and in White Plaza,
probably by painting lines along the
concrete pathways or posting signs.
The idea has met with strong opposi
tion, according to Beth. "There is
strong concern about maintaining the
aesthetic value," he said. "There has
been a lot of complaint about the visual
effect."
Hazardous intersection
Similar proposals are also being
drawn up for the intersection of Cam
pus Drive and Serra Street, another
hazardous area. The plans will be ready
by Nov. 10, according to Stephen
Schmidt, of the Department of Facilities
Planning and Construction.
Other items covered at the meeting
included enforcing current bicycle
laws, repainting posts used to block off
streets in a brighter color, surveying

students to determine more specific
bike safety complaints, and planning
another educational Bike Fair in
January, similar to the one held Oct. 12
and 13 in White Plaza. The fair was co
-4 sponsored by the committee and Alpha
Phi Omega service fraternity.
Stricter enforcement of existing bicy
cle registration and traffic laws has
been a main concern, in conjunction
with greater emphasis on using safety
equipment such as reflectors and lights
for night cycling.
Issuing citations
Instead of issuing a large number of
bicycle citations on specified days,
campus police are now issuing citations
on a continuing basis at random loca
tions and times. Police are cracking
down on those cyclists with no safety
lights or who exercise "flagrant disre
gard fortraffic violations," according to
Beth.
"Enforcement is key," he stressed.
Carl Gielitz, detective for the De
partment of Public Safety and commit
tee member, emphasized that under
California law, bicycles are subject to
the same regulations as automobiles,
so the citations should be taken seri
ously.
Bicycle violations are registered on
an individual's traffic record, which in
volves not only a fine, but might also
affect a driver's insurance rates, he
explained.
Beth said there has also been an in
crease in the number of law suits which

students are bringing against each
other as the result of bike accidents.
Suits have involved pedestrians bring
ing claims against cyclists in addition to
cyclists suing each other, he said.
Accident reports
Since January 1977, 81 percent of the
137 student accidents reported to the
Department of Public Safety have been
bike accidents, Beth stated. Four of the
accidents have been considered seri
ous, requiring hospitalization.
In 1973, a freshman here was killed in
a late-night head-on collision between
two bikes. Neither 10-speed bicycle
was equipped with lights. Spokesmen
for the Bicycle Institute of America in
New York City said then that a fatal ac
cident between two bicyclists was "a
tremendous rarity," and could not re
call any recent incidents of that kind.
Beth also said "the majority of acci
dents aren't ever reported. Usually
someone hits an object, or two people
crash, and they just go home with a
bent-up wheel or some bruises. But we
never hear about it."
Part of the problem has evolved from
adoption of a stricter fee and parking
system for automobiles, Beth said. Stu
dents are increasingly preferring bikes
to cars for campus transportation, caus
ing hazardous bicycle congestion.
But Beth said he is optimistic because
he now sees a slight turnaround from a
safety situation which had been getting
successively worse for the past three
years.
