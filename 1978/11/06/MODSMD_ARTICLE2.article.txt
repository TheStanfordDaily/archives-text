In a report presented in
Washington, D.C., Oct. 25, a com
mittee headed by Stanford Medical
School Prof. Oleg lardetzky said that
the United States needs to spend an
nually ''$70 million to $100 million on
scientific instruments and their
maintainance" to prevent the United
States from falling behind other
countries in scientific research.
lardetzky was the head of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Instrumentation
Funding, formed by the directors of
major universities that make their
facilities available to researchers
throughout the nation. The report
was made to Frank Press, the direc
tor of the federal Office of Science
and Technology, and other high
ranking government officials.
lardetzky said that a lack of ad
vanced technological instrumenta
tion affects all fields of technology.
He included as advanced instru
ments devices such as electron mic
roscopes, spectrometers and lasers,
which can cost $100,000 each.
The study on instrumentation
funding was made after the National
Science Foundation gave $4 million

for research and it attracted $600 mill
ion worth of research proposals.
The National Institute of Health
gives $13 million in grants to science
researchers. This sum has remained
constant for the past 11 years.
Jardetzky said that if there is no
increase in funds there will be a con
tinual decline in U.S. technological
capability. The "surge of instrument
development in the last 15 years"
means that there must be constant
updating of equipment, he added.
lardetzky said that if the United
States falls behind in research, there
are many European countries such as
West Germany, Holland, Denmark
and Switzerland which will overtake
the United States. Switzerland and
Holland already spend more dollars
per capita on research than the Un
ited States, and Russia has increased
considerably its funding of research
during the last five to 10 years.
If the United States does fall be
hind in technical capability, lar
detzky said that as a result, more
basic discoveries will be made ab
road. This would have an economic
effect because U.S. industry would
have to purchase the patented dis

coveries.
lardetzky said that "Many young
people are not now being properly
trained because many universities
have no access to first-rate modern
instruments."
Although he said it is not an acute
problem here, he did point out that,
for example, the University here has
no high voltage electron microscope
and the nearest available one is at the
University of Colorado.
If no more money is made availa
ble, the shortage of scientific instru
ments could be eased by rebudget
ing existing funds, he said, lardetzky
added that this would mean reducing
the grants for instruments for indi
vidual laboratories and concentrat
ing funds on regional facilities which
could be shared. The University's
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility,
forexample, is a national facility, and
research proposals are submitted
and time is allocated to use the in
struments.
lardetzky said his report was favor
ably received. He added that Con
gress must now be convinced of the
need to allocate more money for
purchasing scientific instruments.
