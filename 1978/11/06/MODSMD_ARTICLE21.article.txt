# USC stymies Stanford, 13-7
## Deception fails as Troy walls in Cardinal offense snorts 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Trojans are not the easy
marks they once were. While
the ruse of a wooden horse
may have allowed the Greeks
to conquer Troy 3200 years
ago, Stanford efforts at duping
the Trojans backfired Saturday
and left the Cardinals on the
short end of a 13-7 score.
Ahead 7-0 and driving for
another TD late in the first quar
ter, Stanford lined up on the
USC 10 and sent running back
Darrin Nelson around the left
end on an apparent sweep.
Nelson, however, pulled up
short of the line of scrimmage
and threw a left-handed wob
bler into the end zone. The
pass, Nelson's first in two sea
sons, bounced out of tight end
Marty Smith's hands and into
the awaiting mitts of rover
Ronnie Lott.
"It almost worked," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said. "On
those type of plays, we're
acknowledged as successful
coaches when they work.
When they don't, we're asked
why we called them. We we
ren't going to run the ball in
against them with the injury to
Phil Francis (which prevented
the senior fullback from even
suiting up for the game). I wish
we hadn't done it."
Up to that point the Cards
had driven with relative impun
ity through the Trojan de
fense, amassing 142 yards in
the first period.
On the opening possession,
Stanford drove 75 yards with
Steve Dils completing six of
eight passes, the last one a 13-
yard strike to Ken Margerum.
Margerum ended the game
with seven catches for 113
yards.
But in the next two periods
the Trojans had little trouble
with the Stanford offense,
holding the nation's No. 3 at
tack to 54 yards, including minus
7 yards in the third period.
The Trojans, meanwhile, led
by its relentless running game,
(i.e. Charles White) began to
dominate control of the ball,
maintaining possession of it for
29 minutes, 42 seconds in the
last three quarters.
White ran for 201 yards on 38
carries and scored the only 'SC
touchdown late in the second

quarter. And although the Tro
jans finished with 280 net rush
ing yards, it was a pass play
which allowed them to score
the go-ahead touchdown just
before intermission.
Trailing 7-3 with 1:10 remain
ing in the half, USC quarter
back Paul McDonald heaved a
42-yard bomb to flanker Calvin
Sweeney which gave the Tro
jans the ball on the Stanford 6.
"The play was designed to
beat the free safety,"
McDonald said. "We sent both
backs to the weak side as we
had most of the afternoon.
"The free safety has a ten
dency to come up for the run
game. He hesitated for a sec
ond and left a big hole which
Calvin found."
White leaped over the goal
line one play later to give the
Trojans their one and winning
touchdown as they went into the
locker room ahead 10-7.
On the opening drive of the
second half, McDonald com
pleted three of three passes for
37 yards while driving the Tro
jans to the Stanford 21 where
Frank Jordan boomed a 38-yard
field goal.
Ineffective on offense, Stan
ford was fortunate to have its
punting game together.
Sophomore Ken Naber re
mained unflustered by a
10-man rush, punting eight
times for a 39.3 yard average.
While Stanford seemed to
punt the ball as soon as it got it,
the Trojans savored possession
as long as they could.
"We were trying to keep the
ball from them," White said,
reaching into his bag of
platitudes. "They can't put
points on the board when they
don't have the ball." And in the
second half, they couldn't put
them on the board when they
did have it.
"It's the lost opportunities
that are frustrating," Walsh
said. "We threw the bobbled
interception at the goal line
and had another bobbled in
terception on that one pass. I
give their defense credit, but
we're somehow snake-bit this
year with these things happen
ing to our team."
The second interception
came on a Steve Dils pass to
Andre Tyler which was inter

cepted by cornerback Larry
Braziel, snuffing out the first
Stanford drive of the final quar
ter.
"The long interception Steve
threw was an audible," Walsh
said. "Steve saw they were
blitzing and then called the
play. It was bobbled between
two players and their man got
it."
The Trojans took over and
began driving down field in an
effort to sew the game up.
McDonald, who completed 11
of 16 passes for 140 yards,
found Sweeney with a 22-yard
pass which moved USC into
Stanford territory. As it had all
day, the Stanford defense
tightened in its own half of the
field and when Jordan missed a
31-yard field goal, the Cards
still had a chance to get back on
top.
Two passes to Ken
Margerum for 33 yards and a
14-yard toss to tight end Pat
Bowe gave Stanford first down
the 'SC 35. Stanford tried some
more chicanery and paid a fear
ful toll.
Dils pitched to Nelson who
swept around the right end be
fore pitching back to Dils who
was supposed to pass to
Margerum. Margerum, how
ever, lined up in the wrong
formation and Dils was
dumped for a 10-yard loss. Dils
came back with a flat pass to
Gordon Banks who picked up
18 yards. With third-and-2, Dils
dropped back to pass and
looked for Banks again, but all
he saw was 'SC linebacker Riki
Gray who sacked him for a
9-yard loss.
"I should probably have
thrown the ball away," Dils
said. "I thought about it at the
last second but it was too late."
On fourth-and-11, Dils
found tight end Marty Smith
open underneath the 'SC
coverage, but Smith was stop
ped two yards short of the first
down and the Trojans took the
ball over with 4:02 remaining.

The Trojans converted on suc
cessive third-down plays and
ran the clock out.
"As far as USC is concerned,
we have to say, 'Hurray for the
defense'," Robinson said.
"Stanford is one of the great
offensive teams in the coun
try — they frighten you from
the start to the finish. But our
defense has done a super job
holding them to just one
touchdown in two years."
"We were thinking all week
that we'd have to score a lot
because Stanford would put at
least three touchdowns on the
board," McDonald said.
"There was no way I'd have
thought 13 points would win
the game."
Stanford's defense played
extremely well despite the ab
sense of All-Coast linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, who did not
suit up. Left inside linebacker
Steve Budinger led the stalwart
defensive effort with 23 tack
les.
The Stanford offense, mis
sing Francis, did not play as
well.
"We dropped a number of
passes today,"Walsh said. "It's
the first game we've had since
I've been here at Stanford
where we dropped so many
passes. They were right on the
money."
Dils completed 23 of 38 pas
ses f0r236 yards to break a con
ference record shared by Guy
Benjamin and lack Thompson
for most completions in one
season. Dils has completed 217
passes; the old record being
208.
The Stanford running game,
minus Francis, was nearly
nonexistent. The Cards rushed
for 37 yards on 26 carries.
But the frustrating numbers
again were the ones on the
scoreboard. The Cards, now
5-4 overall, 2-3 in Pac-10, have
lost to four top 20 teams by a
total of 16 points.

Charles White (top of picture) leaps over the Stanford defensive line from one-yard out for USC's only
touchdown Saturday. Surprisingly, it was the only TD the Trojans needed as they stopped Stanford,
13-7. White rushed for 201 yards on 38 carries for his most productive afternoon in a productive
collegiate career.
