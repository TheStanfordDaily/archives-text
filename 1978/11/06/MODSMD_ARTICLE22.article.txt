# Fatigue abets Card demise
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
In Saturday's game against USC, the most
imaginative offense and perfectly executed
defense could not have done the job for the
Cards without energy. And with a physical
team true to the tradition of the battling Tro
jans, Stanford was handed not only a loss, but
a battering as well.
Like a wave that crashes so many times
upon the shore, the Cards received a punish
ing that wore them down. At the end of the
game, there were some tired ball players that
disappointedly dragged themselves into the
locker room.
Coming onto the field with spirits that
could have toppled the wall of Troy in 10
minutes, Stanford scored on the opening
drive and held USC to within three points the
entire first half.
Unfortunately, Stanford was on the short
end of that three points and that's where they
stayed for the rest of the game, failing to put
another score on the board.
The opportunities were there, but the
connections failed to materialize and fatigue
may have been a factor.
"I wasn't nervous at the end of the second

quarter," said Card quarterback Steve Dils, "I
was tired. I threw some bad passes from
being leg-weary."
Head coach Bill Walsh agreed. "USC is a
tough physical team," he said. "Things hap
pen in a game like that."
"When we went out there, we wanted to
be able to say we played our hearts out," said
halfback John Pigott. "At the end of the third
quarter we were tired, but not less intense."
"Our mistakes hurt us in the second half.
They were a very physical team," said Steve
Budinger, echoing Walsh's appraisal of the
Trojans. "The defense was tired. We started
arm-tackling in the second half and they
gained yardage."
Tackle Chuck Evans agreed. "They were
big and physical. When the defense stays in
so long, you get naggy little injuries like sore
muscles and you don't execute as well."
Inevitably, they missed a few. But a certain
determination exists not to miss anymore.
"We've got to win the next two games,"
said Dils with determination," 'cause I'm not
going out of here with a 5-6 record.
