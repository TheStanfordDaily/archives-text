# Secure berth for nationals
## Card poloists drown USC, LBS 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
Aided by strong second and third quar
ter rallies, the Stanford water polo team
assured itself a berth in the NCAA champ
ionships by defeating USC Saturday, 10-5.
Friday, the Cardinals dealt a similar blow to
Long Beach State, winning 12-5.
The Trojans, who lost to California Fri
day, 7-1, now have three losses in Pacific
-10 play. The Cards, meanwhile, are unde
feated, so even if they were to lose both
upcoming games against Cal, theit result
ing second place finish in the conference
would qualify them for the national
championships, held over Thanksgiving
weekend in Long Beach's Belmont Plaza.
The first quarter of Saturday's game was
predictably a close one. USC, known for
their physical intensity, won the opening
sprint and played an emotionally-charged
first period. When the buzzer sounded,
the score was knotted at 1-1.
The second quarter, however, was all
Stanford. Or, more correctly, all Randy
Kalbus. The speedy junior from Long
Beach burned the Trojans for three goals
in the period — one on a fast-break and
two coming on man-up situations. The de
fensedid their part, holding USC scoreless
in the quarter.
"We expected 'SC to come out and be
very emotional and very physical in the
first quarter, and they were," said Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti.
"They waste their intensity," he con
tinued. "They go out and drive hard and
they think by just playing very hard,
they're going to win.
"They wear themselves out, more than
anything else," he added.

The Trojans made one more run at the
Cardinal lead when, in the third quarter,
they trailed 5-3 and found themselves in an
extra-man situation when Stanford's Tom
Angelo was ejected for committing a foul
during dead-time. The Cards' man-down
defense held tight, however, and at what
Dettamanti called the "turning point" of
the game, goalie John Cansel blocked the
USC shot and within the next minute and a
half, Stanford scored three goals to put the
game out of reach.
Two of the three game-preserving
goals came from the arm of senior captain
Robby Arnold, who finished the game with
three. Arnold now has scored 12 goals in
the last four games.
"He (Arnold) has had these streaks be
fore," said Dettamanti. "He always plays
better from about the m iddle of the season
on. He's more consistent this year."
Dettamanti stressed, as he has in the
past, that everyone on the team contri
buted.
"This team has that chemistry, that
blend of talents. Everybody contributes
theirown special ability," Dettamanti said.
Cansel demonstrated his special ability
Saturday, blocking nine Trojan shots.
"He (Cansel) had a good game," said
Dettamanti. "USC shoots the ball very
hard. He made some good blocks and he
controlled the ball well. His passing is tre
mendous — he really helps the fast
break."
Six of Stanford's 10 goals came on
man-up situations, and Dettamanti said
this aspect of the game is one at which the
Cards excel.

"In water polo, you've got to score on
man-up situations," he said. "You usually
get about six chances per game. We are
consistently scoring more than the other
teams on the extra-man."
Both Arnold and Kalhus scored two of
their three goals Saturday on man-up situ
ations. According to Dettamanti, USC was
"aware" of inside post men Jody Campbell
and Angelo and were sloughing on them.
This, said Dettamanti, opened it up for the
outside men — Arnold, Kalbus, Doug
Burke and freshman Chris Kelsey, who
scored two goals against the Trojans.
Defense was the key Friday against Long
Beach State. Like USC, the 49ers came out
fast in the first quarter, playing to a 2-2
score at the end of the period. The Cardi
nals shut down their opponents for the
next two quarters, however, limiting them
to a single goal while scoring nine of their
own. Five of these came in a shooting dis
play in the last four minutes of the second
quarter.
Besides Arnold's hat-trick, Angelo also
put three shots past the 49er goalie and
Kalbus added two more. Vince Vannelli,
starting in the goal for the second time this
year, recorded a steal and four saves.
Stanford's record now stands at 20-0-1
with four games left to go — two against
Cal, one against UC-Davis and one against
San Jose State. The Cards have not been
beaten in their last 31 games at deGuerre
pool.
According to Dettamanti, qualifying for
the NCAA championships constitutes the
first of two goals.
The second, of course, is winning it.
