### THEODORE HERHOLD 
The women's cross country
team, although not earning a
bid to the nationals, finished
seventh against tough compet
ition at the regional meet held
Saturday in Long Beach.
The Cards, who finished
third in the regionals last year
and won a trip to the nationals,
seemed pleased with the re
sults, however. "I'm com
pletely pleased and proud of
the team effort," said coach
Laurel Treon. "A seventh-place
finish in this year's event,
based on the improvement in
competition, is practically the
same as last year's third-place
finish." The competition has
grown from seven full teams

represented last year to 18 this
year.
"We knew we weren't going
to make it to the nationals,"
said Annette Mungai who
placed 57th with a time of
19:38.7. "This team wasn't any
worse than last year's, it's just
that the competition has got
ten so much better."
Ann Thrupp, Stanford's
two-time All-America, didn't
let the improved competition
faze her, finishing eighth out of
153 entrees. Thrupp ran the
10,000 meter course in a blister
ing 17:33.6, and will be Stan
ford's lone representative in
the nationals, to be held in De
nver, Colorado on November
18.

The three teams that did
qualify for the nationals were
California, Cal State-
Northridge and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. Cal, which
finished dead last in last year's
regionals won the team event
with 32 points. Five of the top
10 finishers were from Cal.
Also finishing ahead of Stan
ford were UCLA with 102
points, Hawaii with 188 and San
Diego State with 240. Stanford
did, however, beat out Cal
State-Long Beach (the host
team), Sacramento State and
Cal State-Hayward, teams
whom they hadn't beaten all
year.
Northridge's Julie Brown
won the race in a pace-setting

time of 17:02.8. Sue Kinsey,
also from Northridge finished
second and Cal Poly-SLO's
Maggie Keyes, who set a new
course record at the Stanford
Invitational, finished third.
Scoring for the Cards's be
hind Thrupp were Susan Brag
don, who finished 48th in a
time of 19:18.8; Annette Mun
gai, 57th (19:38.7); Joanne
Ernst, 66th (20:04.1) and Beth
Harrison, 70th (20:09.6).
"I think it's really great that it
(women's cross country) has
advanced so much over the
year," said Mungai, referring
to the increase in the number
of teams participating in this
year's regionals.

qualify for the nationals were
California, Cal State-
Northridge and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. Cal, which
finished dead last in last year's
regionals won the team event
with 32 points. Five of the top
10 finishers were from Cal.
Also finishing ahead of Stan
ford were UCLA with 102
points, Hawaii with 188 and San
Diego State with 240. Stanford
did, however, beat out Cal
State-Long Beach (the host
team), Sacramento State and
Cal State-Hayward, teams
whom they hadn't beaten all
year.
Northridge's Julie Brown
won the race in a pace-setting

time of 17:02.8. Sue Kinsey,
also from Northridge finished
second and Cal Poly-SLO's
Maggie Keyes, who set a new
course record at the Stanford
Invitational, finished third.
Scoring for the Cards's be
hind Thrupp were Susan Brag
don, who finished 48th in a
time of 19:18.8; Annette Mun
gai, 57th (19:38.7); Joanne
Ernst, 66th (20:04.1) and Beth
Harrison, 70th (20:09.6).
"I think it's really great that it
(women's cross country) has
advanced so much over the
year," said Mungai, referring
to the increase in the number
of teams participating in this
year's regionals.
The women's cross country
team, although not earning a
bid to the nationals, finished
seventh against tough compet
ition at the regional meet held
Saturday in Long Beach.
The Cards, who finished
third in the regionals last year
and won a trip to the nationals,
seemed pleased with the re
sults, however. "I'm com
pletely pleased and proud of
the team effort," said coach
Laurel Treon. "A seventh-place
finish in this year's event,
based on the improvement in
competition, is practically the
same as last year's third-place
finish." The competition has
grown from seven full teams

represented last year to 18 this
year.
"We knew we weren't going
to make it to the nationals,"
said Annette Mungai who
placed 57th with a time of
19:38.7. "This team wasn't any
worse than last year's, it's just
that the competition has got
ten so much better."
Ann Thrupp, Stanford's
two-time All-America, didn't
let the improved competition
faze her, finishing eighth out of
153 entrees. Thrupp ran the
10,000 meter course in a blister
ing 17:33.6, and will be Stan
ford's lone representative in
the nationals, to be held in De
nver, Colorado on November
18.

The three teams that did
qualify for the nationals were
California, Cal State-
Northridge and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. Cal, which
finished dead last in last year's
regionals won the team event
with 32 points. Five of the top
