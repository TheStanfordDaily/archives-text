# "One of thoses perfect games"
## Cards whitewash Cal, 3-0 
### DEAN EYRE 
Berkeley — Despite being
labelled as the match-up's
underdog, Stanford won
the soccer version of the
Big Came, upsetting the
Golden Bears 3-0 Saturday
afternoon at Edwards Field.
The Cardinals finished their
best "modern" soccer sea
son at 16-5, 3-3 in confer
ence.
Particularly outstanding
for the Cards was sopho
more "attacking midfiel
der" Dan McNevin, named
the Pepsi-Cola Player of the
Game for his ball handling,
defensive skills and offen
sive contributions (includ
ing the team's first goal).
The award was based on the
agreement of the two head
coaches.
As far as >he Stanford
team is concerned, the de
cisive victory is significant
in that it greatly improves
the Cards' chances for in
clusion in regional playoffs.

"I did very little to get this
team up except to tell them
'if you win today there's an
excellent chance of you
being considered for the
third or fourth spot (of the
four teams chosen from the
Far West region),' " said
head coach Nelson Lodge.
" 'Even though you've lost
to Santa Clara, they lost to
two teams that you've
beaten — San Francisco
State and Hayward — and
you've beaten the team they
tied — Fresno State," Lodge
elaborated. "And of course
Santa Clara lost to Berkeley
so what it's going to indicate
to the committee is that you
had an off day against Santa
Clara.'
" 'The only damaging
games I believe were the
UCLA and Los Angeles State
games. But I think we still
have to be considered at
this point," he added.
USF and San Jose State

have just about clinched the
first two spots, leaving the
remaining two places up for
grabs between Stanford,
Santa Clara, San Diego
State, UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara. A committee of
raters will decide the final
four teams to represent the
conferences in regional
competition Monday morn
ing.
Besides the playoff im
portance of the contest, the
Cal rivalry meant a lot to the
three graduating seniors
playing their final regular
season game for Stanford.
"We played a really good
game, the best we've had all
season — a very good solid
soccer game," said Paul
Kozachenko. "Since I've
been here we've never lost
to Berkeley, so it was impor
tant for that reason, and the
chance that we could get to
the regionals if we won, a
better chance if we won

badly. Plus, it's the final
game for the rest of my life
— I can look back and say
we won."
"I think without a doubt
we played one of the best
games that we've played all
year," said Mike Knowles.
"We came up against a team
that scorewise and skillwise
should've been superior,
but we beat them. We beat
them from deep down in
our hearts. We wanted it
more than they did. I saw
more hustle today than in
any other game of the sea
son.
"It's a fantastic way to go
out, especially beating Ber
keley so well," he added.
"As a senior I felt like I
had to go all out — it was my
last game," said Mark
Triska. "I was psychologi
cally prepared for the game
for three days — all I
thought of was one thing
and that was beating Cal.
"I felt the support of
everybody on the team. It
was my last game, so I just
had to give it all. There's
only one thing better in
life. . . ," he said.
The Cards took the lead
on a corner kick by Ted
Rafalovich headed into the
goal by McNevin 12 minutes
into the first half and Stan
ford never looked back.
Greg Delgado added the
second goal, seven minutes
into the last period. With 15
minutes left, the final scor
ing play was a pass to Peter
Phillips from Rafalovich.
The pass and Phillips' head
ball were a "picture play,"
according to Lodge. "I've
never seen anything like it.
"It was just one of those
perfect games — you liter
ally run over a strong Ber
keley team, one of the best
teams in the conference in
defense. I'm just pleased to
death with it," Lodge said.

we won."
"I think without a doubt
we played one of the best
games that we've played all
year," said Mike Knowles.
"We came up against a team
that scorewise and skillwise
should've been superior,
but we beat them. We beat
them from deep down in
our hearts. We wanted it
more than they did. I saw
more hustle today than in
any other game of the sea
son.
"It's a fantastic way to go
out, especially beating Ber
keley so well," he added.
"As a senior I felt like I
had to go all out — it was my
last game," said Mark
Triska. "I was psychologi
cally prepared for the game
for three days — all I
thought of was one thing
and that was beating Cal.
"I felt the support of
everybody on the team. It
was my last game, so I just
had to give it all. There's
only one thing better in
life. . . ," he said.
The Cards took the lead
on a corner kick by Ted
Rafalovich headed into the
goal by McNevin 12 minutes
into the first half and Stan
ford never looked back.
Greg Delgado added the
second goal, seven minutes
into the last period. With 15
minutes left, the final scor
ing play was a pass to Peter
Phillips from Rafalovich.
The pass and Phillips' head
ball were a "picture play,"
according to Lodge. "I've
never seen anything like it.
"It was just one of those
perfect games — you liter
ally run over a strong Ber
keley team, one of the best
teams in the conference in
defense. I'm just pleased to
death with it," Lodge said.

16-5, 3-3 in conference.
Berkeley — Despite being
labelled as the match-up's
underdog, Stanford won
the soccer version of the
Big Came, upsetting the
Golden Bears 3-0 Saturday
afternoon at Edwards Field.
The Cardinals finished their
best "modern" soccer sea
son at 16-5, 3-3 in confer

Particularly outstanding
for the Cards was sopho
more "attacking midfiel
der" Dan McNevin, named
the Pepsi-Cola Player of the
Game for his ball handling,
defensive skills and offen
sive contributions (includ
ing the team's first goal).
The award was based on the
agreement of the two head
coaches.
As far as >he Stanford
team is concerned, the de
cisive victory is significant
in that it greatly improves
the Cards' chances for in
clusion in regional playoffs.

"I did very little to get this
team up except to tell them
'if you win today there's an
excellent chance of you
being considered for the
third or fourth spot (of the
four teams chosen from the
Far West region),' " said
head coach Nelson Lodge.
" 'Even though you've lost
to Santa Clara, they lost to
two teams that you've
beaten — San Francisco
State and Hayward — and
you've beaten the team they
tied — Fresno State," Lodge
elaborated. "And of course
Santa Clara lost to Berkeley
so what it's going to indicate
to the committee is that you
had an off day against Santa
Clara.'
" 'The only damaging
games I believe were the
UCLA and Los Angeles State
games. But I think we still
have to be considered at
this point," he added.
USF and San Jose State

have just about clinched the
first two spots, leaving the
remaining two places up for
grabs between Stanford,
Santa Clara, San Diego
State, UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara. A committee of
raters will decide the final
four teams to represent the
conferences in regional
competition Monday morn
ing.
Besides the playoff im
portance of the contest, the
Cal rivalry meant a lot to the
three graduating seniors
playing their final regular
season game for Stanford.
"We played a really good
game, the best we've had all
season — a very good solid
soccer game," said Paul
Kozachenko. "Since I've
been here we've never lost
to Berkeley, so it was impor
tant for that reason, and the

the regionals if we won, a
better chance if we won

badly. Plus, it's the final
