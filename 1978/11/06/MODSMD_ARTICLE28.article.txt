# Despite outstanding Card play, spikers fail to place in tourney
## 
### JEFF POWELL 
"We played the best we have all year," said
Stanford volleyball coach Fred Sturm. Did the
Stanford women's volleyball team, to whom he
refers, capture the coveted UCLA Invitational
Tournament this past weekend? No. Runner-up
then? No, not that either. In fact, the spikers
didn't even advance past their own bracket to
move on to the resulting round of eight.
What's all the fuss about then? Well, the Cards
finished with a record of seven wins and three
losses in games and made believers of several
high-powered teams.
The Cardinals placed third within their pool.
(The two-day, 24-team invitational was divided
into four divisions of six teams apiece. The top
two teams in each bracket, after round-robin
play, advanced to the quarterfinals.)
Stanford's pool included Hawaii, Long Beach
State, UC-Riverside, Arizona State and the Uni
versity of Illinois-Chicago Circle. The Cards
whipped all their division foes except Hawaii
and Long Beach State. Stanford split with na
tionally No. 8 ranked Long Beach State 11-15,
15-5 and performed admirably against fifth
ranked Hawaii despite losing 8-15, 15-17.
After losing the first game to Hawaii in their
opening match, the spikers dropped a
heartbreaking second game 15-17 despite hold

ing a commanding 14-9 lead at one point. Al
though unknown at the f ime, the loss proved
costly for the Cards. Had they held on to edge
Hawaii, the Cards would have clinched a spot in
the final eight.
As it turned out, the spikers had to rely on
Hawaii to knock off Long Beach State in succes
sive games to advance. To the Cardinals' dis
may, Long Beach State, in a must-win situation,
rallied back to grab the first game, eliminating
the young Stanford squad.
If any consolation to the Cards, Hawaii won
the tourney by ousting third-ranked Pepperdine
in the final. Earlier, Pepperdine had trounced
pre-tourney favorite Utah State in the quarters.
The Cardinals don't need excessive consola
tion, however.
"The team has improved drastically over the
past six weeks," Sturm said, "capped off by a
remarkably sustained effort, both mentally and
physically, this past weekend. It's a shame that
we had to play the tougher teams early."
In the process, the Cards showed not only
that can they play competitively with Hawaii, but
that, according to Sturm, "Stanford is better
than Long Beach State" as well. The question,
now, however, is will the selection committee
for the regionals agree?

State, UC-Riverside, Arizona State and the Uni
versity of Illinois-Chicago Circle. The Cards
whipped all their division foes except Hawaii
and Long Beach State. Stanford split with na
tionally No. 8 ranked Long Beach State 11-15,
15-5 and performed admirably against fifth
ranked Hawaii despite losing 8-15, 15-17.
After losing the first game to Hawaii in their
opening match, the spikers dropped a
heartbreaking second game 15-17 despite hold

ing a commanding 14-9 lead at one point. Al
though unknown at the f ime, the loss proved
costly for the Cards. Had they held on to edge
Hawaii, the Cards would have clinched a spot in
the final eight.
As it turned out, the spikers had to rely on
Hawaii to knock off Long Beach State in succes
sive games to advance. To the Cardinals' dis
may, Long Beach State, in a must-win situation,
rallied back to grab the first game, eliminating
the young Stanford squad.
If any consolation to the Cards, Hawaii won
the tourney by ousting third-ranked Pepperdine
in the final. Earlier, Pepperdine had trounced
pre-tourney favorite Utah State in the quarters.
The Cardinals don't need excessive consola
tion, however.
"The team has improved drastically over the
past six weeks," Sturm said, "capped off by a
remarkably sustained effort, both mentally and
physically, this past weekend. It's a shame that
we had to play the tougher teams early."
In the process, the Cards showed not only
that can they play competitively with Hawaii, but
that, according to Sturm, "Stanford is better
than Long Beach State" as well. The question,
now, however, is will the selection committee
for the regionals agree?
