# Meyer library flooded; $1 million in damages
## 
### CRAIG DENNIS 
Roughly $1 million in book dam
ages in the Meyer Undergraduate
Library Basement resulted from an
early morning water main break
Saturday.
However, the exact location and
cause of that break remained in
doubt yesterday.
University Libraries Director David
Weber said between 35,000 and
40,000 volumes were "significantly
damaged" when water poured into
the library basement.
An eight-inch fire main on the
Green Library construction site ad
joining the Meyer Library basement
broke at 2:51 a.m., sounding an au
tomatic water pressure alarm. Plant
Services and local fire department
personnel had the water shut off by
3:15 a.m.
'No one knows'
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement and insurance for the Uni
versity, said, "No one knows for
sure" where the break took place.
Digging for the broken water line
should begin this morning when
Green Library construction crews re
turn to their regular Monday morn
ing shift, he said.
However, Beth said, "The contrac
tor cut holes through the basement
wall and should have placed tempor
ary plugs to prevent water from com
ing in." The prime contractor for the
$17 million addition to Green Library
is Dickman Construction, Inc. of
Mountain View.
Beth said the University will also be
hiring an outside consulting firm to
do a metallurgical study on the pipe
at its break to determine the exact
cause of the pipe rupture and to see
if the possibility of a pipe defect
exists.
Possible claim
"There is always the possibility of a
claim against the pipe manufac
turer," he said.
Water, mud and gravel entered the
basement on the B level through un
filled holes recently cut for utilities to
connect with the new library. Water
then poured down a stairway to the
bottom (A) level.
However, a large share of the dam
age was sustained when water drip
ped through a metal floor separating
the two levels and soaked the lower
level books. "That's what caused the
major damage," Weber said.
The collections damaged "may
have cost $10 million to create" in
today's dollars, Weber said. The
music, education, urban studies and
law sections were affected most.
Repair cost
Yesterday he said it was "prema
ture to say" what the exact cost of
repairing the books will be. "Now we
have to sit back and assess how much
it is going to cost."

Librarians said there was no way to
make a precise estimate of the loss.
When restoration proves necessary,
the Library of Congress has esti
mated the cost at up to $100 per vol
ume, the librarians said.
By noon Saturday, emergency ac
tion was taken to find freezer space
to put the damaged books into what
University Archivist Ralph Hansen
called a "suspended animation."
A 5000-square-foot commercial
freezer with a 20 degrees below zero
temperature reading was located at
Modern Ice and Cold Storage Com
pany in San Jose.
With donated trucks, drivers and
manpower from Peninsula Creamery
of Palo Alto, the first books were on
their way to San Jose late Saturday
afternoon.
Students, librarians and faculty
members joined in the massive
clean-up effort Saturday and yester
day. Twenty history graduate stu
dents banded togetherasavolunteer
team yesterday.
"These are the books I'm using.
These are dear to me," one said.
By last night, all the books were in
cold storage and had met the critical
48-hour deadline set by library offi
cials to prevent molding.
The books must be put into a
freeze-dried chamber to take the
moisture out before they can be re
turned to circulation. Weber said he
was "uncertain" whether it would be
a year or more until all materials are
treated.
Beth added that a large vacuum
chamber had been located at Loc
kheed Aircraft in Mountain View for
potential use.
Weber said it will take several
months, if not years, to repair or re
place the books, depending on the

size of staff used.
Also damaged in the flooding were
iOOO miniature books, some dating
to the 17th century. The miniatures,
called "tinys" by the library staff, are
not the rarest books owned by the
library, but are the smallest.
No major structural damage to the
Meyer building was noted. An au
tomatic pumping mechanism and
fire department personnel had water
out of the basement within hours of
the pipe break.
A University planning official said,
"We are really going to be looking at
the contractor and his insurance."
Weber termed the damage a
"scholarly loss as well." Whose
budget pays for replacing or restor
ing the books is "immaterial," he
said.
William Massy, University vice
president for business and finance,
told the librarians at an emergency
Saturday morning meeting that the
University will commit itself to cover
ing the bills.
"We have a duty to ourselves to
take care of everything im
mediately," he said.
The University is self-insured up to
$1 million and has commercial insur
ance for damages above that
amount.
The 40,000 damaged books were
part of the 500,000 book collection in
the basement stacks. The basement
levels will be closed until further
notice, Weber said, but "might be
open later this week."
A paging service for books remain
ing in the basement stacks will beput
into operation today, according to
library officials. Library users want
ing books from the basement stacks
are asked to request them at the
Green Library main desk.

Students, librarians and faculty
members joined in the massive
clean-up effort Saturday and yester
day. Twenty history graduate stu

"These are the books I'm using.
These are dear to me," one said.
By last night, all the books were in
cold storage and had met the critical
48-hour deadline set by library offi
cials to prevent molding.
The books must be put into a
freeze-dried chamber to take the
moisture out before they can be re
turned to circulation. Weber said he
was "uncertain" whether it would be
a year or more until all materials are
treated.
Beth added that a large vacuum
chamber had been located at Loc
kheed Aircraft in Mountain View for
potential use.
Weber said it will take several
months, if not years, to repair or re
place the books, depending on the

size of staff used.
Also damaged in the flooding were
iOOO miniature books, some dating
to the 17th century. The miniatures,
called "tinys" by the library staff, are
not the rarest books owned by the
library, but are the smallest.
No major structural damage to the
Meyer building was noted. An au
tomatic pumping mechanism and
fire department personnel had water
out of the basement within hours of
the pipe break.
A University planning official said,
"We are really going to be looking at
the contractor and his insurance."
Weber termed the damage a
"scholarly loss as well." Whose
budget pays for replacing or restor
ing the books is "immaterial," he
said.
William Massy, University vice
president for business and finance,
told the librarians at an emergency
Saturday morning meeting that the
University will commit itself to cover
ing the bills.
"We have a duty to ourselves to
take care of everything im
mediately," he said.
The University is self-insured up to
$1 million and has commercial insur
ance for damages above that
amount.
The 40,000 damaged books were
part of the 500,000 book collection in
the basement stacks. The basement
levels will be closed until further
notice, Weber said, but "might be
open later this week."
A paging service for books remain
ing in the basement stacks will beput
into operation today, according to
library officials. Library users want
ing books from the basement stacks
are asked to request them at the
Green Library main desk.

flood damage in the Meyer Library basement.
Roughly $1 million in book dam
ages in the Meyer Undergraduate
Library Basement resulted from an
early morning water main break
Saturday.
However, the exact location and
cause of that break remained in
doubt yesterday.
University Libraries Director David
Weber said between 35,000 and
40,000 volumes were "significantly
damaged" when water poured into
the library basement.
An eight-inch fire main on the
Green Library construction site ad
joining the Meyer Library basement
broke at 2:51 a.m., sounding an au
tomatic water pressure alarm. Plant
Services and local fire department
personnel had the water shut off by
3:15 a.m.
'No one knows'
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement and insurance for the Uni
versity, said, "No one knows for
sure" where the break took place.
Digging for the broken water line
should begin this morning when
Green Library construction crews re
turn to their regular Monday morn
ing shift, he said.
However, Beth said, "The contrac
tor cut holes through the basement
wall and should have placed tempor
ary plugs to prevent water from com
ing in." The prime contractor for the
$17 million addition to Green Library
is Dickman Construction, Inc. of
Mountain View.
Beth said the University will also be
hiring an outside consulting firm to
do a metallurgical study on the pipe
at its break to determine the exact
cause of the pipe rupture and to see
if the possibility of a pipe defect
exists.
Possible claim
"There is always the possibility of a
claim against the pipe manufac
turer," he said.
Water, mud and gravel entered the
basement on the B level through un
filled holes recently cut for utilities to
connect with the new library. Water
then poured down a stairway to the
bottom (A) level.
However, a large share of the dam
age was sustained when water drip
ped through a metal floor separating
the two levels and soaked the lower
level books. "That's what caused the
major damage," Weber said.
The collections damaged "may
have cost $10 million to create" in
today's dollars, Weber said. The
music, education, urban studies and
law sections were affected most.
Repair cost
Yesterday he said it was "prema
ture to say" what the exact cost of
repairing the books will be. "Now we
have to sit back and assess how much
it is going to cost."

Librarians said there was no way to
make a precise estimate of the loss.
When restoration proves necessary,
the Library of Congress has esti
mated the cost at up to $100 per vol
ume, the librarians said.
By noon Saturday, emergency ac
tion was taken to find freezer space
to put the damaged books into what
University Archivist Ralph Hansen
called a "suspended animation."
A 5000-square-foot commercial
freezer with a 20 degrees below zero
temperature reading was located at
Modern Ice and Cold Storage Com
pany in San Jose.
With donated trucks, drivers and
manpower from Peninsula Creamery
of Palo Alto, the first books were on
their way to San Jose late Saturday
afternoon.

3:15 a.m.
'No one knows'
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement and insurance for the Uni
versity, said, "No one knows for
sure" where the break took place.
Digging for the broken water line
should begin this morning when
Green Library construction crews re
turn to their regular Monday morn
ing shift, he said.
However, Beth said, "The contrac
tor cut holes through the basement
wall and should have placed tempor
ary plugs to prevent water from com
ing in." The prime contractor for the
$17 million addition to Green Library
is Dickman Construction, Inc. of
Mountain View.
Beth said the University will also be
hiring an outside consulting firm to
do a metallurgical study on the pipe
at its break to determine the exact
cause of the pipe rupture and to see
if the possibility of a pipe defect
exists.
Possible claim
"There is always the possibility of a
claim against the pipe manufac
turer," he said.
Water, mud and gravel entered the
basement on the B level through un
filled holes recently cut for utilities to
connect with the new library. Water
then poured down a stairway to the
bottom (A) level.
However, a large share of the dam
age was sustained when water drip
ped through a metal floor separating
the two levels and soaked the lower
level books. "That's what caused the
major damage," Weber said.
The collections damaged "may
have cost $10 million to create" in
today's dollars, Weber said. The
music, education, urban studies and
law sections were affected most.
Repair cost
Yesterday he said it was "prema
ture to say" what the exact cost of
repairing the books will be. "Now we
have to sit back and assess how much
it is going to cost."

Librarians said there was no way to
make a precise estimate of the loss.
When restoration proves necessary,
the Library of Congress has esti
mated the cost at up to $100 per vol
ume, the librarians said.
By noon Saturday, emergency ac
tion was taken to find freezer space
to put the damaged books into what
University Archivist Ralph Hansen
called a "suspended animation."
A 5000-square-foot commercial
freezer with a 20 degrees below zero
temperature reading was located at
Modern Ice and Cold Storage Com
pany in San Jose.
With donated trucks, drivers and
manpower from Peninsula Creamery
of Palo Alto, the first books were on
their way to San Jose late Saturday
afternoon.
Students, librarians and faculty
members joined in the massive
clean-up effort Saturday and yester
day. Twenty history graduate stu
dents banded togetherasavolunteer
team yesterday.
"These are the books I'm using.
These are dear to me," one said.
By last night, all the books were in
cold storage and had met the critical
48-hour deadline set by library offi
cials to prevent molding.
The books must be put into a
freeze-dried chamber to take the
moisture out before they can be re
turned to circulation. Weber said he
was "uncertain" whether it would be
a year or more until all materials are
treated.
Beth added that a large vacuum
chamber had been located at Loc
kheed Aircraft in Mountain View for
potential use.
Weber said it will take several
months, if not years, to repair or re
place the books, depending on the

size of staff used.
Also damaged in the flooding were
iOOO miniature books, some dating
to the 17th century. The miniatures,
called "tinys" by the library staff, are
not the rarest books owned by the
library, but are the smallest.
No major structural damage to the
Meyer building was noted. An au
tomatic pumping mechanism and
fire department personnel had water
out of the basement within hours of
the pipe break.
A University planning official said,
"We are really going to be looking at
the contractor and his insurance."
Weber termed the damage a
"scholarly loss as well." Whose
budget pays for replacing or restor
ing the books is "immaterial," he
said.
William Massy, University vice
president for business and finance,
told the librarians at an emergency
Saturday morning meeting that the
University will commit itself to cover
ing the bills.
"We have a duty to ourselves to
take care of everything im
mediately," he said.
The University is self-insured up to
$1 million and has commercial insur
ance for damages above that
amount.
The 40,000 damaged books were
part of the 500,000 book collection in
the basement stacks. The basement
levels will be closed until further
notice, Weber said, but "might be
open later this week."
A paging service for books remain
ing in the basement stacks will beput
into operation today, according to
library officials. Library users want
ing books from the basement stacks
are asked to request them at the
Green Library main desk.

Roughly $1 million in book dam
ages in the Meyer Undergraduate
Library Basement resulted from an
early morning water main break
Saturday.
However, the exact location and
cause of that break remained in
doubt yesterday.
University Libraries Director David
Weber said between 35,000 and
40,000 volumes were "significantly
damaged" when water poured into
the library basement.
An eight-inch fire main on the
Green Library construction site ad
joining the Meyer Library basement
broke at 2:51 a.m., sounding an au
tomatic water pressure alarm. Plant
Services and local fire department
personnel had the water shut off by
3:15 a.m.
