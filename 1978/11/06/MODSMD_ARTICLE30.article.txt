# Report of the Ombudsman, 1977-78
## Report notes increase in student complaints about poor teaching 
### 
"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests
and rights ot members ot the Stanford community trom
in/ustices or abuses ot discretion, from gross inef
ficiency, trom unnecessary delay a n(fi6o¥n plication In
administration ot university rules and regulations, and
from inconsistency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and
prejudice in the individual's experience with university
activities The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine
and channel the complaints and grievances of members
ot the Stanford community, and to secure expeditious
and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the Om
budsman, August 1973).
The year of 1977-78 was marked by a considerable in
crease in the number ot problems brought to the attention ot
this otfice The number rose from approximately 400 in 1976-
77 to approximately 500 as ot the end ot the spring quarter
As in previous years the range ot problems and com
plaints was extremely varied both in kind and complexity
(The accompanying table indicates the variety as well as the
sources from which the grievances arose )
The overall increase may be due to the tact that the
location of this office is more accessible (Old Engineering
Corner, Building 260), the office ot Ombudsman has become
better known to the University at large and its purpose better
understood The following comments will be confined to
three important areas of complaint with which this office was
heavily involved, and very much concerned
Student Grievances
Student academic grievances were in marked increase
over previous years Among these, concerns about teaching
were the most serious The complaints brought to this office
centered on a few courses in mathematics, chemistry, and
biology Complaints about poor teaching in other depart
ments were either nonexistent or relatively minor
Student judgments of teaching can, of course, be
misguided, but their criticisms are often based on ex
perience of well-taught courses against which to judge those
poorly taught And there are, in tact, many excellently taught
courses in the departments mentioned
Basic courses in these departments, which is where'
most of the trouble is. are under heavy demand by
preprofessional Ftudents who are especially concerned with
mastering material necessary for more advanced courses or
required for entrance to graduate school
Students themselves trace the source of poor teaching to
an instructor's lack of interest in the course or to an inability
•to teach, as is sometimes the case with beginning teaching
assistants In voicing their complaints about poor teaching,
students often refer to the high cost of education at Stan
ford; poor teaching is not what they expect or want to pay
for
In an atmosphere where grades, especially in
preprolessional courses, are considered by the student to be
of paramount importance, any real or apparent inequity in
grading becomes a source of complaints Simple mistakes
do occur, and. of course, are easily corrected But if the
standard of grading varies from section to section in a
course, it is quite another matter
When complaints arise from this and other similar cir
cumstances the instructor is obviously in a difficult situation.
Outright re)ection of the student's claim is one reaction;
another is to take some punitive measure against the student
for even raising the question of his or her grade Both
reactions bring students to complain to this office, as they
have a right to do. or to appeal to the formal grievance
procedure, a lengthy and often unsuccessful way to resolve
an issue
But as long as grades play a central role in admission to
graduate school, it seems to this office that it is incumbent
on instructors to treat student complaints as prima facie
worthy of attention
Honor Code
As noted in previous reports, the interpretation of the
Honor Code creates serious problems for both faculty and
students
The Faculty Handbook states " if a faculty member
believes that a violation of the Honor Code has occurred, he
or she should forward such information to the office of the
President "
Difficulties arise concering the intepretation of the term
"believes" for the obvious reason that belief can range from
certainty to some degree of suspicion Unless it is certain
that a violation has occurred instructors are often unwilling
to pursue the matter even to the point of discussing it with
the student involved
Even in cases of clear and definite violation some in
structors settle the matter directly with the student; others
refer the violation to the President's Office Lack of
uniformity in the treatment of violations is serious, if

disregards policy and undermines the very intent ot the
Code
Where violations are suspected but not certain it is
nevertheless important to bring the matter to the Presioent's
Counsel or to the Dean ot Student Affairs This would be
consistent with policy and afford independent |udgment and
advice as to the appropriate action
The President's Honor Code Commission completed its
first year under the able chairmanship of Steven Westly
Despite strong endorsement by the Commission, the ASSU.
and the Faculty Senate, some distrust of the effectiveness of
the Code and failure to adhere to it exists
Some instructors take measures (eg proctoring
examinations) inconsistent with the Honor Code and its
interpretations Reports to this office make it quite clear that
a maiority of students respect and follow the Code and
properly demand that instructors do so as well Distrust by
instructors weakens student confidence that the Code is to
be taken seriously by them and the entire university com
munity
Lecturers
During the past year a number of lecturers brought to this
office grievances concerning their status, conditions of
appointment and teaching loads
The immediate cause of the complaints was a recent
change in the description of terms of appointment A
resolution adopted by the Faculty Senate in 1974 established
that lecturers who serve half time or more be given three
year appointments or terminated By a recent administrative
decision the three year rule has been abolished; instead
no lecturer shall serve in the position at half time or
more for more than five consecutive years "
Lecturers have rightly pointed out this change makes
their positions much more precarious than before In ad
dition, they feel that changes of this sort should not be made
without consultation by the administration with the lecturers
themselves

The Report on the Professoriate (1974) slates "A
number ol lecturers, especially in the foreign languages, are
experienced professionals with long records of service The
present system offers these teachers no privileges, no
alternative to year-to-year (or -even quarter to quarter) ap
pointments and only Ihe remotest chance of eventual
promotion " This statement expresses quite well the view
that many lecturers have about their present status
As a result of an appeal by lecturers to the administration
for a review of the conditions of their appointments. Provost
Miller has promised an investigation this fall This is a most
desirable step towards the resolution of the problems of tnis
very important teaching arm of the University
Conclusion
The three areas of complaints commented on above are
perhaps the most important to come to this office during Ihe
past year Others, of course, are important, but they are
standard and continue from year to year Previous reports
have called attention to some, but none stands ouf at this
time as needing further comment
The Office of the Ombudsman has enioyed during the
past year support and assistance from a large number of
persons in the University community Without such
cooperation it would be difficult indeed to carry out the
charge on which the Ombudsman must operate
In addition, student assistants (under work-study) have
greatly enhanced the sensitiv''y of the office of student
problems Three undergraduates, Dorothy Parrish, Barry
Bakin, and Francis Wong, undertook a number of special
assignments with great skill
An expression ot thanks and appreciation is due to all
who have aided the efforts of this office to resolve Ihe many
different issues that naturally arise in an institution as
complex as Stanford

were the most serious The complaints brought to this office
centered on a few courses in mathematics, chemistry, and
biology Complaints about poor teaching in other depart
ments were either nonexistent or relatively minor
Student judgments of teaching can, of course, be
misguided, but their criticisms are often based on ex
perience of well-taught courses against which to judge those
poorly taught And there are, in tact, many excellently taught
courses in the departments mentioned
Basic courses in these departments, which is where'
most of the trouble is. are under heavy demand by
preprofessional Ftudents who are especially concerned with
mastering material necessary for more advanced courses or
required for entrance to graduate school
Students themselves trace the source of poor teaching to
an instructor's lack of interest in the course or to an inability
•to teach, as is sometimes the case with beginning teaching
assistants In voicing their complaints about poor teaching,
students often refer to the high cost of education at Stan
ford; poor teaching is not what they expect or want to pay
for
In an atmosphere where grades, especially in
preprolessional courses, are considered by the student to be
of paramount importance, any real or apparent inequity in
grading becomes a source of complaints Simple mistakes
do occur, and. of course, are easily corrected But if the
standard of grading varies from section to section in a
course, it is quite another matter
When complaints arise from this and other similar cir
cumstances the instructor is obviously in a difficult situation.
Outright re)ection of the student's claim is one reaction;
another is to take some punitive measure against the student
for even raising the question of his or her grade Both
reactions bring students to complain to this office, as they
have a right to do. or to appeal to the formal grievance
procedure, a lengthy and often unsuccessful way to resolve
an issue
But as long as grades play a central role in admission to
graduate school, it seems to this office that it is incumbent
on instructors to treat student complaints as prima facie
worthy of attention
Honor Code
As noted in previous reports, the interpretation of the
Honor Code creates serious problems for both faculty and
students
The Faculty Handbook states " if a faculty member
believes that a violation of the Honor Code has occurred, he
or she should forward such information to the office of the
President "
Difficulties arise concering the intepretation of the term
"believes" for the obvious reason that belief can range from
certainty to some degree of suspicion Unless it is certain
that a violation has occurred instructors are often unwilling
to pursue the matter even to the point of discussing it with
the student involved
Even in cases of clear and definite violation some in
structors settle the matter directly with the student; others
refer the violation to the President's Office Lack of
uniformity in the treatment of violations is serious, if

disregards policy and undermines the very intent ot the
Code
Where violations are suspected but not certain it is
nevertheless important to bring the matter to the Presioent's
Counsel or to the Dean ot Student Affairs This would be
consistent with policy and afford independent |udgment and
advice as to the appropriate action
The President's Honor Code Commission completed its
first year under the able chairmanship of Steven Westly
Despite strong endorsement by the Commission, the ASSU.
and the Faculty Senate, some distrust of the effectiveness of
the Code and failure to adhere to it exists
Some instructors take measures (eg proctoring
examinations) inconsistent with the Honor Code and its
interpretations Reports to this office make it quite clear that
a maiority of students respect and follow the Code and
properly demand that instructors do so as well Distrust by
instructors weakens student confidence that the Code is to
be taken seriously by them and the entire university com
munity
Lecturers
During the past year a number of lecturers brought to this
office grievances concerning their status, conditions of
appointment and teaching loads
The immediate cause of the complaints was a recent
change in the description of terms of appointment A
resolution adopted by the Faculty Senate in 1974 established
that lecturers who serve half time or more be given three
year appointments or terminated By a recent administrative
decision the three year rule has been abolished; instead
no lecturer shall serve in the position at half time or
more for more than five consecutive years "
Lecturers have rightly pointed out this change makes
their positions much more precarious than before In ad
dition, they feel that changes of this sort should not be made
without consultation by the administration with the lecturers
themselves

The Report on the Professoriate (1974) slates "A
number ol lecturers, especially in the foreign languages, are
experienced professionals with long records of service The
present system offers these teachers no privileges, no
alternative to year-to-year (or -even quarter to quarter) ap
pointments and only Ihe remotest chance of eventual
promotion " This statement expresses quite well the view
that many lecturers have about their present status
As a result of an appeal by lecturers to the administration
for a review of the conditions of their appointments. Provost
Miller has promised an investigation this fall This is a most
desirable step towards the resolution of the problems of tnis
very important teaching arm of the University
Conclusion
The three areas of complaints commented on above are
perhaps the most important to come to this office during Ihe
past year Others, of course, are important, but they are
standard and continue from year to year Previous reports
have called attention to some, but none stands ouf at this
time as needing further comment
The Office of the Ombudsman has enioyed during the
past year support and assistance from a large number of
persons in the University community Without such
cooperation it would be difficult indeed to carry out the
charge on which the Ombudsman must operate
In addition, student assistants (under work-study) have
greatly enhanced the sensitiv''y of the office of student
problems Three undergraduates, Dorothy Parrish, Barry
Bakin, and Francis Wong, undertook a number of special
assignments with great skill
An expression ot thanks and appreciation is due to all
who have aided the efforts of this office to resolve Ihe many
different issues that naturally arise in an institution as
complex as Stanford

The year of 1977-78 was marked by a considerable in
crease in the number ot problems brought to the attention ot
this otfice The number rose from approximately 400 in 1976-

reactions bring students to complain to this office, as they
have a right to do. or to appeal to the formal grievance
procedure, a lengthy and often unsuccessful way to resolve
an issue
But as long as grades play a central role in admission to
graduate school, it seems to this office that it is incumbent
on instructors to treat student complaints as prima facie
worthy of attention
Honor Code
As noted in previous reports, the interpretation of the
Honor Code creates serious problems for both faculty and
students
The Faculty Handbook states " if a faculty member
believes that a violation of the Honor Code has occurred, he
or she should forward such information to the office of the
President "
Difficulties arise concering the intepretation of the term
"believes" for the obvious reason that belief can range from
certainty to some degree of suspicion Unless it is certain
that a violation has occurred instructors are often unwilling
to pursue the matter even to the point of discussing it with
the student involved
Even in cases of clear and definite violation some in
structors settle the matter directly with the student; others
refer the violation to the President's Office Lack of
uniformity in the treatment of violations is serious, if

disregards policy and undermines the very intent ot the
Code
Where violations are suspected but not certain it is
nevertheless important to bring the matter to the Presioent's
Counsel or to the Dean ot Student Affairs This would be
consistent with policy and afford independent |udgment and
advice as to the appropriate action
The President's Honor Code Commission completed its
first year under the able chairmanship of Steven Westly
Despite strong endorsement by the Commission, the ASSU.
and the Faculty Senate, some distrust of the effectiveness of
the Code and failure to adhere to it exists
Some instructors take measures (eg proctoring
examinations) inconsistent with the Honor Code and its
interpretations Reports to this office make it quite clear that
a maiority of students respect and follow the Code and
properly demand that instructors do so as well Distrust by
instructors weakens student confidence that the Code is to
be taken seriously by them and the entire university com
munity
Lecturers
During the past year a number of lecturers brought to this
office grievances concerning their status, conditions of
appointment and teaching loads
The immediate cause of the complaints was a recent
change in the description of terms of appointment A
resolution adopted by the Faculty Senate in 1974 established
that lecturers who serve half time or more be given three
year appointments or terminated By a recent administrative
decision the three year rule has been abolished; instead
no lecturer shall serve in the position at half time or
more for more than five consecutive years "
Lecturers have rightly pointed out this change makes
their positions much more precarious than before In ad
dition, they feel that changes of this sort should not be made
without consultation by the administration with the lecturers
themselves

The Report on the Professoriate (1974) slates "A
number ol lecturers, especially in the foreign languages, are
experienced professionals with long records of service The
present system offers these teachers no privileges, no
alternative to year-to-year (or -even quarter to quarter) ap
pointments and only Ihe remotest chance of eventual
promotion " This statement expresses quite well the view
that many lecturers have about their present status
As a result of an appeal by lecturers to the administration
for a review of the conditions of their appointments. Provost
Miller has promised an investigation this fall This is a most
desirable step towards the resolution of the problems of tnis
very important teaching arm of the University
Conclusion
The three areas of complaints commented on above are
perhaps the most important to come to this office during Ihe
past year Others, of course, are important, but they are
standard and continue from year to year Previous reports
have called attention to some, but none stands ouf at this
time as needing further comment
The Office of the Ombudsman has enioyed during the
past year support and assistance from a large number of
persons in the University community Without such
cooperation it would be difficult indeed to carry out the
charge on which the Ombudsman must operate
In addition, student assistants (under work-study) have
greatly enhanced the sensitiv''y of the office of student
problems Three undergraduates, Dorothy Parrish, Barry
Bakin, and Francis Wong, undertook a number of special
assignments with great skill
An expression ot thanks and appreciation is due to all
who have aided the efforts of this office to resolve Ihe many
different issues that naturally arise in an institution as
complex as Stanford

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests

administration ot university rules and regulations, and
from inconsistency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and
prejudice in the individual's experience with university
activities The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine
and channel the complaints and grievances of members
ot the Stanford community, and to secure expeditious
and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the Om
budsman, August 1973).
The year of 1977-78 was marked by a considerable in
crease in the number ot problems brought to the attention ot
this otfice The number rose from approximately 400 in 1976-
77 to approximately 500 as ot the end ot the spring quarter
As in previous years the range ot problems and com
plaints was extremely varied both in kind and complexity
(The accompanying table indicates the variety as well as the
sources from which the grievances arose )
The overall increase may be due to the tact that the
location of this office is more accessible (Old Engineering
Corner, Building 260), the office ot Ombudsman has become
better known to the University at large and its purpose better
understood The following comments will be confined to
three important areas of complaint with which this office was
heavily involved, and very much concerned
Student Grievances
Student academic grievances were in marked increase
over previous years Among these, concerns about teaching
were the most serious The complaints brought to this office
centered on a few courses in mathematics, chemistry, and
biology Complaints about poor teaching in other depart
ments were either nonexistent or relatively minor
Student judgments of teaching can, of course, be
misguided, but their criticisms are often based on ex
perience of well-taught courses against which to judge those
poorly taught And there are, in tact, many excellently taught
courses in the departments mentioned
Basic courses in these departments, which is where'
most of the trouble is. are under heavy demand by
preprofessional Ftudents who are especially concerned with
mastering material necessary for more advanced courses or
required for entrance to graduate school
Students themselves trace the source of poor teaching to
an instructor's lack of interest in the course or to an inability
•to teach, as is sometimes the case with beginning teaching
assistants In voicing their complaints about poor teaching,
students often refer to the high cost of education at Stan
ford; poor teaching is not what they expect or want to pay
for
In an atmosphere where grades, especially in
preprolessional courses, are considered by the student to be
of paramount importance, any real or apparent inequity in
grading becomes a source of complaints Simple mistakes
do occur, and. of course, are easily corrected But if the
standard of grading varies from section to section in a
course, it is quite another matter
When complaints arise from this and other similar cir
cumstances the instructor is obviously in a difficult situation.
Outright re)ection of the student's claim is one reaction;
another is to take some punitive measure against the student
for even raising the question of his or her grade Both
reactions bring students to complain to this office, as they
have a right to do. or to appeal to the formal grievance

Despite strong endorsement by the Commission, the ASSU.
and the Faculty Senate, some distrust of the effectiveness of
the Code and failure to adhere to it exists
Some instructors take measures (eg proctoring
examinations) inconsistent with the Honor Code and its
interpretations Reports to this office make it quite clear that
a maiority of students respect and follow the Code and
properly demand that instructors do so as well Distrust by
instructors weakens student confidence that the Code is to
be taken seriously by them and the entire university com
munity
Lecturers
During the past year a number of lecturers brought to this
office grievances concerning their status, conditions of
appointment and teaching loads
The immediate cause of the complaints was a recent
change in the description of terms of appointment A
resolution adopted by the Faculty Senate in 1974 established
that lecturers who serve half time or more be given three
year appointments or terminated By a recent administrative
decision the three year rule has been abolished; instead
no lecturer shall serve in the position at half time or
more for more than five consecutive years "
Lecturers have rightly pointed out this change makes
their positions much more precarious than before In ad
dition, they feel that changes of this sort should not be made
without consultation by the administration with the lecturers
themselves

The Report on the Professoriate (1974) slates "A
number ol lecturers, especially in the foreign languages, are
experienced professionals with long records of service The
present system offers these teachers no privileges, no
alternative to year-to-year (or -even quarter to quarter) ap
pointments and only Ihe remotest chance of eventual
promotion " This statement expresses quite well the view
that many lecturers have about their present status
As a result of an appeal by lecturers to the administration
for a review of the conditions of their appointments. Provost
Miller has promised an investigation this fall This is a most
desirable step towards the resolution of the problems of tnis
very important teaching arm of the University
Conclusion
The three areas of complaints commented on above are
perhaps the most important to come to this office during Ihe
past year Others, of course, are important, but they are
standard and continue from year to year Previous reports
have called attention to some, but none stands ouf at this
time as needing further comment
The Office of the Ombudsman has enioyed during the
past year support and assistance from a large number of
persons in the University community Without such
cooperation it would be difficult indeed to carry out the
charge on which the Ombudsman must operate
In addition, student assistants (under work-study) have
greatly enhanced the sensitiv''y of the office of student
problems Three undergraduates, Dorothy Parrish, Barry
Bakin, and Francis Wong, undertook a number of special
assignments with great skill
An expression ot thanks and appreciation is due to all
who have aided the efforts of this office to resolve Ihe many
different issues that naturally arise in an institution as
complex as Stanford

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests
and rights ot members ot the Stanford community trom
in/ustices or abuses ot discretion, from gross inef
ficiency, trom unnecessary delay a n(fi6o¥n plication In
administration ot university rules and regulations, and
from inconsistency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and
prejudice in the individual's experience with university
activities The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine
and channel the complaints and grievances of members
ot the Stanford community, and to secure expeditious
and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the Om
budsman, August 1973).
The year of 1977-78 was marked by a considerable in
crease in the number ot problems brought to the attention ot
this otfice The number rose from approximately 400 in 1976-
77 to approximately 500 as ot the end ot the spring quarter
As in previous years the range ot problems and com
plaints was extremely varied both in kind and complexity
(The accompanying table indicates the variety as well as the
sources from which the grievances arose )
The overall increase may be due to the tact that the
location of this office is more accessible (Old Engineering
Corner, Building 260), the office ot Ombudsman has become
better known to the University at large and its purpose better
understood The following comments will be confined to
three important areas of complaint with which this office was
heavily involved, and very much concerned
Student Grievances
Student academic grievances were in marked increase
over previous years Among these, concerns about teaching
were the most serious The complaints brought to this office
centered on a few courses in mathematics, chemistry, and
biology Complaints about poor teaching in other depart
ments were either nonexistent or relatively minor
Student judgments of teaching can, of course, be
misguided, but their criticisms are often based on ex
perience of well-taught courses against which to judge those
poorly taught And there are, in tact, many excellently taught
courses in the departments mentioned
Basic courses in these departments, which is where'
most of the trouble is. are under heavy demand by
preprofessional Ftudents who are especially concerned with
mastering material necessary for more advanced courses or
required for entrance to graduate school
Students themselves trace the source of poor teaching to
an instructor's lack of interest in the course or to an inability
•to teach, as is sometimes the case with beginning teaching
assistants In voicing their complaints about poor teaching,
students often refer to the high cost of education at Stan
ford; poor teaching is not what they expect or want to pay
for
In an atmosphere where grades, especially in
preprolessional courses, are considered by the student to be
of paramount importance, any real or apparent inequity in
grading becomes a source of complaints Simple mistakes
do occur, and. of course, are easily corrected But if the
standard of grading varies from section to section in a
course, it is quite another matter
When complaints arise from this and other similar cir
cumstances the instructor is obviously in a difficult situation.
Outright re)ection of the student's claim is one reaction;
another is to take some punitive measure against the student
for even raising the question of his or her grade Both
reactions bring students to complain to this office, as they
have a right to do. or to appeal to the formal grievance
procedure, a lengthy and often unsuccessful way to resolve
an issue
But as long as grades play a central role in admission to
graduate school, it seems to this office that it is incumbent
on instructors to treat student complaints as prima facie
worthy of attention
Honor Code
As noted in previous reports, the interpretation of the
Honor Code creates serious problems for both faculty and
students
The Faculty Handbook states " if a faculty member
believes that a violation of the Honor Code has occurred, he
or she should forward such information to the office of the
President "
Difficulties arise concering the intepretation of the term
"believes" for the obvious reason that belief can range from
certainty to some degree of suspicion Unless it is certain
that a violation has occurred instructors are often unwilling
to pursue the matter even to the point of discussing it with
the student involved
Even in cases of clear and definite violation some in
structors settle the matter directly with the student; others
refer the violation to the President's Office Lack of
uniformity in the treatment of violations is serious, if

disregards policy and undermines the very intent ot the
Code
Where violations are suspected but not certain it is
nevertheless important to bring the matter to the Presioent's
Counsel or to the Dean ot Student Affairs This would be
consistent with policy and afford independent |udgment and
advice as to the appropriate action

promotion " This statement expresses quite well the view
that many lecturers have about their present status
As a result of an appeal by lecturers to the administration
for a review of the conditions of their appointments. Provost
Miller has promised an investigation this fall This is a most
desirable step towards the resolution of the problems of tnis
very important teaching arm of the University
Conclusion
The three areas of complaints commented on above are
perhaps the most important to come to this office during Ihe
past year Others, of course, are important, but they are
standard and continue from year to year Previous reports
have called attention to some, but none stands ouf at this
time as needing further comment
The Office of the Ombudsman has enioyed during the
past year support and assistance from a large number of
persons in the University community Without such
cooperation it would be difficult indeed to carry out the
charge on which the Ombudsman must operate
In addition, student assistants (under work-study) have
greatly enhanced the sensitiv''y of the office of student
problems Three undergraduates, Dorothy Parrish, Barry
Bakin, and Francis Wong, undertook a number of special
assignments with great skill
An expression ot thanks and appreciation is due to all
who have aided the efforts of this office to resolve Ihe many
different issues that naturally arise in an institution as
complex as Stanford
