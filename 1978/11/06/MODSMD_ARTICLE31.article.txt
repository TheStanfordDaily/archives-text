Flood in Cedro Hall
A broken water main in Junipero at 11:30 p.m. Friday flooded the courtyard between Junipero and Arroyo, and
covered the hallway of Cedro with an inch of water. Residents swept out most of the water but were later aided
by the Palo Alto Fire Department, which had been summoned by an accidentally-triggered fire alarm on the third
floor. Damage was minimal, but Cedro residents had their water shut off until 5 a.m. Saturday.
