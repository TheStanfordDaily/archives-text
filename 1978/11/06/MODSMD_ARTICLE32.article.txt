# Polling places listed for campus precincts
## 
### 
Eight polling places on campus
will be open tomorrow from 7
a.m. to 8 p.m. for registered vot
ers to cast their ballots.
These polling places, listed by
precinct number, are: 2543 —
Tresidder Union, rm. 270; 2544 —
Women's Clubhouse; 2545 —
Nixon Elementary School on Stan
ford Avenue; 2546 — Terra
House, 539 Cowell Lane; 2547 —
Cregor residence on Cabrillo Av
enue; 2552 — Wilbur Hall; 2553 —
Escondido Elementary School;
2554 — Kairos House, 586
Maytield Ave.
Voters must cast their ballots in
the precinct in which they regis
tered. For example, if a student
registered last year while living in
Wilbur, but moved to Roble this
year, his or her name would be on
the precinct list which includes

Wilbur and would have to go
there to vote.
According to Prof. John Troxell,
inspector of precinct 2543, not all
registered voters received notifi
cation in the mail as to where they
should vote. Troxell suggested
that voters go to the polling place
nearest to where they registered.
A list of registered voters will be
posted on the door of each pol
ling place, and voters should
check for their name there before
entering, he said.
Names are listed according to
street address (not P.O. Box
number) and may be listed either
under the name of the residence
("D" for Durand House) or the
street name ("M" for Mayfield),
depending on how the address
was given at time of registration.
