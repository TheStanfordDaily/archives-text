Economy top issue in elections
Washington — The nation elects a new Congress to
morrow, and by all accounts, voters are ready to give the
Democrats continued sway in the era of Proposition 13.
The leaders of both parties agree that economic issues
— inflation, taxes and government spending — are up
permost in the mind of the voter.
Thirty-four Senate contests are on state ballots, with
voters also choosing a new 435-member House of Rep
resentatives. >
There will be gubernatorial elections in 36 states —
where Republicans seem to have the best shot for sig
nificant gains — and contests for thousands of state and
local offices.
In the continuing saga of the Proposition 13 tax rebell
ion, voters in 16 states will decide whether to accept
plans to limit taxes or spending.
The polls show that the public sees little difference
between Democrats' and Republicans' ability to deal
with rising prices, their top concern. In an Associated
Press-NBC News poll, about 48 percent of those re
sponding said their lives will be no better or worse no
matter who wins the election.
There are 155.5 million voters eligible to cast ballots,
but only 36 percent of those eligible in the 1974 mid-term
elections voted.
N.Y. papers resume publication
New York — Newsrooms and pressrooms came alive
at The New York Times and Daily News yesterday after
tentative agreements with striking unions ended the
city's three-month newspaper blackout.
The Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella coali
tion of the newspaper unions, told employees of the two
big morning papers to report for work yesterday for the
first time since Aug. 9, and normal press runs were
scheduled for today's editions.
All but one of the unions involved had ratified the
agreements by last evening, and the Newspaper Guild
was expected to follow suit in a 10 p.m. vote on its
agreement with the Times.
Regardless of the outcome of that vote, however, the
Times and News would have editions ready today for the
nearly 3 million readers who have gone without the
prestigious, influential papers.
Iranian official quits amid riots
Tehran, Iran — Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emami
submitted his resignation to Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi last night, authoritative sources said, as mobs
shouting "Death to the shah!" rampaged through
Tehran.
The sources said Sharif-Emami resigned during a
meeting with the shah but it was unknown if the shah

had accepted the resignation.
Hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers
rolled into Tehran as rioters stormed through the capi
tal's streets virtually unchecked.
About 500 demonstrators forced open the gate to the
British Embassy and burned down the four-story main
building in the downtown complex. The U.S. and Iraqi
embassies in the northern part of the city also were
threatened, but rioters were driven back by soldiers and
tanks.
Sharif-Emami, 69, had been appointed prime minister
by the shah on Aug. 27 in an effort to stem Moslem
opposition to the government.
Progress reported in Mideast talks
Washington — Israeli and Egyptian negotiators were
reported close to agreement yesterday on certain non
military aspects of their proposed peace treaty following
more than three hours of face-to-face discussions.
Progress was also made on the military portion of the
treaty with more talks on that section scheduled for
today, according to State Department press officer
George Sherman, who is serving as spokesman for all
three countries.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Israeli Foreign Minis
ter Moshe Dayan and Egyptian Defense Minister Lt. Gen.
Kamal Hassan Ali held a formal session lasting for more
than three hours yesterday at Blair House.
That session covered the treaty annexes, attachments
spelling out military, economic and diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
Fires claim at least 19 lives
Fires roared through a Pennsylvania hotel and an lowa
department store yesterday, killing at least 19 people
and leaving firefighters wondering how much higher the
death tolls would climb.
In Honesdale, Pa., Wayne County Coroner Robert
)ennings said nine bodies were found in the rubble that
had been the historic Allen Motor Inn, and three or four
more persons were missing and believed dead, lennings
said he believes the cause of the fire was arson.
Fireman Allan Kominski said that when rescue units
arrived about 2:40 a.m., "flames were rolling out the
front and sides of the building. People on the second
and third floors were hanging out windows screaming
'Help me, save me.' A few jumped and we got to some of
the others with ladders."
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of morning
fog. A little warmer days. Lows in the mid 40s to low 50s.
Highs today and tomorrow in the upper 60s and 70s.
Light winds.

Economy top issue in elections
Washington — The nation elects a new Congress to
morrow, and by all accounts, voters are ready to give the
Democrats continued sway in the era of Proposition 13.
The leaders of both parties agree that economic issues
— inflation, taxes and government spending — are up
permost in the mind of the voter.
Thirty-four Senate contests are on state ballots, with
voters also choosing a new 435-member House of Rep
resentatives. >
There will be gubernatorial elections in 36 states —
where Republicans seem to have the best shot for sig
nificant gains — and contests for thousands of state and
local offices.
In the continuing saga of the Proposition 13 tax rebell
ion, voters in 16 states will decide whether to accept
plans to limit taxes or spending.
The polls show that the public sees little difference
between Democrats' and Republicans' ability to deal
with rising prices, their top concern. In an Associated
Press-NBC News poll, about 48 percent of those re
sponding said their lives will be no better or worse no
matter who wins the election.
There are 155.5 million voters eligible to cast ballots,
but only 36 percent of those eligible in the 1974 mid-term
elections voted.
N.Y. papers resume publication
New York — Newsrooms and pressrooms came alive
at The New York Times and Daily News yesterday after
tentative agreements with striking unions ended the
city's three-month newspaper blackout.
The Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella coali
tion of the newspaper unions, told employees of the two
big morning papers to report for work yesterday for the
first time since Aug. 9, and normal press runs were
scheduled for today's editions.
All but one of the unions involved had ratified the
agreements by last evening, and the Newspaper Guild
was expected to follow suit in a 10 p.m. vote on its
agreement with the Times.
Regardless of the outcome of that vote, however, the
Times and News would have editions ready today for the
nearly 3 million readers who have gone without the
prestigious, influential papers.
Iranian official quits amid riots
Tehran, Iran — Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emami
submitted his resignation to Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi last night, authoritative sources said, as mobs
shouting "Death to the shah!" rampaged through
Tehran.
The sources said Sharif-Emami resigned during a
meeting with the shah but it was unknown if the shah

had accepted the resignation.
Hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers
rolled into Tehran as rioters stormed through the capi
tal's streets virtually unchecked.
About 500 demonstrators forced open the gate to the
British Embassy and burned down the four-story main
building in the downtown complex. The U.S. and Iraqi
embassies in the northern part of the city also were
threatened, but rioters were driven back by soldiers and
tanks.
Sharif-Emami, 69, had been appointed prime minister
by the shah on Aug. 27 in an effort to stem Moslem
opposition to the government.
