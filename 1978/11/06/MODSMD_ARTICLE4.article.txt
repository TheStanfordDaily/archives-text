# Brown, Younger hold final debate
## State payroll cutbacks promised 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown said yesterday a vote for him is
"a vote for the radical reduction in
the kind of government we have
seen in the past."
But Brown's Republican rival in
tomorrow's election, Evelle
Younger, said that the Democratic
governor has prevented Proposition
13 from working by playing state
"sugar daddy" — and that Brown is a
big spender who will lead California
to bigger and bigger governments.
Both Brown and Younger struck
similar themes of cutting govern
ment in their fifth and final debate
before the election, and each
pledged to reduce Jhe number of
employees on the state payroll dur
ing the next four years.
Younger promised to cut every
state agency "at least 10 percent, and
that means fewer employees." But
Younger added he would exclude
some programs from a 10 percent
cut, such as the California Highway
Patrol.
Brown made a similar pledge in the
60-minute debate on KNBC televi
sion in Los Angeles, saying "I intend
if given a second term to cut the
number of state employees."
Younger also talked at length
about the need for nuclear power, a
principal plank in his platform and
his sharpest difference with Brown.
And Brown said he had no plans of
running for president in 1980 if re
elected this year, although he did not
firmly rule out a 1980 campaign.
"I wouldn't even try to speculate"
about running for president, Brown
said. "It's something I've put out of
my mind."

Younger also charged that Brown's
anti-growth policies will limit new
housing and drive the prices of
homes out of the reach of still more
California families.
Repeating familiar stands,
Younger said nuclear power is safe
and costs half the price of electric
power produced from oil, while
Brown said he will "avoid nuclear
until we solve the waste problem."
The two candidates each con
demned the other as a big spender
and attempted to paint himself as the

man best able to cut government
spending in the 1980s.
Brown would not flatly rule out the
possibility that he might sign a tax
increase sometime in the next four
years, but he said he would hold out
"as long as I can against the forces of
spending."
Younger repeatedly accused
Brown of being a big spending gov
ernor who had allowed the state
budget to double in his four years as
governor, and Younger said he
would reverse that trend with a $1
billion spending cut next year.

"I wouldn't even try to speculate"
about running for president, Brown
said. "It's something I've put out of
my mind."

Younger also charged that Brown's
anti-growth policies will limit new
housing and drive the prices of
homes out of the reach of still more
California families.
Repeating familiar stands,
Younger said nuclear power is safe
and costs half the price of electric
power produced from oil, while
Brown said he will "avoid nuclear
until we solve the waste problem."
The two candidates each con
demned the other as a big spender
and attempted to paint himself as the

man best able to cut government
spending in the 1980s.
Brown would not flatly rule out the
possibility that he might sign a tax
increase sometime in the next four
years, but he said he would hold out
"as long as I can against the forces of
spending."
Younger repeatedly accused
Brown of being a big spending gov
ernor who had allowed the state
budget to double in his four years as
governor, and Younger said he
would reverse that trend with a $1
billion spending cut next year.
