# Female student flees from male assailants
## 
### 
A female student here escaped
from three white maleassailants near
Lake Lagunita at 9:45 Thursday night
when a car stopped near the scene of
her struggle, campus police re
ported.
According to Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer, the student was jogging
along Junipero Serra near the Cam
pus Drive intersection when she was
grabbed. She made an attempt to
fight off her assailants, kicking one in
the groin. The other two dragged her
into a culvert, holding her down and
molesting her.
She described one of herassailants
as very large and strong while
another had a full beard. She said all
three were white males and probably
in their late 20s.
During the assault, a car stopped
along the road. When it came in view

and its occupants got out, both the
student and her assailants fled.
She ran back to her dorm to call the
police, suffering only minor cuts and
bruises.
Niemeyer said, "We have a possi
ble lead on some suspects," and
urged those persons in the car who
saw the incident to contact the police
at 497-3444.
Niemeyer said there have been
several reports of indecent exposure
near the same intersection in recent
weeks. However, this is the first re
ported sexual assault on campus this
fall.
Niemeyer said he is concerned
about the increasing number of inci
dents of lone women being ab
ducted off roadways and assaulted
by small groups of men in the Mid-
Peninsula area recently.
Three weeks ago, a Stanford stu
dent was attacked while riding her
bicycle in Woodside by three males
who dragged her into a van and as
saulted her repeatedly.
According to Leah Kaplan, assis
tant dean of student affairs, the
number of reported rapes has been
"increasing tremendously," al
though she said she did not know if
women are reporting the attacks
more now or if there are actually
more rapes.
However, Kaplan said the attacks
she has heard about have been
"gang rapes more than individual"
assaults. She added that women who
jog alone may think they can run
away from an assailant, "but when
you're thinking about two or three
people jumping out after you,
there's not much you can do."
