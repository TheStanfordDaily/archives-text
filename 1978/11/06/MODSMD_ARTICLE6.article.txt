# Streamlined-sexy-figure obsession persists among University women
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior Staff Writer 
"Thin is beautiful."
America has an obsession
with the sensuous beauty of a
streamlined figure. From the
pre-Civil War days of Southern
belles with cinched waists of 18
inches to Twiggy's 90-pound
figure of the 19605, slender
bodies have been demanded
of young women.
But a local psychiatrist be
lieves this social pressure for
thinness may be one of the
main causes for anorexia ner
vosa, a mental-physical ailment
affecting mostly women aged
15 to 25.
"It often begins in women
who start on diet programs and
then can't stop," said Dr. Har
vey Weinstein, a staff
psychiatrist at Cowell Student
Health Center. "They still see
themselves as being fat even
when they're down to 40 or 50

pounds. It's a constant attempt
to become the mannequin
model."
In many cases, it is also a fatal
attempt. Statistics show that up
to 25 percent or anoretics die
of malnutrition.
Weinstein, who has done ex
tensive research in eating dis
orders, said only three true
anoretics live on campus this
year, all females, while nine
more women here have severe
eating disorders.
"We'll get calls from RAs and
roommates who are worried
about a student who is binge
eating," Weinstein said.
"There seems to be increasing
incidents of women overeating
and then vomiting in the
bathrooms."
While the reported incidents
are increasing, a large number
of patients never report their
problems. Moreover, in many
cases, it's difficult for friends or

relatives to diagnose the dis
ease.
For example, Weinstein said
that since physical fitness is the
latest fad in America, persons
afflicted with anorexia nervosa
and its hyperactivity symptom
would not necessarily raise
suspicion about the disease
because they suddenly began
exercising strenuously.
Other causes include a sud
den loss of self-esteem or ex
treme disappointment.
"Some patients will feel they
have no control over their own
lives and believe they can as
sert this control by regulating
what they eat," Weinstein
explained.
But neither Weinstein nor
Dr. David Dorosin, director of
Huston House Counseling
Center here, have noticed an
increase in anorexia nervosa or
binge eating during midterms
or finals weeks.
"Many students will eat too
much or too little when they're
depressed or nervous, but
every human being does this at

one time or another," Dorosin
explained.
But, Dorosin added, anorexia
nervosa may strike a young
woman entering puberty.
' "Sbme women might be try
ing to avoid their oncoming
sexuality and try to show con
trol, mastery and indepen
dence by not eating," he said.
Dorosin, who has worked
closely with anoretics,
suggests a combination of fam
ily therapy and reward treat
ment for patients.
"The first step is to have the
patiend agree he or she has a
problem," Dorosin explained.
"You can force feed the pa
tients, but unless you tackle
the real, underlying problem,
they'll go right back to starva
tion when they're released
from the hospital."
With a reward system, the
hyperactive patient can exer
cise only after he eats a full
meal.
"After all," said Dorosin,
"the mouth bone is connected
to the head bone."

vosa, a mental-physical ailment
affecting mostly women aged
15 to 25.
"It often begins in women
who start on diet programs and
then can't stop," said Dr. Har
vey Weinstein, a staff
psychiatrist at Cowell Student
Health Center. "They still see
themselves as being fat even
when they're down to 40 or 50

pounds. It's a constant attempt
to become the mannequin
model."
In many cases, it is also a fatal
attempt. Statistics show that up
to 25 percent or anoretics die
of malnutrition.
Weinstein, who has done ex
tensive research in eating dis
orders, said only three true
anoretics live on campus this
year, all females, while nine
more women here have severe
eating disorders.
"We'll get calls from RAs and
roommates who are worried
about a student who is binge
eating," Weinstein said.
"There seems to be increasing
incidents of women overeating
and then vomiting in the
bathrooms."
While the reported incidents
are increasing, a large number
of patients never report their
problems. Moreover, in many
cases, it's difficult for friends or

relatives to diagnose the dis
ease.
For example, Weinstein said
that since physical fitness is the
latest fad in America, persons
afflicted with anorexia nervosa
and its hyperactivity symptom
would not necessarily raise
suspicion about the disease
because they suddenly began
exercising strenuously.
Other causes include a sud
den loss of self-esteem or ex
treme disappointment.
"Some patients will feel they
have no control over their own
lives and believe they can as
sert this control by regulating
what they eat," Weinstein
explained.
But neither Weinstein nor
Dr. David Dorosin, director of
Huston House Counseling
Center here, have noticed an
increase in anorexia nervosa or
binge eating during midterms
or finals weeks.
"Many students will eat too
much or too little when they're
depressed or nervous, but
every human being does this at

one time or another," Dorosin
explained.
But, Dorosin added, anorexia
nervosa may strike a young
woman entering puberty.
' "Sbme women might be try
ing to avoid their oncoming
sexuality and try to show con
trol, mastery and indepen
dence by not eating," he said.
Dorosin, who has worked
closely with anoretics,
suggests a combination of fam
ily therapy and reward treat
ment for patients.
"The first step is to have the
patiend agree he or she has a
problem," Dorosin explained.
"You can force feed the pa
tients, but unless you tackle
the real, underlying problem,
they'll go right back to starva
tion when they're released
from the hospital."
With a reward system, the
hyperactive patient can exer
cise only after he eats a full
meal.
"After all," said Dorosin,
"the mouth bone is connected
to the head bone."
"Thin is beautiful."
America has an obsession
with the sensuous beauty of a
streamlined figure. From the
pre-Civil War days of Southern
belles with cinched waists of 18
inches to Twiggy's 90-pound
figure of the 19605, slender
bodies have been demanded
of young women.
But a local psychiatrist be
lieves this social pressure for
thinness may be one of the
main causes for anorexia ner
vosa, a mental-physical ailment
affecting mostly women aged
15 to 25.
