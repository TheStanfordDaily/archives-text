# Blindness: a dark way to 'see' the world

blind students about whom

Objects must be felt, not
seen. Paintings must be de
scribed. Movies must be heard
before they are imagined. A
blind person depends on
non-visual cues to experience
the numerous stimuli in the
world.
What are the frustrations of
living in an environment that
never will be seen? Three blind
students currently attend the
University.
"Blindness is not like dark
ness," said Dennis Clark, a
graduate student in mechani
cal engineering. "You're not
seeing anything, not darkness
nor light. I see with my brain,
not my eyes."
A seeing child for 12 years,
Clark went blind during
Christmas vacation in 1963.
"The only blind person I had
ever known was a beggar in a
town near mine in Illinois.
Whenever he played the guitar
and harmonica, a little cup
would be hanging off the
guitar. I thought that's what
happened to blind people. It
was a bit frightening. I decided

I would be different," Clark
said.
Clark's parents allowed him
to take drum playing lessons.
Clark soon "took pleasure in
doing housework. I wanted to
prove to myself and everyone
else that I could do it. I really
wanted to be a competent
blind person, if I was going to
be blind."
Greg Fowler, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering,
said "blindness is much more
of an inconvenience than a dis
ability. People tend to put me
in a class without understand
ing what I'm really like,"
Fowler said. He added that his
feelings aren't any different
from other people he knows.
"People have such a distorted
image of things. It's frustrat
ing."
But Fowler said he tries not
to become angry about his
blindness. "You could spend

your life being angry rather
than doing the things you want
to do. There's nothing to do
except accept it. It wouldn't get
me anywhere to be miserable
about it all the time."
John DeLuca, a first-year law
student here, went blind from
glaucoma, a congenital dis
ease, when he was nine years
old. "It's an irrevocable fact of
life," he said. "But with
changes in technology, of
course I hope that one day
something will come along to
change it. If I'm depressed
about something, being blind
always seems to add to it and
make things worse. I tend to
ask why I was the unlucky one
to be struck down by this un
fairness. Why me?"
Each of the students agreed
that "outsiders tend to be very
ignorant."
"People really tend to treat
you differently. People seem

more hesitant in coming up to
me. I'm sorry it has to be that
way, because there's only so
much I can do to change how
people react. I try to convey
that I'm not too different in
hopes that I can put the other
person at ease with me. What's
strange sometimes is that I'll
stumble off the curb. It hap
pens all the time. It doesn't
bother me at all, but everybody
else who's with me seems to
get nervous about it. I guess
they think I'm really embarras
sed about it," DeLuca said.
Clark said that students here
seem ignorant about blindness
and what the life of a blind per
son is like. "Around Stanford,
it really annoys me. The people
are supposed to be so bright.
But they have so little imagina
tion. Do they really think their
whole lives would come to an
end if they went blind?"

Clark believes most people
have a distorted image of
blindness. He said Americans
tend to get information from
television advertisements that
portray a TV screen going
black. "Then the ad says 'this is
what blindness is like.' It's a
very effective way of fund
raising. But I don't understand
why they try to show the most
pathetic image that is possi
ble," he said.
The Society for the Preven
tion of Blindness completed a
survey last year to find what
people feared most among var
ious diseases and handicaps.
Cancer and blindness were the
most feared, said Clark. "What
people should realize, is that
blindness is a lot less debilitat
ing than other things. As a
blind person, I'm just like the
rest of you out there, on the
inside."

fairness. Why me?"
Each of the students agreed
that "outsiders tend to be very
ignorant."
"People really tend to treat
you differently. People seem

more hesitant in coming up to
me. I'm sorry it has to be that
way, because there's only so
much I can do to change how
people react. I try to convey
that I'm not too different in
hopes that I can put the other
person at ease with me. What's
strange sometimes is that I'll
stumble off the curb. It hap
pens all the time. It doesn't
bother me at all, but everybody
else who's with me seems to
get nervous about it. I guess
they think I'm really embarras
sed about it," DeLuca said.
Clark said that students here
seem ignorant about blindness
and what the life of a blind per
son is like. "Around Stanford,
it really annoys me. The people
are supposed to be so bright.
But they have so little imagina
tion. Do they really think their
whole lives would come to an
end if they went blind?"

Clark believes most people
have a distorted image of
blindness. He said Americans
tend to get information from
television advertisements that
portray a TV screen going
black. "Then the ad says 'this is
what blindness is like.' It's a
very effective way of fund
raising. But I don't understand
why they try to show the most
pathetic image that is possi
ble," he said.
The Society for the Preven
tion of Blindness completed a
survey last year to find what
people feared most among var
ious diseases and handicaps.
Cancer and blindness were the
most feared, said Clark. "What
people should realize, is that
blindness is a lot less debilitat
ing than other things. As a
blind person, I'm just like the
rest of you out there, on the
inside."

"Blindness is an irrevocable fact of life. ... Of course, I hope that one
day something will come along to change it."
— Law student John DeLuca
(Editor's note: The Daily urges
neighbors and friends of the
blind students about whom
this article was written to read
the article to them, so that they
may know of its publication.)
Objects must be felt, not
seen. Paintings must be de
scribed. Movies must be heard
before they are imagined. A
blind person depends on
non-visual cues to experience
the numerous stimuli in the
world.
What are the frustrations of
living in an environment that
never will be seen? Three blind
students currently attend the
University.
"Blindness is not like dark
ness," said Dennis Clark, a
graduate student in mechani
cal engineering. "You're not
seeing anything, not darkness
nor light. I see with my brain,
not my eyes."
A seeing child for 12 years,
Clark went blind during
Christmas vacation in 1963.
"The only blind person I had
ever known was a beggar in a
town near mine in Illinois.
Whenever he played the guitar
and harmonica, a little cup
would be hanging off the
guitar. I thought that's what
happened to blind people. It
was a bit frightening. I decided

I would be different," Clark
said.
Clark's parents allowed him
to take drum playing lessons.
Clark soon "took pleasure in
doing housework. I wanted to
prove to myself and everyone
else that I could do it. I really
wanted to be a competent
blind person, if I was going to
be blind."
Greg Fowler, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering,
said "blindness is much more
of an inconvenience than a dis
ability. People tend to put me
in a class without understand
ing what I'm really like,"
Fowler said. He added that his
feelings aren't any different
from other people he knows.
"People have such a distorted
image of things. It's frustrat
ing."
But Fowler said he tries not
to become angry about his
blindness. "You could spend

your life being angry rather
than doing the things you want
to do. There's nothing to do
except accept it. It wouldn't get
me anywhere to be miserable
about it all the time."
John DeLuca, a first-year law
student here, went blind from
glaucoma, a congenital dis
ease, when he was nine years
old. "It's an irrevocable fact of
life," he said. "But with
changes in technology, of
course I hope that one day
something will come along to
change it. If I'm depressed
about something, being blind
always seems to add to it and
make things worse. I tend to
ask why I was the unlucky one
to be struck down by this un
fairness. Why me?"
