## Michael Economides Iran and the U.S. 
### 
Nowhere has U.S. foreign policy been more
short-sighted than in Iran. Although post World
War II U.S. diplomacy has often spelled catas
trophy for this country, the mess now brewing
in Iran could easily outstrip all combined. In the
name of economic and strategic interests of
dubious duration, the U.S. has installed one of
the most ruthless, decadent and alienated re
gimes in modern history. Although no one can
deny Iran's immensely important position, the
losses that can be inflicted on the U.S. by sup
porting the shah are difficult to fathom.
On October 31, President Jimmy Carter is
sued a statement praising the shah for his
"move towards democracy." He went on to say:
"Our friendship and our alliance with Iran is one
of our important bases on which our entire
foreign policy depends."
Carter is at best naive in view of the martial
law, the continuous rioting, the killings and the
paralysis in Iran because of massive strikes. He
may even be deliberate because the attitude
towards Iran is not an isolated phenomenon in
U.S. foreign policy.
The U.S. government does not seem to be
comfortable in relating with foreign govern
ments as equals. Small time dictators are prefer
red over democratically elected regimes. Sev
eral theories have attempted to explain this
phenomenon. Whatever the case, these tactics
have resulted in worldwide animosity towards
the U.S.
It is not difficult to extract examples from re
cent history. Many academic disciplines utilize
"history matching" or "a posteriori" data to
forecast the future. The Indochina debacle
should have given ample warning to U.S. policy
makers of things to come in other parts of the
world. It is unlikely that one would doubt some
sort of relationship between the type of U.S.
involvement in Cambodia and the carnage un
derway in that country now.
There is a direct correlation between the
widespread anti-Americanism prevalent in
Greece and the seven-year junta reign. Obvious
hints of hatred towards the U.S. are emanating
from Chile, other Latin American countries, the
Philippines and Pakistan. Who could prevent or
even blame these countries from turning their
long sufferings into direct animosity towards the
U.S. upon gaining their freedom?
The reactions of most U.S. citizens to argu
ments of this sort range from hostility to disbe
lief. Hostility, because how could this "greatest
democracy" be responsible for all this? Disbe
lief, because how could the U.S. be physically
able to do all the things that are claimed?

For a number of reasons, including an overly
simplistic and at times yellow press, American
people are normally uninformed. The most
overwhelming impression that a foreigner has
upon arriving in the U.S., is how oblivious
Americans are to what is perpetrated in their
"interest."
Yet the evidence of U.S. involvement in dic
tatorships is there. It is not difficult to imagine a
general (i.e. Pinochet, Papadopoullos, Zia, Mar
cos) in a country lacking a long history of
democratic institutions to have ambitions for
higher offices. A few tanks and a suitcase with
money can be sufficient to destroy an already
fragile democracy. U.S. involvement can beany
thing from tacit approval to outright planning
and instigation.
In the case of Iran, according to William
Colby, former CIA chief, the "installation of the
Shah to his throne" is the agency's "proudest
achievement."
In 1953, the shah, with both clandestine and
overt aid from the U.S. State Department and
the CIA, overthrew the elected legitimate gov
ernment of Mossadegh and established an ex
ceedingly repressive regime. It is unnecessary
to ennumerate the shah's transgressions, his
secret police, Savvak, has been synonymous
with torture and reign by terror. The U.S. in
volvement in his regime has been heavy and
visible. Billions of dollars in military hardware
have been pumped into Iran. Tens of thousands
of U.S. "advisors" are in that country.
In response, the shah has been a most faithful
U.S. oil supplier and the "policeman" of the
Persian Gulf. It is the oil connection and Russia's
expansionism that are the most frequent jus
tificatins for the support that the shah receives
from the U.S. Yet it should be obvious that a
democratic government in Iran would surely
have the U.S. and the West as its best custom
ers. But the "instability" of a democracy is not
preferred over the "stability" of the shah's re
gime.
It is in the long term interests of the U.S. to
abandon the shah and all the other dictators
around the world. What options does the U.S.
have if the shah is toppled from within and all
the hostility errupts? It should be obvious to
anyone that the shah's days are numbered and
that a U.S. disavowal would be felt in Iran. The
U.S. has a lot to gain from such a gesture. It
stands to lose immeasurably from the reverse.

world. It is unlikely that one would doubt some
sort of relationship between the type of U.S.
involvement in Cambodia and the carnage un
derway in that country now.
There is a direct correlation between the
widespread anti-Americanism prevalent in
Greece and the seven-year junta reign. Obvious
hints of hatred towards the U.S. are emanating
from Chile, other Latin American countries, the
Philippines and Pakistan. Who could prevent or
even blame these countries from turning their
long sufferings into direct animosity towards the
U.S. upon gaining their freedom?
The reactions of most U.S. citizens to argu
ments of this sort range from hostility to disbe
lief. Hostility, because how could this "greatest
democracy" be responsible for all this? Disbe
lief, because how could the U.S. be physically
able to do all the things that are claimed?

For a number of reasons, including an overly
simplistic and at times yellow press, American
people are normally uninformed. The most
overwhelming impression that a foreigner has
upon arriving in the U.S., is how oblivious
Americans are to what is perpetrated in their
"interest."
Yet the evidence of U.S. involvement in dic
tatorships is there. It is not difficult to imagine a
general (i.e. Pinochet, Papadopoullos, Zia, Mar
cos) in a country lacking a long history of
democratic institutions to have ambitions for
higher offices. A few tanks and a suitcase with
money can be sufficient to destroy an already
fragile democracy. U.S. involvement can beany
thing from tacit approval to outright planning
and instigation.
In the case of Iran, according to William
Colby, former CIA chief, the "installation of the
Shah to his throne" is the agency's "proudest
achievement."
In 1953, the shah, with both clandestine and
overt aid from the U.S. State Department and
the CIA, overthrew the elected legitimate gov
ernment of Mossadegh and established an ex
ceedingly repressive regime. It is unnecessary
to ennumerate the shah's transgressions, his
secret police, Savvak, has been synonymous
with torture and reign by terror. The U.S. in
volvement in his regime has been heavy and
visible. Billions of dollars in military hardware
have been pumped into Iran. Tens of thousands
of U.S. "advisors" are in that country.
In response, the shah has been a most faithful
U.S. oil supplier and the "policeman" of the
Persian Gulf. It is the oil connection and Russia's
expansionism that are the most frequent jus
tificatins for the support that the shah receives
from the U.S. Yet it should be obvious that a
democratic government in Iran would surely
have the U.S. and the West as its best custom
ers. But the "instability" of a democracy is not
preferred over the "stability" of the shah's re
gime.
It is in the long term interests of the U.S. to
abandon the shah and all the other dictators
around the world. What options does the U.S.
have if the shah is toppled from within and all
the hostility errupts? It should be obvious to
anyone that the shah's days are numbered and
that a U.S. disavowal would be felt in Iran. The
U.S. has a lot to gain from such a gesture. It
stands to lose immeasurably from the reverse.

Nowhere has U.S. foreign policy been more
short-sighted than in Iran. Although post World
War II U.S. diplomacy has often spelled catas
trophy for this country, the mess now brewing
in Iran could easily outstrip all combined. In the
name of economic and strategic interests of
dubious duration, the U.S. has installed one of
the most ruthless, decadent and alienated re
gimes in modern history. Although no one can
deny Iran's immensely important position, the
losses that can be inflicted on the U.S. by sup
porting the shah are difficult to fathom.
On October 31, President Jimmy Carter is
sued a statement praising the shah for his
"move towards democracy." He went on to say:
"Our friendship and our alliance with Iran is one
of our important bases on which our entire
foreign policy depends."
Carter is at best naive in view of the martial
law, the continuous rioting, the killings and the
paralysis in Iran because of massive strikes. He
may even be deliberate because the attitude
towards Iran is not an isolated phenomenon in
U.S. foreign policy.
The U.S. government does not seem to be
comfortable in relating with foreign govern
ments as equals. Small time dictators are prefer
red over democratically elected regimes. Sev
eral theories have attempted to explain this
phenomenon. Whatever the case, these tactics
have resulted in worldwide animosity towards
the U.S.
It is not difficult to extract examples from re
cent history. Many academic disciplines utilize
"history matching" or "a posteriori" data to
forecast the future. The Indochina debacle
should have given ample warning to U.S. policy
makers of things to come in other parts of the
world. It is unlikely that one would doubt some
sort of relationship between the type of U.S.

Colby, former CIA chief, the "installation of the
Shah to his throne" is the agency's "proudest
achievement."
In 1953, the shah, with both clandestine and
overt aid from the U.S. State Department and
the CIA, overthrew the elected legitimate gov
ernment of Mossadegh and established an ex
ceedingly repressive regime. It is unnecessary
to ennumerate the shah's transgressions, his
secret police, Savvak, has been synonymous
with torture and reign by terror. The U.S. in
volvement in his regime has been heavy and
visible. Billions of dollars in military hardware
have been pumped into Iran. Tens of thousands
of U.S. "advisors" are in that country.
In response, the shah has been a most faithful
U.S. oil supplier and the "policeman" of the
Persian Gulf. It is the oil connection and Russia's
expansionism that are the most frequent jus
tificatins for the support that the shah receives
from the U.S. Yet it should be obvious that a
democratic government in Iran would surely
have the U.S. and the West as its best custom
ers. But the "instability" of a democracy is not
preferred over the "stability" of the shah's re
gime.
It is in the long term interests of the U.S. to
abandon the shah and all the other dictators
around the world. What options does the U.S.
have if the shah is toppled from within and all
the hostility errupts? It should be obvious to
anyone that the shah's days are numbered and
that a U.S. disavowal would be felt in Iran. The
U.S. has a lot to gain from such a gesture. It
stands to lose immeasurably from the reverse.
