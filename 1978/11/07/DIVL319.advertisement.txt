Quality of Product/Quality of Life
The TOTAL Fluke Package
Engineering design excellence at John Fluke Company means more to
us than providing an environment of recognized professionalism. Our
major asset is our people, like you, that want and get immediate
"hands-on" design responsibility — people that are expected to make
significant contributions to our continued rapid growth. To us, engineer
ing excellence comes not only from providing our people an opportunity
for accelerated growth and recognition but also from an environment
that offers the outstanding recreational opportunities found only in the
Pacific Northwest.
Graduating BSEE's and MSEE's, spend a few minutes with us to dis
cuss your TOTAL career needs. A John Fluke Company representative
will be interviewing on campus Wednesday, November 8, 1978. A
special "brown bag" session will be held Thursday in classroom ERL
103 between noon and 1:00 pm to give you an opportunity to discuss
with a Fluke Representative engineering life and growth opportunities at
John Fluke Company. Quality of Product/Quality of Life — The Total
Fluke Package that has nurtured our design excellence. Contact your
| placement center to schedule interview times.
