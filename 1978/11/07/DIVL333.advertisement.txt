Three priests, once upon a time, decided to give
up the doth and pursue life in the outside world
Being agrarian in nature they moved to a little
town and set out building a greenhouse in which
to grow and plants Their greenhouse
became a showcase of strange plants from all
over, and they soon did a good business One
day. however, a little boy from the village wan
dered into their shop, and was tragically eaten by
a huge African man-eating water lily
The townspeople were, quite understandably,
upset at this and they tried to force the priests to
leave Despite all kinds of threats, pleas, and
offers, the priests remained firm They wanted to
stay There was only one person in the town who,
it was thought, could scare them off, and that was
Hugh the Blacksmith Hugh was an affable sort,
though, and did not want to cause the priests any
trouble But the Mayor had a nice daughter, and
(ahem) something was arranged The next day
Hugh went up to the greenhouse, ranted, raved
and flexed his muscles and the priests ran away,
never to return. All lived happily ever after
Moral: Only Hugh can prevent florist friars

Is now accepting jokes — short, long, dull ugly,
cheery, peppy or whatever Each week all en
tries will be judged by your 112 nendly neighborhood
Classified Ads staff and the two best jokes will
be printed in the JOKES section The winners will
be generously awarded a coupon which they will
be able to pick up at the Daily Office for the pizza
of their choice at La Ptaena. What a deal'
Three priests, once upon a time, decided to give
up the doth and pursue life in the outside world
Being agrarian in nature they moved to a little
town and set out building a greenhouse in which
to grow and plants Their greenhouse
became a showcase of strange plants from all
over, and they soon did a good business One
day. however, a little boy from the village wan
dered into their shop, and was tragically eaten by
a huge African man-eating water lily
The townspeople were, quite understandably,
upset at this and they tried to force the priests to
leave Despite all kinds of threats, pleas, and
offers, the priests remained firm They wanted to
stay There was only one person in the town who,
it was thought, could scare them off, and that was
Hugh the Blacksmith Hugh was an affable sort,
though, and did not want to cause the priests any
trouble But the Mayor had a nice daughter, and
(ahem) something was arranged The next day
Hugh went up to the greenhouse, ranted, raved
and flexed his muscles and the priests ran away,
never to return. All lived happily ever after
Moral: Only Hugh can prevent florist friars

Three priests, once upon a time, decided to give
up the doth and pursue life in the outside world
Being agrarian in nature they moved to a little
town and set out building a greenhouse in which
to grow and plants Their greenhouse
became a showcase of strange plants from all
over, and they soon did a good business One
day. however, a little boy from the village wan
dered into their shop, and was tragically eaten by
a huge African man-eating water lily
The townspeople were, quite understandably,
upset at this and they tried to force the priests to
leave Despite all kinds of threats, pleas, and
offers, the priests remained firm They wanted to
stay There was only one person in the town who,
it was thought, could scare them off, and that was
Hugh the Blacksmith Hugh was an affable sort,
though, and did not want to cause the priests any
trouble But the Mayor had a nice daughter, and
(ahem) something was arranged The next day
Hugh went up to the greenhouse, ranted, raved
and flexed his muscles and the priests ran away,
never to return. All lived happily ever after
Moral: Only Hugh can prevent florist friars
