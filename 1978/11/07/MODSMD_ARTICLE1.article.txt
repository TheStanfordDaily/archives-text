# Old pipe blamed for Meyer book losses
## 
### TONY RUPERT 
The University began an investiga
tion yesterday of the possible causes
of the fire pipe break that flooded the
Meyer Library basement early Satur
day morning, causing $1 million in
book damages.
"There are several water lines in
the area, some of them laid by the
Dickman Construction Co., the con
tractor on the job/' said Robert Beth,
director of risk management and in
surance here. ' We turned the water
on in each pipe for a short while to
determine which line broke and it
turned out to be a fire line not laid by
Dickman."
The ruptured pipe was laid 12 years
ago, Beth said. The point where it
broke was beneath a newly con
structed patio of the Green Library
addition adjacent to Meyer Library.
Beth said he was unable to com
ment on whether the break was
caused by construction going on in
the area, adding that the University is
in the process of hiring an engineer
ing consultant to see if the pipe
might have been defective.
Beth also said that the water leaked
into the library because of holes dril
led in the library walls. "Part of the
contract," Beth explained, "called
for the utilities for Meyer and the

Green addition to be combined into
one system.
"For this reason, the subcontrac
tor on the job, the Valley Sheet Metal
Co., cut five holes six inches in
diameter in the basement wall," Beth
said. "However, they failed to plug
up these holes for over the weekend
when they weren't at work."
The University is "very unhappy"
over this omission, Beth said.
Jason Mavis, director of service
operations here said he is investigat
ing the possibility that the break at
Meyer could be related to the break
at Cedro.
The Cedro break occurred at 11:30
p.m. Friday and the Meyer break oc
curred at 2:51 a.m. Saturday. Mavis
said that all of the University's water
comes from the same source and
then is distributed on campus. How
ever, he said that it was "extremely
unlikely" that the two breaks were
related.
"The entire Stanford system has a
series of pressure-reducing valves,"
Mavis explained. "In order for the
two breaks to have been caused by
the same surge of water, there would
have to have been a simultaneous
breakdown of these valves. While
this is a possibility we are looking
into, we don't expect it to be true."

in the process of hiring an engineer
ing consultant to see if the pipe
might have been defective.
Beth also said that the water leaked
into the library because of holes dril
led in the library walls. "Part of the
contract," Beth explained, "called
for the utilities for Meyer and the

Green addition to be combined into
one system.
"For this reason, the subcontrac
tor on the job, the Valley Sheet Metal
Co., cut five holes six inches in
diameter in the basement wall," Beth
said. "However, they failed to plug
up these holes for over the weekend
when they weren't at work."
The University is "very unhappy"
over this omission, Beth said.
Jason Mavis, director of service
operations here said he is investigat
ing the possibility that the break at
Meyer could be related to the break
at Cedro.
The Cedro break occurred at 11:30
p.m. Friday and the Meyer break oc
curred at 2:51 a.m. Saturday. Mavis
said that all of the University's water
comes from the same source and
then is distributed on campus. How
ever, he said that it was "extremely
unlikely" that the two breaks were
related.
"The entire Stanford system has a
series of pressure-reducing valves,"
Mavis explained. "In order for the
two breaks to have been caused by
the same surge of water, there would
have to have been a simultaneous
breakdown of these valves. While
this is a possibility we are looking
into, we don't expect it to be true."
