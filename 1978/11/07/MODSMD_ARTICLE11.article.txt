## Hargadon letter potentially harmful 
### 
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
has written a widely circulated letter
expressing the belief of the Under
graduate Admissions Committee that
many entering college students are
academically ill-prepared.
Despite an early disclaimer, the letter
makes it clear that what is really troubl
ing the committee is that today's stu
dents just don't seem to measure up to
their predecessors. Test scores are
down and faculty everywhere have
been complaining that entering stu
dents can't think, can't write and pos
sess "little in the way of prior know
ledge."
While solid academic preparation is
certainly one of the most important
goals of schooling, Hargadon's remedy
is hardly startling or original. He coun
sels high school students to follow a
traditional academic program em
phasizing English, math, history, sci
ence and foreign language. For their
part, schools are advised to revive the
days when "an English course (was) in
fact an English course, and not simply a
course devoted to one or another social
policy question." Thus, Stanford has
officially added its voice to those who
have been decrying what they view as
the watered down new courses of the
nation's high schools.

While solid academic preparation is
certainly one of the most important
goals of schooling, Hargadon's reac
tionaryapproach fails to get to the heart
of the problem. It has the potential to
do more harm than good.
To see why, let us consider the di
lemma of a studious high school girl
who has to choose between a French
course and one in jazz appreciation.
On the one hand, French is a tradi
tional, well-respected "solid" which
will look good on.her transcript.
However, if she speaks to veterans of
high school French courses, she will
learn that the classes tend to be quite
boring, often focusing on memoriza
tion of vocabulary lists and recitation of
simple-minded dialogues. Worse yet,
she will find out that former French
students hardly ever have occasion to
speak French and that few would be
able to do so if an opportunity arose.
On the other hand, jazz appreciation
is a subject she would probably enjoy.
It might help her to develop an interest
which could bring her pleasure every
day for the rest of her life. Most sig
nificantly, if she truly cares about her
education, there is no inherent reason
that the course should not be rigorous.
A well taught jazz appreciation
course could be a vehicle for the de

velopment of research and writing
skills, critical thinking and perhaps
even some understanding of the
mathematics of music. However, there
is or? serious drawback. As she has
now been told by the Admissions
Committee, taking such courses may
weaken her chances for admission to
college.
The point is that Stanford (which it
self has more than 50 academic depar
tents and thousands of rigorous
courses including costume construc
tion, cosmic evolution, and the
psychology of sex roles) should be en
couraging diversity, not uniformity, in
the high school curriculum. It should
be telling schools that today's students
have a wide variety of interests and as
pirations and that students learn best in
courses which match their interests.
Above all, it should be reminding
them that skills which are important for
all people such as thinking, speaking,
reading and writing can be developed
as well in art courses, shop courses,
and even courses which focus on social
policy questions as they can in tradi
tional science or history.
Hargadon's letter makes some valid
points. Students who look only for the
easiest possible courses are cheating
themselves. High schools which don't

give students sufficient opportunity to
develop the ability to think and express
themselves are shirking their respon
sibilities. (So are universities which
complain that students are doing poor
work while rewarding them with the
highest grades ever attained by any
generation).
However, the remedy does not lie in
a return to the standard curriculum of
the past. Rather, what is needed is a
genuine effort to design courses which
satisfy student interests while at the
same time requiring them to develop
the skills they will want and need in the
future.
There is an unfortunate tendency in
education to react to problems by in
voking the tried and true methods of
the past. When this happens, it is im
portant to remember why these
methods were rejected in the first
place. Many of the recent curriculum
changes occured in response to legiti
mate student demands for an educa
tion which is both useful and enjoy
able. These demands remain valid to
day. There in no way conflict with the
need for courses which are challenging
and productive.

methods were rejected in the first
place. Many of the recent curriculum
changes occured in response to legiti

need for courses which are challenging
and productive.

Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
has written a widely circulated letter
expressing the belief of the Under
graduate Admissions Committee that
many entering college students are
academically ill-prepared.
Despite an early disclaimer, the letter
makes it clear that what is really troubl
ing the committee is that today's stu
dents just don't seem to measure up to
their predecessors. Test scores are
down and faculty everywhere have
been complaining that entering stu
dents can't think, can't write and pos
sess "little in the way of prior know
ledge."
While solid academic preparation is
certainly one of the most important
goals of schooling, Hargadon's remedy
is hardly startling or original. He coun
sels high school students to follow a
traditional academic program em
phasizing English, math, history, sci
ence and foreign language. For their
part, schools are advised to revive the
days when "an English course (was) in
fact an English course, and not simply a
course devoted to one or another social
policy question." Thus, Stanford has
officially added its voice to those who
have been decrying what they view as
the watered down new courses of the
nation's high schools.

While solid academic preparation is
certainly one of the most important
goals of schooling, Hargadon's reac
tionaryapproach fails to get to the heart
of the problem. It has the potential to
do more harm than good.
To see why, let us consider the di
lemma of a studious high school girl
who has to choose between a French
course and one in jazz appreciation.
On the one hand, French is a tradi
tional, well-respected "solid" which
will look good on.her transcript.
However, if she speaks to veterans of
high school French courses, she will
learn that the classes tend to be quite
boring, often focusing on memoriza
tion of vocabulary lists and recitation of
simple-minded dialogues. Worse yet,
she will find out that former French
students hardly ever have occasion to
speak French and that few would be
able to do so if an opportunity arose.
On the other hand, jazz appreciation
is a subject she would probably enjoy.
It might help her to develop an interest
which could bring her pleasure every
day for the rest of her life. Most sig
nificantly, if she truly cares about her
education, there is no inherent reason
that the course should not be rigorous.
A well taught jazz appreciation
course could be a vehicle for the de

velopment of research and writing
skills, critical thinking and perhaps
even some understanding of the
mathematics of music. However, there
is or? serious drawback. As she has
now been told by the Admissions
Committee, taking such courses may
weaken her chances for admission to
college.
The point is that Stanford (which it
self has more than 50 academic depar
tents and thousands of rigorous
courses including costume construc
tion, cosmic evolution, and the
psychology of sex roles) should be en
couraging diversity, not uniformity, in
the high school curriculum. It should
be telling schools that today's students
have a wide variety of interests and as
pirations and that students learn best in
courses which match their interests.
Above all, it should be reminding
them that skills which are important for
all people such as thinking, speaking,
reading and writing can be developed
as well in art courses, shop courses,
and even courses which focus on social
policy questions as they can in tradi
tional science or history.
Hargadon's letter makes some valid
points. Students who look only for the
easiest possible courses are cheating
themselves. High schools which don't

give students sufficient opportunity to
develop the ability to think and express
themselves are shirking their respon
sibilities. (So are universities which
complain that students are doing poor
work while rewarding them with the
highest grades ever attained by any
generation).
However, the remedy does not lie in
a return to the standard curriculum of
the past. Rather, what is needed is a
genuine effort to design courses which
satisfy student interests while at the
same time requiring them to develop
the skills they will want and need in the
future.
There is an unfortunate tendency in
education to react to problems by in
voking the tried and true methods of
the past. When this happens, it is im
portant to remember why these
methods were rejected in the first
place. Many of the recent curriculum
changes occured in response to legiti
mate student demands for an educa
tion which is both useful and enjoy
