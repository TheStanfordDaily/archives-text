## U.S. has low awareness of Canada 
### 
In the book Between
Friends/Entre Amis (Canada's
Bicentennial gift to the United
States), Vincent Massy (a
former Govenor General of
Canada) was quoted as saying:
"It (the border) has long been
indefensible, but realists have
observed that the disparity of
population has made arma
ments for one country futile
and for the other side superf
luous."
This quote sums up the basic
elephant-mouse philosophy
(with Canada being an ex
tremely large mouse) that
plagues United States (not
American)-Canada relation
ships today. While it is true the
mouse is always aware of the
elephants whereabouts, the
elephant often shows a distinct
disregard for the mouse's in
tegrity.
The elephant-mouse anal
ogy is a good one but it must be
further clarified. The United
States does dominate Canada
economically, culturally and so
cially. This does not mean to
say that there is no Canadian
economy, culture or social pat
terns (because there are), but
rather that Canadians are very
much aware of Exxon, Hol
lywood and Fear of Flying.
Some argue that awareness
is too great and have taken
steps to reclaim what has been
lost to foreigners (i.e. the Un
ited States). Their efforts are to
be commended but
nationalism often breathes in
very narrow confines, and
more Canadians are, I think,
very willing to work, live and
trade with the United States —
as long as they get a larger slice
of the pie. The common view
point is that what marital prob
lems do exist are easily solva
ble because of the goodwill
and willingness on both sides.
This brings us to the central
problem. How does one go
about engineering better rela
tions between two nations?
The most obvious and best
reply is by trying to understand
how the other nation operates,
thinks and feels. On this ac
count, the United States is
grossly negligent.
The problem, however, lies
deeper than this generaliza
tion. The United States is gen
erally ignorant about Canada
— its largest trading partner, its
neighbour and most depend

able ally. Why is this so? The
fault lies with its educational
institutions (both high schools
and universities like Stanford).
In Canadian high schools,
the geography and history of
the United States is studied
(along with that of Canada, Bri
tain and assorted other coun
tries). Its literature, govern
ment and foreign policy are all
carefully examined. This gives
the average Canadian a good
working knowledge of his
neighbour, and he is appalled
to find his neighbour unable to
return the courtesy.
I remember once watching a
lady stand dumbfounded on a
United States game show un
able to answer the question,
"Which country in North
America (there are only three)
borders on three oceans?" I've
seen skis on the roofs of U.S.
cars in Toronto (where is that?)
in mid-July, and the driver anx
iously looking for snow in the
90 degree heat.
I was amazed last year at hav
ing to explain to the people in
my dorm that Canada is not a
colony; it is not all French; we
do live in houses; yes, there is
a summer; our capital is called
Ottawa; that we have 10 pro
vinces (not states); and that the
Canadiens are a better hockey
team than the Bruins. Also that
we have a prime minister, not a
president.
Here I am at Stanford, a lead
ing university in the United
States, amongst a student elite
(who are supposedly known
for their intellect and not their
good looks), and the barest
facts about Canada were un
known. The University fares lit
tle better. A quick look at
Hoover Library reveals that in
foreign newspapers, Stanford
only subscribes to one major
(perhaps) Canadian news
paper Le Devoir (which is
French).
The thoughts of the Montreal
Star, Toronto Globe and Mail,
or Vancouver Sun are conve
niently ignored — instead
Stanford receives some
obscure Canadian papers like
Hrvatski Clas (a Ukranian Pub
lication), and that well known
tabloid People's Canada Daily
News. A brief check at only the
"air mail" newspaper section,
revealed four major Portugese
newspapers, three Rumanian,
three Polish, and two Argenti

nian.
There is no Canadian Studies
program offered at Stanford,
and there isn't even a single
course offered on Canada in
the History, English, Compara
tive Literature, or Modern
Thought and Literature de
partments. Needless to say,
other and more obscure
nationalities and their trap
pings (i.e. Old Norse) are well
represented. And Stanford is
supposedly one of the top uni
versities in the nation. What
must the others be like!
What then is the solution? A
most unrealistic one would be
to require Canadian history,
geography and literature to be
taught in high schools. Obvi
ously, from the state of world
affairs today, Canada's pre
occupation with the United
States is larger than the reverse
case. Itis unrealistictodemand
that a total re-orientation of
"south of the border" thinking
should be made so people can
educate themselves on

Canada. Canada is only one of
many concerns for the United
States, but we are also your
neighbours.
Perhaps you should find out
the name of ourprime minis
ter, realize that there is a threat
of secession from Quebec,
that Moose Jaw is a name of a
city and not a disease and that
Queen Elizabeth is also the
Queen of Canada. The high
schools (orat least universities)
should offer courses about
Canada so that an awareness
may be initiated at the educa
tional level.
Perhaps if we spoke a diffe
rent language (and six million
of us do), there would be more
cultural awareness, but the
simple fact that the majority
speak English would seem to
facilitate mutual understand
ing. It takes a little effort, reaps
many intangible rewards and
opens a new land to explora
tion.

economy, culture or social pat
terns (because there are), but
rather that Canadians are very
much aware of Exxon, Hol
lywood and Fear of Flying.
Some argue that awareness
is too great and have taken
steps to reclaim what has been
lost to foreigners (i.e. the Un
ited States). Their efforts are to
be commended but
nationalism often breathes in
very narrow confines, and
more Canadians are, I think,
very willing to work, live and
trade with the United States —
as long as they get a larger slice
of the pie. The common view
point is that what marital prob
lems do exist are easily solva
ble because of the goodwill
and willingness on both sides.
This brings us to the central
problem. How does one go
about engineering better rela
tions between two nations?
The most obvious and best
reply is by trying to understand
how the other nation operates,
thinks and feels. On this ac
count, the United States is
grossly negligent.
The problem, however, lies
deeper than this generaliza
tion. The United States is gen
erally ignorant about Canada
— its largest trading partner, its
neighbour and most depend

able ally. Why is this so? The
fault lies with its educational
institutions (both high schools
and universities like Stanford).
In Canadian high schools,
the geography and history of
the United States is studied
(along with that of Canada, Bri
tain and assorted other coun
tries). Its literature, govern
ment and foreign policy are all
carefully examined. This gives
the average Canadian a good
working knowledge of his
neighbour, and he is appalled
to find his neighbour unable to
return the courtesy.
I remember once watching a
lady stand dumbfounded on a
United States game show un
able to answer the question,
"Which country in North
America (there are only three)
borders on three oceans?" I've
seen skis on the roofs of U.S.
cars in Toronto (where is that?)
in mid-July, and the driver anx
iously looking for snow in the
90 degree heat.
I was amazed last year at hav
ing to explain to the people in
my dorm that Canada is not a
colony; it is not all French; we
do live in houses; yes, there is
a summer; our capital is called
Ottawa; that we have 10 pro
vinces (not states); and that the
Canadiens are a better hockey
team than the Bruins. Also that
we have a prime minister, not a
president.
Here I am at Stanford, a lead
ing university in the United
States, amongst a student elite
(who are supposedly known
for their intellect and not their
good looks), and the barest
facts about Canada were un
known. The University fares lit
tle better. A quick look at
Hoover Library reveals that in
foreign newspapers, Stanford
only subscribes to one major
(perhaps) Canadian news
paper Le Devoir (which is
French).
The thoughts of the Montreal
Star, Toronto Globe and Mail,
or Vancouver Sun are conve
niently ignored — instead
Stanford receives some
obscure Canadian papers like
Hrvatski Clas (a Ukranian Pub
lication), and that well known
tabloid People's Canada Daily
News. A brief check at only the
"air mail" newspaper section,
revealed four major Portugese
newspapers, three Rumanian,
three Polish, and two Argenti

nian.
There is no Canadian Studies
program offered at Stanford,
and there isn't even a single
course offered on Canada in
the History, English, Compara
tive Literature, or Modern
Thought and Literature de
partments. Needless to say,
other and more obscure
nationalities and their trap
pings (i.e. Old Norse) are well
represented. And Stanford is
supposedly one of the top uni
versities in the nation. What
must the others be like!
What then is the solution? A
most unrealistic one would be
to require Canadian history,
geography and literature to be
taught in high schools. Obvi
ously, from the state of world
affairs today, Canada's pre
occupation with the United
States is larger than the reverse
case. Itis unrealistictodemand
that a total re-orientation of
"south of the border" thinking
should be made so people can
educate themselves on

Canada. Canada is only one of
many concerns for the United
States, but we are also your
neighbours.
Perhaps you should find out
the name of ourprime minis

of secession from Quebec,
that Moose Jaw is a name of a
city and not a disease and that
Queen Elizabeth is also the
Queen of Canada. The high
schools (orat least universities)
should offer courses about
Canada so that an awareness
may be initiated at the educa
tional level.
Perhaps if we spoke a diffe
rent language (and six million
of us do), there would be more
cultural awareness, but the
simple fact that the majority
speak English would seem to
facilitate mutual understand

The problem, however, lies
deeper than this generaliza
tion. The United States is gen
erally ignorant about Canada
— its largest trading partner, its
neighbour and most depend

able ally. Why is this so? The
fault lies with its educational
institutions (both high schools
and universities like Stanford).
In Canadian high schools,
the geography and history of
the United States is studied
(along with that of Canada, Bri
tain and assorted other coun
tries). Its literature, govern
ment and foreign policy are all
carefully examined. This gives
the average Canadian a good
working knowledge of his
neighbour, and he is appalled
to find his neighbour unable to
return the courtesy.
I remember once watching a
lady stand dumbfounded on a
United States game show un
able to answer the question,
"Which country in North
America (there are only three)
borders on three oceans?" I've
seen skis on the roofs of U.S.
cars in Toronto (where is that?)
in mid-July, and the driver anx
iously looking for snow in the
90 degree heat.
I was amazed last year at hav
ing to explain to the people in
my dorm that Canada is not a
colony; it is not all French; we
do live in houses; yes, there is
a summer; our capital is called
Ottawa; that we have 10 pro
vinces (not states); and that the
Canadiens are a better hockey
team than the Bruins. Also that
we have a prime minister, not a
president.
Here I am at Stanford, a lead
ing university in the United
States, amongst a student elite
(who are supposedly known
for their intellect and not their
good looks), and the barest
facts about Canada were un
known. The University fares lit
tle better. A quick look at
Hoover Library reveals that in
foreign newspapers, Stanford
only subscribes to one major
(perhaps) Canadian news
paper Le Devoir (which is
French).
The thoughts of the Montreal
Star, Toronto Globe and Mail,
or Vancouver Sun are conve
niently ignored — instead
Stanford receives some
obscure Canadian papers like
Hrvatski Clas (a Ukranian Pub
lication), and that well known
tabloid People's Canada Daily
News. A brief check at only the
"air mail" newspaper section,
revealed four major Portugese
newspapers, three Rumanian,
three Polish, and two Argenti

nian.
There is no Canadian Studies
program offered at Stanford,
and there isn't even a single
course offered on Canada in
the History, English, Compara
tive Literature, or Modern
Thought and Literature de
partments. Needless to say,
other and more obscure
nationalities and their trap
pings (i.e. Old Norse) are well
represented. And Stanford is
supposedly one of the top uni
versities in the nation. What
must the others be like!
What then is the solution? A
most unrealistic one would be
to require Canadian history,
geography and literature to be
taught in high schools. Obvi
ously, from the state of world
affairs today, Canada's pre
occupation with the United
States is larger than the reverse
case. Itis unrealistictodemand
that a total re-orientation of
"south of the border" thinking
should be made so people can
educate themselves on

Canada. Canada is only one of
many concerns for the United
States, but we are also your
neighbours.
Perhaps you should find out
the name of ourprime minis
ter, realize that there is a threat
of secession from Quebec,
that Moose Jaw is a name of a
city and not a disease and that
Queen Elizabeth is also the
Queen of Canada. The high
schools (orat least universities)
should offer courses about
Canada so that an awareness
may be initiated at the educa
tional level.
Perhaps if we spoke a diffe
rent language (and six million
of us do), there would be more
cultural awareness, but the
simple fact that the majority
speak English would seem to
facilitate mutual understand
ing. It takes a little effort, reaps
many intangible rewards and
opens a new land to explora
tion.

In the book Between
Friends/Entre Amis (Canada's
Bicentennial gift to the United
States), Vincent Massy (a
former Govenor General of
Canada) was quoted as saying:
"It (the border) has long been
indefensible, but realists have
observed that the disparity of
population has made arma
ments for one country futile
and for the other side superf
luous."
This quote sums up the basic
elephant-mouse philosophy
(with Canada being an ex
tremely large mouse) that
plagues United States (not
American)-Canada relation
ships today. While it is true the
mouse is always aware of the
elephants whereabouts, the
elephant often shows a distinct
disregard for the mouse's in
tegrity.
The elephant-mouse anal
ogy is a good one but it must be
further clarified. The United
States does dominate Canada
economically, culturally and so
cially. This does not mean to
say that there is no Canadian
economy, culture or social pat
terns (because there are), but
rather that Canadians are very
much aware of Exxon, Hol
lywood and Fear of Flying.
Some argue that awareness
is too great and have taken
steps to reclaim what has been
lost to foreigners (i.e. the Un
ited States). Their efforts are to
be commended but
nationalism often breathes in
very narrow confines, and
more Canadians are, I think,
very willing to work, live and
trade with the United States —
as long as they get a larger slice
of the pie. The common view
point is that what marital prob
lems do exist are easily solva
ble because of the goodwill
and willingness on both sides.
This brings us to the central
problem. How does one go
about engineering better rela
tions between two nations?
The most obvious and best
reply is by trying to understand
how the other nation operates,
thinks and feels. On this ac
count, the United States is
grossly negligent.
The problem, however, lies
deeper than this generaliza
tion. The United States is gen
erally ignorant about Canada
— its largest trading partner, its
