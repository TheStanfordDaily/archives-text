# University to improve building accessibility
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
University officials plan to
spend more than $350,000 next
year to make the campus more
accessible to handicapped
persons.
In accordance with a federal
law passed last summer, all
"key, one-of-a-kind facilities"
must be modified for easy ac
cess to students with handi
capped mobility, said Steve
Schmidt, an associate planner
here.
"If we made all the buildings
easily accessible, the project
would cost millions of dollars,"
he explained. "Staff counsel
agreed that if the one-of-a-kind
facilities were modified, the
University would be within the
law."
Buildings to be altered in
clude Tresidder, Frost Am
phitheater, deCuerre recrea
tion complex and Encina Hall,
while restroom facilities and
elevators will be remodeled in
other major buildings on cam
pus.
Tresidder inaccessible
The second floor of Tresid
der Union is now virtually inac
cessible to wheelchair-bound
students. A small elevator in
the kitchen can take students
to Wells Fargo Bank and ASSU
offices on Tresidder's second

floor, but a key for the elevator
must first be obtained by the
manager.
"The whole purpose of the
law is to allow handicapped
persons to act independently
and not need an assistant
wherever they go," Schmidt
said.
Planners have designed a
long ramp extending from the
parking lot to the second floor.
This was the only place plan
ners could build a ramp with a
grade level small enough for
wheelchair travel, Schmidt
said.
Ramps and curb cuts will be
constructed at several points
on campus. The two steps lead
ing to the ticket office in Encina
Hall will be accompanied by a
ramp while the main entrance
steps to the Quad will be nar
rowed to allow room for ramps
on either side, thereby pre
serving the traditional sym
metry of the current design.
"We must respect the ar
chitecture of the buildings
when designing these
facilities," Schmidt said, ad

ding the Quad project will be
completed during the final ph
ases of buildings 460 and 120
reconstruction.
No changes will be made on
the stairs at Main "Green" Lib
rary because the new addition,
to be completed in September,
will be accessible to
wheelchair-bound students,
Schmidt said. But the stacks
will remain inaccessible and
handicapped students must
rely on the library's retrieval
services.
Few changes will be made on
the University's parking
facilities. Of the 12,000 parking
spaces on campus, 50 are de
signed for handicapped stu
dents. "We have about 70
more to go until one percent
are for handicapped persons,"
Schmidt said.
The handicapped spaces
may be used by persons tem
porarily handicapped, but,
Schmidt warned, unless a tem
porary sticker is attached to the
car bumper, the driver may re
turn to find a $25 parking ticket
attached to the car windshield.

Schmidt said the handicap
ped facilities construction on
campus is "really to the Uni
versity's own interests." Not
only will increased moderniza
tion result, but the University
can also open its doors to a
broader spectrum of students.
Schmidt foresees an in
creased enrollment of hand
icapped students here.
"It's an advantage to us to be
able to get a diverse student
body and to provide Stanford's
opportunities to as many
people as possible," Schmidt
said. "I'd speculate that when
handicapped students are ap
plying for college they keep in
mind that they want to go
somewhere that's accessible.
Word got out that Stanford
isn't very accessible, so they
either didn't apply or didn't en
roll."
The University now has 10
students with major physical
impairments, according to
Harold Boyd, an associate dean
in the Office of Student Affairs.
"These are students with
more obvious impairments,

such as blindness or confine
ment to a wheelchair," he said.
"I know there are probably
many more students who are
not visibly handicapped, and
we urge them that if they have a
need the University is not
meeting, they contact our of
fice so we can respond."
The University must follow
regulations established in the
new law by June 1980. There
will be no formal inspection of
the University's facilities un
less a grievance is filed with the
Office of Civil Rights in
Washington, D.C.
Schmidt added the Univer
sity does not expect to be to
tally finished with the project
after the $350,000 investment
to be made next year.
"It's ridiculous for us to
think we can make all the key
buildings accessible in six
months," he said. "We're just
trying to get the most out of
these first dollars."
He said officials would have
a much better idea of the pro
ject's total cost after the first
$350,000 is spent.

Bay Area resident Nancy Thomas was ticketed for parking in a
handicapped parking zone here. Though she had a broken leg at the
time of her arrest, Palo Alto police fined Thomas $25. She delivered a
check for the amount on a carefully painted cast.
