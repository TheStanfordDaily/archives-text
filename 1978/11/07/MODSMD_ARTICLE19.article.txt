# Career month for women scheduled for November
## 
### MONIKA GUTTMAN 
"The nature of women's
problems are different, no
matter how far they say we've
come," said Leslie Shatum,
one of the co-ordinators for
the campus program
"November: Career Month for
Women."
The program, which is spon
sored by the Inter-Sorority
Council (ISC), consists of a
month-long series of Tuesday
evening lectures designed to
inform women about the pro
cess of job application. Accord
ing to Shatum, the Career
Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) also is par
ticipating in the program.
"The CPPC helps students in
this area all the time," she said.
"But they've never had a prog
ram like this, which is geared
specifically towards women."
"Job-searching and inter
viewing and resume writing are
all practical skills," said
Yvonne Hailtz, program co
ordinator. "Everybody should
know how to find out what
they want to do. It's one of
those things that is easily
learned."
The four lectures will include
guest speakers from many dif
ferent fields. The topics will in
clude tonight's presentation

on "Resume Writing," "The
Truth About Grad Schools,"
"Interview Techniques" and
"Job Searching."
"We want to get past the
general and more into the
specifics of job searching,"
said Shatum, who stressed try
ing to involve as many indi
viduals as possible through
audience participation.
"Everywhere I go people are
asking 'what do you want to
do?' " said Hailtz. "A program
of this sort is definitely needed
here."
According to Shatum, an in
formal sutvey shows that "very
few women have ever thought
about the specifics of job hunt
ing." She also referred to a re
cent article in Campus Report
which pointed out that women
here seek jobs less aggres
sively than men.
"By the time you're a junior,
you should really be checking
into the job-hunting process,"
said Shatum.
"But the closer you come to
graduation, the more you want
to put it off," she added. "This
means you come out virtually
unprepared."
Career Month is supported
by the CPPC, SCIRE, the Stu
dent Employment Office and
Stanford-in-Business.
