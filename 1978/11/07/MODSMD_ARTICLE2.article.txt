# Committee report released
## Women lack confidence in job search 
### ALI WEBB 
Women see themselves as less
able to compete in the job market,
according to the annual report of the
Stanford Committee on the
Employment and Education of Wo
men.
Thecommittee, chaired by adjunct
Neurology Prof. Marion Smith, iden
tified several key areas that affect "a
woman's self-confidence in her own
potential value as an active con
tributor in her chosen field and her
own ability to make a good career
choice.
"The reasons for this relative lack
of self-confidence are probably
brought to Stanford as a part of a
woman's conditioning," the report
stated.
Career choices
According to Smith, one of the
problems covered by the report
deals with women's career choices.
Women experience greater difficul
ties in fulfilling career aspirations.
The generalizations in the report
are based in part on anecdotal evi
dence provided by the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center (CPPC),
including statements such as:
— Women are less likely than men
to apply for jobs for which they are
equally qualified. The more signific
ant the position, the less likely
women are to apply.
— Women seem less inquisitive
about the placement process.
— Women tend to be less aggres
sive in their job seeking efforts.
Ralph Keller, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center,
said, "Our basic philosophy is to
treat everyone that walks in the door

as an individual." The CPPC is sensi
tive to the needs of special groups
but they don't direct any particular
focus towards women, he said.
Tightening job market
The report cites the tightening job
market for both male and female
graduates and the influx of older
married women into careers as
further complicating the employ
ment of female graduates.
Keller noted that the lack of self
confidence displayed by female un
dergraduates is part of a nation-wide
trend. He cited a report by the As
sociation of American Medical Col
leges, the Graduate Records Exami
nation Board and the Law School
Admissions Council.
The survey reports that "fewer
women agree that they have the abil
ity to complete the advanced work
needed to become a doctor, lawyer
or university professor."
Lack of self-confidence
The data compiled by the report
also notes the "self confidence and
lower estimates of academic ability
on the part of women despite their
higher grades."
According to the Stanford report,
women now represent about 40 per
cent of the undergraduate majors
here. But degrees "awarded to
women in certain majors deviate far
from this 40 percent figure, indicat
ing that for various reasons some sex
stereotypic influence is felt in choos
ing a major and probably a future."
The area of greatest concern ex
pressed by the committee is the con
tinuing low proportion of women on
the faculty here.
"Only two appointments to the

ranks of associate and full professor,
among 30 in the past two years, have
been to women," according to the
report.
"The dependence solely on tradi
tional lines of communication, naive
belief in the efficacy of journal adver
tising, and other factors such as iner
tia result in very little that is affirma
tive in the Affirmative Action Prog
ram," stated the committee.
Correct steps
"It is possible to takeall the correct
steps and still not have a diverse fa
culty," commented President

Richard Lyman.
"It is the difference between
genuine efforts and paper efforts,"
he said.
Another area of impact noted by
the report is in residential education
and advising. The committee re
commended that "the University
provide more sensitivity training and
education towards expanding wo
men's options to the student and fa
culty advisers."
