# Ramen, sui mai, bao
## Teahouse reopens for business 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Since its grand opening Fri
day night, the People's
Teahouse in Wilbur has been
swamped with students trying
to overcome the summer-long
symptoms of "bao with
drawal."
The small Asian cafe next to
Madera House has served the
Stanford community for about
10 years, one worker esti
mated. And with the reopening
of the Teahouse every fall, stu
dents crowd back into the
"cafe" to relieve their cravings
forcha siu bao, a pork delicacy
wrapped in steamed dough.
Prices at the Teahouse range
from 10 cents for almond
Cookies to 35 cents for a bowl
of ramen, or spiced noodles.
Other Asian dishes include sui
mai, a pork and noodle snack,
and eight flavors of tea.
The Teahouse is a non-profit
project with all proceeds going
to community organizations
devoted to Asian activities,
explained Cathy Shimizu, one
of the four Teahouse mana
gers.
Workers are volunteers,
many of them past and present
residents of junipero, the
Asian-American theme house.
Employees make two runs to
San Francisco every week to
buy fresh delicacies and
wooden chopsticks at
wholesale prices, she added.
On a busy night, the
People's Teahouse will serve
about 150 students, one
worker said. While many sit
down at the low, Japanese
style tables to chat with
friends, others run in, grab
three or four baos and race
back to their textbooks. To add
to the Asian atmosphere, the
walls of the Teahouse are de
corated with Asian posters and
art.
The Teahouse is open seven
nights a week from 9 p.m. to

midnight.
This year's grand opening
occurred later in the fall than in
past years because of renova
tions on the restaurant,
Shimizu said. A new metal sink
replaced the old ceramic one,
and parts of the ceiling were
renovated.
Final approval by the state
health department opened the

Teahouse doors Friday night.
The grand opening was al
most cut short, however, by an
exploding water main in Wil
bur. But operation continued
as normal until 12 p.m., even
though hungry students had to
wade through a foot and a half
of water in the middle of Wil
bur's patio to get back to their
dorms.
