# Global, foreign policy newsletter distributed
## 
### ALEEN ZIMBEROFF 
The first New Directions
newsletter was distributed
campus-wide last Thursday
and Friday. The complimentary
issue focuses on nuclear pro
liferation and "analyzes the
link between nuclear power
technology and proliferation,
and the different approaches
to the problem taken by India,
Israel, Iran, France, South Af
rica and the U. 5.," explained
co-editor Cheryl Eschbach.
New Directions is an organi
zation dedicated to promoting
"an understanding of global
and U.S. foreign policy, espe
cially for a general audience,"
according to Co-president
Michael Barzelay. Barzelay
added that he felt the newslet
ters were the most effective
project accomplished last year
by New Directions as a club.
"The news-analysis ap
proach embodies New Direc
tion's philosophy that only in
formed citizens can guide the
making of intelligent foreign
policy. New Directions news
letter is a medium through
which students can stimulate a
more critical understanding of
U.S. foreign policy," Eschbach
added.
The free copy "provides a
good service," Barzelay added.
"The increasing interest in in
ternational affairs leads us to

be optimistic that this initial in
vestment will pay off in in
creased membership in the
New Directions organization,"
he said.
Each following newsletter
will highlight key aspects of a
major international topic in
seven or eight articles. The
next newsletter topic will be
world agriculture. Students
and faculty will be invited to
submit articles for winter quar
ter publication.
Future issues will be sent to
students for a $3 subscription
fee. Subscribers also become
voting members of New Direc
tions.
An additional New Direc
tions publication planned this
year is the Update. Its purpose
is to "pool together and synth
esize the salient features of
events in several regions and
put them in perspective,"
explained co-editor Michele
Schuchert.
Update will attempt to "pin
point the trends in interna
tional politics," she added. The
six regions to be covered in
each issue include South
America, Africa, Europe, the
Middle East, Russia and the Far
East. Subscribers will receive
Update along with the newslet
ter. Both publications will be
issued bi-quarterly.
