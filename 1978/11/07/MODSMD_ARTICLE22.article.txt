# Astronomer says zodiac signs wrong
## 
### BILL FOX 
Most everyone knows their zodiac sign.
Right? Wrong. According to one Bay Area
astronomer zodiac fans are really checking
the wrong horoscopes because of a
dramatic change in the constellations dur
ing the last 2000 years.
"As the earth moves around it, the sun
appears to shitt its position relative to the
background stars. Star groupings through
which the sun appears to move are called
the constellations of the zodiac,"
explained Andrew Fraknoi, executive of
ficer of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific.
Fraknoi said, however, that due to a
wobbling in the earth's rotation, the appa
rent position of the sun against the zodiac
constellations varies in a circle as well.
Fraknoi called this phenomenon "proces
sion."
According to Fraknoi's calculations
based on precession, the sun's position
will shift by one constellation every 2000
years. Since the current astrological
horoscope system was set up by the Egyp
tian astronomer Ptolemy nearly 2000 years
ago, Fraknoi said, the sun's path through
the zodiac has shifted by one constellation
since astrology was created.
"This means," said Fraknoi, "that
someone who was born on Nov. 1 and is
called a Scorpio was actually born when
the sun was in the constellation of Libra!"
This seems as if it would be a
horoscope-shattering discovery to the
millions of people who consult their
horoscopes regularly, but Franknoi said
this fact has been long known by as
tronomers.
Fraknoi has become something of a
celebrity in the Bay Area since he began
publicizing his constellation shift theory.
Fraknoi is co-author of a syndicated
newspaper column on astronomy, editor
of an astronomy magazine for non
scientists, and is executive officer of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific. The

ASP organization publishes two astronom
ical newsletters in addition to offering
bumper stickers and T-shirts which carry
the slogans: "The big bang is an exploding
myth, "I watch heavenly bodies" and
"Pulsars turn me on — fast."
Fraknoi said he believes that astrology
has never accurately predicted the future.
"I know of no astronomer who takes
astrology seriously," he said. But Fraknoi
does not dismiss astrology as completely
useless.
"I like to think of astrology as alchemy.
It's what sparked people's interest in look
ing at the sky."
Fraknoi said he has seen a growing in
terest in astronomy among the general
public as more and more people begin to
look at the sky. He said he thinks it is
important to keep the public informed.
"What I am trying to do is to let people
know all the exciting things which have
been taking place in astronomy in the last
few decades."
Fraknoi, who is currently on leave from
his position as professor at Canada Col
lege in Redwood City, tells the public
about these discoveries through his syndi
cated newspaper column entitled "Explor
ing the Universe," through ASP's
magazine, Mercury and through lectures
and courses which he has given in the Bay
Area.
In relating astronomical discoveries and
theories to the general public, Fraknoi's
approach is to teach astronomy using sim
ple everyday terms, and to avoid the use of
mathematics.
Fraknoi said he believes that "if you
scratch the average person, you'll find a
mathophobiac, a person who is deathly
afraid of math."
But Fraknoi said these
"mathophobiacs" are very capable of
learning astronomy in spite of their lack of
mathematical skills. He admitted, how
ever, that "math is an integral part of the
language of science. There are things

which just cannot be understood without
math. People who are taught astronomy
without math get a more superficial un
derstanding, but most people don't need
to know the actual details involved in the
actual discoveries to enjoy what we've dis
covered.''
"My approach is more concerned with
providing astronomy as a part of a cultural
background."
Fraknoi said his aim in all of his en
deavors is "to interpret astronomy for the
non-scientist."
Not surprisingly Fraknoi's recent UC-
Santa Cruz extension course at Gunn FHigh
School in Palo Alto was characterized by
an attempt to explain astronomy in
"layman's terms." About 115 people at
tended the two-day course.
Reactions to the course, entitled "Cos
mic Evolution: How the Universe Turned
into You" was "good to excellent," ac
cording to Trink Dewald, assistant prog
rammer for the UC-Santa Cruz Extension
Program.
Many of the students who took Frak
noi's course at Gunn were also school
teachers taking the course to help prepare
lessons for their classes, according to De
wald.
Fraknoi's simplified approach to as
tronomy was preferred over other
methods because "a technical approach
would appeal to far fewer people," said
Dewald.
Fraknoi doesn't advocate popularizing
astronomy by all astronomers.
"I don't think that every astronomer
should do what I do. Some astronomers
are no good at dealing with the public. But
the astronomical community must com
municate with the public," said Fraknoi.
"What we do is interesting, and it's nice
to be able to share it with the public. And
it's also an obligation; most research is
paid for with public funding, so it's impor
tant to let them know what they're getting
for their money."
