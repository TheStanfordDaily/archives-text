## Movies/jim mattson Not much affection 
### 
Because of the book's
enormous success, it seems
almost inevitable that a film
would be made of Richard
Adams' bunny-epic Watership
Down. The best seller, written
as if J.R.R. Tolkien had stum
bled upon a long-forgotten
manuscript by Beatrix Potter,
achieved a cult following be
cause of its twist of rebuilding
humanity with the ears of a
rabbit.
The movie version faithfully
illustrates all the crap about the
anthropomorphic lapines; it
presents it in such a way that it
is difficult to believe that any
one involved in the making of
this feature-length cartoon
even liked reading the book,
much less enjoyed turning its
ideas into cinema.
Admittedly, it couldn't have
been easy to go for a drink after
work at the studio and tell your
dinner companion that you
were making the first million
dollar Looney Tune. Corres
pondingly, it is hard to see
where even a trace of affection
went into the making of this
fim; its characters, instead of
taking on a magical life of their
own, all seem to be affected by
some sort of imaginational
novocaine.
Adams' story of rabbits en

gaged in making a new, hap
pier life after they are forced to
leave the security of their war
ren has come to the screen bas
ically intact; what has been left
behind is any reason forcaring.
Prologue
Watership Down opens with
a prologue drawn in bold, chil
dish animation; this beginning
is the 112 ilm's best part because it
looks as if someone might ac
tually have had a good time
working with shape and color.
With the credits, however, we
get a look at the artist's true
intent. The witty, primitive
drawings get swept away in a
muddy wash of mock Disney,
and now the shapes are realis
tic enough for it to matter that
in terms of art work they stink.
Real trouble
You know there's real trou
ble ahead when the first rabbit
comes in view and you realize
that its closest cousin in style is
the illustrations for the Ripley's
Believe-it-or-notcolumn; even
Mr. Ripley would have had
trouble passing off this pot of
sentient rabbit stew.
Whiie Watership Down's
color is by Technicolor, the
colors themselves are institu
tional: sea green, ice blue and
dust brown. Instead of
stimulating the eye, this film

makes Stern Hall look gaudy.
The characters seem to have
been pulled out of the same
institutional closet; one could
picture their names — Hazel,
Cowslip, Clover — gracing
some can of paint as easily as a
talking rabbit. The rabbits in
this film are a pretty dull bunch
(perhaps it's genetic); hardly
the material of which a great
adventure is made.
The movie's most ingratiat
ing personality is a sharp
tongued seagull, perhaps be
cuase he's the only one who
shows any animation in a film
that's supposed to be made of
the stuff. The voice is Zero
Mostel doing what is probably
the broadest German accent

ever recorded — exactly the
kind of ethnic humor we've
been taught not to laugh at.
British actor Ralph Richardson
also makes a vocal appear
ance; he, unfortunately, is re
quired to take his part seri
ously.
This film, though really not
aimed at adults, doesn't seem
to have been slanted for its ob
vious second audience, chil
dren. The big problem faced
here was making the Easter
Bunny's brethren seem fierce;
the effect is produced here by
having the rabbit's ear clawed
off in a fight. Watership Down
is a cinematic hat trick which
fails because all the mirrors
have been left in plain view.

Adams' story of rabbits en

Prologue
Watership Down opens with
a prologue drawn in bold, chil
dish animation; this beginning
is the 112 ilm's best part because it
looks as if someone might ac
tually have had a good time
working with shape and color.
With the credits, however, we
get a look at the artist's true
intent. The witty, primitive
drawings get swept away in a
muddy wash of mock Disney,
and now the shapes are realis
tic enough for it to matter that
in terms of art work they stink.
Real trouble
You know there's real trou
ble ahead when the first rabbit
comes in view and you realize
that its closest cousin in style is
the illustrations for the Ripley's
Believe-it-or-notcolumn; even
Mr. Ripley would have had
trouble passing off this pot of
sentient rabbit stew.
Whiie Watership Down's
color is by Technicolor, the
colors themselves are institu
tional: sea green, ice blue and
dust brown. Instead of
stimulating the eye, this film

makes Stern Hall look gaudy.
The characters seem to have
been pulled out of the same
institutional closet; one could
picture their names — Hazel,
Cowslip, Clover — gracing
some can of paint as easily as a
talking rabbit. The rabbits in
this film are a pretty dull bunch
(perhaps it's genetic); hardly
the material of which a great
adventure is made.
The movie's most ingratiat
ing personality is a sharp
tongued seagull, perhaps be
cuase he's the only one who
shows any animation in a film
that's supposed to be made of
the stuff. The voice is Zero
Mostel doing what is probably
the broadest German accent

ever recorded — exactly the
kind of ethnic humor we've
been taught not to laugh at.
British actor Ralph Richardson
also makes a vocal appear
ance; he, unfortunately, is re
quired to take his part seri
ously.
This film, though really not
aimed at adults, doesn't seem
to have been slanted for its ob
vious second audience, chil
dren. The big problem faced
here was making the Easter
Bunny's brethren seem fierce;
the effect is produced here by
having the rabbit's ear clawed
off in a fight. Watership Down
is a cinematic hat trick which
fails because all the mirrors
have been left in plain view.

enormous success, it seems
