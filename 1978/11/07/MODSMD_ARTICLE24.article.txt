## New albums: from Boston to Walsh 
### 
Change of Heart
Eric Carmen
Arista Records
Although by far the least
satisfying of Carmen's three
solo albums, still fairly pleas
ant. A mixture of ballads and
mid tempo rockers, with more
of an emphasis on the latter
than in the past. Carmen re
tains his knack for pleasant
hooks as well as his ear for full
scale orchestral productions.
Contains "Deanie Deanie,"
the Eric Carmen song Shawn
Cassidy had a hit with earlier
this year, as well as the title
track (the current single) and
the lush "Desperate Fools,"
the album's finest track.
Don't Look Back
Boston
Epic Records
There are so many
similarities between this album
and Boston's first, they're not
worth listing. Nonetheless,
many of the songs on this al
bum, including the entire first
side, are sprite and full bodied
enough to give listening en
joyment. Leader Tom Scholz
has proven himself a studio
wizard of electronics, and the
album's best track, "A Man I'll
Never Be," proves that he has
more diverse and complete
song writing abilities than de
monstrated on the first album.
But a third album which prog
resses beyond the terrain of
the first is definitely necessary

to maintain Boston's following
and to assay their true compos
ing abilities. Fun, light and
exhilarating without being fat
tening.
The Best of joe Walsh
Joe Walsh
ABC Records
This album contains all of Joe
Walsh's better known ABC
material, though not necessar
ily his "best" material. In
cluded are the hits "Turn to
Stone," "Rocky Mountain
Way," "Meadows " and "Wa'k
Away," plus a selection of roc
kers and slower paced num
bers, all in Walsh's inimitable,
somewhat whiny style. For
those who want only one Joe
Walsh record, this album is suf
ficient, but a better alternative
would be to purchase So
What and The Smoker You
Drink, the Player You Get,
from which six of this album's
nine songs were chosen
("Walk Away" being the only
one of note not from these al
bums). So What contains
several worthwhile songs, in
cluding the beautiful "Song for
Emma," which are not on this
album. Likewise, Smoker
has several noteworthy tunes
not represented here. Addi
tionally, So What is a cute
out, so for a small amount
more than the price of this al
bum, one may purchase two
excellent albums which essen

tially eliminate the need for
this album. This, all consi
dered, is the better alternative.
The Cars
The Cars
Elektra Records
So far, the year's most prom
ising debut is by this group
from Boston. The Cars team
the eccentricities of Roxy
Music with pop sensibilities to
produce an album which has
wide appeal yet doesn't come
off as overtly commercial. In
cluded on this album are the
chart makers "My Best Friend's
Girlfriend" and "Just What I
Needed," along with the po
tential hits "You're All I've Got
Tonight" and "All Mixed Up."
The remainder of the songs
range from the strangely
ominous "Moving in Stereo"
to the playful "Don't Cha
Stop." Not all of it works, but
there's quite enough here to
make the album worthwhile.
Life Beyond L.A.
Ambrosia
Warner Brothers
This, Ambrosia's third album
(the other two being the
Grammy nominees Am
brosia and Somewhere I've
Never Traveled), is their most
successful, sales spurred on by
the hit single "How Much I
Feel." Ironically, it is also their
weakest album. Though the

vocals are still tight, the lyrics
still intelligent, and there are
still traces of the classical influ
ences which permeated their
previous albums (notably in
the very pretty "Heart to
Heart"), many of the songs
here are more simple and not
as interesting or melodically
strong. The overall album is
worthwhile compared to most
new releases, but the first two
albums (out of print; still avail
able some places as cutouts)
are better investments.
Bish
Stephen Bishop
ABC Records
From the cover of this album
to the songs within, Stephen
Bishop comes across as one of
the classiest figures in pop/
rock. Indeed. How many rock
stars would open their album
with an orchestrated version of
"If I Only Had a Heart?" The
problem is that Bishop only
sporadically lives up to writing
potential. The best song here is
"Looking for the Right One,"
the Bishop tune which first ap
peared on Art Garfunkel's
Breakaway album. Several
tunes on this album come
close to matching this one, but
the remainder sort of fade
away in mediocrity. Still, an
admirable MOR effort and cer
tainly not one to halt Bishop's
growing popularity.
