## O'Neill comedy at ACT 
### 
One doesn't expect comedy
from Eugene O'Neill. Yet Ah,
Wilderness!, O'Neill's only at
tempt at full length comedy, is
also his most frequently pro
duced play.
In certain respects, Ah, Wil
derness! is remarkably similar
to O'Neill's tragic masterpiece,
Long Day's journey Into Night.
Both are semi
autobiographical, having simi
lar settings and casts of charac
ters. Yet the plays differ in
characterization, depth, and
sentiment, because O'Neill

takes two strikingly different
perspectives. Unlike the tragic
coloration of Long Day's Jour
ney, O'Neill's portrait of a fam
ily in Ah, Wilderness! is tender,
flavorful and sentimental.
Discoveries
Ah, Wilderness! is about the
discoveries of Richard Miller, a
romantic and star-struck teen

ager in the Miller family. After a
misunderstanding with his
sweetheart, Richard's romantic
ideals are thrown into disarray,
and he begins to find out about
life and love. With his new
knowledge, Richard pros
letyzes everyone in his path,
pretentiously quoting Ibsen
and Wilde and indicting all
women as fickle. Richard's
boyish idealism reflects a
lighthearted spirit.
O'Neill conveys this spirit by
creating a tender, nostalgic
atmosphere. In short scenes

between acts, the stage crew
does not just go through the
motions of changing the set. In
their early 1900s garb, they
frolic, mime, and dance while
changing the old set into a new
one. With such devices O'Neill
sets the tone of the play.
It some respects, it appears
that O'Neill is out of his ele

ment in creating comedy. Ah,,
Wilderness! lacks subtlety and
depth. We laugh at Uncle Sid
ney clowning around the table
and at Mr. Miller's droll re-i
sponses to Richard's brash
comments.
But this kind of humor re
lies on one-liners, not on ironic,
twists or the development of
comic situation. The story-line
and dialogue present few sur
prises, and the characters
seem stereotyped. As such,'
O'Neill does not leave us much,
to think about after we leave:
the theater.
Quality high
As usual, the quality of the
ACT acting is high. Mother Mil
ler is marvelous in her badger
ing and insisting on food as the
cure for all ills. Richards's
father seems too mechanical at
times, but he's often laboring
under predictable lines.
Richard's portrayal is over
acted, with an emphasis on his
brash, rebellious qualities
rather than his younger and
more innocent traits. Yet in
general, fast-paced acting and
quick delivery make this three
hour play move swiftly.
Ah, Wilderness! lacks the
psychological depth and the
tragic overtones of Long Day's
Journey Into Night. O'Neill
certainly intended that to be
true. Interestingly enough,
O'Neill commented that
Richard's boyhood was "the
way I would have liked my
boyhood to have been."
Ah, Wilderness! expresses a
warmhearted, tender vision of
youth. Its appeal is in its op
timism, its vibrance, in its just
being fun. With that expecta
tion, one can grant O'Neill a
successful transition from
tragedy to comedy and very
much enjoy the play.

Ah, Wilderness! lacks the
psychological depth and the
tragic overtones of Long Day's
Journey Into Night. O'Neill
certainly intended that to be
true. Interestingly enough,
O'Neill commented that
Richard's boyhood was "the
way I would have liked my
boyhood to have been."
Ah, Wilderness! expresses a
warmhearted, tender vision of
youth. Its appeal is in its op
timism, its vibrance, in its just
being fun. With that expecta
tion, one can grant O'Neill a
successful transition from
tragedy to comedy and very
much enjoy the play.

comedy Ah, Wilderness! now in repertory at the Geary Theater in San Francisco.
One doesn't expect comedy
from Eugene O'Neill. Yet Ah,
Wilderness!, O'Neill's only at
tempt at full length comedy, is
also his most frequently pro
duced play.
In certain respects, Ah, Wil
derness! is remarkably similar
to O'Neill's tragic masterpiece,
Long Day's journey Into Night.
Both are semi
autobiographical, having simi
lar settings and casts of charac
ters. Yet the plays differ in
characterization, depth, and
sentiment, because O'Neill

takes two strikingly different
perspectives. Unlike the tragic
coloration of Long Day's Jour
ney, O'Neill's portrait of a fam
ily in Ah, Wilderness! is tender,
flavorful and sentimental.
Discoveries
Ah, Wilderness! is about the
discoveries of Richard Miller, a
romantic and star-struck teen

ager in the Miller family. After a
misunderstanding with his
sweetheart, Richard's romantic
ideals are thrown into disarray,
and he begins to find out about
life and love. With his new
knowledge, Richard pros
letyzes everyone in his path,
pretentiously quoting Ibsen
and Wilde and indicting all
women as fickle. Richard's
boyish idealism reflects a
lighthearted spirit.
O'Neill conveys this spirit by
creating a tender, nostalgic
atmosphere. In short scenes

between acts, the stage crew
does not just go through the
motions of changing the set. In
their early 1900s garb, they
frolic, mime, and dance while
changing the old set into a new
one. With such devices O'Neill
sets the tone of the play.
It some respects, it appears
that O'Neill is out of his ele

ment in creating comedy. Ah,,
Wilderness! lacks subtlety and
depth. We laugh at Uncle Sid
ney clowning around the table
and at Mr. Miller's droll re-i
sponses to Richard's brash
comments.
But this kind of humor re
lies on one-liners, not on ironic,
twists or the development of
comic situation. The story-line
and dialogue present few sur
prises, and the characters
seem stereotyped. As such,'
O'Neill does not leave us much,
to think about after we leave:
the theater.
Quality high
As usual, the quality of the
ACT acting is high. Mother Mil
ler is marvelous in her badger
ing and insisting on food as the
cure for all ills. Richards's
father seems too mechanical at
times, but he's often laboring
under predictable lines.
Richard's portrayal is over
acted, with an emphasis on his
brash, rebellious qualities
rather than his younger and
more innocent traits. Yet in
general, fast-paced acting and
quick delivery make this three
hour play move swiftly.
Ah, Wilderness! lacks the
psychological depth and the
tragic overtones of Long Day's
