## Rocking Bowie 
### 
Stage
David Bowie
RCA Records
After a near brush with total
self-destruction late in 1975,
David Bowie fled the
expando-ego, mega-decibel,
dissipated world of rock and
roll for the peace and quiet of
Berlin, where for the past two
years he has forged new direc
tions in his music, art and
filmmaking.
The musical output of this
period (specifically, the Low
and Heroes albums), while ar
guably artistically and stylisti
cally stronger than any of his
previous releases, still rep
resented a poseur between
poses, an artist without a
handle on his immediate vis
ions and direction. And, evi
dently, the public was less en
raptured with a moody,
explorative Bowie than with
the Queen of Glitter, the King
of Disco or the Thin White
Duke: in sales, the records
ranked among the lowest of all
his efforts.
Tour
In early 1978, Bowie an
nounced a decision to tour the
United States and Europe, the
reason for which, as he said,
was: "I need the money."
Well, it certainly showed. The
tour featured two musical sets,
the first comprised mainly of
selections from Low and
Heroes, the second a presenta
tion of the best from the "Ziggy
Stardust" period.
The stage set had been used
on the previous tour, costumes
were subdued and changed
only once; in short, Bowie had

found a way to please all of his
fans with a simple, direct and
no-frills (read: cheap) enum
eration of his strongest musical
statements.
In one sense, the same bare
essentials, let's-make-bucks
with-this-one attitude per
vades Bowie's latest album,
Stage, a collection of 17 live
tracks from the tours.
The songs have all been re
leased elsewhere; the song
order is rearranged to suit any
fan's period taste (side one is
all Ziggy; side two is from the
"Young Americas" era; side
three represents Low, and side
four is culled from Heroes; the
cover art re-uses the same pic
ture three times and there are
no inner sleeve pictures or re
cording information listed.
By the wayside
Happily, these considera
tions fall by the wayside when
one actually hears the album.
Bowie assembled a virtually
flawless band, featuring
longtime crony Carlos Alomar
on rhythm guitar, Utopia
keyboardist Roger Powell and
wacko lead guitarist Adrian
Belew (who, incidentally,
played rhythm guitar in the
Mothers that Frank Zappa
brought to Maples Pavilion last
fall).
Drummer Dennis Davis ab
solutely kicks these songs
along, rendering staid studio
versions obsolete with dance
able, rock 'n' roll interpreta
tions of Bowie's work. Even the
ethereally potent Heroes here
becomes a hard-rocking paean
to the powers of romantic love.
This is, in fact, the perfect

party record: with the excep
tion of side three, each side
rocks along at a frantic pace,
and side two ("Station to Sta
tion," "TVCIS" and "Fame")
would do any disco proud.
Bowie's singing, too, is
commendable. It seems that
he's finally realized his voice's
potential instrumentality, as he
reaches for notes and phras
ings not even hinted at on
studio versions. The vocals are
in places controlled, somber,
and even aloof. Other times
Bowie wails with an almost
heart-rendering desperation:
when, during "Ziggy Stardust"
he sings "I had to break up the
band," we know the man feels
it.
Generalist
David Bowie is a self
proclaimed "generalist." His
artistic interests extend
beyond the immediate realm
of music, which he has to some
degree used as a convenient
vehicle to both disseminate his
own views to the widest possi
ble audience, and to finance
his other aitistic endeavors
(Bowie's film,/usf A Gigolo, in

which he stars with Marlene
Dietrich and Kim Novak, is
slated for winter release).
Bowie is certainly one of the
most consistently interesting
and original creatures to infest
the world of rock; his constant
image manipulation and pre
packaged stylistic shifts have
always made for interesting
viewing, especially in a field
peopled with pretenders and
rock star clones. Bowie is,
truly, the only one of a kind.
Where does he go from
here? In music, Bowie has al
ready arranged his style so that
he can easily croon into his '50s
and beyond — he hardly relies
on the immediate physical
theatrics of a (agger. What di
rection he eventually does take
remains to be seen; in the in
terim everyone from the avid
fan to the nouveau Bowie
watcher can be satisfied with
this new album, a fine retros
pective of songs given a new
dimension by their live presen
tation.
And look at it this way: by
buying Stage, you're donating
to a pretty good cause.
