## Dance Theater of Harlem emphasizes male dancers 
### 
With a few major exceptions, ballet since the
romantic period has been primarily a female
occupation. Dance Theater of Harlem s Ber
keley concert last Friday though, emphasized
the male dancers except for the first two pieces.
Arthur Mitchell, a former principal dancer
with the New York City Ballet, and one of the
first black classical dancers in the United States,
and Karel Shook, former director of the National
Ballet of Holland, founded Dance Theater of
Harlem (DTH) 10 years ago as the first estab
lished black classical ballet company, supported
by a school of considerable repute.
Although the company's repertory contains
more than just straight classical ballet, the c om
pany has always performed many works by
George Balinchine becaue of Mitchell's connec
tion with the NYCB.
Balinchine is traditionally described as a
"woman's choreographer,' but the only Balin
chine work on Friday's program showed both
the men and women to almost equal advantage,
serving as a warm-up foi the dancers and the
audience. The dancers had so much extra
energy that they seemed to say "Yes, isn't this a
nice little piece; we dance it twice before break
fast." Because they wanted to move more, they
made small, relatively insignificant movements
large, significant ones.
Sense of rhythm
This tendency carried over into the relation
ship between the dance and the music, by
Tschaikovsky, where the musical count was
perhaps too ohvious. In general throughout the
evening ,the DTH dancers had beautiful senses
of the rhythms of their accompaniments, but in
"Allegro Brillante" to Tschaikovsky, the overly
accented musical beat especially with the arms,
stood out instead of blending with the tone of
the piece.
The strong young dancers handled the Balin
chine choreography well, making especially
beautiful a movement where Virginia Johnson
balanced in attitude supported on either side by
a male dancer. Their arms formed a double arch
through which the rest passed. Technically the
largest fault was the off-balance nature of
Johnson's partnered turns with l owell Smith.
Parody
The next piece, a pas deduex, "Biosfera," also
showed the Balinchine background of the com
pany. Choreographed by Mitchell, it parodied
the heavy, abstract style of some ot Balinchine s
later pieces to Stravinsky, so well th.it at lirst I
wondered whether to take it seriously.

As the piece went on though, I recognized
more direct quotes from Balinchine, move
ments: Balinchine taken to the nth degree. At
one point Judy Tryus turned her back to the
audience and walked swinging her hips up
stage. Later she does a characteristically Balin
chine wiggle in second position rolling up one
foot and down, the other stretching her arms
over her head. The piece was notable for its
absurdity as well as for the sheer technical ability
of the dancers, Ronald Perry and Tryus. Tryus
especially contorts her body in amazing ways,
flinging and twisting it to bring gasps from the
audience. Mitchell took Balinchine's preoccu
pation with the female, in particular its flexibility
and tarried it through to absurdity.
Comparison
Because of their adjacent placement on the
program, and the fact that "Iroy Game was
all-male and "Doina" had mostly female dan
cers, one tends to want to compare them. "Troy
Came" is a marvelous celebration of the
jocular-jock male, but "Doina" failed miserably
to provide the hoped-for contrast in a more
female oriented piece.
( horeographed by Rogert North, "Troy
Game" makes excellent use of DTH's fine jump.
The piece is a series of dance sketches full of
powerful dancing which ends in some sort of
joke. The Cuit, headed by the powerfully grace
ful Ronald Perry highlighted well the dance
moments as well as the slap-stick.
In "Doina," hobbled mummified ants danced
to a churchy-organ score by George Zemphir
and Marcel Cellier. The costumes of the all
female corps made to appear as dusty-webbed
nuns since they were composed of a white-grey
membranous material which covered the dan
cers' heads in addition to forming an enclosing
film around their legs. The choreogiaphy by
Royslon Maldoom lac ked interest and was un
naturally attached to, and punctuated by the
music al accents.
Dougla," an ethnic piece synthesizing Hindu
and Afiican dance, was performed by the whole
company but here again the male dancers had
more room to show off their abilities ! lie piece
was quite enjoyable but seemed to emphasize
the "exotic" nature of the movement r.ither
than its universal dance natuu The costumes
by the choreographer, who also wiote the
music, were colorful and numerous, but they
confined the women to beautiful < lassiral Hindi
arm movements 01 impressive twirls with their
flowing costumes.

( horeographed by Rogert North, "Troy
Game" makes excellent use of DTH's fine jump.
The piece is a series of dance sketches full of
powerful dancing which ends in some sort of
joke. The Cuit, headed by the powerfully grace
ful Ronald Perry highlighted well the dance
moments as well as the slap-stick.
In "Doina," hobbled mummified ants danced
to a churchy-organ score by George Zemphir
and Marcel Cellier. The costumes of the all
female corps made to appear as dusty-webbed
nuns since they were composed of a white-grey
membranous material which covered the dan
cers' heads in addition to forming an enclosing
film around their legs. The choreogiaphy by
Royslon Maldoom lac ked interest and was un
naturally attached to, and punctuated by the
music al accents.
Dougla," an ethnic piece synthesizing Hindu
and Afiican dance, was performed by the whole
company but here again the male dancers had
more room to show off their abilities ! lie piece
was quite enjoyable but seemed to emphasize
the "exotic" nature of the movement r.ither
than its universal dance natuu The costumes
by the choreographer, who also wiote the
music, were colorful and numerous, but they
confined the women to beautiful < lassiral Hindi
arm movements 01 impressive twirls with their
flowing costumes.
With a few major exceptions, ballet since the
romantic period has been primarily a female
occupation. Dance Theater of Harlem s Ber
keley concert last Friday though, emphasized
the male dancers except for the first two pieces.
Arthur Mitchell, a former principal dancer
with the New York City Ballet, and one of the
first black classical dancers in the United States,
and Karel Shook, former director of the National
Ballet of Holland, founded Dance Theater of
Harlem (DTH) 10 years ago as the first estab
lished black classical ballet company, supported
by a school of considerable repute.
Although the company's repertory contains
more than just straight classical ballet, the c om
pany has always performed many works by
George Balinchine becaue of Mitchell's connec
tion with the NYCB.
Balinchine is traditionally described as a
"woman's choreographer,' but the only Balin
chine work on Friday's program showed both
the men and women to almost equal advantage,
serving as a warm-up foi the dancers and the
audience. The dancers had so much extra
energy that they seemed to say "Yes, isn't this a
nice little piece; we dance it twice before break
fast." Because they wanted to move more, they
made small, relatively insignificant movements
large, significant ones.
Sense of rhythm
This tendency carried over into the relation
ship between the dance and the music, by
Tschaikovsky, where the musical count was
perhaps too ohvious. In general throughout the
evening ,the DTH dancers had beautiful senses
of the rhythms of their accompaniments, but in
"Allegro Brillante" to Tschaikovsky, the overly
accented musical beat especially with the arms,
stood out instead of blending with the tone of
the piece.
The strong young dancers handled the Balin
chine choreography well, making especially
beautiful a movement where Virginia Johnson
balanced in attitude supported on either side by
a male dancer. Their arms formed a double arch
through which the rest passed. Technically the
largest fault was the off-balance nature of
Johnson's partnered turns with l owell Smith.
Parody
The next piece, a pas deduex, "Biosfera," also
showed the Balinchine background of the com
pany. Choreographed by Mitchell, it parodied
the heavy, abstract style of some ot Balinchine s
later pieces to Stravinsky, so well th.it at lirst I
wondered whether to take it seriously.

As the piece went on though, I recognized
more direct quotes from Balinchine, move
ments: Balinchine taken to the nth degree. At
one point Judy Tryus turned her back to the
audience and walked swinging her hips up
stage. Later she does a characteristically Balin
chine wiggle in second position rolling up one
foot and down, the other stretching her arms
over her head. The piece was notable for its
absurdity as well as for the sheer technical ability
of the dancers, Ronald Perry and Tryus. Tryus
especially contorts her body in amazing ways,
flinging and twisting it to bring gasps from the
audience. Mitchell took Balinchine's preoccu
pation with the female, in particular its flexibility
and tarried it through to absurdity.
Comparison
Because of their adjacent placement on the
program, and the fact that "Iroy Game was
all-male and "Doina" had mostly female dan
cers, one tends to want to compare them. "Troy
Came" is a marvelous celebration of the
jocular-jock male, but "Doina" failed miserably
to provide the hoped-for contrast in a more
female oriented piece.
