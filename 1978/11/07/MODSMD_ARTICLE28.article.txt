Shah puts military in charge
Tehran, Iran — The beleaguered shah of Iran
put his top soldier in charge of the government
yesterday in a bid to "establish law and order," but
bands of anti-shah protesters responded with new
hit-and-run rioting in this troubled city and its out
skirts.
One person was reported killed and two were
reported wounded when troops dispersed rioters.
The U.S. government, whose ties with Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi are a main target of pro
testers here, quickly expressed support for the
shah's shift to military rule. State Department
press officer Jill Schuker said in Washington the
monarch acted within his authority and only after
it became clear a new civilian government could
not be formed.
The new prime minister, chief of staff Gen.
Gholam-Reza Azhari, moved swiftly to assert con
trol and head off the threat to the shah's 37-year
reign.
Azhari's government ordered troops and tanks
to ring key sites in the capital. It also clamped
censorship on the local press, radio and televi
sion, arrested five editors and issued a "wanted"
list for 30 others accused of inciting public unrest
through the news media. No censorship was im
posed on outgoing news dispatches, however.
Israelis want renegotiation
The Israeli government allocated $32.5 million
yesterday to construct nearly 900 housing units in
Israeli-occupied Arab lands, Israeli Radio re
ported. A decision last month to beef up the set
tlements sparked a controversy with the U.S. gov
ernment.
No official LJ.S. reaction to the allocation was

available immediately.
The Israeli Cabinet also ordered Defense Minis
ter Ezer Weizman back to Washington with in
structions to renegotiate some previously
agreed-upon points before wrapping up talks on
the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
In Cairo, top Egyptian negotiator Osama el-Baz
said Egypt intends to submit its own "new points
and proposals" that may help "bridge the gap"
that is holding up signing the nearly-completed
peace treaty.
New York's news strike over
New York — The long strike over, the New York
Times and the Daily News struggled back onto the
streets for the first time in three months yesterday,
then started work on editions aimed at today's
elections.
Looming ahead were circulation wars with the
afternoon New York Post, which resumed publica
tion on Oct. 5 after an eight-week shutdown, and
with suburban competitors which increased their
circulation and advertising during the 89-day
shutdown.
Before labor peace could be assured, the Times
and News still had to reach contracts with unions
representing mailers and electricians.
But those problems were put asideas the papers
returned after reaching agreements with a series
of unions, including the pressmen whose strike
triggered the shutdown.
Brezhnev sends note to Amin
Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania — Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev stepped into the Tanzanian-
Ugandan border war yesterday with a "very en
couraging" message to Ugandan President Idi
Amin, Uganda Radio reported.

The radio, monitored in Nairobi, Kenya, said the
message was the "best" received by Am in from
another head of state since the border war began a
week ago and indicated Moscow's desire for
peace. Contents of the message were not dis
closed.
An undisclosed number of Tanzanian soldiers
are facing an estimated 2000 to 3000 Ugandan
troops along the strategic Kagera River — Amin's
self-proclaimed boundary between the two states.
Heavy Tanzanian mortar and artillery barrages of
Ugandan positions on the river's northern bank
were reported over the weekend but no new bat
tle reports have been issued by either side.

ling 100 points in late October, dropped back 8.23
to 814.88.
