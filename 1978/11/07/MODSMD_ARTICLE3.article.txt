# Apathy, low turnout expected in election
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The 1978 elec
tion campaign entered its final day
with signs that the mood of America
was marked by an indifference un
likely to produce dramatic change in
the Democratic Party's control of
Congress and most state govern
ments.
Despite get-out-the-vote cam
paigns, a low turnout is expected to
day.
If historic patterns hold, the Re
publicans, as the party out of power
in Washington, should pick up seats
in Congress. The most optimistic
forecasts of COP gains, however,
leave the party far short of ending
Democratic control of the House and
Senate.
As the year of Proposition 13, of tax
protests and demands for cuts in
government budgets, it would seem
like a difficult election for incum
bents. Yet the governors of several of
the nation's largest states now ap
pear headed for re-election.
Little difference
Whether Republicans or Democ
rats, candidates emphasized poc
ketbook issues — inflation, taxes and
government spending — and polls
show most Americans see little dif
ference in how the two parties deal
with the economy.
An uncertain factor this year was
the heavy flow of money from special
interest groups, many of them con
cerned with a single issue such as the
Panama Canal treaties or federal
abortion aid.
Federal Election Commission
statistics show political action com
mittees not affiliated with specific
candidates or parties contributed
$18.7 million to congressional candi
dates.
40 percent voting
A total of 155.5 million Americans
are eligible to vote today, but most
forecasts are that under 40 percent
will go to the polls. The figure might
be as low as 33 percent. In the 1974
mid-term election, 36 percent of the
eligible voters went to the polls.
Those who do vote will decide the
following:

— The entire makeup of the House
of Representatives in the 96th Con
gress, a total of 435 seats. When the
95th Congress adjourned last month
there were 285 Democrats, 146 Re
publicans and four vacant seats.
— Contests for one-third of the
Senate. With 35 seats to be filled this
year, two Democrats are unopposed.
Of the contested seats, 17 are held by
Republicans and 16 by Democrats. In
the 95th Congress, Democrats con
trolled the Senate by a margin of 62 to
38.
Governors
— The governors of 36 states, 26 of
whom are Democrats, nine Republi
cans and one an independent. Over
all, there are 37 Democratic gover
nors and 12 Republicans.
— Legislatures in 45 states. The
Republican National Committee
committed $1 million to a campaign
to elect COP candidates to state
legislatures. Democrats control both
branches of the legislature in 36
states to the Republicans' five.
— Variations on California's tax
cutting Proposition 13 in 16 states.
Proposals to cut or limit taxes and
spending are on the ballot in
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Col
orado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Mas
sachusetts, Michigan, Missouri,
Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota,
Oregon, South Dakota and Texas.
California
In California, Jerry Brown appears
headed for election to a second term
and a boost to his presidential ambi
tions whether in 1980 or later.
Brown also called for a big
statewide voter turnout to sweep the
entire Democratic ticket into office.
Brown, who leads Younger by
margins of up to 25 percent in polls,
campaigned alongside Lt. Gov. Mer
vyn Dymally and Democratic candi
date for attorney general Yvonne
Burke, who are both locked in tight
races.
The focus was on Dymally, who
has gotten increasing support from
Brown in the last few weeks after
polls showed him trailing Republican
challenger Mike Curb.
