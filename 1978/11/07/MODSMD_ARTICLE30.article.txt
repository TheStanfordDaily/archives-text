# Professor to study hyperactive children
## 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
"There is no one cause of hyperactivity, and
there should be no one solution," Carl Thoresen,
professor of education and psychology here said
Friday.
Thoresen will head a drug-free, educational re
search approach based here toward solving the
problem of hyperactivity in children. Presently,
Thoresen is looking for volunteer subjects for his
new approach.
According to some studies, nearly 3.5 million
American children are considered hyperactive.
The children are inattentive, easily distracted and
suffer from various learning difficulties.
Thoresen said that "these problems, including
poor social relations, are the most common child
behavior problems."
Most treatment for hyperactivity today is ad
ministered by doctors prescribing medication to
alleviate the symptoms.
However, Thoresen said, "The failure of stimul
ants to improve academic performance or social
relations, combined with their adverse side effects
for many children has led us to look for alternative
methods of treatment."
Thoresen estimates that nearly 400,000 children
are being given such drugs as Ritalin to control

their hyperactivity.
Prolonged drug use has brought side effects
such as loss of appetite, and there is some evi
dence that medication may also bring long-term
physiological and psychological side effects.
Thoreson's research approach, however, is
based on observation. Researchers watch the be
havior of youngsters in the classroom, on the
playground and at home. From the evidence
gained from these observations, Thoreson said he
hopes "to devise an educational curriculum of
structured learning experiences for parents and
teachers."
This type of training program encourages and
supports behavior that is not hyperactive or
hyperkinetic," he added.
An alternative to drug treatment of hyperactivity
which has become popular in the Bay Area, ac
cording to Thoreson, is the Finegold Diet. Devised
by Dr. Bernard Finegold, a retired pediatrician,
this program restricts all intake of artificial flavor
ing or coloring.
This diet is difficult to administer, and followers
of the Finegold Diet have formed a parents' as
sociation to help them implement the dietary re
strictions.
Thoreson said "the parents in the parent associ

ation benefit more from the social/psychological
support than the diet itself."
"Only a small number of hyperactive or hyper
kinetic children are allergic to food additives, so
the Finegold Diet is not a major solution."
Thoreson complained of the indiscriminate use
of the term "hyperactivity."
"We are skeptical of global complaints by pa
rents or teachers. We are more impressed with
documented behavior," he said.
It is unclear whether children "outgrow"
hyperactivity or whether it is relabeled, Thoreson
explained, but drug treatment rarely continues
into the teen-age years.
Thoreson said he hopes to find an alternative to
medication and the Finegold Diet. "We intend to
create an educational training program to teach
youngsters academic and social skills," he said.
Thoreson's research entails intensive work with
a small number of subjects, to be followed up over
a number of months. Parents of hyperactive chil
dren in the area who are interested in participating
in the program are encouraged to call the Center
for Educational Research at Stanford.
Funded by a research grant from the Bureau of
Educationally Handicapped, Thoreson's research
is to be a free, volunteer program.

rents or teachers. We are more impressed with
documented behavior," he said.
It is unclear whether children "outgrow"
hyperactivity or whether it is relabeled, Thoreson
explained, but drug treatment rarely continues
into the teen-age years.
Thoreson said he hopes to find an alternative to
medication and the Finegold Diet. "We intend to
create an educational training program to teach
youngsters academic and social skills," he said.
Thoreson's research entails intensive work with
a small number of subjects, to be followed up over
a number of months. Parents of hyperactive chil
dren in the area who are interested in participating
in the program are encouraged to call the Center
for Educational Research at Stanford.
Funded by a research grant from the Bureau of
Educationally Handicapped, Thoreson's research
is to be a free, volunteer program.
"There is no one cause of hyperactivity, and
there should be no one solution," Carl Thoresen,
professor of education and psychology here said
Friday.
Thoresen will head a drug-free, educational re
search approach based here toward solving the
problem of hyperactivity in children. Presently,
Thoresen is looking for volunteer subjects for his
new approach.
According to some studies, nearly 3.5 million
American children are considered hyperactive.
The children are inattentive, easily distracted and
suffer from various learning difficulties.
Thoresen said that "these problems, including
poor social relations, are the most common child
behavior problems."
Most treatment for hyperactivity today is ad
ministered by doctors prescribing medication to
alleviate the symptoms.
However, Thoresen said, "The failure of stimul
ants to improve academic performance or social
relations, combined with their adverse side effects
for many children has led us to look for alternative
methods of treatment."
Thoresen estimates that nearly 400,000 children
are being given such drugs as Ritalin to control

their hyperactivity.
Prolonged drug use has brought side effects
such as loss of appetite, and there is some evi
dence that medication may also bring long-term
physiological and psychological side effects.
Thoreson's research approach, however, is
based on observation. Researchers watch the be
havior of youngsters in the classroom, on the
playground and at home. From the evidence
gained from these observations, Thoreson said he
hopes "to devise an educational curriculum of
structured learning experiences for parents and
teachers."
This type of training program encourages and
supports behavior that is not hyperactive or
hyperkinetic," he added.
An alternative to drug treatment of hyperactivity
which has become popular in the Bay Area, ac
cording to Thoreson, is the Finegold Diet. Devised
by Dr. Bernard Finegold, a retired pediatrician,
this program restricts all intake of artificial flavor
ing or coloring.
This diet is difficult to administer, and followers
of the Finegold Diet have formed a parents' as
sociation to help them implement the dietary re
strictions.
Thoreson said "the parents in the parent associ

ation benefit more from the social/psychological
support than the diet itself."
"Only a small number of hyperactive or hyper
kinetic children are allergic to food additives, so
the Finegold Diet is not a major solution."
Thoreson complained of the indiscriminate use
of the term "hyperactivity."
"We are skeptical of global complaints by pa
rents or teachers. We are more impressed with
documented behavior," he said.
