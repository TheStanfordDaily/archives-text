# Parking fines may increase
## Many citations issued 
### SUSAN ESSOYAN 
Thousands of people gambled —
and lost — when they parked their
cars illegally on campus last year, ac
cording to Chief Marvin Herrington
of the Department of Public Safety.
But because parking ticket fines
are so low, the gamblers didn't lose
much. The bulk of the 54,000 cita
tions issued last year — an average of
two to three tickets per car — cost

violators $2, Herrington said. These
parking tickets were issued primarily
to those parking without permits, or
those with stickers but parked in the
wrong zones.
Many violators figure that they
would have to receive 30 citations to
equal the cost of an "A" permit ($6O)
and "they are willing to take their
chances," Herrington said.
Herrington said he hopes to cut
down on the number of violations by
increasing the penalties for illegal
parking. He said he has tried to get
the fines raised to $5, which he hopes
would decrease the number of cita
tions and allow better enforcement.
But raising the fines is up to the
courts, he added.
Even with the present low fines,
many violators do not pay within the
required 11-day period after receiv
ing tickets. At that point fines are
raised to $4, and a warrant is issued
for the arrest of violators, according
to Phyllis Anderson, traffic super
visor at the Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
If violators with warrants are stop
ped for any reason, including traffic
violations, such as running a stop
sign, they are sent to jail, Herrington
said. A routine computer check on
license numbers reveals any out
standing warrants, he said.
Those who avoid being stopped by
a peace officer may be caught
through another computer check,
Herrington said. A law which went
into eftect last January prevents indi
viduals from renewing driver's
licenses and automobile licenses un
less all citations are cleared.
This law is designed to help elimi
nate the backlog of tickets which are
"drowning the courts," according to
Herrington. But it doesn't com
pletely solve the problem of en
forcement because it does not apply
to out-of-state violators, some of
who are the most flagrant, Her
rington said.
But there is another law which
applies to people with out-of-state
licenses. Enforcement officials leg
ally can tow away an out-of-state car
which has received five citations, at
owner expense.
Impounding a car is more effective
than a fine, Herrington said, because
"issuing a citation doesn't move the
car." Also, violators who have had
their cars towed away are unlikely to
repeat the violation because it se
verely inconveniences them and to
wing costs range from $30 to $50, ac
cording to Herrington.
The Department of Public Safety
now is considering a pilot program of
tow-aways in a frequently violated
loading and service vehicle zone be
hind the Terman Engineering Build
ing.

"drowning the courts," according to
Herrington. But it doesn't com
pletely solve the problem of en
forcement because it does not apply
to out-of-state violators, some of
who are the most flagrant, Her
rington said.
But there is another law which
applies to people with out-of-state
licenses. Enforcement officials leg
ally can tow away an out-of-state car
which has received five citations, at
owner expense.
Impounding a car is more effective
than a fine, Herrington said, because
"issuing a citation doesn't move the
car." Also, violators who have had
their cars towed away are unlikely to
repeat the violation because it se
verely inconveniences them and to
wing costs range from $30 to $50, ac
cording to Herrington.
The Department of Public Safety
now is considering a pilot program of
tow-aways in a frequently violated
loading and service vehicle zone be
hind the Terman Engineering Build
ing.
Thousands of people gambled —
and lost — when they parked their
cars illegally on campus last year, ac
cording to Chief Marvin Herrington
of the Department of Public Safety.
But because parking ticket fines
are so low, the gamblers didn't lose
much. The bulk of the 54,000 cita
tions issued last year — an average of
two to three tickets per car — cost

violators $2, Herrington said. These
parking tickets were issued primarily
to those parking without permits, or
those with stickers but parked in the
wrong zones.
Many violators figure that they
would have to receive 30 citations to
equal the cost of an "A" permit ($6O)
and "they are willing to take their
chances," Herrington said.
Herrington said he hopes to cut
down on the number of violations by
increasing the penalties for illegal
parking. He said he has tried to get
the fines raised to $5, which he hopes
would decrease the number of cita
tions and allow better enforcement.
But raising the fines is up to the
courts, he added.
Even with the present low fines,
many violators do not pay within the
required 11-day period after receiv
ing tickets. At that point fines are
raised to $4, and a warrant is issued
for the arrest of violators, according
to Phyllis Anderson, traffic super
visor at the Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
If violators with warrants are stop
ped for any reason, including traffic
violations, such as running a stop
sign, they are sent to jail, Herrington
said. A routine computer check on
license numbers reveals any out
standing warrants, he said.
Those who avoid being stopped by
a peace officer may be caught
through another computer check,
Herrington said. A law which went
into eftect last January prevents indi
viduals from renewing driver's
licenses and automobile licenses un
less all citations are cleared.
This law is designed to help elimi
nate the backlog of tickets which are
"drowning the courts," according to
Herrington. But it doesn't com
