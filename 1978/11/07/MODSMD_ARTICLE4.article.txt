# University building maintenance centralized
## 
### ART STEIN 
The Department of Plant Services is centralizing
University building maintenance according to Di
rector of Service Operations jason Mavis.
However, this centralization, begun Nov. 1, may
decrease the quality of maintenance in Escondido
Village, according to some Escondido residents.
Jonathan Siegel of the Escondido Village Coun
cil compared the centralization of building
maintenance to the centralization of grounds
maintenance in March 1976. According to another
resident, this centralization made workers re
sponsible to the University as a whole and not to
Escondido Village, thus decreasing the quality of
grounds work in the village.
The resident said that lawns are being gouged by
heavy mowers when the grass is wet, the grass is
not being properly edged, and trash is not being
cleared off the ground in some areas.
At the same time, according to Siegel, the cost of
ground maintenance has been increasing at a rate
of about 20 percent per year, despite the decrease
in service.
Siegel said this increase could not be explained

in terms of inflation, labor costs, additional
equipment purchase, or drought.
He added the centralization is more University
bureaucracy. It just "adds a middle man between
Escondido Village and the grounds workers," he
added.
"Now as of Nov. 1, the building maintenance
program is centralized. This came down without
consultation of the village," he said.
Three years ago, the grounds maintenance
program was divided into three parts: the campus,
undergraduate housing and Escondido Village. No
comprehensive plan, schedule, equipment
analysis or cost accounting was completed for
each of these sections, Mavis said.
At this time a complete inventory was taken of
the campus grounds. It included measurement of
lawn and shrub area, number of trees, linear foot
age of edging and pruning, equipment and fre
quency of grounds work, said Mavis.
It was decided that it would be much more effi
cient to centralize the ground maintenance prog
ram. This would reduce the duplication of equip
ment in each area and allow workers to be more

efficient by doing one job all at once on different
parts of the campus instead of completing many
different tasks in one small area of the campus, he
said.
The same reasoning is the justification for build
ing maintenance, he added.
A small group of workers is left in Escondido for
emergency repairs. They can immediately re
spond to any emergencies the residents may en
counter, such as broken windows and clogged
sinks or toilets, he added.
The pre-centralization and post-centralization
costs can not be compared, said Assistant Director
for Finance and Management Jim Morgan. The ac
counting system has changed, he said. The pre
centralization figures did not include any over
head costs such as management, telephone, or
laundry expenses, while these costs were in
cluded in the post-centralization figures, accord
ing to Horgan.
Even if these figures could be compared, the
increase is not outrageous. In the same period,
water and sewer expenses increased 18 percent,
he added.

The Department of Plant Services is centralizing
University building maintenance according to Di
rector of Service Operations jason Mavis.
However, this centralization, begun Nov. 1, may
decrease the quality of maintenance in Escondido
Village, according to some Escondido residents.
Jonathan Siegel of the Escondido Village Coun
cil compared the centralization of building
maintenance to the centralization of grounds
maintenance in March 1976. According to another
resident, this centralization made workers re
sponsible to the University as a whole and not to
Escondido Village, thus decreasing the quality of
grounds work in the village.
The resident said that lawns are being gouged by
heavy mowers when the grass is wet, the grass is
not being properly edged, and trash is not being
cleared off the ground in some areas.
At the same time, according to Siegel, the cost of
ground maintenance has been increasing at a rate
of about 20 percent per year, despite the decrease
in service.
Siegel said this increase could not be explained

in terms of inflation, labor costs, additional
equipment purchase, or drought.
He added the centralization is more University
bureaucracy. It just "adds a middle man between
Escondido Village and the grounds workers," he
added.
"Now as of Nov. 1, the building maintenance
program is centralized. This came down without
consultation of the village," he said.
Three years ago, the grounds maintenance
program was divided into three parts: the campus,
undergraduate housing and Escondido Village. No
comprehensive plan, schedule, equipment
analysis or cost accounting was completed for
each of these sections, Mavis said.
At this time a complete inventory was taken of
the campus grounds. It included measurement of
lawn and shrub area, number of trees, linear foot
age of edging and pruning, equipment and fre
quency of grounds work, said Mavis.
It was decided that it would be much more effi
cient to centralize the ground maintenance prog
ram. This would reduce the duplication of equip
ment in each area and allow workers to be more

efficient by doing one job all at once on different
parts of the campus instead of completing many
different tasks in one small area of the campus, he
said.
The same reasoning is the justification for build
ing maintenance, he added.
A small group of workers is left in Escondido for
emergency repairs. They can immediately re
spond to any emergencies the residents may en
counter, such as broken windows and clogged
sinks or toilets, he added.
The pre-centralization and post-centralization
costs can not be compared, said Assistant Director
for Finance and Management Jim Morgan. The ac
counting system has changed, he said. The pre
centralization figures did not include any over
head costs such as management, telephone, or
laundry expenses, while these costs were in
cluded in the post-centralization figures, accord
ing to Horgan.
Even if these figures could be compared, the
increase is not outrageous. In the same period,
water and sewer expenses increased 18 percent,
he added.
