# McCloskey-Nunn proposal for 18-year-olds
## Combat-ready concern spurs national service plan 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
In 1972, Palo Alto's Congressman Pete
McCloskey made headlines by challeng
ing Richard Nixon for the Republican
presidential nomination in opposition to
the Vietnam War. One of the results of
the bitterness caused by that war was the
abolition of the peacetime draft. But now
McCloskey, along with Sen. Sam Nunn
(D-Ga.), is proposing to reinstate a prog
ram resembling the draft in the form of a
national service plan for all 18-year-old
Americans.
McCloskey said that his "principal con
cern is the lack of combat-readiness in
today's volunteer army, and the failure of
current law to give us a combat-ready

army." He added that Pentagon officials
feel that the present caliber of people
enlisting in the military is not sufficient to
provide an effective fighting force.
Inquiry magazine, quoting the figures
of the Senate Armed Services Subcom
mittee on Manpower and Personnel,
which Nunn chairs, states that 44 percent
of those who enlisted in the all-volunteer
army last year did not have a high school
diploma. Only 5 percent had ever been to
college, a third were minorities and most
were poor and under-educated.
Speaking in a debate with his election
opponents last week, McCloskey told an
audience here that at present, no
"reasonable young men" would enlist in
the army.
No 'reasonable young men'
"Let me ask how many reasonable
young men there are in this room tonight
— black, white or Chicano — who would
choose to spend two years running 20
miles a day and prepare themselves to
fight on 24 hours notice," he told his au
dience.
McCloskey said another problem with
the all-volunteer plan is that it is impossi
ble to maintain an army reserve. In the
past, he explained, men could enlist for
six months to a year, serve six to eight
months in the reserves, and be immune
to the draft. Under the present system,
there is no incentive to join such a prog
ram. Furthermore, there is a high attrition

rate. Four out of 10 leave the service be
fore they finish their first year and deser
tion is higher than it was during the Viet
nam War, according to Inquiry.
McCloskey said that in the average rifle
company of 250 men, 200 have less than
one year's experience.
McCloskey's plan would mean that
each American would enter government
service at the age of 18. Each person
would be able to choose either a year of
military service, followed by four years of
college at the government's expense; or
choose two years of government labor in
hospitals, the forestry service or agricul
ture. Each 18-year-old would list a prefer
red choice, but a lottery system similar to
the one used in past drafts would be used
to fill the military if necessary, McCloskey
said.
Past drafts unfair
McCloskey charged that past drafts, as
well as the present system, are unfair.
During the Vietnam War he said that 44
percent of the American casualties were
minorities — who make up only 20 per
cent of the American population.
He said he agrees with his minority cri
tics who say "we won't fight your im
perialist wars," but added that "they can't
have it both ways."
There should either be a draft, or
minorities will continue to bear the brunt
of any American casualties, he said.
The proposed national service plan

would allow no college deferments, a
clause which McCloskey said forced a
disproportionate number of those who
couldn't attend college into the service in
the past.
McCloskey said that his plan would not
increase the size of the U.S. standing
army, which now numbers six-and-a-half
combat divisions and three marine divi
sions of 200,000 men each. The new draft
would induct no more than one million
persons each year, according to McClos
key.
He added he felt that American at
tempts to increase the combat-readiness
of its army would not alarm the Soviets
sufficiently to increase tensions between
the two countries. After all, he said, "the
Russians have conscription too."
Budget would not increase
McCloskey also argued that a renewed
draft would not increase the U.S. federal*
budget. Many of the services that would
be encouraged under McCloskey's
proposed plan already are provided by
private firms paid by the government. He
said jobs such as forestry, agriculture and
soil conservation are "tasks young
people can perform as well as anyone."
He added that the costs of running an
agency to provide these services would
cost less than providing them does now.
The congressman likened the national
government labor program to the Com
prehensive Educational Training Act

(CETA), which distributes $7 billion a year
to cities and counties with minimal
bureaucracy for the hiring of temporary
employees.
McCloskey argued that young Ameri
cans would not oppose induction into
service too strenuously. "The hostilities
of the '60s focused on the war," he said.
As long as young people saw the draft as
contributing to a good cause — national
safety — they were not opposed to it, he
said.
McCloskey said that the statements
made by his opponents in last week's de
bate that America would have fewer wars
if the congressmen and generals were
landing on the beaches, were similar to
his statements in Congress 10 years ago
attacking the war in Indochina. McClos
key said he opposed the Vietnam War,
not military service.
Mandatory government
McCloskey said that while mandatory
government service may not be the
"most pleasant thing," it is not all detri
mental.
"Most students today are dropping out
to spend a year working or traveling," he
said. "A year in the Peace Corps or VISTA
is almost as good an education."
For those who enter the arfny, the ex
marine said that boot camp is not a pleas
ant experience to undergo, but that most
peoplefind looking back on it that it was a
good experience.
