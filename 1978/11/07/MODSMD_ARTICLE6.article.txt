In the mid-1930s a
Washington D.C. adminis
trator sent Theo Jung out with
his camera to photograph a
small town in the South.
"When I first arrived I thought,
'My God! How can this be pos
sible in 20th century America?'
People were living in log ca
bins."
Jung, a Palo Alto resident
and former calligraphy instruc
tor here, worked with other
photographers during the
Creat Depression for the Farm
Securities Administration
(FSA). "We showed what
needed to be corrected and
what needed to be ap
preciated. Unemployment was
really threatening rural life."
In a show at the Palo Alto
Cultural Center, Jung has or
ganized a collection of photo
graphs documenting rural life
in the '30s, and '40s, many of
the photographs are his.
"I was first hired by the So
cial Security people to docu
ment various social problems
they wanted to deal with like
help for the handicapped or ill
or those with fatherless chil
dren," Jung recalls.
Jung joined the FSA team of
photographers to record
America's farms, towns and the
roads between, he said.
Others that joined, the team
included Walker Evans, Ben
Shahn, Dorothea Lange and
Jack Delano. FSA always had at

least five photographers. Jung
said.
"We were generally as
signed to a territory which
we'd be sent out to cover for a
period of from several weeks
up to several months. After a
time we'd send back the nega
tives and the lab would print
them up for publication."
Many photos in the Palo Alto
show document "everyday
scenes" in small towns and
farm fields. A Walker Evans
photo, entitled "Main Street,
Seat of Hale County," depicts a
sunny afternoon, idlers roam
ing about. In another,
Dorothea Lange's portrait of
farm workers in a California
field is shown.
Jung criticized Roy Stryker,
director of the photography
division of FSA, for occasion
ally wanting "heart throb pic
tures, pictures with an obvious
message. I didn't think the pic
tures had to have a message. I
was interested in recording the
physical evidence.
"I was interested in the nor
mal parts of everyday life
everyone was connected with,
their automobiles, their quick
service food gadgets.
"Once I did a whole series of
shots showing the processes in
a sorghum mill."
Some photos were used for
press releases to show the
work FSA was doing in prog
rams to combat the Depres
sion's problems, Jung said.

Reports with pictures were
sent to farmers, the reports
suggested methods for con
trolling erosion.
"The Republicans of the time
didn't like what we were doing.
Congressional committees at
tacked the FSA for 'misrepre
senting the drought prob
lem.' "
In all approximately 70,000
prints were made during the
project. Following his years
working for FSA, Jung worked
for other governmental de
partments.
"It was a terrifically exciting
time in Washington. There was
just a Mushrooming of cultural
activities. Artistically it was a
productive time for the United
States."
Photo documentaries were

"a new thing back then," Jung
said.
Many new government
sponsored activities like the
FSA project began, he said.
Jung spent four years or
ganizing the retrospective
shots of the '30s. He first of
fered the collection to the
American House in Vienna,
Va., but authorities there
didn't want the photographs.
"I don't think they wanted to
show that America had had its
time of troubles in the '30s.
"I think they were wrong,
these photos are testimony to
the endurance of that entire
period," Jung said.
lung's career was tied to
photography and publications
after his career with the FSA.
For several years he spent

weekends in Harper's Ferry,
W.Va., where he took pictures
of people and scenes in the
town. For five years, in the
early 70s, Jung worked for the
University News and Publica
tions Department, designing
and laying out pamphlets to
publicize Unjversity programs.
Then, as a calligraphy
teacher in the Undergraduate
Special program here, )ung
pursued a developing interest
in writing and printing. Today
lettered scripts adorn the walls
of his Palo Alto apartment.
Because of recent problems
with his eyes, lung has been
unable to photograph for the
past few years. "I got antsy the
other day, though. I just had to
take some pictures; its been
too long."
