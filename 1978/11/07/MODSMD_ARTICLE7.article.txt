# Hospital to build family center
## 
### LEAH HALPER 
What could Ronald
McDonald, the National Foot
ball League's (NFL) Oakland
Raiderettes and local political
aspirants have in common with
the Stanford Children's Hospi
tal?
They share a concern for the
families of children at the hos
pital. Sunday, a benefit held at
The Antique, a Palo Alto re
staurant, drew funds to contri
bute to the Children's Hospital
Family Center, a center which
will house the parents and sibl
ings of bedridden hospital
children, according to Vicki
Applegate, director of the Uni
versity's drive to renovate a
25-year-old building which will
house the center. Proceeds
from McDonald's promotional
drives in Northern California
are also being donated to the
center, which is scheduled to
open this February.
"The center will be a big
home for them (parents) to stay
in, a patient service whereby
parents can stay close to their
children without having to go
to the hospital," Applegate
said. "One parent is presently
encouraged to stay with the
children at the hospital, which

is very comforting to the child.
But we're just not equipped to
handle all of the parents. This
way, parents will congregate,
meet each other, and they
won't have to stay in expensive
motels. They'll be right out the
back door of the hospital."
Applegate said blueprint de
signs for the center provide for
12 private rooms with baths for
each family unit. The building
will also offer large communal
television room, dining and re
creation rooms. A $5-a-night
fee, waived for families which
can't afford to pay, will be re
quested by users of the facility.
Building costs will total
$300,000, Applegate said.
Northern California
McDonald's operators and
owners chose the University to
receive funds from their
promotional efforts. The
center is unofficially titled
"Ronald McDonald's Stanford
Family House." Three other
Ronald McDonald houses have
been built in various U.S. cities
and approximately 16 more are
in the planning stages.
McDonald's Corp. chose the
University to receive funds
after touring six other Bay Area
hospitals.

"Stanford serves the North
ern California area," Jim
Bunker, consultant for Califor
nia's McDonald's advertising
program, said. "The purpose
of Sunday's benefit was first, to
draw people to the restaurant
with the Raiderettes and all.
The more people who came,
the more money benefits we'd
have for the hospital, since the
Antique Restaurant donated all
the money they made yester
day. The second reason was to
give political candidates a
forum for their views."
Bunker said the Raiderettes,
who came late, challenged
teams mustered by local sheriff
candidate James Geary and Bay
Area congressional candidate
Dave Welch, to volleyball
games at the restaurant's out
side court.
Paul Sassano, manager of
The Antique restaurant, said
yesterday he did not know how
much money was raised for the
project. One problem, he said,
was that the Raiderettes disap
pointed patrons by coming
late.

Applegate said blueprint de
signs for the center provide for
12 private rooms with baths for
each family unit. The building
will also offer large communal
television room, dining and re
creation rooms. A $5-a-night

Building costs will total

McDonald's operators and

center is unofficially titled
"Ronald McDonald's Stanford
Family House." Three other
Ronald McDonald houses have
been built in various U.S. cities

McDonald's Corp. chose the

after touring six other Bay Area
hospitals.

"Stanford serves the North

Bunker, consultant for Califor

program, said. "The purpose
of Sunday's benefit was first, to
draw people to the restaurant
with the Raiderettes and all.
The more people who came,
the more money benefits we'd
have for the hospital, since the
Antique Restaurant donated all
the money they made yester
day. The second reason was to
give political candidates a
forum for their views."
Bunker said the Raiderettes,
who came late, challenged
teams mustered by local sheriff
candidate James Geary and Bay
Area congressional candidate
Dave Welch, to volleyball
games at the restaurant's out
side court.
Paul Sassano, manager of
The Antique restaurant, said
yesterday he did not know how
much money was raised for the
project. One problem, he said,
was that the Raiderettes disap
pointed patrons by coming
late.

The Antique, a Palo Alto re

Family Center, a center which
will house the parents and sibl

children, according to Vicki

house the center. Proceeds
from McDonald's promotional

"The center will be a big
home for them (parents) to stay
in, a patient service whereby
parents can stay close to their
children without having to go
to the hospital," Applegate
said. "One parent is presently
encouraged to stay with the
children at the hospital, which

is very comforting to the child.
