## Lois Nesbitt Self-survival while biking 
### 
At the risk of beating a dead
horse, I'd like to bring up the
subject of biking on campus
one more time. I've heard too
many horror stories and seen
too many friends join the ranks
of pedestrians in self-defense
to ignore the problem.
Bike accidents are more
common here than pre-meds. I
myself have been the victim of
two rather spectacular solos in
the last 17 days. That's .12 acci
dents per day, 0r28.8 accidents
per school year. Unless hang
ing out at Cowell is your thing,
there's got to be a better way.
Take a look at the definition
of bicycle: "a vehicle with two
wheels, a steering handle, a
saddle seat, and pedals by
which it is propelled."
Now take a look at White
Plaza on a weekday morning
between classes. How is it that
these innocuous machines
have become vehicles of de
struction, the single
largest crippler on the Stanford
campus? I would like to
suggest that this is because
Stanford students, to whom
individuality is Cod, practice
personality assertion every
time they hop on the old two
wheeler. Several types of
characters are particularly con
spicuous.
Number one on the list is
"ace of space." This is the guy
who cruises around with a
dreamy look in his eyes. All is
well until he gets within 50 feet
of another cycle. At this point
indecision transforms his face
into a perplexed scramble of
features rivalled only by those
of freshmen at the first Chem
31 midterm. Hesitating on
whether to go to the right or
left, he invariably collides with,
or comes within inches of, the
other cycle. Needless to say,
fear has made him forget to
brake and chances are good for
a dented front rim.
Second comes the social cy
cler. This guy knows 90 percent
of the people in White Plaza at
any given moment and feels
sincerely obligated to acknow
ledge a good 75 percent while

not losing any momentum.
Careful riding makes it easy
enough to avoid a crash with
the social cycler, but pedest
rians are warned that he may
swerve into them at any mo
ment with a "Hi" and an affec
tionate grin.
Another popular group are
the speeders. Full conscious of
their alleged superiority (and
the fact that they are 20 mi
nutes late for their 9 o'clock
section), these types are totally
oblivious to the rest of the
human race. However, they do
have an uncanny knowledge of
the campus topography. They
invariable avoid every pothole,
ditch, puddle, high curb and
gravel slide the rest of us keep
discovering.
The last group are not true
bikers, but the novelty seek
ers. These guys, in a quest for
the unique (and for attention,
it is assumed), ride unicycles,
mopeds, skateboards and skis
on wheels. Though usually
careful in their own manuev
ers, they distract the bikers
enough to chalk up a few more
wrecks.
Since there isn't much you
can do about other cyclers,
here are some "don'ts" of
bicycle riding on the Farm.
—Don't carry anything that
won't fit in your knapsack. Par
ticularly threatening are post
ers, plants, lacrosse sticks and
roommates.
—Don't even consider toe
clips, unless you love your bike
enough to take it head first into
the gravel with you.
—Don't borrow other
people's bikes. The classic ex
ample is a friend of mine who
tried to ride a bike one handed
because his left arm was in a
cast. He discovered, cruising
along Campus Drive, that the
hand brake on his good side
was broken. Making a fast right
onto a side street, he managed
to slow the bike down before
disaster struck. Don't try it.
—Don't ride at night without
a light. Or, more to the point,
don't get caught at it. Last year
the police nailed students near

Meyer with $15 tickets for that.
—Don't ride your bike to
parties, sherry hours, study
breaks, or any social function
where you might be tempted
to consume alcohol. One
happy hour last fall taught me
this first hand and it ain't fun.
Coordination and mixed
drinks just don't spend much
time together.
My last word is this — if
you're going to have an acci
dent, at least do it where you
won't be seen. And as you
crawl back onto your bike, start
thinking up some good ex
cuses for those scraped knees
and twisted handle bars.
