Need to align
economy with
social priorities
I submit this as an open letter
to Stephen Maxwell, in whose
open letter to Jane Fonda
(Daily, Oct. 27) he conveys the
"disgraceful truth" that "war
and the growth of military
power have, over the history of
the U.S. and the world, contri
buted more to economic
growth and equality than any
other single factor."
Concepts like "the military,"
"war" and "economic growth"
are wonderful classroom
abstractions when dealt with
on that level only. But these
things aren't simply the pro
ducts of the meanderings of
your Economics 1 profes
sor's mind. So before you tell
me and the rest of the Stanford
community what wonders our
military spending is doing for
our economic growth and
equality, tell it to the people of
Southeast Asia or the Ameri
cans who were killed or
maimed fighting there. (I might
add that the poor — for whom
you claim war is so beneficial
— formed the vast majority of
this latter group.)
Tell it to the people of
Nicaragua who are suffering
and dying at the hands of a dic
tatorship propped up by the
U.S. for 45 years. Ask them
about equality. Or maybe
you'd like to asii the people of
japan for their thoughts on ad
vanced weaponry and its rela
tion to their general well-being
over the past few decades. Or
start by talking to some of your
classmates from Iran about
U.S. military influence in their
country.
I don't think many of us were
in need of your admonition
that "there are no pat

answers," and I'm certain we
all could have done without
your treatise on the value of
war and military growth to the
poor. And finally, in reference
to your closing comments, the
important thing is not merely
"learning how our economy is
influenced by changes in social
priorities." The important
thing is to learn how we must
change our economy in order
to bring it into consonance
with our social priorities.

Give our
signs back
The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) has just had
its two road signs ripped off.
This represents a financial loss
of $148.56 to the center at a
time when we can barely afford
to replace them.
If the persons who find our
signs so attractive would be
willing to return them or pay
for them, we should be willing
to consider the incident as a
Halloween prank.
This is the second time our
signs have been stolen. While
such sophomoric practices
may be amusing to some
members of the Stanford
community, for us they consti
tute a sad waste of money. Do
we get the signs back (or our
$148.56) after Halloween?

Danger in jump
starting a car
Please note that the As
sociated Press articles on jump
starting a car, though very de

tailed, was still incorrect. The
article says that after connect
ing the positive terminals, the
negative cable should next be
connected to the negative ter
minal of the good battery, and
finally to the negative terminal
of the "dead" battery. This is a
dangerous situation, as the
final connection (that is, the
connection that completes the
circuit) will spark. This spark
may ignite the hydrogen gas
present near a discharged bat
tery, exploding the battery,
and squirting sulfuric acid all
over hell.
Most owner's manuals give
the following sequence for
safely jump starting a "dead"
battery. First, and most impor
tantly, determine absolutely
which terminal is positive and
which is negative on both bat
teries. The color of the cables
connected to the terminals is
not necessarily a good indi
cator, as replacement cables
are almost always red, even if
used for the negative terminal.
Second, connect the positive
terminals. Finally, connect the
jumper cable to the negative
terminal of the good battery,
then to the ground of the car
with the dead battery. (The
ground is any part of the en
gine, or body.) Be careful that
the jumper cable will not inter
fere with something once the
engine starts. You know that
you have a good connection if
there is a spark.
It is a common misconcep
tion that jumpinga "dead" bat
tery is a simple and safe opera
tion. It is in fact something that
must be done with great care.
It is not a hypothetical prob
lem, dreamed up by the OSH A
— batteries can and will
explode if improperly con
nected.
