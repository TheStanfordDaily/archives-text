Perry from Vanderbilt '
Why don't you drop Psych I, before it's too late. Vespa
Mopeds do contain one chain. But it's used only when you pedal. The
belt drive from the engine is more refined, quieter, and cleaner than
a chain. The scooter uses direct drive (like the most expensive motor
cycles) because Vespa is a kind, well-adjusted company.
Dear Vittoria, Vittoria
Your column is obviously a capitalist shuck to sell people Vespa Scooters
and Mopeds. Always talking ploys like economy and ecology But what
do you drive yourself? I bet you have an expensive, gas-guzzling Italian
sports car, that s what I bet. Carlos from NYCC
Dear Carlos,
I myself mostly zip around town on my Vespa Moped I also happen to
own my grandfather s 1927 Hispano-Suiza limousine, but I had it
stuffed and hung over the mantel in my penthouse.

Dear Carlos,
I myself mostly zip around town on my Vespa Moped I also happen to
own my grandfather s 1927 Hispano-Suiza limousine, but I had it
stuffed and hung over the mantel in my penthouse.

Why don't you drop Psych I, before it's too late. Vespa
Mopeds do contain one chain. But it's used only when you pedal. The
belt drive from the engine is more refined, quieter, and cleaner than
a chain. The scooter uses direct drive (like the most expensive motor
cycles) because Vespa is a kind, well-adjusted company.
Dear Vittoria, Vittoria
Your column is obviously a capitalist shuck to sell people Vespa Scooters
and Mopeds. Always talking ploys like economy and ecology But what
do you drive yourself? I bet you have an expensive, gas-guzzling Italian
sports car, that s what I bet. Carlos from NYCC
