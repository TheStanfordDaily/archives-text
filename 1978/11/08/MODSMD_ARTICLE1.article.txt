# Brown beats Younger; Dymally loses to Curb
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown won a lopsided re-election
victory yesterday and promised
Californians "a leaner, more austere
government" for the next four
years.
With nearly 40 percent of the
statewide vote counted, Brown held
a 19 percent lead over Younger,
1,594,092 to 1,039,224.
But despite the Democratic gov
ernor's strong victory over Republi
can Evelle Younger, Californians
elected Republican Mike Curb as
lieutenant governor and George
Deukmejian as attorney general.
Curb led incumbent Lt. Gov. Mer
vyn Dymally and Deukemjian led
Democratic nominee Yvonne Burke
all evening, and each ran about 20
percentage points ahead of Republi
can registration figures.
In other races, Chief justice Rose
Bird withstood a strong conservative
attack to win by a narrow margin a
lull 12-year term on the California
Supreme Court.
With 60.9 percent of the votes
counted, 52 percent, 1,952,952, ap
proved the appointment of Bird
while 47.9 percent, 1,800,568 voted
against retaining her as the state's
most powerful judge.
Bird's victory came less than a
week after her 42nd birthday.
Three associate justices, two ap
pointed by Brown and one named to
the court by former Gov. Ronald
Reagan, were winning voter ap
proval in the early returns.
Wiley Manuel, the first black on

the court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and Frank
Richardson, a conservative and
Reagan s last court appointee,
jumped to early leads.
Republican Mike Curb, a mil
lionaire record producer, defeated
incumbent Mervyn Dymally to be
come the tirst lieutenant governor
since 1894 to belong to a different
party than the governor.
With 57 percent of the votes tal
lied, Curb had received 2,016,832
votes to Dymally's 1,729,221 for a
51-44 percent margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
pledged that he would carry over his
success in business to the lieutenant
governor's job, had said activation
of the state's Economic Develop
ment Commission would be one of
his top priorities.
"Ibis is the greatest honor you
could possibly give me," Curb told a
cheering crowd of supporters in Los
Angeles. "I had the opportunity to
start a business from scratch and to
create jobs, but the opportunity to
serve in government is the most im
portant thing to me."
Dymally, the state's first black
lieutenant governor, had hoped that
the narrow gap between himself and
Curb in late campaign polls would
be bridged by a coattail effect from a
strong victory by Brown.
But late support from Brown, who
defeated Attorney General Evelle
Younger, was not enough to combat
the momentum Curb had built ear
lier in the fall during a bitter, mud

slinging campaign.
George Deukmejian, author of
California's death penalty, defeated
Yvonne Burke, the state's first black
congresswoman, in the attorney
general's race.
Calling it a "victory for law en
forcement," the Republican state
senator told cheering supporters he
would work with the governor,
Legislature, judges and law en
forcement to fight crime.
With more than 35 percent of the
vote tallied, the Long Beach senator,
who had run a law-and-order cam
paign, had 1,319,549 to 1,105,710 for
Burke, a Los Angeles Democrat, for
a 52.2-43.7 lead.
The victory for Deukmejian ended
Burke's bid to become the first black
woman ever elected state attorney
general in the nation.
The victory also fulfilled the
dream of Deukmejian's 16-year
legislative career, giving him the
post he had sought unsuccessfully
in the GOP primary in 1970.
In other statewide races, Democ
ratic incumbents won easily over
their Republican challengers. Sec

who was reprimanded by Congress
in the Korean influence buying
scandal, was defeated by Republican
Norman Shumway, but two other

Republicans by 2.3 million voters,
Burke was rated the slight underdog
against Deukmejian, a conservative
Republican state senator who au
thored California's death penalty.
Deukmejian portrayed Burke,
who is a foe of the death penalty, as
being soft on crime, while she at
tempted to portray him as a captiVe
of corporate special interests.
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown won a lopsided re-election
victory yesterday and promised
Californians "a leaner, more austere
government" for the next four
years.
With nearly 40 percent of the
statewide vote counted, Brown held
a 19 percent lead over Younger,
1,594,092 to 1,039,224.
But despite the Democratic gov
ernor's strong victory over Republi
can Evelle Younger, Californians
elected Republican Mike Curb as
lieutenant governor and George
Deukmejian as attorney general.
Curb led incumbent Lt. Gov. Mer
vyn Dymally and Deukemjian led
Democratic nominee Yvonne Burke
all evening, and each ran about 20
percentage points ahead of Republi
can registration figures.
In other races, Chief justice Rose
Bird withstood a strong conservative
attack to win by a narrow margin a
lull 12-year term on the California
Supreme Court.
With 60.9 percent of the votes
counted, 52 percent, 1,952,952, ap
proved the appointment of Bird
while 47.9 percent, 1,800,568 voted
against retaining her as the state's
most powerful judge.
Bird's victory came less than a
week after her 42nd birthday.
Three associate justices, two ap
pointed by Brown and one named to
the court by former Gov. Ronald
Reagan, were winning voter ap
proval in the early returns.
Wiley Manuel, the first black on

the court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and Frank
Richardson, a conservative and
Reagan s last court appointee,
jumped to early leads.
Republican Mike Curb, a mil
lionaire record producer, defeated
incumbent Mervyn Dymally to be
come the tirst lieutenant governor
since 1894 to belong to a different
party than the governor.
With 57 percent of the votes tal
lied, Curb had received 2,016,832
votes to Dymally's 1,729,221 for a
51-44 percent margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
pledged that he would carry over his
success in business to the lieutenant
governor's job, had said activation
of the state's Economic Develop
ment Commission would be one of
his top priorities.
"Ibis is the greatest honor you
could possibly give me," Curb told a
cheering crowd of supporters in Los
Angeles. "I had the opportunity to
start a business from scratch and to
create jobs, but the opportunity to
serve in government is the most im
portant thing to me."
Dymally, the state's first black
lieutenant governor, had hoped that
the narrow gap between himself and
Curb in late campaign polls would
be bridged by a coattail effect from a
strong victory by Brown.
But late support from Brown, who
defeated Attorney General Evelle
Younger, was not enough to combat
the momentum Curb had built ear
lier in the fall during a bitter, mud

slinging campaign.
George Deukmejian, author of
California's death penalty, defeated
Yvonne Burke, the state's first black
congresswoman, in the attorney
general's race.
Calling it a "victory for law en
forcement," the Republican state
senator told cheering supporters he
would work with the governor,
Legislature, judges and law en
forcement to fight crime.
With more than 35 percent of the
vote tallied, the Long Beach senator,
who had run a law-and-order cam
paign, had 1,319,549 to 1,105,710 for
Burke, a Los Angeles Democrat, for
a 52.2-43.7 lead.
The victory for Deukmejian ended
Burke's bid to become the first black
woman ever elected state attorney
general in the nation.
The victory also fulfilled the
dream of Deukmejian's 16-year
legislative career, giving him the
post he had sought unsuccessfully
in the GOP primary in 1970.

Asked if he might run for presi

locked nothing in and nothing out."
If Brown does have presidential
ambitions in 1980, Curb's victory
complicates his plans considerably,
since the lieutenant governor as

Commenting on the races for
lieutenant governor and attorney
general, Brown — who had been
criticized by other Democrats for his
late and limited help — commented,
"There was nothing else I could

His political coattails "obviously

In a concession speech before a
silent crowd at his campaign head
quarters, Younger said he offered
Brown "my good wishes." He said
he was disappointed, but "we've
had a contest and the people have
made their decision."

The race for governor started out
close, with Younger tied with Brown
or leading in various polls six
months ago. in part due to Brown's
vehement opposition to Proposition
13.
But Younger stumbled repeatedly,
and Brown seized the initiative in
leading legislative efforts to make
Proposition 13 work while Younger,
a reluctant supporter of 13, kept a
low profile.
Republicans tried to take advan
tage of Brown's switch on 13, but the
Democratic governor — declaring
himself "a born-again tax cutter" —
replied simply that he was obeying
the mandate of voters to cut gov
ernment, and he topped 13's $7 bill
ion property tax cut with an addi
tional $1 billion state income tax cut.
By October, polls reported that
Brown's handling of Proposition 13
was one of his strongest points, and
only a minority of voters were at all
concerned with his early opposition
to the tax revolt initiative.
The race for lieutenant governor
was dominated by smears of both
candidates. Curb predicted Dymally
would be indicted for unspecified
criminal acts, and Dymally distri

Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown won a lopsided re-election
victory yesterday and promised
Californians "a leaner, more austere
government" for the next four
years.
With nearly 40 percent of the
statewide vote counted, Brown held
a 19 percent lead over Younger,
1,594,092 to 1,039,224.
But despite the Democratic gov
ernor's strong victory over Republi
can Evelle Younger, Californians
elected Republican Mike Curb as
lieutenant governor and George
Deukmejian as attorney general.
Curb led incumbent Lt. Gov. Mer
vyn Dymally and Deukemjian led
Democratic nominee Yvonne Burke
all evening, and each ran about 20
percentage points ahead of Republi
can registration figures.
In other races, Chief justice Rose
Bird withstood a strong conservative
attack to win by a narrow margin a
lull 12-year term on the California
Supreme Court.
With 60.9 percent of the votes
counted, 52 percent, 1,952,952, ap
proved the appointment of Bird
while 47.9 percent, 1,800,568 voted
against retaining her as the state's
most powerful judge.
Bird's victory came less than a
week after her 42nd birthday.
Three associate justices, two ap
pointed by Brown and one named to
the court by former Gov. Ronald
Reagan, were winning voter ap
proval in the early returns.
Wiley Manuel, the first black on

the court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and Frank
Richardson, a conservative and
Reagan s last court appointee,
jumped to early leads.
Republican Mike Curb, a mil
lionaire record producer, defeated
incumbent Mervyn Dymally to be
come the tirst lieutenant governor
since 1894 to belong to a different
party than the governor.
With 57 percent of the votes tal
lied, Curb had received 2,016,832
votes to Dymally's 1,729,221 for a
51-44 percent margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
pledged that he would carry over his
success in business to the lieutenant
governor's job, had said activation
of the state's Economic Develop
ment Commission would be one of
his top priorities.
"Ibis is the greatest honor you
could possibly give me," Curb told a
cheering crowd of supporters in Los
Angeles. "I had the opportunity to
start a business from scratch and to
create jobs, but the opportunity to
serve in government is the most im
portant thing to me."
Dymally, the state's first black
lieutenant governor, had hoped that
the narrow gap between himself and
Curb in late campaign polls would
be bridged by a coattail effect from a
strong victory by Brown.
But late support from Brown, who
defeated Attorney General Evelle
Younger, was not enough to combat
the momentum Curb had built ear
lier in the fall during a bitter, mud

slinging campaign.
George Deukmejian, author of
California's death penalty, defeated
Yvonne Burke, the state's first black
congresswoman, in the attorney
general's race.
Calling it a "victory for law en

senator told cheering supporters he
would work with the governor,
Legislature, judges and law en
forcement to fight crime.
With more than 35 percent of the
vote tallied, the Long Beach senator,
who had run a law-and-order cam
paign, had 1,319,549 to 1,105,710 for
Burke, a Los Angeles Democrat, for
a 52.2-43.7 lead.
The victory for Deukmejian ended
Burke's bid to become the first black
woman ever elected state attorney
general in the nation.
The victory also fulfilled the
dream of Deukmejian's 16-year
legislative career, giving him the

Brown "my good wishes." He said
he was disappointed, but "we've

The race for governor started out
close, with Younger tied with Brown

Republicans tried to take advan

replied simply that he was obeying

Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown won a lopsided re-election
victory yesterday and promised
Californians "a leaner, more austere
government" for the next four
years.
With nearly 40 percent of the
statewide vote counted, Brown held
a 19 percent lead over Younger,
1,594,092 to 1,039,224.
But despite the Democratic gov
ernor's strong victory over Republi
can Evelle Younger, Californians
elected Republican Mike Curb as
lieutenant governor and George
Deukmejian as attorney general.
Curb led incumbent Lt. Gov. Mer
vyn Dymally and Deukemjian led
Democratic nominee Yvonne Burke
all evening, and each ran about 20
percentage points ahead of Republi
can registration figures.
In other races, Chief justice Rose
Bird withstood a strong conservative
attack to win by a narrow margin a
lull 12-year term on the California
Supreme Court.
With 60.9 percent of the votes
counted, 52 percent, 1,952,952, ap
proved the appointment of Bird
while 47.9 percent, 1,800,568 voted
against retaining her as the state's
most powerful judge.
Bird's victory came less than a
week after her 42nd birthday.
Three associate justices, two ap
pointed by Brown and one named to
the court by former Gov. Ronald
Reagan, were winning voter ap
proval in the early returns.
Wiley Manuel, the first black on

the court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and Frank
Richardson, a conservative and
Reagan s last court appointee,
jumped to early leads.
Republican Mike Curb, a mil
lionaire record producer, defeated
incumbent Mervyn Dymally to be
come the tirst lieutenant governor
since 1894 to belong to a different
party than the governor.
With 57 percent of the votes tal
lied, Curb had received 2,016,832
votes to Dymally's 1,729,221 for a
51-44 percent margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
pledged that he would carry over his
success in business to the lieutenant
governor's job, had said activation
of the state's Economic Develop
ment Commission would be one of
his top priorities.
"Ibis is the greatest honor you
could possibly give me," Curb told a
cheering crowd of supporters in Los
Angeles. "I had the opportunity to
start a business from scratch and to
create jobs, but the opportunity to
serve in government is the most im
portant thing to me."
Dymally, the state's first black
lieutenant governor, had hoped that
the narrow gap between himself and
Curb in late campaign polls would
be bridged by a coattail effect from a
strong victory by Brown.
But late support from Brown, who
defeated Attorney General Evelle
Younger, was not enough to combat
the momentum Curb had built ear
lier in the fall during a bitter, mud

slinging campaign.
George Deukmejian, author of
California's death penalty, defeated
Yvonne Burke, the state's first black
congresswoman, in the attorney
general's race.
Calling it a "victory for law en
forcement," the Republican state
senator told cheering supporters he
would work with the governor,
Legislature, judges and law en
forcement to fight crime.
With more than 35 percent of the
vote tallied, the Long Beach senator,
who had run a law-and-order cam
paign, had 1,319,549 to 1,105,710 for
Burke, a Los Angeles Democrat, for
a 52.2-43.7 lead.
The victory for Deukmejian ended
Burke's bid to become the first black
woman ever elected state attorney
general in the nation.
The victory also fulfilled the
dream of Deukmejian's 16-year
legislative career, giving him the
post he had sought unsuccessfully
in the GOP primary in 1970.
In other statewide races, Democ
ratic incumbents won easily over
their Republican challengers. Sec
retary of State March Fong Eu de
feated Jay Margosian, Controller
Ken Cory beat James Ware, and Tre
asurer Jess Unruh defeated Donald
French.
Rep. John McFall (D-Manteca),
who was reprimanded by Congress
in the Korean influence buying
scandal, was defeated by Republican
Norman Shumway, but two other

and Richard Nevins — easily won
re-election over Republican oppo
nents. Democratic incumbent Iris
Sankey slightly trailed challenger Er
nest Dronenburg with 15 percent of
the precincts reporting.
Libertarian Ed Clark ran a distant
third in the race for governor with 5
percent of the vote.
Brown promised a "leaner . . .
more austere . . . more disciplined"
state government in his victory
statement, saying that he would
abide by "that spirit of frugality that I
know the people voted for."
The 40-year-old governor said his
victory "is an opportunity. It's a vic
tory. I like to take it not as a personal
victory, but a victory for all of you."
Asked if he might run for presi
dent in 1980, Brown replied, "I have
locked nothing in and nothing out."
If Brown does have presidential
ambitions in 1980, Curb's victory
complicates his plans considerably,
since the lieutenant governor as
sumes all powers of the chief execu
tive any time the governor leaves the
state.
Commenting on the races for
lieutenant governor and attorney
general, Brown — who had been
criticized by other Democrats for his
late and limited help — commented,
"There was nothing else I could
do."
His political coattails "obviously
are not very long," Brown added.
In a concession speech before a
silent crowd at his campaign head
quarters, Younger said he offered
Brown "my good wishes." He said
he was disappointed, but "we've
had a contest and the people have
made their decision."

The race for governor started out
close, with Younger tied with Brown
or leading in various polls six
months ago. in part due to Brown's
vehement opposition to Proposition
13.
But Younger stumbled repeatedly,
and Brown seized the initiative in
leading legislative efforts to make
Proposition 13 work while Younger,
a reluctant supporter of 13, kept a
low profile.
Republicans tried to take advan
tage of Brown's switch on 13, but the
Democratic governor — declaring
himself "a born-again tax cutter" —
replied simply that he was obeying
the mandate of voters to cut gov
ernment, and he topped 13's $7 bill
ion property tax cut with an addi
tional $1 billion state income tax cut.
By October, polls reported that
Brown's handling of Proposition 13
was one of his strongest points, and
only a minority of voters were at all
concerned with his early opposition
to the tax revolt initiative.
The race for lieutenant governor
was dominated by smears of both
candidates. Curb predicted Dymally
would be indicted for unspecified
criminal acts, and Dymally distri
buted copies of a dozen lawsuits in
volving Curb's recording com
panies.
Although Democrats outnumber
Republicans by 2.3 million voters,
Burke was rated the slight underdog
against Deukmejian, a conservative
Republican state senator who au
thored California's death penalty.
Deukmejian portrayed Burke,
who is a foe of the death penalty, as
