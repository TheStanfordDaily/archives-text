# Brown beats Younger; Dymally loses to Curb
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown won a lopsided re-election
victory yesterday and promised
Californians "a leaner, more austere
government" for the next four
years.
With nearly 40 percent of the
statewide vote counted, Brown held
a 19 percent lead over Younger,
1,594,092 to 1,039,224.
But despite the Democratic gov
ernor's strong victory over Republi
can Evelle Younger, Californians
elected Republican Mike Curb as
lieutenant governor and George
Deukmejian as attorney general.
Curb led incumbent Lt. Gov. Mer
vyn Dymally and Deukemjian led
Democratic nominee Yvonne Burke
all evening, and each ran about 20
percentage points ahead of Republi
can registration figures.
In other races, Chief justice Rose
Bird withstood a strong conservative
attack to win by a narrow margin a
lull 12-year term on the California
Supreme Court.
With 60.9 percent of the votes
counted, 52 percent, 1,952,952, ap
proved the appointment of Bird
while 47.9 percent, 1,800,568 voted
against retaining her as the state's
most powerful judge.
Bird's victory came less than a
week after her 42nd birthday.
Three associate justices, two ap
pointed by Brown and one named to
the court by former Gov. Ronald
Reagan, were winning voter ap
proval in the early returns.
Wiley Manuel, the first black on

the court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and Frank
Richardson, a conservative and
Reagan s last court appointee,
jumped to early leads.
Republican Mike Curb, a mil
lionaire record producer, defeated
incumbent Mervyn Dymally to be
come the tirst lieutenant governor
since 1894 to belong to a different
party than the governor.
With 57 percent of the votes tal
lied, Curb had received 2,016,832
votes to Dymally's 1,729,221 for a
51-44 percent margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
pledged that he would carry over his
success in business to the lieutenant
governor's job, had said activation
of the state's Economic Develop
ment Commission would be one of
his top priorities.
"Ibis is the greatest honor you
could possibly give me," Curb told a
cheering crowd of supporters in Los
Angeles. "I had the opportunity to
start a business from scratch and to
create jobs, but the opportunity to
serve in government is the most im
portant thing to me."
Dymally, the state's first black
lieutenant governor, had hoped that
the narrow gap between himself and
Curb in late campaign polls would
be bridged by a coattail effect from a
strong victory by Brown.
But late support from Brown, who
defeated Attorney General Evelle
Younger, was not enough to combat
the momentum Curb had built ear
lier in the fall during a bitter, mud

slinging campaign.
George Deukmejian, author of
California's death penalty, defeated
Yvonne Burke, the state's first black
congresswoman, in the attorney
general's race.
Calling it a "victory for law en
forcement," the Republican state
senator told cheering supporters he
would work with the governor,
Legislature, judges and law en
forcement to tight crime.
With more than 35 percent of the
vote tallied, the Long Beach senator,
who had run a law-and-order cam
paign, had 1,319,549 to 1,105,710 for
Burke, a Los Angeles Democrat, for
a 52.2-43.7 lead.
The victory for Deukmejian ended
Burke's bid to become the first black
woman ever elected state attorney
general in the nation.
The victory also fulfilled the
dream of Deukmejian's 16-year
legislative career, giving him the
post he had sought unsuccessfully
in the GOP primary in 1970.
In other statewide races, Democ
ratic incumbents won easily over
their Republican challengers. Sec
retary of State March Fong Eu de
feated Jay Margosian, Controller
Ken Cory beat James Ware, and Tre
asurer Jess Unruh defeated Donald
French.
Rep. John McFall (D-Manteca),
who was reprimanded by Congress
in the Korean influence buying
scandal, was defeated by Republican
Norman Shumway, but two other


Students in Wilbur cast their ballots last night as counters
waited patiently to begin tallying votes. Gov. Jerry Brown
was re-eiec ted by a landslide but his lieutenant governor,
