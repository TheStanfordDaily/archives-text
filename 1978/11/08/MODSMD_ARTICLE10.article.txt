## Dual careers families 
### 
The scene is a counselor's
office at Huston House. The
young couple are obviously in
distress; the sound of voices
rises higher and higher until
suddenly both husband and
wife begin to cry. The dialogue
continues as follows:
Tom: Well, what are we sup
posed to do? I've been of
fered this great opportunity
to do a post-doc in Boston
and I may never get another
chance like this again.
Betty: You simply cannot ask
me to leave at this point. I've
just gotten started with the
firm and I have a really good
future ahead of me. I spent
months going through in
terviews to find this; I com
promised for you by staying
in this area and I am not wil
ling to compromise again!
Another office, another
counselor, another couple —
the content differs, the dis
tress is the same.
Bob: Look, we've been mar
ried five years. I am finished
with medical school now
and I will be earning
enough. I really want to start
a family.
Cathy: Bob, we've been over
this so many times. I have
one more year to complete
my dissertation and then I
want an academic position.
The timing is all wrong! In
fact, I don't think that I can
consider having a child until
I have a chance to develop
my career and get tenure.
Bob: But you would be taking
a risk in having our first
child when you are over 35.
Besides I want to be young
enough to enjoy my kids. . .
The above scenes are not
fabricated. Rather, they are
vignettes of counseling ses
sions, bits of conversation
picked up in social gatherings,
and feelings of students ex
pressed in classes, supervi
sion, and advisory sessions.
What makes the situation even
more difficult is that each of
the protagonists in these life
dramas have valid points to
make; each sincerely is pursu
ing a career and each is sin
cerely involved with his/her
spouse.
From the extended family to
the nuclear family with one
partner at home to provide a
point of reference for all fam
ily members, we have seen a
gradual breakdown in the
"traditional" family as women
have rapidly moved into the

workforce. The traditional
American family no longer has
mother in the kitchen worry
ing whether her floor is as
clean as Aunt Emily's (if she
ever did), but more often,
mother is selling real estate,
teaching, being a lawyer,
physician, or vice-president of
a bank. Concomitantly, our
society must deal with such is
sues as daycare, flexible time
schedules, and partners who
will not allow themselves to be
transferred across the country
in order for the spouse to be
promoted. Simple tasks such
as buying groceries, having
clean shirts, driving the kids to
lessons become a major logis
tical problem — especially if
family who can help are five
hundred miles away.
Certainly there are advan
tages — more money for vaca
tions, hobbies and clothes.
But if there are children, much
of that money is going into
childcare or housekeeping as
sistance. Often socializing pat
terns change because it is dif
ficult to orchestrate eleganl
dinner parties for 12 when
there is an emergency at the
hospital, a report due, and lit
tle Johnny begins to vomit and
have diarrhea one hour before
the first guest is due to arrive.
If this description appears
chaotic, it is because life for
these couples and families
often is.
We in Counseling and
Psychological Services, as well
as our colleagues across the
country, are seeing these
couples (and families) increas
ingly in our offices as the abil
ity of these couples to cope
with the complexities of the
decision-making process
break down. Out of our con
cern and realization that so
few models exist for such liv
ing arrangements, the idea for
a conference on "Dual Career
Families" was born. The pur
pose of this conference was to
give information, consider
strategies, and espose the par
ticipants to a range of couples
who are facing or have faced
the issues previously touched
upon. Most importantly, it
seemed necessary to impress
on participants that there is no
one way; each couple must at
tempt different solutions and
find what works for them. This
conference would then ask
the participants to consider
the options that have been
used as the trials that have

been experienced. The pro
duct of our thinking is a con
ference to be held at the Uni
versity on November 11, enti
tled "The Practice of Dual
Careers: How Do You Make It
Work?" A distinguished roster
of faculty participants has
been assembled who span a
range of the life cycle. We feel
that much can be learned.

ing a career and each is sin
cerely involved with his/her
spouse.
From the extended family to
the nuclear family with one
partner at home to provide a
point of reference for all fam
ily members, we have seen a
gradual breakdown in the
"traditional" family as women
have rapidly moved into the

workforce. The traditional
American family no longer has
mother in the kitchen worry
ing whether her floor is as
clean as Aunt Emily's (if she
ever did), but more often,
mother is selling real estate,
teaching, being a lawyer,
physician, or vice-president of
a bank. Concomitantly, our
society must deal with such is
sues as daycare, flexible time
schedules, and partners who
will not allow themselves to be
transferred across the country
in order for the spouse to be
promoted. Simple tasks such
as buying groceries, having
clean shirts, driving the kids to
lessons become a major logis
tical problem — especially if
family who can help are five
hundred miles away.
Certainly there are advan
tages — more money for vaca
tions, hobbies and clothes.
But if there are children, much
of that money is going into
childcare or housekeeping as
sistance. Often socializing pat
terns change because it is dif
ficult to orchestrate eleganl
dinner parties for 12 when
there is an emergency at the
hospital, a report due, and lit
tle Johnny begins to vomit and
have diarrhea one hour before
the first guest is due to arrive.
If this description appears
chaotic, it is because life for
these couples and families
often is.
We in Counseling and
Psychological Services, as well
as our colleagues across the
country, are seeing these
couples (and families) increas
ingly in our offices as the abil
ity of these couples to cope
with the complexities of the
decision-making process
break down. Out of our con
cern and realization that so
few models exist for such liv
ing arrangements, the idea for
a conference on "Dual Career
Families" was born. The pur
pose of this conference was to
give information, consider
strategies, and espose the par
ticipants to a range of couples
who are facing or have faced
the issues previously touched
upon. Most importantly, it
seemed necessary to impress
on participants that there is no
one way; each couple must at
tempt different solutions and
find what works for them. This
conference would then ask
the participants to consider
the options that have been
used as the trials that have

been experienced. The pro
duct of our thinking is a con
ference to be held at the Uni
versity on November 11, enti
tled "The Practice of Dual
Careers: How Do You Make It
Work?" A distinguished roster
of faculty participants has
been assembled who span a
range of the life cycle. We feel
that much can be learned.

seling and Psychological

The scene is a counselor's
office at Huston House. The
young couple are obviously in
distress; the sound of voices
rises higher and higher until
suddenly both husband and
wife begin to cry. The dialogue
continues as follows:
Tom: Well, what are we sup
posed to do? I've been of
fered this great opportunity
to do a post-doc in Boston
and I may never get another
chance like this again.
Betty: You simply cannot ask
me to leave at this point. I've
just gotten started with the
firm and I have a really good
future ahead of me. I spent
months going through in
terviews to find this; I com
promised for you by staying
in this area and I am not wil
ling to compromise again!
Another office, another
counselor, another couple —
the content differs, the dis
tress is the same.
Bob: Look, we've been mar
ried five years. I am finished
with medical school now
and I will be earning
enough. I really want to start
a family.
Cathy: Bob, we've been over
this so many times. I have
one more year to complete
my dissertation and then I
want an academic position.
The timing is all wrong! In
fact, I don't think that I can
consider having a child until
I have a chance to develop
my career and get tenure.
Bob: But you would be taking
a risk in having our first
child when you are over 35.
Besides I want to be young
enough to enjoy my kids. . .
The above scenes are not
fabricated. Rather, they are
vignettes of counseling ses

picked up in social gatherings,
and feelings of students ex

ing arrangements, the idea for
a conference on "Dual Career
Families" was born. The pur
pose of this conference was to
give information, consider
strategies, and espose the par
ticipants to a range of couples
who are facing or have faced
the issues previously touched
upon. Most importantly, it
seemed necessary to impress
on participants that there is no
one way; each couple must at
tempt different solutions and
find what works for them. This
conference would then ask
the participants to consider
the options that have been
used as the trials that have

been experienced. The pro
duct of our thinking is a con
ference to be held at the Uni
versity on November 11, enti
tled "The Practice of Dual
Careers: How Do You Make It
Work?" A distinguished roster
of faculty participants has
been assembled who span a
range of the life cycle. We feel
that much can be learned.
