## Conservation at the University 
### 
Rarely do students at this University all
share the same opinion on a single issue,
but almost every student will agree that
tuition and living costs are too high. Why
are tuition costs rising so quickly and is
there anyway to do anything about it?
just eight years ago in 1970, the Univer
sity's energy bill was under $1 million.
This year students will use almost $7 mill
ion worth of energy, according to Univer
sity estimates. Three years from now in
1981, students will pay an estimated $13
million of their tuition money for energy.
Due to the mutual efforts of the Energy
Conservation Center and a SWOPSI class
— "Energy Conservation as an Energy Re
source" — the University saved $50,000
on last year's energy bill. This is the equi
valent of 1 million pounds of coal.
The most extensive project was the in
stallation of 10 tons of insulation in vari
ous residences and row houses. You may
not know that you live in one of the 16
efficiency-improved houses on campus,
including Branner, Crothers, Lagunita
and Roble.
The $22,500 insulation project was fully
funded by the University and will pay for
itself in about three and a half years. The
expected savings on the insulation for this
year will amount to $6,500. Student labor
was used throughout the project which
began last fall wtth the Phi Psi house and
lasted through the summer. Overall,
130,000 sq. ft. of insulation was installed
under floors and in attic walls and ceil
ings. This amount would normally be
enough to insulate 92 average-sized
houses.
The insulation was made of cellulouse
t fiber — recycled newspaper — and was
r blown into spaces via a machine operated
i by students. Doing it through labor con
i tractors. Ultimately, though, the savings
I and success which would result from the
insulation promects rests with the ability
of students to remember to keep the heat
down in their rooms when their windows
112 are open.
In addition, the SWOPSI class, with the

cooperation of volunteers in many diffe
rent dorms and houses on campus, began
taking weekly readings of their power
meters. The results were tallied, graphed,
and displayed prominently in food lines,
hallways, etc., to inform the house mem
bers of the house energy use record.
Lagunita led all dorms with a 30 percent
reduction in energy use patterns as com
pared to previous years. Florence Moore
followed with a 25 percent savings of elec
trical energy.
The most improved house was An
drogyny (now Haus Mittel-Europa) which
used 54 percent less electricity than the
last year and had the second lowest
energy use per person. The lowest elec
tricity users (per person) last year lived in
the trailers of Manzanita Park. Other
houses, though, were not as consistent.
The Alpha Delts, where almost every
other room has an electric water-bed hea
ter, a freezer, or a loud stereo playing,
used as much electricity as Roble Hall,
which houses almost four times as many
people.
The SWOPSI class also made Phi Psi
into a model-conservation house through
insultating, weatherstripping, and making
fireplace covers.
The most ambitious and gratifying pro
ject was the solar water-heating system at
the Roth House. The six month project
was designed, built, and largely installed
by students. The system consists of 10
Revere Sun-Aid solar collectors which oc
cupy 172 sq. ft. and are mounted on heavy
duty copper and redwood racks. The
$8,000 system was payed for by the Uni
versity and will supply 30 percent of all
hot water for the 32 people in the Roth
House. The system has been operative
since june and will easily last 20 years. The
system will pay for itself by the 14 year.
Besides the energy savings, students did
and will continue to benefit from the
learning, practical experience, and re
search opportunities that the project has
provided. The measured success of the
system will determine how much Univer
sity investment will go to solar in the fu
ture.

One of the largest problems generated
by the 15,000 person University commun
ity is the 680 tons of solid waste per
month it produces. A $26,000 student
fee-assessment helped start the student
operated Recycling Center last lanuary,
designed to reduce our solid waste prob
lem.
In the first eight months, 6,139 lbs. of
aluminum, 55 tons of glass cullet, 120 tons
of paper, and 6,000 intact glass bottles
weighing approximately four and a half
tons were recovered by the Recycling
Center. The 14 member staff includes one
full-time public awareness coordinator
and two project managers.
There are numerous reasons why you
should recycle: it saves natural resources
and hence conserves energy; it saves
precious land fill space and reduces the
volume of solid waste; it reduces Kttei
and pollution, caused by the extraction,
transport and processing of raw materials
and it provides meaningful work experi
ence for students.
It is imperative that students recycle
correctly so that time-consuming labor
requiremetns for sorting are not in
creased. Empty and crush all cans before
placing in the green bins. Only deposit
glass items if they are not broken. Deposit
all office, notebook, and computer paper,
newspaper, leaflets, and brown bags. Do
not recycle cardboard, paeprback or
hardbound books, carbon paper, glossy
paper or magazines, or wax-coated cups
or paper.
Each aluminum can you recycle will
save enough energy to run a television for
three hours. And almost two-thirds of the
world's citizens will not use as much
energy in one day as it takes to produce
two non-recycled cans.
There are many things people; can do to
reduce the need for dangerous and pol
luting energy sources. And as indicated
by the work of students last year, this
summer, and this year people can make a
big difference.
