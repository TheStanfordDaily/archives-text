Rodeo appalling
The article on a "San Fran
cisco tradition," the Grand Na
tional Rodeo (Daily, Nov. 3),
disturbed me greatly. The idea
that 9000 people would wil
lingly pay for and attend an
event that derives its chief en
tertainment through the cruel
abuse of animals is, to say the
least, appalling. Despite the
crowd's apparent lack of con
cern and interest, many com
mon rodeo events (especially
bronco-busting, a great favo
rite) have long been de
monstrated to be no more
than the most base form of
torture for the animals in
volved.
As pointed out in one of the
accompanying captions, the
"broncs" do not kick their legs
and jump around because
they are "naturally wild" (an
all too common misconcep
tion), but because they have
tight cords wrapped around
their flanks that cut deeply
into their flesh, causing them
great pain. They are also often
shocked with electric prods as
they make their entrance into
the rodeo arena. More easily
observable displays of cruelty
are offered by such events as
steer wrestling and calf rop
ing.
How can people extract
such delight from observing
these things? I would like to
believe that the explanation
lies in the everyday person's
basic ignorance of these mat
ters, and that if more people
were made aware of the suffer
ing animals endure for their
pleasure they would cease to
support these practices
through their money and at
tendance. However, the de
scription of the crowd's en
thusiasm for the events, and

hostile reaction to the Fund
for Animals protestors, leads
me to conclude that the prob
lem is not at all ignorance, but
more frighteningly, indiffer
ence.

Thefts cast shadow
"Great party," said assorted
ghouls and goblins at the Man
zanita Park/Mirrielees Hallo
ween party as they left the
l-Center Saturday night.
Some, however, didn't leave
alone. By the end of the party,
Manzanita had lost two kegs,
one tap, two cases of rum and a
punch fountain valued at
around $300.
It was a great party, an excel
lent band, good food and
drink, but the considerable
thefts cast a long shadow on
the evening. It is inexcusable
for people to steal things. I
could understand the rum but
neitherthe punch fountain nor
the kegs was property of the
park.
That's unforgivable.
We spent $1000, Mirrielees
spent $600, on an open all
campus costume party. No one
everthought that we needed to
hire a guard to protect our
equipment. It's possible that
the thieves are not Stanford
students but no one knows.
One thing that we do know is
that the type of individual that
stoops to the level of stealing is
not worthy of benefiting from a
Stanford education.
We want the equipment
back as soon as possible. The
losses are going to come out of
the park student funds and that
means some future event will
be cut or trimmed. That hurts
all the students.
If you know anything about

this or saw anyone walking off
inconspicuously with a full
keg, a case of rum ora spouting
punch fountain — call the
Manzanita Park Office at 497-
5143.
It is this kind of gross
thoughtlessness toward per
sonal property that makes me
pause and wonder about the
students here.
Next year we'll think more
than twice about our losses
and the advisability of an all
campus party. That is the sad
dest commentary of all.

Males aggressive
"Stanford women seek jobs
less aggressively than men."
So declares a headline in Cam
pus Report (Oct. 25).
In its annual report, the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women,
headed by Marion Smith, ad
junct professor of neurology,
states that the reasons for this
fact, at Stanford as elsewhere,
are probably "part of a wo
man's conditioning."
Yet, Eleanor Maccoby, head
of the Stanford Psychology
Department, and Senior Re
search Associate Carol )acklin
have found that biological fac
tors are "clearly implicated" in
male aggressiveness. Accord
ing to their review of more than
1400 studies on sex differ
ences, this difference is appa
rent in man and subhuman
primates, is universally re
ported across cultures, and is
responsive to sex hormones.
In other words, the on-the
whole greater aggressiveness
in males is innate.
Since CEEW's position in this
contradiction is based on
speculation, and that of Dr.

Maccoby and Dr. Jacklin on
long and careful academic
study, one is compelled to give
credence to the latter.
Nevertheless, despite their
contradictions, feminists
would have everyone turned
into the same unisex. Dr. Mac
coby and Dr. Jacklin advocate
minimizing sex differences
through "socialization prac
tices" — i.e., through condi
tioning. CEEW's erroneous
statement itself is part of such a

process.
As is increasingly seen, con
ditioning can indeed make
women more aggressive, just
as it can make a naturally left
handed child right-handed.
Still, we no longer force this
change on naturally left
handed children, for we have
learned that doing so causes
more problems than il pre
vents.

Males aggressive
"Stanford women seek jobs
less aggressively than men."
So declares a headline in Cam
pus Report (Oct. 25).
In its annual report, the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women,
headed by Marion Smith, ad
junct professor of neurology,
states that the reasons for this
fact, at Stanford as elsewhere,
are probably "part of a wo
man's conditioning."
Yet, Eleanor Maccoby, head
of the Stanford Psychology
Department, and Senior Re
search Associate Carol )acklin
have found that biological fac
tors are "clearly implicated" in
male aggressiveness. Accord
ing to their review of more than
1400 studies on sex differ
ences, this difference is appa
rent in man and subhuman
primates, is universally re
ported across cultures, and is
responsive to sex hormones.
In other words, the on-the
whole greater aggressiveness
in males is innate.
Since CEEW's position in this
contradiction is based on
speculation, and that of Dr.

Maccoby and Dr. Jacklin on
long and careful academic
study, one is compelled to give
credence to the latter.
Nevertheless, despite their
contradictions, feminists
would have everyone turned
into the same unisex. Dr. Mac
coby and Dr. Jacklin advocate
minimizing sex differences
through "socialization prac
tices" — i.e., through condi
tioning. CEEW's erroneous
statement itself is part of such a

process.
As is increasingly seen, con
ditioning can indeed make
women more aggressive, just
as it can make a naturally left
handed child right-handed.
Still, we no longer force this
change on naturally left
handed children, for we have
learned that doing so causes
more problems than il pre
vents.

Rodeo appalling
The article on a "San Fran
cisco tradition," the Grand Na
tional Rodeo (Daily, Nov. 3),
disturbed me greatly. The idea
that 9000 people would wil
lingly pay for and attend an
event that derives its chief en
tertainment through the cruel
abuse of animals is, to say the
least, appalling. Despite the
crowd's apparent lack of con
cern and interest, many com
mon rodeo events (especially
bronco-busting, a great favo
rite) have long been de
monstrated to be no more
than the most base form of
torture for the animals in
volved.
As pointed out in one of the
accompanying captions, the
"broncs" do not kick their legs
and jump around because
they are "naturally wild" (an
all too common misconcep
tion), but because they have
tight cords wrapped around
their flanks that cut deeply
into their flesh, causing them
great pain. They are also often
shocked with electric prods as
they make their entrance into
the rodeo arena. More easily
observable displays of cruelty
are offered by such events as
steer wrestling and calf rop
ing.
How can people extract
such delight from observing
these things? I would like to
believe that the explanation
lies in the everyday person's
basic ignorance of these mat
ters, and that if more people
were made aware of the suffer
ing animals endure for their
pleasure they would cease to
support these practices
through their money and at
tendance. However, the de
scription of the crowd's en
thusiasm for the events, and

hostile reaction to the Fund
for Animals protestors, leads
me to conclude that the prob
lem is not at all ignorance, but
more frighteningly, indiffer
ence.

Thefts cast shadow
"Great party," said assorted
ghouls and goblins at the Man
zanita Park/Mirrielees Hallo
ween party as they left the
l-Center Saturday night.
Some, however, didn't leave
alone. By the end of the party,
Manzanita had lost two kegs,
one tap, two cases of rum and a
punch fountain valued at
around $300.
It was a great party, an excel
lent band, good food and
drink, but the considerable
thefts cast a long shadow on
the evening. It is inexcusable
for people to steal things. I
could understand the rum but
neitherthe punch fountain nor
the kegs was property of the
park.
That's unforgivable.
We spent $1000, Mirrielees
spent $600, on an open all
campus costume party. No one
everthought that we needed to
hire a guard to protect our
equipment. It's possible that
the thieves are not Stanford
students but no one knows.
One thing that we do know is
that the type of individual that
stoops to the level of stealing is
not worthy of benefiting from a
Stanford education.
We want the equipment
back as soon as possible. The
losses are going to come out of
the park student funds and that
means some future event will
be cut or trimmed. That hurts
all the students.

the rodeo arena. More easily
observable displays of cruelty
are offered by such events as
steer wrestling and calf rop
ing.
How can people extract
such delight from observing
these things? I would like to
believe that the explanation
lies in the everyday person's
basic ignorance of these mat
ters, and that if more people
were made aware of the suffer
ing animals endure for their
pleasure they would cease to
support these practices
through their money and at
tendance. However, the de
scription of the crowd's en
thusiasm for the events, and

hostile reaction to the Fund

me to conclude that the prob
lem is not at all ignorance, but
more frighteningly, indiffer

Thefts cast shadow
"Great party," said assorted
ghouls and goblins at the Man
zanita Park/Mirrielees Hallo
ween party as they left the
l-Center Saturday night.
Some, however, didn't leave
alone. By the end of the party,
Manzanita had lost two kegs,
one tap, two cases of rum and a
punch fountain valued at
around $300.
It was a great party, an excel
lent band, good food and
drink, but the considerable
thefts cast a long shadow on
the evening. It is inexcusable
for people to steal things. I
could understand the rum but
neitherthe punch fountain nor
the kegs was property of the
park.
That's unforgivable.
We spent $1000, Mirrielees
spent $600, on an open all
campus costume party. No one
everthought that we needed to
hire a guard to protect our
equipment. It's possible that
the thieves are not Stanford
students but no one knows.
One thing that we do know is
that the type of individual that
stoops to the level of stealing is
not worthy of benefiting from a
Stanford education.
We want the equipment
back as soon as possible. The
losses are going to come out of
the park student funds and that
means some future event will
be cut or trimmed. That hurts
all the students.
If you know anything about

this or saw anyone walking off
inconspicuously with a full
keg, a case of rum ora spouting
punch fountain — call the
Manzanita Park Office at 497-
5143.
It is this kind of gross
thoughtlessness toward per
sonal property that makes me
pause and wonder about the
students here.
Next year we'll think more
than twice about our losses
and the advisability of an all
campus party. That is the sad
dest commentary of all.

Males aggressive
"Stanford women seek jobs
less aggressively than men."
So declares a headline in Cam
pus Report (Oct. 25).
In its annual report, the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women,
headed by Marion Smith, ad
junct professor of neurology,
states that the reasons for this
fact, at Stanford as elsewhere,
are probably "part of a wo
man's conditioning."
Yet, Eleanor Maccoby, head
of the Stanford Psychology
Department, and Senior Re
search Associate Carol )acklin
have found that biological fac
tors are "clearly implicated" in
male aggressiveness. Accord
ing to their review of more than
1400 studies on sex differ
ences, this difference is appa
rent in man and subhuman
primates, is universally re
ported across cultures, and is
responsive to sex hormones.
In other words, the on-the
whole greater aggressiveness
in males is innate.
Since CEEW's position in this
contradiction is based on
speculation, and that of Dr.

Maccoby and Dr. Jacklin on
long and careful academic
study, one is compelled to give
credence to the latter.
Nevertheless, despite their
contradictions, feminists
would have everyone turned
into the same unisex. Dr. Mac
coby and Dr. Jacklin advocate
minimizing sex differences
through "socialization prac
tices" — i.e., through condi
tioning. CEEW's erroneous
statement itself is part of such a

process.
As is increasingly seen, con
ditioning can indeed make
women more aggressive, just
as it can make a naturally left
handed child right-handed.
Still, we no longer force this
change on naturally left
handed children, for we have
learned that doing so causes
more problems than il pre
vents.

Rodeo appalling
The article on a "San Fran
cisco tradition," the Grand Na
tional Rodeo (Daily, Nov. 3),
disturbed me greatly. The idea
that 9000 people would wil
lingly pay for and attend an
event that derives its chief en
tertainment through the cruel
abuse of animals is, to say the
least, appalling. Despite the
crowd's apparent lack of con
cern and interest, many com
mon rodeo events (especially
bronco-busting, a great favo
rite) have long been de
monstrated to be no more
than the most base form of
torture for the animals in
volved.
As pointed out in one of the
accompanying captions, the
"broncs" do not kick their legs
and jump around because
they are "naturally wild" (an
all too common misconcep
tion), but because they have
tight cords wrapped around
their flanks that cut deeply
into their flesh, causing them
great pain. They are also often
shocked with electric prods as
they make their entrance into
the rodeo arena. More easily
observable displays of cruelty
are offered by such events as
steer wrestling and calf rop
ing.
How can people extract
such delight from observing
these things? I would like to
believe that the explanation
lies in the everyday person's
basic ignorance of these mat
ters, and that if more people

ing animals endure for their
