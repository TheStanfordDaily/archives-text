# Do faculty here face imperfect tenure system?
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
The balance between teach
ing and research by faculty
members here has been an
important issue for many
years. It comes to the surface
most notably in tenure deci
sions. How should so-called
"pure" scholarship and teach
ing excellence be weighed in
passing such a judgment?
The official University-wide
criterion for granting tenure is
that an individual "must be
excellent in either research or
teaching and at least very good
in the other." Currently,
though, the general consen
sus among faculty and stu
dents is that research plays the
major part in tenure rulings.
Associate Prof. Harry Harding,
currently being considered for
tenure in the Political Science

News Analysis

Department, said he feels it
would be very difficult to get
tenure if one was an excellent
teacher and only a very good
researcher. Biology Prof. Dow
Woodward also noted that no
one he knows was granted te
nure for brilliance in teaching
or denied it for poor instruc
tion. But why stress research
and its product, publications?

According to Prof. Albert
Hastorf, former dean of
humanities and sciences, pub
lications reflect creative ability
and a willingness to work,
which together indicate a cer
tain "quality of mind" the Uni
versity is looking for. In addi
tion, "publications enable
evaluation by peers" far from
the University. Prof. John
Flavell added that "the rest of
the world doesn't know what
Joe Blow can teach," but they
can read his publications. In a
similar vein, Harding said that
"publications are basically a
prediction of the individual's
academic success. Research
potential can be foreseen
more accurately than teaching
potential. Because tenure
constitutes a lifetime ap
pointment, such a prediction
becomes very important, he
said.
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden said
another reason for weighing
research more heavily than
teaching is that research ena
bles a professor to keep his
courses abreast of the latest
developments. "Sometimes
people who aren't keeping up
with their field end up simply
teaching what they learned in
graduate school," he said.

Larry Diamond, chairperson
of the 1976-77 ASSU task force
on tenure said the University
is very research-oriented
partly because it sees research
as its most important mission
and because it depends on re
search grants for a large prop
ortion of its income.
For all these reasons, publi
cations and scholarship are
the main considerations in te
nure decisions.
Many faculty members feel
teachingTias been relegated to
second place after research,
but Woodward believes that
while teaching is "over
shadowed by professional
work," instruction is becom
ing more important. In addi
tion, Royden said there have
been cases where "quality of
teaching was a major factor
both positively and nega
tively" iri the tenure decision.
Whatever the case, measures
are being taken to increase the
input teaching has in the
tenuring process, according to
Diamond. The most evident of
these measures is universal
course evaluation here, to be
introduced this quarter. All
classes with enrollments of
eight or more will now be
evaluated by students. The
raw data gathered will be av

ailable to the public and can
be used for making tenure de
cisions.
Many other factors affect
each tenure decision, faculty
members said, but percep
tions of these factors' signifi
cance vary trom department to
department. Associate Pro
vost for Budget and Planning
L. Wayne Price denied that
"bootlicking is part of the te
nure process. However,
Communications Prof. William
Rivers said "You can politick
— you can go out to lunch
every day with a person who is
influential, and if you do it
well, it is probable that you
will get tenure." Still, a faculty
member whose tenure case is
under consideration said he
had "found no need to kiss
anyone's ass to improve his
chances of receiving tenure.
Few people, though, deny
there are many non-academic
factors in a tenure decision.
Prof. Cordon Craig, chairman
of the History Department,
said University service, ad

ministrative skills, and per
sonal factors are all part of the
process, and Royden admitted
that people voting on candi
dates for tenure "sometimes
are less critical than they
ought to be because he's such
a good fellow to have
around." The converse is also
true, he said. Prof. Gary
Thomas of the School of Law
here said that personality and
politics have "a subconscious
effect on those voting on te
nure decisions. The best way
to guard against such influ
ences is to recognize them,"
he said. Finally, Prof. Henry
Breitrose, chairman of the
Communications Department
said "Most of the faculty
wouldn't care if the individual
was King Kong, so long as the
individual is a good scholar
and teacher."
For King Kong, or anyone
else for that matter, to get te
nure, he would have to pass a
number of hurdles. He would
be asked for the names of
people he feels know his work

well enough to comment on it.
Sometimes as many as 15 to 20
letters are received from indi
viduals appraising a tenure
candidate's work. A faculty
subcommittee of the depart
ment reviews his research and
publications, letters of ap
praisal, and sometimes his
teaching. Then the subcom
mittee makes a recommenda
tion to all the tenured faculty
in the department, who then
vote on whether to recom
mend a candidate.
If the department votes in
favor of granting tenure, the
application goes to the dean of
the school to which the candi
date's department belongs.
Royden has an Appointments
and Promotions Committee to
advise him on tenure deci
sions. Though the commit
tee's advice is not binding on
the dean, Royden said that it is
"seldom" that he does not fol
low the advice. If the dean ap
proves the recommendation,
it passe to the provost, then
to the president of the Univer

sity and his advisory board of
faculty and lastly to the Uni
versity Board of Trustees. If
the application is vetoed at or
above the dean's level, the
applicant has the right of ap
peal to a higher authority. Ap
peals do not succeed very of
ten.
How fair is the tenure sys
tem just described? How
could it be improved? Once
again, there is a wide range of
opinion. One faculty member
whose case is now pending
said he "would consider junk
ing the tenure system" al
together, characterizing it as
"the worst final exam you've
ever had where you don't
even know the questions."
Craig said the University might
do away with the tenure system
and re-evaluate faculty from
every three to five years. "It
might have a very interesting
effect on the Stanford cam
pus," he said, adding that "If
we did away with tenure
lightly we'd be throwing the
baby out with the bath water."

raw data gathered will be av

ailable to the public and can
be used for making tenure de
cisions.
Many other factors affect
each tenure decision, faculty
members said, but percep
tions of these factors' signifi
cance vary trom department to
department. Associate Pro
vost for Budget and Planning
L. Wayne Price denied that
"bootlicking is part of the te
nure process. However,
Communications Prof. William
Rivers said "You can politick
— you can go out to lunch
every day with a person who is
influential, and if you do it
well, it is probable that you
will get tenure." Still, a faculty
member whose tenure case is
under consideration said he
had "found no need to kiss
anyone's ass to improve his
chances of receiving tenure.
Few people, though, deny
there are many non-academic
factors in a tenure decision.
Prof. Cordon Craig, chairman
of the History Department,
said University service, ad

ministrative skills, and per
sonal factors are all part of the
process, and Royden admitted
that people voting on candi
dates for tenure "sometimes
are less critical than they
ought to be because he's such
a good fellow to have
around." The converse is also
true, he said. Prof. Gary
Thomas of the School of Law
here said that personality and
politics have "a subconscious
effect on those voting on te
nure decisions. The best way
to guard against such influ
ences is to recognize them,"
he said. Finally, Prof. Henry
Breitrose, chairman of the
Communications Department
said "Most of the faculty
wouldn't care if the individual
was King Kong, so long as the
individual is a good scholar
and teacher."
For King Kong, or anyone
else for that matter, to get te
nure, he would have to pass a
number of hurdles. He would
be asked for the names of
people he feels know his work

well enough to comment on it.
Sometimes as many as 15 to 20
letters are received from indi
viduals appraising a tenure
candidate's work. A faculty
subcommittee of the depart
ment reviews his research and
publications, letters of ap
praisal, and sometimes his
teaching. Then the subcom
mittee makes a recommenda
tion to all the tenured faculty
in the department, who then
vote on whether to recom
mend a candidate.
If the department votes in
favor of granting tenure, the
application goes to the dean of
the school to which the candi
date's department belongs.
Royden has an Appointments
and Promotions Committee to
advise him on tenure deci
sions. Though the commit
tee's advice is not binding on
the dean, Royden said that it is
"seldom" that he does not fol
low the advice. If the dean ap
proves the recommendation,
it passe to the provost, then
to the president of the Univer

sity and his advisory board of
faculty and lastly to the Uni
versity Board of Trustees. If
the application is vetoed at or
above the dean's level, the
applicant has the right of ap
peal to a higher authority. Ap
peals do not succeed very of
ten.
How fair is the tenure sys
tem just described? How
could it be improved? Once
again, there is a wide range of
opinion. One faculty member
whose case is now pending
said he "would consider junk
ing the tenure system" al
together, characterizing it as
"the worst final exam you've
ever had where you don't
even know the questions."
Craig said the University might
do away with the tenure system
and re-evaluate faculty from
every three to five years. "It
might have a very interesting
effect on the Stanford cam
pus," he said, adding that "If
we did away with tenure
lightly we'd be throwing the
baby out with the bath water."
The balance between teach
ing and research by faculty
members here has been an
important issue for many
years. It comes to the surface
most notably in tenure deci
sions. How should so-called
"pure" scholarship and teach
ing excellence be weighed in
passing such a judgment?
The official University-wide
criterion for granting tenure is
that an individual "must be
excellent in either research or
teaching and at least very good
in the other." Currently,
though, the general consen
sus among faculty and stu
dents is that research plays the
major part in tenure rulings.
Associate Prof. Harry Harding,
currently being considered for
tenure in the Political Science

News Analysis

Department, said he feels it
would be very difficult to get
tenure if one was an excellent
teacher and only a very good
researcher. Biology Prof. Dow
Woodward also noted that no
one he knows was granted te
nure for brilliance in teaching
or denied it for poor instruc
tion. But why stress research
and its product, publications?

According to Prof. Albert
Hastorf, former dean of
humanities and sciences, pub
lications reflect creative ability
and a willingness to work,
which together indicate a cer
tain "quality of mind" the Uni
versity is looking for. In addi
tion, "publications enable
evaluation by peers" far from
the University. Prof. John
Flavell added that "the rest of
the world doesn't know what
Joe Blow can teach," but they
can read his publications. In a
similar vein, Harding said that
"publications are basically a
prediction of the individual's
academic success. Research
potential can be foreseen
more accurately than teaching
potential. Because tenure
constitutes a lifetime ap
pointment, such a prediction
becomes very important, he
said.
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden said
another reason for weighing
research more heavily than
teaching is that research ena
bles a professor to keep his
courses abreast of the latest
developments. "Sometimes
people who aren't keeping up
with their field end up simply
teaching what they learned in
graduate school," he said.

Larry Diamond, chairperson
of the 1976-77 ASSU task force
on tenure said the University
is very research-oriented
partly because it sees research
as its most important mission
and because it depends on re
search grants for a large prop
ortion of its income.
For all these reasons, publi
cations and scholarship are
the main considerations in te
nure decisions.
Many faculty members feel
teachingTias been relegated to
second place after research,
but Woodward believes that
while teaching is "over
shadowed by professional
work," instruction is becom
ing more important. In addi
tion, Royden said there have
been cases where "quality of
teaching was a major factor
both positively and nega
tively" iri the tenure decision.
Whatever the case, measures
are being taken to increase the
input teaching has in the
tenuring process, according to
Diamond. The most evident of
these measures is universal
course evaluation here, to be
introduced this quarter. All
classes with enrollments of
eight or more will now be
evaluated by students. The
raw data gathered will be av

ailable to the public and can
be used for making tenure de

How fair is the tenure sys
tem just described? How
could it be improved? Once
again, there is a wide range of
opinion. One faculty member
whose case is now pending
said he "would consider junk
ing the tenure system" al
together, characterizing it as
"the worst final exam you've
ever had where you don't
even know the questions."
Craig said the University might
do away with the tenure system
and re-evaluate faculty from
every three to five years. "It
might have a very interesting
effect on the Stanford cam
pus," he said, adding that "If
we did away with tenure
lightly we'd be throwing the
baby out with the bath water."
The balance between teach
ing and research by faculty
members here has been an
important issue for many
years. It comes to the surface
most notably in tenure deci
sions. How should so-called
"pure" scholarship and teach
ing excellence be weighed in
passing such a judgment?
The official University-wide
criterion for granting tenure is
that an individual "must be
excellent in either research or
teaching and at least very good
in the other." Currently,
though, the general consen
sus among faculty and stu
dents is that research plays the
major part in tenure rulings.
Associate Prof. Harry Harding,
currently being considered for
tenure in the Political Science

News Analysis

Department, said he feels it
would be very difficult to get
tenure if one was an excellent
teacher and only a very good
researcher. Biology Prof. Dow
Woodward also noted that no
one he knows was granted te
nure for brilliance in teaching
or denied it for poor instruc
tion. But why stress research
and its product, publications?

According to Prof. Albert
Hastorf, former dean of
humanities and sciences, pub
lications reflect creative ability
and a willingness to work,
which together indicate a cer
tain "quality of mind" the Uni
versity is looking for. In addi
tion, "publications enable
evaluation by peers" far from
the University. Prof. John
Flavell added that "the rest of
the world doesn't know what
Joe Blow can teach," but they
can read his publications. In a
similar vein, Harding said that
"publications are basically a
prediction of the individual's
academic success. Research
potential can be foreseen
more accurately than teaching
potential. Because tenure
constitutes a lifetime ap
pointment, such a prediction
becomes very important, he
said.
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden said
another reason for weighing
research more heavily than
teaching is that research ena
bles a professor to keep his
courses abreast of the latest
developments. "Sometimes
people who aren't keeping up
with their field end up simply
teaching what they learned in
graduate school," he said.

Larry Diamond, chairperson
of the 1976-77 ASSU task force
on tenure said the University
is very research-oriented
partly because it sees research
as its most important mission
and because it depends on re
search grants for a large prop
ortion of its income.
For all these reasons, publi
cations and scholarship are
the main considerations in te
nure decisions.
Many faculty members feel
teachingTias been relegated to
second place after research,
but Woodward believes that
while teaching is "over
shadowed by professional
work," instruction is becom
ing more important. In addi
tion, Royden said there have
been cases where "quality of
teaching was a major factor
both positively and nega
tively" iri the tenure decision.
Whatever the case, measures
are being taken to increase the
input teaching has in the
tenuring process, according to
Diamond. The most evident of
these measures is universal
course evaluation here, to be
introduced this quarter. All
classes with enrollments of
eight or more will now be
evaluated by students. The
raw data gathered will be av

ailable to the public and can
be used for making tenure de
cisions.
Many other factors affect
each tenure decision, faculty
members said, but percep
tions of these factors' signifi
cance vary trom department to
department. Associate Pro
vost for Budget and Planning
L. Wayne Price denied that
"bootlicking is part of the te
nure process. However,
Communications Prof. William
Rivers said "You can politick
— you can go out to lunch
every day with a person who is
influential, and if you do it
well, it is probable that you
will get tenure." Still, a faculty
member whose tenure case is
under consideration said he
had "found no need to kiss
anyone's ass to improve his
chances of receiving tenure.
Few people, though, deny
there are many non-academic
factors in a tenure decision.
Prof. Cordon Craig, chairman
of the History Department,
said University service, ad

ministrative skills, and per
sonal factors are all part of the
process, and Royden admitted
that people voting on candi
dates for tenure "sometimes
are less critical than they
ought to be because he's such
a good fellow to have
around." The converse is also
true, he said. Prof. Gary
Thomas of the School of Law
here said that personality and
politics have "a subconscious
effect on those voting on te
nure decisions. The best way
to guard against such influ
ences is to recognize them,"
he said. Finally, Prof. Henry
Breitrose, chairman of the
Communications Department
said "Most of the faculty
wouldn't care if the individual
was King Kong, so long as the
individual is a good scholar
and teacher."
For King Kong, or anyone
else for that matter, to get te
nure, he would have to pass a
number of hurdles. He would
be asked for the names of
people he feels know his work

well enough to comment on it.
Sometimes as many as 15 to 20
letters are received from indi
viduals appraising a tenure
candidate's work. A faculty
subcommittee of the depart
ment reviews his research and
publications, letters of ap
praisal, and sometimes his
teaching. Then the subcom
mittee makes a recommenda
tion to all the tenured faculty
in the department, who then
vote on whether to recom
mend a candidate.
If the department votes in
favor of granting tenure, the
application goes to the dean of
the school to which the candi
date's department belongs.
Royden has an Appointments
and Promotions Committee to
advise him on tenure deci
sions. Though the commit
tee's advice is not binding on
the dean, Royden said that it is
"seldom" that he does not fol
low the advice. If the dean ap
proves the recommendation,
it passe to the provost, then
to the president of the Univer

sity and his advisory board of
faculty and lastly to the Uni
versity Board of Trustees. If
the application is vetoed at or
above the dean's level, the
applicant has the right of ap
peal to a higher authority. Ap
