# Med School dean resigns
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
The resignation of Dr. Clayton
Rich, dean of the Medical School, is
expected to be announced today by
President Richard Lyman.
In a letter sent to Lyman yester
day, Rich requested to be relieved of
administrative duties as of |an. 1,
1979, so the Med School can have
"the opportunity for a new leader
ship."
"The changing external environ
ment and the pressures that these
changes have brought forth have
caused divisions and differences
within the School," Rich stated in
his letter.

"I must regretfully conclude that
these can best be resolved and our
serious problems dealt with if the
School has the opportunity for new
leadership."
Rich told the Daily last night that
the Med School has become a
"complicated business."
"The money situation is getting
tighter, there's more regulation and,
in general, there's been a tightening
up of the situation," he said.
"There's been a lot of tension."
Rich, who has been Medical
School dean for seven years, said he
plans a sabbatical, "probably in
Washington, D.C."
"I haven't decided the details
yet," he said.
Acting dean
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, a profes
sor of surgery and deputy dean of
the Med School, will take over as
acting dean in January until a search
committee finds Rich's successor,
Lyman said.
The search committee hasn't been
named yet, the president added.
Lyman said Rich's service to the
University "leaves us all in debt."
Rich "has never wavered from the
highest standards of intellectual and
personal integrity or from devotion
to the central purposes of a great
University Medical Center," Lyman
said.
Lyman praised Rich for his
achievements, including the de

velopment of structural biology and
neurosciences programs, construc
tion of facilities in the basic and clin
ical sciences and the attraction to
the University of faculty leadership
in the core scientific and clinical
fields.
"These are major achievements,
accomplished at a time of rapid
change and great stress for medical
research and education
everywhere," Lyman said.
Recent woes
More recently, however, the
school has seen severe financial
stress because of a foreseen $2.3
million cutback in Medicare funds
