# Iranian shah’s political challenger termed quiet 'firebrand fanatic'
## 
### 
Paris (AP) — The man who may shape
the future of Iran, a country ravaged by
political violence and crippling strikes,
smiles gently as he speaks of his followers
cutting Iranian policemen to pieces.
There is no visible sign of the firebrand
fanatic in the Ayatullah Khomaini. The old
man sitting cross-legged on the floor of
his suburban home rarely raises his voice.
But that gentle voice, exiled from Iran
since 1963, has aroused revolt among
Shiite Moslems, who constitute more
than 90 per cent of Iran's population.
The embattled government of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi has accused
Khomaini of masterminding a campaign
to impose an anti-Western regime on one
of the West's crucial suppliers of oil.
Khomani rejects the accusation that he is
anti-Western.
"I am neither anti-Western nor anti-
Soviet," he told an interviewer. "I am
pro-Iranian, and I am against allowing
American interests to rob Iran of its
natural wealth."
Khomaini makes no secret of his hatred
for the shah and has said in interviews

that he wants to depose him and form an
Islamic republic." If the present effort
fails, he said, he will call for all-out civil
war.
He said he would reject any alliance
with Iran's communists — even to over
throw the shah — because they are
' against God." But he never has con
cealed his admiration for the late Prime
Minister Mohamed Mossadegh, whose
seizure of Iran s Western-run oil industry
in 1951 threw the West into its first oil
crisis.
Ayatullah means "sign of Ciod." Iran s
Shiite Moslems regard the 78-year-old
Khomaini as one of the imams, or religi
ous leaders, temporarily chosen by Cod
to replace the promised "12th Imam,' the
bringer of ultimate salvation.
(he crisis in Iran was sparked by or
thodox Moslems demanding an end to
the shah's westernizing reforms, which
they s.iy are contrary to the Koran, the
Moslem holy book. They were joined by
the political opposition and hundreds of
thousands of strikers ll is estimated that
more than 1000 persons have died in civil

strife since January.
The grey-bearded Khomaini was expel
led from Iran in l%i after he refused to
stop inciting his followers against the
shah, the Americans and Israel. For 15
years he lived in Iraq. Early this month,
Iraq expelled him too and he came to
France, joining hundreds o! Iranian stu
dents and exiles here.
Khomaini found a temporary home in
Neauphle le Chateau, 20 miles west of
Paris, in a pre-fabricated home heated by
an old-fashioned pot-bellied stove. The
walls are covered with flowered
wallpaper. Cracked plates — presumably
left by the former occupants — are on
display on an old sideboard, the only
piece of furniture in Khomaini's room.
Wearing a jet black turban and a black
cloak, Khomaini is surrounded by his fol
lowers in a corner of the room.
He generally avoids mentioning that
the shah's police killed one of his sons
years ago. But he constantly accuses the
shah of ordering the police to murder the
regime's leading opponents.
