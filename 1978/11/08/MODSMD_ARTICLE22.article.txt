# intramural grid playoffs set
## Zetes, OTWG, Taste of Honey (twice) earn top seedings 
### RICK OSTILLFR 
The IM football playoffs
open this week with 70 teams
competing in the four classifi
cations of A's, B's, coed and
women's. The B's and coed
playoffs start Friday, while the
A's and women begin Mon
day.
The playoff schedules for all
divisions are posted outside
the intramural office (Km. 354,
1 ritina Gym). All teams are ex
pected to find out when they
play; the IM office will not call
them. The tournaments are all
single elimination and times
listed are final;
In the "A" division all nine
teams qualified for the
playoffs. The Zetes ended the
year undefeated to earn the
top seeding. The Theta Delts,
6-0 losers to the Zetes are
seeded second, setting up a
possible rematch in the finals.
The Betas were also unde
feated but played in a weaker
league and are seeded third.
Fourth-seeded Sigma Chi, a
loser to both the Zetes and the
rheta Delts in close games, is
the dark horse in the division.
Off the Wall Gang is the top
seed among the 38 "B" teams

that made the playoffs. Last
year OTWG was unseeded,
but they knocked off everyone
to win the championship. The
team gave up only six points
all year while winning five
games. The second-seeded
Ghetto has been just as impre
ssive, scoring 38 points a game
while yielding just 20 all sea
son.
Organized Grime is seeded
third, followed by Crovath,
Swaine and Moore, Donner
rheas, Donner, Bootables and
Kappa Sigma.
Organized Grime has been
close for several years, includ
ing last year when they lost to
Otf the Wall Gang by one
point in the playoffs. Crovath,
Swaine and Moore is a law
school team and last week the
barristers looked awesome as
they routed previously un
beaten Paloma.
The "B" division has the
greatest potential for a sur
prise of any classification be
cause so many seeded teams
roll up big scores against weak
opponents while other teams
piay and win consistently close
games in much tougher
leagues. It appears any of the

eight seeds as well as the DUs,
and Bootables II have a chance
to win the title. DU and Boot
ables II play in the most attrac
tive first-round game and a top
contender will emerge if the
victor wins by a large margin.
In the coed division, 18
teams are involved in post
season play. Taste of Honey,
which went through three
games undefeated, is the top
seed. The team is comprised
of men from the top-rated Off
the Wall Gang in B's and
players from top-rated Taste of
Honey in women's.
Who Are We is seeded sec
ond, followed by BRA and Lar
kin. Of those three, only BRA
has lost, but they are the de
fending champs and have the
talent to repeat. Recycling
Works, 5-0 on the year, lost
one of its best players to a
broken collarbone and was
not seeded.
Of the unseeded teams,
Durand could surprise every
body, having finished the year
with an undefeated record in a
difficult league.
In women's league play, all
five teams reached the
playoffs, but two teams appear

stronger than the rest. I.«»st
Sunday, in a battle of uiv
beatens, Taste of Honey
knocked off High Energy, l r i '»,
to earn the top seed. High
Energy is seeded second and it
looks like a rematch in the fi
nals will determine the champ
ionship. The only other team
that might have something to
say about the title is Roble, but
it faces High Energy in the first
round and previously lost to
them rather easily in the regu
lar season.

games undefeated, is the top
seed. The team is comprised
of men from the top-rated Off
the Wall Gang in B's and
players from top-rated Taste of
Honey in women's.
Who Are We is seeded sec
ond, followed by BRA and Lar
kin. Of those three, only BRA
has lost, but they are the de
fending champs and have the
talent to repeat. Recycling
Works, 5-0 on the year, lost
one of its best players to a
broken collarbone and was
not seeded.
Of the unseeded teams,
Durand could surprise every
body, having finished the year
with an undefeated record in a
difficult league.
In women's league play, all
five teams reached the
playoffs, but two teams appear

stronger than the rest. I.«»st
Sunday, in a battle of uiv
beatens, Taste of Honey
knocked off High Energy, l r i '»,
to earn the top seed. High
Energy is seeded second and it
looks like a rematch in the fi
nals will determine the champ
ionship. The only other team
that might have something to
say about the title is Roble, but
it faces High Energy in the first
round and previously lost to
them rather easily in the regu
lar season.

Madera and Roble square off in this women's intramural football game yesterday Fhe makeup nam
was one of the last contests played before IM playoffs start Friday.
The IM football playoffs
open this week with 70 teams
competing in the four classifi
cations of A's, B's, coed and
women's. The B's and coed
playoffs start Friday, while the
A's and women begin Mon
day.
The playoff schedules for all
divisions are posted outside
the intramural office (Km. 354,
1 ritina Gym). All teams are ex
pected to find out when they
play; the IM office will not call
them. The tournaments are all
single elimination and times
listed are final;
In the "A" division all nine
teams qualified for the
playoffs. The Zetes ended the
year undefeated to earn the
top seeding. The Theta Delts,
6-0 losers to the Zetes are
seeded second, setting up a
possible rematch in the finals.
The Betas were also unde
feated but played in a weaker
league and are seeded third.
Fourth-seeded Sigma Chi, a
loser to both the Zetes and the
rheta Delts in close games, is
the dark horse in the division.
Off the Wall Gang is the top
seed among the 38 "B" teams

that made the playoffs. Last
year OTWG was unseeded,
but they knocked off everyone
to win the championship. The
team gave up only six points
all year while winning five
games. The second-seeded
Ghetto has been just as impre
ssive, scoring 38 points a game
while yielding just 20 all sea
son.
Organized Grime is seeded
third, followed by Crovath,
Swaine and Moore, Donner
rheas, Donner, Bootables and
Kappa Sigma.
Organized Grime has been
close for several years, includ
ing last year when they lost to
Otf the Wall Gang by one
point in the playoffs. Crovath,
Swaine and Moore is a law
school team and last week the
barristers looked awesome as
they routed previously un
beaten Paloma.
The "B" division has the
greatest potential for a sur
prise of any classification be
cause so many seeded teams
roll up big scores against weak
opponents while other teams
piay and win consistently close
games in much tougher
leagues. It appears any of the

eight seeds as well as the DUs,
and Bootables II have a chance
to win the title. DU and Boot
ables II play in the most attrac
tive first-round game and a top
contender will emerge if the
victor wins by a large margin.
In the coed division, 18
teams are involved in post
season play. Taste of Honey,
which went through three
games undefeated, is the top
seed. The team is comprised
of men from the top-rated Off
the Wall Gang in B's and
players from top-rated Taste of
Honey in women's.
