# Southern Comfort
## In search of the perfect spread 
### Ivan Maisel 
A beautiful Saturday morning
dawned on the Stanford campus, and
the Bettor groggily awoke. He had par
ticipated in a few drunken endeavors
on Friday night, and thus was not over
joyed with arising early.
Yet a force compelled hint to, a force
stronger than any slumber, more pow
erful than any hangover: the Bet. East
ern football games begin at 9:45 a.m.,
Pacific Standard Time, and if he
wanted to get his wagers down, he had
to get up early.
He stumbles over to his desk and
begins to pore over the document of
this trade, the Linesheef The Bettor
has been known to go to great lengths
to secure this document, for without
it, he is like a football player without
his playbook.
Flashes of inspiration converge on
his cerebrum, each one a comely
seductress preying ori his inhibitions.
"Bet on Penn State, they're unde
feated."
"Take Navy and the points. Notre
Dame has lost twice."
"Michigan State scored 55 points last
week. It's easy money."
Fie scours the Linesheet like a field
general, mapping out plans of attack
for all consequences. In case the Bet
tor does poorly on the Eastern games,
he has a whole slew of West Coast
games and night games with which to
counterattack and save the be
leaguered troops of the? East.
The Bettor picks up the phone and
punches out the numbers that will
connect him with the man who saves
his life every Saturday, the junkie with
the magic fix, the Bookie.
The Bettor despises the Hankie the
way a laborer despises bis foreman.
The Bookie is the master of his field,
ruling over his kingdom like a

medieval monarch. One half-point
switch of the point spread, one way or
the other, will benefit some while mak
ing others agonize.
The Bettor plates his bets, slowly
spilling the syllables of each bet on if
he is still unsure of his convictions. He
sets the bets at a quarter each.
In the Bookie's lexicon, a quarter, or
"quail," represents $25, a half, $50,
and a dollar, $100. The Bookie does not
make his money on the Bettor's losses
as such. He has made sure that he will
get Ins <ut by a) setting the point
spread so that the Bettors will wager
evenly on both sides of the bet, and b)
by adding a sur( harge of 10 percent to
losing bets. Thus, if the Bettor wins, he
wins a quarter. But if he loses, he sur
renders $27.50
The Bettor settles down in Ironl of
the radio, listening intently to the an
noun< er is would a battalion com
mander to 'lis master spy.
Notre Dame scores at will on the na
tion's No. I defense, and the Bettor
kicks himself for not obeying his two
cardinal rules of betting:
1) Never bet with Navy.
2) Never bet against Notre Dame.
The action continues throughout the
day, and the Bettor has on two radios
and a TV, catching the volleys of scores
as they whiz past his ears.
The clock edges toward one o'clock,
and the Bettor readies bis reconnais
sance men, the West (.'oast pit ks. Alter
a shaky start, his Eastern troops moved
smartly down the field, and be has won
three of four, losing a Navy destroyer
as his Midshipmen sink in defeat.
The Bettor decides to w.if'er on only
two games in the West, and quite
naturally, one is Stanford. As the old
betting maxim goes, "Betting against
your own school is like screwing your

sister: you may get laid, but you feel
terrible the morning after."
The Bettor receives Stanford plus ?Vj
points, and is ecstatic as the Cardinals
score on their firsi drive. But the Start
ford offensive attack bogs down, and
soon after so do his spirits.
It is now (he third quarter. The Tro
jans are battering away at the Stanford
defense, and once again, the Bettor is
ashamed that he violated one of the
Ten Commandments of Betting: "Al
ways bet with your head, not with your
heart."
At the risk of using a cliche, a game
is never over until the final gun
sounds. The Cardinal defense bent,
but did not break. It is 11-7, and, with
four minutes left, the Bettor's money
seems safe. Now that the spread is
beaten, he c heers for Stanford to win
outright
Alas, it does not happen, and his vic -
tory rings hollow. The Bettor takes
comfort in realizing that, though Stan
ford is 5-4 in the win-loss column, they
â– ire 6-2-1 against the spread.
Another day's battles behind him,
the Bettor reflects upon the season.
Like a birthday boy at the end of his
party, the Bettor sadly realizes it's al
most over. There are only three weeks
ol college football left.
I hat catalyst spring? him into action,
and he begins preparing for the pro
games that remain on the week's
calendar. He works lor an hour, and
calls it i day, remembering he must get
up early Sunday morning.
As the Bettor flickers into semicon
sciousness, he mumbles in prayer the
oner rule that, above all others, lie must
follow to he successful.
'Always fret on the underdog at
home on Monday'nights."
