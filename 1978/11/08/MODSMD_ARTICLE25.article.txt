Anti-shah protests continue
Tehran — The former director of Iran's national
airline died of gunshot wounds in a Tehran hospi
tal yesterday, and there were conflicting reports
whether he committed suicide or was assassi
nated. Scattered opposition to Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi's military government continued to
rock the country.
Ceno Ali-Muhammed Khademi was dismissed
as managing director of the national airline in a
conciliatory gesture to the country's majority
Shiite Moslems. He is a member of the minority
Bahai sect. Many of his co-religionists also were
dismissed from their positions in August when
the government of Jaafar Sharif-Emami took over.
Orthodox Moslems are demanding an end to
the shah's Westernization reforms which they say
contradict the teachings of the Koran, the Mos
lem holy book. The religious protesters have
been joined by the political opposition, seeking
democratic reforms, freedom for political prison
ers and an end to martial law, and hundrds of
thousands of strikers who want more pay and
better working conditions.
Scattered violence erupted in downtown
Tehran yesterday, but there were no serious
clashes as demonstrators fled before troops ar
rived. Small groups of anti-government de
monstrators tried to approach Tehran University
as troops closed off streets leading to the cam
pus, but they dispersed as troops fired into the
air. Witnesses said several youths were beaten by
club-wielding police.
Staten Island ferry crashes
New York — A Staten Island ferry carrying 2000
passengers across fog-bound New York Harbor
crashed into a concrete seawall at the tip of lower
Manhattan yesterday, tossing the passengers
about and peeling the steel deck back like a sar
dine can.
Officials said 173 persons were treated at five
hospitals and dozens more were given first aid at
the scene.
The conditions of two people were listed as
serious — one with a possible fractured spine and
the other with a possible heart attack.
Other injuries ranged from broken bones to
cuts and bruises suffered when the ferry Ameri-

can Legion struck the seawall at an estimated
speed of 3 to 4 knots — roughly the equivalent of
3 or 4 mph.
Piloted by a 30-year veteran captain, the radar
equipped ferry emerged from a fog bank about
7:30 a.m., some 700 feet west of its slip and with
the seawall looming straight ahead.
Soviets celebrate anniversary
Moscow — The Soviet Union marked the 61st
anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution yester
day with a huge Red Square military parade and a
remark by President Leonid Brezhnev that the
past year had some "rainy days."
At a Kremlin reception after the parade,
Brezhnev posed his own rhetorical question,
"What was this year like?"
He continued with the unusually colorful ob
servation that"Yet another year has passed ... as
always, it was filled with different events, and
clear days gave way to rainy ones, and not only as
regards the weather."
It was not clear what Brezhnev referred to, but
the Soviets have had their share of problems dur
ing 1978, among them China's foreign policy in
itiatives in Eastern Europe, Japan and Cambodia,
the Camp David summit that took Mideast policy
out of Moscow's hands, world-wide publicity
over Soviet dissident trials and an African policy
that has not shown as much success as the Krem
lin might have liked.
Patty Hearst's appeal refused
San Francisco — A federal judge yesterday re
fused to set aside Patricia Hearst's bank robbery
conviction or modify her seven year sentence.
She had alleged her trial was "reduced to a
mockery, a farce and a sham because of ineffec
tive assistance of counsel."
In denying all Hearst's motions, U.S. District
Court judge William Orrick Jr. declared that
"none of the evidence offered in her behalf, even
if clearly established at an evidentiary hearing,
would entitle her to relief."
As to her allegations of inadequate representa
tion by famed trial lawyer F. Lee Bailey, Judge
Orrick said:
"The exhaustive efforts expended on her be
half in the course of proceedings serve to expose

petitioner's specific complaints as speculative,
unfounded assertions completely unwarranted
by the record."
Hearst, who will be eligible for parole July 11
after serving 28 months of a seven-year sentence,
was charged with the April 15, 1974, robbery of a
San Francisco bank with Symbionese Liberation
Army members who had kidnapped her on Feb. 4
from her Berkeley apartment.
MVP award goes to Rice
New York — Slugger Jim Rice of the Boston Red
Sox, the first American Leaguer in 41 years to
accumulate more than 400 total bases in a single
season, was named the AL's Most Valuable Player
for 1978 by the Baseball Writers Association of
America yesterday.
Rice beat Cy Young Award winner Ron Cuidry
of the New York Yankees comfortably. The Bos
ton slugger received 20 first-place votes from the
28-man BBWAA committee and a total of 352
points, while Guidry, a unanimous choice for the
AL Cy Young Award last week, had 291 points in
the MVP election and the other eight first-place
votes.
Rice won the MVP designation following an
awesome season at the plate. He led the majors
with 46 home runs and 139 runs batted in, and
had 406 total bases — the first AL hitter to reach
that plateau since Joe DiMaggio had 418 total
bases in 1937.
Stock market plummets further
New York — The stock market took a steep dive
yesterday as worries over the rising cost of
money, the sinking dollar and a slowing economy
drove prices broadly lower.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
by 8.23 points Monday and off by more than 18 at
midafternoon yesterday, recovered a bit to close
down 14.81 at 800.07. The average has closed
below the 800 level only once since last April 14,
on Oct. 31 when it hit 792.45.
Today's weather
Fair through today, with increasing clouds and
winds. Patchy coastal fog or low clouds extending
inland locally early morning hours. Lows in mid
40s to low 50s.
