# Golf course regains tax-free status in IRS court ruling
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
The University's golf course regained its tax
exempt status Monday when the state court of ap
peals ruled its primary use was educational.
Under California law, any land used exclusively for
educational purposes is immune from property
taxes, according to Adrian Arima, associate staff
counsel here.
Originally, the golf course fell into this category,
but several years ago Santa Clara County's .tssessor
ruled that because people not directly associated
with the University, such as alumni and guests of
professors, use the course that the land was taxable.
Stanford sued to have the ruling changed.
The University stands to recover more than
$130,000 in back taxes paid under protest over the
past three years, plus interest accrued on that sum.
The University had won its original case, but the
county appealed that ruling, said Arima. He added
that Santa Clara could petition for a rehearing or an
appeal to the state supreme court anytime within the

next 30 days.
However Arima said that this is "not the kind of
issue that the California Supreme Court usually
spends its time with."
The appeals court ruled that the golf course was
"an integral part of Stanford's physical education
and recreational programs."
The court added that since alumni have a special
relationship with the University their incidental use
of the course should not disqualify it as an otherwise
valid tax exemption.
According to a University press release, about 90
percent of the course members are alumni. Faculty,
students and staff are also allowed to use the
course.
The court's ruling is consistent with the findings of
the Internal Revenue Service that income from the
golf course is also tax exempt.
The University's tax payments on the course were
$46,043.20 in 1975-76, $44,009.76 in 1976-77, and
$40,647.60 in 1977-78, according to the University
press release.
