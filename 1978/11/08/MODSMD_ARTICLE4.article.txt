Los Angeles (AP) — In a major vic
tory for homosexual rights, a prop
osal to let schools fire homosexual
teachers and their defenders was
defeated by California voters yes
terday.
Voters also rejected a measure to
restrict smoking in public buildings
and overwhelmingly approved an
expansion of the state's 1977 death
penalty law.
"I'm glad I lived to see this day,"
said a middle-aged homosexual man
amid the bedlam of a party at a

dovtfntown hotel as the results came
in showing Proposition 6 trailing.
''Ihis is only round one — amen,"
Saff state Sen. John Briggs, the Hjl
lerton Republican who sponsored
the measure.
Vote count
With nearly half the precincts re
porting, Proposition 6 trailed by 42
to 58 percent, or 1,430,000 votes to
1,995,906.
Proposition 5, which would give
most businesses and public build
ings a choice of setting up separate
no-smoking areas or banning smok
ing, trailed by 54.2 to 45.7 percent,
or 1,582,325 votes to 1,874,677.
Proposition 7, which would ex
pand the death penalty to poten
tially hundreds of murder cases a
year, including some accomplices
who were not at the death scene,
was passing by more than. 7-3, or
2,230,749 votes to 909,955.
Teachers
Proposition 6 would let schools
fire teachers and other employees
who openly practice or defend a

homosexual lifestyle.
Opponents hailed the results as a
reversal of the anti-homosexual tide
l hat has repealed local gay-rights
laws in four other states.
"I hope people around the coun
try will be more willing to accept
people's differences, to live as
brothers and sisters," Los Angeles
City Attorney Burt Pines, one of the
first prosecutors to hire publicly
homosexual deputies, told the jubil
ant throng of about 2500.
Pines told the crowd, "My faith is
restored in the California voters. It
really says a lot about this state. The
only way we can exist in this world is
to accept people's differences and
be tolerant."
Briggs' vow
But while thousands of Proposi
tion 6's opponents throughout the
state celebrated the measure's de
feat with kisses, cheers and tears of
joy, the anti-homosexual initiative's
author vowed to return with a simi
lar measure on the 1980 ballot.
Briggs told a group of *50 suppor

ters of his proposition, "Mark my
words, the battle is not over. This is
only round one. We intend to put
together a network of concerned
people throughout the country to
continue this fight."
Briggs promised to carry on his
efforts to ban homosexual teachers
from California classrooms, saying,
"We may put as many as three initia
tives on the ballot in 1980 if we need
it."
