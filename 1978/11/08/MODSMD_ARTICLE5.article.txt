## 
### SUSAN ESSOYAN 
U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young,
unanimous choice of the Com
mencement Speaker Panel, will
speak at graduation this June, Uni
versity President Richard Lyman an
nounced yesterday.
Young was the "overwhelming
favorite" of the Senior Class, accord
ing to a poll conducted last year,
said Leslie Crozier, one of four
senior class presidents.
"We're all really excited that we
were able to get who the class
wanted," she added. "It's really an
honor for us."
"Even those who don't agree with
his tact or politics have to admit that
he'll be a dynamic speaker," Senior
Class President Tony Peet said.
Young was chosen from a group

of nominees, which included Gov.
Jerry Brown and Alexander Sol
zhenitsyn, because "not only would
he have interesting things to say, but
also because he is involved in issues
of concern to the class, such as
South Africa," Peet explained.
Mutual feelings
The enthusiasm seems to be
mutual. Young's acceptance, ac
cording to his staff, was "one of the
fastest 'yesses' he's ever given."
Young has created controversy
since he was appointed U.N. ambas
sador by President jimmy Carter in
lanuary 1977.
"All I can say is that I'm attacked
from the left as vociferously as I am
from the right, and if I can stay in the
middle, maybe we can make it,"
Young said recently in San Fran-

CISCO.
With his U.N. appointment, he
gave up the congressional seat he
had held since 1972. He was the first
black congressman elected in Geor
gia in 101 years.
A graduate of Howard University
and the Hartford Theological Semi
nary, Young was ordained in the Un
ited Church of Christ.
A leader of the civil rights move
ment, he was a close associate of Dr.
Martin Luther King, |r.
Currently, he is active in U.S. rela
tions with Africa, promoting in
creased involvement and defending
present policy as "the best of what
the U.S. has to offer."
Commencement exercises will be
June 17 at Frost Amphitheater.
