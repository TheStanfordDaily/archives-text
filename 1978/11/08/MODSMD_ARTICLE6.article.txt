# H defeated, McCloskey victorious
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
The Palo Alto rent control initia
tive went down lo a resounding de
feat yesterday. By a margin of almost
two to one, voters rejected a mea
sure which would have forced land
lords to pass Proposition 13 savings
along to tenants.
In the 12th Congressional District
race, incumbent Pete McCloskey led
his closest opponent, Democrat
Kirsten Olsen, by more than three to
one. With over 63 percent of the
vote tallied, McCloskey's re-election
seemed assured despite furor over
his remarks on the "dangers of an
all-minority army."
Olsen said last night she did not
exploit McCloskey's comments on
the draft "as much as I should have"
because she did not have enough
money left at the end to do so. She
thoOght the results would be very
different, she said.
In the 20th Assembly District race
between two University graduates,
Republican Robert Naylor soundly
defeated Democrat Chris Cobey,
despite claims made during the
campaign that Naylor was a conser
vative threat.
These charges were based on a
controversial editorial endorsing
Barry Goldwater for president which
Naylor wrote as a Daily editor 14
years ago.
At 2 a.m. today, Republican Marz
Garcia trailed incumbent Democrat
Arlen Gregorio in the 10th State Se
nate District, which includes the
University, by a margin of only 1400
votes out of 38,000 tabulated, with
over 53 percent of the votes
counted. The result was see-sawing
back and forth through the early
hours of the morning.
It was also too early to call the race
for Assemblyman in the 23rd District
which also includes the University.
The challenger, University graduate
Greg Morris, was behind Democrat
Victor Calvo by only 400 votes, 1.3
percent of the 33,000 votes counted.
With 571 out of the 995 precincts

in Santa Clara County reporting, the
voter turnout was almost 70 percent,
much higher than the last off-year
election in 1974 when only 36 per
cent of registered voters went to the
polls in the aftermath of the Water
gate scandal.
In the race for county sheriff,
Robert Winter, until now a lieuten
ant in the sheriff's office, was
elected sheriff by a three to two
majority in a decisive victory over
incumbent lames Geary. The Santa
Clara County Sheriff is responsible
for the operation and supervision of
the University's Department of Pub
lic Safety.
Santa Clara County voters also
approved by a vote of nearly three to
one a measure to provide funds for
the maintenance of existing county
parks as well as investment in land
for new parks.
Alfred Carlson, Assistant County

Assessor, was elected to the Asses
sor's office in a narrow win over
Ernie Konnyu. By midnight last
night, Konnyu was philosophical
about his defeat. "I don't think
there's any chance I'll pull ahead,"
he said, even though he was behind
by only three and a half points.
The voting trends in the County
were more liberal than in California
at large. While Proposition C> was de
feated by a 16-point margin across

the state, the spread in the County
was 21 percentage points.
Gov. Jerry Brown led his oppo
nent Republican candidate Evelle
Younger by only 19 points statewide
but 30 points within this county.
Similarly, in the race for Attorney
General, though Democrat Yvonne
Burke lost by a large majority, she
was ahead of challenger George
Deukmejlan, 48.6 to 46.7 percent
among Santa Clara County voters.

thoOght the results would be very
different, she said.
