The Palo Alto rent control initia
tive went down lo a resounding de
feat yesterday. By a margin of almost
two to one, voters rejected a mea
sure which would have forced land
lords to pass Proposition 13 savings
along to tenants.
In the 12th Congressional District
race, incumbent Pete McCloskey led
his closest opponent, Democrat
Kirsten Olsen, by more than three to
one. With over 63 percent of the
vote tallied, McCloskey's re-election
seemed assured despite furor over
his remarks on the "dangers of an
all-minority army."
Olsen said last night she did not
exploit McCloskey's comments on
the draft "as much as I should have"
because she did not have enough
money left at the end to do so. She
thoOght the results would be very
different, she said.
In the 20th Assembly District race
between two University graduates,
Republican Robert Naylor soundly
defeated Democrat Chris Cobey,
despite claims made during the
campaign that Naylor was a conser
vative threat.
