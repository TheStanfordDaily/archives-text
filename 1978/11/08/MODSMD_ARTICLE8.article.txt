But the spirit lives. Enduring
various highs and lows, Ram's
Head presented a completely
original student-written
Gaieties show every year for 60
years. In 1937, the group, with
Chaparral, raised half the
money to build Memorial Au
ditorium. Ram's Head officers
were once elected by the stu
dent body. The group used to
perform in numerous Califor
nia cities, and they cut an
album several decades ago.
Then, in the late '60s, stu
dent interests took a global
turn, and Ram's Head found it
self dying from a general lack
of money and interest, Keith
I ight, last year's Gaieties pro
ducer, said. "It was unpopular
to have frolicky, fun things."
In 1971 the organization dis
banded. In the following
years, the latent thespians on
the Farm turned to the Drama
Department and to The Com
pany, another student-run
group, for acting experience.

"Dorm shows started up ir
the vacuum too and caught or
But still there were no big
shows," Gleicher said Tin
Drama Department does n<
productions of the scale "i
Ram's Head's musicals. In fact,
the department produces lie
musicals.
In the fall of 1975, a group o
students recreated Ram
Head. Initial financing for t ht
group came from a loan frorr
the Office of Student Affairs
and from the Homer Spence
fund. Spence was a Rani '
Head alumni who died several
years ago. A fund was estab
lished in his name to finan
cially support theatre experi
ences for students here.
The revived group's firsi
show was.Guys and Dollv per
formed in the spring of 1976
The group made enough
money on the show to pa>
back the loan and still have
money to spare. Fiddler on the
Roof debuted here in 1977, anc
last year the group produced
The Music Man for its sprii
show. This year, the group wil
produce Kiss Me Kate with ru
outside financial assistance,
according to Gleicher.
Presently, Ram's Head has <
faculty sponsor, Doug Rus
sell, professor of drama. Bui
Gleicher, the first Ram's Head
president is the "chief finan
cial officer of the organization
and the general liaison with
University personnel," he

said. ' 1 -iin also the grand
party maker, Gleicher added.
Ram's Head ictiyitles tall into
three categories.
Gaieties
Last year's Gaieties was the
first since (lie group began
anew in >• "Ilie only
scheduled performance sold
out so quickly that a last mi
nute hriday afternoon show
had to be added," Gleicher
said, explaining the unex
pected success of last year's
Gaieties. This year's show, the
contents of which are "a tight
secret" will follow the original
tradition established by Ram's
Head's Gaieties in the early
20th century. Produced by
senior Mark Kohalmy, the
production will be "more of a
show, more of a story" than
last year s Gaieties, with
"completely original music,
lyrics Hid of course, the usual
subliminal s< Kohalmy said.
Of the c ast ofperformers,
approximately a dozen are last
year s (jaietics alums. The re
mainder are new to Ram's
Gleicher, in nany cases new
to dramatic productions in
general.
"Watching the past perfor
mances got me excited. Then I
met friends who were in
volved, and I said to myself,
Next year you're going to do
it,' " junior newcomer Cliff
Colvin, said.
Kohalmy says that perfor

mers complain "pretty bad"
during the weeks of rehearsal
just before a show opens.
" I'm two weeks behind in
classes; my girlfriend just left
me; I'll never do it again' some
say. But the next time there's a
rehearsal, they're there,"
Kohalmy said.
Kiss Me Kate
Work is also underway for
the spring musical, Kiss Me
Kate. Though the musical
won't open until late April, a
group of 20 meets every week
to discuss development of the
show, to plan the budget and

to discuss tryout procedures,
Electrical engineering majors,
economics majors and many
others outside the "drama
clique" are working to arrange
production of Kiss Me Kate,
Cleicher said.
He expects that over 200
people will work on Kiss Me
Kate.
Non-profit
Because Ram's Head is
student-run, pay for work is
not allowed. The directors and
producers often receive
academic credit for their work
through the Drama Depart
ment. The Plant Services office
currently extracts $2000 per
production from Ram's Head
for required supervision. The
group also pays royalty
charges and rental fees for the
scripts and musical scores
used for the musicals each
spring. "It's a wonder that we
even break even," Cleicher
said. The Drama Department
lends help by allowing Ram's
Head to use University theatre
facilities, lighting apparatus
and set construction facilities.
But all costumes, make up,
and props are designed and
purchased by Ram's Head.
An additional area of Ram's
Head production is new this
year. Headed by Light, a reper
tory company is presently
being organized. "For the past
few years Ram's Head has seen
the need for a group of its
members to go out into the
community and perform for

special functions such as
alumni dinners, Stanford
orientations, etc. The com
pany is still in its planning
stage, and details are a bit
fuzzy," Cleicher said. The goal
of the repertory company is
"to eventually have in stock a
few dozen pre-rehearsed
numbers. The size of the
company will vary as time goes
on, but it will start with from
10 to 15 members," Cleicher
added.
These will also be non-profit
ventures, Light said. He plans
to construct the group with a
"flexible organization as an
outlet for people who like to
perform, people whose needs
aren't satisfied by Caieties or
the spring musical," he said.
In fact, Ram's Head is al
ready scheduling the 19M0
musical. Immediately after the
spring musical is performed,
the staff for the subsequent
year's show is selected. The
most frequently travelled
route to serving on the Ram's
Head staff is to "start out at
auditions, get in the cast, then
next time be on the staff,"
Kohalnjy explained.
Ram's Head producers also
need "behind-the-scenes"
people to construct sets, sew
costumes and hang publicity
posters. Cleicher said all stu
dents are invited to become
involved in all aspects of Ram's
Head production. Lack of
theatrical experience "should
not keep people out," he said.

Students In this year's Gaieties production are dealing with a different deck of cards than the Gaieties
shows of the '50s. But the theme, a parody on University life, continues.
