## David Miller Carter plan will fail 
### 
Parren J. Mitchell, leader of the Congres
sional Black Caucus, said in August, "The
principal fuel on which inflation feeds is
money. . . . Once we recognize that rapid
money growth can unleash inflation but can
not solve our unemployment problem, we
can break through the psychological barrier
which has prevented us from developing a
full employment noninflationary . . . strategy
that works."
Mitchell is right. The heart of the inflation
problem lies not in greedy labor unions or
corporations or consumers or even in the
federal deficit. The key cause of inflation is
the expansion of the money supply by the
Federal Reserve System.
This is not to suggest that naive quantity
theory view that the rate of increase of prices
exactly equals the rate of monetary growth:
the connection is much looser. Nonetheless,
to sustain the rapid and continuing rate of
price inflation which we have experienced
over the last decade a continual growth of
the money supply is both necessary and suf
ficient.
An attempt by cartelized industry or
monopoly labor unions to raise prices or
wages would, without an increase in the
money supply, result primarily in a decline in
sales or employment. Put crudely, at higher
prices a certain amount of money is not able
to support the same real level of economic
activity.
Only if the Fed accommodates the higher
prices by expanding the money supply can
the process of raising prices be continued
into an inflationary spiral.
Similarly, while a large federal deficit and
the consequent government borrowing may
cause a tightening in the capital markets (di
verting funds that otherwise would have fi
nanced productive investment), a deficit will
not of itself cause significant price inflation.
Only if the Federal Reserve chooses to ex
pand the money supply to ease the tighten
ing in the capital markets will substantial
price inflation result.
President Jimmy Carter's recently an
nounced inflation program has three major
components: voluntary wage and price con
trols, a decrease in the federal deficit and
some restraint in federal spending and an
attack on government-created rigidities and
restraints. Notably absent is any emphasis on
an expanding money supply as the root cause
of inflation.
The voluntary guidelines (like mandatory
controls) will not work; few people seriously

believe that they will. It is in fact fortunate
that the guidelines will fail: the motive power
of the market economy is based on the
nonuniform behavior of prices.
Voluntary guidelines do have two advan
tages over mandatory controls. First, they are
a less serious imposition on liberty. Second,
they will most likely collapse even faster than
would mandatory controls.
The goal of restraining federal spending
and the deficit is commendable. One should
also applaud Carter's intention of unraveling
the government-created web of privilege
(subsidies, tariffs and quotas, etc.) which
protects many industries from the rigors of
the market.
Carte'r's choice as head of the inflation
program is Alfred Kahn, the Cornell
economist who, as head of the Civil Aeronau
tics Board, presided over the substantial de
regulation and decartelization of the airline
industry.
The choice of Kahn encourages one to
hope that the Administration will concentrate
not on the guidelines but on fiscal restraint
and on deregulation: indeed, Kahn has said
of his new position, "I become not Mr. Wage
and Price Regulator, but Mr. Efficiency in
Government, Mr. Deregulator or Mr.
Minimizer of Coercion."
If Carter and Kahn can bring about a de
crease in federal taxation and spending, a
relaxation of restrictions on entry into vari
ous occupations or industries, a repeal of the
special privileges granted labor unions, or an
end to government subsidies, tariffs, and
quotas and to government-created cartels,
they will substantially increase the level of
employment, productivity, and material
well-being in this country.
But as desirable as such actions are, they
will not solve the problem of inflation. As
Congressman Mitchell emphasized, inflation
can be dealt with only if we recognize its
monetary source.
As a cure for inflation, the President's
program is destined to fail. Until the the
Washington establishment is willing to break
through Congressman Mitchell's
"psychological barrier" and face the reality
that price inflation is caused by the govern
ment's creating new money, we will not, in
Mitchell's words, develop "a full employ
ment, noninflationary . . . strategy that
works."
