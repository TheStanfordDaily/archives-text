## Editorial Give 'em the Axe 
### 
Enough is enough. This year's
troop of Yell Leaders has failed mis
erably as a source of crowd support
at football games, as a humorous
timewaster during time-outs and
lulls in the game and as a represen
tative of this University.
Last year's Yell Leaders were an
experiment. Remembrances of days
of old, with cheerleaders, marching
bands, the Indian mascot and bon
fires kindled a flame in the hearts of
some who convinced- the Athletic
Department to help fund the group.
But while last year's group left little
lasting impressions in the minds of
fans, good or bad, this year's group
actually detracts from the game and
the atmosphere in the stands.
Lounging on the track in togas
and attempting to spur the defense
on with yells like "Interception.
Contraception. Stop That Ball,"

hardly contribute to one's enjoy
ment of the game. And adding to
the useless ruckus is the fact that
this group has been given a mic
rophone to broadcast such garbage
to unreceptive fans who have no
choice but to endure.
It is high time the Athletic De
partment stopped this continual
tormenting of the fans on the sunny
side of the stadium by canning the
Yell Leaders and taking the mic
rophone off the track where the
Band's punk rockers have access to
it. "Are We Not Men? We Are Devo"
isn't much better than what the Yell
Leaders have been coming up with.
The fact of the matter is that the
fans know when to cheer for their
football team. No senseless prod
ding by a small group of Yell Leaders
down on the field is going to make
the fans care more about the game.
