Why aren't facts
published
With regards to a recent ar
ticle concerning the abduction
of a female student, I would
iike to bring to your attention
a rather blatant incongruity.
In last Monday's Daily (Nov. 6i
was evidence of a sad, but
common-place crime — the
crime of keeping the student
body ignorant of facts.
The article about a lone
female jogger who was at
tacked by three male assail
ants, reflected the false sense
of security which exists on the
Stanford University campus.
To begin with, running alone
near relatively deserted areas
at night exhibits a lack of
common sense, but I don't in
tend to elaborate upon how
this incident could have been
avoided had the woman used
better judgment.
I might add, that this prob
lem of harassment is not un
ique to the women on cam
pus. I know personally of
many men on campus who
have the common sense not to
jog, ride or walk through
darker, more deserted areas
alone. More and more, they
too are realizing that personal
assault is something that
doesn't just "happen to the
other guy."
Unfortunately, this aware
ness is not being encouraged
by school authorities or
media. Since I have been a
student here, rape and assault
have been "taboo" subjects. It
seems as if everyone knows
these crimes are committed,
but how? Word of mouth?
Certainly not through the
printed word, as is evidenced
in the aforementioned article.
On page one, police captain
Raoul Niemeyer is reported as
saying "this is the first re
ported sexual assault on cam
pus this fall." But if the article
is followed up on the last
page, assistant dean of student
affairs, Leah Kaplan states the
number of reported rapes has
been "increasing tremend
ously." Seriously, who is try
ing to keep this information
straight, on record, and open
to the public? Is this false
sense of security the product
of an effort to keep the image
of Stanford University as a sec
luded, wonderful retreat?
Agreed, that may be an ex
treme deduction, but at whose
expense are we being kept ig
norant of the facts? Or rather,
for whose benefit? Get the
facts out, report them and gain
safety through awareness. It's
not as if student don't have
enough on their minds that
they should also be preoc
cupied with trying to deduce
facts from vague and con
tradictory reports and heresay.

Editor's note: Niemeyer's and
Kaplan's statements are not
contradictory. Both acknow
ledge this was the first campus
case of sexual assault reported
to law enforcement personnel
this year. The story made clear

that rape and assault cases are
up this year in the area, not
just on campus, and Kaplan
and Niemeyer expressed this
concern.
However, in her capacity as
assistant dean of student af
fairs, Kaplan is aware of many
more cases that ate never re
ported to the police. For what
should be apparent reasons,
victims are often afraid to take
that step.
Due to obvious sensitivity,
sexual assault cases are very
difficult to report in the Daily.
The Daily cannot report
rumors, and without cases
being reported to police, it is
next to impossible to verify in
formation. However, when the
Daily knows for a concrete fact
of an attack, it will be re
ported. Cood discretion is
used in deciding to print or
withhold a victim's name.
To say that "awareness is not
being encouraged" by the
University community is a mis
take. The Rape Education Pro
ject has been working for
about a year to make Univer
sity residents more aware of
the dangers and consequ
ences of rape. This group
sponsors discussion groups
in living areas throughout the
year.
The Daily has planned for
publication next week a story
on their work. Research on this
story started weeks before this
attack.
Kaplan's office also works
continually on the problem of
rape and assault on women.

Daily ad
stereotypes
The full page ad for Evelyn
Wood Reading Dynamics
which ran in the Daily on Fri
day, Nov. 3, page 5, is an
example of negative role rein
forcement. It degrades men by
implying a conflict between
masculinity and studying. It
especially offends women by
portraying them as bored, im
patient creatures who have
nothing important to do but
wait for "the man" to finish his
task.
The ad does not lead us to
think they will be going out for
an ice cream, but hints it a
more adult pleasure. In this
way, women are seen as treats
— rather than fellow students
and equals. Lastly, it offers a
dim view of student life and
the academic environment in
general, by allowing the male
student the melancholy alter
natives of either facing eight
chapters in a dull book or a
rocky personal encounter.
Though men, women and
the University are all shown in
a negative light in this ad, the
implications are stronger for
women since there already
exists in the media a prece
dent of portraying women as
uninvolved limited particip
ants in life. Rather than prom
ote destructive images of
women (and men) in its adver
tisements, the Daily should
make an effort to adhere to
standards of respect and cour

tesy towards the academic
community it serves.
The Evelyn Wood ad is an
insult to all members \of the
Stanford community. An apol
ogy is in order.

(Editors note: Although the re
ferred to Evelyn Wood ad
might possibly contain some
sexist implications, the Daily's
position is that more has been
read into the ad than is there. I
fail to see the hints "at more
adult pleasure" nor do I really
see any slant on the academic
community as a whole.
Perhaps she has already
finished her work. Personally
the ad reminds me of the times
that my girlfriend has finished
her studies and is waiting for
me to go out to dinner. Now I
do not feel that my girlfriend is
non-productive, "bored" or an
"impatient creature."
The Daily business depart
ment realizes that in the past,
we have made mistakes in
judgment in regards to particu
lar ads. However in this case,
we feel that we must draw the
line. For from this letter and a
phone conversation I had with
the author, it appears that the
above group will continue to
write us letters when any ad
appears in the paper that con
tains both a man and a wo
man. We reserve the right to
decide what type of ads appear
in the paper. However we are
interested in hearing from the
Stanford community.
In conclusion, we feel that
an apology is not in order.
