## Soviet persecution continues 
### 
Jews have lived on the territory of what
is now the Soviet Union for at least a
thousand years, sometimes in bad condi
tions, sometimes worse. Ancestors of to
day's Russian Jews were herded into the
Pale of Settlement by Czar Alexander.
They probably suffered the pogroms,
which czarist regimes occasionally en
couraged in order to provide an outlet for
the frustrations of the oppressed peasan
try. The best times that the Jews ever en
joyed in Russia were when the authorities
left them alone in their villages or allowed
them to work unhindered in the great
cities.
The 19th century provided three new
options for a Jewish population which
had become inured to persecution. One
was emigration to America, a path which
many opted for. An equally popular
choice was Zionism. The third alternative
was socialism. Thousands of Russian Jews
embraced this third course. Those who
were isolated from the political events of
the cities were also swept up in Lenin's
victory.
Yet Lenin's promise of religious free
dom was short-lived. According to two
professors of Soviet history, Stanley
Rothman and George Breslauer, "In the
1920'5, independent Jewish institutions
came under assault, which led by the late
1930's to the virtual suffocation of Jewish
religious institutions. Stalin initiated a vio
lent campaign for the elimination of
Jewish consciousness." The three million
Jews of the modern Soviet Union must
live with the legacy of official persecu
tion. On the internal passport, which
every Soviet citizen must carry, a Jew is
not classified as Russina, or Georgian, or
Uzbek, but as "Jew."
The list of discriminatory practices
against Jews in the Soviet Union is long.
Jewish publishing houses and Jewish
printing presses have been closed.
Less than 60 synagogues remain, but
few function much of the time. Those
who attend services are fearful that the
K.G.B. will disrupt their prayer.
Soviet Jews no longer can get good jobs
in the U.S.S.R., in contrast to only a few
years ago. Some universities now have
quotas.

Due process for Jews in court proceed
ings which are emigration-related is next
to non-existent.
For many people acquainted with this
record of systematic persecution, thg
emergence in the Soviet Union of a nevy
Jewish 'nationalism,' sparked by Israel's
victory in the Six Day War of 1967, was
incredible. After 1967, a substantial
minority of Soviet Jews, numbering over
100,000, made the unprecedented deci
sion to leave the U.S.S.R.-*
In 1968, the Ministry of Interior notified
a few Jewish families that if they still
wanted to go to Israel, they could. By
1973, the apex of the new emigration,
2500 Jews were leaving the Soviet Union
every month.
The impetus for Jewish emigration
came at a time when the Soviet Union was
unusually sensitive to its human rights re
cord; for it coincided with the economic
and strategic policy agreements reached
by the United States and the U.S.S.R.
which became known as "detente."
This "Second Exodus," as some Jewish
leaders termed the increased emigration,
was seen as a victory for the "quiet dip
lomacy," of U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
Then Senator Henry Jackson of
Washington, proposed an amendment
which linked the granting of Most Fa
vored Nation trading status to the Soviet
Union, to a freer Soviet emigration policy.
It was Kissinger's belief, that coercion
on the part of the U.S., even in the form
of a legislative amendment, would only
cause the Soviets to balk. He was right.
8y 1977, in reaction to "interference in
the internal affairs of the U.5.5.R.," the
number of exit permits granted to Jews
had decreased to 4540 annually, from the
peak of 34,700 in 1973.
Even if Brezhnev and company had de
cided they could ignore the political im
plications of the Jatkson amendment, the
Stevenson amendment, which limited
bank credits to the U.S.S.R. and banned
loans for Siberain gas development,
proved to them that a liberal emigration
policy would not guarantee economic
favors.

In its fervent criticism of nations which
violate human rights, the Carter administ
ration does not seem to have learned the

"lesson of the Jackson amendment."
Spokesmen for the new administration
took on the totalitarian states with an ag
gressive tone.
Confronted not only by Soviet resis
tance to what it perceives as meddling by
Americans in their own affairs, but also by
a difficult agenda of issues such as ratifi
cation of a SALT II treaty, President Jimmy
Carter and his assistants have recently
toned down their public criticisms of
Soviet behavior. The administration still
indicates that it is vigorously pursuing the
cases of oppressed dissidents, but pre
dominantly through diplomatic channels.
For their part, the Soviets have taken a
pragmatic approach to the human rights
question. Their signature on the Helsinki
accords of 1976, which promise freer
emigration and communication between
East and West, did not prevent a series of
dissident trials over the summer.
Meanwhile, the Soviet policy towards
its Jewish population seems to have in
creased in complexity. Educated Jews,
valuable to a nation in need of technical
achievements, are discouraged or pre
vented from leaving. Older Jews, and
those from rural regions, appear to have
the fewest barriers to emigration.
Faced with rigid Soviet institutions and
a paralyzed American government, the
movement to save Soviet lewry has
turned increasingly towards vocal public
protest against Soviet repression.
It is precisely this course of action that
Sonja Slepak, a Soviet dissident, advo
cated in his Stanford speech. "If you write
to your senators and congressmen . ..
they cannot ignore your request, and
Russian cannot ignore the action taken
(by the government)," he said.
Slepak said that the U.S. should "take a
stronger stand," on the rights of Soviet
J;ws.
"I know that compromise works some
tines," he said, "but I don't think it will
w>rk this time."

joyed in Russia were when the authorities
left them alone in their villages or allowed
them to work unhindered in the great
cities.
The 19th century provided three new
options for a Jewish population which
had become inured to persecution. One
was emigration to America, a path which
many opted for. An equally popular
choice was Zionism. The third alternative
was socialism. Thousands of Russian Jews
embraced this third course. Those who
were isolated from the political events of
the cities were also swept up in Lenin's
victory.
Yet Lenin's promise of religious free
dom was short-lived. According to two
professors of Soviet history, Stanley
Rothman and George Breslauer, "In the
1920'5, independent Jewish institutions
came under assault, which led by the late
1930's to the virtual suffocation of Jewish
religious institutions. Stalin initiated a vio
lent campaign for the elimination of
Jewish consciousness." The three million
Jews of the modern Soviet Union must
live with the legacy of official persecu
tion. On the internal passport, which
every Soviet citizen must carry, a Jew is
not classified as Russina, or Georgian, or
Uzbek, but as "Jew."
The list of discriminatory practices
against Jews in the Soviet Union is long.
Jewish publishing houses and Jewish
printing presses have been closed.
Less than 60 synagogues remain, but
few function much of the time. Those
who attend services are fearful that the
K.G.B. will disrupt their prayer.
Soviet Jews no longer can get good jobs
in the U.S.S.R., in contrast to only a few
years ago. Some universities now have
quotas.

Due process for Jews in court proceed
ings which are emigration-related is next
to non-existent.
For many people acquainted with this
record of systematic persecution, thg
emergence in the Soviet Union of a nevy
Jewish 'nationalism,' sparked by Israel's
victory in the Six Day War of 1967, was
incredible. After 1967, a substantial
minority of Soviet Jews, numbering over
100,000, made the unprecedented deci
sion to leave the U.S.S.R.-*
In 1968, the Ministry of Interior notified
a few Jewish families that if they still
wanted to go to Israel, they could. By
1973, the apex of the new emigration,
2500 Jews were leaving the Soviet Union
every month.
The impetus for Jewish emigration
came at a time when the Soviet Union was
unusually sensitive to its human rights re
cord; for it coincided with the economic
and strategic policy agreements reached
by the United States and the U.S.S.R.
which became known as "detente."
This "Second Exodus," as some Jewish
leaders termed the increased emigration,
was seen as a victory for the "quiet dip
lomacy," of U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
Then Senator Henry Jackson of
Washington, proposed an amendment
which linked the granting of Most Fa
vored Nation trading status to the Soviet
Union, to a freer Soviet emigration policy.
It was Kissinger's belief, that coercion
on the part of the U.S., even in the form
of a legislative amendment, would only
cause the Soviets to balk. He was right.
8y 1977, in reaction to "interference in
the internal affairs of the U.5.5.R.," the
number of exit permits granted to Jews
had decreased to 4540 annually, from the
peak of 34,700 in 1973.
Even if Brezhnev and company had de
cided they could ignore the political im
plications of the Jatkson amendment, the
Stevenson amendment, which limited
bank credits to the U.S.S.R. and banned
loans for Siberain gas development,
proved to them that a liberal emigration
policy would not guarantee economic
favors.

In its fervent criticism of nations which
violate human rights, the Carter administ
ration does not seem to have learned the

"lesson of the Jackson amendment."
Spokesmen for the new administration
took on the totalitarian states with an ag
gressive tone.
Confronted not only by Soviet resis
tance to what it perceives as meddling by
Americans in their own affairs, but also by
a difficult agenda of issues such as ratifi
cation of a SALT II treaty, President Jimmy
Carter and his assistants have recently
toned down their public criticisms of
Soviet behavior. The administration still
indicates that it is vigorously pursuing the
cases of oppressed dissidents, but pre
dominantly through diplomatic channels.
For their part, the Soviets have taken a
pragmatic approach to the human rights
question. Their signature on the Helsinki
accords of 1976, which promise freer
emigration and communication between
East and West, did not prevent a series of
dissident trials over the summer.
Meanwhile, the Soviet policy towards
its Jewish population seems to have in
creased in complexity. Educated Jews,
valuable to a nation in need of technical
achievements, are discouraged or pre
vented from leaving. Older Jews, and
those from rural regions, appear to have
the fewest barriers to emigration.
Faced with rigid Soviet institutions and
a paralyzed American government, the
movement to save Soviet lewry has
turned increasingly towards vocal public
protest against Soviet repression.
It is precisely this course of action that
Sonja Slepak, a Soviet dissident, advo
cated in his Stanford speech. "If you write
to your senators and congressmen . ..
they cannot ignore your request, and
Russian cannot ignore the action taken
(by the government)," he said.
Slepak said that the U.S. should "take a

were isolated from the political events of
the cities were also swept up in Lenin's
victory.
Yet Lenin's promise of religious free
dom was short-lived. According to two
professors of Soviet history, Stanley
Rothman and George Breslauer, "In the
1920'5, independent Jewish institutions
came under assault, which led by the late
1930's to the virtual suffocation of Jewish
religious institutions. Stalin initiated a vio
lent campaign for the elimination of
Jewish consciousness." The three million
Jews of the modern Soviet Union must
live with the legacy of official persecu
tion. On the internal passport, which
every Soviet citizen must carry, a Jew is
not classified as Russina, or Georgian, or
Uzbek, but as "Jew."
The list of discriminatory practices
against Jews in the Soviet Union is long.
Jewish publishing houses and Jewish
printing presses have been closed.
Less than 60 synagogues remain, but
few function much of the time. Those
who attend services are fearful that the
K.G.B. will disrupt their prayer.
Soviet Jews no longer can get good jobs
in the U.S.S.R., in contrast to only a few
years ago. Some universities now have
quotas.

Due process for Jews in court proceed
ings which are emigration-related is next
to non-existent.
For many people acquainted with this
record of systematic persecution, thg
emergence in the Soviet Union of a nevy
Jewish 'nationalism,' sparked by Israel's
victory in the Six Day War of 1967, was
incredible. After 1967, a substantial
minority of Soviet Jews, numbering over
100,000, made the unprecedented deci
sion to leave the U.S.S.R.-*
In 1968, the Ministry of Interior notified
a few Jewish families that if they still
wanted to go to Israel, they could. By
1973, the apex of the new emigration,
2500 Jews were leaving the Soviet Union
every month.
The impetus for Jewish emigration
came at a time when the Soviet Union was
unusually sensitive to its human rights re
cord; for it coincided with the economic
and strategic policy agreements reached
by the United States and the U.S.S.R.
which became known as "detente."
This "Second Exodus," as some Jewish
leaders termed the increased emigration,
was seen as a victory for the "quiet dip
lomacy," of U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
Then Senator Henry Jackson of
Washington, proposed an amendment
which linked the granting of Most Fa
vored Nation trading status to the Soviet
Union, to a freer Soviet emigration policy.
It was Kissinger's belief, that coercion
on the part of the U.S., even in the form
of a legislative amendment, would only
cause the Soviets to balk. He was right.
8y 1977, in reaction to "interference in
the internal affairs of the U.5.5.R.," the
number of exit permits granted to Jews
had decreased to 4540 annually, from the
peak of 34,700 in 1973.
Even if Brezhnev and company had de
cided they could ignore the political im
plications of the Jatkson amendment, the
Stevenson amendment, which limited
bank credits to the U.S.S.R. and banned
loans for Siberain gas development,
proved to them that a liberal emigration
policy would not guarantee economic
favors.

In its fervent criticism of nations which
violate human rights, the Carter administ
ration does not seem to have learned the

"lesson of the Jackson amendment."
Spokesmen for the new administration
took on the totalitarian states with an ag
gressive tone.
Confronted not only by Soviet resis
tance to what it perceives as meddling by
Americans in their own affairs, but also by
a difficult agenda of issues such as ratifi
cation of a SALT II treaty, President Jimmy
Carter and his assistants have recently
toned down their public criticisms of
Soviet behavior. The administration still
indicates that it is vigorously pursuing the
cases of oppressed dissidents, but pre
dominantly through diplomatic channels.
For their part, the Soviets have taken a
pragmatic approach to the human rights
question. Their signature on the Helsinki
accords of 1976, which promise freer
emigration and communication between
East and West, did not prevent a series of
dissident trials over the summer.
Meanwhile, the Soviet policy towards
its Jewish population seems to have in
creased in complexity. Educated Jews,
valuable to a nation in need of technical
achievements, are discouraged or pre
vented from leaving. Older Jews, and
those from rural regions, appear to have
the fewest barriers to emigration.
Faced with rigid Soviet institutions and
a paralyzed American government, the
movement to save Soviet lewry has
turned increasingly towards vocal public
protest against Soviet repression.
It is precisely this course of action that
Sonja Slepak, a Soviet dissident, advo
cated in his Stanford speech. "If you write
to your senators and congressmen . ..
they cannot ignore your request, and
Russian cannot ignore the action taken
(by the government)," he said.
Slepak said that the U.S. should "take a
stronger stand," on the rights of Soviet
J;ws.
"I know that compromise works some
tines," he said, "but I don't think it will
w>rk this time."

Jews have lived on the territory of what
is now the Soviet Union for at least a
thousand years, sometimes in bad condi
tions, sometimes worse. Ancestors of to
day's Russian Jews were herded into the
Pale of Settlement by Czar Alexander.
They probably suffered the pogroms,
which czarist regimes occasionally en
couraged in order to provide an outlet for
the frustrations of the oppressed peasan
try. The best times that the Jews ever en
joyed in Russia were when the authorities
left them alone in their villages or allowed
them to work unhindered in the great
cities.
The 19th century provided three new
options for a Jewish population which
had become inured to persecution. One
was emigration to America, a path which
many opted for. An equally popular
choice was Zionism. The third alternative
was socialism. Thousands of Russian Jews
embraced this third course. Those who
were isolated from the political events of
the cities were also swept up in Lenin's
