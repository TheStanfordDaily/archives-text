## Food self-reliance a 'must' to face hunger 
### 
The world food situation is
precarious. World food sec
urity, the goal of the 1974
World Food Conference, is
becoming dangerously lost
among the complex array of
economic, social and political
issues facing the world. Mal
nutrition and starvation are
occuring today on a massive
and critical scale.
Projections are that the
number of people living in a
"state of hunger" will increase
rapidly and dramatically in the
near future. The annual food
deficit of underdeveloped
countries is expected to rise
from 36 million metric tons in
1978 to between 120 and 145
million metric tons in 1990.
The World Food Council has
designated 44 countries as
being in critical need of food.
World hunger is the result
of a complex web of poverty
that denies basic human
needs. These needs obviously
include food, shelther, clo
thing, adequate health care,
and education. Their absence
is what constitutes poverty;
their presence provides the
preconditions for future food
security.
Effective efforts to alleviate
world hunger must address
this poverty from which
hunger emerges. The problem
is the lack of essential com
munity structures and services
that enable people to produce
for their own future welfare.
The development of this
community infrastructure is
the goal of "Aid for Self-
Reliance."
"Aid for Self-Reliance"
means that food and de
velopment aid should be given
in ways that limit future food

aid dependency and promote
people's ability to be self
reliant in meeting their own
future food needs. The obvi
ous question is: how can this
be done? Obvious answers are
few.
The problem of food de
pendency is as complex as is
the poverty which surrounds
it. But food self-reliance must
be at the center of any long
term approach addressing
hunger.
Development and food aid
are at present the principal
contributions of richer nations
to poorer countries. Aid must
be given in ways that place
emphasis on land, credit, and
tax reform; labor-intensive
farm technology; and locally
oriented marketing structures
and resource development.
All are essential to improving
nutritional levels. Use of land
for export cropping should
ordinarily be discouraged until
a country's domestic need is
adequately met.
Food self-reliance does not
necessarily mean producing
everything one eats but rather
the maximum use of resources
for local food needs. The mea
sure of food self-reliance is the
nutritional level rather than
total production. It is also a
measure of both who receives
the food produced and who
controls its production.
Aid through private, religi
ous, and governmental agen
cies can be given to "food for
work" projects, that develop
local irrigation and organic fer
tilizer production, build
schools, provide for health
care facilities, and other com
munity structures which
would support agricultural

production with the use of
local resources. Aid can be
given for supplies that provide
fencing, tools, watering cans,
seeds, well pumps, and other
necessary items that help
people to produce their own
food.
It is a simple fact that re
forming trade, investments,
and loan policies to promote a
more equitable and just ex
change of resources would
develop more self reliance and
do more to alleviate hunger
than anything undertaken in
the area of aid assistance.
Trade, investments, and loans
represent a much greater
transfer of resources and
wealth than does develop
ment and food aid.
Foreign debt cancellation
for the most seriously under
developed nations is crucial if
they are to avert massive mal
nutrition and starvation. Of
equal importance are such re
forms as getter terms of trade
for poorer nations, more con
trol over foreign investment
and technology transfers, and
assurances that it will not shift
with political winds. Most of
these reforms have been
placed before richer, indust
rially developed nations under
the title of a "New Interna
tional Economic Order." So
far response by industrial na
tions has been minimal
Of course, there are still the
problems of high levels of
military spending, exported
urban and capital intensive
development, unemployment,
multinational control of local
agriculture and land, food in
dustry advertising practices
and nutritional illiteracy.
You will be hearing more of

"Aid for Self Reliance" silce it
is the theme for this year'sDay
of Fasting. The fast will tegin
on the evening of Nov. 20and
end on the following evenng.
The money you donate omhe
Day of Fasting will be sentto
food and development aid >r
ganizations with a letter urghg
that it be used to promQe

self-reliant food production.
The world food situation de
mands your concern, your re
sources, and your heightened
awareness if world food sec
urity is to be a future possibil

the poverty which surrounds
it. But food self-reliance must
be at the center of any long
term approach addressing
hunger.
Development and food aid
are at present the principal
contributions of richer nations
to poorer countries. Aid must
be given in ways that place
emphasis on land, credit, and
tax reform; labor-intensive
farm technology; and locally
oriented marketing structures
and resource development.
All are essential to improving
nutritional levels. Use of land
for export cropping should
ordinarily be discouraged until
a country's domestic need is
adequately met.
Food self-reliance does not
necessarily mean producing
everything one eats but rather
the maximum use of resources
for local food needs. The mea
sure of food self-reliance is the
nutritional level rather than
total production. It is also a
measure of both who receives
the food produced and who
controls its production.
Aid through private, religi
ous, and governmental agen
cies can be given to "food for
work" projects, that develop
local irrigation and organic fer
tilizer production, build
schools, provide for health
care facilities, and other com
munity structures which
would support agricultural

production with the use of
local resources. Aid can be
given for supplies that provide
fencing, tools, watering cans,
seeds, well pumps, and other
necessary items that help
people to produce their own
food.
It is a simple fact that re
forming trade, investments,
and loan policies to promote a
more equitable and just ex
change of resources would
develop more self reliance and
do more to alleviate hunger
than anything undertaken in
the area of aid assistance.
Trade, investments, and loans
represent a much greater
transfer of resources and
wealth than does develop
ment and food aid.
Foreign debt cancellation
for the most seriously under
developed nations is crucial if
they are to avert massive mal
nutrition and starvation. Of
equal importance are such re
forms as getter terms of trade
for poorer nations, more con

and technology transfers, and
assurances that it will not shift
with political winds. Most of
these reforms have been
placed before richer, indust
rially developed nations under
the title of a "New Interna
tional Economic Order." So

tions has been minimal
Of course, there are still the

The world food situation is
precarious. World food sec
urity, the goal of the 1974
World Food Conference, is
becoming dangerously lost
among the complex array of
economic, social and political
issues facing the world. Mal
nutrition and starvation are
occuring today on a massive
and critical scale.
Projections are that the
number of people living in a
"state of hunger" will increase
rapidly and dramatically in the
near future. The annual food
deficit of underdeveloped
countries is expected to rise
from 36 million metric tons in
1978 to between 120 and 145
million metric tons in 1990.
The World Food Council has
designated 44 countries as
being in critical need of food.
World hunger is the result
of a complex web of poverty
that denies basic human
needs. These needs obviously
include food, shelther, clo
thing, adequate health care,
and education. Their absence
is what constitutes poverty;
their presence provides the
preconditions for future food
security.
Effective efforts to alleviate
world hunger must address
this poverty from which
hunger emerges. The problem
is the lack of essential com
munity structures and services
that enable people to produce
for their own future welfare.
The development of this
community infrastructure is
the goal of "Aid for Self-
Reliance."
"Aid for Self-Reliance"
means that food and de
velopment aid should be given
in ways that limit future food

aid dependency and promote
people's ability to be self
reliant in meeting their own
future food needs. The obvi

be done? Obvious answers are
few.
