# California politics take turn-around
## Bi-partisan administration elected 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Despite
Democratic Gov. Edmund
Brown, Jr.'s easy win over Re
publican Evelle Younger —
3,322,396 to 2,110,611 with 85
percent of the vote counted —
Californians elected Republi
cans Mike Curb as lieutenant
governor and Ceorge
Deukmejian as attorney gen
eral.
It was the first time since
1894 that California voters
elected a governor and a
lieutenant governor from dif
ferent parties.
Brown's margin of victory
was the biggest in three de
cades of gubernatorial elec
tions, exceeded only by Earl
Warren's 10-1 victory over a
Prohibition candidate in 1946.
The landslide win normally
would boost Brown's stock as
a potential presidential candi
date in 1980, but Curb compli
cates that picture since Brown
would have to turn California
over to a Republican if elected
president.
The lieutenant governor
also assumes all duties of the
chief executive when the gov
ernor leaves the state tem
porarily, which would make it
difficult for Brown to even test
the waters in other state
primaries.
The 40-year-old governor
said his victory "is an oppor
tunity. It's a victory. I like to
take it not as a personal vic
tory, but a victory for all of
you."
Asked if he might run for
president in 1980, Brown re
plied, "I have locked nothing
in and nothing out." Brown, a
late" entry in the 1976
primaries, defeated jimmy
Carter in five of six primaries
two years ago.
In a concession speech be
fore a silent crowd at his cam
paign headquarters, Younger
said he offered Brown "my
good wishes." He said he was
disappointed, but "we've had
a contest and the people have
made their decision."
Six months ago, Younger
was tied with Brown in some
polls and slightly ahead in
others, due in part to Brown's
vehement opposition to Prop
osition 13.
But Younger stumbled re
peatedly, and Brown seized
the initiative by leading legisla
tive efforts to make Proposi
tion 13 work while Younger, a
reluctant supporter of 13, kept
a low profile.

Mike Curb, a millionaire re
cord producer who claimed
his success in business proved
he could be a success as
lieutenant governor, emerged
the victor in one of the tough
est political battles ever waged
in California.
By defeating Mervyn Dym
ally — the first black to serve
in the state's No. 2 spot — the
Republican music mogul
Tuesday became the first
lieutenant governor since 1894
to belong to a different party
than the governor.
With 84 percent of the pre
cincts reporting, Curb had
2,918,791 votes to Dymally's
2,517,011 for a 51-44 percent
margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
produced records for such
performers as Sammy Davis
)r., Debby Boone and the Os
mond Brothers, stressed that
he would be an aggressive
lieutenant governor even
though he must work under a
Democrat.
"I just have a tremendous
sense of obligation now to
make sure I serve properly in
office," Curb told cheering
supporters in Los Angeles
after claiming victory Tuesday
night. "I'm going to do every
thing in my power to be the
most aggressive lieutenant
governor I can possibly be."
Smiling broadly, Curb
buoyantly accepted his victory
and announced a second
reason for celebration — he
learned that his wife is pre
gnant.
Curb's success came after a
hard-fought campaign charac
terized by a blistering ex
change of personal smears in
which Dymally tried to blac
ken Curb's clean-cut Horatio
Alger image.
Curb admitted that he lost
the support of some Republi
cans after Dymally revealed
that Curb at 21 had been musi
cal director for a racy film ti
tled Mondo Hollywood.

"victory for law enforcement"

results Tuesday night spelled
defeat for Burke, a Los
Angeles Democrat,
He did not mention Burke, a
46-year-old former as
semblywoman who gave up
her congressional seat to seek
the post she insisted she could
win despite the fact she was a
liberal black woman.
Deukmejian, who had lost a
bid for the post in the 1970 Re
publican primary, had made
Burke's liberal record the cen
terpiece of his campaign,
stressing his own strong law
enforcement backing.
Each television commercial
run by the Long Beach
senator, who outspent Burke
about $760,000 to $710,000, as
sured Californians that if he
won, "if someone commits a
crime, they are going to pay
the price."

Deukmejian, son of an
Armenian businessman and a
good friend of police officers
since childhood, also never
missed a chance to mention
Burke's opposition to the
death penalty.
Burke, daughter of a
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
janitor, tried to counter
Deukmejian's attack by argu
ing she would be tough on
crime and protesting that
Deukmejian would favor spe
cial interests.
Though Deukemjian trailed
in polls through much of the
campaign, his bid was not
hampered by any historical
tendency of Californians to
demand an attorney general of
the same party as the gover
nor.

Burke, daughter of a

Though Deukemjian trailed
in polls through much of the
campaign, his bid was not
hampered by any historical
tendency of Californians to
demand an attorney general of
the same party as the gover
nor.
In recent times, Earl Warren,
Edmund Brown Sr., Thomas
Lynch and Evelle Younger
have all won the job when the
governor was from the oppo
site party.
Los Angeles (AP) — Despite
Democratic Gov. Edmund
Brown, Jr.'s easy win over Re
publican Evelle Younger —
3,322,396 to 2,110,611 with 85
percent of the vote counted —
Californians elected Republi
cans Mike Curb as lieutenant
governor and Ceorge
Deukmejian as attorney gen
eral.
It was the first time since
1894 that California voters
elected a governor and a
lieutenant governor from dif
ferent parties.
Brown's margin of victory
was the biggest in three de
cades of gubernatorial elec
tions, exceeded only by Earl
Warren's 10-1 victory over a
Prohibition candidate in 1946.
The landslide win normally
would boost Brown's stock as
a potential presidential candi
date in 1980, but Curb compli
cates that picture since Brown
would have to turn California
over to a Republican if elected
president.
The lieutenant governor
also assumes all duties of the
chief executive when the gov
ernor leaves the state tem
porarily, which would make it
difficult for Brown to even test
the waters in other state
primaries.
The 40-year-old governor
said his victory "is an oppor
tunity. It's a victory. I like to
take it not as a personal vic
tory, but a victory for all of
you."
Asked if he might run for
president in 1980, Brown re
plied, "I have locked nothing
in and nothing out." Brown, a
late" entry in the 1976
primaries, defeated jimmy
Carter in five of six primaries
two years ago.
In a concession speech be
fore a silent crowd at his cam
paign headquarters, Younger
said he offered Brown "my
good wishes." He said he was
disappointed, but "we've had
a contest and the people have
made their decision."
Six months ago, Younger
was tied with Brown in some
polls and slightly ahead in
others, due in part to Brown's
vehement opposition to Prop
osition 13.
But Younger stumbled re
peatedly, and Brown seized
the initiative by leading legisla
tive efforts to make Proposi
tion 13 work while Younger, a
reluctant supporter of 13, kept
a low profile.

Mike Curb, a millionaire re
cord producer who claimed
his success in business proved
he could be a success as
lieutenant governor, emerged
the victor in one of the tough
est political battles ever waged
in California.
By defeating Mervyn Dym
ally — the first black to serve
in the state's No. 2 spot — the
Republican music mogul
Tuesday became the first
lieutenant governor since 1894
to belong to a different party
than the governor.
With 84 percent of the pre
cincts reporting, Curb had
2,918,791 votes to Dymally's
2,517,011 for a 51-44 percent
margin.
The 33-year-old Curb, who
produced records for such
performers as Sammy Davis
)r., Debby Boone and the Os
mond Brothers, stressed that
he would be an aggressive
lieutenant governor even
though he must work under a
Democrat.
"I just have a tremendous
sense of obligation now to
make sure I serve properly in
office," Curb told cheering
supporters in Los Angeles
after claiming victory Tuesday
night. "I'm going to do every
thing in my power to be the
most aggressive lieutenant
governor I can possibly be."
Smiling broadly, Curb
buoyantly accepted his victory
and announced a second
reason for celebration — he
learned that his wife is pre
gnant.
Curb's success came after a
hard-fought campaign charac
terized by a blistering ex
change of personal smears in
which Dymally tried to blac
ken Curb's clean-cut Horatio
Alger image.
Curb admitted that he lost
