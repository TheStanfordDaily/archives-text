# Absentee ballots to decide
## 10th State Dist. race not over 
### RACHEL BAGBY 
The 10th District race between in
cumbent state Sen. Arlen Cregorio
and Republican challenger Marz
Garcia is so close that absentee bal
lots will probably decide the winner.
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters George Mann said that to his
knowledge, this "is the closest legis
lative race ever to occur in this dis
trict."
Cregorio has a mere 39-vote lead
over Garcia. Final tallies released
yesterday morning showed Cre
gorio with 87/189 votes and Garcia
with 87,150.
Two-term incumbent Cregorio,
47, and the political novice Garcia,
41, virtually matched each other
with winning margins in Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties. The 10th

Senate district is almost evenly di
vided between the two counties.
Absentee ballots
More than 450 absentee ballots in
San Mateo County and more than
270 in Santa Clara County have yet to
be counted. The tallies of those bal
lots will determine the winner.
According to the Palo Alto Times,
absentee ballots traditionally favor
the Republican candidate.
Election provisions here allow ab
sentee voters to leave their ballots at
any polling place in the county by 8
p.m. election night. These ballots
are then collected from each pre
cinct's delivery pouch.
"It is virtually impossible to get
absentee votes into the computer
on election night," said Dick South,
Chief Deputy County Clerk for San

Mateo County. This is because the
counting of absentee ballots in
volves an extensive process," he
said.
Signatures to be checked
According to South, the county
clerk's office must match voters'
signatures on absentee ballots with
their signatures on the applications
for these ballots. In addition, pre
cinct indexes must be (.becked to
ensure that absentee voters did not
vote twice by also voting at the polls.
South said the votes from absen
tee ballots in his county will be an
nounced this afternoon. Mann said
his office will begin computing ab
sentee ballots this afternoon, but
the final results may not be an
nounced until Mdnday.
Both South and Mann said that an
official canvass of all voting tallies
will commence late this afternoon.
South said the canvass will be ob
served by members of both the Gre
gorio and Garcia camps. According
to Mann, the official canvass could
"take a while to complete," thus
prolonging the uncertainty tor Gre
gorio and Garcia.
Certifiction deadline
The deadline for certifying the re
sults of the official canvass to the
secretary of state is Dec. 5. The sec
retary must then compile the official
list of winners by Dec. 16. But Mann
said the list will probably be com
pleted before that date because the
legislature convenes in early De
cember.
Other late election results for this
area are:
— Incumbent Assemblyman Vic
tor Calvo beat Republican chal
lenger Greg Morris in the race for
the 21st district assembly seat.
— In Santa Cruz, Measure B,
which would have set up rent con
trol and the bureaucracy to adminis
ter it, was narrowly defeated by
8854 to 8756.

said the list will probably be com
pleted before that date because the
legislature convenes in early De
cember.
Other late election results for this
area are:
— Incumbent Assemblyman Vic
tor Calvo beat Republican chal
lenger Greg Morris in the race for
the 21st district assembly seat.
— In Santa Cruz, Measure B,
which would have set up rent con
trol and the bureaucracy to adminis
ter it, was narrowly defeated by
8854 to 8756.
The 10th District race between in
cumbent state Sen. Arlen Cregorio
and Republican challenger Marz
Garcia is so close that absentee bal
lots will probably decide the winner.
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters George Mann said that to his
knowledge, this "is the closest legis
lative race ever to occur in this dis
trict."
Cregorio has a mere 39-vote lead
over Garcia. Final tallies released
yesterday morning showed Cre
gorio with 87/189 votes and Garcia
with 87,150.
Two-term incumbent Cregorio,
47, and the political novice Garcia,
41, virtually matched each other
with winning margins in Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties. The 10th

Senate district is almost evenly di
vided between the two counties.
Absentee ballots
More than 450 absentee ballots in
San Mateo County and more than
270 in Santa Clara County have yet to
be counted. The tallies of those bal
lots will determine the winner.
According to the Palo Alto Times,
absentee ballots traditionally favor
the Republican candidate.
Election provisions here allow ab
sentee voters to leave their ballots at
any polling place in the county by 8
p.m. election night. These ballots
are then collected from each pre
cinct's delivery pouch.
"It is virtually impossible to get
absentee votes into the computer
on election night," said Dick South,
Chief Deputy County Clerk for San

Mateo County. This is because the
counting of absentee ballots in
volves an extensive process," he
said.
Signatures to be checked
According to South, the county
clerk's office must match voters'
signatures on absentee ballots with
their signatures on the applications
for these ballots. In addition, pre
cinct indexes must be (.becked to
ensure that absentee voters did not
vote twice by also voting at the polls.
South said the votes from absen
tee ballots in his county will be an
nounced this afternoon. Mann said
his office will begin computing ab
sentee ballots this afternoon, but
the final results may not be an
nounced until Mdnday.
Both South and Mann said that an
official canvass of all voting tallies
will commence late this afternoon.
South said the canvass will be ob
served by members of both the Gre
gorio and Garcia camps. According
to Mann, the official canvass could
"take a while to complete," thus
prolonging the uncertainty tor Gre
gorio and Garcia.
Certifiction deadline
The deadline for certifying the re
sults of the official canvass to the
secretary of state is Dec. 5. The sec
retary must then compile the official
list of winners by Dec. 16. But Mann
said the list will probably be com
pleted before that date because the
legislature convenes in early De
cember.
