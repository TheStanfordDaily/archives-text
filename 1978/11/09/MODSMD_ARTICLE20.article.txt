# Law students counsel, gain experience
## 
### JOHN DEAN 
Perhaps you're having a dis
pute with your landlord over
high rent charges. Maybe you
and your student spouse have
decided to divorce. Or it could
be that your new Pioneer
stereo was stolen from your
dorm room last night.
Students needing legal ad
vice on these and many other
problems don't need hun
dreds of dollars to pay stagger
ing legal fees. The ASSU
funded Legal Counseling Of
fice (LCO), located on cam
pus, can advise students in
routine legal problems that
require little litigation. The of
fice employs a law firm from
San jose to counsel students.
In addition, 15 volunteer Uni
versity law students work for
the LCO. According to law
student Chuck Crovitz, coor
dinator of the volunteers, the
LCO experience "lets law
students disabuse themselves
of misconceptions that they
learn about the practice of law
in law school."
Law students have a variety
of reasons for selecting to
work at the LCO. "The LCO
offers a perfect opportunity
for students to gain actual ex
perience in the legal environ
ment," Crovitz continued. For
example, he said that the LCO

offers a client-counseling or
"people" service, which the
Law School here can't offer to
the prospective lawyer.
Students want a non
textbook approach to solving
legal problems. "I wanted to
be exposed to actual legal
work, transactions where
lawyers and people deal with
real problems. In law school,
you don't get a good idea of
what the practice of law can
involve," Carol Kersten, a
first-year law student volun
teer, said.
Crovitz said that the volun
teers find a release from the
pressures of law school by
working at the LCO. The work
gives them a diversion, yet a
"type of diversion that is still
in the area of law," he said. In
addition, some volunteers feel
refreshed after working at the
LCO.
Ironically perhaps, most of
the cases involve "common
sense solutions," according to
Crovitz. He said, "a lot of

times the advice is non-legal."
As an example, Crovitz said,
"There was this guy from the
East who was having problems
securing his trunk from a mov
ing van company. The guy had
gotten the trunk insured for
less than it was worth. It was in
the company's best interest to
just pay the student the insur
ance, $15, instead of trying to
locate it, but the student's
trunk was worth much more.
In talking with the student, dif
ferent legal remedies were
suggested and the secretary
overheard the conversation
and stated, 'No, that's not how
you should do it. You should
play up to the company with a
Mr. Nice Guy role rather than
making them mad at you.' "
The common sense approach
worked and the student re
gained his trunk, Crovitz said.
Dorsey said that sometimes
the "common sense ap
proach" was the only advice
necessary. But the student
lawyers agreed that sometimes

common sense solutions will
not solve aMegal problem. Par
ticularly in those cases, stu
dents are encouraged to con
sult the LCO. Crovitz stated
that there is a "certain strategy
to winning small claims court
cases" that the student should
be aware of before he goes to
court. He also said that stu
dents should consult the LCO
before attempting to solve
problems with common
sense. "Sometimes a legal rule
will apply and the people at
the LCO are experienced with
the legal aspects more than a
student's friend next door
who knows-nothing about
legal structures."
Despite the numerous de
mands law school places on
first-year law studlents, most
of the volunteers at the LOC
are first-year students here. In
addition to hours spent in
counseling sessions with pat
rons of the LCO facility, volun
teers also work on publicity
for the center. Volunteers talk

to students in dormitories
here, advertising the availabil
ity and services of LCO.
Rob Manning, a first-year
student aiding Crovitz in his
duties, helps administer the
volunteers. Manning
schedules the law students
into counseling session times
during the office's Tuesday
and Thursday afternoon
hours.
A series of seminars trains
law students how to advise.
The seminars, lead by lawyers,
explore the main subject areas
in which help is solicited from
the LCO.
So, what does a student do
who has received a phone bill
$400 higher than the charges
should have been? "Go and
file an action of implied con
tract, a breach of merchantibil
ity, and liquidate damages?"
asked the student. "Nope"
said the student lawyer. "Just
don't pay the bill."
