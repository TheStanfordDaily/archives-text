# Voters decide issues in 38 states
## 
### Associated Press 
Voters in 38 states spoke
their mind when they marked
their ballots: they don't want
school children bused, they
don't want gambling legalized,
they want the most vicious
criminals put to death. And
more.
Citizens of these states
voted on some 200 referenda,
constitutional amendments
and initiatives â€” issues that
ranged from whether they
would restrict construction of
nuclear power plants to
whether they would buy their
dentures from makers as well
as dentists.
Here is how key issues on
ballots around the country did
Tuesday:
Abortion: In Oregon, a mea
sure to prohibit using state
money to finance abortions
for women on welfare was
narrowly rejected, with 52
percent of voters opposing the
prohibition.
Busing: Massachusetts vot
ers, undeterred that their de
cision could not alter Boston's
federally-ordered busing
program, emphatically en
dorsed a prohibition on as
signing children to schools
based on race.
No racial assignments
With 25 percent of the vote
counted, they favored the
prohibition nearly three to
one.
In Washington state 67 per
cent of voters endorsed a
proposal intended to disman
tle Seattle's busing program.
The plan bars transferring
children to any but the nearest
school; its approval was ex
pected to provoke a court
challenge.
Crime: California voters ap
proved three to one a measure

to expand the list of crimes
punishable by death. Oregon
voters by a vote of two to one
favored a measure reinstating
the death penalty for certain
crimes.
Cay rights: Homosexuals
didn't make any gains in Dade
County, Fla., but they were
holding their ground in
California and Seattle.
In Dade County, nearly 60
percent voted down a local
gay rights provision like one
they repealed last year. Fifty
seven percent of California
voters opposed requiring
school boards to fire or refuse
to hire teachers who commit
or advocate homosexual acts.
Gay rights in Seattle
In Seattle, with 33 percent of
the vote tallied, an effort was
failing that would repeal a
local ban on housing and job
discrimination against
homosexuals.
Smoking: A plan that would
bar or restrict smoking in al
most every public place was
rejected by 55 percent of
California voters.
Bottles: Nearly 60 percent of
Nebraska voters said no to a

plan to impose a 5-cent de
posit on all beverage contain
ers. An Alaska proposal to im
pose a similar 10-cent deposit
was also failing in early tallies.
Nuclear power: Montana
voters approved by a wide
margin a measure imposing
such rigid restrictions on
building nuclear power plants
that its passage was consi
dered tantamount to a ban on
such projects.
Equal Rights Amendment: In
Florida, where the legislature
has refused to ratify the fed
eral ERA, voters resoundingly
rejected a state amendment.
Nevada fights ERA
The tide flowed against the
federal ERA in Nevada, where
voters were polled to "advise"
the state legisli vhich
also has not rati. u
Right-to-work: Musourians
rejected an angrily fought
right-to-work measure to out
law contracts that require
employees to join a union. In
Michigan, 56 percent of voters
accepted a plan to allow state
troopers to bargain collec
tively.
Gambling: Only Missourians
said yes to gambling: They ap

proved a wording change that
would permit them to take
part in games like the Readers'
Digest Sweepstakes.
But Virginia voters refused
to legalize pari-mutual betting
at horsetracks. New lerseyans
declined to legal sports bet
ting on jai alai and, in Florida,
voters refused to allow casino
gambling along Miami Beach.
Oregon dentists lose
Dentures: In Oregon, de
spite a $410,000 campaign by
the American Dental Associa
tion, a tooth-rattling 78 per
cent of the electorate ruled
that they should be able to
have their false teeth fitted by
denture makers instead of
only by dentists.
Health costs: A plan to drop
a lid atop health costs in North
Dakota died when 76 percent
of the voters rejected the
proposal. The measure would
have authorized the state
health officer to hold public
hearings, then set maximum
fees for all medical services.
The state medical profession
orchestrated an expensive
media campaign in opposition
to the proposal.
