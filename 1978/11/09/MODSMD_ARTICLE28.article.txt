Accomplices included
In addition, the new law
subjects murder ac
complices to the death

penalty even if they didn't
actually kill anyone.
Procedures: Under the
old law, if a jury convicted a
defendant of murder but
deadlocked on the penalty,
the defendant was automat
ically sentenced to life in
prison without possibility
of parole.
The new allows an unli
mited number of new juries
to be called until agree
ment is reached on a pen
alty.

law, non-capital first

seven years, with additional
time added for prior con
victions and use of a gun
and time subtracted for
good behavior in prison.
