## Jazz/ted gioia Kuhn, Gismonti; unique talents Steve Kuhn 
### 
Seldom have you or I heard
a musician as talented as Steve
Kuhn. Kuhn, like many jazz ar
tists, has achieved neither
great commercial success nor
great public esteem. In this
case the lack of commercial
markets for Kuhn is particu
larly upsetting. He is one of
the two or three best pianists
in jazz, yet he is still unable to

find the audience for a West
Coast tour, nor have his al
bums received anywhere near
the airplay or attention they
deserve.
I have found everything
Kuhn has recorded to be of
the highest quality. His early
albums on the Cobblestone
label (now out of print) are ex
citing and daring in a way few
jazz albums have been. His al
bums for the ECM label have
been increasingly better — his
solo album Ectasy, and his
group albums Motility and Tr
ance have been frequent
comparisons at my turntable.
Perhaps his best
After several hearings
Kuhn's latest album for ECM,
Non-Fiction, strikes me as
being perhaps his best. Kuhn
is joined by his working group

(or seldom working group,
one might say) which features
Steve Slagle on reeds, Harvie
Swartz on bass and Bob Moses
on drums. The album presents
a variety of Kuhn's moods,
from the swinging (on
"Firewalk") to the meditative
("A Dance With the Wind").
The most amazing aspect of
Kuhn's playing is his touch
control on the piano. His mas
tery of the soft muted hues
and the loud thunderous col
ors of the piano is unmatched
in jazz. One would have to go
to classical masters such as
Horowitz to find a similar tone
control. On his Ectasy album
Kuhn at one point brings an
amazingly full-toned and
thunderous explosion from
the piano. When playing softly
Kuhn has the ability to bring
the piano down to the
slightest whisper. He has a
control over the piano which
few jazz artists can match. The
uninitiated who measure
piano ability by speed alone
may be disappointed — Kuhn
never shows off his technique.
For him the flow and body of
the piece are of the greatest
importance.
Powerful
While Kuhn's contem
poraries (Keith Jarrett, Herbie
Hancock, Chick Corea,
McCoy Tyner among others)
have gained a sizeable follow
ing, Kuhn has yet to reach the
vast number of people he
could. This is deeply gripping,
powerful music. Kuhn is proof
enough, if proof were needed,
that acoustic jazz is as vibrant
and as important as it ever has
been.

persistent than any other label
in finding and developing new
talent. Gismonti, completely
unknown in the United States
before his ECM debut, is al
ready showing signs of becom
ing an important voice in the
jazz world.
His playing can hardly be
termed as jazz in any tradi
tional sense. His style is a
compendium of techniques
one would associate with clas
sical composers. When I hap
pened to hear the piece
"Baiao Malandro" on tfie radio
one day I immediately as
sumed that this was a compos
ition by some new avant-garde
classicist. When I learned that
the piece was improvised, I
was, needless to say, surprised
and impressed.
Equal fluency
Gismonti plays the piano
and guitar with equal fluency.
His playing is sparse and care
fully performed — like so
many ECM artists, Gismonti
prefers understatement to
verbosity. He has been fortu
nate in finding sensitive ac
companists for the recording:
from Oregon, one of the first
classically oriented- jazz
groups, Gismonti has bor
rowed Ralph Towner and Col
lin Walcott. |an Garbarek,

another ECM artist, also joins
Gismonti for a number.
Gismonti's music strikes me
as being extremely melodic,
but not in any conventional
sense. His melodies are his
very own and not the time one
would associate with Barry
Manilow or lames Taylor. The
music is deeply rooted in the
Brazilian atmosphere of Gis
monti's background. In a way
this is very fitting; jazz having
grown out of Afro-American
folk music seems one of the
perfect mediums to adapt the
folk music of other countries.
About half the musicians who
record for ECM are from
foreign countries, while the
label itself is situated in Ger
many. This import of different
musical cultures and perspec
tives can only prove to be be
neficial for jazz. The elitism
which states that only Ameri
cans can play jazz will have to
be forgotten.
When the German master
Friedrich Gulda brought his
trio here some 15 years ago he
was greeted with skepticism
and undeserved bad publicity.
Hopefully such misconcep
tions about jazz no longer
exist. If they do, artists such as
Egberto Gismonti will soon
disperse them for good.
