# Med students: dean's resignation 'sign of times'
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Although several medical students
said yesterday they were surprised
to hear that Dr. Clayton Rich has re
quested to resign as dean of the
medical school, many agreed that
the reorganization in administration
is "a sign of the times."
"Whenever there are fiscal prob
lems in a complex organization like
this medical school, shakeups in
administration are to be expected,"
commented jose Arevalo, a third
year student.
Rich's resignation, effective )an. 1,

-1979, was never formally announced
to the medical students. Many were
still learning of the dean's decision
at noon yesterday.
"I was really surprised this morn
ing, yet I found the move to be very
interesting," said Brenda Lewis, a
second-year student. "The school
definitely needs a new administra
tion and business manager."
Financial problems
The Medical School and Hospital
have been plagued by financial
problems recently, forcing adminis
trators to propose tuition hikes. This
rising cost of education plus

changes in traditional policies of the
school, have caused students to be
come "openly antagonistic" toward
the administration, Lewis said.
"The proposed changes in the
number of courses required, mod
ifications in minority admissions and
in admissions in general, plus a
change in emphasis of the basic sci
ences have all made students un
easy," she said.
"We have little say in the way this
school is administered," she added.
Student objection to the situa
tions at the school reached a peak
last Friday when one student re
ceived loud applause after accusing
the Medical School of having "seri
ous mismanagement" in its ad
ministration.
Student meeting
The comment was made by
fourth-year student Martin Cher
niack during a meeting between
Rich and 500 medical students.
"Rich really seemed submissive at
that meeting," Bonnie Maldonado
said. "If he wasn't agreeing to stu
dent comments directly, he was ag

reeing with silence. Looking back, I
can see what was on his mind."
Maldonado also said Rich has
been the "scapegoat" for problems
actually caused by Hospital and Uni
versity administrators.
Another student agreed the
change in administration was a good
move but added it came at an unfor
tunate time.
"The new dean can simply say
'I've inherited these problems and I
can't solve them right away,' " said
John Cervantes, a second-year stu
dent. "That way, there's nothing we
can do to vent our hostilities."
Several other third-year students
said they were not surprised by the
resignation because the move had
been predicted by some faculty
members.
Change philosophy
The new dean should place a high
priority on changing the school's
philosophy back to its traditional
policy, students said.
"Stanford is tending more to
wards the conservative teaching
methods," explained Corrie Ander
son, a third-year student. "There are

now evaluation letters and there's
even talk of bringing back grades,"
neither of which are in the school's
spirit of non-competition and indi
vidual research, he said.
Anderson also said he hopes the
new administration will "look to
wards hiring more minorities and
women faculty members."
Students also said they hoped the
new dean will be "more sociable"
than Rich.
"Rich was the kind of person
you'd see at orientation and then
never again," Maldonado said.
And the new administration must
"gear more towards society's
needs," said Joshua Prager. "This
Medical School is being run by a
strictly business point of view."
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, now a de
puty dean, will take over as acting
dean in January until a search com
mittee, yet to be formed, selects a
new administrator.
Rich said he plans a sabbatical in
Washington, D.C. and added he
hopes to work on issues of public
and institutional policy for academic
medicine.
