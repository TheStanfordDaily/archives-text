## Peninsula Ballet Theater uneven 
### 
Because Peninsula Ballet Theater is in a
state of transition, it's hard to know
exactly how to critique it. As shown by its
performance last Saturday night in San
Mateo, at the Performing Arts Center, PBT
is certainly not a student company, and
yet at some points, especially during the
first piece, it was not quite professional
either.
PBT encountered the most technical
problems with a version of Michael
Fokine's "Les Sylphides" reset for the
company by its artistic director, Anne
Bena, and Grace Doty. Performed to
music by Chopin, the ballet follows the
style and costuming of the Romantic
period in ballet, except that it is plotless.
Good effort
In general, PBT made a good effort, but
it still seemed somewhat overly ambitious
given the difficulty of the piece — setting
aside considerations of its period nature.
In a piece with much weight given tc dif
ferent groups and arrangements of the
corps, the dancers need to fully under
stand the soft-shouldered line of the
Romantic period. Additionally heavy land
ings from jumps broke the sylphlike ap
pearance of the flowingly-costumed
corps.
Continuing in the vein of the ballet
classic, the next piece was the "Peasant
Pas De Deux" from the ballet "Giselle,"

although this pas de deux is usually not
performed in productions of the ballet in
the United States. This was a lovely, fresh
piece danced by the company's first sol
oists Loretta Bartlett and Karstyn McCoy.
Individually each is a good, strong dancer
and together they make a very pleasant
combination. Perhaps due to McCoy's re
lative inexperience with partnering the
partnered turns were slightly off balance.
In "Les Sylphides" one of the high
points was the cleanness and balanced
nature of Rosine Bena's turns partnered
by Sam Weber. Given the overall quality
of the dancing, though, one imagines that
Bartlett and McCoy's turns just need
more time to achieve the clarity and
freshness of the rest of the dancing. Par
ticularly noticable in Bartlett was an excel
lent sense of timing and phrasing, as well
as a nice jump. McCoy's portrayal of a
strapping young peasant was amusing
without being overdone.
Best known
The next piece, the pas de deux from
the Fiesta Scene of the ballet "Don Quix
ote," is probably one of the best known
ballet pieces in the United States today
because of its inclusion in the movie, The
Turning Point, where it is danced by Leslie
Browne and Mikhail Barishnikov.
Last Saturday, Rosine Bena and Sam
Weber danced the leggiest version of it

that I have seen. Although Weber danced
well, this was definitely Bena's piece. She
used her extension to the fullest and
flashed her eyes almost too dramatically.
In the sequence of hops on points travel
ing downstage where she taps the floor
with her foot and twists the opposing
shoulder, Bena did not show off her good
ability to balance. She was quite secure,
but one wished that she would have taken
more of a risk in lifting her tapping foot
higher off the floor.
Contrast
By contrast the last piece on the prog
ram, "Paging Mr. Stair," was definitely
Weber's piece. This piece to a medley of
Gershwin, Porter, Yomans, Kern and Ber
lin, comes close to a production number
in its design, but Weber keeps it alive
without resorting to cheap flashiness. A
series of short vignettes of the different
types of show dancing from the '30s and
'40s composes the piece performed in tap
or plain heeled shoes.
Bena and Weber combined forces to
choreograph "Reflection," a pleasant
study about the time labeled "adoles
cence." Danced to Dvorak, it is the most
modern in style of any of the pieces of the
program. The dancers in general handled
the change in style well, but seemed not
to understand that a parallel position of
the legs requires as much strength and
control as a turned out one.

either.
PBT encountered the most technical
problems with a version of Michael
Fokine's "Les Sylphides" reset for the
company by its artistic director, Anne
Bena, and Grace Doty. Performed to
music by Chopin, the ballet follows the
style and costuming of the Romantic
period in ballet, except that it is plotless.
Good effort
In general, PBT made a good effort, but
it still seemed somewhat overly ambitious
given the difficulty of the piece — setting
aside considerations of its period nature.
In a piece with much weight given tc dif
ferent groups and arrangements of the
corps, the dancers need to fully under
stand the soft-shouldered line of the
Romantic period. Additionally heavy land
ings from jumps broke the sylphlike ap
pearance of the flowingly-costumed
corps.
Continuing in the vein of the ballet
classic, the next piece was the "Peasant
Pas De Deux" from the ballet "Giselle,"

although this pas de deux is usually not
performed in productions of the ballet in
the United States. This was a lovely, fresh
piece danced by the company's first sol
oists Loretta Bartlett and Karstyn McCoy.
Individually each is a good, strong dancer
and together they make a very pleasant
combination. Perhaps due to McCoy's re
lative inexperience with partnering the
partnered turns were slightly off balance.
In "Les Sylphides" one of the high
points was the cleanness and balanced
nature of Rosine Bena's turns partnered
by Sam Weber. Given the overall quality
of the dancing, though, one imagines that
Bartlett and McCoy's turns just need
more time to achieve the clarity and
freshness of the rest of the dancing. Par
ticularly noticable in Bartlett was an excel
lent sense of timing and phrasing, as well
as a nice jump. McCoy's portrayal of a
strapping young peasant was amusing
without being overdone.
Best known
The next piece, the pas de deux from
the Fiesta Scene of the ballet "Don Quix
ote," is probably one of the best known
ballet pieces in the United States today
because of its inclusion in the movie, The
Turning Point, where it is danced by Leslie
Browne and Mikhail Barishnikov.
Last Saturday, Rosine Bena and Sam
Weber danced the leggiest version of it

that I have seen. Although Weber danced
well, this was definitely Bena's piece. She
used her extension to the fullest and
flashed her eyes almost too dramatically.
In the sequence of hops on points travel
ing downstage where she taps the floor
with her foot and twists the opposing
shoulder, Bena did not show off her good
ability to balance. She was quite secure,
but one wished that she would have taken
more of a risk in lifting her tapping foot
higher off the floor.
Contrast
By contrast the last piece on the prog
ram, "Paging Mr. Stair," was definitely
Weber's piece. This piece to a medley of
Gershwin, Porter, Yomans, Kern and Ber
lin, comes close to a production number
in its design, but Weber keeps it alive
without resorting to cheap flashiness. A
series of short vignettes of the different
types of show dancing from the '30s and
'40s composes the piece performed in tap
or plain heeled shoes.
Bena and Weber combined forces to
choreograph "Reflection," a pleasant
study about the time labeled "adoles
cence." Danced to Dvorak, it is the most
modern in style of any of the pieces of the
program. The dancers in general handled
the change in style well, but seemed not
to understand that a parallel position of
the legs requires as much strength and
control as a turned out one.
Because Peninsula Ballet Theater is in a
state of transition, it's hard to know
exactly how to critique it. As shown by its
performance last Saturday night in San
Mateo, at the Performing Arts Center, PBT
is certainly not a student company, and
yet at some points, especially during the
first piece, it was not quite professional
either.
