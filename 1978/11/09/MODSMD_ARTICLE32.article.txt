## Tormato': a rebuttal 
### 
Tor ma to
Yes
Atlantic Records
(This article was written before the publica
tion of Dave Pearlman's review of Tormato
(Daily, 10/31). In response, I would point out
that his criticisms are shaped by his essential
unfamiliarity with Yes. Calling their music
"spacey," he says that their "writing ' (a term
which he neglects to define) is occasionally
weak, citing as an example an album which Yes
never made. Clearly the innovative musical and
lyrical complexity of Tormato simply over
whelms Pearlman. In a way this is not too
difficult to understand, especially vis a vis the
lyrics, most of which are written by bandleader
lon Anderson. The "problem," if it can be cal
led that, of Anderson's lyrics is that they're not
really written for popular consumption. Their
literary content, both intellectual and spiritual,
goes right over most listeners' heads. Anderson
admits as much in "Starship Trooper," a cut
from The Yes Album. Musically, Tormato's
tracks contain melodic structures slightly more
intricate than usual, but not at all too compli
cated or overdone, and certainly not unintellig
ible.)
Contrary to what L.A. Times pop critic Robert
Hilburn might think, Tormato proves that Yes
unquestionably has a sense of humor. Ander
son, Howe, Squire, White and Wakeman com
bine their usual instrumental and vocal perfec
tionism with a pleasant lightness of touch, re
sulting in their most "fun" and refreshing
album since the 1971 release of Fragile.
lust as last year's Going For The One LP bears
a structural and thematic resemblance to The
Yes Album (which was released in 1970 directly
prior to Fragile), so Tormato has a similar rela
tionship to Fragile. Fragile was characterized by
a carefree abandonment of The Yes Album's
structural rigidity, and by equal contributions
by all five musicians in the form of solo mate
rial. Similarly, Tormato retreats from Going For
The One's classical stance with a collection of
innovative, modernistic material characterized
by easily-identified influence by all five of the
band's members (as opposed to the usual pre
dominance of Anderson and Howe).
Wit
Yes' wit and light heartedness can be seen on
the album cover, as well as in the songs them
selves. The entire concept of "tormato," a
ludicrous amalgamation of "tornado" and "to
mato," is part of an overall stab at modern
"schlock" and punk rock. The well-dressed
gentleman and the British sea-coast scene on
the cover are visual references to a particular
episode of the old Avengers TV series. The dark
glasses and jackets, as well as the bits of
smashed tomato confirm the anti-punk theme.
This message is continued into the music, as
their single, "Release, Release," shows. Here
Yes outclasses and out-rocks the punk rockers
with their most powerful rocker since "Siberian
Khatru." Unfortunately, the song is slightly
tarnished by an irritating Squire-Howe duet in

the middle, which, however, almost redeems
itself by its brevity and an excellent end re
solve. "On the Silent Wings of Freedom," the
other big rocker on the alburr), though perhaps
not as rousing as "Release," is the closest thing
to a Yes "jam" since "The Fish."
Movement away
"Don't Kill the Whale" as well as the entire
Tormato concept represents a truly significant
advance for Anderson and Yes, namely a
movement away from an elite Castalian aes
theticism, toward an acceptance of contempor
ary social reality. In the past, Yes has been, and
with some merit, accused of aesthetic self
indulgence. "Don't Kill the Whale," a very
powerful number both musically and lyrically,
signifies a Ciceronian merging of the Vita activa
and the vita contemplativa. The result is one of
the most satisfying and nearly perfect of all the
songs in Yes' broad repertoire.
Anderson also has the contemporary social
scene in mind in "Arriving UFO," in which he
comments that there is a spiritual theme be
hind the present sci-fi craze (brought about by
Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third
King). Anderson, Wakeman,' and Howe beauti
fully combine their musical contributions in the
composition, and the band's final arrangement
leads to a truly memorable and extraordinary
piece.
Enjoyable
"Future Times/Rejoice," the only cut com
posed by all five band-members, has a little less
character than the other tracks, but is fairly
enjoyable nonetheless, and fits in well with the
overall ambience of the album.
Tormato also features two beautifully ar
ranged pastoral ballads, "Madrigal," co
composed by Anderson and Wakeman, and
"Onward," a Squire solo effort. The pleasant
simplicity of these pieces — particularly "Mad
rigal," with its combination of harpsichord and
Spanish guitar — counters the accusation that
Yes is too often over-electrified. Rather than
harshly and discordantly electric, these cuts are
especially serene and soothing.
Truly innovative
Finally there is "Circus of Heaven," a truly
innovative piece composed solely by Ander
son. Combining a pleasing melody with a com
plex lyrical style which might be called "lyrical
epic," Anderson symbolically unfolds the won
ders of his extraordinary vision. Anderson's lit
tle son Damion makes his recording debut in
the song by commenting that his Dad's "cir
cus" is "0.K.1," but that there are "no
clowns." Above all, Tormato proves decisively
that there are indeed clowns in Anderson's Cir
cus of Heaven, and in the Circus of Yes.
Taken song by song, or as a whole, Tormato
represents a bold and successful venture in in
novation. Yes has achieved a beautiful synth
esis of refreshing new themes, imaginative
musical compositions, and penetrating lyrics.
Completely enjoyable and satisfying, Tormato
reinforces Yes' position as the number one
progressive rock band of the 19705.
