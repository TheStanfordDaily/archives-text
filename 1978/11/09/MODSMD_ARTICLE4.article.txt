# 7 incumbents lose their Senate seats

### 
(AP) — Seven senators — five
Democrats and two Republicans —
lost their seats in mid-term elections
that whittled away at the Democrats
solid control of Congress and state
governments.
The final count from New Hamp
shire gave Republican Gordon
Humphrey a narrow victory over
Sen. Thomas Mcintyre, the Democ
ratic incumbent.
In Texas, Republican Sen. |ohn
Tower and his Democratic chal
lenger, Rep. Robert Krueger,
awaited the results of a long ballot
count that showed the lead chang
ing back and forth throughout the
night.
Humphrey, a pilot for Allegheny
Airlines, made Mclntyre's support
for a Panama Canal treaties a major
point in his campaign.
Discontent
Mirroring voter discontent with
economic conditions were ballot
proposals to limit taxes or put a lid
on spending in 16 states. Ten won
approval, four were defeated and
two were undecided.
Either tax or spending limits, some
of them not binding, won in
Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Il
linois, Massachusetts, Missouri,
Nevada, North Dakota and Texas
and lost in Arkansas, Colorado,
Nebraska and Oregon.
California Republicans, brandish
ing the crush-government club of
Proposition li, picked up seven
seats in the state Legislature for the
party's first statehouse gains this de
cade.
The gains make the Democratic
majority in the lower chamber 50-30,
cracking the present 57-23 edge that
made it impossible for Republicans
to affect veto overrides and money
bills requiring a two-thirds vote of
54.
In the Senate, incumbent Democ
ratic Sen. John Dunlap of Napa also
was defeated, but a vacant Republi

can seat was won by a Democrat, so
the party balance remains 26-14 in
the upper house.
The new GOP legislators who
used Proposition 13's anti
government sentiments to oust
Democratic incumbents are:
—James Nielson, 34, a Woodland
farm consultant, who beat Dunlap.
—Gerald Felando, 43, a Torrance
dentist, who knocked off 19-term
Assemblyman Vincent Thomas of
San Pedro.
—Dennis Brown, a Long Beach
businessman, who defeated Fred
Chel of Long Beach.
—Rober Hayes, 46, a San Fer
nando heating contractor, who hit
Jim Keysor of Sepulveda with the
double blows of Proposition 13 and
busing.
—William Filante, 49, a Greenbrae
ophthamologist and economist,
who won over Michael Wornum of
Mill Valley.
—Phillip Wyman, a Tehachapi
rancher, who beat Larry Chimbole
of Palmdale.
—David Kelley, 50, a Hemet
grapefruit grower, who defeated
Tom Suitt of Indian Wells.
But Democrats will retain com
manding majorities in both houses
of Congress and at the state gov
ernment level.
Voters in 38 states were asked to
decide some 200 issues, ranging
from school integration to capital
punishment to homosexual rights.
In Massachusetts, voters en
dorsed by a 3-1 margin a prohibition
against assigning children to schools
based on race and in Washington
state they were approving a prop
osal to dismantle Seattle's busing
program.
In California, they voted 3-to-1 for
a measure expanding the list of
crimes punishable by death and
Oregon voters favored reinstating
the death penalty for certain crimes
by a 2-1 margin.
