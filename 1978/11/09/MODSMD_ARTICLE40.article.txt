# Expert reveals research
## Chicana experience changing 
### KATHLEEN WHEATON 
"The Chicana's access to formal education falls way
behind the American norm, affecting her job status and
her mental health," Carmen Carillo told listeners at a
noon lecture yesterday.
Carillo, who directs the Mission Mental Health prog
ram in San Francisco, was recently appointed to the
Citizen's Advisory on Mental Health by Gov. Jerry
Brown. Carillo also has done extensive research on the
changing role of the Mexican-American woman.
Carillo said that the median education level for the
Chicana totals eight years, compared to twelve for the
average Anglo woman. "This has serious impact on her
opportunities for employment and advancement,'
Carillo said.
Nearly 42 percent of Chicanas are employed outside
the home, but more than halt of these have blue-collar
jobs, especially in textiles and domestic service. Of
non-Chicana working women, 68 percent hold white
collar jobs. Chicanas have an average annual income of
$2700, the lowest of any racial group, Carillo said.
Carillo attributes some of the Chicana's educational
handicap to cultural attitudes within the Chicano com
munity. "Despite changes in ideology and family struc
ture, there exists an extreme sex-role difference which
emphasizes male superiority," Carillo said. "Neverthe
less, the sex-role stereotypes do not always hold true in
practice."
Self-sacrifice
Traditional studies have hold that the Chicano family
stiucture is based upon the "unquestioned supremacy
of the husband-father, and the absolute self-sacrifice of
the wife-mother," according to Carillo.
"But behavior is not always consistent with the ideal,
Carillo said. "Empirical studies have shown that women
often have a powerful role within the family.''
As a result of political consciousness-raising in the
late '60s, many Chicanas now have lifestyles that are (ar

from traditional, especially in a university setting,
Carillo said. "But these women still describe their ideal
family structure as authoritarian," she noted. "There is
a real conflict between the way they live and what they
believe is right."
Machismo-martyr
This conflict is sometimes manifested through mental
illness. Many psychiatric hosptial admissions of
Chicanos are sex-role related, according to Carillo.
"The machismo-martyr syndrome takes on a pathologi
cal aspect," she said. "Men exhibit exaggerated aggres
sive behaviors such as fighting and paranoid delusions.
Women become passive to the point of being
catatonic."
The sex-role conflict, coupled with the impact of
poverty, creates overwhelming stress for Chicanas. But
access to mental health services is difficult for them. A
deep-seated belief in the extended family as a source of
support keeps Chicanos from seeking institutionalized
help, according to Carillo.
"Traditionally, there were aunts and grandmothers to
give women the education and support they needed.
Now most Chicanos do not live in an extended family
situation, but they may look at public mental health
systems as cold and alien," Carillo said.
Carillo said that many Chicanas experience difficulty
when they marry. "They hold the ideal of the male
authority figure, but they still want someone who will
wash the dishes and support their careers."
The divorce rate among Chicanos is rising, and self
help groups address education and employment prob
lems among Chicanas who are single parents.
The Chicano political movement of the '60s had its
impact on women as well, according to Carillo. "We are
getting closer to a cultural synthesis. We have more
positive role models."
The lecture was part of a CROW-sponsored weekly
series entitled "women, men and stress in the work
place."

ram in San Francisco, was recently appointed to the
Citizen's Advisory on Mental Health by Gov. Jerry
Brown. Carillo also has done extensive research on the
changing role of the Mexican-American woman.
Carillo said that the median education level for the
Chicana totals eight years, compared to twelve for the
average Anglo woman. "This has serious impact on her
opportunities for employment and advancement,'
Carillo said.
Nearly 42 percent of Chicanas are employed outside
the home, but more than halt of these have blue-collar
jobs, especially in textiles and domestic service. Of
non-Chicana working women, 68 percent hold white
collar jobs. Chicanas have an average annual income of
$2700, the lowest of any racial group, Carillo said.
Carillo attributes some of the Chicana's educational
handicap to cultural attitudes within the Chicano com
munity. "Despite changes in ideology and family struc
ture, there exists an extreme sex-role difference which
emphasizes male superiority," Carillo said. "Neverthe
less, the sex-role stereotypes do not always hold true in
practice."
Self-sacrifice
Traditional studies have hold that the Chicano family
stiucture is based upon the "unquestioned supremacy
of the husband-father, and the absolute self-sacrifice of
the wife-mother," according to Carillo.
"But behavior is not always consistent with the ideal,
Carillo said. "Empirical studies have shown that women
often have a powerful role within the family.''
As a result of political consciousness-raising in the
late '60s, many Chicanas now have lifestyles that are (ar

from traditional, especially in a university setting,
Carillo said. "But these women still describe their ideal
family structure as authoritarian," she noted. "There is
a real conflict between the way they live and what they
believe is right."
Machismo-martyr
This conflict is sometimes manifested through mental
illness. Many psychiatric hosptial admissions of
Chicanos are sex-role related, according to Carillo.
"The machismo-martyr syndrome takes on a pathologi
cal aspect," she said. "Men exhibit exaggerated aggres
sive behaviors such as fighting and paranoid delusions.
Women become passive to the point of being
catatonic."
The sex-role conflict, coupled with the impact of
poverty, creates overwhelming stress for Chicanas. But
access to mental health services is difficult for them. A
deep-seated belief in the extended family as a source of
support keeps Chicanos from seeking institutionalized
help, according to Carillo.
"Traditionally, there were aunts and grandmothers to
give women the education and support they needed.
Now most Chicanos do not live in an extended family
situation, but they may look at public mental health
systems as cold and alien," Carillo said.
Carillo said that many Chicanas experience difficulty
when they marry. "They hold the ideal of the male
authority figure, but they still want someone who will
wash the dishes and support their careers."
The divorce rate among Chicanos is rising, and self
help groups address education and employment prob
lems among Chicanas who are single parents.
The Chicano political movement of the '60s had its
impact on women as well, according to Carillo. "We are
getting closer to a cultural synthesis. We have more
positive role models."
The lecture was part of a CROW-sponsored weekly
series entitled "women, men and stress in the work
place."
"The Chicana's access to formal education falls way
behind the American norm, affecting her job status and
her mental health," Carmen Carillo told listeners at a
noon lecture yesterday.
