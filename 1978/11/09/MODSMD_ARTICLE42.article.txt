Iranian ex-prime minister arrested
Tehran, Iran — The Iranian military put on a show of
force Wednesday and martial law authorities arrested
an ex-prime minister in a campaign to discourage op
position to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
An expected anti-government demonstration in the
Tehran bazaar failed to materialize.
The arrested former prime minister, Amir Abass
Hoveyda, headed the Cabinet for 13 years until he was
dismissed Aug. 6, 1977. He is one of dozens of former
officials arrested in recent days to defuse opposition
claims that the government tolerates corruption and
abuse of authority. ,
The opposition to the shah is spearheaded by Mos
lem traditionalists who demand an end to the shah's
Westernizing reforms which they say contradict the
teachings of the Koran. Political activists, striking oil
refinery workers and others want an end to martial law
and other concessions.
Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emami quit in the face of
renewed rioting Sunday after little more than two
months in office. He was replaced by Iran's chief of
staff, Gen. Gholam Reza Azhari, whose military police
are still seeking to arrest 17 other former top officials.
Charges against the wanted men range from corrup
tion to misuse of power and authority but initial indica
tions are that the arrests that have already taken place
and the warrants would do little to stem the swirling
opposition to the shah.

Iranian ex-prime minister arrested
Tehran, Iran — The Iranian military put on a show of
force Wednesday and martial law authorities arrested
an ex-prime minister in a campaign to discourage op
position to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
An expected anti-government demonstration in the
Tehran bazaar failed to materialize.
The arrested former prime minister, Amir Abass
Hoveyda, headed the Cabinet for 13 years until he was
dismissed Aug. 6, 1977. He is one of dozens of former
officials arrested in recent days to defuse opposition
claims that the government tolerates corruption and
abuse of authority. ,
The opposition to the shah is spearheaded by Mos
lem traditionalists who demand an end to the shah's
Westernizing reforms which they say contradict the
teachings of the Koran. Political activists, striking oil
refinery workers and others want an end to martial law
and other concessions.
Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emami quit in the face of
renewed rioting Sunday after little more than two
months in office. He was replaced by Iran's chief of
staff, Gen. Gholam Reza Azhari, whose military police
are still seeking to arrest 17 other former top officials.
Charges against the wanted men range from corrup
tion to misuse of power and authority but initial indica
tions are that the arrests that have already taken place
and the warrants would do little to stem the swirling
opposition to the shah.

Iranian ex-prime minister arrested
Tehran, Iran — The Iranian military put on a show of
force Wednesday and martial law authorities arrested
an ex-prime minister in a campaign to discourage op
position to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
An expected anti-government demonstration in the
Tehran bazaar failed to materialize.
The arrested former prime minister, Amir Abass
Hoveyda, headed the Cabinet for 13 years until he was
dismissed Aug. 6, 1977. He is one of dozens of former
officials arrested in recent days to defuse opposition
claims that the government tolerates corruption and
abuse of authority. ,
The opposition to the shah is spearheaded by Mos
lem traditionalists who demand an end to the shah's
Westernizing reforms which they say contradict the
teachings of the Koran. Political activists, striking oil
refinery workers and others want an end to martial law
and other concessions.
Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emami quit in the face of
renewed rioting Sunday after little more than two
months in office. He was replaced by Iran's chief of
staff, Gen. Gholam Reza Azhari, whose military police
are still seeking to arrest 17 other former top officials.
Charges against the wanted men range from corrup
tion to misuse of power and authority but initial indica
tions are that the arrests that have already taken place
and the warrants would do little to stem the swirling
opposition to the shah.

comrades and his body was found in the car the ter
rorists used to flee from the scene, police said.

in their hurry to make a getaway.
He was identified by police as Roberto Capone, 24, a
former sociology student. Police said Capone had links
with several leftists groups.
