Brother Crowfoot, why the tears?
You've been a brave man for many
years.
Why the sadness; why the sorrow?
Maybe there'll be a better tomorrow.
—Ballad of Crowfoot
Voices from the Earth, a com
munications group of native Ameri
cans, visited campus yesterday in an
effort to promote an understanding
of their goals and values. A basic
ingredient of the evening was the
"social dance," a time set aside for
talk and dancing.
The evening opened on a serious
note with a film documenting the
struggles of the native American
since the arrival of the white man on
the North American continent. From
there, it progressed into a group
participatory time of dancing and
singing.
The audience of nearly 30 ap
peared ill-at-ease initially, but most
joined in the dancing moving
through the basic steps to the re
gimented beat of a water drum.
Environmental danger
A major concern of Voices from
the Earth is the serious environmen
tal danger which members said a
large portion of native Americans
face.
Many reservations are located in
remote areas of the continent, and
the peoples living there are depen
dent on the natural resources of the

area.
The group also presented a slide
show entitled "A Frog and the
Pond" which pointed to the case of
the Cree Indians in Canada, who are
suffering from an elimination of
their main food source, fish, be
cause of extensive mercury and
chemical poisoning of surrounding
water.
Mike Meyer, coordinator of the
group and associate editor of Ak
wesasne Notes, a publication of the
Mohawk nation in Rooseveft, New
York, remarked that "Indians are the
first victims of pollution for two
reasons; A, nobody cares about the
Indians; and B, they are so far out
that no one realizes what is happen
ing" .
'Real problems'
Group member John Mohawk
outlined the purpose of Akwesasne
Notes, which he said is "to focus
people's attentions on real prob
lems in Indian country, which are
not limited to Indians."
According to Mohawk, the same
problems are evident "in the South
and the Appalachians, but nobody
seems to care enough to focus on
them."
By studying the history of the na
tive American, perhaps "we can
offer a viable alternative to the
non-native," and pose solutions to
the environmental questions which

face c.'l Americans, Mohawk said.
Also during the evening Mohawk
told the story of the Alligator dance.
Originating in the Seminole tribe,
the Alligator dance relates the tale of
a pair of the great amphibians as
they stroll the banks of a mighty
river. As they walk, arm-in-arm, they
must continuously peer over their
shoulders to ensure that there are
no Seminole warriors lurking in the
bushes. According to Mohawh,
Seminole warriors were very fond of
leaping upon unsuspecting al
ligators for a casual bout of wrestl
ing.
The group was originally known as
"White Roots of Peace," but later
changed its name to the present
one. Although there are several
groups operating under the name
White Roots, Voices From the Earth
is the original group sanctioned by
the Mohawk tribe.

area.
The group also presented a slide
show entitled "A Frog and the
Pond" which pointed to the case of
the Cree Indians in Canada, who are
suffering from an elimination of
their main food source, fish, be
cause of extensive mercury and
chemical poisoning of surrounding
water.
Mike Meyer, coordinator of the
group and associate editor of Ak
wesasne Notes, a publication of the
Mohawk nation in Rooseveft, New
York, remarked that "Indians are the
first victims of pollution for two
reasons; A, nobody cares about the
Indians; and B, they are so far out
that no one realizes what is happen
ing" .
'Real problems'
Group member John Mohawk
outlined the purpose of Akwesasne
Notes, which he said is "to focus
people's attentions on real prob
lems in Indian country, which are
not limited to Indians."
According to Mohawk, the same
problems are evident "in the South
and the Appalachians, but nobody
seems to care enough to focus on
them."
By studying the history of the na
tive American, perhaps "we can
offer a viable alternative to the
non-native," and pose solutions to
the environmental questions which

face c.'l Americans, Mohawk said.
Also during the evening Mohawk
told the story of the Alligator dance.
Originating in the Seminole tribe,
the Alligator dance relates the tale of
a pair of the great amphibians as
they stroll the banks of a mighty
river. As they walk, arm-in-arm, they
must continuously peer over their
shoulders to ensure that there are
no Seminole warriors lurking in the
bushes. According to Mohawh,
Seminole warriors were very fond of
leaping upon unsuspecting al
ligators for a casual bout of wrestl
ing.
The group was originally known as
"White Roots of Peace," but later
changed its name to the present
one. Although there are several
groups operating under the name
White Roots, Voices From the Earth
is the original group sanctioned by
the Mohawk tribe.
Brother Crowfoot, why the tears?
You've been a brave man for many
years.
Why the sadness; why the sorrow?
Maybe there'll be a better tomorrow.

Voices from the Earth, a com
munications group of native Ameri
cans, visited campus yesterday in an
effort to promote an understanding
of their goals and values. A basic
ingredient of the evening was the
"social dance," a time set aside for
talk and dancing.
The evening opened on a serious
note with a film documenting the
struggles of the native American
since the arrival of the white man on
the North American continent. From
there, it progressed into a group
participatory time of dancing and
singing.
The audience of nearly 30 ap
peared ill-at-ease initially, but most
joined in the dancing moving
through the basic steps to the re
gimented beat of a water drum.
Environmental danger
A major concern of Voices from
the Earth is the serious environmen
tal danger which members said a
large portion of native Americans
face.
Many reservations are located in
remote areas of the continent, and
the peoples living there are depen
dent on the natural resources of the

area.
