# People 'recycled like beer cans,' says reincarnation believer
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
In an all-day conference on reincarnation
held here last weekend, clinical
psychologist Helen Wambach described a
tew of the more than 1000 past lives that she
said she has experienced using hypnotic
regression. She said she has concluded that
in general, humans are "all recycled, like
aluminum beer cans."
The conference was sponsored by the
Tresidder Program Board, and featured, in
addition to Wambach, three other speakers
on life-after-life survival and reincarnation
phenomena.
Wambach prophesied that the 1980 s will
be a decade of the psyche and a reunion
with "the primitive peoples w considered
savages."
Children, according to Wambach, are
born with an innate serse of past identity,
and the process of ma'uring is the process
of forgetting these past life experiences.
Wambach said -.he discovered that most
victims of near death incidents expressed a

type of relief upon release from the physical
limitations of the body. "It is more natural
to be outside a body than inside," she con
cluded.
Session with Buchanan
Wambach claimed she has had hypnotic
regression sessions with such luminaries as
former President James Buchanan. These
experiences serve as Wambach's basis for a
hypothesis on brain functions. The right
side of the brain controls telepathy and op
erates beyond the world of space and time
while the left brain deals with the verbaliza
tion of thoughts, she said.
Wambach said she believes that the
world is evolving to encircle a creed of East
ern religions mingled with Western physics
and will thus transcend modern frames of
reference.
Parapsychologist Nick Noccrina, director
of the Institute of Psychic and Hypnotic Sci
ence, presented a slide display of his
photographic work on haunted houses.
Noccrina said his surrealistic slides
showed the existence of telekinetic energy,

which is sensed by the mind but not seen
by the human eye. Using as
the renowned Winchester Mystery House
in San jose, Noccrina attempted to prove
that houses have their own memories and
spirits. A "haunted" house is activated by a
person with a particular energy level, he
said.
Research teams
Noccrina's non-profit organization sends
research teams to such energy abodes to
photograph electron build-ups on film, in
the interest of "helping people solve their
problems."
Noccrina claimed that "when we die,
whether we like it or not, we leave a lot of
ourselves behind."
Another speaker, Charles Tart, professor
of psychology at UC-Davis, gave a lecture
entitled "The Scientific Approach to the in
vestigation of Soul Survival."
Conflicts
Tart focused upon the conflicts between
science, which "says that some of our most
profound experiences are illusory," and the

psychological belief in an eternal soul. He
listed some new seance and medium
provoked techniques as methods of deter
mining the possibility of life after death.
"I am also amazed that science has ig
nored the survival process," Tart said. He
explained that today only a dozen parap
sychological researchers are found in the
United States and Western Europe, and, of
these, only two or three are actually com
mitted to survival experimentation. He
added that "as a culture, we are insane not
to research this important question."
Tart's question, "If I am convinced that
there is no survival after death . . . how can
I care about posterity?" led to the next
panelist, Gina Cerminara, and her discus
sion on the social implications of reincarna
tion and karma.
Action
Karma, according to Cerminara, is a
Sanekrit word meaning action and can be
interpreted as an application of Newton's
law: every action has an equal and opposite
reaction.

She said that reincarnation implies the
concept that "once human, one will remain
human and keep returning until gradua
tion" to a oneness with nature. Also, karma
is a rebounding process containing both
negative and positive consequences.
Cerminara pointed to her two major so
cial interests in relation to karma and its
"boomerang continuity": racial prejudice
and the treatment of animals raised ex
pressly as food sources.
Cerminara said that, "we realize that we
have or will be in all racial groups."
Thus, bigoted actions by someone in one
life could be "paid back" in another life,
when the bigot found himself a member of
a minority group.
Citing inhumane developments in the
poultry, pork and veal industries, Cermi
nara proclaimed that "we contribute by our
silence to the perpetration of a systematic
form of cruelty." She quoted an early re
searcher as having said, "You will enter
heaven on the arm of someone you have
helped."
