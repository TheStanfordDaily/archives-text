# Clocks, toy trains, houses built by sheet metal worker here

### PAT FALCONER 
In these modern times, it's
rare to find someone who is a
"jack of all trades," someone
who seems able to make just
about anything with his hands.
But many here have said that
Paul Mezzapelle is just such a
man.
Mezzapelle, a sheet metal
worker here since 1961, is a

rare phenomenon. He designs
buildings and renovates every
thing from houses to clocks.
He makes metal constructions
such as rain gutters and vents
for the University and com
pletes metal sculptures too.
At 62, Mezzapelle still can't
get done all the projects he
wishes to make. "If I worked
40 hours a week in the wood

shop I still don't think I'd have
enough time to do what I want
to do," he said.
As cost estimator, coor
dinator and fabricator of sheet
metal projects at the Universi
ty's Service Operations office,
Mezzapelle said he sees more
than his fill of metal each
week. So he spends weekends
in his self-made home wood

shop.
Mezzapelle said he likes the
numerous colors and textures
of different woods. His ap
preciation is apparent in the
clocks he has bulilt over the
past years.
He uses woods from many
unique places; he uses dis
carded oak pallets from the
Service Operations yard, old
surplus furniture and spe
cialty woods like cherry and
black walnut from Alabama
and Arkansas.
Mezzapelle said he's made
from 50 to 60 clocks and 11
more are under construction
now. He has built seven
grandfather clocks. The 13
clocks in Mezapelle's sitting
room chime one after the
other on the hour.
Clocks are not all that Mez
zapelle makes at home. He's
built desks and tables, a com
plete camper and many toy
trains. Mezzapelle also
specializes in repairing an
tique furniture. He molds
parts that duplicate the pat
terns of the furniture from the
period in which each piece
was originally made.
"He's a master craftsman,"
said his wife, Doris. "He's one
of those people who can look
at a piece of wood and see
what can come out of it."
Good carpenters are the
ones who have a natural talent
for good work, Mezzapelle

said. "You can give two
people a piece of wood and a
yardstick. One won't cut it
straight, the other will. I'm a
natural," he continued.
Mezzapelle was approxi
mately eight years old when
he discovered his talent for
wood working. He built
clubhouses, ladders and furni
ture as a youngster. While at
the College of San Mateo in
1938, he worked as a sheet
metal apprentice. As he liked
the work Mezzapelle estab
lished his own sheet metal
business following World War
11.
In the '50s, Mezzapelle and
his wife purchased property,
built a house there and instal
led everything except the
plumbing and brickwork.
Mezzapelle has also built an
industrial building and an
apartment house in Palo Alto.
When Mezzapelle tires of
wood working he turns to
cooking. His Italian mother
taught him to make gourmet
Italian dishes, which Mez
zapelle cooks expertly, his
wife said. He's also well
known here for his cooking at
department barbecues and for
his secret sauces and season
ings. Mezzapelle also picks
the olive branches along
Campus Drive, then pickles
them at home.
Mezzapelle admitted he
does some metal work at

home. Comical cats, wind
chimes, a fire pit and a
wrought iron fence and gate
are some of the projects he's
completed.
But despite his numerous
accomplishments, Mezzapelle
is modest about his work. "I m
a jack of all trades and master
of none," he said. "Ol many,"
his wife corrected.
He intends to remain a
craftsman for a long time. "I
asked myself, what would I do
in retirement? I'm doing what I
like to do best now." He has
several projects in mind, such
as making a rolltop desk or a
miniature spinning wheel. He
doesn't know how long he'll

continue working here, but
after he retires Mezzapelle
said he'll have a part-time bus
iness.
"But if I go at this rate, I'll
give everything away," he
said. Most of Mezzapelle's
projects are given to others as
gifts.
In any event, Mezzapelle
will stick to his working
philosophy of life, "Keep busy
and you won't have enough
time to think that you're get
ting old. I guess I'm overactive
01 something. I can't sit down
in a rocking chair. I'd get old
pretty fast that way. I like to
keep my hand in."


A sampling of Paul Mezzapelle's talents, these clocks are all home-built. All of the wooden parts are
formed by Mezzapelle; the mechanisms are imported and the final products are heirloom-quality
timepieces.

With his power tools, Paul Mezzapelle is able to mill his own wood
from diverse origins, including hulk orders of cherry and black
walnut from the East and scrap wooden pallets from the University.
