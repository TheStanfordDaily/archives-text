# Studies of abused, neglected children
## Boys Town gets new headquarters 
### FRAN MILLER 
Five years/ago Stanford was selected as
the te for £ new Boys Town Center for
the >tudy of Youth Development. The
center was one of three established with
unused funds from the original center
founded by Father Flannagan in Omaha,
Nebraska.
Since that time Boys Town has been
housed temporarily in small trailer-type
quarters on campus.
Recently, faculty from the nine depart
ments who will head the program pre
viewed the center's new facilities. A per
manent location for the center has been
made possible by a gift that helped re
build the 80-year old Margaret-)acks Hall
in the Quad.
A formal dedication is planned for the
official opening of the new building in
mid-March.
Research on children
According to Albert Hastorf, professor
psychology and human biology, and ci
rector of the Boys Town Center here, a
contract with the University's Board if
Trustees granted money for research foia
25 year period. In return, the University
agreed to conduct research on the impa;t

of neglect, abuse and deprivation on
children with genetic defects, who are
economically deprived.
The Boys Town staff is composed of
people who "share interest and concern
for these sorts of problems," explained
Hastorf. There are 12 full-time faculty
members and 15 research fellows.
The center's staff members already are
faculty here, and represent nine different
departments: anthropology, economics,
education, human biology, law, pediat
rics, psychiatry, psychology, and sociol
ogy. Staff from the University law and
medical schools are included also.
Annual report
According to the Center's 1976-77 an
nual report, this multi-disciplinary re
search center "is dedicated to the search
for any knowledge that can be used ulti
mately for the benefit of youth to ensure
that they may have healthy, happy, and
productive lives, both in childhood and
adulthood."
Some of the Center's planned projects
include a study of the impact of foster
care on children, and the effects of day
care for young children on mother-child
relationships.

Hastorf commented that faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students all
will participate in the latter project. The
researchers will analyze the development
of children before, during and after they
have been placed in day care settings.
Hastorf now is involved in research de
aling with the physically handicapped. In
trigued by the idea of a "youth policy
oriented research center," he became di
rector of Boys Town in 1975. Hastorf said
he thinks Stanford was selected as the site
for a new center because of its reputation
as a prestigious research university.
The other centers, offshoots of the orig
inal one, were established at the Catholic
University in Washington,. D.C. and at
Creighton University in Omaha. At these
centers, studies are performed on cogni
tive development in youth, and com
munication disorders in children.
The new building facilities for Boys
Town will be shared by the Department of
Computer Sciences. Structurally, the
building will combine the traditional Uni
versity Spanish-style exterior with a mod
ernized interior, including an additional
floor and a section of one-way mirrors to
aid in research.

headquarters here puts finishing touches to the building, which will
be shared by the Computer Science Department. Wismann has
