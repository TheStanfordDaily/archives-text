# Claims victory for independent judiciary
## Bird survives controversy 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Chief Jus
tice Rose Bird said yesterday
her slim victory to retain her
seat on the California Sup
reme Court repudiated politi
cial interferences in the state's
judiciary.
"Their decision makes it
clear that they do not want a
judge to make decisions based
on threats of defeat at the
polls or on the fact that hun
dreds of thousands of dollars
wiil be spent to unseat you if
you don't kneel/' she said.
Bird, 42, has been under fire
from conservatives since Gov.
jerry Brown appointed her to
the court in February 1977. Her
critics assailed her as too lib
eral, lax on crime and unqual
ified for the post.
Nearly complete unofficial
returns indicated Bird was fa
vored by 51.7 percent of the
voters while 48.2 percent
wanted her removed from the
bench
Serious challenge
The first woman ever named
to the high court, she was the
target of the first serious chal
lenge to a sitting justice since
the voter confirmation process
was created a half century ago.
She will complete the re
maining eight years of retired
Chief Justice Donald Wright's
term.
Bird, in a statement released
by her San Francisco office,
thanked the voters and "all
those wonderful people who
stood by me during this most
difficult period of my profes
sional life."
Three associate justices on
Tuesday's ballot were not sub
jected to the fierce opposition
Bird faced and won confirma
tion handily.
They were Wiley Manuel,
the first black appointed to the
court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and
Frank Richardson, a conserva
tive named by former Gov.
Ronald Reagan. Manuel and
Newman were Brown appoin
tees.
State Sen. H.L. Richardson
(R-Arcadia) who had spear
headed the drive to oust Bird,
claimed a moral victory of
sorts. "It's called the attention
to the fact that the people can

bring about a sizeable
campaign against someone on
the bench," he said.
Farmers were opposed
A separate group consisting
primarily of farmers also op
posed Bird. They were
angered by her role in the 1975
farm labor bill while she was a
member of Brown's cabinet.
She refused to campaign for
election and returned all con
tributions. Lawyers rallied to
her side, arguing that the chal
lenge against her threatened
the concept of an indepen
dent judiciary.
In her few public com
ments, Bird alluded to "special
interests" who she contended
were against her.
A major controversy"
erupted on election day when
the Los Angeles Times pub
lished a story quoting uniden
tified sources as saying the
court was holding back until
after the election a ruling
which overturned a 1975 law

requiring a prison sentence
for using a gun in the commis
sion of a violent act.
The report said Bird had
voted with the 4-3 majority.
Denied report
She issued a statement an
grily denying the report, say
ing, "There are no completed
cases before this court where
release has been delayed for
political reasons or for any
other reasons extraneous to
the decision-making process."
She added, "It's a curious
coincidence that this story ap
pears on the morning of the
day when the voters are going
to the polls."
A legal newspaper, the Los
Angeles Daily Journal, pub
lished a report in today's edi
tions quoting two unidentified
Supreme Court justices as
confirming the Times' account

sensitive decisions.

She refused to campaign for
election and returned all con

court was holding back until

voted with the 4-3 majority.
Denied report
She issued a statement an
grily denying the report, say
ing, "There are no completed
cases before this court where
release has been delayed for

coincidence that this story ap

A legal newspaper, the Los
Angeles Daily Journal, pub
lished a report in today's edi
tions quoting two unidentified
Supreme Court justices as
confirming the Times' account
and asserting the court was sit
ting on at least six politically
sensitive decisions.
Los Angeles (AP) — Chief Jus
tice Rose Bird said yesterday
her slim victory to retain her
seat on the California Sup
reme Court repudiated politi
cial interferences in the state's
judiciary.
"Their decision makes it
clear that they do not want a
judge to make decisions based
on threats of defeat at the
polls or on the fact that hun
dreds of thousands of dollars
wiil be spent to unseat you if
you don't kneel/' she said.
Bird, 42, has been under fire
from conservatives since Gov.
jerry Brown appointed her to
the court in February 1977. Her
critics assailed her as too lib
eral, lax on crime and unqual
ified for the post.
Nearly complete unofficial
returns indicated Bird was fa
vored by 51.7 percent of the
voters while 48.2 percent
wanted her removed from the
bench
Serious challenge
The first woman ever named
to the high court, she was the
target of the first serious chal
lenge to a sitting justice since
the voter confirmation process
was created a half century ago.
She will complete the re
maining eight years of retired
Chief Justice Donald Wright's
term.
Bird, in a statement released
by her San Francisco office,
thanked the voters and "all
those wonderful people who
stood by me during this most
difficult period of my profes
sional life."
Three associate justices on
Tuesday's ballot were not sub
jected to the fierce opposition
Bird faced and won confirma
tion handily.
They were Wiley Manuel,
the first black appointed to the
court, Frank Newman, a liberal
former law professor, and
Frank Richardson, a conserva
tive named by former Gov.
Ronald Reagan. Manuel and
Newman were Brown appoin
tees.
State Sen. H.L. Richardson
(R-Arcadia) who had spear
headed the drive to oust Bird,
claimed a moral victory of
sorts. "It's called the attention
to the fact that the people can

bring about a sizeable
campaign against someone on
the bench," he said.
Farmers were opposed
A separate group consisting
primarily of farmers also op
posed Bird. They were
angered by her role in the 1975
farm labor bill while she was a

election and returned all con
