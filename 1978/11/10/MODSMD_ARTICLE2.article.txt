# Stanford, Cal square off in Big Game
## First of two contests beween aquatic rivals 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
One might be tempted to
call it the "Big Splash," but
"splash" is much too tame a
word to describe the tradi
tional battle between Stan
ford's and Cal's top-ranked
water polo teams.
This year's contests, espe
cially today's 3 p.m game at
deGuerre pool, should be par
ticularly exciting because the
Golden Bears are fighting to
stay in contention for a berth
in the NCAA championships,
held Nov. 25-26 in Long Beach.
The No. 1 ranked Cards, by
virtue of their victory over
USC last week, have already
clinched at least a second
place finish in the Pacific-10
a distinction which automati
cally qualifies them for the na
tional championships.
Cal, however, has lost two
games out of three to the
third-place Trojans and should
Stanford win both this week's
and next week's games against
the Bears, both Cal and USC
would have three losses in
conference play, and the na
tonals bid might well go to the
Trojans.
Cal coach Pete Cutino said
he hopes at least to split the
upcoming two games with the
Cards in order to get the edge
on USC for the NCAA berth. If
that happens, the liklihood is
very good that the Bears and
the Cards will meet yet
another time this year, with
the winner of that game walk
ing away with the NCAA title.
The possibility of facing Cal
three times in three weeks
prompted Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti to de
emphasize somewhat the im

portance of today's match.
"It's not a do-or-die situa
tion," Dettamanti said. "We'd
like to beat them and keep our
undefeated record. And we'd
like to win the league. But you
want to save some emotion for
the third game because that's
for the national champion
ship.
"We're still going to go all
out in the game, but there's a
mental thing to consider," he
added.
Dettamanti said he feels the
game is going to be a physical
one. Not the USC take-a
swing-at-your-head type of
game, but as Dettamanti said,
"They play a pressing, man
to-man defense and put a lot
of pressure on you. They are
very physical foulers."
The Berkeley defense cen
ters around Carlos Steffens.
He's a "specialist," to use De
ttamanti's word, who is usually
found defending against the
opposing team's hole man.
And speaking of hole men,
Cal throws a fifth year grad
student named Mike Loughlin
at their opponents.
Loughlin, who was picked
first team all-NCAA tourna
ment last year, scored four
goals against the Cards in a
10-10 tie earlier this year.
Three of the four came on
quick tap-ins from the post on
man-up situations for the
Bears.
The sparkplug of Cal's of
fense, however, is sophomore
Kevin Robertson, whom De
ttamanti called "the best
freshman (field) player in the
country last year." The All-
America lefthander is re
spected by Dettamanti as an

effective driver in the front
court. Robertson himself ac
counted for three goals in the
tie game between the teams.
Seven of Cal's 10 goals in that
game were scored by
Robertson and Loughlin.
Stanford's driving specialist,
Tom Angelo, commented on
the upcoming game, saying,
"They're pretty hard to drive
against. Cal plays you tight all
the time, though, so the best
thing you can do is try to drive
against them."
Against Cal, Angelo said that
an effective driving offense
can facilitate a lot of different
plays for the Cards, not the
least of which is he man-up
situation.
Cal's pressing defense

"makes for a lot of kickouts,"
Angelo said.
While Angelo, fellow senior
Robby Arnold and hole man
Jody Campbell hold down the
front-court offense, the Cal of
fense will have to face a tough
defensive game anchored by
Gansel and senior Doug
Burke. With the Card offense
consistently scoring about 10
goals per game, the team's de
fensive efforts have been win
ning the games by holding
their opponents to an average
of about six goals per game.
"We play a six-man de
fense," said Burke. "We play a
helping defense, even though
it's technically man-to man.
You can't just concentrate on
your man and forget about the
other five guys."

"I think we're going to need
a strong defensive effort
(against Cal) to make our
counter-attack go," said junior
Randy Kalbus. Kalbus and
freshman Chris Kelsey are the
players Dettamanti counts on
for a successful fast-break
counter-attack.
"Cal has several players that
drive mainly to get a kickout. I
think we can burn them on the
counter-attack," Kalbus said.
Assessing the overall situta
tion, Dettamanti said he felt
the top three players on each
team were "pretty even."
"But I think we're a little
stronger in our 4th through
Bth spots and in the goal," De
ttamanti said.
"That'll make the differ
ence."
