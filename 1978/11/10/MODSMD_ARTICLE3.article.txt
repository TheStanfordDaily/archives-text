# Card coach starts fast

### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
In 1902, the California Bears began a water
polo team, their striped regalia properly cover
ing a respectable amount of skin as the poloists
shot the ball around on the other side of the
Bay. About the same time Stanford organized a
team and joined Cal at the top of the national
rankings.
The tradition has grown and endured. The
swimwear may be a little scantier but the talent
is more abundant than ever and 76 years later,
Stanford is the No. 1 team in the nation and
California is No. 2.
The Bay Area teams have caused more recent
powerhouses such as Pepperdine, USC, UCLA

and UC-lrvine to cringe in the face of their
northern rivals' expertise. Cal and Stanford
have captured the last five NCAA champion
ships between them (four going to the Bears
and one to the Cards).
For the next two weekends, though, the two
teams quit compiling combined stats as the
Cards and the Bears square-off in the "watered
down" version of the Big Game.
Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti, in only his
second year at the helm, has led Stanford to
their present mark of 20-0-1 the only
"blemish" being the tie, courtesy of the men
across the Bay.
