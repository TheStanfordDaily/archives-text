# Card coach starts fast
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
In 1902, the California Bears began a water
polo team, their striped regalia properly cover
ing a respectable amount of skin as the poloists
shot the ball around on the other side of the
Bay. About the same time Stanford organized a
team and joined Cal at the top of the national
rankings.
The tradition has grown and endured. The
swimwear may be a little scantier but the talent
is more abundant than ever and 76 years later,
Stanford is the No. 1 team in the nation and
California is No. 2.
The Bay Area teams have caused more recent
powerhouses such as Pepperdine, USC, UCLA

and UC-lrvine to cringe in the face of their
northern rivals' expertise. Cal and Stanford
have captured the last five NCAA champion
ships between them (four going to the Bears
and one to the Cards).
For the next two weekends, though, the two
teams quit compiling combined stats as the
Cards and the Bears square-off in the "watered
down" version of the Big Game.
Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti, in only his
second year at the helm, has led Stanford to
their present mark of 20-0-1 the only
"blemish" being the tie, courtesy of the men
across the Bay.
Dettamanti has more than the competitive
ness of the age-old rivalry to maintain, though.
He's following in the footsteps of the master
mind of modern Stanford water polo former
coach Art Lambert.
According to Dettamanti, Lambert is nothing
less than "the best coach in the country and
one of the best in the world."
Talk about acts to f0110w...
"Ten years ago when I was a grad student, Art
Lambert was an Olympic coach," said De
ttamanti. He's won championships at every
level of play high school, junior college,
college, AAU and Olympic."
But Dettamanti is on the verge of bringing
home his own championship and it's no
small prize. Nationals begin in two weeks at
Long Beach's Belmont Plaza, but first the Cards
have to splash through the Big Game.
"We're playing every game as it comes
along," said Dettamanti. "But we're also look
ing ahead. The team that wins i n these next two
weekends will have the edge. The confidence
factor may be very important if one team were
to sweep both games."
The Cards already seem to have a high de
gree of confidence. It must be a by-product of
having the best collegiate record in the nation.
"Cal's going to have play a super game to
beat us," Dettamanti noted. "We strongly feel
that we're the better team."
The coach of that "better team" has some
experience of his own on which to base that
appraisal.
Through high school and college (at UC-
Davis) the 35-year old Santa Maria export
played the sport competitively. He was assis
tant coach at Davis before transferring to UCLA
where he earned a masters in kinesiology. As
assistant coach at UCLA in 1969, a post he held
while dong his graduate work, the Bruins went
undefeated to capture the first official NCAA
championship in water polo.
In 1970 Dettamanti was named head coach at
Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he
amassed a 54-32 overall record.
"That's another reason the Big Game is so
important," said Dettamanti. "If we beat Cal,
we have an excellent chance of going unde
feated."
After a four-year stint as head swimming and
water polo coach at Occidental, Dettamanti
switched schools again and became the mentor
at UC-Santa Barbara.
In 1976, when the Cards brought home the
NCAA title, Dettamanti's UCSB team had lost to
them by one point in the natonals and ended

the season with a fourth-place finish.
Now Dettamanti heads the squad that is a
strong candidate for the national title.
"At UCSB we had different kinds of players,"
Dettamanti said. "They were larger and slower
and good for the type of offense we played,
which was more static. What we did at Santa
Barbara would not be successful here."
What does work for the Cards though, is a
type of play that Dettamanti inherited partly
from his talented'predecessor, Lambert.
"The style with which Lambert coached was
unique," Dettamanti said. "The technique is dif
ferent from what 95 percent of other water polo
teams employ. He influenced me in the amount
of time spent on the fast-break offense, on the
type of conditioning, strategy in the extra-man
situation and his defensive strategy which is
different than most."
But Dettamanti said he maintains his own
philosophy toward coaching, though at first it
was difficult to break into the Stanford water
polo tradition and away from some of the old
ethics, he admitted.
"The hardest thing when I first started coach
ing was getting the players to believe there is
more than one way to coach a team,"
Dettamanti said with concern.
"Lambert did things his way and won a na
tional championship," Dettamanti said. "I've
changed a lot, adopted a lot of his strategies
and learned through the players."
Dettamanti said the adjustment has been
eased by the talent he's got in the water.
"It's nice to have great athletes," he summed
up simply. "With the tradition of Stanford and
Stanford water polo, I can attract players I
never could have gotten at UCSB."'
And what kind of players make up a 20-0-1
team?
"Our players are very talented," Dettamanti
responded. "We have a harmonious blend of
talent. And they're unselfish. Our players don't
care who scores, as long as we win. They take
pride in defense also, and we probably have
the top goalie in the nation in John Gansel."
Dettamanti has survived the trials of being a
new coach in a realm where superiority is a
tradition. These next three weeks he will try to
perpetuate that historical precedent.
"We don't want to place a great emphasis on
these upcoming games (with Cal)," said De
ttamanti. "We want to win and it's special be
cause it's the Big Game. B.ut the national
championships are coming up," he said with
confidence, "and that's the one we really
want."

perpetuate that historical precedent.
"We don't want to place a great emphasis on
these upcoming games (with Cal)," said De
ttamanti. "We want to win and it's special be
cause it's the Big Game. B.ut the national
championships are coming up," he said with
confidence, "and that's the one we really
want."

Stanford water polo coach Dante Dettamanti shouts instructions to
his team in a game earlier this season. Dettamanti is currently in his
second year at the helm of the Cardinal water polo squad.
In 1902, the California Bears began a water
polo team, their striped regalia properly cover
ing a respectable amount of skin as the poloists
shot the ball around on the other side of the
Bay. About the same time Stanford organized a
team and joined Cal at the top of the national
rankings.
The tradition has grown and endured. The
swimwear may be a little scantier but the talent
is more abundant than ever and 76 years later,
Stanford is the No. 1 team in the nation and
California is No. 2.
The Bay Area teams have caused more recent
powerhouses such as Pepperdine, USC, UCLA

and UC-lrvine to cringe in the face of their
northern rivals' expertise. Cal and Stanford
have captured the last five NCAA champion
ships between them (four going to the Bears
and one to the Cards).
For the next two weekends, though, the two
teams quit compiling combined stats as the
Cards and the Bears square-off in the "watered
down" version of the Big Game.
Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti, in only his
second year at the helm, has led Stanford to
their present mark of 20-0-1 the only
"blemish" being the tie, courtesy of the men
across the Bay.
Dettamanti has more than the competitive
ness of the age-old rivalry to maintain, though.
He's following in the footsteps of the master
mind of modern Stanford water polo former
coach Art Lambert.
According to Dettamanti, Lambert is nothing
less than "the best coach in the country and
one of the best in the world."
Talk about acts to f0110w...
"Ten years ago when I was a grad student, Art
Lambert was an Olympic coach," said De
ttamanti. He's won championships at every
level of play high school, junior college,
college, AAU and Olympic."
But Dettamanti is on the verge of bringing
home his own championship and it's no
small prize. Nationals begin in two weeks at
Long Beach's Belmont Plaza, but first the Cards
have to splash through the Big Game.
"We're playing every game as it comes
along," said Dettamanti. "But we're also look
ing ahead. The team that wins i n these next two
weekends will have the edge. The confidence
factor may be very important if one team were
to sweep both games."
The Cards already seem to have a high de
gree of confidence. It must be a by-product of
having the best collegiate record in the nation.
"Cal's going to have play a super game to
beat us," Dettamanti noted. "We strongly feel
that we're the better team."
The coach of that "better team" has some
experience of his own on which to base that
appraisal.
Through high school and college (at UC-
Davis) the 35-year old Santa Maria export
played the sport competitively. He was assis
tant coach at Davis before transferring to UCLA
where he earned a masters in kinesiology. As
assistant coach at UCLA in 1969, a post he held
while dong his graduate work, the Bruins went
undefeated to capture the first official NCAA
championship in water polo.
In 1970 Dettamanti was named head coach at
Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he
amassed a 54-32 overall record.
"That's another reason the Big Game is so
important," said Dettamanti. "If we beat Cal,
we have an excellent chance of going unde
feated."
After a four-year stint as head swimming and
water polo coach at Occidental, Dettamanti
switched schools again and became the mentor
at UC-Santa Barbara.
In 1976, when the Cards brought home the
NCAA title, Dettamanti's UCSB team had lost to
them by one point in the natonals and ended

the season with a fourth-place finish.
Now Dettamanti heads the squad that is a
strong candidate for the national title.
"At UCSB we had different kinds of players,"
Dettamanti said. "They were larger and slower
and good for the type of offense we played,
which was more static. What we did at Santa
Barbara would not be successful here."
What does work for the Cards though, is a
type of play that Dettamanti inherited partly
from his talented'predecessor, Lambert.
"The style with which Lambert coached was
unique," Dettamanti said. "The technique is dif
ferent from what 95 percent of other water polo
teams employ. He influenced me in the amount
of time spent on the fast-break offense, on the
type of conditioning, strategy in the extra-man
situation and his defensive strategy which is
different than most."
But Dettamanti said he maintains his own
philosophy toward coaching, though at first it
was difficult to break into the Stanford water
polo tradition and away from some of the old
ethics, he admitted.
"The hardest thing when I first started coach
ing was getting the players to believe there is
more than one way to coach a team,"
Dettamanti said with concern.
"Lambert did things his way and won a na
tional championship," Dettamanti said. "I've
changed a lot, adopted a lot of his strategies
and learned through the players."
Dettamanti said the adjustment has been
eased by the talent he's got in the water.
"It's nice to have great athletes," he summed
up simply. "With the tradition of Stanford and
Stanford water polo, I can attract players I
never could have gotten at UCSB."'
And what kind of players make up a 20-0-1
team?
"Our players are very talented," Dettamanti
responded. "We have a harmonious blend of
talent. And they're unselfish. Our players don't
care who scores, as long as we win. They take
pride in defense also, and we probably have
the top goalie in the nation in John Gansel."
Dettamanti has survived the trials of being a
new coach in a realm where superiority is a
tradition. These next three weeks he will try to
perpetuate that historical precedent.
"We don't want to place a great emphasis on
these upcoming games (with Cal)," said De
ttamanti. "We want to win and it's special be

Stanford water polo, I can attract players I
never could have gotten at UCSB."'
And what kind of players make up a 20-0-1
team?
"Our players are very talented," Dettamanti
responded. "We have a harmonious blend of
talent. And they're unselfish. Our players don't
care who scores, as long as we win. They take
pride in defense also, and we probably have
the top goalie in the nation in John Gansel."
Dettamanti has survived the trials of being a
new coach in a realm where superiority is a
tradition. These next three weeks he will try to
perpetuate that historical precedent.
"We don't want to place a great emphasis on
these upcoming games (with Cal)," said De
ttamanti. "We want to win and it's special be
cause it's the Big Game. B.ut the national
championships are coming up," he said with
confidence, "and that's the one we really
want."

Stanford water polo coach Dante Dettamanti shouts instructions to
his team in a game earlier this season. Dettamanti is currently in his
second year at the helm of the Cardinal water polo squad.
In 1902, the California Bears began a water
polo team, their striped regalia properly cover
ing a respectable amount of skin as the poloists
shot the ball around on the other side of the
Bay. About the same time Stanford organized a
team and joined Cal at the top of the national
rankings.
The tradition has grown and endured. The
swimwear may be a little scantier but the talent
is more abundant than ever and 76 years later,
Stanford is the No. 1 team in the nation and
California is No. 2.
The Bay Area teams have caused more recent
powerhouses such as Pepperdine, USC, UCLA

and UC-lrvine to cringe in the face of their
northern rivals' expertise. Cal and Stanford
have captured the last five NCAA champion
ships between them (four going to the Bears
and one to the Cards).
For the next two weekends, though, the two
teams quit compiling combined stats as the
Cards and the Bears square-off in the "watered
down" version of the Big Game.
Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti, in only his
second year at the helm, has led Stanford to
their present mark of 20-0-1 the only
"blemish" being the tie, courtesy of the men
across the Bay.
Dettamanti has more than the competitive
ness of the age-old rivalry to maintain, though.
He's following in the footsteps of the master
mind of modern Stanford water polo former
coach Art Lambert.
According to Dettamanti, Lambert is nothing
less than "the best coach in the country and
one of the best in the world."
Talk about acts to f0110w...
"Ten years ago when I was a grad student, Art
Lambert was an Olympic coach," said De
ttamanti. He's won championships at every
level of play high school, junior college,
college, AAU and Olympic."
But Dettamanti is on the verge of bringing
home his own championship and it's no
small prize. Nationals begin in two weeks at
Long Beach's Belmont Plaza, but first the Cards
have to splash through the Big Game.
"We're playing every game as it comes
along," said Dettamanti. "But we're also look
ing ahead. The team that wins i n these next two
weekends will have the edge. The confidence
factor may be very important if one team were
to sweep both games."
The Cards already seem to have a high de
gree of confidence. It must be a by-product of
having the best collegiate record in the nation.
"Cal's going to have play a super game to
beat us," Dettamanti noted. "We strongly feel
that we're the better team."
The coach of that "better team" has some
experience of his own on which to base that
appraisal.
Through high school and college (at UC-
Davis) the 35-year old Santa Maria export
played the sport competitively. He was assis
tant coach at Davis before transferring to UCLA
where he earned a masters in kinesiology. As
assistant coach at UCLA in 1969, a post he held
while dong his graduate work, the Bruins went
undefeated to capture the first official NCAA
championship in water polo.
In 1970 Dettamanti was named head coach at
Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he
amassed a 54-32 overall record.
"That's another reason the Big Game is so
important," said Dettamanti. "If we beat Cal,
we have an excellent chance of going unde
feated."
After a four-year stint as head swimming and
water polo coach at Occidental, Dettamanti
switched schools again and became the mentor
at UC-Santa Barbara.
In 1976, when the Cards brought home the
NCAA title, Dettamanti's UCSB team had lost to
them by one point in the natonals and ended

the season with a fourth-place finish.
Now Dettamanti heads the squad that is a
strong candidate for the national title.
"At UCSB we had different kinds of players,"
Dettamanti said. "They were larger and slower
and good for the type of offense we played,
which was more static. What we did at Santa
Barbara would not be successful here."
What does work for the Cards though, is a
type of play that Dettamanti inherited partly
from his talented'predecessor, Lambert.
"The style with which Lambert coached was
unique," Dettamanti said. "The technique is dif
ferent from what 95 percent of other water polo
teams employ. He influenced me in the amount
of time spent on the fast-break offense, on the
type of conditioning, strategy in the extra-man
situation and his defensive strategy which is
different than most."
But Dettamanti said he maintains his own
philosophy toward coaching, though at first it
was difficult to break into the Stanford water
polo tradition and away from some of the old
ethics, he admitted.
"The hardest thing when I first started coach
ing was getting the players to believe there is
more than one way to coach a team,"
Dettamanti said with concern.
"Lambert did things his way and won a na
tional championship," Dettamanti said. "I've
changed a lot, adopted a lot of his strategies
and learned through the players."
Dettamanti said the adjustment has been
eased by the talent he's got in the water.
"It's nice to have great athletes," he summed
up simply. "With the tradition of Stanford and
Stanford water polo, I can attract players I
never could have gotten at UCSB."'
And what kind of players make up a 20-0-1
