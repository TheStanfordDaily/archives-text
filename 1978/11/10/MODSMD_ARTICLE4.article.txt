# Cutino knows the game

Pete Cutino is no fool. In his
16th year as California's head
water polo coach, he fully
realizes what a coach can and
cannot do.
Yet the fact remains that
Cutino ranks as one of the top
water polo mentor extant. He
garnered NCAA Coach of the
Year honors in 1975, and
headed the 1974 U.S. National
and 1975 Pan-Am squads.
Last season, the Golden

Bears cruised to a 29-3 mark
and the NCAA championship
Cutino's fourth national ti
tle. His career record stands at
an impressive 237-105.
"Stanford wouldn't hire
me," Cutino joked, explaining
why he has been at Cal for so
long.
Cutino has seen a lot since
1963, his first year at Cal, and
has enjoyed watching water
polo evolve. Summer leagues,
Junior Nationals, and related

programs are among the
reasons Cutino cited as con
tributing to water polo's
growth.
"The quality of the sport has
really improved," he said.
"The players coming up are
better prepared. The 'bottom'
level has improved tremend
ously, and that shows in the
fact that any team can win."
Like most good coaches,
Cutino's first priority is trying
