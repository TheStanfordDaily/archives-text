# Cutino knows the game

### CHRIS HAFT 
Pete Cutino is no fool. In his
16th year as California's head
water polo coach, he fully
realizes what a coach can and
cannot do.
Yet the fact remains that
Cutino ranks as one of the top
water polo mentor extant. He
garnered NCAA Coach of the
Year honors in 1975, and
headed the 1974 U.S. National
and 1975 Pan-Am squads.
Last season, the Golden

Bears cruised to a 29-3 mark
and the NCAA championship
Cutino's fourth national ti
tle. His career record stands at
an impressive 237-105.
"Stanford wouldn't hire
me," Cutino joked, explaining
why he has been at Cal for so
long.
Cutino has seen a lot since
1963, his first year at Cal, and
has enjoyed watching water
polo evolve. Summer leagues,
Junior Nationals, and related

programs are among the
reasons Cutino cited as con
tributing to water polo's
growth.
"The quality of the sport has
really improved," he said.
"The players coming up are
better prepared. The 'bottom'
level has improved tremend
ously, and that shows in the
fact that any team can win."
Like most good coaches,
Cutino's first priority is trying

team since 1962. In that time, he has guided his team to four national
championships, including last year's title.
to get the best from his
players. "The most important
thing is to try and permit each
individual and the team
to reach its potential and to
improve," he said.
"We try to get a little better
every day, not by thinking of
NCAA, championships or vic
tories those are just by
products."
Very little rgagic is involved
in building an NCAA champ
ionship team, Cutino sard. As
in any other sport, success be
gins and ends with the players.
"It's no secret," he said.
"You gotta have the horses,
and you must work hard."
For Cutino, the rewards of
coaching come perpetually
and with each season. "Each
year is a completely new year.
That's the excitement of
coaching you never know
what's gonna happen," he
explained. "It's a challenging
adventure."
Playing Stanford today, and
again next Saturday at Ber
keley, is one. such challenge
facing Cutino. "There is so
much you have to do to beat
Stanford," he said. "They're
the best-balanced offensive
team around. They have a lot
of strong arms shooting the
ball, and it will take a total
'team' game to stop them."
Unfortunately, Cutino ad
mitted/team efforts have been
infrequent for this year's Gol
den Bears because of depth
problems.
"We've been kind of up
and-down, and that's not just
because of the losses," he

said. "We've been weird, a lit
tle different in the nature of
our game. We don't have as
much depth as we used to.
"In some of our games,
we've had one or two players
do well, and that wasn't
enough," he continued. "We
have a lot of 'novice' players:
they're good, but they can't
match the experience of Stan
ford's guys (Tom) Angelo,
(Robby) Arnold, (Doug) Burke,
<Randy) Kalbus, even their
freshmen. We don't have
Stanford's depth. That's not an
excuse, just a fact of life."
However, Cutino has always
enjoyed playing the Cardinals.
"Ours is a very healthy rivalry;
it's not vindictive at all," he
stressed. "If I may say so, it's
on a 'higher' level than most
other rivalries. I've been good
friends with Jim Gaughran, the
former coach, and Dante (De
ttamanti) since he's been
coaching."
Stanford's current success
and Cal's fight to earn a NCAA
bid heightens the importance
of these two games, Cutino
asserted.
"The biggest, most special
thing about playing Stanford
now is that they're No. 1. We
would like to have good per
formances. Since we're tied
with (JSC for second place,
going to the NCAA's might be
a political thing, and I'd like to
at least split these two games
to give us an edge (over the
Trojans).
"I hope we just go out and
play the game, not try too
hard."

to get the best from his
players. "The most important
thing is to try and permit each
individual and the team
to reach its potential and to
improve," he said.
"We try to get a little better
every day, not by thinking of
NCAA, championships or vic
tories those are just by
products."
Very little rgagic is involved
in building an NCAA champ
ionship team, Cutino sard. As
in any other sport, success be
gins and ends with the players.
"It's no secret," he said.
"You gotta have the horses,
and you must work hard."
For Cutino, the rewards of
coaching come perpetually
and with each season. "Each
year is a completely new year.
That's the excitement of
coaching you never know
what's gonna happen," he
explained. "It's a challenging
adventure."
Playing Stanford today, and
again next Saturday at Ber
keley, is one. such challenge
facing Cutino. "There is so
much you have to do to beat
Stanford," he said. "They're
the best-balanced offensive
team around. They have a lot
of strong arms shooting the
ball, and it will take a total
'team' game to stop them."
Unfortunately, Cutino ad
mitted/team efforts have been
infrequent for this year's Gol
den Bears because of depth
problems.
"We've been kind of up
and-down, and that's not just
because of the losses," he

said. "We've been weird, a lit
tle different in the nature of
our game. We don't have as
much depth as we used to.
"In some of our games,
we've had one or two players
do well, and that wasn't
enough," he continued. "We
have a lot of 'novice' players:
they're good, but they can't
match the experience of Stan
ford's guys (Tom) Angelo,
(Robby) Arnold, (Doug) Burke,
<Randy) Kalbus, even their
freshmen. We don't have
Stanford's depth. That's not an
excuse, just a fact of life."
However, Cutino has always
enjoyed playing the Cardinals.
"Ours is a very healthy rivalry;
it's not vindictive at all," he
stressed. "If I may say so, it's
on a 'higher' level than most
other rivalries. I've been good
friends with Jim Gaughran, the
former coach, and Dante (De
ttamanti) since he's been
coaching."
Stanford's current success
and Cal's fight to earn a NCAA
bid heightens the importance
of these two games, Cutino
asserted.
"The biggest, most special
thing about playing Stanford
now is that they're No. 1. We
would like to have good per
formances. Since we're tied
with (JSC for second place,
going to the NCAA's might be
a political thing, and I'd like to
at least split these two games
to give us an edge (over the
Trojans).
"I hope we just go out and
play the game, not try too
hard."

"In some of our games,
we've had one or two players
do well, and that wasn't
enough," he continued. "We
have a lot of 'novice' players:
they're good, but they can't
match the experience of Stan
ford's guys (Tom) Angelo,
(Robby) Arnold, (Doug) Burke,
<Randy) Kalbus, even their
freshmen. We don't have
Stanford's depth. That's not an
excuse, just a fact of life."
However, Cutino has always
enjoyed playing the Cardinals.
"Ours is a very healthy rivalry;
it's not vindictive at all," he
stressed. "If I may say so, it's
on a 'higher' level than most
other rivalries. I've been good
friends with Jim Gaughran, the
former coach, and Dante (De
ttamanti) since he's been
coaching."
Stanford's current success
and Cal's fight to earn a NCAA
bid heightens the importance
of these two games, Cutino
asserted.
"The biggest, most special
thing about playing Stanford
now is that they're No. 1. We
would like to have good per
formances. Since we're tied
with (JSC for second place,
going to the NCAA's might be
a political thing, and I'd like to
at least split these two games
to give us an edge (over the
Trojans).
"I hope we just go out and
play the game, not try too
hard."
