# The 						organization behind this aquatic chaos
## 
### 
Water polo is a game of skill
and swimming ability. There is,
however, a tremendous
amount of physical contact
throughout the game as the
players maneuver for position
in front of the goals.
There are seven players on a
team: six field players and one
goalie. The teams start each
quarter by swimming for the
•ball which is thrown by the re
feree into the pool at half
court. The team advances by
passing or swimming the ball
and a goal is scored when the
ball goes into the opponent's
cage. The ball must be handled
with one hand at a time; the
goalie may use two hands.
Substitutions may be made
during time outs, at the quar
ter-, after a goal, or any time at
the side of the pool near half
court.
There are two types of fouls:
ordinary and major. Ordinary
fouls include touching the ball
with two hands, taking the ball
underwater, impeding an op

ponent who doesn't have the
ball, pushing off on an oppo
nent, and splashing. Also,
swimming within two meters
of the opponent's goal without
the ball orfailingtoshoot atthe
goal within 35 seconds after
gaining possession of the ball
are ordinary fouls. For ordinary
fouls, the offended player re
ceives the ball and has three
seconds to put the ball into
p |a y.
Major fouls are called for
kicking or striking, for persist
ing in an ordinary foul three
consecutive times against one
opponent, for interfering with
a free pass, for misconduct or
disrespect or for holding,
sinking or pulling back on an
opponent without the ball. The
ordinary fouls of splashing,
impeding and pushing off be
come major when committed
during dead time (referee has
not put ball in play). Major
fouls result in a player being
ejected for 30 seconds or until
a goal is scored. If a major foul
is called against a player on the

offense, the player is not
ejected but the ball is turned
over to the opposing team.
Three major fouls against one
player calls for his ejection for
the remainder of the game. A
substitute may play in his place
after the 30 second penalty.
Deliberate slugging calls for
ejection with no substitution
for the remainder of the game.

If an offensive player is
fouled while in control of the
ball and facing the goal inside
the four meter line, he is
awarded a penalty throw at the
goal. This also counts as a
major foul against the player.
A foul is indicated when the
referee blows his whistle. The
color of the flag he holds up
(white for the visitor) indicates

which team is awarded the ball.
Dead time occurs when a
player is fouled and the clock is
stopped. When the player
takes his free pass the clock
starts and dead time is over. A
foul by a defensive player dur
ing the time the clock is stop
ped is a major foul and the
player is ejected for 30 sec
onds.

Water polo is a game of skill
and swimming ability. There is,
however, a tremendous
amount of physical contact
throughout the game as the
players maneuver for position
in front of the goals.
There are seven players on a
team: six field players and one
goalie. The teams start each
quarter by swimming for the
•ball which is thrown by the re
feree into the pool at half
court. The team advances by
passing or swimming the ball
and a goal is scored when the
ball goes into the opponent's
cage. The ball must be handled
with one hand at a time; the
goalie may use two hands.
Substitutions may be made
during time outs, at the quar
ter-, after a goal, or any time at
the side of the pool near half
court.
There are two types of fouls:
ordinary and major. Ordinary
fouls include touching the ball
with two hands, taking the ball
underwater, impeding an op

ponent who doesn't have the
ball, pushing off on an oppo
nent, and splashing. Also,
swimming within two meters
of the opponent's goal without
the ball orfailingtoshoot atthe
goal within 35 seconds after
gaining possession of the ball
are ordinary fouls. For ordinary
fouls, the offended player re
ceives the ball and has three
seconds to put the ball into
p |a y.
Major fouls are called for
kicking or striking, for persist
ing in an ordinary foul three
consecutive times against one
opponent, for interfering with
a free pass, for misconduct or
disrespect or for holding,
sinking or pulling back on an
opponent without the ball. The
ordinary fouls of splashing,
impeding and pushing off be
come major when committed
during dead time (referee has
not put ball in play). Major
fouls result in a player being
ejected for 30 seconds or until
a goal is scored. If a major foul
is called against a player on the

offense, the player is not
ejected but the ball is turned
over to the opposing team.
Three major fouls against one
player calls for his ejection for
the remainder of the game. A
substitute may play in his place
after the 30 second penalty.
Deliberate slugging calls for
ejection with no substitution
for the remainder of the game.

If an offensive player is
fouled while in control of the
ball and facing the goal inside
the four meter line, he is
awarded a penalty throw at the
goal. This also counts as a
major foul against the player.
