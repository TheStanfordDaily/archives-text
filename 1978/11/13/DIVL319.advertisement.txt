ACCOMPLISHMENT.
It comes from reaching a goal — and knowing that your
achievement will be recognized.
At Intel, we decentralize management to give more exposure to
each of our employees. We think that more work gets done more
creatively in small groups. So each employee gets a real sense of
participation in the exceptional achievements of Intel. Achievements
that include the semiconductor memory. The microprocessor. The
microcomputer. The single-board computer. And many of the
technological processes that made these products possible, such
as silicon gate MOS and HMOS.
If you want to start your career with a company where your
accomplishments will be recognized and you're are about to receive
your BS, MS or PhD in electrical engineering, chemical engineering,
solid-state physics, computer science or a related field, see us on
campus. We'd like to tell you about Intel career opportunities in the
San Francisco Bay Area. And in suburban Portland, Oregon.
