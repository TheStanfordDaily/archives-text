# Mud bowl victory
## Cards slosh past Sun Devils 21-14 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Tempe, Ariz. — The Stanford scout
ing report on Arizona State was
complete in every detail except one:
the balmy 85-degree afternoon the
Cardinals expected turned into a
downpour which drove water
logged ASU fans cascading out of
Sun Devil Stadium Saturday.
The Cactusland monsoon also
grounded Stanford's prolific aerial
attack and little-used fullback Jim
Brown suddenly became the offen
sive workhorse, carrying the ball 26
times for 108 yards while leading the
Cards to a 21-14 victory over favored
ASU.
Listed as the third-string halfback
before the beginning of fall camp,
Brown had carried the ball just 21
times for 39 yards this season, most
of that as a substitute for the injured

Phil Francis. But Saturday Brown
earned ABC's Offensive Player of
the Game honors as he allowed
Stanford to swap game plans with
ASU.
"We thought we were going to be
able to run the ball on them," Sun
Devil coach Frank Kush said. "That's
what we were going to try — our
whole concept was to have ball con
trol."
"I thought that they ran just about
any time they wanted to (in the first
half) and controlled the ball effec
tively," Kush said.
"Under these conditions," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said, "Jim
Brown did as good as any man could
carrying the football."
"Jim Brown played the greatest
game," Card defensive end Chuck
Evans said.

"He's just a stud," said Dean Wil
son, the Cards' other starting defen
sive end.
Brown's defensive teammates ap
preciated the offense's time con
sumption — Stanford maintained
possession for 32:33 of the 60-
minute contest while running
against the Pac-10's toughest rush
defense. The Stanford defense
blanked the Sun Devils in the first
half and forced them to play catch
up throughout the second stanza
after the Cards grabbed an 18-0
halftime advantage.
Although Arizona State scored
twice in the second half, the oppor
tunistic Card defense pirated three
ASU passes and negated any com
eback thoughts.
Thoughts for the umbrellaed spec
tators in the first half centered more

on comfort than comeback. It rained
in a fashion that would do Eugene,
Ore., proud, driving fans out of the
stadium faster than they came in.
The scoreboard flashed a message
—wf t shirt contest at i to — but no one
cared to laugh.
No one laughed either when the
Stanford Band was physically re
moved from the field at halftime.
After flying to Phoenix at 3 a.m., the
masters of musical merriment
charged on to the turf for their
halftime presentation, undaunted
by the stormy tempest Halfway
through its opening number, the
public address announcer asked the
Band to leave the field. It didn't skip
a beat.
The announcer asked LSJUMB to
leave once again, then asked sec-

returned to the game to help the Cards push on to victory.
