# Mud bowl victory
## Cards slosh past Sun Devils 21-14 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Tempe, Ariz. — The Stanford scout
ing report on Arizona State was
complete in every detail except one:
the balmy 85-degree afternoon the
Cardinals expected turned into a
downpour which drove water
logged ASU fans cascading out of
Sun Devil Stadium Saturday.
The Cactusland monsoon also
grounded Stanford's prolific aerial
attack and little-used fullback Jim
Brown suddenly became the offen
sive workhorse, carrying the ball 26
times for 108 yards while leading the
Cards to a 21-14 victory over favored
ASU.
Listed as the third-string halfback
before the beginning of fall camp,
Brown had carried the ball just 21
times for 39 yards this season, most
of that as a substitute for the injured

Phil Francis. But Saturday Brown
earned ABC's Offensive Player of
the Game honors as he allowed
Stanford to swap game plans with
ASU.
"We thought we were going to be
able to run the ball on them," Sun
Devil coach Frank Kush said. "That's
what we were going to try — our
whole concept was to have ball con
trol."
"I thought that they ran just about
any time they wanted to (in the first
half) and controlled the ball effec
tively," Kush said.
"Under these conditions," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said, "Jim
Brown did as good as any man could
carrying the football."
"Jim Brown played the greatest
game," Card defensive end Chuck
Evans said.

"He's just a stud," said Dean Wil
son, the Cards' other starting defen
sive end.
Brown's defensive teammates ap
preciated the offense's time con
sumption — Stanford maintained
possession for 32:33 of the 60-
minute contest while running
against the Pac-10's toughest rush
defense. The Stanford defense
blanked the Sun Devils in the first
half and forced them to play catch
up throughout the second stanza
after the Cards grabbed an 18-0
halftime advantage.
Although Arizona State scored
twice in the second half, the oppor
tunistic Card defense pirated three
ASU passes and negated any com
eback thoughts.
Thoughts for the umbrellaed spec
tators in the first half centered more

on comfort than comeback. It rained
in a fashion that would do Eugene,
Ore., proud, driving fans out of the
stadium faster than they came in.
The scoreboard flashed a message
—wf t shirt contest at i to — but no one
cared to laugh.
No one laughed either when the
Stanford Band was physically re
moved from the field at halftime.
After flying to Phoenix at 3 a.m., the
masters of musical merriment
charged on to the turf for their
halftime presentation, undaunted
by the stormy tempest Halfway
through its opening number, the
public address announcer asked the
Band to leave the field. It didn't skip
a beat.
The announcer asked LSJUMB to
leave once again, then asked sec-

urity men to remove the Band
from the field. Finally, after
drum major Dave Ford had
been bodily removed from the
field, the corralled band
members made their exit —
must to the chagrin of the
crowd.
The remaining fans booed
loudly and the jeering re
sounded in a stadium which
doubles as an echo chamber.
It became easy to see how
USC lost in front of 70,000
screaming maniacs in Tempe
three weeks ago. The weath
er's biggest effect on the game
was simply keeping 50,000 of
those maniacs home, dry and
in front of the tube.
The whip-tongued Kush was
not pleased with Saturday's
result calling the game "a very
poor team effort," saying the
Sun Devils "played patheti
cally in the first half."
ASU quarterbacks Mark
Malone and Mike Pagel had
passes dropped all afternoon
and Kush said he was "ex
tremely disappointed" with
his receivers. He saved his
most generous comments for
tight end Marshall Edwards,
who dropped a pass during
the fourth quarter with the
nearest Stanford defender at
least eight yards away.
"Marshall played very
poorly — in fact, I was really
disappointed in him and if we
had someone else we'd put
him (Edwards) on the bench,"
Kush said. "Unfortunately, we
just don't have anyone."
Kush seemed to have forgot
ten that the Sun Devils scored
on that same drive, after a
hometown pass interference
call gave the Sun Devils the
ball on the Stanford 18. After
an offsides penalty on
Arizona, Pagel threw a pass to
wide receiver John Mistier,
which cornerback Larry
Reynolds defended perfectly.
But the ball popped out of
Reynolds' hands and fell to
the ground. Unfortunately for
the Cards, Mistier was on his
back occupying that spot of
ground and grabbed the de
flected pass for a TD.
But while the small portion
of the 69,900 who bought tic
kets for the game remained
and cheered in futility for ASU
to do to Stanford as others had
done to the Cards, the Stan
ford defense was having no
part of it.
Well-prepared for the
Arizona State running game of
traps, dives and tosses, Stan
ford forced the Sun Devils to
the air, a fatal route for Kush's
charges.
The Sun Devils completed
15 of 36 passes, most of them
quick slants or play-action

passes with misdirection. But
ASU also surrendered three
interceptions, the third one
grabbed by game captain
Steve Budinger, an Arizona na
tive, on the Devil's last posses
sion of the game. The sopho
more linebacker, who had an
interception earlier and led
the Cards in tackles with 17,
was named Chevrolet Defen
sive Player of the Came.
While the Sun Devils had
trouble sustaining drives,
Stanford had immediate suc
cess dissecting the ASU de
fense. As they had in the five
previous games, the Cards
drove for six points on their
first possession.
With Darrin Nelson running
at the ends and Brown busting
up the middle, the Cardinals
advanced to the ASU 18. Stan
ford QB Steve Dils then drilled
a perfect pass to Ken
Margerum, who was open in
the end zone on a post pattern
for his ninth TD of the year.
Later in the quarter, Stan
ford brought in three tight
ends with third-and-3 from the
ASU 13. The Sun Devils clog
ged the middle, and Nelson
swept around left end for the
TD.
In the second quarter the
Cardinals drove 71 yards to the
ASU 4 on 15 plays — all of
them running plays. Then with
fourth down Dils faked a give
to Brown through the middle
of the line and fired a short
pass to tight end Marty Smith
for the TD. Stanford, which
had gone for two-point con
versions after each score, mis
sed its third in a row.
"We were blowing them five
yards off the line," Dils said.
"Then Jimmy would find a
crack and pick up ten yards."
While the victory Saturday
coupled with a Big Came
triumph this weekend would
give the Cardinals a shot at a
berth in a bowl game, such as
the Sun or Liberty Bowl, the
Cards may have to do without
some of their starters in Ber
keley.
Nelson and defensive backs
)ohn Pigott and Rick Parker
were all hobbling with sprains
after the game. Their playing
status will be known later to
day.
And Stanford will be fortu
nate to escape Arizona with
out any pneumonia cases. Ac
tually, the Cards were fortu
nate to escape the Grand Ca
nyon state with a victory.
As Evans said, "Any time you
come down here and win, it's
quite an accomplishment."
It's a good thing for Stan
ford's sake that the Cards
don't have to travel to Tempe
again for four years. By 1982
the field may have dried out.

With Darrin Nelson running

advanced to the ASU 18. Stan
ford QB Steve Dils then drilled
a perfect pass to Ken
Margerum, who was open in
the end zone on a post pattern
for his ninth TD of the year.
Later in the quarter, Stan
ford brought in three tight
ends with third-and-3 from the
ASU 13. The Sun Devils clog
ged the middle, and Nelson
swept around left end for the
TD.
In the second quarter the
Cardinals drove 71 yards to the
ASU 4 on 15 plays — all of
them running plays. Then with
fourth down Dils faked a give
to Brown through the middle
of the line and fired a short
pass to tight end Marty Smith
for the TD. Stanford, which
had gone for two-point con
versions after each score, mis
sed its third in a row.
"We were blowing them five
yards off the line," Dils said.
"Then Jimmy would find a
crack and pick up ten yards."
While the victory Saturday
coupled with a Big Came
triumph this weekend would
give the Cardinals a shot at a
berth in a bowl game, such as
the Sun or Liberty Bowl, the
Cards may have to do without
some of their starters in Ber

Nelson and defensive backs

And Stanford will be fortu

As Evans said, "Any time you

Tempe, Ariz. — The Stanford scout
ing report on Arizona State was
complete in every detail except one:
the balmy 85-degree afternoon the
Cardinals expected turned into a
downpour which drove water
logged ASU fans cascading out of
Sun Devil Stadium Saturday.
The Cactusland monsoon also
grounded Stanford's prolific aerial
attack and little-used fullback Jim
Brown suddenly became the offen
sive workhorse, carrying the ball 26
times for 108 yards while leading the
Cards to a 21-14 victory over favored
ASU.
Listed as the third-string halfback
before the beginning of fall camp,
Brown had carried the ball just 21
times for 39 yards this season, most
of that as a substitute for the injured

Phil Francis. But Saturday Brown
earned ABC's Offensive Player of
the Game honors as he allowed
Stanford to swap game plans with
ASU.
"We thought we were going to be
able to run the ball on them," Sun
Devil coach Frank Kush said. "That's
what we were going to try — our
whole concept was to have ball con
trol."
"I thought that they ran just about
any time they wanted to (in the first
half) and controlled the ball effec
tively," Kush said.
"Under these conditions," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said, "Jim
Brown did as good as any man could
carrying the football."
"Jim Brown played the greatest
game," Card defensive end Chuck
Evans said.

"He's just a stud," said Dean Wil
son, the Cards' other starting defen
sive end.
Brown's defensive teammates ap
preciated the offense's time con
sumption — Stanford maintained
possession for 32:33 of the 60-
minute contest while running
against the Pac-10's toughest rush
defense. The Stanford defense
blanked the Sun Devils in the first
half and forced them to play catch
up throughout the second stanza
after the Cards grabbed an 18-0
halftime advantage.
Although Arizona State scored
twice in the second half, the oppor
tunistic Card defense pirated three
ASU passes and negated any com
eback thoughts.
Thoughts for the umbrellaed spec
tators in the first half centered more

on comfort than comeback. It rained
in a fashion that would do Eugene,
Ore., proud, driving fans out of the
stadium faster than they came in.
The scoreboard flashed a message
—wf t shirt contest at i to — but no one
cared to laugh.
No one laughed either when the
Stanford Band was physically re
moved from the field at halftime.
After flying to Phoenix at 3 a.m., the
masters of musical merriment
charged on to the turf for their
halftime presentation, undaunted
by the stormy tempest Halfway
through its opening number, the
public address announcer asked the
Band to leave the field. It didn't skip

been bodily removed from the
field, the corralled band
members made their exit —
must to the chagrin of the
crowd.
The remaining fans booed
loudly and the jeering re
sounded in a stadium which
doubles as an echo chamber.
It became easy to see how
USC lost in front of 70,000
screaming maniacs in Tempe
three weeks ago. The weath
er's biggest effect on the game
was simply keeping 50,000 of
those maniacs home, dry and
in front of the tube.
The whip-tongued Kush was
not pleased with Saturday's
result calling the game "a very
poor team effort," saying the
Sun Devils "played patheti
cally in the first half."
ASU quarterbacks Mark
Malone and Mike Pagel had
passes dropped all afternoon
and Kush said he was "ex
tremely disappointed" with
his receivers. He saved his
most generous comments for
tight end Marshall Edwards,
who dropped a pass during
the fourth quarter with the
nearest Stanford defender at
least eight yards away.
"Marshall played very
poorly — in fact, I was really
disappointed in him and if we
had someone else we'd put
him (Edwards) on the bench,"
Kush said. "Unfortunately, we
just don't have anyone."
Kush seemed to have forgot
ten that the Sun Devils scored
on that same drive, after a
hometown pass interference
call gave the Sun Devils the
ball on the Stanford 18. After
an offsides penalty on
Arizona, Pagel threw a pass to
wide receiver John Mistier,
which cornerback Larry
Reynolds defended perfectly.
But the ball popped out of
Reynolds' hands and fell to
the ground. Unfortunately for
the Cards, Mistier was on his
back occupying that spot of
ground and grabbed the de
flected pass for a TD.
But while the small portion
of the 69,900 who bought tic
kets for the game remained
and cheered in futility for ASU
to do to Stanford as others had
done to the Cards, the Stan
ford defense was having no
part of it.
Well-prepared for the
Arizona State running game of
traps, dives and tosses, Stan
ford forced the Sun Devils to
the air, a fatal route for Kush's
charges.
The Sun Devils completed
15 of 36 passes, most of them
quick slants or play-action

passes with misdirection. But
ASU also surrendered three
interceptions, the third one
grabbed by game captain
Steve Budinger, an Arizona na
tive, on the Devil's last posses
sion of the game. The sopho
more linebacker, who had an
interception earlier and led
the Cards in tackles with 17,
was named Chevrolet Defen

While the Sun Devils had
trouble sustaining drives,
Stanford had immediate suc

passes dropped all afternoon
and Kush said he was "ex
tremely disappointed" with
his receivers. He saved his
most generous comments for
tight end Marshall Edwards,
who dropped a pass during
the fourth quarter with the
nearest Stanford defender at
least eight yards away.
"Marshall played very
poorly — in fact, I was really
disappointed in him and if we
had someone else we'd put
him (Edwards) on the bench,"
Kush said. "Unfortunately, we
just don't have anyone."
Kush seemed to have forgot
ten that the Sun Devils scored
on that same drive, after a
hometown pass interference
call gave the Sun Devils the
ball on the Stanford 18. After
an offsides penalty on
Arizona, Pagel threw a pass to
wide receiver John Mistier,
which cornerback Larry
Reynolds defended perfectly.
But the ball popped out of
Reynolds' hands and fell to
the ground. Unfortunately for
the Cards, Mistier was on his
back occupying that spot of
ground and grabbed the de
flected pass for a TD.
But while the small portion
of the 69,900 who bought tic
kets for the game remained
and cheered in futility for ASU
to do to Stanford as others had
done to the Cards, the Stan
ford defense was having no
part of it.
Well-prepared for the
Arizona State running game of
traps, dives and tosses, Stan
ford forced the Sun Devils to
the air, a fatal route for Kush's
charges.
The Sun Devils completed
15 of 36 passes, most of them
quick slants or play-action

passes with misdirection. But
ASU also surrendered three
interceptions, the third one
grabbed by game captain
Steve Budinger, an Arizona na
tive, on the Devil's last posses
sion of the game. The sopho
more linebacker, who had an
interception earlier and led
the Cards in tackles with 17,
was named Chevrolet Defen
sive Player of the Came.
While the Sun Devils had
trouble sustaining drives,
Stanford had immediate suc
cess dissecting the ASU de
fense. As they had in the five
previous games, the Cards
drove for six points on their
first possession.
With Darrin Nelson running
at the ends and Brown busting
up the middle, the Cardinals
advanced to the ASU 18. Stan
ford QB Steve Dils then drilled
a perfect pass to Ken
Margerum, who was open in
the end zone on a post pattern
for his ninth TD of the year.
Later in the quarter, Stan
ford brought in three tight
ends with third-and-3 from the
ASU 13. The Sun Devils clog
ged the middle, and Nelson
swept around left end for the
TD.
In the second quarter the
Cardinals drove 71 yards to the
ASU 4 on 15 plays — all of
them running plays. Then with
fourth down Dils faked a give
to Brown through the middle
of the line and fired a short
pass to tight end Marty Smith
for the TD. Stanford, which
had gone for two-point con
versions after each score, mis
sed its third in a row.
"We were blowing them five
yards off the line," Dils said.
"Then Jimmy would find a
crack and pick up ten yards."
While the victory Saturday
coupled with a Big Came
triumph this weekend would
give the Cardinals a shot at a
berth in a bowl game, such as
the Sun or Liberty Bowl, the
Cards may have to do without
some of their starters in Ber
keley.
Nelson and defensive backs
)ohn Pigott and Rick Parker
were all hobbling with sprains
after the game. Their playing
status will be known later to
day.
And Stanford will be fortu
nate to escape Arizona with
out any pneumonia cases. Ac
tually, the Cards were fortu

nyon state with a victory.
As Evans said, "Any time you
come down here and win, it's

It's a good thing for Stan

don't have to travel to Tempe
again for four years. By 1982
the field may have dried out.

Tempe, Ariz. — The Stanford scout
ing report on Arizona State was
complete in every detail except one:
the balmy 85-degree afternoon the
Cardinals expected turned into a
downpour which drove water
logged ASU fans cascading out of
Sun Devil Stadium Saturday.
The Cactusland monsoon also
grounded Stanford's prolific aerial
attack and little-used fullback Jim
Brown suddenly became the offen
sive workhorse, carrying the ball 26
times for 108 yards while leading the
Cards to a 21-14 victory over favored
ASU.
Listed as the third-string halfback
before the beginning of fall camp,
Brown had carried the ball just 21
times for 39 yards this season, most
of that as a substitute for the injured

Phil Francis. But Saturday Brown
earned ABC's Offensive Player of
the Game honors as he allowed
Stanford to swap game plans with
ASU.
"We thought we were going to be
able to run the ball on them," Sun
Devil coach Frank Kush said. "That's
what we were going to try — our
whole concept was to have ball con

"I thought that they ran just about
any time they wanted to (in the first
half) and controlled the ball effec
tively," Kush said.
"Under these conditions," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said, "Jim
Brown did as good as any man could
carrying the football."
"Jim Brown played the greatest
game," Card defensive end Chuck
Evans said.

"He's just a stud," said Dean Wil
son, the Cards' other starting defen

Brown's defensive teammates ap
preciated the offense's time con
sumption — Stanford maintained
possession for 32:33 of the 60-
minute contest while running
against the Pac-10's toughest rush
defense. The Stanford defense
blanked the Sun Devils in the first
half and forced them to play catch
up throughout the second stanza
after the Cards grabbed an 18-0
halftime advantage.
Although Arizona State scored
twice in the second half, the oppor
tunistic Card defense pirated three
ASU passes and negated any com
eback thoughts.
Thoughts for the umbrellaed spec
tators in the first half centered more

on comfort than comeback. It rained
in a fashion that would do Eugene,
Ore., proud, driving fans out of the
stadium faster than they came in.
The scoreboard flashed a message

cared to laugh.
No one laughed either when the
Stanford Band was physically re

After flying to Phoenix at 3 a.m., the

against the Pac-10's toughest rush
defense. The Stanford defense
blanked the Sun Devils in the first
half and forced them to play catch
up throughout the second stanza
after the Cards grabbed an 18-0
halftime advantage.
Although Arizona State scored
twice in the second half, the oppor
tunistic Card defense pirated three
ASU passes and negated any com
eback thoughts.
Thoughts for the umbrellaed spec
tators in the first half centered more

on comfort than comeback. It rained
in a fashion that would do Eugene,
Ore., proud, driving fans out of the
stadium faster than they came in.
The scoreboard flashed a message
—wf t shirt contest at i to — but no one
cared to laugh.
No one laughed either when the
Stanford Band was physically re
moved from the field at halftime.
After flying to Phoenix at 3 a.m., the
masters of musical merriment
charged on to the turf for their
halftime presentation, undaunted
by the stormy tempest Halfway
through its opening number, the
public address announcer asked the
Band to leave the field. It didn't skip
a beat.

urity men to remove the Band
from the field. Finally, after
drum major Dave Ford had
been bodily removed from the
field, the corralled band
members made their exit —
must to the chagrin of the
crowd.
The remaining fans booed
loudly and the jeering re
sounded in a stadium which
doubles as an echo chamber.
It became easy to see how
USC lost in front of 70,000
screaming maniacs in Tempe
three weeks ago. The weath
er's biggest effect on the game
was simply keeping 50,000 of
those maniacs home, dry and
in front of the tube.
The whip-tongued Kush was
not pleased with Saturday's
result calling the game "a very
poor team effort," saying the
Sun Devils "played patheti
cally in the first half."
ASU quarterbacks Mark
Malone and Mike Pagel had
passes dropped all afternoon
and Kush said he was "ex
tremely disappointed" with
his receivers. He saved his
most generous comments for
tight end Marshall Edwards,
who dropped a pass during
the fourth quarter with the
nearest Stanford defender at
least eight yards away.
"Marshall played very
poorly — in fact, I was really
disappointed in him and if we
had someone else we'd put
him (Edwards) on the bench,"
Kush said. "Unfortunately, we
just don't have anyone."
Kush seemed to have forgot
ten that the Sun Devils scored
on that same drive, after a
hometown pass interference
call gave the Sun Devils the
ball on the Stanford 18. After
an offsides penalty on
Arizona, Pagel threw a pass to
wide receiver John Mistier,
which cornerback Larry
Reynolds defended perfectly.
But the ball popped out of
Reynolds' hands and fell to
the ground. Unfortunately for
the Cards, Mistier was on his
back occupying that spot of
ground and grabbed the de
flected pass for a TD.
But while the small portion
of the 69,900 who bought tic
kets for the game remained
and cheered in futility for ASU
to do to Stanford as others had
done to the Cards, the Stan
ford defense was having no
part of it.
Well-prepared for the
Arizona State running game of
traps, dives and tosses, Stan
ford forced the Sun Devils to
the air, a fatal route for Kush's
charges.
The Sun Devils completed
15 of 36 passes, most of them
quick slants or play-action

passes with misdirection. But
ASU also surrendered three
interceptions, the third one
grabbed by game captain
Steve Budinger, an Arizona na
tive, on the Devil's last posses
sion of the game. The sopho
more linebacker, who had an
interception earlier and led
the Cards in tackles with 17,
was named Chevrolet Defen
sive Player of the Came.
While the Sun Devils had
trouble sustaining drives,
Stanford had immediate suc
cess dissecting the ASU de
fense. As they had in the five
previous games, the Cards
drove for six points on their
first possession.
With Darrin Nelson running
at the ends and Brown busting
up the middle, the Cardinals
advanced to the ASU 18. Stan
ford QB Steve Dils then drilled
a perfect pass to Ken
Margerum, who was open in
the end zone on a post pattern
for his ninth TD of the year.
Later in the quarter, Stan
ford brought in three tight
ends with third-and-3 from the
ASU 13. The Sun Devils clog
ged the middle, and Nelson
swept around left end for the
TD.
In the second quarter the
Cardinals drove 71 yards to the
ASU 4 on 15 plays — all of
them running plays. Then with
fourth down Dils faked a give
to Brown through the middle
of the line and fired a short
pass to tight end Marty Smith
for the TD. Stanford, which
had gone for two-point con
versions after each score, mis
sed its third in a row.
"We were blowing them five
yards off the line," Dils said.
"Then Jimmy would find a
crack and pick up ten yards."
While the victory Saturday
coupled with a Big Came
triumph this weekend would
give the Cardinals a shot at a
berth in a bowl game, such as
the Sun or Liberty Bowl, the
Cards may have to do without
some of their starters in Ber
keley.
Nelson and defensive backs
)ohn Pigott and Rick Parker
were all hobbling with sprains
after the game. Their playing
status will be known later to
day.
And Stanford will be fortu
nate to escape Arizona with
out any pneumonia cases. Ac
tually, the Cards were fortu
nate to escape the Grand Ca
nyon state with a victory.
As Evans said, "Any time you
come down here and win, it's
quite an accomplishment."
It's a good thing for Stan
ford's sake that the Cards
don't have to travel to Tempe
again for four years. By 1982
the field may have dried out.

shortened halftime presentation Saturday. Officials wanted the Band off the field to preserve the badly
abused turf. The crowd, however, wanted the Band to stay. The crowd lost — twice that day.
Tempe, Ariz. — The Stanford scout
ing report on Arizona State was
complete in every detail except one:
the balmy 85-degree afternoon the
Cardinals expected turned into a
downpour which drove water
logged ASU fans cascading out of
Sun Devil Stadium Saturday.
The Cactusland monsoon also
grounded Stanford's prolific aerial
attack and little-used fullback Jim
Brown suddenly became the offen
sive workhorse, carrying the ball 26
times for 108 yards while leading the
Cards to a 21-14 victory over favored
ASU.
Listed as the third-string halfback
before the beginning of fall camp,
Brown had carried the ball just 21
times for 39 yards this season, most
of that as a substitute for the injured

Phil Francis. But Saturday Brown
earned ABC's Offensive Player of
the Game honors as he allowed
Stanford to swap game plans with
ASU.
"We thought we were going to be
able to run the ball on them," Sun
Devil coach Frank Kush said. "That's
what we were going to try — our
whole concept was to have ball con
trol."
"I thought that they ran just about
any time they wanted to (in the first
half) and controlled the ball effec
tively," Kush said.
"Under these conditions," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh said, "Jim
Brown did as good as any man could
carrying the football."
"Jim Brown played the greatest
game," Card defensive end Chuck
Evans said.

"He's just a stud," said Dean Wil
son, the Cards' other starting defen
sive end.
Brown's defensive teammates ap
preciated the offense's time con
sumption — Stanford maintained
