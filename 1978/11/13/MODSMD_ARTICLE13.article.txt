## Richard Wohl Service plan a hoax 
### 
In a rollicking, laughter-filled interview at
Mountain Mike's yesterday, Congressman Pete
McGodsky told me how his recent, controver
sial proposals for a "national service plan" were
really ait elaborate joke.
"Helen Hickering (McCodsky's chief staff as
sistant) and I thought all this up on a plane trip
to San Diego," the six-term representative
boasted. "We were holding our sides the
whole way down."
I was shocked. How could he possibly have
risked such a stunt right before an election? "It
was only because my opponents were such
utter dullards. David Harris (McCodsky's 1976
opponent) would have killed me on this."
The cunning Congressman happily divulged
the details of his hoax.
"I wasn't scheduled for anything at Stanford,
and the campus forum was of course a must.
Fortunately, it took only a couple of phone
calls to set me up at Bowman on the 23rd.
"I tried to make the session there as inflam
matory as possible — Helen had been kidding
and goading me all morning.
"The group of students waiting for me
looked inquisitive. I wanted to lull them with a
little trade talk first.
"Then I made a few subtle ethnic remarks,
with no effect. Only a couple of people even
looked up at my really ridiculous analogy, the
one comparing too many blacks in the army to
Mafia infiltration of the New York Police De
partment. And no one seemed to figure out the
more blatant absurdity — that 'no reasonable
young men' in an army of minorities implies
that only smart whites are trustworthy.
"Even physical signs didn't cue them! During
the whole war-mongering bit, about the big
bad Russians out-spending us, and about being
ready for war at the drop of a hat, I was wiping
my eyes constantly. Apparently, none of them
remembered what I was doing in the anti-war
movement. And that was only five years ago!
"After that, nothing I could say seemed to jar
them — even when I was really groping, saying
stuff like how making excess eighteen-year
olds do agricultural labor would cut off illegal
immigration. As a matter of fact, I had to give
the whole thing away the next day to a United
Farm Workers official, who was threatening to
recall a hefty contribution to my campaign.
"But when it was over, I was afraid I'd gone
too far. Some of the kids seemed really furious
and upset. It was great!

"I wanted to start the fire again somehow.
Helen's writing a stupid letter for me to the
Daily helped a little. But we had to find a
catalyst, something really emotional. To that
end, convincing those kids to do that guerrilla
skit before the debate was probably our best
idea. When they finished, you could hear the
air crackle. After that, all my evasive rhetoric
upset people even more.
"Finally, that election-day story in the Daily
capped it all beautifully. Since I knew the inter
view would be read rather than heard, I knew I
could fill it with as many logical fallacies as I
cared to.
"That reference at the beginning to Senator
Sam Nunn of Georgia, the supposed co
sponsor of this plan, should have cued anyone.
I haven't even spoken to that reactionary since
before Vietnam. And my next idea could have
come from George McCovern: the plan won t
cost an extra cent, yet every eighteen-year-old
ends up getting a free college education!
"But my best joke came at the end, when I
directly compared my own national labor prog
ram to the present Comprehensive Employ
ment Training Act. Anyone with sense who
reads the paper.knows that CETA has been one
of the most costly, corrupt, and embarrassing
programs in government history."
At this point the Congressman dissolved in
laughter. The absurdity of it all struck me, too,
and I laughed with McGodsky, as much in relief
as anything else. And I was glad that I could still
like him.
But the big question remained: Why had he
chosen to play this joke on Stanford?
McGodsky looked at me incredulously. "Im
agine if I'd gone to the Palo- 1 Ladies' Bridge
Club. You know as well as I that Stanford stu
dents are the archtypical guilty liberals, the
wealthy hypocrites. They're more than willing
to scream and shout about South Africa, but
when it comes right down to it, they're as in
terested in themselves as the average trustee.
We have a definite racial problem right here, in
our own army, and they want to abstain. Now,
I've proven that."
Here, the interview came to a close. "It's all
so funny and ironic," he chortled, getting up to
leave. "I was smiling so hard I almost showed
my teeth."

"That reference at the beginning to Senator
Sam Nunn of Georgia, the supposed co
sponsor of this plan, should have cued anyone.
I haven't even spoken to that reactionary since
before Vietnam. And my next idea could have
come from George McCovern: the plan won t
cost an extra cent, yet every eighteen-year-old
ends up getting a free college education!
"But my best joke came at the end, when I
directly compared my own national labor prog
ram to the present Comprehensive Employ
ment Training Act. Anyone with sense who
reads the paper.knows that CETA has been one
of the most costly, corrupt, and embarrassing
programs in government history."
At this point the Congressman dissolved in
laughter. The absurdity of it all struck me, too,
and I laughed with McGodsky, as much in relief
as anything else. And I was glad that I could still
like him.
But the big question remained: Why had he
chosen to play this joke on Stanford?
McGodsky looked at me incredulously. "Im
agine if I'd gone to the Palo- 1 Ladies' Bridge
Club. You know as well as I that Stanford stu
dents are the archtypical guilty liberals, the
wealthy hypocrites. They're more than willing
to scream and shout about South Africa, but
when it comes right down to it, they're as in
terested in themselves as the average trustee.
We have a definite racial problem right here, in
our own army, and they want to abstain. Now,
I've proven that."
Here, the interview came to a close. "It's all
so funny and ironic," he chortled, getting up to
leave. "I was smiling so hard I almost showed
my teeth."

In a rollicking, laughter-filled interview at
Mountain Mike's yesterday, Congressman Pete
McGodsky told me how his recent, controver
sial proposals for a "national service plan" were
really ait elaborate joke.
"Helen Hickering (McCodsky's chief staff as
sistant) and I thought all this up on a plane trip
to San Diego," the six-term representative
boasted. "We were holding our sides the
whole way down."
I was shocked. How could he possibly have
risked such a stunt right before an election? "It
was only because my opponents were such
utter dullards. David Harris (McCodsky's 1976
opponent) would have killed me on this."
The cunning Congressman happily divulged
the details of his hoax.
"I wasn't scheduled for anything at Stanford,
and the campus forum was of course a must.
Fortunately, it took only a couple of phone
calls to set me up at Bowman on the 23rd.
"I tried to make the session there as inflam
matory as possible — Helen had been kidding
and goading me all morning.
"The group of students waiting for me
looked inquisitive. I wanted to lull them with a
little trade talk first.
"Then I made a few subtle ethnic remarks,
with no effect. Only a couple of people even
looked up at my really ridiculous analogy, the
one comparing too many blacks in the army to
Mafia infiltration of the New York Police De
partment. And no one seemed to figure out the
more blatant absurdity — that 'no reasonable
young men' in an army of minorities implies
that only smart whites are trustworthy.
"Even physical signs didn't cue them! During
the whole war-mongering bit, about the big
bad Russians out-spending us, and about being
ready for war at the drop of a hat, I was wiping
my eyes constantly. Apparently, none of them
remembered what I was doing in the anti-war
movement. And that was only five years ago!
"After that, nothing I could say seemed to jar
them — even when I was really groping, saying
stuff like how making excess eighteen-year
olds do agricultural labor would cut off illegal
immigration. As a matter of fact, I had to give
the whole thing away the next day to a United
Farm Workers official, who was threatening to
recall a hefty contribution to my campaign.
"But when it was over, I was afraid I'd gone
too far. Some of the kids seemed really furious
and upset. It was great!

"I wanted to start the fire again somehow.
Helen's writing a stupid letter for me to the
Daily helped a little. But we had to find a
catalyst, something really emotional. To that
end, convincing those kids to do that guerrilla
skit before the debate was probably our best
idea. When they finished, you could hear the
air crackle. After that, all my evasive rhetoric
upset people even more.
"Finally, that election-day story in the Daily
capped it all beautifully. Since I knew the inter
view would be read rather than heard, I knew I
could fill it with as many logical fallacies as I
cared to.
