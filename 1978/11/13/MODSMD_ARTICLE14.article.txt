# Hayyou an-Nashama
## Fonda speech benefits all 
### 
Mark Nasutti's article (Daiy,
Nov. 3) was either uniquely
shallow or shockingly disgust
ing, or both.
Why uniquely shallow? Be
cause, for one thing, the hun
dreds of students who at
tended )ane Fonda's speech
certainly showed more ap
preciation for Fonda's ideas
than University students nor
mally show to White Plaza
speakers. Or, maybe, were
these hundreds of people less
insightful and less intelligent
than Nassutti? For another
thing, Nassutti insists that
"while I listened to her prop
osals for solving the ills of soc
iety, I kept thinking to myself
'But . . . that's ridiculous! It'll
never work!' and so on and so
forth." Nassutti does not say
exactly what won't work and
why it won't work.
Needless to say, Fonda cer
tainly does not claim to be a
full-time committed social re
former. She is only a con
cerned and enlightened citi
zen. And she is shocked by
and worried about the apathy
of the average American per
son, particularly the students.
I am sure she does not enter
tain the illusion of having
ready-made solution recipes
to the many ills of the Ameri
can society, although she cer
tainly has her ideas about
these ills and indeed shared
them, much to their apprecia
tion, with the University
community.
Why is Nassutti's article
shockingly disgusting? Be
cause his ideas, if not uniquely
shallow, are pedantically im
perialist. Had Exxon or Gen
eral Motors wanted to answer
Fonda, they couldn't have
written a more favorable arti
cle. However, they would
probably have written a more
intelligent one.
Nassutti, in rejecting Fon
da's drive for less military
spending, justifies his position
by saying, "In this day of di
minishing resources and in
creased competition for mar
kets, there are too many fac
tors working against that sta
bility without some kind of de
ferent, however questiona
ble." In other more explicit
terms, Nassutti says that in
order for the American multi
national corporations to stand
a better chance in exploiting
the Indians, the Bengalis, the
Arabs, the Africans, the Latin
Americans, the Southeast
Asians, etc., Uncle Sam must
force his might over these

people. But how does Uncle
Sam do this? He does it by ap
pointing, supporting and arm
ing to the teeth corrupt lead
ers like Shah Pahlavi (of Iran),
Sadat (of Egypt), King Hassan
(of Morocco), King Khaled (of
Arabia) and Moboto (of
Zaire). Uncle Sam also does it
by killing independent leaders
who reject exploitation (e.g.
Allende of Chile and the at
tempt to assassinate Fidel Cas
tro).
To this argument, Nassutti
would say, "you are following
Fonda's suit by riding the
trend towards easy solutions
for incredibly complicated
problems and the trend away
from rational consideration of
those problems." Very few
clever-sounding statements
could be more hollow or more
shallow than the above state
ment.
It certainly is immoral for
the U.S. to support the Shah
of Iran or King Hassan of
Morocco or Mobobo of Zaire
when the whole world, includ
ing the U.S., knows how cor
rupt and criminal they are. On
the other hand, it is also ra
tional for the U.S. not to sup
port these men. How? Moral
ity at a higher level of objec
tive analysis is rational. Nas
sutti's rationality, however, is
of a lower nature; it is the ra
tionality of corporations which
is short-sighted and narrow
minded because it is in
terested in an immediate or
near-immediate profit.
The U.S. interventions in
the Third World and its milit
ary commitments around the
world are certainly irrational
actions, in a broader under
standing of rationality and irra
tionality. For one thing,
thousands of Americans (not
the corporation managers'
children) get killed in places
like Iran, Latin America and
Southeast Asia. Vietnam is not
yet an old story, I hope. For
another, even in the places
where Americans don't get kil
led (Zaire, for example, where
Moroccan and Egyptian pup
pets have done the dirty job
for the Americans), the U.S. is
the ultimate loser. How?
People develop hatred for the
U.S. and what the U.S. stands
for. They revolt sooner or la
ter. They kill their American
oppressors. They cut their
economic connections with
the U.S. They align themselves
with other world powers and
blocs which have not oppres
sed them. And the American

people end up being the los
ers.
It is about time the Ameri
can people started rethinking
about the system and their re
lationship to the multi
national corporations which
(as President Carter himself
admits) run this country, not
in the American people's in
terest, but in their own "irra
tional" short-sighted and im
moral interest.
Luckily for the American
people, they still have at least
the exterior of democracy
where enlightened individuals
like ]ane Fonda can still come
out and talk. Fonda is indeed a
healthy symptom and I and
many hundred others enjoyed
and benefitted from her
speech.

Southeast Asia. Vietnam is not
yet an old story, I hope. For
another, even in the places
where Americans don't get kil
led (Zaire, for example, where
Moroccan and Egyptian pup
pets have done the dirty job
for the Americans), the U.S. is
the ultimate loser. How?
People develop hatred for the
U.S. and what the U.S. stands
for. They revolt sooner or la
ter. They kill their American
oppressors. They cut their
economic connections with
the U.S. They align themselves
with other world powers and
blocs which have not oppres
sed them. And the American

people end up being the los
ers.
It is about time the Ameri
can people started rethinking
about the system and their re
lationship to the multi
national corporations which
(as President Carter himself
admits) run this country, not
in the American people's in
terest, but in their own "irra
tional" short-sighted and im
moral interest.
Luckily for the American
people, they still have at least
the exterior of democracy
where enlightened individuals
like ]ane Fonda can still come
out and talk. Fonda is indeed a
healthy symptom and I and
many hundred others enjoyed
and benefitted from her
speech.

Mark Nasutti's article (Daiy,
Nov. 3) was either uniquely
shallow or shockingly disgust
ing, or both.
Why uniquely shallow? Be
cause, for one thing, the hun
dreds of students who at
tended )ane Fonda's speech
certainly showed more ap
preciation for Fonda's ideas
than University students nor
mally show to White Plaza
speakers. Or, maybe, were
these hundreds of people less
insightful and less intelligent
than Nassutti? For another
thing, Nassutti insists that
"while I listened to her prop
osals for solving the ills of soc
iety, I kept thinking to myself
'But . . . that's ridiculous! It'll
never work!' and so on and so
forth." Nassutti does not say
exactly what won't work and
why it won't work.
Needless to say, Fonda cer
tainly does not claim to be a
full-time committed social re
former. She is only a con
cerned and enlightened citi
zen. And she is shocked by
and worried about the apathy
of the average American per
son, particularly the students.
I am sure she does not enter
tain the illusion of having
ready-made solution recipes
to the many ills of the Ameri
can society, although she cer
tainly has her ideas about
these ills and indeed shared
them, much to their apprecia
tion, with the University
community.
Why is Nassutti's article
shockingly disgusting? Be
cause his ideas, if not uniquely
shallow, are pedantically im
perialist. Had Exxon or Gen
eral Motors wanted to answer
Fonda, they couldn't have
written a more favorable arti
cle. However, they would
probably have written a more
intelligent one.
Nassutti, in rejecting Fon
da's drive for less military
spending, justifies his position
by saying, "In this day of di
minishing resources and in
creased competition for mar
kets, there are too many fac
tors working against that sta
bility without some kind of de
ferent, however questiona
ble." In other more explicit
terms, Nassutti says that in
order for the American multi
national corporations to stand
a better chance in exploiting
the Indians, the Bengalis, the
Arabs, the Africans, the Latin
Americans, the Southeast
Asians, etc., Uncle Sam must
force his might over these

people. But how does Uncle
Sam do this? He does it by ap
pointing, supporting and arm
ing to the teeth corrupt lead
ers like Shah Pahlavi (of Iran),
Sadat (of Egypt), King Hassan
(of Morocco), King Khaled (of
Arabia) and Moboto (of
Zaire). Uncle Sam also does it
by killing independent leaders
who reject exploitation (e.g.
Allende of Chile and the at
tempt to assassinate Fidel Cas
tro).
To this argument, Nassutti
would say, "you are following
Fonda's suit by riding the
trend towards easy solutions
for incredibly complicated
problems and the trend away
from rational consideration of
those problems." Very few
clever-sounding statements
could be more hollow or more
shallow than the above state
ment.
It certainly is immoral for
the U.S. to support the Shah
of Iran or King Hassan of
Morocco or Mobobo of Zaire
when the whole world, includ
ing the U.S., knows how cor
rupt and criminal they are. On
the other hand, it is also ra
tional for the U.S. not to sup
port these men. How? Moral
ity at a higher level of objec
tive analysis is rational. Nas
sutti's rationality, however, is
of a lower nature; it is the ra
tionality of corporations which
is short-sighted and narrow
minded because it is in
terested in an immediate or
near-immediate profit.
The U.S. interventions in
the Third World and its milit
ary commitments around the
world are certainly irrational
actions, in a broader under
standing of rationality and irra
tionality. For one thing,
thousands of Americans (not
the corporation managers'
children) get killed in places
like Iran, Latin America and
Southeast Asia. Vietnam is not
yet an old story, I hope. For
another, even in the places
where Americans don't get kil

Allende of Chile and the at
tempt to assassinate Fidel Cas
tro).
To this argument, Nassutti
would say, "you are following
Fonda's suit by riding the
trend towards easy solutions
for incredibly complicated
problems and the trend away
from rational consideration of
those problems." Very few
clever-sounding statements
could be more hollow or more
shallow than the above state
ment.
It certainly is immoral for
the U.S. to support the Shah
of Iran or King Hassan of
Morocco or Mobobo of Zaire
when the whole world, includ
ing the U.S., knows how cor
rupt and criminal they are. On
the other hand, it is also ra
tional for the U.S. not to sup
port these men. How? Moral
ity at a higher level of objec
tive analysis is rational. Nas
sutti's rationality, however, is
of a lower nature; it is the ra
tionality of corporations which
is short-sighted and narrow
minded because it is in
terested in an immediate or
near-immediate profit.
The U.S. interventions in
the Third World and its milit
ary commitments around the
world are certainly irrational
actions, in a broader under
standing of rationality and irra
tionality. For one thing,
thousands of Americans (not
the corporation managers'
children) get killed in places
like Iran, Latin America and
Southeast Asia. Vietnam is not
yet an old story, I hope. For
another, even in the places
where Americans don't get kil
led (Zaire, for example, where
Moroccan and Egyptian pup
pets have done the dirty job
for the Americans), the U.S. is
the ultimate loser. How?
People develop hatred for the
U.S. and what the U.S. stands
for. They revolt sooner or la
ter. They kill their American
oppressors. They cut their
economic connections with
the U.S. They align themselves
with other world powers and
blocs which have not oppres
sed them. And the American

people end up being the los
ers.
It is about time the Ameri
can people started rethinking
about the system and their re
lationship to the multi
national corporations which
(as President Carter himself
admits) run this country, not
in the American people's in
terest, but in their own "irra
tional" short-sighted and im
moral interest.
Luckily for the American
people, they still have at least
the exterior of democracy
where enlightened individuals
like ]ane Fonda can still come
out and talk. Fonda is indeed a
healthy symptom and I and
many hundred others enjoyed
and benefitted from her
speech.

Mark Nasutti's article (Daiy,
Nov. 3) was either uniquely
shallow or shockingly disgust
ing, or both.
Why uniquely shallow? Be
cause, for one thing, the hun
dreds of students who at
tended )ane Fonda's speech
certainly showed more ap
preciation for Fonda's ideas
than University students nor
mally show to White Plaza
speakers. Or, maybe, were
these hundreds of people less
insightful and less intelligent
than Nassutti? For another
thing, Nassutti insists that
"while I listened to her prop
osals for solving the ills of soc
iety, I kept thinking to myself
'But . . . that's ridiculous! It'll
never work!' and so on and so
forth." Nassutti does not say
exactly what won't work and
why it won't work.
Needless to say, Fonda cer
tainly does not claim to be a
full-time committed social re
former. She is only a con
cerned and enlightened citi
zen. And she is shocked by
and worried about the apathy
of the average American per
son, particularly the students.
I am sure she does not enter
tain the illusion of having
ready-made solution recipes
to the many ills of the Ameri
can society, although she cer
tainly has her ideas about
these ills and indeed shared
them, much to their apprecia
tion, with the University
community.
Why is Nassutti's article
shockingly disgusting? Be
cause his ideas, if not uniquely
shallow, are pedantically im
perialist. Had Exxon or Gen
eral Motors wanted to answer
Fonda, they couldn't have
written a more favorable arti
cle. However, they would
probably have written a more
intelligent one.
Nassutti, in rejecting Fon
da's drive for less military
spending, justifies his position
by saying, "In this day of di
minishing resources and in
creased competition for mar
kets, there are too many fac
tors working against that sta
bility without some kind of de
ferent, however questiona
ble." In other more explicit
terms, Nassutti says that in
order for the American multi
national corporations to stand
a better chance in exploiting
the Indians, the Bengalis, the
Arabs, the Africans, the Latin
Americans, the Southeast
Asians, etc., Uncle Sam must
force his might over these

people. But how does Uncle
Sam do this? He does it by ap
pointing, supporting and arm
ing to the teeth corrupt lead
ers like Shah Pahlavi (of Iran),
Sadat (of Egypt), King Hassan
(of Morocco), King Khaled (of
Arabia) and Moboto (of
Zaire). Uncle Sam also does it
by killing independent leaders
who reject exploitation (e.g.
Allende of Chile and the at
tempt to assassinate Fidel Cas
tro).
To this argument, Nassutti
would say, "you are following
Fonda's suit by riding the
trend towards easy solutions

problems and the trend away
from rational consideration of
those problems." Very few
