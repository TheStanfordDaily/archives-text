## U.S. role in Iran contradictory 
### 
Last week we witnessed another "suc
cess" for President Jimmy Carter's hu
man rights program. He had to firmly
support the new move of the Shah of Iran
and the massacre of Iranian people — this
time by installing a military government
led by a U.S. trained officer, Golam Reza
Azhari. The American media says that
Azhari is very well known to the U.S.
military establishment and that he has
been instrumental in Iran's purchase of $8
billion worth of U.S. military hardware in
recent years.
While millions of Iranian people are
struggling for the creation of an indepen
dent and democratic state by fighting in
the streets and saying "death to the shah"
and "shah is a U.S. puppet," Carter's
human rights philosophy forces him to
support facism in Iran.
U.S. imperialism is certainly in trouble.
The media is posing the "sticky ques
tion": "What more can the U.S. do to
keep the Shah of Iran on his shaky
throne?" (Christian Science Monitor,
Nov. 7). The State Department has already
clarified U.S. involvement. The U.S. must
keep the Shah of Iran in power because
under his rule, the country has bought
billions of dollars of U.S. military
hardware and safeguarded the oil rich re
gion of the Persian Gulf for the benefit of
the U.S. "business community."
Moreover, the country is now one of the
best markets for U.S. products — the U.S.
sold at least $2 billion of agricultural pro-,
ducts to the shah's government last year
(CBS News, Nov. 6).
The State Department is thus "pleased"
(Wall Street Journal, Nov. 7) with the
shah's recent move, since Azhari "will
work closely, as he has in the past, with
the U.S. military establishment " (Christ
ian Science Monitor, Nov. 7). The U.S.
thus plans to help the shah "crush" the
Iranian people's struggle.
The U.S. media in turn is playing its
own role to prepare the American public
to accept U.S. intervention in Iran. For
years the American media talked about
"the shah's modernization plans and his
western style of development." They are
presently claiming that since the shah
went "too fast" in his attempt to "moder
nize the backward Iranian society," the
people are fighting against him. The
media attempts to mislead American citi
zens. They are giving distorted informa
tion about the true causes of recent mass
uprisings in Iran. The Iranian people
naturally want to develop and modernize

their society, but the shah's regime and
the interests of the multinational corpora
tions in Iran are the real obstacles to
Iran's development and modernization.
This is precisely why the Iranian people
have fought the shah for decades.
The Iranian people have a history of
struggle against the shah and foreign
domination. Those who oppose his rule
and want him to be overthrown share one
common ground: The shah was brought
to power by the CIA coup in 1953 and as a
result he cannot and will not serve the
interests of the people, but rather will
create a condition where a local elite and
their western supporters — mainly
monopoly capitalists — can exploit the
country's natural and human resources.
In the past the shah has played his role
effectively. Soon after the coup, he estab
lished SAVAK under CIA supervision. To
day, with over 60,000 agents, SAVAK is
"synonymous with torture and reign by
terror" (Daily, Nov. 5). The facist regime
of the shah is responsible for the killing of
tens of thousands of Iranian citizens and
putting nearly 100,000 in prison in the past
years. For decades people lived within the
most basic democratic rights.
With regard to the impact of his wes
ternization program, with which the U.S.
media seems to be so fascinated, one
could simply look at the socio-economic
conditions of the country today. Iran used
to be self-sufficient in foods but today 80
percent of the food is imported. The gov
ernment's own statistics and the U.N.
survey indicate that the majority of the
population live in worse conditions than
before he began his so-called "White Re
volution" reform in 1963. The regime it
self confirmed that almost all members of
the 13-year-old Hoveyda (the then Prime
Minister) Cabinet "were corrupt and they
abused their power." The U.S. media also
reports that the country cannot function
without the presence of over 40,000 U.S.
"advisors."
When the fruits of the shah's moderni
zation are nothing but misery to the
majority of the population, the people's
opposition to such "modernization"
should not come as a surprise. The shah's
development program is not a develop
ment for the Iranian people. The recent
mass uprising in Iran is thus a natural de
velopment of struggle which the Iranian
people have launched ever since the 1953
CIA coup. The struggle has now offered
hopes to all Iranian people at home and
to those progressive Iranians living ab

road: hope for the creation of an inde
pendent and democratic Iran. But this has
worried western monopoly capitalists.
They fear loss of the advantages that only
the shah can offer them, and not the re
volutionary forces who would liberate the
country. The shah's "stability" which
they once enjoyed is now more
threatened by our people's struggle.
As is clearly indicated by the media, the
world monopoly capitalists led by the
U.S. will help the shah to crush the
people's struggle, because they are
against the independence of Iran. But the
freedom loving people of the world will
certainly support the Iranian people's
struggle against the shah and will con
demn foreign intervention in the country,
since all will gain from a free Iran but the
monopoly capitalists and the local elite.
The Iranian people first want to over
throw the shah's regime and then,
through natural political development,
organize their own independent and
democratic country in which the people
themselves from all strata can effectively
participate in their own internal affairs
and the country as a whole can have a
true role in world development for jus
tice, peace and freedom.
We the Iranian students at the Univer
sity certainly believe that our people's
struggle is a just struggle. We find it
necessary to condemn Carter's recent
support of the facist regime of the shah.
We are aware that you, the freedom lov
ing people of America, played an impor
tant role in condemning the U.S. inter
vention in Vietnam. The recent support of
the shah's military government by the
Carter Administration prepares the
groundwork for further U.S. intervention
in Iran. We seek the support of freedom
loving people in the Univeristy commun
ity in condemning Carter's backing of the
shah.
Join us to stop another Vietnam-like
U.S. involvement.
We have much in common with those
who fight for the true observation of
human rights in the world. The over
whelming majority of Iranian citizens who
oppose the shah must have the right to
choose their own national government
without any foreign intervention.
