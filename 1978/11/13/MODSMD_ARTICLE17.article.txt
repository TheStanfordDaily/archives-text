No more
cheerleaders
This past weekend, I had my
first occasion to attend a game
at Stanford Stadium since my
graduation. The weather was
great, the team played well
and I managed to slip past the
liquor net. I was subjected to
only one unpleasantry: those
damn cheerleaders.
Seated as I was, nearer Es
condido Village than the field,
I would not have been terribly
bothered by the distraction
had the cheerleaders not been
hooked up to some very loud
speakers. They were, how
ever, and we throughout the
stands were treated to such
gems as a dorm competition
cheer (the yell leader and his
microphone were an easy
winner) and the always popu
lar chant, "Kill! Kill! Kill!"
The delights were visual as
well as aural: in the fourth
quarter, with USC a sure win
ner, the clever ones unveiled a
banner reading, "Trojans pop
under pressure." I thought
this was cute when I first saw it
on UCLA rooters' buttons sev
eral years ago. The Bruins lost
then, too, but at least their
backers felt the chagrin to peel
off the slogan when it lost its
appropriateness.
I don't really blame the yell
leaders themselves. They're
volunteers trying to do what
other entertainers get paid a
great deal for: amusing and
evoking response from an es

sentially passive audience. But
what I observed in this first
and only encounter with this
latest generation of cheer
leaders only confirms my sus
picions of two years ago when
I tried in the ASSU Senate to
stop this annoying waste be
fore it got started.
If the older alumni, and the
Athletic Department as their
agent, are still so strongly de
sirous of maintaining this ves
tige of their past, the cheer
leaders and their microphones
should be planted directly in
front of their proponents at all
games.

Ad
promotes
sexism
I agree with Elissa Hirsh that
I, too, would rather not have
seen the Evelyn Woods Read
ing Dynamics advertisement
of Nov. 3. If women are ever to
be equal in people's minds as
well as legally, sexism in the
media must be stopped. Ads
like this only reinforce ideas
which are already too com
mon.
There are too many people
that really believe that women
are here to serve man. Too of
ten, especially from males on
this campus, I've heard
women referred to as though
they were pieces of meat,
there only for their enjoyment

to be won over and then
thrown away. It's time
everyone realized that women
are people too, with thoughts,
feelings, and abilities equal to
a man's.

Ad worth
a good
laugh
I read with great amusement
the letter to the editor (Daily,
Nov. 9) that decired the Daily's
advertisement as "an insult to
all members of the University
community." I remember
reading that ad at breakfast
and enjoying a good laugh.
if anyone took that portrayal
of college life seriously, then
they don't have any sense of
humor. The Daily should
maintain its present ad policy.

A line in Anjum Altaf Mir's
column "Inaccuracies in 'Save
Bhutto' Campaign" (Daily,
Nov. 10), was misprinted. The
correct sentence was:
"Bhutto is on record at this
juncture of threatening in a
public meeting at Lahore to
'break the legs' of any rep
resentative who dared to at
tend the meeting." The Daily
regrets the error.

sexism
I agree with Elissa Hirsh that
I, too, would rather not have
seen the Evelyn Woods Read
ing Dynamics advertisement
of Nov. 3. If women are ever to
be equal in people's minds as
well as legally, sexism in the
media must be stopped. Ads
like this only reinforce ideas
which are already too com
mon.
There are too many people
that really believe that women
are here to serve man. Too of
ten, especially from males on
this campus, I've heard
women referred to as though
they were pieces of meat,
there only for their enjoyment

to be won over and then
thrown away. It's time
everyone realized that women
are people too, with thoughts,
feelings, and abilities equal to
a man's.

Ad worth
a good
laugh
I read with great amusement
the letter to the editor (Daily,
Nov. 9) that decired the Daily's
advertisement as "an insult to
all members of the University
community." I remember
reading that ad at breakfast
and enjoying a good laugh.
if anyone took that portrayal
of college life seriously, then
they don't have any sense of
humor. The Daily should
maintain its present ad policy.

A line in Anjum Altaf Mir's
column "Inaccuracies in 'Save
Bhutto' Campaign" (Daily,
Nov. 10), was misprinted. The
correct sentence was:
"Bhutto is on record at this
juncture of threatening in a
public meeting at Lahore to
'break the legs' of any rep
resentative who dared to at
tend the meeting." The Daily
regrets the error.
No more
cheerleaders
This past weekend, I had my
first occasion to attend a game
at Stanford Stadium since my
graduation. The weather was
great, the team played well
and I managed to slip past the
liquor net. I was subjected to
only one unpleasantry: those
damn cheerleaders.
Seated as I was, nearer Es
condido Village than the field,
I would not have been terribly
bothered by the distraction
had the cheerleaders not been
hooked up to some very loud
speakers. They were, how
ever, and we throughout the
stands were treated to such
gems as a dorm competition
cheer (the yell leader and his
microphone were an easy
winner) and the always popu
lar chant, "Kill! Kill! Kill!"
The delights were visual as
well as aural: in the fourth
quarter, with USC a sure win
ner, the clever ones unveiled a
banner reading, "Trojans pop
under pressure." I thought
this was cute when I first saw it
on UCLA rooters' buttons sev
eral years ago. The Bruins lost
then, too, but at least their
backers felt the chagrin to peel
off the slogan when it lost its
appropriateness.
I don't really blame the yell
leaders themselves. They're
volunteers trying to do what
other entertainers get paid a
great deal for: amusing and
evoking response from an es

sentially passive audience. But
what I observed in this first
and only encounter with this
latest generation of cheer
leaders only confirms my sus
picions of two years ago when
I tried in the ASSU Senate to
stop this annoying waste be
fore it got started.
If the older alumni, and the
Athletic Department as their
agent, are still so strongly de
sirous of maintaining this ves
tige of their past, the cheer
leaders and their microphones
should be planted directly in
front of their proponents at all
games.
