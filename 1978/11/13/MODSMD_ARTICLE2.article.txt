# Garcia lead now 5 votes

### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
In a surprise turnaround, Republi
can challenger Marz Garcia has
moved ahead of incumbent Arlen
Gregorio in a cliffhanger race for
state Senate.
The switch occurred Friday after
two "forgotten" precincts votes
were tabulated with the rest of the
ballots.
The results will not be final until
Nov. 28 when a canvass of all the
polling places will be completed.
The canvass involves checking the
tallies from the voting machines and
making sure the proper figures were
recorded election night.
Whenever a discrepancy is found
between a tabulated result and what
is ascertained from the canvass, the
difference is researched. The votes
will either be disqualified or an error
found in one of them.
Gregorio had been ahead of Gar
cia by seven votes with the votes
from two precincts uncounted. After
the full count, the tally was 87,967
for Garcia to 87,962 for Gregorio.
Garcia's campaign manager, Tony
Marsh, told the Palo Alto Times that
enough number transpositions had
been discovered in the canvass to
wipe out the five vote lead Garcia
holds.
"It's up for grabs . . . it's any
body's race," Garcia told The As
sociated Press. Garcia, a political
novice, resigned his job as a Bank of
America vice president to run
against the two-term incumbent
Gregorio.
"I think the odds are slightly bet
ter than even," Gregorio said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
California state election officials
said this is the closest state race in
California history.
The race had been close since late
election night with both candidates
receiving nearly equal vote totals.
Gregorio emerged with a 39 vote
lead the following morning.
However, when about 1000 absen
tee ballots were counted, his lead
dropped to seven, and now he is
trailing Garcia by five votes.
Like all election returns now, the
totals are unofficial until the final
canvass is completed and until a re
count, likely to be requested by the
losing candidate, is finished.
If Gregorio retains his seat, the
Senate's Democratic majority will
remain 26-14. Republicans gained
seven seats in the Assembly, making
the Democratic majority 50-30.
San Mateo County Clerk Marvin
Church told the Palo Alto Times no
further announcements will be

canvass is completed.
According to the Times, the Re
publican State Central Committee
launched a heavy attack against
Gregorio because of a high GOP re
gistration in his district. Gregorio
further hindered his own re-election
efforts by refusing financial con
tributions from any organization and
limiting personal donations to $250.
Even so, when Gregorio was los
ing to Garcia early election night by
several thousand votes, Gregorio
said he was not sorry about the way
he ran his campaign.

Gregorio had been ahead of Gar
cia by seven votes with the votes
from two precincts uncounted. After
the full count, the tally was 87,967
for Garcia to 87,962 for Gregorio.
Garcia's campaign manager, Tony
Marsh, told the Palo Alto Times that
enough number transpositions had
been discovered in the canvass to
wipe out the five vote lead Garcia
holds.
"It's up for grabs . . . it's any
body's race," Garcia told The As
sociated Press. Garcia, a political
novice, resigned his job as a Bank of
America vice president to run
against the two-term incumbent
Gregorio.
"I think the odds are slightly bet
ter than even," Gregorio said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
California state election officials
said this is the closest state race in
California history.
The race had been close since late
election night with both candidates
receiving nearly equal vote totals.
Gregorio emerged with a 39 vote
lead the following morning.
However, when about 1000 absen
tee ballots were counted, his lead
dropped to seven, and now he is
trailing Garcia by five votes.
Like all election returns now, the
totals are unofficial until the final
canvass is completed and until a re
count, likely to be requested by the
losing candidate, is finished.
If Gregorio retains his seat, the
Senate's Democratic majority will
remain 26-14. Republicans gained
seven seats in the Assembly, making
the Democratic majority 50-30.
San Mateo County Clerk Marvin
Church told the Palo Alto Times no
further announcements will be
made about the Senate race until the
canvass is completed.
According to the Times, the Re
publican State Central Committee
launched a heavy attack against
Gregorio because of a high GOP re
gistration in his district. Gregorio
further hindered his own re-election
efforts by refusing financial con
tributions from any organization and
limiting personal donations to $250.
Even so, when Gregorio was los
ing to Garcia early election night by
several thousand votes, Gregorio
said he was not sorry about the way
he ran his campaign.
In a surprise turnaround, Republi
can challenger Marz Garcia has
moved ahead of incumbent Arlen
Gregorio in a cliffhanger race for
state Senate.
The switch occurred Friday after
two "forgotten" precincts votes
were tabulated with the rest of the
ballots.
The results will not be final until
Nov. 28 when a canvass of all the
polling places will be completed.
The canvass involves checking the
tallies from the voting machines and
making sure the proper figures were
recorded election night.
Whenever a discrepancy is found
between a tabulated result and what
is ascertained from the canvass, the
difference is researched. The votes
will either be disqualified or an error
found in one of them.
