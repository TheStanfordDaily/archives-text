# Card 'mudders' fell fair-weather Devils
## sports 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
Tempe, Ariz. — In a game of paradoxes, the most crucial irony
of all — a continuous, wind-blown downpour in a city that
averages only 10 days of rain a year — turned into an advantage
for the Cardinals as they sloshed and slipped and slid their way
to a 21-14 Mud Bowl victory over Arizona State.
The Cards took the field in "sunny" Arizona before an esti
mated crowd of 51,000. By the time they splashed off the gridi
ron at the end of the fourth quarter, only about 15,000 of coach
Frank Kush's diehard fans remained. But they had witnessed
quite a show.
They saw the Band, which was planning to make a rare TV
appearance, dragged from a soggy turf-torn field by stadium
officials during a wilting cannibis leaf formation.
They saw the No. I passing team in the nation win a game on
the ground.
And they saw the sun peep out momentarily in the third
quarter. They gave it a standing ovation.
The standing ovation should have gone to the players them
selves, however, who adapted extremely well to the weather
limitations.
"We talked about the weather before the game," said Card
defensive end Chuck Evans. "We decided the more it rained,
the better off we'd be."
Wide receiver Vince Mulroy, who accidentally brought along
Astro turf shoes (with shorter cleats) rather than grass cleats was
a little more apprehensive.
"We were originally going f o throw a lot," said Mulroy. "We
were going to run sweeps and wide running plays. But the ball
and turf were slippery so we had to run up the middle."
Running anywhere on drenched grass in winds that reached
40 mph at times is not easy.
"Running in the rain forces you to be more fundamentally
sound in your routes," Mulroy said. "You have to keep your
center of gravity at all times. You can't get away with the stuff
yqu can on a dry field."
Split end Ken Margerum noted that his feet felt weighted
down by the mud and water in his shoes and socks.
Catching the ball can't be any easier than running it in those
conditions, however. "It's a little slippier and harder to catch,"
Mulroy said. "You're forced to catch more with your body than
your hands."
Margeium, who caught one 51-yard pass and had an 18-yard
TD reception, said that during the first half the rain didn't bother
him because he had a towel' to keep his hands dry. By the
second half, though, the towel was too wet to do much good.
Luckily, the players avoided becoming as mentally waterlog
ged as their mud-soaked physical appearance suggested they
might be.
"I think ASU was angry because they had to play during the day
and in the rain," said Stanford (}B Steve Dils. "It affected them
mentally. But our offensive line was having a good time in the
rain. I think they're a bunch of mudders."
Offensive guard jim Stephens concurred. "It's a great feeling
to be wet and cold and muddy when you win. When you lose it
stinks."
The Cards came out smelling as sweet as the elusive Roses.
"We adapted better than ASU to the weather," said Card
coach Bill Walsh. "Steve threw the ball extremely well under the
conditions."
There was some disagreement among the players about who
had the advantage under the adverse circumstances.
"Defensively, there's no adjustment necessary," said Evans.
"For the offense it's a different story. If it's hailing, storming,
whatever, we do the same thing — just line up and stop them."
Mulroy and Stephens, however, both said the wetness was to
the advantage of the attack. The offense knew the plan of action
— they knew where they were running and were primarily
concerned with execution. The defense had to read and react.
Reacting in the rain is much more difficult than when it's dry.
Inside linebacker Steve Budinger, named Defensive Player of
the Came, offered a compromise analysis to the who-has-the
advantage question.
"It all evens out in the end," he said. "The offense lias the
advantage of surprise and the defense has the advantage of
limiting the range of plays the offense can run."
As simple as that.
The kicking game is another matter in the rain, though. Ken
Naber had no apparent difficulty — he booted an average of 41.5
yards per punt — his highest for the season.
"The rain did not affect me," he said. "It was relatively dry
each time I punted. The ground was solid until the end. I didn't
slip even though I expected to."
The wind was also a factor in kicking effectiveness. "The first
punt I didn't hit well," Naber said of the 45-yard boot. "But the
wind held it and carried it a few yards."
So the offensive, defensive and special teams held the
weather in addition to the Devils to achieve their own ends. And
not surprisingly, they had fun doing it. Like little boys in mud,
they slipped around for 60 minutes on soggy soil, dirtied their
jerseys beyond color identification and won a football game in
the meantime.
"It was a change," said defensive end Dean Wilson of playing
in the rain. "It was fun squishing into somebody else and smear
ing mud and grass in your face."
Although the mud got in their eyes and mouths and down
their shirts and shoes, the jubilance following the victory was
unrestrained. For the first time in a long time, the Cards won a
close one — and this time they had more than one opponent to
overcome.
"It's messy playing in the rain," said center John Macaulay
summing up the situation. "But it was great to get totally yucky
in a socially acceptable way."
