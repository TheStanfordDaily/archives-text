# Burke nets final shot to lift Cards past Bears
## Poloists edge Cal 9-8 in last five seconds 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
Doug Burke skipped a
perfectly-aimed shot past the
outstretched arms of Califor
nia goalie Tim Mascheroni
with five seconds remaining in
the game to give the Stanford
water polo team a 9-8 victory
over both the Bears and the
referees Friday at deGuerre
pool.
Saturday, the Cards blew
away Far Western Conference
champ UC-Davis, 15-5 and
cruised to a nighttime 17-8 vic
tory over San Jose State.
Before an overflow crowd of
more than 300 fingernail-biting
spectators, Stanford clinched
the Pacific-10 Conference title
Friday afternoon by handing
the California Bears their
second conference loss. De
spite a hectic fourth quarter
which featured a Cal com
eback and a number of mys
terious calls by referees John
Felix and Bob Lee, the Cards
prevailed for their 32nd
straight home game without a
loss.
With the Cards holding a
seemingly safe 8-6 lead with
1:27 left in the game, a Stan
ford kickout gave the Bears a
man-up advantage. While Cal
set up their 6-on-5 attack, re
feree Lee shocked everyone
by ejecting Cardinal Randy
Kalbus, giving Cal a 6-on-4
situation which the Bears'
Kevin Robertson easily

capitalized on, scoring his
third goal of the game.
According to Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti, the two re
ferees "came up with a 'new
rule' " at halftime and in
formed both starting teams
that in the man-down situa
tions, any defensive player
caught pushing down on the
shoulders of an offensive
player would be ejected for 30
seconds.
Dettamanti said it is a nor
mal practice in the man-down
situation for a defensive player
to rest his hands on the offen
sive post men in order to keep
in contact with them — like a
hand check in basketball.
Normally, this action is not cal
led as a foul and certainly
never an ejection. Apparently,
however, that is what Kalbus
did and he was ejected for it.
While confusion still
reigned over that call, another
Stanford ejection occurred at
1:14. Apparently, the "new
rule" had not been communi
cated to the entire team, be
cause with 56 seconds left,
both Alan Mouchawar and
Dave Egan were ejected from
their 6-on-5 positions for
"hand resting." Nine seconds
later, Cal's Carlos Steffens
scored easily against the three
defensive men left, and the
game was suddenly tied at 8-8.
A fuming Dettamanti called
a time out to plan for the last

45 seconds of game time.
"We decided we would
work for a kickout during the
first 15 to 20 seconds we had
left. We would set picks and
run the regular offense," De
ttamanti said.
"If that didn't work," he
continued, "we planned to

work for the outside shot."
When time resumed, De
ttamanti's plan went into ac
tion, and with 33 seconds left,
Cal's Robertson was caught
crawling over a Cardinal's
back and spent the next half
minute in the "penalty
corner."

The Cards, meanwhile, im
mediately set up their man-up
offense and began passing
around the outside, waiting
for the open shot. With 15
seconds remaining, Burke
overthrew Robby Arnold and
Arnold spent five precious
seconds retrieving the errant

pass. The senior captain pas
sed the elusive spheroid back
to Burke who hesitated for a
moment, then released a low
fastball which skimmed off the
water and hit the back of the
net. Instant pandemonium.
At the final buzzer, a desp
eration shot from none other
than Kevin Robertson landed
squarely in Card goalie John
Cansel's chest and the Cards
had won the conference title
and clinched the No. 1 seed in
the NCAA championships in
two weeks.
"It was a beautiful shot,"
said Dettamanti of Burke's
game-winner. "He really
threaded the needle. What
can I say? It was just a great shot.
He (Burke) has been more of a
field leader this year. With
Robby and Tom (Angelo) scor
ing, he hasn't had to shoot.
But that was a good time for
him to decide to shoot."
The first three quarters of
the game were relatively mild
in comparison, though every
minute of play was typical of
the exciting contests that have
become commonplace bet
ween the two teams.
Through the first half, Gan
sel was the saving force for the
Cards. The sophomore goalie
recorded seven saves in the
first half, most of them coming
on open, well-aimed shots.
Even Cal coach Pete Cutino

felt Gansel made the differ
ence, according to De
ttamanti.
"John definitely made some
blocks that an ordinary goalie
wouldn't have made," De
ttamanti said.
Angelo led the scoring for
the Cards with three, and
Burke and Arnold each added
two.
"Considereing we had 12
ejections to their six, I think
we did a very good job," De
ttamanti said.
Saturday, the Aggies from
Davis fell victim to a balanced
Cardinal scoring attack. Five
Cards scored two goals each
and five more Stanford players
each added one. The victory
was Stanford's 33rd game
without a loss at deGuerre.
Saturday night, Dettamanti
broke the varsity into two
squads against the Spartans.
The first group paced Stanford
to a 9-1 halftime lead and the
second squad held up that
lead to provide a 17-8 winning
margin. Freshman Chris
Kelsey led the Cards with four
goals and Arnold added three
more.
With only next Saturday's
game against Cal to play be
fore the nationals, Stanford's
record stands at 23-0-1. Should
the Cards win Saturday's game
in Berkeley, the Bears would
be forced to play off against
USC for a berth in the NCAAs.

A Cal poloist reaches to get a pass by Stanford defender Randy Kalbus in the Cards' last-second victory
over the Bears Friday. Stanford clinched a top-seed in nationals as well as the Pacific-10 water polo
title this weekend.
Doug Burke skipped a
perfectly-aimed shot past the
outstretched arms of Califor
nia goalie Tim Mascheroni
with five seconds remaining in
the game to give the Stanford
water polo team a 9-8 victory
over both the Bears and the
referees Friday at deGuerre
pool.
Saturday, the Cards blew
away Far Western Conference
champ UC-Davis, 15-5 and
cruised to a nighttime 17-8 vic
tory over San Jose State.
Before an overflow crowd of
more than 300 fingernail-biting
spectators, Stanford clinched
the Pacific-10 Conference title
Friday afternoon by handing
the California Bears their
second conference loss. De
spite a hectic fourth quarter
which featured a Cal com
eback and a number of mys
terious calls by referees John
Felix and Bob Lee, the Cards
prevailed for their 32nd
straight home game without a
loss.
With the Cards holding a
seemingly safe 8-6 lead with
1:27 left in the game, a Stan
ford kickout gave the Bears a
man-up advantage. While Cal
set up their 6-on-5 attack, re
feree Lee shocked everyone
by ejecting Cardinal Randy
Kalbus, giving Cal a 6-on-4
situation which the Bears'
Kevin Robertson easily

capitalized on, scoring his
third goal of the game.
According to Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti, the two re
ferees "came up with a 'new
rule' " at halftime and in
formed both starting teams
that in the man-down situa
tions, any defensive player
caught pushing down on the
shoulders of an offensive
player would be ejected for 30
seconds.
Dettamanti said it is a nor
mal practice in the man-down
situation for a defensive player
to rest his hands on the offen
sive post men in order to keep
in contact with them — like a
hand check in basketball.
Normally, this action is not cal
led as a foul and certainly
never an ejection. Apparently,
however, that is what Kalbus
did and he was ejected for it.
While confusion still
reigned over that call, another
Stanford ejection occurred at
1:14. Apparently, the "new
rule" had not been communi
cated to the entire team, be
cause with 56 seconds left,
both Alan Mouchawar and
Dave Egan were ejected from
their 6-on-5 positions for
"hand resting." Nine seconds
later, Cal's Carlos Steffens
scored easily against the three
defensive men left, and the
game was suddenly tied at 8-8.
A fuming Dettamanti called
a time out to plan for the last

45 seconds of game time.
"We decided we would
work for a kickout during the
first 15 to 20 seconds we had
left. We would set picks and
run the regular offense," De
ttamanti said.
"If that didn't work," he
continued, "we planned to

work for the outside shot."
When time resumed, De
ttamanti's plan went into ac
tion, and with 33 seconds left,
Cal's Robertson was caught
crawling over a Cardinal's
back and spent the next half
minute in the "penalty
corner."

The Cards, meanwhile, im
mediately set up their man-up
offense and began passing
around the outside, waiting
for the open shot. With 15
seconds remaining, Burke
overthrew Robby Arnold and
Arnold spent five precious
seconds retrieving the errant

pass. The senior captain pas
sed the elusive spheroid back
to Burke who hesitated for a
moment, then released a low
fastball which skimmed off the
water and hit the back of the
net. Instant pandemonium.
At the final buzzer, a desp
eration shot from none other
than Kevin Robertson landed
squarely in Card goalie John
Cansel's chest and the Cards
had won the conference title
and clinched the No. 1 seed in
the NCAA championships in
two weeks.
"It was a beautiful shot,"
said Dettamanti of Burke's
game-winner. "He really
threaded the needle. What
can I say? It was just a great shot.
He (Burke) has been more of a
field leader this year. With
Robby and Tom (Angelo) scor
ing, he hasn't had to shoot.
But that was a good time for
him to decide to shoot."
The first three quarters of
the game were relatively mild
in comparison, though every
minute of play was typical of
the exciting contests that have
become commonplace bet
ween the two teams.
Through the first half, Gan
sel was the saving force for the
Cards. The sophomore goalie
recorded seven saves in the
first half, most of them coming
on open, well-aimed shots.
Even Cal coach Pete Cutino

felt Gansel made the differ
ence, according to De
ttamanti.
"John definitely made some
blocks that an ordinary goalie
wouldn't have made," De
ttamanti said.
Angelo led the scoring for
the Cards with three, and
Burke and Arnold each added
two.
"Considereing we had 12
ejections to their six, I think
we did a very good job," De
ttamanti said.
Saturday, the Aggies from
Davis fell victim to a balanced
Cardinal scoring attack. Five
Cards scored two goals each
and five more Stanford players
each added one. The victory
was Stanford's 33rd game
without a loss at deGuerre.
Saturday night, Dettamanti
broke the varsity into two
squads against the Spartans.
The first group paced Stanford
to a 9-1 halftime lead and the
second squad held up that
lead to provide a 17-8 winning
margin. Freshman Chris
Kelsey led the Cards with four
goals and Arnold added three
more.
With only next Saturday's

record stands at 23-0-1. Should

ejections to their six, I think
we did a very good job," De
ttamanti said.
Saturday, the Aggies from
Davis fell victim to a balanced
Cardinal scoring attack. Five
Cards scored two goals each
and five more Stanford players
each added one. The victory
was Stanford's 33rd game
without a loss at deGuerre.
Saturday night, Dettamanti
broke the varsity into two
squads against the Spartans.
The first group paced Stanford
to a 9-1 halftime lead and the
second squad held up that
lead to provide a 17-8 winning
margin. Freshman Chris
Kelsey led the Cards with four
goals and Arnold added three
more.
With only next Saturday's
game against Cal to play be
fore the nationals, Stanford's
record stands at 23-0-1. Should
the Cards win Saturday's game
in Berkeley, the Bears would
be forced to play off against
USC for a berth in the NCAAs.

A Cal poloist reaches to get a pass by Stanford defender Randy Kalbus in the Cards' last-second victory
over the Bears Friday. Stanford clinched a top-seed in nationals as well as the Pacific-10 water polo
title this weekend.
Doug Burke skipped a
perfectly-aimed shot past the
outstretched arms of Califor
nia goalie Tim Mascheroni
with five seconds remaining in
the game to give the Stanford
water polo team a 9-8 victory
over both the Bears and the
referees Friday at deGuerre
pool.
Saturday, the Cards blew
away Far Western Conference
champ UC-Davis, 15-5 and
cruised to a nighttime 17-8 vic
tory over San Jose State.
Before an overflow crowd of
more than 300 fingernail-biting
spectators, Stanford clinched
the Pacific-10 Conference title
Friday afternoon by handing
the California Bears their
second conference loss. De
spite a hectic fourth quarter
which featured a Cal com
eback and a number of mys
terious calls by referees John
Felix and Bob Lee, the Cards
prevailed for their 32nd
straight home game without a
loss.
With the Cards holding a
seemingly safe 8-6 lead with
1:27 left in the game, a Stan
ford kickout gave the Bears a
man-up advantage. While Cal
set up their 6-on-5 attack, re
feree Lee shocked everyone
by ejecting Cardinal Randy
Kalbus, giving Cal a 6-on-4
situation which the Bears'
Kevin Robertson easily

capitalized on, scoring his
third goal of the game.
According to Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti, the two re
ferees "came up with a 'new
rule' " at halftime and in
formed both starting teams
that in the man-down situa
tions, any defensive player
caught pushing down on the
shoulders of an offensive
player would be ejected for 30
seconds.
Dettamanti said it is a nor
mal practice in the man-down
situation for a defensive player
to rest his hands on the offen
sive post men in order to keep
in contact with them — like a
hand check in basketball.
Normally, this action is not cal
led as a foul and certainly
never an ejection. Apparently,
however, that is what Kalbus
did and he was ejected for it.
While confusion still
reigned over that call, another
Stanford ejection occurred at
1:14. Apparently, the "new
rule" had not been communi
cated to the entire team, be
cause with 56 seconds left,
both Alan Mouchawar and
Dave Egan were ejected from
their 6-on-5 positions for
"hand resting." Nine seconds
later, Cal's Carlos Steffens
scored easily against the three
defensive men left, and the
game was suddenly tied at 8-8.
A fuming Dettamanti called
a time out to plan for the last

45 seconds of game time.
"We decided we would
work for a kickout during the
first 15 to 20 seconds we had
left. We would set picks and
run the regular offense," De
ttamanti said.
"If that didn't work," he
continued, "we planned to

work for the outside shot."
When time resumed, De
ttamanti's plan went into ac
tion, and with 33 seconds left,
Cal's Robertson was caught
crawling over a Cardinal's
back and spent the next half
minute in the "penalty
corner."

The Cards, meanwhile, im
mediately set up their man-up
offense and began passing
around the outside, waiting
for the open shot. With 15
seconds remaining, Burke
overthrew Robby Arnold and
Arnold spent five precious
seconds retrieving the errant

pass. The senior captain pas
sed the elusive spheroid back
to Burke who hesitated for a
moment, then released a low
fastball which skimmed off the
water and hit the back of the
net. Instant pandemonium.
At the final buzzer, a desp
eration shot from none other
than Kevin Robertson landed
squarely in Card goalie John
Cansel's chest and the Cards
had won the conference title
and clinched the No. 1 seed in
the NCAA championships in
two weeks.
"It was a beautiful shot,"
said Dettamanti of Burke's
game-winner. "He really
threaded the needle. What
can I say? It was just a great shot.
He (Burke) has been more of a
field leader this year. With
Robby and Tom (Angelo) scor
ing, he hasn't had to shoot.
But that was a good time for
him to decide to shoot."
The first three quarters of
the game were relatively mild
in comparison, though every
minute of play was typical of
the exciting contests that have
become commonplace bet
ween the two teams.
Through the first half, Gan
sel was the saving force for the
Cards. The sophomore goalie
recorded seven saves in the
first half, most of them coming
on open, well-aimed shots.
Even Cal coach Pete Cutino

felt Gansel made the differ
ence, according to De
ttamanti.
"John definitely made some
blocks that an ordinary goalie
wouldn't have made," De
ttamanti said.
Angelo led the scoring for
the Cards with three, and
Burke and Arnold each added
two.
"Considereing we had 12
ejections to their six, I think
we did a very good job," De
ttamanti said.
