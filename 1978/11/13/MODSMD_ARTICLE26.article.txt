# Race marked by grueling competition
## Cross country seventh in regionals 
### THEODORE HERHOLD 
Although the men's cross
country team failed to make
the nationals for the second
year in a row, the Cards did
improve upon last year's per
formance and finished a re
spectable seventh out of 15
teams at the District 8 Champ
ionship Saturday in Fresno.
Last year, the Cards finished
next to last in the regionals,
culminating a disappointing
year for the men. This year,
however, the young Cards,
coached by first year man
Dean Clark, ran a tough race
â€” although no one ran tough
enough to earn a spot in the
national meet. "Overall, I'd
say it was a successful year,"
said Clark. "It was a season we
all learned from."
Roy Kissin was the closest
to making it to the nation
als, finishing only three sec
onds off a national pace. Kissin
ran the 10,000 meter (6.2 mile)
course in 31:07 and ended up
20th. Finishing behind Kissin
for the Cards were Rod Berry,
24th (31:33), Jerry Emory, 28th
(31:48), Craig Corey, 49th
(32:33), John Schaer, 63rd
(32:39) and BiJI Haldeman,
86th (33:29). Tom Lobsinger
dropped out of the race after

three miles due to illness.
As expected, the University
of Oregon ran away with the
event, placing five runners in
the top ten. The Ducks
finished with 26 points.
Slightly unexpected,
Washington State, paced by
all-everything Henry Rono,
edged out the University of
Arizona for second place with
66 points. The Wildcats ended
up with 97 points. Finishing
behind Arizona were the Uni
versity of Washington with 105
points; UC-lrvine, 172 points;
UC-Santa Barbara, 181, and
Stanford with 184 points.
Rounding out the scoring
for the District 8, which is
made up of teams from the
Pac-10 and the PCAA, were
Nevada Reno, 192; UC-
Berkeley, 210; Oregon State,
278; UCLA, 288; Fresno State,
308; Cal State-Long Beach,
329; University of Portland,
375, and San Jose State, 386.
Oregon, Washington State
and Arizona will all participate
in the NCAA Championships
to be held in Madison Wiscon
sin on November 20.
Rono, the defending NCAA
champion and holder of four
world records, won the indi
vidual title finishing the course

in a sizzling 29:29.5. Alberto
Salazar, the University of Ore
gon star who led most of the
way, finished second in a time
of 29:34. Salazar was followed
by Tom Hunt of the University
of Arizona (29:55); Oregon's
Don Clary and Rudy Chapa
(30:00.2 and 30:06.6, respec
tively); Joshua Kimeto of
Washington State (30:15.5);
Ken Martin of Oregon
(30:19.6); Bill McChesney,
Oregon (30:28); Dave Daniels,
Irvine (30:33) and Dirk Lake
man of Arizona (30:42).
Besides the three teams,
Daniels, Juaquim Laeno of
Nevada-Reno, and
Washington's Bill Stolp and
Mark Hallenback also qual
ified for the national meet.
A hard rain fell the night be
fore the race and it was a brisk
42 degrees at the start. A
change from the original dirt
course to an asphalt one was
made early in the morning,
but minutes before the race
started it was determined that
the mud was not bad enough
to warrant the switch.
The race broke out very
quickly, with Kissin, Berry and
Emory sticking together for
the first mile. "It was a very
fast race," said freshman

stand-out Rod Berry. "I ran a
4:41 first mile, and I've never
done that before. This was the
toughest competition I've ever
run against." At the mile
point, Kissin broke off and
spurted about 50 yards
ahead of Berry and Emory,
who found themselves well
back of the leaders at that
point. Emory, who ran the best
race of his collegiate career
according to Clark, and Berry
started to move up as the race
progressed and finished only a
few paces behind Kissin.
"It was tough for the team to
have made the nationals this
year," said Berry. "If four
teams go to the nationals next
year (as is currently being
proposed) I'm sure we'll go.
Said Clark, "I'm really looking
forward to next year."
