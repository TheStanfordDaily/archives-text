### PETER FINCH 
Friday night's women's vol
leyball match against the Uni
versity of Pacific might best be
described as a heartbreaker.
The match went to a full five
games, with Pacific coming up
with the victory.
The Cards surged to a 9-0
lead in the first game and
eventually took the win 15-7.
The second game was rela
tively close throughout, but
after several side-outs at
Pacific's game point, Stanford
went down 13-15. In the third,
the Cards jumped out to a
huge 11-0 lead and went on to
win easily 15-4. The fourth
game, typified by intense rally
ing, went to UOP 15-10. The
fifth and final game was
marked by inspiring play by
the women at the net on both
teams The game, longer and
more exciting than the rest,
brought the crowd to its feet
several times. The Cards were
able to hold the Tigers at game
point by gaining side-out after
side-out, but were not able to
score. Pacific finally took the
point, game and match at
15-13.
Stanford head coach Fred
Sturm was, no doubt, disap
pointed with the loss, but he
praised his team's play, any

way.
"Basically, the match came
down to our defense, which
played very well, and our of
fense, which also played well,
but had trouble generating
points," he said. "I know that
sounds pretty obvious, but we
just couldn't score when we
needed points most. We gave
UOP one chance too many,
and we didn't cash in on
enough of our chances. We
played well enough to win,

but we just didn't score when
we needed to.
"Our middle offense was
really outstanding," he said.
"The setters played very well
and our hitters, Liz Hughes
and Jane Bassett did great."
So, unfortunately, did UOP's
defense.
Saturday's scheduled match
against UC-Riverside was can
celled at the last minute, and
was forfeited to Stanford.
