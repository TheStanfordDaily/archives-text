# New York Times appoints Stanford grad as sports editor
## 
### CARLA NEASEL 
The New York Times an
nounced Saturday that it has
selected a 33-year-old woman as
the new sports editor.
Le Anne Schreiber, who re
ceived her master's degree in En
glish from Stanford in 1968, was
chosen for the position after
working since February as assis
tant sports editor for the Times.
After receiving her master's,
Schreiber transferred to Harvard
where she taught English litera
ture and continued her graduate
studies, "fully intending to be a
college teacher," she said.
"It was there that I learned the
truest thing about me," said
Schreiber, "which is that I have a
broad spectrum of interests. I
found that because academics
requires further and further de
grees of specialization, I was bet
ter suited to journalism.
Her interest in journalism led
Schreiber to a job with Time
magazine, where she reported on
international politics. While
working in that department, she
was chosen to go to Montreal and
cover the summer 1976 Olym
pics.
She said the experience was
"my first, and I thought last, ven-

ture in sports." But this was
hardly the case. Several months
after her return to writing inter
national politics, she was named
editor-in-chief of an outside pub
lication, Womensports magazine,
where, for a year and a half, she
said she "had a ball."
The magazine folded in
January, 1978, and in February
she was appointed assistant
sports editor of the New York
Times.
In a juxtiposition of depart
ment positions, Schreiber moved
to the top slot when former
sports editor Harold Claussen
decided because of personal
reasons and a.ge that he no longer
wanted the major responsibilities
of the sports department head.
Claussen is now Schreiber's de
puty editor.
Schreiber said she believes she
is the first woman editor at the
Times outside of the family/home
section. The fact that she is only
33 makes her position even more
unusual, she added.
"When I first learned that I was
being considered for the posi
tion, yes, I was surprised, but not
because I felt incapable of handl
ing it," said Schreiber.
"I felt, and do feel, completely

capable of carrying out my re
sponsibilities," she said.
Those responsibilities include
overseeing a staff of 55 reporters,
editors, columnists and copy
boys. She defined her job as di
recting her staff "in the process
of getting and writing the news."
In addition to being responsi
ble for the daily sports pages,
Schreiber will also be in charge of
the enlarged Sunday sports sec
tion and the Sports Monday spe
cial section.
Schreiber said that her years of
studying and teaching English lit
erature directly applied both to
her new position as editor, and as
a news writer in general, mainly
because of her "concern for the
quality of writing."
"My years of studying really
help me to perceive the nuances
and hidden drama going on in an
event. I may read a game story,
and given a few facts and some
background, I can figure out the
characters and situation behind
the scenes," she said.
"I'm very happy with my
now, and enjoy immensely what
I'm doing," she said.

international politics. While
working in that department, she
was chosen to go to Montreal and
cover the summer 1976 Olym
pics.
She said the experience was
"my first, and I thought last, ven-

ture in sports." But this was
hardly the case. Several months
after her return to writing inter
national politics, she was named
editor-in-chief of an outside pub
lication, Womensports magazine,
where, for a year and a half, she
said she "had a ball."
The magazine folded in
January, 1978, and in February
she was appointed assistant
sports editor of the New York
Times.
In a juxtiposition of depart
ment positions, Schreiber moved
to the top slot when former
sports editor Harold Claussen
decided because of personal
reasons and a.ge that he no longer
wanted the major responsibilities
of the sports department head.
Claussen is now Schreiber's de
puty editor.
Schreiber said she believes she
is the first woman editor at the
Times outside of the family/home
section. The fact that she is only
33 makes her position even more
unusual, she added.
"When I first learned that I was
being considered for the posi
tion, yes, I was surprised, but not
because I felt incapable of handl
ing it," said Schreiber.
"I felt, and do feel, completely

capable of carrying out my re
sponsibilities," she said.
Those responsibilities include
overseeing a staff of 55 reporters,
editors, columnists and copy
boys. She defined her job as di
recting her staff "in the process
of getting and writing the news."
In addition to being responsi
ble for the daily sports pages,
Schreiber will also be in charge of
the enlarged Sunday sports sec
tion and the Sports Monday spe
cial section.
Schreiber said that her years of
studying and teaching English lit
erature directly applied both to
her new position as editor, and as
a news writer in general, mainly
because of her "concern for the
quality of writing."
"My years of studying really
help me to perceive the nuances
and hidden drama going on in an
event. I may read a game story,
and given a few facts and some
background, I can figure out the
characters and situation behind
the scenes," she said.
"I'm very happy with my
now, and enjoy immensely what
I'm doing," she said.
The New York Times resumed
publication Monday after settling
an 88-day strike.
The New York Times an
nounced Saturday that it has
selected a 33-year-old woman as
the new sports editor.
Le Anne Schreiber, who re
ceived her master's degree in En
glish from Stanford in 1968, was
chosen for the position after
working since February as assis
tant sports editor for the Times.
After receiving her master's,
Schreiber transferred to Harvard
where she taught English litera
ture and continued her graduate
studies, "fully intending to be a
college teacher," she said.
"It was there that I learned the
truest thing about me," said
Schreiber, "which is that I have a
broad spectrum of interests. I
found that because academics
requires further and further de
grees of specialization, I was bet
ter suited to journalism.

Schreiber to a job with Time
