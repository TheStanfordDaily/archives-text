Tanzania fails to repel Uganda
Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania — Tanzanian troops trying to
cross the Kagera River to launch their first major strike
against Ugandan invaders were swept away in the rain
swollen stream and the assault failed, Uganda Radio
said yesterday.
Tanzanian officials said in a statement that the attack
occurred and that their armed forces had begun a
counter-offensive "aimed at destroying the enemy
forces." They gave no details, but added that fighting
was continuing. No casualty figures were given.
It was reported previously that Tanzania had amassed
about 10,000 troops near its northwest frontier to drive
out Ugandan President Idi Amin's forces.
The Ugandans two weeks ago invaded the annexed
about 700 square miles of Tanzanian territory between
the Kagera and the Ugandan-Tanzanian border and
blew up the Taka Bridge, the main Kagera crossing.
The Uganda Radio report, monitored here, said the
cross-river attack was made under cover of a heavy
Tanzanian artillery barrage. But it claimed the Tanza
nian soldiers were swept away "to be eaten by fish."
Conference seeks women priests
Baltimore — A Roman Catholic conference seeking
admission of women to the priesthood decided yester
day to send a delegation to Rome to make a first-hand
appeal to Pope John Paul 11.
The action was among a score of strategies and posi
tions adopted on the closing day of a three-day meeting
attended by more than 2000 Catholics from across the
country. About two-thirds of the delegates were nuns,
the others were lay women.
Calling for "free and equal access of all" to the full
range of the church's ministries, including the ordained
priesthood, they took steps to put their case before
every bishop in the nation. A delegation of the women
planned to show up Monday in Washington for the
opening of the fall meeting of the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.
Nine Iranian protesters killed
Tehran, Iran — Clashes between troops and anti
government protesters claimed nine lives in Iran's oil
belt, the Iranian news agency reported yesterday, and
oil workers defied a government deadline for ending
their crippling 13-day-old strike.
The opposition National Front Party issued a state
ment in Paris claiming another eight persons were kil
led in the city of Babol on the Caspian Sea, but that
report could not be confirmed.
A key anti-government Moslem religious leader,
meanwhile, blamed President Jimmy Carter for "com
plicating" the Iranian crisis with his support of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
The reported violence was the bloodiest since the
shah appointed a military-led government last Monday.
The months-long anti-shah campaign has been led by
Moslem clergymen opposed to the shah's westerniza
tion of this traditional Islamic society and has been
joined by political dissidents demanding democratic
reforms of his authoritarian rule.

Palestinian compromise sought
New York — The Carter administration launched a
last-ditch effort yesterday to find a compromise on the
Palestinian issue that threatened to derail a negotiated
peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
President Jimmy Carter personally intervened with
telephone calls to the leaders of both countries. He
also dispatched Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to New
York for an airport meeting with Menachem Begin,
where Vance presented the Israeli prime minister with
a new compromise draft on the volatile Palestinian
question.
However, after meeting for more than two hours,
Vance and Begin emerged with no word that Israel had
agreed to the new draft.
A top State Department official, who asked not to be
named, said Vance gave Begin and his top advisers new
"compromise language" dealing with the link between
the Egyptian-Israeli treaty and future talks on the fate of
Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territory.
Nixon speaks in southern states
Homestead Air Force Base, Fla. — His spirits high after
an enthusiastic reception on a weekend speaking trip,
former President Richard Nixon flew to Florida yester
day for a two-day holiday with close friends Bebe Rfc
bozo and Robert Abplanalp.
About 40 people clapped for Nixon as he stepped
from a private plane, the "Lucky Liz," and posed for
pictures with Air Force personnel.
Waving and smiling, Nixon then climbed into a
limousine with Rebozo, who was a neighbor of the Key
Biscayne White House, and Abplanalp.
Abplanalp, an industrialist who made a fortune with
aerosol spray cans, said Nixon would stay at the exclu
sive Ocean Reef Club in the Florida Keys.
Snow falls in Central Valley
Snow yesterday surprised the residents of Redding,
Red Bluff and Ukiah — Central Valley cities that nor
mally see none of the white stuff until January or so,
and then rarely.
The snow — which also fell as low as 600 feet in the
San Francisco Bay area — was caused by a combination
of cold arctic air from the north and moisture from the
Pacific. It dusted Mt. Diablo, east of San Francisco Bay,
and was also expected to whiten the top of Mt. Tamal
pais in Marin County to the north.
Elsewhere in the nation, after dumping more than a
foot of snow on parts of the Rocky Mountains, a storm
that has killed at least six persons spread into the
northern Great Plains on Sunday, producing more
snow, freezing rain and wintry temperatures.
Today's weather
Partial clearing today with a slight chance of showers.
Partly cloudy tonight and tomorrow. Continued cold.
Overnight lows in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in
the 50s both days. South to southwesterly winds 10 to
20 mph becoming northwesterly today.
