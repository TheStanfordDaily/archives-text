# 11 colleges propose conference

Tentative plans are being made to send as many as 20
students here to Philadelphia this winter for a "Little
Eleven Conference" designed to allow students to ex
change ideas on campus life, COP member Andrew
Coldenkranz said Friday.
Twenty representatives from 11 universities are slated
to meet during the second week in February to discuss
issues relating to student and college life.
The 11 universities are the eight Ivy League schools —
Flarvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell,
Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania — as well
as M.1.T., the University of Chicago and Stanford.
The proposal was initiated by Leonard Ginsburg, a
student at the University of Pennsylvania. In a state
ment outlining the goals of the conference, Ginsburg
listed two main objectives.
According to the statement, the major emphasis of
the conference and its organization will be on the ex
change of ideas, information, programs and perspec
tives on student issues at a "working conference." The
second goal explained by the statement is the de
velopment of informal committee reports, to be pre-

pared by committees formed at the conference, which
might "act as a starting point for student action by
individual schools."
Ginsburg invited Stanford to participate in the con
ference in the beginning of September, Goldenkranz
said. However, a final decision whether or not to par
ticipate will probably be made "within the next
month," Goldenkranz added.
Goldenkranz said the delay stems from two main
problems that are yet to be resolved. The first deals
with whether the conference is going to be worth par
ticipating in.
"It's a very ambitious project," said Goldenkranz.
"We want to be syre that the things we want to learn
are going to be included (in the conference)."
Additionally, Goldenkranz said he wanted to make
sure that the things that are learned at the conference
will benefit the entire Stanford community and not just
those representatives who attend the conference.
The other question that is as yet unsettled is whether
Stanford will be able to afford the cost of sending rep
resentatives.
