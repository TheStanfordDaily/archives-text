# CPR not required for Med School grads
## Funds sought for life support training center 
### DEBORAH FRANKLIN 
"I would personally rather have a
good, trained paramedic resuscitate
me than most physicians in this hos
pital,'' said Dr. Michael Eliastam, di
rector of Emergency Services at the
Medical Center here.
According to Eliastam, although
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) within the first three minutes'
after heart stoppage may mean the
difference between life and death
for a heart-attack victim, most doc
tors have had little practice with CPR
and other life support techniques.
Eliastam said basic life support train
ing, while not a difficult skill, needs
to be practiced to be effective.
CPR certification is not required of
doctors or medical students here for
graduation, he said.
Eliastam and Dr. ]. Kent Carman,
assistant professor of anesthesia
here, are now seeking funding and
space at the Med Center for a life
support training center.
The center would be equipped
with oscilloscopes, airway equip
ment, practical mannequins and
other advanced life support equip

ment which signal when resuscita
tion is correctly performed, accord
ing to Carman.
Carman said that such a center
could be likened to the simulation
trainers used by airline pilots.
"A physician has to go in and prac
tice these skills before he needs
them," he said, "just like a pilot
needs to prepare to handle disasters
which he hopes will never happen."
Without the realistic training that
comes from working with a manne
quin, he said, doctors can't perform
optimally in a real-life situation.
Although staff from the University
Medical School, in conjunction with
the American Red Cross and Ameri
can Heart Association, have spon
sored life support training classes
here in the past, equipment is scat
tered throughout the Hospital,
Carman said. No center exists here
where interested health profession
als can follow a self-paced "brush
up" program, he added.
Eliastam and Carman said they
plan to submit a proposal to the
Medical School Curriculum Com
mittee within a few days requesting

at least partial funding for the
$17,000 needed to convert a corridor
in the new hospital wing into a train
ing center.
After the center is open, Eliastam
said, $40,000 of new equipment and
$4000 of furnishing and carpeting
could be added as funding becomes
available, to create a better center.
Instruction would be provided by
faculty members from the Med
School, including physicians in
emergency medicine, anesthesia
and cardiology. Instructors from the
lay community would also be major
instructors in the CPR program,
Eliastam said.
The center should operate at two
educational levels, Carman said, of
fering both basic life support train
ing to laymen and giving medical
professionals the advanced skills
they need.
Vinnie Biberdorf, director of
safety programs for the Red Cross
chapter in Palo Alto, said Red Cross
equipment and facilities are insuffi
cient to handle the many community
members who want and need basic
CPR training.

"More and more, sophisticated
monitoring of patients makes it clear
that CPR is effective in saving lives,"
Biberdorf said, adding that trained
laymen are crucial in immediate
help after someone has had a heart
attack.
"The paramedics can be rolling,
but nothing works if five minutes go
by and the person isn't breathing,"
she said.
Eliastam is also seeking funding
from community service groups and
industries who could take advantage
of the training. Both space and
money are at a premium at the Med
School, he said, and outside support
may be necessary to open the
center.
A life support training center
which aims programs at advanced
and instructor levels as well as at
basic levels has never existed in
California before, Garman said.
However, similar programs in
Seattle and Miami "have de
monstrated a reduction in the death
rate of cardiac victims by about
half," Garman added.

Eliastam said basic life support train
ing, while not a difficult skill, needs
to be practiced to be effective.
CPR certification is not required of
doctors or medical students here for
graduation, he said.
Eliastam and Dr. ]. Kent Carman,
assistant professor of anesthesia
here, are now seeking funding and
space at the Med Center for a life
support training center.
The center would be equipped
with oscilloscopes, airway equip
ment, practical mannequins and
other advanced life support equip

ment which signal when resuscita
tion is correctly performed, accord
ing to Carman.
Carman said that such a center
could be likened to the simulation
trainers used by airline pilots.
"A physician has to go in and prac
tice these skills before he needs
them," he said, "just like a pilot
needs to prepare to handle disasters
which he hopes will never happen."
Without the realistic training that
comes from working with a manne
quin, he said, doctors can't perform
optimally in a real-life situation.
Although staff from the University
Medical School, in conjunction with
the American Red Cross and Ameri
can Heart Association, have spon
sored life support training classes
here in the past, equipment is scat
tered throughout the Hospital,
Carman said. No center exists here
where interested health profession
als can follow a self-paced "brush
up" program, he added.
Eliastam and Carman said they
plan to submit a proposal to the
Medical School Curriculum Com
mittee within a few days requesting

at least partial funding for the
$17,000 needed to convert a corridor
in the new hospital wing into a train
ing center.
After the center is open, Eliastam
said, $40,000 of new equipment and
$4000 of furnishing and carpeting
could be added as funding becomes
available, to create a better center.
Instruction would be provided by
faculty members from the Med
School, including physicians in
emergency medicine, anesthesia
and cardiology. Instructors from the
lay community would also be major
instructors in the CPR program,
Eliastam said.
The center should operate at two
educational levels, Carman said, of
fering both basic life support train
ing to laymen and giving medical
professionals the advanced skills
they need.
Vinnie Biberdorf, director of
safety programs for the Red Cross
chapter in Palo Alto, said Red Cross
equipment and facilities are insuffi
cient to handle the many community
members who want and need basic
CPR training.

"More and more, sophisticated
monitoring of patients makes it clear
that CPR is effective in saving lives,"
Biberdorf said, adding that trained
laymen are crucial in immediate
help after someone has had a heart
attack.
"The paramedics can be rolling,
but nothing works if five minutes go
by and the person isn't breathing,"
she said.
Eliastam is also seeking funding
from community service groups and
industries who could take advantage
of the training. Both space and
money are at a premium at the Med
School, he said, and outside support
may be necessary to open the
center.
A life support training center
which aims programs at advanced
and instructor levels as well as at
basic levels has never existed in
California before, Garman said.
However, similar programs in
Seattle and Miami "have de
monstrated a reduction in the death
rate of cardiac victims by about
half," Garman added.
"I would personally rather have a
good, trained paramedic resuscitate
me than most physicians in this hos
pital,'' said Dr. Michael Eliastam, di
rector of Emergency Services at the
Medical Center here.
According to Eliastam, although
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) within the first three minutes'
after heart stoppage may mean the
difference between life and death
for a heart-attack victim, most doc
tors have had little practice with CPR
and other life support techniques.
