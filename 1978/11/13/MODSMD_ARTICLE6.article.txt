### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Members of the ASSU Senate met
this weekend with former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark and raised
funds to further efforts to bring
former Pakistani Prime Minister Ali
Bhutto here as a guest professor.
Senate Chairperson Peter Stamos
said that the senate already has
raised more than $5000, mostly from
wealthy Pakistanis in the area, to
ward sending Rep. Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) to that country to
help free Bhutto.
News analysis
The former prime minister now is
sentenced to be executed by Pakis
tan's military government.
The senate Thursday passed a re
solution offering Bhutto a guest pro
fessorship here. McCloskey, who
had originally approached the se
nate with the proposal, promised to
do everything within his power to
seek Bhutto's release if the students
here would offer him a position,
Stamos said.
He added that McCloskey has a
standing invitation from the Pakis
tani government to discuss Bhutto's
case with officials there.

The senate also has sent more
than 200 letters to all the U.S.
senators, President |immy Carter,
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance,
former president Richard Nixon,
and other politicians seeking en
dorsements of its efforts in behalf of
Bhutto.
Clark has already stated he is be
hind the ASSU's plans.
Bhutto first came to power in 1972
after the civil war in which East
Pakistan seceded from the west to
become Bangladesh. The military,
shattered by its defeat, called on
Bhutto to lead the country, because,
according to graduate student
Michael Economides, he was a
young, charismatic, western
educated leader.
Western education
Bhutto, schooled at UC-Berkeley
and Oxford Law School, attempted
to form a new government in Pakis
tan.
Bhutto initiated land and educa
tional reforms in a country still es
sentially feudal. According to
Economides, Bhutto also tried to in
still a sense of worth in a country
embarrassed by war, and used an
appeal to the common man â€” a rar
ity on the Indian sub-continent.
The Pakistani constitution allows
that it may be changed by any leader
who wins a two-thirds majority in an
election. In 1973, Bhutto used his
mandate to try to create what
Economides called a democratic
government.
In 1977, Bhutto called for an elec
tion to reaffirm his authority. After
Bhutto's government won that elec
tion by a landslide, the opposition

faction accused it of "fixing" the
election.
Chaos ensued and Bhutto de
clared martial law. New elections
were planned for October of that
year, but in July the military over
threw Bhutto and took over the gov
ernment^
Political opponents
Bhutto was arrested and charged
with ordering the 1974 shooting that
lead to the death of the father of one
of his political opponents.
Clark called Bhutto's trial "not
fair." He added, "The acting Chief
(ustice's conduct would make ludge
Julius Hoffman in the Chicago 7 trial
a model of decorum. He publicly
commented on Bhutto's guilt out
side the courtroom before convic
tion ... he could not restrain him
self from characterizing Bhutto, who
did not present a defense, as a
'compulsive liar,' 'unruly,' 'hurling
threats as well as insults on us.' " ,
Economides argues there are two
reasons the University should at
tempt to bring Bhutto here. The first
deals with the human rights ques
tion of Bhutto's trial and conviction.
According to Clark, there were no
grounds for a trial, or a conviction,
and Bhutto should not be executed.
In addition, Economides said that
Pakistan is an unstable country in a
sensitive area. It borders the Persian
Gulf, and Iran with its huge oil de
posits. The country itself is a mixture
of traditionally hostile nationalities.
'Enormously popular'
Economides said that Bhutto is
still enormously popular in Pakistan,
and that his death would set off
