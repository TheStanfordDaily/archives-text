# 'Gaieties' renewed
## 
### RICHARD SHAMES 
"Big Game Gaieties" is back,
and if last year's success story is
any indication, it may be here to
stay.
"Gaieties," a long-time Stan
ford tradition which was revived
last year after a six-year absence,
is a completely original look at
some aspects of student life, ac
cording to Gaieties co-director
Gary Furlong. What Gaieties
specifically is can't really be said
since in the past it has ranged
from "football follies" to a spoof
on "Dracula."
Added Furlong about the
show, "Traditionally it is any
thing. Currently it is still any
thing."
This year, however, the show
will feature an actual story line
with recurring characters and a
specific plot. This approach is
contrasted with last year's
loosely-structured version which
operated on the theme "What is
Gaieties?"'
The theme of this year's show
won't be revealed until Thurs
day's opening performance. "In
evitably, the show parodies Stan
ford," explained Furlong. "But
we don't like to advertise the
theme mostly for its entertain
ment value. People go to a show
they've never seen before. Every
thing is completely original — the
music, choreography and script."
According to the student direc
tors, the show relies heavily on
the energy of its cast. Furlong
said the staff will put in close to
100 rehearsal hours before open
ing night.
Along with the cast of 50 is a
staff of 20 directors, producers,
writers and technical crew and an
orchestra of 25. Many are in

volved with Ram's Head, the pa
rent drama group which sponsors
and gives financial backing to the
show.
The tradition of "Gaieties"
dates back to the inception of
Ram's Head. As the group's first
show in 1911, "Gaieties" featured
a look at the "Football Follies," a
parody on the Ziegfeld Follies.
In succeeding years, the show
progressed to parodies and sa
tires until its demise in 1971. Ac
cording to a Daily review, the
final performance was a less than
popular parody of "Dracula"
which featured the show's theme
song "Trannsylvania" sung to the
tune of "Oklahoma."
A gradual decline in student in
terest made the 1971 show the
last one. As Furlong said, "Stu
dents then would rather throw
bricks through a window than do
a musical show."
But last year interest in the
production heightened again and
"Gaieties" made a return at
tempt. The attempt was a huge
success as rekindled student in
terest resulted in an encore per
formance.
This year's show may be
equally successful as ticket sales
for all three performances are
soaring. Furlong said he believes
the anticipation may give the al
ready enthusiastic cast even more
incentive to put on a good show.
"Many years ago, 'Gaieties' was
done in conjunction with the
bonfire and the Big Game. Now,
it's not a replacement for the Big
Game but is a revival of that tradi
tion. It is being accepted com
pletely on its own merits and
that's- what will keep it going,"
Furlong said.

tors, the show relies heavily on
the energy of its cast. Furlong
said the staff will put in close to
100 rehearsal hours before open
ing night.
Along with the cast of 50 is a
staff of 20 directors, producers,
writers and technical crew and an
orchestra of 25. Many are in

volved with Ram's Head, the pa
rent drama group which sponsors
and gives financial backing to the
show.
The tradition of "Gaieties"
dates back to the inception of
Ram's Head. As the group's first
show in 1911, "Gaieties" featured
a look at the "Football Follies," a
parody on the Ziegfeld Follies.
In succeeding years, the show
progressed to parodies and sa
tires until its demise in 1971. Ac
cording to a Daily review, the
final performance was a less than
popular parody of "Dracula"
which featured the show's theme
song "Trannsylvania" sung to the
tune of "Oklahoma."
A gradual decline in student in
terest made the 1971 show the
last one. As Furlong said, "Stu
dents then would rather throw
bricks through a window than do
a musical show."
But last year interest in the
production heightened again and
"Gaieties" made a return at
tempt. The attempt was a huge
success as rekindled student in
terest resulted in an encore per
formance.
This year's show may be
equally successful as ticket sales
for all three performances are
soaring. Furlong said he believes
the anticipation may give the al
ready enthusiastic cast even more
incentive to put on a good show.
"Many years ago, 'Gaieties' was
done in conjunction with the
bonfire and the Big Game. Now,
it's not a replacement for the Big
Game but is a revival of that tradi
tion. It is being accepted com
pletely on its own merits and
that's- what will keep it going,"
Furlong said.
"Big Game Gaieties" is back,
and if last year's success story is
any indication, it may be here to
stay.
"Gaieties," a long-time Stan
ford tradition which was revived
last year after a six-year absence,
is a completely original look at
some aspects of student life, ac
cording to Gaieties co-director
Gary Furlong. What Gaieties
specifically is can't really be said
since in the past it has ranged
from "football follies" to a spoof
on "Dracula."
Added Furlong about the
show, "Traditionally it is any
thing. Currently it is still any
thing."
This year, however, the show
will feature an actual story line
with recurring characters and a
specific plot. This approach is
contrasted with last year's
loosely-structured version which
operated on the theme "What is
Gaieties?"'
The theme of this year's show
won't be revealed until Thurs
day's opening performance. "In
evitably, the show parodies Stan
ford," explained Furlong. "But
we don't like to advertise the
theme mostly for its entertain
ment value. People go to a show
they've never seen before. Every
thing is completely original — the
music, choreography and script."
