# Experiential education found in Asia
## 
### SUKIE JACKSON 
Every Friday at noon the
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) or
ganization meets in the third
floor lounge of the Clubhouse
for "ramen lunch." For the 15
years of VlA's existence, this
lunchtime meeting has been a
favorite time for old volun
teers to share their Asian ex
periences with each other and
with new people interested in
the program. Ramen is an ap
propriate meal for the group.
This noodle and vegetable
soup can be found in most
Asian countries where VIA
volunteers live, while on the
program.
The program first started
here in 1963 when Dwight
Clark, then dean of freshmen
men in Wilbur Hall, escorted
several students through
Hong Kong. "Then, as now,"
Clark said, "people saw it as a
way to get a kind of experien
tial education not found in the
homogenized and pasteurized
atmosphere of a college cam
pus."
Since that time, the program
has blossomed under Clark's
guidance and VIA now sends
approximately 40 graduate and
undergraduate volunteers
each year to posts in Taiwan,
Indonesia, South Korea, Japan
and the Philippines. Clark
found that students "wanted
to have a chance to experience
the world as learners-workers
rather than as togrists or stu
dents" and because of this,
the program has evolved in a
unique way. "We've found a
workable means for young
Americans to burrow deeply
into a non-Western culture"
Clark said, "by working within
an Asian institution, living with
an Asian family and becoming
part of an Asian neighbor

hood."
While some appropriate
technology positions are avail
able for graduate students,
most volunteers teach English.
Undergraduates work from six
months to one year and
graduates work in two year
posts. Because of the wide var
iety of countries, cities,
families and work situations
each person's experience is
different.
Jade Barnett, a senior major
ing in international relations,
who recently returned from
Taiwan, became interested in
VIA because it combined her
academic interest in Asia with
her desire for an in-depth
cross cultural experience. "I
felt like I'd be a little more on
my own, away from academic
institutions and able to deal
with myself in a situation
without other Americans,"
Barnett said. "Also, I chose
VIA because Asia is the East. If
I think of cultural division, I
don't think of Europe and the
United States I think of East
and West. That gap is one I
wanted to be exposed to, to
learn more about and be more
aware of." Barnett lived in
Taiwan with a "well-off expor
ter's family" and worked at the
Young Men's Christian As
sociation (YMCA) there.
Living with a family and
teaching became the focal
points of her life in Taiwan.
"When I first got there it was
the hardest," she said. Classes
were still new and I wasn't in
volved. The first couple of
months, I counted the days. I
felt like I had a lot of time and
as a consequence, I read a lot.
Because I was working and
with a family though, one ac
tivity led to another and my
time was soon full and fulfil

ling."
Each day, Barnett rode her
bike to the YMCA, where she
instructed English. She then
rode home to eat meals with
her family. "We had lots of
seafood and Japanese cooking
since my Chinese grand
mother grew up during the
Japanese occupation of
Taiwan." Evenings were spent
with her older sister, or rela
tives. "My regular schedule
was teaching five days a week.
Everyday involved different ac
tivities with students, family
and my one or two American
friends. It would include
motorcycle rides to go fishing
or to the movies, or bus rides
to other cities."
Another recent volunteer,
Mark Nelson, was attracted to
VIA for different reasons. He
approached his trip to In
donesia "with the feeling that
it would be an adventure,
something interesting. Since
school was going so fast, Nel
son decided to take a year off
to work in Asia.
Nelson spent his first six
months in Bogor, a large city
on the island of Java where he
taught at the Agricultural Insti
tute. Nelson intended to travel
throughout Asia for the sec
ond six months. While in
Bogor though, he changed his
plans and decided to accept
another VIA teaching post, on
the outer island of Kalimantan.
This second post differed radi
cally from the first, Nelson
said. From Bogor, a city envi
ronment, Nelson went to a
town called Pelangkaraya, a
rural, undeveloped city in the
center of jungle-covered
Kalimantan. Nelson described
the city as "lonely. It was ac
cessible only by airplane, and
all transportation in the town
was on the river. We had in
termittent electicity and run
ning water severals hours of
the day, but it was very possi
ble to be comfortable," he ad
ded.
Nelson lived with a doctor's

family there, teaching English
classes for the Department of
Health and the small university
there. His classes met five days
a week. Nelson taught for
three hours each morning,
preparing lessons during the
early afternoon. Jogging,
spending time with the
neighbors and reading filled
his days. Pelangkaraya did not
have the cultural diversions
such as dance, music and batik
that other Indonesian cities of
fer. "I went hunting for or
chids a few times, swam in the
nearby river and went on sev
eral river trips, once on a hos
pital boat to give immuniza
tions to people who don't
have access to medical treat
ments...but mostly I visited
friends."
As his Indonesian language
skills improved, Nelson be
came more comfortable in the
small town "where everyone
knows everyone else."
"I felt at home there. I got to
know all the people at the post
office, the mayor, the people
at the food and juice stands
and I got to be friends with the
governor which was a good
opportunity to learn about the

political end of things."
Nelson also felt periods of
loneliness and frustrtion. "Go
ing from a college atmosphere
to a home in Indonesia is quite
a jump," he said. "I missed the
discussion that you can have at
Stanford with people who
have similar goals. But it is
satisfying to look back and see
what you've been through."
Perhaps it is this satisfaction
that keeps old volunteers in
terested in the VIA program,
Besides helping with recruit
ment and training of new vol
unteers, returnees have gen
erated a variety of VIA-related
projects here. Returnees Ken
Darrow and Rick Pam wrote
the Technology Source Book
which is being used in over
100 foreign nations. Volun
teers have also developed a
student guide to Asia and a
transcultural study guide.
Members of the VIA staff
can be found in the VIA office
located in the basement of the
Clubhouse. There is a general
meeting for anyone interested
in the program Wednesday
night, Nov. 15, at 7:15 p.m. in
the forum room of Meyer Un
dergraduate Library.

rather than as togrists or stu
dents" and because of this,
the program has evolved in a
unique way. "We've found a
workable means for young
Americans to burrow deeply
into a non-Western culture"
Clark said, "by working within
an Asian institution, living with
an Asian family and becoming
part of an Asian neighbor

hood."
While some appropriate
technology positions are avail
able for graduate students,
most volunteers teach English.
Undergraduates work from six
months to one year and
graduates work in two year
posts. Because of the wide var
iety of countries, cities,
families and work situations
each person's experience is
different.
Jade Barnett, a senior major
ing in international relations,
who recently returned from
Taiwan, became interested in
VIA because it combined her
academic interest in Asia with
her desire for an in-depth
cross cultural experience. "I
felt like I'd be a little more on
my own, away from academic
institutions and able to deal
with myself in a situation
without other Americans,"
Barnett said. "Also, I chose
VIA because Asia is the East. If
I think of cultural division, I
don't think of Europe and the
United States I think of East
and West. That gap is one I
wanted to be exposed to, to
learn more about and be more
aware of." Barnett lived in
Taiwan with a "well-off expor
ter's family" and worked at the
Young Men's Christian As
sociation (YMCA) there.
Living with a family and
teaching became the focal
points of her life in Taiwan.
"When I first got there it was
the hardest," she said. Classes
were still new and I wasn't in
volved. The first couple of
months, I counted the days. I
felt like I had a lot of time and
as a consequence, I read a lot.
Because I was working and
with a family though, one ac
tivity led to another and my
time was soon full and fulfil

ling."
Each day, Barnett rode her
bike to the YMCA, where she
instructed English. She then
rode home to eat meals with
her family. "We had lots of
seafood and Japanese cooking
since my Chinese grand
mother grew up during the
Japanese occupation of
Taiwan." Evenings were spent
with her older sister, or rela
tives. "My regular schedule
was teaching five days a week.
Everyday involved different ac
tivities with students, family
and my one or two American
friends. It would include
motorcycle rides to go fishing
or to the movies, or bus rides
to other cities."
Another recent volunteer,
Mark Nelson, was attracted to
VIA for different reasons. He
approached his trip to In
donesia "with the feeling that
it would be an adventure,
something interesting. Since
school was going so fast, Nel
son decided to take a year off
to work in Asia.
Nelson spent his first six
months in Bogor, a large city
on the island of Java where he
taught at the Agricultural Insti
tute. Nelson intended to travel
throughout Asia for the sec
ond six months. While in
Bogor though, he changed his
plans and decided to accept
another VIA teaching post, on
the outer island of Kalimantan.
This second post differed radi
cally from the first, Nelson
said. From Bogor, a city envi
ronment, Nelson went to a
town called Pelangkaraya, a
rural, undeveloped city in the
center of jungle-covered
Kalimantan. Nelson described
the city as "lonely. It was ac
cessible only by airplane, and
all transportation in the town
was on the river. We had in
termittent electicity and run
ning water severals hours of
the day, but it was very possi
ble to be comfortable," he ad
ded.
Nelson lived with a doctor's

family there, teaching English
classes for the Department of
Health and the small university
there. His classes met five days
a week. Nelson taught for
three hours each morning,
preparing lessons during the
early afternoon. Jogging,
spending time with the
neighbors and reading filled
his days. Pelangkaraya did not
have the cultural diversions
such as dance, music and batik
that other Indonesian cities of
fer. "I went hunting for or
chids a few times, swam in the
nearby river and went on sev
eral river trips, once on a hos
pital boat to give immuniza
tions to people who don't
have access to medical treat
ments...but mostly I visited
friends."
As his Indonesian language
skills improved, Nelson be
came more comfortable in the
small town "where everyone
knows everyone else."
"I felt at home there. I got to
know all the people at the post
office, the mayor, the people
at the food and juice stands
and I got to be friends with the
governor which was a good
opportunity to learn about the

political end of things."
Nelson also felt periods of
loneliness and frustrtion. "Go
ing from a college atmosphere
to a home in Indonesia is quite
a jump," he said. "I missed the
discussion that you can have at
Stanford with people who
have similar goals. But it is
satisfying to look back and see
what you've been through."
Perhaps it is this satisfaction
that keeps old volunteers in
terested in the VIA program,
Besides helping with recruit
ment and training of new vol
unteers, returnees have gen
erated a variety of VIA-related
projects here. Returnees Ken
Darrow and Rick Pam wrote
the Technology Source Book
which is being used in over
100 foreign nations. Volun
teers have also developed a
student guide to Asia and a
transcultural study guide.
Members of the VIA staff
can be found in the VIA office
located in the basement of the
Clubhouse. There is a general
meeting for anyone interested
in the program Wednesday
night, Nov. 15, at 7:15 p.m. in
the forum room of Meyer Un
dergraduate Library.

Every Friday at noon the
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) or
ganization meets in the third
floor lounge of the Clubhouse
for "ramen lunch." For the 15
years of VlA's existence, this
lunchtime meeting has been a
favorite time for old volun
teers to share their Asian ex
periences with each other and
with new people interested in
the program. Ramen is an ap
propriate meal for the group.
This noodle and vegetable
soup can be found in most
Asian countries where VIA
volunteers live, while on the
program.
The program first started
here in 1963 when Dwight
Clark, then dean of freshmen
men in Wilbur Hall, escorted
several students through
Hong Kong. "Then, as now,"
Clark said, "people saw it as a
way to get a kind of experien
tial education not found in the
homogenized and pasteurized
atmosphere of a college cam
pus."
Since that time, the program
has blossomed under Clark's
guidance and VIA now sends
approximately 40 graduate and
undergraduate volunteers
each year to posts in Taiwan,
Indonesia, South Korea, Japan
and the Philippines. Clark
found that students "wanted
to have a chance to experience
the world as learners-workers
rather than as togrists or stu
dents" and because of this,
the program has evolved in a
unique way. "We've found a

wanted to be exposed to, to
learn more about and be more
aware of." Barnett lived in
Taiwan with a "well-off expor
ter's family" and worked at the
Young Men's Christian As
sociation (YMCA) there.
Living with a family and
teaching became the focal
points of her life in Taiwan.
"When I first got there it was
the hardest," she said. Classes
were still new and I wasn't in
volved. The first couple of
months, I counted the days. I
felt like I had a lot of time and
as a consequence, I read a lot.
Because I was working and
with a family though, one ac
tivity led to another and my
time was soon full and fulfil

ling."
Each day, Barnett rode her
bike to the YMCA, where she
instructed English. She then
rode home to eat meals with
her family. "We had lots of
seafood and Japanese cooking
since my Chinese grand
mother grew up during the
Japanese occupation of
Taiwan." Evenings were spent
with her older sister, or rela
tives. "My regular schedule
was teaching five days a week.
Everyday involved different ac
tivities with students, family
and my one or two American
friends. It would include
motorcycle rides to go fishing
or to the movies, or bus rides
to other cities."
Another recent volunteer,
Mark Nelson, was attracted to
VIA for different reasons. He
approached his trip to In
donesia "with the feeling that
it would be an adventure,
something interesting. Since
school was going so fast, Nel
son decided to take a year off
to work in Asia.
Nelson spent his first six
months in Bogor, a large city
on the island of Java where he
taught at the Agricultural Insti
tute. Nelson intended to travel
throughout Asia for the sec
ond six months. While in
Bogor though, he changed his
plans and decided to accept
another VIA teaching post, on
the outer island of Kalimantan.
This second post differed radi
cally from the first, Nelson
said. From Bogor, a city envi
ronment, Nelson went to a
town called Pelangkaraya, a
rural, undeveloped city in the
center of jungle-covered
Kalimantan. Nelson described
the city as "lonely. It was ac
cessible only by airplane, and
all transportation in the town
was on the river. We had in
termittent electicity and run
ning water severals hours of
the day, but it was very possi
ble to be comfortable," he ad
ded.
Nelson lived with a doctor's

family there, teaching English
classes for the Department of
Health and the small university
there. His classes met five days
a week. Nelson taught for
three hours each morning,
preparing lessons during the
early afternoon. Jogging,
spending time with the
neighbors and reading filled
his days. Pelangkaraya did not
have the cultural diversions
such as dance, music and batik
that other Indonesian cities of
fer. "I went hunting for or
chids a few times, swam in the
nearby river and went on sev
eral river trips, once on a hos
pital boat to give immuniza
tions to people who don't
have access to medical treat
ments...but mostly I visited
friends."
As his Indonesian language
skills improved, Nelson be
came more comfortable in the
small town "where everyone
knows everyone else."
"I felt at home there. I got to
know all the people at the post
office, the mayor, the people
at the food and juice stands
and I got to be friends with the
governor which was a good
opportunity to learn about the

political end of things."
Nelson also felt periods of
loneliness and frustrtion. "Go
ing from a college atmosphere
to a home in Indonesia is quite
a jump," he said. "I missed the
discussion that you can have at
Stanford with people who
have similar goals. But it is
satisfying to look back and see
what you've been through."
Perhaps it is this satisfaction
that keeps old volunteers in
terested in the VIA program,
Besides helping with recruit
ment and training of new vol
unteers, returnees have gen
erated a variety of VIA-related
projects here. Returnees Ken
Darrow and Rick Pam wrote
the Technology Source Book
which is being used in over
100 foreign nations. Volun
teers have also developed a
student guide to Asia and a
transcultural study guide.
Members of the VIA staff
can be found in the VIA office
located in the basement of the
Clubhouse. There is a general
meeting for anyone interested
in the program Wednesday
night, Nov. 15, at 7:15 p.m. in
the forum room of Meyer Un

Every Friday at noon the
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) or
ganization meets in the third
floor lounge of the Clubhouse
for "ramen lunch." For the 15
years of VlA's existence, this
lunchtime meeting has been a
favorite time for old volun
teers to share their Asian ex
periences with each other and
with new people interested in
the program. Ramen is an ap
propriate meal for the group.
This noodle and vegetable
soup can be found in most
Asian countries where VIA
volunteers live, while on the
program.
The program first started
here in 1963 when Dwight
Clark, then dean of freshmen
men in Wilbur Hall, escorted
several students through
Hong Kong. "Then, as now,"
Clark said, "people saw it as a
way to get a kind of experien
tial education not found in the
homogenized and pasteurized
atmosphere of a college cam
pus."
Since that time, the program
has blossomed under Clark's
guidance and VIA now sends
approximately 40 graduate and
undergraduate volunteers
each year to posts in Taiwan,
Indonesia, South Korea, Japan
and the Philippines. Clark
found that students "wanted
to have a chance to experience
the world as learners-workers
rather than as togrists or stu
dents" and because of this,
the program has evolved in a
unique way. "We've found a
workable means for young
Americans to burrow deeply
into a non-Western culture"
Clark said, "by working within
an Asian institution, living with
an Asian family and becoming
part of an Asian neighbor

hood."
While some appropriate
technology positions are avail
able for graduate students,
most volunteers teach English.
Undergraduates work from six
months to one year and
graduates work in two year
posts. Because of the wide var
iety of countries, cities,
families and work situations
each person's experience is
different.
Jade Barnett, a senior major
ing in international relations,
who recently returned from
Taiwan, became interested in
VIA because it combined her
academic interest in Asia with
her desire for an in-depth
cross cultural experience. "I
felt like I'd be a little more on
my own, away from academic
institutions and able to deal
with myself in a situation
without other Americans,"
Barnett said. "Also, I chose
VIA because Asia is the East. If
I think of cultural division, I
don't think of Europe and the
United States I think of East
and West. That gap is one I
wanted to be exposed to, to
learn more about and be more

or to the movies, or bus rides
to other cities."
Another recent volunteer,
Mark Nelson, was attracted to
VIA for different reasons. He
approached his trip to In
donesia "with the feeling that
it would be an adventure,
something interesting. Since
school was going so fast, Nel
son decided to take a year off
to work in Asia.
Nelson spent his first six
months in Bogor, a large city
on the island of Java where he
taught at the Agricultural Insti
tute. Nelson intended to travel
throughout Asia for the sec
ond six months. While in
Bogor though, he changed his
plans and decided to accept
another VIA teaching post, on
the outer island of Kalimantan.
This second post differed radi
cally from the first, Nelson
said. From Bogor, a city envi
ronment, Nelson went to a
town called Pelangkaraya, a
rural, undeveloped city in the
center of jungle-covered
Kalimantan. Nelson described
the city as "lonely. It was ac
cessible only by airplane, and
all transportation in the town
was on the river. We had in
termittent electicity and run
ning water severals hours of
the day, but it was very possi
ble to be comfortable," he ad
ded.
Nelson lived with a doctor's

family there, teaching English
classes for the Department of
Health and the small university
there. His classes met five days
a week. Nelson taught for
three hours each morning,
preparing lessons during the
early afternoon. Jogging,
spending time with the
neighbors and reading filled
his days. Pelangkaraya did not
have the cultural diversions
such as dance, music and batik
that other Indonesian cities of
fer. "I went hunting for or
chids a few times, swam in the
nearby river and went on sev
eral river trips, once on a hos
pital boat to give immuniza
tions to people who don't
have access to medical treat
ments...but mostly I visited
friends."
As his Indonesian language
skills improved, Nelson be
came more comfortable in the
small town "where everyone
knows everyone else."
"I felt at home there. I got to
know all the people at the post
office, the mayor, the people
at the food and juice stands
and I got to be friends with the
governor which was a good
opportunity to learn about the

political end of things."
Nelson also felt periods of
loneliness and frustrtion. "Go
ing from a college atmosphere
to a home in Indonesia is quite
a jump," he said. "I missed the
discussion that you can have at
Stanford with people who
have similar goals. But it is
satisfying to look back and see
what you've been through."
Perhaps it is this satisfaction
that keeps old volunteers in
terested in the VIA program,
Besides helping with recruit
ment and training of new vol
unteers, returnees have gen
erated a variety of VIA-related
projects here. Returnees Ken
Darrow and Rick Pam wrote
the Technology Source Book
which is being used in over
100 foreign nations. Volun
teers have also developed a
student guide to Asia and a
transcultural study guide.
Members of the VIA staff
can be found in the VIA office
located in the basement of the
Clubhouse. There is a general
meeting for anyone interested
in the program Wednesday
night, Nov. 15, at 7:15 p.m. in
the forum room of Meyer Un
dergraduate Library.
