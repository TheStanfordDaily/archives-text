# University begins disruption inquiry
## Student role at speech on Iran by Zabih to be investigated 
### TONY RUPERT 
The University has begun an in
vestigation to determine whether
the campus disruption policy was
violated when Sepehr Zabih was
prevented from speaking Oct. 24,
according to John Schwartz, Univer
sity counsel.
Schwartz said he has appointed a
law student to investigate whether
any Stanford students were involved
and what roles they may have taken
in the alleged disruption.
Zabih, chairman of the govern
ment department of St. Mary's Col
lege, had been asked by Bechtel In
ternational Center director Lee
Ziegler to speak at the noon lunc
heon series.
According to a Daily report, Zabih
was prevented from delivering his
talk by continuous questioning from
several persons. After 20 minutes,
Ziegler decided to cancel the
speech.
Apology made
"I wrote a letter to Mr. Zabih, tel
ling him that I was sorry that he was
unable to continue his talk," Ziegler
said. Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter said that as far as she knew
the University officially has not de
cided to apologize to Zabih.
Mitch Hall, foreign student ad
viser at the l-Center, said the center
would try to present another forum
on politics in Iran. "We hope to col
laborate with the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, New Directions and the In
ternational Relations Society to pro
duce a symposium on the problems
in Iran for sometime around Dec.
1," Hall said.
Schwartz said that, based on the
results of the preliminary investiga
tion, the president's office will de
cide whether to file charges against
any students.
Alternatives
If charges are filed, Schwartz said
each student could choice to go be
fore the dean of students or the
Stanford Judicial Council. The dean
of students can refuse to hear the
case.
Under the campus disruption pol
icy, a student violates University pol
icy if he "prevents or disrupts the
effective carrying out of a University
function or approved activity, such
as lectures, meetings. . . ."
The legislative and judicial charter

provides for penalties from censure
to expulsion. These can be set in
accord with the nature and serious
ness of the offense.
A student representative of the
Iranian Students and Cultural Soci
ety (ISCA), who asked to remain un
identified, said audience members
involved were reluctant to let Zabih
speak because they believed he
supported Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi. The representative said he
based this opinion on what he called
pro-shah newspaper article that
Zabih wrote for an Iranian news
paper, a book written by Zabih
which he believes was pro-shah, an
alleged visit by Zabih's to the shah
on the 2500 anniversary celebration
of monarchical rule in Iran, and
speeches that Zabih has made in the
area.
Zabih's reply
Zabih called these charges "abso
lute nonsense." He challenged any
one to produce a pro-shah news
paper article written by him and de
nied that he attended the anniver
sary celebration.
"I did not go, and would not have
gone had I been invited. I am not
pro-shah," he said.
Zabih said that his book, The
Communist Movement in Iran, was
critical of the pro-Soviet movement
in Iran but did not deal with whether
the shah should stay in power.
"In fact," he said, "it was banned
in Iran for several years."
The ISCA representative said that
whether Zabih was pro-shah is im
material. "We agree that Zabih had a
right to speak," he said, "but we
believe that the University had an
obligation to show the audience
what his viewpoint was before he
spoke.
"There are two radically different
views of what is going on in Iran
today, the shah's view and the
people's view," he said. "The
people want democracy; they want
the shah out. The shah, on the other
hand, is carrying out massacres in
the street to hold onto his monar
chy.
"Meanwhile, the only news that
seems to filter through the Western
press is from the shah's view — that
the shah is trying to modernize his
country but is being opposed by
fanatic religious leaders.
"We felt that before Zabih's talk
could be of any value to the Stanford
community, he would have to say
which story he believed, the shah's
or the people's," the ISCA represen
tative said.

A student representative of the
Iranian Students and Cultural Soci
ety (ISCA), who asked to remain un
identified, said audience members
involved were reluctant to let Zabih
speak because they believed he
supported Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi. The representative said he
based this opinion on what he called
pro-shah newspaper article that
Zabih wrote for an Iranian news
paper, a book written by Zabih
which he believes was pro-shah, an
alleged visit by Zabih's to the shah
on the 2500 anniversary celebration
of monarchical rule in Iran, and
speeches that Zabih has made in the
area.
Zabih's reply
Zabih called these charges "abso
lute nonsense." He challenged any
one to produce a pro-shah news
paper article written by him and de
nied that he attended the anniver
sary celebration.
"I did not go, and would not have
gone had I been invited. I am not
pro-shah," he said.
Zabih said that his book, The
Communist Movement in Iran, was
critical of the pro-Soviet movement
in Iran but did not deal with whether
the shah should stay in power.
"In fact," he said, "it was banned
in Iran for several years."
The ISCA representative said that
whether Zabih was pro-shah is im
material. "We agree that Zabih had a
right to speak," he said, "but we
believe that the University had an
obligation to show the audience
what his viewpoint was before he
spoke.
"There are two radically different
views of what is going on in Iran
today, the shah's view and the
people's view," he said. "The
people want democracy; they want
the shah out. The shah, on the other
hand, is carrying out massacres in
the street to hold onto his monar
chy.
"Meanwhile, the only news that
seems to filter through the Western
press is from the shah's view — that
the shah is trying to modernize his
country but is being opposed by
fanatic religious leaders.
"We felt that before Zabih's talk
could be of any value to the Stanford
community, he would have to say
which story he believed, the shah's
or the people's," the ISCA represen
tative said.
The University has begun an in
vestigation to determine whether
the campus disruption policy was
violated when Sepehr Zabih was
prevented from speaking Oct. 24,
according to John Schwartz, Univer
sity counsel.
Schwartz said he has appointed a
law student to investigate whether
any Stanford students were involved
and what roles they may have taken
in the alleged disruption.
Zabih, chairman of the govern
ment department of St. Mary's Col
lege, had been asked by Bechtel In
ternational Center director Lee
Ziegler to speak at the noon lunc
heon series.
According to a Daily report, Zabih
was prevented from delivering his
talk by continuous questioning from
several persons. After 20 minutes,
Ziegler decided to cancel the
speech.
Apology made
"I wrote a letter to Mr. Zabih, tel
ling him that I was sorry that he was
unable to continue his talk," Ziegler
said. Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter said that as far as she knew
the University officially has not de
