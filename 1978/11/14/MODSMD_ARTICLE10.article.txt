## ASSU project recycles campus waste 
### NEIL MacFARQUHAR 
He helps collect 65 to 70
bins of trash each week. With
this he can help earn nearly
$700 per month. He is Arthur,
the Toyota truck of the ASSU
Recycling Project and the
symbol of its recent success.
Since it was started last
January, the recycling center
has doubled in size, and re
cently added Steve Mentor to
its staff as a public awareness
officer.
"It is the most ambitious
and potentially productive
project ever undertaken by
the Stanford student body,"
Mentor said.
In addition to 30 to 40 stu
dent volunteers in dorms, the
project now has 12 staff
people and two student co
ordinators, Lisa Joyce and Jeff
Ryan. They maintain the 500-

some bins throughout the
campus.
Each month they collect 75
tons of aluminum, 30 tons of
paper, 10 tons of glass, two to
three thousand wine bottles,
and a small amount of bi
metal.
"People also seem to think
we're a general thrift organiza
tion since they donate books,
shirts, pants and even under
wear to the bins," Mentor
commented.
Public awareness
According to Mentor, the in
itial stage of establishing an ef
ficient service of pick-ups and
drop-ins of recyclable mate
rials and of maintaining stu
dent participation has been
successful.
His hiring represents the
second stage of working to
wards public awareness.
Mentor, a former graduate

student in English literature
here, was hired with Com
prehensive Education Training
Act (CETA) funds to establish
an outreach program. CETA is
a federal program which sub
sidizes work-study projects.
By speaking before classes,
writing flyers and sending let
ters to the faculty, Mentor said
he hopes to make the "recycl
ing more visible and to get
Stanford to be proud of it. The
three new R's are recycle, re
duce and reuse."
'Room for expansion'
Mentor is paid $414 every
two weeks for the program
and future projects. Mentor'
said he believes there is lots of
room for expansion. Staff
members would like to get a
service covering the whole
University, including hard-to
get-to offices, the Medical
Center, and a more efficient

collection system in the
dorms.
"Stanford generates 11,000
tons of trash per year, a large
part of which could be recy
cled," said Mentor.
They would also like to buy
a second truck, "a friend for
Arthur." The purchase of a
cardboard baler would allow
workers to recycle waste from
the Bookstore and food ser
vices.
SWOPSI course
This winter ASSU Recycling
is involved with a SWOPSI
course being taught by former
student here and project
founder Bob Wenzlau.
loyce said the course would
focus on consumerism and
consumption, and that most of
the recycling staff will be in
volved with the course.
Recycling started last
january with a grant from the
ASSU. Most of this money, in
addition to a loan from the
University, went toward buy
ing Arthur, constructing the
buildings, and paving and
fencing the center ASSU Re
cycling maintains on Pampas
Lane.
Various companies in the
Bay Area collect the recyclable
material from the center. The
Pioneer Paper Company pays
$28 per ton of newspaper

which it uses to make low
grade cardboard.
ENCORE, an environmen
talist group in Berkeley, pays
them 3 cents per wine bottle,
and then returns the bottles to
the local wineries.
Glass, bottles
Broken glass nets $16 per
ton and is used by the
Fresno-based Circo Class
Company to make new wine
bottles. The Olympia and
Coors Breweries each pay a
penny for their own unbroken
bottles and Coors collects the
aluminum for $340 a ton to
make low grade aluminum
parts.
Recently the project started
to sell computer paper which
goes for $80 per ton. Mentor
said the recycling center is not
working for a profit but is sim
ply trying to break even.
According to Mentor the
previous recycling projects,
including the Peninsula Re
cycling Organization, failed
because they did not have
long-term resources and failed
to get a space commitment
from the University.
He said he feels ASSU Re
cycling is successful not only
because of student involve
ment, but because the center
is working to "change
people's lives, to educate
them on ecology."


An ASSU recycling staff member loads another bin of recyclable material onto the pick-up truck staff
members have named Arthur. The center recycles more than 100 tons of aluminum, paper and glass
each month from campus dormitories and departments.

The recycling center located on Pampas Lane behind the police
station is the sorting center for most of the material collected from
campus. From there various Bay Area companies pay for most
products by the ton, reconverting the used waste into new bottles,
low-grade cardboard and aluminum parts.
