## Editorial Ali Bhutto and Stanford 
### 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former prime
minister of Pakistan, is currently in jail in that
country under a sentence of death. In a
sham of a trial, he was convicted of conspi
racy to murder a political rival in 1974. Few
persons would drsagree that his basic
human rights are being violated by the cur
rent military government of that country.
Here, at Stanford, Rep Pete McCloskey
told Michael Economides, a graduate stu
dent in petroleum engineering, that if the
University would offer Bhutto an adjunct
professorship, McCloskey would do every
thing he could to ensure safe transport for
Bhutto from Pakistan to Stanford.
When contacted about the situation by
Economides and several members of the
ASSU Senate, President Richard Lyman said
offering Bhutto an adjunct professorship
was Out of the question but agreed with
them that an ASSU guest professorship
might be in order, tyinan "tacitly" endorsed
the efforts to bring Bhutto here .is a guest
professor.
The next day, after talking to McCloskey,
Lyman told Senate Chairperson Pete Stamos
he fully supported the senate's efforts. After
as much research as could be hoped for in
the next 56 hours, the senate approved the
resolution to bring Bhutto here.
The reason for the unusually rapid series
of actions by the senate was the fear that
Bhutto's execution was impending
The efficiency and hard work surrounding
the senate's action are admirable and merit
applause. At no time in recent memory has
the senate taken such initiative and worked
so diligently for any cause. We can only
hope ths is a sign of things to come from the
ASSU Senate.
This particular case, however, was one
that should have been considered much
more carefully before rushing into a compli
cated, internationally significant case such
as this.
Beyond a doubt, Bhutto's educational and
academic background indicate he would be
a worthy addition to the laculty here. But
while prime minister of Pakistan, Bhutto was
hardly a champion of human rights himself.
His time in office was marred by charges of
eliminating his political opponents, rigging
the 1977 national elections and ruthlessly
dealing with instances of widespread popu
lar discontent.
In short, his actions .is the nation's leader
hardly meshed with his political theory and
rhetoric. It would be a kit k in the fare to the
thousands of Pakistanis lie treated horribly
to bring him here in the name of human
rights.
Human rights for the rich and powerful

hamper efforts to bring all the oppressed
peoples in the world into relative personal
safety and dignity. Bhutto doesn't need our
help. And inviting him here after the inhu
man acts he committed hurts the cause of
human rights for those who truly need it.
On a more practical level, the senate
should ask itself whether Bhutto's execution
is at all probable. There is sufficient popular
support for him at this time that his execu
tion would push the country into civil war,
according to many Pakistanians. Even the
persons pushing the senate's efforts agree
that there is little chance Bhutto will be exe
cuted. It would simply be political suicide
for the current government.
Another consideration is whether Bhutto
should be encouraged to leave his country,
thus playing into the hands of the govern
ment, which would then happily be without
its foremost opponent, having avoided the
possible effects of eliminating him itself.
The senate should realize that it is not
simply dealing with one man's iife in this
instance; the fate of millions of Pakistanis is
at hand. This is certainly not a case for im
pulsive decision making.
And last, do any of us want to see Stanford
become a home for dissidents whom indi
vidual congressmen find politically advan
tagious to bring to the United States? We
think not.
The very thought of McCloskey riding into
Pakistan as a white knight to save Bhutto's
life in the name of Stanford is ludicrous. If
this country is willing to grant him asylum
and the ASSU or the University sub
sequently were to hire Bhutto, it would be a
different story. But the senate should be
wary of accepting any politician's reasoning
for initiating a situation such as this one.
McCloskey has protected himself master
fully. It the effort succeeds, McCloskey is a
savior; if it fails, he can take pride in trying
to help Stanford's student government in a
worthy cause. There is no skin off his back
either way.
Bhutto might make a fine professor, but to
bring him here in the name of human rights
is an insult to thousands of Pakistanis. An
educator's teaching can be separated from
his political or social beliefs. But one's ac
tions are not so remote. The thought of invit
ing the Shah of Iran or Idi Amin here to
teach what they have learned of Machiavel
lian politics is absurd. So too is the case of
Bhutto.
We strongly urge the senate to rescind its
invitation to Bhutto. A little mud in its face
now will be nothing compared with the sky
falling on its head later if Bhutto does come
here.
