# Minority Editorial
## 
### 
We, a minority of the editorial board,
support the recent resolution by the ASSU
Senate which extends a guest professorship
to former Pakistani prime minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto.
The senate acted commendably within the
imposed time limit. Given approximately 16
hours to research a figure ot such controver
sial international stature as Bhutto, the se
nate investigated a remarkable number of
the case's angles. Senate members heard
opinions from both sides of the issue.
This does not mean that we endorse
Bhutto the politician. In this regard we draw
the same distinction as the senate. Bhutto's
political record is less than exemplary, lack
ing the moral integrity ot many other politi
cal prisoners in other countries. But lie is a
leading political figure who has been denied
even the most basic right of a fair trial, and
he now faces execution. The non-partisan
group Amnesty International, which con
demned Bhutto for some of his at tions while
in power, has endorsed the senate's action
as a non-violent method of helping a politi
cal prisoner.
The senate has continued to solicit feed
back even after passing the resolution, in
cluding sending more than 200 letters to inf
luential figures such as President |immy Car
ter, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Gov.
]erry Brown. The senate's actions would in
dicate that the members have in no way
closed their minds on the issue.

We are concerned, however, that the se
nate and Stanford in general have been used
as a political tool. The senate did not initiate
this project of international magnitude;
rather, it was approached by Rep. Pete
McCloskey and asked to consider his prop
osal. The amount of investigation and ques
tioning carried out by the senate under the
given time pressure was remarkable, but the
whole process was somewhat hurried.
Bhutto is a man of academic orientation,
and thus the senate believes it is offering the
guest professorship in the interest of the
student body. Certainly this action would
not have received the endorsement of Pres
ident Richard Lyman if the repercussions of
Bhutto's coming here would have a negative
effect on the University community.
Bhutto is not being offered a position to
teach a class in human rights. The senate
was instead extending the same freedom
which allowed other professors from diverse
and controversial viewpoints, such as Wil
liam Shockley, electrical engineering pro
fessor, and Alexander Kerensky, former
Russian leader, to teach here.
The senate, in our minds, was trying to
provide a political prisoner with a viable al
ternative to the unjust situation in Pakistan.
We support this endeavor.
