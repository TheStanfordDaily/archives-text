## Guest professorship offer 
### 
"The action taken by the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University is deeply
gratifying to all who hope for freedom and
dignity. The vision and initiative of the
student leadership in reaching across the
world to save life and seek peace offers
hope for the future."
Ramsey Clark
On Thursday, Nov. 9, the ASSU Senate
unanimously adopted a resolution urging
the offering of a guest professorship to
Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Prime
Minister of Pakistan, who is currently
under arrest on questionable charges of
conspiracy to murder. The proposal re
ceived the support of President Richard
Lyman and was immediately accepted by
the Guest Professorship Board.
Why is the senate delving into such
matters of international concern? Why,
especially when most of the senators ran
on a "back to basics" campaign? The
answer is clear when we analyze the
manner, magnitude and urgency of the
issue at hand. Necessity calls for a justifi
cation and defense of the senate's action.
Last Tuesday Rep. Pete McCloskey ap
proached the senate via graduate student
Michael Economides with the following
proposal: That the senate seek to gain the
support of the administration and the
student body in offering a guest profes
sorship to Bhutto and that subsequent to
such action he would personally make
any and all efforts to negotiate with the
Pakistani government to ensure the safety
of Bhutto.
That evening I met with several
senators to discuss the implications and
possible ramifications of this proposal.
First of all, we had to decide if this was a
question concerning the students at the
Univeristy — was it within the jurisdiction
of the senate? And second, we had to
decide if the issue warranted our concern
— was it significant from the perspective
of an educational institution in a free soc
iety? Our initial response to both ques
tions was enthusiastically affirmative, and
we decided to pursue the case because it
1) provided us the possibility of obtaining
a well qualified professor for the Univer
sity community, and 2) afforded us the
opportunity to support the efforts of such
men as Pete McCloskey, George Bush,
Sen. Alan Cranston and Ramsey Clark in
their pursuit to protect human rights.
An issue of such magnitude necessi
tated further research before any viable
alternatives or positions could be taken,
and at the same time we had to deal with a
limited time framework. Bhutto is cur
rently pending execution as a political
prisoner, perhaps within a week. Thus we
sought details on Bhutto's record both

academically and politically, as well as on
the case calling for his execution. Short
term student task forces were estab
lished, professors both here and
elsewhere were contacted and feedback
was elicited from organizations and indi
viduals throughout the country, including
Amnesty International, Henry Kissinger
and Ramsey Clark. The senators involved
in the research tried to utilize existing
University sources, relying on friends, fa
culty and groups (such as Stanford New
Directions) as well as several hours of in
dependent research in our own library
system. We knew that any decision would
have to be an informed one, and given
our time limitation, the research results
were most encouragingly thorough.
We obtained copies of letters, state
ments and articles written by Rep.
McCloskey, Sen. Cranston, George
Bush and the Pakastani Ambassador. We
also received copies of an affidavit by
Bhutto's son on the case, a letter from the
faculty and administration of Berkeley
and an article by Ramsey Clark written on
his return from Pakistan which was placed
in the Congressional Record. Countless
news jand opinion articles were re
searched and reviewed from both pro and
anti-Bhutto sources.
Our research reaffirmed our initial re
sponse. It appeared clear to us that first,
Bhutto is a man of considerable academic
and individual character and worth, and
second, he was being denied due process
of law, a fair trial and in a phrase — basic
human rights. The evidence we later
gained served to strengthen this position.
We discovered that Bhutto would easily
be qualified to teach courses in interna
tional law, political science, history and
international relations at the University.
He graduated with honors in political sci
ence at Berkeley, where he recently re
ceived the Haas award for outstanding
contributions of an alumni to his native
country. He received his law degree from
Oxford University and has taught interna
tional law at South Hampton University in
England. His experience is based on over
20 years in the upper levels of the Pakas
tani government including terms as its
president and later as its first elected
prime minister. He has played an instru
mental role in international politics as
evidenced by the assistance he rendered
in providing the preliminary contacts
leading to former president Richard Ni
xon's first visit to China. Clark states, "It
has been conceded by friend and foe
alike that Bhutto is keenly intelligent,
popular and charismatic, " leading to his
international reputation as the "scholarly
statesman."

Our research and our communication
with Ramsey Clark, Amnesty International
and others made it evident to us that
Bhutto has been falsely accused, ques
tionably tried and ruthlessly condemned
on unwarranted charges of conspiracy to
murder. The testimony against Bhutto
was according to Clark, "contradicted by
ballistics and other physical evidence and
(was) absolutely uncorroborated by an
eyewitness."
rhe evidence unmistakably indicates
that AM Bhutto's trial was blatant denial of
the full accordance of justice and human
rights.
Members of the ASSU senate and the
student body met with Clark three days
ago to ask his advice and gauge his re
sponse to our action. He served to
strengthen our conviction that our offer is
a viable and worthwhile alternative. We
have also sent letters to over 200 individu
als and groups, eliciting their sugges
tions.
We feel that the effect of Rep. McClos
key's personal appearance in Pakistan
may provide the necessary leverage to
facilitate Bhutto's release. Whether
Bhutto will someday be released and al
lowed to teach at the University remains
to be seen; regardless, we feel the effort
must be made.
We are not, by this action, making a
statement of support for the policy or past
actions of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto; we are,
however, stating our support for human
rights, and in the spirit of education —
freedom of speech, expression and
thought.
We feel that this is an issue which di
rectly affects the concerns and interests
of the students of the University, that the
magnitude of this humanitarian question
before us cuts across traditional political
barriers and that (quoting from the se
nate's resolution), "Stanford University,
as one of the most respected and influen
tial educational institutions in the world,
must pursue this opportunity to manifest
its deep commitment to human rights and
their importance to world freedom."
The ASSU has therefore chosen, in this
particular case, to step outside the realm
of local political events and offer a guest
professorship to a political prisoner, Zul
fikar Ali Bhutto. It is our hope that it is an
accurate expression of the student body's
concern for, as the resolution states, "the
fundamental importance of judicial free
dom and human rights to the pursuit of
liberty, educational enlightenment and
the integrity of individual expression."

system. We knew that any decision would
have to be an informed one, and given
our time limitation, the research results
were most encouragingly thorough.
We obtained copies of letters, state
ments and articles written by Rep.
McCloskey, Sen. Cranston, George
Bush and the Pakastani Ambassador. We
also received copies of an affidavit by
Bhutto's son on the case, a letter from the
faculty and administration of Berkeley
and an article by Ramsey Clark written on
his return from Pakistan which was placed
in the Congressional Record. Countless
news jand opinion articles were re
searched and reviewed from both pro and
anti-Bhutto sources.
Our research reaffirmed our initial re
sponse. It appeared clear to us that first,
Bhutto is a man of considerable academic
and individual character and worth, and
second, he was being denied due process
of law, a fair trial and in a phrase — basic
human rights. The evidence we later
gained served to strengthen this position.
We discovered that Bhutto would easily
be qualified to teach courses in interna
tional law, political science, history and
international relations at the University.
He graduated with honors in political sci
ence at Berkeley, where he recently re
ceived the Haas award for outstanding
contributions of an alumni to his native
country. He received his law degree from
Oxford University and has taught interna
tional law at South Hampton University in
England. His experience is based on over
20 years in the upper levels of the Pakas
tani government including terms as its
president and later as its first elected
prime minister. He has played an instru
mental role in international politics as
evidenced by the assistance he rendered
in providing the preliminary contacts
leading to former president Richard Ni
xon's first visit to China. Clark states, "It
has been conceded by friend and foe
alike that Bhutto is keenly intelligent,
popular and charismatic, " leading to his
international reputation as the "scholarly
statesman."

Our research and our communication
with Ramsey Clark, Amnesty International
and others made it evident to us that
Bhutto has been falsely accused, ques
tionably tried and ruthlessly condemned
on unwarranted charges of conspiracy to
murder. The testimony against Bhutto
was according to Clark, "contradicted by
ballistics and other physical evidence and
(was) absolutely uncorroborated by an
eyewitness."
rhe evidence unmistakably indicates
that AM Bhutto's trial was blatant denial of
the full accordance of justice and human
rights.
Members of the ASSU senate and the
student body met with Clark three days
ago to ask his advice and gauge his re
sponse to our action. He served to
strengthen our conviction that our offer is
a viable and worthwhile alternative. We
have also sent letters to over 200 individu
als and groups, eliciting their sugges
tions.
We feel that the effect of Rep. McClos
key's personal appearance in Pakistan
may provide the necessary leverage to
facilitate Bhutto's release. Whether
Bhutto will someday be released and al
lowed to teach at the University remains
to be seen; regardless, we feel the effort
must be made.
We are not, by this action, making a
statement of support for the policy or past
actions of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto; we are,
however, stating our support for human
rights, and in the spirit of education —
freedom of speech, expression and
thought.
We feel that this is an issue which di
rectly affects the concerns and interests
of the students of the University, that the
magnitude of this humanitarian question
before us cuts across traditional political
barriers and that (quoting from the se
nate's resolution), "Stanford University,
as one of the most respected and influen
tial educational institutions in the world,
must pursue this opportunity to manifest
its deep commitment to human rights and
their importance to world freedom."
The ASSU has therefore chosen, in this
particular case, to step outside the realm
of local political events and offer a guest
professorship to a political prisoner, Zul
fikar Ali Bhutto. It is our hope that it is an
accurate expression of the student body's
concern for, as the resolution states, "the
fundamental importance of judicial free
dom and human rights to the pursuit of
liberty, educational enlightenment and
the integrity of individual expression."

Ramsey Clark
On Thursday, Nov. 9, the ASSU Senate
unanimously adopted a resolution urging
the offering of a guest professorship to
Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Prime
Minister of Pakistan, who is currently
under arrest on questionable charges of
conspiracy to murder. The proposal re
ceived the support of President Richard
Lyman and was immediately accepted by
the Guest Professorship Board.
Why is the senate delving into such
matters of international concern? Why,
especially when most of the senators ran
on a "back to basics" campaign? The
answer is clear when we analyze the
manner, magnitude and urgency of the
issue at hand. Necessity calls for a justifi
cation and defense of the senate's action.
Last Tuesday Rep. Pete McCloskey ap
proached the senate via graduate student
Michael Economides with the following
proposal: That the senate seek to gain the
support of the administration and the
student body in offering a guest profes
sorship to Bhutto and that subsequent to
such action he would personally make
any and all efforts to negotiate with the
Pakistani government to ensure the safety
of Bhutto.
That evening I met with several
senators to discuss the implications and
possible ramifications of this proposal.
First of all, we had to decide if this was a
question concerning the students at the
Univeristy — was it within the jurisdiction
of the senate? And second, we had to
decide if the issue warranted our concern
— was it significant from the perspective
of an educational institution in a free soc
iety? Our initial response to both ques
tions was enthusiastically affirmative, and
we decided to pursue the case because it
1) provided us the possibility of obtaining
a well qualified professor for the Univer
sity community, and 2) afforded us the
opportunity to support the efforts of such
men as Pete McCloskey, George Bush,
Sen. Alan Cranston and Ramsey Clark in
their pursuit to protect human rights.
An issue of such magnitude necessi
tated further research before any viable
alternatives or positions could be taken,
and at the same time we had to deal with a
limited time framework. Bhutto is cur
rently pending execution as a political
prisoner, perhaps within a week. Thus we
sought details on Bhutto's record both

academically and politically, as well as on
the case calling for his execution. Short
term student task forces were estab
lished, professors both here and
elsewhere were contacted and feedback
was elicited from organizations and indi
viduals throughout the country, including
Amnesty International, Henry Kissinger
and Ramsey Clark. The senators involved
in the research tried to utilize existing
University sources, relying on friends, fa
culty and groups (such as Stanford New
Directions) as well as several hours of in
dependent research in our own library
system. We knew that any decision would
have to be an informed one, and given
our time limitation, the research results
were most encouragingly thorough.

lowed to teach at the University remains
to be seen; regardless, we feel the effort
must be made.
We are not, by this action, making a
statement of support for the policy or past
actions of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto; we are,
however, stating our support for human
rights, and in the spirit of education —
freedom of speech, expression and
thought.
We feel that this is an issue which di
rectly affects the concerns and interests
of the students of the University, that the
magnitude of this humanitarian question
before us cuts across traditional political
barriers and that (quoting from the se
nate's resolution), "Stanford University,
as one of the most respected and influen
tial educational institutions in the world,
must pursue this opportunity to manifest
its deep commitment to human rights and
their importance to world freedom."
The ASSU has therefore chosen, in this
particular case, to step outside the realm
of local political events and offer a guest
professorship to a political prisoner, Zul
fikar Ali Bhutto. It is our hope that it is an
accurate expression of the student body's
concern for, as the resolution states, "the
fundamental importance of judicial free
dom and human rights to the pursuit of
liberty, educational enlightenment and
the integrity of individual expression."

"The action taken by the Associated Stu

gratifying to all who hope for freedom and

On Thursday, Nov. 9, the ASSU Senate
unanimously adopted a resolution urging
the offering of a guest professorship to
Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Prime
Minister of Pakistan, who is currently
under arrest on questionable charges of
conspiracy to murder. The proposal re
ceived the support of President Richard
Lyman and was immediately accepted by
the Guest Professorship Board.
Why is the senate delving into such
matters of international concern? Why,
especially when most of the senators ran
on a "back to basics" campaign? The
answer is clear when we analyze the
manner, magnitude and urgency of the
issue at hand. Necessity calls for a justifi
cation and defense of the senate's action.
Last Tuesday Rep. Pete McCloskey ap
proached the senate via graduate student
Michael Economides with the following
proposal: That the senate seek to gain the
support of the administration and the
student body in offering a guest profes
sorship to Bhutto and that subsequent to
such action he would personally make
any and all efforts to negotiate with the
Pakistani government to ensure the safety
of Bhutto.
That evening I met with several
senators to discuss the implications and
possible ramifications of this proposal.
First of all, we had to decide if this was a
question concerning the students at the
Univeristy — was it within the jurisdiction
of the senate? And second, we had to
decide if the issue warranted our concern
— was it significant from the perspective
of an educational institution in a free soc
iety? Our initial response to both ques
tions was enthusiastically affirmative, and
we decided to pursue the case because it
1) provided us the possibility of obtaining
a well qualified professor for the Univer
sity community, and 2) afforded us the
opportunity to support the efforts of such
men as Pete McCloskey, George Bush,
Sen. Alan Cranston and Ramsey Clark in
their pursuit to protect human rights.
An issue of such magnitude necessi
tated further research before any viable
alternatives or positions could be taken,
and at the same time we had to deal with a
limited time framework. Bhutto is cur
rently pending execution as a political
prisoner, perhaps within a week. Thus we
sought details on Bhutto's record both

academically and politically, as well as on
the case calling for his execution. Short
term student task forces were estab
lished, professors both here and
elsewhere were contacted and feedback
was elicited from organizations and indi
viduals throughout the country, including
Amnesty International, Henry Kissinger
and Ramsey Clark. The senators involved
in the research tried to utilize existing
University sources, relying on friends, fa
culty and groups (such as Stanford New
Directions) as well as several hours of in
dependent research in our own library
system. We knew that any decision would
have to be an informed one, and given
our time limitation, the research results
were most encouragingly thorough.
We obtained copies of letters, state
ments and articles written by Rep.
McCloskey, Sen. Cranston, George
Bush and the Pakastani Ambassador. We
also received copies of an affidavit by
Bhutto's son on the case, a letter from the
faculty and administration of Berkeley
and an article by Ramsey Clark written on
his return from Pakistan which was placed
in the Congressional Record. Countless
news jand opinion articles were re
searched and reviewed from both pro and
anti-Bhutto sources.
Our research reaffirmed our initial re
sponse. It appeared clear to us that first,
Bhutto is a man of considerable academic
and individual character and worth, and
second, he was being denied due process
of law, a fair trial and in a phrase — basic
human rights. The evidence we later
gained served to strengthen this position.
We discovered that Bhutto would easily
be qualified to teach courses in interna
tional law, political science, history and
international relations at the University.
He graduated with honors in political sci
ence at Berkeley, where he recently re
ceived the Haas award for outstanding
contributions of an alumni to his native
country. He received his law degree from
Oxford University and has taught interna
tional law at South Hampton University in
England. His experience is based on over
20 years in the upper levels of the Pakas
tani government including terms as its
president and later as its first elected
prime minister. He has played an instru
mental role in international politics as
evidenced by the assistance he rendered
in providing the preliminary contacts
leading to former president Richard Ni
xon's first visit to China. Clark states, "It
has been conceded by friend and foe
alike that Bhutto is keenly intelligent,
popular and charismatic, " leading to his
international reputation as the "scholarly
statesman."

Our research and our communication
with Ramsey Clark, Amnesty International
and others made it evident to us that
Bhutto has been falsely accused, ques
tionably tried and ruthlessly condemned
on unwarranted charges of conspiracy to
murder. The testimony against Bhutto
was according to Clark, "contradicted by
ballistics and other physical evidence and
(was) absolutely uncorroborated by an
eyewitness."
rhe evidence unmistakably indicates
that AM Bhutto's trial was blatant denial of
the full accordance of justice and human
rights.
Members of the ASSU senate and the
student body met with Clark three days
ago to ask his advice and gauge his re
sponse to our action. He served to
strengthen our conviction that our offer is
a viable and worthwhile alternative. We
have also sent letters to over 200 individu
als and groups, eliciting their sugges
tions.
We feel that the effect of Rep. McClos
key's personal appearance in Pakistan
may provide the necessary leverage to
facilitate Bhutto's release. Whether
Bhutto will someday be released and al
lowed to teach at the University remains
to be seen; regardless, we feel the effort
must be made.
