## Clearing up confusion on libertarianism 
### 
lerry Lampton's column (Daily, Oct. 16), should
have been entitled "Misconceptions about Liber
tarianism." Let me try to clear them up.
First of all, libertarians do not advocate "a return
to the laissez-faire attitude of the 18th and 19th cen
turies." This was a period of colonial aggression,
slavery, and the establishment of unjust property
claims throughout the world. In England peasants
were thrown off the land, creating Marx's "reserve
army of the unemployed." All of these actions viol
ate the fundamental libertarian principle of non
aggression: force may not be used against persons
or their justly acquired property except in self
defense.
Secondly, libertarianism does not break down, as
Lampton contends, because of ambiguity between
"private" and "public" acts. Libertarians have shed
new light on this conceptual quagmire by distin
guishing between voluntary and involuntary ex
changes. If an exchange inflicts physical damage
upon someone orhis property without his consent,
then the exchange is involuntary and would be il
legal under libertarian law. On the other hand, if all
parties to an exchange consent to it and there is no
fraud or threats of reprisal, then the exchange is
voluntary and should not be interfered with by
others.
It is precisely the libertarian distinction between
voluntary and involuntary exchanges which ac
counts for our intuition that a little old lady in Boston
is a busybody when she wants pornography or
marijuana outlawed but that she has a valid claim
against muggers or polluters.
Lampton insinuates that the abolition of slavery
somehow presents a moral dilemma for libertarians,
because "to abolish slavery meant to abolish the
antebellum southerners' lifestyle, an obvious re

striction on personal liberty." This argument repre
sents a gross misunderstanding of the libertarian
philosophy. Slavery is clearly against the libertarian
canon of non-aggression. On the other hand, liber
tarians guarantee no one the right to a certain life
style, other than one free from aggression.
To dispense rights requiring the positive action of
others is to sow the seeds of injustice. If person A
has the right to a certain form of consumption, then
who will be made to provide it for him if he fails to
obtain it through voluntary action?

If an exchange inflicts physical
damage upon someone or his
property without his consent,
then the exchange is involuntary
and would be illegal under liber
tarian law.

Finally, we come to Lampton's most important ar
gument. He maintains that coercion is necessary to
maintain a certain amount of equality in society,
otherwise "freedom becomes the freedom of some
to tyrannize over others." Three arguments .pan be
made against this contention.
First, the means will end up being counter
productive to the ends. Coerced equality requires a
state with broad powers. Such a state will invariably
be captured by the already well off. Whatever
crumbs are necessary will be thrown to the
populace, but the unchecked coercive capability will
be used primarily to further the interests of a domin

ant elite. Bakunin saw this point, and unlike Marx he
proposed that the state wither away immediately
after the revolution and not be used as an instru
ment to "create" socialism. (American history, in
cluding the Great Society, provides no exception to
the "capturing" phenomenon.)
The second argument against Lampton's conten
tion is that libertarianism already contains the best
solution to tyranny, abuse of power and injustice to
the weak. It is the outlawing of coercion altogether.
What is there to fear from the private sector if it is
under the aegis of libertarian law and can no longer
manipulate governments? What is unjust about
non-fraudulent, voluntary exchange? What is less
wasteful, compared to other alternatives?
The final argument against coerced equality is
simply that it is unjust. Robbing Peter to improve the
lot of Paul is unfair to Peter unless he has aggressed
against Paul. That Peter might have benefited from
voluntary transactions with Paul is no counter
argument. In voluntary exchange, the weak benefit
from the strong as well as the strong benefiting
from the weak.
Lampton's views are not limited to himself, as
shown by the graduation speeches of Donald Ken
nedy and Richard Lyman. Many who are dependent
upon the state are busy justifying its role by raising
pseudo-problems or problems of the state's own
creation.
Those who are tired of force, liberals, conserva
tives, bureaucracy and injustice and who feel the
possibility of a better order should read the forth
coming edition of Murray Rothbard's For a New Lib
erty. It does not have all the answers, but it clarifies
what libertarianism is all about.

First of all, libertarians do not advocate "a return
to the laissez-faire attitude of the 18th and 19th cen
turies." This was a period of colonial aggression,
slavery, and the establishment of unjust property
claims throughout the world. In England peasants
were thrown off the land, creating Marx's "reserve
army of the unemployed." All of these actions viol
ate the fundamental libertarian principle of non
aggression: force may not be used against persons
or their justly acquired property except in self
defense.
Secondly, libertarianism does not break down, as
Lampton contends, because of ambiguity between
"private" and "public" acts. Libertarians have shed
new light on this conceptual quagmire by distin
guishing between voluntary and involuntary ex
changes. If an exchange inflicts physical damage
upon someone orhis property without his consent,
then the exchange is involuntary and would be il
legal under libertarian law. On the other hand, if all
parties to an exchange consent to it and there is no
fraud or threats of reprisal, then the exchange is
voluntary and should not be interfered with by
others.
It is precisely the libertarian distinction between
voluntary and involuntary exchanges which ac
counts for our intuition that a little old lady in Boston
is a busybody when she wants pornography or
marijuana outlawed but that she has a valid claim
against muggers or polluters.
Lampton insinuates that the abolition of slavery
somehow presents a moral dilemma for libertarians,
because "to abolish slavery meant to abolish the
antebellum southerners' lifestyle, an obvious re

striction on personal liberty." This argument repre
sents a gross misunderstanding of the libertarian
philosophy. Slavery is clearly against the libertarian
canon of non-aggression. On the other hand, liber
tarians guarantee no one the right to a certain life
style, other than one free from aggression.
To dispense rights requiring the positive action of
others is to sow the seeds of injustice. If person A
has the right to a certain form of consumption, then
who will be made to provide it for him if he fails to
obtain it through voluntary action?

If an exchange inflicts physical
damage upon someone or his
property without his consent,
then the exchange is involuntary
and would be illegal under liber
tarian law.

Finally, we come to Lampton's most important ar
gument. He maintains that coercion is necessary to
maintain a certain amount of equality in society,
otherwise "freedom becomes the freedom of some
to tyrannize over others." Three arguments .pan be
made against this contention.
First, the means will end up being counter
productive to the ends. Coerced equality requires a
state with broad powers. Such a state will invariably
be captured by the already well off. Whatever
crumbs are necessary will be thrown to the
populace, but the unchecked coercive capability will
be used primarily to further the interests of a domin

ant elite. Bakunin saw this point, and unlike Marx he
proposed that the state wither away immediately
after the revolution and not be used as an instru
ment to "create" socialism. (American history, in
cluding the Great Society, provides no exception to
the "capturing" phenomenon.)
The second argument against Lampton's conten
tion is that libertarianism already contains the best
solution to tyranny, abuse of power and injustice to
the weak. It is the outlawing of coercion altogether.
What is there to fear from the private sector if it is
under the aegis of libertarian law and can no longer
manipulate governments? What is unjust about
non-fraudulent, voluntary exchange? What is less
wasteful, compared to other alternatives?
The final argument against coerced equality is
simply that it is unjust. Robbing Peter to improve the
lot of Paul is unfair to Peter unless he has aggressed
against Paul. That Peter might have benefited from
voluntary transactions with Paul is no counter
argument. In voluntary exchange, the weak benefit
from the strong as well as the strong benefiting
from the weak.
Lampton's views are not limited to himself, as
shown by the graduation speeches of Donald Ken
nedy and Richard Lyman. Many who are dependent
upon the state are busy justifying its role by raising
pseudo-problems or problems of the state's own
creation.
Those who are tired of force, liberals, conserva
tives, bureaucracy and injustice and who feel the
possibility of a better order should read the forth
coming edition of Murray Rothbard's For a New Lib
erty. It does not have all the answers, but it clarifies
what libertarianism is all about.
