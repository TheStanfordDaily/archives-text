## Movies/jim mattson Old tricks, dummies and a tired script sink 'Magic' 
### 
It doesn't take too long to realize that all of
Magic's tricks are old hat. Perhaps the makers
of this film thought a sure-fire way to gain audi
ence attention was to rehash the much-loved
tale of a boy and his dummy; at any rate it
seems clear that they were convinced that a
main character with two personalities calls tor
no more than a half-brained script. Whatever
the mathematics, the audience is a victim of a
gross miscalculation of taste.
Anthony Hopkins portrays the whacko ven
triloquist who rises to fame on the back of his
dummy, Fats. Ann-Margret plays the girl he
idolized in high shcool but was too shy to speak
to: "You always were this weirdly timid per
son," she reminds him. Burgess Meredith is
cast as a cynical theatrical agent with a heart of
gold — sound familiar?
Out of kilter
All three are marooned in what is being ad
vertised as a "terrifying love story." The con
cept itself isn't such a bad one — there is some
thing vaguely sinister about a ventriloquist's
ability to breathe life into a mannequin. But for
a story like this to be effective, it has to be
firmly rooted in reality. Terror arises when we
realize that there is something sadly out of kil
ter in what we thought was a comfortably logi
cal environment.
And, from the beginning, logic is the main
thing Magic has trouble coming up with. We
first see Hopkins making a disastrous debut as a
magician on a nightclub's amateur night. When
we next see him, one year later, he is a smash
success: the nightclub is sold out and an NBC
talent scout is checking out his act. Why the
turn-around? It turns out-that he's found the
secret to self confidence and success: a pop
eyed, foul-mouthed dummy named Fats.

We are not supposed to notice, however,
that the dummy's schtick is made up of jokes
that must have been tired 20 years ago. Nor are
we supposed to question whether a ven
triloquist could convert an unsympathetic au
dience with card tricks. When's the last time
you've been wowed by a card trick? And later,
when it develops that the dummy represents
the ventriloquist's psychotic better half, we are
not supposed to ask for any character defini
tion to help illustrate how this admittedly
bizarre condition could develop.
Director Richard Attenborough tries valiantly
enough but seemingly lacks the temperatment
to give Magic the crackling pace it requires. He
relies heavily on stock suspense set-ups ("will
the fisherman fish up the corpse from the bot
tom of the lake?") and "atmospheric" lighting
like illuminating the killer from beneath to
make him look saturnine. The director's best
moment comes in the middle of the film in a
scene where the ventriloquist talks himself into
his first murder — the moment is creepily fas
cinating. But from there the film winds itself
down into a curiously anti-climatic rnding.
Wider range
Hopkins' performance is adequate given his
material — there are only so many ways
one can portray a schizoid ventriloquist. Ann-
Margret's function, other than a merely decora
tive one, is to be too stupid to realize that she's
dealing with a major lune until it's too late to do
anything about it. Both performers would be
wise to start looking for roles with a little wider
range.
)ust because Magic takes itself so seriously
doesn't mean the audience need do so. If ap
proached in the right frame of mind, Magic
could be the most campily enjoyable stupid
movie of the year.




Anthony Hopkins, Burgess Meredith, Ann-Margret (and the dummy, Fats) make a valiant effort in Richard Attenborough's Mdgic, now
playing at the Alexandria Theater in San Francisco.

triloquist could convert an unsympathetic au
dience with card tricks. When's the last time
you've been wowed by a card trick? And later,
when it develops that the dummy represents
the ventriloquist's psychotic better half, we are
not supposed to ask for any character defini
tion to help illustrate how this admittedly
bizarre condition could develop.
Director Richard Attenborough tries valiantly
enough but seemingly lacks the temperatment
to give Magic the crackling pace it requires. He
relies heavily on stock suspense set-ups ("will
the fisherman fish up the corpse from the bot
tom of the lake?") and "atmospheric" lighting
like illuminating the killer from beneath to
make him look saturnine. The director's best
moment comes in the middle of the film in a
scene where the ventriloquist talks himself into
his first murder — the moment is creepily fas
cinating. But from there the film winds itself
down into a curiously anti-climatic rnding.
Wider range
Hopkins' performance is adequate given his
material — there are only so many ways
one can portray a schizoid ventriloquist. Ann-
Margret's function, other than a merely decora
tive one, is to be too stupid to realize that she's
dealing with a major lune until it's too late to do
anything about it. Both performers would be
wise to start looking for roles with a little wider
range.
)ust because Magic takes itself so seriously
doesn't mean the audience need do so. If ap
proached in the right frame of mind, Magic
could be the most campily enjoyable stupid
movie of the year.




Anthony Hopkins, Burgess Meredith, Ann-Margret (and the dummy, Fats) make a valiant effort in Richard Attenborough's Mdgic, now
playing at the Alexandria Theater in San Francisco.
It doesn't take too long to realize that all of
Magic's tricks are old hat. Perhaps the makers
of this film thought a sure-fire way to gain audi
ence attention was to rehash the much-loved
tale of a boy and his dummy; at any rate it
seems clear that they were convinced that a
main character with two personalities calls tor
no more than a half-brained script. Whatever
the mathematics, the audience is a victim of a
gross miscalculation of taste.
Anthony Hopkins portrays the whacko ven
triloquist who rises to fame on the back of his
dummy, Fats. Ann-Margret plays the girl he
idolized in high shcool but was too shy to speak
to: "You always were this weirdly timid per
son," she reminds him. Burgess Meredith is
cast as a cynical theatrical agent with a heart of
gold — sound familiar?
Out of kilter
All three are marooned in what is being ad
vertised as a "terrifying love story." The con
cept itself isn't such a bad one — there is some
thing vaguely sinister about a ventriloquist's
ability to breathe life into a mannequin. But for
a story like this to be effective, it has to be
firmly rooted in reality. Terror arises when we
realize that there is something sadly out of kil
ter in what we thought was a comfortably logi
cal environment.
And, from the beginning, logic is the main
thing Magic has trouble coming up with. We
first see Hopkins making a disastrous debut as a
magician on a nightclub's amateur night. When
we next see him, one year later, he is a smash
success: the nightclub is sold out and an NBC
talent scout is checking out his act. Why the
turn-around? It turns out-that he's found the
secret to self confidence and success: a pop
eyed, foul-mouthed dummy named Fats.

We are not supposed to notice, however,
that the dummy's schtick is made up of jokes
that must have been tired 20 years ago. Nor are
we supposed to question whether a ven
triloquist could convert an unsympathetic au
dience with card tricks. When's the last time
you've been wowed by a card trick? And later,
