Insignificant student initiative and
no director have prevented official
reopening of the Off-Campus Stu
dent Center, according to Student
Activities Director Thom Massey.
"After having the center for three
years, we have yet to develop a sup
port group among the off-campus
students," Massey said.
However, according to former
statfer Laura Mead, "The center fi
nally came into its own last year.
Since it has not been there this year,
off-campus students have been say
ing it will be hard to get the ball
rolling again."
In an effort to organize off
campus undergraduates, Mead cal

led a meeting last week.
Massey explained that the center
was intended to provide off-campus
students with information on cam
pus facilities and activities.
The students also were to use
the center's Clubhouse location for
social and educational activities.
Staff and funds from the Office of
Student Activities (OSA), were sup
posed to be temporary aids until
students developed activities and
sought funds from the University or
the ASSU, consulting OSA if neces
sary.
No applicants
Despite a campaign to publicize
the need for a center director, Mas
sey said OSA still has not received

any applications for the position, a
one-year internship. He attributed
the lack of response to the shortage
of applicants for nonlab internships
and to the time commitment in
volved.
OSA is willing to split the job into
two positions, one for graduate stu
dents and the other for under
graduates, according to OSA adviser
Griselda Castro.
The center is now being used dur
ing the day as a drop-in center
primarily by graduate students,
Massey said.
Because the graduate students
have been more active in pursuing
support for their concerns and ac
tivities, OSA is trying to direct its

programs toward them, Massey con
tinued.
Plans include a Graduate Students
Organizations Office at the center,
Massey said.
"By definition, the majority of
off-campus students are graduate
students, as they have less on
campus housing possibilities," Mas
sey said.
"Now, we may be getting to the
needs of the bulk of off-campus stu
dents," he added.
Should graduate students re
spond overwhelmingly to the cent
er's opportunities, they will be al
lowed to use the center exclusively,
Massey said.
Massey also said OSA's new focus
on graduate students was not meant
to deny use of the center to under
graduates. If the undergraduates or
ganize their activities, they will re
ceive OSA support, he said.
Complaints
"It seems like a Catch-22 situation
is going on. People don't know who
to complain to, so the people in
charge assume no one has com
plaints," Mead said.
Castro said that the center staff
ideally should help off-campus stu
dents organize activities, but the
impetus to develop these activities
must originate with the students.
"I think that, since so many stu
dents have not chosen to live off
campus, but have been forced off by
the draw, an effort should be made
by the administration to integrate
off-campus students into campus
life," Mead said.
Massey cited a survey conducted
last spring by the dean of student
affairs office, in which one in six un
dergraduates and one in eight
graduate students living off campus
preferred University residences to
off-campus accommodations.
"The survey and the general re
sponse by off-campus students to
the center make us wonder if living
off campus without an off-campus
student center is a viable option,"
Massey said.

Boathouse blues
About 40 Stanford crew members had to pull down their boathouse in the port of Redwood City last weekend.
The month-to-month lease they had since 1967, for the land housing the 24-year-old building, had expired.
Grading will start this weekend on a new plot temporarily leased from another corporation in the area.

students," Massey said.
However, according to former
statfer Laura Mead, "The center fi
nally came into its own last year.
Since it has not been there this year,
off-campus students have been say
ing it will be hard to get the ball
rolling again."
In an effort to organize off
campus undergraduates, Mead cal

led a meeting last week.
Massey explained that the center
was intended to provide off-campus
students with information on cam
pus facilities and activities.
The students also were to use
the center's Clubhouse location for
social and educational activities.
Staff and funds from the Office of
Student Activities (OSA), were sup
posed to be temporary aids until
students developed activities and
sought funds from the University or
the ASSU, consulting OSA if neces
sary.
No applicants
Despite a campaign to publicize
the need for a center director, Mas
sey said OSA still has not received

any applications for the position, a
one-year internship. He attributed
the lack of response to the shortage
of applicants for nonlab internships
and to the time commitment in
volved.
OSA is willing to split the job into
two positions, one for graduate stu
dents and the other for under
graduates, according to OSA adviser
Griselda Castro.
The center is now being used dur
ing the day as a drop-in center
primarily by graduate students,
Massey said.
Because the graduate students
have been more active in pursuing
support for their concerns and ac
tivities, OSA is trying to direct its

programs toward them, Massey con
tinued.
Plans include a Graduate Students
Organizations Office at the center,
Massey said.
"By definition, the majority of
off-campus students are graduate
students, as they have less on
campus housing possibilities," Mas
sey said.
"Now, we may be getting to the
needs of the bulk of off-campus stu
dents," he added.
Should graduate students re
spond overwhelmingly to the cent
er's opportunities, they will be al
lowed to use the center exclusively,
Massey said.
Massey also said OSA's new focus
on graduate students was not meant
to deny use of the center to under
graduates. If the undergraduates or
ganize their activities, they will re
ceive OSA support, he said.
Complaints
"It seems like a Catch-22 situation
is going on. People don't know who
to complain to, so the people in
charge assume no one has com
plaints," Mead said.
Castro said that the center staff
ideally should help off-campus stu
dents organize activities, but the
impetus to develop these activities
must originate with the students.
"I think that, since so many stu
dents have not chosen to live off
campus, but have been forced off by
the draw, an effort should be made
by the administration to integrate
off-campus students into campus
life," Mead said.
Massey cited a survey conducted
last spring by the dean of student
affairs office, in which one in six un
dergraduates and one in eight
graduate students living off campus
preferred University residences to
off-campus accommodations.
"The survey and the general re
sponse by off-campus students to
the center make us wonder if living
off campus without an off-campus
student center is a viable option,"
Massey said.

Boathouse blues
About 40 Stanford crew members had to pull down their boathouse in the port of Redwood City last weekend.
The month-to-month lease they had since 1967, for the land housing the 24-year-old building, had expired.
Grading will start this weekend on a new plot temporarily leased from another corporation in the area.
Insignificant student initiative and
no director have prevented official
reopening of the Off-Campus Stu
dent Center, according to Student
Activities Director Thom Massey.
"After having the center for three
years, we have yet to develop a sup
port group among the off-campus
students," Massey said.
