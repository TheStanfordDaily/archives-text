## Album proves strength 
### 
Against the Grain, Phoebe
Snow's fifth album, is a tes
timony to Snow's versatility.
On it, Snow ventures away
from the soothing, blues
inflecfed ballads she's known
for; rock 'n roll dominates the
album.
In a Daily interview, Snow
said this album is something
she's always wanted to do. "I
was just too insecure to do it
until now," she said, in confi
dent tones. "This change has
come with personal growth
and experience."
The changes are evident in
the first three tracks on the al
bum's first side. Snow wails
the Wings' "Every Night," the
Chips Moman-Dan Penn clas
sic, "Do Right Woman, Do
Right Man," and the Bth Day's
"He's Not Just Another Man,"
with a strength evocative of
Aretha Franklin. A pulsating
rock beat, gospel-like
background vocals and Barry
Beckett's soulful keyboards
underscore Snow's new
sound.
Snow's own compositions,
there are five of them on the
album, strike softer, sadder
notes. What they lack in polish
is more than made up for by
the feeling with which she

sings them.
"The songs I have written
recently are good therapy for
me," Snow said. "They are
theraputic outlets for universal
feelings of anger, fear and un
requited love."
Snow says she's in her "cry
ing over spilled milk period.
I've had a tough time of it, and
I'm angry about it," she said.
"But its not an ugly kind of
anger," she added, laughing.
"It's anger with a sense of
humor."
The cuts of Snow's love
songs, "Random Time," "You
Have Not Won," and "Oh,
L.A.," bear this point out. In
them, she manages to inject
subtle notes of laughter into
truly melancholy lyrics. She is
helped along by Beckett's
keyboards, in tandem with
some of New York's best
players â€” guitarist Steve Khan,
Huch McCracken, and Steve
Burgh; percussionist Ralph
Mac Donald; the rhythm of
bassist Will Lee and Drummer
Rick Ma rotta; and Mike
Brecker, Randy Brecker, and
lon Fad in the brass section.
On the last track of the al
bum, "Keep A Watch On the
Shoreline," Snow sings about

the difficult times she's had
with her two-year-old daugh
ter, Valerie to whom the
album is dedicated. "Valerie
has very special medical prob
lems that require special
care," Snow said. "She's had a
lot to deal with in her tiny little
life, but she's tough. I've
gained strength from her
toughness."
Snow's newly discovered
strength has helped her deal
with the entertainment busi
ness, she said. "I'm beginning
to feel at peace with myself.
I'm just trying to be a success
in the business with minimal
grief."
Success for Snow entails
finding the sound she's been
searching for. "I want to meld
all of my influences and make
my own sound; not jazz, not
pop, not soul but just
Phoebe," she said. "I haven't
found it yet, but my new
album is the closest I've
come."
If Against The Grain is a
forecast of what to expect
from Snow's Nov. 19th concert
at the Paramount Theater in
Oakland, then her concert
promises to show Snow in a
new and scintillating light.
