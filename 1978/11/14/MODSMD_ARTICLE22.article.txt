"I don't know much about acting.
All I know is that it's a kind of
mechanism, a technique to reveal lit
tle bits of yourself which are hidden."
So says Anthony Hopkins, star of
the new movie, Magic. The film has
received mixed reviews (see above),
but Hopkins, typically, is the best
thing in it.
Hopkins was the only conceivable
reason to see International Velvet,
and he was one of the few performers
in A Bridge Too Far to exhibit any
real zest. Hopkins' memorable thea
ter performances include Macbeth
and the psychiatrist in Equus.
Even though he was near the end of
a lengthy promotional tour for Magic,
Hopkins congenially discussed the
movie and future projects.
Approach
He said he approached the roles of
the ventriloquist of Corky and his
dummy Fats in Magic "as one per
sonna, one character. I just learned it
as a monologue. It would have been
impossible to think, 'Now who's
speaking?'. We'd still be filming."

At first, Hopkins "thought they
were crazy to cast anyone" in his role.
But he made it work by relating it to
his own experience: "I was very slow
in school. I didn't know what the hell
I was doing there.
"I felt very much on the outside for
many years. When I came into the
theater, I still felt uncomfortable. The
awful thing was that I compounded it
by believing I was unique. That was
the biggest mistake.
Growing up
"I realized a couple of years back —
I don't know what started the process
— that I wasn't unique, that there was
nothing really to be afraid of. I started
growing up — emotionally growing
up.
"I'd been running away; I'd been
cynical about everything. I guess I was
in a kind of spiritual disorder.
"But in that period when I was try
ing to cope and bridge the gap bet
ween myself and other people, I de
veloped a great repertoire of imper
sonations, mimicry and joketelling.
"Really, Corky is a solidifed version
of that very experience. With Fats,

Corky just goes under; he isn't able to
cope with it. He's destroyed by his
own inadequacy."
For the most part, Hopkins has
overcome most of his feelings of in
adequacy. Undertaking and succeed
ing in challenging roles, like that of
the psychiatrist in Equus has given
him a "sense of self-esteem."
Acting
"I'm happy," Hopkins says."I love
acting. I love the sense of achieve
ment. I love the drifting off into
another character without having to
go insane."
Hopkins plans to undertake a pro
duction of Hamlet next year, employ
ing his own interpretation of the part.
Afterward, he will once again work
with director Richard Attenborough
(who directed Magic and A Bridge Too
Far) in a movie about Gandhi. Hop
kins jokes that he will have to lose
"25-30 pounds for the role."
Other than that, "I have no plans or
goals," says Hopkins. "I sense that
things are going to happen. But really,
I just hope to stay around for a long
time."

Other than that, "I have no plans or
goals," says Hopkins. "I sense that
things are going to happen. But really,
I just hope to stay around for a long
time."
"I don't know much about acting.
All I know is that it's a kind of
mechanism, a technique to reveal lit
tle bits of yourself which are hidden."
So says Anthony Hopkins, star of
the new movie, Magic. The film has
received mixed reviews (see above),
but Hopkins, typically, is the best
thing in it.
Hopkins was the only conceivable
reason to see International Velvet,
and he was one of the few performers
in A Bridge Too Far to exhibit any
real zest. Hopkins' memorable thea
ter performances include Macbeth
and the psychiatrist in Equus.
Even though he was near the end of
a lengthy promotional tour for Magic,
Hopkins congenially discussed the
movie and future projects.
Approach
He said he approached the roles of
the ventriloquist of Corky and his
dummy Fats in Magic "as one per
sonna, one character. I just learned it
as a monologue. It would have been
impossible to think, 'Now who's
speaking?'. We'd still be filming."

At first, Hopkins "thought they
were crazy to cast anyone" in his role.
But he made it work by relating it to
his own experience: "I was very slow
in school. I didn't know what the hell
I was doing there.
"I felt very much on the outside for
many years. When I came into the
theater, I still felt uncomfortable. The
awful thing was that I compounded it
by believing I was unique. That was
the biggest mistake.
Growing up
"I realized a couple of years back —
I don't know what started the process
— that I wasn't unique, that there was
nothing really to be afraid of. I started
growing up — emotionally growing
up.
"I'd been running away; I'd been
cynical about everything. I guess I was
in a kind of spiritual disorder.
"But in that period when I was try
ing to cope and bridge the gap bet
ween myself and other people, I de
veloped a great repertoire of imper
sonations, mimicry and joketelling.
"Really, Corky is a solidifed version
of that very experience. With Fats,

Corky just goes under; he isn't able to
cope with it. He's destroyed by his
own inadequacy."
For the most part, Hopkins has
overcome most of his feelings of in
adequacy. Undertaking and succeed
ing in challenging roles, like that of
the psychiatrist in Equus has given
him a "sense of self-esteem."
Acting
"I'm happy," Hopkins says."I love
acting. I love the sense of achieve
ment. I love the drifting off into
another character without having to
go insane."
Hopkins plans to undertake a pro
duction of Hamlet next year, employ
ing his own interpretation of the part.
Afterward, he will once again work
with director Richard Attenborough
(who directed Magic and A Bridge Too
Far) in a movie about Gandhi. Hop
kins jokes that he will have to lose
"25-30 pounds for the role."
Other than that, "I have no plans or
goals," says Hopkins. "I sense that
things are going to happen. But really,
I just hope to stay around for a long
time."
