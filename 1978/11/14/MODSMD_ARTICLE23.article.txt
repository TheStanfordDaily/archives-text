## Lewitzky's choreography uneven 
### 
Seeing the Bella Lewitzky
Dance Company perform
brings to mind questions
about the importance of the
individual in a company and a
work. The company which
performed last Friday and
Saturday night at the Center
for the Performing Arts in San
Jose, carries an apt title in
Bella Lewitzky Dance Com
pany, as it is primarily an ex
tension of Lewitzky's creative
talents.
The parts of the three pieces
on Friday's program which
worked, and there were some
especially notable ones,
worked when the single
creator philosophy was most
fully applied in both idea and
design of the choreography
and its execution.
Lewitzky, the recipient of
the Dance Magazine Award for
1978 along with Mikhial
Baryshnikov, is a native
Californian who trained with
Lester Florton. The two later
founded the Dance Theater in
Los Angeles. The present 12
member company, founded in
1%6, is based in Los Angeles.
The first piece on the prog
ram, Ceremony for Three

used three male dancers in
heavily ritualistic dance with
lighting and costumes by
Lewitzky's close friend, Dar
lene Neel. Each of the dancers
in this piece must be a full,
strong individual who under
stands and can thus personally
express Lewitzky's choreog
raphy, which consists of many
jagged, almost contorted solo
movements.
From the piece's opening
with sudden, flashes of light
illuminating the dancers as
single units, Sean Creene
came closest to fulfilling this
powerful individual quality.
Greene is described as the
"senior member" of the
Lewitzky company, which he
joined in 1968. He credits
Lewitzky as the principal influ
ence on his technique and
style, although he also studied
with Jose Limon and Mia
Slavenska. Despite the small
size of the company, Creene
in this piece was one of the
few company members who
stood out as individuals, prob
ably because he has absorbed
more of Lewitzky's style than
the rest and thus feels more a
part of her choreography.
Although David Caley and

Kurt Weinheimer performed
well, the piece in general
lacked the individual com
mitment of the essences of the
dancers that it needed to be
really powerful. Also, tighten
ing the choreography of the
piece would give it the clarity
it needs to allow for the mysti
cal ritualistic nature indicated
by its title, Ceremony.
The second piece suffered
from this lack of individuality
as much as the third piece be
nefited from it. Greening
kept the dancers running al
most constantly so that it was
sometimes difficult to see
what they were actually doing.
The cast was costumed,
again by Darlene Neel, in all
white, and danced against a
basically blue, sky-like
background. The female
members wore their hair
down loose so that it swirled
around them when they
turned, indicating youth in
contrast to a more sedate
"older" woman soloist who
had her hair pinned up. Her
relationship to the rest was not
clearly defined, but she did
provide variation visually as
much of the piece was per
vered their heads and long

metrically placed dancers or
pairs of dancers. Also nice, but
not fully integrated by the
dancers or into the rest of the
choreography, was a move
ment where the dancer's hand
touched the floor bringing the
dancer into a position which
contrasted with the basically
upright majority of the move
ments.
The live accompaniment by
flutist, Larry Attaway, and
pianist, Bonita Sonsini, who
played Aaron Copland's "Duo
for Flute and Piano," provided
a pleasant change from the
more common recorded
music of traveling companies,
who generally tour on very li
mited budgets.
Because of its themes, the
last piece, Inscape, man
aged to benefit from the faults
of the other two pieces. "In
scape" was a somewhat cont
rived but still effective series
of movement sketches which
alluded to contemporary soci
ety and played with the cos
tumes and set designed by
Rudi Gernreich. Gernreich
and Lewitzky created this
piece together, Gernreich de
signing costumes in response
to Lewitzky's choreographic
inventions, in addition to
creating challenges for
Lewitzky such as enclosing
dancers within stretch fabrics.
The basic costumes and
movements of the dancers
reminded one of pawns in a
societal chess game. The cast
wore black caps which co
vered their heads and long
sleeved jumpsuits with one
sleeve and one pant leg mis
sing. Here the generally
character-less nature of many
of the Lewitzky dancers
worked well.

raphy, which consists of many
jagged, almost contorted solo
movements.
From the piece's opening
with sudden, flashes of light
illuminating the dancers as
single units, Sean Creene
came closest to fulfilling this
powerful individual quality.
Greene is described as the
"senior member" of the
Lewitzky company, which he
joined in 1968. He credits
Lewitzky as the principal influ
ence on his technique and
style, although he also studied
with Jose Limon and Mia
Slavenska. Despite the small
size of the company, Creene
in this piece was one of the
few company members who
stood out as individuals, prob
ably because he has absorbed
more of Lewitzky's style than
the rest and thus feels more a
part of her choreography.
Although David Caley and

Kurt Weinheimer performed
well, the piece in general
lacked the individual com
mitment of the essences of the
dancers that it needed to be
really powerful. Also, tighten
ing the choreography of the
piece would give it the clarity
it needs to allow for the mysti
cal ritualistic nature indicated
by its title, Ceremony.
The second piece suffered
from this lack of individuality
as much as the third piece be
nefited from it. Greening
kept the dancers running al
most constantly so that it was
sometimes difficult to see
what they were actually doing.
The cast was costumed,
again by Darlene Neel, in all
white, and danced against a
basically blue, sky-like
background. The female
members wore their hair
down loose so that it swirled
around them when they
turned, indicating youth in
contrast to a more sedate
"older" woman soloist who
had her hair pinned up. Her
relationship to the rest was not
clearly defined, but she did
provide variation visually as
much of the piece was per
vered their heads and long

metrically placed dancers or
pairs of dancers. Also nice, but
not fully integrated by the
dancers or into the rest of the
choreography, was a move
ment where the dancer's hand
touched the floor bringing the
dancer into a position which
contrasted with the basically
upright majority of the move
ments.
The live accompaniment by
flutist, Larry Attaway, and
pianist, Bonita Sonsini, who
played Aaron Copland's "Duo
for Flute and Piano," provided
a pleasant change from the
more common recorded
music of traveling companies,
who generally tour on very li
mited budgets.
Because of its themes, the
last piece, Inscape, man
aged to benefit from the faults
of the other two pieces. "In
scape" was a somewhat cont
rived but still effective series
of movement sketches which
alluded to contemporary soci
ety and played with the cos
tumes and set designed by
Rudi Gernreich. Gernreich
and Lewitzky created this
piece together, Gernreich de
signing costumes in response
to Lewitzky's choreographic
inventions, in addition to
creating challenges for
Lewitzky such as enclosing
dancers within stretch fabrics.
The basic costumes and
movements of the dancers
reminded one of pawns in a
societal chess game. The cast
wore black caps which co
vered their heads and long
sleeved jumpsuits with one
sleeve and one pant leg mis
sing. Here the generally
character-less nature of many
of the Lewitzky dancers
worked well.

Seeing the Bella Lewitzky
Dance Company perform
brings to mind questions
about the importance of the
individual in a company and a
work. The company which
performed last Friday and
Saturday night at the Center
for the Performing Arts in San
Jose, carries an apt title in
Bella Lewitzky Dance Com
pany, as it is primarily an ex
tension of Lewitzky's creative
talents.
The parts of the three pieces
on Friday's program which
worked, and there were some
especially notable ones,
worked when the single
creator philosophy was most
fully applied in both idea and
design of the choreography
and its execution.
Lewitzky, the recipient of
the Dance Magazine Award for
1978 along with Mikhial
Baryshnikov, is a native
Californian who trained with
Lester Florton. The two later
founded the Dance Theater in
Los Angeles. The present 12
member company, founded in
1%6, is based in Los Angeles.
The first piece on the prog
ram, Ceremony for Three

used three male dancers in
heavily ritualistic dance with
lighting and costumes by
Lewitzky's close friend, Dar
lene Neel. Each of the dancers
in this piece must be a full,
strong individual who under
stands and can thus personally
express Lewitzky's choreog
raphy, which consists of many
jagged, almost contorted solo
movements.

sometimes difficult to see
what they were actually doing.
The cast was costumed,
again by Darlene Neel, in all
white, and danced against a
basically blue, sky-like
background. The female
members wore their hair
down loose so that it swirled
around them when they
turned, indicating youth in
contrast to a more sedate
"older" woman soloist who
had her hair pinned up. Her
relationship to the rest was not
clearly defined, but she did
provide variation visually as
much of the piece was per
vered their heads and long

metrically placed dancers or
pairs of dancers. Also nice, but
not fully integrated by the
dancers or into the rest of the
choreography, was a move
ment where the dancer's hand
touched the floor bringing the
dancer into a position which
contrasted with the basically
upright majority of the move
ments.
The live accompaniment by
flutist, Larry Attaway, and
pianist, Bonita Sonsini, who
played Aaron Copland's "Duo
for Flute and Piano," provided
a pleasant change from the
more common recorded
music of traveling companies,
who generally tour on very li
mited budgets.
Because of its themes, the
last piece, Inscape, man
aged to benefit from the faults
of the other two pieces. "In
scape" was a somewhat cont
rived but still effective series
of movement sketches which
alluded to contemporary soci
ety and played with the cos
tumes and set designed by
Rudi Gernreich. Gernreich
and Lewitzky created this
piece together, Gernreich de
signing costumes in response
to Lewitzky's choreographic
inventions, in addition to
creating challenges for
Lewitzky such as enclosing
dancers within stretch fabrics.
The basic costumes and
movements of the dancers
reminded one of pawns in a
societal chess game. The cast
wore black caps which co
vered their heads and long
sleeved jumpsuits with one
sleeve and one pant leg mis
sing. Here the generally
character-less nature of many
of the Lewitzky dancers
worked well.
