The San Francisco Lamplighters Theatre
Company is producing a benefit perfor
mance of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic
opera The Gondoliers. The Sixth Annual
Benefit Performance, sponsored by the
Community Association for the Retarded,
takes place on Saturday, November 18 at 8
p.m. in the Spangenburg Auditorium of
Gunn High School, 780 Arastradero, in
Palo Alto.
The performers, the San Francisco
Lamplighters, have been together for 26
years doing top performances of Gilbert
and Sullivan and other comic operas. The
company is highly acclaimed by both cri
tics and audiences and has over 120

members — all volunteers — who give
their time and talents to this annual be
nefit for the disabled.
The opera The Gondoliers is consi
dered one of Gilbert and Sullivan's best
and most popular, second only to The
Mikado. The plot revolves around discov
ering which Gondolier, if either, is really
the true heir to the throne of Bataravia,
taken away years before as an infant and
raised by peasants to save him from the
noose of insurrectionists.
The Lamplighter's production of The
Gondoliers is witty and hilarious — from
the stage settings to the singing, dancing

and acting — and has been praised and
highly recommended by local critics.
All proceeds from The Gondoliers will
go to the Community Association for the
Retarded, whose programs include ser
vices that help handicapped children and
adults to reach their fullest potential.
Tickets are $6 and can be purchased at
all Macy's and Emporium Stores, and at
the Community Association for the Re
tarded, 3864 Middlefield Road, Palo Alto.
Phone: (415) 494-0550. In Los Altos, tic
kets can be purchased at the Peninsula
Box Office, and in San Jose at the San Jose
Box Office, 912 Town & Country Village.
