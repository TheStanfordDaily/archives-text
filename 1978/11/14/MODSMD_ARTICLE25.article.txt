U.S. seeks to save Mideast talks
By telephone and in meetings on two continents,
President Jimmy Carter and his diplomats sought yes
terday to head off a breakdown in the Egyptian-Israeli
peace talks. Egypt's President, Anwar Sadat, reportedly
considered but then dropped the idea of calling his
negotiators home from Washington.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin, meanwhile, ar >" lv^ d
back in Israel after a U.S./Canadian tour and said his
government would be reviewing American and Egyp
tian proposals for resolving the central dispute in the
negotiations — whether and how to link an Egyptian-
Israeli treaty to a solution of the Palestinian issue.
In an interview broadcast on public television last
night, Carter called both sides in the Mideast talks
stubborn.
But he also said remaining obstacles are relatively
insignificant" in the overall scope of the situation.
The foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt both will
return to the Mideast while the two nations defense
ministers will remain in Washington.
Israel's cabinet will confer Thursday on the talks, and
consultations also will take place in Cairo.
Iranian oil workers strike ends
Tehran, Iran — Iran's 37,000 oil workers went back to
work today, ending a two-week-old strike that crippled
the country's chief export industry, the government oil
company announced.
Strike leaders agreed yesterday to call off the walkout
after meeting with officials of the National Iranian Oil
Co., company spokesman Nezammuddin Mezayeni
said.
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi appeared to have
weathered the threat to his 37-year reign caused by the
oil strike and weeks of anti-government demonstra
tions and the oil strike.
Tehran remained calm yesterday under the watch of
heavily armed troops in key districts of the city and a
strictly enforced dusk-to-dawn curfew.
Most shops and businesses were open and govern
ment agencies and public utilities operated normally.
U.S. expects oil price increase
Washington — The Carter administration is braced for
an increase in world oil prices of at least 5 percent, and
maybe 10 percent, which would raise the price of
gasoline and home heating oil.
Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal will travel to
the Mideast later this week to confer with leaders of the
major oil-producing nations of Saudi Arabia, Iran,
Kuwait and Abu Dhabi.
Blumenthal's trip comes just a few weeks before
members of the Organizatin of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meet in Abu Dhabi in mid-December to set
oil prices for next year.
The oil minister of Kuwait has said he favors an in
crease of at least 10 percent. Oil prices were frozen for
1978 after years of steady increases in prices.
Carter clears civil defense plan
Washington — The Carter administration said yester
day that most Americans would die in a nuclear war,
many because of outdated fallout shelters, and ap
proved a plan to save up to 146 million people by
large-scale evacuation of urban centers.
The shelters currently available in American cities are
not sufficient to meet the modern nuclear threat posed

by the Soviet Union, said Bardyl Tirana, U.S. civil de
fense director.
Tirana said the Soviets are better prepared to protect
their citizens in the event of nuclear war. He confirmed
that President Jimmy Carter gave his approval to the
new evacuation plans on Sept. 29.
Civil defense officials estimate that 90 million of the
current U.S. population of 220 million would survive a
nuclear attack. The aim of the new program is to in
crease the number of survivors to as many as 146 mill
ion.
High Court takes newspaper case
Washington — The Supreme Court said yesterday it
will decide whether states may prosecute newspapers
for publishing the names of juveniles charged with
crimes.
In a case that could carry broad free-press impact, the
court agreed to judge the constitutionality of a West
Virginia law that makes it a crime for newspapers to
report such names.
All states have laws protecting the privacy of juveniles
in trouble but it is unclear how many states go as far as
West Virginia.
Its law was struck down last June by the West Virginia
Supreme Court, which ruled that the ban unconstitu
tionally infringed on freedom of the press.
Kanawha County Prosecutor Cletus Hanley came to
the nation's highest court seeking to reinstate the law.
West Virginia's invalidated law is limited to newspap
ers but it is possible the Supreme Court's eventual
decision, expected sometime before next July, could
encompass the broadcast media as well.
Remains may be John the Baptist's
Cairo, Egypt — Workers renovating an ancient Christ
ian monastery in the desert north of Cairo discovered a
coffin that church officials say may contain the remains
of John the Baptist, the holy man who, according to
Christian belief, baptized Jesus Christ.
"There are lots of bodies buried out there and we
have to be sure," said Bishop Samuel, an official of the
Coptic Christian Church who is organizing an investiga
tion of the discovery. "What leads the priests to think it
is John the Baptist is a reference in church manuscripts
which says he was buried 18 feet from the altar."
The wooden coffin was found under the walls of St.
Makarios monastery, 60 miles north<of Cairo.

worries and a steadily climbing prime rate, dropped

Cal heist foiled
Four UC-Berkeley students — ap
parently frustrated by their school's
inability to swipe the Big Came Axe
this year — tried to steal several
Stanford Avenue and other Palo Alto
street signs last weekend, according
to the Palo Alto Times. But they
didn't make it. A police officer spot
ted the four taking down a sign early
Saturday morning and interrupted
the heist. About 10 other signs were
found in the back of a pickup truck,
from Stanford Avenue and
Dartmouth, Vale and Oberlin

Streets. The four students were not
arrested, but will probably be billed
for putting back the signs, according
to police.
Correction
A remark in yesterday's Daily read
ing, "I would personally rather have
a good, trained paramedic resusci
tate me than most hospital physi
cians in this hospital," was mista
kenly attributed to Dr. Michael Elias
tam. The remark was made by Dr. J.
Kent Garman. The Daily regrets the
error.

to be included in the Quad, can be
