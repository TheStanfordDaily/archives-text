# IFC outlines Big Game Week plans
## 
### RICHARD SHAMES 
The Inter-Fraternity Council
made final plans yesterday for Big
Came Week activities that start to
morrow with a noon rally in White
Plaza.
The 30-member council helps
coordinate the week's events. This
year's activities range from a
fireworks extravaganza Thursday to
a campus-wide party Friday.
"This is one of our biggest func
tions as far as money and people
go," said IFC President Kurt Osen
baugh. "We traditionally like to get
involved in Big Came Week and
make sure it continues even without
the Bonfire."
The traditional Bonfire was scrap
ped in 1976 because student groups
and administrators objected to the
waste it created, Osenbaugh said.
"It's not a sour grapes thing with
us," he said "Last year a new air
pollution control regulation was put
in limiting the Bonfire. The Univer
sity didn't want it either, so we ha
ven't thought about it at all this
year."
Osenbaugh said he believed that
the absence of a bonfire won't cur
tail spirit for the week. "The Big
Came has been sold out since mid
summer. There is still a lot of in
terest, especially with last year's re
vival Gaieties," he said.
The bonfire will be replaced in
part by Thursday's fireworks display
near Lake Lagunita. The 30-45 mi
nute show follows the opening night
of Gaieties and an all-campus rally
with the band.
The IFC's "Mega-Nooner" will be
noon Friday. The pre-Big 'Came
party will feature a band and 40 kegs
of beer. The party will be between
the Beta House and the Delta
Upsilon House. Last year's "Mega-
Nooner," the first ever, was a last
minute effort, which used money
budgeted for the cancelled bonfire,
Osenbaugh said.
