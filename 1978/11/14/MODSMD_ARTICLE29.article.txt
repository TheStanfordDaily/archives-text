## Forecast: Snows blanket hills; resorts plan opening 
### 
Skiers were seen tuning up
their equipment the last
few days amid reports that
heavy snows had blanketed
major western ski resorts over
the weekend.
Many resorts now plan
openings this weekend.
Utah resorts picked up the
most snowfall in a spot check
of major resorts late Sunday.
Snowbird reported over 17 in
ches of new snow Sunday and
had moved its opening date to
Nov. 17.
Both Snowbird and Alta re
ported over two feet at the bot
tom of the mountain. "The ski
ing's going to get real good real
fast," said a spokesman for
Snowbird operations. The fore
cast there is for snow through
out the week, and Alta obser
vers said they expected at least
another foot by the weekend
for their opening.
A bit north in Park City,
there was a 15-inch base
with three feet of snow at the
summit. Most of the snow was
from the weekend storm and
the forecast there was "sound
ing positive."
"There's no question about
it," said a Park City spokes
woman. "Winter is definitely
here " The Park City re
sort planned a weekend open
ing.
In California, both Squaw
Valley and Northstar reported
heavy snow, windy conditions
and cold temperatures. Snow
levels had not been measured,
but at Squaw Valley there was
an estimated two to three feet
at the top.
That level was considered "a
bit shallow" to ski presently,
bit with some more snow this
week expected, the resort
could open this weekend.
Northstar planned a
Thanksgiving opening.

In the South, Mammoth re
ported a little over a foot of
snow at the base with more
snow expected. With another
foot this week, a spokeswoman
said, a weekend opening is
possible.
Sun Valley in Idaho has had
snow continuously for the last
few days. According to a
spokeswoman there, snow is
also being manufactured on
the Warm Springs run. Open
ing is scheduled for Dec. 9, but
that could be moved to
Thanksgiving if the weather is
good.
Colorado areas were receiv
ing snow as well, but many of
the major resorts had less snow
than Utah or California resorts.

Steamboat received a few in
ches, but it will not open until
Dec. 2, according to a spokes
woman. The resort plans to
build a solid base rather than
"skiing it off early and be hurt
ing for the rest of the season."
Arapahoe Basin at Keystone
and Breckinridge both re
ported snow and expected to
open for the Thanksgiving
weekend.
Cross-country ski fans also
had good news. According to a
National Park Service spokes
man, the Nordic runs at Yose
mite National Park have about
a foot of snow which will
gradually compact into a good
base if snowfall continues as

expected this week. He said
things are still a bit powdery
now. Stanislav National Forest
also reported snow.
Yellowstone National Park in
Wyoming reported snowfall
this weekend, but sources said
only up to a foot had fallen in
some areas, about half of what
is needed for ski touring there.
Teton National Park filed a
similar report saying touring
there usually doesn't get un
derway until mid-December.
The National Weather Ser
vice in Redwood City re
ported that snow is likely
throughout the western state
mountains for the next two
weeks.

Forecaster John Plankinton
said heavy snows had fallen in
the Sierras and the Rockies and
would continue. Temperatures
were seasonally cold over the
weekend.
Winds are making condi
tions unpleasant in the Sierras,
he said.
Long-range forecasts call for
normal temperature ranges
and normal precipitation
levels, but he said such fore
casts cannot be very specific.
As to whether temperature
would rise to snow melt levels,
Plankinton said: "This late in
the season, any snow they (the
ski resorts)" get won't be lost
before spring."

Skiers will soon be filling the slopes again following the first
major snowstorm of the year this past weekend. In Utah, some
of the major resorts reported up to three feet of snow at the
summit. Utah slopes like this one received over 40 feet of snow

last year, and the National Weather Service says a normal snow
fall can be expected again this year. The heavy snows last
weekend prompted many resorts to move their openings to this
coming weekend.
