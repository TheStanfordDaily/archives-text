# S. Africa needs change
## Biden encourages U.S. action 
### SUSAN ESSOYAN 
White South Africans are held in
power by a "deep-seated belief that
the United States would save them if
things started to fall apart," Sen.
Joseph Biden (D-Del.) said in a
speech before about 75 people in
Kresge Auditorium last night.
The United States must fight to
eradicate this belief by demonstrat
ing that it is "not willing to be the
accomplice of the white minority in
South Africa," Biden said. Other
wise, the senator, a member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, pre
dicted a major upheaval in the area
in the next four to five years.
Although American policy toward
South Africa is no longer the "be
nign neglect," of the Nixon ad
ministration, there is a lot more the
United States can do, Biden said in
the speech, sponsored by SCOPE
and New Directions.
Biden rejected charges that the
South African government is unaf
fected by outside influence, saying
that "if nothing else, South Africa is
pragmatic."
Immovable?
"The view that South Africa is im
movable has not been borne out by
history," Biden said, citing cases in
which the country was forced to
adapt to survive. South Africa ag
reed to withdraw from Namibia
(Southwest Africa) following exter

nal pressure, Biden pointed out. In
ternational sanctions would un
doubtedly hurt the South African
government, Biden said, although
he said he does not favor such sanc
tions at this time.
Instead, Biden suggested the U.S.
government should change from a
neutral policy toward American in
vestment in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa to one of "ac
tive discouragement" that would
mean endorsing fair labor codes and
tightening the flow of capital from
this country to South Africa, he said.
South African law prevents blacks
from assuming positions of author
ity, according to Biden. But with suf
ficient pressure, he said he believed
the government would change its
policies on pay, job opportunities
and managerial opportunities.
Soviet threat
Fear of Soviet action in South Af
rica is unrealistic, Biden said. Al
though the Soviet Union played a
part in five major African upheavals,
it has been expelled from those
countries, he added.
American divestment of stocks in
companies operating in South Af
rica, as a means of protesting apar
theid, must be questioned because
such a move would increase un
employment among blacks in that
country, Biden said. The black un
employment level stands at 20 per

cent.
Divestment should be a last re
sort, he cautioned, listing alterna
tives including the improvement of
American corporate labor practices
in South Africa.
"Withdrawing American funds is
not in and of itself going to bring
down apartheid, but it could be an
important model," he said because
it could trigger similar British action.
Lobbying urged
Biden urged students to "lobby
and to write and to march" to
counter advertising by the South Af
rican government, which he said
presents only the best side of South
Africa to the American public.

doubtedly hurt the South African
government, Biden said, although
he said he does not favor such sanc
tions at this time.
Instead, Biden suggested the U.S.
government should change from a
neutral policy toward American in
vestment in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa to one of "ac
tive discouragement" that would
mean endorsing fair labor codes and
tightening the flow of capital from
this country to South Africa, he said.
South African law prevents blacks
from assuming positions of author
ity, according to Biden. But with suf
ficient pressure, he said he believed
the government would change its
policies on pay, job opportunities
and managerial opportunities.
Soviet threat
Fear of Soviet action in South Af
rica is unrealistic, Biden said. Al
though the Soviet Union played a
part in five major African upheavals,
it has been expelled from those
countries, he added.
American divestment of stocks in
companies operating in South Af
rica, as a means of protesting apar
theid, must be questioned because
such a move would increase un
employment among blacks in that
country, Biden said. The black un
employment level stands at 20 per

cent.
Divestment should be a last re
sort, he cautioned, listing alterna
tives including the improvement of
American corporate labor practices
in South Africa.
"Withdrawing American funds is
not in and of itself going to bring
down apartheid, but it could be an
important model," he said because
it could trigger similar British action.
Lobbying urged
Biden urged students to "lobby
and to write and to march" to
counter advertising by the South Af
rican government, which he said
presents only the best side of South
Africa to the American public.


Sen. Joseph Biden
White South Africans are held in
power by a "deep-seated belief that
the United States would save them if
things started to fall apart," Sen.
Joseph Biden (D-Del.) said in a
speech before about 75 people in
Kresge Auditorium last night.
The United States must fight to
eradicate this belief by demonstrat
ing that it is "not willing to be the
accomplice of the white minority in
South Africa," Biden said. Other
wise, the senator, a member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, pre
dicted a major upheaval in the area
in the next four to five years.
Although American policy toward
South Africa is no longer the "be
nign neglect," of the Nixon ad
ministration, there is a lot more the
United States can do, Biden said in
the speech, sponsored by SCOPE
and New Directions.
Biden rejected charges that the
South African government is unaf
fected by outside influence, saying
that "if nothing else, South Africa is
pragmatic."
Immovable?
"The view that South Africa is im
movable has not been borne out by
history," Biden said, citing cases in
which the country was forced to
adapt to survive. South Africa ag
reed to withdraw from Namibia
(Southwest Africa) following exter

nal pressure, Biden pointed out. In
ternational sanctions would un
doubtedly hurt the South African
government, Biden said, although
he said he does not favor such sanc
tions at this time.
