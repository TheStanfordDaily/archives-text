# Nordic skiing gains in popularity nationally

In 1963, Jean Pierre Pascal was drafted by the French
Army and sent on a training exercise on cross
country skis. After a few kilometers, Pascal was con
vinced he never wanted to be in the French Army or on
cross-country skis again.
But today, Pascal has enlisted in the ever-increasing
ranks of the Nordic Army cross-country ski enthusiasts
who are refusing to march to the pencil-tapping of the
Alpine (downhill) ski industry's financial accountants.
Pascal is Squaw Valley's Ski School Director, and has
been watching the exodus to cross-country skiing.
"The tremendous growth in Nordic skiing is due to
the price increase in Alpine skiing," Pascal said in a
telephone interview.
/ /'"The number of Alpine skiers increases about 20
X percent a year," he continued, "but the number
of Nordic skiers increases about 50 percent a year."
And for good reason â€” Squaw Valley lift tickets will
be $15 this season, Pascal said. A Squaw Valley Nordic
skiing pass, which gives the user access to packed trails
with two ski tracks, will be $3, he added.
There is also a big difference between the skis that go
in tracks and skis that go on slopes, Pascal said.
Kevin Kovac, an employee in Palo Alto's North Face

mountaineering shop, filled in the prices.
t $200, you can get the best equipment in Nor-
Jl die skiing, but it would cost you $600 or $700 to
get the same equipment in Alpine," Kovac said. "You
can get skis for about $100, boots for $50, bindings and
poles for about $10 each.
"Some Alpine skis alone cost $400."
Kovac also added that backpacking equipment and
clothing can be used for Nordic skiing, thus saving the
Nordic skier more money.
In other words, Nordic skiers don't need hot-pink
aluminum jump suits with gold-plated zippers.
Instead, Pascal said Nordic skiers go skiing to see
and not to be seen.
/ /' I 'hat's why I. went back to it four years ago," he
A said. "All the people on the slopes makes Al
pine skiing too civilized, too artificial. Nordic skiing is
getting back into the woods and being quiet for awhile.
"I appreciate it more now because you have the
freedom to go where you want to go without anybody
telling you, and to see what you want to see.
"Alpine skiing is not only more expensive, it's like
being on a highway."

But skiers who leave the highways on the slopes
have to do so under their own power. As North Face's
Kovac puts it,"the only thing is, you have to figure on
doing some physical exericse in Nordic skiing."
But that's the reason people are turning away from
lift lines, says Squaw Valley's Jack Kappas, Nordic
coach of the Far West Junior National Olympic Team.
"Nordic skiing is a perfect combination for people
who like to ski and are physically fit," said Kappas.
"As soon as runners who ski try it, they like it, because
it's a natural combination of the two."
Increased interest in Nordic skiing started with a guy
named Bill Koch. Koch won a silver medal in 30-
kilometer Nordic skiing in the 1976 Olympics in In
nsbruck, marking the first time in years that guys
named Hans, Fritz and Igor didn't sweep the event.
/ / O ince that happened, there's been more competi-
in the U. 5.," Kappas said. "Koch showed
that American Nordic skiers have potential, and that
we have depth in the U.S."
Nordic skiing had potential, too. Nine years ago,
said Kappas, when the first Yosemite Nordic Holiday
