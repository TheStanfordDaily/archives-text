## Buyers' Guide: Self-knowledge needed to make intelligent choice 
### 
Looking for ski equipment?
The watchword is "know
thyself." When choosing
among the many types of skis,
boots, poles and binding on
the market, the best guide is a
fair assessment of your own
ability, local ski experts say.
Where do you ski? Are you
aggressive? What length of skis
are you looking for now? How
many days did you ski last
year? How much do you hope
to ski this year?
"Most people tend to be
either too modest or they
exaggerate their ability" says
Howie Rosen, co-captain of the
ski team here. However, accu
rate answers to these questions
matched with a knowledgable
salesperson or your own re
searched product knowledge
can lead to the right type of
equipment.
Boots
Boots are the single most
important piece of equipment,
all sources agree. "You can't
get by with the wrong boots,"
Dennis Medina of the Ski Hut
said. "They arc the only part
you feel physically. Its possible
to ski on all sorts of skis, but if
your boots don't fit, you won't
be comfortable."
According to Laurie Drake
of Short Swing, boots are
the instrument that tell the ski
what to do, and.j good boot is

one which is comfortable and
which fits.
A common problem is buy
ing a boot which is too big.
When a person stands upright
in a ski boot, Drake said, his or
her toes should touch the end
of the boot. When the knees
are flexed the toes back off
from the front of the boot
achieving a proper fit.
A too-big boot slows down
the response of the ski. It can
also cause some skiers to "steer
with their toes" and foot
cramps sometimes result.
There are two basic types of
boots: a stiffer boot for a more
advanced skier and a sgfter,
more flexible boot.
A stiffer boot is very respon
sive to the movements of
the skier, but it doesn't allow
for many mistakes. A beginner
who buys a very stiff boot will
"end up eating snow and
wondering why," Rosen said.
A beginning boot leaves more
room for mistakes and may be
slightly lower in calf length.
Boot prices according to
Drake range from $59 to $235,
and she said $150 is an average
price.
Skis
When choosing skis, "be
honest about the kind of skier
you are and the kid of skier you
want to be," Medina said.
Seven to eight years ago

choosing skis was apparently
easier. Rosen explained that
the tail of the ski was placed on
the boot and when your arm
was extended over your head a
ski of the correct length
reached to the middle of your
hand.
Today there are more factors
to be considered: abililty, ag
gressiveness and weight. Ac
cording to Rosen, Ski magazine
has devised a point system to
measure these factors, called
the 'Golden Rule.'
A beginner's choices are not
so complicated. A begin
ner will learn best today on a
compact ski. It is shorter and
wider than the traditional
"over your head" ski, stable at
lower speeds and easy to turn.
A ski of this type, said
Drake, will carry a beginner up
to the intermediate level or
continue to satisfy a more con
servative skier.
Compact skis are often of
fered in a package deal by the
manufacturer. Skis, bindings
and the cost of mounting the
bindings are included in one
price which Drake said ranged
from $159 to $200.
Medina set the bottom figure
lower but said that a ski which
costs less than $100 is "no
good." He said, however, that
for a person who skis two to
