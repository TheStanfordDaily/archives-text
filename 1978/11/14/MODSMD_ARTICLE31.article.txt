## Buyers' Guide: Self-knowledge needed to make intelligent choice 
### 
Looking for ski equipment?
The watchword is "know
thyself." When choosing
among the many types of skis,
boots, poles and binding on
the market, the best guide is a
fair assessment of your own
ability, local ski experts say.
Where do you ski? Are you
aggressive? What length of skis
are you looking for now? How
many days did you ski last
year? How much do you hope
to ski this year?
"Most people tend to be
either too modest or they
exaggerate their ability" says
Howie Rosen, co-captain of the
ski team here. However, accu
rate answers to these questions
matched with a knowledgable
salesperson or your own re
searched product knowledge
can lead to the right type of
equipment.
Boots
Boots are the single most
important piece of equipment,
all sources agree. "You can't
get by with the wrong boots,"
Dennis Medina of the Ski Hut
said. "They arc the only part
you feel physically. Its possible
to ski on all sorts of skis, but if
your boots don't fit, you won't
be comfortable."
According to Laurie Drake
of Short Swing, boots are
the instrument that tell the ski
what to do, and.j good boot is

one which is comfortable and
which fits.
A common problem is buy
ing a boot which is too big.
When a person stands upright
in a ski boot, Drake said, his or
her toes should touch the end
of the boot. When the knees
are flexed the toes back off
from the front of the boot
achieving a proper fit.
A too-big boot slows down
the response of the ski. It can
also cause some skiers to "steer
with their toes" and foot
cramps sometimes result.
There are two basic types of
boots: a stiffer boot for a more
advanced skier and a sgfter,
more flexible boot.
A stiffer boot is very respon
sive to the movements of
the skier, but it doesn't allow
for many mistakes. A beginner
who buys a very stiff boot will
"end up eating snow and
wondering why," Rosen said.
A beginning boot leaves more
room for mistakes and may be
slightly lower in calf length.
Boot prices according to
Drake range from $59 to $235,
and she said $150 is an average
price.
Skis
When choosing skis, "be
honest about the kind of skier
you are and the kid of skier you
want to be," Medina said.
Seven to eight years ago

choosing skis was apparently
easier. Rosen explained that
the tail of the ski was placed on
the boot and when your arm
was extended over your head a
ski of the correct length
reached to the middle of your
hand.
Today there are more factors
to be considered: abililty, ag
gressiveness and weight. Ac
cording to Rosen, Ski magazine
has devised a point system to
measure these factors, called
the 'Golden Rule.'
A beginner's choices are not
so complicated. A begin
ner will learn best today on a
compact ski. It is shorter and
wider than the traditional
"over your head" ski, stable at
lower speeds and easy to turn.
A ski of this type, said
Drake, will carry a beginner up
to the intermediate level or
continue to satisfy a more con
servative skier.
Compact skis are often of
fered in a package deal by the
manufacturer. Skis, bindings
and the cost of mounting the
bindings are included in one
price which Drake said ranged
from $159 to $200.
Medina set the bottom figure
lower but said that a ski which
costs less than $100 is "no
good." He said, however, that
for a person who skis two to

ity before buying equipment.
three times a year and doesn't
ski very hard, a less expensive
ski will fulfill their needs.
Skis for intermediate skiers
(as about 90 percent of U.S.
skiers are according to Medina)
and advanced skiers have a
wider range of variables to
choose among, some of which
are decided by preference,
some by ability and some by
weight.
Skis for better skiers are
longer and narrower than a
compact ski and provide stabil
ity at higher speeds. At higher
speeds, a short ski will "chat
ter," vibrate up and down, ac
cording to Rosen. Full length
skis are for those who ski hard
and fast or in a variety of condi
tions.
Full-length skis fall into two
basic types: performance skis,
designed for precision skiing,
and recreational skis which are
more "forgiving;" you can
make mistakes and not get in
trouble. A forgiving ski is sof
ter, absorbing more of the im
pact, and is responsive, but
less precise.
Mid-length skis are a com
promise between the full
length and the compact ski.
Drake said mid-length skis
solve the conflict between full
lengths and compacts regard

ing moguls. If the moguls have
been skiied solely by compact
skis, and a skier on a pair of
full-lengths comes skiing
through, "the pattern isn't
there" due to the very different
turning radius of the compact
skis.
The mid-length ski is more
stable than the compact at
higher speeds, and allows for
ease in turning. It usually has a
soft tip to absorb the impact of
the mogul. These skis are suit
able for an aggressive learner,
an intermediate or an ad
vanced skier. Full-length are
for the intermediate or ad
vanced. In each case, a more
aggressive skier may opt for
the stiffer, more precise ski.
Within each "category" of
skis, each ski offers different
combinations of specifications.
Sometimes the differences are
more subtle than the average
skier will notice. Some differ
ences include:
—side cut, the waist or taper
of the ski is a factor in the pre
cision of the turn.
—flex, the flexibility of the
ski, longitudinally and torsion
ally. Among other things, this
affects the ability of the ski to
absorb impact.
—length, measured in cen
timeters. A longer ski for stabil
ity at higher speeds, less length

for ease in turning.
—stiffness, desirable for
quick pivot turns and a gener
ally sensitive ski.
Drake said all the skis they
carry are "good skis," but they
just do different things.
The skier's weight limits the
lengths of skis available to
him from any one type of ski,
based on manufacturer's
specifications. But one length
of ski, 180 centimeters for
example, will range through
many types of skis. The prices
range from $170 to $280.
Because of all the variables,
Rosen thinks the process of
choosing skis is "irrational."
Buyers must make some
choices not governed by
specific guidelines, Rosen said.
In some cases, this may come
to the cosmetics or appearance
of one ski over another. But
Drake said that "most people
who have skied come to the
shop with some preferences."
What about Olin, K-2, Ros
signol, Molnar, Hexcel
and other big names?
Salespeople say the name
brands are good. Medina said
the difference between some
name brands and "no names"
is that name brands often offer
a better guarantee.
There are, however, spe

cialty brands such as Pre which
have "no name" with the gen
eral public because they are
quality skis for the more ad
vanced and experienced skier.
Medina added that ski
equipment and skiing have a
built-in pitfall: because one's
equipment reflects one's abil
ity, people tend to buy beyond
their ability as a means to
status.
Poles
Ski poles are for planting as
you turn and most of them
range from $15 to $45. Any
pole under $15 will bend easily
according to Medina, while
poles from $15 to $25 are de
cent.
From $25 to $40 the poles are
probably of identical quality,
light weight and durable, but
in the upper end of the price
range the buyer begins to pay
for frills. In fact there are even
poles with stopwatches for $70
said Medina.
Bindings
Bindings are of two types:
standard and plate. Standard
bindings have a toe piece and a
heel piece and release the boot
in an upwards direction. Plate
bindings are newer and Rosen
said he considers them safer
because they release the boot
in more directions.
Ski bindings also come with

a safety or running strap which
leaves the ski attached to your
ankle if the boot comes out.
Although Salomon bindings
are the best advertised they are
neither the only good bindings
nor the best price, Drake said.
Binding prices in general range
from $50 to $115.
If a buyer wants to save
money, ski sales are usually
held in the spring said Rosen,
with savings up to 20 to 30 per
cent if the model is being dis
continued.
Popular skis are likely to be
stored until fall, although in
fall there is a discount on the
previous years equipment.
Rosen suggested reading some
trade publications for more
product information. He said
three fall issues of Ski
Magazine — September, Oc
tober and November — have
especially helpful details on
skis.
Buying ski equipment is a
two-sided process. Rosen said
he feels "it's unfair to expect
the salesperson to give you the
right kind of skis." But Medina
and Drake both felt it impor
tant that a customer use a
service-oriented shop when
the sales people will also at
tempt to determine a skiers in
terest and ability. In the end
the decision must be the
buyer's. -Gayle Ashton

is that name brands often offer
a better guarantee.
There are, however, spe

cialty brands such as Pre which
have "no name" with the gen
eral public because they are
quality skis for the more ad
vanced and experienced skier.
Medina added that ski
equipment and skiing have a
built-in pitfall: because one's
equipment reflects one's abil
ity, people tend to buy beyond
their ability as a means to
status.
Poles
Ski poles are for planting as
you turn and most of them
range from $15 to $45. Any
pole under $15 will bend easily
according to Medina, while
poles from $15 to $25 are de
cent.
From $25 to $40 the poles are
probably of identical quality,
light weight and durable, but
in the upper end of the price
range the buyer begins to pay
for frills. In fact there are even
poles with stopwatches for $70
said Medina.
Bindings
Bindings are of two types:
standard and plate. Standard
bindings have a toe piece and a
heel piece and release the boot
in an upwards direction. Plate
bindings are newer and Rosen
said he considers them safer
because they release the boot
in more directions.
Ski bindings also come with

a safety or running strap which
leaves the ski attached to your
ankle if the boot comes out.
Although Salomon bindings
are the best advertised they are
neither the only good bindings
nor the best price, Drake said.
Binding prices in general range
from $50 to $115.
If a buyer wants to save
money, ski sales are usually
held in the spring said Rosen,
with savings up to 20 to 30 per
cent if the model is being dis
continued.
Popular skis are likely to be
stored until fall, although in
fall there is a discount on the
previous years equipment.
Rosen suggested reading some
trade publications for more
product information. He said
three fall issues of Ski
Magazine — September, Oc
tober and November — have
especially helpful details on
skis.
Buying ski equipment is a
two-sided process. Rosen said
he feels "it's unfair to expect
the salesperson to give you the
right kind of skis." But Medina
and Drake both felt it impor
tant that a customer use a

buyer's. -Gayle Ashton
three times a year and doesn't
ski very hard, a less expensive
ski will fulfill their needs.
Skis for intermediate skiers
(as about 90 percent of U.S.
skiers are according to Medina)
and advanced skiers have a
wider range of variables to
choose among, some of which
are decided by preference,
some by ability and some by
weight.
Skis for better skiers are
longer and narrower than a
compact ski and provide stabil
ity at higher speeds. At higher
speeds, a short ski will "chat
ter," vibrate up and down, ac
cording to Rosen. Full length
skis are for those who ski hard
and fast or in a variety of condi
tions.
Full-length skis fall into two
basic types: performance skis,
designed for precision skiing,
and recreational skis which are
more "forgiving;" you can
make mistakes and not get in
trouble. A forgiving ski is sof
ter, absorbing more of the im
pact, and is responsive, but
less precise.
Mid-length skis are a com
promise between the full
length and the compact ski.
Drake said mid-length skis
solve the conflict between full
lengths and compacts regard

ing moguls. If the moguls have
been skiied solely by compact
skis, and a skier on a pair of
full-lengths comes skiing
through, "the pattern isn't
there" due to the very different
turning radius of the compact
skis.
The mid-length ski is more
stable than the compact at
higher speeds, and allows for
ease in turning. It usually has a
soft tip to absorb the impact of
the mogul. These skis are suit
able for an aggressive learner,
an intermediate or an ad
vanced skier. Full-length are
for the intermediate or ad
vanced. In each case, a more
aggressive skier may opt for
the stiffer, more precise ski.
Within each "category" of
skis, each ski offers different
combinations of specifications.
Sometimes the differences are
more subtle than the average
skier will notice. Some differ
ences include:
—side cut, the waist or taper
of the ski is a factor in the pre
cision of the turn.
—flex, the flexibility of the
ski, longitudinally and torsion
ally. Among other things, this
affects the ability of the ski to
absorb impact.
—length, measured in cen
timeters. A longer ski for stabil
ity at higher speeds, less length

for ease in turning.
—stiffness, desirable for
quick pivot turns and a gener
ally sensitive ski.
Drake said all the skis they
carry are "good skis," but they
just do different things.
The skier's weight limits the
lengths of skis available to
him from any one type of ski,
based on manufacturer's
specifications. But one length
of ski, 180 centimeters for
example, will range through
many types of skis. The prices
range from $170 to $280.
Because of all the variables,
Rosen thinks the process of
choosing skis is "irrational."
Buyers must make some
choices not governed by
specific guidelines, Rosen said.
In some cases, this may come
to the cosmetics or appearance
of one ski over another. But
Drake said that "most people
who have skied come to the
shop with some preferences."
What about Olin, K-2, Ros
signol, Molnar, Hexcel
and other big names?
Salespeople say the name
brands are good. Medina said

Looking for ski equipment?
The watchword is "know
thyself." When choosing
among the many types of skis,
boots, poles and binding on
the market, the best guide is a
fair assessment of your own
ability, local ski experts say.
Where do you ski? Are you
aggressive? What length of skis
are you looking for now? How
many days did you ski last
year? How much do you hope
to ski this year?
"Most people tend to be
either too modest or they
exaggerate their ability" says
Howie Rosen, co-captain of the
ski team here. However, accu
rate answers to these questions
matched with a knowledgable
salesperson or your own re
searched product knowledge
can lead to the right type of
equipment.
Boots
Boots are the single most
important piece of equipment,
all sources agree. "You can't
get by with the wrong boots,"
Dennis Medina of the Ski Hut
said. "They arc the only part
you feel physically. Its possible
to ski on all sorts of skis, but if
your boots don't fit, you won't
be comfortable."
According to Laurie Drake
of Short Swing, boots are
the instrument that tell the ski
what to do, and.j good boot is

one which is comfortable and
which fits.
A common problem is buy
ing a boot which is too big.
When a person stands upright
in a ski boot, Drake said, his or
her toes should touch the end
of the boot. When the knees
are flexed the toes back off
from the front of the boot
achieving a proper fit.
A too-big boot slows down
the response of the ski. It can
also cause some skiers to "steer
with their toes" and foot
cramps sometimes result.
There are two basic types of
boots: a stiffer boot for a more
advanced skier and a sgfter,
more flexible boot.
A stiffer boot is very respon
sive to the movements of
the skier, but it doesn't allow
for many mistakes. A beginner
who buys a very stiff boot will
"end up eating snow and
wondering why," Rosen said.
A beginning boot leaves more
room for mistakes and may be
slightly lower in calf length.
Boot prices according to
Drake range from $59 to $235,
and she said $150 is an average
price.
Skis
When choosing skis, "be
honest about the kind of skier
you are and the kid of skier you
want to be," Medina said.
Seven to eight years ago

choosing skis was apparently
easier. Rosen explained that
the tail of the ski was placed on
the boot and when your arm
was extended over your head a
ski of the correct length
reached to the middle of your
hand.
Today there are more factors
to be considered: abililty, ag
gressiveness and weight. Ac
cording to Rosen, Ski magazine
has devised a point system to
measure these factors, called
the 'Golden Rule.'
A beginner's choices are not
so complicated. A begin
ner will learn best today on a
compact ski. It is shorter and
wider than the traditional
"over your head" ski, stable at
lower speeds and easy to turn.
A ski of this type, said
Drake, will carry a beginner up
to the intermediate level or
continue to satisfy a more con
servative skier.
Compact skis are often of
fered in a package deal by the
manufacturer. Skis, bindings
and the cost of mounting the
bindings are included in one
price which Drake said ranged
from $159 to $200.
Medina set the bottom figure
lower but said that a ski which
costs less than $100 is "no
good." He said, however, that
for a person who skis two to

the 'Golden Rule.'
A beginner's choices are not
so complicated. A begin
ner will learn best today on a
compact ski. It is shorter and
wider than the traditional
"over your head" ski, stable at
lower speeds and easy to turn.
A ski of this type, said
Drake, will carry a beginner up
to the intermediate level or
continue to satisfy a more con
servative skier.
Compact skis are often of
fered in a package deal by the
manufacturer. Skis, bindings
and the cost of mounting the
bindings are included in one
price which Drake said ranged
from $159 to $200.
Medina set the bottom figure
lower but said that a ski which
costs less than $100 is "no
good." He said, however, that

ity before buying equipment.
three times a year and doesn't
ski very hard, a less expensive
ski will fulfill their needs.
Skis for intermediate skiers
(as about 90 percent of U.S.
skiers are according to Medina)
and advanced skiers have a
wider range of variables to
choose among, some of which
are decided by preference,
some by ability and some by
weight.
Skis for better skiers are
longer and narrower than a
compact ski and provide stabil
ity at higher speeds. At higher
speeds, a short ski will "chat
ter," vibrate up and down, ac
cording to Rosen. Full length
skis are for those who ski hard
and fast or in a variety of condi
tions.
Full-length skis fall into two
basic types: performance skis,
designed for precision skiing,
and recreational skis which are
more "forgiving;" you can
make mistakes and not get in
trouble. A forgiving ski is sof
ter, absorbing more of the im
pact, and is responsive, but
less precise.
Mid-length skis are a com
promise between the full
length and the compact ski.
Drake said mid-length skis
solve the conflict between full
lengths and compacts regard

ing moguls. If the moguls have
been skiied solely by compact
skis, and a skier on a pair of
full-lengths comes skiing
through, "the pattern isn't
there" due to the very different
turning radius of the compact
skis.
The mid-length ski is more
stable than the compact at
higher speeds, and allows for
ease in turning. It usually has a
soft tip to absorb the impact of
the mogul. These skis are suit
able for an aggressive learner,
an intermediate or an ad
vanced skier. Full-length are
for the intermediate or ad
vanced. In each case, a more
aggressive skier may opt for
the stiffer, more precise ski.
Within each "category" of
skis, each ski offers different
combinations of specifications.
Sometimes the differences are
more subtle than the average
skier will notice. Some differ
ences include:
—side cut, the waist or taper
of the ski is a factor in the pre
cision of the turn.
—flex, the flexibility of the
ski, longitudinally and torsion
ally. Among other things, this
affects the ability of the ski to
absorb impact.
—length, measured in cen
timeters. A longer ski for stabil
ity at higher speeds, less length

for ease in turning.
—stiffness, desirable for
quick pivot turns and a gener
ally sensitive ski.
Drake said all the skis they
carry are "good skis," but they
just do different things.
The skier's weight limits the
lengths of skis available to
him from any one type of ski,
based on manufacturer's
specifications. But one length
of ski, 180 centimeters for
example, will range through
many types of skis. The prices
range from $170 to $280.
Because of all the variables,
Rosen thinks the process of
choosing skis is "irrational."
Buyers must make some
choices not governed by
specific guidelines, Rosen said.
In some cases, this may come
to the cosmetics or appearance
of one ski over another. But
Drake said that "most people
who have skied come to the
shop with some preferences."
What about Olin, K-2, Ros
signol, Molnar, Hexcel
and other big names?
Salespeople say the name
brands are good. Medina said
the difference between some
name brands and "no names"
is that name brands often offer
a better guarantee.
There are, however, spe

cialty brands such as Pre which
have "no name" with the gen
eral public because they are
quality skis for the more ad
vanced and experienced skier.
Medina added that ski
equipment and skiing have a
built-in pitfall: because one's
equipment reflects one's abil
ity, people tend to buy beyond
their ability as a means to
status.
Poles
Ski poles are for planting as
you turn and most of them
range from $15 to $45. Any
pole under $15 will bend easily
according to Medina, while
poles from $15 to $25 are de
cent.
From $25 to $40 the poles are
probably of identical quality,
light weight and durable, but
in the upper end of the price
range the buyer begins to pay
for frills. In fact there are even
poles with stopwatches for $70
said Medina.
Bindings
Bindings are of two types:
standard and plate. Standard
bindings have a toe piece and a
heel piece and release the boot
in an upwards direction. Plate
bindings are newer and Rosen
said he considers them safer
because they release the boot
in more directions.
Ski bindings also come with

a safety or running strap which
leaves the ski attached to your
ankle if the boot comes out.
Although Salomon bindings
are the best advertised they are
neither the only good bindings
nor the best price, Drake said.
Binding prices in general range
from $50 to $115.
If a buyer wants to save
money, ski sales are usually
held in the spring said Rosen,
with savings up to 20 to 30 per
cent if the model is being dis
continued.
Popular skis are likely to be
stored until fall, although in
fall there is a discount on the
previous years equipment.
Rosen suggested reading some
trade publications for more
product information. He said
three fall issues of Ski
Magazine — September, Oc
tober and November — have
especially helpful details on
skis.
Buying ski equipment is a
two-sided process. Rosen said
he feels "it's unfair to expect
the salesperson to give you the
right kind of skis." But Medina
and Drake both felt it impor
tant that a customer use a
service-oriented shop when
the sales people will also at
tempt to determine a skiers in
terest and ability. In the end
the decision must be the
buyer's. -Gayle Ashton
Looking for ski equipment?
The watchword is "know
thyself." When choosing
among the many types of skis,
boots, poles and binding on
the market, the best guide is a
fair assessment of your own
ability, local ski experts say.
Where do you ski? Are you
aggressive? What length of skis
are you looking for now? How
many days did you ski last
year? How much do you hope
to ski this year?
"Most people tend to be
either too modest or they
exaggerate their ability" says
Howie Rosen, co-captain of the
ski team here. However, accu
rate answers to these questions
matched with a knowledgable
salesperson or your own re
searched product knowledge
can lead to the right type of
equipment.
Boots
Boots are the single most
important piece of equipment,
all sources agree. "You can't
get by with the wrong boots,"
Dennis Medina of the Ski Hut
said. "They arc the only part
you feel physically. Its possible
to ski on all sorts of skis, but if
your boots don't fit, you won't
be comfortable."
According to Laurie Drake
of Short Swing, boots are
the instrument that tell the ski
what to do, and.j good boot is

one which is comfortable and
which fits.
A common problem is buy
ing a boot which is too big.
When a person stands upright
in a ski boot, Drake said, his or
her toes should touch the end
of the boot. When the knees
are flexed the toes back off
from the front of the boot
achieving a proper fit.
A too-big boot slows down
the response of the ski. It can
also cause some skiers to "steer
with their toes" and foot
cramps sometimes result.
There are two basic types of
boots: a stiffer boot for a more
advanced skier and a sgfter,
more flexible boot.
A stiffer boot is very respon
sive to the movements of
the skier, but it doesn't allow
for many mistakes. A beginner
who buys a very stiff boot will
"end up eating snow and
wondering why," Rosen said.
A beginning boot leaves more
room for mistakes and may be
slightly lower in calf length.
Boot prices according to
Drake range from $59 to $235,
and she said $150 is an average
price.
Skis
When choosing skis, "be
honest about the kind of skier
you are and the kid of skier you
want to be," Medina said.
Seven to eight years ago

choosing skis was apparently
easier. Rosen explained that
the tail of the ski was placed on
the boot and when your arm
was extended over your head a
ski of the correct length
reached to the middle of your
hand.
Today there are more factors
to be considered: abililty, ag
gressiveness and weight. Ac
cording to Rosen, Ski magazine
has devised a point system to
measure these factors, called
the 'Golden Rule.'

compact ski and provide stabil
ity at higher speeds. At higher
speeds, a short ski will "chat
ter," vibrate up and down, ac
cording to Rosen. Full length
skis are for those who ski hard
and fast or in a variety of condi
tions.
Full-length skis fall into two
basic types: performance skis,
designed for precision skiing,
and recreational skis which are
more "forgiving;" you can
make mistakes and not get in
trouble. A forgiving ski is sof
ter, absorbing more of the im
pact, and is responsive, but
less precise.
Mid-length skis are a com
promise between the full
length and the compact ski.
Drake said mid-length skis
solve the conflict between full
lengths and compacts regard

ing moguls. If the moguls have
been skiied solely by compact
skis, and a skier on a pair of
full-lengths comes skiing
through, "the pattern isn't
there" due to the very different
turning radius of the compact
skis.
The mid-length ski is more
stable than the compact at
higher speeds, and allows for
ease in turning. It usually has a
soft tip to absorb the impact of
the mogul. These skis are suit
able for an aggressive learner,
an intermediate or an ad
vanced skier. Full-length are
for the intermediate or ad
vanced. In each case, a more
aggressive skier may opt for
the stiffer, more precise ski.
Within each "category" of
skis, each ski offers different
combinations of specifications.
Sometimes the differences are
more subtle than the average
skier will notice. Some differ
ences include:
—side cut, the waist or taper
of the ski is a factor in the pre
cision of the turn.
—flex, the flexibility of the
ski, longitudinally and torsion
ally. Among other things, this
affects the ability of the ski to
absorb impact.
—length, measured in cen
timeters. A longer ski for stabil
ity at higher speeds, less length

for ease in turning.
—stiffness, desirable for
quick pivot turns and a gener
ally sensitive ski.
Drake said all the skis they
carry are "good skis," but they
just do different things.
The skier's weight limits the
lengths of skis available to
him from any one type of ski,
based on manufacturer's
specifications. But one length
of ski, 180 centimeters for
example, will range through
many types of skis. The prices
range from $170 to $280.
Because of all the variables,
Rosen thinks the process of
choosing skis is "irrational."
Buyers must make some
choices not governed by
specific guidelines, Rosen said.
In some cases, this may come
to the cosmetics or appearance
of one ski over another. But
Drake said that "most people
who have skied come to the
shop with some preferences."
What about Olin, K-2, Ros
signol, Molnar, Hexcel
and other big names?
Salespeople say the name
brands are good. Medina said
the difference between some
name brands and "no names"
is that name brands often offer
a better guarantee.
There are, however, spe

cialty brands such as Pre which
have "no name" with the gen
eral public because they are
quality skis for the more ad
vanced and experienced skier.
Medina added that ski
equipment and skiing have a
built-in pitfall: because one's
equipment reflects one's abil
ity, people tend to buy beyond
their ability as a means to
status.
Poles
Ski poles are for planting as
you turn and most of them
range from $15 to $45. Any
pole under $15 will bend easily
according to Medina, while
poles from $15 to $25 are de
cent.
From $25 to $40 the poles are
probably of identical quality,
light weight and durable, but
in the upper end of the price
range the buyer begins to pay
for frills. In fact there are even
poles with stopwatches for $70
said Medina.
Bindings
Bindings are of two types:
standard and plate. Standard
bindings have a toe piece and a
heel piece and release the boot
in an upwards direction. Plate
bindings are newer and Rosen
said he considers them safer
because they release the boot
in more directions.
Ski bindings also come with

a safety or running strap which
leaves the ski attached to your
ankle if the boot comes out.
Although Salomon bindings
are the best advertised they are
neither the only good bindings
nor the best price, Drake said.
Binding prices in general range
from $50 to $115.
If a buyer wants to save
money, ski sales are usually
held in the spring said Rosen,
with savings up to 20 to 30 per
cent if the model is being dis
continued.
Popular skis are likely to be
stored until fall, although in
fall there is a discount on the
previous years equipment.
Rosen suggested reading some
trade publications for more
product information. He said
three fall issues of Ski
Magazine — September, Oc
tober and November — have
especially helpful details on
skis.
Buying ski equipment is a
two-sided process. Rosen said
he feels "it's unfair to expect
the salesperson to give you the
right kind of skis." But Medina
and Drake both felt it impor
tant that a customer use a
service-oriented shop when
the sales people will also at
tempt to determine a skiers in
terest and ability. In the end
the decision must be the
buyer's. -Gayle Ashton
Looking for ski equipment?
The watchword is "know
thyself." When choosing
among the many types of skis,
boots, poles and binding on
the market, the best guide is a
fair assessment of your own
ability, local ski experts say.
Where do you ski? Are you
aggressive? What length of skis
are you looking for now? How
many days did you ski last
year? How much do you hope
to ski this year?
"Most people tend to be
either too modest or they
exaggerate their ability" says
Howie Rosen, co-captain of the
ski team here. However, accu
rate answers to these questions
matched with a knowledgable
salesperson or your own re
searched product knowledge
can lead to the right type of
equipment.
Boots
Boots are the single most
important piece of equipment,
all sources agree. "You can't
get by with the wrong boots,"
Dennis Medina of the Ski Hut
said. "They arc the only part
you feel physically. Its possible
to ski on all sorts of skis, but if
your boots don't fit, you won't
be comfortable."
According to Laurie Drake
of Short Swing, boots are
the instrument that tell the ski
what to do, and.j good boot is

one which is comfortable and
which fits.
A common problem is buy
ing a boot which is too big.
When a person stands upright
in a ski boot, Drake said, his or
her toes should touch the end
of the boot. When the knees
are flexed the toes back off
from the front of the boot
achieving a proper fit.
A too-big boot slows down
the response of the ski. It can
also cause some skiers to "steer
with their toes" and foot
cramps sometimes result.
There are two basic types of
boots: a stiffer boot for a more
advanced skier and a sgfter,
more flexible boot.
A stiffer boot is very respon
sive to the movements of
the skier, but it doesn't allow
for many mistakes. A beginner
who buys a very stiff boot will
"end up eating snow and
wondering why," Rosen said.
A beginning boot leaves more
room for mistakes and may be
slightly lower in calf length.
Boot prices according to
Drake range from $59 to $235,
and she said $150 is an average
price.
Skis
When choosing skis, "be
honest about the kind of skier
you are and the kid of skier you
want to be," Medina said.
Seven to eight years ago

choosing skis was apparently
easier. Rosen explained that
the tail of the ski was placed on
the boot and when your arm
was extended over your head a
ski of the correct length
reached to the middle of your
hand.
Today there are more factors
to be considered: abililty, ag
gressiveness and weight. Ac
cording to Rosen, Ski magazine
has devised a point system to
measure these factors, called
the 'Golden Rule.'
A beginner's choices are not
so complicated. A begin
ner will learn best today on a
compact ski. It is shorter and
wider than the traditional
"over your head" ski, stable at
lower speeds and easy to turn.
A ski of this type, said
Drake, will carry a beginner up
to the intermediate level or
continue to satisfy a more con
servative skier.
Compact skis are often of
fered in a package deal by the
manufacturer. Skis, bindings
and the cost of mounting the
bindings are included in one
price which Drake said ranged
from $159 to $200.
Medina set the bottom figure
lower but said that a ski which
costs less than $100 is "no
good." He said, however, that
for a person who skis two to

ity before buying equipment.
three times a year and doesn't
ski very hard, a less expensive
ski will fulfill their needs.
Skis for intermediate skiers
(as about 90 percent of U.S.
skiers are according to Medina)
and advanced skiers have a
wider range of variables to
choose among, some of which
are decided by preference,
some by ability and some by
weight.
Skis for better skiers are
longer and narrower than a
compact ski and provide stabil
ity at higher speeds. At higher
speeds, a short ski will "chat

skis, each ski offers different
combinations of specifications.
Sometimes the differences are
more subtle than the average
skier will notice. Some differ
ences include:
—side cut, the waist or taper
of the ski is a factor in the pre
cision of the turn.
—flex, the flexibility of the
ski, longitudinally and torsion
ally. Among other things, this
affects the ability of the ski to
absorb impact.
—length, measured in cen
timeters. A longer ski for stabil
ity at higher speeds, less length

for ease in turning.
—stiffness, desirable for
quick pivot turns and a gener
ally sensitive ski.
Drake said all the skis they
carry are "good skis," but they
just do different things.
The skier's weight limits the
lengths of skis available to
him from any one type of ski,
based on manufacturer's
specifications. But one length
of ski, 180 centimeters for
example, will range through
many types of skis. The prices
range from $170 to $280.
Because of all the variables,
Rosen thinks the process of
choosing skis is "irrational."
Buyers must make some
choices not governed by
specific guidelines, Rosen said.
In some cases, this may come
to the cosmetics or appearance
of one ski over another. But
Drake said that "most people
who have skied come to the
shop with some preferences."
What about Olin, K-2, Ros
signol, Molnar, Hexcel
and other big names?
Salespeople say the name
brands are good. Medina said
the difference between some
name brands and "no names"
is that name brands often offer
a better guarantee.
There are, however, spe

cialty brands such as Pre which
have "no name" with the gen
eral public because they are
quality skis for the more ad
vanced and experienced skier.
Medina added that ski
equipment and skiing have a
built-in pitfall: because one's
equipment reflects one's abil
ity, people tend to buy beyond
their ability as a means to
status.
Poles
Ski poles are for planting as
you turn and most of them
range from $15 to $45. Any
pole under $15 will bend easily
according to Medina, while
poles from $15 to $25 are de
cent.
From $25 to $40 the poles are
probably of identical quality,
light weight and durable, but
in the upper end of the price
range the buyer begins to pay
for frills. In fact there are even
poles with stopwatches for $70
said Medina.
Bindings
Bindings are of two types:
standard and plate. Standard
bindings have a toe piece and a
heel piece and release the boot
in an upwards direction. Plate
bindings are newer and Rosen
said he considers them safer
because they release the boot
in more directions.
Ski bindings also come with

a safety or running strap which
leaves the ski attached to your
ankle if the boot comes out.
Although Salomon bindings
are the best advertised they are
neither the only good bindings
nor the best price, Drake said.
Binding prices in general range
from $50 to $115.
If a buyer wants to save
money, ski sales are usually
held in the spring said Rosen,
with savings up to 20 to 30 per
cent if the model is being dis
continued.
Popular skis are likely to be
stored until fall, although in
fall there is a discount on the
previous years equipment.
Rosen suggested reading some
trade publications for more
product information. He said
three fall issues of Ski
Magazine — September, Oc
tober and November — have
especially helpful details on
skis.
Buying ski equipment is a
two-sided process. Rosen said
he feels "it's unfair to expect
the salesperson to give you the
right kind of skis." But Medina
and Drake both felt it impor
tant that a customer use a
service-oriented shop when
the sales people will also at
tempt to determine a skiers in
terest and ability. In the end
the decision must be the
buyer's. -Gayle Ashton
