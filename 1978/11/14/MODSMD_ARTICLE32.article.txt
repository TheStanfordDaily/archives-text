## Fashions: Designers offer warmth and keep you lookin' good 
### 
It's the chance of a lifetime! Someone's
just asked you to go snow skiing for
the first time. While you may be wor
ried about the possibilities of a broken
limb (which you have been assured
can "never happen in a million years"),
your most pressing concern probably is:
"What do you wear?"
Since humans are not possessed with
the ability to withstand extreme cold,
and since you know that each time you
fall (and you plan to be on the ground a
lot) your body will feel as if it's im
mersed in a frozen daiquiri, your ulti
mate goal will be to stay warm. Don't
forget, however, that despite needing
to keep warm, there's no hat m in "look
ing good," either.
In order to achieve your first aim, one
of the most important areas to consider

is your hands. As Laurie Drake of
Short Swing, Inc. in Palo Alto said,
"When your hands are cold, you're
miserable. This might cause you to hate
skiing." So, an investment in a pair of
gloves can be very worthwhile.
A pair of insulated gloves costs bet
ween $10 and $35, according to Drake.
She recommended mittens for people
who have difficulty staying warm. Al
though mittens may be clumsier than
gloves, they keep the fingers together,
allowing better heat retention.
Other extremities to be considered
are the feet. Even when encased in
ski boots they can still feel the effects of
the icy snow. You could always wear
three or four pairs of socks, but why get
so many pairs wet when all that's really
needed is one pair?
According to Drake, thermal insu
lated socks are much more practical.
She said that since ski boots are
custom-fitted, the additional pairs of
socks may cause a poor fit. "More boot
manufacturers recommended one
medium-weight thermal sock. They

don't have ridges like most other socks,
so they don't bother your legs."
The brains of any operation should
certainly be protected against the cold,
too. To do this you might want a wool
hat which can be pulled over your ears
to combat the freezing air. These hats
range in price from $8 to $16 at
Short Swing.
A last essential for any skier, begin
ner or expert, according to Drake, is a
pair of sunglasses or goggles. For any
one who has never been on the slopes,
the reflection from the snow can be so
extreme that it can cause a temporary
condition known as "snow blindness."
Drake said that this glare may even
be damaging to one's eyes. "I think
my vision went from 20/20 to 20/40 sim-

ply because I was so vain in high school
that 1 wouldn't wear glasses on the
slopes." She said that a pair of glasses
or goggles can run from $8 to $30, de
pending upon the special features.
While any pair of sunglasses will suf
fice, special anti-fog lenses are available
for the avid skier.
So, now that the "essentials" are
taken care of, you have to decide what
sort of outer covering you'll wear over
the rest of your body.
The skier who has never been on the
slopes probably will not want to invest
much money into the sport at first.
Jeans and some sort of parka will prob
ably be sufficient outerwear.
However, a pair of thermal under
wear would probably be a very good
investment, since a pair of jeans doesn't
offer much protection against the cold.
At Short Swing, a set (top and bottom)
of "long johns" costs between $20 and
$25. The more wool in the underwear,
according to Drake, the warmer they
will be.

Now comes the fashion angle. As far
as the outer garmets are concerned,
the slopes of any resort will offer a wide
variety of outfits, colors and styles.
While some skiiers can be seen in jeans
and parkas, the true aficionados appear
very "stylish" in coordinated suits.
Drake said ski suits can run any
where from $100 to $450. "The differ
ence in the price depends upon the
workmanship, the materials used and
the detailing," she said.
These suits are either one or two
piece and can be made from down,
fiberfill or polyester. Down is the most
expensive, while the fiber-fill and
hollow-fill cost the least.
Down seems to be the most popular,
but it has a disadvantage, said Drake.
"When it gets wet, it doesn't retain heat
as well as the hollow-fill," she said.
Another way for the ski enthusiast to
dress is in separates: stretch or in
sulated pants and parka.
A parka is a must for both novice and
experienced skier, unless one wishes to
stay warm by wearing three or four
sweaters which soak up the water each
time you hit snow. A parka can cost
anywhere from $40 to $250. Again, ac
cording to Drake, the difference in price
is in the construction and materials
used.
The type of pants you wear also af
fects heat retention. While jeans may
suffice for a while, after a time on the
slopes, according to Drake, they may
get wet and freeze up around the boot,

causing some discomfort.
Ski pants are of two types: stretch
and insulated. Insulated pants cost $30
to $70, while the stretch pants run $50
to $180. The insulated pants are
warmer, but the stretch pants are more
"fashionable," Drake said.
Stretch pants, then, are just one
example of where fashion may take
precedence over cost and perhaps a
minor loss in warmth. Ski fashions, ac
cording to Drake, are off-shoots of reg
ular sportswear. "Bright colors have
and always will be popular. This year,
though the color scheme of fasions is
following that of regular fashions and
includes many tone-downed, earthy
shades."
Accessories can also be added to
spice up winter attire. A good invest
ment which can carry various fluids to
help combat the cold from the inside
out is a bota bag. This can cost from $10
to $12, but many skiiers feel that it is
money well-spent.
A new idea for those who want to ski
to music is a light cassette case with
earphones. It can be carried under the
jacket and costs about $150.
So, now you're set! You've got the
latest in parkas; your long johns are
carefully packed away in your
backpack; your bota bag is filled with
"Wild Turkey," and your "cool and
groovy" shades are sticking out of your
pocket. You're ready and prepared to
meet the slopes — hopefully head on
and not face down. Yvonne Handle

Men s fashions are as big a business as women's. This model shows a particularly "in"
new accessory for the skier: the portable ski cassette. The cassette player, strapped to
your front, has small earphones to let you "get into the tunes" while you swoop down
the slopes—assuming, of course, that you pay the $150 for the cassette.

traditionally popular with skiers, have introduced many more "earthy" colors in

ner or expert, according to Drake, is a
pair of sunglasses or goggles. For any
one who has never been on the slopes,
the reflection from the snow can be so
extreme that it can cause a temporary
condition known as "snow blindness."
Drake said that this glare may even
be damaging to one's eyes. "I think
my vision went from 20/20 to 20/40 sim-

ply because I was so vain in high school
that 1 wouldn't wear glasses on the
slopes." She said that a pair of glasses
or goggles can run from $8 to $30, de
pending upon the special features.
While any pair of sunglasses will suf
fice, special anti-fog lenses are available
for the avid skier.
So, now that the "essentials" are
taken care of, you have to decide what
sort of outer covering you'll wear over
the rest of your body.
The skier who has never been on the
slopes probably will not want to invest
much money into the sport at first.
Jeans and some sort of parka will prob
ably be sufficient outerwear.
However, a pair of thermal under
wear would probably be a very good
investment, since a pair of jeans doesn't
offer much protection against the cold.
At Short Swing, a set (top and bottom)
of "long johns" costs between $20 and
$25. The more wool in the underwear,
according to Drake, the warmer they
will be.

Now comes the fashion angle. As far
as the outer garmets are concerned,
the slopes of any resort will offer a wide
variety of outfits, colors and styles.
While some skiiers can be seen in jeans
and parkas, the true aficionados appear
very "stylish" in coordinated suits.
Drake said ski suits can run any
where from $100 to $450. "The differ
ence in the price depends upon the
workmanship, the materials used and
the detailing," she said.
These suits are either one or two
piece and can be made from down,
fiberfill or polyester. Down is the most
expensive, while the fiber-fill and
hollow-fill cost the least.
Down seems to be the most popular,
but it has a disadvantage, said Drake.
"When it gets wet, it doesn't retain heat
as well as the hollow-fill," she said.
Another way for the ski enthusiast to
dress is in separates: stretch or in
sulated pants and parka.
A parka is a must for both novice and
experienced skier, unless one wishes to
stay warm by wearing three or four
sweaters which soak up the water each
time you hit snow. A parka can cost
anywhere from $40 to $250. Again, ac
cording to Drake, the difference in price
is in the construction and materials
used.
The type of pants you wear also af
fects heat retention. While jeans may
suffice for a while, after a time on the
slopes, according to Drake, they may
get wet and freeze up around the boot,

causing some discomfort.
Ski pants are of two types: stretch
and insulated. Insulated pants cost $30
to $70, while the stretch pants run $50
to $180. The insulated pants are
warmer, but the stretch pants are more
"fashionable," Drake said.
Stretch pants, then, are just one
example of where fashion may take
precedence over cost and perhaps a
minor loss in warmth. Ski fashions, ac
cording to Drake, are off-shoots of reg
ular sportswear. "Bright colors have
and always will be popular. This year,
though the color scheme of fasions is
following that of regular fashions and
includes many tone-downed, earthy
shades."
Accessories can also be added to
spice up winter attire. A good invest
ment which can carry various fluids to
help combat the cold from the inside
out is a bota bag. This can cost from $10
to $12, but many skiiers feel that it is
money well-spent.
A new idea for those who want to ski
to music is a light cassette case with
earphones. It can be carried under the
jacket and costs about $150.
So, now you're set! You've got the
latest in parkas; your long johns are
carefully packed away in your
backpack; your bota bag is filled with
"Wild Turkey," and your "cool and
groovy" shades are sticking out of your
pocket. You're ready and prepared to
meet the slopes — hopefully head on
and not face down. Yvonne Handle

Men s fashions are as big a business as women's. This model shows a particularly "in"
new accessory for the skier: the portable ski cassette. The cassette player, strapped to
your front, has small earphones to let you "get into the tunes" while you swoop down
the slopes—assuming, of course, that you pay the $150 for the cassette.

A model poses with new ski fashions at a ski fashion show held last month at the Cow
Palace as part of Ski Show '78. Designers, while still showing the bright colors
traditionally popular with skiers, have introduced many more "earthy" colors in
fashions for this season.
It's the chance of a lifetime! Someone's
just asked you to go snow skiing for
the first time. While you may be wor
ried about the possibilities of a broken
limb (which you have been assured
can "never happen in a million years"),
your most pressing concern probably is:
"What do you wear?"
Since humans are not possessed with
the ability to withstand extreme cold,
and since you know that each time you
fall (and you plan to be on the ground a
lot) your body will feel as if it's im
mersed in a frozen daiquiri, your ulti
mate goal will be to stay warm. Don't
forget, however, that despite needing
to keep warm, there's no hat m in "look
ing good," either.
In order to achieve your first aim, one
of the most important areas to consider

is your hands. As Laurie Drake of
Short Swing, Inc. in Palo Alto said,
"When your hands are cold, you're
miserable. This might cause you to hate
skiing." So, an investment in a pair of
gloves can be very worthwhile.
A pair of insulated gloves costs bet
ween $10 and $35, according to Drake.
She recommended mittens for people
who have difficulty staying warm. Al
though mittens may be clumsier than
gloves, they keep the fingers together,
allowing better heat retention.
Other extremities to be considered
are the feet. Even when encased in
ski boots they can still feel the effects of
the icy snow. You could always wear
three or four pairs of socks, but why get
so many pairs wet when all that's really
needed is one pair?
According to Drake, thermal insu
lated socks are much more practical.
She said that since ski boots are
custom-fitted, the additional pairs of
socks may cause a poor fit. "More boot
manufacturers recommended one
medium-weight thermal sock. They

don't have ridges like most other socks,
so they don't bother your legs."
The brains of any operation should
certainly be protected against the cold,
too. To do this you might want a wool
hat which can be pulled over your ears
to combat the freezing air. These hats
range in price from $8 to $16 at
Short Swing.

Another way for the ski enthusiast to
dress is in separates: stretch or in
sulated pants and parka.
A parka is a must for both novice and
experienced skier, unless one wishes to
stay warm by wearing three or four
sweaters which soak up the water each
time you hit snow. A parka can cost
anywhere from $40 to $250. Again, ac
cording to Drake, the difference in price
is in the construction and materials
used.
The type of pants you wear also af
fects heat retention. While jeans may
suffice for a while, after a time on the
slopes, according to Drake, they may
get wet and freeze up around the boot,

causing some discomfort.
Ski pants are of two types: stretch
and insulated. Insulated pants cost $30
to $70, while the stretch pants run $50
to $180. The insulated pants are
warmer, but the stretch pants are more
"fashionable," Drake said.
Stretch pants, then, are just one
example of where fashion may take
precedence over cost and perhaps a
minor loss in warmth. Ski fashions, ac
cording to Drake, are off-shoots of reg
ular sportswear. "Bright colors have
and always will be popular. This year,
though the color scheme of fasions is
following that of regular fashions and
includes many tone-downed, earthy
shades."
Accessories can also be added to
spice up winter attire. A good invest
ment which can carry various fluids to
help combat the cold from the inside
out is a bota bag. This can cost from $10
to $12, but many skiiers feel that it is
money well-spent.
A new idea for those who want to ski
to music is a light cassette case with
earphones. It can be carried under the
jacket and costs about $150.
So, now you're set! You've got the
latest in parkas; your long johns are
carefully packed away in your
backpack; your bota bag is filled with
"Wild Turkey," and your "cool and
groovy" shades are sticking out of your
pocket. You're ready and prepared to
meet the slopes — hopefully head on
and not face down. Yvonne Handle

Men s fashions are as big a business as women's. This model shows a particularly "in"
new accessory for the skier: the portable ski cassette. The cassette player, strapped to
your front, has small earphones to let you "get into the tunes" while you swoop down
the slopes—assuming, of course, that you pay the $150 for the cassette.

A model poses with new ski fashions at a ski fashion show held last month at the Cow
Palace as part of Ski Show '78. Designers, while still showing the bright colors
traditionally popular with skiers, have introduced many more "earthy" colors in
fashions for this season.
It's the chance of a lifetime! Someone's
just asked you to go snow skiing for
the first time. While you may be wor
ried about the possibilities of a broken
limb (which you have been assured
can "never happen in a million years"),
your most pressing concern probably is:
"What do you wear?"
Since humans are not possessed with
the ability to withstand extreme cold,
and since you know that each time you
fall (and you plan to be on the ground a
lot) your body will feel as if it's im
mersed in a frozen daiquiri, your ulti
mate goal will be to stay warm. Don't
forget, however, that despite needing
to keep warm, there's no hat m in "look
ing good," either.
In order to achieve your first aim, one
of the most important areas to consider

is your hands. As Laurie Drake of
Short Swing, Inc. in Palo Alto said,
"When your hands are cold, you're
miserable. This might cause you to hate
skiing." So, an investment in a pair of
gloves can be very worthwhile.
A pair of insulated gloves costs bet
ween $10 and $35, according to Drake.
She recommended mittens for people
who have difficulty staying warm. Al
though mittens may be clumsier than
gloves, they keep the fingers together,
allowing better heat retention.
Other extremities to be considered
are the feet. Even when encased in
ski boots they can still feel the effects of
the icy snow. You could always wear
three or four pairs of socks, but why get
so many pairs wet when all that's really
needed is one pair?
According to Drake, thermal insu
lated socks are much more practical.
She said that since ski boots are
custom-fitted, the additional pairs of
socks may cause a poor fit. "More boot
manufacturers recommended one
medium-weight thermal sock. They

don't have ridges like most other socks,
so they don't bother your legs."
The brains of any operation should
certainly be protected against the cold,
too. To do this you might want a wool
hat which can be pulled over your ears
to combat the freezing air. These hats
range in price from $8 to $16 at
Short Swing.
A last essential for any skier, begin
ner or expert, according to Drake, is a
pair of sunglasses or goggles. For any
one who has never been on the slopes,
the reflection from the snow can be so
extreme that it can cause a temporary
condition known as "snow blindness."
Drake said that this glare may even
be damaging to one's eyes. "I think
my vision went from 20/20 to 20/40 sim-

ply because I was so vain in high school
that 1 wouldn't wear glasses on the
slopes." She said that a pair of glasses
or goggles can run from $8 to $30, de
pending upon the special features.
While any pair of sunglasses will suf
fice, special anti-fog lenses are available
for the avid skier.
So, now that the "essentials" are
taken care of, you have to decide what
sort of outer covering you'll wear over
the rest of your body.
The skier who has never been on the
slopes probably will not want to invest
much money into the sport at first.
Jeans and some sort of parka will prob
ably be sufficient outerwear.
However, a pair of thermal under
wear would probably be a very good
investment, since a pair of jeans doesn't
offer much protection against the cold.
At Short Swing, a set (top and bottom)
of "long johns" costs between $20 and
$25. The more wool in the underwear,
according to Drake, the warmer they
will be.

Now comes the fashion angle. As far
as the outer garmets are concerned,
the slopes of any resort will offer a wide
variety of outfits, colors and styles.
While some skiiers can be seen in jeans
and parkas, the true aficionados appear
very "stylish" in coordinated suits.
Drake said ski suits can run any
where from $100 to $450. "The differ
ence in the price depends upon the
workmanship, the materials used and
the detailing," she said.
These suits are either one or two
piece and can be made from down,
fiberfill or polyester. Down is the most
expensive, while the fiber-fill and
hollow-fill cost the least.
Down seems to be the most popular,
but it has a disadvantage, said Drake.
"When it gets wet, it doesn't retain heat
as well as the hollow-fill," she said.

Men s fashions are as big a business as women's. This model shows a particularly "in"
new accessory for the skier: the portable ski cassette. The cassette player, strapped to
your front, has small earphones to let you "get into the tunes" while you swoop down
the slopes—assuming, of course, that you pay the $150 for the cassette.

A model poses with new ski fashions at a ski fashion show held last month at the Cow
Palace as part of Ski Show '78. Designers, while still showing the bright colors
traditionally popular with skiers, have introduced many more "earthy" colors in
fashions for this season.
