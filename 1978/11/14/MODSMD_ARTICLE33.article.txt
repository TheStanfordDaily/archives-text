# Ski club plans a good time on and off slopes
## 
### 
With a full agenda and a
great deal of enthusiasm,
the Ski Club has reorganized at
Stanford. Its first big event will
be a Thanksgiving ski trip to
Utah.
The club's 80. members will
join a throng of more than 1000
college students making the
annual pilgrimage to Snow
bird, Alta and Park City slopes,
according to Ski Club President
Warren Anderson.
For $137.50 each, particip
ants receive bus transporta
tion, two dances with live
bands, a wine and cheese party
and three nights at the Salt
Lake City Hilton.
Oh yes — and four days of
skiing.
"The trip is an overwhelm
ing success" so far, Anderson
said. Club officers were forced
to hire another bus because
they had double the expected
turnout.
This is just the first of several
trips planned for this year,
Anderson said. "We'll try and
run three trips every year from
now on: one at spring vacation,
one at Christmas and another
at Thanksgiving," he said.
The trips are arranged
through Sports-America, a
private firm, which organizes
trips for University of Califor
nia students. Because of Stan
ford's vacation conflict with
UC schools, Anderson said
there is no major trip planned
for Christmas, although a
Tahoe trip is likely. Aspen is
slated for a trip over spring
break.
"Mostly the club will be
doing a lot of weekends in
Tahoe," he said. "We'll have a
bulletin board with names of
people going up and we'll rent

a couple of cabins."
The club, dormant for two
years due to the drought, is
"going strong" according to
Anderson, who reorganized it
this fall with two friends (Alan
Coar, vice president, and Mark
Sutherland, treasurer).
Their booth on registration
day was immediately beset
by interested skiers, which
didn't surprise Anderson.
"There are more than 80 skiers
at Stanford," he said. "1 think
there will be about 120 in the
club by the year's end."
The club's goal? "To get a lot
of people who are interested in
skiing together and give them a
chance to ski as much as possi
ble," he said.
All that is required of mem
bers is to "have interest, like to
ski and pay $10," Anderson
said. The dues, coupled with
$230 remaining from the old
club, finance club events —
which thus far has meant
"meetings every two weeks
with (ski) movies, wine and
cheese," he said.
Guest speakers are occasion
ally invited to club functions.
Recently Stanford ski clubbers
listened to Lyman Black, who
gives conditioning advice to
the ski team, discuss how to
prepare for the Utah trip.
//TA7VII also be having
V V people from the ski
shops around here come and
give ski-tuning clinics," An
derson said, adding that most
nearby stores give club mem
bers a 20 percent discount on
purchases.
The club attracts a wide
range of people, Anderson
said. "There are a lot of
graduate students; there are a

lot of freshmen. You don't
even have to be a Stanford stu
dent," he said. "We have a
couple of employees from the
Medical Center and one UCLA
student joined the club just for
this trip."
Many members are from
Colorado and Utah and most
have skied for at least one year,
said Anderson, who has skied
for nine.
The club has little to offer
non-skiers, he said, "although
during the drought people
were so enthusiastic about the

Utah trip that they wanted to
go anyway" just to party.
/ /T T owever. beginning
X J.skiers we love — we
want," Anderson said. "There
will be a lot of chances for them
to ski.
"On the big trips that we do,
the first day is devoted to be
ginners if they so choose," he
said. "One of the mountains is
set aside for beginners and it is
just filthy with instructors who
teach all day long.
"We're just there to have fun

and ski for our enjoyment,"
Anderson said. "We're not re
ally competitive at all. We leave
that to the ski team."
If the trips and club meetings
prove successful, Anderson
said the officers would be wil
ling to extend meetings past
the "snow season" for purely
social reasons.
"It depends on how well
people get along with each
other," he said. "After this trip
we should find out whether its
a cohesive group that will stick
together." -Cheryl Zollars

The first big activity for the newly reorganized ski club is a Thanksgiving trip to the slopes
around the Salt Lake. According to the Utah Travel Council, the resorts in the Beehive State offer
"tranquility and solitude" at an affordable price.
