# Conditioning needed before snow flies
## 
### 
If you start unprepared, you
will find the going heavy, but if
your body is already a little con
ditioned for skiing the fun that you
derive from it is vastly greater. To
this you must add a most impor
tant factor: if your body is well
trained, the risk of injury is re
duced to a minimum.

The Skier's Pocketbook
Wiedermann, once a
member of the Austrian
National Ski Team, hits upon
the philosophy of the Ski Con
ditioning class offered every
fall and winter here. Training
for the ski season starts long
before the first snow fall and
continues well into spring ski
ing.
Members of Stanford's Ski
Team, recreational skiers and
non-skiers participate in the
course. Coursework is as
strenuous and challenging as
the individual makes it.
Meeting officially four days
each week, a variety of work

outs are offered.
Monday and Wednesday
workouts follow a pattern of:
3/4 mile warm-up run, stretch
ing exercises, calesthenics, a
game of grid ball and 4 to 5 sets
of stadium stairs.
Tuesday and Thursdays, the
class runs to the Dish or
bike rides to Skyline Drive.
As ski season approaches,
class also meets on Fridays to
run a dry-land slalom course.
Poles are set up at regular in
tervals on a hill and the class
runs through imitating a skiing
race using their ski poles for
added balance and timing.
Several of the calesthenics
are specifically for building
muscle control in skiing — like
the downhill tuck. Weight
training is also encouraged to
build upper body strength. The
dry-land slalom workouts,
stadium stairs and the soccer
and grid ball games increase
agility.
Lyman Black, a graduate

student in mechanical en
gineering, runs the condition
ing class under the guidance of
conditioning coach Wesley
Ruff. Black took over the class
last year.
Black participated in a train
ing session here last sum
mer and meets weekly with
Ruff to prepare for the class.
"The class follows a progress
development; the first step is to
increase flexibility and agility
and to build up cardiopulmo
nary stamina. The second step
is to improve skill and muscu

lar strength, and the third step
is to maintain that level of
physical condition," Black
said.
The 35 class members are en
thusiastic about their training.
Hal Harvey, a skier since age
two, said, "The class is great
for getting in shape; agility
needs to be worked on with the
dryland slalom and low tight
rope walking."
Cross country racer Carrie
Price is in the class for the sec
ond year to get ready for the
season. "The class is really
helping, but I'd like to be doing

more wind sprints," she said.
You don't have to be a racer
or even an avid skier to enjoy
ski conditioning. When exercis
ing is scheduled in the day, it is
easier to find time to work out.
Team games also provide fun
and relaxation, Black said.
"Conditioning's important
personal benefits are more
pleasurable and safer skiing —
for you and others on the
slopes," he stressed.
Besides, as class member
Jackie Tan said, "It gets you in
shape for everything."

Stretching exercises are among the standard routine in a ski
conditioning class offered here tall and winter quarters. Being in
shape before you hit the slopes will improve your enjoyment
and help make you a safer skier.

Games of grid ball help increase agility and are therefore included in the conditioning program
for skiers here. Members of the ski team and other interested students enroll in the ski condition
ing classes offered four days a week.
