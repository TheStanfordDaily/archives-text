Helicopter skiing is a new fad for the advanced skier with guts. The skier is lifted to remote
areas generally inaccessible otherwise and can enjoy being the first person to touch vast bowls
of untracked powder. Above, the Wasatch Powerbird Guides, who operate out of Snowbird
Ski Resort near Salt Lake City, pull up and fly away after dropping a load of adventurous
downhillers. Such tours are also available in Utah from the Utah Powder Guides at Park City
at a cost of $55 to $125 for a four-to-five run tour. The Utah Travel Council advises people to
make reservations for the tours at least 48 hours in advance as demand is high. Closer to
home, the Sierra Guide Service will fly skiers to elevations of 13,000 feet in the Toyabe
National Forest. The cost is $165 for an eight-hour day tour. The service is located 74 miles
south of the South end of Lake Tahoe and skiers can call (714) 932-7778 for information.
