# Students' costs seen rising 9%

### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
Costs of attending the University
next year will probably rise the full 9
percent allowed under wage and
price guidelines set by President
Jimmy Carter, the Board of Trustees
was told yesterday.
A 9 percent boost in costs would
mean tuition and room and board
rates would rise more than $650 next
fall, to about $7950. The total cost
this year is $7300.
The University may raise fees 9
percent under a formula which re
lies primarily on its price increases
over the past two years, according to
Vice Provost for Budget and Plan
ning Raymond Bacchetti. He said
nationwide, the goal is to keep aver
age price increases to 5.75 percent.
Bacchetti presented the University
Long-Range Forecast at a joint meet
ing of the Finance and Development

and Academic Affairs committees.
The forecast outlines the Universi
ty's probable financial complexion
for the next five years, based upon
assumed growth, gift levels, price
and wage increases and other vari
ables.
"Our current understanding (of
the guidelines) is that wages could
go up 7 percent and total price could
increase 9 percent," Bacchetti said.
Tuition may rise less than 9 per
cent, while housing and board costs
may rise by slightly larger percen
tages, depending upon projected
income requirements of the two
total cost components.
Bacchetti said the percentage
housing cost increase could be
higher than the percentage tuition
increase if the housing system had
to resort to debt financing for new
housing facilities, which now are
being proposed informally.
The actual figures traditionally are
presented to the board for approval
in December.
Guides discussed
Bacchetti said the Carter
guidelines were discussed at the
meeting, and said the University is
still trying to determine all possible
ramifications.
"The president said the guidelines
are simple," Bacchetti said. "The
guidelines are not simple. They are
very complex. The drafts we have
are 50 pages."
The full board will meet today,
with improvement of the heating,
ventilation and air conditioning sys
tem (HVAC) at the Meyer Library
tops the action agenda.
The HVAC project will "correct
the deficiencies of stale and over
heated air" at Meyer with a new
air-distribution system.
