California: the land of sun
and surf. Stanford: a cam
pus covered with eucalyptus.
A ski team at a place like this?
A recreational ski club maybe,
but a ski team? Well, there is a
ski team here, and it's a good
one.
It not only placed among the
top three teams in every meet
they attended last season but
also ranked third in the Pacific
Coast Conference. It sent three
men to the NCAA nationals,
and sent the entire women's
team to the AIAW's.
"It's the real thing," said
men's co-captain Howie Ro
sen, and although the program
remains under club sport
status, there are varsity letters
available to the top racers on
the team.
Anyone may join the team —
there are no cuts — but only
the five fastest racers in each
event can compete.
Rosen describes the team as
"competitive, yet infor
mal." This provides for a un
ique system among Stanford's
athletic teams, Rosen said, in
that the established racers can
enjoy tough competition while
the less experienced club
members can work out and re
ceive coaching no matter what
their ability level.
There are objective criteria
for advancement. Rosen said
that "often the sixth and
seventh racers in each event

are allowed to run the course
competitively through as an
exhibition. If one of their times
is better than the fifth man's
then that person can advance."
The alpine events for both
men and women are slalom
and giant-slalom. The nordic
events for men are 15 kilomet
ers and jumping. The women
compete on a five kilometer
course.
The history of the ski team
dates back to 1938. There
hasn't been a team every year,
but participation has been
fairly consistent and over the
years the team has developed
from a squad which used to
look for recreational skiers just
to collect their dues, to the
more sophisticated program of
race training and competition
which exists today.
This year's membership of 52
is very large compared with
previous year's teams which
usually numbered 30 mem
bers, Rosen said.
Practicing and effective train
ing are difficult here, Rosen
said. The team does what it can
to train on campus and it has
developed a one unit "ski
conditioning" course held dur
ing fall and winter quarters.
This involves building leg
muscles and endurance by
playing soccer, grid ball, or by
running bicycling and running
stadium steps.
The team also leases a cabin
in the Lake Tahoe area for five
months during the winter, but
transportation up and back re
stricts the team to only four
practice weekends a year.
There is also a six-day training
camp right after Christmas.
The big ski powers nationally
get to ski every day all
winter long, though, and this
puts Stanford at a strong dis
advantage in national competi
tion. However, Stanford is a
member of the Pacific Coast
Conference, and the majority
of the teams are in the same
situation. This evens out the
competition quite a bit, Rosen
said.
Stanford is fortunate being
in the conference in that it can
compete evenly with most of
the teams, Rosen said.
This year's team looks
young, but strong according to
Rosen. Returning are lettermen
Bill Volk, NCAA qualifier in
1977, Wally Krengle and co
captain Dave Parker. Women
co-captains are Andrea Dewey
and Jan Flarety.
