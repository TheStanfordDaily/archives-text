# Couples cope with career pressures
## 
### DEBORAH FRANKLIN 
Problems married women face
when pursuing professional careers
stretch beyond the competition and
discrimination of a male-dominated
job market, according to a Univer
sity psychiatrist.
"There are a lot of pressures on
young couples as women move out
of the house," Dr. Harvey Weinstein
told a conference on "dual career
families" held here Saturday. "And
there just aren't enough role mod
els."
Weinstein, coordinator of the
conference, brought together 12 Bay
Area couples who discussed their
successes and problems in balanc
ing careers and marriage.
Most working couples, while
planning an egalitarian domestic
life, slip into traditional patterns
after a few months of marriage, said
Colleen Johnson, a UC-San Fran
cisco anthropology professor.
Johnson has done research on
"Role Strain in Marriage" with her
husband, Frank, a UCSF psychiatry
professor. She said the average
career woman is caught in the bind
of managing a full-time career and
performing at least 19 hours a week
of domestic work.
To equalize the workload effi
ciently, many couples at the confer
ence said they rotate duties, such as
housekeeping, chauffeuring and
cooking. One partner's temporary
though complete control over the
checkbook or meals helps to elimi
nate the "You do it, but I'll tell you
how," arguments, Frank Johnson
said.
Careers begun at the same time
and moving in the same directions
can double the pressure on couples,
as crises arise, according to Bernard
Cohen, a sociology professor here.
He recalled three tense years
when his wife Elizabeth, a professor
here in the School of Education,
awaited tenure.
"If we had both come up for te
nure at the same time, we would
probably not be married today,"
Cohen said. He added that differen
tiating careers and not attempting

time-consuming projects at the
same time also reduced the pressure
on their 25-year marriage.
Elizabeth Cohen said it was very
important for her to finish her Ph.D.
dissertation before having her first
child.
"I found having babies far harder
than getting a Ph.D. or the work I'm
doing now, and that includes run
ning three research projects to
gether," she said, adding that many
successful career women mistakenly
assume that they can "take off the
professional hat and put on a
mommy hat," instinctively under
standing how to be a good mother.
Having their first child while she
was in the midst of medical school
internship was trying for Drs. Bar
bara and Richard Almond, both
psychiatrists.
"The guilt about going back to
work with small children was some
thing that was very hard for me to
deal with," she added.
Phillip Cowan, a UC-Berkeley
psychology professor, said work he
and his wife Carolyn are completing
on young families indicates that guilt
felt by young mothers, who pursue
careers, may be based upon results
of wrong types of research.
"We think that the research has
been done with blinders on, they
don't ask the right types of ques
tions," he said, referring to
psychological studies reporting
damage to children from early mat
ernal deprivation. New work shows
that early fathering may be as impor
tant as early mothering, Phillip
Cowan said.
All couples agreed that flexibility
was a key in juggling their multiple
careers, spouse and parent roles;
that no single blueprint can or needs
to be followed in molding a success
ful life together.
"We're not arguing that every
couple has to adopt strictly egalita
rian roles," Phillip Cowan said. "If
they can maintain self esteem and
talk and negotiate temporary roles,
it can work. You can't plan 20 years
ahead or 10 years ahead, but you can
plan for next week."
