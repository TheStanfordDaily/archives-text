# The 						D.C. internship: a frustrations-thrills combo

(Editor's note: This is the first of two articles explor
ing internship experiences in Washington, D.C. This
article covers Capitol Hill experiences. The next story
will examine other internship experiences in the
Washington area.)
For many students here, the prospect of a
Washington, D.C. internship is a culmination. It is
seen as the synthesis of an ideological education and
as a practical working experience in viewing the com
plexities of the American government. It promises to
be a lesson in the way things work.
Yet for some University students, these promises
dissolve quickly into myths. Internships in
Washington sometimes don't work. Students find
themselves frustrated with ineffectual tasks like open
ing mail and xeroxing papers. Often they become
frustrated with the maze of bureaucracy that charac
terizes federal government.
The blame for these frustrations, students concede,
is on both the student's naivite and with problems
inherent in the political system itself.
junior Emily Sachar arrived in Washington last
summer to work for Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.).
For Sachar, disillusionment set in during her first
morning on the job. *
"I arrived promptly at Eagleton's office and then sat
in the mail room with the other interns for two hours
waiting for someone to welcome us. Finally someone,
one of the legislative aides, I think, took us aside and
made it clear that there was nothing expected of us.'
That first morning proved to be representative. When,
after a week of inactivity, Sachar began asking ques
tions, she was told "to get in good with someone with
power in the office." Yet hooking up with a legislative
aide, a staff member responsible for investigating
legislation, proved no better. Sachar said, "I did find a
few things to do, but I got no feedback on them. I
don't believe my work was even read."
Sachar attributes her dissatisfaction with the intern
ship to her own naivite and to the system of political
patronage. She readily admits that she received the
internship as a political favor. "Eagleton was paying
back my mother for work she had done in numerous
elections." Sachar said Eagleton's office operates on
the notion that the function of the internship is almost
exclusively one of political patronage, not service to
the staff. The interns became, in Sachar's opinion,
sheer nuisances.
"Interns were seen as a pain in the nec k. They can't
serve any function except to open the mail. There's no
way that in six weeks the staff c an indoctrinate you to
work for the senator."
Sachar was subtly prepped for the kind of intern

ship she found in the acceptance letter she received
from Sen. Eagleton. Sachar's letter read, "You will be
doing some work in the mail room, among other
routine tasks and you will be working with a legislative
assistant doing several research tasks." Veteran in
terns suggest that it is important to read between the
lines; of letter is almost a certainty that the
intern will be involved only peripherally with substan
tive tasks.
Though Sachar's experience was a common one, it
is not the rule. Senior Duncan Evered accepted an
internship with Rep. Robert Lagamarsino (R-Santa
Barbara). Evered said the office was flexible and he
was given significant responsibilities. "Lagamarsino's
office integrates their interns well. I was incorporated
immediately and in the first week I was writing press
releases." Everfed's other duties included writing let
ters and congressional testimony and overseeing and
taking notes at congressional committee meetings.
Eveied believes his internship worked because he

was well-informed before the internship began. "In
February, after I received the internship, I talked to
one of the administrative aides in Santa Barbara. He
was helpful in identifying the kinds of work I would be
doing and in describing the experience." Evered cites
other determinants of the quality of the internship,
such as size of the office and whether the internship
entails working for a senator or a congressman. Pay
also makes a difference, he said. Congressional and
volunteer internships often offer more flexibility and
responsibility for the student.
Yet, in spite of its functional success, Evered's in
ternship was, in his opinion, far from ideal. The prob
lems Evered had with his position in Washington re
sulted because his political views differed from the
congressman for which he worked. According to
Evered, the intern becomes, in a sense, an extension
of the official for whom he is working. If the intern's
political ideologies don't line up with the con
gressman's or senator's, a great deal of tension may

result between office staff and intern. "I found myself
writing arguments that didn t coincide witli my own
political In the end I felt like I was prostituting
my writing skill."
The mechanics of an intern'** role in a political office
often involve writing â€” the writing of press releases,
legislation and answering constituent mail. Evered re
ports that much of the writing is not top quality. "A lot
of the writing done in the office is rhetoric, empty
phraseology, and is done on things that are not of
much significance."
As a result, Evered became disillusioned with the
experience. "I saw so much time wasted, so much
done for the image of the congressman.'
The intern's working experience is not limited to
the congressional office. Superimposed on the office
structure is the broad structure of the federal gov
ernment. Even if the intern is absolved of the respon
sibility of rhetorical writing, he is still left to grapple
with the federal system. Senior Lisa Eoster worked for
Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) Eoster was respon
sible for all legislative analysis and correspondence
related to issues in health care. Hence, Foster was
able to observe first-hand the details of how a bill
becomes a law. Foster sees her intimacy with the
federal system as a reeducation in American govern
ment. "Before I left for Washington, I had no idea of
the way the federal government really functioned, or
rather I had impressions that were, in fact, very naive,
very simplistic. I understood the system in terms of its
broad structure. This kind of understanding gives you
no idea of how the system really works."
$y working exclusively on health care legislation,
Foster discovered that the federal system works on a
premise of compromise. "Legislators are being influ
enced from every angle by lobbying interest groups or
established moneyed interests or their constituents.
And by the time a bill gets through a committee and
then through the floor of the Senate you end up with
a compromise program. It's not the best bill for what
it is supposed to do; it's not even cost efficient and
everybody in Washington knows it."
Vet, Eoster sees her experience in Washington,
though disillusioning, as extremely valuable. "I came
away extremely disillusioned, very frustrated, but I
learned an enormous amount."
This is a common sentiment echoed by many stu
dents who spend a summer working among the in
tracies, bureaucracies and thrills of the federal gov
ernment. Often things in Washington don't work as
they are envisioned by interns. But most students
agree that the knowledge and insights gained are well
worth the frustrations.

lems Evered had with his position in Washington re
sulted because his political views differed from the
congressman for which he worked. According to
Evered, the intern becomes, in a sense, an extension
of the official for whom he is working. If the intern's
political ideologies don't line up with the con
gressman's or senator's, a great deal of tension may

result between office staff and intern. "I found myself
writing arguments that didn t coincide witli my own
political In the end I felt like I was prostituting
my writing skill."
The mechanics of an intern'** role in a political office
often involve writing â€” the writing of press releases,
legislation and answering constituent mail. Evered re
ports that much of the writing is not top quality. "A lot
of the writing done in the office is rhetoric, empty
phraseology, and is done on things that are not of
much significance."
As a result, Evered became disillusioned with the
experience. "I saw so much time wasted, so much
done for the image of the congressman.'
The intern's working experience is not limited to
the congressional office. Superimposed on the office
structure is the broad structure of the federal gov
ernment. Even if the intern is absolved of the respon
sibility of rhetorical writing, he is still left to grapple
with the federal system. Senior Lisa Eoster worked for
Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) Eoster was respon
sible for all legislative analysis and correspondence
related to issues in health care. Hence, Foster was
able to observe first-hand the details of how a bill
becomes a law. Foster sees her intimacy with the
federal system as a reeducation in American govern
ment. "Before I left for Washington, I had no idea of
the way the federal government really functioned, or
rather I had impressions that were, in fact, very naive,
very simplistic. I understood the system in terms of its
broad structure. This kind of understanding gives you
no idea of how the system really works."
$y working exclusively on health care legislation,
Foster discovered that the federal system works on a
premise of compromise. "Legislators are being influ
enced from every angle by lobbying interest groups or
established moneyed interests or their constituents.
And by the time a bill gets through a committee and
then through the floor of the Senate you end up with
a compromise program. It's not the best bill for what
it is supposed to do; it's not even cost efficient and
everybody in Washington knows it."
Vet, Eoster sees her experience in Washington,
though disillusioning, as extremely valuable. "I came
away extremely disillusioned, very frustrated, but I
learned an enormous amount."
This is a common sentiment echoed by many stu
dents who spend a summer working among the in
tracies, bureaucracies and thrills of the federal gov
ernment. Often things in Washington don't work as
they are envisioned by interns. But most students
agree that the knowledge and insights gained are well
worth the frustrations.

For many students here, the prospect of a
Washington, D.C. internship is a culmination. It is
seen as the synthesis of an ideological education and
as a practical working experience in viewing the com
plexities of the American government. It promises to
be a lesson in the way things work.
Yet for some University students, these promises
dissolve quickly into myths. Internships in
Washington sometimes don't work. Students find
themselves frustrated with ineffectual tasks like open
ing mail and xeroxing papers. Often they become
frustrated with the maze of bureaucracy that charac
terizes federal government.
The blame for these frustrations, students concede,
is on both the student's naivite and with problems
inherent in the political system itself.
junior Emily Sachar arrived in Washington last
summer to work for Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.).
For Sachar, disillusionment set in during her first
morning on the job. *
"I arrived promptly at Eagleton's office and then sat
in the mail room with the other interns for two hours
waiting for someone to welcome us. Finally someone,
one of the legislative aides, I think, took us aside and
made it clear that there was nothing expected of us.'
That first morning proved to be representative. When,
after a week of inactivity, Sachar began asking ques
tions, she was told "to get in good with someone with
power in the office." Yet hooking up with a legislative
aide, a staff member responsible for investigating
legislation, proved no better. Sachar said, "I did find a
few things to do, but I got no feedback on them. I
don't believe my work was even read."
Sachar attributes her dissatisfaction with the intern
ship to her own naivite and to the system of political
patronage. She readily admits that she received the
internship as a political favor. "Eagleton was paying
back my mother for work she had done in numerous
elections." Sachar said Eagleton's office operates on
the notion that the function of the internship is almost
exclusively one of political patronage, not service to
the staff. The interns became, in Sachar's opinion,
sheer nuisances.
"Interns were seen as a pain in the nec k. They can't
serve any function except to open the mail. There's no
way that in six weeks the staff c an indoctrinate you to
work for the senator."
Sachar was subtly prepped for the kind of intern

ship she found in the acceptance letter she received
from Sen. Eagleton. Sachar's letter read, "You will be
doing some work in the mail room, among other
routine tasks and you will be working with a legislative
assistant doing several research tasks." Veteran in
terns suggest that it is important to read between the
lines; of letter is almost a certainty that the
intern will be involved only peripherally with substan
tive tasks.
Though Sachar's experience was a common one, it
is not the rule. Senior Duncan Evered accepted an
internship with Rep. Robert Lagamarsino (R-Santa
Barbara). Evered said the office was flexible and he
was given significant responsibilities. "Lagamarsino's
office integrates their interns well. I was incorporated
immediately and in the first week I was writing press
releases." Everfed's other duties included writing let
ters and congressional testimony and overseeing and
taking notes at congressional committee meetings.
Eveied believes his internship worked because he

was well-informed before the internship began. "In
February, after I received the internship, I talked to
one of the administrative aides in Santa Barbara. He
was helpful in identifying the kinds of work I would be
doing and in describing the experience." Evered cites
other determinants of the quality of the internship,
such as size of the office and whether the internship
entails working for a senator or a congressman. Pay
also makes a difference, he said. Congressional and
volunteer internships often offer more flexibility and
responsibility for the student.

waiting for someone to welcome us. Finally someone,
one of the legislative aides, I think, took us aside and
made it clear that there was nothing expected of us.'
That first morning proved to be representative. When,
after a week of inactivity, Sachar began asking ques
tions, she was told "to get in good with someone with
power in the office." Yet hooking up with a legislative
aide, a staff member responsible for investigating
legislation, proved no better. Sachar said, "I did find a
few things to do, but I got no feedback on them. I
don't believe my work was even read."
Sachar attributes her dissatisfaction with the intern
ship to her own naivite and to the system of political
patronage. She readily admits that she received the
internship as a political favor. "Eagleton was paying
back my mother for work she had done in numerous
elections." Sachar said Eagleton's office operates on
the notion that the function of the internship is almost
exclusively one of political patronage, not service to
the staff. The interns became, in Sachar's opinion,
sheer nuisances.
"Interns were seen as a pain in the nec k. They can't
serve any function except to open the mail. There's no
way that in six weeks the staff c an indoctrinate you to
work for the senator."
Sachar was subtly prepped for the kind of intern

ship she found in the acceptance letter she received
from Sen. Eagleton. Sachar's letter read, "You will be
doing some work in the mail room, among other
routine tasks and you will be working with a legislative
assistant doing several research tasks." Veteran in
terns suggest that it is important to read between the
lines; of letter is almost a certainty that the
intern will be involved only peripherally with substan
tive tasks.
Though Sachar's experience was a common one, it
is not the rule. Senior Duncan Evered accepted an
internship with Rep. Robert Lagamarsino (R-Santa
Barbara). Evered said the office was flexible and he
was given significant responsibilities. "Lagamarsino's
office integrates their interns well. I was incorporated
immediately and in the first week I was writing press
releases." Everfed's other duties included writing let
ters and congressional testimony and overseeing and
taking notes at congressional committee meetings.
Eveied believes his internship worked because he

was well-informed before the internship began. "In
February, after I received the internship, I talked to
one of the administrative aides in Santa Barbara. He
was helpful in identifying the kinds of work I would be
doing and in describing the experience." Evered cites
other determinants of the quality of the internship,
such as size of the office and whether the internship
entails working for a senator or a congressman. Pay
also makes a difference, he said. Congressional and
volunteer internships often offer more flexibility and
responsibility for the student.
Yet, in spite of its functional success, Evered's in
ternship was, in his opinion, far from ideal. The prob
lems Evered had with his position in Washington re
sulted because his political views differed from the
congressman for which he worked. According to
Evered, the intern becomes, in a sense, an extension
of the official for whom he is working. If the intern's
political ideologies don't line up with the con
gressman's or senator's, a great deal of tension may

result between office staff and intern. "I found myself
writing arguments that didn t coincide witli my own
political In the end I felt like I was prostituting
my writing skill."
The mechanics of an intern'** role in a political office
often involve writing â€” the writing of press releases,
legislation and answering constituent mail. Evered re
ports that much of the writing is not top quality. "A lot
of the writing done in the office is rhetoric, empty
phraseology, and is done on things that are not of
much significance."
As a result, Evered became disillusioned with the
experience. "I saw so much time wasted, so much
done for the image of the congressman.'
The intern's working experience is not limited to
the congressional office. Superimposed on the office
structure is the broad structure of the federal gov
ernment. Even if the intern is absolved of the respon
sibility of rhetorical writing, he is still left to grapple
with the federal system. Senior Lisa Eoster worked for
Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) Eoster was respon
sible for all legislative analysis and correspondence
related to issues in health care. Hence, Foster was
able to observe first-hand the details of how a bill
becomes a law. Foster sees her intimacy with the
federal system as a reeducation in American govern
ment. "Before I left for Washington, I had no idea of
the way the federal government really functioned, or
rather I had impressions that were, in fact, very naive,
very simplistic. I understood the system in terms of its
broad structure. This kind of understanding gives you
no idea of how the system really works."
$y working exclusively on health care legislation,
Foster discovered that the federal system works on a
premise of compromise. "Legislators are being influ
enced from every angle by lobbying interest groups or
established moneyed interests or their constituents.
And by the time a bill gets through a committee and
then through the floor of the Senate you end up with
a compromise program. It's not the best bill for what
it is supposed to do; it's not even cost efficient and
everybody in Washington knows it."
Vet, Eoster sees her experience in Washington,
though disillusioning, as extremely valuable. "I came
away extremely disillusioned, very frustrated, but I
learned an enormous amount."
This is a common sentiment echoed by many stu
dents who spend a summer working among the in
tracies, bureaucracies and thrills of the federal gov
ernment. Often things in Washington don't work as
they are envisioned by interns. But most students
agree that the knowledge and insights gained are well
worth the frustrations.

For many students here, the prospect of a
Washington, D.C. internship is a culmination. It is
seen as the synthesis of an ideological education and
as a practical working experience in viewing the com
plexities of the American government. It promises to
be a lesson in the way things work.
Yet for some University students, these promises
dissolve quickly into myths. Internships in
Washington sometimes don't work. Students find
themselves frustrated with ineffectual tasks like open
ing mail and xeroxing papers. Often they become
frustrated with the maze of bureaucracy that charac
terizes federal government.
The blame for these frustrations, students concede,
is on both the student's naivite and with problems
inherent in the political system itself.
