# Going past the moon, into the galaxy
## Imaginarium users probe 'mind's eye' 
### MARY WENTWORTH 
When was the last time you
gave all of your attention to
the sensory experience of
smelling an apple? Not last
week? After several minutes in
the Engineering Department s
Imaginarium, you could be
doing just that, listening to the
words of a program narrator
who is "attempting to make
participants experience
numerous stimuli with the
mind's eye."
The Imaginarium is a red,
16-foot geodesic dome, de
signed and outfitted by Prof.
Robert McKim of the Mechan
ical Engineering (ME) Depart
ment here. The dome pro
vides a specialized environ
ment that allows "students to
get in touch with their imagi
nations," McKim said.
Created in 1972 and im
proved in 1976 with money
from a Kodak Corp. grant and
numerous honorariums or
speaking fees granted to
McKim, the Imaginarium is
used in ME 101, "Visual Think
ing," a course offered autumn
quarter here. Slides and films
are projected onto the white
interior of the dome. Music,
thunderstorm noises and
numerous other auditory and

touch stimuli are used.
"At one point participants
imagine they're in an apple or
chard. We inject the smell of
apples through the air condi
tioning system. People also
have the experience of going
out into space. We project a
film that gives participants the
experience of going out into
the universe, past the moon
and into the galaxy," McKim
said.
Viewer-listeners lie on a
thickly carpeted platform in
side the dome, striving to
reach a state of "relaxed atten
tion," while not tailing asleep
in the warm pleasant sur
roundings.
The purpose of using the
Imaginarium to encourage
people to pay more attention
"to images in the mind's eye,"
McKim said. "Our society
does not reward that type ot
thinking. The University re
wards verbal, mathematical
thinking or other types of
symbolic thinking. I don't
argue with that, but I think
there are types of thinking that
go unrewarded and those
could he highly regarded
also."
In order to experience the
Imaginarium, a group of at
least 10 people must be or
ganized. The group negotiates
a price with the two program
directors, graduate students
Mark Gottlieb and Gail Curtis.
The cost is approximately $1
apiece, McKim said, depend

ing on the size ot the group
and the decisions about cost
made by Gottlieb and Curtis.
Each program lasts one
hour. Presently, Imaginarium I
is the only program in use. But
two other programs, Im
aginarium II and 111, are cur
rently being updated by volun
teers. Slides for those prog
rams were lost several months
ago, McKim said.
In addition to lost slides,
numerous other problems
have interrupted use of the
Imaginarium, McKim said.
"We've had people break into
the dome and vandalize it.
We've had things stolen. One
time some people broke in
and took the 10-inch spherical
lens that blows the Im
aginarium slides up onto the
ceiling. They took that lens
and rolled it down the stairs.
They caused a lot of damage to
the lens. I can't help but be
lieve that high school students
got in there then."
McKim believes the Im
aginarium has been a success
ful tool. "Sometimes people
really start to see things in new
and different ways, unlike
things they've experienced be
fore. But we have some
people who ore mbarrassed
about anything that has to do
with inner experience. Our
society is not oriented to inner
experiences."
Students also have reacted
favorably. "I like being pulled
by the hand through the crea

tive process. You have to let
your mind go a little hit cra/y. I
loved it," junior David Cuin, a
civil engineering major, said.
Several students, however,
have been "told so emphati
cally to stop paying attention
to the imaginative side of their
experience, to 'stop imagining
things,' that they can't look at
the experience as worth
while," Mckim added.
Occasionally, "during the
part of the program in which
people are told to relax, some
always fall asleep," he said.
In today's world of cosmic
laser concerts and other exis
tential experiences, a trip to
the Imaginarium can hardly he
called "unhelievahle," one
student said, "but it is cer
tainly unusual."

Concentrated relaxation is the first step in the Imaginarium experience. Participants are then led
through a one-hour presentation of visual, auditory and touch stimuli.
