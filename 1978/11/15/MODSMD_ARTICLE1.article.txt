# Bearial kicks off Big Game activities
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
Ever since Billy Erb, a student, in
troduced the effigy of a bear to the
University in 1899, decapitated it at
the Stanford-Berkeley game and cut
the bear's blue and gold ribbons into
little snippets, the campus has re
verberated with one dominant cry
the week before Big Game: "Give
'em the axe, the axe, the axe. . .
At noon today, yet another Cal
Osky bear will face the hatchet, and a
large number of weenies will be con
sumed as well, as festivities for Big
Game Week are kicked off with the
annual Big Game Bearial at White
Plaza.
The week will also include perfor
mances of the Gaieties tomorrow
and Friday, an all-campus rally with
the Stanford followed by a new
"Big Game Fireworks Extravaganza"
at Lake Lagunita tomorrow night, and
the Band's Big Game Eve March
through San Francisco on Friday
night.
The Bearial this afternoon will fea
ture the Band, the Dollies and the
yell leaders, as well as the decapita
tion of the bear, according to
sophomore Doug Greenfield, Big
Game Week coordinator.
Traditionally, the Cal Osky bear
was burned in the annual bonfire
held the Thursday night before the
Big Game. In 1957, however, the bear
was first burned, then taken from the
fire and buried, according to assis
tant University archivist Roxanne Ni
lan. After that year the bear was just
buried or, as last year, dumped into
"The Claw" water fountain at White
Plaza following the removal of his
head.
This year, a new Weenie Roast at
Tresidder Union will be part of the
event, with hot dogs and beverages
sold at a reduced price. The yell
leaders will lead the "Give 'em the
axe" cheer, "the one cheer every
body likes," said Greenfield, and the

traditional Dirty Golden Bear song
will top the rally.
The Fireworks Extravaganza at Lake
Lagunita is also a new event this year,
"our hope of an alternative to the
bonfire," said Greenfield.
The bonfire, which dates back
nearly to the beginning of the
Stanford-Berkeley rivalry in 1892 (the
first fire was in 1904), was greatly re
duced in size in 1976 and the idea was
completely doused last year, due to a
variety of environmental and safety
problems, Greenfield explained.
The Band will march from dorm to
dorm tomorrow night and will end
their march at the lake in time for the
fireworks.
Earlier tomorrow, final judging for
the Inter-Sorority Council
sponsored house decoration con
test, with a prize of two kegs for the
winning dorm or frat and one keg to
the runner-up, will be held.
"We're really looking for creativity
in this contest," said Inter-Sorority
Council President Tammy Ritchey.
The Inter-Fraterntiy Council (IFC)
will once again sponsor the Mega-
Nooner beginning at noon on Friday.
The Nooner is a large party for the
entire campus, held between the
Delta Upsilon and Beta Theta Pi
houses. The Mega-Nooner was
begun last year and was "a huge suc
cess," according to IFC president
Kurt Osenbaugh.
Later Friday afternoon, a senior
class Big Game happy hour will be
held at the Alpine Inn (Zot's), accord
ing to Leslie Crozier, senior class
president.
After the final Gaieties show, a
"non-Fire rally" will be held at White
Plaza, featuring the Band, the foot
ball team and special speakers yet to
be announced. Following the rally,
an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people
will make the annual pilgramage to
