## Begin's policies sensible 
### 
Menachem Begin? A good
guy? Sure! His sense of history
is certainly touched by
emotionalism, but on the
whole his policies reflect the
legitimate interests of the Is
raeli people. What's more, Be
gin's policies are fully in the in
terest of international peace.
Take the Palestinian issue.
The Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) refuses to
recognize Israel's right to exist,
but strangely expects to be
granted a state of its own. Yasir
Arafat would take delight in
pushing every jew into the sea.
Begin, then, quite reasonably
refuses to negotiate with the
PLO, offering instead to deal
with local Palestinians in the
occupied territories. Begin is
not displaying a "Holocaust
complex," simply common
sense. He values lewish life
over Palestinian statehood, a
goal that I, as a lew, can sym
pathize with. Begin has never
said that he will not give back
the West Bank, just that its final
status will be negotiated.
Begin's settlement policy is
also legitimate. While half a
million Arabs live within Israel
with full citizenship, Arabs
somehow reject the notion
that Jews can live within Arab
borders. Since 1948, over
700,000 Jews have immigrated
to Israel from Arab countries,
the majority exiled with their
property confiscated. The en
tire Jewish community of
Yemen, for example, was
evicted and resettled in Israel
at tremendous social and
economic cost. The West Bank
is historically important to the
lewish people, and there is no
reason that Jews should not
live there, even under Arab
sovereignty, following the
signing of a comprehensive
Middle Eastern peace. Begin's
refusal to dismantle West Bank
settlements is entirely in keep
ing with Israeli national in
terest.
The Jerusalem issue is more
complicated. Originally slated
by the United Nations to be in
ternationalized, Old Jerusalem
was conquered by Jordan in
the 1948 war. In that war, the
entire Jewish community of the
Old City was decimated. The
Western Wall, the holiest site
of Judaism, was declared off
limits to Jewish visitors. Many
Jewish graves near the Old City
were desecrated by Arab sol
diers.
The Israeli reconquering of
Jerusalem in 1967 reopened
the holy places to Jews, but
did not close them to Mos
lems. Israel has conceded that
members of each religion
should have control of and ac
cess to their own holy places.
Begin refuses, however, to
make Jewish control of and ac
cess to the Western Wall de
pendent upon the whims of
Arab leaders who have, in the
past, denied Jews access to the

Wall. Begin's policies protect
lewish rights without denying
Moslems their religious rights.
The claim that Israel does not
really want peace is absurd; Is
rael desperately needs and
wants peace. Nearly every Is
raeli family has lost a member
to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Is
rael's economy is teetering on
the brink of collapse as a result
of enormous defense expendi
tures; one third of Israel's
Cross National Project (CNP) is
normally spent on defense,
and a whole year's GNP was
spent on the last war. Israelis
also have the highest percapita
income tax in the world. Israel
agreed to dismantle one billion
dollars' worth of settlements in
the Sinai desert, and to forgo
income from vast oil deposits,
to achieve peace with Egypt.
Israel has won five defensive
wars (the War of Attrition,
fought in 1969, is little known,
but produced more Israeli

casualties than the 1967 cam
paign), but only in the last 11
years has she had defensible
borders.
The Arab-Israeli conflict is
perhaps the only one in history
in which the side that was both
the loser and the aggressor ex
pects to dictate the peace
terms: return of all occupied
territories. Israel's stake in
peace is so large that she ac
cepts this concept in part; Is
rael will return land taken in
war, but only in exchange for
genuine peace. Begin has thus
far refused to promise to re
turn the occupied West Bank,
but the Arabs who live there
have thus far refused to
negotiate peace.
Begin is not intransigent; he
has repeatedly said that all is
sues are negotiable. He just
has Israel's survival as his top
priority.
