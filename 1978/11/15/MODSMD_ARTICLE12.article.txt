## McCloskey's plan racist 
### 
Last week, University voters joined
other voters in the 12th Congressional Dis
trict as they overwhelmingly reelected
Paul "Pete" McCloskey to the House of
Representatives. This action may be taken
by the middle-aged, middle and upper
class white men who rule America as af
firming that they will have "no trouble"
with the student population when the rul
ing class re-institutes a mandatory draft.
As many University students should
know, only two weeks before the election
McCloskey lofted a political balloon. On
October 25, the Daily reported that
McCloskey feared "an all-black army."
According to the Daily, the Congressper
son contended that "reasonable" young
men do not enlist any more. Thus by
McCloskey's analysis, those who do enlist
are predominantly Third World men who
are "unreasonable."
McCloskey has offered his "solution" to
his conception of a "frightful" situation:
his proposed national service plan (other
wise known as a reinstitution of the draft).
According to the Congressperson, all 18
year-old Americans would be drafted to
"serve" their country either in the military
service for one year or in "government
service" for two years. Those in the milit
ary would allegedly provide a "combat
ready force" — a difficult task for people
serving only one year — that would show
the Russians that the United States is
"ready to go at the drop of a hat."
McCloskey contends that those indi
viduals who are inducted into mandatory
government service would provide labor
in agriculture, thus "cutting off illegal im
migrants now working in the fields." Un
fortunately, the politician did not explain
how this exclusion process might work.
I believe that what McCloskey has pub
licly stated is worth more than a little gasp
by the University community. McClos
key's attitudes about the "unreasonable"
nature of the Third World population in
the military coupled with his contention
that the U.S. will go to war "at the drop of a
hat" should be enough to startle liberals
and even some conservatives. However, a
more thorough analysis — beyond the

thinking processes of most liberals or con
servatives — of what lies beneath the "na
tional service plan" is called for. What the
Congressperson does not say is even more
interesting than what he does publicly
admit.
Why is there an increasing number of
poor, undereducated, Third World per
sons in the ranks of the repressive force of
the American State? This can be accounted
for by the fact that capitalist economic re
lations create, as an inherent part of their
functioning, a "reserve army of labor" that
is unemployed and often destitute. This
underclass serves many functions in the
capitalist system, but its primary one is to
exert a threat to those who are employed.
Thus, the employed must keep their wage
and benefits demands low orthey will face
"replacement" by members of the reserve
labor force. The reserve army of labor can
also be called into service during "boom"
periods of capitalist production. This
means an unemployed underclass is not a
problem that can be fixed by this or that
government policy, but rather this under
class is an integral part of an operating
capitalist system.
In our society, institutionalized racism
has been the ideological justification for
the maintenance of a large number of
Thi rd World persons in the reserve army of
labor, i.e., in the unemployed destitute
underclass of our society. When the draft
was abolished after the Vietnam War, most
white middle class people had very little
reason to forgo opportunities for
employment in the "civilian" sector.
However, the predominantly poor, un
educated people of the reserve army of
labor provided "willing" (read desperate)
recruits for the volunteer army.
One might think that this state of affairs
would be very palatable to the ruling class.
However, there are many dangers inhe
rent in this situation. These are some of
the dangers that McCloskey may have
been thinking about when he exclaimed
his fear of an all black (or poor) military.
First, if the members of the military's en
listed ranks were to grasp class conscious

ness and see that their interests might not
be best served by serving the ruling class,
then the guns that these people tote might
be turned on their oppressors.
Second, and a more immediate problem
for McCloskey ef al., is the possibility that
a predominantly Third World U.S. military
may not be willing to "go at the drop of a
hat" to put down liberation struggles in
the Third World. For, as most aware
people realize, The United States is ap
proaching a period of history that may see
it traversing the globe to forcefully stop
socialist liberation struggles. These
movements threaten the ability of interna
tional capitalists to extract profits from
their operations in the Third World. These
profits are crucial to the stability of the
international capitalist system, as these
profits contribute to the growth of
monopoly capitalist enterprises, and they
also "pay-off" the employed workers in
the United States and other Western in
dustrialized nations. This payoff forestalls
liberation movements in these industrial
capitalist nations.
Rep. McCloskey recognized this latter
"problem" when he "agreed" with his
minority critics who say "we won't fight
your imperialist wars (Daily, Nov. 7)."
Further, the politician seems to insist that
such wars are inevitable when he noted
"they (his minority critics) can't have it
both ways." In other words, if there is no
draft only Third World people will be in
the military fighting imperialist wars, but
under the new draft plan everyone will
"equally" participate in imperialist polic
ing operations. What remains constant in
the argument is that there will be wars with
United States military participation.
So far I have pointed out that McCloskey
and other members of the ruling class
have good reason to fear "an all-black
army." In my next column I will discuss
some of the reasons why McCloskey's
"national service plan" will fill some of the
present day needs of American capitalists.
