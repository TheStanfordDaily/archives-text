Supporting Bhutto
If I understand Anjum Altaf
Mir's point (Daily, Nov. 10), he
finds the campaign to save
Bhutto's life unacceptable be
cause of the former Prime
Minister's "bad" political re
cord. It is ludicrous to promote
this sort of logic.
Although Mir makes refer
ences to my article about
Bhutto, neither in the original
column nor here do I indulge
in commentary on particular
Pakistani politics. The argu
ments against Bhutto that Mir
uses in his article are not new.
They have been around for a
long time. Yet, since political
events could bear different in
terpretations, the Pakistanis
chose not to believe several of
Mir's conclusions. Instead they
elected Bhutto overwhelm
ingly. No one denies that his
popularity today is even
stronger.
In view of Bhutto's current
predicament, arguments on
his political record are an exer
cise in futility. Although Bhutto
never shunned controversy
while prime minister, he could
hardly defend himself from his
death cell and in a state of
military dictatorship. It is in
comprehensible to even un
wittingly compare Bhutto's re
cord to the current military
monstrosity.
Bhutto's case is clear. He is a
victim of an obviously trumped
up charge with the sole pur
pose of eliminating him. His
death will certainly be a size
able blow to his country's
prospects of democratic de
velopment. Because of his
overwhelming popularity his
execution will bring upheavals
in Pakistan with repercussions
that could transcend the
boundaries of his country.
Bhutto's trial and execution are

certainly a violation of human
rights and a marked danger for
peace.

Clearing Bhutto's
record
There are two major ele
ments in Anjum Altaf Mir's arti
cle (Daily, Nov. 10), that I
would like to refer to: firstly his
interpretation of the split bet
ween Pakistan and Bangladesh
and secondly Bhutto's record.
Mir forgets that Pakistan had
for 13 years been turned into a
political wasteland by the re
gimes of military dictatorship.
Even before the conflict of 1971
took its most sanguine turn,
the fascist junta was converting
the wasteland into a graveyard.
Mir also forgets that the con
flict did not come into being
because of the exploitation of
one region by another but by
the exploitation of both by a
ruling class which admitted no
accountability to the people.
The outcome of the conflict
was not a defeat for Pakistan or
its armed forces but the col
lapse of a system which had
been foisted on Pakistan. A
democratic Pakistan would
never have split into two.
Regarding Bhutto's record:
1) In his six years of govern
ment the country was firmly
under civilian rule.
2) Pakistan had established
institutions of government
which assured the stabilization
of its political life.
3) Bhutto's government de
veloped a federal constitution
with the nation's unanimous
support which solved the prob
lem of the regional autonomy
and simultaneously
safeguarded national unity.

4) Pakistan enjoyed freedom
of expression after suppres
sion for nearly a decade and a
half.
5) According to the World
Bank the country had staged an
economic recovery that was
unparalleled by any other
country ravaged by war.
6) Pakistan adopted social
and economic measures which
assured a fair deal for the
people and prevented the ap
propriation of the nation's
wealth for the benefit of the
few.
Yes, Bhutto did impose mar
tial law in response to agita
tion. But it was also the first
time in the history of Pakistan
that the judiciary felt indepen
dent enough to declare the
martial law illegal. It was lifted.
Any government is liable to
err. However, in the case of
democratic regimes there is
always the catharsis of the bal
lot. For the current junta this is
not viable.

Griffin unappealing
Readers of the Daily have
recently been inundated by a
flood of propaganda proclaim
ing the glories of selecting the
griffin as our mascot. The
"Friends of the Griffin" seem
to be the only group actively
campaigning on campus for
their candidate (a few scat
tered feathers and branches
aside), but in spite of the al
leged support for this creature
I'm afraid that I just can't buy
it.
While the physical attributes
of humans should not distract
us from their true worth, mas

cots are different. The appear
ance of a school's symbolic
representative is highly impor
tant.
This brings me to my first
point: the griffin looks like a
winged baboon. While the
publicized image of this bestie
is appealing to some, one
need only glance at the griffin
illustration in Webster's to
learn of the more mangy varia
tions. But I'll save you the
trouble — it looks like a flying
dog.
Secondly, and this is impor
tant, Griffin supporters claim
that their mascot is a tradi
tional symbol of courage, wis
dom, and all the good things.
What they fail to mention is
that the griffin's origin, though
somewhat obscure, dates
from around the second mil
lenium B.C. in the Near East
ern and Mediterranean lands.
The image persisted through
out history, essentially as a
creation of those whose re
ligious beliefs and supersti
tions it was designed to
safeguard.
Some maintain that this trad
ition is one of the Griffin's big
advantages. But who are they
trying to fool? The Griffin's
tradition is not ours by any
stretch of the imagination —
so let's not steal it and pretend
it is. Besides, the University
prides itself on its innovative
spirit and lack of traditions, as
evidenced by our band and
the cheers we manage to yell
at football games. We don't
have a mascot tradition, we
don't like traditional mascots,
so let's go from there and not
try to deceive people with
some medieval monster.
Other mascot alternatives,
such as the tree, are much
more suitable in this respect.
But the other mascot alter
natives will not work either,

because of a problem which
the griffin also shares. It has
become too associated with
one special interest group and
has come to represent only
that faction's view of what our
mascot should be. What we
need is a more spontaneous
decision or, in President Ly
man's words, "a consensus"
on the part of the student
body as a whole. The occurr
ence of this, however, is at
best unpredictable.

I am just as impatient to find
a mascot as anyone else, but
I'm equally willing to wait for
the right one. To me the griffin
is ugly, obsolete, out of con
text with Stanford, and sup
ported by only a handful of the
student body. Support it if you
must, but frankly, I think that
the Stanford "Winged Ba
boons" sounds a lot better.
