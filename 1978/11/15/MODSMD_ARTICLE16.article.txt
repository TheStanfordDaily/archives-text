# Nelson, Francis set for Cal
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Despite the seasonal
obituary ABC-TV's )im Lampley
did on Stanford running back
Darrin Nelson after he was car
ried off the field Saturday in
Tempe with a knee sprain, the
sophomore halfback is ex
pected to return to the Cardi
nal starting lineup Saturday for
the 81st Big Came.
And for the first time in three
weeks, fullback Phil Francis
will be lining up alongside him.
"We expect Phil Francis to
return at full strength," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh told re
porters Monday. "Darrin Nel
son, we believe, will be full
strength. So we won't have ex
cuses after the game.
"We may have one or two
players that see only limited
duty," he added, "but the men
that move the ball for us (our

two running backs) will be
back together again."
Francis left the Oregon State
game in the first half with a
sprained ankle and did not suit
up for the USC and Arizona
State games. But the 6-foot-2,
220-pound senior still leads the
Pacific-10 in pass receptions
with 49. Six receptions against
Cal would tie Francis with Tony
Hill for the third highest single
season reception total at Stan
ford.
Last year, Nelson became
the first player in NCAA history
to run for 1000 yards and catch
50 passes in the same season.
To duplicate that feat this year,
Nelson needs 116 yards on the
ground and four catches this
weekend.
Cornerbacks John Pigott and
Rick Parker were both hobbled
by ankle sprains Saturday but

Pigott is expected to start and
Parker will probably see some
action, though perhaps not in a
starting role.
Cal coach Roger Theder's
troops across the Bay have not
fared as well in the recovery
ward. Nine Bear starters have
been injured this season and
seven of those may not start
Saturday.
But although Theder said
stalwart defensive end Ralph
DeLoach would not play this
weekend, the word from Ber
keley has it that DeLoach may
well be on the field when the
game starts.
Stanford, rated a five-point
favorite yesterday, was ranked
No. 20 in the UPI poll this
week. The only team with four
losses to be rated in either wire
service poll, the Cards are also
perhaps the only team with

four losses still being consi
dered for a bowl berth.
The Sun, Liberty and
Bluebonnet bowls have all ex
pressed interest in Stanford
either to the Athletic Depart
ment or the conference office.
Although the Sun Bowl folks
reportedly would like to have a
team with a more lustrous re
cord, Stanford may receive a
bid to return to El Paso should
the Cards win this weekend.
Walsh, however, said that "a
bowl is not as important as the
Big Game."
For Cal there are no bowl
hopes.
As Bear linebacker Ron Hill
said, "This is our bowl game."

weekend.
Cornerbacks John Pigott and
Rick Parker were both hobbled
by ankle sprains Saturday but

Pigott is expected to start and
Parker will probably see some
action, though perhaps not in a
starting role.
Cal coach Roger Theder's
troops across the Bay have not
fared as well in the recovery
ward. Nine Bear starters have
been injured this season and
seven of those may not start
Saturday.
But although Theder said
stalwart defensive end Ralph
DeLoach would not play this
weekend, the word from Ber
keley has it that DeLoach may
well be on the field when the
game starts.
Stanford, rated a five-point
favorite yesterday, was ranked
No. 20 in the UPI poll this
week. The only team with four
losses to be rated in either wire
service poll, the Cards are also
perhaps the only team with

four losses still being consi
dered for a bowl berth.
The Sun, Liberty and
Bluebonnet bowls have all ex
pressed interest in Stanford
either to the Athletic Depart
ment or the conference office.
Although the Sun Bowl folks
reportedly would like to have a
team with a more lustrous re
cord, Stanford may receive a
bid to return to El Paso should
the Cards win this weekend.
Walsh, however, said that "a
bowl is not as important as the
Big Game."
For Cal there are no bowl
hopes.
As Bear linebacker Ron Hill
said, "This is our bowl game."

Stanford running back Darrin Nelson (31) follows the blocking of fullback Phil Francis (37) ini the
Cardinals 34-31 loss to Washington Oct. 14. Nelson and Francis, both hobbled with leg injuries, are both
expected to start in Saturday's 81st Big Game at Berkeley.
Despite the seasonal
obituary ABC-TV's )im Lampley
did on Stanford running back
Darrin Nelson after he was car
ried off the field Saturday in
Tempe with a knee sprain, the
sophomore halfback is ex
pected to return to the Cardi
nal starting lineup Saturday for
the 81st Big Came.
And for the first time in three
weeks, fullback Phil Francis
will be lining up alongside him.
"We expect Phil Francis to
return at full strength," Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh told re
porters Monday. "Darrin Nel
son, we believe, will be full
strength. So we won't have ex
cuses after the game.
"We may have one or two
players that see only limited
duty," he added, "but the men
that move the ball for us (our

two running backs) will be
back together again."
Francis left the Oregon State
game in the first half with a
sprained ankle and did not suit
up for the USC and Arizona
State games. But the 6-foot-2,
220-pound senior still leads the
Pacific-10 in pass receptions
with 49. Six receptions against
Cal would tie Francis with Tony
Hill for the third highest single
season reception total at Stan
ford.
Last year, Nelson became
the first player in NCAA history
to run for 1000 yards and catch
50 passes in the same season.
To duplicate that feat this year,
Nelson needs 116 yards on the
ground and four catches this
weekend.
