# HATE STANFORD!
## 
### 
The most celebrated day in campus annals
may be the one on which the Immortal 21,
after three years of painstaking preparation,
heisted the Stanford Axe from California and
returned it to its original home.
The 15-inch woodsman blade, symbolic of
the Stanford-California rivalry, made its debut
at a baseball game April 15, 1899. Cardinal yell
leader Billy Erb hoped to use the Axe to rouse
more enthusiam for the Axe Yell. It was stolen
from Erb. For 31 years it remained on the Ber
keley campus.
But on April 3, 1930 a clever ruse by 21
Stanford men which used exploding
cameras, tear gas and fast get-away cars ena
bled the Axe to be returned to the Farm.
Like the return of the prodigal son, the re
turn of the /4xe caused an outpour of joy on
the Stanford campus. In Berkeley, however,
the mood was black.
William Hudson, editor of the Daily
Californian, wrote the following editorial on
April 4, 1930 which attests to the importance
placed on the Axe:
"Stanford is likely to wake up on a different
campus this morning. The clever boys who
stole the Axe may have returned to paint the

town red, but they may find the place painted
Blue and Gold before the night is over.
"Hate Stanford! Catch the euphony of that
sentence, notice its essential accuracy! Hate
Stanford! Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips! HATE
STANFORD!
"We have always had a notion as to the sort
of people that inhabit the Cod-forsaken
campus4o miles south, and our notion is now
confirmed. The rally committee, though it
may have erred in allowing the armored car
to be too far in advance of the scanty freshman
guard, cannot be blamed for being routed by
the most carefully planned racketeer robbery
in local history. Stanford, despairing of an
honest burglary, imported Chicago
methods. Tear bombs may be fair play at
Stanford — but then, that is Stanford! HATE
STANFORD!
"We are nurturing one special animosity,
and that is for Stanford. And we won't be very
sorry if the Stanford boys find their Quad a
deserted ruin this morning, and the campus
returned to the desert from which it
came. If Stanford gets satisfaction out of
this, OK. So do we out of HATING STAN
FORD!"
