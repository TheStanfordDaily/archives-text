# Woosie-0 upsets Kappa Sigma
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
The top seven seeds all ad
vanced in the B division as the
intramural playoffs opened last
week.
The B's completed a qualify
ing round and the first round,
while two coed games and one
women's contest were also
played.
The biggest casualty in the B
division was eighth-seeded
Kappa Sigma, a 19-6 loser to
Woosie-O. The fifth-seeded
Donnerrheas also had a scare
but they converted an extra
point to hold off Serra, 7-6.
Among the non-seeded
squads, the Stags and DU are
the most impressive and both
have solid chances for the
championship. The Stags won
their qualifying game, 27-0,
over Who Are We and then
proceeded to stop previously
undefeated Toro, 12-7, in the
first round. DU won the best
first-round matchup when they
outlasted Bootables 11, 19-12.
In that game the Bootables
trailed 13-12 with less than a
minute left and actually were
fortunate when DU scored a

touchdown, because they
were able to get possession of
the ball. Without the score, DU
could have run out the clock.
The Bootables couldn't
capitalize, however, as a last
second pass was intercepted.
The most attractive second
round pairings pit the Stags
against fourth-seeded
Crovath, Swaine and Moore,
and DU versus Organized
Grime, the third seed. Both
Crovath, Swaine and Moore
and Organized Grime had
shutouts in the first round, but
Grime got theirs only after they
had a terrible time tracking
down their players.
In the coed playoffs, Los
Arcos beat Hillel, 20-0, and Phi
Sig knocked off Sigma Chi,
12-7. Arcos and Phi Sig now
enter the first round beginning
this week.
All five women's teams en
tered the playoffs, and Madera
earned a berth in the semifinals
against Taste of Honey with a
6-0 victory over Rinconada.
High Energy faces Roble in the
other semifinal.
Taste of Honey, the top

seeded women's team, will
shun Stanford opposition this
weekend when they travel to
Berkeley for an IM Big Game
with the top women's team
from Cal. Game time is
scheduled for 10 a.m. Satur
day.
