If Friday night's women's
volleyball match against
Pacific was a heartbreaker,
last night's match against
USF was a mauling, as the
Cards trounced the Dons
15-0, 15-5 and 15-3.
According to Stanford
coach Fred Sturm, the Dons
are really a much less ex
perienced team than the
Cards, and that is the main
reason for the ease with
which the match was won.
The whole team played
what appeared to be a flaw
less match. It was a strong
night at the net for Stanford
as the Cards spiked re
peatedly on the San Fran
cisco defense. Fine seiting,
strong defense and several
ace services were all there,
too.
Stanford's record is now
12-6-1 overall, and 8-3 in
conference play. They will
take on the Golden Bears of
California Thursday at Ber
keley, and will wind up the
season with a match at
Fresno State Friday.
