# Meyer library to receive new HVAC system
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
). Henry Meyer Memorial Library will get a new
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
system by the end of next April following approval
of the improvement plan by the Board of Trustees
yesterday.
Trustees also heard a report on student housing
needs at the University at its meeting at the Hoover
Institution.
The new system, to cost $504,700, "will correct
the deficiencies of overheating, stale air and lack
of ventilation" in the undergraduate facility, ac
cording to a trustee background report.
The report stated that the present system "has
not functioned satisfactorily since the building
was constructed" in 1966.
No exact reason
Planning officeand library facility administrators
were largely unable to comment on the exact
reason for the 12-year period of unsatisfactory per
formance, stating that in most cases they were not
employed by the University when Meyer opened.
But many administrators speculated that correc
tion of the problem was not pursued within the
warranty period on the building, generally one
year, because "there probably was not a percep
tion that it was a system-wide problem."
During the first year of operation, the University
"tries to resolve our problems with a facility," said
lames Nelson, director of facilities. Nelson, how
ever, would not speculate on the Meyer problems.
Williams said several improvements in the sys-

tem have been attempted and some helped a little,
but not enough improvement was seen.
The decision was made to revamp the HVAC
system because too many students avoid Meyer in
part due to temperature and ventilation problems.
The system used in Meyer was a "relatively un
tried" system, "bordering on experimental" when
it was installed, said Philip Leighton, building pro
jects manager for the libraries.
Minimize noise
The system, he said, was designed to minimize
noise. The air is pumped into open space above
the ceiling tiles and allowed to circulate into the
building through slots in the ceiling.
The present system uses no ducts.
Leighton said that without ducts, the air does
not move into the building space with enough
velocity; consequently, air tends to stagnate.
Without ducts, however, the noise associated
with air being pumped into the building is elimi
nated.
Leighton said it is ironic, but the ventilation sys
tem in Meyer is actually too quiet.
According to Williams, "it was deemed impor
tant to make Meyer Library comfortable Enough so
it would continue to be used" after the new Green
Library addition is completed.
A large number o' undergraduates using Green
Library primarily instead of Meyer would "impact
severely its (Green's) research effectiveness," ac
cording to the trustees background material. "This
phenomenon was observed when the new Law
School Library was opened in 1975," the report

stated.
At its meeting, trustees also heard a report on
student housing needs here, which recommends
the construction of 800 new housing units.
The projected cost of the project is set at $15 to
$25 million, a figure which would likely add hun
dreds of dollars to room and board bills during the
next decade, the report stated.
For example, if the 800 unit plan were selected
and rooms were occupied by 1982, the cost of
room and board would rise an estimated 9.5 per
cent that year. This compares with an 8 percent
boost under a 500 unit alternative program and a 6
percent increase without any new construction.
Recommendations
Specifically, the report recommends:
— construction of 460 spaces for under
graduates to replace current housing in Manzanita
Park;
— reallocation of the park to single graduate
students at least through 1990, the expected life of
the trailers;
— construction of an additional 340 under
graduate spaces.
— reallocation of some spaces in Mirrielees
Apartments to make the facility all
undergraduate;
— conversion of the Blackwelder high-rise in
Escondido Village from mixed married and single
graduates to all single graduates; and
— reallocation of spaces in Escondido Village
low-rise buildings from married to single graduate
students.
