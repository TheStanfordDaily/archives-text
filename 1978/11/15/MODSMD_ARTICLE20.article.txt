## Football finances: winning at the revenue game 
### 
Stanford spends how much on
football per year? Roughly $750,000?
That may seem like an awfully large
amount of money to spend on one
sport, but many major universities
have found that a football program
can be a great source of income for
the rest of their athletic program.
Sure, $750,000 is a lot of money,
but it becomes obvious why the Ath
letic Department would spend that
much when one sees that in 1977, for
instance, Stanford made a net of
$1,900,000 from its football program
alone. That figure accounted for 41
percent of the Athletic Department's
income during the year.
According to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Don Tobin, $750,000 isn't all
that much when compared to the
budgets of some other universities.
"We've found that we are competing
with Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Arkan
sas and the like for our players," he
said. "We're in a very competitive
market and we probably have spent
less than we should have in the past.
"Last year we spent about $60,000
on recruiting players. That includes
travel expenses, food and lodging for
eight coaches, and bringing ath
letes here to see the campus. That's
really less than what most colleges

spend, and from that we should get
between 15 to 20 new players.
"The rest of the $750,000 goes to
coaches' salaries, new equipment,
referees for home games, awards
and travel," he said. "All the scholar
ship money comes from the Buck
Club."
Tobin said the biggest expense in
volved in running a football program
is paying salaries, followed by travel
expenses. "Our salaries were in
creased when Bill Walsh and the new
staff arrived. Their salaries are com
petitive with the rest of the Pac-10,
though," he said.
Transporting a football team ac
ross the country for an away game
would obviously be expensive. "Go
ing to Colorado last year," Tobin
said, "cost us about $30,000, and we
can expect to spend about $35,000
for next year's trip toTulane. It seems
like a lot of money, but our expenses
are basically pegged to the economic
indicators. We're not spending any
more on a trip than anyone else
One might wonder how much ef
fect the new names on the Stanfoid
coaching staff has had on the de
partment's finances.
"Our program has really turned
around," explained Tobin, "al
though we have been having win

ning seasons for some time. We have
had a rise in ticket sales, and our
coaching changes have to have
helped. People will get behind a
winning program, and more and
more people are starting to get ex
cited about all Stanford sports."
How about the athletes on grants,
how much money do they account
for?
According to Ray Young, assistant
athletic director, there are currently
86 football players on athletic grants,
nine less than the NCAA maximum
figure of 95. They account for
$527,380 in aid. There are a total of
156 men on grants for all sports, ac
counting f0r5845,517. This yearthere
are 22 women on grants, which
amounts to $87,000. Tobin said this
figure has been increasing steadily
and will continue to do so in the next
few years.
The football team makes money on
the road as well as at home.
"The formula varies from confer
ence to conference," Tobin said,
"but in the Pac-10, the gate is split
evenly between the two teams. Of
course, there are some exclusions
for the home team. Student tickets
don't count in the split, for instance,
and the faculty and players get some
complimentary tickets which don't

count either. The expenses are about
$20,000 for an average game, and
about $30,000 for a big game, be
cause we have to hire more security
and all. So, we take those expenses
and subtract them from the total gate
profit before we split it with the visit
ing team."
So, of the $310,000 grossed from
last year's Big Came against Califor
nia, approximately $30,000 was taken
out for expenses, leaving $280,000 to
be split between the two schools.
Some of the other games did well,
too. The UCLA game was good for
about $142,000 and the USC game hit
$182,000, while the game at Oregon
State made a scant $26,000.
"The return from the games at
Washington State, Oregon State and
Oregon is usually pretty minimal,"
Tobin said. "Now we have a deal
where we are guaranteed a minimum
of $25,000, or 50 percent after their
expenses."
And is there any bonus for post
season play?
The Sun Bowl, which Stanford
played in last winter, guaranteed
$175,000 to the Pac-8. Stanford's ex
penses were subtracted from this to
tal, then the remainder was divided
among the eight conference teams.

The Rose Bowl, after covering
Washington's expenses last year,
paid $210,947 to each Pac-8 team.
"It's not any greater financially to
participate in a bowl game," Tobin
said. "But the exposure really helps
us."
The same would appear to hold
true for games broadcast on televi
sion. "We can expect a return of
about $110,000 for the San Jose State
game televised earlier this season,"
Tobin said. "That, of course, will be
split with the other teams in the Pac
-10."
A school can't plan on getting any
money from TV before the season
starts, though. "You never know if
you're going to be on television until
a couple of weeks before the game,"
Tobin said. "After the season has
started you basically have to play
your way on to TV. They want teams
that are doing well."
And how much money does Stan
ford get for the football games
broadcast on commercial radio?
"Well," Tobin said, "we have a
radio contract with KSFO (in San
Francisco) for both our football and
basketball seasons which is worth
$25,000 per year. We're not getting
rich off it, but we're getting a good
amount of exposure."
