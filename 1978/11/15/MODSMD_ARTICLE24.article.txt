Middle East talks in pivotal stage
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said yesterday
the peace talks with Israel are at a turning point
and he is sending his vice president to Washington
with a message for President Jimmy Carter.
"We have reached a turning point. If the other
side does not respond, well, this will be their re
sponsibility before the whole world," said Sadat,
referring to Israel.
The main sticking point has been Egypt's insis
tence that a peace treaty with Israel be bound to a
commitment on speedy talks over the future of the
West Bank and Gaza, where 1.1 million Palesti
nians live.
Israel has rejected this, saying the peace treaty
should stand on its own.
In a Washington TV interview Monday night,
Carter gave his most rueful assessment of the talks
since the Camp David peace accords were signed
in September.
"I just don't know what will happen about it; we
just pray that agreements will be reached," Carter
said. "We are involved in the negotiations, but we
cannot make Israel accept the Egyptians' demands
nor vice versa. We have to try to tone down those
demands and use our influence."
Amin pulls troops from Tanzania
Nairobi, Kenya — Ugandan President Idi Amin
announced yesterday he has ordered the with
drawal of his troops from their two-week-old "hot
pursuit" invasion of Tanzania. But Tanzania de
nounced the statement as "complete lies" and
"camouflage" and vowed to keep fighting.
"The struggle continues," said a Tanzanian gov
ernment statement issued in reply to Amin's an
nouncement.
The withdrawal order was announced in a tele
gram to the Organization of African Unity, the
United Nations and the Arab League, Radio
Uganda said.
"I have decided to withdraw my armed forces to
the recognized border of Uganda and Tanzania in
spite of the provocations which earlier led them to
Tanzanian territory in an exercise of their right of
hot pursuit," Amin was quoted as saying.
In its invasion of north-western Tanzania,
Uganda annexed 710-square miles of land north of
the strategic Fagera River. Amin said the attack was
in retaliation for an alleged Tanzanian invasion of
Uganda a week earlier.
Cable car accident injures 17
San Francisco — One of San Francisco's famed
cable cars lurched to an abrupt halt on a steep
downtown hill yesterday, injuring at least 17 per
sons and prompting a wildcat walkout by drivers
who said the cars were unsafe.
"The drivers say the cars are unsafe and they are
not going to operate them under these condi
tions," said San Francisco Municipal Railway chief
inspector Art Curtis.
The gripman of the car involved in the accident
crashed through the windshield and landed on a
taxicab. He and a child who complained of neck
and back pain were admitted to Mission
Emergency Hospital.
"The cable car stopped but the people didn't,"
police Sgt. James Christman said in describing the

mishap on the California Street hill near Kearney
Street, not far from Chinatown. He said many pas
sengers were thrown sprawling onto the pave
ment.
FBI informer testifies on hit list
Houston — FBI informant David McCrory tes
tified yesterday that millionaire Cullen Davis
"kinda laughed" as he coolly ordered the murders
of 15 persons for sums ranging up to $200,000.
At one point, McCrory testified under the gaze
of armed federal guards in the murder conspiracy
trial, Davis instructed his one-time friend to find a
"hit man" for the first victim.
"If you turn me around," McCrory quoted Davis
as saying, "I'll kill you and your whole damn fam
ily. You know I've got the money and the power to
.have it done."
McCrory, 40, the key prosecution witness, said
it was one such threat that convinced him to in
form the FBI and ask for protection.
The alleged hit list included Davis' estranged
wife, Priscilla, his younger brother, two judges
and several witnesses who testified against Davis
lastyear. In that murder trial in Amarillo, Davis was
acquitted of shooting his 12-year-old stepdaugh
ter.
He is charged specifically in this case with solicit
ing the murder of )udge )oe Eidson of Fort Worth,
who presided over his divorce.
Grocery prices to rise next year
Washington — Prices at the local grocery store
will increase about 7.5 percent next year, with the
bulk of the higher cost being paid to the middle
men of the food industry, the Agriculture Depart
ment predicted yesterday.
Department experts said the increase should be
less than this year's 10 percent hike — the sharpest
rise in four years — but they didn't guarantee it.
They said the increase could be as little as 6
percent or as much as 10 percent next year, de
pending on such factors as inflation and weather.
The food price prediction came from J.B. Penn,
deputy administrator of the department's
Economics, Statistics and Cooperatives Service
and until recently a senior economist for the pres
ident's Council of Economic Advisers.
Based on current circumstances, Penn said,
higher overall farm prices may add 2 percent to
1979 food costs, higher marketing charges by mid
dlemen 4 percent and the cost of imported food
1.5 percent.
He said unpredictables such as weather and
global developments "will no doubt alter" the
price forecast. "A great deal depends on the suc
cess of the president's program of wage and price
standards," he added.
Fossil fuels cause acid rain
Washington — Scientists say man's omnivorous
appetite for fossil fuels has spawned a new
menace to the environment. The heavens, they
say, are raining acid.
Precipitation bearing nitric and sulfuric acids is
killing fish, eating away at buildings and threaten
ing to destroy the delicate balance of nature in
lush forests.
"We perceive the possibility of a major prob

lem," says Norman Glass, a research scientist at
the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
Glass believes the threat will worsen as the na
tion shifts more to coal to fuel its power plants.
Scientists say acid rain begins with fossil-fueled
power plants, smelters and automobiles discharg
ing nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides into the air.
Through complex chemical reactions in the at
mosphere, the oxides are changed into nitric and
sulfuric acids which then fall to earth in rain, snow
and fine debris.
No one seems to know exactly why, but the
problem of acid rain is especially acute in the
Scandanavian countries, and increasingly so in the
Northeastern United States.
More votes in; Garcia still leads
Sacramento —Sen. Arlen Gregorioand Republi
can Marz Garcia each picked up seven votes yes
terday, unofficially leaving Garcia still five votes
ahead in their seesaw race for the state Senate.
But George Mann, registrar of voters in Santa
Clara County, said there may still be four votes
missing in his county.
"There was a difference between the computer
count and the number of people who voted on
election day,"he said. "In two precincts, there is a
discrepancy of one ballot each, and in one pre
cinct there is a discrepancy of two ballots."
Before the 14 votes were added yesterday, Gar
cia had 87,967 votes to 87,962 for Gregorio, a two
term, San Mateo Democrat.
Dow Jones drops to 785.26
New York — Rising interest r ates, inflation wor
ries and talk of a possible recession added up to
another broad loss for the stock market yesterday.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials, which
had fallen 15.08 Monday to its lowest closing level
in seven months, dropped another 6.75 to 785.26.
In the past month the average has tumbled
111.83 points.
Losers outstripped gainers by more than a 5-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with
more than 1300 issues losing ground.
Analysts said stock prices were depressed by a
widespread belief that interest rates will continue
to rise.
A handful of banks in Chicago and Philadelphia
raised their prime lending rates Monday from 10 J /4
to 11 percent.
Although other banks have been slow to match
that increase so far, a number of analysts contend
that recent rises in open-market money rates have
virtually assured that the basic rate on blue-chip
loanswill go to at least 11 Vi by theend of the year.
Big Board volume totaled 30.61 million shares,
up from 20.96 million Monday.
