# McCloskey could travel to Pakistan
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-MeHo Park) said yesterday that
whether or not he decides to go to
Pakistan to argue for the release of
Ali Bhutto depends solely on "what is
the best thing to do to insure Bhut
to's survival."
McCloskey said that he will spend
the next several days in Palo Alto
seeking advice before traveling to
Washington on Friday to meet with
officials in the State Department.
Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime
minister, is currently scheduled to be
executed by his successors on a
murder charge many western obser
vers consider unjust. At McCloskey's
request, the ASSU Senate last week
voted in favor of a resolution to offer
Bhutto a guest professorship here to
facilitate the congressman's efforts
to save him.
McCloskey said that the State De
partment has reservations about his
traveling to Pakistan. They feel that
the government there might feel
pressured and execute Bhutto to
prove their independence from
foreign intervention, he added.
However, McCloskey said that
Murataza Bhutto, the prime minis
ter's son, told him that a congres
sional delegation, especially from
the opposition (Republican) party,
could wield much influence toward
freeing the prime minister.

McCloskey said that he will decide
at the end of the month on whether
to go. If he does make the trip, it will
be on Dec. 2 or 3. He added that
timing is important because the
Pakistani Supreme Court is consider
ing Bhutto's appeal. McCloskey said
that the custom in Pakistan is to carry
out executions 12 hours after the
final sentencing.
ASSU Senate Chairperson Peter
Stamos said that there has been
some student objection to bringing
Bhutto here, mostiy centering on
Bhutto's alleged misdeeds while in
office.
According to the July 1978 issue of
Asian Survey, "Bhutto had promised
democracy and delivered dictator
ship." The article accuses him of
"muzzling" the press, "manipulat
ing" the economy for his political
benefit, "generally disregarding" the
nation's laws, and "dismantling" the
judicial system.
The )uly 1977 issue of the same
magazine said that Bhutto practiced
several questionable tactics in the
March parliamentary elections of
that year. The article accused Bhutto
of barring opposition candidates of
press coverage, using his police to
break up rallies, arbitrarily ruling
people off the ballot and arresting
political opponents, including the
man planning to run against Bhutto
in his own district.
McCloskey said that he believes
that it is possible to invite Bhutto to
teach here without condoning his ac
tions while in office. Stamos said the
senate resolution calling for an offer
of a guest professorship merely rec
ognizes Bhutto's experience and
academic qualifications.
Bhutto graduated from Oxford
Law School and taught law at Eng
land's South Hampton University.
McCloskey called him "one of the
premier political figures of the
world."
McCloskey said he has no fears
that any misdeeds by Bhutto will be
condoned if he comes to the United
States. "I can imagine no finer set of
cross-examiners of Bhutto's conduct
than the students here," he said.
In a letter to the Pakistani ambas
sador, McCloskey said he had three
reservations with the trial that con
victed Bhuttoof murderinga political
opponent's father in 1974. First, the

only direct evidence against Bhutto
involved the testimony of one man
who changed his story three times,
said McCloskey. Second, the presid
ing judge publicly commented on
Bhutto's "guilt" outside the cour
troom before conviction, McCloskey
claimed. Third, the prosecution's
case rested solely on testimony
which led to four different stories as
to what had happened, all four of
which were contradicted by ballistic
tests and other physical evidence,
McCloskey said.
McCloskey said that it is "bad pre
cedent" for governments to execute
their predecessors for purely politi
cal reasons and added that bringing
Bhutto here would offer the Pakistani
government a way to save face and
spare Bhutto.
ASSU Sen. Ron Johnson said that
he talked to several hundred stu
dents yesterday as part of the se
nate's new districting plan, and that
all of them appeared to be in favor of
bringing Bhutto here.

facilitate the congressman's efforts
to save him.
McCloskey said that the State De
partment has reservations about his
traveling to Pakistan. They feel that
the government there might feel
pressured and execute Bhutto to
prove their independence from
foreign intervention, he added.
However, McCloskey said that
Murataza Bhutto, the prime minis
ter's son, told him that a congres
sional delegation, especially from
the opposition (Republican) party,
could wield much influence toward
freeing the prime minister.

McCloskey said that he will decide
at the end of the month on whether
to go. If he does make the trip, it will
be on Dec. 2 or 3. He added that
timing is important because the
Pakistani Supreme Court is consider
ing Bhutto's appeal. McCloskey said
that the custom in Pakistan is to carry
out executions 12 hours after the
final sentencing.
ASSU Senate Chairperson Peter
Stamos said that there has been
some student objection to bringing
Bhutto here, mostiy centering on
Bhutto's alleged misdeeds while in
office.
According to the July 1978 issue of
Asian Survey, "Bhutto had promised
democracy and delivered dictator
ship." The article accuses him of
"muzzling" the press, "manipulat
ing" the economy for his political
benefit, "generally disregarding" the
nation's laws, and "dismantling" the
judicial system.
The )uly 1977 issue of the same
magazine said that Bhutto practiced
several questionable tactics in the
March parliamentary elections of
that year. The article accused Bhutto
of barring opposition candidates of
press coverage, using his police to
break up rallies, arbitrarily ruling
people off the ballot and arresting
political opponents, including the
man planning to run against Bhutto
in his own district.
McCloskey said that he believes
that it is possible to invite Bhutto to
teach here without condoning his ac
tions while in office. Stamos said the
senate resolution calling for an offer
of a guest professorship merely rec
ognizes Bhutto's experience and
academic qualifications.
Bhutto graduated from Oxford
Law School and taught law at Eng
land's South Hampton University.
McCloskey called him "one of the
premier political figures of the
world."
McCloskey said he has no fears
that any misdeeds by Bhutto will be
condoned if he comes to the United
States. "I can imagine no finer set of
cross-examiners of Bhutto's conduct
than the students here," he said.
In a letter to the Pakistani ambas
sador, McCloskey said he had three
reservations with the trial that con
victed Bhuttoof murderinga political
opponent's father in 1974. First, the

only direct evidence against Bhutto
involved the testimony of one man
who changed his story three times,
said McCloskey. Second, the presid
ing judge publicly commented on
Bhutto's "guilt" outside the cour
troom before conviction, McCloskey
claimed. Third, the prosecution's
case rested solely on testimony
which led to four different stories as
to what had happened, all four of
which were contradicted by ballistic
tests and other physical evidence,
McCloskey said.
McCloskey said that it is "bad pre
cedent" for governments to execute
their predecessors for purely politi
cal reasons and added that bringing
Bhutto here would offer the Pakistani
government a way to save face and
spare Bhutto.
ASSU Sen. Ron Johnson said that
he talked to several hundred stu
dents yesterday as part of the se
nate's new districting plan, and that
all of them appeared to be in favor of
bringing Bhutto here.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-MeHo Park) said yesterday that
whether or not he decides to go to
Pakistan to argue for the release of
Ali Bhutto depends solely on "what is
the best thing to do to insure Bhut
to's survival."
McCloskey said that he will spend
the next several days in Palo Alto
seeking advice before traveling to
Washington on Friday to meet with
officials in the State Department.
Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime
minister, is currently scheduled to be
executed by his successors on a
murder charge many western obser
vers consider unjust. At McCloskey's
request, the ASSU Senate last week
voted in favor of a resolution to offer
Bhutto a guest professorship here to
facilitate the congressman's efforts
