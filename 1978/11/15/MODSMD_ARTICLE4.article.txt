# Speaker concerned about 'Inner City'
## 
### CARLA NEASEL 
"The inner city is the responsibility
of all the citizens who live there, in
cluding the corporation."
With these opening words, Lynn
Townsend, former chairman of the
Chrysler Corporation, began his talk
on "The Inner City: Who's Respon
sible?" at noon yesterday in Bishop
Auditorium.
The assembled group of at least
200 seemed to listen carefully as
Townsend spoke on what he said was
"the most important job facing the
people of the United States today —
rebuilding and rededicating the
inner city into our sphere."
As the "biggest domestic test of
the strength of the present society,"
cleaning up the inner city is an attain
able goal only when the citizens
"stay in the community and work
hard to solve their problems," de
clared Townsend.
"The world is just too small for
anyone to be able to run away," said
Townsend.
Detroit, home of Townsend and
the Chrysler Corporation, is an
example of what can happen when
the citizens of a community stop
running and begin working as a unit
for social reform, he said.
A coalition called New Detroit, of
which Townsend was chairman in
1972, is a group made up of Detroit
citizens selected by the mayor or
governor. New Detroit operates
under the assumption that "no mat-

ter who you are, or whatyou are, you
have an overriding responsibility to
your city," according to Townsend.
Because of this, said Townsend, it is
possible for people from all walks of
life to work constructively to better
their city.
Townsend said that New Detroit,
which was formed in 1967 after one
of the worst race riots in history, op
erates on a "not very big budget of
nearly one and a quarter million dol
lars." Townsend said that money
comes from 40 to 50 different corpo
rations, and according to Townsend,
the Ford, General Motors and
Chrysler corporations are major con
tributors.
Townsend is presently co
chairman of the Detroit Economic
Growth Committee, a "quasi
public/private" corporation whose
duties are to "assess the economic
situation of the city by looking at the
adequacy of its revenues, the fair
ness of its tax assessments, and the
possibilities for economic growth,"
he said.
Members of New Detroit visit
other cities who wish to set up their
own inner city coalitions.
Townsend spoke at length con
cerning the impact which Chrysler
has on the city of Detroit. "Detroit
and the Chrysler Corporation are
married for life, and there can never
be a divorce," he said.
"Chrysler has 50 to 75 million
square feet of productive floor space
in Detroit, and is the biggest taxpayer
and employer," said Townsend, who
stressed the positive ways the corpo
ration could be effective in the city.
The talk was sponsored by the Bus
iness School's Committee for Corpo
rate Responsibility, a volunteer
group of students who are con
cerned with the responsibilities cor
porations have toward the citizen.
After Townsend had finished his re
marks, there was a brief question
and-answer period.
In response to a query about hous
ing discrimination in Detroit,

lownsend said, "There is no housing
discrimination in Detroit. Maybe in
the suburbs, but not in the city it
self." He said Mayor Coleman Young
is a black, progressively liberal
leader, and that the problem has
been taken on and pretty much
eliminated by the administration.
Townsend repeatedly stressed the
fact that any effort to rebuild and up
grade an inner city must stem from a
"social, personal commitment."
Townsend said he feels the solution
to many problems facing most larger
cities is establishing groups like New
Detroit and other similar commit
tees.

Townsend spoke at length con
cerning the impact which Chrysler
has on the city of Detroit. "Detroit
and the Chrysler Corporation are
married for life, and there can never
be a divorce," he said.
"Chrysler has 50 to 75 million
square feet of productive floor space
in Detroit, and is the biggest taxpayer
and employer," said Townsend, who
stressed the positive ways the corpo
ration could be effective in the city.
The talk was sponsored by the Bus
iness School's Committee for Corpo
rate Responsibility, a volunteer
group of students who are con
cerned with the responsibilities cor
porations have toward the citizen.
After Townsend had finished his re
marks, there was a brief question
and-answer period.
In response to a query about hous
ing discrimination in Detroit,

lownsend said, "There is no housing
discrimination in Detroit. Maybe in
the suburbs, but not in the city it
self." He said Mayor Coleman Young
is a black, progressively liberal
leader, and that the problem has
been taken on and pretty much
eliminated by the administration.
Townsend repeatedly stressed the
fact that any effort to rebuild and up
grade an inner city must stem from a
"social, personal commitment."
Townsend said he feels the solution
to many problems facing most larger
cities is establishing groups like New
Detroit and other similar commit
tees.
"The inner city is the responsibility
of all the citizens who live there, in
cluding the corporation."
With these opening words, Lynn
Townsend, former chairman of the
Chrysler Corporation, began his talk
on "The Inner City: Who's Respon
sible?" at noon yesterday in Bishop
Auditorium.
The assembled group of at least
200 seemed to listen carefully as
Townsend spoke on what he said was
"the most important job facing the
people of the United States today —
rebuilding and rededicating the
inner city into our sphere."
As the "biggest domestic test of
the strength of the present society,"
cleaning up the inner city is an attain
able goal only when the citizens
"stay in the community and work
hard to solve their problems," de
clared Townsend.
"The world is just too small for
anyone to be able to run away," said
Townsend.
Detroit, home of Townsend and
the Chrysler Corporation, is an
example of what can happen when
the citizens of a community stop
running and begin working as a unit
for social reform, he said.
A coalition called New Detroit, of
which Townsend was chairman in
1972, is a group made up of Detroit
citizens selected by the mayor or
governor. New Detroit operates
under the assumption that "no mat-

ter who you are, or whatyou are, you
have an overriding responsibility to
your city," according to Townsend.
Because of this, said Townsend, it is
possible for people from all walks of
life to work constructively to better
their city.
Townsend said that New Detroit,
which was formed in 1967 after one
of the worst race riots in history, op
erates on a "not very big budget of
nearly one and a quarter million dol
lars." Townsend said that money
comes from 40 to 50 different corpo
rations, and according to Townsend,
the Ford, General Motors and
Chrysler corporations are major con
tributors.
Townsend is presently co
chairman of the Detroit Economic
Growth Committee, a "quasi
public/private" corporation whose
duties are to "assess the economic
situation of the city by looking at the
adequacy of its revenues, the fair
ness of its tax assessments, and the
possibilities for economic growth,"
he said.
Members of New Detroit visit
other cities who wish to set up their
own inner city coalitions.
