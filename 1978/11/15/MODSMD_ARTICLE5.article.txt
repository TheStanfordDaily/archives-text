# Chinese scientists studying here hold press conference

### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
"I believe there will be many more scientists and
researchers (from the People's Republic of China)
who will come to the United States" to study in the
country's educational and research institutions, de
clared one of the six Chinese scholars from Mainland
China who will study here this year.
Five of the six scientists who arrived here Saturday
attended a press conference at Tresidder Union to
answer questions about their stay here. Along with
members of the University's U.S.-China Relations
Program, they described the agreement that enabled
them to come here and outlined the purpose of their
visit.
Douglas Murray, a senior research associate here
and director of the U.S.-China Relations Program
explained that the scholars had been nominated by
the Chinese Academy of Sciences for study here.
Individual departments were consulted and had ag
reed to accept them. Under the reciprocal agree
ment, the University will also be sending scholars and
students to China in the near future.
500-1000 Chinese
Murray estimated that between 500 and 1000
Chinese research scholars and students wiil come to
study in the United States this year alone.
The scholars include five men and one woman.
Murray said all of them have spent many years in
teachingand research. Theirages range from 36 to 44.
They praised American achievements in technology
and science and said their purpose is to learn as much
as they can from Americans in those areas. The scho
lars will be studying in the departments of chemical,
electrical and mechanical engineering, computer
science and applied physics.

Communicating through interpreter Andy An
dreasen, a research assistant for the program and an
advanced graduate student in Asian languages, Shih
Tsan-Hsing said his first, and so far only observation
about the United States was that "all our American
friends have been warm and friendly and quick to
help us with our problems."
Intellectual Climate
In response to a question concerning China's intel
lectual climate since the fall of the Gang of Four,'Shih
said that the role of intellectuals has been increased.
He explained that when the Gang of Four ruled
China, they hampered scientists and intellectuals in
their work. This also hampered economic develop
ment, he added.
Today, however, "Mao's policies have realized ap
plication," so that "now, intellectuals in all walks of
life are cooperating with peasants anci workers for the
development of the country," Shih said.
Read English
Although all of the scientists already know how to
read English well, they will begin immediately an
intensive English program in an effort to increase
their listening comprehension and speaking abilities.
After a few months of language training, the scientists
will devote all of their time to study and research.
Shih explained that they are already working out
programs with their respective departments. None
will be working toward a degree, according to Mur
ray.
Shih said that he and his colleagues are planning to
stay one or two years here. The scholars are residing
on campus in Escondido Village.
More Applications
Additional applications from other Chinese scho
lars are expected in january, according to Murray. He

said the reciprocal agreement is "clear, but infor
mal." The University will also be sending scholars and
students to China.
Several faculty research groups are already
scheduled to go to China, Murray said, including
ones which will study agricultural economics, earth
sciences and management.
Political Science Prof. John Lewis and Murray
worked out the details of the exchange in September.
In the press conference, Lewis said the program here
is seperate from a national program set up for the
same purpose, although the national committee
working on such exchanges has been informed of
developments in the University's program all along.

The agreement worked out by Lewis and Murray is
believed to be the first of its kind. Although other
Chinese scholars will be visiting American univer
sities this year, this is the first reciprocal agreement
reached with the Chinese.
Lewis has said earlier that although the exchanges
will be reciprocal, they will probably not be symmet
rical in number. "The Chinese appear ready to send
what eventually could be thousands of scholars and
students to American campuses," he has said.
Exchanges in the social sciences are also being
explored, but will probably have to wait for the com
pletion of foreign language examinations for China's
social scientists some time next year.
