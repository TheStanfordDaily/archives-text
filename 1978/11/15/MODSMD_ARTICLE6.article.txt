# Computers: tools of embezzlement and fraud

### RACHEL BACBY 
Crime, like everything now
adays, is new and improved.
The ingenious technology that
makes automated lunar land
ings possible also makes itpos
sibletobreak the lawfasterand
more efficiently than ever.
Computers, touted as a
boon to modern society, are
increasingly being used as in
struments of embezzlement,
fraud and theft. Because of the
proliferation of computerized
records, anyone who has a so
cial security number or a bank
account; anyone who makes
credit transactions or has fi
nancial relationships with any
large organization, including
the government, is a potential
victim of computer crime.
"Computers are becoming
the vaults for storing money,"
said Don Parker, a computer
security expert at Stanford Re
search Institute International
(SRII). "Current balances, de
bits, and credits are being elec

tronically stored inside banks'
computer systems, so that
what is represented as elec
tromagnetic data equals
money."
Computers are a silent ally,
through which access to
money can be gained mofe
quickly and quietly if the
money were kept in a cash
drawer. This probably provides
an incentive for the potential
lawbreaker to dip into the
computerized till.
Another tempting feature of
computer crime is that it pro
vides intellectual challenge;
the burglar's tools in theft by
computer are a clever mind
and an understanding of the
logical operation and flaws of a
particular processing system,
Parker said.
Salami technique
Perpetrators of computer
related bank embezzlement
often use what Parker terms
the "salami technique" of pil
fering funds. First the perpet

rator programs the computer
to create a hidden debit in an
account. He then has it create a
hidden balancing credit in a fa
vored account from which he
can withdraw the money.
"The salami technique in
volves taking small slices — 12
to 25 cents — from many ac
counts over a long period of
time," Parker said. "Bank cus
tomers notice the shortage but
since it's so small they assume
it's due to their own error or
they just figure it's not worth
worrying about."
Thus, the perpetrator can
embezzle very large sums in
crementally without being de
tected by management. Parker
said the fact that most compu
ter crimes are discovered acci
dentally indicates that much
more is being perpetrated than
detected.
"Computer technology
tends to confound auditors
and managers to the extent
that they are rarely in a position
to detect or prevent computer
based embezzlement" wrote
computer scientist Brandt
Allen in a 1975 Harvard Busi
ness Review article on compu
ter crime. Parker said the basic
problem of detecting ir
regularities in computerized
accounts is that the people
guilty of computer abuse are
often the only ones with the
technical knowledge neces
sary to review their work.
Additionally, it is often
cheaper to let suspected ac
counting irregularities go un
investigated. "Millions of in
structions are fed into com
puters," Parker said. "It's sim
ply not cost effective to search
for the suspected abuse be
cause its like searching for a
needle in the haystack."
Detected, not reported
Even if a computer crime is
detected it is often not re
ported. To date 640 computer
crimes have been reported but
Parker says this is just the tip of
the iceburg. He guessed that
only one of every 100 computer
crimes is reported. "Many
large organizations admit hav
ing a problem," Parker said,
"but they won't disclose the
details."
Banks victimized by
computer-related crimes pre
fer to suffer in silence rather
than have computer security
problems come to public at
tention, Parker said. A primary
reason for this is that banks

fear such publicity will bring
about an increase in their in
surance rates.
In addition to difficulties in
detecting and reporting com
puter crimes, it is often difficult
to effectively prosecute com
puter criminals.
Pursuant to a Department of
justice Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration Grant
(LEAA), Parker and Susan
Nycum, attorney and
chairman-elect of the Ameri
can Bar Assocaition section of
science and technology, are
conducting a study on the in
vestigation and prosecution of
computer crimes.
They are finding that the abil
ity of law enforcement units to
investigate computer crime is
"light years behind the ability
of people to commit them."
"Prosecutors and inves
tigators simply don't have the
technical knowledge neces
sary to investigate computer
crime," Nycum said. Even on
the federal level few pro
secutors understand enough
about electronic data proces
sing to prepare a case that will
stand up in court.
To help investigative units in
overcoming the mystique of
computer technology, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) instituted a course in
computer criminology three
years ago at its agent-training
center in Quantico, Va. The
course has also been offered to
district attorneys and state and
local enforcement officers.
Hard to get evidence
)im Barko, chief of the white
collar crime unit at the training
center, said a major problem
for investigators of computer
crimes is the gathering of evi
dence.
"A computer has never tes
tified against anyone," Barko
said. Thus, in order to know
evidence when they see it, in
vestigators must be trained to
retrieve and analyze computer
records.
But such training does not
remedy the difficulties of suc
cessfully prosecutinga compu
ter crime case. Presenting
technically detailed evidence
to judges and juries "is like
speaking a foreign language,"
Nycum said. "In light of all the
complexities involved, district
attorneys often decline to pro
secute perpetrators of compu
ter crimes."
Even when perpetrators of

computer crimes are prose
cuted and convicted they sel
dom are given sentences com
parable to those imposed on
people convicted of more
common forms of larceny and
usually spend little or no time
in jail, according to a 1977 New
Yorker article. The article attri
butes this to the nonviolent na
ture of the offense and the
sheer novelty of computer
crimes to most judges. Furth
ermore, since nearly all of the
defendants are white-collar
workers they're generally con
sidered good risks for proba
tion.
With the odds heavily
against detection and convic-

tion of people who carry out
computer-related crimes, such
crime pays often quite hand
somely. Parker has found the
average take per computer
related bank embezzlement to
be close to $500,000.
Prevention?
What can be done to prevent
such crimes, or at least to de
tect them efficiently when they
occur? Barko suggests that the
internal security mechanisms
of computer systems can be
vastly improved. "The controls
presently established are
somewhat slipshod," he said.
But Parker insists that com
puter systems will never be
secure "in and of themselves."

He says computer security is a
"people problem — the ans
wer lies in controlling people
in positions of trust."
In his book, Crime by Com
puter, Parker suggests limiting
human access to computer sys
tems and establishing opera
tional and procedural con
straints on the employees that
do come in contact with the
systems. He also stressed the
need for reliable detection
mechanisms and auditing pro
cedures.
Still, all the experts agree
there are no ultimate solutions
to the problems of computer
crime. Indeed, technology has
opened Pandora's box.

Veterans' Day celebrated
Local war veterans celebrated Veterans Day Saturday with a parade in San lose and subsequent
ceremonies in Palo Alto. The Veterans Memorial Building in the background has been used since
World War I. Though the city of Palo Alto condemned the building as an eng
arthquake and fire hazard last summer, veterans hope funds will soon become available with
which to renovate and rehabilitate the building.
