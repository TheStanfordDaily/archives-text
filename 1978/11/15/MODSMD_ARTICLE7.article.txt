# Provides information for students
## Prelaw conference to be held here 
### CHRIS GREENE 
The University will host the
Seventh Annual Pacific Prelaw
Conference tomorrow as "a
chance for us to provide stu
dents with a direct source of
information," said Anne Co
xon, assistant director of the
Academic Information Center.
Almost all accredited law
schools in California will send
representatives to the Stanford
Conference. Many schools
around the nation, including
most of the "Top Ten," will
also send representatives.
The format of the confer
ence allows students the op
portunity togetinformation di
rectly from the representatives
of each school.
"Usually the people who are
representing schools are ad
missions officers," Coxon said,
and they know the relative im
portance of grades, LSAT
scores, personal statements,
and recommendations for ad
mission to their school.
The conference is an oppor
tunity to ask questions about
subjects not usually addressed
in catalogs, such as questions
about the weather or statistics
on placement opportunities
for graduating law students,
Coxon said.
"The kinds of subjective
questions (students ask) are
really helpful when it comes to
"choosing a law school,"
Coxon noted.
Coxon urged all students in
terested in law school to attend
the conference because "this
is really the only time law
schools come to Stanford."
Representatives from ap
proximately 50 law schools will
be in the large lounge of Tre
sidder Union from 10 a.m. until
noon and from 1 to 4 p.m. in
the afternoon. The representa
tives of each school will be at
separate tables with chairs for
students to sit in while asking
questions. There are no formal
presentations during the day.
Representatives respond to in

dividual questions.
Coxon has attempted to at
tract more students to the Stan
ford Conference this year by
advertising in a number of
newspapers at schools on the
Peninsula and in the Santa
Clara Valley. Last year 250 stu
dents attended the conference
here.
The majority of those who at
tend "are students from here
who take advantage of the op
portunity here on campus,"
Coxon said. She indicated law
schools continue to come here
despite the low student turn
out to attract its students.
But she added, "We need to
work on getting students from
other schools. We did attempt
to get posters to as many
schools in a reasonable area"
as possible.
The conference is the best
opportunity for students here
to meet representatives of the
nation's top law schools and
most California law schools,
Coxon said.
An association of prelaw ad
visers on the West Coast spon
sors the conference at each of
four schools. Yesterday the
conference was held at the
University of California at San
Diego. The conference moves
to the University of Southern
California today, here tomorT
row, and ends at U.C.-Berkeley
on Friday.
Willis Shotwell, overall coor
dinator of the four conferences
and director of the Berkeley
conference, said each college
runs the program a little diffe
rently. San Diego holds the
conference outdoors and en
courages prelaw advisers to at
tend. At USC, in the morning
the representatives meet only
with prelaw advisers and ans
wer students' questions in the
afternoon. Both Northern
California conferences are for
students the entire day.
At Berkeley more than 1300
people attended last year's
conference. "We try to make it

available to the schools in the
area," Shotwell said.
"We blanket the campus and
the area around the campus
with signs" to notify students,
alumni, and members of the
Berkeley community not at
tending school but who may be
considering attending law
school, said Shotwell.
Despite the success of the
Berkeley conference, Shotwell
said he is afraid Berkeley may
go the way of the University of
Washington, which dropped
the conference five years ago
for financial reasons.
"Prop. 13 hit us in a big way
here at Berkeley. We've got to
watch our pennies," said
Shotwell. He said he won't
know until April is there will be

funding for the conference
next year.
Shotwell indicated that there
are similar conferences around
the country.

Peninsula and in the Santa
Clara Valley. Last year 250 stu
dents attended the conference
here.
The majority of those who at
tend "are students from here
who take advantage of the op
portunity here on campus,"
Coxon said. She indicated law
schools continue to come here
despite the low student turn
out to attract its students.
But she added, "We need to
work on getting students from
other schools. We did attempt
to get posters to as many
schools in a reasonable area"
as possible.
The conference is the best
opportunity for students here
to meet representatives of the
nation's top law schools and
most California law schools,
Coxon said.
An association of prelaw ad
visers on the West Coast spon
sors the conference at each of
four schools. Yesterday the
conference was held at the
University of California at San
Diego. The conference moves
to the University of Southern
California today, here tomorT
row, and ends at U.C.-Berkeley
on Friday.
Willis Shotwell, overall coor
dinator of the four conferences
and director of the Berkeley
conference, said each college
runs the program a little diffe
rently. San Diego holds the
conference outdoors and en
courages prelaw advisers to at
tend. At USC, in the morning
the representatives meet only
with prelaw advisers and ans
wer students' questions in the
afternoon. Both Northern
California conferences are for
students the entire day.
At Berkeley more than 1300
people attended last year's
conference. "We try to make it

available to the schools in the
area," Shotwell said.
"We blanket the campus and
the area around the campus
with signs" to notify students,
alumni, and members of the
Berkeley community not at
tending school but who may be
considering attending law
school, said Shotwell.
Despite the success of the
Berkeley conference, Shotwell
said he is afraid Berkeley may
go the way of the University of
Washington, which dropped
the conference five years ago
for financial reasons.
"Prop. 13 hit us in a big way
here at Berkeley. We've got to
watch our pennies," said
Shotwell. He said he won't
know until April is there will be

funding for the conference
next year.
Shotwell indicated that there
are similar conferences around
the country.
The University will host the
Seventh Annual Pacific Prelaw
Conference tomorrow as "a
chance for us to provide stu
dents with a direct source of
information," said Anne Co
xon, assistant director of the
Academic Information Center.
Almost all accredited law
schools in California will send
representatives to the Stanford
Conference. Many schools
around the nation, including
most of the "Top Ten," will
also send representatives.
The format of the confer
ence allows students the op
portunity togetinformation di
rectly from the representatives
of each school.
"Usually the people who are
representing schools are ad
missions officers," Coxon said,
and they know the relative im
portance of grades, LSAT
scores, personal statements,
and recommendations for ad
mission to their school.
The conference is an oppor
tunity to ask questions about
subjects not usually addressed
in catalogs, such as questions
about the weather or statistics
on placement opportunities
for graduating law students,
Coxon said.
"The kinds of subjective
questions (students ask) are
really helpful when it comes to
"choosing a law school,"
Coxon noted.
Coxon urged all students in
terested in law school to attend
the conference because "this
is really the only time law
schools come to Stanford."
Representatives from ap
proximately 50 law schools will
be in the large lounge of Tre
sidder Union from 10 a.m. until
noon and from 1 to 4 p.m. in
the afternoon. The representa
tives of each school will be at
separate tables with chairs for
students to sit in while asking
questions. There are no formal
presentations during the day.
Representatives respond to in

dividual questions.
