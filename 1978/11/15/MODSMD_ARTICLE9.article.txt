## Lois Nesbit Trailers ’new experience' 
### 
Tuition went up $400 this year. That was fairly
easy to explain to my parents.
I got assigned to live in Manzanita Trailer Park.
That wasn't.
In fact, I got so tired of trying to explain to
people why I was spending $7000 to live in a
mobile home, that I finally gave up. I would tell
them I was sharing "this apartment-like
thing" with three friends. God help me if any
one ever sees it.
Living in Manzanita does remarkable things to
your perceptions. Our trailer has all the reality
of a stage set for a television situation comedy.
And all the strength and durability of a Wheaties'
box.
I guess the best part of being in the trailers is
that it provides one of those "new experiences"
they promised us when we applied to Stanford.
I've never gotten to live in a development be
fore. The problem with my neighborhood is that
every house is different. You're always in for a
surprise when you walk through someone's
door.
The trailers remove this awkward unpredicta
bility. You can memorize your neighbor's floor
plan without ever leaving your living room.
You'll never have the embarassment of wander
ing down the wrong hallway at a party. The only
variation is those ambitious residents who rear
range the furniture — a disorienting phenome
non, to say the least.
I must congratulate the people who land
scaped Manzanita. Their thoughtfulness defies
imagination. Not only did they provide us with a
four-foot front yard, but they planted it with
tough rubbery little stubs of some dullish green
vegetation. The Manzanita Handbook says
these "ice plants" were chosen not for their
aesthetic qualities, but for their longevity. Well,
they were right about that. I stomp all over the
stuff in my clogs every morning and I haven't
made a dent yet.
The backyard, which we share with the three
other trailers in our cluster, is a 16 x 16-foot
square slab of cement. With a tree in the middle.

Framed all around by the white aluminum siding
of the trailer walls, the courtyard is a study in
inhurnanness and sterility. It has all the warmth
of a hospital operating room.
Inside the trailers you really get a feeling for
Manzanita living. The walls are covered with that
fake wood panelling associated with hardware
store samples of contact paper. The kind no
body buys. The scale of everything in the trailers
is about 7/8 lifesize. The doorways and ceilings
are low. The rooms are cramped. The windows
are small.
The kitchen, with bland mosaic Congoleum
floors (decorator's neutral), inspires visions of
Tupperware parties and Family Circle. It's great
to come in the first day and see the kitchen so
well equipped. We were provided with two ice
cube trays and a predetermined quota of black
ants.
The living room furniture may be the strong
point of the trailer. Vaguely contemporary in
style, it's noticeable for its quantity, if not qual
ity Ours is black vinyl and wood (the only wood
in the whole trailer, I believe), and amazingly
sturdy. So far so good. It's those monstrous gold
Baroque lamps that leave me wondering.
No furniture in the trailer is over three feet
high. This leaves embarassingly huge wall
spaces to be covered. Up goes a motley collec
tion of left overs from your freshman dorms. A
poster of King Tut's mask. 18 black and white
dry-mounted photographs. A Matisse with
enough colors to compete with a box of Crayola
crayons. So much for a cohesive environment.
The best way to survive in Manzanita is not to
take it seriously. Take advantage of what the
trailers do provide. Home-cooked meals. Lots of
small parties. Getting to know your roommates.
And when the year is over you'll discover you've
learned much more — everything from exter
minating ants to using a gas stove. For $7000,
could you ask for more?

Tuition went up $400 this year. That was fairly
easy to explain to my parents.
I got assigned to live in Manzanita Trailer Park.
That wasn't.
In fact, I got so tired of trying to explain to
people why I was spending $7000 to live in a
mobile home, that I finally gave up. I would tell
them I was sharing "this apartment-like
thing" with three friends. God help me if any
one ever sees it.
Living in Manzanita does remarkable things to
your perceptions. Our trailer has all the reality
of a stage set for a television situation comedy.
And all the strength and durability of a Wheaties'
box.
I guess the best part of being in the trailers is
that it provides one of those "new experiences"
they promised us when we applied to Stanford.
I've never gotten to live in a development be
fore. The problem with my neighborhood is that
every house is different. You're always in for a
surprise when you walk through someone's
door.
The trailers remove this awkward unpredicta
bility. You can memorize your neighbor's floor
plan without ever leaving your living room.
You'll never have the embarassment of wander
ing down the wrong hallway at a party. The only
variation is those ambitious residents who rear
range the furniture — a disorienting phenome
non, to say the least.
I must congratulate the people who land
scaped Manzanita. Their thoughtfulness defies
imagination. Not only did they provide us with a
four-foot front yard, but they planted it with
tough rubbery little stubs of some dullish green
vegetation. The Manzanita Handbook says
these "ice plants" were chosen not for their
aesthetic qualities, but for their longevity. Well,
they were right about that. I stomp all over the
stuff in my clogs every morning and I haven't
made a dent yet.
The backyard, which we share with the three
other trailers in our cluster, is a 16 x 16-foot
square slab of cement. With a tree in the middle.

Framed all around by the white aluminum siding
of the trailer walls, the courtyard is a study in
inhurnanness and sterility. It has all the warmth
of a hospital operating room.
Inside the trailers you really get a feeling for
Manzanita living. The walls are covered with that
fake wood panelling associated with hardware
store samples of contact paper. The kind no
body buys. The scale of everything in the trailers
is about 7/8 lifesize. The doorways and ceilings
are low. The rooms are cramped. The windows
are small.
The kitchen, with bland mosaic Congoleum
floors (decorator's neutral), inspires visions of
Tupperware parties and Family Circle. It's great
to come in the first day and see the kitchen so
well equipped. We were provided with two ice
cube trays and a predetermined quota of black
ants.
The living room furniture may be the strong
point of the trailer. Vaguely contemporary in
style, it's noticeable for its quantity, if not qual
ity Ours is black vinyl and wood (the only wood
in the whole trailer, I believe), and amazingly
sturdy. So far so good. It's those monstrous gold
Baroque lamps that leave me wondering.
No furniture in the trailer is over three feet
high. This leaves embarassingly huge wall
spaces to be covered. Up goes a motley collec
tion of left overs from your freshman dorms. A
poster of King Tut's mask. 18 black and white
dry-mounted photographs. A Matisse with
enough colors to compete with a box of Crayola
crayons. So much for a cohesive environment.
The best way to survive in Manzanita is not to
take it seriously. Take advantage of what the
trailers do provide. Home-cooked meals. Lots of
small parties. Getting to know your roommates.
And when the year is over you'll discover you've
learned much more — everything from exter
minating ants to using a gas stove. For $7000,
could you ask for more?
