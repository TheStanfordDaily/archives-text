Most makers of two-wheel
vehicles are into chains How rrifMfe
come Vespa avoids chains on
their mopeds and scooters 9
Is it due to some Freudian avoid- • ojqL
ance of deep-seated fixations, huh 9

Why don't you drop Psych I, before it's too late. Vespa
Mopeds do contain one chain. But it's used only when you pedal. The
belt drive from the engine is more refined, quieter, and cleaner than
a chain. The scooter uses direct drive (like the most expensive motor
cycles) because Vespa is a kind, well-adjusted company.

and Mopeds. Always talking ploys like economy and ecology But what
do you drive yourself 7 l bet you have an expensive, gas-guzzling Italian
sports car, that's what I bet. Car(os (rom NYCC
Dear Carlos.
I myself mostly zip around town on my Vespa Moped. I also happen to
own my grandfather's 1927 Hispano-Suiza limousine, but I had it
stuffed and hung over the mantel in my penthouse.
