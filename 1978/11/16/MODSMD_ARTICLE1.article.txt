# Med Center worker issues complaint

### MONIKA GUTTMAN 
O.V. Hines, an employee of the
Medical Center here, is filing a peti
tion with the Santa Clara County
Superior Court requesting that the
Hospital follow up on its contractual
obligations and allow outsidearbitra
tion on his )uly 18 discharge.
According to Sue Frey, field rep
resentative for United Stanford
Employees (USE), Hines was denied
his right to a "neutral hearing of
ficer."
"It's a confusing situation, be
cause the result of the grievance pro
cedure, which was heard by Ronald
Twomey (directorof personnel at the
Medical Center), was a decision
which reduced Hines' discharge to a
'disciplinary suspension,' " Frey
said. "This means, in effect, that he
was never really fired."
According to the contract, if an
employee is fired, he has the right to
outside arbitration.
"But since he wasn't technically
fired, according to the Medical
Center, he doesn't have this right,"
said Frey. "He's trying to prove that
he was fired and later hired back,"
which would give him the right to
arbitration.
Twomey said Hines was originally
fired.
He was terminated, Twomey said.
"I functioned as hearing officer. I lis
tened to the facts, and I found no
thing in the charges to be incorrect.
"But Hines presented a rather per

suasive appeal, and indicated that he
could be a satisfactory employee.
Thus the discharge of July 18 was re
duced to a disciplinary suspension,"
he added.
Hines then resumed work on Sept.
6.
Hines was fired from his position
as assistant housekeeper on July 18.
According to Hines, this action was
part of a long series of "harassment
and discrimination" against him
from supervisors at the Hospital.
Hines said he had been mopping
the floor next to a group of house
keepers who were carrying on a dis
cussion July 13 when his immediate
supervisor, Karl Hickethier, told him
that he was here "to work and not to
talk."
Hines described a confrontation in
Hickethier's office.
"He told me to git,' " said Hines.
"Since I felt I was being treated like a
slave, I responded 'Yassah.' "
Hines officially was fired for "re
peatedly refusing to follow instruc
tions and insubordination to the de
partment head."
"But even though it was changed
to a suspension, the letters of termi
nation are still in his file," said Frey.
"And he lost nearly $2000 in pay."
Employees are not paid during
periods of suspension, but normally
a suspension is only a few days long,
according to Frey.
"It is a little bit unusual to have a
suspension for that length of time,"

said Twomey.
Twomey said the official record is
never released to people who call to
verify employment.
"We only give them the dates of
employment and the position held
by the employee when he worked for
us," said Twomey. "Therefore his
past disciplinary action is confiden
tial."
Hines is also sending a letter to
Gary Mecklenburg, Hospital ad
ministrator, informing him of con
tinuing harassment now that Hines
has resumed work.
"Now that I am back to work, the

harassment is starting again," he says
in the letter.
Hines maintains that when he was
on sick leave Oct. 31, he brought in a
doctor's letter excusing him for that
day and also for a Nov. 10 follow-up
visit.
But when he returned to work, his
supervisor requested another ex
cuse.
"I called my doctor and requested
another excuse," said Hines. "I
should not have to be subjected to
this kind of embarrassment."
"It's outrageous to have people
embarrassed like that," said Frey.

nation are still in his file," said Frey.
"And he lost nearly $2000 in pay."
Employees are not paid during
periods of suspension, but normally
a suspension is only a few days long,
according to Frey.
"It is a little bit unusual to have a
suspension for that length of time,"

said Twomey.
Twomey said the official record is
never released to people who call to
verify employment.
"We only give them the dates of
employment and the position held
by the employee when he worked for
us," said Twomey. "Therefore his
past disciplinary action is confiden
tial."
Hines is also sending a letter to
Gary Mecklenburg, Hospital ad
ministrator, informing him of con
tinuing harassment now that Hines
has resumed work.
"Now that I am back to work, the

harassment is starting again," he says
in the letter.
Hines maintains that when he was
on sick leave Oct. 31, he brought in a
doctor's letter excusing him for that
day and also for a Nov. 10 follow-up
visit.
But when he returned to work, his
supervisor requested another ex
cuse.
"I called my doctor and requested
another excuse," said Hines. "I
should not have to be subjected to
this kind of embarrassment."
"It's outrageous to have people
embarrassed like that," said Frey.

O.V. Hines, an employee of the
Medical Center here, is filing a peti
tion with the Santa Clara County
Superior Court requesting that the
Hospital follow up on its contractual
obligations and allow outsidearbitra
tion on his )uly 18 discharge.
According to Sue Frey, field rep
resentative for United Stanford
Employees (USE), Hines was denied
his right to a "neutral hearing of
ficer."
"It's a confusing situation, be
cause the result of the grievance pro
cedure, which was heard by Ronald
Twomey (directorof personnel at the
Medical Center), was a decision
which reduced Hines' discharge to a
'disciplinary suspension,' " Frey
said. "This means, in effect, that he
was never really fired."
According to the contract, if an
employee is fired, he has the right to
outside arbitration.
"But since he wasn't technically
fired, according to the Medical
Center, he doesn't have this right,"
said Frey. "He's trying to prove that
he was fired and later hired back,"
which would give him the right to
arbitration.
Twomey said Hines was originally
fired.
He was terminated, Twomey said.
"I functioned as hearing officer. I lis
tened to the facts, and I found no
thing in the charges to be incorrect.
"But Hines presented a rather per

suasive appeal, and indicated that he
could be a satisfactory employee.
Thus the discharge of July 18 was re
duced to a disciplinary suspension,"
he added.
Hines then resumed work on Sept.
6.
Hines was fired from his position
as assistant housekeeper on July 18.
According to Hines, this action was
part of a long series of "harassment
and discrimination" against him
from supervisors at the Hospital.
Hines said he had been mopping
the floor next to a group of house
keepers who were carrying on a dis
cussion July 13 when his immediate
supervisor, Karl Hickethier, told him
that he was here "to work and not to
talk."
Hines described a confrontation in
Hickethier's office.
"He told me to git,' " said Hines.
"Since I felt I was being treated like a
slave, I responded 'Yassah.' "
Hines officially was fired for "re
peatedly refusing to follow instruc
tions and insubordination to the de
partment head."
"But even though it was changed
to a suspension, the letters of termi
nation are still in his file," said Frey.
"And he lost nearly $2000 in pay."
