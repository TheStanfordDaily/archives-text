# British professor describes Puritans
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Over 30 dedicated history
students dutifully sat through a
IV2 hour lecture that discussed
the finer points of 17th century
Puritans and parliaments.
The event occurred last
week when Prof. Conrad Rus
sell of the University of London
spoke here in the History De
partment.
Russell is the son of re
nowned philosopher and
mathematician Bertrand Rus

sell. The younger Russell is on
leave from the University of
London and is a visiting profes
sor at UC-Berkeley this quar
ter.
The paper he presented at
the lecture described the Puri
tans as a political force in Eng
land in the 16205. He discussed
that group of Puritan pro
tagonists who lived in England
during the early 1600s.
Part of the difficulty in iden
tifying Puritans, is that "hardly
ever do you get anyone iden
tifying himself as a Puritan,"
since the label was used in a
derogatory fashion, Russell
said. Because Puritanism was
still developing then, a precise
definition of Puritan" is dif
ficult to devise, he said. Russell
prefers to use a case-by-case
analysis in determining who
fits into the Puritan category.
"One may not be able to de
fine a Puritan, but one can rec
ognize one when one sees
one," he said.
After reviewing many prom
inent political personalities of
the times, Russell concluded
that he cannot "regard the
House of Commons in the
1620s as a significantly Puritan
body."
An instance he cited of a
"Puritan action" was a bill
originating in the British House
of Commons that banned pros
titution ostensibly to prevent
transmission of the plague
after its outbreak. The Puritan
sponsors of the bill were sent
"on a tour of inspection (of
British brothels). The results of
their inquiry are not reported,"
he said.
Russell also said that, "from
time to time," he feels over
shadowed by his father's
achievements. Russell was last
in California when he was two
years old and his father was a
visiting professor at UC-
Berkeley, so he "feels a sense
of continuity."
Russell said he was struck by
American students' "open
mindedness" and their wil
lingness to consider new
academic theories.
Compared to British stu
dents, Amercian students have
better speaking skills and
worse written skills. The two
groups are "about the same,"
he said.
"I am enjoying California,"
he said, "both the weatherand
the people."
