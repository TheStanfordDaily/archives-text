## Gold Country trek — a way to revisit ’panning days' 
### CLAIRE CHAMBERLAIN LOIS NESBITT 
Black Bart, John Marshall and Sutter's
Creek. Unless you remember your fourth
grade California history textbook, these
names probably don't mean much to you.
But maybe they should.
The Gold Rush of 1848 brought miners,
bartenders and "ladies" to the western
•slopes of the Sierra Nevada. More impor
tantly, it guaranteed enough financial in
terest to propel California from a remote
territory into U.S. statehood.
[ Today, all that remains of the once
• frenzied activity of the Mother Lode is a
! string of sleepy towns along State Route (SR)
49. White clapboard churches, wooden
• sidewalks and Victorian homes fronted with
spacious lawns and picket fences continue
to preserve the frontier scene of 100 years
ago.
Ihough spring and summer are the most
popular tim£s to visit the Gold Country, col
orful autumn foliage and thinner crowds
make this a great trip for the Thanksgiving
holiday. And besides, if views of Hoover
Tower and Meyer Library are getting old,
then the winding drive through this historic
countryside is probably the escape you're
after.
With no intention of replacing the big fam
ily dinner on turkey day, this trip is designed
to begin early Friday morning.
From Palo Alto take Interstate (I) 101 south
to Gilroy. At Gilroy pick up SR 152 going east
and stay on SR 152 until you come to Red
Top; in Red Top connect with SR 59 heading
north and continue on SR 59 to Merced. At
Merced get on SR 140 which will take you to
SR 49 and the town of Mariposa, southern
boundary line of the Gold Rush territory.
After three hours in a car chances are

you'll be ready to stop for lunch. A word ol
caution: dining facilities are good but li
mited in quantity. Home of California's old
est country courthouse still in use, Mariposa
thrives today because of its proximity to
Vosemite National Park. Take time to visit
the county museum near the north end of
town — it will give you a feeling for the color
and the characters of the region's past.
The next 12 miles beyond Mariposa on SR
49 curve through oak-studded hills and rol
ling pasture land before coming into Bear
Valley. Once home and headquarters of
Captain John Fremont, Bear Valley is now
little more than a scattering of frontier ar
chitecture and crumbling ruins along the
highway, just north of Bear Valley SR 49 be
gins its steep descent into the canyon of the
Merced River.
After climbing out of the gorge, SR 49 pas
ses through Coulterville, a small community
which functions as the market center for the
neighboring ranchers. The Jeffrey Hotel,
where Teddy Roosevelt once slept, and
Magnolia Saloon are the most impressive
buildings in town. Built in the 1840 sand
handed down through generations, both es
tablishments continue to serve the public.
Jamestown, situated 25 miles and approx
imately 35 minutes northwest of Coulterville
on SR 49, is next on the itinerary. Lining the
main street, an array of antique stores in
brightly painted two-story buildings take
you back in time to the boomtown days of
the Mother Lode. "Rail Town 1897" contains
the shops, sheds and depot of the Sierra
Railroad, lours of the railroad facilities are
offered daily and train rides on an old
steam-powered locomotive operate during
the weekends from April to October. James
town is undoubtedly one of the most pic
turesque of the Gold Rush towns. Plan on

>. nding the remaining daylight hours here.
our miles away on SR 49 lies Sonora,
"queen of the southern mines" and site of
Friday's destination. Settled by Mexican
immigrants in 1848, Sonora has kept pace
with the 20th century without losing much of
the personality of the one-time rowdy min
ing camp. Today, there are many reminders
of the town's flamboyant past, including
what is probably the best collection of Victo
rian homes in the Gold Rush Country. A
walking tour beginning at the Toulumne
County Museum located on West Bradford
Street two blocks north of SR 49 takes in a
dozen of these beautiful old residences and
the state's oldest Episcopal church besides.
Consider scheduling this for Saturday morn
ing before leaving for Columbia.
If you can get reservations, the Spanish
style Sonora Inn or the Cunn House Hotel
offer comfortable lodging in authentically
rustic settings — charming examples of the
hospitality of the Old West.
Restaurants featuring good home cooking
are plentiful; if you're not too tired of driv
ing, the Eprosen House, 10 miles east of
Sonora in Twain Harte, is recommended
locally as a "very satisfying little restaurant."
After breakfast and a tour of the town,
head out of Sonora for two miles on SR 49 to
the junction with Parrot's Ferry Road. Take
Parrot's Ferry Road north to Columbia.
Columbia is the favorite stop of many vis
itors, and its popularity has made it a bit slick
and commercial. But the town, full of au
thentic establishments dating from the
1850s, provides a true glimpse into the reg
ion's glorious past.
Buildings worth seeing are the Columbia
Gazette Office, a replica of the original
featuring displays on early printing; and the
two-story brick Wells Fargo Express Build

ing, built in 1856 and restored in 1975.
Aftera leisurely visit in Columbia, getback
on Parrots Ferry Road north to Vallecito. Pick
up SR 4 west, back to SR 49. You'll hit SR49 at
Angel's Camp, a modern, business-oriented
town.
The drive north on SR 49 takes you past
Altaville, the site of California's first iron
foundry; and through Fourth Crossing, a
former boomcamp. Soon you will arrive at
San Andreas. This town is split between the
modern section on SR 49, and the restored
district east of the main highway on the his
toric bypass. The Calaveras County Museum
in San Andreas, now being renovated, will
soon comprise three buildings and will be
renamed the Mother Lode Learning Center.
A 10-minute drive brings you to
Mokelumne Hill, once the most violent of
the Gold Rush towns. Here, diverse ethnic
groups were in constant strife and murders
were common. The legendary desperado
loaquin Murieta made this his stomping
ground. Today Mok Hill is a faded image of
its wilder days.
Continuing north on SR 49, you will cross
into Amador County and come to the bustl
ing community of )ackson. Kept alive by
lumbering, stock raising and tourism,
lackson has a vital stake in the 20th century.
"Old Town" is the historic center of
lackson, surrounded by winding streets of
fine old houses. The National Hotel in
lackson, reportedly the oldest hotel in the
state, is the place to spend the night. The
saloon on the first floor is frequented on
Saturday nights by a rambunctious crowd of
locals who enjoy downing a few with the
year-round stream of tourists. Rates at the
hotel are inexpensive. Reservations are re
commended.
If you spend the night in jackson, a few

points north of there provide a good trip tor
early Sunday. Four miles outside of town is
Sutter Creek, where visitors still pan for
gold. Leland Stanford made millions off a
$5000 investment in the nearby Union Mine,
and went on to join railroad barons Crocker,
Huntington and Hopkins in building the
Central Pacific.
Though the main street of Sutter's Creek is
lined with fine old buildings and numerous
antique shops, the residential sections are
worth exploring too. The stark white-frame
houses have a distinct New England flavor
and the close up impression is one of a very
clean and tidy 19th century town.
The last stop on the trip is Coloma, which
you should reach in the late afternoon. The
route is slow and winding, eventually de
scending to Coloma in the valley of the
south fork of the American River.
The town is located in Marshall Gold Dis
covery State Historic Park. Gold was first dis
covered there at Sutter's Mill, on the banks
of the river. Today a replica of the mill is
operated electrically, and marked trails lead
to the site where Sutter and Marshall first
saw gold.
Before heading back to the highway, have
lunch at the Sierra Nevada House 111. This
old time establishment offers hearty home
cooked meals. The soda fountain features
extravagant Gold Rush specials such as the
gold strike sundae and the bonanza split.
After this last indulgence in the spirit of
the Gold Country, it's time to start thinking
about returning to real life. The trip home
should take about three hours.
From Coloma, backtrack down SR 49 to
Placerville. At Placerville, pick up Route 50
going west. Take 50 to Sacramento, where it
becomes I-680 south. I-680 will take you to
1-101, which you follow north to Palo Alto.

The Vineyard House in Coloma, Calif, sits on the site of a once prosperous winery. Some of the finest
home-style dinners are served in its dining rooms.
