## Henry Organ Gloom surrounds hiring 
### 
There are clouds of gloom at Stanford that
affect non-faculty staff, irrespective of age, race
of sex. The clouds pertain to hiring, staff de
velopment, promotions, salaries and oppor
tunities for advancement. The clouds are pro
ducts of despair, anger, frustration, apathy, res
ignation, hopelessness, fear, suspicion and in
security, to name only a few. What are some of
the causative factors? They are probably innum
erable, but permit me to offer a new one from
my perspective.
Certainly some of the causes of concern in
these personnel matters are about perceived
and actual unfairness, inconsistency, inequity,
deceit, "old-boy"-ism, half-truths and no truths,
stereotyping, nepotism, racism, sexism and
administrative and supervisorial pomposity.
I believe there is surprise initially and then
disappointment among many new staff
employees after coming to Stanford because
they expect more from an institution of higher
education — the would-be seeker, protector
and distributor of truth and wisdom. As one of
my colleagues has mentioned to me, Stanford is
often complimented for the quality of its faculty,
butthe faculty is not complemented by the qual
ity of its staff, particularly in matters of employ
ment management and sensitivity to interper
sonal relations.
Certainly alert staff cannot overlook the will
ful abdication of professional responsibility and
ethics by the University's own Personnel Office
in these matters. This abdication occurred when
that office agreed to "decentralize" personnel
actions. Translated, decentralization has meant
that schools and departments throughout the
University have been able to do whatever they
wish, and what they have done is often wrong,
or in poor judgment.
Faced with declining responsibility and op
portunities to exercise their professional wis
dom and assistance to the University, personnel
office employees appear to be experiencing
grave morale problems. Purging of employees
in that office, particularly minority, appears to
be the new order of the day. True to its architec
tural heritage, the Old Pavillion continues to be
an arena somewhat like the Colosseum of
Rome, where managers devour employees, and
also allow violations and faculty judgments to
occur throughout the University.
Some personnel officers now turn their heads
as holocausts of irregularities, unfair and in
equitable practices run amok on hi rings, evalua
tions, disciplinary actions, and salaries in the
Colosseum and throughout the University.

One cannot ignore the new grievance proce
dures that become effective last July, authored
by the Personnel Office — the office that sup
posedly protects the rights of the employees as
well as the interests of the University. These new
policies have been endorsed by the Affirmative
Office, and ignored by the University Commit
tee on Faculty and Staff Affairs.
What these new procedures have done is to
unleash rampant and undisguised actions by
supervisors at all levels against their subordi
nates. The message to supervisors from these
new procedures is: "Do whatever you want with
your employees; the Personnel Office will back
you."
Appeals to the Ombudsman's Office receive
genuine concern and prompt attention. The ap
parent disrespect of this office by the Personnel
Office and the University administration in gen
eral, however,means that the Ombudsman's Of
fice's efforts to correct problems are often futile
and frustrating to that office, as well as those
employees seeking its assistance. And the Uni
versity's Affirmative Action Office, with its new
leadership, must become more assertive, and
do more than collect numbers and theorize.
Increasingly, the employment, promotion,
pay and opportunities for people particularly
racial minoriteis, are becoming more a function
of whether they are "liked" by their colleagues,
as well as their immediate supervisors. I have
become aware of at least three evaluatings of
minority employees at Stanford in which con
siderable discussion is given to how they are
perceived and liked by majority employees.
One of the employees has been terminated,
simply because the supervisor did not "like"
her, and the claim that other workers, all major
ity, also did not like her. There must be less of
this, and a return to the basics in personnel
evaluation — job productivity.
In the process of gaining financial equilib
rium, it appears as though the University has
lost, oris losing, its integrity with one of its most
important assets, the staff. Stanford should not
lose sight of the fact that it is a majoremployeras
well as an educational institution. Therefore, I
believe the problems are of such severity that
they command the attention of the Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance (to whom the
Director of Personnel reports) and the Presi
dent. I believe their direct involvement at this
critical stage would be in the best interest of all
staff — women and men, majority and minority,
young and old, exempt and non-exempt.
