## Society is over-regulated 
### 
The paternalists are at it again. The
elitists who believe that theyare Cod'sgift
to mankind to save it from itself have
found a new target — Teddy bears and
jack-in-the-boxes.
The Consumer Product Safety Commis
sion (CPSC) — a bunch of myopic and of
ficious intermeddlers — have proposed
banning 18 categories of toys intended for
children under the age of three. To remain
on the market, the article (or part thereof)
would have to be too big to fit into a cylin
der VU inches in diameter and 2'A inches
in depth. Even having parts that could be
detached — such as buttons on a stuffed
animal — would bring an item within the
ban.
Our power-hungry protectors would
exempt items that have "utilitarian or edu
cational value." Thus children's* clothes
could still be sold. Big of them! Modeling
clay and crayons would not be banned.
How generous. And balloons and marbles
would also be exempt. Aren't our guar
dians wonderful?
Unfortunately, this is only one more
example of paternalistic bureaucrats seek
ing to regulate every part of our lives. Pa
rents are not considered to be capable
enough to judge the risks of toys — only
high-paid ektists in Washington can do so.
Nor is the CPSC the only groups out to
save our children (maybe they should join
forces with Anita Bryant!). The Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) is drafting rules
on advertising directed towards children
— one option being considered is to ban it
altogether. Parents are viewed as being
incapableof regulating what theirchildren
watch and buy; Big Brother must be called
in to assist.

Children are not the only victims of
over-protection. The Department of
Transportation will require the installation
of airbags or other passive restraint sys
tems in all cars by the early 1980's, and Joan
Claybrook, head of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, would like to
require all motorcyclists to wear helmets.
Totally missing from all of these regula
tions is consideration of the most funda
mental principle — human liberty. Indi
viduals have differing measures of values,
and differing evaluations of risks. Each in
dividual should be allowed to weigh the
risks and the costs and benefits; officious
intermeddlers have no right to impose
their personal views on everyone else.
Even when the agencies cannot legally
control our conduct, they will try to do so,
by telling us what to do at our own ex
pense. For example, the Interstate Com
merce Commission (ICC), believing all
American adults to be complete ig
noramuses incapable of moving anywhere
without their assistance, published a little
jewel, "Summary of Information for Ship
pers of Household Goods" (at taxpayers'
expense, of course).
It suggests that before one departs, one
should "sweep house clean" and "arrange
for trash removal." When traveling, the
ICC suggests that you take your driver's
license and your credit cards, and that you
"prepare snacks or picnic basket for the
trip, and a jar of water and washclothes for
cleanups." And, of course, before you
leave the house you should "lock win
dows, and turn off lights."
The booklet goes further, and advises
on the move-in to "get babies' and
toddlers' beds made up first. Older chil
dren can 'settle in' themselves. (But check

on their work, and be lavish with praise for
their efforts — time enough later on to
suggest rearrangements.)" Finally, as the
booklet comes to a nauseating close, you
are told to . . smile! Your new job, new
home, and new community are waiting to
meet you." We really need to pay some
one for that advice!
Unfortunately, the foregoing are merely
examples of the übiquitous regulatory ap
paratus confronting us all. They are only
small parts of a network of highly paid
bureaucrats presiding over a billion dollar
regulatory empire that governs every con
ceivable avenue of human endeavor:
OSHA, FCC, ICC, EPA, FTC, CAB, CPSC,
DOT, and so on. There is no end to them.
We are heading towards bureaucratic
serfdom — where the appointed elite run
the lives of the common man. Work and
play, toys and machines; everything will
soon be regulated by a parasitic oligarchy,
feasting off the labor of everyone else.
Time is short; the citizenry must soon
rebel against this new tyranny, or it may
become too late.
The first step is to defeat the ongoing
regulatory endeavors. But this is not
enough. We need to start a roll-back of
regulation at every level. The parasites
must be kicked out of our lives and our
pocketbooks. Commissions must be
abolished, laws and regulations repealed,
and bureaucrats sacked. And on a massive
scale.
We need to reassert the principle of in
dividual freedom, and dedicate ourselves
to the destruction of the übiquitous reg
ulatory apparatus that confronts us all.
And we need to do so now.
