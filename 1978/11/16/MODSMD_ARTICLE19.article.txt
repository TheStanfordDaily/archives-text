Feminist theme
house never
given chance
Allow me to correct some of
Dean of Residential Educa
tional Norm Robinson's more
egregious misunderstandings
quoted in the Daily (Nov. 10).
First, as one of the participants
of last year's ad-hoc committee
to review the termination of
Simone de Beauvoir (Sdß)
House who is still helping to
piece together its conclusions,
I would like to assure Robinson
that reports of the committee's
death have been greatly
exaggerated.
Robinson's suggestion that
the committee "sort of faded''
because of students on the

committee not showing up
overlooks the two most impor
tant absentees. Had Robinson
himself come to more than two
of the meetings, he would have
realized that Karen Harrison,
Director of the Row Office,
permanently stopped coming
after just one meeting (exclud
ing the first scheduling meet
ing).
Since the most crucial issue
before the committee was
whether Harrison had failed to
communicate with Sdß House
last year, her presence was im
perative for the committee's
deliberations. The final meet
ingswereamongan ASSU Pres
ident, several students, and
three empty chairs reserved for
residential education rep
resentatives.

Finally, Robinson's con
tinued assertions that his deci
sion to drop Sdß House after
less than two quarters remains
unverified by the committee.
Indeed, the evidence at hand
suggests the contrary. If
Robinson's execution of the
nation's first co-ed feminist
theme house were really so
"sound," one wonders why
Robinson needed to delay in
forming Sdß House residents
until finals week of winter
quarter, when time for
ble appeal and review of resi
dential education decision had
essentially run out.
When the committee's
documents are finally pub
lished, I believe that a careful
reading will show that residen
tial education failed to define
or communicate adequately its
expectations to Sdß House.
Moreover, it will be clear that
they neglected its responsibil
ity ot help Sdß House succeed
and, instead, hovered over it
like a vulture, waiting for it to
"fail/*

I've had it with joggers!!!
To illustrate, let me relate an
incident that occurred just to
day.
I was driving on Campus
Drive when I came to the stop
sign at Escondido Road. I
stopped and waited my turn.
Then, just as I was beginning
to proceed into the intersec
tion, a jogger darted from the
sidewalk right in front of my
car. Since he was travelling as
fast as an average bicycle, he
was clearly creating a danger

ous situation by failing to slow
down as he approached the in
tersection. Furthermore, he
indignantly pounded the hood
of my car to indicate that I had
violated his "right of way."
A bicyclist in such a situation
would obey the rules of the
road and stop before proceed
ing into the intersection. A
pedestrian moving at walking
speed would have the right of
way in such a situation. The
jogger was obviously in the
former category, but acted as
if he was in the latter. Because
of their own attitude toward
safety, joggers have made
themselves the pariahs of the

transportation routes — those
belonging neither on the road
nor on the sidewalks. Only
when joggers realize this and
modify their behavior for the
safety of everyone involved
will my opinion of joggers im
prove.

We have a choice
I'd like to believe that Jane
Fonda does not benefit from
the very corporations she says
"manipulate us." There seems
to be a dichotomy in making
millions from the system, liv

ing well within it, and then
having the chutzpah to
critizice it.
We all know some of the
products and services from
corporations, bureaucracies
or universities are inane,
ludicruous and unnecessary.
But we are not passive units,
categorically accepting all this
input. We have a choice. I do
not have to buy "Cycle Three"
or take the "Comics in Cul
ture" course. There are alter
natives to the Dominant Cul
ture, be it enforced by the
corporation or the university.
To talk to us as though we are
uncritical beings is to insult

our intelligence and discrimi
nation.
There are millions who have
taken to the "counter cul
ture." They are aware of the
hype that is perpetuated daily.
They have chosen to assidu
ously avoid that motif. If
Fonda were truly consistant
with her beliefs and pontifica
tions, let her set up alternative
corporations or small busines
ses with her millions. Maybe
then she will have more credi
bility and will see how un
manipulated millions of
Americans are.

I've had it with joggers!!!
To illustrate, let me relate an
incident that occurred just to
day.
I was driving on Campus
Drive when I came to the stop
sign at Escondido Road. I
stopped and waited my turn.
Then, just as I was beginning
to proceed into the intersec
tion, a jogger darted from the
sidewalk right in front of my
car. Since he was travelling as
fast as an average bicycle, he
was clearly creating a danger

ous situation by failing to slow
down as he approached the in
tersection. Furthermore, he
indignantly pounded the hood
of my car to indicate that I had
violated his "right of way."
A bicyclist in such a situation
would obey the rules of the
road and stop before proceed
ing into the intersection. A
pedestrian moving at walking
speed would have the right of
way in such a situation. The
jogger was obviously in the
former category, but acted as
if he was in the latter. Because
of their own attitude toward
safety, joggers have made
themselves the pariahs of the

transportation routes — those
belonging neither on the road
nor on the sidewalks. Only
when joggers realize this and
modify their behavior for the
safety of everyone involved
will my opinion of joggers im
prove.

We have a choice
I'd like to believe that Jane
Fonda does not benefit from
the very corporations she says
"manipulate us." There seems
to be a dichotomy in making
millions from the system, liv

ing well within it, and then
having the chutzpah to
critizice it.
We all know some of the
products and services from
corporations, bureaucracies
or universities are inane,
ludicruous and unnecessary.
But we are not passive units,
categorically accepting all this
input. We have a choice. I do
not have to buy "Cycle Three"
or take the "Comics in Cul
ture" course. There are alter
natives to the Dominant Cul
ture, be it enforced by the
corporation or the university.
To talk to us as though we are
uncritical beings is to insult

our intelligence and discrimi
nation.
There are millions who have
taken to the "counter cul
ture." They are aware of the
hype that is perpetuated daily.
They have chosen to assidu
ously avoid that motif. If
Fonda were truly consistant
with her beliefs and pontifica
tions, let her set up alternative
corporations or small busines
ses with her millions. Maybe
then she will have more credi
bility and will see how un
manipulated millions of
Americans are.

Allow me to correct some of
Dean of Residential Educa
tional Norm Robinson's more
egregious misunderstandings
quoted in the Daily (Nov. 10).
First, as one of the participants
of last year's ad-hoc committee
to review the termination of
Simone de Beauvoir (Sdß)
House who is still helping to
piece together its conclusions,
I would like to assure Robinson
that reports of the committee's
death have been greatly
exaggerated.
Robinson's suggestion that
the committee "sort of faded''
because of students on the

committee not showing up
overlooks the two most impor
tant absentees. Had Robinson
himself come to more than two
of the meetings, he would have
realized that Karen Harrison,
Director of the Row Office,
permanently stopped coming
after just one meeting (exclud
ing the first scheduling meet
ing).
Since the most crucial issue
before the committee was
whether Harrison had failed to
communicate with Sdß House
last year, her presence was im
perative for the committee's
deliberations. The final meet
ingswereamongan ASSU Pres
ident, several students, and
three empty chairs reserved for
residential education rep
resentatives.

Finally, Robinson's con
tinued assertions that his deci
sion to drop Sdß House after
less than two quarters remains
unverified by the committee.
Indeed, the evidence at hand
suggests the contrary. If
Robinson's execution of the
nation's first co-ed feminist
theme house were really so
"sound," one wonders why
Robinson needed to delay in
forming Sdß House residents
until finals week of winter
quarter, when time for
ble appeal and review of resi
dential education decision had
essentially run out.
When the committee's
documents are finally pub
lished, I believe that a careful
reading will show that residen
tial education failed to define
or communicate adequately its
expectations to Sdß House.
Moreover, it will be clear that
they neglected its responsibil
ity ot help Sdß House succeed
and, instead, hovered over it
like a vulture, waiting for it to
"fail/*
