# Rules on rivalry set
## 
### STEVEN WARILA 
As the Big Game draws near, rep
resentatives from Stanford and UC-
Berkeley are searching for ways to
maintain some decorum in the tradi
tional rivalry. In a meeting at Ber
keley this week, representatives es
tablished some ground rules for the
bands, the rooters and most impor
tant, the handling of the Axe.
The meeting, suggested originally
in a letter from Berkeley's Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs Norvell
Smith to James Lyons, dean of stu
dent activities here, was attended by
students representing the bands,
cheerleading squads and vafrious Big
Game committees. The discussion

was led by Mike Murray, assistant
athletic director at Berkeley.
The item discussed most
thoroughly was the Axe. A symbol of
the Berkeley-Stanford rivalry since
1899, the Axe now belongs to Stan
ifcrd, winner by a 21-3 margin in last
year's Big Game. During this
weekend's game, it will be chained
to Stanford yell leaders to avoid the
possibility of it being stolen, accord
ing to Doug Greenfield, a yell leader
here.
'Civilized' exchange
Greenfield said he wants to ex
change the Axe in a "civilized way"
â€” if only to save the life of the yell
leader attached to it at the game's
end. At the conclusion of last year's
game, the Stanford team trium
phantly carried the chained yell
leaders around with the Axe.
Several options were discussed,
but the fate of the Axe was left largely
undecided. However it was agreed
that it should be taken to an area in
front of the visitor's bench for the
exchange.
But Tom Massey, official holder of
the Axe, said he does not think there
will be a need for such an exchange.
Also during the meeting, mana
gers for both bands agreed to keep
their pregame and halftime shows
within predesignated time limits.
There was some disagreement, as yet
unresolved, over the Cal band's de
sire to play first at halftime.
As a matter of courtesy, visiting
bands at football games usually take
the field first. However, Cal's band
manager said it plays first because it
has been "burned in the past" by
visiting bands that play too long. The
Cal band has played first at halftime
since 1966, he added, when the Stan
ford band played for the entire 15-
minute period.
Greenfield expressed his concern
that the rise in popularity of frater
nities may result in more frat-
