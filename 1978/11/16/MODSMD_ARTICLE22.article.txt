## Abortion issue moral test for society 
### 
I have read in the "Opinions" section
of the Daily an article by David Sartoris
entitled, "Abortion best alternative." I
was very impressed with his article and
particularly the maturity and sensitivity
with which he discussed the issues.
Basically he reasons that abortion is a
terrible thing, but if elective abortions
were barred the alternatives would be
"coat-hanger" abortions or unwanted
children subject to neglectful parents. I
can appreciate this viewpoint and even
sympathize with those who hold it.
There is only one problem, and it is a
major one, that has never been resol
ved in my mind. It is that as a society, we
have agreed that to snuff out another
life in order to make our own lives less
complicated is alright. If the ends did
not justify the means for the United
States in Vietnam or for Hitler at
Dachau or for Nixon at Watergate, why
is this issue so different?
Life, we all agree, is sacred. We are
worried about killing the whales, cer
tain species of fish, the bald eagle and
several species of insects. But some
how we have found "valid reasons" for
killing innocent human beings in a
most defenseless state, lean make simi
lar "valid" arguments to those pre
sented earlier by pro-abortionists, for
eliminating the elderly.
They consume food, drugs, federal
and state dollars and a lot of our effort
and yet give nothing in return. They are

a drag to our society and produce all
kinds of problems. Why do we not
eliminate them? Is it because they can
talk back? Maybe the children should
decide whether or not their elderly pa
rents should live. After all, the elderly
can really cramp the lifestyle of most of
us and certainly are unwanted in many
cases. Surely a swift bullet would be
more human than dying of cancer or
old age. It would certainly eliminate a
lot of human misery.
When a child is born into a poor or
otherwise disadvantaged situation, he
should be a symbol of nope, an impetus
to rise to the occasion. Not just for pa
rents and relatives, but for friends and
neighbors as well. Cod provides oppor
tunities through new life for us to grow
individually and as a society. We can
accept these situations as opportunities
or we can reject them because they in
terfere with our lives as we choose to
live them. The way a society treats its
children and elderly is a better sign of
its greatness than any other single
criterion that I can think of.
It is interesting to consider that if a
man punched a pregnant woman in the
stomach and she miscarried, we would
consider this an outrageous act. We
wouldn't even stop to ask whether or
not the woman wanted her baby. Yet
abortion is an outrageous assault on a
completely defenseless baby by the
most hideous means imaginable.
Somehow we have rationalized this act

as better than the alternatives.
The issue of abortion is probably the
single most important issue in this
country today even if most people
don't realize it. Our entire moral life as
a people is at stake. The decision we
make about this issue will determine
what we are.
Whether or not my taxes increase, or
my salary stays the same or corruption
in government increases is of no impor
tance to me as a human being or as an
American, if we are slaughtering the fu
ture citizens of our nation even before
they can emerge from their mother's
womb. We will reap the harvest of this
abomination as our population drops,
our economy plummets and our sense
of decency and dignity disappear.
Is America really the land of the free
and the home of the brave? America
used to be the hope of the world be
cause of its position, since the incep
tion of this republic, on human rights.
We say in the pledge of allegiance to
the flag of the United States that we are
"one nation under Cod" and our coins
say "in Cod we trust." If we were a
people under Cod whom we trust, then
we would not kill our unborn whom
God has a hand in sending to us. It is no
wonder we want prayer stricken from
public schools and the mention of Cod
stricken from our coins.
