# Library grant received

### GAYLE MAYERS 
The University recently re
ceived $228,636 from a $5 mill
ion grant made by the United
States Office of Education for a
project entitled "Strengthen
ing Research Library Re
sources," according to library
spokesman Shere Connan.
The grant was divided between
20 Universities whose libraries
provide national research ser
vices.
Connan, chief librarian of
the Stanford University library
system's Serial Department,
said that Stanford worked with
UCLA and UC-Berkeley in
submitting a joint proposal be
cause cooperation between
libraries is helpful in acquiring
funding.
Connan added that the Uni
versity collaborated with these
two universities because of the
already existing links with the
Berkeley library, and because
UCLA is in the state and with a
similar size system.
Together the libraries main
tain the strongest research col
lection in California, and are a
national resource for research,
she added.
Connan said that the three
libraries collectively received
$675,000. The money was di
vided nearly equally between
the schools, but each univer
sity now will use the funds in
dependently.
Connan said that the Stan
ford library system will use the
money to expand the number
of titles on the machine
reaadable microfiche film.
Currently there are 68,000 titles

available and the expansion
would increase the number of
titles to 168,000. Listings also
would be made available
nationwide, she said.
The expansion would result
in greater access to "retrospec
tive titles" (past issues of titles
no longer received), rare titles
held by the Hoover Institute
and titles in the Business, Law
and Food Research Institute
libraries, Connan said. She
added that eventually it could
include government publica
tion serials.
The combined serial records
in machine readable form at
Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
UCLA will expand from 343,000
to 650,000 titles and these will
be available nationally.
Connan said that legislation
had made money available to
be used by university research
libraries for the next three
years but each grant proposal
will be assessed annually. Stan
ford, UCLA and UC-Berkeley
wrote a three year proposal but
funding for the next two years
will be conditional on the suc
cess of the first year.
Connan said that none of the
Office of Education grant will
be used to support the Guten
burg Express bus between the
Stanford and UC-Berkeley
campuses. The Express now is
funded by a Sloan-Mellon
grant but the Office of Educa
tion grant may have an indirect
effect on increasing the use of
the Gutenburg Express be
cause faculty and students at
the two campuses will be more
aware of both library collec
tions, Connan said.

funding.
Connan added that the Uni
versity collaborated with these
two universities because of the
already existing links with the
Berkeley library, and because
UCLA is in the state and with a
similar size system.
Together the libraries main
tain the strongest research col
lection in California, and are a
national resource for research,
she added.
Connan said that the three
libraries collectively received
$675,000. The money was di
vided nearly equally between
the schools, but each univer
sity now will use the funds in
dependently.
Connan said that the Stan
ford library system will use the
money to expand the number
of titles on the machine
reaadable microfiche film.
Currently there are 68,000 titles

available and the expansion
would increase the number of
titles to 168,000. Listings also
would be made available
nationwide, she said.
The expansion would result
in greater access to "retrospec
tive titles" (past issues of titles
no longer received), rare titles
held by the Hoover Institute
and titles in the Business, Law
and Food Research Institute
libraries, Connan said. She
added that eventually it could
include government publica
tion serials.
The combined serial records
in machine readable form at
Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
UCLA will expand from 343,000
to 650,000 titles and these will
be available nationally.
Connan said that legislation
had made money available to
be used by university research
libraries for the next three
years but each grant proposal
will be assessed annually. Stan
ford, UCLA and UC-Berkeley
wrote a three year proposal but
funding for the next two years
will be conditional on the suc
cess of the first year.
Connan said that none of the
Office of Education grant will
be used to support the Guten
burg Express bus between the
Stanford and UC-Berkeley
campuses. The Express now is
funded by a Sloan-Mellon
grant but the Office of Educa
tion grant may have an indirect
effect on increasing the use of
the Gutenburg Express be
cause faculty and students at
the two campuses will be more
aware of both library collec
tions, Connan said.
The University recently re
ceived $228,636 from a $5 mill
ion grant made by the United
States Office of Education for a
project entitled "Strengthen
ing Research Library Re
sources," according to library
spokesman Shere Connan.
The grant was divided between
20 Universities whose libraries
provide national research ser
vices.
Connan, chief librarian of
the Stanford University library
system's Serial Department,
said that Stanford worked with
UCLA and UC-Berkeley in
submitting a joint proposal be
cause cooperation between
libraries is helpful in acquiring
funding.
Connan added that the Uni
