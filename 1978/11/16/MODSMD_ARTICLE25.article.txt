# Campus branch rents 6500 boxes
## Stanford Post Office: 45,000 letters daily 
### STEVE BROWN 
Ever wonder how your Na
tional Lampoon and Aunt Emi
ly's cookies find their way into
your hands? The two items are
most likely among the 45,000
parcels and letters that pass
through the Stanford Post Of
fice each weekday and Satur
day.
First-class mail arrives by
truck at 5:30, 6, and 7 in the
morning. Already grouped in
Palo Alto by box number sec
tions and delivery routes, the
mail is further sorted here by
individual boxes and street ad
dresses.
Twelve carriers make de
liveries full-time in the Stan
ford area to row houses,
businesses, residents and the

University. All first-class mail is
placed in the post-office boxes
before 9 a.m. by four box
clerks. At 1 in the afternoon,
packages and magazines ar
rive, and during the rest of the
day the clerks add either the
parcels or pink slips for over
sized parcels to the boxes.
Crothers Memorial Hall and
all of Stern Hall except Donner
are the only dormitories with
in-house mail delivery. Don
ner's boxes were removed this
summer.
Post office manager Ron
Sodlink explained the boxes
were "so badly damaged by
students that they just took
them (the boxes) out. Con
sequently, those students have
to rent boxes if they want their

The yearly charge for stan
dard boxes at all Palo Alto post
offices was increased 25 per
cent in June — from $16 tos2o.
Increased labor costs were to
blame, according to Sodlink.
Sodlink said he believes that
rates still compare favorably
with other cities, whose rates
vary from $16 in Berkeley to $28
in San Francisco.
Most students have no alter
native to renting a post office
box, Sodlink admitted, "unless
you have permission from
whatever department you're
majoring in to have it delivered
to your department. Then it's
up to them to do the forward
ing."
Except for most packages,

any mail addressed to dor
mitories is routinely sent to the
registrar's office where mailing
addresses are kept.
A record number of boxes
are being used this year by stu
dents, faculty and businesses,
and only 400 of 6980 are vac
ant. All of the larger boxes,
which range up to 11 inches by
12 inches and rent for $80 a
year, are rented.
Referring to a common
complaint by students that
they must rent a different box
each fall, Sodlink said "the
students, when they leave for
the summer, fill out a change
of address card and they don't
note in the lower right-hand
corner that it's permanent, and
the box is closed."
If they make this distinction
on the card and pay in advance
forthe next year, then they can
keep it indefinitely.
"Some boxes," Sodlink said,
"have been in families for 12 to
14 years as they were passed on
from brother to sister."

One of the nearly 45,000 pieces of mail handled daily by the Stanford Post Office lies ready for a lucky
box renter. On other days, only a cold, empty box will await a lonely, news-starved student.

with other cities, whose rates
vary from $16 in Berkeley to $28
in San Francisco.
Most students have no alter
native to renting a post office
box, Sodlink admitted, "unless
you have permission from
whatever department you're
majoring in to have it delivered
to your department. Then it's
up to them to do the forward
ing."
Except for most packages,

any mail addressed to dor
mitories is routinely sent to the
registrar's office where mailing
addresses are kept.
A record number of boxes
are being used this year by stu
dents, faculty and businesses,
and only 400 of 6980 are vac
ant. All of the larger boxes,
which range up to 11 inches by
12 inches and rent for $80 a
year, are rented.
Referring to a common
complaint by students that
they must rent a different box
each fall, Sodlink said "the
students, when they leave for
the summer, fill out a change
of address card and they don't
note in the lower right-hand
corner that it's permanent, and
the box is closed."
If they make this distinction
on the card and pay in advance
forthe next year, then they can
keep it indefinitely.
"Some boxes," Sodlink said,
"have been in families for 12 to
14 years as they were passed on
from brother to sister."

One of the nearly 45,000 pieces of mail handled daily by the Stanford Post Office lies ready for a lucky
box renter. On other days, only a cold, empty box will await a lonely, news-starved student.
Ever wonder how your Na
tional Lampoon and Aunt Emi
ly's cookies find their way into
your hands? The two items are
most likely among the 45,000
parcels and letters that pass
through the Stanford Post Of
fice each weekday and Satur
day.
First-class mail arrives by
truck at 5:30, 6, and 7 in the
morning. Already grouped in
Palo Alto by box number sec
tions and delivery routes, the
mail is further sorted here by
individual boxes and street ad
dresses.
Twelve carriers make de
liveries full-time in the Stan
ford area to row houses,
businesses, residents and the

University. All first-class mail is
placed in the post-office boxes
before 9 a.m. by four box
clerks. At 1 in the afternoon,
packages and magazines ar
rive, and during the rest of the
day the clerks add either the
parcels or pink slips for over
sized parcels to the boxes.
Crothers Memorial Hall and
all of Stern Hall except Donner
are the only dormitories with
in-house mail delivery. Don
ner's boxes were removed this
summer.
Post office manager Ron
Sodlink explained the boxes
were "so badly damaged by
students that they just took
them (the boxes) out. Con
sequently, those students have

The yearly charge for stan
dard boxes at all Palo Alto post
offices was increased 25 per
cent in June — from $16 tos2o.
Increased labor costs were to
blame, according to Sodlink.
Sodlink said he believes that
rates still compare favorably
with other cities, whose rates
vary from $16 in Berkeley to $28
in San Francisco.
