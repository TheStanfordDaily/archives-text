# Cardentry watches business school books
## New library security system installed 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
A new security system enti
tled Cardentry has been instal
led at the J. Hugh )ackson Lib
rary in the Graduate School of
Business here. An innovation
on this campus, Cardentry is
designed to replace human
guards with computerized
mechanization.
Frequent library users now
pay a $2.00 registration fee to
obtain a white pass which re
sembles a credit card. To enter
the library, the card-holder in
serts the plastic card into an au
tomated reader located near
the turnstile. People without
passes must show identifica
tion to the portal monitor.
Martha Ashmon, director of

reader services at Jackson, sur
veyed Business School stu
dents last year for their reac
tions to library policy and de
sign. She said she discovered
what she called "a latent
animosity" expressed toward
the inconveniences reated by
the ID and back-pack inspec
tion.
Ashmon researched the pos
sibilities of employing a
technologically-controlled
procedure for entrance and
exit. Ultimately, the library
purchased its Cardentry device
for about $4000.
lackson is classified as a
"coordinate" library, which
means that it receives no
budget from the University lib
rary fund, Ashmon said. The
expenses for the new de
velopment are incurred by this
year's 619 MBA candidates,
aided partially by the elimina
tion of one night-monitor's
salary.
Jackson, which was estab
lished in 1933, is now an open
stack library, containing more
than 200,000 catalogued items.
Check-out privileges are li
mited to University faculty,
staff, students and spouses, al
though affiliate corporation
members of the Business
School can use reference mate
rial in the library.
As the average business
book costs $20, with some
running as high as $300 a piece,

restricted access is necessary
to protect resources from the
ravages of over-use, abusive
treatment and theft, Ashmon
said.
Cardenty — modeled after a
similar checking apparatus
used by Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART),- Varian Laboratories
and the Bookstore — compiles
statistical lists from the coded
information printed on the
cards. Each card is punched
with eight letters, referring to
Jackson Library, and one of 16
different categories of user
classifications, such as MBA
students, economics
graduates and under
graduates.
By freeing monitors from
compiling such lists, Carden
try, according to monitor Dick
Newberger, allows the circula
tion staff time to perform other
duties.
Jackson employees are also
in the process of completing a
new exit technique. An elec
tronic surveillance unit has
aleady been constructed at the
door. As soon as sensors have
been implanted in all the
books, library outflow will not
be hindered by the investiga
tion of packs and bags,
Ashmon said.
Instead, to insure adherence
to normal check-out proce
dures, borrowers will hand
lackson Library books to the
guard before passing through

the gate. However, a hidden
book will trigger an alarm and
lock the turnstile on the offen
der.
Of the 2000 cards originally
available, 1300 have been dis
tributed so far. The initial $2
expenditure will be reim
bursed upon safe return of the
card at the end of the year, but
for lost or mutilated cards
there will be a $5 fine.
User response to this service
intended fortheirconvenience
has been mixed. Many stu
dents were unfamiliar with the
system at first, students said.
Ashmon pointed out the
necessity of an adjustment
period and reported that she
has been receiving letters from
"all over the country" request
ing detailed information on
Cardentry.
Director Peter Stangle of the
Medical School Library said he
is not now interested in this
type of entrance procedure.
The Med Library has used a
similar book security device,
which he termed "more
democratic" than traditional
pack-searching methods, for
the past four years.
J. Myron Jacobstein, director
of the Law Library said he was
not planning to install a more
stringent monitoring system.
Since all traffic funnels through
one entrance-exit, he said that
the circulation staff could read
ily spot non-law students.
