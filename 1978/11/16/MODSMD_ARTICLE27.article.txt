## bob dylan/brad brockbank Proving it all night 
### 
Bob Dylan is not merely a
musician. He is a philosophy —
a way of life.
And for 13,000-plus at the
Oakland Coliseum Friday,
Dylan spent two and a half
hours proving that he is still
one of the most innovative
forces in rock today.
His band walked on stage 30
minutes late — though no one
really cared — and broke into
the instrumental "My Back
Pages." Two minutes into the
song, Dylan strolled on stage
donned in white pants, a white
silk shirt and a leather jacket.
Looking as if he hadn't shaved
effectively and hadn't had a
haircut in a while, he pre
sented the image of the '70s
version of his '60s radical self.

Opening with "Hey, Mr.
Tambourine Man," Dylan
made it quickly obvious that
the " 70s version of the '60s"
was not going to be limited to
his appearance.
As the evening progressed,
Dylan played a "Greatest Hits"
selection of songs from the
'60s, but none of them resem
bled, in melody or tempo, the
original versions.
Dylan showed the audience
that there's more to a song
than the way it's sung. In gen
eral, Dylan seemed to switch
most of his classics to the op
posite tempo. After "Tam
bourine Man," he delivered a
speeded up version of "Shelter
From the Storm" and "It's All
Over Now."

Keeping the audience off
guard, Dylan switched to a
slower, more moving version
of "Tangled Up in Blue," then
took the audience into the dis
tant past, dredging upan excel
lent version of "Ballad of a Thin
Man."
From the Band's Last Waltz
album, Dylan played a similar
version of "I Don't Believe Vou
(She Acts Like We Never Have
Met)."
On their feet
The opening chords of the
next number brought most of
the audience to its feet. As one
entranced fan put it, " 'Like A
Rolling Stone' is the most sig
nificant song the '60s ever pro
duced."
While I was still collecting
baseball cards, those words
were defining freedom for a
generation.
I he rest of the concert took
off from there. Dylan only
played three songs from his
latest album Street Legal, in
cluding "Changing of the
Guards" which was his sole
encore.
New band
The most striking difference
about Dylan this year is his
band. He has created, through
the help of nearly a dozen

talented musicians, a total
hand concept. The group is
tight and well practiced. The
background vocals are a
stabilizing contrast to Dylan's
harsh, though well controlled,
lyricizing. Steve Douglas
played a number of outstand
ing solos on the saxophones
and flute and at times followed
Dylan's kinetic melodies note
for note.
On ' Masters of War," lead
guitarist Billy Cross soloed bril
liantly but the most impressive
member of Dylan's band is
David Mansfield, whose
consistently strong vio
lin and mandolin wound in and
around Dylan's vocals very
well. His amazing solo on "All
Along the Watchtower" was so
frenzied that Mansfield left for
a breath of air after he had
finished.
It's all right
"It's All Right, Ma" was Dy
lan's next-to-last song and was
so well performed that the au
dience rushed the stage mid
way through the piece. With
screaming fans backed up all
the aisles, Dylan announced
that he had one more song,
wished the mob of people
goodnight and broke into
"Forever Young."
And, as he had begun the
evening, Dylan strolled
offstage as his band performed
the remaining few minutes of
the song.
Now a legend
Here was Dylan — once a
rebel — now a legend basking
in a new morality he helped to
create. Here were his fans —
once outcasts and "angry
youths" — now thanking the
spokesman for an entire gen
eration.
