## A 						look at new jazz releases 
### 
Patrice
Patrice Rushen
Elektra Records
I can rarely listen to albums of this sort all the
way through without moving to put something
else on the turntable. Because of the respect I
have for Patrice Rushen's ability I restrained my
urge this time.
The back cover of this album features a photo
of a grand piano and an acoustic guitar — in
terestingly the back cover is one of the few
places on the album they are found. The music
itself is the same sort of funk-disco conglomera
tion that has been flooding the market in recent
years. The music is highly electric and very
over-produced; the strings and the background
vocals are pure maple syrup designed to make
the music slip through one ear and out the
other.
What happened to the talented Patrice
Rushen of a few years back — the one who
graced the albums of Hubert Laws and ]ean-Luc
Ponty? Her first album, Before the Dawn was
electricand funky, but still very good; the music
was engaging, if not profound, and the solos
were charged. The new release has no solos to
speak of and only a steady rhythm to recom
mend it. Like so many other jazz stars Rushen
has attempted to become a vocalist; here she
has at least been more successful than most
others (Roy Ayers, Ronnie Laws, etc.); her voice
is strong enough to carry a song to the end
without noticeable flaws. That, combined with
an occasional good chord change, puts this
album a half-step above frisbee material.
Open Air Suit
Air
Novus
I find it personally reassuring that the same
label (Arista) which produces Barry Manilow
also goes to the trouble of featuring artists such
as Air. Arista, in fact, is rapidly becoming the
most important label in avant-garde jazz. In ad
dition to Air they have released albums by
people such as Ornette Coleman, Muhal
Richard Abrams, Archie Shepp and others.
The latest Air release is one of the more in
teresting albums to come from the avant-garde
in recentyears, Air, which iscomprised of Henry
Threadgill, Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall,
caused quite a stir several months back with
their appearance on Wildflowers, a touted an
thology of the latest in the New York'avant
garde. At that time Air was in the unusual posi
tion of being critically acclaimed but not having
a recording contract.
Since that time Arista has moved in to record
them, much to the good fortune of jazz fans.
Like several other modern jazz groups, Air is
moving towards a true group conception of
music. McCall, the drummer, has as much im
portance in determining the flow of the music as
does the reed player Threadgill. The traditional
jazz separation of soloist and accompanist is
seriously threatened in their music — some
thing is doubtless lost yet a good deal is gained.
The change is certainly fortuitious when one
considers the considerable talent of McCall as a
drummer and Hopkins as a bassist.
This is to take nothing away from the ability of
reed player Threadgill. His playing is versatile —

on this album he plays tenor sax, alto sax,
baritone sax and tlute — the multiplicity of in
struments serves as an invaluable asset to a
group which otherwise might fall into a boring
and repetitious mold. The difficulty of forming a
group without a harmonic instrument is great.
Only by their individual virtuosity and their abil
ity in group interaction have the members of Air
succeeded so well.
Lifea Blines
Muhal Abrams
Novus
Abrams is a talented pianist whose playing of
|azz stretches from the ancient Maple Leaf Rag to
be-bop (Cherokee) to the modern (his work
with Anthony Braxton and the AACM). His latest
release, Lifea Blines, leaves much to be desired.
Abrams is, above all, deeply imbued with a
sense of tradition; yet he has nonetheless al
ways pushed himself on to new grounds and
new forms of expression. His latest album does
have the virtue (perhaps I should say the "qual
ity") of being different, but too often ex
perimentation breaksdown into simple novelty.
The "jive" conversation which is carried on
throughout the title track becomes almost
ludicrous, serving only to break the monotony
of the music.
The album does feature one gem in Abram's
composition "Bud P." The song is dedicated to
Bud Powell, the founder of modern jazz piano,
although the music bears little resemblance to
Powell's streamlined virtuosity. Here Abram's
group creates vortex of sound which achieves
the hypnotic effect that this type of music de
mands. Elsewhere Abram's music never grows
beyond the two star level.
Pre-Rahsaan
Roland Kirk
Prestige
I his reissue is a valuable addition to anyone's
jazz collection if only for the inclusion of the
classic Jaki Byard/Roland Kirk date. This session,
held almost a decade before Kirk's death, ranks
with his very best performances. The other half
of the album is devoted to an unmemorable
session with organist lack McDuff.
Byard is an East Coast legend who rarely tours
or records. I caught him this summer at the
Keystone Korner for his first California appear
ance in over a dozen years. In a sentence: the
legends are true; Byard is one of the greatest
technicians that jazz piano has known;
moreover, he can play in any style with equal
fluency (which in his case is the very finest).
Ihe original release of this album has long
been one of my favorite albums; hopefully the
re-release will give it the exposure it always de
served. Kirk's clarinet work on "Shine on Me" is
one of his greatest solos — the warmth, the
exuberance, the spirit of Dixieland really shines
through here. Elsewhere Kirk and Byard dip into
be-bop (a great version of "Parisian
Thoroughfare"), swing and several brands of
dissonance.
The other session, with McDuff, fails to co
here. Kirk worked well with organists through
out his brief career; yet this date failed to
materialize into anything of note. Still the
Byard-Kirk session easily puts this disc into the
five star range.

thology of the latest in the New York'avant
garde. At that time Air was in the unusual posi
tion of being critically acclaimed but not having
a recording contract.
Since that time Arista has moved in to record
them, much to the good fortune of jazz fans.
Like several other modern jazz groups, Air is
moving towards a true group conception of
music. McCall, the drummer, has as much im
portance in determining the flow of the music as
does the reed player Threadgill. The traditional
jazz separation of soloist and accompanist is
seriously threatened in their music — some
thing is doubtless lost yet a good deal is gained.
The change is certainly fortuitious when one
considers the considerable talent of McCall as a
drummer and Hopkins as a bassist.
This is to take nothing away from the ability of
reed player Threadgill. His playing is versatile —

on this album he plays tenor sax, alto sax,
baritone sax and tlute — the multiplicity of in
struments serves as an invaluable asset to a
group which otherwise might fall into a boring
and repetitious mold. The difficulty of forming a
group without a harmonic instrument is great.
Only by their individual virtuosity and their abil
ity in group interaction have the members of Air
succeeded so well.
Lifea Blines
Muhal Abrams
Novus
Abrams is a talented pianist whose playing of
|azz stretches from the ancient Maple Leaf Rag to
be-bop (Cherokee) to the modern (his work
with Anthony Braxton and the AACM). His latest
release, Lifea Blines, leaves much to be desired.
Abrams is, above all, deeply imbued with a
sense of tradition; yet he has nonetheless al
ways pushed himself on to new grounds and
new forms of expression. His latest album does
have the virtue (perhaps I should say the "qual
ity") of being different, but too often ex
perimentation breaksdown into simple novelty.
The "jive" conversation which is carried on
throughout the title track becomes almost
ludicrous, serving only to break the monotony
of the music.
The album does feature one gem in Abram's
composition "Bud P." The song is dedicated to
Bud Powell, the founder of modern jazz piano,
although the music bears little resemblance to
Powell's streamlined virtuosity. Here Abram's
group creates vortex of sound which achieves
the hypnotic effect that this type of music de
mands. Elsewhere Abram's music never grows
beyond the two star level.
Pre-Rahsaan
Roland Kirk
Prestige
I his reissue is a valuable addition to anyone's
jazz collection if only for the inclusion of the
classic Jaki Byard/Roland Kirk date. This session,
held almost a decade before Kirk's death, ranks
with his very best performances. The other half
of the album is devoted to an unmemorable
session with organist lack McDuff.
Byard is an East Coast legend who rarely tours
or records. I caught him this summer at the
Keystone Korner for his first California appear
ance in over a dozen years. In a sentence: the
legends are true; Byard is one of the greatest
technicians that jazz piano has known;
moreover, he can play in any style with equal
fluency (which in his case is the very finest).
Ihe original release of this album has long
been one of my favorite albums; hopefully the
re-release will give it the exposure it always de
served. Kirk's clarinet work on "Shine on Me" is
one of his greatest solos — the warmth, the
exuberance, the spirit of Dixieland really shines
through here. Elsewhere Kirk and Byard dip into
be-bop (a great version of "Parisian
Thoroughfare"), swing and several brands of
dissonance.
The other session, with McDuff, fails to co
here. Kirk worked well with organists through
out his brief career; yet this date failed to
materialize into anything of note. Still the
Byard-Kirk session easily puts this disc into the
five star range.

Patrice Rushen
Elektra Records
I can rarely listen to albums of this sort all the

have for Patrice Rushen's ability I restrained my
urge this time.
The back cover of this album features a photo
of a grand piano and an acoustic guitar — in
terestingly the back cover is one of the few
places on the album they are found. The music
itself is the same sort of funk-disco conglomera
tion that has been flooding the market in recent
years. The music is highly electric and very
over-produced; the strings and the background
vocals are pure maple syrup designed to make
the music slip through one ear and out the
other.
What happened to the talented Patrice
Rushen of a few years back — the one who
graced the albums of Hubert Laws and ]ean-Luc
Ponty? Her first album, Before the Dawn was
electricand funky, but still very good; the music
was engaging, if not profound, and the solos
were charged. The new release has no solos to
speak of and only a steady rhythm to recom
mend it. Like so many other jazz stars Rushen
has attempted to become a vocalist; here she
has at least been more successful than most
others (Roy Ayers, Ronnie Laws, etc.); her voice
is strong enough to carry a song to the end
without noticeable flaws. That, combined with
an occasional good chord change, puts this
album a half-step above frisbee material.

group creates vortex of sound which achieves
the hypnotic effect that this type of music de
mands. Elsewhere Abram's music never grows
beyond the two star level.
Pre-Rahsaan
Roland Kirk
Prestige
I his reissue is a valuable addition to anyone's
jazz collection if only for the inclusion of the
classic Jaki Byard/Roland Kirk date. This session,
held almost a decade before Kirk's death, ranks
with his very best performances. The other half
of the album is devoted to an unmemorable
session with organist lack McDuff.
Byard is an East Coast legend who rarely tours
or records. I caught him this summer at the
Keystone Korner for his first California appear
ance in over a dozen years. In a sentence: the
legends are true; Byard is one of the greatest
technicians that jazz piano has known;
moreover, he can play in any style with equal
fluency (which in his case is the very finest).
Ihe original release of this album has long
been one of my favorite albums; hopefully the
re-release will give it the exposure it always de
served. Kirk's clarinet work on "Shine on Me" is
one of his greatest solos — the warmth, the
exuberance, the spirit of Dixieland really shines
through here. Elsewhere Kirk and Byard dip into
be-bop (a great version of "Parisian
Thoroughfare"), swing and several brands of
dissonance.
The other session, with McDuff, fails to co
here. Kirk worked well with organists through
out his brief career; yet this date failed to
materialize into anything of note. Still the
Byard-Kirk session easily puts this disc into the
five star range.
Patrice
Patrice Rushen
Elektra Records
I can rarely listen to albums of this sort all the
way through without moving to put something
else on the turntable. Because of the respect I
have for Patrice Rushen's ability I restrained my
urge this time.
The back cover of this album features a photo
of a grand piano and an acoustic guitar — in
terestingly the back cover is one of the few
places on the album they are found. The music
itself is the same sort of funk-disco conglomera
tion that has been flooding the market in recent
years. The music is highly electric and very
over-produced; the strings and the background
vocals are pure maple syrup designed to make
the music slip through one ear and out the
other.
What happened to the talented Patrice
Rushen of a few years back — the one who
graced the albums of Hubert Laws and ]ean-Luc
Ponty? Her first album, Before the Dawn was
electricand funky, but still very good; the music
was engaging, if not profound, and the solos
were charged. The new release has no solos to
speak of and only a steady rhythm to recom
mend it. Like so many other jazz stars Rushen
has attempted to become a vocalist; here she
has at least been more successful than most
others (Roy Ayers, Ronnie Laws, etc.); her voice
is strong enough to carry a song to the end
without noticeable flaws. That, combined with
an occasional good chord change, puts this
album a half-step above frisbee material.
Open Air Suit
Air
Novus
I find it personally reassuring that the same
label (Arista) which produces Barry Manilow
also goes to the trouble of featuring artists such
as Air. Arista, in fact, is rapidly becoming the
most important label in avant-garde jazz. In ad
dition to Air they have released albums by
people such as Ornette Coleman, Muhal
Richard Abrams, Archie Shepp and others.
The latest Air release is one of the more in
teresting albums to come from the avant-garde
in recentyears, Air, which iscomprised of Henry
Threadgill, Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall,
caused quite a stir several months back with
their appearance on Wildflowers, a touted an
thology of the latest in the New York'avant
garde. At that time Air was in the unusual posi
tion of being critically acclaimed but not having
a recording contract.
Since that time Arista has moved in to record
them, much to the good fortune of jazz fans.
Like several other modern jazz groups, Air is
moving towards a true group conception of
music. McCall, the drummer, has as much im
portance in determining the flow of the music as
does the reed player Threadgill. The traditional
jazz separation of soloist and accompanist is
seriously threatened in their music — some
thing is doubtless lost yet a good deal is gained.
The change is certainly fortuitious when one
considers the considerable talent of McCall as a
drummer and Hopkins as a bassist.
This is to take nothing away from the ability of
reed player Threadgill. His playing is versatile —

on this album he plays tenor sax, alto sax,
baritone sax and tlute — the multiplicity of in
struments serves as an invaluable asset to a
group which otherwise might fall into a boring
and repetitious mold. The difficulty of forming a
group without a harmonic instrument is great.
Only by their individual virtuosity and their abil
ity in group interaction have the members of Air
succeeded so well.
Lifea Blines
Muhal Abrams
Novus
Abrams is a talented pianist whose playing of
|azz stretches from the ancient Maple Leaf Rag to
be-bop (Cherokee) to the modern (his work
with Anthony Braxton and the AACM). His latest
release, Lifea Blines, leaves much to be desired.
Abrams is, above all, deeply imbued with a
sense of tradition; yet he has nonetheless al
ways pushed himself on to new grounds and
new forms of expression. His latest album does
have the virtue (perhaps I should say the "qual
ity") of being different, but too often ex
perimentation breaksdown into simple novelty.
The "jive" conversation which is carried on
throughout the title track becomes almost
ludicrous, serving only to break the monotony
of the music.
The album does feature one gem in Abram's
composition "Bud P." The song is dedicated to
Bud Powell, the founder of modern jazz piano,
although the music bears little resemblance to
Powell's streamlined virtuosity. Here Abram's
group creates vortex of sound which achieves
the hypnotic effect that this type of music de
mands. Elsewhere Abram's music never grows
beyond the two star level.
