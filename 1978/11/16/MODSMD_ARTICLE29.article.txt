## Burstyn and Mercouri power a strong 'Dream' 
### 
You'd think that nothing
could keep audiences away
from the movies better than a
film retelling an ancient myth.
For most people, the ancient
myths are as dead as the lan
guages they were written in,
and the thought of a filmmaker
resuscitating them in his work
sounds faintly pretentious.
Yet these myths, rooted in
elemental emotion, do have
the power to enthrall us, and
even to make us reflect on our
own culture. In fact, myth may
be one of the most potent tools
for confronting the parts of our
selves that society drives un
derground. We live in an age of
oppressive order and perva
sive violence, feeling these
forces at war not only in society
but within ourselves. And
nowhere does the battle bet
ween order and violence sur
face more explosively than in
the ancient myths.
Myth
A Dream of Passion revolves
around the myth of Medea. In

the film two women have an
encounter. One is a successful
but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea
in her native country, Greece.
The other woman is an Ameri
can, confined to a prison for
having committed the very
crime which made the legen
dary Medea notorious. She has
murdered her own children.
Jules Dassin's film explores
the improbable but inevitable
attraction between these two
women. Each is looking toward
the other for some answer, for
some undefined quality that
she hopes will make her own
life complete. The women are
opposites, but they are also re
flections of the same personal
ity.
Mi»ya
For the actress Maya (Melina
Mercouri), life is pressed into
the orderly mold of theater, a
demanding and artificial uni
verse. Through the persistent
and fluid exploration of the
camera, we can see the perils

and rewards of this world, its
surface glamour, and its artistic
challenge. The rehearsal stage
is populated with discordant,
bitchy people who set their
own egos above anything else,
and Maya is close to being one
of this crowd.
But her collision with the
real-life modern Medea up
roots her. Through the kind of
jolt that movies can produce,
we move from the world of
floodlights and publicity
agents to the austere Creek
prison where Brenda (Ellen
Burstyn) is locked away. In
contrast to the chic Maya,
whom she is about to meet,
Brenda is wide in the hip, shuf
fles her feet, and has the mealy
complexion of someone who
has been shut away for
months. Brenda lives with her
own inner theater of demons,
and seeks refuge in a fortress
of innocence she has con
structed to contain her rage.
In playing the modern
Medea, Ellen Burstyn turns in

stantaneously from rationality
to religious fervor, and then to
obscene rage. All the unpre
dictable shifts of the paranoid
mind can be read in Burstyn's
astounding performance, but
so can a rootedness, and it is
this quality that finally makes
her character so tangible.
Mercouri
Melinda Mercouri moves
with a grander, more obviously
theatrical style — but she is
equally right for her role. She
has the sort of worn and
weathered glamour of a veteran
stage actress, and she radiates
a fleshly quality that, thank
fully, isn't disguised by gauze.
It's refreshing to see a mature,
sensual woman on the screen
who is not trying to hide her
age. In Mercouri, we sense a
style that is right for the role of
Maya, an actress who is search
ing for more emotional truth
than her director is willing to
allow her. Her compulsion to
understand the experience of a
woman labeled criminal and
insane has to be made believa
ble. It is: Mercouri projects the
dramatized but uncompromis
ing emotional honesty that is
necessary for the role.
And the scenes that Burstyn
and Mercouri share convince
us of the bond that grows bet
ween the actress and her real
life counterpart. They must
meet across prison barriers,
touching their hands through
bars and across glass parti
tions. Their attraction is clearly
irrational, mystical, in defiance
of all the order and discipline
that is supposed to regulate
desire. The two women begin
to take part in the same iden
tity.
Captive
At some point, A Dream of
Passion manages to draw the
audience into this merging of
minds and emotions. While
the film begins as a psycholog
ical detective story, promising
to probe Brenda's personality,
it finally refuses to answer
questions. In time Brenda's

rage and rebellion simply grow
into a divine force that domi
nates Maya's performance and
life — and the life of the film as
well. As one character says of
the ancient tragedy, "If the ar
tist is mad, then we are the cap
tive of the madness."
Ultimately we are entangled
so thoroughly in the
psychological meshwork that
no intellectual distance is pos
sible. When A Dream of Pas
sion works it does so by con
vincing us that there is renewal
in the communication of our
most hidden and elemental
drives.
Loose ends
But when A Dream of Passion
tries to make intellectual
points about the creative pro
cess or about the degradation
of modern woman, it usually
fails to pick up the loose ends.
Like Ingmar Bergman in Per
sona (the film to which Dassin
openly pays homage), he is
exploring the region where so
cial roles end and the psyche
begins. But whereas Bergman
achieved an intellectual con
centration by isolating his two
women protagonists on an is
land, and reducing all the

speech to one long
monologue, Dassin has sur
rounded his two women with
too many disparate threads
from their outside lives.
Even the plot has ragged
edges. Maya at one point at
tempts to clear the air by open
ing up her hidden past to all
her longtime associates. We
have intimations of pain and
deceit that haunt Maya. But the
gory details never emerge and
the little bit of gossip that we
hear makes faint popping
noises when it ought to
explode.
Stunning
But when a film is as stun- 1
ning to the eye and the emo
tions as this one is, one can
forgive. Dassin concludes with
a scene that blends Maya's
stage acting of Medea with
Brenda's imagined or remem
bered slaughter of her chil
dren. It is photographed in
burning colors, and cross-ctit
in such a way that we are never
sure where the crime ends and
the performance begins, or
even in whose mind the blend
ing is taking place.
Perhaps theanswer is, it's all

in the filmmaker's mind, where
boundaries between art and
reality are meaningless. If the
movie withholds intellectual
certainty, it is presumably to
remind us that particular truths
have to be comprehended
emotionally. It's too bad that
Dassin couldn't find a way to
score his emotional points
without frustrating the audi
ence's intellectual expecta
tions. There's no law which
says that emotional and intel
lectual understanding can't go
hand in hand.
In its highly self-conscious
exploration of the limits of
cinematic form, and in its
homage to filmmakers who
have come before, A Dream of
Passion comes across occa
sionally as a ponderous film. It
seems to spend its intellectual
force in the wrong area, and
refuses to come to terms with
the important issues it raises.
But still, its success is rare.
In widening the boundaries
of our understanding and in
demanding the emotional par
ticipation of its audience, it
surveys a territory where
cinema and ritual overlap.

be one of the most potent tools

Myth
A Dream of Passion revolves
around the myth of Medea. In

the film two women have an
encounter. One is a successful
but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea
in her native country, Greece.
The other woman is an Ameri
can, confined to a prison for
having committed the very
crime which made the legen
dary Medea notorious. She has
murdered her own children.
Jules Dassin's film explores
the improbable but inevitable
attraction between these two
women. Each is looking toward
the other for some answer, for
some undefined quality that
she hopes will make her own
life complete. The women are
opposites, but they are also re
flections of the same personal
ity.
Mi»ya
For the actress Maya (Melina
Mercouri), life is pressed into
the orderly mold of theater, a
demanding and artificial uni
verse. Through the persistent
and fluid exploration of the
camera, we can see the perils

and rewards of this world, its
surface glamour, and its artistic
challenge. The rehearsal stage
is populated with discordant,
bitchy people who set their
own egos above anything else,
and Maya is close to being one
of this crowd.
But her collision with the
real-life modern Medea up
roots her. Through the kind of
jolt that movies can produce,
we move from the world of
floodlights and publicity
agents to the austere Creek
prison where Brenda (Ellen
Burstyn) is locked away. In
contrast to the chic Maya,
whom she is about to meet,
Brenda is wide in the hip, shuf
fles her feet, and has the mealy
complexion of someone who
has been shut away for
months. Brenda lives with her
own inner theater of demons,
and seeks refuge in a fortress
of innocence she has con
structed to contain her rage.
In playing the modern
Medea, Ellen Burstyn turns in

stantaneously from rationality
to religious fervor, and then to
obscene rage. All the unpre
dictable shifts of the paranoid
mind can be read in Burstyn's
astounding performance, but
so can a rootedness, and it is
this quality that finally makes
her character so tangible.
Mercouri
Melinda Mercouri moves
with a grander, more obviously
theatrical style — but she is
equally right for her role. She
has the sort of worn and
weathered glamour of a veteran
stage actress, and she radiates
a fleshly quality that, thank
fully, isn't disguised by gauze.
It's refreshing to see a mature,
sensual woman on the screen
who is not trying to hide her
age. In Mercouri, we sense a
style that is right for the role of
Maya, an actress who is search
ing for more emotional truth
than her director is willing to
allow her. Her compulsion to
understand the experience of a
woman labeled criminal and
insane has to be made believa
ble. It is: Mercouri projects the
dramatized but uncompromis
ing emotional honesty that is
necessary for the role.
And the scenes that Burstyn
and Mercouri share convince
us of the bond that grows bet
ween the actress and her real
life counterpart. They must
meet across prison barriers,
touching their hands through
bars and across glass parti
tions. Their attraction is clearly
irrational, mystical, in defiance
of all the order and discipline
that is supposed to regulate
desire. The two women begin
to take part in the same iden
tity.
Captive
At some point, A Dream of
Passion manages to draw the
audience into this merging of
minds and emotions. While
the film begins as a psycholog
ical detective story, promising
to probe Brenda's personality,
it finally refuses to answer
questions. In time Brenda's

rage and rebellion simply grow
into a divine force that domi
nates Maya's performance and
life — and the life of the film as
well. As one character says of
the ancient tragedy, "If the ar
tist is mad, then we are the cap
tive of the madness."
Ultimately we are entangled
so thoroughly in the
psychological meshwork that
no intellectual distance is pos
sible. When A Dream of Pas
sion works it does so by con
vincing us that there is renewal
in the communication of our
most hidden and elemental
drives.
Loose ends
But when A Dream of Passion
tries to make intellectual
points about the creative pro
cess or about the degradation
of modern woman, it usually
fails to pick up the loose ends.
Like Ingmar Bergman in Per
sona (the film to which Dassin
openly pays homage), he is
exploring the region where so
cial roles end and the psyche
begins. But whereas Bergman
achieved an intellectual con
centration by isolating his two
women protagonists on an is
land, and reducing all the

speech to one long
monologue, Dassin has sur
rounded his two women with
too many disparate threads
from their outside lives.
Even the plot has ragged
edges. Maya at one point at
tempts to clear the air by open
ing up her hidden past to all
her longtime associates. We
have intimations of pain and
deceit that haunt Maya. But the
gory details never emerge and
the little bit of gossip that we
hear makes faint popping
noises when it ought to
explode.
Stunning
But when a film is as stun- 1
ning to the eye and the emo
tions as this one is, one can
forgive. Dassin concludes with
a scene that blends Maya's
stage acting of Medea with
Brenda's imagined or remem
bered slaughter of her chil
dren. It is photographed in
burning colors, and cross-ctit
in such a way that we are never
sure where the crime ends and
the performance begins, or
even in whose mind the blend
ing is taking place.
Perhaps theanswer is, it's all

in the filmmaker's mind, where
boundaries between art and
reality are meaningless. If the
movie withholds intellectual
certainty, it is presumably to
remind us that particular truths
have to be comprehended
emotionally. It's too bad that
Dassin couldn't find a way to
score his emotional points
without frustrating the audi
ence's intellectual expecta
tions. There's no law which
says that emotional and intel
lectual understanding can't go
hand in hand.
In its highly self-conscious
exploration of the limits of
cinematic form, and in its
homage to filmmakers who
have come before, A Dream of
Passion comes across occa
sionally as a ponderous film. It
seems to spend its intellectual
force in the wrong area, and
refuses to come to terms with
the important issues it raises.
But still, its success is rare.
In widening the boundaries
of our understanding and in
demanding the emotional par
ticipation of its audience, it
surveys a territory where
cinema and ritual overlap.

is rehearsing the role of Medea
in her native country, Greece.
The other woman is an Ameri
can, confined to a prison for
having committed the very
crime which made the legen
dary Medea notorious. She has
murdered her own children.
Jules Dassin's film explores
the improbable but inevitable
attraction between these two
women. Each is looking toward
the other for some answer, for
some undefined quality that
she hopes will make her own
life complete. The women are
opposites, but they are also re
flections of the same personal
ity.
Mi»ya
For the actress Maya (Melina
Mercouri), life is pressed into
the orderly mold of theater, a
demanding and artificial uni
verse. Through the persistent
and fluid exploration of the
camera, we can see the perils

and rewards of this world, its
surface glamour, and its artistic
challenge. The rehearsal stage
is populated with discordant,
bitchy people who set their
own egos above anything else,
and Maya is close to being one
of this crowd.
But her collision with the
real-life modern Medea up
roots her. Through the kind of
jolt that movies can produce,
we move from the world of
floodlights and publicity
agents to the austere Creek
prison where Brenda (Ellen
Burstyn) is locked away. In
contrast to the chic Maya,
whom she is about to meet,
Brenda is wide in the hip, shuf
fles her feet, and has the mealy
complexion of someone who
has been shut away for
months. Brenda lives with her
own inner theater of demons,
and seeks refuge in a fortress
of innocence she has con
structed to contain her rage.
In playing the modern
Medea, Ellen Burstyn turns in

stantaneously from rationality
to religious fervor, and then to
obscene rage. All the unpre
dictable shifts of the paranoid
mind can be read in Burstyn's
astounding performance, but
so can a rootedness, and it is
this quality that finally makes
her character so tangible.
Mercouri
Melinda Mercouri moves
with a grander, more obviously
theatrical style — but she is
equally right for her role. She
has the sort of worn and
weathered glamour of a veteran
stage actress, and she radiates
a fleshly quality that, thank
fully, isn't disguised by gauze.
It's refreshing to see a mature,
sensual woman on the screen
who is not trying to hide her
age. In Mercouri, we sense a
style that is right for the role of
Maya, an actress who is search
ing for more emotional truth
than her director is willing to
allow her. Her compulsion to
understand the experience of a
woman labeled criminal and
insane has to be made believa
ble. It is: Mercouri projects the
dramatized but uncompromis
ing emotional honesty that is
necessary for the role.
And the scenes that Burstyn
and Mercouri share convince
us of the bond that grows bet
ween the actress and her real
life counterpart. They must
meet across prison barriers,
touching their hands through
bars and across glass parti
tions. Their attraction is clearly
irrational, mystical, in defiance
of all the order and discipline
that is supposed to regulate
desire. The two women begin
to take part in the same iden
tity.
Captive
At some point, A Dream of
Passion manages to draw the
audience into this merging of
minds and emotions. While
the film begins as a psycholog
ical detective story, promising
to probe Brenda's personality,
it finally refuses to answer
questions. In time Brenda's

rage and rebellion simply grow
into a divine force that domi
nates Maya's performance and
life — and the life of the film as
well. As one character says of
the ancient tragedy, "If the ar
tist is mad, then we are the cap
tive of the madness."
Ultimately we are entangled
so thoroughly in the
psychological meshwork that
no intellectual distance is pos
sible. When A Dream of Pas
sion works it does so by con
vincing us that there is renewal
in the communication of our
most hidden and elemental
drives.
Loose ends
But when A Dream of Passion
tries to make intellectual
points about the creative pro
cess or about the degradation
of modern woman, it usually
fails to pick up the loose ends.
Like Ingmar Bergman in Per
sona (the film to which Dassin
openly pays homage), he is
exploring the region where so
cial roles end and the psyche
begins. But whereas Bergman
achieved an intellectual con
centration by isolating his two
women protagonists on an is
land, and reducing all the

speech to one long
monologue, Dassin has sur
rounded his two women with
too many disparate threads
from their outside lives.
Even the plot has ragged
edges. Maya at one point at
tempts to clear the air by open
ing up her hidden past to all
her longtime associates. We
have intimations of pain and
deceit that haunt Maya. But the
gory details never emerge and
the little bit of gossip that we
hear makes faint popping
noises when it ought to
explode.
Stunning
But when a film is as stun- 1
ning to the eye and the emo
tions as this one is, one can
forgive. Dassin concludes with
a scene that blends Maya's
stage acting of Medea with
Brenda's imagined or remem
bered slaughter of her chil
dren. It is photographed in
burning colors, and cross-ctit
in such a way that we are never
sure where the crime ends and
the performance begins, or
even in whose mind the blend
ing is taking place.
Perhaps theanswer is, it's all

in the filmmaker's mind, where
boundaries between art and
reality are meaningless. If the
movie withholds intellectual
certainty, it is presumably to
remind us that particular truths
have to be comprehended
emotionally. It's too bad that
Dassin couldn't find a way to
score his emotional points
without frustrating the audi
ence's intellectual expecta
tions. There's no law which
says that emotional and intel
lectual understanding can't go
hand in hand.
In its highly self-conscious
exploration of the limits of
cinematic form, and in its
homage to filmmakers who
have come before, A Dream of
Passion comes across occa
sionally as a ponderous film. It
seems to spend its intellectual
force in the wrong area, and
refuses to come to terms with
the important issues it raises.
But still, its success is rare.
In widening the boundaries
of our understanding and in
demanding the emotional par
ticipation of its audience, it
surveys a territory where
cinema and ritual overlap.

You'd think that nothing
could keep audiences away
from the movies better than a
film retelling an ancient myth.
For most people, the ancient
myths are as dead as the lan
guages they were written in,
and the thought of a filmmaker
resuscitating them in his work
sounds faintly pretentious.
Yet these myths, rooted in
elemental emotion, do have
the power to enthrall us, and
even to make us reflect on our
own culture. In fact, myth may
be one of the most potent tools
for confronting the parts of our
selves that society drives un
derground. We live in an age of
oppressive order and perva
sive violence, feeling these
forces at war not only in society
but within ourselves. And
nowhere does the battle bet
ween order and violence sur
face more explosively than in
the ancient myths.

ity.
Mi»ya
For the actress Maya (Melina
Mercouri), life is pressed into
the orderly mold of theater, a
demanding and artificial uni
verse. Through the persistent
and fluid exploration of the
camera, we can see the perils

and rewards of this world, its
surface glamour, and its artistic
challenge. The rehearsal stage
is populated with discordant,
bitchy people who set their
own egos above anything else,
and Maya is close to being one
of this crowd.
But her collision with the
real-life modern Medea up
roots her. Through the kind of
jolt that movies can produce,
we move from the world of
floodlights and publicity
agents to the austere Creek
prison where Brenda (Ellen
Burstyn) is locked away. In
contrast to the chic Maya,
whom she is about to meet,
Brenda is wide in the hip, shuf
fles her feet, and has the mealy
complexion of someone who
has been shut away for
months. Brenda lives with her
own inner theater of demons,
and seeks refuge in a fortress
of innocence she has con
structed to contain her rage.
In playing the modern
Medea, Ellen Burstyn turns in

stantaneously from rationality
to religious fervor, and then to
obscene rage. All the unpre
dictable shifts of the paranoid
mind can be read in Burstyn's
astounding performance, but
so can a rootedness, and it is
this quality that finally makes
her character so tangible.
Mercouri
Melinda Mercouri moves
with a grander, more obviously
theatrical style — but she is
equally right for her role. She
has the sort of worn and
weathered glamour of a veteran
stage actress, and she radiates
a fleshly quality that, thank
fully, isn't disguised by gauze.
It's refreshing to see a mature,
sensual woman on the screen
who is not trying to hide her
age. In Mercouri, we sense a
style that is right for the role of
Maya, an actress who is search
ing for more emotional truth
than her director is willing to
allow her. Her compulsion to
understand the experience of a
woman labeled criminal and
insane has to be made believa
ble. It is: Mercouri projects the
dramatized but uncompromis
ing emotional honesty that is
necessary for the role.
And the scenes that Burstyn
and Mercouri share convince
us of the bond that grows bet
ween the actress and her real
life counterpart. They must
meet across prison barriers,
touching their hands through
bars and across glass parti
tions. Their attraction is clearly
irrational, mystical, in defiance
of all the order and discipline
that is supposed to regulate
desire. The two women begin
to take part in the same iden
tity.
Captive
At some point, A Dream of
Passion manages to draw the
audience into this merging of
minds and emotions. While
the film begins as a psycholog
ical detective story, promising
to probe Brenda's personality,
it finally refuses to answer
questions. In time Brenda's

rage and rebellion simply grow
into a divine force that domi
nates Maya's performance and
life — and the life of the film as
well. As one character says of
the ancient tragedy, "If the ar
tist is mad, then we are the cap
tive of the madness."
Ultimately we are entangled
so thoroughly in the
psychological meshwork that
no intellectual distance is pos
sible. When A Dream of Pas
sion works it does so by con
vincing us that there is renewal
in the communication of our
most hidden and elemental
drives.
Loose ends
But when A Dream of Passion
tries to make intellectual
points about the creative pro
cess or about the degradation
of modern woman, it usually
fails to pick up the loose ends.
Like Ingmar Bergman in Per
sona (the film to which Dassin
openly pays homage), he is
exploring the region where so
cial roles end and the psyche
begins. But whereas Bergman
achieved an intellectual con
centration by isolating his two
women protagonists on an is
land, and reducing all the

speech to one long
monologue, Dassin has sur
rounded his two women with
too many disparate threads
from their outside lives.
Even the plot has ragged
edges. Maya at one point at
tempts to clear the air by open
ing up her hidden past to all
her longtime associates. We
have intimations of pain and
deceit that haunt Maya. But the
gory details never emerge and
the little bit of gossip that we
hear makes faint popping
noises when it ought to
explode.
Stunning
But when a film is as stun- 1
ning to the eye and the emo
tions as this one is, one can
forgive. Dassin concludes with
a scene that blends Maya's
stage acting of Medea with
Brenda's imagined or remem
bered slaughter of her chil
dren. It is photographed in
burning colors, and cross-ctit
in such a way that we are never
sure where the crime ends and
the performance begins, or
even in whose mind the blend
ing is taking place.
Perhaps theanswer is, it's all

in the filmmaker's mind, where
boundaries between art and
reality are meaningless. If the
movie withholds intellectual
certainty, it is presumably to
remind us that particular truths
have to be comprehended
emotionally. It's too bad that
Dassin couldn't find a way to
score his emotional points
without frustrating the audi
ence's intellectual expecta
tions. There's no law which
says that emotional and intel
lectual understanding can't go
hand in hand.
In its highly self-conscious
exploration of the limits of
cinematic form, and in its
homage to filmmakers who
have come before, A Dream of
Passion comes across occa
sionally as a ponderous film. It
seems to spend its intellectual
force in the wrong area, and
refuses to come to terms with
the important issues it raises.
But still, its success is rare.
In widening the boundaries
of our understanding and in
demanding the emotional par
ticipation of its audience, it
surveys a territory where
cinema and ritual overlap.
