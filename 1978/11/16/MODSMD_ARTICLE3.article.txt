# Marz Garcia takes 90-vote lead
## 
### 
Republican Marz Garcia has accumulated a 90-vote
lead over incumbent Arlen Gregorio in a new vote count
in the cliffhanger 10th District State Senate race.
The new totals, 88,248 to 88,158, will probably stand,
give or take a tew votes. Garcia told the Palo Alto Times
"there's very, very little margin for error. Both cam
paigns have been through the numbers, both counted
votes on the machine."
The new totals, which include seven new votes for
each candidate from Santa Clara County, corrected er
rors made in earlier tabulations, San Mateo County
Clerk Marvin Church told The Associated Press.
He said it was possible the vote could swing back in
Gregorio's favor in the final canvass. "But I don't think
it's likely," he added.
"I think it appears that Garcia probably has been
elected," Gregorio said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press. He said he didn't know if he would
ask for a recount once a final canvass is completed.
"I don't know what I will do," he said. "I expect to talk
to a few people and get some advice. I really need to
know a little bit more about all the circumstances."
Victory apparently certain
Despite the apparent certainty of his victory, Garcia
told the Daily he will not claim victory yet. "I think I will
do that after Gregorio claims defeat," he said, saying he
felt it was a matter of courtesy to do so.
"I'm happy it's over. Now I can get on with some

constructive work," he said.
Gregorio led by 39 votes on election night. But after
some absentee ballots and uncounted votes from two
precincts were added in, Garcia led by five.
The detailed count, called a canvass, was necessitated
by the small margin that separated Garcia and Gregorio
after most election results were in.
The canvass involved retabulating the votes from the
San Mateo County voting machines and making sure all
votes cast were counted. Members of both candidates'
campaigns assisted and supervised the canvass.
The result will not be official until Nov. 28. In the
meantime, officials are checking the differences bet
ween the new count and the previous one to find out
where the errors originated.
Shift to right
A loss by Gregorio would give Republicans 15 seats in
the 40-member Senate, one more than they now hold,
and shift the already conservative legislative body more
to the right.
Gregorio is a moderate to liberal Democrat, and Gar
cia is expected to be more conservative.
If Garcia's 90-vote lead holds, the race will be the sixth
closest state Senate election in 75 years, according to
Caren Daniels, press secretary to Secretary of State
March Fong Eu, who checked figures back through 1904.
The closest was a 1916 cliffhanger decided by two
votes.

Despite the apparent certainty of his victory, Garcia
told the Daily he will not claim victory yet. "I think I will
do that after Gregorio claims defeat," he said, saying he
felt it was a matter of courtesy to do so.
"I'm happy it's over. Now I can get on with some

constructive work," he said.
Gregorio led by 39 votes on election night. But after
some absentee ballots and uncounted votes from two
precincts were added in, Garcia led by five.
The detailed count, called a canvass, was necessitated
by the small margin that separated Garcia and Gregorio
after most election results were in.
The canvass involved retabulating the votes from the
San Mateo County voting machines and making sure all
votes cast were counted. Members of both candidates'
campaigns assisted and supervised the canvass.
The result will not be official until Nov. 28. In the
meantime, officials are checking the differences bet
ween the new count and the previous one to find out
where the errors originated.
Shift to right
A loss by Gregorio would give Republicans 15 seats in
the 40-member Senate, one more than they now hold,
and shift the already conservative legislative body more
to the right.
Gregorio is a moderate to liberal Democrat, and Gar
cia is expected to be more conservative.
If Garcia's 90-vote lead holds, the race will be the sixth
closest state Senate election in 75 years, according to
Caren Daniels, press secretary to Secretary of State
March Fong Eu, who checked figures back through 1904.
The closest was a 1916 cliffhanger decided by two
votes.
Republican Marz Garcia has accumulated a 90-vote
lead over incumbent Arlen Gregorio in a new vote count
in the cliffhanger 10th District State Senate race.
The new totals, 88,248 to 88,158, will probably stand,
give or take a tew votes. Garcia told the Palo Alto Times
"there's very, very little margin for error. Both cam
paigns have been through the numbers, both counted
votes on the machine."
The new totals, which include seven new votes for
each candidate from Santa Clara County, corrected er
rors made in earlier tabulations, San Mateo County
Clerk Marvin Church told The Associated Press.
He said it was possible the vote could swing back in
Gregorio's favor in the final canvass. "But I don't think
it's likely," he added.
"I think it appears that Garcia probably has been
elected," Gregorio said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press. He said he didn't know if he would
ask for a recount once a final canvass is completed.
"I don't know what I will do," he said. "I expect to talk
to a few people and get some advice. I really need to
know a little bit more about all the circumstances."
