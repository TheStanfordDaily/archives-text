Sadat says talks in serious crisis
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat described the
Mideast peace talks yesterday as being in a state of
"serious crisis" and raised the possibility of a sus
pension to allow Egypt and Israel time to consider
their positions.
Informed Egyptian sources said their govern
ment has formulated new proposals designed to
avoid a total deadlock in the Washington peace
treaty talks that still hold to Egypt's primary de
mands.
In Jerusalem, the Israeli Cabinet cut short its
review of the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations to await
clarification of the new proposals.
The White House said President Jimmy Carter
met with Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman
on Tuesday to ask Israel to wait until Egypt's new
position is clear before making any decisions.
The Washington negotiations have been snarled
by Egyptian pressure to tie the transformation of
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip into
an autonomous Palestinian region to the de
velopment of peaceful relations between Egypt
and Israel.
Israel wants the peace treaty to stand on its own
and has opposed setting any timetable on the de
velopments in the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
Cancer kills anthropologist Mead
New York — Margaret Mead, one of the world's
foremost anthropologists and idol of several gen
erations of American students, died Wednesday
after a year-long battle with cancer. She was 76.
She was the retired curator of ethnology at the
American Museum of Natural History and also had
occupied chairs of anthropology at Columbia and
Fordham universities.
Mead, whose early fame and professional repu
tation were based on exhaustive field studies of
primitive Pacific island cultures, always stayed in
tune and in touch with the voung of her own land.
Popularizing anthropology was among her
major achievements — "mass education of the
very best kind," said Robert Murphy, a Columbia
University anthropologist and former department
chairman.
"She pioneered two important fields, being the
first to take a cross-cultural look at childhood and
the role of culture in shaping personality," he said.
"In 1949, she wrote Male and Female,' 20 years
before the rest of the world turned its eyes on the
female role."
Mead, who was born Dec. 16, 1901, in a suburb
of Philadelphia, preached that a large, cohesive
family was the best environment for a child to
grow in.

Moslem pilgrim plane crashes
Colombo, Sri Lanka — A jetliner filled with Mos
lem pilgrims crashed into a coconut plantation just
short of Colombo's airport yesterday while being
guided down in a bad thunderstorm. It broke into
pieces and burned, killing most of those aboard.
Hospital spokesmen said more than 60 of the 246
passengers and 13 crew survived. An official at the
scene said, "It passes all understanding how any
body at all could have come out alive after a wreck
like that."
Sri Lanka military and police rescue squads were
trying to cut through the wreckage to free the
bodies of victims.
Witnesses said a fleet of ambulances shuttled
the injured to a nearby hospital.
Authorities said they did not know what caused
the crash and said they were searching for the jet's
flight recorder.
The airport is about 18 miles from Colombo,
capital of this island nation off the tip of India.
Aviation officials said the plane was in contact
with the tower until the crash occurred.
Ray not paid to murder King
Washington — The House assassinations com
mittee said yesterday it can find no evidence that
James Earl Ray was ever paid to assassinate civil
rights leader Martin Luther King )r.
Ray probably financed his flight from the assas
sination scene in Memphis, Tenn., with cash ob
tained in an Illinois bank robbery, committee in
vestigators concluded.
Following King's murder on April 4, 1978, Ray
fled to Canada, flew to England, went on to Por
tugal, then returned to London and was arrested
)une 8, 1968.
He had also traveled extensively in Mexico and
Canada from the time of his escape from the Mis
souri State Penitentiary on April 23,1967, until the
assassination.
Those who believe there was a conspiracy to kill
King have cited the lack of any apparent source of
income that Ray could have used to pay travel and
other expenses, including phony documents to
mask his identity.
lames Earl Ray, currently serving a 99-year prison
term for the King assassination, has denied any
part in the bank robbery, which is still listed as
unsolved by the FBI. John Ray is to testify before
the committee later.
lames Earl Ray initially pleaded guilty to the as
sassination, but has since recanted a confession
made in 1969.

Activists allowed to emigrate
Moscow — The Soviet Union yielded to Ameri
can pressure and gave permission yesterday for
Jessica Katz and her Jewish activist parents to
emigrate, ending their year-long battle to obtain
American medical treatment for the baby's rare
digestive illness.
The family has until Dec. 4 to leave for Israel, but
probably will proceed directly to the United
States.
The Katzes were one of 18 Soviet families that
President Leonid Brezhnev promised U.S. Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), would be allowed to
emigrate. American Jewish organizations also
have intervened on Jessica's behalf.
Western diplomats here hailed the develop
ment as a "victory" for President Carter's human
rights campaign.
Probe launched despite snags
Mountain View — A Venus-bound atmospheric
probe was launched from a Pioneer spacecraft
Wednesday, 5Vi hours after a mathematical prob
lem prevented the first-time ever maneuver from
going off on schedule.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
officials said the delay of the launch of the Soun
der Probe occurred because scientists did not
know exactly where in space the main craft, the
Transporter Bus, was.
The Pioneer craft are the first devoted primarily
to the atmosphere and weather of another planet.
Venus is the planet nearest the Earth.
Timid market advances slightly
New York — The stock market eked out a minis
cule gain Wednesday as a severe warning that a

about 3-2 among New York Stock Exchange-listed
