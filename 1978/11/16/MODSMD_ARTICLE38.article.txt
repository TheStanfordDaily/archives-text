by Stanford New Directions and the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE), Newsom told an
audience of about 75 that "We as
Americans cannot remain indifferent

of opinion between those who seek
an activist role in making South Af
rica responsive to the wants of black

Africans and those that want to main
tain a more conservative role."
When asked what influence the
United States could exert on the re

mandate an "official withdrawal" of

Should U.S. Foreign Policy Be?" left
many questions unanswered.
