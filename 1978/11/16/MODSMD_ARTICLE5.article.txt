# Iranians, veterans protest on-campus recruitment
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Members of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade, the Ira
nian Student Association and the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
led a protest against on-campus re
cruiting by the National Security
Agency (NSA) yesterday at Tresidder.
At 11:45 a.m. about 15 de
monstrators assembled in the Tre
sidder cafeteria near room 132,
where NSA representative C.H. Pern
land was conducting interviews for
interested students. The group
chanted loud denunciations of U.S.
intervention in Iran while one
member attempted to enter the
seminar room.
According to Dept. of Public Safety
Chief Marvin Herrington, no con

frontation ensued, but the individual
was advised to leave the premises.
The door was then closed, and the
recruiting entourage left for lunch
through a side exit.
Herrington said that a "couple" of
out-of-uniform Stanford police were
on the scene because "we knew
there would be pickets." However,
protesters said that they spotted at
least four plainclothes police in blue
blazers plus what they called a
"mysterious-looking figure" in the
immediate area.
The demonstrators marched to
White Plaza to perform a guerrilla
theater act featuring characteriza
tions of the shah, President Jimmy
Carter and an NSA "spy" after the
Band's bearial rally.
The NSA, located at Ft. George
Mead, Maryland, is a self-recruiting
affiliate of the Department of De
fense. The NSA describes itself as a
"federal government agency re
sponsible for developing foreign in
telligence information crucial to the
national defense." Pemland was not
available for comment.
A Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) advertisement for
yesterday's program listed NSA job
qualifications as either bachelor's or
master's degrees in electrical en
gineering, computer science and
Slavic, Near Eastern or Asian lan
guages or a master's in mathematics.
A NSA researcher in any of these
fields would utilize the latest de
velopments in science and technol
ogy to secure U.S. communications

systems throughout the world, ac
cording to a NSA pamphlet.
Five Stanford students applied at
the CPPC for appointments with
Pemland. Senior electrical engineer
ing major and NSA recruiter Patrick
Turkatte expressed an interest in an
"intriguing organization" like the
NSA. In his words, present "U.S. pol
icy ... is to the benefit of the U.S."
|im Johnson, a graduate student in
electrical engineering, said he ended
his interview after only five minutes
when he was informed of the NSA
recruiting policy requiring lie detec
tor tests. A former Naval Security
Croup employee, lohnson pointed
out that protesters may have con
fused the NSA with the CIA.
Underscoring this misinterpreta
tion, a speaker for the Vietnam Vete
rans Against the War claimed that it
was "an outrage to come to Stanford
to recruit students in the CIA. . . .
That's why we're here."
Iranian Student Association
member All Margbarshah added that
he hopes yesterday's action would
prove to the Stanford community
that Iranians have "had enough false
promises and laws."
Dick Reffei of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade asserted
his organization's support for the
type of disruption exhibited by Ira
nian students at Sepehr Zabih's
aborted speech at the International
Center Oct. 24. He said that "we
would have liked to have kicked
thesf guys off campus but (we) were
not in position today."

would have liked to have kicked
thesf guys off campus but (we) were
not in position today."
Members of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade, the Ira
nian Student Association and the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
led a protest against on-campus re
cruiting by the National Security
Agency (NSA) yesterday at Tresidder.
At 11:45 a.m. about 15 de
monstrators assembled in the Tre
sidder cafeteria near room 132,
where NSA representative C.H. Pern
land was conducting interviews for
interested students. The group
chanted loud denunciations of U.S.
intervention in Iran while one
member attempted to enter the
seminar room.
According to Dept. of Public Safety
Chief Marvin Herrington, no con

frontation ensued, but the individual
was advised to leave the premises.
The door was then closed, and the
recruiting entourage left for lunch
through a side exit.
Herrington said that a "couple" of
out-of-uniform Stanford police were
on the scene because "we knew
there would be pickets." However,
protesters said that they spotted at
least four plainclothes police in blue
blazers plus what they called a
"mysterious-looking figure" in the
immediate area.
The demonstrators marched to
White Plaza to perform a guerrilla
theater act featuring characteriza
tions of the shah, President Jimmy
Carter and an NSA "spy" after the
Band's bearial rally.
The NSA, located at Ft. George
Mead, Maryland, is a self-recruiting
affiliate of the Department of De
fense. The NSA describes itself as a
"federal government agency re
sponsible for developing foreign in
telligence information crucial to the
national defense." Pemland was not
available for comment.
A Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) advertisement for
yesterday's program listed NSA job
qualifications as either bachelor's or
master's degrees in electrical en
gineering, computer science and
Slavic, Near Eastern or Asian lan
guages or a master's in mathematics.
A NSA researcher in any of these
fields would utilize the latest de
velopments in science and technol
ogy to secure U.S. communications

systems throughout the world, ac
cording to a NSA pamphlet.
Five Stanford students applied at
the CPPC for appointments with
Pemland. Senior electrical engineer
ing major and NSA recruiter Patrick
Turkatte expressed an interest in an
"intriguing organization" like the
NSA. In his words, present "U.S. pol
icy ... is to the benefit of the U.S."
|im Johnson, a graduate student in
electrical engineering, said he ended
his interview after only five minutes
when he was informed of the NSA
recruiting policy requiring lie detec
tor tests. A former Naval Security
Croup employee, lohnson pointed
out that protesters may have con
fused the NSA with the CIA.
Underscoring this misinterpreta
tion, a speaker for the Vietnam Vete
rans Against the War claimed that it
was "an outrage to come to Stanford
to recruit students in the CIA. . . .
That's why we're here."
Iranian Student Association
member All Margbarshah added that
he hopes yesterday's action would
prove to the Stanford community
that Iranians have "had enough false
promises and laws."
Dick Reffei of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade asserted
his organization's support for the
type of disruption exhibited by Ira
nian students at Sepehr Zabih's
aborted speech at the International
Center Oct. 24. He said that "we
would have liked to have kicked
thesf guys off campus but (we) were
