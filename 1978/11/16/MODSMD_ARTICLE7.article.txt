# Forum stresses human rights
## 
### CARLA NEASEL 
In a human rights forum held in
Toyon Hall on Tuesday and Wednes
day nights, seven speakers em
phasized the humanity of man and
the many instances where this inhe
rent human characteristic is being
obliterated by repressive govern
ments all over the world.
But the forum, sponsored by the
Dept. of Residential Education, was
poorly attended; 10 people went to
the Tuesday night presentation, and
only a few more attended last night.
Robin Furness, moderator of the
forum and a housing assistant (RA) in
Toyon, said she was "shocked" that
the response was so poor. She said
that Big Came Week and midterms
"probably kept people away."
The forum's speakers covered is
sues ranging from human rights vio
lations in Rumania, South Africa and
Iran to psychiatric abuse in the Soviet
Union. Members of Amnesty Inter
national, a non-partisan organization

which works for the freedom of polit
ical prisoners, spoke about the or
ganization itself and about capital
punishment in America and
throughout the world.
Steve Fillan, who addressed the
group on psychiatric pressures
employed by the Russian govern
ment to control and repress its
people, said that the Soviet Union
labels people who would previously
have been convicted of criminal
charges as mentally ill,
"They cure you of your faith and
treat you for your opinions" he said
of the Russian mental hospital sys
tem.
Anne Bothwell, a member of the
Memorial Church South African Task
Force, told of her experiences in
South Africa, where she spent six and
a half weeks this summer.
She devoted much of her speech
to the situation of a squatter camp
community called Crossroads, which
lies just outside the limits of the city

Capetown.
Crossroads is a community of
nearly 30,000 black people who must
either live there illegally or suffer the
fragmentation of their families, ac
cording to Bothwell.
She said that the men must work in
the cities, and are often separated
from their families for 11 months out
of the year unless their wives leave
their rural homes and join them in
the squatter camp.
The conditions in Crossroads are
deplorable, Bothwell said, though
the people there have made an hon
est effort to instill a sense of com
munity pride. "The camp is
scheduled to be bulldozed this
Monday," primarily because the
people living there are black, said
Bothwell.
All speakers urged the listeners to
become involved in the human rights
movement even in the smallest of
ways.
