# Can the Mideast peace treaty work?
## Israeli, Arab students here state views 
### DAN JACOBS 
Can the Egyptian-Israeli
peace treaty work? The ques
tion is often debated here.
Arabs and Israelis here agree
on only one thing â€” the Camp
David formula has built-in limi
tations.
According to the terms of the
agreement, Israel will with
draw from the occupied Sinai
desert and dismantle multi
billion dollar settlements lo
cated therein. In return, Egypt
will become the first Arab na
tion to sign a peace settlement
with Israel.
The primary stumbling block
to an agreement now is the
question of whether to make
an Israeli-Egyptian peace set
tlement or an overall peace set
tlement, one that would in
clude the Palestinians as well.
Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat wants a strong linkage to
appease opponents of the
peace treaty end to convince
the Arab world that he is not

"selling out" the Palestinians,
leaving them without bargain
ing leverage in a comprehen
sive peace agreement.
Israel's Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and his gov
ernment protest the linkage,
claiming that Sadat cannot bar
gain for Arabs whom he does
not represent. The Begin gov
ernment notes that according
to Sadat's terms, Palestinian
leaders could boycott negotia
tions wih Israel, thus negating
the peace treaty.

News Analysis

All parties agree that the
peace is at best a partial peace.
According to Israeli visiting fel
low Yaacov Bar Simn-Tob,
"Any solution has to include
the Palestinians or it won't last.
Perhaps the moderate Pales
tine Liberation Organization
(PLO) members will soften
their stance rejecting Israel's
right to exist and we will have

the possibility of negotiating
with them." Egyptian under
graduate Ragui Assaad said "Is
rael will eventually have to face
a Palestinian state."
Aside from the Palestinian
issue great mistrust separates
the two sides. Israelis believe
that many Arabs still hope to
destroy Israel, while Arabs
question whether Israel in
tends to ever return the oc
cupied territories. Even Sadat
doesn't escape mistrust.
Israeli graduate student
Yehuda Koran said, "To put it
in a nutshell, I can't really trust
Sadat. He could be assassi
nated."
Saudi Arabian graduate stu
dent Hamad Albaadi com
mented,"The establishment of
Israel in the first place was a
miscalculation. There must be
a secular state in all of Palestine
for Moslems, Christians and
Jews." Koran countered,
"Arafat's democratic secular
state means destroying Israel.

A lot of Israelis wonder if they
have to choose between being
just (to the Palestinians) and
being dead."
Assaad agreed. "I think it's
important for us to get to know
each other. War dehumanizes.
We have to think of each other
as human beings in order to
coexist. If Israel accepts the
principle of Palestinian self
determination, they can wait a
few years for security reasons
before establishing a Palesti
nian state." Alfabl com
mented, "The longer the 'no
peace-no war' state continues,
the greater the hatred of the
Palestinians."
Koran noted, "You can't
change 50 years of conflict in a
few weeks of negotiation. Is
rael says there can be no Pales
tinian state."
Despite the reservations to
wards the treaty, both Egypt
and Israel stand to profit tre
mendously from a peace ag
reement. "In Egypt people are

really tired of war; they need
peace desperately," Assaad
said. Assaad cited pressing
urban economic problems as
more worthy than war of Egyp
tian attention. Bar Siman-Tob
added, "Israel will face tre
mendous problems of defense
and of trust, but I believe Israel
has to take the risk for peace."
Alfabl said "Peace is always
good. It's important for Egypt's
economy."
Also of importance is that an
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty
removes the threat of war. Al
baadi noted, "Without Egypt,
other Arab states have no
chance of winning a military
conflict."
The obstacles facing a com
prehensive peace are not light;
primary among them is a need
for development of trust bet
ween Israelis and Palestinians.
Moreover, Israel feels it must
be able to guarantee any peace
treaty it signs. Koran recalle
d,"We remember that the Un
ited States guaranteed a Viet
nam peace treaty in front of all
the world, and the agreement
was not worth the paper it was
written on. If Israel loses a
single war, it will be her end,
and possibly the end of all Is
raeli Jews."
The psychological barriers
between Israelis and Arabs are
evident even here. Plans for a
joint Israeli-Egyptian peace
rally have been scrapped by
the Egyptian students, appa
rently as a result of their am
bivalence towards the treaty
and their hesitation to be seen
celebrating with Israelis. A
series of discussions between
Israeli and Arab students here
was cut short last year by the
Arabs, who felt that attempts at
genuine communication were
futile, several Arab and Israeli
students said.
"Hence, the peace treaty
must be seen not as a final step
but as a beginning," Assaad
summarized.
