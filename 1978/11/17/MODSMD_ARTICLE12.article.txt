## Robert Peters Protest action disturbing 
### 
Richard Wohl's lamentable
column (Daily, Nov. 13), in
which he apparently attempts
to lampoon Congressman Pete
McCloskey's advocation of a
national service plan, deserves
comment. Before dealing with
Wohl's article in particular, I
would like to state that, al
though I also am opposed to
reinstatement of the draft, the
unintelligent and buffoon-like
tactics used by McCloskey's
opponents on this issue have
generally dismayed me.
For example, approximately
25 students invaded Kresge
Auditorium where McCloskey
and his political opponents
were attempting to debate.
These students, by the use of
guerrilla theatre and unstruc
tured screaming, delayed the
beginning of the debate by
perhaps 20 minutes and con
tinually interrupted McClos
key's attempts to talk.
In one particuarly unfair in
cident, a small irate person in a
green fatigue jacket prevented
McCloskey from speaking dur
ing his three minute rebuttal
period by shrieking abuse (in
cluding the term "racist") at
him. McCloskey showed, in
striking contrast, a rare toler
ance.
The protester's behavior was
absurd, even if one grants the
premise that racist speakers
should be shouted down,
which I do not necessarily do.
Their behavior was pointless
because it stemmed from a
knee-jerk reaction to appa
rently racist comments by
McCloskey, which were
quoted in the Daily. McClos
key said, during the debate,
that the individual quotes were
accurate, but that their poorly
chosen juxtaposition was re
sponsible for the appearance
of racism. I tend to believe
him, if only because an experi
enced politician from Palo Alto
is not likely to give a public
speech containing racial slurs,
regardless of his personal feel
ings.
A great deal of creativity, but
apparently little thought, went
into the students' disturbance.
A little thought might have told
them that it is perhaps prema
ture, or possibly even rude, to
chant "racist" at someone only
on the basis of a Daily article. I
was most upset by their unwil
lingness to hear McCloskey
out before condemning him

with such hostility. At least
they could have let him speak
first, and then screamed at him
afterwards. Even though I did
not agree with his opinion,
when I could hear him, he was
certainly more interesting and
intelligent than the protesters.

The people who re
sponded simplisti
cally, before listen
ing to McCloskey, as
if he were indeed
presenting a simple
minded racist policy,
disturb me.

I have discussed the preced
ing episode in some detail be
cause it helped set the stage for
Wohl's article. In this article
"McCloskey" becomes
"McGodsky" (a less than bril
liant bit of satire), who dis
closes that his national service
plan is really a joke designed to
anger students for some in
comprehensible reason. Wohl
might have given some mean
ing to the article by presenting
a plausible rationale for why
the joke was perpetrated, but
he does not do so. The last
paragraph of his article, in
which he attempts to do this, is
a masterpiece of the opaque.
In fact, there seems little
rationale for why Wohl'sarticle
was perpetrated. At least the
guerilla theatre was amusing.
Wohl's article is flat and any
intelligent point is obscure at
best. The point that is clear is
that he is trying to ridicule
McCloskey by making him ap
pear racist or at least cynical,
and I can see little of substance
in his column other than this
animosity. The only thing I
could find that made sense was
a statement, attributed to
"McGodsky" that his oppo
nents were "utter dullards."
Anyone reading Wohl's article
can only agree. Wohl is appa
rently trying to follow in the
footsteps of Art Hoppe, but he
does so on his hands and
knees.
Finally, you may be wonder
ing why I am so vitriolic. I am
usually little concerned with
establishment politics. What
does concern me, in this in

stance, are the rather mindless
responses of "concerned
people. (Anyone familiar with
the episode in which Sepehr
Zabih was prevented from
speaking (Daily, Nov. 14) by
disruptive students acting
more a misapprehension
about his political stance will
recognize another example of
this same unjust behavior).
To take the issue of the
reinstatement of the draft as an
example, it is clear that there
are no easy answers to such
complex problems. Answers
require thought and the assimi
lation of information, includ
ing information gathered by
listening to unpopular speak
ers. The draft is an example of a
difficult problem. If we are to
assume that some armed
forces are necessary for de
fense, then we have two op
tions: a volunteer or a drafted
army. Both have dangers. The
question is "which has fewer?"
Is the danger of military
takeover of the government by
an elite volunteer army a real
ity? Is our fighting capability
seriously jeopardized by the
low morale of the volunteer
army? Would the draft again be
a threat to our nation's moral
health?
These are all difficult and
perhaps unanswerable ques
tions, but they deserve serious
thought. I believe the draft to
be the more dangerous alter
native. McCloskey believes
otherwise. His arguments in
the debate, for those who
cared to listen,"were the argu
ments of a man who has grudg
ingly chosen an unpopular
position after sincere thought.
The people who responded
simplistically, before listening
to him, as if he were indeed
presenting a simple-minded
racist policy, disturb me. They
are not only unthoughtful,
they are unjust. Wohl's article
appears to be a continuation of
this sort of unfortunate re
sponse. He uses simple
minded satire, an easy
weapon, instead of thought.
Even in laboring under the
strain of a bi-weekly column,
he should take the time to be
not only amusing but fair and
thoughtful. This might make
him more amusing. With luck,
it might even make him nearly
as amusing as he thinks he is.
