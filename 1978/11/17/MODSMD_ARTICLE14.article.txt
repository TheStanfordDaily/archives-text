## 'Campus Morality' movement 
### 
Christian fundamentalists often worry
about the "new consciousness" move
ments that flourish on university cam
puses. For example, they have a deep dis
trust of Transcendental Meditation, fear
ing that it is really cleverly disguised Hin
duism. But their fears about TM should be
put aside, for a new movement has arisen
which is far more pernicious than TM ever
was. This new movement is disguised as
well — it pretends to do good and seeks to
help people in trouble. But it has now
been unmasked and exposed by Lewis
Gann, a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
The movement is known as "Campus
Morality," or CM; since it manifests itself
in a number of forms, it is often hard to
identify. At Stanford, forexample, CM has
taken on the shape of students who object
to American (and Stanford) investment in
the Republic of South Africa. But CM ap
pears in other places as well. It is
everywhere. And, according to Gann, it is
thoroughly dislikable. (See the Daily, Oct.
23.)
"South African blacks," according to
Gann, "are the best educated, most ur
banized blacks in Africa." Stanford CM'ers
encourage withdrawal of American in
vestment in South Africa, which would
threaten the government and the numer
ous services it provides for the blacks.
"There are more extensive social services
there (in South Africa) lhan anywhere
else," says Gann.
This is certainly true. For example,
South Africa has an immense system
known as "influx control" to monitor the
movements of blacks within her borders.
This system permits the government to
maintain its migrant labor policy, an en

lightened social system under which hus
bands live in the cities for 11 months of the
year,. During this time, they become edu
cated and urbanized, at the same time
providing cheap labor for South African
(and American) companies.
Meanwhile, their families live miles
away, in "Homelands." This, says Gann, is
done because "the blacks are a separate
cultural entity" and must be kept in an
environment which befits their culture. In
this country, we do not have such a prog
ressive social service system, perhaps be
cause America is such a hotbed of Campus
Morality. But research is no doubt in prog
ress at the Hoover, so it will not be long
before we do.
Gann is also concerned about the finan
cial aspects of Campus Morality. Propo
nents of CM are attempting "to be moral
with other peoples' money." This is be
cause "they live in a dream world," in
which they imagine that some of the tui
tion they pay to Stanford may end up sup
porting the South African government.
But this illusion aside, what is being done
with the money that goes into South Af
rica? Well, it is making that country more
prosperous than ever. And Gann reminds
us of "the very real gains that blacks have
made through South Africa's prosperity."
Who could object to such investments?
Only someone under the spell of CM.
Among other things, South Africa is
using its prosperity for urban renewal. The
government is preparing to bulldoze the
squatter town of Crossroads, created by
blacks who insist on the unprogressive
idea that families should live together. The
blacks have built unsightly "houses" out
of corrugated metal, fitting as many as 20
people into four small rooms.

The government considers this "an eye
sore" and is preparing to bulldoze the
town, sending the squatters' families back
to the Transkei Homeland, where un
crowded stone huts them. This is
truly a gain for the blacks. Some CM'ers
(and most of the blacks) object that the
children in the Transkei will not see their
fathers for 11 months of the year, and that
half of the children will die of malnutrition
before age one, and that there is almost no
food for those that survive. But such ob
jections could only be raised by regressive
people whose sense of progress has been
blunted by CM.
"The most practical solution," says
Gann, "is gradual change through in
creased social, economic, and educational
opportunities for blacks." And the gov
ernment is preparing to bring about some
change. In fact, it is preparing to do so on
Monday, Nov. 20, which is reportedly the
current target date for the bulldozing of
Crossroads. The government will not
bulldoze Crossroads if too many people
know about it in advance, because if they
do, the blacks will be ready, and foreign
diplomats and journalists will be present,
and the effect of surprise — so vital to
creative urban renewal —will be lost.
So if you see any sending tele
grams to their legislators this weekend, or
distributing leaflets, or alerting newspap
ers and television stations, take them into
custody! Send them to Gann and Duig
nan. Perhaps a special detention area can
be set up in Hoover Tower. And together
we shall eliminate Campus Morality, once
and for all.

bands live in the cities for 11 months of the
year,. During this time, they become edu
cated and urbanized, at the same time
providing cheap labor for South African
(and American) companies.
Meanwhile, their families live miles
away, in "Homelands." This, says Gann, is
done because "the blacks are a separate
cultural entity" and must be kept in an
environment which befits their culture. In
this country, we do not have such a prog
ressive social service system, perhaps be
cause America is such a hotbed of Campus
Morality. But research is no doubt in prog
ress at the Hoover, so it will not be long
before we do.
Gann is also concerned about the finan
cial aspects of Campus Morality. Propo
nents of CM are attempting "to be moral
with other peoples' money." This is be
cause "they live in a dream world," in
which they imagine that some of the tui
tion they pay to Stanford may end up sup
porting the South African government.
But this illusion aside, what is being done
with the money that goes into South Af
rica? Well, it is making that country more
prosperous than ever. And Gann reminds
us of "the very real gains that blacks have
made through South Africa's prosperity."
Who could object to such investments?
Only someone under the spell of CM.
Among other things, South Africa is
using its prosperity for urban renewal. The
government is preparing to bulldoze the
squatter town of Crossroads, created by
blacks who insist on the unprogressive
idea that families should live together. The
blacks have built unsightly "houses" out
of corrugated metal, fitting as many as 20
people into four small rooms.

The government considers this "an eye
sore" and is preparing to bulldoze the
town, sending the squatters' families back
to the Transkei Homeland, where un
crowded stone huts them. This is
truly a gain for the blacks. Some CM'ers
(and most of the blacks) object that the
children in the Transkei will not see their
fathers for 11 months of the year, and that
half of the children will die of malnutrition
before age one, and that there is almost no
food for those that survive. But such ob
jections could only be raised by regressive
people whose sense of progress has been
blunted by CM.
"The most practical solution," says
Gann, "is gradual change through in
creased social, economic, and educational
opportunities for blacks." And the gov
ernment is preparing to bring about some
change. In fact, it is preparing to do so on
Monday, Nov. 20, which is reportedly the
current target date for the bulldozing of
Crossroads. The government will not
bulldoze Crossroads if too many people
know about it in advance, because if they
do, the blacks will be ready, and foreign
diplomats and journalists will be present,
and the effect of surprise — so vital to
creative urban renewal —will be lost.
So if you see any sending tele
grams to their legislators this weekend, or
distributing leaflets, or alerting newspap
ers and television stations, take them into
custody! Send them to Gann and Duig
nan. Perhaps a special detention area can
be set up in Hoover Tower. And together
we shall eliminate Campus Morality, once
and for all.

Christian fundamentalists often worry
about the "new consciousness" move
ments that flourish on university cam
puses. For example, they have a deep dis
trust of Transcendental Meditation, fear
ing that it is really cleverly disguised Hin
duism. But their fears about TM should be
put aside, for a new movement has arisen
which is far more pernicious than TM ever
was. This new movement is disguised as
well — it pretends to do good and seeks to
help people in trouble. But it has now
been unmasked and exposed by Lewis
Gann, a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
The movement is known as "Campus
Morality," or CM; since it manifests itself
in a number of forms, it is often hard to
identify. At Stanford, forexample, CM has
taken on the shape of students who object
to American (and Stanford) investment in
the Republic of South Africa. But CM ap
pears in other places as well. It is
everywhere. And, according to Gann, it is
thoroughly dislikable. (See the Daily, Oct.
23.)
"South African blacks," according to
Gann, "are the best educated, most ur
banized blacks in Africa." Stanford CM'ers
encourage withdrawal of American in
vestment in South Africa, which would
threaten the government and the numer
ous services it provides for the blacks.
"There are more extensive social services
there (in South Africa) lhan anywhere
else," says Gann.
This is certainly true. For example,
South Africa has an immense system
known as "influx control" to monitor the
movements of blacks within her borders.
This system permits the government to
maintain its migrant labor policy, an en

lightened social system under which hus
bands live in the cities for 11 months of the

sore" and is preparing to bulldoze the
town, sending the squatters' families back
to the Transkei Homeland, where un
crowded stone huts them. This is
truly a gain for the blacks. Some CM'ers
(and most of the blacks) object that the
children in the Transkei will not see their
fathers for 11 months of the year, and that
half of the children will die of malnutrition
before age one, and that there is almost no
food for those that survive. But such ob
jections could only be raised by regressive
people whose sense of progress has been
blunted by CM.
"The most practical solution," says
Gann, "is gradual change through in
creased social, economic, and educational
opportunities for blacks." And the gov
ernment is preparing to bring about some
change. In fact, it is preparing to do so on
Monday, Nov. 20, which is reportedly the
current target date for the bulldozing of
Crossroads. The government will not
bulldoze Crossroads if too many people
know about it in advance, because if they
do, the blacks will be ready, and foreign
diplomats and journalists will be present,
and the effect of surprise — so vital to
creative urban renewal —will be lost.
So if you see any sending tele
grams to their legislators this weekend, or
distributing leaflets, or alerting newspap
ers and television stations, take them into
custody! Send them to Gann and Duig
nan. Perhaps a special detention area can
be set up in Hoover Tower. And together
we shall eliminate Campus Morality, once
and for all.
