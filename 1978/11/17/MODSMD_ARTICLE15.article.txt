Band a total
embarassment
As one who thoroughly en
joyed the "new look" Stanford
Band when it first appeared,
I am surprised that I have
reached the point where I must
criticize it strongly. In the early
70s, the band was a hit where
ver it appeared. The two Rose
Bowl performances were
smashing victories over the
pompous Ohio State and
Michigan bands.
In those days, the Band was
clever, fun, creative and
talented. Their pregame calis
thenics and other antics were
entertaining. They followed
with a grand entrance from the
end zone with renditions of the
old Stanford songs. Topped off
by the "National Anthem," it
constituted an exciting prelude
to the game itself. The halftime
performance was helter
skelter, yet often clever and
well planned. Some criticized
the new look in those days, but
many more found it refreshing
and enjoyable.
What we have today is a total
embarrassment. Both before
the game and at halftime, we
witness the spectacle of slop
pily attired students running
around the field, stopping
periodically to play boring
numbers with a beat, each one
sounding identical to the
others. The attempts at humor
are often crude. The crowd is
turned off, completely, by
these performances. Only the
Band announcer and the "Na
tional Anthem" remain as re
deeming features.
Scenes like the Oregon State
game are inexcusable. Rape is
no joke. Only the most imma
ture and uneducated minds
could have found humor in the
comments on the backs of var
ious band members. I can't
understand why any woman
would participate in such a
group.
A few years ago, we tended
to laugh at groups like the USC
band, seemingly totally out of
step with Stanford's relaxed,
fun-loving group. This year, it
was Stanford that everyone

was ridiculing, and with good
reason.
Stanford University is top
quality in every way — its stan
dards, it administration, its fa
culty and its students. The
football team, itself, is top
quality led by the finest coach
in the nation. Stanford stu
dents should demand similar
quality from its Band. That
doesn't mean a return to tin
soldiers prancing around the
field. The early '70s were fun
and respectable.
Do you suppose just once
this year we could hear "Come
loin the Band?" Maybe, we
could even have an organized
spell-out yell without five
cheer leaders*?) throwing
themselves around on the
ground. The team and the stu
dents deserve far better than
they are receiving.

response in order
Regaiding the editorial -
"Give 'em the Axe"
(Daily, Nov. 9), we feel a re
sponse is in order.
Our group has been mis
treated and misrepresented.
An incongruity arises in the
editorial. It opens with the
statement, "This year's troop
of Yell Leaders has failed mis
erably as a source ,of crowd
support at football games. .
and concludes, "The fact of the
matter is that the fans know
when to cheer for thei r football
team."
Does the editorial board be
lieve that crowd support is
necessary or that the fans
should maintain spirit them
selves? What exactly is the
board trying to say? Either
we've failed or our group is
unnecessary, but both these
criticisms cannot be valid at the
same time.
We now realize that yell lead
ing at Stanford is unnecessary.
The fans do not want to be told
what to yell or when to yell it.
But it is unfair to personally at
tack our group as a "failure."

Week after week we have tried
to come up with original skits,
routines and yells, and week
after week we've had little, if
any response. However, since
"the fans know when to cheer
for their football team," it is
doubtful whether a squad
comprised of Cheech and
Chong could have done any
better.
Our group never claimed
yell leading was necessary. We
tried only because we thought
yelling might improve spirit, a
component that has been mis
sing from the sunny side of the
stadium for a number of years.
There is no way to please our
diverse student body. Some
suggest, "Be more traditional.
We need some tradition here."
Others tell us, "Co Wild. Try to
be more like the Band."
We have tried to be innova
tive without imitating the
Band. They are truly "incom
parable," and everyone knows
that, even the Yell Leaders.
There has been an obvious
lack of support from the stu
dents, the Athletic Department
and the Band. The Band has
been uncharacteristically shy
and stand-offish toward us;
unwilling to give us group sup
port before we've "proven
ourselves." This, however, has
been impossible in the face of
their public displays of hostility
toward us.
The student body follows the
Band's example, and dares not
give support to any group
without their keg-encrusted
seal of approval. In order for
yell leading to succeed, the
idea and the squad must have
encouragement from the es
tablished support groups;
namely, the Athletic Depart
ment and the Band. This has
not materialized and we have
be,?n left as sheep in a den of
wolves. It's amazing we've
lasted as long as we have.
The timing of this editorial is
most regretful in light of the
fact that Big Came Week is
upon us. Our group has been
an instrumental part of the Axe
Committee, taking a large
chunk of the week's activities
as our own responsibility. We

sincerely hope that this edito
rial's criticism will not destroy
the one week of spirit that
Stanford observes.
The editorial board, as well
as many students, will be happy
to know we've decided against
cheering at basketball games.
We know we're not wanted.
The question we ask the edito
rial board is would anyone be
sufficient? The personal attack
on this year's Yell Leaders is
most unfair, since we highly
doubt if any group could in
spire the students who adorn
the sunny side of the stadium.
Unfortunately, people seem
to have forgotten that we, too,
are Stanford students, and not
a hired group of antagonizers.
We tried only because we
thought school spirit was
worthwhile, and could evolve
into something enjoyable. Ap
parently, we were wrong. Our
apologies to anyone we've of
fended. There was no offense
intended in our endeavors.

It was very gratifying to see
the Iranian students' state
ment in the Daily (Nov. 13), but
a great surprise to find my own
name above it in big bold print
as if I were its author. I certainly
don't want to disassociate my
self in any way from either the
argument or the group that
produced it; on the contrary, I
have strong feelings of solidar
ity with both. Still, I cannot in
good conscience take credit
for having written the piece,
which was entirely the work of
the Iranian Students Cultural
Association.
Perhaps some readers sus
pected as much when they
reached the words "We the
Iranian students at the Univer
sity. . and the final italicized
identification, but I think it
would have been better to
have put something like "A

Statement from the Iranian Stu
dents Cutlural Association" at
the head of the article
It might also be helpful for
readers to know that by nam
ing me (correctly) at the end of
the article as someone who
submitted it on behalf of
others, the Daily was following
an established journalistic
practice. Occasionally, indi
viduals in a group making a
political statement feel it is im
portant not to reveal their
names publicly, and submit
their text to the press through
the good offices of a known
member of the community
who assumes responsibility for
certifying that they are just who
they represent themselves to
be.
It is easy to see why Iranian
students who oppse the shah
want to get their position be
fore the American public with
out handing their names in a
neat package to the SAVAK
agents who abound in this
country and its campuses and
scan the press daily for just
such information. That is why
my name was given at the bot
tom, but, I fear, no justification
for its imposing authorial pre
sence at the top.

Anxiety about
women's safety
Recent reports and rumors
of the increasing occurrances
of attacks and rapes in the Stan
ford community have inten
sified my anxiety about wo
"men's safety on campus. I my
self resent the loss of choice
implicit in having to alter my
patterns of movement around
campus. Women have taken
the safety of Stanford for
granted for too long, and need
to be reminded conspicuously
of the urgency of the situation.
There are attacks here, and we
must act accordingly.
We have long heard "don't
go to the Quad unescorted
after dark" -and "don't run
alone in the hills at any time,"
but in general, our only source
of current information regard-

ing actual attacks is the
grapevine. This source, how
ever reliable, is slow and often
dismissed as hearsay. We need
immediate, accurate reports of
each attack to insure the safety
of all the women in the com
munity. The Daily is a perfect
medium for such information.
If only a small front page inset
reporting the time and place of
an attack were printed, the
message would be visible and
undeniable.
We women also must take
steps to protect each other.
Don't walk, run or bicycle
alone in deserted areas. Ask a
friend to escort you to your car,
door, etc. Don't walk, run or
ride on unlighted paths after
dark. Above all, if you are at
tacked, report it. if not to the

police, at least to where the in
formation may be passed on to
protect the other women of the
community.
Unless we take pains to help
ourselves and each other, we
may find out too much, too
late.

report such incidents, either to

when reported, the Daily will
make every attempt to report
them with wise discretion.

Band a total
embarassment
As one who thoroughly en
joyed the "new look" Stanford
Band when it first appeared,
I am surprised that I have
reached the point where I must
criticize it strongly. In the early
70s, the band was a hit where
ver it appeared. The two Rose
Bowl performances were
smashing victories over the
pompous Ohio State and
Michigan bands.
In those days, the Band was
clever, fun, creative and
talented. Their pregame calis
thenics and other antics were
entertaining. They followed
with a grand entrance from the
end zone with renditions of the
old Stanford songs. Topped off
by the "National Anthem," it
constituted an exciting prelude
to the game itself. The halftime
performance was helter
skelter, yet often clever and
well planned. Some criticized
the new look in those days, but
many more found it refreshing
and enjoyable.
What we have today is a total
embarrassment. Both before
the game and at halftime, we
witness the spectacle of slop
pily attired students running
around the field, stopping
periodically to play boring
numbers with a beat, each one
sounding identical to the
others. The attempts at humor
are often crude. The crowd is
turned off, completely, by
these performances. Only the
Band announcer and the "Na
tional Anthem" remain as re
deeming features.
Scenes like the Oregon State
game are inexcusable. Rape is
no joke. Only the most imma
ture and uneducated minds
could have found humor in the
comments on the backs of var
ious band members. I can't
understand why any woman
would participate in such a
group.
A few years ago, we tended
to laugh at groups like the USC
band, seemingly totally out of
step with Stanford's relaxed,
fun-loving group. This year, it
was Stanford that everyone

was ridiculing, and with good
reason.
Stanford University is top
quality in every way — its stan
dards, it administration, its fa
culty and its students. The
football team, itself, is top
quality led by the finest coach
in the nation. Stanford stu
dents should demand similar
quality from its Band. That
doesn't mean a return to tin
soldiers prancing around the
field. The early '70s were fun
and respectable.
Do you suppose just once
this year we could hear "Come
loin the Band?" Maybe, we
could even have an organized
spell-out yell without five
cheer leaders*?) throwing
themselves around on the
ground. The team and the stu
dents deserve far better than
they are receiving.

response in order
Regaiding the editorial -
"Give 'em the Axe"
(Daily, Nov. 9), we feel a re
sponse is in order.
Our group has been mis
treated and misrepresented.
An incongruity arises in the
editorial. It opens with the
statement, "This year's troop
of Yell Leaders has failed mis
erably as a source ,of crowd
support at football games. .
and concludes, "The fact of the
matter is that the fans know
when to cheer for thei r football
team."
Does the editorial board be
lieve that crowd support is
necessary or that the fans
should maintain spirit them
selves? What exactly is the
board trying to say? Either
we've failed or our group is
unnecessary, but both these
criticisms cannot be valid at the
same time.
We now realize that yell lead
ing at Stanford is unnecessary.
The fans do not want to be told
what to yell or when to yell it.
But it is unfair to personally at
tack our group as a "failure."

Week after week we have tried
to come up with original skits,
routines and yells, and week
after week we've had little, if
any response. However, since
"the fans know when to cheer
for their football team," it is
doubtful whether a squad
comprised of Cheech and
Chong could have done any
better.
Our group never claimed
yell leading was necessary. We
tried only because we thought
yelling might improve spirit, a
component that has been mis
sing from the sunny side of the
stadium for a number of years.
There is no way to please our
diverse student body. Some
suggest, "Be more traditional.
We need some tradition here."
Others tell us, "Co Wild. Try to
be more like the Band."
We have tried to be innova
tive without imitating the
Band. They are truly "incom
parable," and everyone knows
that, even the Yell Leaders.
There has been an obvious
lack of support from the stu
dents, the Athletic Department
and the Band. The Band has
been uncharacteristically shy
and stand-offish toward us;
unwilling to give us group sup
port before we've "proven
ourselves." This, however, has
been impossible in the face of
their public displays of hostility
toward us.
The student body follows the
Band's example, and dares not
give support to any group
without their keg-encrusted
seal of approval. In order for
yell leading to succeed, the
idea and the squad must have
encouragement from the es
tablished support groups;
namely, the Athletic Depart
ment and the Band. This has
not materialized and we have
be,?n left as sheep in a den of
wolves. It's amazing we've
lasted as long as we have.
The timing of this editorial is
most regretful in light of the
fact that Big Came Week is
upon us. Our group has been
an instrumental part of the Axe
Committee, taking a large
chunk of the week's activities
as our own responsibility. We

sincerely hope that this edito
rial's criticism will not destroy
the one week of spirit that
Stanford observes.
The editorial board, as well
as many students, will be happy
to know we've decided against
cheering at basketball games.
We know we're not wanted.
The question we ask the edito
rial board is would anyone be
sufficient? The personal attack
on this year's Yell Leaders is
most unfair, since we highly
doubt if any group could in
spire the students who adorn
the sunny side of the stadium.
Unfortunately, people seem
to have forgotten that we, too,
are Stanford students, and not
a hired group of antagonizers.
We tried only because we
thought school spirit was
worthwhile, and could evolve
into something enjoyable. Ap
parently, we were wrong. Our
apologies to anyone we've of
fended. There was no offense
intended in our endeavors.

Band a total
embarassment
As one who thoroughly en
joyed the "new look" Stanford
Band when it first appeared,
I am surprised that I have
reached the point where I must
criticize it strongly. In the early
70s, the band was a hit where
ver it appeared. The two Rose
Bowl performances were
smashing victories over the
pompous Ohio State and
Michigan bands.
In those days, the Band was
clever, fun, creative and
talented. Their pregame calis
thenics and other antics were
entertaining. They followed
with a grand entrance from the
end zone with renditions of the
old Stanford songs. Topped off
by the "National Anthem," it
constituted an exciting prelude
to the game itself. The halftime
performance was helter
skelter, yet often clever and
well planned. Some criticized
the new look in those days, but
many more found it refreshing
and enjoyable.
What we have today is a total
embarrassment. Both before
the game and at halftime, we
witness the spectacle of slop
pily attired students running
around the field, stopping
periodically to play boring
numbers with a beat, each one
sounding identical to the
others. The attempts at humor
are often crude. The crowd is
turned off, completely, by
these performances. Only the
Band announcer and the "Na
tional Anthem" remain as re
deeming features.
Scenes like the Oregon State
game are inexcusable. Rape is
no joke. Only the most imma
ture and uneducated minds
could have found humor in the
comments on the backs of var
ious band members. I can't
understand why any woman
would participate in such a
group.
A few years ago, we tended
to laugh at groups like the USC
band, seemingly totally out of
step with Stanford's relaxed,
fun-loving group. This year, it
was Stanford that everyone

was ridiculing, and with good
reason.
Stanford University is top
quality in every way — its stan
dards, it administration, its fa
culty and its students. The
football team, itself, is top
quality led by the finest coach
in the nation. Stanford stu
dents should demand similar
quality from its Band. That
doesn't mean a return to tin
soldiers prancing around the
field. The early '70s were fun
and respectable.
Do you suppose just once
this year we could hear "Come
loin the Band?" Maybe, we
could even have an organized
spell-out yell without five
cheer leaders*?) throwing
themselves around on the
ground. The team and the stu
dents deserve far better than
they are receiving.

response in order
Regaiding the editorial -
"Give 'em the Axe"
(Daily, Nov. 9), we feel a re
sponse is in order.
Our group has been mis
treated and misrepresented.
An incongruity arises in the
editorial. It opens with the
statement, "This year's troop
of Yell Leaders has failed mis
erably as a source ,of crowd
support at football games. .
and concludes, "The fact of the
matter is that the fans know
when to cheer for thei r football
team."
Does the editorial board be
lieve that crowd support is
necessary or that the fans
should maintain spirit them
selves? What exactly is the
board trying to say? Either
we've failed or our group is
unnecessary, but both these
criticisms cannot be valid at the
same time.
We now realize that yell lead
ing at Stanford is unnecessary.
The fans do not want to be told
what to yell or when to yell it.
But it is unfair to personally at
tack our group as a "failure."

Week after week we have tried
to come up with original skits,
routines and yells, and week
after week we've had little, if
any response. However, since
"the fans know when to cheer
for their football team," it is
doubtful whether a squad
comprised of Cheech and
Chong could have done any
better.
Our group never claimed
yell leading was necessary. We
tried only because we thought
yelling might improve spirit, a
component that has been mis
sing from the sunny side of the
stadium for a number of years.
There is no way to please our
diverse student body. Some
suggest, "Be more traditional.
We need some tradition here."
Others tell us, "Co Wild. Try to
be more like the Band."
We have tried to be innova
tive without imitating the
Band. They are truly "incom
parable," and everyone knows
that, even the Yell Leaders.
There has been an obvious
lack of support from the stu
dents, the Athletic Department
and the Band. The Band has
been uncharacteristically shy
and stand-offish toward us;
unwilling to give us group sup
port before we've "proven
ourselves." This, however, has
been impossible in the face of
their public displays of hostility
toward us.
The student body follows the
Band's example, and dares not
give support to any group
without their keg-encrusted
seal of approval. In order for
yell leading to succeed, the
idea and the squad must have
encouragement from the es
tablished support groups;
namely, the Athletic Depart
ment and the Band. This has
not materialized and we have
be,?n left as sheep in a den of
wolves. It's amazing we've
lasted as long as we have.
The timing of this editorial is
most regretful in light of the
fact that Big Came Week is
upon us. Our group has been
an instrumental part of the Axe
Committee, taking a large
chunk of the week's activities
as our own responsibility. We

sincerely hope that this edito
rial's criticism will not destroy
the one week of spirit that
Stanford observes.
The editorial board, as well
as many students, will be happy
to know we've decided against
cheering at basketball games.
We know we're not wanted.
The question we ask the edito
rial board is would anyone be
sufficient? The personal attack
on this year's Yell Leaders is
most unfair, since we highly
doubt if any group could in
spire the students who adorn
the sunny side of the stadium.
Unfortunately, people seem
to have forgotten that we, too,
are Stanford students, and not
a hired group of antagonizers.
We tried only because we
thought school spirit was
worthwhile, and could evolve
into something enjoyable. Ap
parently, we were wrong. Our
apologies to anyone we've of
fended. There was no offense
intended in our endeavors.

Anxiety about
women's safety
Recent reports and rumors
of the increasing occurrances
of attacks and rapes in the Stan
ford community have inten
sified my anxiety about wo
"men's safety on campus. I my
self resent the loss of choice
implicit in having to alter my
patterns of movement around
campus. Women have taken
the safety of Stanford for
granted for too long, and need
to be reminded conspicuously
of the urgency of the situation.
There are attacks here, and we
must act accordingly.
We have long heard "don't
go to the Quad unescorted
after dark" -and "don't run
alone in the hills at any time,"
but in general, our only source
of current information regard-

ing actual attacks is the
grapevine. This source, how
ever reliable, is slow and often
dismissed as hearsay. We need
immediate, accurate reports of
each attack to insure the safety
of all the women in the com
munity. The Daily is a perfect
medium for such information.
If only a small front page inset
reporting the time and place of
an attack were printed, the
message would be visible and
undeniable.
We women also must take
steps to protect each other.
Don't walk, run or bicycle
alone in deserted areas. Ask a
friend to escort you to your car,
door, etc. Don't walk, run or
ride on unlighted paths after
dark. Above all, if you are at
tacked, report it. if not to the

police, at least to where the in
formation may be passed on to
protect the other women of the
community.
Unless we take pains to help
ourselves and each other, we
may find out too much, too
late.

Band a total
embarassment
As one who thoroughly en
joyed the "new look" Stanford
Band when it first appeared,
I am surprised that I have
reached the point where I must
criticize it strongly. In the early
70s, the band was a hit where
ver it appeared. The two Rose
Bowl performances were
smashing victories over the
pompous Ohio State and
Michigan bands.
In those days, the Band was
clever, fun, creative and
talented. Their pregame calis
thenics and other antics were
entertaining. They followed
with a grand entrance from the
end zone with renditions of the
old Stanford songs. Topped off
by the "National Anthem," it
constituted an exciting prelude
to the game itself. The halftime
performance was helter
skelter, yet often clever and
well planned. Some criticized
the new look in those days, but
many more found it refreshing
and enjoyable.
What we have today is a total
embarrassment. Both before
the game and at halftime, we
witness the spectacle of slop
pily attired students running
around the field, stopping
periodically to play boring
numbers with a beat, each one
sounding identical to the
others. The attempts at humor
are often crude. The crowd is
turned off, completely, by
these performances. Only the
Band announcer and the "Na
tional Anthem" remain as re
deeming features.
Scenes like the Oregon State
game are inexcusable. Rape is
no joke. Only the most imma
ture and uneducated minds
could have found humor in the
comments on the backs of var
ious band members. I can't
understand why any woman
would participate in such a
group.
A few years ago, we tended
to laugh at groups like the USC
band, seemingly totally out of
step with Stanford's relaxed,
fun-loving group. This year, it
was Stanford that everyone

was ridiculing, and with good
reason.
Stanford University is top
quality in every way — its stan
dards, it administration, its fa
culty and its students. The
football team, itself, is top
quality led by the finest coach
in the nation. Stanford stu
dents should demand similar
quality from its Band. That
doesn't mean a return to tin
soldiers prancing around the
field. The early '70s were fun
and respectable.
Do you suppose just once
this year we could hear "Come
loin the Band?" Maybe, we
could even have an organized
spell-out yell without five
cheer leaders*?) throwing
themselves around on the
ground. The team and the stu
dents deserve far better than
they are receiving.

response in order
Regaiding the editorial -
"Give 'em the Axe"
(Daily, Nov. 9), we feel a re
sponse is in order.
Our group has been mis
treated and misrepresented.
An incongruity arises in the
editorial. It opens with the
statement, "This year's troop
of Yell Leaders has failed mis
erably as a source ,of crowd
support at football games. .
and concludes, "The fact of the
matter is that the fans know
when to cheer for thei r football
team."
Does the editorial board be
lieve that crowd support is
necessary or that the fans
should maintain spirit them
selves? What exactly is the
board trying to say? Either
we've failed or our group is
unnecessary, but both these
criticisms cannot be valid at the
same time.
We now realize that yell lead
ing at Stanford is unnecessary.
The fans do not want to be told
what to yell or when to yell it.
But it is unfair to personally at
tack our group as a "failure."

Week after week we have tried
to come up with original skits,
routines and yells, and week
after week we've had little, if
any response. However, since
"the fans know when to cheer
for their football team," it is
doubtful whether a squad
comprised of Cheech and
Chong could have done any
better.
Our group never claimed
yell leading was necessary. We
tried only because we thought
yelling might improve spirit, a
component that has been mis
sing from the sunny side of the
stadium for a number of years.
There is no way to please our
diverse student body. Some
suggest, "Be more traditional.
We need some tradition here."
Others tell us, "Co Wild. Try to
be more like the Band."
We have tried to be innova
tive without imitating the
Band. They are truly "incom
parable," and everyone knows
that, even the Yell Leaders.
There has been an obvious
lack of support from the stu
dents, the Athletic Department
and the Band. The Band has
been uncharacteristically shy
and stand-offish toward us;
unwilling to give us group sup
port before we've "proven
ourselves." This, however, has
been impossible in the face of
their public displays of hostility
toward us.
The student body follows the
Band's example, and dares not
give support to any group
without their keg-encrusted
seal of approval. In order for
yell leading to succeed, the
idea and the squad must have
encouragement from the es
tablished support groups;
namely, the Athletic Depart
ment and the Band. This has
not materialized and we have
be,?n left as sheep in a den of
wolves. It's amazing we've
lasted as long as we have.
The timing of this editorial is
most regretful in light of the
fact that Big Came Week is
upon us. Our group has been
an instrumental part of the Axe
Committee, taking a large
chunk of the week's activities
as our own responsibility. We

sincerely hope that this edito
rial's criticism will not destroy
the one week of spirit that
Stanford observes.
The editorial board, as well
as many students, will be happy
to know we've decided against
cheering at basketball games.
We know we're not wanted.
The question we ask the edito
rial board is would anyone be
sufficient? The personal attack
on this year's Yell Leaders is
most unfair, since we highly
doubt if any group could in
spire the students who adorn
the sunny side of the stadium.
Unfortunately, people seem
to have forgotten that we, too,
are Stanford students, and not
a hired group of antagonizers.
We tried only because we
thought school spirit was
worthwhile, and could evolve
into something enjoyable. Ap
parently, we were wrong. Our
apologies to anyone we've of
fended. There was no offense
intended in our endeavors.

Anxiety about
women's safety
Recent reports and rumors
of the increasing occurrances
of attacks and rapes in the Stan
ford community have inten
sified my anxiety about wo
"men's safety on campus. I my
self resent the loss of choice
implicit in having to alter my
patterns of movement around
campus. Women have taken
the safety of Stanford for
granted for too long, and need
to be reminded conspicuously
of the urgency of the situation.
There are attacks here, and we
must act accordingly.
We have long heard "don't
go to the Quad unescorted
after dark" -and "don't run
alone in the hills at any time,"
but in general, our only source
of current information regard-

ing actual attacks is the
grapevine. This source, how
ever reliable, is slow and often
dismissed as hearsay. We need
immediate, accurate reports of
each attack to insure the safety
of all the women in the com
munity. The Daily is a perfect
medium for such information.
If only a small front page inset
reporting the time and place of
an attack were printed, the
message would be visible and
undeniable.
We women also must take
steps to protect each other.
Don't walk, run or bicycle
alone in deserted areas. Ask a
friend to escort you to your car,
door, etc. Don't walk, run or
ride on unlighted paths after
dark. Above all, if you are at
tacked, report it. if not to the

police, at least to where the in
formation may be passed on to
protect the other women of the
community.
Unless we take pains to help
ourselves and each other, we
may find out too much, too
late.

Band a total
embarassment
As one who thoroughly en
joyed the "new look" Stanford
Band when it first appeared,
I am surprised that I have
reached the point where I must
criticize it strongly. In the early
70s, the band was a hit where
ver it appeared. The two Rose
Bowl performances were
smashing victories over the
pompous Ohio State and
Michigan bands.
In those days, the Band was
clever, fun, creative and
talented. Their pregame calis
thenics and other antics were
entertaining. They followed
with a grand entrance from the
end zone with renditions of the
old Stanford songs. Topped off
by the "National Anthem," it
constituted an exciting prelude
to the game itself. The halftime
performance was helter
skelter, yet often clever and
well planned. Some criticized
the new look in those days, but
many more found it refreshing
and enjoyable.
What we have today is a total
embarrassment. Both before
the game and at halftime, we
witness the spectacle of slop
pily attired students running
around the field, stopping
periodically to play boring
numbers with a beat, each one
sounding identical to the
others. The attempts at humor
are often crude. The crowd is
turned off, completely, by
these performances. Only the
Band announcer and the "Na
tional Anthem" remain as re
deeming features.
Scenes like the Oregon State
game are inexcusable. Rape is
no joke. Only the most imma
ture and uneducated minds
could have found humor in the
comments on the backs of var
ious band members. I can't
understand why any woman
would participate in such a
group.
A few years ago, we tended
to laugh at groups like the USC
band, seemingly totally out of
step with Stanford's relaxed,
fun-loving group. This year, it
was Stanford that everyone

was ridiculing, and with good
reason.
Stanford University is top
quality in every way — its stan
dards, it administration, its fa
culty and its students. The
football team, itself, is top
quality led by the finest coach
in the nation. Stanford stu
dents should demand similar
quality from its Band. That
doesn't mean a return to tin
soldiers prancing around the
field. The early '70s were fun
and respectable.
Do you suppose just once
this year we could hear "Come
loin the Band?" Maybe, we
could even have an organized
spell-out yell without five
cheer leaders*?) throwing
themselves around on the
ground. The team and the stu
dents deserve far better than
they are receiving.

response in order
Regaiding the editorial -
"Give 'em the Axe"
(Daily, Nov. 9), we feel a re
sponse is in order.
Our group has been mis
treated and misrepresented.
An incongruity arises in the
editorial. It opens with the
statement, "This year's troop
of Yell Leaders has failed mis
erably as a source ,of crowd
support at football games. .
and concludes, "The fact of the
matter is that the fans know
when to cheer for thei r football
team."
Does the editorial board be
lieve that crowd support is
necessary or that the fans
should maintain spirit them
selves? What exactly is the
board trying to say? Either
we've failed or our group is
unnecessary, but both these
criticisms cannot be valid at the
same time.
We now realize that yell lead
ing at Stanford is unnecessary.
The fans do not want to be told
what to yell or when to yell it.
But it is unfair to personally at
tack our group as a "failure."

Week after week we have tried
to come up with original skits,
routines and yells, and week
after week we've had little, if
any response. However, since
"the fans know when to cheer
for their football team," it is
doubtful whether a squad
comprised of Cheech and
Chong could have done any
better.
Our group never claimed
yell leading was necessary. We
tried only because we thought
yelling might improve spirit, a
component that has been mis
sing from the sunny side of the
stadium for a number of years.
There is no way to please our
diverse student body. Some
suggest, "Be more traditional.
We need some tradition here."
Others tell us, "Co Wild. Try to
be more like the Band."
We have tried to be innova
tive without imitating the
Band. They are truly "incom
parable," and everyone knows
that, even the Yell Leaders.
There has been an obvious
lack of support from the stu
dents, the Athletic Department
and the Band. The Band has
been uncharacteristically shy
and stand-offish toward us;
unwilling to give us group sup
port before we've "proven
ourselves." This, however, has
been impossible in the face of
their public displays of hostility
toward us.
The student body follows the
Band's example, and dares not
give support to any group
without their keg-encrusted
seal of approval. In order for
yell leading to succeed, the
idea and the squad must have
encouragement from the es
tablished support groups;
namely, the Athletic Depart
ment and the Band. This has
not materialized and we have
be,?n left as sheep in a den of
wolves. It's amazing we've
lasted as long as we have.
The timing of this editorial is
most regretful in light of the
fact that Big Came Week is
upon us. Our group has been
an instrumental part of the Axe
Committee, taking a large
chunk of the week's activities
as our own responsibility. We

sincerely hope that this edito
rial's criticism will not destroy
the one week of spirit that
Stanford observes.
The editorial board, as well
as many students, will be happy
to know we've decided against
cheering at basketball games.
We know we're not wanted.
The question we ask the edito
rial board is would anyone be
sufficient? The personal attack
on this year's Yell Leaders is
most unfair, since we highly
doubt if any group could in
spire the students who adorn
the sunny side of the stadium.
Unfortunately, people seem
to have forgotten that we, too,
are Stanford students, and not
a hired group of antagonizers.
We tried only because we
thought school spirit was
worthwhile, and could evolve
into something enjoyable. Ap
parently, we were wrong. Our
apologies to anyone we've of
fended. There was no offense
intended in our endeavors.
