# Stanford-in-Government program
## Student intern positions offered 
### FRAN MILLER 
Each summer, approximately 100 Uni
versity students intern in Washington.
Their link from campus to the Capitol is
Stanford-in-Government, a 13-year-old
student-run organization.
The group held an open meeting this
week to discuss available governmental
positions, the organization's functions
and its role in the intern application pro
cess.
Stantord-in-Government is "a research
center for congressional internships," ac
cording to )anice Cohn, chairman of its
board of directors.
The group also lobbies for students
seeking internships. Cohn said that func
tion is very important because of students'
limited access to these activities. She
explained that it is easier to become in
volved in Washington while attending East

Coast schools because of their proximity
to the Capitol.
Students here have succeeded, how
ever, in establishing a rapport with Stan
ford alumni in Washington, Cohn said.
Stanford-in-Covernment also holds
political teach-in workshops during spring
quarter, which prepare students for sum
mer jobs in Washington. The group also
sponsors special activities for participants,
such as parties and tours, during their stay.
Although the organization, according to
Cohn, is "not connected with the student
political structure on campus," it has a
representative on the Academic Organiza
tions Board, and is responsible for bring
ing speakers to campus. ,
The group has an office in Rm. 11 of the
Old Firehouse.
Even though internships are difficult to
obtain, some students have been permit

ted to go to Washington two or three
times, Cohn said. Anyone may apply for a
position, she explained, though officials
prefer to hire upperclassmen, because of
their better developed writing skills.
Intern duties include secretarial and of
fice work, research in answering con
stituent mail, analysis of legislation and
writing of position papers.
Cohn, a senior who interned after her
freshman year, admitted that her "whole
interpretation of the decision-making
process was altered" after her "extremely
rewarding experience" in Washington.
Although she said she was "disil
lusioned by some aspects of govern
ment," she left "with a greater under
standing of the intluence of other senators
and congressmen, the party and the con
stituents on decision-makers and the
law-making procedure."
