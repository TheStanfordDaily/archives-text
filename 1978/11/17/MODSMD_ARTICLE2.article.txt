# Boards backed by Hargadon

### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
College boards are the most objec
tive criteria a university has in
evaluating its undergraduateapplica
tions because all applicants take the
same test, Fred Hargadon, dean of
admissions, said on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night.
Hargadon was recently elected
chairman of the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) board of
trustees. He explained that the board
itself has little to do with the actual
make-up of such tests.
"We don't decide on each ques
tion as board," he said. The CEEB
contracts with the Educational Test
ing Service (ETS) to draw up the ac
tual tests, according to Hargadon.
Though ETS is given much advice
concerning the tests, "they have the
experts to make up the tests," he
said.
He added that the role of the board
and its committees is to advise about
the kinds of tests that need to be
developed as well as the content of
those tests. They are also involved in
"smoothing the transition from high
school."
Hargadon praised the develop
ment of standardized entrance
examinations, because it enables
students from poorer schools to
compete with those from the top
schools by offering a standard for
comparison.
Promotes competition
He explained that before the ad
vent of such examinations, the Uni
versity was forced to rely on a good
set of secondary schools for its stu
dents, since it had no way of being
sure students from poorer schools
would be able to compete here.
Hargadon admitted that the tests
do not always accurately reflect the

abilities of a student. "We don't
think that any one test score for any
one student" necessarily corres
ponds to that student's abilities, but
it does offer a reliable guide of the
performance the University can ex
pect from a large group of students,
he said.
Not only do the test scores help
the University to sketch an overall
picture of their applicants, but
specific achievement tests enable
the University to learn about special
talents a student might have that do
not show up on the general tests, he
stated. For example, high achieve
ment test scores in mathematics,
chemistry and physics might offset a
low verbal score on a standardized
test.
Furthermore, he added, these
tests offer "protection against a lousy
teacher or a vindictive one."

Responding tocriticismof the tests
from consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, Hargadon said, "I don't think
Ralph Naderknowsawholelotabout
tests." Nader has criticized the tests
for their failure to measure such
qualities as judgment, wisdom,
motivation and idealism.
Hargadon responded, "They (the
tests) never purport to measure
those (qualities)." He continued, "If
he (Nader) knows of anybody who
can test for that he hasn't told us."
Hargadon explained that it was
easy for Nader to find support for his
condemnation of the tests, because
any test always has half of the stu
dents scoring poorly on it.
All that Nader needs to find is one
discontented test taker in the top half
of the test group, and he has an in
stant majority of discontented test
takers, according to Hargadon.

Moreover, Hargadon said he is not
sure that numbers can measure
these characteristics.
He added that Nader thinks he has
sounded the "death knell" for test
ing.
However, Hargadon said there is
more testing now than ever before,
and more and more schools are be
ginning to use minimal competency
tests as a requirement for gradua
tion.
Not only are the tests being used
for students, but he cited a case
where they were used to test the
competency of some Houston
teachers. "Half of the teachers
flunked that particular test," he said.
Occupational evaluation
He also said that tests are being
used now to evaluate occupational
skills, reducing some of the arbitrary
nature of hiring.
Responding to criticisms that the
tests are culturally biased, Hargadon
said, "They are culturally biased in
that they measure characteristics in
this culture." He said studies done
by CEEB have shown the tests do not
discriminate against racial or
economic groups. He did admit
there is a strong correlation between
income, schooling and test scores,
but added that this is something that
can be taken into account by admis
sions officers.
Commenting on the recent U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in the Bakke
case, which raised questions about
the legality of affirmative action
programs, Hargadon said that except
for the Medical School, he knows of
no changes that have taken place in
the admissions processes in any divi
sion of the school.
He said the University is working
as hard as ever to recruit good minor
ity candidates, and that, in fact, most
able minority students are applying
to selective schools such as Stanford.
The biggest problem that
minorities face, he added, is lack of
proper preparation.
Concerning a letter that he re
cently sent to more than 10,000 high

schools across the country, Harga
don said that his close contact with
faculty here concerning the perfor
mance of incoming students and his
examination of applicants' trans
cripts revealed that they were taking
less challenging programs than pre
vious applicants.
Hargadon said that while other
schools are facing lower enroll
ments, Stanford still has a large can
didate pool. This put the University
in a position to express their con
cerns about the declining quality of
the applicant pool.
The letter urges a strong program
in English, history, sciences and
foreign language for those wishing to
attend college. Hargadon said the
letter is simply a codification of re
sponses made to past inquiries about
the proper college preparatory prog
ram. He said the intent of the letter is
to remind teachers, students and pa
rents of the best preparation for a
college education.
Hargadon said he has yet to re
ceive any negative respohses to the
letter and that his office is currently
receiving requests for 800 additional
copies of the letter every day, pre
sumably to be given to parents, stu
dents, school board members and
other interested individuals.

abilities of a student. "We don't
think that any one test score for any
one student" necessarily corres
ponds to that student's abilities, but
it does offer a reliable guide of the
performance the University can ex
pect from a large group of students,
he said.
Not only do the test scores help
the University to sketch an overall
picture of their applicants, but
specific achievement tests enable
the University to learn about special
talents a student might have that do
not show up on the general tests, he
stated. For example, high achieve
ment test scores in mathematics,
chemistry and physics might offset a
low verbal score on a standardized
test.
Furthermore, he added, these
tests offer "protection against a lousy
teacher or a vindictive one."

Responding tocriticismof the tests
from consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, Hargadon said, "I don't think
Ralph Naderknowsawholelotabout
tests." Nader has criticized the tests
for their failure to measure such
qualities as judgment, wisdom,
motivation and idealism.
Hargadon responded, "They (the
tests) never purport to measure
those (qualities)." He continued, "If
he (Nader) knows of anybody who
can test for that he hasn't told us."
Hargadon explained that it was
easy for Nader to find support for his
condemnation of the tests, because
any test always has half of the stu
dents scoring poorly on it.
All that Nader needs to find is one
discontented test taker in the top half
of the test group, and he has an in
stant majority of discontented test
takers, according to Hargadon.

Moreover, Hargadon said he is not
sure that numbers can measure
these characteristics.
He added that Nader thinks he has
sounded the "death knell" for test
ing.
However, Hargadon said there is
more testing now than ever before,
and more and more schools are be
ginning to use minimal competency
tests as a requirement for gradua
tion.
Not only are the tests being used
for students, but he cited a case
where they were used to test the
competency of some Houston
teachers. "Half of the teachers
flunked that particular test," he said.
Occupational evaluation
He also said that tests are being
used now to evaluate occupational
skills, reducing some of the arbitrary
nature of hiring.
Responding to criticisms that the
tests are culturally biased, Hargadon
said, "They are culturally biased in
that they measure characteristics in
this culture." He said studies done
by CEEB have shown the tests do not
discriminate against racial or
economic groups. He did admit
there is a strong correlation between
income, schooling and test scores,
but added that this is something that
can be taken into account by admis
sions officers.
Commenting on the recent U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in the Bakke
case, which raised questions about
the legality of affirmative action
programs, Hargadon said that except
for the Medical School, he knows of
no changes that have taken place in
the admissions processes in any divi
sion of the school.
He said the University is working
as hard as ever to recruit good minor
ity candidates, and that, in fact, most
able minority students are applying
to selective schools such as Stanford.
The biggest problem that
minorities face, he added, is lack of
proper preparation.
Concerning a letter that he re
cently sent to more than 10,000 high

schools across the country, Harga
don said that his close contact with
faculty here concerning the perfor
mance of incoming students and his
examination of applicants' trans
cripts revealed that they were taking
less challenging programs than pre
vious applicants.
Hargadon said that while other
schools are facing lower enroll
ments, Stanford still has a large can
didate pool. This put the University
in a position to express their con
cerns about the declining quality of
the applicant pool.
The letter urges a strong program
in English, history, sciences and
foreign language for those wishing to
attend college. Hargadon said the
letter is simply a codification of re
sponses made to past inquiries about
the proper college preparatory prog
ram. He said the intent of the letter is
to remind teachers, students and pa
rents of the best preparation for a
college education.
Hargadon said he has yet to re
ceive any negative respohses to the
letter and that his office is currently
receiving requests for 800 additional
copies of the letter every day, pre
sumably to be given to parents, stu
dents, school board members and
other interested individuals.
College boards are the most objec
tive criteria a university has in
evaluating its undergraduateapplica
tions because all applicants take the
same test, Fred Hargadon, dean of
admissions, said on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night.
Hargadon was recently elected
chairman of the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) board of
trustees. He explained that the board
itself has little to do with the actual
make-up of such tests.
"We don't decide on each ques
tion as board," he said. The CEEB
contracts with the Educational Test
ing Service (ETS) to draw up the ac
tual tests, according to Hargadon.
Though ETS is given much advice
concerning the tests, "they have the
experts to make up the tests," he
said.
He added that the role of the board
and its committees is to advise about
the kinds of tests that need to be
developed as well as the content of
those tests. They are also involved in
"smoothing the transition from high
school."
Hargadon praised the develop
ment of standardized entrance
examinations, because it enables
students from poorer schools to
compete with those from the top
schools by offering a standard for
comparison.
Promotes competition
He explained that before the ad
vent of such examinations, the Uni
versity was forced to rely on a good
set of secondary schools for its stu
dents, since it had no way of being
sure students from poorer schools
would be able to compete here.
Hargadon admitted that the tests

stant majority of discontented test
takers, according to Hargadon.

Moreover, Hargadon said he is not
sure that numbers can measure
these characteristics.
He added that Nader thinks he has
sounded the "death knell" for test
ing.
However, Hargadon said there is
more testing now than ever before,
and more and more schools are be
ginning to use minimal competency
tests as a requirement for gradua
tion.
Not only are the tests being used
for students, but he cited a case
where they were used to test the
competency of some Houston
teachers. "Half of the teachers
flunked that particular test," he said.
Occupational evaluation
He also said that tests are being
used now to evaluate occupational
skills, reducing some of the arbitrary
nature of hiring.
Responding to criticisms that the
tests are culturally biased, Hargadon
said, "They are culturally biased in
that they measure characteristics in
this culture." He said studies done
by CEEB have shown the tests do not
discriminate against racial or
economic groups. He did admit
there is a strong correlation between
income, schooling and test scores,
but added that this is something that
can be taken into account by admis
sions officers.
Commenting on the recent U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in the Bakke
case, which raised questions about
the legality of affirmative action
programs, Hargadon said that except
for the Medical School, he knows of
no changes that have taken place in
the admissions processes in any divi
sion of the school.
He said the University is working
as hard as ever to recruit good minor
ity candidates, and that, in fact, most
able minority students are applying
to selective schools such as Stanford.
The biggest problem that
minorities face, he added, is lack of
proper preparation.
Concerning a letter that he re
cently sent to more than 10,000 high

schools across the country, Harga
don said that his close contact with
faculty here concerning the perfor
mance of incoming students and his
examination of applicants' trans
cripts revealed that they were taking
less challenging programs than pre
vious applicants.
Hargadon said that while other
schools are facing lower enroll
ments, Stanford still has a large can
didate pool. This put the University
in a position to express their con
cerns about the declining quality of
the applicant pool.
The letter urges a strong program
in English, history, sciences and
foreign language for those wishing to
attend college. Hargadon said the
letter is simply a codification of re
sponses made to past inquiries about
the proper college preparatory prog
ram. He said the intent of the letter is
to remind teachers, students and pa
rents of the best preparation for a
college education.
Hargadon said he has yet to re
ceive any negative respohses to the
letter and that his office is currently
receiving requests for 800 additional
copies of the letter every day, pre
sumably to be given to parents, stu
dents, school board members and
other interested individuals.
College boards are the most objec
tive criteria a university has in
evaluating its undergraduateapplica
tions because all applicants take the
same test, Fred Hargadon, dean of
admissions, said on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night.
Hargadon was recently elected
chairman of the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) board of
trustees. He explained that the board
itself has little to do with the actual
make-up of such tests.
"We don't decide on each ques
tion as board," he said. The CEEB
contracts with the Educational Test
ing Service (ETS) to draw up the ac
tual tests, according to Hargadon.
Though ETS is given much advice
concerning the tests, "they have the
experts to make up the tests," he
said.
He added that the role of the board
and its committees is to advise about
the kinds of tests that need to be
developed as well as the content of
those tests. They are also involved in
"smoothing the transition from high
school."
Hargadon praised the develop
ment of standardized entrance
examinations, because it enables
students from poorer schools to
compete with those from the top
schools by offering a standard for
comparison.
Promotes competition
He explained that before the ad
vent of such examinations, the Uni
versity was forced to rely on a good
set of secondary schools for its stu
dents, since it had no way of being
sure students from poorer schools
would be able to compete here.
Hargadon admitted that the tests
do not always accurately reflect the

abilities of a student. "We don't
think that any one test score for any
one student" necessarily corres
ponds to that student's abilities, but
it does offer a reliable guide of the
performance the University can ex
pect from a large group of students,
he said.
Not only do the test scores help
the University to sketch an overall
picture of their applicants, but
specific achievement tests enable
the University to learn about special
talents a student might have that do
not show up on the general tests, he
stated. For example, high achieve
ment test scores in mathematics,
chemistry and physics might offset a
low verbal score on a standardized
test.
Furthermore, he added, these
tests offer "protection against a lousy
teacher or a vindictive one."

Responding tocriticismof the tests
from consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, Hargadon said, "I don't think
Ralph Naderknowsawholelotabout
tests." Nader has criticized the tests
for their failure to measure such
qualities as judgment, wisdom,
motivation and idealism.
Hargadon responded, "They (the
tests) never purport to measure
those (qualities)." He continued, "If
he (Nader) knows of anybody who
can test for that he hasn't told us."
Hargadon explained that it was
easy for Nader to find support for his
condemnation of the tests, because
any test always has half of the stu
dents scoring poorly on it.
All that Nader needs to find is one
discontented test taker in the top half
of the test group, and he has an in
stant majority of discontented test
takers, according to Hargadon.

Moreover, Hargadon said he is not
sure that numbers can measure
these characteristics.
He added that Nader thinks he has
sounded the "death knell" for test
ing.
