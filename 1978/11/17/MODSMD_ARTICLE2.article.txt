# Boards backed by Hargadon

College boards are the most objec
tive criteria a university has in
evaluating its undergraduateapplica
tions because all applicants take the
same test, Fred Hargadon, dean of
admissions, said on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night.
Hargadon was recently elected
chairman of the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) board of
trustees. He explained that the board
itself has little to do with the actual
make-up of such tests.
"We don't decide on each ques
tion as board," he said. The CEEB
contracts with the Educational Test
ing Service (ETS) to draw up the ac
tual tests, according to Hargadon.
Though ETS is given much advice
concerning the tests, "they have the
experts to make up the tests," he
said.
He added that the role of the board
and its committees is to advise about
the kinds of tests that need to be
developed as well as the content of
those tests. They are also involved in
"smoothing the transition from high
school."
Hargadon praised the develop
ment of standardized entrance
examinations, because it enables
students from poorer schools to
compete with those from the top
schools by offering a standard for
comparison.
Promotes competition
He explained that before the ad
vent of such examinations, the Uni
versity was forced to rely on a good
set of secondary schools for its stu
dents, since it had no way of being
sure students from poorer schools
would be able to compete here.
Hargadon admitted that the tests
do not always accurately reflect the

abilities of a student. "We don't
think that any one test score for any
one student" necessarily corres
ponds to that student's abilities, but
it does offer a reliable guide of the
performance the University can ex
pect from a large group of students,
he said.
Not only do the test scores help
the University to sketch an overall
picture of their applicants, but
specific achievement tests enable
the University to learn about special
talents a student might have that do
not show up on the general tests, he
stated. For example, high achieve
ment test scores in mathematics,
chemistry and physics might offset a
low verbal score on a standardized
test.
Furthermore, he added, these
tests offer "protection against a lousy
teacher or a vindictive one."

Responding tocriticismof the tests
from consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, Hargadon said, "I don't think
Ralph Naderknowsawholelotabout
tests." Nader has criticized the tests
for their failure to measure such
qualities as judgment, wisdom,
motivation and idealism.
Hargadon responded, "They (the
tests) never purport to measure
those (qualities)." He continued, "If
he (Nader) knows of anybody who
can test for that he hasn't told us."
Hargadon explained that it was
easy for Nader to find support for his
condemnation of the tests, because
any test always has half of the stu
dents scoring poorly on it.
All that Nader needs to find is one
discontented test taker in the top half
of the test group, and he has an in
stant majority of discontented test
takers, according to Hargadon.

Moreover, Hargadon said he is not
sure that numbers can measure
these characteristics.
He added that Nader thinks he has
sounded the "death knell" for test
ing.
However, Hargadon said there is
more testing now than ever before,
and more and more schools are be
ginning to use minimal competency
tests as a requirement for gradua
tion.
Not only are the tests being used
for students, but he cited a case
where they were used to test the
competency of some Houston
teachers. "Half of the teachers
flunked that particular test," he said.
Occupational evaluation
He also said that tests are being
used now to evaluate occupational
skills, reducing some of the arbitrary
