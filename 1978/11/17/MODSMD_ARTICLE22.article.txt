## Cards' aerial circus vs. Bears' long artillery 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The Big Game was not always the
Big Game. There was atime when it
was simply the big game. That was
also a time when football players
travelled to games in horse-drawn
buses and touchdowns were only
worth four points a piece.
"Going into last year's game, I
didn't really know what the Big
Game was," said California
linebacker Ron Hill. "Coming out
of junior college, it was just
another game. I couldn't see why
everyone was so emotionally high.
But after playing in the game I
knew what it was all about."
The Big Game is all about Cal
students painting Hoover Tower
and Stanford students hanging
banners out the Campanile. It is
blue dye in theClawand red graffiti
on SatherGate. It is quick-thinking
Cal students stealing the Axe from
Stanford yell leader Billy Erb in 1899
andthelmmortal 21 stealing it back
in 1930.
The Big Game is class reunions
and fraternity parties. It is tailgate
get-togethers last}ng long after
sunset, come victory or defeat. It is
a celebration of life.
"Many of our players don't know
the impact of the Big Game,"
California coach Roger Theder
said. "I think Stanford has d'-.ne a
much better job of that with its
people than we have with ours in
emphasizing the importance of Big
Game and knowing what it's all ab
out."
It's all about a rivalry which both
transcends and extends athletics. It
is competitive band philosophies
— the straight-lined, straight-laced

Sousaphiles in blue and gold vs.
the free-flowing, drug-induced
rockers in the red vests and Army
Surplus surplus.
It is the exchange of thousands
of dollars in bets between proud
alums who pay off the victor and
get drunk with him after the game.
It is the clash of the press — the
Daily Californian and the Stanford
Daily annually playing touch foot
ball for the treasured Golden
Exacto Blade.
It is pride.
"You can never predict the out
come of the Big Came," said Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh, who, like
Theder, has coached for both
schools in the Big Game. "Some
person on either team, and I don't
know who'll it be or from what
team, will be the Big Game hero.
"In just about every Big Game
I've been involved with there's
been someone who's come off the
bench or played in place of some
one that has made the difference in
the ball game. I suppose that will
be the case this year."
Above all, the BigGameisatradi
tion of great football. The teams
have met 80 times, Stanford win
ning 38, Cal winning 32 and 10
games ending tied. Yet, only two
points separate the two schools,
the Cards tallying 1053, the Bears,
1051.
Thirty-six of the games have
been decided by seven points or
less.
The last three contests at Ber
keley testify to the excitement
which typify the Big Game. In 1972,
the Bears, trailing 21-18, regained
possession of the ball with only

1:13 remaining. Freshman quar
terback Vince Ferragamo drove the
Golden Bears down the field and
with three seconds left hit wide re
ceiver Steve Sweeney in the corner
of the end zone for the winning
TD.
Two years later Cal grabbed a
20-19 lead with 26 secohds left, bOt
Stanford retaliated with a 50-yard
Mike Langford field goal, sending
Stanford fans into paroxysms of Big
Came ecstasy.
With little more than two mi
nutes remaining in the 1976 Big
Came, Stanford defensive end
Duncan McColl snatched a Cal
fumble on the Bears' 2-yard line.
Ron Inge's 2-yard plunge gave
Stanford a 27-24 victory and pro
vided fired Card coach Jack Christ
iansen with abittersweet going
away present.
With Stanford and Cal both 6-4
overall and 3-3 in the Pac-10, to
morrow's 1 p.m. contest in Ber
keley's Memorial Stadium should
be little different than its predeces
sors.
The Big Game has been the
scene of many great aerial shows —
in 1959 Stanford signal caller Dick
Norman set an NCAA record by
completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.
This year the Cards and the Bears
have the No. 2 and No. 3 passing
teams in the nation.
Stanford QB Steve Dils, with 228
completions on 358 passes, leads
the nation in passing. His Califor
nia counterpart, rangy 6-foot-5
sophomore Rich Campbell, has
completed 152 of 260 passes for 13
TDs and a conference-leading 17

interceptions.
Dils throws to the Pac-10's top
three receivers — Phil Francis (49
receptions), Darrin Nelson (46) and
Ken Margerum (46). Margerum has
nine TD catches and 801 receiving
yards.
i Francis, who left the Oregon
State game with a sprained ankle
and did not suit up for USC and
ASU contests, will return to the
starting lineup at fullback tomor
row. Nelson, carried off the field
last week in Tempe with a knee sp
rain, will also start. The sophomore
running back needs 116 more yards
to reach the 1000-yard plateau this
season.
Campbell's favorite target,
fleet-footed wide receiver Holden
Smith, has caught 25 passes for a
scintillating 24.8 yards a reception
and five touchdowns. But Smith,
who has been in and out of the
coaches' doghouse, is not slated
to start tomorrow. Nonetheless, he
gives the Bears an ever-present
threat.
"They stress the long pass at
Cal," Walsh said. "They've hit
some long passes that we haven't.
"Campbell isvery dangerous.
They could beat us just with his
throwing if we're not sharp."
Both teams spurned the pass last
week, however, and went to the
ground to defeat tough conference
rivals.
California beat Washington State
22-14 Saturday as the Bears held
lack Thompson to 12 completions
in 26 throws for a miserly 84 yards.
The Bears put the ball on the
ground to keep it away from the
Throwin' Samoan. Cal fullback

Paul Jones, a senior who has mis
sed his previous three Big Games,
bulled through the WSU defense
for 232 yards on 46 carries.
"He's very powerful," Walsh
said of Jones. "He's big and strong
with a certain amount of mobility.
However, I don't believe he'll
make 232 yards against us."
In the driving rain at Sun Devil
Stadium, Stanford abandoned its
normal aerial free-for-all and sur
prised a blitzing Arizona State de
fense by sending reserve fullback
Jim Brown over the tackles and
ends. Brown garnered 108 yards
and Chevrolet Offensive Player of
the Game honors from ABC-TV.
With Francis back, Brown now a
proven runner and Nelson a con
stant threat, Walsh said he hopes
to have a balanced attack against
California — one which will gain
more than 200 yards in the air and
on the ground.
Walsh said the Big Game seemed
to always have unexpected heroes.
The surprise star in last year's 21-3
Stanford victory was the Cardinal
defense.
Maligned throughout the 1977
season, the Stanford defense
stonewalled the Golden Bears,
holding the visitors to a 48-yard
field goal.
The Cardinal defense has held
opponents to two touchdowns in
the last three weeks and looked
particularly impressive in the loss
to USC and the triumph in Tempe.
All-Coast linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, who missed the USC
game with an injury, returned in
top form last week with 16 tackles.
He leads the Cards with 134 stops.

The other inside linebacker,
sophomore Steve Budinger, has
133 tackles and was named Defen
sive Player of the Game last week.
Budigner leads the team with five
interceptions, including two
against the Sun Devils.
While things are solid up front
for the Cards, two defensive sec
ondary starters were knocked out
wih ankle sprains Saturday. Vete
ran Larry Reynolds will replace Rick
Parker at the right corner. There is
still doubt about whether John
Pigott will be ready to start at the
other corner. If he is not, senior
Savann Thompson will take his
spot.
Linebacker David Shaw leads the
injury-riddled Cal defense with 130
tackles.
Cornerback Anthony
Washington, with six intercep
tions, leads the Cal pass defense,
rated third in the conference by
yielding only 135.0 yards a game.
Both coaches agreed that, in
juries notwithstanding, neither
team would have excuses after the
game.
Walsh, however, surprised some
people earlier in the week by
downplaying the part emotion has
in the game.
"Emotion is involved, but the
execution is the key to it,"he said.
"If we're flat or overlooking some
body, then emotion is a factor. But
when it comes to a game where
both teams are playing the best
they can, it comes down to execu
tion."
The question which remains is
who will be the executioner and
who will get executed.

the ball game. I suppose that will
be the case this year."
Above all, the BigGameisatradi
tion of great football. The teams
have met 80 times, Stanford win
ning 38, Cal winning 32 and 10
games ending tied. Yet, only two
points separate the two schools,
the Cards tallying 1053, the Bears,
1051.
Thirty-six of the games have
been decided by seven points or
less.
The last three contests at Ber
keley testify to the excitement
which typify the Big Game. In 1972,
the Bears, trailing 21-18, regained
possession of the ball with only

1:13 remaining. Freshman quar
terback Vince Ferragamo drove the
Golden Bears down the field and
with three seconds left hit wide re
ceiver Steve Sweeney in the corner
of the end zone for the winning
TD.
Two years later Cal grabbed a
20-19 lead with 26 secohds left, bOt
Stanford retaliated with a 50-yard
Mike Langford field goal, sending
Stanford fans into paroxysms of Big
Came ecstasy.
With little more than two mi
nutes remaining in the 1976 Big
Came, Stanford defensive end
Duncan McColl snatched a Cal
fumble on the Bears' 2-yard line.
Ron Inge's 2-yard plunge gave
Stanford a 27-24 victory and pro
vided fired Card coach Jack Christ
iansen with abittersweet going
away present.
With Stanford and Cal both 6-4
overall and 3-3 in the Pac-10, to
morrow's 1 p.m. contest in Ber
keley's Memorial Stadium should
be little different than its predeces
sors.
The Big Game has been the
scene of many great aerial shows —
in 1959 Stanford signal caller Dick
Norman set an NCAA record by
completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.
This year the Cards and the Bears
have the No. 2 and No. 3 passing
teams in the nation.
Stanford QB Steve Dils, with 228
completions on 358 passes, leads
the nation in passing. His Califor
nia counterpart, rangy 6-foot-5
sophomore Rich Campbell, has
completed 152 of 260 passes for 13
TDs and a conference-leading 17

interceptions.
Dils throws to the Pac-10's top
three receivers — Phil Francis (49
receptions), Darrin Nelson (46) and
Ken Margerum (46). Margerum has
nine TD catches and 801 receiving
yards.
i Francis, who left the Oregon
State game with a sprained ankle
and did not suit up for USC and
ASU contests, will return to the
starting lineup at fullback tomor
row. Nelson, carried off the field
last week in Tempe with a knee sp
rain, will also start. The sophomore
running back needs 116 more yards
to reach the 1000-yard plateau this
season.
Campbell's favorite target,
fleet-footed wide receiver Holden
Smith, has caught 25 passes for a
scintillating 24.8 yards a reception
and five touchdowns. But Smith,
who has been in and out of the
coaches' doghouse, is not slated
to start tomorrow. Nonetheless, he
gives the Bears an ever-present
threat.
"They stress the long pass at
Cal," Walsh said. "They've hit
some long passes that we haven't.
"Campbell isvery dangerous.
They could beat us just with his
throwing if we're not sharp."
Both teams spurned the pass last
week, however, and went to the
ground to defeat tough conference
rivals.
California beat Washington State
22-14 Saturday as the Bears held
lack Thompson to 12 completions
in 26 throws for a miserly 84 yards.
The Bears put the ball on the
ground to keep it away from the
Throwin' Samoan. Cal fullback

Paul Jones, a senior who has mis
sed his previous three Big Games,
bulled through the WSU defense
for 232 yards on 46 carries.
"He's very powerful," Walsh
said of Jones. "He's big and strong
with a certain amount of mobility.
However, I don't believe he'll
make 232 yards against us."
In the driving rain at Sun Devil
Stadium, Stanford abandoned its
normal aerial free-for-all and sur
prised a blitzing Arizona State de
fense by sending reserve fullback
Jim Brown over the tackles and
ends. Brown garnered 108 yards
and Chevrolet Offensive Player of
the Game honors from ABC-TV.
With Francis back, Brown now a
proven runner and Nelson a con
stant threat, Walsh said he hopes
to have a balanced attack against
California — one which will gain
more than 200 yards in the air and
on the ground.
Walsh said the Big Game seemed
to always have unexpected heroes.
The surprise star in last year's 21-3
Stanford victory was the Cardinal
defense.
Maligned throughout the 1977
season, the Stanford defense
stonewalled the Golden Bears,
holding the visitors to a 48-yard
field goal.
The Cardinal defense has held
opponents to two touchdowns in
the last three weeks and looked
particularly impressive in the loss
to USC and the triumph in Tempe.
All-Coast linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, who missed the USC
game with an injury, returned in
top form last week with 16 tackles.
He leads the Cards with 134 stops.

The other inside linebacker,
sophomore Steve Budinger, has
133 tackles and was named Defen
sive Player of the Game last week.
Budigner leads the team with five
interceptions, including two
against the Sun Devils.
While things are solid up front
for the Cards, two defensive sec
ondary starters were knocked out
wih ankle sprains Saturday. Vete
ran Larry Reynolds will replace Rick
Parker at the right corner. There is
still doubt about whether John
Pigott will be ready to start at the
other corner. If he is not, senior
Savann Thompson will take his
spot.
Linebacker David Shaw leads the
injury-riddled Cal defense with 130
tackles.
Cornerback Anthony
Washington, with six intercep
tions, leads the Cal pass defense,
rated third in the conference by
yielding only 135.0 yards a game.
Both coaches agreed that, in
juries notwithstanding, neither
team would have excuses after the
game.
Walsh, however, surprised some
people earlier in the week by
downplaying the part emotion has
in the game.
"Emotion is involved, but the
execution is the key to it,"he said.
"If we're flat or overlooking some
body, then emotion is a factor. But
when it comes to a game where
both teams are playing the best
they can, it comes down to execu
tion."
The question which remains is
who will be the executioner and
who will get executed.

The Big Game was not always the
Big Game. There was atime when it
was simply the big game. That was
also a time when football players
travelled to games in horse-drawn
buses and touchdowns were only
worth four points a piece.
"Going into last year's game, I
didn't really know what the Big
Game was," said California
linebacker Ron Hill. "Coming out
of junior college, it was just
another game. I couldn't see why
everyone was so emotionally high.
But after playing in the game I
knew what it was all about."
The Big Game is all about Cal
students painting Hoover Tower
and Stanford students hanging
banners out the Campanile. It is
blue dye in theClawand red graffiti
on SatherGate. It is quick-thinking
Cal students stealing the Axe from
Stanford yell leader Billy Erb in 1899
andthelmmortal 21 stealing it back
in 1930.
The Big Game is class reunions
and fraternity parties. It is tailgate
get-togethers last}ng long after
sunset, come victory or defeat. It is
a celebration of life.
"Many of our players don't know
the impact of the Big Game,"
California coach Roger Theder
said. "I think Stanford has d'-.ne a
much better job of that with its
people than we have with ours in
emphasizing the importance of Big
Game and knowing what it's all ab
out."
It's all about a rivalry which both
transcends and extends athletics. It
is competitive band philosophies
— the straight-lined, straight-laced

Sousaphiles in blue and gold vs.
the free-flowing, drug-induced
rockers in the red vests and Army
Surplus surplus.
It is the exchange of thousands
of dollars in bets between proud
alums who pay off the victor and
get drunk with him after the game.
It is the clash of the press — the
Daily Californian and the Stanford
Daily annually playing touch foot
ball for the treasured Golden
Exacto Blade.
It is pride.
"You can never predict the out
come of the Big Came," said Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh, who, like
Theder, has coached for both
schools in the Big Game. "Some
person on either team, and I don't
know who'll it be or from what
team, will be the Big Game hero.
"In just about every Big Game
I've been involved with there's
been someone who's come off the
bench or played in place of some
one that has made the difference in
the ball game. I suppose that will
be the case this year."

receptions), Darrin Nelson (46) and
Ken Margerum (46). Margerum has
nine TD catches and 801 receiving
yards.
i Francis, who left the Oregon
State game with a sprained ankle
and did not suit up for USC and
ASU contests, will return to the
starting lineup at fullback tomor
row. Nelson, carried off the field
last week in Tempe with a knee sp
rain, will also start. The sophomore
running back needs 116 more yards
to reach the 1000-yard plateau this
season.
Campbell's favorite target,
fleet-footed wide receiver Holden
Smith, has caught 25 passes for a
scintillating 24.8 yards a reception
and five touchdowns. But Smith,
who has been in and out of the
coaches' doghouse, is not slated
to start tomorrow. Nonetheless, he
gives the Bears an ever-present
threat.
"They stress the long pass at
Cal," Walsh said. "They've hit
some long passes that we haven't.
"Campbell isvery dangerous.
They could beat us just with his
throwing if we're not sharp."
Both teams spurned the pass last
week, however, and went to the
ground to defeat tough conference
rivals.
California beat Washington State
22-14 Saturday as the Bears held
lack Thompson to 12 completions
in 26 throws for a miserly 84 yards.
The Bears put the ball on the
ground to keep it away from the
Throwin' Samoan. Cal fullback

Paul Jones, a senior who has mis
sed his previous three Big Games,
bulled through the WSU defense
for 232 yards on 46 carries.
"He's very powerful," Walsh
said of Jones. "He's big and strong
with a certain amount of mobility.
However, I don't believe he'll
make 232 yards against us."
In the driving rain at Sun Devil
Stadium, Stanford abandoned its
normal aerial free-for-all and sur
prised a blitzing Arizona State de
fense by sending reserve fullback
Jim Brown over the tackles and
ends. Brown garnered 108 yards
and Chevrolet Offensive Player of
the Game honors from ABC-TV.
With Francis back, Brown now a
proven runner and Nelson a con
stant threat, Walsh said he hopes
to have a balanced attack against
California — one which will gain
more than 200 yards in the air and
on the ground.
Walsh said the Big Game seemed
to always have unexpected heroes.
The surprise star in last year's 21-3
Stanford victory was the Cardinal
defense.
Maligned throughout the 1977
season, the Stanford defense
stonewalled the Golden Bears,
holding the visitors to a 48-yard
field goal.
The Cardinal defense has held
opponents to two touchdowns in
the last three weeks and looked
particularly impressive in the loss
to USC and the triumph in Tempe.
All-Coast linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, who missed the USC
game with an injury, returned in
top form last week with 16 tackles.
He leads the Cards with 134 stops.

The other inside linebacker,
sophomore Steve Budinger, has
133 tackles and was named Defen
sive Player of the Game last week.
Budigner leads the team with five
interceptions, including two
against the Sun Devils.
While things are solid up front
for the Cards, two defensive sec
ondary starters were knocked out
wih ankle sprains Saturday. Vete
ran Larry Reynolds will replace Rick
Parker at the right corner. There is
still doubt about whether John
Pigott will be ready to start at the
other corner. If he is not, senior
Savann Thompson will take his
spot.
Linebacker David Shaw leads the
injury-riddled Cal defense with 130
tackles.
Cornerback Anthony
Washington, with six intercep
tions, leads the Cal pass defense,
rated third in the conference by
yielding only 135.0 yards a game.
Both coaches agreed that, in
juries notwithstanding, neither
team would have excuses after the
game.
Walsh, however, surprised some
people earlier in the week by
downplaying the part emotion has
in the game.
"Emotion is involved, but the
execution is the key to it,"he said.
"If we're flat or overlooking some
body, then emotion is a factor. But
when it comes to a game where
both teams are playing the best
they can, it comes down to execu
tion."
The question which remains is
who will be the executioner and
who will get executed.

The Big Game was not always the
Big Game. There was atime when it
was simply the big game. That was
also a time when football players
travelled to games in horse-drawn
buses and touchdowns were only
worth four points a piece.
"Going into last year's game, I
didn't really know what the Big
Game was," said California
linebacker Ron Hill. "Coming out
of junior college, it was just
another game. I couldn't see why
everyone was so emotionally high.
But after playing in the game I
knew what it was all about."
The Big Game is all about Cal
students painting Hoover Tower
and Stanford students hanging
banners out the Campanile. It is
blue dye in theClawand red graffiti
on SatherGate. It is quick-thinking
Cal students stealing the Axe from
Stanford yell leader Billy Erb in 1899
andthelmmortal 21 stealing it back
in 1930.
The Big Game is class reunions
and fraternity parties. It is tailgate
get-togethers last}ng long after
sunset, come victory or defeat. It is
a celebration of life.
"Many of our players don't know
the impact of the Big Game,"
California coach Roger Theder
said. "I think Stanford has d'-.ne a
much better job of that with its
people than we have with ours in
emphasizing the importance of Big
Game and knowing what it's all ab
out."
It's all about a rivalry which both
transcends and extends athletics. It
is competitive band philosophies
— the straight-lined, straight-laced

Sousaphiles in blue and gold vs.
the free-flowing, drug-induced
rockers in the red vests and Army
Surplus surplus.
It is the exchange of thousands
of dollars in bets between proud
alums who pay off the victor and
get drunk with him after the game.
It is the clash of the press — the
Daily Californian and the Stanford
Daily annually playing touch foot
ball for the treasured Golden
Exacto Blade.
It is pride.
"You can never predict the out
come of the Big Came," said Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh, who, like
Theder, has coached for both
schools in the Big Game. "Some
person on either team, and I don't
know who'll it be or from what
team, will be the Big Game hero.
"In just about every Big Game
I've been involved with there's
been someone who's come off the
bench or played in place of some
one that has made the difference in
the ball game. I suppose that will
be the case this year."
Above all, the BigGameisatradi
tion of great football. The teams
have met 80 times, Stanford win
ning 38, Cal winning 32 and 10
games ending tied. Yet, only two
points separate the two schools,
the Cards tallying 1053, the Bears,
1051.
Thirty-six of the games have
been decided by seven points or
less.
The last three contests at Ber
keley testify to the excitement
which typify the Big Game. In 1972,
the Bears, trailing 21-18, regained
possession of the ball with only

1:13 remaining. Freshman quar
terback Vince Ferragamo drove the
Golden Bears down the field and
with three seconds left hit wide re
ceiver Steve Sweeney in the corner
of the end zone for the winning
TD.
Two years later Cal grabbed a
20-19 lead with 26 secohds left, bOt
Stanford retaliated with a 50-yard
Mike Langford field goal, sending
Stanford fans into paroxysms of Big
Came ecstasy.
With little more than two mi
nutes remaining in the 1976 Big
Came, Stanford defensive end
Duncan McColl snatched a Cal
fumble on the Bears' 2-yard line.
Ron Inge's 2-yard plunge gave
Stanford a 27-24 victory and pro
vided fired Card coach Jack Christ
iansen with abittersweet going
away present.
With Stanford and Cal both 6-4
overall and 3-3 in the Pac-10, to
morrow's 1 p.m. contest in Ber
keley's Memorial Stadium should
be little different than its predeces
sors.
The Big Game has been the
scene of many great aerial shows —
in 1959 Stanford signal caller Dick
Norman set an NCAA record by
completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.
This year the Cards and the Bears
have the No. 2 and No. 3 passing
teams in the nation.
Stanford QB Steve Dils, with 228
completions on 358 passes, leads
the nation in passing. His Califor
nia counterpart, rangy 6-foot-5
sophomore Rich Campbell, has
completed 152 of 260 passes for 13
TDs and a conference-leading 17

interceptions.
Dils throws to the Pac-10's top
three receivers — Phil Francis (49
receptions), Darrin Nelson (46) and
Ken Margerum (46). Margerum has
nine TD catches and 801 receiving
yards.

The surprise star in last year's 21-3
Stanford victory was the Cardinal
defense.
Maligned throughout the 1977
season, the Stanford defense
stonewalled the Golden Bears,
holding the visitors to a 48-yard
field goal.
The Cardinal defense has held
opponents to two touchdowns in
the last three weeks and looked
particularly impressive in the loss
to USC and the triumph in Tempe.
All-Coast linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, who missed the USC
game with an injury, returned in
top form last week with 16 tackles.
He leads the Cards with 134 stops.

The other inside linebacker,
sophomore Steve Budinger, has
133 tackles and was named Defen
sive Player of the Game last week.
Budigner leads the team with five
interceptions, including two
against the Sun Devils.
While things are solid up front
for the Cards, two defensive sec
ondary starters were knocked out
wih ankle sprains Saturday. Vete
ran Larry Reynolds will replace Rick
Parker at the right corner. There is
still doubt about whether John
Pigott will be ready to start at the
other corner. If he is not, senior
Savann Thompson will take his
spot.
Linebacker David Shaw leads the
injury-riddled Cal defense with 130
tackles.
Cornerback Anthony
Washington, with six intercep
tions, leads the Cal pass defense,
rated third in the conference by
yielding only 135.0 yards a game.
Both coaches agreed that, in
juries notwithstanding, neither
team would have excuses after the
game.
Walsh, however, surprised some
people earlier in the week by
downplaying the part emotion has
in the game.
"Emotion is involved, but the
execution is the key to it,"he said.
"If we're flat or overlooking some
body, then emotion is a factor. But
when it comes to a game where
both teams are playing the best
they can, it comes down to execu
tion."
The question which remains is
who will be the executioner and
who will get executed.

The Big Game was not always the
Big Game. There was atime when it
was simply the big game. That was
also a time when football players
travelled to games in horse-drawn
buses and touchdowns were only
worth four points a piece.
"Going into last year's game, I
didn't really know what the Big
Game was," said California
linebacker Ron Hill. "Coming out
of junior college, it was just
another game. I couldn't see why
everyone was so emotionally high.
But after playing in the game I
knew what it was all about."
The Big Game is all about Cal
students painting Hoover Tower
and Stanford students hanging
banners out the Campanile. It is
blue dye in theClawand red graffiti
on SatherGate. It is quick-thinking
Cal students stealing the Axe from
Stanford yell leader Billy Erb in 1899
andthelmmortal 21 stealing it back
in 1930.
The Big Game is class reunions
and fraternity parties. It is tailgate
get-togethers last}ng long after
sunset, come victory or defeat. It is
a celebration of life.
"Many of our players don't know
the impact of the Big Game,"
California coach Roger Theder
said. "I think Stanford has d'-.ne a
much better job of that with its
people than we have with ours in
emphasizing the importance of Big
Game and knowing what it's all ab
out."
It's all about a rivalry which both
transcends and extends athletics. It
is competitive band philosophies
— the straight-lined, straight-laced

Sousaphiles in blue and gold vs.
the free-flowing, drug-induced
rockers in the red vests and Army
Surplus surplus.
It is the exchange of thousands
of dollars in bets between proud
alums who pay off the victor and
get drunk with him after the game.
It is the clash of the press — the
Daily Californian and the Stanford
Daily annually playing touch foot
ball for the treasured Golden
Exacto Blade.
It is pride.
"You can never predict the out
come of the Big Came," said Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh, who, like
Theder, has coached for both
schools in the Big Game. "Some
person on either team, and I don't
know who'll it be or from what
team, will be the Big Game hero.
"In just about every Big Game
I've been involved with there's
been someone who's come off the
bench or played in place of some
one that has made the difference in
the ball game. I suppose that will
be the case this year."
Above all, the BigGameisatradi
tion of great football. The teams
have met 80 times, Stanford win
ning 38, Cal winning 32 and 10
games ending tied. Yet, only two
points separate the two schools,
the Cards tallying 1053, the Bears,
1051.
Thirty-six of the games have
been decided by seven points or
less.
The last three contests at Ber
keley testify to the excitement
which typify the Big Game. In 1972,
the Bears, trailing 21-18, regained
possession of the ball with only

1:13 remaining. Freshman quar
terback Vince Ferragamo drove the
Golden Bears down the field and
with three seconds left hit wide re
ceiver Steve Sweeney in the corner
of the end zone for the winning
TD.
Two years later Cal grabbed a
20-19 lead with 26 secohds left, bOt
Stanford retaliated with a 50-yard
Mike Langford field goal, sending
Stanford fans into paroxysms of Big
Came ecstasy.
With little more than two mi
nutes remaining in the 1976 Big
Came, Stanford defensive end
Duncan McColl snatched a Cal
fumble on the Bears' 2-yard line.
Ron Inge's 2-yard plunge gave
Stanford a 27-24 victory and pro
vided fired Card coach Jack Christ
iansen with abittersweet going
away present.
With Stanford and Cal both 6-4
overall and 3-3 in the Pac-10, to
morrow's 1 p.m. contest in Ber
keley's Memorial Stadium should
be little different than its predeces
sors.
The Big Game has been the
scene of many great aerial shows —
in 1959 Stanford signal caller Dick
Norman set an NCAA record by
completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.
This year the Cards and the Bears
have the No. 2 and No. 3 passing
teams in the nation.
Stanford QB Steve Dils, with 228
completions on 358 passes, leads
the nation in passing. His Califor
nia counterpart, rangy 6-foot-5
sophomore Rich Campbell, has
completed 152 of 260 passes for 13
TDs and a conference-leading 17

interceptions.
Dils throws to the Pac-10's top
three receivers — Phil Francis (49
receptions), Darrin Nelson (46) and
Ken Margerum (46). Margerum has
nine TD catches and 801 receiving
yards.
i Francis, who left the Oregon
State game with a sprained ankle
and did not suit up for USC and
ASU contests, will return to the
starting lineup at fullback tomor
row. Nelson, carried off the field
last week in Tempe with a knee sp
rain, will also start. The sophomore
running back needs 116 more yards
to reach the 1000-yard plateau this
season.
Campbell's favorite target,
fleet-footed wide receiver Holden
Smith, has caught 25 passes for a
scintillating 24.8 yards a reception
and five touchdowns. But Smith,
who has been in and out of the
coaches' doghouse, is not slated
to start tomorrow. Nonetheless, he
gives the Bears an ever-present
threat.
"They stress the long pass at
Cal," Walsh said. "They've hit
some long passes that we haven't.
"Campbell isvery dangerous.
They could beat us just with his
throwing if we're not sharp."
Both teams spurned the pass last
week, however, and went to the
ground to defeat tough conference
rivals.
California beat Washington State
22-14 Saturday as the Bears held
lack Thompson to 12 completions
in 26 throws for a miserly 84 yards.
The Bears put the ball on the
ground to keep it away from the
Throwin' Samoan. Cal fullback

Paul Jones, a senior who has mis
sed his previous three Big Games,
bulled through the WSU defense
for 232 yards on 46 carries.
"He's very powerful," Walsh
said of Jones. "He's big and strong
with a certain amount of mobility.
However, I don't believe he'll
make 232 yards against us."
In the driving rain at Sun Devil
Stadium, Stanford abandoned its
normal aerial free-for-all and sur
prised a blitzing Arizona State de
fense by sending reserve fullback
Jim Brown over the tackles and
ends. Brown garnered 108 yards
and Chevrolet Offensive Player of
the Game honors from ABC-TV.
With Francis back, Brown now a
proven runner and Nelson a con
stant threat, Walsh said he hopes
to have a balanced attack against
California — one which will gain
more than 200 yards in the air and
on the ground.
