# The 						day crazy Billy Erb had an Axe-ellent idea
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what this place is,
though, is open for debate.
Billy Erb may have been one of
the most crafty, dedicated men
ever to attend this University —
or he may have been the
biggest imbecile ever to set
foot on campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man responsi
ble for all this Axe-madness.
You see in 1899, he feared Stan
ford was about to blow a
three-game baseball series to
Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound
Axe to a pre-game rally and
amused the crowd by hacking
up a dummy bear. Then Erb,
who was the kind of guy that
would have starred in The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre if he
were around today, took the
axe to the game and spent a
couple hours chopping up
blue and gold ribbons.
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Ber
keley band members with de
capitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game,
9-7, but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of thugs jumped Erb and
the other guardians (including

Erb gave birth to the Axe. He also lost it to the
Weenies. Three decades later the Immortal 21
heisted the Axe back. Stanford cancelled classes
for two days. Then, just five years ago in a

Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and
raced off. They outwitted their
Stanford pursuers — not too
tough if Billy Erb can be consi
dered typical — and got it back
to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been read
ing along and thinking that
Silly Erb was — um, unique —
then brace yourself. Billy Erb
had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. And in any discussion of
great moments of Stanford his
tory, Harry Dutton's name
must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers
got back to their campus, they
held a spontaneous rally. Enter
Harry Dutton, just as dedicated
to God, flag and Stanford as
Billy Erb. Dutton, on horse
back, rode into the middle of
the crowd and suggested to the
Cal men that they hand him the
Axe so that everyone could see
it.
They agreed — but unfortu
nately the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run
away. Luckily, Harry Dutton
was no faint-heart. After the
rally, the Axe was taken to the
Chi Phi fraternity house, and
Dutton turned up there in a
false mustache with a note in
structing the frat men to turn

the Axe over to him so he could
paint it. The painfully naive Cal
students handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no
dummy, despite what you
might think after reading all
this. He did not consider it his
destiny to go down in history as
the man who lost Stanford's
Axe. No sir, not Billy Erb.
So late one night, Chi Phi
men awoke to the gentle
sounds of a battering ram on
their door. Billy Erb was lead
ing a raiding party in a desper
ate last-ditch attempt to regain
the Axe.
Charlie Pringle, Cal's foot
ball captain, saw the group en
ter. He snatched an ancient
army sword from the wall and
snarled, "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs."
Obviously, he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his ear and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house, but they couldn't
find the Axe. Sadder (but prob
ably no wiser) they returned to
the Farm empty-handed. Not
until 1930 would honorand jus-

tice be restored to Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would
be a much different story. Now
the Immortal 21 took over the
quest. For three years they
schemed and plotted. Finally,
on April 3, 1930, they were
ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren
Crange posed as newspaper
photographers promising
fame and fortune to the dim
witted Cal freshmen who were
carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs — the first time
during the long Stanford-Cal
rivalry that anyone ever re
sorted to chemical warfare.
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car and
then headed back for Palo Alto
at a torrid 65 miles per hour.
Other members of the Immor
tal 21 posed as Cal students and
formed search parties to go in
the opposite direction of the
escape route.
It worked. When the Immor
tal 21 got back to campus:
— classes were cancelled for
two days;
— the campus partied all
night;

nostalgic re-enactment of history, the Infamous 3
imitated Cal coach Mike White and recovered the
blessed blade in a restaurant parking lot. Ah, one
longs for that clean college fun.

— the University presented
them with block "S" letters,
the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and
special gold Axe watch charms.
"They have won the
gratitude of every Stanford
alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body applauded.
But the taste of victory
quickly turned bitter. The Stan
ford administration, com
posed of men with brainpans
about the size of Billy Erb's,
signed a pact with Cal, making
the Axe into a trophy going to
the winner of each autumn's
Big Came.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time
to time. But since 1930, only
one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in
the grand tradition of Billy Erb,
Harry Dutton and the Immortal
21.
They called themselves the
Infamous Three. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, they con
cluded that Cal didn't deserve
possession of the Axe for its
last second 24-21 victory in 1972
in a game since known as the
Mud Bowl.
Justice, they concluded,
demanded that the Axe be re-

quick call to the Theta Delt
house and told them to have a.#
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, J
we had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the
theft. "It had only been 30-odd
years since the last theft; and
the Axe was only encased in a ;
nuclear-attack proof case with
an alarm system; and what
should it matter that it was Big
Came Week and the Axe was
the center of attention for the
entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's in
eptitude could lose the Axe
under those circumstances.
And the Bears very nearly '
didn't get it back. The Infam- i
ous Three, feeling very power- J
ftil after such a brazen theft, 1
issued a list of "non- !
negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before the Axe
would be returned.
They included $6000 cash,!
Thanksgiving dinner with Pres- j
ident Lyman, admission to the >
Stanford graduate school of j
their choice and the services of'
Law Prof. John Kaplan as their!
defense counsel.
Billy Erb would have been
proud.

turned to Stanford. So they de
vised a plot to bring it back.
Looking back at the plot, it
seems far too stupid to ever
succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid . That's why
they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claiming to be
Bear coach Mike White and ask
if the Axe could be photo
graphed with two "football
players" at a football writer's
banquet at Ming's in Palo Alto.
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we fi
gured no one else did either,"
said David Suliteanu, a
member of the Infamous
Three. It worked perfectly: the
student union manager agreed
to hand over the Axe. But when
Suliteanu and Tim Conway
showed up in Cal letter jackets,
it turned out Berkeley's Axe
Commission had removed the
Axe.
Conway and Suliteanu gave a
tear-jerking performance to
the student union manager,
who agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe.
And he did, although the
guards insisted it go to Palo
Alto in their car. Matt Conway,

might think after reading all
this. He did not consider it his
destiny to go down in history as
the man who lost Stanford's
Axe. No sir, not Billy Erb.
So late one night, Chi Phi
men awoke to the gentle
sounds of a battering ram on
their door. Billy Erb was lead
ing a raiding party in a desper
ate last-ditch attempt to regain
the Axe.
Charlie Pringle, Cal's foot
ball captain, saw the group en
ter. He snatched an ancient
army sword from the wall and
snarled, "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs."
Obviously, he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his ear and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house, but they couldn't
find the Axe. Sadder (but prob
ably no wiser) they returned to
the Farm empty-handed. Not
until 1930 would honorand jus-

tice be restored to Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would
be a much different story. Now
the Immortal 21 took over the
quest. For three years they
schemed and plotted. Finally,
on April 3, 1930, they were
ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren
Crange posed as newspaper
photographers promising
fame and fortune to the dim
witted Cal freshmen who were
carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs — the first time
during the long Stanford-Cal
rivalry that anyone ever re
sorted to chemical warfare.
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car and
then headed back for Palo Alto
at a torrid 65 miles per hour.
Other members of the Immor
tal 21 posed as Cal students and
formed search parties to go in
the opposite direction of the
escape route.
It worked. When the Immor
tal 21 got back to campus:
— classes were cancelled for
two days;
— the campus partied all
night;

nostalgic re-enactment of history, the Infamous 3
imitated Cal coach Mike White and recovered the
blessed blade in a restaurant parking lot. Ah, one
longs for that clean college fun.

— the University presented
them with block "S" letters,
the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and
special gold Axe watch charms.
"They have won the
gratitude of every Stanford
alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body applauded.
But the taste of victory
quickly turned bitter. The Stan
ford administration, com
posed of men with brainpans
about the size of Billy Erb's,
signed a pact with Cal, making
the Axe into a trophy going to
the winner of each autumn's
Big Came.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time
to time. But since 1930, only
one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in
the grand tradition of Billy Erb,
Harry Dutton and the Immortal
21.
They called themselves the
Infamous Three. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, they con
cluded that Cal didn't deserve
possession of the Axe for its
last second 24-21 victory in 1972
in a game since known as the
Mud Bowl.
Justice, they concluded,
demanded that the Axe be re-

quick call to the Theta Delt
house and told them to have a.#
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, J
we had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the
theft. "It had only been 30-odd
years since the last theft; and
the Axe was only encased in a ;
nuclear-attack proof case with
an alarm system; and what
should it matter that it was Big
Came Week and the Axe was
the center of attention for the
entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's in
eptitude could lose the Axe
under those circumstances.
And the Bears very nearly '
didn't get it back. The Infam- i
ous Three, feeling very power- J
ftil after such a brazen theft, 1
issued a list of "non- !
negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before the Axe
would be returned.
They included $6000 cash,!

turned to Stanford. So they de
vised a plot to bring it back.
Looking back at the plot, it
seems far too stupid to ever
succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid . That's why
they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claiming to be
Bear coach Mike White and ask
if the Axe could be photo
graphed with two "football
players" at a football writer's
banquet at Ming's in Palo Alto.
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we fi
gured no one else did either,"
said David Suliteanu, a
member of the Infamous
Three. It worked perfectly: the
student union manager agreed
to hand over the Axe. But when
Suliteanu and Tim Conway
showed up in Cal letter jackets,
it turned out Berkeley's Axe
Commission had removed the
Axe.
Conway and Suliteanu gave a
tear-jerking performance to
the student union manager,
who agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe.
And he did, although the
guards insisted it go to Palo
Alto in their car. Matt Conway,

Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what this place is,
though, is open for debate.
Billy Erb may have been one of
the most crafty, dedicated men
ever to attend this University —
or he may have been the
biggest imbecile ever to set
foot on campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man responsi
ble for all this Axe-madness.
You see in 1899, he feared Stan
ford was about to blow a
three-game baseball series to
Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound
Axe to a pre-game rally and
amused the crowd by hacking
up a dummy bear. Then Erb,
who was the kind of guy that
would have starred in The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre if he
were around today, took the
axe to the game and spent a
couple hours chopping up
blue and gold ribbons.
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Ber
keley band members with de
capitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game,
9-7, but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of thugs jumped Erb and
the other guardians (including

Erb gave birth to the Axe. He also lost it to the
Weenies. Three decades later the Immortal 21
heisted the Axe back. Stanford cancelled classes
for two days. Then, just five years ago in a

Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and
raced off. They outwitted their
Stanford pursuers — not too
tough if Billy Erb can be consi
dered typical — and got it back
to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been read
ing along and thinking that
Silly Erb was — um, unique —
then brace yourself. Billy Erb
had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. And in any discussion of
great moments of Stanford his
tory, Harry Dutton's name
must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers
got back to their campus, they
held a spontaneous rally. Enter
Harry Dutton, just as dedicated
to God, flag and Stanford as
Billy Erb. Dutton, on horse
back, rode into the middle of
the crowd and suggested to the
Cal men that they hand him the
Axe so that everyone could see
it.
They agreed — but unfortu
nately the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run
away. Luckily, Harry Dutton
was no faint-heart. After the
rally, the Axe was taken to the
Chi Phi fraternity house, and
Dutton turned up there in a
false mustache with a note in
structing the frat men to turn

the Axe over to him so he could
paint it. The painfully naive Cal
students handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no

this. He did not consider it his

turned to Stanford. So they de
vised a plot to bring it back.
Looking back at the plot, it
seems far too stupid to ever
succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid . That's why
they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claiming to be
Bear coach Mike White and ask
if the Axe could be photo
graphed with two "football
players" at a football writer's
banquet at Ming's in Palo Alto.
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we fi
gured no one else did either,"
said David Suliteanu, a
member of the Infamous
Three. It worked perfectly: the
student union manager agreed
to hand over the Axe. But when
Suliteanu and Tim Conway
showed up in Cal letter jackets,
it turned out Berkeley's Axe
Commission had removed the
Axe.
Conway and Suliteanu gave a
tear-jerking performance to
the student union manager,
who agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe.
And he did, although the
guards insisted it go to Palo
Alto in their car. Matt Conway,

Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what this place is,
though, is open for debate.
Billy Erb may have been one of
the most crafty, dedicated men
ever to attend this University —
or he may have been the
biggest imbecile ever to set
foot on campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man responsi
ble for all this Axe-madness.
You see in 1899, he feared Stan
ford was about to blow a
three-game baseball series to
Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound
Axe to a pre-game rally and
amused the crowd by hacking
up a dummy bear. Then Erb,
who was the kind of guy that
would have starred in The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre if he
were around today, took the
axe to the game and spent a
couple hours chopping up
blue and gold ribbons.
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Ber
keley band members with de
capitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game,
9-7, but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of thugs jumped Erb and
the other guardians (including

Erb gave birth to the Axe. He also lost it to the
Weenies. Three decades later the Immortal 21
heisted the Axe back. Stanford cancelled classes
for two days. Then, just five years ago in a

Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and
raced off. They outwitted their
Stanford pursuers — not too
tough if Billy Erb can be consi
dered typical — and got it back
to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been read
ing along and thinking that
Silly Erb was — um, unique —
then brace yourself. Billy Erb
had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. And in any discussion of
great moments of Stanford his
tory, Harry Dutton's name
must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers
got back to their campus, they
held a spontaneous rally. Enter
Harry Dutton, just as dedicated
to God, flag and Stanford as
Billy Erb. Dutton, on horse
back, rode into the middle of
the crowd and suggested to the
Cal men that they hand him the
Axe so that everyone could see
it.
They agreed — but unfortu
nately the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run
away. Luckily, Harry Dutton
was no faint-heart. After the
rally, the Axe was taken to the
Chi Phi fraternity house, and
Dutton turned up there in a
false mustache with a note in
structing the frat men to turn

the Axe over to him so he could
paint it. The painfully naive Cal
students handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no
dummy, despite what you
might think after reading all
this. He did not consider it his
destiny to go down in history as
the man who lost Stanford's
Axe. No sir, not Billy Erb.
So late one night, Chi Phi
men awoke to the gentle
sounds of a battering ram on
their door. Billy Erb was lead
ing a raiding party in a desper
ate last-ditch attempt to regain
the Axe.
Charlie Pringle, Cal's foot
ball captain, saw the group en
ter. He snatched an ancient
army sword from the wall and
snarled, "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs."
Obviously, he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his ear and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house, but they couldn't
find the Axe. Sadder (but prob
ably no wiser) they returned to
the Farm empty-handed. Not
until 1930 would honorand jus-

tice be restored to Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would
be a much different story. Now
the Immortal 21 took over the
quest. For three years they
schemed and plotted. Finally,
on April 3, 1930, they were
ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren
Crange posed as newspaper
photographers promising
fame and fortune to the dim
witted Cal freshmen who were
carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs — the first time
during the long Stanford-Cal
rivalry that anyone ever re
sorted to chemical warfare.
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car and
then headed back for Palo Alto
at a torrid 65 miles per hour.
Other members of the Immor
tal 21 posed as Cal students and
formed search parties to go in
the opposite direction of the
escape route.
It worked. When the Immor
tal 21 got back to campus:
— classes were cancelled for
two days;
— the campus partied all
night;

nostalgic re-enactment of history, the Infamous 3
imitated Cal coach Mike White and recovered the
blessed blade in a restaurant parking lot. Ah, one
longs for that clean college fun.

— the University presented
them with block "S" letters,
the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and
special gold Axe watch charms.
"They have won the
gratitude of every Stanford
alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body applauded.
But the taste of victory
quickly turned bitter. The Stan
ford administration, com
posed of men with brainpans
about the size of Billy Erb's,
signed a pact with Cal, making
the Axe into a trophy going to
the winner of each autumn's
Big Came.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time
to time. But since 1930, only
one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in
the grand tradition of Billy Erb,
Harry Dutton and the Immortal
21.
They called themselves the
Infamous Three. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, they con
cluded that Cal didn't deserve

Billy Erb may have been one of
the most crafty, dedicated men
ever to attend this University —
or he may have been the
biggest imbecile ever to set
foot on campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man responsi
ble for all this Axe-madness.
You see in 1899, he feared Stan
ford was about to blow a
three-game baseball series to
Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound
Axe to a pre-game rally and
amused the crowd by hacking
up a dummy bear. Then Erb,
who was the kind of guy that
would have starred in The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre if he
were around today, took the
axe to the game and spent a
couple hours chopping up
blue and gold ribbons.
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Ber
keley band members with de
capitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game,
9-7, but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of thugs jumped Erb and
the other guardians (including

Erb gave birth to the Axe. He also lost it to the
Weenies. Three decades later the Immortal 21
heisted the Axe back. Stanford cancelled classes
for two days. Then, just five years ago in a

Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and
raced off. They outwitted their
Stanford pursuers — not too
tough if Billy Erb can be consi
dered typical — and got it back
to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been read
ing along and thinking that
Silly Erb was — um, unique —
then brace yourself. Billy Erb
had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. And in any discussion of
great moments of Stanford his
tory, Harry Dutton's name
must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers
got back to their campus, they
held a spontaneous rally. Enter
Harry Dutton, just as dedicated
to God, flag and Stanford as
Billy Erb. Dutton, on horse
back, rode into the middle of
the crowd and suggested to the
Cal men that they hand him the
Axe so that everyone could see
it.
They agreed — but unfortu
nately the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run
away. Luckily, Harry Dutton
was no faint-heart. After the
rally, the Axe was taken to the
Chi Phi fraternity house, and
Dutton turned up there in a
false mustache with a note in
structing the frat men to turn

the Axe over to him so he could
paint it. The painfully naive Cal
students handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no
dummy, despite what you
might think after reading all
this. He did not consider it his
destiny to go down in history as
the man who lost Stanford's
Axe. No sir, not Billy Erb.
So late one night, Chi Phi
men awoke to the gentle
sounds of a battering ram on
their door. Billy Erb was lead
ing a raiding party in a desper
ate last-ditch attempt to regain
the Axe.
Charlie Pringle, Cal's foot
ball captain, saw the group en
ter. He snatched an ancient
army sword from the wall and
snarled, "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs."
Obviously, he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his ear and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house, but they couldn't
find the Axe. Sadder (but prob
ably no wiser) they returned to
the Farm empty-handed. Not
until 1930 would honorand jus-

tice be restored to Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would
be a much different story. Now
the Immortal 21 took over the
quest. For three years they
schemed and plotted. Finally,
on April 3, 1930, they were
ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren
Crange posed as newspaper
photographers promising
fame and fortune to the dim
witted Cal freshmen who were
carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs — the first time
during the long Stanford-Cal
rivalry that anyone ever re
sorted to chemical warfare.
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car and
then headed back for Palo Alto
at a torrid 65 miles per hour.
Other members of the Immor
tal 21 posed as Cal students and
formed search parties to go in
the opposite direction of the
escape route.
It worked. When the Immor
tal 21 got back to campus:
— classes were cancelled for
two days;
— the campus partied all
night;

nostalgic re-enactment of history, the Infamous 3
imitated Cal coach Mike White and recovered the
blessed blade in a restaurant parking lot. Ah, one
longs for that clean college fun.

— the University presented
them with block "S" letters,
the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and
special gold Axe watch charms.
"They have won the
gratitude of every Stanford
alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body applauded.
But the taste of victory
quickly turned bitter. The Stan
ford administration, com
posed of men with brainpans
about the size of Billy Erb's,
signed a pact with Cal, making
the Axe into a trophy going to
the winner of each autumn's
Big Came.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time
to time. But since 1930, only
one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in
the grand tradition of Billy Erb,
Harry Dutton and the Immortal
21.
They called themselves the
Infamous Three. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, they con
cluded that Cal didn't deserve
possession of the Axe for its
last second 24-21 victory in 1972
in a game since known as the
Mud Bowl.
Justice, they concluded,
demanded that the Axe be re-

quick call to the Theta Delt
house and told them to have a.#
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, J
we had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the
theft. "It had only been 30-odd
years since the last theft; and
the Axe was only encased in a ;
nuclear-attack proof case with
an alarm system; and what
should it matter that it was Big
Came Week and the Axe was
the center of attention for the
entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's in
eptitude could lose the Axe
under those circumstances.
And the Bears very nearly '
didn't get it back. The Infam- i
ous Three, feeling very power- J
ftil after such a brazen theft, 1
issued a list of "non- !
negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before the Axe
would be returned.
They included $6000 cash,!

turned to Stanford. So they de
vised a plot to bring it back.
Looking back at the plot, it
seems far too stupid to ever
succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid . That's why
they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claiming to be
Bear coach Mike White and ask
if the Axe could be photo
graphed with two "football
players" at a football writer's
banquet at Ming's in Palo Alto.
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we fi
gured no one else did either,"
said David Suliteanu, a
member of the Infamous
Three. It worked perfectly: the
student union manager agreed
to hand over the Axe. But when
Suliteanu and Tim Conway
showed up in Cal letter jackets,
it turned out Berkeley's Axe
Commission had removed the
Axe.
Conway and Suliteanu gave a
tear-jerking performance to
the student union manager,
who agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe.
And he did, although the
guards insisted it go to Palo
Alto in their car. Matt Conway,
