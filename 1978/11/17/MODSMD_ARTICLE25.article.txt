# Divine prophet foresees winners

The Big Game calls for the Big Man on campus in sooth
saying, prophesizing and other related supernatural,
extra-sensory-perceptical arts. After an extended search
through outer spiritual limits (and much consultation with
theOuija board)we found the obvious perfect predictor for
the final game...or will it be the final game?
Hugh Macdonald, instructor for an Undergraduate Spe
cials course in Parapsychology, divines for us the following
prophesies:
"After adjusting my crystal ball to float at a height of three
inches above my desk, I started the tape recorder and
began an astral incantation to validate my psychic connec
tion with the akashic records: (taped transcript) "Oh power
of the universe, infinite knowledge, let me see clearly! Oh
crystal ball, show me the truth...(s minute pause)...l see
a...ball...players in their shorts...? Oops, I'm forward in
time...
Ah, Arizona State shows tinges of gold ice, referring their
weakness in the Oregon weather and will lose, 7-21.
Let's see, Stanford and Cal. I
see...blue...gold...Hmmmm? This must mean that Stanford
will lose? Auggh! My crystal ball is glowing RED hot.. now
WHITE hot! (15 minute delay, sizzling sounds in the
background, followed by sounds of window breaking and
police sirens. Four Cal students cited, but were unable to
obtain the crystal ball which was too hot to handle.) Unfor
tunately, my ball is out of order, so I don't know how to
interpret my last reading. However, I will proceed with my
backup, a birch twindle-dowser.
UCLA shows a definite strong vibration at 21 Hz, USC
slows it to 14.
Washington and Arizona show no vibration at all! This
may mean a tie, but judging from the moon's position in
Taurus and a quinqunx with Pluto, I feel Arizona will
emerge victorious with either no effort (Taurus) or with
Scc rpionic difficulty (Pluto). I flipped a coin and decided on
a score of 27-7."
