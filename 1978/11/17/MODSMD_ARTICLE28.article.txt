Stanford's soccer playoff
chances, reduc ed to cold ashes
as of Monday morning, have
been rekindled as NCAA offi
cials were in the process of re
considering the Far Western
region's representatives yes
terday.
Originally, four teams had
been chosen to enter the
post-season competition,

based on the decision of a rat
ing committee. The four teams
selected were USF, San lose
State, Santa Clara and
Washington.
However, according to
David Cawood, director of
Public Relations for the NCAA,
San Jose was eliminated from
regional competition forallow
ing an ineligible team member
to represent the school. Speci
fically, the NCAA five-year rule
had been violated, a net upon
realizing the'breach of regula
tions, the scriool turned itself
in. This ineligibility was the

only penalty held against San
Jose.
The NCAA committee was
reviewing the situation yester
day afternoon, and the official
decision arrived at this morn
ing will most likely be one of
two options â€” to leave the
fourth spot unfilled, giving one
team a bye while the remaining
two meet in a playoff, or to fill
the fourth spot with the next
best team.
In the latter case, UC-Santa
Barbara and Stanford are at the
head of the contenders list
based on their overall perfor
mance during the season.
