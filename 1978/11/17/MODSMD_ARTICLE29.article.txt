With the chance of keeping California out of
this year's NCAA championships and a shot at an
undefeated season, the Stanford water polo
team travels to Berkeley tomorrow lor a 10 a.m.
game — the second contest between the two
teams in as many weeks.
The Cards carry a 2i-0-1 record into tomor
row's game — their one tie coming against this
same Cal team in September. Stanford had
beaten the Bears twice this year — 6-5 in the
Irvine tournament and 9-8 last week on a goal by
Doug Burke with five seconds left in the game.
Should the Cards win tomorrow's game, Cal
would drop into a second-place tie with USC in
the Pacific-10 and a playoff between the two
would determine who would go to the nation
als. The Trojans have already beaten the Bears
twice this year.
Stanford, however, has already assured them
selves of a berth in the NCAAs, which will be held
Thanksgiving weekend in Long Beach, and
coach Dante Dettamanti said his Cardinals have
been spending this week,mainly preparing for
the nationals.
"The pressure is off ot us," Dettamanti said,
referring to tomorrow's contest. "The pressure
is on Cal. They're in a must-win situaton so
they're going to be really up for us.

"That doesn't mean we're not going to try to
beat Cal," he continued, "but we're going to be
pretty loose. We want to win the game, but it's
not a do-or-die situation."
Dettamanti said the smaller size of Cal's pool
will force the Cards to make some adjustments
in their game plan.
Defensively, you play more of a pressing
game and try to keep the ball out of the hole,
Dettamanti explained. "On offense, the small
pool takes away our counter-attack, so we II
have to look for the quick counter."
According to Dettamanti, the timing is diffe
rent also. He said that tomorrow's game will
probably have more shooting because there will
be more time to shoot. Because less time will be
needed to move the ball down the length of the
pool, "we can be more patient and work for the
better shot," said Dettamanti.
Should the Bears triumph tomorrow, both
teams will be off to Long Beach next week and
will very likely play each other again — in the
finals of the NCAAs. But Dettamanti said the out
come of tomorrow's game will have little effect
on either team's play in the nationals.
"We've already got the confidence," he said.
"For us to lose one game before the nationals
isn't that big a deal."

game — the second contest between the two
teams in as many weeks.
The Cards carry a 2i-0-1 record into tomor
row's game — their one tie coming against this
same Cal team in September. Stanford had
beaten the Bears twice this year — 6-5 in the
Irvine tournament and 9-8 last week on a goal by
Doug Burke with five seconds left in the game.
Should the Cards win tomorrow's game, Cal
would drop into a second-place tie with USC in
the Pacific-10 and a playoff between the two
would determine who would go to the nation
als. The Trojans have already beaten the Bears
twice this year.
Stanford, however, has already assured them
selves of a berth in the NCAAs, which will be held
Thanksgiving weekend in Long Beach, and
coach Dante Dettamanti said his Cardinals have
been spending this week,mainly preparing for
the nationals.
"The pressure is off ot us," Dettamanti said,
referring to tomorrow's contest. "The pressure
is on Cal. They're in a must-win situaton so
they're going to be really up for us.

"That doesn't mean we're not going to try to
beat Cal," he continued, "but we're going to be
pretty loose. We want to win the game, but it's
not a do-or-die situation."
Dettamanti said the smaller size of Cal's pool
will force the Cards to make some adjustments
in their game plan.
Defensively, you play more of a pressing
game and try to keep the ball out of the hole,
Dettamanti explained. "On offense, the small
pool takes away our counter-attack, so we II
have to look for the quick counter."
According to Dettamanti, the timing is diffe
rent also. He said that tomorrow's game will
probably have more shooting because there will
be more time to shoot. Because less time will be
needed to move the ball down the length of the
pool, "we can be more patient and work for the
better shot," said Dettamanti.
Should the Bears triumph tomorrow, both
teams will be off to Long Beach next week and
will very likely play each other again — in the
finals of the NCAAs. But Dettamanti said the out
come of tomorrow's game will have little effect
on either team's play in the nationals.
"We've already got the confidence," he said.
"For us to lose one game before the nationals
isn't that big a deal."
