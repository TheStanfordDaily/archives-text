# Cops roast weenies in crime spree
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Nearly 20 UC-Berkeley students
have been apprehended this week
attempting to vandalize the campus
here or the surrounding area, ac
cording to Department of Public
Safety Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington said the Cal students'
activities have ranged from stealing
street signs to sawing through the
supports on the tower which the
LS)UMB drum major uses in rehear
sals. Herrington said he thought that
the suspects may have been intent
on stealing the tower.
Herrington said there have been
more incidents this year than there
have been over the last several years,
but he added that one reason for this

might be that "this year we've been
catching most of them."
"They tend to come around in the
wee hours of the morning when it's
obvious they're up to something,"
he said. He also said his officers are
becoming more skilled at "knowing
where to look" for potential Cal van
dals.
Herrington said these situations
have been occurring almost
nightly. Wednesday at 3:30 a.m. six
Cal fraternity men were ap
prehended with several street signs.
At the time of their capture, Her
rington said, they were busy looking
for more.
Only 20 minutes later, four more
students were caught. They hadn't
yet had an opportunity to do any

thing, Herrington said, but he said
they confessed they were hoping to
"bring back some souvenirs."
Herrington said most of the van
dals had not done anything "too ter
rible." Several students were caught
painting the sidewalk in front of the
church, but luckily they used water
soluble paints and were able to clean
up the mess.
The most expensive prank so far
has been the attempt to steal the Axe
two weeks ago, Herrington said. It
will cost about $300 to repair the case
damaged in the unsuccessful en
deavor.
Herrington said that generally,
those pranksters who are caught are
either let off orasked to do commun
ity work instead of being punished
for their misdeeds.
