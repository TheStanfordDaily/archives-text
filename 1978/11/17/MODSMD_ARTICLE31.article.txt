# Thrupp runs into the nationals
## 
### 
Senior Ann Thrupp shoots
for a third straight All-America
honor in the AIAW National
Cross Country Championships
Saturday at a mile-high altitude
in Colorado. The 5000-meter
race will be run in Englewood,
a suburb of Denver, which is
5200 feet above sea level.
Thrupp, one of the 247 en
trants in the event and Stan
ford's lone qualifier, could be
at a distinct advantage in the
field. A product of Santa Ana,
she spent the entire summer of
1977 training and running road
races in Denver.
"The altitude will definitely
have an effect on how the race
will be run," said Cardinal
coach Laurel Treon who will
accompany Thrupp to Col
orado. "The strategy in a high
altitude situation will be the
key. Ann does have a feel of
what her capabilities are in the
setting."
Thrupp is highly experi
enced in national competition
which will be another factor in
her favor this weekend, Treon
said. A two-time All-America,

Thrupp placed 11th in the
AIAW Nationals in 1977 and
15th in 1976. This fall she set a
Stanford 5000 meter record at
18:41, and went on to take
eighth in the tough District 8
regional meet.
"Ann has made excellent
progress this season, evi
denced by her high finish in a
very competitive regional
field," said Treon. "She should
be peaking at the nationals.
"Being a two-time All-
America is definitely in her
favor in terms of the experi
ence it's given her."
In order to repeat as an All-
America, Thrupp needs to
finish in the top 15 — a feat
which is becoming more dif
ficult each year with the in
creased interest in cross coun
try.
"Due to the unbelievable
progress in women's intercol
legiate competition, this will
be the toughest field Ann's
faced," said Treon. "But her
experience gives her a good
shot at reaching All-America
for the third time."

Griffins moved
Supporters of the Griff in-for-mascot cause now have their own representation of the lion-eagle beast on
campus. Instrumental in the decision to move the two statues of the mythological beast from the sticks
behind Children's Hospital to the doors of Encina Gym were Cardinal tight end Mitch Pleis and running
back Gordy Banks. "We wanted them on campus to expose people to them," said Pleis. "We're not
necessarily pushing the mascot." The Stanford Historical Society paid for the transportation of the huge
beasts that are currently painted blue and gold as a remnant of long-ago Big Game practical joking
Restoration of the surface of the Griffin statues is being looked into.

have an effect on how the race
will be run," said Cardinal
coach Laurel Treon who will
accompany Thrupp to Col
orado. "The strategy in a high
altitude situation will be the
key. Ann does have a feel of
what her capabilities are in the
setting."
Thrupp is highly experi
enced in national competition
which will be another factor in
her favor this weekend, Treon
said. A two-time All-America,

Thrupp placed 11th in the
AIAW Nationals in 1977 and
15th in 1976. This fall she set a
Stanford 5000 meter record at
18:41, and went on to take
eighth in the tough District 8
regional meet.
"Ann has made excellent
progress this season, evi
denced by her high finish in a
very competitive regional
field," said Treon. "She should
be peaking at the nationals.
"Being a two-time All-
America is definitely in her
favor in terms of the experi
ence it's given her."
In order to repeat as an All-
America, Thrupp needs to
finish in the top 15 — a feat
which is becoming more dif
ficult each year with the in
creased interest in cross coun
try.
"Due to the unbelievable
progress in women's intercol
legiate competition, this will
be the toughest field Ann's
faced," said Treon. "But her
experience gives her a good
shot at reaching All-America
for the third time."

Ann Thrupp is the sole Cardinal representative at the AIAW cross
country nationals being held in Colorado. Although the altitude of
the area may have an effect on the outcome of the . ace, Thrupp, who
trained for a summer in Colorado, is used to it.
Senior Ann Thrupp shoots
for a third straight All-America
honor in the AIAW National
Cross Country Championships
Saturday at a mile-high altitude
in Colorado. The 5000-meter
race will be run in Englewood,
a suburb of Denver, which is
5200 feet above sea level.
Thrupp, one of the 247 en
trants in the event and Stan
ford's lone qualifier, could be
at a distinct advantage in the
field. A product of Santa Ana,
she spent the entire summer of
1977 training and running road
races in Denver.
"The altitude will definitely
have an effect on how the race
will be run," said Cardinal
coach Laurel Treon who will
