The 1978 Stanford women's volleyball team, after a long and
somewhat disappointing season, is playing what looks like its
last game tonight. It plays the Fresno State Bulldogs on the
road. The women spikers have had a series of upsand downs with
the regional committee but last Friday's loss to University of
Pacific all but destroyed any hopes of a regional berth for Stan
ford. They have played well all year but the probability of no
post-season play is frustrating for such a tenacious team.
"Tonight's game is pretty much of a mismatch" said coach Fred
Sturm, "but it's probably our last one and it'll be emotional."
It will be especially emotional for seniors Liz Hughes, Shawn
Hoover and Carol Meihaus, who are all finishing strong careers at
Stanford. They have led the team with gusto and will be missed.
The Cards will be ready for this one. According to Sturm, "The
Bulldogs can be tough." Most importantly though, a final NCAC
win would put the right cap on a good season.
Stanford was holding a 12-6-1 record going into last night's
game, including the UCLA tournament.
