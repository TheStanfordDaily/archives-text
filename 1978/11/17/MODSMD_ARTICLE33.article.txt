## Berkeley's best: exotic, interesting dining 
### 
BALABOSTA
Corner of University & 6th St.
Berkeley
Daily from 1: 30
548-0300
Balabosta is a special re
staurant with a sophisticated
yet casual atmosphere.
One notices the attention to
detail, such as professional
service, a house wine with its
own label and African violets
on each table.
The menu is both innovative
and exotic, and reflects the en
thusiasm and knowledge of the
owner, Sandi Beech.
Beech is justifiably proud of
her food. Everything sampled
was beautifully prepared and
in generous quantity.
Six quiches are offered daily,
including a Quiche of the Black
Swan and a Godzilla the Hun
Quiche, with spinach, herbs
and Gorgonzola cheese.
If one can speak of the
"honesty" in food, one can do
so of Balabosta. And without
pretension.
Of the hors d'oeuvres, pass
up the Baked Clams for the
Smoked Fish (incredible
smoked trout), or the gar
nished Steak Tartare (Yes,
that's raw ground beef. And
yes, it is great). Furthermore.,
the Sicilian Army Antipasto
($3.95) will satisfy a battalion of
at least six. It is a veritable
pyramid of cheese, marinated
mushrooms and artichokes,
and fresh vegetables.
Entrees are served with
either a mixed green salad or
"Ask the Waiter" soupe (soup
du jour). The Clam Chowder
($.95 a la carte) was of delicate
taste and consistency, but suf
fered from its lukewarm-ness.
Standout entrees include the
succulent Magic Mushrooms
($4.95) in cream and sherry nut-

It's the Campanile, Telegraph Avenue and
27,000 college students at the University
of California. And now food.
Once characterized by sandwich bars run
by anarchist collectives, Berkeley dining
is in its Golden Age. France, Lebanon,
Poland and Peru are all represented in the

ted brown rice; a fine Rainbow
Trout ($6.95); fresh Poached
Salmon with Hollandaise
($7.95; a superb Rock Cornish
Game Hen ($6.95) and Eastern
Mussels, done in the classic
French way (white wine, on
ions, butter). Their mushiness,
I think, tended to reflect the
season rather than the prepara
tion.
Each day, Balabosta presents
a different smoked fowl. The
menu refers to the "plain, old
fashioned time and painstak
ing care" given to food pre
pared in the Balabosta
smokehouse. The Smoked
Fresh Chicken was sublime.
Any of the desserts provide
an arousing finale that make a
great meal. While Transylvania
Rumcake ($1.50) and the
cheesecake are luxuriant and
fattening, a delicate Tortoni
(Italian ice cream, sherry, al
monds, $1.50) and individual
Baked Alaskas ($1.75) are much
lighter, but fattening. A choco
late mousse, billed as the
"World's Heaviest," is so di
vine that one will be tempted
to devour the dish in which it is
presented. In this case, the act
is permitted, for the bowl con-

sists of bitter-sweet chocolate.
Avocado and Camembert
mousse are featured as well.
Balabosta is well worth a visit
after Big Game or anytime
given the quality and portions
of the food. Prices are not un
reasonable, and you would be
hard-pressed to find a restaur
ant as interesting.

WARSZAWA
1730 Shattuck Ave. Berkeley
Phone: (415)-841-5539
If it's Tuesday it must be Bel
gium, and if it's Saturday it
must be...Poland? Hey, wait a
minute, the Big Game's on
Saturday, and it's in Berkeley,
not Poland.
We know that, but we're not
talking about Saturday day,
we're talking about Saturday
night, after the game, when
you're hungry, ready for din
ner, and maybe ready to dis
cover what Berkeley's slice of
Poland is all about.
The Warszawa restaurant on
Shattuck Avenue, a 15- to 20-
minute walk from the stadium,
manages to escape the health
food syndrome typical of many
— too many — Berkeley re
staurants. Peace, love and
macrame are not the central
themes here.
Red table cloths, white
washed brick walls, and the
use of colorful folk art create a
warm and peasant-like atmos
phere. The hearty fare and re
laxed pace makes Warszawa
popular with families, grand
parents and younger couples.
The menu is a la carte and
features traditional Polish re
cipes. Prices are reasonable
and don't preclude trying dis
hes like the Warszawa salads
($.90), a tangy combination of
sauerkraut, apples and carrots,
or the Borszcsz ($1.45), a hot
winter soup. The soup, with its
chunky beet stock, fresh
greens, parsley and dill, was
more than a simple imitation of
its Russian counterpart, the
borscht.
With names like Zrazy,
Kaczka, and Bigos, there's no
thing common about the eight
different entrees listed on the
menu. Portions are large; the
Kaczka is literally half a duckl
ing, roasted and served with
baked sour apples and cinam
mon. The meat is exceptionally
moist and tender, and is a favo
rite among Warszawa's pat
rons.
Bigos, a sauerkraut-based
stew with beef, pork, sausage
and bacon is $6.25. This na

tional dish accents the flavor
and seasoning of its meat,
without getting lost in a heavy
cream sauce.
Other items include crepes
stuffed with meat and mus
hrooms, and Pierogi ($6), fluffy
tart-like shells filled with beef,
cheese and mushrooms and
cooked in butter and topped
with sour cream.
The desserts easily match the
quality of the other courses. A
walnut torte soaked in rum and
Nalesnik, a sweet crepe with
strawberry sour cream, are
both good choices.
The homemade cheesecake
is excellent, but the Kawa
Mrozona, an iced coffee de
ssert, is surprisingly tasteless.
Beverages include two im
ported beers and a homemade
fruit drink. Coffee is French
roast and very good. The wine
selection emphasizes moder
ately priced European wines
and offers only three California
labels.
Warszawa is not a student
hangout, but it is a place Stan
ford students can enjoy. After
spending Big Game with 20,000
screaming students, Warszawa
could be just for you.

SPENGER'S FISH GROTTO
1919 4th ST.
Berkeley
845-7771
Spenger's Fish Grotto, on
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
had a capacity crowd last Friday
night. This is apparently the
case every other night as well.
Waits of up to two hours are
not uncommon. However,
why anyone would wait that
long to eat there is another
matter.
The restaurant consists of
several large dining rooms with
a bar in each. Tables are so
close together that the waiters
often have to squeeze by,
which is disconcerting if one is
trying to drink. An unbelieva
ble racket characterizes the
atmosphere. Conversing with
someone across a two-foot
table necessitates shouting.
Place settings were dropped
onto the table. The waiter ap
peared three times in five mi
nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701
548-7880
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory
celebration at an affordable
price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition
to the Stanford area.

Baked Alaskas ($1.75) are much

Balabosta is well worth a visit

If it's Tuesday it must be Bel
gium, and if it's Saturday it
must be...Poland? Hey, wait a
minute, the Big Game's on
Saturday, and it's in Berkeley,
not Poland.
We know that, but we're not
talking about Saturday day,
we're talking about Saturday
night, after the game, when
you're hungry, ready for din
ner, and maybe ready to dis
cover what Berkeley's slice of
Poland is all about.
The Warszawa restaurant on
Shattuck Avenue, a 15- to 20-
minute walk from the stadium,
manages to escape the health
food syndrome typical of many
— too many — Berkeley re
staurants. Peace, love and
macrame are not the central
themes here.
Red table cloths, white
washed brick walls, and the
use of colorful folk art create a
warm and peasant-like atmos
phere. The hearty fare and re
laxed pace makes Warszawa
popular with families, grand
parents and younger couples.
The menu is a la carte and
features traditional Polish re
cipes. Prices are reasonable
and don't preclude trying dis
hes like the Warszawa salads
($.90), a tangy combination of
sauerkraut, apples and carrots,
or the Borszcsz ($1.45), a hot
winter soup. The soup, with its
chunky beet stock, fresh
greens, parsley and dill, was
more than a simple imitation of
its Russian counterpart, the
borscht.
With names like Zrazy,
Kaczka, and Bigos, there's no
thing common about the eight
different entrees listed on the
menu. Portions are large; the
Kaczka is literally half a duckl
ing, roasted and served with
baked sour apples and cinam
mon. The meat is exceptionally
moist and tender, and is a favo
rite among Warszawa's pat
rons.
Bigos, a sauerkraut-based
stew with beef, pork, sausage
and bacon is $6.25. This na

tional dish accents the flavor
and seasoning of its meat,
without getting lost in a heavy
cream sauce.
Other items include crepes
stuffed with meat and mus
hrooms, and Pierogi ($6), fluffy
tart-like shells filled with beef,
cheese and mushrooms and
cooked in butter and topped
with sour cream.
The desserts easily match the
quality of the other courses. A
walnut torte soaked in rum and
Nalesnik, a sweet crepe with
strawberry sour cream, are
both good choices.
The homemade cheesecake
is excellent, but the Kawa
Mrozona, an iced coffee de
ssert, is surprisingly tasteless.
Beverages include two im
ported beers and a homemade
fruit drink. Coffee is French
roast and very good. The wine
selection emphasizes moder
ately priced European wines
and offers only three California
labels.
Warszawa is not a student
hangout, but it is a place Stan
ford students can enjoy. After
spending Big Game with 20,000
screaming students, Warszawa
could be just for you.

SPENGER'S FISH GROTTO
1919 4th ST.
Berkeley
845-7771
Spenger's Fish Grotto, on
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
had a capacity crowd last Friday
night. This is apparently the
case every other night as well.
Waits of up to two hours are
not uncommon. However,
why anyone would wait that
long to eat there is another
matter.
The restaurant consists of
several large dining rooms with
a bar in each. Tables are so
close together that the waiters
often have to squeeze by,
which is disconcerting if one is
trying to drink. An unbelieva
ble racket characterizes the
atmosphere. Conversing with
someone across a two-foot
table necessitates shouting.
Place settings were dropped
onto the table. The waiter ap
peared three times in five mi
nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701

11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory

price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition

If it's Tuesday it must be Bel
gium, and if it's Saturday it
must be...Poland? Hey, wait a
minute, the Big Game's on
Saturday, and it's in Berkeley,
not Poland.
We know that, but we're not
talking about Saturday day,
we're talking about Saturday
night, after the game, when
you're hungry, ready for din
ner, and maybe ready to dis
cover what Berkeley's slice of
Poland is all about.
The Warszawa restaurant on
Shattuck Avenue, a 15- to 20-
minute walk from the stadium,
manages to escape the health
food syndrome typical of many
— too many — Berkeley re
staurants. Peace, love and
macrame are not the central
themes here.
Red table cloths, white
washed brick walls, and the
use of colorful folk art create a
warm and peasant-like atmos
phere. The hearty fare and re
laxed pace makes Warszawa
popular with families, grand
parents and younger couples.
The menu is a la carte and
features traditional Polish re
cipes. Prices are reasonable
and don't preclude trying dis
hes like the Warszawa salads
($.90), a tangy combination of
sauerkraut, apples and carrots,
or the Borszcsz ($1.45), a hot
winter soup. The soup, with its
chunky beet stock, fresh
greens, parsley and dill, was
more than a simple imitation of
its Russian counterpart, the
borscht.
With names like Zrazy,
Kaczka, and Bigos, there's no
thing common about the eight
different entrees listed on the
menu. Portions are large; the
Kaczka is literally half a duckl
ing, roasted and served with
baked sour apples and cinam
mon. The meat is exceptionally
moist and tender, and is a favo
rite among Warszawa's pat
rons.
Bigos, a sauerkraut-based
stew with beef, pork, sausage
and bacon is $6.25. This na

tional dish accents the flavor
and seasoning of its meat,
without getting lost in a heavy
cream sauce.
Other items include crepes
stuffed with meat and mus
hrooms, and Pierogi ($6), fluffy
tart-like shells filled with beef,
cheese and mushrooms and
cooked in butter and topped
with sour cream.
The desserts easily match the
quality of the other courses. A
walnut torte soaked in rum and
Nalesnik, a sweet crepe with
strawberry sour cream, are
both good choices.
The homemade cheesecake
is excellent, but the Kawa
Mrozona, an iced coffee de
ssert, is surprisingly tasteless.
Beverages include two im
ported beers and a homemade
fruit drink. Coffee is French
roast and very good. The wine
selection emphasizes moder
ately priced European wines
and offers only three California
labels.
Warszawa is not a student
hangout, but it is a place Stan
ford students can enjoy. After
spending Big Game with 20,000
screaming students, Warszawa
could be just for you.

SPENGER'S FISH GROTTO
1919 4th ST.
Berkeley
845-7771
Spenger's Fish Grotto, on
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
had a capacity crowd last Friday
night. This is apparently the
case every other night as well.
Waits of up to two hours are
not uncommon. However,
why anyone would wait that
long to eat there is another
matter.
The restaurant consists of
several large dining rooms with
a bar in each. Tables are so
close together that the waiters
often have to squeeze by,
which is disconcerting if one is
trying to drink. An unbelieva
ble racket characterizes the
atmosphere. Conversing with
someone across a two-foot
table necessitates shouting.
Place settings were dropped
onto the table. The waiter ap
peared three times in five mi
nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701
548-7880
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory
celebration at an affordable
price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition
to the Stanford area.

Balabosta is a special re
staurant with a sophisticated
yet casual atmosphere.
One notices the attention to
detail, such as professional
service, a house wine with its
own label and African violets
on each table.
The menu is both innovative
and exotic, and reflects the en
thusiasm and knowledge of the
owner, Sandi Beech.
Beech is justifiably proud of
her food. Everything sampled
was beautifully prepared and
in generous quantity.
Six quiches are offered daily,
including a Quiche of the Black
Swan and a Godzilla the Hun
Quiche, with spinach, herbs
and Gorgonzola cheese.
If one can speak of the
"honesty" in food, one can do
so of Balabosta. And without
pretension.
Of the hors d'oeuvres, pass
up the Baked Clams for the
Smoked Fish (incredible
smoked trout), or the gar

that's raw ground beef. And
yes, it is great). Furthermore.,
the Sicilian Army Antipasto
($3.95) will satisfy a battalion of
at least six. It is a veritable
pyramid of cheese, marinated
mushrooms and artichokes,
and fresh vegetables.
Entrees are served with
either a mixed green salad or
"Ask the Waiter" soupe (soup
du jour). The Clam Chowder
($.95 a la carte) was of delicate
taste and consistency, but suf
fered from its lukewarm-ness.
Standout entrees include the

Trout ($6.95); fresh Poached
Salmon with Hollandaise

Mussels, done in the classic
French way (white wine, on

I think, tended to reflect the
season rather than the prepara

Each day, Balabosta presents
a different smoked fowl. The
menu refers to the "plain, old

minute, the Big Game's on
Saturday, and it's in Berkeley,
not Poland.
We know that, but we're not
talking about Saturday day,
we're talking about Saturday
night, after the game, when
you're hungry, ready for din
ner, and maybe ready to dis
cover what Berkeley's slice of
Poland is all about.
The Warszawa restaurant on
Shattuck Avenue, a 15- to 20-
minute walk from the stadium,
manages to escape the health
food syndrome typical of many
— too many — Berkeley re
staurants. Peace, love and
macrame are not the central
themes here.
Red table cloths, white
washed brick walls, and the
use of colorful folk art create a
warm and peasant-like atmos
phere. The hearty fare and re
laxed pace makes Warszawa
popular with families, grand
parents and younger couples.
The menu is a la carte and
features traditional Polish re
cipes. Prices are reasonable
and don't preclude trying dis
hes like the Warszawa salads
($.90), a tangy combination of
sauerkraut, apples and carrots,
or the Borszcsz ($1.45), a hot
winter soup. The soup, with its
chunky beet stock, fresh
greens, parsley and dill, was
more than a simple imitation of
its Russian counterpart, the
borscht.
With names like Zrazy,
Kaczka, and Bigos, there's no
thing common about the eight
different entrees listed on the
menu. Portions are large; the
Kaczka is literally half a duckl
ing, roasted and served with
baked sour apples and cinam
mon. The meat is exceptionally
moist and tender, and is a favo
rite among Warszawa's pat
rons.
Bigos, a sauerkraut-based
stew with beef, pork, sausage
and bacon is $6.25. This na

tional dish accents the flavor
and seasoning of its meat,
without getting lost in a heavy
cream sauce.
Other items include crepes
stuffed with meat and mus
hrooms, and Pierogi ($6), fluffy
tart-like shells filled with beef,
cheese and mushrooms and
cooked in butter and topped
with sour cream.
The desserts easily match the
quality of the other courses. A
walnut torte soaked in rum and
Nalesnik, a sweet crepe with
strawberry sour cream, are
both good choices.
The homemade cheesecake
is excellent, but the Kawa
Mrozona, an iced coffee de
ssert, is surprisingly tasteless.
Beverages include two im
ported beers and a homemade
fruit drink. Coffee is French
roast and very good. The wine
selection emphasizes moder
ately priced European wines
and offers only three California
labels.
Warszawa is not a student
hangout, but it is a place Stan
ford students can enjoy. After
spending Big Game with 20,000
screaming students, Warszawa
could be just for you.

SPENGER'S FISH GROTTO
1919 4th ST.
Berkeley
845-7771
Spenger's Fish Grotto, on
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
had a capacity crowd last Friday
night. This is apparently the
case every other night as well.
Waits of up to two hours are
not uncommon. However,
why anyone would wait that
long to eat there is another
matter.
The restaurant consists of
several large dining rooms with
a bar in each. Tables are so
close together that the waiters
often have to squeeze by,
which is disconcerting if one is
trying to drink. An unbelieva
ble racket characterizes the
atmosphere. Conversing with
someone across a two-foot
table necessitates shouting.
Place settings were dropped
onto the table. The waiter ap
peared three times in five mi
nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701
548-7880
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory
celebration at an affordable
price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition
to the Stanford area.

BALABOSTA
Corner of University & 6th St.
Berkeley
Daily from 1: 30
548-0300
Balabosta is a special re
staurant with a sophisticated
yet casual atmosphere.
One notices the attention to
detail, such as professional
service, a house wine with its
own label and African violets
on each table.
The menu is both innovative
and exotic, and reflects the en
thusiasm and knowledge of the
owner, Sandi Beech.
Beech is justifiably proud of
her food. Everything sampled
was beautifully prepared and
in generous quantity.
Six quiches are offered daily,
including a Quiche of the Black
Swan and a Godzilla the Hun
Quiche, with spinach, herbs
and Gorgonzola cheese.
If one can speak of the
"honesty" in food, one can do
so of Balabosta. And without
pretension.
Of the hors d'oeuvres, pass
up the Baked Clams for the
Smoked Fish (incredible
smoked trout), or the gar
nished Steak Tartare (Yes,
that's raw ground beef. And
yes, it is great). Furthermore.,
the Sicilian Army Antipasto
($3.95) will satisfy a battalion of
at least six. It is a veritable
pyramid of cheese, marinated
mushrooms and artichokes,
and fresh vegetables.
Entrees are served with
either a mixed green salad or
"Ask the Waiter" soupe (soup
du jour). The Clam Chowder
($.95 a la carte) was of delicate
taste and consistency, but suf
fered from its lukewarm-ness.
Standout entrees include the
succulent Magic Mushrooms
($4.95) in cream and sherry nut-

It's the Campanile, Telegraph Avenue and
27,000 college students at the University
of California. And now food.
Once characterized by sandwich bars run
by anarchist collectives, Berkeley dining
is in its Golden Age. France, Lebanon,
Poland and Peru are all represented in the

ted brown rice; a fine Rainbow
Trout ($6.95); fresh Poached
Salmon with Hollandaise
($7.95; a superb Rock Cornish
Game Hen ($6.95) and Eastern
Mussels, done in the classic
French way (white wine, on
ions, butter). Their mushiness,
I think, tended to reflect the
season rather than the prepara
tion.
Each day, Balabosta presents
a different smoked fowl. The
menu refers to the "plain, old
fashioned time and painstak
ing care" given to food pre
pared in the Balabosta
smokehouse. The Smoked
Fresh Chicken was sublime.
Any of the desserts provide
an arousing finale that make a
great meal. While Transylvania
Rumcake ($1.50) and the
cheesecake are luxuriant and
fattening, a delicate Tortoni
(Italian ice cream, sherry, al
monds, $1.50) and individual
Baked Alaskas ($1.75) are much
lighter, but fattening. A choco
late mousse, billed as the
"World's Heaviest," is so di
vine that one will be tempted
to devour the dish in which it is
presented. In this case, the act
is permitted, for the bowl con-

sists of bitter-sweet chocolate.
Avocado and Camembert
mousse are featured as well.
Balabosta is well worth a visit
after Big Game or anytime
given the quality and portions
of the food. Prices are not un
reasonable, and you would be
hard-pressed to find a restaur
ant as interesting.

greens, parsley and dill, was
more than a simple imitation of
its Russian counterpart, the
borscht.
With names like Zrazy,
Kaczka, and Bigos, there's no
thing common about the eight

menu. Portions are large; the
Kaczka is literally half a duckl
ing, roasted and served with
baked sour apples and cinam
mon. The meat is exceptionally
moist and tender, and is a favo
rite among Warszawa's pat
rons.
Bigos, a sauerkraut-based
stew with beef, pork, sausage
and bacon is $6.25. This na

tional dish accents the flavor
and seasoning of its meat,
without getting lost in a heavy
cream sauce.
Other items include crepes
stuffed with meat and mus
hrooms, and Pierogi ($6), fluffy
tart-like shells filled with beef,
cheese and mushrooms and
cooked in butter and topped
with sour cream.
The desserts easily match the
quality of the other courses. A
walnut torte soaked in rum and
Nalesnik, a sweet crepe with
strawberry sour cream, are
both good choices.
The homemade cheesecake
is excellent, but the Kawa
Mrozona, an iced coffee de
ssert, is surprisingly tasteless.
Beverages include two im
ported beers and a homemade
fruit drink. Coffee is French
roast and very good. The wine
selection emphasizes moder
ately priced European wines
and offers only three California
labels.
Warszawa is not a student
hangout, but it is a place Stan
ford students can enjoy. After
spending Big Game with 20,000
screaming students, Warszawa
could be just for you.

SPENGER'S FISH GROTTO
1919 4th ST.
Berkeley
845-7771
Spenger's Fish Grotto, on
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
had a capacity crowd last Friday
night. This is apparently the
case every other night as well.
Waits of up to two hours are
not uncommon. However,
why anyone would wait that
long to eat there is another
matter.
The restaurant consists of
several large dining rooms with
a bar in each. Tables are so
close together that the waiters
often have to squeeze by,
which is disconcerting if one is
trying to drink. An unbelieva
ble racket characterizes the
atmosphere. Conversing with
someone across a two-foot
table necessitates shouting.
Place settings were dropped
onto the table. The waiter ap
peared three times in five mi
nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701
548-7880
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory
celebration at an affordable
price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition
to the Stanford area.

BALABOSTA
Corner of University & 6th St.
Berkeley
Daily from 1: 30
548-0300
Balabosta is a special re
staurant with a sophisticated
yet casual atmosphere.
One notices the attention to
detail, such as professional
service, a house wine with its
own label and African violets
on each table.
The menu is both innovative
and exotic, and reflects the en
thusiasm and knowledge of the
owner, Sandi Beech.
Beech is justifiably proud of
her food. Everything sampled
was beautifully prepared and
in generous quantity.
Six quiches are offered daily,
including a Quiche of the Black
Swan and a Godzilla the Hun
Quiche, with spinach, herbs
and Gorgonzola cheese.
If one can speak of the
"honesty" in food, one can do
so of Balabosta. And without
pretension.
Of the hors d'oeuvres, pass
up the Baked Clams for the
Smoked Fish (incredible
smoked trout), or the gar
nished Steak Tartare (Yes,
that's raw ground beef. And
yes, it is great). Furthermore.,
the Sicilian Army Antipasto
($3.95) will satisfy a battalion of
at least six. It is a veritable
pyramid of cheese, marinated
mushrooms and artichokes,
and fresh vegetables.
Entrees are served with
either a mixed green salad or
"Ask the Waiter" soupe (soup
du jour). The Clam Chowder
($.95 a la carte) was of delicate
taste and consistency, but suf
fered from its lukewarm-ness.
Standout entrees include the
succulent Magic Mushrooms
($4.95) in cream and sherry nut-

It's the Campanile, Telegraph Avenue and
27,000 college students at the University
of California. And now food.
Once characterized by sandwich bars run
by anarchist collectives, Berkeley dining
is in its Golden Age. France, Lebanon,
Poland and Peru are all represented in the

ted brown rice; a fine Rainbow
Trout ($6.95); fresh Poached
Salmon with Hollandaise
($7.95; a superb Rock Cornish
Game Hen ($6.95) and Eastern
Mussels, done in the classic
French way (white wine, on
ions, butter). Their mushiness,
I think, tended to reflect the
season rather than the prepara
tion.
Each day, Balabosta presents
a different smoked fowl. The
menu refers to the "plain, old
fashioned time and painstak
ing care" given to food pre
pared in the Balabosta
smokehouse. The Smoked
Fresh Chicken was sublime.
Any of the desserts provide
an arousing finale that make a
great meal. While Transylvania
Rumcake ($1.50) and the
cheesecake are luxuriant and
fattening, a delicate Tortoni
(Italian ice cream, sherry, al
monds, $1.50) and individual
Baked Alaskas ($1.75) are much
lighter, but fattening. A choco
late mousse, billed as the
"World's Heaviest," is so di
vine that one will be tempted
to devour the dish in which it is
presented. In this case, the act
is permitted, for the bowl con-

sists of bitter-sweet chocolate.
Avocado and Camembert
mousse are featured as well.
Balabosta is well worth a visit
after Big Game or anytime
given the quality and portions
of the food. Prices are not un
reasonable, and you would be
hard-pressed to find a restaur
ant as interesting.

Poland is all about.
The Warszawa restaurant on

SPENGER'S FISH GROTTO
1919 4th ST.
Berkeley
845-7771
Spenger's Fish Grotto, on
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
had a capacity crowd last Friday
night. This is apparently the
case every other night as well.
Waits of up to two hours are
not uncommon. However,
why anyone would wait that
long to eat there is another
matter.
The restaurant consists of
several large dining rooms with
a bar in each. Tables are so
close together that the waiters
often have to squeeze by,
which is disconcerting if one is
trying to drink. An unbelieva
ble racket characterizes the
atmosphere. Conversing with
someone across a two-foot
table necessitates shouting.
Place settings were dropped
onto the table. The waiter ap
peared three times in five mi
nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701
548-7880
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory
celebration at an affordable
price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition
to the Stanford area.

BALABOSTA
Corner of University & 6th St.
Berkeley
Daily from 1: 30
548-0300
Balabosta is a special re
staurant with a sophisticated
yet casual atmosphere.
One notices the attention to
detail, such as professional
service, a house wine with its
own label and African violets
on each table.
The menu is both innovative
and exotic, and reflects the en
thusiasm and knowledge of the
owner, Sandi Beech.
Beech is justifiably proud of
her food. Everything sampled
was beautifully prepared and
in generous quantity.
Six quiches are offered daily,
including a Quiche of the Black
Swan and a Godzilla the Hun
Quiche, with spinach, herbs
and Gorgonzola cheese.
If one can speak of the
"honesty" in food, one can do
so of Balabosta. And without
pretension.
Of the hors d'oeuvres, pass
up the Baked Clams for the
Smoked Fish (incredible
smoked trout), or the gar
nished Steak Tartare (Yes,
that's raw ground beef. And
yes, it is great). Furthermore.,
the Sicilian Army Antipasto
($3.95) will satisfy a battalion of
at least six. It is a veritable
pyramid of cheese, marinated
mushrooms and artichokes,
and fresh vegetables.
Entrees are served with
either a mixed green salad or
"Ask the Waiter" soupe (soup
du jour). The Clam Chowder
($.95 a la carte) was of delicate
taste and consistency, but suf
fered from its lukewarm-ness.
Standout entrees include the
succulent Magic Mushrooms
($4.95) in cream and sherry nut-

It's the Campanile, Telegraph Avenue and
27,000 college students at the University
of California. And now food.
Once characterized by sandwich bars run
by anarchist collectives, Berkeley dining
is in its Golden Age. France, Lebanon,
Poland and Peru are all represented in the

ted brown rice; a fine Rainbow
Trout ($6.95); fresh Poached
Salmon with Hollandaise
($7.95; a superb Rock Cornish
Game Hen ($6.95) and Eastern
Mussels, done in the classic
French way (white wine, on
ions, butter). Their mushiness,
I think, tended to reflect the
season rather than the prepara
tion.
Each day, Balabosta presents
a different smoked fowl. The
menu refers to the "plain, old
fashioned time and painstak
ing care" given to food pre
pared in the Balabosta
smokehouse. The Smoked
Fresh Chicken was sublime.
Any of the desserts provide
an arousing finale that make a
great meal. While Transylvania
Rumcake ($1.50) and the
cheesecake are luxuriant and
fattening, a delicate Tortoni
(Italian ice cream, sherry, al
monds, $1.50) and individual
Baked Alaskas ($1.75) are much
lighter, but fattening. A choco
late mousse, billed as the
"World's Heaviest," is so di
vine that one will be tempted
to devour the dish in which it is
presented. In this case, the act
is permitted, for the bowl con-

sists of bitter-sweet chocolate.
Avocado and Camembert
mousse are featured as well.
Balabosta is well worth a visit
after Big Game or anytime
given the quality and portions
of the food. Prices are not un
reasonable, and you would be
hard-pressed to find a restaur
ant as interesting.

If it's Tuesday it must be Bel
gium, and if it's Saturday it
must be...Poland? Hey, wait a
minute, the Big Game's on
Saturday, and it's in Berkeley,
not Poland.
We know that, but we're not
talking about Saturday day,
we're talking about Saturday
night, after the game, when
you're hungry, ready for din
ner, and maybe ready to dis
cover what Berkeley's slice of
Poland is all about.
The Warszawa restaurant on
Shattuck Avenue, a 15- to 20-
minute walk from the stadium,
manages to escape the health
food syndrome typical of many
— too many — Berkeley re
staurants. Peace, love and
macrame are not the central
themes here.
Red table cloths, white
washed brick walls, and the
use of colorful folk art create a
warm and peasant-like atmos
phere. The hearty fare and re
laxed pace makes Warszawa
popular with families, grand
parents and younger couples.
The menu is a la carte and
features traditional Polish re
cipes. Prices are reasonable
and don't preclude trying dis
hes like the Warszawa salads
($.90), a tangy combination of
sauerkraut, apples and carrots,
or the Borszcsz ($1.45), a hot
winter soup. The soup, with its
chunky beet stock, fresh
greens, parsley and dill, was
more than a simple imitation of
its Russian counterpart, the
borscht.
With names like Zrazy,
Kaczka, and Bigos, there's no
thing common about the eight
different entrees listed on the
menu. Portions are large; the
Kaczka is literally half a duckl
ing, roasted and served with
baked sour apples and cinam
mon. The meat is exceptionally
moist and tender, and is a favo
rite among Warszawa's pat
rons.
Bigos, a sauerkraut-based
stew with beef, pork, sausage
and bacon is $6.25. This na

tional dish accents the flavor
and seasoning of its meat,
without getting lost in a heavy
cream sauce.
Other items include crepes
stuffed with meat and mus
hrooms, and Pierogi ($6), fluffy
tart-like shells filled with beef,
cheese and mushrooms and
cooked in butter and topped
with sour cream.
The desserts easily match the
quality of the other courses. A
walnut torte soaked in rum and
Nalesnik, a sweet crepe with
strawberry sour cream, are
both good choices.
The homemade cheesecake
is excellent, but the Kawa
Mrozona, an iced coffee de
ssert, is surprisingly tasteless.
Beverages include two im
ported beers and a homemade
fruit drink. Coffee is French
roast and very good. The wine
selection emphasizes moder
ately priced European wines
and offers only three California

nutes to ask if we were ready to
order. It seemed that leisurely
decision-making is not en
couraged. One of us chose the
"Captain's Platter," a pot
pourri of various seafoods,
deep-fried. The other person
decided on the special of the
day, mahi-mahi baked in a

city's restaurants. If you're up for fine
dining and interesting cuisine after the
81st renewal of the Big Game, here are
some suggestions from the Daily: It's by
no means a definitive guide to East Bay
restaurants, but only an appetizer to the
culinary possibilities that await you after
the final beer-less game of the season.

sauce with mushrooms and on
ions with a side order of brown
rice.
Dinner arrived in less than a
minute, which tended to raise
a few questions about the per
sonal attention lavished on the
meal. Both entrees arrived in
that peculiar temperature best
described as "luke-cold." The
types of fish in the "platter"
were unidentifiable. The
mahi-mahi had been over
cooked by at least 30 minutes.
The brown rice was cold and
the mushrooms shriveled.
The menu is extensive, and
one problem might simply be
that Spenger's tries to do too
much. Maybe we picked things
ihat are not as well-prepared as
others. But the quality of the
dinners chosen was certainly
marginal.
Prices are low, from about
$2.50 to $8.50, which includes
french fries and cole slaw for
most of the dinners. Perhaps
the best recommendation that
can be given is that it is a good
place for a rowdy dorm group
to dine inexpensively. It is not,
however, a place for a quiet,
civilized meal for any number
of people.

CHINA STATION
700 University Ave.
Berkeley, 94701
548-7880
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily
Owned by third and fourth
generation Chinese Ameri
cans, China Station is dedi
cated to their Chinese ances
tors, who were in large part re
sponsible for bridging the
American continent by rail.
The building was once the
Southern Pacific Depot and
most of the outer shell remains
intact. The interior recreates
the flavor of the period by
using walnut paneling and
natural woods.
It goes without saying that
this is not the average Chinese
eatery; China Station is a slick
operation. The bararea is relax
ing, and if you do not make
reservations, this is where you
will be waiting.
The menu is wide-ranging
and features "Americanized"
Chinese food. The house
specializes in seafood, and
with the exception of the
abalone dishes, everything is
fresh. Jook, a rice porridge
popular among the Chinese, is
served only after 10 p.m.
There are seven soups val
ued at under $3 — Egg Flower,

Seaweed, Wintermelon, Sizzl
ing Rice. A watery variation of
Hot and Sour soup had a to
mato flavor and chunky rather
than shredded chicken.
Most meat and fowl dishes
cost less than $4. Hundred
Blossoms Lamb ($5.25), irresis
tibly named and one of the
more expensive items on the
menu, was aromatic but very
rich.
Snow peas with Black Mus
hrooms in Oyster Sauce ($4.25)
was full of that edible fungus
but noticeably stingy with the
snow peas.
Clams, oysters, lobster,
crab, squid, frog legs and
prawns are available at China
Station. Scallops sauteed in
Garlic Sauce ($4.25), were
cooked to perfection and are
highly recommended.
China Station for two years
has had the formula for suc
cess: large portions of quality
food, reasonable prices, flaw
less service and lively atmos
phere. Don't go expecting the
most authentic Chinese food
in the Bay Area, but go for the
fun.

THE MELTING POT
25059 Hearst
Berkeley
843-4354
Berkeley is known for its
wide range of exotic restaur
ants, most of which serve good
food in a casual atmosphere.
The Melting Pot, a fondue re
staurant located on the north
side of campus, is no excep
tion.
An easy-going, come-as
you-are establishment, The
Melting Pot is largely student
oriented. The earthy decor
lends itself to a mellow atmos
phere; potato sacks cover one
wall while paintings accent the
others. A guitar player sings
enthusiastically to himself in a
corner.
Our waitress presented us
with a stained glass lantern on

which the menu is printed.
One may order a la carte or
from a selection of full dinners.
We chose to order two fon
dues. One consisted of a mix
ture of cheddar and swiss
cheese accompanied by a bas
ket of French bread chunks
($2.05 or $4.15 for two). The
other fondue was a combina
tion of swiss and gruyere
cheese, with small bits of
Danish ham ($2.70 or $4.95).
Although both dishes were
delicious and had the perfect
texture for fondue, we felt we
would have been better off or
dering at least one choice from
the full dinner menu, which in
cluded such specialties as sir
loin ($5.75), lobster ($7.75) and
teriyaki ($5.85) fondues. Din
ners are served with salad or
soup, and French bread; they
range in price from $5.65 to
$7.50.
For the adventurous diner
the meat fondues offer a de
parture from the ordinary; raw
meat is brought to the table,
where the guest cooks the
small pieces in hot oil. An array
of spices adds flavor to the
finished (or unfinished as the
case may be) product.
A specialty of the house is
the Melting Pot ($13.95), which
serves two. It brings together
sirloin, lamb, prawns, lobster
and scallops — enough to con
sole even the most despon
dent of CAL weenies.
Other a la carte selections
include Bacon ($2.55), Shrimp
($2.05), Salami ($2.45), Mus
hroom ($2.55) and Chive
($2.45) fondues.
For dessert, the semi-sweet
Chocolate Fondue ($2.35 or
$4.50 for two), comprised a de
licious choice of cherries,
pound cake, marshmallows,
cream cheese cubes, bananas,
and canned pineapple chunks.
Other dessert choices include
cheese cake ($.95) and
pumpkin cake ($.75).
No alcoholic beverages are
served on the premises, but
healthier alternatives are avail
able, such as hot apple cider
($.65), orange juice ($.65) or
herb tea ($.40).
The Melting Pot is located
near the ccner of Hearst and
Euclid, set back from the street
in quaint surroundings. The
dining area is small (14 tables)
and reservations may be advis
able.
The Melting Pot provides the
perfect setting for a victory
celebration at an affordable
price. A restaurant of this type
would be a welcome addition
to the Stanford area.
