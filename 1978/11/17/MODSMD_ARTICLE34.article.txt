COCINA DE LOS ANDES
1105 Shattuck Ave.
Berkeley, Ca. 94705
849-2568
Cocina de Los Andes, a Latin
American restaurant in Ber
keley not only offers great food
at cheap prices but does so in
cultural environment. The re
staurant is part of La Pena cul
tural center, a place estab
lished two years ago for people
to gather, converse, sing and
eat together.
La Pena is the first of its kind
in the United States. It carries
on the tradition of Penas which
originated in Latin America,
especially in Chile and Argen
tina decades ago when peas
ants built temporary huts to
provide a communal space to
celebrate fiestas and holidays.
Crossing the hemisphere
from Tierra del Fuego to the
Rio Grande, Cocina prepares
food from many nations in
cluding Peru, Argentina, Cuba,
Puerto Rico, Chile and Brazil.
The food is excellent and you'll
definitely not leave hungry.
Complete meals run from
$2.50-$4.50, including soup or
salad, corn chips and hot bread.
While the usual Mexican fair
of Tostadas, Tortillas, rice and
beans is available you'd be
missing out if you weren't
more adventuresome. Some of
their most interesting concoc
tions includePe/xe com Molho
de Coco from Brazil, Broiled
Red Snapper topped with
coconut sauce and Brazil nuts,
served with broiled bananas,
rice and black beans.
The Chilean Chupe de
Marisco is highly recom
mended. It consists of scal
lops, crab and bay shrimp
sauteed in white wine with on
ion, carrots and peas and is
served with roasted potato,
tomato and avocado slices.
Besides the Mariscos, Carrie
andCallina, (seafood, beef and
chit ken) entrees, is an array of
vegetarian dishes. Particularly
good among these is the
Calabazas Rellenas from
Argentina, zucchini stuffed
with vegetables, cheese and
egg, topped wih spicy tomato
sauce and melted cheese,
served with riceand fresh fruit.
A favorite of La Pena's regu
lars is their Chilean bouil
liabaisse, a turrine of assorted
fish, clams and shrimp in a
thick soup with potato, celery,
bell pepper, onion and carrot
— the proverbial meal in itself.
To accompany your meal is a
wide selection of bebidas (be
verages). Several imported soft
drinks include (Boing Mango,
Tamarindo, Guanabana), wine
punches by the pitcher. Beer
ranges from the old stand-by
Budweiser to several Mexican
brews, Dos Equis, Tecate and
Carta Blanca, and the Peruvian
Cristal.
Even the Postres (desserts)
are out of the ordinary. The
Cream de Cacao Parfait pro
vides a smooth fluffy dessert, a
good, though not particularly
exciting, Latin American rendi
tion of the chocolate sundae. A
more interesting, though less
"safe" choice is the Guava
Paste and Cheese, a sugary,
thick paste made from the
guava fruit topped with slices
of sharp cheddar. A weird
combination with delightful
results.
Cocina is also unique be
cause much of its labor is con
tributed by volunteers who
donate their weekly time to
further the cultural work of the
t enter. The atmosphere is con
sequently very friendly and
low-key. Our waiter made a
special point to chat with us,
tilling us in on the history of La
Pena without forcefeeding
Latin culture. You can quite
comfortably go there to eat
without ever getting involved
in the cultural side, if ethnic
culture isn't your thing.
Of course, you'd be missing
out on a variety of fantastic
events. The perfect evening
would combine dinner with a
poetry reading, film, speaker
or music session. This Saturday
night after the game, for exam
ple, why not take in the "hot

test salsa conjunto on the west
coast. Fiery infectious Latin
music that won't let you sit
still."
I should stress that while La
Pena's roots are in Latin Ameri
can culture, its events include
a diverse range of ethnic
groups and minorities. Many
of the programs are political in
nature. This month's highlights
include an evening of Native
American films, an African
Music and Dance Ensemble,
and Sergei Eisenstein's film,
Strike (USSR, 1924), "a visual
metaphor of struggling labor
and heavy industry replete
with surrealistic theatrical ef
fects."
As you drive down Shattuck
away from the university, and
the street lights you can't miss
it. Just before the road seems
about to end in darkness, you
are greeted by a blast of bril
liant color: the "street art"
mural decorating the facade of
La Pena.

Berkeley, Not By Bread Alone,
Harry Killas' food column, will

THE PHOENICIAN
2441 Dwight Way (at Telegraph)
Berkeley
Hours: 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Closed
Monday
843-5788
Middle Eastern cookery —
the third great cuisine of the
world. Reflecting the culinary
and nutritional wisdom that
has come down through the
ages, The Phoenician in Ber
keley is exemplary of the
Lebanese facet of this gas
tronomical tradition.
One cannot help but notice
the brilliant freshness of the
ingredients, not only a "re
quirement" of the kitchen as
the menu explains, but also a
"fetish."
And the food is inherently

nutritional — no white bread
here! — as shown by the fresh,
homemade yogurt, lean meat,
bulghur wheat and liberal
doses of lemon.
I'm convinced that Mezeh
"nibbles" was designed for the
lover of life. Ten different small
dishes, some pita bread, a bot
tle of wine and a restaurant
somewhere overlooking the
Mediterranean. The Phoeni
cian's Mezeh for two ($5.95) in
cludes two outstanding dis
hes: Hummus Bi Tahini (a
paste of chick-peas mixed with
a paste of sesame seeds) and
Tabbouleh Salad (chopped on
ion, parsley, tomato with
cracked wheat and a lemon
juice dressing). Also included
are fresh vegetables, pistachio
nuts, sliced cheese and ham,
romaine leaves and Baba
Ghannouj, a smokey dip pre
pared in the classic way of
charring eggplant over a flame
and blending it with Tahini.
Mezeh for more people in
cludes a larger assortment of
nibbles.
Entrees come with either
lentil soup or a terrific, tangy
salad, with a little too much
lemon.
Lamam Mishwi (shish kebab
or souvlaki — $6.50) is a color
ful array of bell pepper, to
mato, onions and mushrooms,
pilaf and a cucumber-yogurt
mixture is served with it. Yab
raq were grape leaves and zuc
chini stuffed with meatand rice
($5.50), the zucchini decidedly
better than the grape leaves.
A new menu with a wider
range of entrees especially sea
foods and chicken should be
out soon. Furthermore, Chef
Ghassan will prepare any Mid
dle Eastern dish with prior
notice. Catering, too.
Ten coffee specialties in
clude the Phoenician (.$1.25),
with espresso, chocolate, al
mond essence, and whipped
cream. Of the desserts, the
übiquitous Baklawa ($.85) and
a refreshing and different gel
led pudding (Mugly — $.85) are

offered.
It is rare indeed that a re
staurant that insists on such
meticulousness (that extends
to using dried garbanzo beans)
can make a profit.
Conceivably one could get
by here with a little over $6. But
you may want to splurge. For
not only is the Phoenician a
sensory delight, but for those
uninitiated in the unrivalled
pleasures of Middle Eastern
cookery, it is an education.
