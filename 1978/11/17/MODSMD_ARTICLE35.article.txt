EPPAMINONDAS
45 Bay St.
S.F. 982-2350
Eppaminondas (don't ask
me how to pronounce it) is
located at 45 Bay Street near
the Embarcadero.
With an accent on the
eclectic, Eppaminondas ties
Tiffany glass, a multi
colored upholstered ceil
ing, and straight-backed
cane chairs into a decor that
quickly becomes central to
the dining experience. The
discotheque is off to the
right of a handsome, dark
wood Victorian bar that
faces the dual level dining
area. Music, pulsating
lights, and dancers in the
tradition of Travolta and Co.
begin playing every night at
nine.
Like the interior design,
the menu features "a whole
lot" of everything.The first
section, christened
"BOOZE,' includes Sangria
($1.25 a large glass), the
Margarita ($1.50), and a fan

tastic banana daiquiri
($1.75).
Other categories are enti
tled 'BEGINNINGS,' 'SEN
SATIONAL PITA BREAD
SANDWICHES/ 'BUR
GERS,' 'OMELETS,' 'CRE
PES,' and 'AMBROSIA.'
Prices are reasonable: an
Aegean salad made with
turkey, bacon, feta cheese,
olives, scallions, tomatoes,
and mushrooms costs
$3.85; Teriyaki Steak served
with vegetables and an
ample green salad is $6.85;
A special emphasis on
Greek recipes means trying
dishes like the Gyro ($3.25),
a marinated blend of lamb,
pork, and beef stuffed in
pita bread, or the Zucchini
Zorba ($6.10), an entree
combining baked zucchini
with beef, fresh spinach,
mushrooms, and olives in a
special mediterranean
sauce and topped with
melted cheese.
Unfortunately, where Ep
paminondas leaves the

Greek or American cook
book behind, the results are
less satisfying. The Tour
nedos of Beef Nancy ($8.25)
was a disappointment.
Desserts followed the
same trend. Baklava ($1.25),
a Greek institution, won out
over the Fruit Crepes
Jubilee ($2.25), a standard
preparation of artifically
whipped cream, crepes,
and strawberry preserves
that hardly justified the
caloric splurge. Belgian waf
fles with a choice of top
pings or a Hot Fudge Sun
dae mounded high in a glass
goblet ($1.50) might have
been better choices.
And yet, in the midst of
that Saturday Night fever
and shimmeying waiters,
these shortcomings aren't
distracting.
Eppaminondas is both an
entertainment and an eating
establishment which invites
a different set of criteria —
criteria which consider fun
as well as flavor.
