## Movies/ron lillejord Stallone and the perils of winning 
### 
Taking your best shot —
going all the way — is the way
to make movies. "Taking your
best shot" isn't a bad movie
theme either, and it looks like
Sylvester Stallone may hang his
career on it. In Rocky, a little
lion of a movie, he stripped ev
erything down, incorporating
movie cliches but keeping
them so simple that you were
-hooked and didn't ask ques
tions. It was very close to being
primal moviemaking, and
ghat's often the best kind.
Rocky's huge success has
given Stallone an enormous
amount of creative control
over his movies. And though it
may be too early to tell, this
jfnay be the worst thing for him.
In Paradise Alley, his new film,
Stallone didn't have to fight for
the right to star or work within
Revere budget limitations, as
he did with Rocky. The result is

a meticulously crafted, smooth
and curiously lifeless movie.
Paradise Alley isn't complacent
really — it's not the work of
someone who isn't trying. But
the film doesn't have much
drive. After every sequence,
the movie starts from scratch.
The movie is set in 1946, and it's
directed as if Stallone saw
every arty private-eye movie
ever made in that period. But
the movie never captures a
mood with this, except
perhaps a completely subdued
one.
The film is a simple, male
dominated drama focusing on
three brothers: the strong one
(Lee Canalito), the one with
brains (Armand Assante) and
the one that hustles (Stallone).
Because of the movie's sub
dued tone, there's an unavoid
able sense of quiet desperation
surrounding them. You feel

as if they don't have much
of a shot; they may never get
out of the inner city, out of the
cheap room they share.
Their wins are small ones;
even the big climax, where the
strong brother wins a big
money wrestling match
doesn't have much luster, and
you're hardly carried away by
it.
ButStallone wants you to be;
at the end all of the conflicts
between the brothers are re
solved and all is supposed to
begreat — the world is a happy
place again. But it doesn't fit,
and you get the feeling that
even Stallone doubted that it
would.
Perhaps Stallone already
feels trapped by his image and
is afraid of making a downbeat
movie. That's possible, but I
don't think that it's the expla
nation. What's missing from

Paradise Alley is the energy of a
man running scared with his
back to the wall, the kind of
heat that comes from someone
bursting free after being trap
ped. It's the kind of kineticism
that Bruce Springsteen is riding
right now and which drove
Stallone in Rocky.
There'sa basicquality in Stal
lone that makes you want to
give this big bull a chance even
when you'd dismiss someone
else. Even though you finally
give up on him here, you're
sure he'll be back.
Success
Perhaps Stallone needs to be
put back into a battling situa
tion where everything has to
be fought for. Both Stal
lone and his movie are just
more evidence for the conten
tion that the hardest thing to
do in life is to learn from suc
cess.


Sylvester Stallone, Lee Canalito and Armand Assante star in Paradise Alley. Stallone also wrote and
directed the film, which is now playing at Old Mill.

give up on him here, you're
sure he'll be back.
Success
Perhaps Stallone needs to be
put back into a battling situa
tion where everything has to
be fought for. Both Stal
lone and his movie are just
more evidence for the conten
tion that the hardest thing to
do in life is to learn from suc
cess.


Sylvester Stallone, Lee Canalito and Armand Assante star in Paradise Alley. Stallone also wrote and
directed the film, which is now playing at Old Mill.
Taking your best shot —
going all the way — is the way
to make movies. "Taking your
best shot" isn't a bad movie
theme either, and it looks like
Sylvester Stallone may hang his
career on it. In Rocky, a little
lion of a movie, he stripped ev
erything down, incorporating
movie cliches but keeping
them so simple that you were
-hooked and didn't ask ques
tions. It was very close to being
primal moviemaking, and
ghat's often the best kind.
Rocky's huge success has
given Stallone an enormous
amount of creative control
over his movies. And though it
may be too early to tell, this
jfnay be the worst thing for him.
In Paradise Alley, his new film,
Stallone didn't have to fight for
the right to star or work within
Revere budget limitations, as
he did with Rocky. The result is

a meticulously crafted, smooth
and curiously lifeless movie.
Paradise Alley isn't complacent
really — it's not the work of
someone who isn't trying. But
the film doesn't have much
drive. After every sequence,
the movie starts from scratch.
The movie is set in 1946, and it's
directed as if Stallone saw
every arty private-eye movie
ever made in that period. But
the movie never captures a
mood with this, except
perhaps a completely subdued
one.
The film is a simple, male
dominated drama focusing on
three brothers: the strong one
(Lee Canalito), the one with
brains (Armand Assante) and
the one that hustles (Stallone).
Because of the movie's sub
dued tone, there's an unavoid
able sense of quiet desperation
surrounding them. You feel

as if they don't have much
of a shot; they may never get
out of the inner city, out of the
cheap room they share.
Their wins are small ones;
even the big climax, where the
strong brother wins a big
money wrestling match
doesn't have much luster, and
you're hardly carried away by
it.
ButStallone wants you to be;
at the end all of the conflicts
between the brothers are re
solved and all is supposed to
begreat — the world is a happy
place again. But it doesn't fit,
and you get the feeling that
even Stallone doubted that it
would.
Perhaps Stallone already
feels trapped by his image and
is afraid of making a downbeat
movie. That's possible, but I
don't think that it's the expla
nation. What's missing from

Paradise Alley is the energy of a
man running scared with his
back to the wall, the kind of
heat that comes from someone
bursting free after being trap
ped. It's the kind of kineticism
that Bruce Springsteen is riding
right now and which drove
Stallone in Rocky.
There'sa basicquality in Stal
lone that makes you want to
give this big bull a chance even
when you'd dismiss someone
else. Even though you finally
give up on him here, you're
sure he'll be back.
