Suspicion ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This rarely shown 1941 Alfred
Hitchcock movie represents
Hitchcock at full strength, glee
fully working within the movie's
morally ambiguous plot. Cary
Grant first worked for Hitchcock
in this movie. His performance is
just about perfect, as is Joan Fon
taine's as the woman whose sus
picions of her new husband's
(Grant) intentions — i.e., will he
kill her? — drive her to the brink
of madness. But wait; are we so
sure that Grant doesn't want to
kill her? With Cedric Hardwicke
and Nigel Bruce; the brilliant
cinematography was done by
Harry Stradling. Playing with
Frenzy.
—Ron Lillejord
Frenzy irkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
In 1972, Hitchcock returned to
England to make this cold
blooded, impersonal thriller
about a vicious rapist. While
probably the best of his movies
since Psycho, Frenzy shows
Hitchcock once again flexing the
same muscles—ifs not much fun
anymore. With Jon Finch and (in
an excellent performance) Alex
McCowen.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—Jim Mattson

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Frantisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.
—J.M.
Bread and Chocolate ★ ★★
Bridge, San Francisco
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land

doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this film has
a wit and warmth which make it
eminently watchable. Nino Man
fredi, as the immigrant, has one
of those faces which can make
nearly anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece; Franco Brusati directed.
—J.M.
The Goodbye Girl ifk
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil
Simon seem made for each
other: they both laugh too loudly
at their own jokes. Neil Simon
fans, and there are many, should
find this movie to be entirely
satisfactory, but the film's clinical
approach to comedy (one gets
the feeling that the jokes must
have been fine-tuned by an audi
ence wearing electrodes) is a
turn-off. Herbert Ross (of The
Turning Point and The Sunshine
Boys fame) directed.
—J.M.
The Man Who Loved Women
Wednesday, Bishop ★★★
This, director Francois Truf
faut's most recent work, may be
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible
to them — you will probably have
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiar cards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey
and Leslie Caron.
—R.L.

A Portrait of the Artist as a Younf>
Man~k*k
New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
It's doubtful whether thi;
lames Joyce novel will ever be
made into a good movie. How
does one visualize thoughts? Di
rector Joseph Strick's rgponse is
to throw Joyce's narrative into
the movie wholesale.
Material like this needs artists
who will add something of them
selves to the subject and not
someone who tackles Joyce as
written and proceeds to shoot it,
as Strick does. The artist may end
up with a failure, as Stanley Kub
rick did with Nabokov's Lolita,
but there will at least be magic in
it.
—R.L.
The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en

larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room.

Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.

Autumn Sonata ififir y 2
Fine Arts, San Francisco
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmanrt give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
film about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating, because its lan
guagecannot do justice to either
the performanpes or to
Bergman's assured visual con
ception. But your frustration is,
finally, erased by joy. Even if In
gmar Bergman is not yet ready to
go all the way with a movie again,
his actresses are, and they take
the movie right to the limit, roar
ing through it like two great
ladies of the theater who haven't
lost their zest.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ v 2
Castro, San Francisco
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on'them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.
Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
The Boys from Brazil itit
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.
—R.L.
Magic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's dummy in the Judy Gar
land part and the star-on-the-way
down role is taken by Anthony
Hopkins as a ventriloquist. Direc
tor Richard Attenborough pulls
off one or two scary moments,
but this pseudo-psychological
story of a ventriloquist who be
comes obsessed with his own
mannequin has been done too
many times before — better.
—J.M.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europei ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin

Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '6?. works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" 1 in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Ingrid Bergman and Liv

film about a parent-child rela

A Dream of Passion ★★★ v 2
Castro, San Francisco
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on'them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex

This textbook case of rabid

Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Boys from Brazil itit
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Magic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's dummy in the Judy Gar

down role is taken by Anthony
Hopkins as a ventriloquist. Direc
tor Richard Attenborough pulls
off one or two scary moments,
but this pseudo-psychological
story of a ventriloquist who be
comes obsessed with his own
mannequin has been done too
many times before — better.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europei ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin

Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '6?. works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" 1 in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Nine Companions from The Lord of the Rings, which opened this week at the UA Pruneyard in
San Jose and at the Regency in San Francisco.
Suspicion ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This rarely shown 1941 Alfred
Hitchcock movie represents
Hitchcock at full strength, glee
fully working within the movie's
morally ambiguous plot. Cary
Grant first worked for Hitchcock
in this movie. His performance is
just about perfect, as is Joan Fon
taine's as the woman whose sus
picions of her new husband's
(Grant) intentions — i.e., will he
kill her? — drive her to the brink
of madness. But wait; are we so
sure that Grant doesn't want to
kill her? With Cedric Hardwicke
and Nigel Bruce; the brilliant
cinematography was done by
Harry Stradling. Playing with
Frenzy.
—Ron Lillejord
Frenzy irkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
In 1972, Hitchcock returned to
England to make this cold
blooded, impersonal thriller
about a vicious rapist. While
probably the best of his movies
since Psycho, Frenzy shows
Hitchcock once again flexing the
same muscles—ifs not much fun
anymore. With Jon Finch and (in
an excellent performance) Alex
McCowen.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—Jim Mattson

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Frantisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.
—J.M.
Bread and Chocolate ★ ★★
Bridge, San Francisco
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land

doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this film has
a wit and warmth which make it
eminently watchable. Nino Man
fredi, as the immigrant, has one
of those faces which can make
nearly anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece; Franco Brusati directed.
—J.M.
The Goodbye Girl ifk
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil
Simon seem made for each
other: they both laugh too loudly
at their own jokes. Neil Simon
fans, and there are many, should
find this movie to be entirely
satisfactory, but the film's clinical
approach to comedy (one gets
the feeling that the jokes must
have been fine-tuned by an audi
ence wearing electrodes) is a
turn-off. Herbert Ross (of The
Turning Point and The Sunshine
Boys fame) directed.
—J.M.
The Man Who Loved Women
Wednesday, Bishop ★★★
This, director Francois Truf
faut's most recent work, may be
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible
to them — you will probably have
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiar cards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey
and Leslie Caron.
—R.L.

A Portrait of the Artist as a Younf>
Man~k*k
New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
It's doubtful whether thi;
lames Joyce novel will ever be
made into a good movie. How
does one visualize thoughts? Di
rector Joseph Strick's rgponse is
to throw Joyce's narrative into
the movie wholesale.
Material like this needs artists
who will add something of them
selves to the subject and not
someone who tackles Joyce as
written and proceeds to shoot it,
as Strick does. The artist may end
up with a failure, as Stanley Kub
rick did with Nabokov's Lolita,
but there will at least be magic in
it.

The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of

tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en

larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room.

male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '6?. works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" 1 in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Nine Companions from The Lord of the Rings, which opened this week at the UA Pruneyard in
San Jose and at the Regency in San Francisco.
Suspicion ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This rarely shown 1941 Alfred
Hitchcock movie represents
Hitchcock at full strength, glee
fully working within the movie's
morally ambiguous plot. Cary
Grant first worked for Hitchcock
in this movie. His performance is
just about perfect, as is Joan Fon
taine's as the woman whose sus
picions of her new husband's
(Grant) intentions — i.e., will he
kill her? — drive her to the brink
of madness. But wait; are we so
sure that Grant doesn't want to
kill her? With Cedric Hardwicke
and Nigel Bruce; the brilliant
cinematography was done by
Harry Stradling. Playing with
Frenzy.
—Ron Lillejord
Frenzy irkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
In 1972, Hitchcock returned to
England to make this cold
blooded, impersonal thriller
about a vicious rapist. While
probably the best of his movies
since Psycho, Frenzy shows
Hitchcock once again flexing the
same muscles—ifs not much fun
anymore. With Jon Finch and (in
an excellent performance) Alex
McCowen.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—Jim Mattson

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Frantisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.
—J.M.
Bread and Chocolate ★ ★★
Bridge, San Francisco
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land

doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this film has
a wit and warmth which make it
eminently watchable. Nino Man
fredi, as the immigrant, has one
of those faces which can make
nearly anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece; Franco Brusati directed.
—J.M.
The Goodbye Girl ifk
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil
Simon seem made for each
other: they both laugh too loudly
at their own jokes. Neil Simon
fans, and there are many, should
find this movie to be entirely
satisfactory, but the film's clinical
approach to comedy (one gets
the feeling that the jokes must
have been fine-tuned by an audi
ence wearing electrodes) is a
turn-off. Herbert Ross (of The
Turning Point and The Sunshine
Boys fame) directed.
—J.M.
The Man Who Loved Women
Wednesday, Bishop ★★★
This, director Francois Truf
faut's most recent work, may be
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible
to them — you will probably have
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiar cards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey
and Leslie Caron.
—R.L.

A Portrait of the Artist as a Younf>
Man~k*k
New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
It's doubtful whether thi;
lames Joyce novel will ever be
made into a good movie. How
does one visualize thoughts? Di
rector Joseph Strick's rgponse is
to throw Joyce's narrative into
the movie wholesale.
Material like this needs artists
who will add something of them
selves to the subject and not
someone who tackles Joyce as
written and proceeds to shoot it,
as Strick does. The artist may end
up with a failure, as Stanley Kub
rick did with Nabokov's Lolita,
but there will at least be magic in
it.

The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every

turned the volume up and en

larged the sets. Individuality and

Who do we fear for? Vou can't

Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura

Autumn Sonata ififir y 2
Fine Arts, San Francisco
Ingrid Bergman and Liv

film about a parent-child rela

very frustrating, because its lan
guagecannot do justice to either
the performanpes or to
Bergman's assured visual con

finally, erased by joy. Even if In

A Dream of Passion ★★★ v 2
Castro, San Francisco
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on'them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.
Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Boys from Brazil itit
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.
—R.L.
Magic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's dummy in the Judy Gar
land part and the star-on-the-way
down role is taken by Anthony
Hopkins as a ventriloquist. Direc
tor Richard Attenborough pulls
off one or two scary moments,
but this pseudo-psychological
story of a ventriloquist who be
comes obsessed with his own
mannequin has been done too
many times before — better.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europei ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin

Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for

this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura

Autumn Sonata ififir y 2

Ingrid Bergman and Liv

film about a parent-child rela

very frustrating, because its lan

A Dream of Passion ★★★ v 2
Castro, San Francisco
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on'them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the

The Boys from Brazil itit
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Magic ★★

Best described as yet another

off one or two scary moments,

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europei ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin

Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '6?. works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" 1 in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Nine Companions from The Lord of the Rings, which opened this week at the UA Pruneyard in
San Jose and at the Regency in San Francisco.
Suspicion ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This rarely shown 1941 Alfred
Hitchcock movie represents
Hitchcock at full strength, glee
fully working within the movie's
morally ambiguous plot. Cary
Grant first worked for Hitchcock
in this movie. His performance is
just about perfect, as is Joan Fon
taine's as the woman whose sus
picions of her new husband's
(Grant) intentions — i.e., will he
kill her? — drive her to the brink
of madness. But wait; are we so
sure that Grant doesn't want to
kill her? With Cedric Hardwicke
and Nigel Bruce; the brilliant
cinematography was done by
Harry Stradling. Playing with
Frenzy.
—Ron Lillejord
Frenzy irkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
In 1972, Hitchcock returned to
England to make this cold
blooded, impersonal thriller
about a vicious rapist. While
probably the best of his movies
since Psycho, Frenzy shows
Hitchcock once again flexing the
same muscles—ifs not much fun
anymore. With Jon Finch and (in
an excellent performance) Alex
McCowen.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Frantisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.

Bread and Chocolate ★ ★★
Bridge, San Francisco
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys
tem when he tries to make a go of
it in Switzerland's promised land

doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this film has
a wit and warmth which make it
eminently watchable. Nino Man
fredi, as the immigrant, has one
of those faces which can make
nearly anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece; Franco Brusati directed.
—J.M.
The Goodbye Girl ifk
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil
Simon seem made for each
other: they both laugh too loudly

fans, and there are many, should
find this movie to be entirely
satisfactory, but the film's clinical
approach to comedy (one gets
the feeling that the jokes must
have been fine-tuned by an audi
ence wearing electrodes) is a
turn-off. Herbert Ross (of The
Turning Point and The Sunshine
Boys fame) directed.
—J.M.
The Man Who Loved Women
Wednesday, Bishop ★★★
This, director Francois Truf
faut's most recent work, may be
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible
to them — you will probably have
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiar cards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey
and Leslie Caron.
—R.L.

New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
It's doubtful whether thi;

made into a good movie. How
does one visualize thoughts? Di
rector Joseph Strick's rgponse is
to throw Joyce's narrative into
the movie wholesale.
Material like this needs artists
who will add something of them
selves to the subject and not
someone who tackles Joyce as
written and proceeds to shoot it,
as Strick does. The artist may end
up with a failure, as Stanley Kub
rick did with Nabokov's Lolita,
but there will at least be magic in
it.

The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin

Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '6?. works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" 1 in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Nine Companions from The Lord of the Rings, which opened this week at the UA Pruneyard in
San Jose and at the Regency in San Francisco.
Suspicion ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This rarely shown 1941 Alfred
Hitchcock movie represents
Hitchcock at full strength, glee
fully working within the movie's
morally ambiguous plot. Cary
Grant first worked for Hitchcock
in this movie. His performance is
just about perfect, as is Joan Fon
taine's as the woman whose sus
picions of her new husband's
(Grant) intentions — i.e., will he
kill her? — drive her to the brink
of madness. But wait; are we so
sure that Grant doesn't want to
kill her? With Cedric Hardwicke
and Nigel Bruce; the brilliant
cinematography was done by
Harry Stradling. Playing with
Frenzy.
—Ron Lillejord
Frenzy irkif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
In 1972, Hitchcock returned to
England to make this cold
blooded, impersonal thriller
about a vicious rapist. While
probably the best of his movies
since Psycho, Frenzy shows
Hitchcock once again flexing the
same muscles—ifs not much fun
anymore. With Jon Finch and (in
an excellent performance) Alex
McCowen.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
—Jim Mattson

Violette ★★★
Clay, San Frantisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.
—J.M.
Bread and Chocolate ★ ★★
Bridge, San Francisco
This story of an Italian immig
rant who is battered by the sys

it in Switzerland's promised land

doesn't really seem like the stuff
of great comedy, yet this film has
a wit and warmth which make it
eminently watchable. Nino Man
fredi, as the immigrant, has one
of those faces which can make
nearly anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece; Franco Brusati directed.
—J.M.
The Goodbye Girl ifk
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil
Simon seem made for each
other: they both laugh too loudly

fans, and there are many, should
find this movie to be entirely
satisfactory, but the film's clinical
approach to comedy (one gets
the feeling that the jokes must
have been fine-tuned by an audi
ence wearing electrodes) is a
turn-off. Herbert Ross (of The
Turning Point and The Sunshine
Boys fame) directed.
—J.M.
The Man Who Loved Women
Wednesday, Bishop ★★★
This, director Francois Truf
faut's most recent work, may be
too light for general consump
tion, but if you allow Truffaut his
conceit — that the not-too
attractive male lead, who is ob
sessed with women, is irresistible
to them — you will probably have
a very good time. Truffaut's
charm is here, and his touch is
sure — but he's like a practiced
dealer with familiar cards; it's just
a diversion. With Brigitte Fossey
and Leslie Caron.
—R.L.

A Portrait of the Artist as a Younf>
Man~k*k
New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
It's doubtful whether thi;
lames Joyce novel will ever be
made into a good movie. How
does one visualize thoughts? Di
rector Joseph Strick's rgponse is
to throw Joyce's narrative into
the movie wholesale.
Material like this needs artists
who will add something of them
selves to the subject and not
someone who tackles Joyce as
written and proceeds to shoot it,
as Strick does. The artist may end
up with a failure, as Stanley Kub
rick did with Nabokov's Lolita,
but there will at least be magic in
it.
—R.L.
The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en

larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room.

Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.

Autumn Sonata ififir y 2
Fine Arts, San Francisco
Ingrid Bergman and Liv

film about a parent-child rela

very frustrating, because its lan
guagecannot do justice to either
the performanpes or to
Bergman's assured visual con
ception. But your frustration is,
finally, erased by joy. Even if In

his actresses are, and they take

A Dream of Passion ★★★ v 2
Castro, San Francisco
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on'them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the

night with your mouth open.

Midnight Express

Columbia Pictures proudly

This textbook case of rabid

Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Boys from Brazil itit
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Best described as yet another

off one or two scary moments,

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europei ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure

but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis

on a semi-classy what the hell'

A Portrait of the Artist as a Younf>
Man~k*k
New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
It's doubtful whether thi;
lames Joyce novel will ever be
made into a good movie. How
does one visualize thoughts? Di
rector Joseph Strick's rgponse is
to throw Joyce's narrative into
the movie wholesale.
Material like this needs artists
who will add something of them
selves to the subject and not
someone who tackles Joyce as
written and proceeds to shoot it,
as Strick does. The artist may end
up with a failure, as Stanley Kub
rick did with Nabokov's Lolita,
but there will at least be magic in
it.

The Wii ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en

larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for? Vou can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at. Ev
erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room.

Comes a Horseman
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's not clear here whether this
film is so enjoyable because it re
vives the pleasure of the western
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasura
bly by its performers: Jane
Fonda, James Caan and Jason
Robards, who plays the heavy
with malicious joy.

Autumn Sonata ififir y 2
Fine Arts, San Francisco
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmanrt give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
film about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating, because its lan
guagecannot do justice to either
the performanpes or to
Bergman's assured visual con
ception. But your frustration is,
finally, erased by joy. Even if In
gmar Bergman is not yet ready to
go all the way with a movie again,
his actresses are, and they take
the movie right to the limit, roar
ing through it like two great
ladies of the theater who haven't
lost their zest.

A Dream of Passion ★★★ v 2
Castro, San Francisco
Jules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting and proves that the an
cient bones have flesh on'them
yet. Two women have an explo
sive encounter. One is a success
ful but self-doubting actress who
is rehearsing the role of Medea.
The other is a woman imprisoned
for committing the very crime
that made Medea notorious: she
has slaughtered her own chil
dren.
Melina Mercouri is almost too
big for the screen to contain, yet
she is moving as the actress who
is struggling to be honest to her
art. Ellen Burstyn plays the mod
ern Medea with an astounding
mixture of madness and lucidity.
The film has more murky regions
than it should, and tries a little
too hard to be profound on the
subjects of art and life. Yet, Das
sin probes regions of desire and
rage that are usually hidden, and
scores most of his emotional
point triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein

Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you leave the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.
Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.

The Boys from Brazil itit
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my
self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.
—R.L.
Magic ★★
Alexandria, San Francisco
Best described as yet another
remake of A Star is Born; this time
there's dummy in the Judy Gar
land part and the star-on-the-way
down role is taken by Anthony
Hopkins as a ventriloquist. Direc
tor Richard Attenborough pulls
off one or two scary moments,
but this pseudo-psychological
story of a ventriloquist who be
comes obsessed with his own
mannequin has been done too
many times before — better.

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europei ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as just pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-Jackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.
—R.L.
The Big Fix ★★★
Old Mill
Richard Dreyfuss stars as
Moses Wine, a divorced father
and ex-Berkeley activist. A
former fellow student and lover
(Susan Anspach) reappears and
draws the now cynical Wine back
into the world of moral and polit
ical ideals. The film follows
Wine's struggle between the
reemergence of his old ideals
and his more recently acquired
cynicism.
If you're not interested in a
provocative and sadly humorous
movie, The Big Fix is also a superb
suspense thriller. Moses Wine,
detective, gets caught up in a
dangerous plot to "fix" a guber
natorial campaign.
Occasionally, this ambitious
movie becomes self-conscious
and loses its integration. How
ever, Dreyfuss and his support
ing cast give thoughtful and sub
tle performances even when the
script fails them.
—Amy Gerstin

Animal House ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '6?. works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" 1 in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
