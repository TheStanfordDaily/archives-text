Carter stands by new program
Washington — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday"I do mean business" in sticking to the
administration's new anti-inflation program de
spite what he termed a serious problem of rising
complaints from special interests.
Shrugging off suggestions that his get-tough
economic policies might cost him political sup
port, Carter said on the contrary that they not only
are "necessary for the country" but will prove to
be "good politics."
At a breakfast meeting with reporters at the
White House, the president declared that the al
ternative to his recent intensified efforts to curb
inflation and rescue the dollar might be "a reces
sion or even a depression."
"I intend to hold my course," Carter said. "... I
meant and do mean business."
Across town, Federal Reserve Board Chairman

C. William Miller said public cooperation with
Carter's wage-price guidelines was just as impor
tant as the board's credit-tightening policies in
curbing inflation.
U.S. spy planes flown over Cuba
Washington — U.S. Air Force SR-71 spy planes,
the most sophisticated in the world, have flown
over Cuba in an effort to determine whether new
Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter planes based there are
capable of firing nuclear weapons, administration
sources said last night.
The SR-71 overflights, which must have been
approved by President Carter, are considered so
sensitive that most government officials were or
dered to remain silent about them.
A 1962 understanding between the United
States and Russia, following a near-war crisis over
the presence of Russian offensive missiles in
Cuba, rules out any Soviet nuclear weapons on the
island republic which is just 90 miles from the
United States.
U.S. officials are known to have been deeply
concerned ever since it was established by intelli
gence means that the Russians had sent to Cuba
MiG-235, one of the most advanced of Russia's
fighter aircraft.
The planes had arrived in crates aboard a Rus
sian freighter and officials told The Associated
Press in late October that there were 18 to 20 of
them, comprising about a squadron.
Compromises needed for treaty
Washington — Disappointed with the slow pace
of negotiations, President )immy Carter said yes
terday it may be necessary, "in a few cases," to
modify the Camp David agreements in order to
wrap up a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
In a meeting with reporters, Carter said the two
sides did not trust each other and each was inter
preting the September agreements to its own best
advantage.
The negotiations, now in their sixth week, are
snagged over the Palestinian issue and several
other disputes. In a move to regain lost momen
tum, the United States has proposed that within a
year of the treaty's ratification, elections be held to
set up a Palestinian authority on the West Bank of
the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip.
Cable car involved in accident
San Francisco — They're cranky, cantankerous,
constantly crowded, slower than walking and a
threat to life and limb. But cable cars are San Fran
cisco's calling card to the world, and the city hangs

onto them like a dowager to her first bouquet.
On Tuesday/ an accident threw a gr ipm an
through a windshield and injured 13 passengers.
City officials apologize for such accidents, then
shrug them off and vow to keep the things rolling.
It's certainly not for money or speed. The system
loses $3 million annually and the underground
cable runs no faster than 9 miles an hour. Crum
bled one resident, "They don't climb halfway to
the stars. They barely make it up Nob Hill."
According to the Municipal Railway, which op
erates the cable cars along with city streetcars and
buses, 490 accidents occurred in the last fiscal year
on the cable car line. Most involved damage to
other vehicles, and none involved fatalities. But at
least 164 involved injuries, and there have been
two deaths the past five years.
Pope urges simplicity for nuns
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II urged nuns
yesterday to look like nuns, always to wear their
"simple and apt" habits to demonstrate their re
ligious status. He warned them against being
overwhelmed by "public opinion, even an
ecclesiastic one."
Addressing about 600 mother superiors of re
ligious orders, the pope said nuns should not
permit any feminist claim to overshadow their call
to a chaste, poor and obedient life in the Roman
Catholic Church.
"Yes, my sisters, in the church you can show the
proper place of women," he said.
The appeal came four days after a gathering of
American nuns and lay Catholic women in Balti
more demanded admission of women into the
priesthood. The American conference cited the
church's "structural sin of parochial sexism and
said it would send a delegation to explain its case
Wall Street shows improvement
; New York — The stock market took to heart a
Carter administration vote of confidence in the
economy today and used it as an excuse for Wall
Street's strongest rally in days.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrial issues
shot ahead 8.58 to 794.18, although analysts said
the rise was somewhat blunted by continued un
certainty over the long-range effects of President
Carter's anti-inflation program.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through Big Game day except patchy
late night and morning fog. Little temperature
change. Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs mid-50s to
mid-60s. Winds variable to 15 mph.

Carter administration vote of confidence in the
economy today and used it as an excuse for Wall
Street's strongest rally in days.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrial issues
shot ahead 8.58 to 794.18, although analysts said
the rise was somewhat blunted by continued un
certainty over the long-range effects of President
Carter's anti-inflation program.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through Big Game day except patchy
late night and morning fog. Little temperature
change. Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs mid-50s to
mid-60s. Winds variable to 15 mph.
Carter stands by new program
Washington — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday"I do mean business" in sticking to the
administration's new anti-inflation program de
spite what he termed a serious problem of rising
complaints from special interests.
Shrugging off suggestions that his get-tough
economic policies might cost him political sup
port, Carter said on the contrary that they not only
are "necessary for the country" but will prove to
be "good politics."
At a breakfast meeting with reporters at the
White House, the president declared that the al
ternative to his recent intensified efforts to curb
inflation and rescue the dollar might be "a reces
sion or even a depression."
"I intend to hold my course," Carter said. "... I
meant and do mean business."
Across town, Federal Reserve Board Chairman

C. William Miller said public cooperation with
Carter's wage-price guidelines was just as impor
tant as the board's credit-tightening policies in
curbing inflation.
U.S. spy planes flown over Cuba
Washington — U.S. Air Force SR-71 spy planes,
the most sophisticated in the world, have flown
over Cuba in an effort to determine whether new
Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter planes based there are
capable of firing nuclear weapons, administration
sources said last night.
The SR-71 overflights, which must have been
approved by President Carter, are considered so
sensitive that most government officials were or
dered to remain silent about them.
A 1962 understanding between the United
States and Russia, following a near-war crisis over
the presence of Russian offensive missiles in
Cuba, rules out any Soviet nuclear weapons on the
island republic which is just 90 miles from the
United States.
U.S. officials are known to have been deeply
concerned ever since it was established by intelli
gence means that the Russians had sent to Cuba
MiG-235, one of the most advanced of Russia's
fighter aircraft.
The planes had arrived in crates aboard a Rus
sian freighter and officials told The Associated
Press in late October that there were 18 to 20 of
them, comprising about a squadron.
Compromises needed for treaty
Washington — Disappointed with the slow pace
of negotiations, President )immy Carter said yes
terday it may be necessary, "in a few cases," to
modify the Camp David agreements in order to
wrap up a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
In a meeting with reporters, Carter said the two
sides did not trust each other and each was inter
preting the September agreements to its own best
advantage.
The negotiations, now in their sixth week, are
snagged over the Palestinian issue and several
other disputes. In a move to regain lost momen
tum, the United States has proposed that within a
year of the treaty's ratification, elections be held to
set up a Palestinian authority on the West Bank of
the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip.
Cable car involved in accident
San Francisco — They're cranky, cantankerous,
constantly crowded, slower than walking and a
threat to life and limb. But cable cars are San Fran
cisco's calling card to the world, and the city hangs

onto them like a dowager to her first bouquet.
On Tuesday/ an accident threw a gr ipm an
through a windshield and injured 13 passengers.
City officials apologize for such accidents, then
shrug them off and vow to keep the things rolling.
It's certainly not for money or speed. The system
loses $3 million annually and the underground
cable runs no faster than 9 miles an hour. Crum
bled one resident, "They don't climb halfway to
the stars. They barely make it up Nob Hill."
According to the Municipal Railway, which op
erates the cable cars along with city streetcars and
buses, 490 accidents occurred in the last fiscal year
on the cable car line. Most involved damage to
other vehicles, and none involved fatalities. But at
least 164 involved injuries, and there have been
two deaths the past five years.
Pope urges simplicity for nuns
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II urged nuns
yesterday to look like nuns, always to wear their
"simple and apt" habits to demonstrate their re
ligious status. He warned them against being
overwhelmed by "public opinion, even an
ecclesiastic one."
Addressing about 600 mother superiors of re
ligious orders, the pope said nuns should not
permit any feminist claim to overshadow their call
to a chaste, poor and obedient life in the Roman
Catholic Church.
"Yes, my sisters, in the church you can show the
proper place of women," he said.
The appeal came four days after a gathering of
American nuns and lay Catholic women in Balti
more demanded admission of women into the
priesthood. The American conference cited the
church's "structural sin of parochial sexism and
said it would send a delegation to explain its case

Addressing about 600 mother superiors of re

Catholic Church.
"Yes, my sisters, in the church you can show the
proper place of women," he said.

Wall Street shows improvement
; New York — The stock market took to heart a
Carter administration vote of confidence in the
economy today and used it as an excuse for Wall
Street's strongest rally in days.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrial issues
shot ahead 8.58 to 794.18, although analysts said
the rise was somewhat blunted by continued un
certainty over the long-range effects of President
Carter's anti-inflation program.

Carter stands by new program
Washington — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday"I do mean business" in sticking to the
administration's new anti-inflation program de
spite what he termed a serious problem of rising
complaints from special interests.
Shrugging off suggestions that his get-tough
economic policies might cost him political sup
port, Carter said on the contrary that they not only
are "necessary for the country" but will prove to
be "good politics."
At a breakfast meeting with reporters at the
White House, the president declared that the al
ternative to his recent intensified efforts to curb
inflation and rescue the dollar might be "a reces
sion or even a depression."
"I intend to hold my course," Carter said. "... I
meant and do mean business."
Across town, Federal Reserve Board Chairman

C. William Miller said public cooperation with
Carter's wage-price guidelines was just as impor
tant as the board's credit-tightening policies in
curbing inflation.
U.S. spy planes flown over Cuba
Washington — U.S. Air Force SR-71 spy planes,
the most sophisticated in the world, have flown
over Cuba in an effort to determine whether new
Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter planes based there are
capable of firing nuclear weapons, administration
sources said last night.
The SR-71 overflights, which must have been
approved by President Carter, are considered so
sensitive that most government officials were or
dered to remain silent about them.
A 1962 understanding between the United
States and Russia, following a near-war crisis over
the presence of Russian offensive missiles in
Cuba, rules out any Soviet nuclear weapons on the
island republic which is just 90 miles from the
United States.
U.S. officials are known to have been deeply
concerned ever since it was established by intelli
gence means that the Russians had sent to Cuba
MiG-235, one of the most advanced of Russia's
fighter aircraft.
The planes had arrived in crates aboard a Rus
sian freighter and officials told The Associated
Press in late October that there were 18 to 20 of
them, comprising about a squadron.
Compromises needed for treaty
Washington — Disappointed with the slow pace
of negotiations, President )immy Carter said yes
terday it may be necessary, "in a few cases," to
modify the Camp David agreements in order to
wrap up a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
In a meeting with reporters, Carter said the two
sides did not trust each other and each was inter
preting the September agreements to its own best
advantage.
The negotiations, now in their sixth week, are
snagged over the Palestinian issue and several
other disputes. In a move to regain lost momen
tum, the United States has proposed that within a
year of the treaty's ratification, elections be held to
set up a Palestinian authority on the West Bank of
the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip.
Cable car involved in accident
San Francisco — They're cranky, cantankerous,
constantly crowded, slower than walking and a
threat to life and limb. But cable cars are San Fran
cisco's calling card to the world, and the city hangs

onto them like a dowager to her first bouquet.
On Tuesday/ an accident threw a gr ipm an
through a windshield and injured 13 passengers.
City officials apologize for such accidents, then
shrug them off and vow to keep the things rolling.
It's certainly not for money or speed. The system
loses $3 million annually and the underground
cable runs no faster than 9 miles an hour. Crum
bled one resident, "They don't climb halfway to
the stars. They barely make it up Nob Hill."
According to the Municipal Railway, which op
erates the cable cars along with city streetcars and
buses, 490 accidents occurred in the last fiscal year
on the cable car line. Most involved damage to
other vehicles, and none involved fatalities. But at
least 164 involved injuries, and there have been
two deaths the past five years.
Pope urges simplicity for nuns
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II urged nuns
yesterday to look like nuns, always to wear their
"simple and apt" habits to demonstrate their re
ligious status. He warned them against being
overwhelmed by "public opinion, even an
ecclesiastic one."
Addressing about 600 mother superiors of re
ligious orders, the pope said nuns should not
permit any feminist claim to overshadow their call
to a chaste, poor and obedient life in the Roman
