# Survey ranks Stanford among 10 most influential schools
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
The University is among the 10 most influential
academic institutions in the nation, according to a re
cent survey of 546 college presidents and academic
deans.
Others in the top 10 are, in alphabetical order: Col
umbia, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Berkeley, UCLA, Univ.
of Chicago, Univ. of Michigan and Yale.
The survey was conducted by Richard Johnson, direc
tor of research for the Exxon Foundation in New York
C'ty-
The results are reported in the November issue of
Change magazine, and do not include any individual
rankings within the top 10.
A great deal of controversy has arisen over past studies
that have ranked academic institutions by peer judg
ments of their graduate and professional programs,
Johnson writes in the Change article.
According to Johnson, the new survey differs from the
previous rankings in that "our question focused on at

tributes of leadership at the institutional level rather
than on individual graduate or professional programs."
Leadership, Johnson said, comprises three basic
senses, all of which the survey was intended to reflect.
1) Prestige — the degree to which an institution is
looked up to or admired.
2) Innovation — the frequency with which an institu
tion is first in generating new ideas or programs.
3) Influence — the degree to which other institutions
follow the leading institution's example.
The survey shows strong agreement on such a list of
"leading'' institutions. For on the question of which
institutions have the most influence nationally, 84 per
cent of the administrators at major doctorate-granting
universities agreed on the same group of 10.
Responses from 75 percent of the comprehensive col
leges and universities, 71 percent of the liberal arts col
leges and 52 percent of the community colleges agreed
on the same top 10 list.
Change's survey sought out information from all types
of academic institutions, where past surveys had polled

only institutions having graduate and professional
schools.
But when asked about sources of influence on their
own institutions, the citations "diverged widely,"
Johnson said.
Presidents and deans of liberal arts colleges men
tioned the larger universities only 12 percent of the time
as sources of national influence, but cited other liberal
arts schools as influential on their own program 51 per
cent of the time.
Similar but less pronounced patterns were found for
community colleges and comprehensive colleges and
universities.
However, smaller schools and community colleges
also tended to look "closer to home" for sources of
educational influence, according to Johnson. In fact,
respondents from community colleges were three to
five times as likely to refer to other institutions within the
same state as were those from doctorate-granting uni
versities.
This was "a tendency that showed up in response to

the entire spectrum of questions asked."
Liberal arts colleges were most often cited as leaders
in educational innovation by administrators from all
types of four-year institutions and from doctorate
granting institutions.
Johnson says he sees a,definite paradox in the results
of his survey: all institutions tended to agree upon a set
of leading institutions which influence other colleges
and universities. But when reporting on the influence on
their own institutions, they also agreed that these na
tionally influential institutions do not influence them.
The Change study calls into serious questions the
utility of the simple rank orderings reported in past
reputation surveys, Johnson adds.
"(The survey) suggests that broader issues of educa
tion involving undergraduate as well as graduate prog
rams ought to be carefully considered whenever institu
tions are ranked.
"The structure of American education is far too com
plex to be understood in relation to any single academic
procession," he said.

Written, directed, acted, produced, choreographed and constructed by Ram's
Head, Gaieties is a traditional pre-Big Game cultural event which this year pokes
fun at the myths and mores of Stanford students. It even features the irrepressible
Fred Hargadon. Last night's performance ended orgiastically with a frenzied
appearance by the truly Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band. Not to be missed, if you can still get tickets.
