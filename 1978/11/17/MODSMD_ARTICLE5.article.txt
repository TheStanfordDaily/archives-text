# AP reporter trades pants for lost youth in Band visit

STANFORD — It's football
Saturday and the Stanford march
ing band bursts into the stadium,
a moment of high drama repeated
weekly by hundreds of college
bands across the country. But
there's a different drummer at
work here.
As high-stepping drum majors
dressed like toy soldiers lead pre
cision marching units onto the
turf of the Ann Arbors and the Col
lege Parks, the Incomparable Le
land Stanford Jr. University
Marching Band scrambles onto
the field behind a young man
wearing a shimmering silver jump
suit and mirrored sun glasses, and
a woman dressed like a tree.
While other bands play fight
songs, the world's biggest rock
and-roll band belts out "All Right
Now." And just before breaking
into that rock standard* one
bandsman is wrestled to the
ground and his pants are taken
off.
That bandsman is me.
Rah. Rah. Rah.
As it must to all men, maturity
came to me. I grew up before
84,000 fans as 10 young men pul
led off my trousers. I was 33.
What began as just another

story quickly came to symbolize
my quest for lost youth. I spent a
week on campus attending re
hearsals, drinking beer and fi
nally, showing up Saturday in my
borrowed uniform. The red blazer
and black slacks — I already had
the mandatory atrocious tie —
gave me the appearance of a
bonafide bandsman, except I had
wrinkles where they had acne.
)ust six days earlier I bought a
new reed for my musty
saxophone and drove south from
San Francisco for my first rehear
sal, trying to remember which
keys produced which notes.
I was met by band manager Alex
Jardetzky. Forthepast 15years the
band has been run by the students
and this year it's Jardetzky's turn.
He briefed me.
In 1963 the band was like those
at most other colleges. Then
bandsmen went on strike, shuck
ing their military uniforms and
demanding independence. They
got it.
Inside the cover of the band's
handbook is their motto: "Sex,
Drugs and Violence." The intro
duction says: "There are no dis
appearing diamond formations.
We don't play the theme from
'Rocky,' or the theme from 'Star
Wars.' We do not play 'You Light

Up My Life.'
"Everything we do is sick. No
thing we do is tasteful. And some
of usdrinkandstayoutdoingCod
knows what until very late at
night."
But there's concern behind the
flippant front that their image may
be improving.
"We've become socialiy ac
ceptable,"-said Randy Devol, as
sistant manager. "Back in 1963
when the band went on strike,
they were a bunch of nerds — a
band of social outcasts. Now,
we're more tame."
After Monday's rehearsal, I join
SMUT — Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers — some 30 bandsmen
who write the shows while sitting
around a keg of beer.
The shows are often risque and
raunchy, sprinkled with obscure
humor, phallic formations and
social comment. This year's
shows have included "salutes" to
discrimination, office supplies
and the Middle East peace talks.
This Saturday would be no dif
ferent. Stanford was playing the
University of Southern California
and the Trojans were bringing
their 250-member band, a tough
challenge for the 150 in the
LS)UMB.
SMUT participants present

show ideas — suggesting musical
numbers and drawing formations
on a blackboard. Some of the
schemes prompt a barrage of
obscenities and empty beer cans.
Plans finally are completed for
the pre-game show — "The Sack
of Troy." The halftime show is a
look at the state election.
Drum major David Ford has had
a bad week. He runs rehearsals
and has been the target of curses,
spit balls and beer cans. Every
thing from his musical knowledge
to his masculinity has been chal
lenged.
Perched atop a tower just be
fore the game, he delivers his pep
talk, paraphrased here for the
sake of decency.
"The 'SC band is full of mean
people. They don't like you and
they don't like themselves. What
are we gonna do about it? We're
gonna take drugs. We're gonna
take alcohol. We're gonna be
messed up and we're gonna mess
them up."
The pre-game show is over and
I've recovered my pants.
I join a group sitting on the
grass in front of the student sec
tion. A trumpet player unpacks an
electric blender, ice, rum and
several dozen bananas. After a
