Lights — Camera — Action.
Brightly lit interior. Faded
sofa. Woman upstage right.
Man enters. Action.
"Are you ready to shoot?
Shall we run through it again?
Do you have the feeling of
anger, John? OK let's go.
Walk in briskly, lacky, do you
have it down? A two-step mo
tion — pick up the coat, wait
for my cue and drop it behind
the couch."
One crew member taking
light meter readings. "We've
got a problem here. There is
one-stop difference between
their faces and the floor. We
need more fill lights. Alisa we'll
shoot at FB, about 12 feet with a
medium shot. OK."
"Let's go." Camera rolls.
Man enters.
"Good, good, great expres
sion. I like the tension. Nice
movement. OK, slap, slap,
slap. Great."
Man grabs woman, she es
capes. He catches her again.
Begins to choke her.
"Great facial. Nice turn.
Camera rolling. Keep up the
action. OK cut."
The scene is really taking
place in Spruce Hall at the Uni
versity's Department of Com
munication. Two graduate stu
dents are crewing for a
member of their class in a film
exercise. A student is crewing
when he works on a film's pro
duction crew. Two under
graduates have been drafted to
help with the theatrics of the
exercise in a typical filming
session that may last from four
to eight hours to produce from
two to three minutes of
finished product.
There are nine graduate stu
dents in film studies here,
working under the direction of
Ron Alexander and Julian
Blaustein, adjunct professors.
Alexander and Blaustein are
also responsible for the under
graduate, two-quarter film
sequence offered in the Com
munication Department.
"We offer a pre-professional
program for undergraduates.
When they finish, they can bet
ter decide their strengths with
a substantive touch of insight
into their own responses about
what the medium means to
them," commented Blaustein.

Lex Passaris, one of the 26
students enrolled in "Writing
for Film," stated that in the un
dergraduate program, the stu
dent makes one short 16mm
film. "If you get lucky and do a
good job, it can be a foot in the
door in terms ofa job," hesaid.
The film sequence was rede
signed this year. "We used to
offer a packaged deal, simul
taneously offering writing,
pre-production and filming all
in one undergraduate course.
Communication 9()," Blaustein
said.
"They are now offered con
secutively. We want to put less
pressure on the under
graduate. The point of the sep
aration is for the students to do
the original, creative, concep
tualization without the pres
sure of the technology," he
added.
"We had to come up with
four concepts this quarter for
our film next quarter. The con
cepts are discussed in c lass and
then a meeting is scheduled
with one of the professors to
discuss the pre-production de
tails," Passaris said.
Graduate students receive
more comprehensive training
in pre-production work and
filming. "In the first quarter,
the grad students get training
in a documentary approach,
voice-over and the interview,
but they also do fiction writing.
In that way the student has a
chance to find out what his or
her interests are," stated Blaus
tein.
Don Sellers enrolled in the
graduate film program after
five years of "bumming
around.'' He received his
bachelor's degree in biology at
Cornell University. "I'm in
terested in scientific educa
tional films and Stanford has
one of the best science de
partments around," he com
mented.
Sellers sees the program as
an apprenticeship. One of the
program's drawbacks is that it
is just not long enough. "But
the costs for a longer program
would make it available to only
the very rich," he said.
Students are required to pay
for film and processing.
Cameras, both 16mm and
"Super Eight," are available as
is lighting equipment from the

Communication Department.
Ethiopian student Awetu
Simesso is interested in mak
ing political films when he re
turns home. "There is not
much demand for feature films
in Ethiopia/" he said. Simesso
also has plans to complete a
Ph.D. in political science.
Film-making is more of
sidelight, he added.
Students admit there are
many frustrations in complet
ing a film. Alisa Matovsky, a
member of the graduate prog
ram, said that she was going to
reshoot the entire first exercise
students were assigned. "I
hate it. It's all wrong," she said.
Finding the time is the prob
lem. "It is worthless to shoot
without planning out all the
shots in advance and that takes
an incredible amount of time,"
she stated.
Sellers said that by the time a
fine cut (the linished film) is
completed, it is difficult to
judge what is good. "Especially
in the editing room, the cuts all
begin to look the same," he
said. Students have approxi
mately three weeks to film and
edit assigned exercises. Sound
is added later.
Stan Gibbs, another
graduate, came to the LJniver
sity after three years in Los
Angeles working the film field.
"I looked at USC and UCLA but
found the people unfriendly,"
he said. Gibbs is interested in
making commercial Hol
lywood movies. "I like to tell
stories," he says.
Gibbs said that even after
completing the program here a
student is still not ready to
begin work in the field. "It is
wrong to think that Stanford is
the big ticket to success," he
commented. "When I finish I'll
have a better idea of my ta
lents. It will point me in a direc
tion towards some aspect of
the industry," he said.
"We stress the involvement
of the T.A.s and faculty with the
students," said Alexander. The
small size of both the graduate
and undergraduate program,
which is limited to 16 under
graduate in the production
stage, makes interaction bet
ween the staff and the students
possible.
"The making of feature films
is just not feasible in the li

mited time available,' said
Blaustein. That is one of the
reasons that the University film
students have a reputation for
filming "documentaries," Ale
xander said.
When the lights go on and
the director yells go — that's
when students feel the excite
ment of film making.
Lights — Action — Camera.
"Rolling. Great, love that re
verse. No, stop. Let's try that
again."
"Remember to wait for my
cue. You really get into the
strangling part. Let's go."
"Rolling. Briskly, look
around, split your focus. She
doesn't know that you saw the
man. You do a complete per
sonality change. Angry. Crab
her. Cut."

Getting the perfect shot for a film sometimes requires working in unusual body positions.

film. "If you get lucky and do a
good job, it can be a foot in the

The film sequence was rede
signed this year. "We used to
offer a packaged deal, simul
taneously offering writing,
pre-production and filming all
in one undergraduate course.

said.
"They are now offered con
secutively. We want to put less
pressure on the under
graduate. The point of the sep
aration is for the students to do
the original, creative, concep
tualization without the pres
sure of the technology," he
added.
"We had to come up with
four concepts this quarter for
our film next quarter. The con
cepts are discussed in c lass and
then a meeting is scheduled
with one of the professors to
discuss the pre-production de
tails," Passaris said.
Graduate students receive
more comprehensive training
in pre-production work and
filming. "In the first quarter,
the grad students get training
in a documentary approach,
voice-over and the interview,
but they also do fiction writing.
In that way the student has a
chance to find out what his or
her interests are," stated Blaus

Don Sellers enrolled in the
graduate film program after
five years of "bumming
around.'' He received his
bachelor's degree in biology at
Cornell University. "I'm in
terested in scientific educa
tional films and Stanford has
one of the best science de
partments around," he com
mented.
Sellers sees the program as
an apprenticeship. One of the
program's drawbacks is that it
is just not long enough. "But
the costs for a longer program
would make it available to only
the very rich," he said.
Students are required to pay
for film and processing.
Cameras, both 16mm and
"Super Eight," are available as
is lighting equipment from the

Communication Department.
Ethiopian student Awetu
Simesso is interested in mak
ing political films when he re
turns home. "There is not
much demand for feature films
in Ethiopia/" he said. Simesso
also has plans to complete a
Ph.D. in political science.
Film-making is more of
sidelight, he added.
Students admit there are
many frustrations in complet
ing a film. Alisa Matovsky, a
member of the graduate prog
ram, said that she was going to
reshoot the entire first exercise
students were assigned. "I
hate it. It's all wrong," she said.
Finding the time is the prob
lem. "It is worthless to shoot
without planning out all the
shots in advance and that takes
an incredible amount of time,"
she stated.
Sellers said that by the time a
fine cut (the linished film) is
completed, it is difficult to
judge what is good. "Especially
in the editing room, the cuts all
begin to look the same," he
said. Students have approxi
mately three weeks to film and
edit assigned exercises. Sound
is added later.
Stan Gibbs, another
graduate, came to the LJniver
sity after three years in Los
Angeles working the film field.
"I looked at USC and UCLA but
found the people unfriendly,"
he said. Gibbs is interested in
making commercial Hol
lywood movies. "I like to tell
stories," he says.
Gibbs said that even after
completing the program here a
student is still not ready to
begin work in the field. "It is
wrong to think that Stanford is
the big ticket to success," he
commented. "When I finish I'll
have a better idea of my ta
lents. It will point me in a direc
tion towards some aspect of
the industry," he said.
"We stress the involvement
of the T.A.s and faculty with the
students," said Alexander. The
small size of both the graduate
and undergraduate program,
which is limited to 16 under
graduate in the production
stage, makes interaction bet
ween the staff and the students
possible.
"The making of feature films
is just not feasible in the li

mited time available,' said
Blaustein. That is one of the
reasons that the University film
students have a reputation for
filming "documentaries," Ale
xander said.

ing a film. Alisa Matovsky, a
member of the graduate prog
ram, said that she was going to
reshoot the entire first exercise
students were assigned. "I
hate it. It's all wrong," she said.
Finding the time is the prob
lem. "It is worthless to shoot
without planning out all the
shots in advance and that takes
an incredible amount of time,"
she stated.
Sellers said that by the time a
fine cut (the linished film) is
completed, it is difficult to
judge what is good. "Especially
in the editing room, the cuts all
begin to look the same," he
said. Students have approxi
mately three weeks to film and
edit assigned exercises. Sound
is added later.
Stan Gibbs, another
graduate, came to the LJniver
sity after three years in Los
Angeles working the film field.
"I looked at USC and UCLA but
found the people unfriendly,"
he said. Gibbs is interested in
making commercial Hol
lywood movies. "I like to tell
stories," he says.
Gibbs said that even after
completing the program here a
student is still not ready to
begin work in the field. "It is
wrong to think that Stanford is
the big ticket to success," he
commented. "When I finish I'll
have a better idea of my ta
lents. It will point me in a direc
tion towards some aspect of
the industry," he said.
"We stress the involvement
of the T.A.s and faculty with the
students," said Alexander. The
small size of both the graduate
and undergraduate program,
which is limited to 16 under
graduate in the production
stage, makes interaction bet
ween the staff and the students
possible.
"The making of feature films
is just not feasible in the li

mited time available,' said
Blaustein. That is one of the
reasons that the University film
students have a reputation for
filming "documentaries," Ale
xander said.
When the lights go on and

when students feel the excite

Lights — Action — Camera.

"Remember to wait for my
cue. You really get into the

"Rolling. Briskly, look
around, split your focus. She
doesn't know that you saw the

sonality change. Angry. Crab
her. Cut."

Shall we run through it again?
Do you have the feeling of

Walk in briskly, lacky, do you
have it down? A two-step mo

The scene is really taking
place in Spruce Hall at the Uni
versity's Department of Com
munication. Two graduate stu
dents are crewing for a
member of their class in a film
exercise. A student is crewing
when he works on a film's pro
duction crew. Two under
graduates have been drafted to
help with the theatrics of the
exercise in a typical filming
session that may last from four
to eight hours to produce from
two to three minutes of
finished product.
There are nine graduate stu
dents in film studies here,
working under the direction of
Ron Alexander and Julian
Blaustein, adjunct professors.
Alexander and Blaustein are
also responsible for the under
graduate, two-quarter film
sequence offered in the Com
munication Department.
"We offer a pre-professional
program for undergraduates.
When they finish, they can bet
ter decide their strengths with
a substantive touch of insight
into their own responses about
what the medium means to
them," commented Blaustein.

Lex Passaris, one of the 26
students enrolled in "Writing
for Film," stated that in the un
dergraduate program, the stu
dent makes one short 16mm
film. "If you get lucky and do a
good job, it can be a foot in the
door in terms ofa job," hesaid.
The film sequence was rede
signed this year. "We used to
offer a packaged deal, simul
taneously offering writing,
pre-production and filming all
in one undergraduate course.
Communication 9()," Blaustein
said.
"They are now offered con
secutively. We want to put less
pressure on the under
graduate. The point of the sep
aration is for the students to do
the original, creative, concep
tualization without the pres
sure of the technology," he
added.
"We had to come up with
four concepts this quarter for
our film next quarter. The con
cepts are discussed in c lass and
then a meeting is scheduled
with one of the professors to
discuss the pre-production de
tails," Passaris said.
Graduate students receive
more comprehensive training
in pre-production work and
filming. "In the first quarter,
the grad students get training
in a documentary approach,
voice-over and the interview,
but they also do fiction writing.
In that way the student has a
chance to find out what his or
her interests are," stated Blaus
tein.
Don Sellers enrolled in the
graduate film program after
five years of "bumming
around.'' He received his
bachelor's degree in biology at
Cornell University. "I'm in
terested in scientific educa
tional films and Stanford has
one of the best science de
partments around," he com
mented.
Sellers sees the program as
an apprenticeship. One of the
program's drawbacks is that it
is just not long enough. "But
the costs for a longer program
would make it available to only
the very rich," he said.
Students are required to pay
for film and processing.
Cameras, both 16mm and
"Super Eight," are available as
is lighting equipment from the

Communication Department.

Simesso is interested in mak
ing political films when he re
turns home. "There is not
