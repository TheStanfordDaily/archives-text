# Repression in Russia addressed
## Speakers discuss human rights 
### CARLA NEASEL 
"The people of Iran don't mind giving
up their lives for their children or brothers
and sisters because life isn't worth any
thing, even though it's all many of them
have."
Margaret McQuade was one of the
speakers at a human rights forum spon
sored by the Toyon Hall residential educa
tion program. She and six other speakers
talked to a sparse audience of approxi
mately 15 people about human rights vio
lations throughout the world. The forum
was held on Tuesday and Wednesday.
McQuade's remarks, based on personal
experiences, seemed to hold the most in
terest for the majority of the listeners. A
registered nurse, she went to Iran as a
member of a medical team to offer aid to
the victims of an earthquake which killed
26,000 people.
While in Iran, McQuade was "made
sick" by the extent of American influence
there, she said. "One out of the three T.V.
stations there is in English and addresses
American issues. There are at least two
English newspapers, and nearly every sign
is bilingual."
McQuade said she thinks the reason for
the United States' support of the shah
stems from the "military, economic and
oil interests we (United States) have
there." She said that Iran is "strategically
located on the border of Russia," and that
the United States has several military bases
there.
Since her purpose in going to Iran was to

assist earthquake victims, McQuade vis
ited several cities which were "neatly
wiped out." One huge city was "100 per
cent demolished." The people living
there, she said, have no water, no clo
thing, no food, and are tired of being cal
led "fortunate" to still have their lives.
"Seventy percent of the people have eye
disease from the flies which feed on the
mucus; they are all malnourished; many
ot them have ulcers from the high amount
of stress.
"This is the shah's modernization," she
mocked.
McQuade said she feels a regime result
ing from the overthrow of the shah "would
have to be a democratic one. All of the
opposition movements are calling for
democracy and for an independent gov
ernment, not a puppet."
Another speaker who seemed to evoke
strong interest from the listeners was
Steve Eillan, a member of Amnesty Inter
national, who spoke on psychiatric abuse
in Russia.
Fillam said that in the Soviet Union,
"political opinions are a basis for declaring
a person mentally insane.
"Insanity is any display of non
conformity," he said. According to Fillan,
nonconformist behavior includes holding
certain religious beliefs, being critical of
party practices, calling for basic human
rights, and in general, "the conception of
any independent thought which the Rus
sian government is afraid may lead to re
bellious thoughts."

One of the horrors of Soviet psychiatric
confinement, said Fillan, is that the doc
tors "can do anything" to the patients
once they are committed. "Behind the
barbed wire and the dogs, horrible things
go on," injections, torture and human ex
perimentation among them, he said.
"Russia is the most evolved repressive
country in the world today."
But Fillan said there is reason for hope.
He noted the number of political prisoners
who are now being freed in Russia.
•"Something happens when people re
fuse to give up their dignity which is
beyond analyzation," he said. Perhaps in
the back of their minds, the Soviet leaders
"feel shame" for what they are doing.
Fillan quickly pointed out, however,
that the increase in the number of releases
is due to fear. "The Russians are afraid.
The publicity by Amnesty and other
groups is embarrassing, and it could lead
to less trade, sales and dollar bills.
"But most of all, the Russians fear their
own people. They fear a workers' move
ment more than anything else."
The Russians "want to be able to control
society absolutely," said Fillan, "but they
can't."
Fillan denied that the Soviets were up
holding a strict political code, and said
"there are very few true communists in
Russia. The people in charge only believe
in power and position." FHe cited an exam
ple where a man was committed to a
psychiatric hospital because he suffered
from "a mania for Marxism."
"The people of Iran don't mind giving
up their lives for their children or brothers
and sisters because life isn't worth any
thing, even though it's all many of them

McQuade said she feels a regime result
ing from the overthrow of the shah "would
have to be a democratic one. All of the
opposition movements are calling for
democracy and for an independent gov
ernment, not a puppet."
Another speaker who seemed to evoke
strong interest from the listeners was
Steve Eillan, a member of Amnesty Inter
national, who spoke on psychiatric abuse
in Russia.
Fillam said that in the Soviet Union,
"political opinions are a basis for declaring
a person mentally insane.
"Insanity is any display of non
conformity," he said. According to Fillan,
nonconformist behavior includes holding
certain religious beliefs, being critical of
party practices, calling for basic human
rights, and in general, "the conception of
any independent thought which the Rus
sian government is afraid may lead to re
bellious thoughts."

One of the horrors of Soviet psychiatric
confinement, said Fillan, is that the doc
tors "can do anything" to the patients
once they are committed. "Behind the
barbed wire and the dogs, horrible things
go on," injections, torture and human ex
perimentation among them, he said.
"Russia is the most evolved repressive
country in the world today."
But Fillan said there is reason for hope.
He noted the number of political prisoners
who are now being freed in Russia.
•"Something happens when people re
fuse to give up their dignity which is
beyond analyzation," he said. Perhaps in
the back of their minds, the Soviet leaders
"feel shame" for what they are doing.
Fillan quickly pointed out, however,
that the increase in the number of releases
is due to fear. "The Russians are afraid.
The publicity by Amnesty and other
groups is embarrassing, and it could lead
to less trade, sales and dollar bills.
"But most of all, the Russians fear their
own people. They fear a workers' move
ment more than anything else."
The Russians "want to be able to control
society absolutely," said Fillan, "but they
can't."
Fillan denied that the Soviets were up
holding a strict political code, and said
"there are very few true communists in
Russia. The people in charge only believe
in power and position." FHe cited an exam
ple where a man was committed to a
psychiatric hospital because he suffered
from "a mania for Marxism."
"The people of Iran don't mind giving
up their lives for their children or brothers
and sisters because life isn't worth any
thing, even though it's all many of them
have."
Margaret McQuade was one of the
speakers at a human rights forum spon
sored by the Toyon Hall residential educa
tion program. She and six other speakers
talked to a sparse audience of approxi
mately 15 people about human rights vio
lations throughout the world. The forum
was held on Tuesday and Wednesday.
McQuade's remarks, based on personal
experiences, seemed to hold the most in
terest for the majority of the listeners. A
registered nurse, she went to Iran as a
member of a medical team to offer aid to
the victims of an earthquake which killed
26,000 people.
While in Iran, McQuade was "made
sick" by the extent of American influence
there, she said. "One out of the three T.V.
stations there is in English and addresses
American issues. There are at least two
English newspapers, and nearly every sign
is bilingual."
McQuade said she thinks the reason for
the United States' support of the shah
stems from the "military, economic and
oil interests we (United States) have
there." She said that Iran is "strategically
located on the border of Russia," and that
the United States has several military bases
there.
Since her purpose in going to Iran was to

assist earthquake victims, McQuade vis
ited several cities which were "neatly
wiped out." One huge city was "100 per
cent demolished." The people living
there, she said, have no water, no clo
thing, no food, and are tired of being cal
led "fortunate" to still have their lives.
"Seventy percent of the people have eye
disease from the flies which feed on the
mucus; they are all malnourished; many
ot them have ulcers from the high amount
of stress.
"This is the shah's modernization," she
mocked.
McQuade said she feels a regime result
ing from the overthrow of the shah "would
have to be a democratic one. All of the
opposition movements are calling for
democracy and for an independent gov
