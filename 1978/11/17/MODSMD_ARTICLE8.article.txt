# Bug Me
## 
### Alison Carpenter 
I have been on the staff in the Medical School
for 10 years and during those 10 years I have
found the Stanford Daily stacked in a different
location around the Medical Center nearly every
morning.
Sometimes I can't find it at all. Other times
when I do find it, it looks like a wet dishrag.
Occasionally I am lucky and find it high and dry
on the counter at the Bank of America in the
Shopping Center.
My question is: Would it be possible to have
permanent stands or boxes located around the
medical center in various central locations
where the Daily could be stacked high and dry as
in the bank?
-L.F.
Stacy Azama, circulation manager for the
Daily, said it doesn't look like any such stands
will be placed there in the near future.
"My main concern is with the expense for the
Daily since we are a non-profit organization,"
she said, and the stands cost $70 each.
She also said there is a maintenance problem
with old papers piling up in the stands.
Regarding the issue of the regularity of deliv
ery locations, Azama said, "If my delivery
people are being that negligent, I'll check upon
them and make sure they're dropping it in the
same place every day."

What is the highest salary of any Stanford
graduate currently living?

"That's information we have to keep confi
dential in order to protect the alums," said Faryl
Reingold, office assistant at the Stanford Alumni
Association.
She said, however, that the San Francisco

Chronicle yearly publishes a list of the highest
paid executives in the Bay Area, including some
with salaries "upwards of $400,000 a year," she
said.
Reingold added that usually about a quarter of
the people on the list are Stanford graduates.
The last such list was printed on April 27,1978
based on salaries for 1977.

Why aren't there any lights anywhere near the
Phi Psi House? I was up there late one evening
and very nearly got lost trying to find my way
down the hill. Can't the University afford to
place spot lights near the house for the conveni
ence and safety of the residents? I understand
Roth House just got a new set of lights and that
house is located in a more populated and better
lit area than is Phi Psi.
-S.L.
According to Rob Ramirez, manager of resi
dences and fraternities, Roth House recently did
get lights put on the outside of the house.
Ramirez said he submitted a request on Nov.
13 to John Lerry in the Planning Office, asking
for street lighting on Cooksey Lane and San Juan
Street. Phi Psi is located on San Juan, so the post
lights, if installed, would be in front of the
house. He also has requested the repaying of
Cooksey Lane to prevent people from tripping
over potholes in the dark.
"There hasn't been any lighting there for 40
years," he said. But more reports of personal
assaults have made the problem more urgent,
he added.

and very nearly got lost trying to find my way
down the hill. Can't the University afford to
place spot lights near the house for the conveni
ence and safety of the residents? I understand
Roth House just got a new set of lights and that
house is located in a more populated and better
lit area than is Phi Psi.
-S.L.
According to Rob Ramirez, manager of resi
dences and fraternities, Roth House recently did
get lights put on the outside of the house.
Ramirez said he submitted a request on Nov.
13 to John Lerry in the Planning Office, asking
for street lighting on Cooksey Lane and San Juan
Street. Phi Psi is located on San Juan, so the post
lights, if installed, would be in front of the
house. He also has requested the repaying of
Cooksey Lane to prevent people from tripping
over potholes in the dark.
"There hasn't been any lighting there for 40
years," he said. But more reports of personal
assaults have made the problem more urgent,
he added.

I have been on the staff in the Medical School
for 10 years and during those 10 years I have
found the Stanford Daily stacked in a different
location around the Medical Center nearly every
morning.
Sometimes I can't find it at all. Other times
when I do find it, it looks like a wet dishrag.
Occasionally I am lucky and find it high and dry
on the counter at the Bank of America in the
Shopping Center.
My question is: Would it be possible to have
permanent stands or boxes located around the
medical center in various central locations
where the Daily could be stacked high and dry as
in the bank?
-L.F.
Stacy Azama, circulation manager for the
Daily, said it doesn't look like any such stands
will be placed there in the near future.
"My main concern is with the expense for the
Daily since we are a non-profit organization,"
she said, and the stands cost $70 each.
She also said there is a maintenance problem
with old papers piling up in the stands.
Regarding the issue of the regularity of deliv
ery locations, Azama said, "If my delivery
people are being that negligent, I'll check upon
them and make sure they're dropping it in the
same place every day."

"That's information we have to keep confi
dential in order to protect the alums," said Faryl
Reingold, office assistant at the Stanford Alumni
Association.
She said, however, that the San Francisco

Chronicle yearly publishes a list of the highest
paid executives in the Bay Area, including some
with salaries "upwards of $400,000 a year," she
said.
Reingold added that usually about a quarter of
the people on the list are Stanford graduates.
The last such list was printed on April 27,1978
based on salaries for 1977.
