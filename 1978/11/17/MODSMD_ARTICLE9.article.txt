# Transcendental Meditation reduces stress, says speaker
## 
### PAUL WEIUM 
Stress — a moderate amount heightens
human activity levels and increases motiva
tion, but in excess it can cause heart disease,
ulcers and other physical ills.
Last week, Doug Cassell, representative of
the International Meditation Society (IMS),
explained that Transcendental Meditation is a
viable means to eliminate stress because TM
offers a state of rest deeper than even sleep.
The speech was an introduction to a seven
step program Cassell said he hopes will result
in a heightened state of awareness through
TM.
The introductory process is quite simple,
according to Cassell. After the preparatory
lectures on campus, interested students visit
the Palo Alto IMS center for interviews, in
struction, validation and verification.
Validation is the rehearsal of newly learned
TM techniques and verification consists of
periodic check-ups on TM skills to ensure the
techniques are being practiced correctly,
Cassell said.
The preliminary meeting of the IMS was
held in conjunction with the Stanford TM

club. The University group has existed for at
least 10yearsundervarious names. Lastyearit
boasted a 200 person mailing list, according to
Mathematics Prof. Charles Devell, TM club
representative.
In his speech, Cassell pointed out the dif
ference between TM and other forms of "con
sciousness raising." Other techniques of'
meditation, including concentration and con
templation, entail the repetition of a particu
lar monosyllable, he explained.
However, according to Cassell, these
methods use only the surface of the mind.
Cassell said that while TM still uses the re
petition of a monosyllable or "mantra," the
method doesn't focus on it. Instead, he said,
TM refines the sounds of the mantra into its
finer and finer levels until the person reaches
the source of thought.
According to Cassell, TM produces an ex
panded consciousness through a state of
deep rest. TM does not produce a conscious
ness focused on the environment, but pro
duces what Cassell called the essence of con
sciousness itself.
