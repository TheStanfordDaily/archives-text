FRIENDS OF THE STANFORD GRIFFIN
Our group hopes that you have seen the Stanford Griffin symbol by now.
Consider it as a mascot.
Many of you have already expressed your thoughts in either written or spoken form. Thank you for your interest. We will be contacting student
organizations and living groups within the next couple of weeks to provide you with more information and to gauge your reaction to the
Stanford Griffin. The Student Senate has a resolution before it to determine how we can implement the adoption of a mascot.
Our support is growing. Friends of the Stanford Griffin include students, both graduate and undergraduate, both athletic and'not, faculty,
staff, and alumni.
We want your feedback and support. You may contact us at 321-6697, 132 Mirrielees.
Thank You!
