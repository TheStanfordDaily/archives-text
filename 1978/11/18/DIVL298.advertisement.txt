We've created the place, prepared the foods
and provided the good spirits to enable you and
your guests to enjoy the companionship of each
other. We believe dining and wining should be
fun, an adventure to share and savor at your
own pace with just enough "encouragement"
from the house to allow you to relax and be at
your best. That's Tomfoolery's, and, while we've
got it all together... it won't be the same with
out you!
