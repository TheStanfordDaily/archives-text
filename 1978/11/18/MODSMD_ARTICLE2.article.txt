# THE
						BIG GAME
## Bowl bid extra incentive to beat Cal Cards' season hinges on victory 
### IVAN MAISEL 
When the i ncentive of a bowl
game isn't the most important
consequenceof a win, then the
game, that is the Big Game,
must be pretty special.
The Stanford Cardinals travel
to Berkeley to meet the
California Golden Bears in the
81st edition of the hottest
rivalry this side of Lincoln,
Columbus or Tuscaloosa.
Each team is 6-4, but the re
cords couldn't be more diffe
rent. Cal is a struggling 6-4,
while the Cardinals are a
ranked 6-4, with the Sun, Lib
erty and Bluebonnet Bowls all
keeping an eye on them.
Nevertheless, throw all of
that out the window. This is the
Big Game.
"It doesn't matter what bowl
game it is, it isn't as important
as the Cal game," Stanford
Head Coach Bill Walsh said.
"This game means a great
deal to me. I'm not concerned
about our 6-4 record," said Cal
Head Coach Roger Theder.
If one looks at past Big
Games, it's easy to see that re
cords really do mean very little.
In 1947, an 0-8, 40-point un
derdog Stanford led the Rose
Bowl-bound Bears 18-14 when
Cal threw an 80-yard
touchdown pass to win it.
Last year Cal beat USC, who
had pummelled Stanford 49-0.
Final score: Stanford 21, Cal 3.
Both Stanford and California
are on the upswing going into
their final game of the season.
Stanford's sudden rash of in
juries seems to have subsided,
while a California victory last
weekend put the Bears on the

right track after a three-game
losing streak had derailed
them.
Cardinal Fullback Phil Fran
cis' sprained ankle received
the OK nod from the doctors
this week, and thus the Pac
10's leading receiver will be
back in action.
Darrin Nelson has recovered
from a strained knee, and de
fensive secondarymen John
Pigottand Rick Parker, both fel
led by sprained ankles, will see
action in today's game.
Francis' return to the starting
lineup is especially vital to the
Cardinal offense, which with
out him, has averaged only 14
points and 326 yards per game,
well under the season's mean.
"Phil adds versatility to the
offense," Walsh said. "He has
missed two games and still
leads the league in receiving.
He is also an excellent runner."
The balance and explosive
ness of the Stanford offense
has got Cal's Theder worried.
"Their offense is superior to
our defense," the first-year
mentor said. "(Stanford quar
terback Steve) Dils is more of a
problem. He runs around bet
ter than Guy Benjamin."
Theder might have added
the senior signal-caller can
chuck the ball, too.
Dils leads the country in pas
sing with 22.8 completions per
game. In directing the second
strongest passing attack in the
nation (265.0 yards per game),
Dils has set new Pac-10 records
for yards passing in one game,
total offense in one game (430
yards against Washington State
accounts for both records),

completions in one season
(228), and touchdown passes in
one season (21).
In addition, Dils needs just
117 yards against Cal to break
Jack Thompson's single
season markof2762,andwitha
completion percentage of .637,
is within striking distance of
the seasonal percentage mark
of .630, set by Stanford's Ben
jamin last season.
With the return of Francis,
halfback Darrin Nelson should
have another fine game. Nel
son has been limited to just

over 100 yards in the last two
games, and needs 116 to break
the 1000-yard barrier.
"Nelson's an amazing foot
ball player," Theder said. "He
does for Stanford what Chuck
Munciedidforusinl97s. He is
the key to many things they
do."
The most favorable aspect of
last year's Big Game from the
Stanford sideline was the de
fense. Cal was limited to just
three points. This year's de
fense is much improved over
last year's, and led by graduat
ing senior linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, is determined to
stonewall the potent Cal pas
sing attack.
"This year's Stanford de
fense is the finest well
rounded defense they've had
since I've been involved in Big
Games," said Theder, who is
participating in his eleventh
Big Game. "They don't make
mistakes."
The Cardinal defense has
given up only three
touchdowns in the last three
games. It will have to continue
the stalwart performances to
corral the Bear offense, led by
sophomore quarterback Rich
Campbell.
Campbell was heavily re
cruited by Stanford two years
ago, and losing him left the
coaches mumbling to them
selves. Today's game might in
crease the mumbling.
"Campbell is as good a quar
terback as you'll see in college
football," Walsh said. "At

6-foot-5, he's rangy, he's got a
good arm and can throw all dis
tances."
The San Jose native is second
in the Pac-10 Conference in
total offense with 201.7 yards
per game, and is the third lead
ing passer in the conference.
The Cal offensive unit
Campbell leads is one of the
most powerful in the nation.
The Bears are third in the coun
try in passing, averaging 255.7
yards per outing.
The running attack balances
the aerial game, with fullback
Paul Jones providing the mus
cle. Jones has rushed for 727
yards this season, bulling for
232 yards on 46 carries last
week against Washington
State.

"Jones is a very powerful, re
lentless runner with a lot of
endurance," Walsh said. "I
don't think he'll get 225 yards
against us though. I hope not,
anyway."

The balanced offensive at
tack is something Walsh
preaches from the offensive
side. When he is trying to de
fend it, though, he is equally
determined to stop it.
"We'll have to have pressure
from our linemen and linebac
kers. We've got to get to them
before they get started. We wil I
have to stop Jones before he
gets a head of steam and keep
Campbell from throwing as ac
curately by not letting him set
up."

The scoreboard tells the story of the 1977 Big Game. Stanford's heroic defensive effort last year limited Cal to
just one field goal and thrust the Cards into the national bowl scene. A win today could do the same; with
several bowl reps currently wooing the Cards.

Darrin Nelson sprints for yardage in last year's Big Game with three Cal defenders in hot pursuit. The 94 yards
Nelson gained last year against the Bears pushed him over the 1000-yard mark. He needs 116 yards today to
get another grand.
