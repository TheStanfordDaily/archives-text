# Have you eaten Tuna today?
## Fear and Loathing at the Fiesta Bowl 
### KEN JOHNSON 
Phoenix-Dec. 25 The
whole adventure had seemed
suspicious from the beginning.
After all, what was the Leland
Stanford, Junior, University
Marching Band doing at Sun
Devil Stadium, in
PhroenixonOzorona, at the
Fiesta Bowl, after their chilling
experiences with stadium offi
cials and oinkers that
November 11 (1111 for
numerology fans) afternoon.
That had been the first
football-related visit of Stan
ford University to Arizona State
University. Probably should
have been the last. Bringing
the Cardinals, the rain, and the
LSJUMB to these pagan lands
had proven, tragically, to be
too much.
That first visit had proven to
be fun, despite the rain. There
had been the Magic Bus, once
a Winnebago, but now trans
formed into a relic of 1968 Palo
Alto. This Hunter-and-Kesey
guided assault party scouted
out the ASU campus before the
full-scale invasion was
launched, at 2:00 AM on Satur
day morning. The abruptly
ended halftime show will never
be forgotten by today's vic
tims.

But the subtle violence of
that first visit to Sun Devil land
could hardly have
foreshadowed the tragic dis
play preceding the appearance
of the Stanford football team
and band in the Fiesta Bowl
here today. The machine
gunning of the LSJUMB as they
played "Jocko Homo," the
singing of the National Anthem
by Woody Haze atop a pile of
LSJUMB corpses, the roar of

the attendant Triple-K officials,

Whew! Great to be back in
the Bay Area, where necks are
tan, and not red! High, Ber
keley. Remember Mario Savio?
Or are you still living in the
'sos? (Time goes in several di
rections.)
A belated thanx to the Ber
keley fraternity clowns for ste
aling Official Rick Shaw, down
in Palo Alto last Big Game. We
had forgotten how neander
thallingly funny fraternities
could be. (One ToGo, please.)
Also it made us realize that
Berkeley students ain't what
they used to be. Butt hello to
the blue and grey mairds over
there in the Berkserkeley
Straw-Hat-and Poll-ka March
ing Band. You guys are a laugh
riot, really, that story about the
broken leg and USC . . . great
scripting!
Up, up, and away go the bal
loons. Such a fine tradition.
Break a leg, or a camera, or a
musician's teeth. Who cares,
it's good, clean fun.
Which brings us to today's
Stanford Band performance. A
Two-Part Study of WoMan's I n
fluence On the Environment.
First, consider the sound of
the Berkeley or USC bands.
Now consider noise pollution.
Yes, JPaulgettylll and LSJUMB
halftime shows and walls all
have ears. And what do they
hear? Pollution. Lehrerily I say
unto you the breakfast gar
bage they dawn rose on the Bay

they hear next morning in San
Jose.
All about us are unnatural
acting sounds. Rhythmic
chopping of axes has been re
placed by the white noise of
the Chain Saw. (Inthenek
thenek thenek thenek, deja
viewed.) OneHundread
Twenty Decibels is "Just
Enough and Too Much" to
break one's eardrums, but jac
quehammers, rocquecon
certs, and even high-flying
aeroeplanes will provide the
proper ear-breaking volume. If
ypu hear me talking, it's un
likely that you are "Living in the
USA," where minds have os
mondfied. Anyway, Stanford
lets you be the judge by next
offering the band from Ber
keley.

Till halftime arrives and so
does the LSJUMB again. Here
we turn to the world of en
dangered species. Realize that
in four formations we could
not include everything in that
category, i.e. virgin trees, bal
led eagles, Buffalo, and those
robbin's favorites, the whoop
ing cranes. Though you
yourself-l may have missed out
in saving such things as the
dodo bird, you CAN help with
the following subjects.
First the Band depicts a re
cruiting effort for the Seal
Club. A good slap on the face is
all that's needed to bring those
critters to their census. If the
seal could talk, indeed, if it
were still alive, it would bark
out "thanx, that's 'Just What I
Needed.' "
Man's raping and pillaging of
the environment knows no
bounds. Our pregame show
indicated the aural misgratifi

cation provided by citified
technology. In the next forma
tion, the daffy ducks of the
Band, swimming in the sea of
life, suddenly stick beaks in air,
to inquire "What's That
Smell?" Quickly, we discover
that oil's well that ends well.
(Ever seen a duck on a beach
coated with plutonium?)
A little further out to see is
our friend "Josie" the Sperm
Whale. Many ships and nations
are russian about the seas nip
pon at the lives of these
species, but perhaps American
condomation can save this life
form.
In the final act of Stanford's
halftime display, we depict the
demise of the American
economic animal. It's all a plot,
to show that if money can buy
happiness, then it's costing a

lot more to be happy. Soon the
dollar may join the ranks of the
bald eagle, the buffalo, Rob
bins' whooping cranes, and
virgin trees, and be sent to
wildlife preserves. There's
more hope for it there than in
American stockyards.
At the conclusion of this
show and LSJUMB season,
we/I'd like to note that the writ
ing of these follies next year
will be left to the Stanford Arti
ficial Intelligence Lab, which
YOU WILL vote for in 1984!
In this last gasp, we/I'd like to
thank the Stanford Daily,
KZSU, Herb Caen, Margo St.
James, COYOTE, Oui
Magazine, the Stanford Uni
versity particularly the Athletic
Dept., Dr. Barnes and the
LSJUMB of 1963!, ... and
America.

We found this picture in the mail, but we're really not sure what it is.
Somebody said that it might be musicians, but they must be kidding.
Anybody sophisticated enough to play music wouldn't get into a monkey
suit like that.

we turn to the world of en
dangered species. Realize that
in four formations we could
not include everything in that
category, i.e. virgin trees, bal
led eagles, Buffalo, and those
robbin's favorites, the whoop
ing cranes. Though you
yourself-l may have missed out
in saving such things as the
dodo bird, you CAN help with
the following subjects.
First the Band depicts a re
cruiting effort for the Seal
Club. A good slap on the face is
all that's needed to bring those
critters to their census. If the
seal could talk, indeed, if it
were still alive, it would bark
out "thanx, that's 'Just What I
Needed.' "
Man's raping and pillaging of
the environment knows no
bounds. Our pregame show
indicated the aural misgratifi

cation provided by citified
technology. In the next forma
tion, the daffy ducks of the
Band, swimming in the sea of
life, suddenly stick beaks in air,
to inquire "What's That
Smell?" Quickly, we discover
that oil's well that ends well.
(Ever seen a duck on a beach
coated with plutonium?)
A little further out to see is
our friend "Josie" the Sperm
Whale. Many ships and nations
are russian about the seas nip
pon at the lives of these
species, but perhaps American
condomation can save this life
form.
In the final act of Stanford's
halftime display, we depict the
demise of the American
economic animal. It's all a plot,
to show that if money can buy
happiness, then it's costing a

lot more to be happy. Soon the
dollar may join the ranks of the
bald eagle, the buffalo, Rob
bins' whooping cranes, and
virgin trees, and be sent to
wildlife preserves. There's
more hope for it there than in
American stockyards.
At the conclusion of this
show and LSJUMB season,
we/I'd like to note that the writ
ing of these follies next year
will be left to the Stanford Arti
ficial Intelligence Lab, which
YOU WILL vote for in 1984!
In this last gasp, we/I'd like to
thank the Stanford Daily,
KZSU, Herb Caen, Margo St.
James, COYOTE, Oui
Magazine, the Stanford Uni
versity particularly the Athletic
Dept., Dr. Barnes and the
LSJUMB of 1963!, ... and
America.

Phoenix-Dec. 25 The

After all, what was the Leland

Marching Band doing at Sun
Devil Stadium, in
PhroenixonOzorona, at the
Fiesta Bowl, after their chilling
experiences with stadium offi

November 11 (1111 for
numerology fans) afternoon.
That had been the first
football-related visit of Stan

University. Probably should
have been the last. Bringing
the Cardinals, the rain, and the
LSJUMB to these pagan lands
had proven, tragically, to be
too much.
That first visit had proven to
be fun, despite the rain. There
had been the Magic Bus, once
a Winnebago, but now trans
formed into a relic of 1968 Palo
Alto. This Hunter-and-Kesey
guided assault party scouted
out the ASU campus before the
full-scale invasion was
launched, at 2:00 AM on Satur
day morning. The abruptly
ended halftime show will never
be forgotten by today's vic

But the subtle violence of
that first visit to Sun Devil land
could hardly have
foreshadowed the tragic dis
play preceding the appearance
of the Stanford football team
and band in the Fiesta Bowl
here today. The machine

Whew! Great to be back in
the Bay Area, where necks are
tan, and not red! High, Ber
keley. Remember Mario Savio?
Or are you still living in the
'sos? (Time goes in several di
rections.)
A belated thanx to the Ber
keley fraternity clowns for ste
aling Official Rick Shaw, down
in Palo Alto last Big Game. We
had forgotten how neander
thallingly funny fraternities
could be. (One ToGo, please.)
Also it made us realize that
Berkeley students ain't what
they used to be. Butt hello to
the blue and grey mairds over
there in the Berkserkeley
Straw-Hat-and Poll-ka March
ing Band. You guys are a laugh
riot, really, that story about the
broken leg and USC . . . great
scripting!
Up, up, and away go the bal
loons. Such a fine tradition.
Break a leg, or a camera, or a
musician's teeth. Who cares,
it's good, clean fun.
Which brings us to today's
Stanford Band performance. A
Two-Part Study of WoMan's I n
fluence On the Environment.
First, consider the sound of
the Berkeley or USC bands.
Now consider noise pollution.
Yes, JPaulgettylll and LSJUMB
halftime shows and walls all
have ears. And what do they
hear? Pollution. Lehrerily I say
unto you the breakfast gar
bage they dawn rose on the Bay

they hear next morning in San
Jose.
All about us are unnatural
acting sounds. Rhythmic
chopping of axes has been re
placed by the white noise of
the Chain Saw. (Inthenek
thenek thenek thenek, deja
viewed.) OneHundread
Twenty Decibels is "Just
Enough and Too Much" to
break one's eardrums, but jac
quehammers, rocquecon
certs, and even high-flying
aeroeplanes will provide the
proper ear-breaking volume. If
ypu hear me talking, it's un
likely that you are "Living in the
USA," where minds have os
mondfied. Anyway, Stanford
lets you be the judge by next
offering the band from Ber
keley.

Till halftime arrives and so
does the LSJUMB again. Here
we turn to the world of en
dangered species. Realize that
in four formations we could
not include everything in that
category, i.e. virgin trees, bal
led eagles, Buffalo, and those
robbin's favorites, the whoop
ing cranes. Though you
yourself-l may have missed out
in saving such things as the
dodo bird, you CAN help with
the following subjects.
First the Band depicts a re
cruiting effort for the Seal
Club. A good slap on the face is
all that's needed to bring those
critters to their census. If the
seal could talk, indeed, if it
were still alive, it would bark
out "thanx, that's 'Just What I
Needed.' "
Man's raping and pillaging of
the environment knows no
bounds. Our pregame show
indicated the aural misgratifi

cation provided by citified
technology. In the next forma
tion, the daffy ducks of the
Band, swimming in the sea of
life, suddenly stick beaks in air,
to inquire "What's That
Smell?" Quickly, we discover
that oil's well that ends well.
(Ever seen a duck on a beach
coated with plutonium?)
A little further out to see is
our friend "Josie" the Sperm
Whale. Many ships and nations
are russian about the seas nip
pon at the lives of these
species, but perhaps American
condomation can save this life
form.
In the final act of Stanford's
halftime display, we depict the
demise of the American
economic animal. It's all a plot,
to show that if money can buy
happiness, then it's costing a

lot more to be happy. Soon the
dollar may join the ranks of the
bald eagle, the buffalo, Rob
bins' whooping cranes, and
virgin trees, and be sent to
wildlife preserves. There's
more hope for it there than in
American stockyards.
At the conclusion of this
show and LSJUMB season,
we/I'd like to note that the writ
ing of these follies next year
will be left to the Stanford Arti
ficial Intelligence Lab, which
YOU WILL vote for in 1984!
In this last gasp, we/I'd like to
thank the Stanford Daily,
KZSU, Herb Caen, Margo St.
James, COYOTE, Oui
Magazine, the Stanford Uni
versity particularly the Athletic
Dept., Dr. Barnes and the
LSJUMB of 1963!, ... and
America.

Somebody said that it might be musicians, but they must be kidding.
Anybody sophisticated enough to play music wouldn't get into a monkey

Phoenix-Dec. 25 The
whole adventure had seemed
suspicious from the beginning.
After all, what was the Leland
Stanford, Junior, University
Marching Band doing at Sun
Devil Stadium, in
PhroenixonOzorona, at the
Fiesta Bowl, after their chilling
experiences with stadium offi
cials and oinkers that
November 11 (1111 for
numerology fans) afternoon.
That had been the first
football-related visit of Stan
ford University to Arizona State
University. Probably should
have been the last. Bringing
the Cardinals, the rain, and the
LSJUMB to these pagan lands
had proven, tragically, to be
too much.
That first visit had proven to
be fun, despite the rain. There
had been the Magic Bus, once
a Winnebago, but now trans
formed into a relic of 1968 Palo
Alto. This Hunter-and-Kesey
guided assault party scouted
out the ASU campus before the
full-scale invasion was
launched, at 2:00 AM on Satur
day morning. The abruptly
ended halftime show will never
be forgotten by today's vic
tims.

But the subtle violence of
that first visit to Sun Devil land
could hardly have
foreshadowed the tragic dis
play preceding the appearance
of the Stanford football team
and band in the Fiesta Bowl
here today. The machine
gunning of the LSJUMB as they
played "Jocko Homo," the
