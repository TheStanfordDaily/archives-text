# Soph Campbell a rising star on Cal horizon
## 
### RICHARD MARTINEZ 
. The Stanford defensive front
line had better be prepared to
do some high jumping if they
hope to block any passes or
even obstruct the vision of
Cal's star quarterback. While
such star pro quarterbacks as
the Rams' Pat Haden and Min
nesota's Fran Tarkenton must
wear their cleats to near the
6-foot level, Bear passer Rich
Campbell stands a lofty
6-foot-5 in stocking feet.
Not only is Cal's play caller
blessed with height, but being
only a sophomore, he is young
and promises a bright future
for the Bears' offense. How
ever, enough of Campbell's
natural assets, it's his ac
complishments that are awe
some.
Impressed with the school
and the team's philosophy, the
highly recruited San Jose resi
dent chose Cal over many
other offers. His freshman
year, Campbell was fourth
string quarterback and obvi
ously didn't see much action.
When spring practice rolled
around, though, one name was
continually heard throughout
the coaching staff and it wasn't
just a delicious brand of soup
they were raving about. And so
Rich Campbell was given the
starting job at quarterback a
decision no team member or
Bear booster has ever regret
ted.

"It was tough at first and I
was a bit intimidated,"
Campbell recalled, "but once I
asserted myself and proved
what I could do, the offense
respected and followed me.
It's not easy in the beginning to
be telling some senior stars
what to do."

Campbell has more than
proved his worth as he is com

pleting the second most suc
cessful season for a Cal quar
terback, following Joe Roth's
magnificent season in 1974. He
has completed 152 of 260 pas
ses for 2164 yards, 13
touchdowns and a completion
percentage of 58.5. He has ac
crued 2017 yards in total of
fense, an average of 201 yards a
game, and second in the Pac-10
to Steve Dils.
"Although I've thrown 17 in
terceptions, consider six of
those came in that horrendous
game against UCLA. That was
one of the best educations I've
ever had as a quarterback,"
said the young star. "I'll never
throw into the strength of a de
fense's coverage again. That
whole day I was forcing the ball
into crowds."
Campbell, while learning
more each game, still sees his
own weaknesses. "I need to
improve my reading of secon
dary coverage, my quickness
and equally important, I have
to learn to encourage my
teammates more."
No one will deny, though,
that a bright future lies ahead
for Campbell. "With Steve Dils
you have perhaps the best
quarterback in the country,"
said Stanford Head Coach Bill
Walsh. "With Rich Campbell

you see a guy who will be the
best very soon."
People are often comparing
Dils and Campbell but the Cal
quarterback doesn't see why.
"I don't think you can compare
us because we have very diffe
rent styles. Anyway, I have a
Jong way to go before I can
compare myself with anybody
of Dils' caliber."
So this Saturday fans will not
only be seeing a rivalry bet
ween two hard luck teams of
1978, they'll be treated to
watching the nation's number
one quarterback face the up
and coming star of the future.
"This is going to make the sea
son worthwhile for the win
ner," said Campbell. "Our
practices were more spirited
this week and we'll be playing
our best this Saturday."
When asked about team and
personal goals, Campbell re
plied, "I want to see Cal go to
the Rose Bowl and I'd like to
win the Heisman Trophy."
The Cards' Darrin Nelson
may have something to say
about that, but fans will be
treated to seeing both in action
for quite some time. And this
Saturday, while the Bears will
try to pounce on Nelson, Car
dinal defenders will try to make
minestrone out of Campbell.

Sophomore Rich Campbell has stepped into some big shoes as a Cal
quarterback, and the San Jose native has had no problem filling those
shoes. Campbell has thrown for over 214 yards per game, and leads the
third best passing offense in the country inaction today against Stanford.

hope to block any passes or
even obstruct the vision of
Cal's star quarterback. While
such star pro quarterbacks as
the Rams' Pat Haden and Min
nesota's Fran Tarkenton must
wear their cleats to near the
6-foot level, Bear passer Rich
Campbell stands a lofty
6-foot-5 in stocking feet.
Not only is Cal's play caller
blessed with height, but being
only a sophomore, he is young
and promises a bright future
for the Bears' offense. How
ever, enough of Campbell's
natural assets, it's his ac
complishments that are awe
some.
Impressed with the school
and the team's philosophy, the
highly recruited San Jose resi
dent chose Cal over many
other offers. His freshman
year, Campbell was fourth
string quarterback and obvi
ously didn't see much action.
When spring practice rolled
around, though, one name was
continually heard throughout
the coaching staff and it wasn't
just a delicious brand of soup
they were raving about. And so
Rich Campbell was given the
starting job at quarterback a
decision no team member or
Bear booster has ever regret
ted.

"It was tough at first and I
was a bit intimidated,"
Campbell recalled, "but once I
asserted myself and proved
what I could do, the offense
respected and followed me.
It's not easy in the beginning to
be telling some senior stars
what to do."

Campbell has more than
proved his worth as he is com

pleting the second most suc
cessful season for a Cal quar
terback, following Joe Roth's
magnificent season in 1974. He
has completed 152 of 260 pas
ses for 2164 yards, 13
touchdowns and a completion
percentage of 58.5. He has ac
crued 2017 yards in total of
fense, an average of 201 yards a
game, and second in the Pac-10
to Steve Dils.
"Although I've thrown 17 in
terceptions, consider six of
those came in that horrendous
game against UCLA. That was
one of the best educations I've
ever had as a quarterback,"
said the young star. "I'll never
throw into the strength of a de
fense's coverage again. That
whole day I was forcing the ball
into crowds."
Campbell, while learning
more each game, still sees his
own weaknesses. "I need to
improve my reading of secon
dary coverage, my quickness
and equally important, I have
to learn to encourage my
teammates more."
No one will deny, though,
that a bright future lies ahead
for Campbell. "With Steve Dils
you have perhaps the best
quarterback in the country,"
said Stanford Head Coach Bill
Walsh. "With Rich Campbell

you see a guy who will be the
best very soon."
People are often comparing
Dils and Campbell but the Cal
quarterback doesn't see why.
"I don't think you can compare
us because we have very diffe
rent styles. Anyway, I have a
Jong way to go before I can
compare myself with anybody
of Dils' caliber."
So this Saturday fans will not
only be seeing a rivalry bet
ween two hard luck teams of
1978, they'll be treated to
watching the nation's number
one quarterback face the up
and coming star of the future.
"This is going to make the sea
son worthwhile for the win
ner," said Campbell. "Our
practices were more spirited
this week and we'll be playing
our best this Saturday."
When asked about team and
personal goals, Campbell re
plied, "I want to see Cal go to
the Rose Bowl and I'd like to
win the Heisman Trophy."
The Cards' Darrin Nelson
may have something to say
about that, but fans will be
treated to seeing both in action
for quite some time. And this
Saturday, while the Bears will
try to pounce on Nelson, Car
dinal defenders will try to make
minestrone out of Campbell.
