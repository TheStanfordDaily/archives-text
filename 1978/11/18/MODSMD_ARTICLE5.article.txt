# Ceresino ends stellar career on the Farm
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Of all the players on the field
for today's Big Game, none de
serves the appellation of "Big
Man" more than Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino.
Since the first moments of
his collegiate career, Ceresino
has distinguished himself as
one of the finest, most
dynamic performers in Stan
ford football history.
The Canoga Park native
broke the Cardinal record for
most tackles in a season last
year with 174, eclipsing Jim
Merlo's mark of 164 set in 1972.
Ceresino capped the 1977
campaign by being named the
Most Valuable Lineman in the
Sun Bowl, making 22 tackles,
18 unassisted.
This year Ceresino should
add to the myriad of All-Coast
and All-Conference honors he
began collecting in 1976, his
sophomore season.
Ceresino's eventful gridiron
tenure at the Farm ends today,
however. He has a lot to re
member, and because he
hopes to play professional
football, he has much to look
forward to.
One of Ceresino's promi

nent memories concerns his
very first college game, against
Penn State in 1975. "I got in late
in the game," he recalled, "and
I made six straight tackles; on
the first one I dropped a guy for
a six-yard loss and put him
out."
Yet Ceresino finds it difficult
to determine his greatest thrills
and honors, though serving as
captain last year and winning
the team's Defensive Player of
the Year award as a sophomore
over Ail-American Duncan
McColl stand out.
"I'd like to make Ail-
American, and I think I'm that
caliber of player," stated Cere
sino. "But with our record I
don't believe I'll get it. Overall,
though, I've been really lucky
I've done more than I
thought I'd do when I first
came here."
Standing 6-2 and weighing
219 pounds, Ceresino ranks as
one of the smaller linebackers.
He compensates for his lack of
size with intensity and out
standing football instincts. "He
has good, good football
sense," stressed Card
linebacker coach Norb
Hecker.

Ceresino usually begins de
veloping his proper game-day
attitude on Monday. "It's a
slow, gradual process," he
explained. "I have a grudge
against a lot of the teams in the
conference maybe some
body gave me a cheap shot or
spit on me before.

"By Thursday I'm a little
weird," he continued. "I'll go
off at the smallest thing. By Fri
day I'm back to normal, and on
Saturday morning I'm actually
in a happy mood. The competi
tion brings out the joy in me."
Ceresino regrets the rare oc
casions where.he isn't mentally
prepared. "I've gone into
some games not psyched up,
and it shows," he said. "Your
tackles are not as quick or
crisp. Hopefully that's when
somebody gives me a cheap
shot so I can get psyched
again."
Football parallels life, be
lieves Ceresino, in that it can
help one gain a sense of re
sponsibility: "You learn the
meaning of responsibility
through going to practice,
conditioning your body, and
getting yourself ready."
