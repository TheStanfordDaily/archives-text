# Ceresino ends stellar career on the Farm
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Of all the players on the field
for today's Big Game, none de
serves the appellation of "Big
Man" more than Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino.
Since the first moments of
his collegiate career, Ceresino
has distinguished himself as
one of the finest, most
dynamic performers in Stan
ford football history.
The Canoga Park native
broke the Cardinal record for
most tackles in a season last
year with 174, eclipsing Jim
Merlo's mark of 164 set in 1972.
Ceresino capped the 1977
campaign by being named the
Most Valuable Lineman in the
Sun Bowl, making 22 tackles,
18 unassisted.
This year Ceresino should
add to the myriad of All-Coast
and All-Conference honors he
began collecting in 1976, his
sophomore season.
Ceresino's eventful gridiron
tenure at the Farm ends today,
however. He has a lot to re
member, and because he
hopes to play professional
football, he has much to look
forward to.
One of Ceresino's promi

nent memories concerns his
very first college game, against
Penn State in 1975. "I got in late
in the game," he recalled, "and
I made six straight tackles; on
the first one I dropped a guy for
a six-yard loss and put him
out."
Yet Ceresino finds it difficult
to determine his greatest thrills
and honors, though serving as
captain last year and winning
the team's Defensive Player of
the Year award as a sophomore
over Ail-American Duncan
McColl stand out.
"I'd like to make Ail-
American, and I think I'm that
caliber of player," stated Cere
sino. "But with our record I
don't believe I'll get it. Overall,
though, I've been really lucky
I've done more than I
thought I'd do when I first
came here."
Standing 6-2 and weighing
219 pounds, Ceresino ranks as
one of the smaller linebackers.
He compensates for his lack of
size with intensity and out
standing football instincts. "He
has good, good football
sense," stressed Card
linebacker coach Norb
Hecker.

Ceresino usually begins de
veloping his proper game-day
attitude on Monday. "It's a
slow, gradual process," he
explained. "I have a grudge
against a lot of the teams in the
conference maybe some
body gave me a cheap shot or
spit on me before.

"By Thursday I'm a little
weird," he continued. "I'll go
off at the smallest thing. By Fri
day I'm back to normal, and on
Saturday morning I'm actually
in a happy mood. The competi
tion brings out the joy in me."
Ceresino regrets the rare oc
casions where.he isn't mentally
prepared. "I've gone into
some games not psyched up,
and it shows," he said. "Your
tackles are not as quick or
crisp. Hopefully that's when
somebody gives me a cheap
shot so I can get psyched
again."
Football parallels life, be
lieves Ceresino, in that it can
help one gain a sense of re
sponsibility: "You learn the
meaning of responsibility
through going to practice,
conditioning your body, and
getting yourself ready."

Gordy Ceresino, the best linebacker ever to wear the Cardinal colors,
closes out an amazing career today in the 81st Big Game. Ceresino is the
most prolific tackier in Stanford history, with 515 stops. He leads the
team this year with 134, despite missing the USC game due to injury.
Ceresinowill always treasure
certain people he has met
through football. Two such
people are coaches Jack Ch rist
iansen and Hecker.
"Coach Chris was a big con
tributor to my success here,"
said Ceresino. "He helped me
get into school, and became a
close friend. Coach Hecker is
not just a good coach, but like
Coach Chris, also a good friend
we can sit down and talk
about things."
Recognizing how football's
rigorousness brings a team
closer together, Ceresino said
he could go "on and on" extol
ling his past and present
teammates.
"I'll miss my friends," Cere
sino summed. "I get a special
feeling about the guys I play
with, whether they're
freshmen or seniors. You actu
ally go through war with these
guys on weekends. You see
guys 'selling out' for each
other, you go through the tears

and smiles together."
Ceresino also has only good
things to say about being a
student-athlete at Stanford. "I
didn't want to go to a 'football
factory/" he said. "I wouldn't
trade Stanford for anythng.
The style of the program here is
made for me. The school
speaks for itself. There's no
place else in the country that
can compare with Stanford in
the caliber of academics and
football together. We're the
number one school around."
Unfortunately, the number
one linebacker around is
graduating. The Cards are
sorry to see Ceresino leave.
"I wish we had more like
Gordy," Hecker said. "He's a
rare thing at Stanford a good
student (an economics major,
Ceresino carries a B-plus aver
age) who is real physical."
Sophomore linebacker Milt
McColl, like many other Cards,
looks up to Ceresino for lead
ership as well as the big play.
"He's a great motivator/' af

firmed McColl. "He senses
when the team is getting down,
and he keeps us up not only on
the field but on the sidelines
too."
"He makes a big difference
when he's not there," McColl
went on. "We saw in the USC
game what his backup, Craig
Zellmer, could do, and while I
don't want to take anything
away from Craig, it's not the
same out there without Gordy.
Your're confident that when
teams run up the middle he'll
stop them."
The 1978 season, with its four
close losses, has been an ex
cruciating one for Stanford,
and Ceresino feels particularly
frustrated.
"The disappointments have
been amazing," he mused, cit
ing the UCLA game as the first
major wound. "I hadn't played
an exceptional game ip three
years against them, but that
night at the Coliseum I was so
fired up. Coach (Bill) Walsh
said it was my best game, and I
felt it was one of my best, but it
was so awful to look up at the
scoreboard in the end. Every
body played great, and we put
too much into that game to
lose it."
Missing the USC game due
to injury also depressed Cere
sino, because it represented
his last chance to beat the Tro
jans and was the Card seniors'
final home game.
. "Phil Francis and myself
were teary-eyed," recalls
Ceresino. "The defense played
such an amazing game, and it
was tough to watch your closest
friends kill themselves and
lose."
"I'll dwell on this season
forever. When you see an old
guy in a bar moaning about
how his Rose Bowl ring is on
some USC guy's finger, you'll
I know it's me."
" Beating California today,
however, would relieve most
of the pain for Ceresino. "It's

the best way to go out," he
said. "The Big Game has an
aura of its own: one team can
be 0-9 and the other 9-0 and
damned if it isn't a one-point
game!"
Win or lose, Ceresino knows
that the Big Game aftermath
will be a sober one. "I'll regret
it when it's all over, when that
final gun goes off and I realize
that I'll wake up Monday with
out any films or meetings to go
to."
Ceresino hopes he will be
watching films and attending
team meetings next year as a
member of a National Football
League team. Playing pro ball,
he states, has remained a
longtime dream.
According to Hecker, na
tional scouting systems rate
Ceresino as the sixth best
linebacker in the country. He'll
have opportunities to raise that
rating and several scouts'
eyebrows by playing in the
Senior Bowl.
"With the right team, Gordy

could make it," Hecker said.
"He'd be more effective with a
'4o'-type defense (featuring a
four-man front line) rather
than a '3o' (three-man front)
defense."
Having played in both
alignments while at Stanford,
Ceresino feels he has an advan
tage over other colle
linebackers. He has cor
dence in his ability, and he
feels his only drawback might
be his aforementioned size de
ficiency.
"I'll have to put on a little
more weight and strength and
maintain good speed," he said.
"But I've been told I was too
small all my life, and I've
proved myself in this damn
conference."
Nobody can argue that Cere
sino's spirit is lacking. "My
heart is big enough," he as
serted. After witnessing his
heroics over the past four sea
sons, Stanford football obser
vers know Gordy Ceresino
means the truth.

"He'd be more effective with a
'4o'-type defense (featuring a
four-man front line) rather
than a '3o' (three-man front)
defense."
Having played in both
alignments while at Stanford,
Ceresino feels he has an advan
tage over other colle
linebackers. He has cor
dence in his ability, and he
feels his only drawback might
be his aforementioned size de
ficiency.
"I'll have to put on a little
more weight and strength and
maintain good speed," he said.
"But I've been told I was too
small all my life, and I've
proved myself in this damn
conference."
Nobody can argue that Cere
sino's spirit is lacking. "My
heart is big enough," he as
serted. After witnessing his
heroics over the past four sea
sons, Stanford football obser
vers know Gordy Ceresino
means the truth.
Ceresinowill always treasure
certain people he has met
through football. Two such
people are coaches Jack Ch rist
iansen and Hecker.
"Coach Chris was a big con
tributor to my success here,"
said Ceresino. "He helped me
get into school, and became a
close friend. Coach Hecker is
not just a good coach, but like
Coach Chris, also a good friend
we can sit down and talk
about things."
Recognizing how football's
rigorousness brings a team
closer together, Ceresino said
he could go "on and on" extol
ling his past and present
teammates.
"I'll miss my friends," Cere
sino summed. "I get a special
feeling about the guys I play
with, whether they're
freshmen or seniors. You actu
ally go through war with these
guys on weekends. You see
guys 'selling out' for each
other, you go through the tears

and smiles together."
Ceresino also has only good
things to say about being a
student-athlete at Stanford. "I
didn't want to go to a 'football
factory/" he said. "I wouldn't
trade Stanford for anythng.
The style of the program here is
made for me. The school
speaks for itself. There's no
place else in the country that
can compare with Stanford in
the caliber of academics and
football together. We're the
number one school around."
Unfortunately, the number
one linebacker around is
graduating. The Cards are
sorry to see Ceresino leave.
"I wish we had more like
Gordy," Hecker said. "He's a
rare thing at Stanford a good
student (an economics major,
Ceresino carries a B-plus aver
age) who is real physical."
Sophomore linebacker Milt
McColl, like many other Cards,
looks up to Ceresino for lead
ership as well as the big play.
"He's a great motivator/' af

firmed McColl. "He senses
when the team is getting down,
and he keeps us up not only on
the field but on the sidelines
too."
"He makes a big difference
when he's not there," McColl
went on. "We saw in the USC
game what his backup, Craig
Zellmer, could do, and while I
don't want to take anything
away from Craig, it's not the
same out there without Gordy.
Your're confident that when
teams run up the middle he'll
stop them."
The 1978 season, with its four
close losses, has been an ex
cruciating one for Stanford,
and Ceresino feels particularly
frustrated.
"The disappointments have
been amazing," he mused, cit
ing the UCLA game as the first
major wound. "I hadn't played
an exceptional game ip three
years against them, but that
night at the Coliseum I was so
fired up. Coach (Bill) Walsh
said it was my best game, and I
felt it was one of my best, but it
was so awful to look up at the
scoreboard in the end. Every
body played great, and we put
too much into that game to
lose it."
Missing the USC game due
to injury also depressed Cere
sino, because it represented
his last chance to beat the Tro
jans and was the Card seniors'
final home game.
. "Phil Francis and myself
were teary-eyed," recalls
Ceresino. "The defense played
such an amazing game, and it
was tough to watch your closest
friends kill themselves and
lose."
"I'll dwell on this season
forever. When you see an old
guy in a bar moaning about
how his Rose Bowl ring is on
some USC guy's finger, you'll
I know it's me."
" Beating California today,
however, would relieve most
of the pain for Ceresino. "It's

the best way to go out," he
said. "The Big Game has an
aura of its own: one team can
be 0-9 and the other 9-0 and
damned if it isn't a one-point
game!"
Win or lose, Ceresino knows
that the Big Game aftermath
will be a sober one. "I'll regret
it when it's all over, when that
final gun goes off and I realize
that I'll wake up Monday with
out any films or meetings to go
to."
Ceresino hopes he will be
watching films and attending
team meetings next year as a
member of a National Football
League team. Playing pro ball,
he states, has remained a
longtime dream.
According to Hecker, na
tional scouting systems rate
Ceresino as the sixth best
linebacker in the country. He'll
have opportunities to raise that
rating and several scouts'
eyebrows by playing in the
Senior Bowl.
"With the right team, Gordy

could make it," Hecker said.
"He'd be more effective with a
'4o'-type defense (featuring a
four-man front line) rather
than a '3o' (three-man front)
defense."

Nobody can argue that Cere
sino's spirit is lacking. "My
heart is big enough," he as
serted. After witnessing his
heroics over the past four sea
sons, Stanford football obser
vers know Gordy Ceresino
means the truth.
Of all the players on the field
for today's Big Game, none de
serves the appellation of "Big
Man" more than Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino.
Since the first moments of
his collegiate career, Ceresino
has distinguished himself as
one of the finest, most
dynamic performers in Stan
ford football history.
The Canoga Park native
broke the Cardinal record for
most tackles in a season last
year with 174, eclipsing Jim
Merlo's mark of 164 set in 1972.
Ceresino capped the 1977
campaign by being named the
Most Valuable Lineman in the
Sun Bowl, making 22 tackles,
18 unassisted.
This year Ceresino should
add to the myriad of All-Coast
and All-Conference honors he
began collecting in 1976, his
sophomore season.
Ceresino's eventful gridiron
tenure at the Farm ends today,
however. He has a lot to re
member, and because he
hopes to play professional
football, he has much to look
forward to.
One of Ceresino's promi

nent memories concerns his
very first college game, against
Penn State in 1975. "I got in late
in the game," he recalled, "and
I made six straight tackles; on
the first one I dropped a guy for
a six-yard loss and put him
out."
Yet Ceresino finds it difficult
to determine his greatest thrills
and honors, though serving as
captain last year and winning
the team's Defensive Player of
the Year award as a sophomore
over Ail-American Duncan
McColl stand out.
"I'd like to make Ail-
American, and I think I'm that
caliber of player," stated Cere
sino. "But with our record I
don't believe I'll get it. Overall,
though, I've been really lucky
I've done more than I
thought I'd do when I first
came here."
Standing 6-2 and weighing
219 pounds, Ceresino ranks as
one of the smaller linebackers.
He compensates for his lack of
size with intensity and out
standing football instincts. "He
has good, good football
sense," stressed Card
linebacker coach Norb
Hecker.

Ceresino usually begins de
veloping his proper game-day
attitude on Monday. "It's a
slow, gradual process," he
explained. "I have a grudge
against a lot of the teams in the
conference maybe some
body gave me a cheap shot or
spit on me before.

"By Thursday I'm a little
weird," he continued. "I'll go
off at the smallest thing. By Fri
day I'm back to normal, and on
Saturday morning I'm actually
in a happy mood. The competi
tion brings out the joy in me."
Ceresino regrets the rare oc
casions where.he isn't mentally
prepared. "I've gone into
some games not psyched up,
and it shows," he said. "Your
tackles are not as quick or
crisp. Hopefully that's when
somebody gives me a cheap
shot so I can get psyched
again."
Football parallels life, be
lieves Ceresino, in that it can
help one gain a sense of re
sponsibility: "You learn the
meaning of responsibility
through going to practice,
conditioning your body, and
getting yourself ready."

"He's a great motivator/' af

firmed McColl. "He senses
when the team is getting down,
and he keeps us up not only on
the field but on the sidelines
too."
"He makes a big difference
when he's not there," McColl
went on. "We saw in the USC
game what his backup, Craig
Zellmer, could do, and while I
don't want to take anything
away from Craig, it's not the
same out there without Gordy.
Your're confident that when
teams run up the middle he'll
stop them."
The 1978 season, with its four
close losses, has been an ex
cruciating one for Stanford,
and Ceresino feels particularly
frustrated.
"The disappointments have
been amazing," he mused, cit
ing the UCLA game as the first
major wound. "I hadn't played
an exceptional game ip three
years against them, but that
night at the Coliseum I was so
fired up. Coach (Bill) Walsh
said it was my best game, and I
felt it was one of my best, but it
was so awful to look up at the
scoreboard in the end. Every
body played great, and we put
too much into that game to
lose it."
Missing the USC game due
to injury also depressed Cere
sino, because it represented
his last chance to beat the Tro
jans and was the Card seniors'
final home game.
. "Phil Francis and myself
were teary-eyed," recalls
Ceresino. "The defense played
such an amazing game, and it
was tough to watch your closest
friends kill themselves and
lose."
"I'll dwell on this season
forever. When you see an old
guy in a bar moaning about
how his Rose Bowl ring is on
some USC guy's finger, you'll
I know it's me."
" Beating California today,
however, would relieve most
of the pain for Ceresino. "It's

the best way to go out," he
said. "The Big Game has an
aura of its own: one team can
be 0-9 and the other 9-0 and
damned if it isn't a one-point
game!"
Win or lose, Ceresino knows
that the Big Game aftermath
will be a sober one. "I'll regret
it when it's all over, when that
final gun goes off and I realize
that I'll wake up Monday with
out any films or meetings to go
to."
Ceresino hopes he will be
watching films and attending
team meetings next year as a
member of a National Football
League team. Playing pro ball,
he states, has remained a
longtime dream.
According to Hecker, na
tional scouting systems rate
Ceresino as the sixth best
linebacker in the country. He'll
have opportunities to raise that
rating and several scouts'
eyebrows by playing in the
Senior Bowl.
"With the right team, Gordy

could make it," Hecker said.
"He'd be more effective with a
'4o'-type defense (featuring a
four-man front line) rather
than a '3o' (three-man front)
defense."
Having played in both
alignments while at Stanford,
Ceresino feels he has an advan
tage over other colle
linebackers. He has cor
dence in his ability, and he
feels his only drawback might
be his aforementioned size de
ficiency.
"I'll have to put on a little
more weight and strength and
maintain good speed," he said.
"But I've been told I was too
small all my life, and I've
proved myself in this damn
conference."
Nobody can argue that Cere
sino's spirit is lacking. "My
heart is big enough," he as
serted. After witnessing his
heroics over the past four sea
sons, Stanford football obser
vers know Gordy Ceresino
means the truth.
Of all the players on the field
for today's Big Game, none de
serves the appellation of "Big
Man" more than Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino.
Since the first moments of
his collegiate career, Ceresino
has distinguished himself as
one of the finest, most
dynamic performers in Stan
ford football history.
The Canoga Park native
broke the Cardinal record for
most tackles in a season last
year with 174, eclipsing Jim
Merlo's mark of 164 set in 1972.
Ceresino capped the 1977
campaign by being named the
Most Valuable Lineman in the
Sun Bowl, making 22 tackles,
18 unassisted.
This year Ceresino should
add to the myriad of All-Coast
and All-Conference honors he
began collecting in 1976, his
sophomore season.
Ceresino's eventful gridiron
tenure at the Farm ends today,
however. He has a lot to re
member, and because he
hopes to play professional
football, he has much to look
forward to.
One of Ceresino's promi

nent memories concerns his
very first college game, against
Penn State in 1975. "I got in late
in the game," he recalled, "and
I made six straight tackles; on
the first one I dropped a guy for
a six-yard loss and put him
out."
Yet Ceresino finds it difficult
to determine his greatest thrills
and honors, though serving as
captain last year and winning
the team's Defensive Player of
the Year award as a sophomore
over Ail-American Duncan
McColl stand out.
"I'd like to make Ail-
American, and I think I'm that
caliber of player," stated Cere
sino. "But with our record I
don't believe I'll get it. Overall,
though, I've been really lucky
I've done more than I
thought I'd do when I first
came here."
Standing 6-2 and weighing
219 pounds, Ceresino ranks as
one of the smaller linebackers.
He compensates for his lack of
size with intensity and out
standing football instincts. "He
has good, good football
sense," stressed Card
linebacker coach Norb
Hecker.

Ceresino usually begins de
veloping his proper game-day
attitude on Monday. "It's a
slow, gradual process," he
explained. "I have a grudge
against a lot of the teams in the
conference maybe some
body gave me a cheap shot or
spit on me before.

"By Thursday I'm a little
weird," he continued. "I'll go
off at the smallest thing. By Fri
day I'm back to normal, and on
Saturday morning I'm actually
in a happy mood. The competi
tion brings out the joy in me."
Ceresino regrets the rare oc
casions where.he isn't mentally
prepared. "I've gone into
some games not psyched up,
and it shows," he said. "Your
tackles are not as quick or
crisp. Hopefully that's when
somebody gives me a cheap
shot so I can get psyched
again."
Football parallels life, be
lieves Ceresino, in that it can
help one gain a sense of re
sponsibility: "You learn the
meaning of responsibility
through going to practice,
conditioning your body, and
getting yourself ready."

Gordy Ceresino, the best linebacker ever to wear the Cardinal colors,
closes out an amazing career today in the 81st Big Game. Ceresino is the
most prolific tackier in Stanford history, with 515 stops. He leads the
team this year with 134, despite missing the USC game due to injury.
Ceresinowill always treasure
certain people he has met
through football. Two such
people are coaches Jack Ch rist
iansen and Hecker.
"Coach Chris was a big con
tributor to my success here,"
said Ceresino. "He helped me
get into school, and became a
close friend. Coach Hecker is
not just a good coach, but like
Coach Chris, also a good friend
we can sit down and talk
about things."
Recognizing how football's
rigorousness brings a team
closer together, Ceresino said
he could go "on and on" extol
ling his past and present
teammates.
"I'll miss my friends," Cere
sino summed. "I get a special
feeling about the guys I play
with, whether they're
freshmen or seniors. You actu
ally go through war with these
guys on weekends. You see
guys 'selling out' for each
other, you go through the tears

and smiles together."
Ceresino also has only good
things to say about being a
student-athlete at Stanford. "I
didn't want to go to a 'football
factory/" he said. "I wouldn't
trade Stanford for anythng.
The style of the program here is
made for me. The school
speaks for itself. There's no
place else in the country that
can compare with Stanford in
the caliber of academics and
football together. We're the
number one school around."
Unfortunately, the number
one linebacker around is
graduating. The Cards are
sorry to see Ceresino leave.
"I wish we had more like
Gordy," Hecker said. "He's a
rare thing at Stanford a good
student (an economics major,
Ceresino carries a B-plus aver
age) who is real physical."
Sophomore linebacker Milt
McColl, like many other Cards,
looks up to Ceresino for lead
ership as well as the big play.
"He's a great motivator/' af

firmed McColl. "He senses
when the team is getting down,
and he keeps us up not only on

rating and several scouts'
eyebrows by playing in the
Senior Bowl.
"With the right team, Gordy

could make it," Hecker said.
"He'd be more effective with a
'4o'-type defense (featuring a
four-man front line) rather
than a '3o' (three-man front)
defense."
Having played in both
alignments while at Stanford,
Ceresino feels he has an advan
tage over other colle
linebackers. He has cor
dence in his ability, and he
feels his only drawback might
be his aforementioned size de
ficiency.
"I'll have to put on a little
more weight and strength and
maintain good speed," he said.
"But I've been told I was too
small all my life, and I've
proved myself in this damn
conference."
Nobody can argue that Cere
sino's spirit is lacking. "My
heart is big enough," he as
serted. After witnessing his
heroics over the past four sea
sons, Stanford football obser
vers know Gordy Ceresino
means the truth.
Of all the players on the field
for today's Big Game, none de
serves the appellation of "Big
Man" more than Stanford
linebacker Gordy Ceresino.
Since the first moments of
his collegiate career, Ceresino
has distinguished himself as
one of the finest, most
dynamic performers in Stan
ford football history.
The Canoga Park native
broke the Cardinal record for
most tackles in a season last
year with 174, eclipsing Jim
Merlo's mark of 164 set in 1972.
Ceresino capped the 1977
campaign by being named the
Most Valuable Lineman in the
Sun Bowl, making 22 tackles,
18 unassisted.
This year Ceresino should
add to the myriad of All-Coast
and All-Conference honors he
began collecting in 1976, his
sophomore season.
Ceresino's eventful gridiron
tenure at the Farm ends today,
however. He has a lot to re
member, and because he
hopes to play professional
football, he has much to look
forward to.
One of Ceresino's promi

nent memories concerns his
very first college game, against
Penn State in 1975. "I got in late
in the game," he recalled, "and
I made six straight tackles; on
the first one I dropped a guy for
a six-yard loss and put him
out."
Yet Ceresino finds it difficult
to determine his greatest thrills
and honors, though serving as
captain last year and winning
the team's Defensive Player of
the Year award as a sophomore
over Ail-American Duncan
McColl stand out.
"I'd like to make Ail-
American, and I think I'm that
caliber of player," stated Cere
sino. "But with our record I
don't believe I'll get it. Overall,
though, I've been really lucky
I've done more than I
thought I'd do when I first
came here."
Standing 6-2 and weighing
219 pounds, Ceresino ranks as
one of the smaller linebackers.
He compensates for his lack of
size with intensity and out
standing football instincts. "He
has good, good football
sense," stressed Card
linebacker coach Norb
Hecker.

Ceresino usually begins de
veloping his proper game-day
attitude on Monday. "It's a
slow, gradual process," he
explained. "I have a grudge
against a lot of the teams in the
conference maybe some
body gave me a cheap shot or
spit on me before.

"By Thursday I'm a little
weird," he continued. "I'll go
off at the smallest thing. By Fri
day I'm back to normal, and on
Saturday morning I'm actually
in a happy mood. The competi
tion brings out the joy in me."
Ceresino regrets the rare oc
casions where.he isn't mentally
prepared. "I've gone into
some games not psyched up,
and it shows," he said. "Your
tackles are not as quick or
crisp. Hopefully that's when
somebody gives me a cheap
shot so I can get psyched
again."
Football parallels life, be
lieves Ceresino, in that it can
help one gain a sense of re
sponsibility: "You learn the
meaning of responsibility
through going to practice,
conditioning your body, and
getting yourself ready."

Gordy Ceresino, the best linebacker ever to wear the Cardinal colors,
closes out an amazing career today in the 81st Big Game. Ceresino is the
most prolific tackier in Stanford history, with 515 stops. He leads the
team this year with 134, despite missing the USC game due to injury.
Ceresinowill always treasure
certain people he has met
through football. Two such
people are coaches Jack Ch rist
iansen and Hecker.
"Coach Chris was a big con
tributor to my success here,"
said Ceresino. "He helped me
get into school, and became a
close friend. Coach Hecker is
not just a good coach, but like
Coach Chris, also a good friend
we can sit down and talk
about things."
Recognizing how football's
rigorousness brings a team
closer together, Ceresino said
he could go "on and on" extol
ling his past and present
teammates.
"I'll miss my friends," Cere
sino summed. "I get a special
feeling about the guys I play
with, whether they're
freshmen or seniors. You actu
ally go through war with these
guys on weekends. You see
guys 'selling out' for each
other, you go through the tears

and smiles together."
Ceresino also has only good
things to say about being a
student-athlete at Stanford. "I
didn't want to go to a 'football
factory/" he said. "I wouldn't
trade Stanford for anythng.
The style of the program here is
made for me. The school
speaks for itself. There's no
place else in the country that
can compare with Stanford in
the caliber of academics and
football together. We're the
number one school around."
Unfortunately, the number
one linebacker around is
graduating. The Cards are
sorry to see Ceresino leave.
"I wish we had more like
Gordy," Hecker said. "He's a
rare thing at Stanford a good
student (an economics major,
Ceresino carries a B-plus aver
age) who is real physical."
Sophomore linebacker Milt
McColl, like many other Cards,
looks up to Ceresino for lead
ership as well as the big play.
"He's a great motivator/' af

firmed McColl. "He senses
when the team is getting down,
and he keeps us up not only on
the field but on the sidelines
too."
"He makes a big difference
when he's not there," McColl
went on. "We saw in the USC
game what his backup, Craig
Zellmer, could do, and while I
don't want to take anything
away from Craig, it's not the
same out there without Gordy.
Your're confident that when
teams run up the middle he'll
stop them."
The 1978 season, with its four
close losses, has been an ex
cruciating one for Stanford,
and Ceresino feels particularly
frustrated.
"The disappointments have
been amazing," he mused, cit
ing the UCLA game as the first
major wound. "I hadn't played
an exceptional game ip three
years against them, but that
night at the Coliseum I was so
fired up. Coach (Bill) Walsh
said it was my best game, and I
felt it was one of my best, but it
was so awful to look up at the
scoreboard in the end. Every
body played great, and we put
too much into that game to
lose it."
Missing the USC game due
to injury also depressed Cere
sino, because it represented
his last chance to beat the Tro
jans and was the Card seniors'
final home game.
. "Phil Francis and myself
were teary-eyed," recalls
Ceresino. "The defense played
such an amazing game, and it
was tough to watch your closest
friends kill themselves and
lose."
"I'll dwell on this season
forever. When you see an old
guy in a bar moaning about
how his Rose Bowl ring is on
some USC guy's finger, you'll
I know it's me."
" Beating California today,
however, would relieve most
of the pain for Ceresino. "It's

the best way to go out," he
said. "The Big Game has an
aura of its own: one team can
be 0-9 and the other 9-0 and
damned if it isn't a one-point
game!"
Win or lose, Ceresino knows
that the Big Game aftermath
will be a sober one. "I'll regret
it when it's all over, when that
final gun goes off and I realize
that I'll wake up Monday with
out any films or meetings to go
to."
Ceresino hopes he will be
watching films and attending
team meetings next year as a
member of a National Football
League team. Playing pro ball,
he states, has remained a
longtime dream.
According to Hecker, na
tional scouting systems rate
Ceresino as the sixth best
linebacker in the country. He'll
have opportunities to raise that
rating and several scouts'
eyebrows by playing in the
Senior Bowl.
"With the right team, Gordy
