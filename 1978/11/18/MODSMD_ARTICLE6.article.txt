Most fans never seem to
notice offensive linemen until
they do something wrong. This
goes double for centers. At
least guards and tackles get out
wide and lead the way on those
breakaway sweeps. But, to
most fans, the center seems to
just sit there in the middle of
the field and do nothing worth
talking about.
But what do fans km v?
To put it plainly, n- luch.
Center is the pivot -sition
in the offensive line. las to
make the calls, set the line, and
snap the ball perfectly (not to
mention the fact that he must
also block) any and every time
an offensive play takes place.
Any football team that wants to
win has to have a center it can
depend on. Stanford has one,
and his name is John Macaulay.
"We believe he's going to be
one of the best on the coast, if
not in the nation, at his posi
tion," said Head Coach Bill
Walsh speaking of his young
center. "He's got all the tools.
He's big. He's agile. He thinks
on his feet."
Offensive line coach Tom
Lovat also praised Macaulay.
"He's the most improved
young lineman we've got. He's
got the quickness and the
strength to be one of the fine
linemen in the league."
This is high praise for a
center who, last year at this
time, not only wasn't playing
center but wasn't even playing

varsity football.
Macaulay played guard on
the junior varisty squad last
fall. In the spring, searchingfor
a position where he could play,
Macaulay tried his hand at de
fensive end. Still looking for a
spot, he was switched to
center. And though it was hard
adjusting, especially learning
to snap, Macaulay found a
home at center.
"It's the pivotal position in
the line, and for him to make
that change so well is a real
credit to the man," Walsh said.
"He's met our highest expecta
tions."
"He's looked as good on film
as any Stanford center in the
past few years," Lovat said.
Macaulay is a big, rangy
athlete out of Bonita, Califor
nia, just south of San Diego. In
high school, Macaulay earned
All-CIF honors in baseball as
well as All-League in football.
On his high school football
team, he played linebackerand
tight end. and as you might ex
pect of someone living as far
down south as this 19-year old
does, Macaulay enjoys the
outdoor life. He's "into" the
ocean, it would seem, as he en
joys surfing, scuba diving, and
water-skiing.
A biology major, Macaulay
hopes to become a doctor. As
an irony of this last biographi
cal fact, Macaulay got his
chance through an inury to
former starting center, Fred
Burch.
When Burch found himself
unable to play during the war
mups of the Washington game,
Macaulay was called into ac
tion. And this starting assign
ment came as a surprise not
only to Macaulay but to Quar
terback Steve Dils as well.
Asked what his reaction to

the switch had been, Dils re
sponded, "I didn't have time to
worry about it. I heard about it
in warmups. When I got in the
game every snap was perfect."
Dils went on to explain that
since every snap was "right
there," he forgot all about
what could've been a traumatic
change.
"If you're worrying about
getting the snap, it screws you
up," Dils said, explaining how
necessary it is for a quarterback
to have complete confidence
in his center. Referring to the
snap Dils said, "It has to be
come automatic, like it has
now with John. He's done a
super job for us at center."
How did Macaulay feel about
the surprise start?
"I felt really confident," said
the big sophomore. "I felt I
could really get the job done. I
thought this was my chance to
make it or break it." It was and

hedid; that is, itwas his chance
and he did make the most of it.
Macaulay had played little
before this, and, though Lovat
said they had planned to bring
him along slowly, the young
center's performance in that
first game was instrumental in
securing a starting role.
"John had a fine game the
first game he played," Lovat
said. "After that first game, he
took the job over."
Lovat also pointed out that
even before the injury to
Burch, Macaulay had begun
"challenging him" for playing
time. Apparently, it was
Macaulay's inexperience that
was keeping him back.
Macaulay was grateful for
the move that switched him to
center.
"I thought the position
suited me a lot better," said
Macaulay of the change that

gave him his chance. "I
thought I had a lot better
chance to play."
And play he has, but most
fans still don't seem to notice.
How can he, as an offensive
lineman, get satisfaction out of
this game when people don't
seem to notice? What goals can
he set?
"From game to game, we
(the offensive line) want to give
Steve the best protection pos
sible. We want to get Darrin
(Nelson) and Phil (Francis) the
most yardage possible,"
Macaulay said. "When all
those things click, we know
we're doing the job."
It is perhaps a thankless job
at times, but it is a job that is
absolutely essential in winning
football games, a job of which
Macaulay and the rest of the
Cardinal offensive line can be
proud.

Most fans never seem to
notice offensive linemen until
they do something wrong. This
goes double for centers. At
least guards and tackles get out
wide and lead the way on those
breakaway sweeps. But, to
most fans, the center seems to
just sit there in the middle of
the field and do nothing worth
talking about.
But what do fans km v?
To put it plainly, n- luch.
Center is the pivot -sition
in the offensive line. las to
make the calls, set the line, and
snap the ball perfectly (not to
mention the fact that he must
also block) any and every time
an offensive play takes place.
Any football team that wants to
win has to have a center it can
depend on. Stanford has one,
and his name is John Macaulay.
"We believe he's going to be
one of the best on the coast, if
not in the nation, at his posi
tion," said Head Coach Bill
Walsh speaking of his young
center. "He's got all the tools.
He's big. He's agile. He thinks
on his feet."
Offensive line coach Tom
Lovat also praised Macaulay.
"He's the most improved
young lineman we've got. He's
got the quickness and the
strength to be one of the fine
linemen in the league."
This is high praise for a
center who, last year at this
time, not only wasn't playing
center but wasn't even playing

varsity football.
Macaulay played guard on
the junior varisty squad last
fall. In the spring, searchingfor
a position where he could play,
Macaulay tried his hand at de
fensive end. Still looking for a
spot, he was switched to
center. And though it was hard
adjusting, especially learning
to snap, Macaulay found a
home at center.
"It's the pivotal position in
the line, and for him to make
that change so well is a real
credit to the man," Walsh said.
"He's met our highest expecta
tions."
"He's looked as good on film
as any Stanford center in the
past few years," Lovat said.
Macaulay is a big, rangy
athlete out of Bonita, Califor
nia, just south of San Diego. In
high school, Macaulay earned
All-CIF honors in baseball as
well as All-League in football.
On his high school football
team, he played linebackerand
tight end. and as you might ex
pect of someone living as far
down south as this 19-year old
does, Macaulay enjoys the
outdoor life. He's "into" the
ocean, it would seem, as he en
joys surfing, scuba diving, and
water-skiing.
A biology major, Macaulay
hopes to become a doctor. As
an irony of this last biographi
cal fact, Macaulay got his
chance through an inury to
former starting center, Fred
Burch.
When Burch found himself
unable to play during the war
mups of the Washington game,
Macaulay was called into ac
tion. And this starting assign
ment came as a surprise not
only to Macaulay but to Quar
terback Steve Dils as well.
Asked what his reaction to

the switch had been, Dils re
sponded, "I didn't have time to
worry about it. I heard about it
in warmups. When I got in the
game every snap was perfect."
Dils went on to explain that
since every snap was "right
there," he forgot all about
what could've been a traumatic
change.
"If you're worrying about
getting the snap, it screws you
up," Dils said, explaining how
necessary it is for a quarterback
to have complete confidence
in his center. Referring to the
snap Dils said, "It has to be
come automatic, like it has
now with John. He's done a
super job for us at center."
How did Macaulay feel about
the surprise start?
"I felt really confident," said
the big sophomore. "I felt I
could really get the job done. I
thought this was my chance to
make it or break it." It was and

hedid; that is, itwas his chance
and he did make the most of it.
Macaulay had played little
before this, and, though Lovat
said they had planned to bring
him along slowly, the young
center's performance in that
first game was instrumental in
securing a starting role.
"John had a fine game the
first game he played," Lovat
said. "After that first game, he
took the job over."
Lovat also pointed out that
even before the injury to
Burch, Macaulay had begun
"challenging him" for playing
time. Apparently, it was
Macaulay's inexperience that
was keeping him back.
Macaulay was grateful for
the move that switched him to
center.
"I thought the position
suited me a lot better," said
Macaulay of the change that

gave him his chance. "I
thought I had a lot better
chance to play."
And play he has, but most
fans still don't seem to notice.
How can he, as an offensive
lineman, get satisfaction out of
this game when people don't
seem to notice? What goals can
he set?
"From game to game, we
(the offensive line) want to give
Steve the best protection pos
sible. We want to get Darrin
(Nelson) and Phil (Francis) the
most yardage possible,"
Macaulay said. "When all
those things click, we know
we're doing the job."
It is perhaps a thankless job
at times, but it is a job that is
absolutely essential in winning
football games, a job of which
Macaulay and the rest of the
Cardinal offensive line can be
proud.

Most fans never seem to
notice offensive linemen until
they do something wrong. This
goes double for centers. At
least guards and tackles get out
wide and lead the way on those
breakaway sweeps. But, to
most fans, the center seems to
just sit there in the middle of
the field and do nothing worth
talking about.
But what do fans km v?
To put it plainly, n- luch.
Center is the pivot -sition
in the offensive line. las to
make the calls, set the line, and
snap the ball perfectly (not to
mention the fact that he must
also block) any and every time
an offensive play takes place.
Any football team that wants to
win has to have a center it can
depend on. Stanford has one,
and his name is John Macaulay.
"We believe he's going to be
one of the best on the coast, if
not in the nation, at his posi
tion," said Head Coach Bill
Walsh speaking of his young
center. "He's got all the tools.
He's big. He's agile. He thinks
on his feet."
Offensive line coach Tom
Lovat also praised Macaulay.
"He's the most improved
young lineman we've got. He's
got the quickness and the
strength to be one of the fine
linemen in the league."
This is high praise for a
center who, last year at this
time, not only wasn't playing
center but wasn't even playing

varsity football.
Macaulay played guard on
the junior varisty squad last
fall. In the spring, searchingfor
a position where he could play,
Macaulay tried his hand at de
fensive end. Still looking for a
spot, he was switched to
center. And though it was hard
adjusting, especially learning
to snap, Macaulay found a
home at center.
"It's the pivotal position in
the line, and for him to make
that change so well is a real
credit to the man," Walsh said.
"He's met our highest expecta
tions."
"He's looked as good on film
as any Stanford center in the
past few years," Lovat said.
Macaulay is a big, rangy
athlete out of Bonita, Califor
nia, just south of San Diego. In
high school, Macaulay earned
All-CIF honors in baseball as
well as All-League in football.
On his high school football
team, he played linebackerand
tight end. and as you might ex
pect of someone living as far
down south as this 19-year old
does, Macaulay enjoys the
outdoor life. He's "into" the
ocean, it would seem, as he en
joys surfing, scuba diving, and
water-skiing.
A biology major, Macaulay
hopes to become a doctor. As
an irony of this last biographi
cal fact, Macaulay got his
chance through an inury to
former starting center, Fred
Burch.
When Burch found himself
unable to play during the war
mups of the Washington game,
Macaulay was called into ac
tion. And this starting assign
ment came as a surprise not
only to Macaulay but to Quar
terback Steve Dils as well.
Asked what his reaction to

the switch had been, Dils re
sponded, "I didn't have time to
worry about it. I heard about it
in warmups. When I got in the
game every snap was perfect."
Dils went on to explain that
since every snap was "right
there," he forgot all about
what could've been a traumatic
change.
"If you're worrying about
getting the snap, it screws you
up," Dils said, explaining how
necessary it is for a quarterback
to have complete confidence
in his center. Referring to the
snap Dils said, "It has to be
come automatic, like it has
now with John. He's done a
super job for us at center."
How did Macaulay feel about
the surprise start?
"I felt really confident," said
the big sophomore. "I felt I
could really get the job done. I
thought this was my chance to
make it or break it." It was and

hedid; that is, itwas his chance
and he did make the most of it.
Macaulay had played little
before this, and, though Lovat
said they had planned to bring
him along slowly, the young
center's performance in that
first game was instrumental in
securing a starting role.
"John had a fine game the
first game he played," Lovat
said. "After that first game, he
took the job over."
Lovat also pointed out that
even before the injury to
Burch, Macaulay had begun
"challenging him" for playing
time. Apparently, it was
Macaulay's inexperience that
was keeping him back.
Macaulay was grateful for
the move that switched him to
center.
"I thought the position
suited me a lot better," said
Macaulay of the change that

gave him his chance. "I
thought I had a lot better
chance to play."
And play he has, but most
fans still don't seem to notice.
How can he, as an offensive
lineman, get satisfaction out of
this game when people don't
seem to notice? What goals can
he set?
"From game to game, we
(the offensive line) want to give
Steve the best protection pos
sible. We want to get Darrin
(Nelson) and Phil (Francis) the
most yardage possible,"
Macaulay said. "When all
those things click, we know
we're doing the job."
It is perhaps a thankless job
at times, but it is a job that is
absolutely essential in winning
football games, a job of which
Macaulay and the rest of the
Cardinal offensive line can be
proud.
