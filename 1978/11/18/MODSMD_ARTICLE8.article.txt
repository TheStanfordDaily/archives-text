# Dallas Cowboys contract Cardinal affliction

### RICK OSTILLER 
While Stanford students may
be familiar with the school's
many overseas campuses, they
may not realize another institu
tion, the Dallas Cowboys, has
taken in several recent
graduates from the Cardinal
football team.
Dallas has four former
Cards, while no other National
Football League has more than
1 two.
Tony Hill, Stanford's career
record holder in receptions
(140), yards gained receiving
(2225), and touchdown recep
tions (18), starts for the Cow
boys at wide receiver in only
his second season.
Defensive back Bennie
Barnes was picked up as a free
agent, and although injured
presently, the seven-year vete
ran is a mainstay in the Dallas
secondary.
Pat Donovan, a graduate in
U974, is first string guard on of
fense, and has been tabbed as
a potential All-Pro in the fu
ture.
Scott Laidlaw, also from the

Class of '74, plays fullback
behind Robert Newhouse,
The first Stanford grad to
move on to Dallas was Blaine
Nye, a graduate in 1967. Nye
played offensive guard for nine
seasons, making All-Pro sev
eral of those years.
Two men are primarily re
sponsible for the drafting of
Stanford players by the Cow
boys, as well as for the selec
tion of all college players by
Dallas.
Vice-President Gil Brandt
and his staff compile data on
college prospects throughout
the season and make recom
mendations at the end of the
year. Coach Tom Landry, who
has led the Cowboys since their
inception into the NFL in 1961,
has the final say on draftees.
He considers the recommen
dations of Brandt's staff, re
views the information and
makes the final decisions.
In recent years Brandt's re
commendations and Landry's
selections have not been
wrong very often, since the
Cowboys are generally consi

dered the best drafters in the
NFL. Year in and year out, de
spite an abysmally low order in
the draft, the Cowboys select
top quality rookies who were
passed over by other clubs.
There are several reasons
why the Cowboys seem to get
Stanford players more often
than other teams. One is the
luck of the draft, but there is
more to it than that. Another is
intelligence of the Stanford
players. In the Cowboy
scheme of things, intelligence
is important, as Gil Brandt
comments.
"We choose the best player
available as opposed to filling a
position...we consider intelli
gence and character as two
prime factors, but a player still
has to be a good athlete. We
start with a good athlete than
look for players wih intelli
gence and character," Brandt
said.
Landry emphasized smarts
even more. "It's possible for us
to rate intelligent players
higher than someone else with
more physical talent," he said.
"The talented player will fall
down our list if we feel he
doesn't have the intelligence
to make it in our offense."
With a variety of multiple
sets, Dallas has one of the
NFL's most complicated and
sophisticated offenses. Con
sidering the number of offen
sive draftees from Stanford it
may not be coincidental that
the Cards have one of college
football's most complete of
fenses as well.
In fact, coaching
philosophies may also have an
impact on the drafting of the
Cards by the Cowboys. Brandt
thinks both Stanford coach Bill
Walsh and his predecessor
Jack Christiansen have similar

coaching methods to those of
Landry, thereby making it
easier for Stanford players to fit
into the Cowboys system.
Landry considered one simi
larity between Stanford and
Dallas. "Our team stresses an
intelligent aspect," he said,
"and Stanford strikes me as
similar."
Another reason Cardinal
players end up on the Cow
boys is that Dallas has not had
any trouble with players they
have drafted from Stanford.
Landry thinks all his Stanford
starters are "excellent players
who make great contributions
to the team." Surprisingly,
problems have arisen for Stan
ford players on other teams,
often because of their college
background and training
techniques.
"The Stanford players do not
have a program as tough as
others in, say, the Big Ten,"
Landry says. "There they have
the physical preparation and
physical hitting. I'm not saying
Stanford is not successful. A lot
of teams say the Cowboys are
not a physical team like the
Steelers, but we win."
Brandt adds, "At Stanford,
football is not the most impor
tant thing. Academics are the
most important. I don't think
that is true at most schools."
The implications of this at
titude are great. While other
teams forego Stanford players
in the draft or have difficulties
with the ones they do select
because of what they consider
inadequate preparation, the
Cowboys will not be so ad

versely inclined.
One cannot argue with the
Cowboys' success in the draft.
Dallas works throughout the
year with college talent. Dur
ing the college football season
the Cowboys send out litera
ture about their organization
and the city of Dallas to players
across the country.; Several
Stanford players receive the
material. Landry says the litera
ture is not limited to players
the Cowboys hope to draft.
"We feel we're not wasting
our time by trying to sell our
organization to everyone," he
says. "If we do draft them we
want them excited about com
ing to the Cowboys."
So are any Cards of 1978
bound for the Cowboys, or
other NFL teams? Brandt says
quarterback .Steve Dils,
linebacker Gordy Ceresino,
Jef t cornerback Savann
Thompson, fullback Phil Fran
cis, and tight end Mitch Pleis all
have good chances in the draft.
Landry doesn't look intently at
the colleges until after the sea
son, but he says, "Stanford will
have their share this year as
they always do."
With the present coach,
football fortunes at Stanford
should continue to rise. Ac
cording to Brandt, "Bill Walsh
is a tremendous individual and
football coach. Stanford is very
fortunate to have him."
If Card football stays at a high
level of quality under Walsh, it
seems a sure bet that the
Stanford-in-Dallas campus will
continue to have an impressive
enrollment.
