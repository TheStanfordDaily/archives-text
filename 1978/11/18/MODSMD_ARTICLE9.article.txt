# Big Game lore
## 
### 
Today's game marks the 81 st renewal of the Big Game. Stanford
leads the series 38-32-10. Thirty-six of the games have been de
cided by seven points or less, including the last three at Berkeley.
The first game of the series was won by Stanford, 14-10, on its
home field. The highlight of the game was that student manager
Herbert Hoover forgot to bring the game ball to the stadium.
The trophy of the Big Game is the Stanford Axe. Rules have it
that the Axe goes to the winner of the Big Game. Since its incep
tion in 1899, however, it has been stolen eight times, including at
its debut.
| Stanford yell leader Billy Erb had used the Axe during a
Stanford-Cal baseball game to chop off the head of a dummy
Oskie Bear (or, Oskie Bear the Dummy). After the game, in a fit of
indignation, a group of Cal men spirited the Axe away.
To help conceal the Axe, they sawed off the handle, and it was
never replaced.
There have been other heists, including the "Immortal 21" of
1930 and the "Infamous Three" of 1973, and numerous attempted
heists, including the break-in at Tresidder several weeks ago.
The closeness of the rivalry is amazing. The composite total
points of the two teams shows Stanford ahead by only two points
after 80 games.
In 1972, Stanford took the lead 21-18 with under four minutes
left, and promptly intercepted the ball. Cal regained possession
1:13 to play, and drove to the Stanford eight with three
seconds left. As time ran out, Cal quarterback Vince Ferragamo
(now with the L.A. Rams) threw the winning touchdown.
In 1974, Cal went ahead with 26 seconds left 20-19, but Stanford
took the kickoff and marched to the Cal 33, and Mike Langford
kicked a 50-yard field goal with two seconds left to win, 22-20.
Two years ago, Duncan McColl recovered a Bear fumble on the
Cal two, and Ron Inge took it in from there to give outgoing Head
Coach Jack Christiansen a 27-24 win.
Stanford won last year's Big Game 21-3, behind a balanced
offense and a stalwart defense that limited Cal's offense to work
ing between the 20-yard lines. With a Sun Bowl bid going to the
winner, the Cards would not be denied.
Stanford has kept the Axe for two years, and no team has kept it
for more than that since 1966. That is another aspect of the tight
kivalry between the two universities.
