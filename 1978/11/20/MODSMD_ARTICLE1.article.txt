# Cards rout Cal; get bowl bid
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Berkeley — The Big Game is
usually no picnic but Saturday
Stanford feasted on California,
30-10.
The Cardinal defense de
voured the Golden Bear attack
while the Stanford offensive
line ate big holes in the injury
riddled, penalty-laden Bear de
fense and Darrin Nelson and
Steve Dils particularly had a
good ol' time.
From the first can of beer at
the earliest tailgater to the con
cluding strains of "All Right
Now" an hour-and-a-half after
the game, Stanford coaches,
rooters and players enjoyed
themselves immensely Satur
day. But the piece de resis
tance came hours later when
Memorial Stadium was once
again stone silent.
Stanford received and ac
cepted an invitation to play
New Year's Eve in the
Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston,
Tex.
"I hope we can go to a bowl

game and play together one
more time," said senior
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
after the game.
His wish was granted. The
Cards will play Georgia in the
Astrodome if Alabama beats
Auburn Dec. 2. If the Crimson
Tide loses, they are expected
to play Stanford although
Bama coach Bear Bryant said
Sunday he will recommend
that his team stay home if it
loses to Auburn.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh
said last week that each Big
Game has its hero, usually an
unexpected phoenix who
arises from the ashes of the
bench to the flame of quick
stardom. Saturday, (however,
the hero was the most logical
one.
Darrin Nelson, the most sen
sational back to ever wear a
Stanford jersey in a Big Game,
carried the ball 17 times for 177
yards and a TD and caught four
passes f0r.36 yards and another
score.

"He's an unbelievable foot
ball player," said teary-eyed
Bear coach Roger Theder in a
strained voice. "He's the finest
little back I've ever seen in my
years of coaching. He broke
our back time after time in the
first half. I think he made the
difference in today's game.
Nelson sat on a table in the
locker room after the game like
a medical museum specimen.
Both of his knees had swollen
to the size of small cantaloupes
"The offensive line had super
timing today," Nelson said.
"Every time I wanted to cut
back someone was there."
Nelson sprained his right
knee last week in Tempe and
he said he had doubts about
how much he would be able to
play Saturday.
But on his first run Saturday
he broke a tackle behind the
line of scrimmage and raced 4b
yards down the sideline on a
sweep left. Stanford quarter
back Steve Dils fired a 16-yard
