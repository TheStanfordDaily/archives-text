# Cards rout Cal; get bowl bid
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Berkeley — The Big Game is
usually no picnic but Saturday
Stanford feasted on California,
30-10.
The Cardinal defense de
voured the Golden Bear attack
while the Stanford offensive
line ate big holes in the injury
riddled, penalty-laden Bear de
fense and Darrin Nelson and
Steve Dils particularly had a
good ol' time.
From the first can of beer at
the earliest tailgater to the con
cluding strains of "All Right
Now" an hour-and-a-half after
the game, Stanford coaches,
rooters and players enjoyed
themselves immensely Satur
day. But the piece de resis
tance came hours later when
Memorial Stadium was once
again stone silent.
Stanford received and ac
cepted an invitation to play
New Year's Eve in the
Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston,
Tex.
"I hope we can go to a bowl

game and play together one
more time," said senior
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
after the game.
His wish was granted. The
Cards will play Georgia in the
Astrodome if Alabama beats
Auburn Dec. 2. If the Crimson
Tide loses, they are expected
to play Stanford although
Bama coach Bear Bryant said
Sunday he will recommend
that his team stay home if it
loses to Auburn.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh
said last week that each Big
Game has its hero, usually an
unexpected phoenix who
arises from the ashes of the
bench to the flame of quick
stardom. Saturday, (however,
the hero was the most logical
one.
Darrin Nelson, the most sen
sational back to ever wear a
Stanford jersey in a Big Game,
carried the ball 17 times for 177
yards and a TD and caught four
passes f0r.36 yards and another
score.

"He's an unbelievable foot
ball player," said teary-eyed
Bear coach Roger Theder in a
strained voice. "He's the finest
little back I've ever seen in my
years of coaching. He broke
our back time after time in the
first half. I think he made the
difference in today's game.
Nelson sat on a table in the
locker room after the game like
a medical museum specimen.
Both of his knees had swollen
to the size of small cantaloupes
"The offensive line had super
timing today," Nelson said.
"Every time I wanted to cut
back someone was there."
Nelson sprained his right
knee last week in Tempe and
he said he had doubts about
how much he would be able to
play Saturday.
But on his first run Saturday
he broke a tackle behind the
line of scrimmage and raced 4b
yards down the sideline on a
sweep left. Stanford quarter
back Steve Dils fired a 16-yard

pass to tight end Mitch Pleis on
the next play, moving the ball
to the 6.
Three plays later, Nelson
burst across the goal line from
one yard out.
Cal, unable to gain a first
down against the concrete
Stanford defense on its next
two possessions, relinquished
the ball to the Cards on the
Bear 49 late in the first period.
Stanford, continuing to
exploit Cal's inability to stop
the sweep, sent Nelson left for
11 yards on the first play of the
drive. The Cal defense then
stymied the Cards for two plays
and looked for the pass on
third-and-8. Stanford caught
the Bears by surprise — again
— sending Nelson sweeping
right for 24 yards. Students in
the Stanford rooting section,
by now in the throes of intense
hero worship, raised their arms
above their heads and bowed
down to the 5-foot-9, 174-
pound sophomore.
"We had hoped to throw
morethanwe did," Walsh said,
"but they blitzed so we ran
outside to break down their
blitz." No amount of adjust
ment in Cal's defense deterred
Nelson.
"Darrin Nelson is a very
good running back but he got
outside so much because their
offensive linemen were caving
down on our outside men,"
Cal defensive end Daryle
Skaugstad said.
"Cal had to blitz because
with their injuries they
couldn't continually go man to
man with us and beat us," Stan
ford offensive tackle Gene
Engle said.
Three plays after Nelson's
run, Gordon Banks spun
through the line from the 2 to
put Stanford ahead, 13-0. The
Bears and the Cards traded
field goals in the second quar
ter and Stanford took a 16-3
lead to the locker room.
The highlight of the second
period was not the kicking,
however, it was a 16-yard
sweep by Nelson which gave
the rabbit-quick scatback his
second 1000-yard season. Nel
son finished the regular season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50
pass receptions, only the sec
ond time one player has
rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Last
year, by Nelson.
Cal's offense, which "disap
pointed" Theder in the first
half, did little to assuage his

pain in the second stanza.
On the second play of the
half Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans stripped the ball
from Cal QB Rich Campbell
and recovered the loose ball
on the Cal 2-yard line. Two
plays later, fullback Jim Brown
shot through the right side of
the line with his first Stanford
touchdown.
Brown earned offensive
player of the game honors last
week but was scheduled to be
on the bench Saturday when
Phil Francis returned to the
starting lineup. Francis re
injured his ankle on the third
play of the game.
Brown responded in admir
able style with his second
straight 100-yard game, rush
ing for 101 yards on 22 carries.
The last time Stanford had two
backs rush for more than 100
yards in the same game was
probably before the advent of
the forward pass.
On Stanford's next drive,
Nelson swept around right side
for 12 yards before being dri
ven out of bounds by Cal cor
nerback Anthony Washington.
No Mr. Nice Guy took a late hit
at Nelson and then started mix
ing with the Stanford bench,
demonstrating why many con
sider him the dirtiest player in
the Pac-10.
Washington was ejected
from the game.
The ejection seemed to be
the least of Cal's problems.
Campbell seemed touched
with the same inconsistency
that plagued former Stanford
quarterback Mike Cordova. At

times he looked brilliant, at
others, horrible. But his con
sistency was a pittance com
pared to his receivers, who
didn't catch half as well as the
lacrosse players the Stanford
Band used to net oranges and
water balloons thrown from
the Cal rooting section.
The Stanford secondary li
mited Campbell to 12 comple
tions in 33 throws for 141 yards.
The Card defense also picked
off two Campbell aerials, the
second interception snagged
by senior Savann Thompson
who played well in place of the
injured Rick Parker.
Dils had few problems with
the Cal defense. Although sac
ked seven times, the senior QB
still completed 19 of 33 passes
for 297 yards. He finished the
year completing 247 of 391 pas
ses for 2943 yards and 22 TDs,
all school and conference
marks.
Sophomore wide receiver
Ken Margerum, although kept
out of the end zone, had seven
receptions — one other was
taken away on an invisible call
— for 141 yards.
Dils, who had completed a
touchdown pass in every game
this season, threaded the ball
between the defenders to a ju
bilant Vince Mulroy for an ap
parent 10-yard touchdown late
in the third quarter, but an of
fensive pass interference pen
alty nullified Mulroy's TD.
With fourth-and-5 from the
SVt and the Stanford rooting
section chanting "Co!" Dils
flipped a pass to Nelson on the

left flat. Nelson spun out of the
hold of linebacker David Shaw
at the 12, dodged another
tackle, hurdled Stanford tackle
Andre Hines at the 6 and
sprinted to the end zone with
his second touchdown of the
game.
Cal's offense, finally able to
sustain a drive, found the end
zone on an 8-yard pass from
Campbell to fullback Paul
Jones in the fourth quarter.
Jones rushed for 232 yards
against Washington State a
week ago but the Stanford de
fense corraled him for 74 yards
on 20 carries. It was another
disappointment in a day of dis
appointments for the Bears.
Theder was disappointed in
the way his team had played
but added "we're just not as
good a football team as Stan
ford right now."
Stanford was disappointed
because an apparently
locked-up berth in the Liberty
Bowl vanished when Missouri
upset Nebraska and the Tigers
received the bid.
The feeling in the Stanford
locker room was that the team
had played so well that they
deserved an invitation.
But an invitation did not
come — until 7:30 p.m. when
the Bluebonnet Bowl commit
tee called Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz and offered him the bid.
Ruetz called Walsh, conferred
with him, then accepted the
bid. The Cards were in.
The bowl bid was dessert for
a Stanford team which went
into the Big Came hungry and
came away sated.

game.
Cal's offense, finally able to

Stanford was disappointed
because an apparently

But an invitation did not
come — until 7:30 p.m. when
the Bluebonnet Bowl commit

Ruetz and offered him the bid.
Ruetz called Walsh, conferred
with him, then accepted the
bid. The Cards were in.
The bowl bid was dessert for

pass to tight end Mitch Pleis on
the next play, moving the ball
to the 6.
Three plays later, Nelson
burst across the goal line from
one yard out.
Cal, unable to gain a first
down against the concrete
Stanford defense on its next
two possessions, relinquished
the ball to the Cards on the
Bear 49 late in the first period.
Stanford, continuing to
exploit Cal's inability to stop
the sweep, sent Nelson left for
11 yards on the first play of the
drive. The Cal defense then
stymied the Cards for two plays
and looked for the pass on
third-and-8. Stanford caught
the Bears by surprise — again
— sending Nelson sweeping
right for 24 yards. Students in
the Stanford rooting section,
by now in the throes of intense
hero worship, raised their arms
above their heads and bowed
down to the 5-foot-9, 174-
pound sophomore.
"We had hoped to throw
morethanwe did," Walsh said,
"but they blitzed so we ran
outside to break down their
blitz." No amount of adjust
ment in Cal's defense deterred
Nelson.
"Darrin Nelson is a very
good running back but he got
outside so much because their
offensive linemen were caving
down on our outside men,"
Cal defensive end Daryle
Skaugstad said.
"Cal had to blitz because
with their injuries they
couldn't continually go man to
man with us and beat us," Stan
ford offensive tackle Gene
Engle said.
Three plays after Nelson's
run, Gordon Banks spun
through the line from the 2 to
put Stanford ahead, 13-0. The
Bears and the Cards traded
field goals in the second quar
ter and Stanford took a 16-3
lead to the locker room.
The highlight of the second
period was not the kicking,
however, it was a 16-yard
sweep by Nelson which gave
the rabbit-quick scatback his
second 1000-yard season. Nel
son finished the regular season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50
pass receptions, only the sec
ond time one player has
rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Last
year, by Nelson.
Cal's offense, which "disap
pointed" Theder in the first
half, did little to assuage his

pain in the second stanza.
On the second play of the
half Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans stripped the ball
from Cal QB Rich Campbell
and recovered the loose ball
on the Cal 2-yard line. Two
plays later, fullback Jim Brown
shot through the right side of
the line with his first Stanford
touchdown.
Brown earned offensive
player of the game honors last
week but was scheduled to be
on the bench Saturday when
Phil Francis returned to the
starting lineup. Francis re
injured his ankle on the third
play of the game.
Brown responded in admir
able style with his second
straight 100-yard game, rush
ing for 101 yards on 22 carries.
The last time Stanford had two
backs rush for more than 100
yards in the same game was
probably before the advent of
the forward pass.
On Stanford's next drive,
Nelson swept around right side
for 12 yards before being dri
ven out of bounds by Cal cor
nerback Anthony Washington.
No Mr. Nice Guy took a late hit
at Nelson and then started mix
ing with the Stanford bench,
demonstrating why many con
sider him the dirtiest player in
the Pac-10.
Washington was ejected
from the game.
The ejection seemed to be
the least of Cal's problems.
Campbell seemed touched
with the same inconsistency
that plagued former Stanford
quarterback Mike Cordova. At

times he looked brilliant, at
others, horrible. But his con
sistency was a pittance com
pared to his receivers, who
didn't catch half as well as the
lacrosse players the Stanford
Band used to net oranges and
water balloons thrown from
the Cal rooting section.
The Stanford secondary li
mited Campbell to 12 comple
tions in 33 throws for 141 yards.
The Card defense also picked
off two Campbell aerials, the
second interception snagged
by senior Savann Thompson
who played well in place of the
injured Rick Parker.
Dils had few problems with
the Cal defense. Although sac
ked seven times, the senior QB
still completed 19 of 33 passes
for 297 yards. He finished the
year completing 247 of 391 pas
ses for 2943 yards and 22 TDs,
all school and conference
marks.
Sophomore wide receiver
Ken Margerum, although kept
out of the end zone, had seven
receptions — one other was
taken away on an invisible call
— for 141 yards.
Dils, who had completed a
touchdown pass in every game
this season, threaded the ball
between the defenders to a ju
bilant Vince Mulroy for an ap
parent 10-yard touchdown late
in the third quarter, but an of
fensive pass interference pen
alty nullified Mulroy's TD.

Berkeley — The Big Game is
usually no picnic but Saturday
Stanford feasted on California,
30-10.
The Cardinal defense de
voured the Golden Bear attack
while the Stanford offensive
line ate big holes in the injury
riddled, penalty-laden Bear de
fense and Darrin Nelson and
Steve Dils particularly had a
good ol' time.
From the first can of beer at
the earliest tailgater to the con
cluding strains of "All Right
Now" an hour-and-a-half after
the game, Stanford coaches,
rooters and players enjoyed
themselves immensely Satur
day. But the piece de resis
tance came hours later when
Memorial Stadium was once
again stone silent.
Stanford received and ac
cepted an invitation to play
New Year's Eve in the
Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston,
Tex.
"I hope we can go to a bowl

game and play together one
more time," said senior
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
after the game.
His wish was granted. The
Cards will play Georgia in the
Astrodome if Alabama beats
Auburn Dec. 2. If the Crimson
Tide loses, they are expected
to play Stanford although
Bama coach Bear Bryant said
Sunday he will recommend
that his team stay home if it
loses to Auburn.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh
said last week that each Big
Game has its hero, usually an
unexpected phoenix who
arises from the ashes of the
bench to the flame of quick
stardom. Saturday, (however,
the hero was the most logical
one.
Darrin Nelson, the most sen
sational back to ever wear a
Stanford jersey in a Big Game,
carried the ball 17 times for 177
yards and a TD and caught four
passes f0r.36 yards and another
score.

"He's an unbelievable foot
ball player," said teary-eyed
Bear coach Roger Theder in a
strained voice. "He's the finest
little back I've ever seen in my
years of coaching. He broke
our back time after time in the
first half. I think he made the
difference in today's game.
Nelson sat on a table in the
locker room after the game like
a medical museum specimen.
Both of his knees had swollen
to the size of small cantaloupes
"The offensive line had super
timing today," Nelson said.
"Every time I wanted to cut
back someone was there."
Nelson sprained his right
knee last week in Tempe and
he said he had doubts about
how much he would be able to
play Saturday.
But on his first run Saturday
he broke a tackle behind the
line of scrimmage and raced 4b
yards down the sideline on a
sweep left. Stanford quarter
back Steve Dils fired a 16-yard

timing today," Nelson said.
"Every time I wanted to cut
back someone was there."
Nelson sprained his right
knee last week in Tempe and
he said he had doubts about
how much he would be able to
play Saturday.
But on his first run Saturday
he broke a tackle behind the
line of scrimmage and raced 4b
yards down the sideline on a
sweep left. Stanford quarter
back Steve Dils fired a 16-yard

pass to tight end Mitch Pleis on
the next play, moving the ball
to the 6.
Three plays later, Nelson
burst across the goal line from
one yard out.
Cal, unable to gain a first
down against the concrete
Stanford defense on its next
two possessions, relinquished
the ball to the Cards on the
Bear 49 late in the first period.
Stanford, continuing to
exploit Cal's inability to stop
the sweep, sent Nelson left for
11 yards on the first play of the
drive. The Cal defense then
stymied the Cards for two plays
and looked for the pass on
third-and-8. Stanford caught
the Bears by surprise — again
— sending Nelson sweeping
right for 24 yards. Students in
the Stanford rooting section,
by now in the throes of intense
hero worship, raised their arms
above their heads and bowed
down to the 5-foot-9, 174-
pound sophomore.
"We had hoped to throw
morethanwe did," Walsh said,
"but they blitzed so we ran
outside to break down their
blitz." No amount of adjust
ment in Cal's defense deterred
Nelson.
"Darrin Nelson is a very
good running back but he got
outside so much because their
offensive linemen were caving
down on our outside men,"
Cal defensive end Daryle
Skaugstad said.
"Cal had to blitz because
with their injuries they
couldn't continually go man to
man with us and beat us," Stan
ford offensive tackle Gene
Engle said.
Three plays after Nelson's
run, Gordon Banks spun
through the line from the 2 to
put Stanford ahead, 13-0. The
Bears and the Cards traded
field goals in the second quar
ter and Stanford took a 16-3
lead to the locker room.
The highlight of the second
period was not the kicking,
however, it was a 16-yard
sweep by Nelson which gave
the rabbit-quick scatback his
second 1000-yard season. Nel
son finished the regular season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50
pass receptions, only the sec
ond time one player has
rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Last
year, by Nelson.
Cal's offense, which "disap
pointed" Theder in the first
half, did little to assuage his

pain in the second stanza.
On the second play of the
half Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans stripped the ball
from Cal QB Rich Campbell
and recovered the loose ball
on the Cal 2-yard line. Two
plays later, fullback Jim Brown
shot through the right side of
the line with his first Stanford
touchdown.
Brown earned offensive
player of the game honors last
week but was scheduled to be
on the bench Saturday when
Phil Francis returned to the
starting lineup. Francis re
injured his ankle on the third
play of the game.
Brown responded in admir
able style with his second
straight 100-yard game, rush
ing for 101 yards on 22 carries.
The last time Stanford had two
backs rush for more than 100
yards in the same game was
probably before the advent of
the forward pass.
On Stanford's next drive,
Nelson swept around right side
for 12 yards before being dri
ven out of bounds by Cal cor
nerback Anthony Washington.
No Mr. Nice Guy took a late hit
at Nelson and then started mix
ing with the Stanford bench,
demonstrating why many con
sider him the dirtiest player in
the Pac-10.
Washington was ejected
from the game.
The ejection seemed to be
the least of Cal's problems.
Campbell seemed touched
with the same inconsistency
that plagued former Stanford
quarterback Mike Cordova. At

times he looked brilliant, at
others, horrible. But his con
sistency was a pittance com
pared to his receivers, who
didn't catch half as well as the
lacrosse players the Stanford
Band used to net oranges and
water balloons thrown from
the Cal rooting section.
The Stanford secondary li
mited Campbell to 12 comple
tions in 33 throws for 141 yards.
The Card defense also picked
off two Campbell aerials, the
second interception snagged
by senior Savann Thompson
who played well in place of the
injured Rick Parker.
Dils had few problems with
the Cal defense. Although sac
ked seven times, the senior QB
still completed 19 of 33 passes
for 297 yards. He finished the
year completing 247 of 391 pas
ses for 2943 yards and 22 TDs,
all school and conference
marks.
Sophomore wide receiver
Ken Margerum, although kept
out of the end zone, had seven
receptions — one other was
taken away on an invisible call
— for 141 yards.
Dils, who had completed a
touchdown pass in every game
this season, threaded the ball
between the defenders to a ju
bilant Vince Mulroy for an ap
parent 10-yard touchdown late
in the third quarter, but an of
fensive pass interference pen
alty nullified Mulroy's TD.
With fourth-and-5 from the
SVt and the Stanford rooting
section chanting "Co!" Dils
flipped a pass to Nelson on the

left flat. Nelson spun out of the
hold of linebacker David Shaw
at the 12, dodged another
tackle, hurdled Stanford tackle
Andre Hines at the 6 and
sprinted to the end zone with
his second touchdown of the
game.
Cal's offense, finally able to
sustain a drive, found the end
zone on an 8-yard pass from
Campbell to fullback Paul
Jones in the fourth quarter.
Jones rushed for 232 yards
against Washington State a
week ago but the Stanford de
fense corraled him for 74 yards
on 20 carries. It was another
disappointment in a day of dis
appointments for the Bears.
Theder was disappointed in
the way his team had played
but added "we're just not as
good a football team as Stan
ford right now."
Stanford was disappointed
because an apparently
locked-up berth in the Liberty
Bowl vanished when Missouri
upset Nebraska and the Tigers
received the bid.
The feeling in the Stanford
locker room was that the team
had played so well that they
deserved an invitation.
But an invitation did not
come — until 7:30 p.m. when
the Bluebonnet Bowl commit
tee called Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz and offered him the bid.
Ruetz called Walsh, conferred
with him, then accepted the
bid. The Cards were in.
The bowl bid was dessert for
a Stanford team which went
into the Big Came hungry and
came away sated.

Berkeley — The Big Game is
usually no picnic but Saturday
Stanford feasted on California,
30-10.
The Cardinal defense de
voured the Golden Bear attack
while the Stanford offensive
line ate big holes in the injury
riddled, penalty-laden Bear de
fense and Darrin Nelson and
Steve Dils particularly had a
good ol' time.
From the first can of beer at
the earliest tailgater to the con
cluding strains of "All Right
Now" an hour-and-a-half after
the game, Stanford coaches,
rooters and players enjoyed
themselves immensely Satur
day. But the piece de resis
tance came hours later when
Memorial Stadium was once
again stone silent.
Stanford received and ac
cepted an invitation to play
New Year's Eve in the
Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston,
Tex.
"I hope we can go to a bowl

game and play together one
more time," said senior
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
after the game.
His wish was granted. The
Cards will play Georgia in the
Astrodome if Alabama beats
Auburn Dec. 2. If the Crimson
Tide loses, they are expected
to play Stanford although
Bama coach Bear Bryant said
Sunday he will recommend
that his team stay home if it
loses to Auburn.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh
said last week that each Big
Game has its hero, usually an
unexpected phoenix who
arises from the ashes of the
bench to the flame of quick
stardom. Saturday, (however,
the hero was the most logical
one.
Darrin Nelson, the most sen
sational back to ever wear a
Stanford jersey in a Big Game,
carried the ball 17 times for 177
yards and a TD and caught four
passes f0r.36 yards and another
score.

"He's an unbelievable foot
ball player," said teary-eyed
Bear coach Roger Theder in a
strained voice. "He's the finest
little back I've ever seen in my
years of coaching. He broke
our back time after time in the
first half. I think he made the
difference in today's game.

11 yards on the first play of the
drive. The Cal defense then
stymied the Cards for two plays
and looked for the pass on
third-and-8. Stanford caught
the Bears by surprise — again
— sending Nelson sweeping
right for 24 yards. Students in
the Stanford rooting section,
by now in the throes of intense
hero worship, raised their arms
above their heads and bowed
down to the 5-foot-9, 174-
pound sophomore.
"We had hoped to throw
morethanwe did," Walsh said,
"but they blitzed so we ran
outside to break down their
blitz." No amount of adjust
ment in Cal's defense deterred
Nelson.
"Darrin Nelson is a very
good running back but he got
outside so much because their
offensive linemen were caving
down on our outside men,"
Cal defensive end Daryle
Skaugstad said.
"Cal had to blitz because
with their injuries they
couldn't continually go man to
man with us and beat us," Stan
ford offensive tackle Gene
Engle said.
Three plays after Nelson's
run, Gordon Banks spun
through the line from the 2 to
put Stanford ahead, 13-0. The
Bears and the Cards traded
field goals in the second quar
ter and Stanford took a 16-3
lead to the locker room.
The highlight of the second
period was not the kicking,
however, it was a 16-yard
sweep by Nelson which gave
the rabbit-quick scatback his
second 1000-yard season. Nel
son finished the regular season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50
pass receptions, only the sec
ond time one player has
rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Last
year, by Nelson.
Cal's offense, which "disap
pointed" Theder in the first
half, did little to assuage his

pain in the second stanza.
On the second play of the
half Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans stripped the ball
from Cal QB Rich Campbell
and recovered the loose ball
on the Cal 2-yard line. Two
plays later, fullback Jim Brown
shot through the right side of
the line with his first Stanford
touchdown.
Brown earned offensive
player of the game honors last
week but was scheduled to be
on the bench Saturday when
Phil Francis returned to the
starting lineup. Francis re
injured his ankle on the third
play of the game.
Brown responded in admir
able style with his second
straight 100-yard game, rush
ing for 101 yards on 22 carries.
The last time Stanford had two
backs rush for more than 100
yards in the same game was
probably before the advent of
the forward pass.
On Stanford's next drive,
Nelson swept around right side
for 12 yards before being dri
ven out of bounds by Cal cor
nerback Anthony Washington.
No Mr. Nice Guy took a late hit
at Nelson and then started mix
ing with the Stanford bench,
demonstrating why many con
sider him the dirtiest player in
the Pac-10.
Washington was ejected
from the game.
The ejection seemed to be
the least of Cal's problems.
Campbell seemed touched
with the same inconsistency
that plagued former Stanford
quarterback Mike Cordova. At

times he looked brilliant, at
others, horrible. But his con
sistency was a pittance com
pared to his receivers, who
didn't catch half as well as the
lacrosse players the Stanford
Band used to net oranges and
water balloons thrown from
the Cal rooting section.
The Stanford secondary li
mited Campbell to 12 comple
tions in 33 throws for 141 yards.
The Card defense also picked
off two Campbell aerials, the
second interception snagged
by senior Savann Thompson
who played well in place of the
injured Rick Parker.
Dils had few problems with
the Cal defense. Although sac
ked seven times, the senior QB
still completed 19 of 33 passes
for 297 yards. He finished the
year completing 247 of 391 pas
ses for 2943 yards and 22 TDs,
all school and conference
marks.
Sophomore wide receiver
Ken Margerum, although kept
out of the end zone, had seven
receptions — one other was
taken away on an invisible call
— for 141 yards.
Dils, who had completed a
touchdown pass in every game
this season, threaded the ball
between the defenders to a ju
bilant Vince Mulroy for an ap
parent 10-yard touchdown late
in the third quarter, but an of
fensive pass interference pen
alty nullified Mulroy's TD.
With fourth-and-5 from the
SVt and the Stanford rooting
section chanting "Co!" Dils
flipped a pass to Nelson on the

left flat. Nelson spun out of the
hold of linebacker David Shaw
at the 12, dodged another
tackle, hurdled Stanford tackle
Andre Hines at the 6 and
sprinted to the end zone with
his second touchdown of the
game.
Cal's offense, finally able to
sustain a drive, found the end
zone on an 8-yard pass from
Campbell to fullback Paul
Jones in the fourth quarter.
Jones rushed for 232 yards
against Washington State a
week ago but the Stanford de
fense corraled him for 74 yards
on 20 carries. It was another
disappointment in a day of dis
appointments for the Bears.
Theder was disappointed in
the way his team had played
but added "we're just not as
good a football team as Stan
ford right now."
Stanford was disappointed
because an apparently
locked-up berth in the Liberty
Bowl vanished when Missouri
upset Nebraska and the Tigers
received the bid.
The feeling in the Stanford
locker room was that the team
had played so well that they
deserved an invitation.
But an invitation did not
come — until 7:30 p.m. when
the Bluebonnet Bowl commit
tee called Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz and offered him the bid.
Ruetz called Walsh, conferred
with him, then accepted the
bid. The Cards were in.
The bowl bid was dessert for
a Stanford team which went
into the Big Came hungry and
came away sated.

Berkeley — The Big Game is
usually no picnic but Saturday
Stanford feasted on California,
30-10.
The Cardinal defense de
voured the Golden Bear attack
while the Stanford offensive
line ate big holes in the injury
riddled, penalty-laden Bear de
fense and Darrin Nelson and
Steve Dils particularly had a
good ol' time.
From the first can of beer at
the earliest tailgater to the con
cluding strains of "All Right
Now" an hour-and-a-half after
the game, Stanford coaches,
rooters and players enjoyed
themselves immensely Satur
day. But the piece de resis
tance came hours later when
Memorial Stadium was once
again stone silent.
Stanford received and ac
cepted an invitation to play
New Year's Eve in the
Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston,
Tex.
"I hope we can go to a bowl

game and play together one
more time," said senior
linebacker Gordy Ceresino
after the game.
His wish was granted. The
Cards will play Georgia in the
Astrodome if Alabama beats
Auburn Dec. 2. If the Crimson
Tide loses, they are expected
to play Stanford although
Bama coach Bear Bryant said
Sunday he will recommend
that his team stay home if it
loses to Auburn.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh
said last week that each Big
Game has its hero, usually an
unexpected phoenix who
arises from the ashes of the
bench to the flame of quick
stardom. Saturday, (however,
the hero was the most logical
one.
Darrin Nelson, the most sen
sational back to ever wear a
Stanford jersey in a Big Game,
carried the ball 17 times for 177
yards and a TD and caught four
passes f0r.36 yards and another
score.

"He's an unbelievable foot
ball player," said teary-eyed
Bear coach Roger Theder in a
strained voice. "He's the finest
little back I've ever seen in my
years of coaching. He broke
our back time after time in the
first half. I think he made the
difference in today's game.
Nelson sat on a table in the
locker room after the game like
a medical museum specimen.
Both of his knees had swollen
to the size of small cantaloupes
"The offensive line had super
timing today," Nelson said.
"Every time I wanted to cut
back someone was there."
Nelson sprained his right
knee last week in Tempe and
he said he had doubts about
how much he would be able to
play Saturday.
But on his first run Saturday
he broke a tackle behind the
line of scrimmage and raced 4b
yards down the sideline on a
sweep left. Stanford quarter
back Steve Dils fired a 16-yard

Three plays later, Nelson

the ball to the Cards on the

put Stanford ahead, 13-0. The
Bears and the Cards traded
field goals in the second quar
ter and Stanford took a 16-3
lead to the locker room.
The highlight of the second
period was not the kicking,
however, it was a 16-yard
sweep by Nelson which gave
the rabbit-quick scatback his
second 1000-yard season. Nel
son finished the regular season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50
pass receptions, only the sec
ond time one player has
rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Last
year, by Nelson.
Cal's offense, which "disap
pointed" Theder in the first
half, did little to assuage his

pain in the second stanza.
On the second play of the
half Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans stripped the ball
from Cal QB Rich Campbell
and recovered the loose ball
on the Cal 2-yard line. Two
plays later, fullback Jim Brown
shot through the right side of
the line with his first Stanford
touchdown.
Brown earned offensive
player of the game honors last
week but was scheduled to be
on the bench Saturday when
Phil Francis returned to the
starting lineup. Francis re
injured his ankle on the third
play of the game.
Brown responded in admir
able style with his second
straight 100-yard game, rush
ing for 101 yards on 22 carries.
The last time Stanford had two
backs rush for more than 100
yards in the same game was
probably before the advent of
the forward pass.
On Stanford's next drive,
Nelson swept around right side
for 12 yards before being dri
ven out of bounds by Cal cor
nerback Anthony Washington.
No Mr. Nice Guy took a late hit
at Nelson and then started mix
ing with the Stanford bench,
demonstrating why many con
sider him the dirtiest player in
the Pac-10.
Washington was ejected
from the game.
The ejection seemed to be
the least of Cal's problems.
Campbell seemed touched
with the same inconsistency
that plagued former Stanford
quarterback Mike Cordova. At

times he looked brilliant, at
others, horrible. But his con
sistency was a pittance com
pared to his receivers, who
didn't catch half as well as the
lacrosse players the Stanford
Band used to net oranges and
water balloons thrown from
the Cal rooting section.
The Stanford secondary li
mited Campbell to 12 comple
tions in 33 throws for 141 yards.
The Card defense also picked
off two Campbell aerials, the
second interception snagged
by senior Savann Thompson
who played well in place of the
injured Rick Parker.
Dils had few problems with
the Cal defense. Although sac
ked seven times, the senior QB
still completed 19 of 33 passes
for 297 yards. He finished the
year completing 247 of 391 pas
ses for 2943 yards and 22 TDs,
all school and conference
marks.
Sophomore wide receiver
Ken Margerum, although kept
out of the end zone, had seven
receptions — one other was
taken away on an invisible call
— for 141 yards.
Dils, who had completed a
touchdown pass in every game
this season, threaded the ball
between the defenders to a ju
bilant Vince Mulroy for an ap
parent 10-yard touchdown late
in the third quarter, but an of
fensive pass interference pen
alty nullified Mulroy's TD.
With fourth-and-5 from the
SVt and the Stanford rooting
section chanting "Co!" Dils
flipped a pass to Nelson on the

left flat. Nelson spun out of the
hold of linebacker David Shaw
at the 12, dodged another
tackle, hurdled Stanford tackle
Andre Hines at the 6 and
sprinted to the end zone with
his second touchdown of the
game.
Cal's offense, finally able to
sustain a drive, found the end
zone on an 8-yard pass from
Campbell to fullback Paul
Jones in the fourth quarter.
Jones rushed for 232 yards
against Washington State a
week ago but the Stanford de
fense corraled him for 74 yards
on 20 carries. It was another
disappointment in a day of dis
appointments for the Bears.
Theder was disappointed in
the way his team had played
but added "we're just not as
good a football team as Stan
ford right now."
Stanford was disappointed
because an apparently
locked-up berth in the Liberty
Bowl vanished when Missouri
upset Nebraska and the Tigers
received the bid.
The feeling in the Stanford
locker room was that the team
had played so well that they
deserved an invitation.
But an invitation did not
come — until 7:30 p.m. when
the Bluebonnet Bowl commit
tee called Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz and offered him the bid.
Ruetz called Walsh, conferred
with him, then accepted the
bid. The Cards were in.
The bowl bid was dessert for
a Stanford team which went
into the Big Came hungry and
came away sated.
