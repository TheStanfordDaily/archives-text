# Rape prevention: what's being done here?
## 
### LEAH HALPER 
(Editor's note: This is the first
of two articles discussing rape
at the University. This article
explores the University Rape
Education Project. Tomor
row's article examines the af
termath of rape.)
"Damn it," blasts Leah Kap
lan, assistant dean of student
affairs. "I want to cut the
number of University rapes
and I'll leave the rhetoric to
others. I care about what gets
the job done."
Since June, Kaplan estimates
that at least eight female stu
dents, faculty and staff mem
bers have been sexually as
saulted. Some of the rapists
were University students.
None were reported to the
police, and it is probable that
more rapes will soon be at
tempted as winter brings ear
lier darkness and "rape sea
son" here.
"A lot of people, especially
freshmen, are not aware that
Stanford has these problems,
that it's not some country
club,"says Lori Palmer, one
coordinator of the campus'
Rape Education Project (REP)
which sponsors rape preven
tion workshops. "Many of the
freshwomen don't know quite
whether to believe us or not
when we talk about rape." A
common initial reaction, she
said, is for first-year students to
question the need for precau
tions.
"They say,'l'm not restricted
at all by fear. I go where I want!'
They they pause, and say
'Maybel shouldn't,' "shesaid.
REP volunteers have given
eight workshop discussions
this year and they offer services
free of charge to any dorm,
fraternity, row house or Uni
versity group that invites them
to talk about rape prevention.
"I recognized the need for this
kind of education years ago,"
says Kaplan,"and I did not like
the way Stanford was respond
ing. This is really a dynamic
group — it takes time and
energy to educate students. I
hope the University ap
preciates them."
REP began giving workshops
last February. This year, after
bringing UC-Berkeley's rape
prevention coordinator, Maria
Sakovich, to campus to teach a
one-day volunteer training
session, REP began publicizing
its services across the Univer
sity campus. Although REP pre
sently gives priority for work
shop discussions to freshmen
dorms, no invitations are re
fused. A core of approximately
20 women and men conduct
the workshops; the group
does not solicit invitations.
"Right now, they are largely
nickel-and-diming it," Kaplan
said. She added that the group
raised enough funds during
the past summer to acquire
status as a University organiza
tion. To cover the cost of train
ing workers, using films and
booklets and having publicity
projects, Palmer says REP has
had to raise approximately
$2000 for this academic year.

SWOPSI. "We're still scrambl
ing for money," she said. "The
support people give us is more
often verbal than financial.
Everyone thinks we're doing a
great job but we need more
money."
Kaplan, the University's un
official rape prevention advo
cate since she became a dean
five years ago, points out that

first-year students are just one
group among many who be
nefit from rape education. "If
rape is part of our lives, it is
important to develop an intel
ligent, thoughtful preventive
attitude and also learn to cope
with it. Freshmen are one of my
beefs — how much informa
tion at orientation is overkill;
how much is scary? I want to be
sure that when RAs talk about
burlary and fire they men
tion rape. It should be talked
about openly. And rape here
isn't just a student thing,
either," she says. "An awful lot
of the women attacked here
are staff or faculty. What I'd
like is some solidarity in deal
ing with it."
A principle obstacle to de
creasing the number of rapes
here, Kaplan believes, is that
too few people are conscious
of rape prevention "as a way of
life. It's a matter of raising your
consciousness to the prob
lem," she says. "Whether or
not they do something about
it, women are scared about
rape and that interferes with
their education. After 6 p.m.,
this campus belongs to men,
because a lot of women won't
go out — they're paying equal
tuition and they won't use the
facilities that men do. It takes
100 times of repeating our fears
before men legitimize them,
and finally some professors are
becoming aware that evening
sections are a hardship on
female students."
Awareness of the problem
forces women to, at least, con
sider lifestyle changes, Kaplan
said, but she stressed that each
woman must decide at what
point she is willing to sacrifice
personal freedom for security.
"You don't necessarily have to
lock yourself in a room," ag
rees Palmer, "buttherearecer
tian safety choices you can
make, like locking doors, re
porting strangers and walking
with friends at night."
But making such a sacrifice is

a difficult decision, said Ellyn
Paldes, a sophomore REP
workshop facilitator. "I'm not
willing to change my lifestyle,"
she said. "But I think that be
cause of my fears I'll uncon
sciously change. I'll think
about being in danger when I
walk home late now."
Paldes said that although
rape is legally a deviant crime,
she finds that attitudes of men
here are often tolerant of rape,
thinking of it as recreation. "So
many guys have the attitude
that you're a toy; you're prop
erty. There's so many times
when women are open to rape
and they don't know it. Dates
are really conducive to rape.
I've found myself in dangerous
situations, where I've had to be
really friendly to some guy I
didn't even know. I think that's
typical of a lot of women —
they think they always haveob
ligations to be considerate
about everyone else's feel
ings."
Paldes believes the best
method of protecting against
rape is not by focusing on
self-defense methods, but
rather by changing attitudes.
"Why doesn't Sweden have
rapes? Why doesn't Israel? The
pressures on women and men
here are incredible. I really see
a need for women to be more
aggressive. A self-defense class
will protect me, but only
changing people's attitudes
about rape will stop it." In fact,
she adds, "Some people say

that teaching self-defense clas
ses will increase rape because
men will get angry.''
Almost all rapes, argues Dr.
James Paulson of Cowell, are
committed by "heterosexual
men who are scared. The
macho rapist is insecure of his
masculinity and he is violent.
Rapists have to be at war with
themselves; they have to be
emotionally insecure. They
seem to be needing the sup
port of friends more," he says,
citing as an example a recent
gang rape attempt on campus.
"Rape is an act of violence. Vio
lence is conditioned into these
people; they grew up in
families or communities that
were violent. And this is not to
say that rape is solely a product
of the lower socio-economic
classes. Not all the violence is
in the ghetto."
Recognizing the deep
seated psychological, social
and political causes of rape has
led many anti-rape groups
nationwide to actively seek
the help of men in combatting
rape, Kaplan says."I wouldn't
agree that rape is a women's
problem and if women were to
exclude men in helping to deal
with it, they would be losing a
lot of energy, a lot of clout."
Men must effect attitudinal
changes on a societal level and
on a local level serve as role
models for other men, she
said.
Sakovich, who wrote the
proposal for UC-Berkeley's

anti-rape campaign after being
assaulted two years ago, urges
men to treat rape as a personal
problem which affects them as
human beings. "Although
rapists will be the last to
change, if we can make rape as
horrible in other people's
minds as it really is, there will
be pressure on rapists. The real
prevention in rape lies in stop
ping rapists, and men will ulti
mately have to do that because
they have more clout with
other men."
"It's a lot more effective for a
man to say, 'Hey, why are you
joking about rape?' " concurs
Palmer. "Then, too, rape af
fects men on a very personal
level. Within ayearofa rape, 90
percent of all heterosexual
couples, including married
couples, break up. Most of
them don't even realize that
the reason is the emotional af
termath, the strain rape puts
on both partners."
For this reason, Palmer said
REP workshops try to involve
males as staff and participants.
"Men here are really open,"
she said. Since the beginning
of the year, approximately
one-half of those attending REP
workshops have been male.
"Mainly, we're trying to get
people to talk," she said. "In
one freshmen dorm I was in a
few weeks ago, the level of
awareness was really low. We
try to tell them that awareness
is one step towards prevention
of rape. Some of the women

want us to be coming in with
answers, but we don't have big
lists of dos and don'ts. We try
to talk about some of the diffe
rent opinions women have in
dealing with rape, in a large
cultural sense as well as a per
sonal one."
For women who wish to
learn self-defense technique
and rape theory, SWOPSI of
fers a class teaching "how to
defend ourselves in very prac
tical ways," according to
Paldes. "Most of all, I guess it
builds up your confidence
about deterring someone for a
minute or two so you can get
away." Although Paldes be
lieves the course has been the
"best class I've taken here,"
she complains that it may not
be offered again because of a

lack of funds and because of a
tremendous amount of paper
work required to keep it on the
SWOPSI roster each quarter.
"It makes me mad that they
have to charge us to even buy
equipment." she said. The
class members are currently
considering trying to get Uni
versity club status.
"No one is pretending every
thing is great here," Kaplan
conceded. "Whenever money
is talked about the University
kind of backs up and says,
'Well hold on.' Right now, I'd
give my right arm for an escort
service with male students who
could walk women around
campus at night. That's my next
priority. Stanford women are
here to get an education. I
want to see that they get it.'
