## Minority inolvement lacking 
### 
It has come to the attention of many
ethnic minority students on campus that
there is a total lack of political awareness
among our peers. Regardless of a "minor
ity" individual's personal reasons for
noninvolvement, it is felt by those in
volved in ethnic political organizations
that their lack of support or involvement
directly affects us all as minorities on cam
pus and in American society at large.
The University cannot be taken as an
exception to the rule and it, as an
academic institution, must be seen forthe
role it plays in our society in relation to the
status of minorities today. Since early
childhood we are fed the myths of Ameri
can social mobility. Minorities are "given
the alternatives from which they must
choose in order to "succeed" in this soci
ety. As an indiviciual, you must choose to
ignore your ethnic, historical past and cul
ture in exchange for competitive, indi
vidualistic advancement. If, as a minority,
you work hard enough to conform to
foreign ideals, you may make it to Stanford
or you can always make it big in the pro s.
This is a given, a realilty for anyone from
the minority sicie of town and, as such,
merits no judgement.
The fallacy of social mobility lies in the
apparent "success" of those of us who
"make it." This University, because of its
status in the overall American educational
system, is a good example. Stanford in the
name of diversity has actively admitted
minorities since the late 60s. Not that
minorities suddenly became intelligent
just then, but because of the social and
political climate at the time. Minorities
were in vogue, a curiosity of sorts, and
everyone just had to have some, 112 ine, but
what has happened since then; 1 We now
have "theme houses" where students of
the majority of our society may see
minorities in their natural habitat or a close
facsimile. Minorities can be "observed" in
a non-threatening atmosphere for diversi
ty's sake, of course. Minorities have come
and gone. You can now see some of them
behind the large plate glass window in

front of many of the more famous corpora
tions.
But what has this done for minority
communities? The University has admitted
several students from East Palo Alto. Vet,
that community continues to have one of
the highest infant mortality rates in the
nation. The economic, social and political
gain has been nil in that community. In a
larger context, minorities must not let the
example of one individual member of a
minority grup be exploited as representa
tive of progress for the entire minority
group. All the previous programs directed
at minorities, such as admission and finan
cial aid offers for further education, never
intended to directly improve conditions in
minority communities. These contempor
ary liberal programs only served to alien
ate from their community those few
minorities who were privileged to succeed
as individuals.
Minorities have witnessed their sense of
social and community responsibility pros
tituted to become successful individuals
as is typical of this society. In this sense,
some individual members of ethnic minor
ity groups have succeeded, as is evident
on this campus. However, there has not
been any substantial social, political, or
economic change for minority groups as a
communal whole. Educational institutions
cannot be seen as a tool for societal
change because these institutions, as a
product of that society, necessarily must
reflect the dominant views held in that soc
iety. Not only is scholarship a small factor
in the formation of the dominant ideology,
but most often it serves to justify and
propagate that ideology.
Minority groups must stop frivolous ar
guments dwelling on the possibility of
succeeding in this society without some
cost to ethnicity or cultural homogeneity.
Further, the passive attitude of waiting for
the panacea of education to improve the
social conditions in minority communities
must discontinue. Today minorities have
some educational resources available but
these alone will do no good unless they
are put to use. The case stands as

the epitome of cutbacks in favorable
minority legislature; yet, Bakke now has
minorities defending programs which
their older brothers and sisters once saw
as unsatisfactory for solving the problems
in their communities.
On this campus it is meaningless to say,
in a numerical sense, how many minority
students have been admitted if tew of
these can relate culturally to the group
which they are supposed to represent.
Further, it is nonsense to mention finan
cial aid when these minorities who are
admitted are little different financially
from the majority group students.
Minorities today need access to better
education as always, but this is only one of
the problems in ourcommunities. There is
no longer room for the liberal, paternalis
tic pacifiers used on minorities in the past.
These programs only opened the door for
a select few, allowing those individuals to
falsely claim "I made it on my own because
of my individual merits."
It is time for those minorities who have
come this far to prove that they live for
principles and not solely forindividualistic
monetary gains. Minorities have all too
often waited for society to react in their
favor. It is the task of minorities who truly
want to aid their communities to take "af
firmative action," and do that which no
one else has done nor will do for those
communities. Minorities must take what
education opportunities are available and
utilize them to their fullest extent. This
means not only developing the ability to
function in the dominant society ,but also
developing a deeper analysis of the social,
political, and economic situation which
will allow these minorities to acknowledge
a need for societal change, to ascertain
what in this society must be changed and,
finally, to develop a process to execute
that change.
