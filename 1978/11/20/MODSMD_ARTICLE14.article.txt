## Michael Economides Going home 
### 
I am going home.
I closed my eyes and fell asleep holding the
clod of Creek soil in my palm.
It'sbeen many years. I haven'tseen the moun
tains, the sea, the grape-laden trellis over my
balcony.
Memories overwhelm me â€” youth's joys and
sorrows, my quixotic mystic yearnings, my
dreams to come to America, the citadel of edu
cation. But my Creekness, torturing and allur
ing, liberatingand enslaving, has beenwith me.
I look inside myself and tremble. My ances
tors on my mother's side were vicious pirates
that feared no God or law. On my father's side
they were farmers, fighting the land and squeez
ing the precious juice from the famished Greek
soil. And further I see the ancients, larger than
life.
I've seen people who studied my heritage. I
speak the language naturally; I feel it, and I can
touch the body of the ancients. The scholars
think of my ancient world as dead, a corpse.
But we Greeks have the memory. Many times
I've wondered what "Greek" means. I think it is
memory. Memory that goes beyond time. Only
one other nation, the Jewish nation, can boast a
continuous memory that spans thousands of
years; and the Chinese.
In the vast expanses of the Far East, space and
time intermingle, there savagery and barbarism
prevailed and historical memory never took to
its maturity. The Jewish nation, forced into its
diaspora from time immemorial, has taken its
roots from the cultures it inhabited. Marx and

Hegel are lews but they draw their culture not
from the scriptureand the tradition of the nation
of Abraham butfrom the nation of the Germans.
We like to travel:
To sail beyond the sunset and the baths
of all the western stars, until I die
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles
And see the great Achilles whom we knew.
Tennyson, "Odysseus"
We are the spirit of the unresisting man on a
quest for new knowledge and new experience,
"strong in will to strive, to seek, to find and not
to yield."
We like to argue, we are political. We in
vented democracy.
We built the Parthenon when others still lived
in caves.
We wrote the Iliad, the Odyssey and An
tigone.
We conquered new lands and when we were
conquered we taught them culture. "Capta Cre
cia ferum victorem cepit," Cicero said.
We like to dance, to eat and drink, we love
life. We have a Zorba inside us.
We defied Rousseau who said "freedom lost
cannot be regained." We did over and again.
I cannot wait. Like another Odysseus I wantto
see the lights of my Ithaca glimmering. I wantto
kiss the soil of my land and immerse myself in
the sea, if only for just a moment.
