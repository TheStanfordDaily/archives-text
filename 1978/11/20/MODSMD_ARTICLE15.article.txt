Who killed Karen Silkwood?
This question was on the minds
of participants in dozens of
protest actions and memorial
services last week (November
13-17), the fourth anniversary of
her death at the age of 28.
Silkwood died when her car
ran off the road the night of
November 13,1974. As detailed
in a recent issue of Win
magazine, a pacifist weekly,
Silkwood had worked for two
years as a nuclear lab techni
cian at a plant in Oklahoma that
produced plutonium fuel rods
for a nuclear breeder reactor.
Owned by the Kerr-McGee
Corporation, the nation's
largest uranium producer, the
plant had been a dangerous
place to wo'k for many years. A
former Kerr-McGee supervisor
has testified that uranium dust
often covered the plant's
floors. Once a tank over
flowed, spilling out a solution
containing plutonium, one of
the most deadly substances in
existence. A former plant man
ager estimates that 2000 work
ers were contaminated with
airborne plutonium during the
six years he worked at the
plant. "The whole place was
one big leak," he says. "Every
time you turned around there
was another leak."
Silkwood was appalled by
these conditions when she

started working at the plant in
August 1972. She joined the
local Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union, and in July
1974 was elected to its steering
committee. Two months later
she flew to Washington, D.C.
to testify before the Atomic
Energy Commission about
Kerr-McGee's numerous
health and safety violations.
When she returned to Ok
lahoma, Silkwood began com
piling documents to prove that
the company had been produc
ing faulty plutonium rods.
On November 5, 1974 she
found plutonium on her skin.
Workers found that her whole
home was contaminated with
radiation, with the highest
levels inside her refrigerator.
The source of the radiation re
mains a mystery.
Finally, on the night of
November 13, 1974, Silkwood
left a union dinner to drive to
nearby Oklahoma City, where
she was to hand to a New York
Times reporter her documents
on the faulty plutonium rods
and health and safety viola
tions. Ten minutes later hercar
ran off the road, killing her.
The reporter, waiting at a Holi
day Inn, was unable to use the
phone to find out what had
happened to her â€” mysteri
ously, the phones were out of
order.

The documents in
Silkwood's car were never
found. An expert hired by her
union found evidence that her
car had been forced off the
road by another vehicle. The
justice Department and FBI re
fused to investigate.
These are the facts of
Silkwood's death, but the vile
aspects of the story do not end
there. At the instigation of the
National Organization for
Women and other groups, a
Congressional subcommittee
began investigating Silkwood's
death and the health and safety
charges she had raised. In April
1976 the subcommittee disco
vered that a Nashville news
paper reporter who had inter
viewed Silkwood for a book on
nuclear power was in reality an
FBI informant. Headed by
Michigan Democrat )ohn
Dingell, the subcommittee
began digging into the case.
But only a few days before elec
tions that November, a prosti
tute in Dingell's home district
claimed he had been one of
her customers. She did not re
veal that her roommate was an
FBI informant. Dingell won
re-election but lost his chair of
the subcommittee, cutting off
its investigation.
Meanwhile, Silkwood's pa
rents launched a suit in Federal
court in Oklahoma City, charg
ing KeVr-McGee with willful
negligence in allowing
pi utonium contamination in its
plant, and with conspiring to
violate their daughter's civil
rights. During a subsequent
hearing, one member of
Silkwood's union was men
tioned in a deposition. Two
days later someone broke into
and searched her house.
Subsequently, research to
support the suit uncovered a
nationwide pattern of surveil
lance conducted on behalf of
nuclear companies. Atomic
workers, scientists and anti
nuclear activists have been
watched by pocal police and
private investigators. A former
Kerr-McCee secretary testified
that while she worked for the
Oklahoma City Policy Depart
ment, officers engaged in il
legal wiretapping, electronic
surveillance and breaking and
entering. Other evidence indi
cates that the same police gave
information on Silkwood be
fore her death to the security
chief of Kerr-McGee, and that a
company agent broke into her
home and photographed the
documents she had gathered
And so, four years after her
car ran off the road, the ques
tion still remains: who killed
Karen Silkwood? The answer
seems inevitable, and should
not be surprising. Whoever
was responsible for her death,
Silkwood did notdie invain. As
a woman who fought for the
safety of workers and against
the dangers of nuclear power,
Karen Silkwood has become a
symbol for feminists, union ac
tivists, and anti-nuclear protes
ters. As a member of her union
has said, "She was willing togo
ahead when other people were
afraid." She will not be forgot
ten.
