Recognizing
the PLO
Dan )acobs' defense of Is
raeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin (Daily, Nov.
15) contained several ques
tionable statements.
In justifying Begin's refusal
to negotiate with the PLO,
Jacobs wrote: "The PLO re
fuses to recognize Israel's right
to exist . . . Yasir Arafat would

take delight in pushing every
Jew into the sea." The PLO,
which is an umbrella organiza
tion representing nearly four
million Palestinians, has re
peatedly signalled its willing
ness to recognize Israel in ex
change for recognition by Is
rael of Palestinian rights. With
holding advance recognition
of Israel is virtually the only
negotiating weapon the PLO
has. Nevertheless, last
November the PLO strongly

supported a short-lived decla
ration by the U.S. and the
Soviet Union that called forac
ceptance of the "sovereignty
and territorial integrity" of Is
rael, as well as for recognition
of the "legitimate rights" of the
Palestinians. The U.S. backed
down from the statement after
Israel objected to it.
More recently, Vasir Arafat
told Anthony Lewis of the New
York Times that "the only pos
sible solution" to the Middle
East problem was for Israel and
a Palestinian state to co-exist
under international security
guarantees. Arafat then asked,
"Which do you think will en
danger peace more — having
the Palestinians as they are,
deprived of their national
rights, their human rights, scat
tered here and there, having ill
treatment everywhere, or hav
ing the Palestinians settled as
normal civilians with their na
tional pride restored and with a
flag of their own?"
Jacobs wrote, "Begin has
never said that he will not give
back the West Bank, just that
its final status will be
negotiated." Precisely the op
posite is true. From the time he
was aguerrillafighterfor Israeli
independence Begin has
claimed the West Bank (Judea
and Samaria) for Israel, saying
in 1948: "Our God-given coun
try is a unity. The attempt to
dissect it is not only a crime but
a blasphemy and an abor
tion. . . . We shall never
forego this natural right." Last
September Begin told the Is
raeli Knesset that "there will
not be under any conditions or
in any circumstances a Palesti
nian state," and pledged that
Israeli troops would remain on
the West Bank indefinitely.
Jacobs is right that Israel
needs and wants peace. Tens
of thousands of Israelis have

joined in demonstrations to
urge on their government a
more flexible approach toward
giving up the occupied ter
ritories. But the Israeli gov
ernment has not responded.
The latest obstacle to signing a
peace treaty between Egypt
and Israel is Israel's refusal to
set a timetable for even the li
mited form of West Bank au
tonomy that Begin agreed to at
Camp David.
Palestinians must have a
voice in determining their own
future if there is to be perma
nent peace in the Middle East.
West Bank mayors
Palestinian leaders have made
it clear that only the PLO can
speak for the Palestinian
people. There is simply no
other organization that can act
in that capacity. In any case, if
one party to a conflict were to
determine who could, or could
not, represent the other side,
as Israel insists on doing, the
resulting negotiations would
obviously be a sham.
Holding on to the West Bank
is profitable to Israel, since the
area is a source of cheap labor
and a convenient market for Is
raeli goods, but in this day of
modern warfare it does not
provide security. Only peace
can provide that, and there can
be no peace until Israelis and
Palestinians live side by side as
equals rather than as occupiers
and oppressed.

Stanford
Lecture on Italy
misleading
On November 14, during the
Tuesday Luncheon Series at
the Bechtel International
Center, Dr. Cuelfo Frulla, from
Italy presented his topic:
"Italy, the Situation Today." Al

though he admitted that he is
neither a historian nor a politi
cal scientist (he presently
teaches history of opera at the
University), I still think that he
misled the audience with his
point of view.
Dr. Frulla presented the pre
sent situation entirely as a
power struggle, giving the im
pression that the political par
ties are scrambling only for
power, lacking ideology or,
worse, integrity and coher
ence. Many political leaders
are like that, but many are not
and one must be really very
cynical to make such a state
ment.
Another point which was
brought up is the problem of
investments. Dr. Frulla said:
"Now the Germans invest a lot
in Italy, much more than other
countries do, and if Germany
got to the point to trust Italy, it
means that the Italian economy
must not be as gloomy as it
looks." I wish that the laws of
economics could be explained
as simplistically as that. Ger
mans invest part of their capital
in Italy not to show their trust,
but because laboris cheaper in
Italy. I would not call this trust.
This is profit.
The most puzzling state
ment, though, was when we
heard that the Red Brigades in
Italy are very upset because the
Communists started moving
towards the Christian Democ
rats, forming that kind of al
liance which has been called
"the historical compromise." I
feel this is a distortion of facts.
The Red Brigades couldn't care
less about that. Anyone who is
familiar with their background
and their literature knows that,
for ideological reasons, they
put the Communists and the
Christian Democrats on the
same level and they do not
make a distinction between the

two parties or any part of the
establishment.
Forthe Red Brigades, thereis
nothing communist about the
P.C.I. (Italian Communist
Party) except the name. Their
goal is to hit the "status quo,"
no matter if it is represented by
left or right wing. How could
the Red Brigades become
upset when they do not believe
in a parliamentary system?
We all realize that it takes
more than a humanist to speak
about the present political
situation of Italy, which is very
complicated. But unfortu
nately the presentation by
Bechtel International Center
reflects the attitude of many
Europeans who think that the
Americans are not well in
formed about politics there
fore they can be fed with any
kind of information. There are
a lot of Americans who do not
care to be informed (as there
are many Italians who don't),
but there are other Americans
who are quite informed and
they felt puzzled about state
ments which need to be sub
stantiated by evidence.
There are forces of history
and ideology behind different
acts which were not explained
during Dr. Frulla's presenta
tion.

Lecture on Italy
misleading
On November 14, during the
Tuesday Luncheon Series at
the Bechtel International
Center, Dr. Cuelfo Frulla, from
Italy presented his topic:
"Italy, the Situation Today." Al

though he admitted that he is
neither a historian nor a politi
cal scientist (he presently
teaches history of opera at the
University), I still think that he
misled the audience with his
point of view.
Dr. Frulla presented the pre
sent situation entirely as a
power struggle, giving the im
pression that the political par
ties are scrambling only for
power, lacking ideology or,
worse, integrity and coher
ence. Many political leaders
are like that, but many are not
and one must be really very
cynical to make such a state
ment.
Another point which was
brought up is the problem of
investments. Dr. Frulla said:
"Now the Germans invest a lot
in Italy, much more than other
countries do, and if Germany
got to the point to trust Italy, it
means that the Italian economy
must not be as gloomy as it
looks." I wish that the laws of
economics could be explained
as simplistically as that. Ger
mans invest part of their capital
in Italy not to show their trust,
but because laboris cheaper in
Italy. I would not call this trust.
This is profit.
The most puzzling state
ment, though, was when we
heard that the Red Brigades in
Italy are very upset because the
Communists started moving
towards the Christian Democ
rats, forming that kind of al
liance which has been called
"the historical compromise." I
feel this is a distortion of facts.
The Red Brigades couldn't care
less about that. Anyone who is
familiar with their background
and their literature knows that,
for ideological reasons, they
put the Communists and the
Christian Democrats on the
same level and they do not
make a distinction between the

two parties or any part of the
establishment.
Forthe Red Brigades, thereis
nothing communist about the
P.C.I. (Italian Communist
Party) except the name. Their
goal is to hit the "status quo,"
no matter if it is represented by
left or right wing. How could
the Red Brigades become
upset when they do not believe
in a parliamentary system?
We all realize that it takes
more than a humanist to speak
about the present political
situation of Italy, which is very
complicated. But unfortu
nately the presentation by
Bechtel International Center
reflects the attitude of many
Europeans who think that the
Americans are not well in
formed about politics there
fore they can be fed with any
kind of information. There are
a lot of Americans who do not
care to be informed (as there
are many Italians who don't),
but there are other Americans
who are quite informed and
they felt puzzled about state
ments which need to be sub
stantiated by evidence.
There are forces of history
and ideology behind different
acts which were not explained
during Dr. Frulla's presenta

Recognizing
the PLO
Dan )acobs' defense of Is
raeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin (Daily, Nov.
15) contained several ques
tionable statements.
In justifying Begin's refusal
to negotiate with the PLO,
Jacobs wrote: "The PLO re
fuses to recognize Israel's right
to exist . . . Yasir Arafat would

take delight in pushing every
Jew into the sea." The PLO,
which is an umbrella organiza
tion representing nearly four
million Palestinians, has re
peatedly signalled its willing
ness to recognize Israel in ex
change for recognition by Is
rael of Palestinian rights. With
holding advance recognition
of Israel is virtually the only
negotiating weapon the PLO
has. Nevertheless, last
November the PLO strongly

supported a short-lived decla
ration by the U.S. and the
Soviet Union that called forac
ceptance of the "sovereignty
and territorial integrity" of Is
rael, as well as for recognition
of the "legitimate rights" of the
Palestinians. The U.S. backed
down from the statement after
Israel objected to it.
More recently, Vasir Arafat
told Anthony Lewis of the New
York Times that "the only pos
sible solution" to the Middle
East problem was for Israel and
a Palestinian state to co-exist
under international security
guarantees. Arafat then asked,
"Which do you think will en
danger peace more — having
the Palestinians as they are,
deprived of their national
rights, their human rights, scat
tered here and there, having ill
treatment everywhere, or hav
ing the Palestinians settled as
normal civilians with their na
tional pride restored and with a
flag of their own?"
Jacobs wrote, "Begin has
never said that he will not give
back the West Bank, just that
its final status will be
negotiated." Precisely the op
posite is true. From the time he
was aguerrillafighterfor Israeli
independence Begin has
claimed the West Bank (Judea
and Samaria) for Israel, saying
in 1948: "Our God-given coun
try is a unity. The attempt to
dissect it is not only a crime but
a blasphemy and an abor
tion. . . . We shall never
forego this natural right." Last
September Begin told the Is
raeli Knesset that "there will
not be under any conditions or
in any circumstances a Palesti
nian state," and pledged that
Israeli troops would remain on
the West Bank indefinitely.
Jacobs is right that Israel
needs and wants peace. Tens
of thousands of Israelis have

joined in demonstrations to
urge on their government a
more flexible approach toward
giving up the occupied ter
ritories. But the Israeli gov
ernment has not responded.
The latest obstacle to signing a
peace treaty between Egypt
and Israel is Israel's refusal to
set a timetable for even the li
mited form of West Bank au
tonomy that Begin agreed to at
Camp David.
Palestinians must have a
voice in determining their own
future if there is to be perma
nent peace in the Middle East.
West Bank mayors
Palestinian leaders have made
it clear that only the PLO can
speak for the Palestinian
people. There is simply no
other organization that can act
in that capacity. In any case, if
one party to a conflict were to
determine who could, or could
not, represent the other side,
as Israel insists on doing, the
resulting negotiations would
obviously be a sham.
Holding on to the West Bank
is profitable to Israel, since the
area is a source of cheap labor
and a convenient market for Is
raeli goods, but in this day of
modern warfare it does not
provide security. Only peace
can provide that, and there can
be no peace until Israelis and
Palestinians live side by side as
equals rather than as occupiers

has. Nevertheless, last
November the PLO strongly

supported a short-lived decla
ration by the U.S. and the
Soviet Union that called forac
ceptance of the "sovereignty
and territorial integrity" of Is
rael, as well as for recognition
of the "legitimate rights" of the
Palestinians. The U.S. backed
down from the statement after
Israel objected to it.
More recently, Vasir Arafat
told Anthony Lewis of the New
York Times that "the only pos
sible solution" to the Middle
East problem was for Israel and
a Palestinian state to co-exist
under international security
guarantees. Arafat then asked,
"Which do you think will en
danger peace more — having
the Palestinians as they are,
deprived of their national
rights, their human rights, scat
tered here and there, having ill
treatment everywhere, or hav
ing the Palestinians settled as
normal civilians with their na

Jacobs wrote, "Begin has
never said that he will not give
back the West Bank, just that
its final status will be
negotiated." Precisely the op
posite is true. From the time he
was aguerrillafighterfor Israeli
independence Begin has
claimed the West Bank (Judea
and Samaria) for Israel, saying
in 1948: "Our God-given coun
try is a unity. The attempt to
dissect it is not only a crime but
a blasphemy and an abor
tion. . . . We shall never
forego this natural right." Last
September Begin told the Is
raeli Knesset that "there will
not be under any conditions or
in any circumstances a Palesti
nian state," and pledged that
Israeli troops would remain on
the West Bank indefinitely.
Jacobs is right that Israel
needs and wants peace. Tens
of thousands of Israelis have

joined in demonstrations to
urge on their government a
more flexible approach toward
giving up the occupied ter
ritories. But the Israeli gov
ernment has not responded.
The latest obstacle to signing a
peace treaty between Egypt
and Israel is Israel's refusal to
set a timetable for even the li
mited form of West Bank au
tonomy that Begin agreed to at
Camp David.
Palestinians must have a
voice in determining their own
future if there is to be perma

West Bank mayors
Palestinian leaders have made
it clear that only the PLO can
speak for the Palestinian
people. There is simply no
other organization that can act
in that capacity. In any case, if
one party to a conflict were to
determine who could, or could
not, represent the other side,
as Israel insists on doing, the
resulting negotiations would
obviously be a sham.
Holding on to the West Bank
is profitable to Israel, since the
area is a source of cheap labor
and a convenient market for Is
raeli goods, but in this day of
modern warfare it does not
provide security. Only peace
can provide that, and there can
be no peace until Israelis and
Palestinians live side by side as
equals rather than as occupiers
and oppressed.

Lecture on Italy
misleading
On November 14, during the
Tuesday Luncheon Series at
the Bechtel International
Center, Dr. Cuelfo Frulla, from
Italy presented his topic:
"Italy, the Situation Today." Al

though he admitted that he is
neither a historian nor a politi
cal scientist (he presently
teaches history of opera at the
University), I still think that he
misled the audience with his
point of view.
Dr. Frulla presented the pre
sent situation entirely as a
power struggle, giving the im
pression that the political par
ties are scrambling only for
power, lacking ideology or,
worse, integrity and coher
ence. Many political leaders
are like that, but many are not
and one must be really very
cynical to make such a state
ment.
Another point which was
brought up is the problem of
investments. Dr. Frulla said:
"Now the Germans invest a lot
in Italy, much more than other
countries do, and if Germany
got to the point to trust Italy, it
means that the Italian economy
must not be as gloomy as it
looks." I wish that the laws of
economics could be explained
as simplistically as that. Ger
mans invest part of their capital
in Italy not to show their trust,
but because laboris cheaper in
Italy. I would not call this trust.
This is profit.
The most puzzling state
ment, though, was when we
heard that the Red Brigades in
Italy are very upset because the
Communists started moving
towards the Christian Democ
rats, forming that kind of al
liance which has been called
"the historical compromise." I
feel this is a distortion of facts.
The Red Brigades couldn't care
less about that. Anyone who is
familiar with their background
and their literature knows that,
for ideological reasons, they
put the Communists and the
Christian Democrats on the
same level and they do not
make a distinction between the

two parties or any part of the
establishment.
Forthe Red Brigades, thereis
nothing communist about the
P.C.I. (Italian Communist
Party) except the name. Their
goal is to hit the "status quo,"
no matter if it is represented by
left or right wing. How could
the Red Brigades become
upset when they do not believe
in a parliamentary system?
We all realize that it takes
more than a humanist to speak
about the present political
situation of Italy, which is very
complicated. But unfortu
nately the presentation by
Bechtel International Center
reflects the attitude of many
Europeans who think that the
Americans are not well in
formed about politics there
fore they can be fed with any
kind of information. There are
a lot of Americans who do not
care to be informed (as there
are many Italians who don't),
but there are other Americans
who are quite informed and
they felt puzzled about state
ments which need to be sub
stantiated by evidence.
There are forces of history
and ideology behind different
acts which were not explained
during Dr. Frulla's presenta
tion.
