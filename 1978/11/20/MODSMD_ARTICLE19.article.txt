# In post-game of musical bowl bids, Stanford finishes in Bluebonnet seat
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
The drama surrounding Stanford's ac
ceptance of the Bluebonnet Bowl bid,
which came following the Cardinals'
30-10 victory over California, nearly
equaled that of an Alfred Hitchcock
cinematic thriller.
Suspense blended with the annual
pre-BigCame hoopla when Liberty Bowl
representatives informed Stanford offi
cials that a Cardinalvictory wouldpracti
cally insure participation in the classic at
Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 23.
The stage, of course, was Memorial
Stadium in Berkeley. While the Cards
quicklv dispelled any tension involving
the game's outcome, the focus shifted
to the press box, where Gary Cavalli,
Stanford sports information director,
phoned a Liberty BowLofficial after each
quarter to inform him of the game's
progress.
After the first quarter, with Stanford
leading 13-0, the Liberty Bowl official
said "great," according to Cavalli.
By halftime, the Cards were up 16-3.
"You're in it," was the message.
Stanford increased its lead to 30-3
after three periods, and the representa
tive said, "You've got a good shot." All
that remained now was an official Lib
erty Bowl bid.

Instead, Missouri's 35-31 upset of
Nebraska brought on further complica
tions. Five minutes into the fourth quar
ter Cavalli received a call from the Lib
erty Bowl man saying that 7-4 Missouri
would get the bid.
Cavalli then sprang into action, calling
the Peach, Fiesta, Sun and Bluebonnet
Bowls. He reached Tex Thornton, the
Bluebonnet director, whose attitude
Cavalli described as "noncomittal."
"He said they would decide Sunday or
Monday, and I left the stadium feeling
not really optimistic," Cavalli said.
The curtain had yet to be lowered,
however. Around 7:30 Saturday evening
Stanford Athletic Director joe Ruetz got a
phone call from the Bluebonnet people
with a bid.
Ruetz immediately discussed the offer
with Stanford coach Bill Walsh, and they
decided to accept. In many cases the
decision is made by a players' vote, but
Cavalli explained that that was unneces
sary.
"Last week I talked with about half the
team, and the players had all expressed
enthusiasm â€” there was no objection
whatsoever," he said, adding that a
Peach Bowl bid would have required a
vote since that game is held on Christ
mas Day.

All of this means that the Cards will be
in action Dec. 31 at the Houston As
trodome. Kickoff time is 7 p.m. CST (5
p.m., Pacific), and the game will be syn
dicated nationally over the Miz-Lou
Television Network and broadcast on
NBC radio.
Probably 3000 to 5000 Stanford rooter
tickets will go on sale within the week.
Stanford will face either 9-1 Alabama
or 8-1-1 Georgia, though 'Bama coach
Bear Bryant said he would accept only a
Sugar Bowl bid, according to The As
sociated Press.
No matter who the opponent is, at
least two Cards are looking forward to
the Bluebonnet. "It's a fulfilling end to
the season," said linebacker Gordy
Ceresino. "I was shocked that we hadn't
been approached for a bowl right after
the Big Game, but the Bluebonnet
people are the lucky ones."
"I definitely want to play," Darrin Nel
son agreed, "though I need a little time
off for my knee."
Nelson had written off any possibility
of post-season play after the Liberty
Bowl letdown. "I thought we wouldn't
get any (bids), period," he said. "I was a
little disappointed because we have a
good team with a real versatile offense."
Thus, the ending of "Stanford's
Search For a Bowl" is a happy one.
