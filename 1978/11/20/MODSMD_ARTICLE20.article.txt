# A
						grand finale (almost)
## 
### EMILIE DEUTSCH 
THE BIG CAME is over.
The decimation of 40 kegs and the lawn of
the DU house has been accomplished. The
American Impress Card and the flashing Ugh
sign have been removed from the ceiling of
Mem Aud. The masses that followed the
Band from the shores of Lake Lagunita to the
mud at Fisherman's Wharf have been sub
dued for another year.
And after Saturday's 30-10 trouncing of the
Bears across the Bay, the seniors on the Car
dinal football team were almost sure they'd
played their last game for Stanford.
Fortunately for them, they were wrong.
They'll be spending at least part of New
Year's Eve on the artificial turf of Houston's
Astrodome. But the false alarms that
sounded immediately after the Axe had been
paraded around the inside of Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium were not unfounded.
No bowl invitations had been issued. The
seniors on "the best 7-4 team in the nation"
were looking at the end of their football te
nure on the Farm.
"This last game is hard to talk about," said
graduating quarterback Steve Dils. "I'm not
usually real emotional, but for this game I
could hardly keep from crying. I just can't
describe the feeling. . .
The emotion is intangible, nearly inexpres
sible. But it was there Saturday when the
Cards on the field brought the Cards in the
stands to their feet time and time again.
Enthusiasm marked the crowd's reaction to
the No. 1 passer in the nation; disappoint
ment surrounded the inability of senior
fullback Phil Francis to play his last Big Came
due to an injury. The victors'locker room was
also marked by contrary sentiments.
Above and beyond the others was the re
joicing of the victory. Secondarily, the rest of
the emotions emerged.
"This last game is hard," Cene Engle, of
fensive tackle, said. "It's been eight years of
my life. You dedicate yourself all year and it's
sad to see it end. But it's a great way to go out.
This is the closest team I've ever been on.
There is a brotherhood ... no dissension at
all."
Wide receiver Vince Mulroy, who had the
only TD he's scored since his sophomore
year snatched away by an offensive penalty
call, was similarly moved.
"That was the most emotional experience
I've ever been through," he said with in
credulity. "The camaraderie on this team is

incredible. The last two weeks this team has
really drawn together after all the ups and
downs.
"We wanted to kill them," Mulroy said
about whether the Cal game was really a big
game. "We had a feeling we're a lot better
than our record and we wanted to win con
vincingly to prove it to others."
Howabout the touchdown that was pirated
from Mulroy by "a stupid penalty?''
"I never had such a rush," he said. "With
the adrenalin and the crowd ... it was the
best feeling I've had in my life. I was disap
pointed when they called it back, but as long
as we came back and scored. . . ."
]ohn Pigott was one of the injured seniors
who, like Francis, didn't make it more than a
few plays into the game. Pigott suited up but
due to an ankle injury incurred against ASU
last week, was scheduled to limit his usual
load of defensive back play to punt returns.
"After two punts I took myself out," said
Pigott. "It was pretty sad but I didn't notice it
until I was taking off my pads at halftime. It
was great to win, but not playing, I felt empty
inside. All I did was watch ... I didn't really
make a contribution."
Apparently the 10 games for which he was
healthy had slipped his mind.
Punter Brad Fox, who punted for the first
time since mid-season may have wanted to
forget the rest of the season.
"I was just hoping to get a shot," said Fox,
who was pulled during the Washington game
due to performance difficulties. "I wasn't an
ticipating getting a chance to kick, but I was
hopingforit. I appreciated it. Forawhile I was
just going through the motions," Fox con
tinued, speaking about his personal disap
pointment in the season. "But it's just great
to be a part of the team. Emotionally, it's
something I'll always remember. Whether
we won or not, it was just great to be a part
of."
Offensive guard Jim Stephens was ecstatic
about the victory over the Bears and his part
in it."It
'"It felt good to go out big for Stanford," he
said joyfully. "Beating Cal is like capping off a
career after nine or 10 years. In 20 years, I can
look back and say we didn't lose a game to
Cal while I was here."
Perhaps Mulroy summed it up best. "That
was a sweet win," he said with a smile.
And undoubtedly, so is the unexpected gift
the Bowl folks gave to the seniors â€” one
more chance to play for the Cards.
