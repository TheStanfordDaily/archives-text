# Chaparral wins a laugher, 26-12; routs Pelican in first Humor Bowl
## 
### 
In the first ever "Humor
Bowl," the Stanford Chaparral
outwitted the Berkeley Pelican
26-12, relying on the double
offensive-defensive punch of
Steve "Dils" Adolph. On of
fense, Adolph connected on 25
of 32 passes, 20 to his fleet
footed split end Perry Vasquez
and five to the stalwart Cal de
fense.
Defensively, Adolph —
roaming from his outside
linebacker post — picked off
three passes, returning all of
them for touchdowns. The
Chaparral, never trailing in the
contest, scored its sole offen
sive touchdown in the waning
minutes on an option pass
from editor Bruce Handy to
former editor Ray "Savann"
Thomas, who scampered 36
yards for the clinching score.
Calling the plays for the
Chaparral was Geoff Baskir,
who, with the help of his Prog
rammable H-P 67, used
complex-variable analysis to
predict holes in the Pelican de
fense. "Throw it where they
ain't," he concluded.
Remarkably, Baskir was still
recuperating from a wedgie in
flicted by irate teammates at a
Thursday practice.
Another standout on the
Chappie squad was Mike
Reedy, whose 45-yard
touchdown catch was nullified
by a controversial call by the
referee — ironically a Cal stu
dent. The offensive line was
anchored by all-around jock

Jack Trumpbour, who used the
martial arts to stop onrushing
Cal linemen. The fierce pass
rush of Stanford's Jeff Caraventa
and Steve Cittings resulted in
four quarterback sacks, while
Marko Fong acounted for the
other two interceptions of Cal
passes.
With five minutes remain
ing, Cal was still not out of it,

cutting the Chaparral lead from
20-12 on a 42-yard scoring pass
from Mark "Abbie" Hoffman
to Tom Parker. Earlier in the
first half, Parker caught
another Hoffman bomb for a
37-yard touchdown. When
questioned by the media,
Hoffman summed up the Cal
picture:
"We didn't lose, we just ran

out of time."
The Chappie received the
award for this football classic
— a monkey wrench attached
to a plaque. A Cal fan among
the capacity crowd of 25
people showed the bitterness
of the rivalry, shouting:
"We'll get that damn mon
key wrench back next year, you
wusses."
