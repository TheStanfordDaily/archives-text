# Spikers sweep 3 straight; set for playoff with LBS
## 
### JEFF POWELL 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team as of last night is
alive again. Saturday night, in
their third game in as many
nights, the spikers took a
playoff game against the Uni
versity of Pacific to claim sole
possession of second place in
the Northern California Athle
tic Conference.
This means that the season,
although the schedule may
contradict, is not over yet as
the Cards will travel to Davis
Thursday night to battle Long
Beach State and determine the
eighth and final qualifier for
the Western regional.
To get this far, however, the
spikers had to drop both Cal
and Fresno State in must-win
situations — one loss and all
regional hopes were put to
bed.
The Cards sparkled. Both Cal
and Fresno State fell in three
straight. First, in the volleyball
edition of the Big Game, the
women knocked off Berkeley
16-14,15-7,15-10 and then the
next day Fresno State went
down just as hard 16-14,15-13,

15-7.
Stanford coach Fred Sturm
said, "The team as a whole
played very well. Both Liz
Hughes and Shawn Hoover
were impressive." But the key
to the weekend success lay in
the calloused hands of the out
side spikers as "Carol Meihaus
and Tammy Jernigan turned in
their finest performances of
the year," Sturm said.
Unaware of a playoff with
UOP, Stanford had apparently
concluded the season on a
pleasant note by thrashing Cal
and Fresno State.
But in light of the final two
victories, the spikers had tied
Pacific for second place in con
ference behind powerful San
Jose State.
So, to break the tie and with
the slim chance that a regional
berth might be available, the
teams met Saturday night in
the USF gym. Stanford con
tinued its undefeated skein
by ousting UOP, 15-5, 16-14,
15-6. At the time, the victory
was fine and dandy but it didn't
mean a darn thing. For all in
tents and purposes, Liz

Hughes, Shawn Hoover and
other seniors had seemingly
played their Stanford finale.
Then early Sunday evening
the regional committee
brought the Cards back to life.
Sturm was informed that the
spikers had, by virtue of the
playoff win, qualified to meet
Long Beach State Thursday
night for yet another playoff.
This time the winner will de
finitely advance — the region
al await the winner. The first
round will be held the very
next morning, also at Davis.
Long Beach State and Stan
ford have previously faced
each other twice this year. Early
in the season, Long Beach top
ped the Cardinals in three
games during the San Jose
State Tournament. The other
match was in the UCLA Invita
tional Tournament as the two
teams found themselves in the
same pool. They split two
games.
The story may have a diffe
rent script this time around.
Sturm said, "To lose, we'll have
to play poorly. If both teams
play well, we'll beat them."

Sturm said, "To lose, we'll have
to play poorly. If both teams
play well, we'll beat them."
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team as of last night is
alive again. Saturday night, in
their third game in as many
nights, the spikers took a
playoff game against the Uni
versity of Pacific to claim sole
possession of second place in
the Northern California Athle
tic Conference.
This means that the season,
although the schedule may
contradict, is not over yet as
the Cards will travel to Davis
Thursday night to battle Long
Beach State and determine the
eighth and final qualifier for
the Western regional.
To get this far, however, the
spikers had to drop both Cal
and Fresno State in must-win
situations — one loss and all
regional hopes were put to
bed.
The Cards sparkled. Both Cal
and Fresno State fell in three
straight. First, in the volleyball
edition of the Big Game, the
women knocked off Berkeley
16-14,15-7,15-10 and then the
next day Fresno State went
down just as hard 16-14,15-13,

15-7.
Stanford coach Fred Sturm
said, "The team as a whole
played very well. Both Liz
Hughes and Shawn Hoover
were impressive." But the key
to the weekend success lay in
the calloused hands of the out
side spikers as "Carol Meihaus
and Tammy Jernigan turned in
their finest performances of
the year," Sturm said.
Unaware of a playoff with
UOP, Stanford had apparently
concluded the season on a
pleasant note by thrashing Cal
and Fresno State.
But in light of the final two
victories, the spikers had tied
Pacific for second place in con
ference behind powerful San
Jose State.
So, to break the tie and with
the slim chance that a regional
berth might be available, the
teams met Saturday night in
the USF gym. Stanford con
tinued its undefeated skein
by ousting UOP, 15-5, 16-14,
15-6. At the time, the victory
was fine and dandy but it didn't
mean a darn thing. For all in
tents and purposes, Liz

Hughes, Shawn Hoover and
other seniors had seemingly
played their Stanford finale.
Then early Sunday evening
the regional committee
brought the Cards back to life.
Sturm was informed that the
spikers had, by virtue of the
playoff win, qualified to meet
Long Beach State Thursday
night for yet another playoff.
This time the winner will de
finitely advance — the region
al await the winner. The first
round will be held the very
next morning, also at Davis.
Long Beach State and Stan
ford have previously faced
each other twice this year. Early
in the season, Long Beach top
ped the Cardinals in three
games during the San Jose
State Tournament. The other
match was in the UCLA Invita
tional Tournament as the two
teams found themselves in the
same pool. They split two
games.
The story may have a diffe
rent script this time around.
