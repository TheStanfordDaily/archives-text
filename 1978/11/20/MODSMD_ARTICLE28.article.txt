# Women booters drub Cal; men receive regional berth
## 
### DEAN EYRE 
Berkeley — Stanford's soccer
teams both fared well in de
velopments over the last three
days. Just as the football team
was awaiting a bowl invitation,
the men's soccer team was
hoping to receive a berth in the
Far Western regional playoffs.
Friday at 11:30 a.m. it heard
the good news and will face the
second-rated team in the na
tion, USF, today at 1 p.m. at
Ulrich Field near the corner of
Golden Gate Avenue and
Masonic Avenue.
As for the women, they shut
out California 3-0 in their tradi
tional soccer Big Game preced
ing the football clash.
The Cardinals scored first
with a pass from Ellen Griep to
Lisa Steinkamp, who put the
ball in 10 minutes into the
game. Griep got her chance to
add a goal after she took in a
pass from Julie Zender 20 mi
nutes later. Stanford's final
goal came with about five mi
nutes remaining in the first half
as Cindy Shorney pressured a
Cal fullback into rushing a
pass back to the goalie, the ball
rolling into their goal.
"We played a rather unin
spired second half but that's
what happens when you're
ahead 3-0," women's coach
Phil Wright said. "Luckily our
defense was very strong. Our
offense is improving, it's com
ing. They're not reacting too
quickly to Cindy's passes
which is where most of our of
fense comes from."
Men's coach Nelson Lodge,
reacting to the NCAA news re
lease said, "All of a sudden
we're there — it's kind of scary.
I'm really excited from the
point of view that we get the
experience of playing in post

season competition and that
out of an estimated 130 teams
that were able to get in, we're
still considered a strong prog
ram."
"I think the most valuable
thing is that we're in and there
are the crowds, publicity and
stakes — a chance to strike at a
national title — anything can
happen," he added.
Not since 1962 has Stanford
fielded a team in the regional
playoffs, and the situation
arose this year when San Jose
State was eliminated from

among the four regional selec
tions because of ineligibility
problems.
"For 17 years Stanford was
never considered as a conten
der," Lodge said. "It's hard to
convince four people (the rat
ing committee) that we were
contenders. But now that
we're there, the difficult thing
is to do a good job — we don't
want to get blown away; they'll
(the committee) say they made
a mistake. It's not just winning,
but proving that we belong
there," he added.

nutes remaining in the first half
as Cindy Shorney pressured a
Cal fullback into rushing a
pass back to the goalie, the ball
rolling into their goal.
"We played a rather unin
spired second half but that's
what happens when you're
ahead 3-0," women's coach
Phil Wright said. "Luckily our
defense was very strong. Our
offense is improving, it's com
ing. They're not reacting too
quickly to Cindy's passes
which is where most of our of
fense comes from."
Men's coach Nelson Lodge,
reacting to the NCAA news re
lease said, "All of a sudden
we're there — it's kind of scary.
I'm really excited from the
point of view that we get the
experience of playing in post

season competition and that
out of an estimated 130 teams
that were able to get in, we're
still considered a strong prog
ram."
"I think the most valuable
thing is that we're in and there
are the crowds, publicity and
stakes — a chance to strike at a
national title — anything can
happen," he added.
Not since 1962 has Stanford
fielded a team in the regional
playoffs, and the situation
arose this year when San Jose
State was eliminated from

among the four regional selec
tions because of ineligibility
problems.
"For 17 years Stanford was
never considered as a conten
der," Lodge said. "It's hard to
convince four people (the rat
ing committee) that we were
contenders. But now that
we're there, the difficult thing
is to do a good job — we don't
want to get blown away; they'll
(the committee) say they made
a mistake. It's not just winning,
but proving that we belong
there," he added.

Berkeley — Stanford's soccer
teams both fared well in de
velopments over the last three
days. Just as the football team
was awaiting a bowl invitation,
the men's soccer team was
hoping to receive a berth in the
Far Western regional playoffs.
Friday at 11:30 a.m. it heard
the good news and will face the
second-rated team in the na
tion, USF, today at 1 p.m. at
Ulrich Field near the corner of
Golden Gate Avenue and
Masonic Avenue.
As for the women, they shut
out California 3-0 in their tradi
tional soccer Big Game preced
ing the football clash.
The Cardinals scored first
with a pass from Ellen Griep to
Lisa Steinkamp, who put the
ball in 10 minutes into the
game. Griep got her chance to
add a goal after she took in a
pass from Julie Zender 20 mi
nutes later. Stanford's final
goal came with about five mi
nutes remaining in the first half
as Cindy Shorney pressured a
Cal fullback into rushing a
pass back to the goalie, the ball
rolling into their goal.
