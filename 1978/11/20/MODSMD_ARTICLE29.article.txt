California's Carlos Stef
fens scored five goals and
Mike loughlin added three
more as the Golden Bears
defeated Stanford's previ
ously unbeaten water polo
team Saturday, 11-9, before
an overflow crowd at Ber
keley's Harmon Pool.
The game, which held
minimal importance for the

Cards, was a must-win for
Cal. The victory secured the
Bears a berth in the NCAA
championships this
weekend in Long Beach.
From the opening sprint,
control of the game clearly
belonged to Cal. The Bears
scored the first goal in the
game and Stanford was
forced to play catch-up the
entire game. They never

caught up. The closest the
Cards came to tying the
score was just before
halftime when they charged
to within one goal at 6-5.
Despite the loss, Stan
ford's 7-1 Pacific-10 record
earned them first place over
Cal (6-2). The Cards finished
the fall season with a 23-1-1
overall mark.
Stanford coach Dante De

ttamanti said he wasn't too
concerned about Saturday's
loss.
"I don't think it's going to
hurt us going into the na
tionals," he said. "Since the
USC game (when Stanford
clinched a berth in the na
tionals), we haven't played
up to our full potential.
Everybody's played hard —
there's been a lot of inten
sity — but you could tell
there was something lack
ing."
Dettamanti said, how
ever, that he felt Cal played
up to their potential in both
Saturday's game and last
week's loss to the Cards at
deCuerre.
"I really think that we're
the better team," he said.
The 35-year-old coach
said he thought his team
played very well in Cal's
pool considering its small
size.
"We expect to get two or
three goals per game from
our counter-attack, but in
that pool you just can't do
that," he said.
"We lost the game simply
because we allowed too

many goals," explained De
ttamanti. "We expect to
score nine or 10 goals per
game, but we can't give Cal
11 and expect to win."
According to Dettamanti,
the first thing that breaks
down when a team has al
ready assured itself of an
NCAA berth is the defense.
"We played a 'let John
(Gansel, goalie) do it' kind
of defense," Dettamanti
said of Saturday's perfor
mance.
And for much of the
game, particularly the sec
ond half, Gansel did do it.
The sophomore goalie
chalked up 13 saves in the
game, many of them with no
one between him and the
shooter.
Cal used a successful of
fensive attack that the Cards
had trouble adjusting to,
Dettamanti said. The Bears
patiently worked to get
Stanford players ejected for
committing three fouls on
the hole man. Although the
Cards were able to switch
off defensively and avoid
many ejections, the
switches were sometimes

too slow and the Bears were
able to capitalize by getting
a man open for a shot.
"Ninety percent of the
time we made good
switches," Dettamanti said,
"but that other 10 percent of
the time they scored on us."
Dettamanti said the smal
ler pool gave Cal a longer
time to run theiroffense be
cause less time was needed
to move the ball down the
pool.
"In a big pool, it (the
three-foul offense) is not
going to be as effective be
cause they're not going to
have the time to do it,"he
said.
Seniors Robby Arnold
and Tom Angelo and
freshman Alan Mouchawar
each scored two goals for
the Cards. Mouchawar,
who has made a habit of
playing good games against
Cal this year, also made two
steals and played what De
ttamanti termed "his best
game — offensively and de
fensively."
"I don't like Cal,"
Mouchawar said. "They're
one team I want to beat."

Mouchawar, who was in
serted into the game early in
the first quarter after Arnold
was called for two quick
ejection fouls, said he plays
a lot better when he is put
into the game at the begin
ning of a quarter.
"I feel like I'm much more
into the game," he said.
Dettamanti also praised
senior Dave Egan for his
performance in the game.
"He went in and did a real
good job," Dettamanti said.
Stanford will be seeded
first in the nationals and will
play Air Force in the first
round this Saturday at Bel
mont Plaza in Long Beach.
Cal has been seeded third
behind UC-lrvine and Pep
perdine is the fourth-seed.
Dettamanti said he is very
optimistic about the nation
als.
The team had a good at
titude after the game, he
said. "I think they're ready
to play."
The Cal game "could have
been a blessing in dis
guise," said Mouchawar.
"We'll be even more
psyched now."
