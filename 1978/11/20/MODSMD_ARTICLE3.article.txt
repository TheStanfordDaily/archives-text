# University may have given NIH false information in Lucas case
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
A confidential University committee report
shows that Stanford officials may have given false
information to the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) during an investigation of possible fraudu
lent research here.
The report, dated October 2,1975, discusses the
1973 charges of scientific impropriety brought
against Dr. Zolton Lucas, associate professor of
surgery at the Medical School. Because Lucas was
conducting his research under a University
received federal grant, NIH began investigating
thdse charges in 1975.
The report states that although the committee
did not resolve "the question of fabrication and
fraud," committee members "maintain deep con
cern that some of the work may in fact have been
fraudulent."
However, University officials told NIH that the
committee "had concluded that Dr. Lucas was not
guilty of fallacious research reporting but perhaps
was derelict in not maintaining good laboratory
administration," according to NIH Director

Donald Fredrickson.
Fredrickson made this statement in a July 1977
letter to the U.S. Senate subcommittee on health
and scientific research.
In this letter, Fredrickson also said lohn
Schwartz, then counsel for the Medical Center
and now University counsel, told NIH on May 26,
1976 that the committee had not completed its
review.
Vet the 1975 committee report was the only one
submitted to University officials, Physiology Prof.
George Feigen, committee chairman, confirmed
yesterday.
He added that committee members did meet
again after the report was filed when the Surgery
Department chairman asked for additional infor
mation.
"However, we decided it was beyond the
capabilities of the committee to supply additional
information," Feigen said. "So only one report
was ever filed."
Schwartz was out of town this weekend and
unavailable for comment.
President Richard Lyman declined to comment

until he has contacted Schwartz.
Lucas is suspected of inaccurately pooling data,
changing data and making misleading revisions in
a rejected manuscript.
The committee report summarized that Lucas'
research contained "numerous errors" and
"therefore does not meet the standards which are
appropriate for a scientific research and publica
tion."
"Such inattention to accuracy and care in record
maintenance and publication is especially inap
propriate in a University setting where future sci
entists are being educated," the report adds.
The committee suggested a reprimand for Lucas
both because of his conduct and "to reduce the
likelihood that such practices are continued in his
laboratory."
It also recommends that a formal hearing be
held by the University to determine the unsolved
questions of Lucas' motives.
"To my knowledge, no such hearing was ever
held," Feigen said. "Officials said there was no
mechanism for such a hearing,"
Lucas is on sabbatical leave this quarter.
