Israel rejects treaty alterations
Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin, after running a gauntlet of angry israelis and
being hit by an egg, told a political meeting yester
day that Israel rejects inclusion of timetables for
solving the Palestinian question in a peace treaty
with Egypt.
Palestinian guerrillas struck a new blow yester
day in their war of terror against Israel. A bomb
exploded on a bus packed with Israelis and
tourists in the occupied West Bank 10 miles east of
Jerusalem, and hospitals reported four persons
were killed and 37 were wounded. No Americans
were reported among the casualties.
In Beirut, the Palestinian guerrilla group Fatah
claimed responsibility.
Begin said Israel was ready to sign the treaty
draft as it existed Nov. 11, meaning one without a
timetable, but that fcgypt had added "unaccepta
ble" demands at that time — the call for such a
timetable.
Many settlers in the Sinai are incensed over the
government's willingness to return the peninsula
back to the Egyptians, and settlers on the West
Bank fear an Egyptian-Israeli treaty will be a pre
lude to Israeli withdrawal from that occupied
zone.
World growth rate is declining
Washington — For the first time, the population
growth rate of the world has reversed and is de
clining, population experts say.
But they say the actual number of people being
added to the world is still increasing and that zero
growth rate will not be reached until between the
years 2020 and 2025.
A U.S. Census Bureau report released yesterday
shows the world growth rate was 1.9 percent in

1976 compared to 2 percent a decade earlier.
The total population increased from 3.5 billion
in mid-1967 to an estimated 4.3 billion in mid-1977,
the report says.
The new report shows that in almost half of the
world's most crowded countries, the growth rate
declined in the last 10 years.
Demographers say there is no pat explanation
why the growth rate has reversed.
"No one knows the real reason," said spokes
man Tarzie Vittachi. "But there are various gues
ses: population and family planning has begun to
take; there is increased literacy; the improved
status of women; and the rise in the average age of
marriage. It may be one or a combination of these
factors."
The United States had a growth rate of 0.8 per
cent between 1976 and 1977, compared with 1.1
percent a decade earlier, the report shows.
Fire is method of British suicides
London — Nine persons have died in a wave of
macabre "human torch" suicides in Britain during
the past seven weeks, and baffled British psychiat
rists say the only link seems to be a desire to
immitate other self-immolators.
The latest apparent suicide attempt occurred
Saturday when 26-year-old typist Valerie
Donoghue of the resort town of Brighton set her
self ablaze with gasoline in her bathroom. She was
reported in critical condition.
Why the victims choose to douse themselves in
kerosene or some other flammable liquid and
then deliberately set themselves on fire has
stumped investigators.
Newspaper and television reports have played
up accounts of the screaming death throes of the
burning victims, so that no potential victim would
think that it is a quick and painless way to die.

One theory psychiatrists offer is that the victims
were imitating the flaming suicide of Australian
heriess Lynette Phillips, whose death in Geneva on
Oct. 2 was widely reported in Britain.
Job inequalities still present
Washington — A white man who dropped out of
high school makes more money on the average
than a white woman with a college degree, accord
ing to Labor Department figures.
That is one of the findings in a new report on
employment prospects of professional women
and minorities.
The report's conclusion: "Things aren't going
nearly as well as one would have thought 10 years
ago," when the federal government had just
begun to commit itself to equal employment op
portunity and affirmative action for minorities and
women, says Betty Vetter, co-author of the report.
The study found women and minorities have
made dramatic gains the past decade in acquiring
the education required for a professional career.
But opportunities for employment, advancement
and good pay — particularly for women — have
increased very little. In many cases, job inequities
between men and women have widened, the re
port says.
Vetter said Labor Department data revealed that
white men who had dropped out of high school
earned an average of $9379 in 1976, while white
women with college degrees averaged $7176.
Today's weather
Rain at times through today. Showers likely to
night and tomorrow. Continued cool. Lows in the
mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the mid 50s today and
low 50s tomorrow. Chance of rain 80 percent today
and 70 percent tomorrow night.

immitate other self-immolators.
The latest apparent suicide attempt occurred
Saturday when 26-year-old typist Valerie
Donoghue of the resort town of Brighton set her
self ablaze with gasoline in her bathroom. She was
reported in critical condition.
Why the victims choose to douse themselves in
kerosene or some other flammable liquid and
then deliberately set themselves on fire has
stumped investigators.
Newspaper and television reports have played
up accounts of the screaming death throes of the
burning victims, so that no potential victim would
think that it is a quick and painless way to die.

One theory psychiatrists offer is that the victims
were imitating the flaming suicide of Australian
heriess Lynette Phillips, whose death in Geneva on
Oct. 2 was widely reported in Britain.
Job inequalities still present
Washington — A white man who dropped out of
high school makes more money on the average
than a white woman with a college degree, accord
ing to Labor Department figures.
That is one of the findings in a new report on
employment prospects of professional women
and minorities.
The report's conclusion: "Things aren't going
nearly as well as one would have thought 10 years
ago," when the federal government had just
begun to commit itself to equal employment op
portunity and affirmative action for minorities and
women, says Betty Vetter, co-author of the report.
The study found women and minorities have
made dramatic gains the past decade in acquiring
the education required for a professional career.
But opportunities for employment, advancement
and good pay — particularly for women — have
increased very little. In many cases, job inequities
between men and women have widened, the re
port says.
Vetter said Labor Department data revealed that
white men who had dropped out of high school
earned an average of $9379 in 1976, while white
women with college degrees averaged $7176.
Today's weather
Rain at times through today. Showers likely to
night and tomorrow. Continued cool. Lows in the
mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the mid 50s today and
low 50s tomorrow. Chance of rain 80 percent today
and 70 percent tomorrow night.
Israel rejects treaty alterations
Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin, after running a gauntlet of angry israelis and
being hit by an egg, told a political meeting yester
day that Israel rejects inclusion of timetables for
solving the Palestinian question in a peace treaty
with Egypt.
Palestinian guerrillas struck a new blow yester
day in their war of terror against Israel. A bomb
exploded on a bus packed with Israelis and
tourists in the occupied West Bank 10 miles east of
Jerusalem, and hospitals reported four persons
were killed and 37 were wounded. No Americans
were reported among the casualties.
In Beirut, the Palestinian guerrilla group Fatah
claimed responsibility.
Begin said Israel was ready to sign the treaty
draft as it existed Nov. 11, meaning one without a
timetable, but that fcgypt had added "unaccepta
ble" demands at that time — the call for such a
timetable.
Many settlers in the Sinai are incensed over the
government's willingness to return the peninsula
back to the Egyptians, and settlers on the West
Bank fear an Egyptian-Israeli treaty will be a pre
lude to Israeli withdrawal from that occupied
zone.
World growth rate is declining
Washington — For the first time, the population
growth rate of the world has reversed and is de
clining, population experts say.
But they say the actual number of people being
added to the world is still increasing and that zero
growth rate will not be reached until between the
years 2020 and 2025.
A U.S. Census Bureau report released yesterday
shows the world growth rate was 1.9 percent in

1976 compared to 2 percent a decade earlier.
The total population increased from 3.5 billion
in mid-1967 to an estimated 4.3 billion in mid-1977,
the report says.
The new report shows that in almost half of the
world's most crowded countries, the growth rate
declined in the last 10 years.
Demographers say there is no pat explanation
why the growth rate has reversed.
"No one knows the real reason," said spokes
man Tarzie Vittachi. "But there are various gues
ses: population and family planning has begun to
take; there is increased literacy; the improved
status of women; and the rise in the average age of
marriage. It may be one or a combination of these
factors."
The United States had a growth rate of 0.8 per
cent between 1976 and 1977, compared with 1.1
percent a decade earlier, the report shows.
Fire is method of British suicides
