# George finds Carter's policy 'disappointing'

Although he declined to "grade"
President Jimmy Carter's conduct of
foreign policy, Political Science Prof.
Alexander Ceorge called it "disap
pointing" in a speech to World Af
fairs Council last week in Palo Alto.
George, Graham H. Stuart profes
sor of international relations here,
faulted Carter's policy for its frag
mentation and lack of feasibility.
"It's a grab bag of individual
policies that often contradict each
other," George said. Limiting con
ventional arms sales to Third World
countries, for example, conflicts
with the administration's policy of
supporting staunchly anti
communist allies such as Iran, he
said.
George said Carter has created
confusion both at home and abroad
by failing to draw new individual
policies into a desirable overall
world-view. Ratification of the
Panama Canal treaty was "too close
for comfort" because Carter failed to

explain the rationale of improving
North-South relations to the Ameri
can public, according to George.
George said one cannot separate
idealistic goals from traditional
power politics. Feasibility must
temper ideals, said George.
"We don't pay our president to
solve all our problems," George
said, "but to manage our contradic
tions." The executive's function is to
integrate and choose among com
peting goals, according to George.
Carter, unfortunately, has shown
no "strategic sense" of foreign pol
icy, according to George. Although
Carter used necessary bargaining,
persuasion and "political wooing"
adeptly to gain the presidency, he
seems to find them distasteful in per
forming the job, George said.
He conceded that Carter inherited
difficult problems from the Nixon
and Ford administrations, such as the
"shambles of detente" and the
psychological and political hangover
from Vietnam.

He praised Carter's fresh ap
proach, crediting him with restoring
the confidence of the American pub
lic in the "moral purpose of Ameri
can foreign policy."
Carter's foreign policy is much
more open, George said. "At least
we have given up efforts to assassi
nate leaders of other countries,"
George explained.
But George blamed some of Car
ter's difficulties on his "evangelical
approach," because it reinforces his
belief that "all good things are possi
ble."
George also criticized Carter's
tendency to seek comprehensive
solutions to each problem without
considering the implications for
domestic or international politics.
Although this may have worked
with the Camp David summit,
George said that Camp David was a
"very special case."
More otten, he said, Carter's
policies have been unsuccessful. His
emphasis on human rights and his

radical proposal for arms reductions
pushed Soviet-American relations to
the crisis point, George said.
Carter then compounded the
problem by backtracking when
things went .wrong which, according
to George, damaged his reputation
as a leader. This "failure of leader
ship" enhances the role of special
interest groups at home.
Carter must consider what is desir
able and what is feasible and then
pursue these objectives in a more
discriminating and sophisticated
way, George said.
George cited Carter's African pol
icy as a good example of such sophis
tication. "I give him high marks for
putting this country on the right side
of history for a change. We're not
backing losers" in Africa, he said. By
not overreacting to the Soviet threat
and counting on the Africans them
selves to protect their national in
terests, Americans are conveying
greater credibility to African leaders,
he said.

Alexander Ceorge called it "disap
pointing" in a speech to World Af
fairs Council last week in Palo Alto.
George, Graham H. Stuart profes
sor of international relations here,
faulted Carter's policy for its frag
mentation and lack of feasibility.
"It's a grab bag of individual
policies that often contradict each
other," George said. Limiting con
ventional arms sales to Third World
countries, for example, conflicts
with the administration's policy of
supporting staunchly anti
communist allies such as Iran, he
said.
George said Carter has created
confusion both at home and abroad
by failing to draw new individual
policies into a desirable overall
world-view. Ratification of the
Panama Canal treaty was "too close
for comfort" because Carter failed to

explain the rationale of improving
North-South relations to the Ameri
can public, according to George.
George said one cannot separate
idealistic goals from traditional
power politics. Feasibility must
temper ideals, said George.
"We don't pay our president to
solve all our problems," George
said, "but to manage our contradic
tions." The executive's function is to
integrate and choose among com
peting goals, according to George.
Carter, unfortunately, has shown
no "strategic sense" of foreign pol
icy, according to George. Although
Carter used necessary bargaining,
persuasion and "political wooing"
adeptly to gain the presidency, he
seems to find them distasteful in per
forming the job, George said.
He conceded that Carter inherited
difficult problems from the Nixon
and Ford administrations, such as the
"shambles of detente" and the
psychological and political hangover
from Vietnam.

He praised Carter's fresh ap
proach, crediting him with restoring
the confidence of the American pub
lic in the "moral purpose of Ameri
can foreign policy."
Carter's foreign policy is much
more open, George said. "At least
we have given up efforts to assassi
nate leaders of other countries,"
George explained.
But George blamed some of Car
ter's difficulties on his "evangelical
approach," because it reinforces his
belief that "all good things are possi
ble."
George also criticized Carter's
tendency to seek comprehensive
solutions to each problem without
considering the implications for
domestic or international politics.
Although this may have worked
with the Camp David summit,
George said that Camp David was a
"very special case."
More otten, he said, Carter's
policies have been unsuccessful. His
emphasis on human rights and his

radical proposal for arms reductions
pushed Soviet-American relations to
the crisis point, George said.
Carter then compounded the
problem by backtracking when
things went .wrong which, according
to George, damaged his reputation
as a leader. This "failure of leader
ship" enhances the role of special
interest groups at home.
Carter must consider what is desir
able and what is feasible and then
pursue these objectives in a more
discriminating and sophisticated
way, George said.
George cited Carter's African pol
icy as a good example of such sophis
tication. "I give him high marks for
putting this country on the right side
of history for a change. We're not
backing losers" in Africa, he said. By
not overreacting to the Soviet threat
and counting on the Africans them
selves to protect their national in
terests, Americans are conveying
greater credibility to African leaders,
he said.
Although he declined to "grade"
President Jimmy Carter's conduct of
foreign policy, Political Science Prof.
Alexander Ceorge called it "disap
