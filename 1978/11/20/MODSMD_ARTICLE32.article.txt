The Iranian student rally pictured
in Friday's Daily was incorrectly iden
tified as being sponsored by the Re
volutionary Communist Youth
Brigade. The rally was actually spon
sored by the Iranian Students Cul
tural Association.
Also, Faryl Reingold, office assis
tant at the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion, was misquoted in Friday's "Bug
Me" column. The quote should have
stated that information about salaries
of alumni "has to be kept confiden
tial in order to protect the alums,"
which does not necessarily imply
that the association has such infor
mation.
The Daily regrets the errors.
