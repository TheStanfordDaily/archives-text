# $BOA urges withdrawal of funds

### RACHEL BAGBY 
A "day of action against apartheid"
was held last Friday by the California
branch of Stop Banking on Apartheid
($BOA), a worldwide coalition of or
ganizations campaigning to stop
American bank loans to South Africa.
$BOA, Campaign for Economic
Democracy (CED) and South Africa
Catalyst Project members distributed
leaflets at 500 branches of the Bank of
America urging bank customers to
withdraw their money from the bank
until it stops making loans to South
Africa.
Bank of America has loan com
mitments of approximately $200 mill
ion to organizations in South Africa,
said Ray Toman, information officer
at the bank's international banking
office in San Francisco.
While the majority of these com

mitments are to private South African
companies and American companies
doing business in South Africa, a li
mited number are to government
owned agencies, Toman said. He ar
gued that none of these loans should
be construed as evidence of the
bank's support of apartheid.
"We abhor the apartheid policy
and in no way endorse the political
policy of South Africa," Toman said.
"Our determinations of loans are
based solely on economic considera
tions."
Arguments 'simplistic'
But $BOA said this argument is a
"simplistic smokescreen." "Politics
and economics are inseparable,"
said leaflet distributor Mignon
McCarthy. "Economic support ena
bles the (South African) regime to
exist."

$BOA contends that "when U.S.
banks announce 'no credit for apar
theid' South Africa's determination
to maintain racist policies and minor
ity rule wil be weakened." However,
Toman said the bank "does not think
that isolation of South Africa by
banks will serve the purposes that
the protesters seek to accomplish."
Basing his opinion on articles in
Fortune magazine, the Los Angeles
Times and other publications,
Toman said, "We belive that with
drawal of American activity in South
Africa will probably do more to harm
the black majority than continued
U.S. presence there. American com
panies there can exert an influence
that works toward getting the gov
ernment to change its racial
policies."
$BOA disagreed with Toman. Ac

cording to $BOA, "It is impossible
for U.S. corporations to help effect
significant reforms within the pre
sent laws of South Africa." Addition
ally, the bank's argument does not
address or justify lending money to
the South African companies and
government, an SBOA leaflet dis
tributor said.
"We're targeting the Bank of
America because they have more
depositors than any other financial
institution in California," McCarthy
said. "Leafletting them can have an
impact because they're worried
about their image."
SBOA conducted a smaller leaflet
ting campaign against Bank of
America last June. "A lot of the
people working with us now are
people who received leaflets then,"
