# 300-400 found dead in Guyana jungle camp
## 
### 
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — In
formation Minister Shirley Field Rid
ley reported about 300 to 400 bodies
— and no one alive — had been
found in the Guyana jungle camp of a
California sect whose members kil
led five investigating Americans in
cluding Rep. Leo Ryan of California
and three newsmen.
Ridley told The Associated Press
the bodies were found by troops
who invaded the Jonestown camp, in
northwest Guyana, of the Peoples'
Tta.ple led by the Rev. Jim Jones.
The minister said she heard re
ports there had been a mass suicide
by poison at the camp, and that she
had heard nothing to discount these
reports.
About 1100 persons, all of them
Americans, had been reported living
in the camp. There was no indication
what might have happened to the
others.
In Washington, the State Depart
ment said the U.S. Embassy in
Georgetown reported local police

officials told it:"It appears as if as
many as 400 members of the Jones
town People's Temple community
may be dead."
Stephen Katzaris, a Potter Valley,
Calif., psychologist who accom
panied Ryan to Guyana in a futile at
tempt to get his daughter out of
Jonestown, said the inmates of the
camp had had mass suicide rehear
sals and signed undated suicide
notes before they left California for
Guyana.
They will ali be dead by tomor
row," said Katzaris, whose son An
thony, 23, was critically wounded in
the attack in which Ryan was killed.
Survivors of the attack Saturday
evening said the congressman and
the others were slain with shotgun
blasts fired from "inches away" by
members of the sect.
Ryan (D-Calif.) had gone to the
camp in this small South American
country to investigate reports of
abuses of members of the sect.
Shooting erupted as he tried to take
several disenchanted sect members
back to Georgetown by plane. Wit
nesses said a man with a knife had
threatened Ryan earlier in Jones
town.
The State Department identified
four of the dead as the 53-year-old
Ryan; reporter Don Harris, 42, and
cameraman Robert Brown, 36, both
of NBC News and both Los Angeles
residents, and photographer Greg

ory Robinson, 27, of the San Fran
cisco Examiner newspaper.
The identity of the fifth victim was
withheld pending notification of re
latives, but Guyanese sources said
she was an 18-year-old American
woman from the settlement who ap
parently was trying to leave with
Ryan.
Injured
The U.S. Embassy identified the
seriously injured as Jackie Speier,
Ryan's administrative assistant;
Steve Sung, 34, of Pasadena, Calif.,
who is a sound man for NBC, and
Anthony Katsoria, Carolyn Bt>yd and
Beverly Oliver. The embassy iden
tified the last three as concerned sect
members' relatives who accom
panied the Ryan party.
According to Robert Flick, an NBC
News field producer with the crew,
there were from eight to 12 gunmen,
both black and white. They appa
rently had acted as Ryan's guides and
became enraged and started shoot
ing when they saw some sect mem
bers try to leave with him. He said
from 50 to 75 shots were fired.
Flick said Guyanese troops ar
rested nine suspects. The govern
ment, through a spokesman in New
York, Jack Gelinas, confirmed one
arrest. He named the suspect as Larry
John Leyton and said he was an
American whose age and hometown
were not known.
Saturday was the latest and most
gruesome incident in a 20-year saga
of intrigue and controversy sur
rounding the People's Temple and its
founder, the Rev. Jim Jones.
Conceived in Indianapolis, Ind., in
the 1950s with the avowed purpose
of breaking down class distinctions,
the Temple moved to Redwood Val
ley, Calif., in the late 1960s and then
here in 1971.
A sophisticated political man
ipulator, Jones became a potent
force in San Francisco almost over
night, organizing some 5000 Temple
members who worshipped in his
church each Sunday into a taskforce
of workers for a host of liberal politi
cal campaigns.
Ryan's party was ambushed as he
tried to escort a half dozen or more
People's Temple settlers from the
sect's agricultural project back to
Georgetown, Guyana's capital." Most
sect members are Californians, and
there have been repeated allegations
that the sect was abusing some of its
adherents.
Bodies remain
The ambush occurred at a remote
airstrip at Port Kaituma, eight miles
south of the settlement, and the
bodies of the dead remained there.
The U.S. State Department has
asked Guyana to waive a law requir
ing autopsies on murder victims and
to return immediately the bodies of
Rep. Leo Ryan and four others killed
on a Port Kaituma airstrip, a Ryan
family spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman, George Corey,
characterized the situation as "a con
siderable hitch," that grew out of a
Guyana government law that a body
killed in a crime must be autopsied.
"The State Department is now
working for the release of those
bodies without the normal require
ment of autopsies," Corey said.
During negotiations, he said, the
bodies of Ryan and the other victims
of the Saturday ambush were being
kept in a C 124 transport plane parked
on a ramp at the Georgetown airport.
Violence denounced
A man who identified himself as
Archie James emerged from the San
Francisco People's Temple before
noon yesterday and said sect mem
bers "denounce the violence that
has taken place at the Port Kaituma
airstrip near Jonestown."
James continued, "We are nonvio
lent people. The Rev. Jim Jones has
always deplored violence and what
ever the circumstances of the airstrip
incident, it is not the kind of action
anyone within the Temple would
ever precipitate.
FBI alerted
The State Department said mem
bers of the People's Temple, which
claims about 20,000 followers in
California, had previously men
tioned the possibility of suicide if

they felt the sect was threatened. The
FBI in California was alerted, the de
partment said.
A Guyanese military plane brought
the wounded back to Georgetown,
where a U.S. Air Force C-141 trans
port plane picked them up. The
plane made a stop at Roosevelt Roads
Naval Base in Puerto Rico and then
left for Andrews Air Force Base, out
side Washington.
Unaccounted for after the shoot
ing were a representative of the
Guyanan Information Minisrtry and
four relatives of settlers from the
colony. They were not on the
Guyanese list of dead or wounded.
The whereabouts of the remaining
refugees from the camp was not
known.

Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — In

The minister said she heard re

About 1100 persons, all of them
Americans, had been reported living

of workers for a host of liberal politi
cal campaigns.
Ryan's party was ambushed as he
tried to escort a half dozen or more
People's Temple settlers from the
sect's agricultural project back to
Georgetown, Guyana's capital." Most
sect members are Californians, and
there have been repeated allegations
that the sect was abusing some of its
adherents.
Bodies remain
The ambush occurred at a remote
airstrip at Port Kaituma, eight miles
south of the settlement, and the
bodies of the dead remained there.
The U.S. State Department has
asked Guyana to waive a law requir
ing autopsies on murder victims and
to return immediately the bodies of
Rep. Leo Ryan and four others killed
on a Port Kaituma airstrip, a Ryan
family spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman, George Corey,
characterized the situation as "a con
siderable hitch," that grew out of a
Guyana government law that a body
killed in a crime must be autopsied.
"The State Department is now
working for the release of those
bodies without the normal require
ment of autopsies," Corey said.
During negotiations, he said, the
bodies of Ryan and the other victims
of the Saturday ambush were being
kept in a C 124 transport plane parked
on a ramp at the Georgetown airport.
Violence denounced
A man who identified himself as
Archie James emerged from the San
Francisco People's Temple before
noon yesterday and said sect mem
bers "denounce the violence that
has taken place at the Port Kaituma
airstrip near Jonestown."
James continued, "We are nonvio
lent people. The Rev. Jim Jones has
always deplored violence and what
ever the circumstances of the airstrip
incident, it is not the kind of action
anyone within the Temple would
ever precipitate.
FBI alerted
The State Department said mem
bers of the People's Temple, which
claims about 20,000 followers in
California, had previously men
tioned the possibility of suicide if

they felt the sect was threatened. The
FBI in California was alerted, the de
partment said.
A Guyanese military plane brought
the wounded back to Georgetown,
where a U.S. Air Force C-141 trans
port plane picked them up. The
plane made a stop at Roosevelt Roads
Naval Base in Puerto Rico and then
left for Andrews Air Force Base, out
side Washington.
Unaccounted for after the shoot
ing were a representative of the
Guyanan Information Minisrtry and
four relatives of settlers from the
colony. They were not on the
Guyanese list of dead or wounded.
The whereabouts of the remaining
refugees from the camp was not
known.
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — In
formation Minister Shirley Field Rid
ley reported about 300 to 400 bodies
— and no one alive — had been
found in the Guyana jungle camp of a
California sect whose members kil
led five investigating Americans in
cluding Rep. Leo Ryan of California
and three newsmen.
Ridley told The Associated Press
the bodies were found by troops
who invaded the Jonestown camp, in
northwest Guyana, of the Peoples'
Tta.ple led by the Rev. Jim Jones.
The minister said she heard re
ports there had been a mass suicide
by poison at the camp, and that she
had heard nothing to discount these
reports.
About 1100 persons, all of them
Americans, had been reported living
in the camp. There was no indication
what might have happened to the
others.
In Washington, the State Depart
ment said the U.S. Embassy in
Georgetown reported local police

officials told it:"It appears as if as
many as 400 members of the Jones
town People's Temple community
may be dead."
Stephen Katzaris, a Potter Valley,
Calif., psychologist who accom
panied Ryan to Guyana in a futile at
tempt to get his daughter out of
Jonestown, said the inmates of the
camp had had mass suicide rehear
sals and signed undated suicide
notes before they left California for
Guyana.
They will ali be dead by tomor
row," said Katzaris, whose son An
thony, 23, was critically wounded in
the attack in which Ryan was killed.
Survivors of the attack Saturday
evening said the congressman and
the others were slain with shotgun
blasts fired from "inches away" by
members of the sect.
Ryan (D-Calif.) had gone to the
camp in this small South American
country to investigate reports of
abuses of members of the sect.
Shooting erupted as he tried to take
several disenchanted sect members
back to Georgetown by plane. Wit
nesses said a man with a knife had
threatened Ryan earlier in Jones
town.
The State Department identified
four of the dead as the 53-year-old
Ryan; reporter Don Harris, 42, and
cameraman Robert Brown, 36, both
of NBC News and both Los Angeles
residents, and photographer Greg

ory Robinson, 27, of the San Fran
cisco Examiner newspaper.
The identity of the fifth victim was
withheld pending notification of re
latives, but Guyanese sources said
she was an 18-year-old American
woman from the settlement who ap
parently was trying to leave with
Ryan.
Injured
The U.S. Embassy identified the
seriously injured as Jackie Speier,
Ryan's administrative assistant;
Steve Sung, 34, of Pasadena, Calif.,
who is a sound man for NBC, and
Anthony Katsoria, Carolyn Bt>yd and
Beverly Oliver. The embassy iden
tified the last three as concerned sect
members' relatives who accom
panied the Ryan party.
According to Robert Flick, an NBC
News field producer with the crew,
there were from eight to 12 gunmen,
both black and white. They appa
rently had acted as Ryan's guides and
became enraged and started shoot
ing when they saw some sect mem
bers try to leave with him. He said
from 50 to 75 shots were fired.
Flick said Guyanese troops ar
rested nine suspects. The govern
ment, through a spokesman in New
York, Jack Gelinas, confirmed one
arrest. He named the suspect as Larry
John Leyton and said he was an
American whose age and hometown
were not known.
Saturday was the latest and most
gruesome incident in a 20-year saga
of intrigue and controversy sur
rounding the People's Temple and its
founder, the Rev. Jim Jones.
Conceived in Indianapolis, Ind., in
the 1950s with the avowed purpose
of breaking down class distinctions,
the Temple moved to Redwood Val
ley, Calif., in the late 1960s and then
here in 1971.
A sophisticated political man
ipulator, Jones became a potent
force in San Francisco almost over
night, organizing some 5000 Temple
members who worshipped in his
church each Sunday into a taskforce
of workers for a host of liberal politi
cal campaigns.

the others were slain with shotgun
blasts fired from "inches away" by
members of the sect.
Ryan (D-Calif.) had gone to the
camp in this small South American
country to investigate reports of
abuses of members of the sect.
Shooting erupted as he tried to take
several disenchanted sect members
back to Georgetown by plane. Wit
nesses said a man with a knife had
threatened Ryan earlier in Jones
town.
The State Department identified
four of the dead as the 53-year-old
Ryan; reporter Don Harris, 42, and
cameraman Robert Brown, 36, both
of NBC News and both Los Angeles
residents, and photographer Greg

ory Robinson, 27, of the San Fran
cisco Examiner newspaper.
The identity of the fifth victim was
withheld pending notification of re
latives, but Guyanese sources said
she was an 18-year-old American
woman from the settlement who ap
parently was trying to leave with
Ryan.
Injured
The U.S. Embassy identified the
seriously injured as Jackie Speier,
Ryan's administrative assistant;
Steve Sung, 34, of Pasadena, Calif.,
who is a sound man for NBC, and
Anthony Katsoria, Carolyn Bt>yd and
Beverly Oliver. The embassy iden
tified the last three as concerned sect
members' relatives who accom
panied the Ryan party.
According to Robert Flick, an NBC
News field producer with the crew,
there were from eight to 12 gunmen,
both black and white. They appa
rently had acted as Ryan's guides and
became enraged and started shoot
ing when they saw some sect mem
bers try to leave with him. He said
from 50 to 75 shots were fired.
Flick said Guyanese troops ar
rested nine suspects. The govern
ment, through a spokesman in New
York, Jack Gelinas, confirmed one
arrest. He named the suspect as Larry
John Leyton and said he was an
American whose age and hometown
were not known.
Saturday was the latest and most
gruesome incident in a 20-year saga
of intrigue and controversy sur
rounding the People's Temple and its
founder, the Rev. Jim Jones.
Conceived in Indianapolis, Ind., in
the 1950s with the avowed purpose
of breaking down class distinctions,
the Temple moved to Redwood Val
ley, Calif., in the late 1960s and then
here in 1971.
A sophisticated political man
ipulator, Jones became a potent
force in San Francisco almost over
night, organizing some 5000 Temple
members who worshipped in his
church each Sunday into a taskforce
of workers for a host of liberal politi
cal campaigns.
Ryan's party was ambushed as he
tried to escort a half dozen or more
People's Temple settlers from the
sect's agricultural project back to
Georgetown, Guyana's capital." Most
sect members are Californians, and
there have been repeated allegations
that the sect was abusing some of its
adherents.
Bodies remain
The ambush occurred at a remote
airstrip at Port Kaituma, eight miles
south of the settlement, and the
bodies of the dead remained there.
The U.S. State Department has
asked Guyana to waive a law requir
ing autopsies on murder victims and
to return immediately the bodies of
Rep. Leo Ryan and four others killed
on a Port Kaituma airstrip, a Ryan
family spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman, George Corey,
characterized the situation as "a con
siderable hitch," that grew out of a
Guyana government law that a body
killed in a crime must be autopsied.
"The State Department is now
working for the release of those
bodies without the normal require
ment of autopsies," Corey said.
During negotiations, he said, the
bodies of Ryan and the other victims
of the Saturday ambush were being
kept in a C 124 transport plane parked
on a ramp at the Georgetown airport.
Violence denounced
A man who identified himself as
Archie James emerged from the San
Francisco People's Temple before
noon yesterday and said sect mem
bers "denounce the violence that
has taken place at the Port Kaituma
airstrip near Jonestown."
James continued, "We are nonvio
lent people. The Rev. Jim Jones has
always deplored violence and what
ever the circumstances of the airstrip
incident, it is not the kind of action
anyone within the Temple would
ever precipitate.
FBI alerted
The State Department said mem
bers of the People's Temple, which
claims about 20,000 followers in
California, had previously men
tioned the possibility of suicide if

they felt the sect was threatened. The
FBI in California was alerted, the de
partment said.
A Guyanese military plane brought
the wounded back to Georgetown,
where a U.S. Air Force C-141 trans
port plane picked them up. The
plane made a stop at Roosevelt Roads
Naval Base in Puerto Rico and then
left for Andrews Air Force Base, out
side Washington.
Unaccounted for after the shoot
ing were a representative of the
Guyanan Information Minisrtry and
four relatives of settlers from the
colony. They were not on the
Guyanese list of dead or wounded.
The whereabouts of the remaining
refugees from the camp was not
known.
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — In
formation Minister Shirley Field Rid
ley reported about 300 to 400 bodies
— and no one alive — had been
found in the Guyana jungle camp of a
California sect whose members kil
led five investigating Americans in
cluding Rep. Leo Ryan of California
and three newsmen.
Ridley told The Associated Press
the bodies were found by troops
who invaded the Jonestown camp, in
northwest Guyana, of the Peoples'
Tta.ple led by the Rev. Jim Jones.
The minister said she heard re
ports there had been a mass suicide
by poison at the camp, and that she
had heard nothing to discount these
reports.
About 1100 persons, all of them
Americans, had been reported living
in the camp. There was no indication
what might have happened to the
others.
In Washington, the State Depart
ment said the U.S. Embassy in
Georgetown reported local police

officials told it:"It appears as if as
many as 400 members of the Jones
town People's Temple community
may be dead."
Stephen Katzaris, a Potter Valley,
Calif., psychologist who accom
panied Ryan to Guyana in a futile at
tempt to get his daughter out of
Jonestown, said the inmates of the
camp had had mass suicide rehear
sals and signed undated suicide
notes before they left California for
Guyana.
They will ali be dead by tomor
row," said Katzaris, whose son An
thony, 23, was critically wounded in
the attack in which Ryan was killed.
