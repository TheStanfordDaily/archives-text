Fr Murphy was a Priest in a very poor parish
He asked for suggestions as to how he could
raise money So he went to a horse auction, but
made a very poor buy The horse turned out to be
a donkey
However, he thought that he might as well
entet the donkey in a race The donkey came in
3rd and the next morning the headlines in the
paper read FATHER MURPHY S ASS
SHOWS The Archbishop saw the paper and
was greatly displeased
The next day the donkey came in Ist and the
headlines read FATHER MURPHY'S ASS
OUT FRONT The Archbishop was up in arms
and figured something had to be done, because
Fr Murphy had entered the donkey and it had
come in 2nd The headlines read FR MUR
PHY S ASS BACK IN PLACE
The Archbishop thought this was too much, so
he forbade the priest to enter the donkey in the
next days race The headline then read AR
CHBISHOP SCRATCHES FR MURPHY S
ASS
Finally the Archbishop ordered Fr Murphy to get
rid of the donkey He was unable to sell it so he
gave it to Sister Agatha for a pet When the
Achbishop heard this he ordered Sister Agatha to
dispose of the animal at once
She then sold it for $10 The next day the
headline read SISTER AGATHA PEDDLES
HER ASS FOR TEN DOLLARS
They buried the Archbishop three days later!
