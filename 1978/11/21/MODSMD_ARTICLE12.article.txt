# Women learn self-defense techniques
## 
### LIBBY VERNON 
Exploring options for confronting rape
situations is the topic of Issues in Self-
Defense for Women, a SWOPSI course of
fered this fall.
Using a combination of physical work
outs, readings and class discussion, stu
dents explore effective ways to ensure
their personal safety.
"The goal of the class is to increase the
effective alternatives available to women,"
said April Neilson, one of the three in
structors and a staff member at the Hoover
Institution. "We focus on the prevention
of bodily harm, and feel that harm can best
be prevented by planning and thinking
ahead."
The course is the brainchild of Matt
Thomas, a local investment banker with
black belts in judo and karate, and one of
the class instructors.
Thomas studied police reports of ap
proximately 3000 rapes in cities across the
United States. "I discovered that 70 per

cent of reported rapes are unarmed. I
knew I could teach an effective self
defense course against that kind of un
armed assault," Thomas explained. "I
realize that women needed to be able to
punch full power, on uneven ground in
the dark, without the benefits of warm-ups
and special clothes."
Students feel that the most valuable part
of the course are the model muggings.
Thomas, wearing heavy padded clothing,
attacks a student from a variety of different
positions. The woman then strikes back,
using methods learned in the class.
"Model muggings enable you to make
your mistakes in class," said senior Anna
Pinon, an anthropology major. "They pre
pare you to effectively confront a similar
situation in real life."
The student's goal is to be able to knock
her assailant unconscious in the first five
seconds of the attack by striking at his vital
zones. But, said Elissa Hirsh, student and
secretary in the Humanities Department,

"it is stressed that we use physical violence
as a last resort."
The class emphasis is on psychological
ways to avoid rape. Thomas believes HO
percent of all assaults could be prevented
by psychological means, and another 10
percent could be avoided by taking proper
security measures. Only 10 percent of all
attacks should require physical resistance,
according to Thomas.
"I'm apt to take less risks," Neilson said.
"I now have more information on situa
tions that I didn't perceive before as
threatening. I think students are more apt
to evaluate consequences of their be
havior and where they place themselves.
"I'd much rather base my personal
safety on awareness and forethought
rather than ignorance and luck."
The students are exploring alternatives
to establish the class permanently at Stan
ford with adequate facilities and academic
units, and are circulating petitions in an
effort to generate support.
