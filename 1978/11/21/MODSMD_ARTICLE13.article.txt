## Editorial No to divestment 
### 
Tonight, the ASSU Senate's Fi
nance Committee, chaired by Sen.
Ted Gardenswartz, will begin serious
discussion of the recently issued re
port on "ASSU Investment Manage
ment," submitted by Financial Man
ager William Lape.
The report addresses specifically
the question of divestment of the AS
SU's $350,000-plus investment in the
University's Merge Pool B.
Last year's senate, by a 7-6 vote at
its last meeting, mandated Lape's
report in the hope it would pave the
way toward divestment. Those seven
senators were protesting the Univer
sity's ownership of stock in com
panies having investments in South
Africa.
In his report, Lape placed the re
corded value of the ASSU's long-term
assets at $352,000. He writes, "This
money is held in the form of 22,000
merged endowment pool shares, all
part of the University's Merge Pool B.
The merged pool carries a recorded
value of approximately
$250,000,000."
Lape examines alternative invest
ment possibilities in his report, but
concludes that the ASSU would be
unwise, from a financial standpoint,
to divest from Merge Pool B.
"The merged pool costs the ASSU
very little, requires minimal direct
ASSU management involvement and
bears a performance record which is
nearly unequaled," Lape said. "Ad
mittedly, the Association is extremely
fortunate to be able to make use of
the University's endowment pool as
an investment alternative."
The potential negative financial
consequences of divestment, as
noted by Lape in his report, far out
weigh any symbolic affect.
"The ASSU contributes no more to
apartheid than anyone owning a gold
filling, or a Ford automobile," Lape
writes. "Divestment would be strictly
a symbolic gesture."
Lape raises very serious arguments
against divestment, and the senate
should defeat the bill sponsored by
Sen. Geoff Baskir calling for divest

ment from Merge Pool B.
Financial self-sufficiency is critical
to the ASSU's ability to operate as an
independent and influential student
organization. Investment income
from the merge pool is counted on to
cover a substantial portion of the AS
SU's operating budget.
Divestment would result in sub
stantially higher investment and
management costs, eating into in
vestment income that is used for
ASSU operations. Unlike the Univer
sity, the ASSU cannot be a large in
stitutional investor taking advantage
of low brokerage fees. Simply stated,
$352,000 is a small number when at
tempting to create a strong, safe and
diversified investment portfolio. By
taking advantage of the University's
merge pool, the ASSU has been able
to substantially save brokerage fees.
The University's investment diversifi
cation has also guaranteed a safe,
high rate of return.
All alternatives investigated by
Lape involve a higher risk, a lower
real rate of return and constant
monitoring by the ASSU financial
manager. And with the annual tur
nover ot student financial managers,
the ability of the financial manger to
be a successful watchdog has to be
questioned.
The non-binding referendum on
the October ASSU ballot calling for
divestment from Merge Pool B, which
passed 900-888, was far from any type
of mandate. It was the least debated
referendum in recent years, and stu
dents had no idea of its implications
before voting. If anyone believes that
900 of the 12,000-member student
body favoring divestment is a man
date to divest, they are entirely mista
ken.
Lape was correct that the senate's
decision is "of extreme importance to
all Stanford students, both present
and future." Any move toward di
vestment would be costly, and could
financially hurt the ASSU for years to
come. The symbolic gesture, which
will have little or no effect, is not
worth the effort.
