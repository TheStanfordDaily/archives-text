Documentary
on PLO
disturbing
I was deeply disturbed by
ABC's recent presentation
about the PLO terrorists enti
tled "Terror In The Promised
Land." It was a very biased pre
sentation of the Palestinian
problem and probably one of
the smoothest propaganda
programs that I have seen in
recent years. It portrayed the
PLO terrorists and their mur
derous acts as those of heroes
and martyrs while romanticiz
ing violence.
This was a very perverted dis
tortion of the true situation.
Some crucial facts about the
Palestinian problem were con
veniently omitted. One got the
impression that there is only
one refuge problem. In fact,
over 794,000 Jews left Arab

countries in 1948 because of
harsh persecution and 600,000
of them were settled in Israel.
The official U.N. figure of 1948
was that there were 472,000
Palestinians who left Israel by
and large on their own accord
at the urging of the other Arab
countries who said they could
quickly return when Israel was
annihilated in that initial war.
Also neglected was the fact
that there are almost one-half
million Arabs in the pre-1%7
state of Israel who enjoy the
benefits of the only democracy
in the Middle East.
The PLO in their 1968 coven
ant stated that the establish
ment of the state of Israel was
fundamentally null and void. In
the 1974 PLO 10point program,
they stated that they will accept
a West Bank Gaza State only as
an interim "fighting authority"
to the "total liberation of Pales
tinian soil." Those who say a

democratic secular state of
"Palestine" will bring peace to
the Middle East where Jews
and Arabs can live side by side
are naive. Look to Lebanon
where there is a civil war bet
ween Palestinian, Syrian and
Christian Arabs. How in the
name of reality could we ex
pect that the Arabs would live
in a secular Palestinian state.
Another myth is that the
Palestinians do not have their
own homeland when in actual
ity there is already a Palestinian
state, namely, Jordan.
Prior to 1922, Palestine in
cluded Israel and all of Jordan.
In 1922 the British mandate
created the state of Trans-
Jordan which physically oc
cupies over 80 percent of what
was original Palestine. Over
half of the population of Jordan
is Palestinian and indeed there
is a Palestinian state.
This program by ABC con
dones terrorism and tends to
legitimize the PLO and its vio
lent practices. There is a Pales
tinian problem, but certainly
this is not an adequate basis
upon which one can justify acts
of murder. The interviews with
the terrorists indicate that they
have absolutely no regard for
human life, whether their own
or those of others. '
There is a great chance for
peace in the Middle East, and
Israel and Egypt have taken the
initiative in making that dream
a reality. The oil rich Arab na
tions long ago could have ab
sorbed the Palestinian re
fugees, and certainly today, if
they wanted peace in the Mid
dle East they could support the
initiative shown by President
Sadat when he journeyed to Is
rael. King Hussein has an op
portunity to also bring peace to
the Middle East and be a major
partner in settling the Palesti
nian problem but thus far he
has refused to do so. Let us
hope that some of these Arab
leaders, aside from President
Sadat will see that only by their
active role can the Middle East
become not what the PLO ad
vocates, "a battleground," but
a land of peace and prosperity
where all people of all faiths
can live side by side in har
mony.
