## Honor code makes sense 
### 
This started out to be a column de
monstrating that the honor code doesn't
make sense. That it is unrealistic, incon
gruous; rewards crooks and punishes
honesty.
The way it got started was this. Four
weeks ago, I saw a Gallup poll of high
school students in which about two-thirds
of them admitted that they cheated on
tests. Males, females, good students, bad
students, all parts of the country — every
group owned up to at least an occasional
peak over a neighbor's shoulder. Some
cheated all the time.
After I read this I thought, "Students
come to Stanford. They've been cheating
in high school. Maybe cheating helped
them get in. They're faced with stiffer
competition, harder work, more pressure
to achieve.
"They want good grades. Med school,
law school, grad school, parents say they
need good grades. And they're told
they're on their honor not to cheat. It's like
putting Dracula in a room full of sleeping
virgins and telling him he's on his honor
not to suck. Unrealistic."
Then I thought about some other as
pects of campus life.
How are parking regulations enforced?
A small army of men in little cars writing
tickets. How does the Jibrary prevent
theft? Searches you as you leave.
Bookstore? Makes you leave your
backpack outside. Gym? Reminds you to
lock your locker so no one steals your
pants while you're running.

But when it comes to the thing many
students want most — grades — it's an
honor system. Incongruous.
Next I considered the potential rewards
of violating the code. It seemed reasona
ble to hypothesize that a fairly clever con
firmed cheatercould steal one letter grade
in one out of every four courses. Thus, he
could improve his overall CPA by .25.
For a pre-law, this could mean the dif
ference between Harvard Law and the
University of Santa Clara. Perhaps $100,000

What doesn't make sense is a
society where doing a little bet
ter in college can mean $100,000
or even a million dollars differ
ence in lifetime income.

in lifetime income. For a pre-med it could
mean the difference between becoming a
doctor and a biology professor. Maybe a
million dollars in lifetime income rewards
crooks.
Before I sat down to formalize these ar
guments, I decided to do some research. (I
am, after all, a grad student — I can't have
an opinion without research to back it up.)
What I learned spoiled my column.
I found out that studies show that there
is less cheating at schools which have
honor codes than those which don't. That
studies show that there is less cheating at

Stanford than at most other schools. That
Stanford students in the cynical 70s don't
cheat more than previous generations. Of
course there's some cheating, but the evi
dence says there's not much.
Even though my column got ruined, I
can't really say I was sorry to learn these
things. Because I learned one other thing
in the course of my thinking and research.
I learned that I like the honor code. I like
self-regulation, nobody looking over your
shoulder, people responsible for them
selves. These should form the basis for all
systems of regulation.
Sure the honorcode is incongruous. It's
out of place at Stanford and it's out of
place in a society which emphasizes sec
urity measures and punishment for de
viance. But it's the library, the parking
regulators and the lawmakers who ought
to rethink their approach.
Sure it's possible for a few people to
benefit by gross violations of the code. But
it's not the honor code that doesn't make
sense. What doesn't make sense is a soci
ety where doing a little better in college
can mean $100,000 or even a million dol
lars difference in lifetime income.
Contrary to what I thought at first, the
honor code makes very good sense. Chal
lenge people to break a rule, theaten them
with punishment and they'll find a way to
beat it. Make them a part of the system and
they may make it work.

mean the difference between becoming a

million dollars in lifetime income rewards

Before I sat down to formalize these ar
guments, I decided to do some research. (I
am, after all, a grad student — I can't have
an opinion without research to back it up.)
What I learned spoiled my column.
I found out that studies show that there
is less cheating at schools which have
honor codes than those which don't. That
studies show that there is less cheating at

Stanford than at most other schools. That
Stanford students in the cynical 70s don't
cheat more than previous generations. Of
course there's some cheating, but the evi
dence says there's not much.
Even though my column got ruined, I
can't really say I was sorry to learn these
things. Because I learned one other thing
in the course of my thinking and research.
I learned that I like the honor code. I like
self-regulation, nobody looking over your
shoulder, people responsible for them
selves. These should form the basis for all
systems of regulation.
Sure the honorcode is incongruous. It's
out of place at Stanford and it's out of
place in a society which emphasizes sec
urity measures and punishment for de
viance. But it's the library, the parking
regulators and the lawmakers who ought
to rethink their approach.
Sure it's possible for a few people to
benefit by gross violations of the code. But
it's not the honor code that doesn't make
sense. What doesn't make sense is a soci
ety where doing a little better in college
can mean $100,000 or even a million dol
lars difference in lifetime income.
Contrary to what I thought at first, the
honor code makes very good sense. Chal
lenge people to break a rule, theaten them
with punishment and they'll find a way to
beat it. Make them a part of the system and
they may make it work.
(Michael Amber is a graduate student in
the school of education. His cofumn ap
pears bi-weekly.)

This started out to be a column de
monstrating that the honor code doesn't
make sense. That it is unrealistic, incon
gruous; rewards crooks and punishes
honesty.
The way it got started was this. Four
weeks ago, I saw a Gallup poll of high
school students in which about two-thirds
of them admitted that they cheated on
tests. Males, females, good students, bad
students, all parts of the country — every
group owned up to at least an occasional
peak over a neighbor's shoulder. Some
cheated all the time.
After I read this I thought, "Students
come to Stanford. They've been cheating
in high school. Maybe cheating helped
them get in. They're faced with stiffer
competition, harder work, more pressure
to achieve.
"They want good grades. Med school,
law school, grad school, parents say they
need good grades. And they're told
they're on their honor not to cheat. It's like
putting Dracula in a room full of sleeping
virgins and telling him he's on his honor
not to suck. Unrealistic."
Then I thought about some other as
pects of campus life.
How are parking regulations enforced?
A small army of men in little cars writing
tickets. How does the Jibrary prevent
theft? Searches you as you leave.
Bookstore? Makes you leave your
backpack outside. Gym? Reminds you to
lock your locker so no one steals your
pants while you're running.

But when it comes to the thing many
students want most — grades — it's an
honor system. Incongruous.
Next I considered the potential rewards
of violating the code. It seemed reasona
ble to hypothesize that a fairly clever con
firmed cheatercould steal one letter grade
in one out of every four courses. Thus, he
could improve his overall CPA by .25.
For a pre-law, this could mean the dif
