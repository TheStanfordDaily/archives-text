## Programs don't consider women 
### 
Food week at Stanford is upon us and it
is time we take a look at what hunger really
is. As we have become more aware of the
widespread hunger in the world today, we
also have begun reforming and creating
institutions to alleviate the problem. But
most of these institutions are treating
symptoms and not the roots of trouble.
Hunger, poverty, war and sexism can only
be eliminated by ending the conditions
causing and sustaining them.
Why do I add sexism to a list of problems
dealing with limited resources and poor
distribution? Because the roles of women
and sexism are at the very crux of the world
food crisis . . . and its solution. Women
make up from 50 to 90 percent of the ag
ricultural labor force in most of sub-
Saharan Africa, much of Southeast Asia
and some parts of South America. They
work in their family's fields with little
technological assistance and usually grow
only what their family needs to eat.
If their husbands work in the fields, it is
usually with cash crops, like tobacco or
coffee. Yet, it is generally the men who
receive the benefit of technological aid.
Thus food production for the family re
mains limited and may even suffer for the
sake of the husband's work. Women are
not trained to use the agricultural equip
ment introduced to their land by de
velopment agencies and may even lose
whatever income they can generate to
men and machines. For example, in
Jakarta, Indonesia, 1600 women were put
out of work by 19 men and a rice huller.
In the home where women are expected
to feed and take care of their husbands
and children and keep house, greater
manifestations of sexism are apparent.
Women have always been less educated
than men because it has never been

thought important that they be educated,
just as their role as agricultural laborer has
never been considered as significant as
men's.
Yet where women are the producers and
processors of food, their lack of education
has resounding consequences, fof her
family, but most especially for herself. In
Tanzania, many women prepare maize by
soaking and pounding it, a process that

be designed to include
women's knowledge,
needs and skills, rather
than pushing them aside
and leaving them behind as
their countries are trying to
progress.

causes the loss of 60 percent of the protein
and 40 percent of the calories. In many
Asian cultures, women are forbidden to
eat fish, seafood, chicken, ducks and eggs
as well as various nutritious vegetables.
Men are given the best food in greater
amounts because they are considered
more important to the economic survival
of the family.
Thus the women who bear the children,
and work under hard labor conditions are
denied the extra iron and other nutrients
crucial for their health and their childrens'
health. There is a direct correlation bet
ween the mother's diet and the health of
her children; denying herself the best
food directly limits the potential of her
baby's full growth.
Perhaps the most tragic effect of the
women's lack of education and their sub
sequent exploitation has been the shift
from breast-feeding to bottle-feeding. The
use of media has taken on a sinister twist
when it advertises infant formulas as being
just as good or even better than breast
milk. To be modern, even poverty struck
families buy cans of formula, adding
another expensive burden to their budget
while threatening the lives of their chil
dren.
Whereas breast-milk is cheap, clean and
provides immunological agents against in
fection, bottle milk has the risk of having
been made with contaminated water and
not in sufficient amounts to provide the
necessary nutrients. In Chile, it has been
found that the death rate of bottle-fed in
fants before the age of three months is

three times higher than that of breast-fed
infants. Yet the women maintained that if
they had "believed" more in the canned
formula, their babies would still be alive.
The need for women's roles to be rec
ognized in the development process is
obvious. So far, development aid has been
concentrated on men, taking away what
status women once had in traditional soci
ety and complicating their lives in more
industrialized societies. Industrialization
has led to limitingwomen's roles in society
the world over.
To be effective, nutrition education
programs and development efforts must
take account of the size of women's work
loads. Adding new chores to an already
long list means that other essential tasks
must be dropped.
The need for greater education among
women is apparent from the fact that
worldwide only half as many women are
literate as are men. Vet that education
needs to be backed by support from soci
ety. Once educated, these women need to
be able to find meaningful work, rather
than have them meet a dead end. In In
donesia, for instance, there are many
bright working women who find them
selves placed outside the functions of soc
iety and are therefore very confused.
They can not go home to their villages
because there is no role for them there.
Once educated, Indonesian men do not
want to marry them because they are
thought to be too intelligent or too edu
cated to make "good" wives. They simply
no longer have any function in the "tradi
tional'' parts of society, which are still very
important in Indonesia.
The underdevelopment of women and
the prevalence of hunger in the world are
too closely linked to be ignored any
longer. Already various organizations, like
UNICEF and OxFam have recognized the
connection and have aimed their prog
rams at specific problems of women.
These programs encourage greater self
education and thus self-esteem, improv
ing the sanitation, nutrition and welfare of
the community.
More aid programs need to be designed
to include women's knowledge, needs
and skills, rather than pushing them aside
and leaving them behind as theircountries
are trying to progress. As we are all begin
ning to realize, women's roles as
homemakers and community members
are not as insignificant or demeaning as
has previously been thought. Women are
in fact the source of strength and the key
to a better way of life throughout the
world.
