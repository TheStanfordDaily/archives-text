# ASSU Financial Manager calls divestment plan a bad idea
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
On balance, divestment of ASSU assets from the Uni
versity's Merge Pool B is a bad idea, ASSU Financial
Manager William Lape concludes in a report released
recently.
Potentially-increased risk, higher investment costs
and lower returns, coupled with administrative difficul
ties of portfolio management, led Lape to conclude that
keeping ASSU money in the pool is the organization's
soundest financial strategy.
The ASSU Senate Finance Committee will discuss the
report at a meeting this evening.
The report was prepared by Lape after last year's se
nate requested a report on investment alternatives.
Some have criticized ASSU's participation in the
merged pool because some of the securities involve
corporations with South African investments.
Income
The ASSU has some $352,000 invested in the pool, and
uses that income to offset administrative costs. In 1977,
the ASSU contribution to its operating budget totaled
$29,000. Of this, about $19,500 came from merged-pool
income.
Besides the $19,500 paid by the University, the ASSU
had additional income automatically reinvested into the
pool. The sum of payout, reinvested income and market
value appreciation makes the total return on the Univer
sity investment anywhere from 8 to "well over" 12 per
cent.
The report states that "divestment would be a strictly
symbolic gesture" and that "the ASSU contributes no

more to apartheid than anyone owning a gold filling or a
Ford automobile."
Lape's report also points to possible legal problems
with divestment. He states that it is doubtful that a deci
sion to divest, or any other major investment decision,
could be made without University sanction.
Responsibility
In addition, the report points out that ASSU officers
have a legal responsibility to manage organization funds
in the most responsible manner possible.
The high return and low cost of keeping the funds in
the merged pool makes the option more attractive than
nine specific alternatives outlined in the report.
The report calls the merged-pool performance
"nearly unequaled."
"Admittedly the Association is extremely fortunate to
be able to make use of the University's endowment pool
as an investment alternative," the report states.
Difficulties
"On the other hand, ASSU budget financing would
ultimately be difficult or impossible to achieve in the
absence of this optimal investment."
Lape's report states that $350,000 is not enough to
qualify the ASSU for reduced institutional brokerage
fees and low-cost financial counseling. Such rates and
management are available to the University, however,
beca.use Merge Pool B assets total approximately $250
million.
The finance committee will review Lape's report while
considering a resolution proposal from ASSU Sen. Geoff
Baskir to divest funds from the pool.
