# Videotaped lectures help improve profs
## 
### STEVE WARILA 
A new service here helps
professors improve their
lectures through self
evaluation. The Medical
Center's Division of Instruc
tional Media is videotaping
classes so instructors can
see themselves in action.
Instructional media coor
dinator Robert Hecht said
he and media specialist
Michael Yonchenko
suggested the program. He
said research has shown the
effectiveness of videotape
self-evaluation in improving
speakers' communication
techniques.
The program was estab
lished, Hecht explained,
after it received taculty sup
port.
Hecht said this program
"could be the first step in
teacher improvement."
Videotape self-evaluation
allows professors to "see
things that they never had a
chance to see before" about
the way they lecture. If used
conscientiously, this service
would enable professors to
improve their ability to

communicate knowledge,
Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch reviewed the
tape he had made of his
Sociology 1 class with some
graduate students.
"I like the possibility of
feedback," he said. "Having
another group look at the
tape and criticize my lecture
was helful and educational
for them and for
me."Dornbusch also said
the taping was unobtrusive
and did not distract him or
his students.
According to Yonchenko,
additional tapings have
been scheduled and many
more are expected soon.
The videotaping probably
will not be in common use
immediately, he said, be
cause no one has decided
who should pay the $60 fee
which covers operating
costs. Currently the profes
sors pay.
Yonchenko said another
deterrent to the program is
that "a lot of people have
trouble deciding to do
something that is self
critical in nature."
