## Movies/jim mattson Satisfying no one 
### 
When he released Wizards a
few years ago, animator
director Ralph Bakshi was ac
cused of trying to pinch plot
twists and characters straight
from Lord of the Rings. The
criticism must have stung, for
Bakshi promptly bought the
book and set out to do the
story right.
Unfortunately, Bakshi's
righteous indignation, which
might have added bite and wit
to his film, apparently didn't
last too long. What we see on
the screen (and what we see is
still only half of the story) runs
out of steam about halfway
through in its attempt to retell
J.R.R. Tolkien's cult epic. It's
not that Bakshi has savaged the
book; if anything, the problem
was that he attempted to be too
faithful to the book's plot at the
cost of characterization and
dramatic pacing.
Who's who?
As a result, even Tolkien de
votees may have trouble keep
ing track of who's who. Even
relatively important characters
are given scarcely a line of in
troduction, and as for the leg
ions of kings and warriors —
well, maybe theaters would
consider selling a sheet with
biographical informaton at the
concession stand. How the hell
is the audience supposed to
know what an ent is, or who
Theoden or Saruman are, if
Bakshi won't tell us?
The animators filmed every

thing in black and white with
live actors before they began to
draw. These models allowed
them to give greater realism to
the animated characters, a
realism which is often very ef
fective. But, apparently as an
economy measure in scenes
involving large numbers of
people, we are treated to the
bizarre sight of live action
which has merely been dyed to
match the rest of the movie.
One scene where warriors
storm a castle's walls, for
example, looks as if someone
took the footage from a '40s
medieval epic and painted it
yellow.
Close to a style
Many of the animated scenes
do conjure up something that
comes close to being style. The
ringwraiths, before their la
mentable transformation to
costumed live actors, have a
creepy slyness. The wizard's
subterranean battle with a per
sonified unpleasantry called a
Balrog is made interesting by a
dynamic, writhing style of
drawing. And the
backgrounds, although amaz
ingly eclectic (they go from
ultra-realistic to being near
abstract in the span of a few
seconds), are often very beaut
iful.
The good scenes merely
make the over-all slackness of
The Lord of the Rings even
more disappointing. For every
good ghoul there are two like

the effete elf or the "cute"
hobbit. The film's main charac
ter, a hobbit named Frodo
Baggins is so round-eyed and
mop-headed that he seems like
a refugee from a Hallmark
card. The elf queen could have
been borrowed from a Clairol
commerical — until she opens
her blue eyes and they grotes
quely cover half her forehead.
Subdued
Leonard Roseriman's music,
though really not so bad (ex
ceptforone excruciating scene
with a massed children's
chorus), is curiously subdued.
Several scenes could have
been much better had they had
appropriately boisterous
music to support them. A
near-magical spot where a river
rises out of its bed to defeat the
ringwwraiths is compromised
by too-quiet scoring. Is this
another attempt to be "reve
rent" about the book?
Perhaps the music is only
symptomatic of the film's gen
eral malaise. Bakshi was faced

with the admittedly difficult
task of filming a book about
which many people feel
strongly, so out of fear of of
fending anyone he created
something that can really
satisfy no one. The variety in
the backgrounds seems to in
dicate that he was groping for a
style. He ended up with a
movie which lacks an overrid
ing viewpoint; it hesitates just
when it needs to be most insis
tent.
Chutzpah
If Bakshi had been as gutsy in
his directing as he was in set
ting up the film's ending, Lord
of the Rings would have been
a masterpiece of chutzpah.
After two hours, instead of a
satisfying ending all we get is a
voice-over saying that this is
merely the end of Part One of
Lord of the Rings; the conclu
sion lies buried in the as-yet
unfinished Part Two. Con
gratulations; you've just spent
two hours and three bucks on
half a movie.
