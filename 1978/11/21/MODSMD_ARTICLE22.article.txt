## Guarneri sparkling despite flaws 
### 
There is no string quartet in the world finer
than the Guarneri. Each year its Stanford
appearance is the highlight of the Lively
Arts series, if not the area's most important
cultural event. This year's three Guarneri
concerts, if not up to previous standards,
thrilled sellout crowds.
The Guarneri is a Romantic quartet. Its
sound is warm, full, and smooth, its in
terpretations expressiveand broad, and its
repertoire predominantly 19th century.
The program this year exemplified the
quartet's stylistic predilections. The
works were Central European, 19th cen
tury in spirit, if not fact. Even the dark,
anguished Mozart No. 75 and the harmon
ically daring Haydn Op. 76 No. 6, both late
17th century works, contain latent Roman
ticism, and the Bartok Quartet No. 3, con
trasting frantic virtuosity with hopeless
depression, was brilliantly realized. From
the heartwrenching violin and viola varia
tion in the second movement to the bold,
devilish finale, the Guarneri was utterly
convincing. Likewise, the Bartok Quartet
No. 2 was powerful and vital, yet seem
ingly smooth, a combination that is the
Guarneri sound.
Bad omen
The Mozart was weak, however, a har
binger of worse to come on Friday and
Sunday. The Guarneri Quartet, like most
small ensembles, strives always for com
plete unity: a rhythmically tight, interpre
tively balanced, and totally confident pre
sentation. It seems that the Guarneri
achieves this emotionally, almost spiritu

ally. There is a barely perceptible moment
at each of its concerts where its musicians
become one. In the Mozart, this moment
never came.
The sound remained small, the rhythms
not quite precise, and the musicians did
not seem to build on each other's strength,
as is usually the case. To realize the unre
mitting although subdued anguish in the
score, a quartet must maintain total con
centration, which seemed lacking Wed
nesday night. Their-recording of this work
is much better.
This slightly diffuse and not quite con
vincing mood pervaded the last two
nights. But while Wednesday's problems
can be attributed to the need to warm up,
or — if the program notes arean indication
— to conscious intent, the incomplete
ness of Friday and Sunday can be attri
buted to one person — first violinist Ar
nold Steinhardt.
Bow woe
I hesitate to blame a single quartet
member in such a small group, but com
pared to previous performances,
Steinhardt was poor. His E-string tone, al
ways a small problem, was thin, wavering
and tinny. Bowing sloppily (generally slid
ing towards the fingerboard too much),
Steinhardt transformed several notes into
squawks, and one (in the final movement
of the Haydn) disappeared completely.
Twice his bow skipped and wavered on the
pianissimo final notes of slow movements.
Intonation problems grew out of his bow

ing troubles.
When a quartet is as dependent on
overall emotional unity as the Guarneri,
such problems bring the whole group
down individually and collectively. Most
importantly, nervousness contributed to
lukewarm interpretation and lackluster
technique. On Sunday, the Schubert
Quartetsatz, like the Mozart a study in
somber emotion, was weak and tentative.
The Schubert Quartet No. 13, and the
Dvorak Quartet were not outstanding.
Interference
Friday night was the worst, since prob
lems with the quartet were compounded
by drumming from the Stanford Band out
side the auditorium during the Haydn and
a bloodcurdling scream during the Men
delssohn. Interpretively, the Haydn Quar
tet was most convincing, with the comic
Trio subtly played. Incidentally, last year a
Daily reviewer accused the Guarneri of
lacking a sense of humor. If the Haydn Trio
didn't disprove that assertion, then the
quartet's response to the band drumming
between movements — laughter and few
dance moves — should have.
But, the Guarneri left us with a promise
for next year. Despite a merely mediocre
night, its final encore, from the Ravel
Quartet, was magnificent. Absolute piz
zicato precision combined with luxuri
ously and evenly muted tone, to create a
sparkling and lively impressionist effect.
No quartet in the world could have played
it better.

can be attributed to the need to warm up,

Bow woe
I hesitate to blame a single quartet
member in such a small group, but com
pared to previous performances,
Steinhardt was poor. His E-string tone, al
ways a small problem, was thin, wavering
and tinny. Bowing sloppily (generally slid
ing towards the fingerboard too much),
Steinhardt transformed several notes into
squawks, and one (in the final movement
of the Haydn) disappeared completely.
Twice his bow skipped and wavered on the
pianissimo final notes of slow movements.
Intonation problems grew out of his bow

ing troubles.
When a quartet is as dependent on
overall emotional unity as the Guarneri,
such problems bring the whole group
down individually and collectively. Most
importantly, nervousness contributed to
lukewarm interpretation and lackluster
technique. On Sunday, the Schubert
Quartetsatz, like the Mozart a study in
somber emotion, was weak and tentative.
The Schubert Quartet No. 13, and the
Dvorak Quartet were not outstanding.
Interference
Friday night was the worst, since prob
lems with the quartet were compounded
by drumming from the Stanford Band out
side the auditorium during the Haydn and
a bloodcurdling scream during the Men
delssohn. Interpretively, the Haydn Quar
tet was most convincing, with the comic
Trio subtly played. Incidentally, last year a
Daily reviewer accused the Guarneri of
lacking a sense of humor. If the Haydn Trio
didn't disprove that assertion, then the
quartet's response to the band drumming
between movements — laughter and few
dance moves — should have.
But, the Guarneri left us with a promise
for next year. Despite a merely mediocre
night, its final encore, from the Ravel
Quartet, was magnificent. Absolute piz
zicato precision combined with luxuri
ously and evenly muted tone, to create a
sparkling and lively impressionist effect.
No quartet in the world could have played
it better.
There is no string quartet in the world finer
than the Guarneri. Each year its Stanford
appearance is the highlight of the Lively
Arts series, if not the area's most important
cultural event. This year's three Guarneri
concerts, if not up to previous standards,
thrilled sellout crowds.
The Guarneri is a Romantic quartet. Its
sound is warm, full, and smooth, its in
terpretations expressiveand broad, and its
repertoire predominantly 19th century.
The program this year exemplified the
quartet's stylistic predilections. The
works were Central European, 19th cen
tury in spirit, if not fact. Even the dark,
anguished Mozart No. 75 and the harmon
ically daring Haydn Op. 76 No. 6, both late
17th century works, contain latent Roman
ticism, and the Bartok Quartet No. 3, con
trasting frantic virtuosity with hopeless
depression, was brilliantly realized. From
the heartwrenching violin and viola varia
tion in the second movement to the bold,
devilish finale, the Guarneri was utterly
convincing. Likewise, the Bartok Quartet
No. 2 was powerful and vital, yet seem
ingly smooth, a combination that is the
Guarneri sound.
Bad omen
The Mozart was weak, however, a har
binger of worse to come on Friday and
Sunday. The Guarneri Quartet, like most
small ensembles, strives always for com
plete unity: a rhythmically tight, interpre
tively balanced, and totally confident pre
sentation. It seems that the Guarneri
achieves this emotionally, almost spiritu

ally. There is a barely perceptible moment
at each of its concerts where its musicians
become one. In the Mozart, this moment
never came.
The sound remained small, the rhythms
not quite precise, and the musicians did
not seem to build on each other's strength,
as is usually the case. To realize the unre
mitting although subdued anguish in the
score, a quartet must maintain total con
centration, which seemed lacking Wed
nesday night. Their-recording of this work
is much better.
