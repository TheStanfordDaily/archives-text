### 
For those of us who have always equated ex
cellent theater in the Bay Area with ACT, it's time
we ventured beyond Geary Street to the other
side of the Bay. With their brilliant production of
Thorton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, the
Berkeley Repertory Theatre has proven that ex
citing, professional theater is not indigenous to
only San Francisco.
The Skin of Our Teeth is Wilder's allegorical,
three-act history of Mankind. It is the story of a
"typical American family," George Antrobus,
his wife, two children, Gladys and Henry, and
their maid, Sabina. But the Antrobus' become
Wilder's Human Family, and during the course
of the play they celebrate their 5000 th wedding
anniversary and survive the Ice Age, the Flood
and world war by the "skin of their teeth."
Wilder wrote that "the audience will soon
perceive it is seeing two times at once . . . the
Antrobus family living in pre-historic times and
in a New Jersey commuter's suburb." Wilder
projects his own mythical vision of the American
family against the vast dimensions of geological
time, biblical time and recorded history.
Characters
His characters are allegorical figures. An
trobus, the typical middle-class American, is
also Adam'and the father of the human race. His
wife is the American mother, Eve and the eternal
mother. Gladys is Antrobus' hope for perfec
tion, and his son Henry, who bears the mark of
Cain, is the proof that it can never be realized.
Sabina is less easy to define. Wilder seems to
imply that she is history's perpetual sensualist
who never sees beyond her own pleasure.
The first act occurs in the Atrobus family home
in Excelsior. Despite the unusual cold spell in
the middle of August and reports that glaciers
have moved as far south as Hartford, Antrobus
arrives home jubilent because he has just in
vented the wheel and perfected the alphabet.
He invites a group of refugees who include
Moses, Homer and three of the nine muses, and
they stoke up the fire and prepare to save the
human race.
Enjoy
Act Two takes place in Atlantic City at a con
vention of the "Ancient and HonorableOrderof
Mammals, Subdivision Humans" of which An
trobus is president. The convention is shown as
both a typical businessman's conference, and as
the biblical world before the flood. Antrobus
announces that the new motto of the human
race is "enjoy yourself," and as Father Time
posts the storm warnings, the conventioneers
blithely indulge themselves in a sort of com
bined Sodom and Gomorrah and Beach Blanket
Bash.
Antrobus is seduced by Sabina, yet is saved
when he finally accepts the responsibilities of
his "family" — Mankind. As he boards the ship
the Fortune Teller says, "George Antrobus!
Think it over! A new world to make!"
In Act Three Antrobus' new world is in ashes.
A world war has just ended, and he returns
home disheartened because the evil of Henry-
Cain still exists in the world. Vet Antrobus

courageously decides to begin again because
"every good and excellent thing in the world
stands on the razor-edge of danger and must
be fought for . . . We've come a long ways.
We've learned. We're learning."
Heady
To write the history of Mankind is a heady
prospect for any dramatist, and Wilder's effort
isn't without fault. His mixture of comedy and
seriousness, allegory and literal meaning, and
realism and theatricalism often lacks unity, and
the audience is left wondering whether Wilder
is being serious or merely providing entertain
ing theatrical high-jinks.
Yet despite its weaknesses, The Skin of Our
Teeth remains a thoroughly satisfying and highly
entertaining play. Wilder never lets his ultimate
seriousness eclipse his clever sense of fun.
Characters step in and out of their roles: Sabina
admits to the audience that she doesn't under
stand a word of the play and argues with the
Stage Manager. Later, the Stage Manager
apologizes to the audience that some of the
actors have been taken ill, and that they'll have
to use some very nervous volunteers to com
plete the third act. *
Zest
The audience can't help but feel that this is an
unusual play. Wilder's congenial informality
and intimacy make it unnecessary to distinguish
between what is 'real' and what is allegory.
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre attacks Wil
der's play with zest. Michael Leibert's direction
is well paced, and he never misses the oppor
tunity for a laugh. Despite a few technical mis
haps, Lauren Cory's sets and Lynn Koolish's
lighting design providean imaginative use of the
limited stage space.
Ensemble
The acting ensemble merits superlatives all
around. It'sa rare occurrence that the entire cast
deserves to be singled out for their excellence.
Jahnna Beecham provides much of the comedy
as the vane, opportunistic, pleasure-loving
Sabina. Her impeccable timing is especially evi
dent when she steps out of her role and addres
ses the audience directly.
As Mr. Antrobus, Don West's enthusiasm is
infectious, and his aging through the eons is
awesome. As his wife, Julia Odegard got off to a
halting start, yet both her comedic and dramatic
talents shone in the second and third acts.
As Gladys, Lisa Britt develops from the perfect
picture of little girl brattiness to the fragile
strength of young womanhood. The intensity of
Dale Elliot's portrayal of Henry-Cain is not eas
ily forgotten.
Special mention should go to Charles Dean as
the sour-stomached Stage Manager and J.C.
Sealy as the apocalyptic Fortune Teller. They are
ably supported by Nicole Baptiste, George
Kovach, Paul Laramore and John Warren Tyson.

Heady
To write the history of Mankind is a heady
prospect for any dramatist, and Wilder's effort
isn't without fault. His mixture of comedy and
seriousness, allegory and literal meaning, and
realism and theatricalism often lacks unity, and
the audience is left wondering whether Wilder
is being serious or merely providing entertain
ing theatrical high-jinks.
Yet despite its weaknesses, The Skin of Our
Teeth remains a thoroughly satisfying and highly
entertaining play. Wilder never lets his ultimate
seriousness eclipse his clever sense of fun.
Characters step in and out of their roles: Sabina
admits to the audience that she doesn't under
stand a word of the play and argues with the
Stage Manager. Later, the Stage Manager
apologizes to the audience that some of the
actors have been taken ill, and that they'll have
to use some very nervous volunteers to com
plete the third act. *
Zest
The audience can't help but feel that this is an
unusual play. Wilder's congenial informality
and intimacy make it unnecessary to distinguish
between what is 'real' and what is allegory.
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre attacks Wil
der's play with zest. Michael Leibert's direction
is well paced, and he never misses the oppor
tunity for a laugh. Despite a few technical mis
haps, Lauren Cory's sets and Lynn Koolish's
lighting design providean imaginative use of the
limited stage space.
Ensemble
The acting ensemble merits superlatives all
around. It'sa rare occurrence that the entire cast
deserves to be singled out for their excellence.
Jahnna Beecham provides much of the comedy
as the vane, opportunistic, pleasure-loving
Sabina. Her impeccable timing is especially evi
dent when she steps out of her role and addres
ses the audience directly.
As Mr. Antrobus, Don West's enthusiasm is
infectious, and his aging through the eons is

The Guarneri String Quartet
For those of us who have always equated ex
cellent theater in the Bay Area with ACT, it's time
we ventured beyond Geary Street to the other
side of the Bay. With their brilliant production of
Thorton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, the
Berkeley Repertory Theatre has proven that ex
citing, professional theater is not indigenous to
only San Francisco.
The Skin of Our Teeth is Wilder's allegorical,
three-act history of Mankind. It is the story of a
"typical American family," George Antrobus,
his wife, two children, Gladys and Henry, and
their maid, Sabina. But the Antrobus' become
Wilder's Human Family, and during the course
of the play they celebrate their 5000 th wedding
anniversary and survive the Ice Age, the Flood
and world war by the "skin of their teeth."
Wilder wrote that "the audience will soon
perceive it is seeing two times at once . . . the
Antrobus family living in pre-historic times and
in a New Jersey commuter's suburb." Wilder
projects his own mythical vision of the American
family against the vast dimensions of geological
time, biblical time and recorded history.
Characters
His characters are allegorical figures. An
trobus, the typical middle-class American, is
also Adam'and the father of the human race. His
wife is the American mother, Eve and the eternal
mother. Gladys is Antrobus' hope for perfec
tion, and his son Henry, who bears the mark of
Cain, is the proof that it can never be realized.
Sabina is less easy to define. Wilder seems to
imply that she is history's perpetual sensualist
who never sees beyond her own pleasure.

Heady
To write the history of Mankind is a heady
prospect for any dramatist, and Wilder's effort
isn't without fault. His mixture of comedy and
seriousness, allegory and literal meaning, and
realism and theatricalism often lacks unity, and
the audience is left wondering whether Wilder
is being serious or merely providing entertain
ing theatrical high-jinks.
Yet despite its weaknesses, The Skin of Our
Teeth remains a thoroughly satisfying and highly
entertaining play. Wilder never lets his ultimate
seriousness eclipse his clever sense of fun.
Characters step in and out of their roles: Sabina
admits to the audience that she doesn't under
stand a word of the play and argues with the
Stage Manager. Later, the Stage Manager
apologizes to the audience that some of the
actors have been taken ill, and that they'll have
to use some very nervous volunteers to com
plete the third act. *
Zest
The audience can't help but feel that this is an
unusual play. Wilder's congenial informality
and intimacy make it unnecessary to distinguish
between what is 'real' and what is allegory.
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre attacks Wil

is well paced, and he never misses the oppor
tunity for a laugh. Despite a few technical mis
haps, Lauren Cory's sets and Lynn Koolish's
lighting design providean imaginative use of the
limited stage space.
Ensemble
The acting ensemble merits superlatives all
around. It'sa rare occurrence that the entire cast
deserves to be singled out for their excellence.
Jahnna Beecham provides much of the comedy
as the vane, opportunistic, pleasure-loving
Sabina. Her impeccable timing is especially evi
dent when she steps out of her role and addres
ses the audience directly.
As Mr. Antrobus, Don West's enthusiasm is
infectious, and his aging through the eons is
awesome. As his wife, Julia Odegard got off to a
halting start, yet both her comedic and dramatic
talents shone in the second and third acts.
As Gladys, Lisa Britt develops from the perfect
picture of little girl brattiness to the fragile
strength of young womanhood. The intensity of
Dale Elliot's portrayal of Henry-Cain is not eas

Special mention should go to Charles Dean as
the sour-stomached Stage Manager and J.C.
Sealy as the apocalyptic Fortune Teller. They are
ably supported by Nicole Baptiste, George
Kovach, Paul Laramore and John Warren Tyson.

For those of us who have always equated ex
cellent theater in the Bay Area with ACT, it's time
we ventured beyond Geary Street to the other
side of the Bay. With their brilliant production of
Thorton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, the
Berkeley Repertory Theatre has proven that ex
citing, professional theater is not indigenous to
only San Francisco.
The Skin of Our Teeth is Wilder's allegorical,
three-act history of Mankind. It is the story of a
"typical American family," George Antrobus,
his wife, two children, Gladys and Henry, and
their maid, Sabina. But the Antrobus' become
Wilder's Human Family, and during the course
of the play they celebrate their 5000 th wedding
anniversary and survive the Ice Age, the Flood
and world war by the "skin of their teeth."
Wilder wrote that "the audience will soon
perceive it is seeing two times at once . . . the
Antrobus family living in pre-historic times and
in a New Jersey commuter's suburb." Wilder
projects his own mythical vision of the American
family against the vast dimensions of geological
time, biblical time and recorded history.
Characters
His characters are allegorical figures. An
trobus, the typical middle-class American, is
also Adam'and the father of the human race. His
wife is the American mother, Eve and the eternal
mother. Gladys is Antrobus' hope for perfec
tion, and his son Henry, who bears the mark of
Cain, is the proof that it can never be realized.
Sabina is less easy to define. Wilder seems to
imply that she is history's perpetual sensualist
who never sees beyond her own pleasure.
The first act occurs in the Atrobus family home
in Excelsior. Despite the unusual cold spell in
the middle of August and reports that glaciers
have moved as far south as Hartford, Antrobus
arrives home jubilent because he has just in
vented the wheel and perfected the alphabet.
He invites a group of refugees who include
Moses, Homer and three of the nine muses, and
they stoke up the fire and prepare to save the
human race.
Enjoy
Act Two takes place in Atlantic City at a con
vention of the "Ancient and HonorableOrderof
Mammals, Subdivision Humans" of which An
trobus is president. The convention is shown as
both a typical businessman's conference, and as
the biblical world before the flood. Antrobus
announces that the new motto of the human
race is "enjoy yourself," and as Father Time
posts the storm warnings, the conventioneers
blithely indulge themselves in a sort of com
bined Sodom and Gomorrah and Beach Blanket
Bash.
Antrobus is seduced by Sabina, yet is saved
when he finally accepts the responsibilities of
his "family" — Mankind. As he boards the ship
the Fortune Teller says, "George Antrobus!
Think it over! A new world to make!"
In Act Three Antrobus' new world is in ashes.
A world war has just ended, and he returns
home disheartened because the evil of Henry-
Cain still exists in the world. Vet Antrobus

courageously decides to begin again because
"every good and excellent thing in the world
stands on the razor-edge of danger and must
be fought for . . . We've come a long ways.
We've learned. We're learning."
