## Martha Graham: history reincarnated 
### 
One can not discuss modern
dance at any length without br
inging up the name of Martha
Graham. She helped to
pioneer modern dance and
developed its final real
codified movement technique
which could he taught to and
by others. After seeing her
company in 1978 though, one
felt as if he watched history
being reincarnated. The dan
cers of Martha Graham Dance
Company in performance last
Friday night at Berkeley's Zel
lerbach Auditorium, were all
strong and fresh, but one still
left thinking as much about the
woman who produced the
choreography as about its
existence as dance.
Able
The most recent piece on
the program premiered in
1977, and takes its title, O Thou
who Art About to Sing, from a
poem by St. John Perse. This
duet, danced by l.ucinda
Mitchell and Peter Sparling,
suffered most from the physi
cal limitations of the. creator.
Previously Graham had been
able to fully demonstrate as
she choreographed, but one
imagines that she was not able
to do so while choreographing
this piece.
This is partly because of
Graham's age (she was 83 at the
time) but also from the
choreography itself. The first
section relies heavily on
dramatic stances creating sex
ual tension and energy bet
ween the dancers, but the sec
ond section, after a clearly an
ticipated costume change, ran
into technical problems with
the set and costumes.
Willing
The set is by Marisol, al
though Graham designed the
costumes. Its six large block
like components arranged into
three groups mirror the
themes of the choreography. It
consisted of a couch-like piece
on which the woman reclined,
a larger triangular piece on
which the man leaned, an
over-sized bed-type platform
with associated wedge shaped
stairs, and behind it a large,

curved vertical block.
In the first section of the
piece one recalls most strongly
the dramatic intensity of
Mitchell's eyes and upper body
in general. She and Sparling
approach repeatedly, only to
dart bdck to their respective
sculptures. Finally they are
able to touch more openly as
their movements quicken
sending Mitchell whirling up
stage. Sparling then removed
Mitchell's red flowing half
dress, leaving her in a flesh
toned unifard which matches
his tights.
Flow
After some attempts to cover
herself, she traveled up the
platform, and after receiving
her costume back from Sparl
ing, Mitchell eventually disap
peared behind the large verti
cal sculpture. Sparling danced
a solo while she wrapped some
green and black material
around her. When she ap
peared on the platform again,
he went behind it, and they
emerged linked together by
the material.
Ready
Here the technical problems
began to arise. Although the
dancers managed the choreog
raphy which involved entangl
ing and then disentangling
themselves from the material,
it still seemed awkward, as if
the choreographer had
thought about it, seeing the
movement in her mind instead
of feeling it in her body. The
same problem resulted several
times when the couple
traveled down the platform
and the steps. One was more
preoccupied with worrying
whether the dancers would
safely progress down the
steeply raked surface and dif
ficult steps than with the effect
of the two dancers united pre
senting themselves to the au
dience.
Diversion of Angels, created
for the first season of the
American Dance Festival in
1948, was inspired by a line
from the work of poet Ben Be
litt. Unlike most of her works,
this piece was not designed to
include Graham, nor was it in

the dark passionate vein of
most of her contemporary
works.
Movement
This pleasant lyric dance
contains most of the classic
movements in the Graham
vocabulary. It seems some
what repetitive now, and one
wonders if one has been pre
judiced against some of the
movements simply by seeing
them too much. Graham's
technique of dance movement
based on the principal of con
traction and release of the
torso, is still the most widely
taught system of instruction in
colleges and universities and
many other dancers and
choreographers have drawn
from her movements.
Forcing it
The dancers are four couples
and three solo women who
color-coded archetypes: the
young girl in yellow, the pas
sionate woman in red, and the
lady in white. As the dance be
gins the woman in white is the
center for a circle of men who
turn and fall away from her like
the opening or large, powerful
flower petals. The supporting
women of the cast, dressed in
shades of brown, dash on and
the work develops in a series of
rapid entrances and exits.
There is no character de
velopment as such, but the
piece has a compelling zest
and sincerity.
Score
The performers most nota
ble were Vuriko Kimura as the
woman in red, and Cristine
Dakin as the girl in yellow.
Through their tremendous
energy they were the most able
to infuse the dance with fresh
ness and life.
Night journey the last piece
on the program, premiered the
year before Diversion, 1947.
This piece deals with the
Oedipus myth, but from Jocas
ta's point of view. The piece
has been further re-worked
since its premiere to focus on
the instant of )ocasta's death
when she sees her life given
her new knowledge from the
triumphal entry of Oedipus,
their meeting and marriage.

Most of the choreography
for )ocasta and Oedipus has
held up well, but the parts of
the chorus and the prophet,
Tiresias, seem dated. Tiresias'
entrance using his staff almost
as a pogo-stick has been called
the most unusual and exciting
entrance for a man in the
Graham repertory, but I found it
more absurd than anything
else. The chorus headed by
Peggy Lyman also danced well
but their purpose in the piece
no longer seems self evident.
Damn
In some ways, the focusing
point of the evening came dur
ing the curtain calls, forthe last
piece Night Journey. The cur
tain rose and there stood
Martha Graham, alone on
stage. She raised her arms,
bowed, and stood quiet. The
curtain came down, and when
they raised it again, Graham
was gone and the company
stood in her place.

the instant of )ocasta's death
when she sees her life given
her new knowledge from the
triumphal entry of Oedipus,
their meeting and marriage.

Most of the choreography
for )ocasta and Oedipus has
held up well, but the parts of
the chorus and the prophet,
Tiresias, seem dated. Tiresias'
entrance using his staff almost
as a pogo-stick has been called
the most unusual and exciting
entrance for a man in the
Graham repertory, but I found it
more absurd than anything
else. The chorus headed by
Peggy Lyman also danced well
but their purpose in the piece
no longer seems self evident.

In some ways, the focusing
point of the evening came dur

piece Night Journey. The cur

Martha Graham, alone on
stage. She raised her arms,
bowed, and stood quiet. The
curtain came down, and when
they raised it again, Graham
was gone and the company
stood in her place.

One can not discuss modern
dance at any length without br
inging up the name of Martha
Graham. She helped to
pioneer modern dance and
developed its final real
codified movement technique
which could he taught to and
by others. After seeing her
company in 1978 though, one
felt as if he watched history
being reincarnated. The dan
cers of Martha Graham Dance
Company in performance last
Friday night at Berkeley's Zel
lerbach Auditorium, were all
strong and fresh, but one still
left thinking as much about the
woman who produced the
choreography as about its
existence as dance.
Able
The most recent piece on
the program premiered in
1977, and takes its title, O Thou
who Art About to Sing, from a
poem by St. John Perse. This
duet, danced by l.ucinda
Mitchell and Peter Sparling,
suffered most from the physi
cal limitations of the. creator.
Previously Graham had been
able to fully demonstrate as
she choreographed, but one
imagines that she was not able
to do so while choreographing
this piece.
This is partly because of
Graham's age (she was 83 at the
time) but also from the
choreography itself. The first
section relies heavily on
dramatic stances creating sex
ual tension and energy bet
ween the dancers, but the sec
ond section, after a clearly an
ticipated costume change, ran
into technical problems with
the set and costumes.
Willing
The set is by Marisol, al
though Graham designed the
costumes. Its six large block
like components arranged into
three groups mirror the
themes of the choreography. It
consisted of a couch-like piece
on which the woman reclined,
a larger triangular piece on
which the man leaned, an
over-sized bed-type platform
with associated wedge shaped
stairs, and behind it a large,

curved vertical block.
In the first section of the
piece one recalls most strongly
the dramatic intensity of
Mitchell's eyes and upper body
in general. She and Sparling
approach repeatedly, only to
dart bdck to their respective
sculptures. Finally they are
able to touch more openly as
their movements quicken
sending Mitchell whirling up
stage. Sparling then removed
Mitchell's red flowing half
dress, leaving her in a flesh
toned unifard which matches
his tights.
Flow
After some attempts to cover
herself, she traveled up the
platform, and after receiving
her costume back from Sparl
ing, Mitchell eventually disap
peared behind the large verti
cal sculpture. Sparling danced
a solo while she wrapped some
green and black material
around her. When she ap
peared on the platform again,
he went behind it, and they
emerged linked together by
the material.
Ready
Here the technical problems
began to arise. Although the
dancers managed the choreog
raphy which involved entangl
ing and then disentangling
themselves from the material,
it still seemed awkward, as if
the choreographer had
thought about it, seeing the
movement in her mind instead
of feeling it in her body. The
same problem resulted several
times when the couple
traveled down the platform
and the steps. One was more
preoccupied with worrying
whether the dancers would
safely progress down the
steeply raked surface and dif
ficult steps than with the effect
of the two dancers united pre
senting themselves to the au
dience.
Diversion of Angels, created
for the first season of the
American Dance Festival in
1948, was inspired by a line
from the work of poet Ben Be
litt. Unlike most of her works,
this piece was not designed to
include Graham, nor was it in

the dark passionate vein of
most of her contemporary
works.
Movement
This pleasant lyric dance
contains most of the classic
movements in the Graham
vocabulary. It seems some
what repetitive now, and one
wonders if one has been pre
judiced against some of the
movements simply by seeing
them too much. Graham's
technique of dance movement
based on the principal of con
traction and release of the
torso, is still the most widely
taught system of instruction in
colleges and universities and
many other dancers and
choreographers have drawn
from her movements.
Forcing it
The dancers are four couples
and three solo women who
color-coded archetypes: the
young girl in yellow, the pas
sionate woman in red, and the
lady in white. As the dance be
gins the woman in white is the
center for a circle of men who
turn and fall away from her like
the opening or large, powerful
flower petals. The supporting
women of the cast, dressed in
shades of brown, dash on and
the work develops in a series of
rapid entrances and exits.
There is no character de
velopment as such, but the
piece has a compelling zest
and sincerity.
Score
The performers most nota
ble were Vuriko Kimura as the
woman in red, and Cristine
Dakin as the girl in yellow.
Through their tremendous
energy they were the most able
to infuse the dance with fresh
ness and life.

color-coded archetypes: the
young girl in yellow, the pas
sionate woman in red, and the
lady in white. As the dance be
gins the woman in white is the
center for a circle of men who
turn and fall away from her like
the opening or large, powerful
flower petals. The supporting
women of the cast, dressed in
shades of brown, dash on and
the work develops in a series of
rapid entrances and exits.
There is no character de
velopment as such, but the
piece has a compelling zest
and sincerity.
Score
The performers most nota
ble were Vuriko Kimura as the
woman in red, and Cristine
Dakin as the girl in yellow.
Through their tremendous
energy they were the most able
to infuse the dance with fresh
ness and life.
Night journey the last piece
on the program, premiered the
year before Diversion, 1947.
This piece deals with the
Oedipus myth, but from Jocas
ta's point of view. The piece
has been further re-worked
since its premiere to focus on
the instant of )ocasta's death
when she sees her life given
her new knowledge from the
triumphal entry of Oedipus,
their meeting and marriage.

Most of the choreography
for )ocasta and Oedipus has
held up well, but the parts of
the chorus and the prophet,
Tiresias, seem dated. Tiresias'
entrance using his staff almost
as a pogo-stick has been called
the most unusual and exciting
entrance for a man in the
Graham repertory, but I found it
more absurd than anything
else. The chorus headed by
Peggy Lyman also danced well
but their purpose in the piece
no longer seems self evident.
Damn
In some ways, the focusing
point of the evening came dur
ing the curtain calls, forthe last
piece Night Journey. The cur
tain rose and there stood
Martha Graham, alone on
stage. She raised her arms,
bowed, and stood quiet. The
curtain came down, and when
they raised it again, Graham
was gone and the company
stood in her place.

One can not discuss modern
dance at any length without br
inging up the name of Martha
Graham. She helped to
pioneer modern dance and
developed its final real
codified movement technique
which could he taught to and
by others. After seeing her
company in 1978 though, one
felt as if he watched history
being reincarnated. The dan
cers of Martha Graham Dance
Company in performance last
Friday night at Berkeley's Zel
lerbach Auditorium, were all
strong and fresh, but one still
left thinking as much about the
woman who produced the
choreography as about its
existence as dance.
Able
The most recent piece on
the program premiered in
1977, and takes its title, O Thou
who Art About to Sing, from a
poem by St. John Perse. This
duet, danced by l.ucinda
Mitchell and Peter Sparling,
suffered most from the physi
cal limitations of the. creator.
Previously Graham had been
able to fully demonstrate as
she choreographed, but one
imagines that she was not able
to do so while choreographing
this piece.
This is partly because of
Graham's age (she was 83 at the
time) but also from the
choreography itself. The first
section relies heavily on
dramatic stances creating sex
ual tension and energy bet
ween the dancers, but the sec
ond section, after a clearly an
ticipated costume change, ran
into technical problems with
the set and costumes.
Willing
The set is by Marisol, al
though Graham designed the
costumes. Its six large block
like components arranged into
three groups mirror the
themes of the choreography. It
consisted of a couch-like piece
on which the woman reclined,
a larger triangular piece on
which the man leaned, an
over-sized bed-type platform
with associated wedge shaped
stairs, and behind it a large,

curved vertical block.
In the first section of the
piece one recalls most strongly
the dramatic intensity of
Mitchell's eyes and upper body
in general. She and Sparling
approach repeatedly, only to
dart bdck to their respective
sculptures. Finally they are
able to touch more openly as
their movements quicken
sending Mitchell whirling up
stage. Sparling then removed
Mitchell's red flowing half
dress, leaving her in a flesh
toned unifard which matches
his tights.
Flow
After some attempts to cover
herself, she traveled up the
platform, and after receiving
her costume back from Sparl
ing, Mitchell eventually disap
peared behind the large verti
cal sculpture. Sparling danced
a solo while she wrapped some
green and black material
around her. When she ap
peared on the platform again,
he went behind it, and they
emerged linked together by
the material.
Ready
Here the technical problems
began to arise. Although the
dancers managed the choreog
raphy which involved entangl
ing and then disentangling
themselves from the material,
it still seemed awkward, as if
the choreographer had
thought about it, seeing the
movement in her mind instead
of feeling it in her body. The
same problem resulted several
times when the couple
traveled down the platform
and the steps. One was more
preoccupied with worrying
whether the dancers would
safely progress down the
steeply raked surface and dif
ficult steps than with the effect
of the two dancers united pre
senting themselves to the au
dience.
Diversion of Angels, created
for the first season of the
American Dance Festival in
1948, was inspired by a line
from the work of poet Ben Be
litt. Unlike most of her works,
this piece was not designed to
include Graham, nor was it in

the dark passionate vein of
most of her contemporary
works.
Movement
This pleasant lyric dance
contains most of the classic
movements in the Graham
vocabulary. It seems some
what repetitive now, and one
wonders if one has been pre
judiced against some of the
movements simply by seeing
them too much. Graham's
technique of dance movement
based on the principal of con
traction and release of the
torso, is still the most widely
taught system of instruction in
colleges and universities and
many other dancers and
choreographers have drawn
from her movements.
