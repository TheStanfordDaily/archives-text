## Gaieties find a place on the Farm 
### 
Last year's Gaieties was both a resurrec
tion of an old Stanford tradition and an
experiment. This year's show proved that
Gaieties has found its place back on the
Farm.
Unlike its immediate predecessor,
Ram's Head's latest production followed a
story line. The problematic search for a
mascot envelops students and faculty
alike, providing a necessary and amusing
coherence throughout the parody of cam
pus Ife. "Ugh," the plot's resolution, was
somewhat anticlimatic, yet quickly gained
support and enthusiasm with the "Al
lelulia Ugh" and the appearance of the
Incomparables. And, after all, what better
resolution is there? "Ugh" embodies sa
tire and solution; it can mean anything to
anybody.
Among Gaieties' many scenes, three
displayed the best talents of the company.
"P.O. Box Blues" matched strident music,
lyrics and dance with an effective set and
striking costumes.
Weak start
"The Bookstore," after a weak start,
quickly redeemed itself. Its parody of the
expanded bookstore festivities included a
tap-dancing chorus and Michael Myers
singing an interesting composition by

Bruce Sawhill and W.A. Mozart.
Ram's Head managed to keep its integ
rity through the obligatory tribute to John
Travolta's influence on modern America
with "Disco in the City — Something's
Moving." The lighting, adequate for most
of the production, contributed to the puls
ing energy of the scene.
Delvin Cahen, Marilyn Rosenberg and
Kim Wright succeeded in attractively
choreographing action for the huge cast
Also notable were Dawn Todd, designer,
and Robbie Corthell, head seamstress, for
the dozens of costumes which contri
buted largely to the show's moods.
Flow
Complemented by an able orchestra,
the original musical score offered profes
sional qualityand stylistic variety; from the
lamenting strains of "P.O. Box Blues" to
"The Bookstore's" driving chorus, to the
clever lyrics of "Stanford Pressures."
Marty Moran negotiated a difficult com
bination of a timid character wih stage
command in his fabulous protrayal of
Charlie the Wimp. Marty became the
show's hero through song, gymnastic
moves and convincing character.
Supporting performances highlighted

the generally fine showmanship. Susan
Faye sang a beautiful "All Alone" while
Robert Coleman, head Weenie, directed
Stanford's lug-headed adversaries. Ann
Jennings' character acting, Debbie Morri
son as a tour guide, Mike Myers as an
arrogant DU, and Jim Monen as the om
nipresent Stanford professor, created en
tertaining, if not meaningful, stereotypes.
Direction
Outstanding stage direction by Pamela
Tarr, Kate Hokanson and Gary Furlong
mastered difficult crowd scenes, en
gineered necessarily complicated block
ing, and effected the peripheral character
interactions and juxtapositions.
The somewhat inconsistent set quality,
initially smothered lyrics, and occasion
ally inarticulate dialogue detracted
momentarily from Ram's Head's efforts. All
in all, however, the show's strengths and
professionalism overwhelmed these
weaknesses, especially considering the
show's purpose.
Caieties fulfilled its goal of eliciting
spirit through entertainment as success
fully as Reverend Sun Young Moon
gathers followers j — which is to say, very
well indeed. What a performance — ugh?
