Begin may accept treaty draft
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin wants to turn back the clock in negotiations
with Egypt and is ready to accept a U.S.-sponsored
dratt ot the peace treaty that his government re
jected four weeks ago, sources familiar with the
talks said yesterday.
Begin is prepared to accept a vaguely-worded
clause linking the treaty to the development of
Palestinian self-rule on the Israeli-occupied West
Bank of the )ordan River and the Gaza Strip, the
sources said.
The point of linkage in the treaty has been the
obstacle that has threatened the progress of the
talks in recent weeks.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a televi
sion interview last night that he was willing to meet
again in a summit with Begin to try to resolve the
remaining "10 percent" of problems over a peace
treaty.
Sadat also insisted that no peace treaty would be
signed that failed to deal with the Palestinian prob
lem.
Sources close to Begin, who asked not to be
identified, said the prime minister was seeking the
help of U.S. negotiators in persuading Egypt to
reverse the tougher position it adopted earlier this
month, particularly the demand for a timetable
establishing Palestinian self-rule in the occupied
lands.
Peking poster accuses Mao
Tokyo — With the appearance in Peking of a wall
poster directly attacking the late Mao Tse-tung,
Chinese leaders seem to have taken a crucial step
in a campaign to debunk the myth of infallibility
wrapped around the venerated leader.
The poster, spotted by Japanese correspon
dents in Peking on Sunday, accused the father of
China's communist revolution of backing the
purged Gang of Four rebels during a 1976 power
struggle within the Communist Party.
Posters are often used within Chinese society to
presage official changes in party policy.
The poster was believed to be the first to directly
name Mao, who died in Spetember 1976 at the age
of 82.
The poster accused Mao of backing the Gang of
Four, including Mao's widow, Chiang Ching, who
were accused of plotting to take power after Mao's
death. The four were purged from the party and
stripped of their government posts.
Diggs gets three-year sentence
Washington — U.S. Rep. Charles Diggs was or
dered yesterday to serve three years in prison for
mail fraud and making false statements after a
judge brushed aside arguments that his re
election this month meant he should be in Con
gress, not jail.
Diggs (D-Mich.) was found guilty Oct. 7 of inflat
ing the salaries of staff members and then accept

ing kickbacks from them to pay business, personal
and congressional expenses.
After yesterday's sentencing, Diggs was re
leased on personal recognizance pending an ap
nfal, his attorney, David Povirh, said.
Diggs was re-elected Nov. 7 to a 11th term in the
House of Representatives with an 80 percent vote
margin in his Detroit district despite his convic
tion.
More skid row deaths reported
Los Angeles — Police said two skid row stabbings
early yesterday were probably the work of the Skid
Row Stabber, the mysterious killer who has slain
nine transients in the past month. But both of the
latest stabbing victims will live.
The latest victims were identified as Jose.
Ramirez and Ricardo Seja, both 24. Passersby said
they saw the two bleeding men staggering along a
downtown skid row street early yesterday and cal
led an ambulance.
The two men were taken to County-USC Medi
cal Center, where Ramirez was in fair condition.
Seja was treated and released.
Like the previous nine victims of the Stabber —
all of whom died — Ramirez and Seja were knifed
in the chest and were found shortly after midnight.
But unlike the other victims, Cooke said, these
two men did not appear to be typical of the type of
transient known to frequent Skid Row.
"These two don't seem to fit the wino image of
previous victims, but the investigators haven't
ruled anything out yet," said a police spokesman.
Teachers on strike in Fresno
Fresno — Hundreds of teachers demanding
smaller maximum class sizes struck the state's
fifth-largest school district yesterday. Classes were
conducted by substitutes and instructors who
didn't strike.
The pickets paraded quietly and peacefully car
rying signs which proclaimed "Teachers on
Strike," and "Teachers Make It Happen."
The two sides provided differing reports on the
number on strike.
The administration said 1226 teachers, librarians
and nurses were on duty, 56 percent of the dis
trict's total.
But Fresno Teachers Association President
Bryan Long estimated that I M) 0 staffers, nearly 60
percent, were striking.
Student attendance totaled 58,620, and absen
tees reached 21 percent, double the normal level,
according to the administration.
Computer expert charged in theft
Los Angeles — Stanley Mark Rifkin was arraigned
yesterday on a federal indictment charging him
with the theft-by-computer of $10.2 million in
bank funds.
Rifkin, 32, a short, balding computer analyst
from suburban Sepulveda, stood in a blue denim
prison uniform before U.S. Magistrate Ralph Get

fen and said he understood his rights and the
charges against him.
But he answered a firm "no" when asked if he
wished to hear the four-count indictment against
him.
In the brief court proceedings, Rifkin's case was
assigned to U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne.
Rifkiri was to appear before Byrne later in the
day to enter a plea and have a trial date set.
The indictment, returned last week by a Los
Angeles federal grand jury, charges Rifkin with
entering a bank to commit a felony, commiting

property and smuggling.
The FBI has said Ritkin managed to transfer $10.2
million (rom Security Pacific bank to an account he
had set up in Switzerland.

nine transients in the past month. But both of the
latest stabbing victims will live.

Begin may accept treaty draft
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin wants to turn back the clock in negotiations
with Egypt and is ready to accept a U.S.-sponsored
dratt ot the peace treaty that his government re
jected four weeks ago, sources familiar with the
talks said yesterday.
Begin is prepared to accept a vaguely-worded
clause linking the treaty to the development of
Palestinian self-rule on the Israeli-occupied West
Bank of the )ordan River and the Gaza Strip, the
sources said.
The point of linkage in the treaty has been the
obstacle that has threatened the progress of the
talks in recent weeks.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a televi
sion interview last night that he was willing to meet
again in a summit with Begin to try to resolve the
remaining "10 percent" of problems over a peace
treaty.
Sadat also insisted that no peace treaty would be
signed that failed to deal with the Palestinian prob
lem.
Sources close to Begin, who asked not to be
identified, said the prime minister was seeking the
help of U.S. negotiators in persuading Egypt to
reverse the tougher position it adopted earlier this
month, particularly the demand for a timetable
establishing Palestinian self-rule in the occupied
lands.

Los Angeles — Police said two skid row stabbings
early yesterday were probably the work of the Skid
Row Stabber, the mysterious killer who has slain
nine transients in the past month. But both of the
latest stabbing victims will live.
The latest victims were identified as Jose.
Ramirez and Ricardo Seja, both 24. Passersby said
they saw the two bleeding men staggering along a
downtown skid row street early yesterday and cal
led an ambulance.
The two men were taken to County-USC Medi
cal Center, where Ramirez was in fair condition.
Seja was treated and released.
Like the previous nine victims of the Stabber —
all of whom died — Ramirez and Seja were knifed
in the chest and were found shortly after midnight.
But unlike the other victims, Cooke said, these
two men did not appear to be typical of the type of
transient known to frequent Skid Row.
"These two don't seem to fit the wino image of
previous victims, but the investigators haven't
ruled anything out yet," said a police spokesman.

Begin may accept treaty draft
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin wants to turn back the clock in negotiations
with Egypt and is ready to accept a U.S.-sponsored
dratt ot the peace treaty that his government re
jected four weeks ago, sources familiar with the
talks said yesterday.
Begin is prepared to accept a vaguely-worded
clause linking the treaty to the development of
Palestinian self-rule on the Israeli-occupied West
Bank of the )ordan River and the Gaza Strip, the
sources said.
The point of linkage in the treaty has been the
obstacle that has threatened the progress of the
talks in recent weeks.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a televi
sion interview last night that he was willing to meet
again in a summit with Begin to try to resolve the
remaining "10 percent" of problems over a peace
treaty.
Sadat also insisted that no peace treaty would be
signed that failed to deal with the Palestinian prob
lem.
Sources close to Begin, who asked not to be
identified, said the prime minister was seeking the
help of U.S. negotiators in persuading Egypt to
reverse the tougher position it adopted earlier this
month, particularly the demand for a timetable
establishing Palestinian self-rule in the occupied
lands.
Peking poster accuses Mao
Tokyo — With the appearance in Peking of a wall
poster directly attacking the late Mao Tse-tung,
Chinese leaders seem to have taken a crucial step
in a campaign to debunk the myth of infallibility
wrapped around the venerated leader.
The poster, spotted by Japanese correspon
dents in Peking on Sunday, accused the father of
China's communist revolution of backing the
purged Gang of Four rebels during a 1976 power
struggle within the Communist Party.
Posters are often used within Chinese society to
presage official changes in party policy.
The poster was believed to be the first to directly
name Mao, who died in Spetember 1976 at the age
of 82.
The poster accused Mao of backing the Gang of
Four, including Mao's widow, Chiang Ching, who
were accused of plotting to take power after Mao's
death. The four were purged from the party and
stripped of their government posts.
