# Activist discusses ERA

### ROBIN MILLINGTON 
"I will tell you the reality. There is
no rational reason for people to op
pose the ERA," a woman's activist
said here last week.
San lose attorney Joyce Sogg, a na
tional board member of the National
Organization of Women (NOW),
spoke on the Equal Rights Amend
ment at the YWCA's Brown Bag lec
ture series.
In an informal discussion, Sogg
explained why she believes the ERA
is a necessary addition to the Con
stitution.
"As yet, women have not been
recognized by the U.S. Constitution
as a special category of considera
tion."
Sogg said that the 14th Amend
ment, which prohibits racial dis
crimination, "does not offer that
same protection for sexual discrimi
nation."
Bias seen
"Race has been seen as a suspect
category by the courts, whereas
being a woman has not. The courts
have said with regard to sex discrimi
nation that the government does not
carry that burden."
Sogg cited the example of a case in
Philadelphia where a girl wanted to
attend an all-male public high
school. Legal action was taken, but
Sogg said, "The courts said no â€”
separate but equal."
This concept was thrown out by
the courts in 1954 in terms of racial
equality, she said, yet this is consi
dered a viable answer to sexual
equality. She said the ERA seeks to
change what she called a mispercep
tion of the meaning of sexual equal
ity.
"Without ERA, laws between the
states can and do vary," Sogg added.
She also listed examples of dis
criminatory practices that the ERA is
designed to rectify.
"Women only hold 2 percent of
the positions available for secondary

school principals," she said,
"whereas 63 percent of all secondary
school teachers are women."
She added that women college
professors earn an average of $3000
less than male college professors.
A quota exists for women military
enlistees, Sogg said, which means
that a great number of women are
excluded from the benefits of milit
ary service.
Sogg attacked the difference in the
way racial and sexual discrimination
have been treated.
Numbers game
Sogg also said that in terms of ra
cial discrimination, numbers are
used by the courts to determine dis
crimination. If a town is 50 percent
black and if juries are not 50 percent
black, there is obvious discrimina
tion, she said. This (percentage sys
tem) on the other hand, is not used
effectively by the courts as proof of
sexual discrimination.
"Once we have ERA, the burden of
proof of discrimination is on the
government," Sogg said. For the ERA
to become iaw, three more states
must ratify it before june 30, 1982.
"I do think a very strong push from
the White House will be necessary,
and I don't mean the little mouthing
that ERA has been given."
Sogg said "Letter writing is a criti
cal link, every single bit of the effort
enhances everything else," in the ef
fort to ratify the ERA.
"The serious myth regarding the
destruction of the family is the one
which most needs to be dispelled,"
Sogg said.
Changes
She added that even without the
ERA, the family structure is changing.
She said that the ERA might help im
prove the family unit by offering a
woman the dignity to decide
whether to become a housewife if
she chooses and to then offer her
equal benefits such as social security
that working people receive.
