# New senate districting plan underway
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
As ASSU Sen. Ted Gardenswartz
rose to speak at Arroyo's house
meeting Thursday night, someone
called out from the back of the room,
"I know you. I've seen your picture
in the bathroom."
Gardenswartz was at Arroyo as part
of the senate's new districting plan,
which if successful, should make
ASSU senators more responsive and
accessible to students than they have
been in the past.

News analysis

The districting plan, which began
last week, assigns each under
graduate senatorto a group of dorms
or row houses.
The senator is responsible for at
tending meetings and eating occa
sional meals in those livingareas, act
ing as the liaison between the senate
and that district. Each graduate
senator similarly is assigned to a
specific academic department.
Several senators have far-flung dis
tricts that may be difficult to reach,
including Steve Hansch, Manzanita
Park; Bill Nussbaum, Mirrielees; and
Uli Haller, off-campus students.
Visibility
Senate Chairperson Peter Stamos
said that the plan should make
senators more visible to students. He
added that Gardenswartz's visit to
Arroyo showed that the districting
plan is a potentially good idea.
While visiting Arroyo, Gar
denswartz was forced to do two
things that senators in recent years
rarely have undertaken. He heard
student concerns first-hand and,
perhaps more importantly, he was
asked to justify the senate's actions
to an audience.

Gardenswartz fielded questions
ranging from the Ali Bhutto guest
professorship offer to rising tuition.
One student asked what the se
nate had done in its first month that
might not have been accomplished
had the senate been abolished in Oc
tober by the CRAP amendment.
Gardenswartz answered by point
ing to the resolution inviting former
Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto here
and the financial contribution the
senate made to the Big Game Week
rally fund. He also said senators are
working on projects, including
studies of the ASSU Travel Service,
the Store and the possibility of
lighted tennis courts on campus.
Money issues
The major student concerns ex
pressed at the meeting involved
money. After Gardenswartz
explained why the senate decided to
invite Bhutto here, one student
asked how his salary would be paid.
Gardenswartz explained that the
Guest Professorship Board has
$10,000 from student fee assess
ments to pay the salaries of the in
vited professors.
The 50 freshmen in Arroyo seemed
interesting in hearing Gardenswartz.
They resisted the taunts of a
neighboring dorm to join in a pre-Big
Game shouting match long enough
to let Gardenswartz finish his 20-
minute talk.
Stamos said that, so far, the dis
tricting plan is going well. "The re
sponse (from the senators) has been
very enthusiastic," he said, "and
everyone I've spoken to has been
favorable."
Stamos added that under the plan
senators each week also are ex
pected to hold office hours in their
room and to visit at least one of their
dorms or row houses.

He said that there are no punitive
means to ensure that senators attend
to their districts, but added that "if a
senator is not doing it, he or she is
not doing their job."
The senate resolution that initiated
the districting plan states, "In the
past, there has been no organized
means through which the senate

could accurately receive and mea
sure student input."
If the districting plan is to succeed,
interest by both parties will have to
continue. This will most likely hap
pen if senators carry their dialogues
with students to their senate meet
ings and prove that they can and will
respond to student interests.
