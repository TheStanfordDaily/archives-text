# Schwartz says findings accurately told to NIH
## Counsel denies misrepresentation 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
John Schwartz, University coun
sel, yesterday denied that he told the
National Institutes of Health (NIH)
that a University committee found
Assoc. Prof, of Surgery Zolton Lucas
"not guilty of fallacious research re
porting."
Schwartz also said he told NIH that
the medical school administration
was "still attempting to have the
committee examine and resolve
some issues," but that the commit
tee never filed a second report.
Since 1973, several different allega
tions have been made regarding
Lucas' researching techniques. Be
cause Lucas was working under a
federal grant given directly to the
University, NIH began its own inves
tigation in 1975. The FBI also began
an investigation in 1977.
Lucas now is on sabbatical leave,
but investigation by NIH will con
tinue after his return in December,
according to Ralph Curens, supervis
ing auditor in the NIH division of
management and survey review.
A 1977 letter from the director of
NIH to a U.S. Senate subcommittee
reported that a University official had
informed NIH that the committee in
vestigating Lucas' research had con
cluded Lucas was not guilty.
However, a confidential commit
tee report, obtained last week by the

Daily, stated that "while the case for
fraud has not been established
beyond reasonable doubt we main
tain deep concern that some of the
work may in fact have been fraudu
lent."
"I am aware of no University offi
cial, including myself, who advised
the NIH that the committee had con
cluded that no fraud or fabrication
had occurred," Schwartz said.
He added the discrepancy could
have been due to a "misunderstand
ing."
"I can see how, through all these

years of reports and charges, the
phrase 'The committee did not find
Dr. Lucas guilty of fraud' could be
transformed to 'The committee
found Dr. Lucas not guilty of
fraud,' " Schwartz said.
The NIH also reported to the sub
committee that Schwartz had said on
May 26, 1976 that the committee
"had not completed its review," sev
eral months after the 0ct0ber2,1975
committee report was released to
medical school administrators.
"I advised the NIH then (in May)
that the Dean was still attempting to

have the committee examine and re
solve some issues," Schwartz said.
"For that purpose, subsequent
discussions were had with certain
members of the committee to de
termine what more the committee
could or would undertake to do.
"It was therefore not until many
months later that a decision was
made by the dean to move forward
with a recommendation to President
Richard Lyman without insisting on
more work by the committee,"
Schwartz said.
