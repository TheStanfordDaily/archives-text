# Soldiers hunt for cultists
## 
### 
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) —
Guyanese soldiers searched through
a steaming jungle yesterday for hun
dreds of American religious zealots
who fled their remote compound
after the suicide-murder deaths of at
least 409 fellow cultists.
All were believed to be Americans,
with most of them from California.
Among the dead were Jim Jones,
founder of the People's Temple set
tlement called Jonestown, his wife
and one of their sons. Jones and his
followers, both blacks and whites,
established the settlement last year.
Government investigators told re
porters that Jones apparently had
shot himself. They said most of the
dead apparently drank fruit-flavored
water spiked with cyanide, mixed ina
tub, but it appeared some had'
poison injected in their veins while
infants were spoon-fed the poison.
The mass deaths apparently occur
red about an hour or more after
members of the California sect,
People's Temple, ambushed a visit
ing investigative group led by U.S.
Rep. Leo Ryan (D-San Mateo), killing
Ryan and four others.
By midafternoon, soldiers re
ported counting the bodies of 163
women, 13ft men and 82 children. A
police spokesman said later that the
toll was 409 as the terrible task con
tinued at the settlement in this small
South American country tucked
below Venezuela. He said bodies still
were being found.
It was reported in Los Angeles that
prosecutors have been investigating
Jones and two People'sTempleassis
tants since May for alleged extortion
and grand theft.
Also found in the fields, huts and
communal dormitories were 17
shotguns, 14 rifles, seven pistols, a
flare gun and large amounts of am
munition, government officials said.
By dark, police and soldiers had
found only 12 survivors from among
the estimated 500 to 900 who had fled
into the bush.
Charles Kraus, a reporter for the
Washington Post, who was with the
Ryan party Saturday but escaped
death, was in a pool of journalists

permitted to return to Jonestown
with government forces yesterday.
He said )ones had been shot in the
head and was one of the few to die
from a bullet wound. Jones' body,
clothed in black pants and a colored
casual shirt, was on a stage of the
communal meeting hall, Kraus said.
Scores of bodies were packed in
the hall, a round pavilion about 120
feet in diameter with a roof but no
walls, he said, and other bodies were
in clusters outside the hall, many
with their arms around one another.
American lawyer Mark Lane, who
escaped from the jungle camp just
before the mass deaths, told repor
ters of terrifying hours he and
another attorney, Charles Garry,
spent in the camp and the rainy
jungle nearby late Saturday and Sun
day.
Lane, a prominent attorney in con
troversial cases and a legal counsel to

the sect, said he and Garry were bar
red from a mass meeting at the camp,
Jonestown, but that they heard resi
dents discussing communal suicide
over a loudspeaker. Lane said one
spoke of "the beauty of death as part
of our struggle."
The cultists reportedly had long
considered mass suicide if they felt
their sect threatened.
Lane said the meeting began at
about 5 p.m. Only 40 minutes earlier,
a half-dozen sect members am
bushed Ryan's group at a nearby
airstrip, where they were trying to fly
out some disenchanted sect mem
bers.
Lane, being guarded with Garry in
a building some distance from the
meeting, said he had heard medical
personnel were preparing poison in
a large vat somewhere in the camp.
But he said that from their vantage
point they also saw a dozen men take
"many" automatic rifles from a shed.
A Guyanese Cabinet minister said
one reason Jones was permitted to
establish his ill-fated commune in
Guyana was some 60 reference let
ters attributed to prominent Ameri
cans.
Among the names on a list re
leased by Minister of State Christ
opher Nascimento, who is visiting in
New York, were those of first lady

Rosalynn Carter; Vice President Wal
ter Mondale; the late Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.); Sens. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.) and Mike Gravel
(D-Alaska); Reps. Phillip Burton (D-
Calif.), and )onathan Bingham (D-
N.Y.); former Rep. Bella Abzug (D-
N.Y.); Joseph Caiifano, secretary of
health, education and welfare; San
Francisco Mayor George Moscone;
former San Francisco Mayor loseph
Alioto, and Roy Wilkins, a former di
rector of the NAACP.

Georgetown, Guyana (AP) —
Guyanese soldiers searched through
a steaming jungle yesterday for hun
dreds of American religious zealots
who fled their remote compound
after the suicide-murder deaths of at
least 409 fellow cultists.
All were believed to be Americans,
with most of them from California.
Among the dead were Jim Jones,
founder of the People's Temple set
tlement called Jonestown, his wife
and one of their sons. Jones and his
followers, both blacks and whites,
established the settlement last year.
Government investigators told re
porters that Jones apparently had
shot himself. They said most of the
dead apparently drank fruit-flavored
water spiked with cyanide, mixed ina
tub, but it appeared some had'
poison injected in their veins while
infants were spoon-fed the poison.
The mass deaths apparently occur
red about an hour or more after
members of the California sect,
People's Temple, ambushed a visit
ing investigative group led by U.S.
Rep. Leo Ryan (D-San Mateo), killing
Ryan and four others.
By midafternoon, soldiers re
ported counting the bodies of 163
women, 13ft men and 82 children. A
police spokesman said later that the
toll was 409 as the terrible task con
tinued at the settlement in this small
South American country tucked
below Venezuela. He said bodies still
were being found.
It was reported in Los Angeles that
prosecutors have been investigating
Jones and two People'sTempleassis
tants since May for alleged extortion
and grand theft.
Also found in the fields, huts and
communal dormitories were 17
shotguns, 14 rifles, seven pistols, a
flare gun and large amounts of am
munition, government officials said.
By dark, police and soldiers had
found only 12 survivors from among
the estimated 500 to 900 who had fled
into the bush.
Charles Kraus, a reporter for the
Washington Post, who was with the
Ryan party Saturday but escaped
death, was in a pool of journalists

permitted to return to Jonestown
with government forces yesterday.
He said )ones had been shot in the
head and was one of the few to die
from a bullet wound. Jones' body,
clothed in black pants and a colored
casual shirt, was on a stage of the
communal meeting hall, Kraus said.
Scores of bodies were packed in
the hall, a round pavilion about 120
feet in diameter with a roof but no
walls, he said, and other bodies were
in clusters outside the hall, many
with their arms around one another.
American lawyer Mark Lane, who
escaped from the jungle camp just
before the mass deaths, told repor
ters of terrifying hours he and
another attorney, Charles Garry,
spent in the camp and the rainy
jungle nearby late Saturday and Sun
day.
Lane, a prominent attorney in con
troversial cases and a legal counsel to

the sect, said he and Garry were bar
red from a mass meeting at the camp,
Jonestown, but that they heard resi
dents discussing communal suicide
over a loudspeaker. Lane said one
spoke of "the beauty of death as part
of our struggle."
The cultists reportedly had long
considered mass suicide if they felt
their sect threatened.
Lane said the meeting began at
about 5 p.m. Only 40 minutes earlier,
a half-dozen sect members am
bushed Ryan's group at a nearby
airstrip, where they were trying to fly
out some disenchanted sect mem
bers.
Lane, being guarded with Garry in
a building some distance from the
meeting, said he had heard medical
personnel were preparing poison in
a large vat somewhere in the camp.
But he said that from their vantage
point they also saw a dozen men take
"many" automatic rifles from a shed.
A Guyanese Cabinet minister said
one reason Jones was permitted to
