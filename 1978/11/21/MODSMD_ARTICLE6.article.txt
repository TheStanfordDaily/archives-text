# Gutenberg shuttle service may end
## 
### BILL POWEL 
The Gutenberg Express library
shuttle between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley has excluded under
graduate passengers since Sep
tember. Now it's possible the pas
senger service will be cut entirely.
Regardless of the Gutenberg's
fate, some University personnel are
arguing for establishment of a shuttle
which would be available to all stu
dents. They are concerned by the ab
sence of convenient transportation
between the schools.
The Gutenberg shuttle program
may end in June, if a previous deci
sion on the bus' fate is finalized next
month, according to Anne Seeley,
coordinator of the UC-Berkeley/
Stanford Research Library Program.
"It has become too expensive to
maintain the bus service for the strict
usage of library materials," Seeley
said. However, she added that she
hopes the inter-campus exchange of
specialized books and expensive
microfilms will continue next year.
Instead of the present 11-passenger
vans, station wagons could be used
to save money, she said.
In September, the 11-passenger
vans replaced 33-passenger buses. At
the same time, rules were adopted
which limited express users to fa
culty, academic staff and graduate
students with both special identifica
tion cards and reservations.

Since the regulations took effect,
registered participants have in
creased 15 percent.
Bus reservations have been consis
tently full for the shuttle's 8:30 a.m.
and 3:15 p.m. runs, but at most only
half full for the 10:30 a.m. and 1:15
p.m. trips, according to Martha
Lacey, office assistant for the
privileges-services division here.
Perhaps because of the empty
seats the privileges-services division
has received as many as five inquiries
daily about buying spaces on standby
basis, a staff supervisor said.
The change in rules and the prop
osed termination of the Gutenberg
has worried many who relied upon
the shuttle service.
Charles Delzell, a mathematics
graduate student here, had planned
to use the express, so he could take
courses at Stanford and Berkeley. In
a memo to the University provost's
office, he said he had tried all availa
ble means of public transportation.
In eacli case, he found that the cost
and lengthy trips made it impossible
to attend classes on both campuses.
Delzell proposed a Stanford-
Berkeley shuttle bus, like the Guten
berg, to allow students and faculty to
commute between the two cam
puses. He said that this would be "in
the best interests of both schools to
share all of their resources."

vans, station wagons could be used
to save money, she said.
In September, the 11-passenger
vans replaced 33-passenger buses. At
the same time, rules were adopted
which limited express users to fa
culty, academic staff and graduate
students with both special identifica
tion cards and reservations.

Since the regulations took effect,
registered participants have in
creased 15 percent.
Bus reservations have been consis
tently full for the shuttle's 8:30 a.m.
and 3:15 p.m. runs, but at most only
half full for the 10:30 a.m. and 1:15
p.m. trips, according to Martha
Lacey, office assistant for the
privileges-services division here.
Perhaps because of the empty
seats the privileges-services division
has received as many as five inquiries
daily about buying spaces on standby
basis, a staff supervisor said.
The change in rules and the prop
osed termination of the Gutenberg
has worried many who relied upon
the shuttle service.
Charles Delzell, a mathematics
graduate student here, had planned
to use the express, so he could take
courses at Stanford and Berkeley. In
a memo to the University provost's
office, he said he had tried all availa
ble means of public transportation.
In eacli case, he found that the cost
and lengthy trips made it impossible
to attend classes on both campuses.
Delzell proposed a Stanford-
Berkeley shuttle bus, like the Guten
berg, to allow students and faculty to
commute between the two cam
puses. He said that this would be "in
the best interests of both schools to
share all of their resources."
