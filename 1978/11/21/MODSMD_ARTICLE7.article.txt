# World hunger myths described

### MATT METTLER 
"Scarcity of food is not the
reason that people in Third World
countries are hungry," Frances
Moore Lappe told an audience of
several hundred in Memorial Au
ditorium last night.
"There is an abundance of food
in the world â€” even in countries
believed to be basketcases like
Bangladesh," Lappe said.
Lappe is co-founder of the Insti
tute for Food and Development
Policy in San Francisco. She has
written the book, Diet for a Small
Planet, and more recently co
authored Food First: Beyond the
Myth of Scarcity.
There are four myths about
world hunger, Lappe said. First is
that there isn't enough food.
The second myth is that the
answer to alleviating world
hunger is increasing food produc
tion, Lappe said. Because agricul
ture is seen as a growth industry,
she said, the prices of farmland all
over the world are rising dramati
cally. Peasants, driven off their
land by high prices, then go hun
gry for lack of food, she
explained.

Lappe added that the "process
of attacking hunger has actually
aggravated the problem." Inter
national aid agencies, such as AID
and the World Bank, say they want
to help the small farmers, but they
define the small farmers as those
who own 100 acres or less.
Someone owning this amount
of land may be a small farmer in
the United States, but in Third
World countries he is part of the
landholding elite, Lappe said. Aid
targeted to these people only
works to maintain the status quo,
which keeps peasants from being
able to feed themselves, she said.
The third myth, Lappe said, is
that hunger is caused by greedy
Americans. A major obstacle that
prevents needed change is
people who believe that for Third
World countries to advance, the
United States must step back.
Lappe said the fourth myth is
that "we can't challenge the status
quo in Third World countries be
cause equality is a luxury we can't
afford. Inequality itself generates
inefficiency in utilizing re
sources," Lappe said.

When you have 3 percent of the
people controlling 80 percent of
the land, she said, the profit from
the landless laborers will go to the
few who spend it on luxury goods
and conspicuous consumption.
So, landless people in these coun
tries don't have the money to buy
the food their own country pro
duces.
Additionally, unequal land dis
tribution leads to land being
"wasted" producing cash crops
for export, rather than growing
food for local inhabitants, Lappe
said.
Lappe concluded by saying that
America's role is not to go into
Third World countries and try to
set things right, but to help indi
genous struggles for agrarian re
form that will help alleviate
hunger.
Lappe's talk was one of the
events of the Stanford Food
Week, to be held through Wed
nesday. Other activities include
panel discussions on world
hunger and food, and a voluntary
fast day which began last night at
midnight.
