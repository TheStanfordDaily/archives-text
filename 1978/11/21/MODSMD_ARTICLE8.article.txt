# Rape: legal, psychological social implications

(Editor's note: This is the
second of two articles on rape
and rape prevention at the Uni
versity. The first in the series
appeared yesterday.)
One American woman in 10
is raped at some point during
her lifetime. Inevitably, a sub
tantial proportion of these as
saults take place on college
campuses. While rape preven
tion education opportunities
here may help individual
women to become aware of
the rape problem, perhaps
even enabling them to escape
from dangerous situations, the
possibility of an encounter con
tinues to frighten many wo
men. How and where do rapes
occur? How do women deal
with sexual assault?
"There is no way to (a) pre
vent it and (b) get out of it,"
says Lori Palmer, coordinator
of the University Rape Educa
tion Project (REP). Preventive
measures must be accom
panied by follow-up action be
fore rape will be stopped, she

said.
"People have to realize that
some rapes just can't be pre
vented," comments Leah Kap
lan, assistant dean of student
affairs. "Like the attempt not
long ago on campus, you can't
fight four or five men off
alone."
Kaplan noted that though
studies indicate that most rape
victims resist their attackers,
women are overpowered or
threatened into submission 80
percent of the time. In fact,
rapists typically seek to rape
the most vulnerable-looking,
rather than the most attractive
or provocatively-dressed wo
men. In from 60 to 70 percent
of all rape cases, both the vic
tim and location of an assault
are premeditated. Though at
tacks in isolated areas, such as
the paths circling Lake Lagunita
and the Dish or isolated park
ing lots and deserted build
ings, are often assumed to be
high risk rape locations, at
tacks in such areas account for
only one-half of all rapes. The

remaining 50 percent occur in
homes, apartments or dor
mitories. Many are "date
rapes," in which the victim and
attacker know each other as
friends, lovers, even spouses.
California Penal Code pre
sently requires proof that the
woman demonstrated a clear
"lack of consent." This re
quirement angers feminists,
who argue that women who
are threatened with a weapon
or a beating are often too
frightened to protest effec
tively. Additionally, California
legally defines rape as penile
penetration during sexual in
tercourse, which some argue is
too narrow a definition.
"Any intimacy forced on a
woman is rape," says Maria
Sakovich, rape prevention ad
vocate at UC-Berkeley.
"The victim's definition of
rape may differ from the legal
one. Many rapists are not even
aware they've raped a woman;
they may call up a week later
asking for a date. They may
threaten not to drive their date

home unless she consents to
sex," Sakovich added. In this
sense, agrees one REP
facilitator here, rape laws fail to
treat wedded rape seriously
enough. "Rape laws are like
property laws," she says. "A
man in this state can't be con
victed of raping his wife —
she's his property, his thing."
After a rape, particularly
when the victim is acquainted
with her attacker, she is often
ashamed or humilimated,

another REP leader said. For
this reason, most rapes are not
reported to proper authorities.
"Particularly women of college
age don't know what to do,"
says Raoul Niemeyer, Stanford
Department of Public Safety
police officer in charge of in
vestigating rape cases. "How
do they explain it to their pa
rents, especially if they were in
a situation where they weren't
using 'good common sense?'
Maybe they're ashamed that
they were out late at night
alone, and here is someone tel
ling them that they're stupid,
just when they need help."
Niemeyer said the rape divi
sion of the police department
here handles the initial contact
and investigation for the Uni
versity. He also said that no
rapes have been officially re
ported this year. One reason

for this is that women might
have a stereotyped image of
policemen as "callous and un
caring, like television charac
ters who say 'I want only the
facts, ma'am, just the facts.' In
the past, police officers have
treated rape as just another
crime, which only accentuates
the feeling of a woman whose
own body has been violated,"
Niemeyer said. At the Univer
sity, he added, inroads have
been made in solving this prob
lem. "Most of the officers have
been given sensitivity training
in the last five years. We'd love
to have more women on the
squad for a variety of reasons,
but recruiting them is some
what of a problem. Even larger
departments have a heck of a
time finding more women be
cause, frankly, it isn't pleasant
to work on rape cases."
If a rape is reported.
Niemeyer said his office im
mediately dispatches an officer
to get a report on the location
and type of assault. "Women
generally do the follow-up be
cause most men feel uncom
fortable asking all the lurid de
tails."
After a rough description of
the assault and its cir
cumstances has been filed with
the police department, victims
are given emergency medical
examinations at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. Treatment
for injuries, blood tests for ve
nereal disease, and "morning
after" anti-pregnancy pills are
administrered as needed. Ad
ditionally, a psychological
counselor from Cowell's
Counseling and Psychological
Services division is available
round-the-clock.
"It is so important for
women to work through the

feelings they have," em
phasized Norma Velez, coun
selor at Huston House, Cow
ell's psychological counseling
center. "We work from where
the individual woman is at, be
cause if a woman comes in and
is willing to talk things out, talk
ing seems to resolve many of
the problems — if not by clear
ing them up, at least by lighten
ing them. The main thing is to
put rape in a place where it
doesn't dominate everything
else in a woman's life, where it
won't make her feel ugly and
defiled."
Counseling by women who
have been rape victims is also
available, Kaplan said. "Some
of the women I know who
handled it got a distance on it
and are now part of a kind of

secret network that works
through me," she said. "They
counsel more recent victims
who can benefit from their ex
periences in recovering. That
helps both of them — it in
volves both in working with
their feelings."
Often, Kaplan added, men
who are friends or relatives of a
rape victim feel confused and
shut out of the counseling pro
cess. "I get many calls person
ally from male students or fa

culty members whose wives or
girlfriends have been raped
and who are at a loss to be
helpful. And sometimes I get
calls from people who know I
care and am concerned, asking
me to funnel information to
the police without naming any
names, so the police can try to
find the rapist."
Because few women "press
charges" against suspected
rapists, few are actually con
victed and even fewer serve
time in prison. Additionally,
the "lack of consent" require
ment in California and the dif
ficulty of reliving a rape during
court testimony convince
many women not to take their
cases to court. Others fear re
taliation and some feel that jail

of rapists will not solve the rape
problem. Even more com
monly, women are struggling
to come to terms with their
own feelings.
"It is very important for a
woman to have some avenue
of action," argues Sakovich.
"Some want punishment or re
venge, but then, putting a
rapist in prison won't necessar
ily help. What do you do with a
rapist? That's another whole
question altogether."

of all rape cases, both the vic

are premeditated. Though at

"Particularly women of college

says Raoul Niemeyer, Stanford
Department of Public Safety

Niemeyer said the rape divi

Sakovich, rape prevention ad
vocate at UC-Berkeley.
"The victim's definition of
rape may differ from the legal
one. Many rapists are not even
aware they've raped a woman;
they may call up a week later
asking for a date. They may
threaten not to drive their date

home unless she consents to
sex," Sakovich added. In this
sense, agrees one REP
facilitator here, rape laws fail to
treat wedded rape seriously
enough. "Rape laws are like
property laws," she says. "A
man in this state can't be con
victed of raping his wife —
she's his property, his thing."
After a rape, particularly
when the victim is acquainted
with her attacker, she is often
ashamed or humilimated,

another REP leader said. For
this reason, most rapes are not
reported to proper authorities.
"Particularly women of college
age don't know what to do,"
says Raoul Niemeyer, Stanford
Department of Public Safety
police officer in charge of in
vestigating rape cases. "How
do they explain it to their pa
rents, especially if they were in
a situation where they weren't
using 'good common sense?'
Maybe they're ashamed that
they were out late at night
alone, and here is someone tel
ling them that they're stupid,
just when they need help."
Niemeyer said the rape divi
sion of the police department
here handles the initial contact
and investigation for the Uni
versity. He also said that no
rapes have been officially re
ported this year. One reason

for this is that women might
have a stereotyped image of
policemen as "callous and un
caring, like television charac
ters who say 'I want only the
facts, ma'am, just the facts.' In
the past, police officers have
treated rape as just another
crime, which only accentuates
the feeling of a woman whose
own body has been violated,"
Niemeyer said. At the Univer
sity, he added, inroads have
been made in solving this prob
lem. "Most of the officers have
been given sensitivity training
in the last five years. We'd love
to have more women on the
squad for a variety of reasons,
but recruiting them is some
what of a problem. Even larger
departments have a heck of a
time finding more women be
cause, frankly, it isn't pleasant
to work on rape cases."
If a rape is reported.
Niemeyer said his office im
mediately dispatches an officer
to get a report on the location
and type of assault. "Women
generally do the follow-up be
cause most men feel uncom
fortable asking all the lurid de
tails."
After a rough description of
the assault and its cir
cumstances has been filed with
the police department, victims
are given emergency medical
examinations at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. Treatment
for injuries, blood tests for ve
nereal disease, and "morning
after" anti-pregnancy pills are
administrered as needed. Ad
ditionally, a psychological
counselor from Cowell's
Counseling and Psychological
Services division is available
round-the-clock.
"It is so important for
women to work through the

feelings they have," em
phasized Norma Velez, coun
selor at Huston House, Cow
ell's psychological counseling
center. "We work from where
the individual woman is at, be
cause if a woman comes in and
is willing to talk things out, talk
ing seems to resolve many of
the problems — if not by clear
ing them up, at least by lighten
ing them. The main thing is to
put rape in a place where it
doesn't dominate everything
else in a woman's life, where it
won't make her feel ugly and
defiled."
Counseling by women who
have been rape victims is also
available, Kaplan said. "Some
of the women I know who
handled it got a distance on it
and are now part of a kind of

secret network that works
through me," she said. "They
counsel more recent victims
who can benefit from their ex
periences in recovering. That
helps both of them — it in
volves both in working with
their feelings."
Often, Kaplan added, men
who are friends or relatives of a
rape victim feel confused and
shut out of the counseling pro
cess. "I get many calls person
ally from male students or fa

culty members whose wives or
girlfriends have been raped
and who are at a loss to be
helpful. And sometimes I get
calls from people who know I
care and am concerned, asking
me to funnel information to
the police without naming any
names, so the police can try to
find the rapist."
Because few women "press
charges" against suspected
rapists, few are actually con
victed and even fewer serve
time in prison. Additionally,
the "lack of consent" require
ment in California and the dif
ficulty of reliving a rape during
court testimony convince
many women not to take their
cases to court. Others fear re
taliation and some feel that jail

of rapists will not solve the rape
problem. Even more com
monly, women are struggling
to come to terms with their
own feelings.
"It is very important for a
woman to have some avenue
of action," argues Sakovich.
"Some want punishment or re
venge, but then, putting a
rapist in prison won't necessar
ily help. What do you do with a
rapist? That's another whole
question altogether."
(Editor's note: This is the
second of two articles on rape
and rape prevention at the Uni
versity. The first in the series
appeared yesterday.)
One American woman in 10
is raped at some point during
her lifetime. Inevitably, a sub
tantial proportion of these as
saults take place on college
campuses. While rape preven
tion education opportunities
here may help individual
women to become aware of
the rape problem, perhaps
even enabling them to escape
from dangerous situations, the
possibility of an encounter con
tinues to frighten many wo
men. How and where do rapes
occur? How do women deal
with sexual assault?
"There is no way to (a) pre
vent it and (b) get out of it,"
says Lori Palmer, coordinator
of the University Rape Educa
tion Project (REP). Preventive
measures must be accom
panied by follow-up action be
fore rape will be stopped, she

said.
"People have to realize that
some rapes just can't be pre
vented," comments Leah Kap
lan, assistant dean of student
affairs. "Like the attempt not
long ago on campus, you can't
fight four or five men off
alone."
Kaplan noted that though
studies indicate that most rape
victims resist their attackers,
women are overpowered or
threatened into submission 80
percent of the time. In fact,
rapists typically seek to rape
the most vulnerable-looking,
rather than the most attractive
or provocatively-dressed wo
men. In from 60 to 70 percent
of all rape cases, both the vic
tim and location of an assault
are premeditated. Though at
tacks in isolated areas, such as
the paths circling Lake Lagunita
and the Dish or isolated park
ing lots and deserted build
ings, are often assumed to be
high risk rape locations, at
tacks in such areas account for
only one-half of all rapes. The

remaining 50 percent occur in
homes, apartments or dor
mitories. Many are "date
rapes," in which the victim and
attacker know each other as
friends, lovers, even spouses.
California Penal Code pre
sently requires proof that the
woman demonstrated a clear
"lack of consent." This re
quirement angers feminists,
who argue that women who
are threatened with a weapon
or a beating are often too
frightened to protest effec
tively. Additionally, California
legally defines rape as penile
penetration during sexual in
tercourse, which some argue is
too narrow a definition.
"Any intimacy forced on a
woman is rape," says Maria
Sakovich, rape prevention ad
vocate at UC-Berkeley.
"The victim's definition of
rape may differ from the legal
one. Many rapists are not even
aware they've raped a woman;
