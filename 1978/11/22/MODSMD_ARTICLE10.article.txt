# Energy-conscious campus groups sponsor New Ways Holidays fair

Megawatt hairdryers,
shaving cream warmers,
food processors and peel
ing wands — Christmas sea
son must be in the air. "But
here we are again, worrying
about what gift to buy each
person. We inevitably end
up with items wasteful of
energy and materials, disre
gardful of the environment
and lacking a part of ourse
lves," Karl Johnson, direc
tor of the University Energy
Conservation Center, said.

People's extravagant lifes
tyles create problems for ac
tive energy-conserving in
dividuals, who wish to alert
people to slow down energy
consumption, he added.
One program planned to
counter the lack of aware
ness of conservation's im
portance is a celebration
called New Ways Holidays,
to be held Nov. 28 and 29 at
Tresidder Union. "The
overall concept of the
celebration is a focus on the
holiday to get people to
focus on activities they're
doing that affect the envi
ronment," Johnson said.
"As the increasingly
commercial holidays move
away from concern about
people, they also show dis
regard for energy and the
environment. The ethic of
conservation, recycling and
ecology seems to disappear
under the onslaught of ever
more energy-intensive gift
items and disposable deco
rations," he added.
The holidays project,
sponsored by the Energy
Conservation Center, ASSU
Recycling Center and sev
eral University co-ops and
living groups, will consist of
many "interactive booths."
Both on-campus and off
campus organizations will
design the booths.
Participants can make
candles, cards and wrap
ping paper. Bread-making,
bike maintenance and re
pair and many other crea
tive arts will be emphasized
at various booths. "The idea
behind these booths is for
people to have some per
sonal input into their

Christmas presents and pro
jects. We're encouraging
people to counter all the
plastic and aluminum pac
kaging that is used so com
monly by wrapping things in
cloth, paper, scrap fabric
and cutouts from
magazines," Johnson said.
In addition to these on
campus organized booths,
approximately 10 outside
groups will be selling vari
ous devices and magazines
that relate to energy con
servation, Johnson said.
Johnson estimates that
the entire project will cost
$250, though participants
will not pay fees for the
crafts they make at each
booth. Currently, each Uni
versity co-op house is pur
chasing supplies for its
booth. If funds are raised,
these groups will be paid
back for their pre-fair ex
penses. But Johnson said
that funding for the fair "is
not clearly defined at this
point." SCIRE may give
some money.
The Energy Conservation
Center will also be selling
"Do it in the dark. Save
energy" t-shirts.
Johnson said the center
also plans to develop a slide
show to be presented to var
ious dorm groups later this
year. Joel Swisher, a
graduate student who
works at the center, said,
"So far we've just been talk
ing to people in dorms. The
slide show will provide
some visual impact as well."
The slides will be taken both
on and off campus. "We
want to show how people
can easily integrate conser

vation measures into their
lives," Johnson said.
"Without a change in lifes
tyles, I think there will be
some kind of an energy
crisis very soon," senior
Laura Carlson, a worker at
the center, said.
Over the Thanksgiving
holiday, "people can just
unplug their clocks and re
frigerators. That will make a
big difference, we've found
out," Johnson said. Other
measures people can adopt
include: turning lights off
when leaving a room; tak
ing short showers and low
ering the force of the water;
opening curtains during the
day to allow for heat and
light absorption and closing
them at night; using
brooms and carpet sweep
ers rather than electric vac
uums; turning down ther
mostats; and unplugging
typewriters, hot pots, irons,
televisions and the like
when they are not in use.
Johnson said that stu
dents' use of "even minia
ture refrigerators" creates
huge amounts of energy us
age.
Dorm education projects
continue. The center has
found volunteers to read
electric meters and report
the findings to dorm mem
bers. "This hopefully will
continue to alert people It's
kind of like a man who
jumped off a building. We
too have already jumped.
The sooner we grab on, and
find out how much we need
to conserve energy, the bet
ter off we'll be."

Johnson said the center
also plans to develop a slide
show to be presented to var
ious dorm groups later this
year. Joel Swisher, a
graduate student who
works at the center, said,
"So far we've just been talk
ing to people in dorms. The
slide show will provide
some visual impact as well."
The slides will be taken both
on and off campus. "We
want to show how people
can easily integrate conser

vation measures into their
lives," Johnson said.
"Without a change in lifes
tyles, I think there will be
some kind of an energy
crisis very soon," senior
Laura Carlson, a worker at
the center, said.
Over the Thanksgiving
holiday, "people can just
unplug their clocks and re
frigerators. That will make a
big difference, we've found
out," Johnson said. Other
measures people can adopt
include: turning lights off
when leaving a room; tak
ing short showers and low
ering the force of the water;
opening curtains during the
day to allow for heat and
light absorption and closing
them at night; using
brooms and carpet sweep
ers rather than electric vac
uums; turning down ther
mostats; and unplugging
typewriters, hot pots, irons,
televisions and the like
when they are not in use.
Johnson said that stu
dents' use of "even minia
ture refrigerators" creates
huge amounts of energy us
age.
Dorm education projects
continue. The center has
found volunteers to read
electric meters and report
the findings to dorm mem
bers. "This hopefully will
continue to alert people It's
kind of like a man who
jumped off a building. We
too have already jumped.
The sooner we grab on, and
find out how much we need
to conserve energy, the bet
ter off we'll be."
Megawatt hairdryers,
shaving cream warmers,
food processors and peel
ing wands — Christmas sea
son must be in the air. "But
here we are again, worrying
about what gift to buy each
person. We inevitably end
up with items wasteful of
energy and materials, disre
gardful of the environment
and lacking a part of ourse
lves," Karl Johnson, direc
tor of the University Energy
Conservation Center, said.

People's extravagant lifes
tyles create problems for ac
tive energy-conserving in
dividuals, who wish to alert
people to slow down energy
consumption, he added.
One program planned to
counter the lack of aware
ness of conservation's im
portance is a celebration
called New Ways Holidays,
to be held Nov. 28 and 29 at
Tresidder Union. "The
overall concept of the
celebration is a focus on the
holiday to get people to
focus on activities they're
doing that affect the envi
ronment," Johnson said.
"As the increasingly
commercial holidays move
away from concern about
people, they also show dis
regard for energy and the
environment. The ethic of
conservation, recycling and
ecology seems to disappear
under the onslaught of ever
more energy-intensive gift
items and disposable deco
rations," he added.
The holidays project,
sponsored by the Energy
Conservation Center, ASSU
Recycling Center and sev
eral University co-ops and
living groups, will consist of
many "interactive booths."
Both on-campus and off
campus organizations will
design the booths.
Participants can make
candles, cards and wrap
ping paper. Bread-making,
bike maintenance and re
pair and many other crea
tive arts will be emphasized
at various booths. "The idea
behind these booths is for
people to have some per
sonal input into their

Christmas presents and pro
jects. We're encouraging
people to counter all the
plastic and aluminum pac
kaging that is used so com
monly by wrapping things in
cloth, paper, scrap fabric
and cutouts from
magazines," Johnson said.
In addition to these on
campus organized booths,
approximately 10 outside
groups will be selling vari
ous devices and magazines
that relate to energy con
servation, Johnson said.
Johnson estimates that
the entire project will cost
$250, though participants
will not pay fees for the
crafts they make at each
booth. Currently, each Uni
versity co-op house is pur
chasing supplies for its
booth. If funds are raised,
these groups will be paid
back for their pre-fair ex
penses. But Johnson said
that funding for the fair "is
not clearly defined at this
point." SCIRE may give
some money.
The Energy Conservation
Center will also be selling
"Do it in the dark. Save
energy" t-shirts.
