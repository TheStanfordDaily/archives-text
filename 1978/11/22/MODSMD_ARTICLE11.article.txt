# Scream machines: a frightening delight
## 
### ANDY RICH 
With the weather rainy as it's
been lately, this may seem like
a peculiar time to write about
roller coasters. Indeed, the ski
slopes are probably more on
your mind than amusement
parks. But over the long
Thanksgiving weekend you
might find yourself bored, and
ready to chance the weather
for one last screaming swing
with your favorite thrill ride.
Marriott's Great America
amusement park will be wind
ing up its 1978 season this
weekend. Located south on In
terstate 101 in Santa Clara, this
park boasts five major roller
coaster rides. The newest is the
Tidal Wave, a shuttle loop
coaster that catapults riders
from zero to 50 mph in less

than five seconds, through a
76-feet-high loop, which roc
kets up a 140 feet incline. Then
what? Well, you admire the
view for an instant, then re
turning through the loop
again, this time backwards!
Bob Cordell, one of the many
students here who has visited
Great America, said, "The Tidal
Wave's incredible, especially
when it goes backwards. It's
more terrifying than the nor
mal rides."
Other scream machines
there include The Turn of the
Century and Willard's Whiz
zer. The Turn of the Century
combines "the ups and downs
of conventional coasters with
two 360-degree barrel roll
loops." People agree that the
"ups and downs" on that ride

are so devastating that you
barely have time to react to the
tandem loops! Willard's Whiz
zer is engineered for speed
and steeply banked turns.
But surprisingly, the most
popular attraction at Marriott's
this season was not a roller
coaster, but the Logger's Run,
one of two water log flume
rides in the park.
For those heading south to
Los Angeles this weekend,
Magic Mountain and Knott's
Berry Farm offer several coas
ters. Knott's has recently
opened Montezooma's Re
venge, a shuttle loop similar to
the Tidal Wave. Like its north
ern cousin, Revenge carries 28
people on a 30-second, high
way speed ride through a verti
cal loop and back. Junior Bill
Nussbaum, said, Montezoo
ma's Revenge is "the most in
tense ride I've been on,"
among Southern California
rides. Passengers in the front
car on these rides experience
six times the force of gravity
when they enter the loop, than
occupants of the other cars.

riately!
Magic Mountain, off In
terstate 5 in Valencia, is out to
set records. Their two most
impressive "white-knucklers"
are the Revolution and Colos
sus, both hailed as the largest
coasters in their class. Statistics
back up these claims. The Re
volution is a two-minute ride
on 3657 feet of steel track,
featuring a 360-degree, 90-feet
high vertical loop, a lengthy
tunnel, and a ride through the
center of the same loop. A ride
in the front car of the Revolu
tion at night is alleged to be "a
most spectacular experience."
Colossus, however, might
conceivably top even the Re
volution. A new, wooden coas
ter, it rests on 10 acres of land
in the Magic Mountain Park. A
ride on one of its double tracks
takes 3Vi minutes. The cars
travel more than 60 mph and
riders experience weightless
ness 11 times! A few more in
credible statistics: the first two
drops on Colossus are 115 and

105 feet. Spokesmen at the
park say no other coaster fea
tures two drops of that height.
Construction took 150,000 man
hours, over one million board
feet of lumber, and about $6
million.
In a class of its own is Disney
land. A theme oriented park, it
contains two particularly fam
ous rides which can be consi
dered roller coasters: the Mat
terhorn and Space Mountain.
Disneyland's landmark, the
Matterhorn has entertained 74
million people in its 19-year
history. This scale model of the
Swiss mountain was recently
reopened after nine months of
renovation, and now sports
many new features. Ridership
capacity has been increased,
and the "previously barren in
terior has been chilled, deco
rated, and even inhabited,"
Disneyland sources say.
Space Mountain, which took
two years to construct, opened
in May 1977 and quickly be
came Disneyland's most popu
lar attraction. The 3500-feet
long ride recreates many of the
feelings and sights of space
travel. Students' reactions to
this technological wonder are
varied, yet consistently favora
ble. Says junior Betsy Hoover,
a West Covina resident, "I
liked Space Mountain because
it was sort of like Star Wars
. . . only I hated Star Wars."
Robert Fomon, another Los
Angeles resident, added, "It's
the best because it's in the
dark. If you go stoned you just
start screaming because you
can't see anything; when you
come through the end you just
freak. It's a blast!"
The roller coaster has come a
long way. Born in Russia as an
artificial ice slide in the 17th
century, it matured first into
sleds on rollers, then wheeled
cars on tracks as its popularity
spread throughout Europe. In
1870 the idea jumped the Atlan
tic to Coney Island and has de
veloped since then to its pre
sent form. One can only wait
with expectation and an open
imagination for the future
forms of the great scream
machines.


Those who ride the slick slopes of Disneyland's Matterhorn adven
ture not only have quick dips and sharp turns to watch for, but also
must face the chilling presence of the lurking Abominable Snowman.

more terrifying than the nor
mal rides."
Other scream machines
there include The Turn of the
Century and Willard's Whiz
zer. The Turn of the Century
combines "the ups and downs
of conventional coasters with
two 360-degree barrel roll
loops." People agree that the
"ups and downs" on that ride

are so devastating that you
barely have time to react to the
tandem loops! Willard's Whiz
zer is engineered for speed
and steeply banked turns.
But surprisingly, the most
popular attraction at Marriott's
this season was not a roller
coaster, but the Logger's Run,
one of two water log flume
rides in the park.
For those heading south to
Los Angeles this weekend,
Magic Mountain and Knott's
Berry Farm offer several coas
ters. Knott's has recently
opened Montezooma's Re
venge, a shuttle loop similar to
the Tidal Wave. Like its north
ern cousin, Revenge carries 28
people on a 30-second, high
way speed ride through a verti
cal loop and back. Junior Bill
Nussbaum, said, Montezoo
ma's Revenge is "the most in
tense ride I've been on,"
among Southern California
rides. Passengers in the front
car on these rides experience
six times the force of gravity
when they enter the loop, than
occupants of the other cars.

Magic Mountain, off In
terstate 5 in Valencia, is out to
set records. Their two most
impressive "white-knucklers"
are the Revolution and Colos
sus, both hailed as the largest
coasters in their class. Statistics
back up these claims. The Re
volution is a two-minute ride
on 3657 feet of steel track,
featuring a 360-degree, 90-feet
high vertical loop, a lengthy
tunnel, and a ride through the
center of the same loop. A ride
in the front car of the Revolu
tion at night is alleged to be "a
most spectacular experience."
Colossus, however, might
conceivably top even the Re
volution. A new, wooden coas
ter, it rests on 10 acres of land
in the Magic Mountain Park. A
ride on one of its double tracks
takes 3Vi minutes. The cars
travel more than 60 mph and
riders experience weightless
ness 11 times! A few more in
credible statistics: the first two
drops on Colossus are 115 and

105 feet. Spokesmen at the
park say no other coaster fea
tures two drops of that height.
Construction took 150,000 man
hours, over one million board
feet of lumber, and about $6
million.
In a class of its own is Disney
land. A theme oriented park, it
contains two particularly fam
ous rides which can be consi
dered roller coasters: the Mat
terhorn and Space Mountain.
Disneyland's landmark, the
Matterhorn has entertained 74
million people in its 19-year
history. This scale model of the
Swiss mountain was recently
reopened after nine months of
renovation, and now sports
many new features. Ridership
capacity has been increased,
and the "previously barren in
terior has been chilled, deco
rated, and even inhabited,"
Disneyland sources say.
Space Mountain, which took
two years to construct, opened
in May 1977 and quickly be
came Disneyland's most popu
lar attraction. The 3500-feet
long ride recreates many of the
feelings and sights of space
travel. Students' reactions to
this technological wonder are
varied, yet consistently favora
ble. Says junior Betsy Hoover,
a West Covina resident, "I
liked Space Mountain because
it was sort of like Star Wars
. . . only I hated Star Wars."
Robert Fomon, another Los
Angeles resident, added, "It's
the best because it's in the
dark. If you go stoned you just
start screaming because you
can't see anything; when you
come through the end you just
freak. It's a blast!"
The roller coaster has come a
long way. Born in Russia as an
artificial ice slide in the 17th
century, it matured first into
sleds on rollers, then wheeled
cars on tracks as its popularity
spread throughout Europe. In
1870 the idea jumped the Atlan
tic to Coney Island and has de
veloped since then to its pre
sent form. One can only wait
with expectation and an open
imagination for the future
forms of the great scream
machines.


Those who ride the slick slopes of Disneyland's Matterhorn adven
ture not only have quick dips and sharp turns to watch for, but also
must face the chilling presence of the lurking Abominable Snowman.

With the weather rainy as it's

ma's Revenge is "the most in

among Southern California
rides. Passengers in the front

occupants of the other cars.

Magic Mountain, off In
terstate 5 in Valencia, is out to
set records. Their two most
impressive "white-knucklers"
are the Revolution and Colos
sus, both hailed as the largest
coasters in their class. Statistics
back up these claims. The Re
volution is a two-minute ride
on 3657 feet of steel track,
featuring a 360-degree, 90-feet
high vertical loop, a lengthy
tunnel, and a ride through the
center of the same loop. A ride
in the front car of the Revolu
tion at night is alleged to be "a
most spectacular experience."
Colossus, however, might
conceivably top even the Re
volution. A new, wooden coas
ter, it rests on 10 acres of land
in the Magic Mountain Park. A
ride on one of its double tracks
takes 3Vi minutes. The cars
travel more than 60 mph and
riders experience weightless
ness 11 times! A few more in
credible statistics: the first two
drops on Colossus are 115 and

105 feet. Spokesmen at the
park say no other coaster fea
tures two drops of that height.
Construction took 150,000 man
hours, over one million board
feet of lumber, and about $6
million.
In a class of its own is Disney
land. A theme oriented park, it
contains two particularly fam
ous rides which can be consi
dered roller coasters: the Mat
terhorn and Space Mountain.
Disneyland's landmark, the
Matterhorn has entertained 74
million people in its 19-year
history. This scale model of the
Swiss mountain was recently
reopened after nine months of
renovation, and now sports
many new features. Ridership
capacity has been increased,
and the "previously barren in
terior has been chilled, deco
rated, and even inhabited,"
Disneyland sources say.
Space Mountain, which took
two years to construct, opened
in May 1977 and quickly be
came Disneyland's most popu
lar attraction. The 3500-feet
long ride recreates many of the
feelings and sights of space
travel. Students' reactions to
this technological wonder are
varied, yet consistently favora
ble. Says junior Betsy Hoover,
a West Covina resident, "I
liked Space Mountain because
it was sort of like Star Wars
. . . only I hated Star Wars."
Robert Fomon, another Los
Angeles resident, added, "It's
the best because it's in the
dark. If you go stoned you just
start screaming because you
can't see anything; when you
come through the end you just
freak. It's a blast!"
The roller coaster has come a
long way. Born in Russia as an
artificial ice slide in the 17th
century, it matured first into
sleds on rollers, then wheeled
cars on tracks as its popularity
spread throughout Europe. In
1870 the idea jumped the Atlan
tic to Coney Island and has de
veloped since then to its pre
sent form. One can only wait
with expectation and an open
imagination for the future
forms of the great scream
machines.


Those who ride the slick slopes of Disneyland's Matterhorn adven
ture not only have quick dips and sharp turns to watch for, but also
must face the chilling presence of the lurking Abominable Snowman.

With the weather rainy as it's
been lately, this may seem like
a peculiar time to write about
roller coasters. Indeed, the ski
slopes are probably more on
your mind than amusement
parks. But over the long
Thanksgiving weekend you
might find yourself bored, and
ready to chance the weather
for one last screaming swing
with your favorite thrill ride.
Marriott's Great America
amusement park will be wind
ing up its 1978 season this
weekend. Located south on In
terstate 101 in Santa Clara, this
park boasts five major roller
coaster rides. The newest is the
Tidal Wave, a shuttle loop
coaster that catapults riders
from zero to 50 mph in less

than five seconds, through a
76-feet-high loop, which roc
kets up a 140 feet incline. Then
what? Well, you admire the
view for an instant, then re
turning through the loop
again, this time backwards!
Bob Cordell, one of the many
students here who has visited
Great America, said, "The Tidal
Wave's incredible, especially
when it goes backwards. It's
more terrifying than the nor
mal rides."
Other scream machines
there include The Turn of the
Century and Willard's Whiz
zer. The Turn of the Century
combines "the ups and downs
of conventional coasters with
two 360-degree barrel roll
loops." People agree that the
"ups and downs" on that ride

are so devastating that you
barely have time to react to the
tandem loops! Willard's Whiz
zer is engineered for speed
and steeply banked turns.
But surprisingly, the most
popular attraction at Marriott's
this season was not a roller
coaster, but the Logger's Run,
one of two water log flume
rides in the park.
For those heading south to
Los Angeles this weekend,
Magic Mountain and Knott's
Berry Farm offer several coas
ters. Knott's has recently
opened Montezooma's Re
venge, a shuttle loop similar to
the Tidal Wave. Like its north
ern cousin, Revenge carries 28
people on a 30-second, high
way speed ride through a verti
cal loop and back. Junior Bill
Nussbaum, said, Montezoo
ma's Revenge is "the most in
tense ride I've been on,"
among Southern California
