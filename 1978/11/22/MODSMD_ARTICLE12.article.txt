## David Miller 'Christmas spirit' 
### 
In a few weeks we will enter upon the begin
ning of the Christmas holiday season. If experi
ence be a guide, we may expect to hear once
again the time-worn complaints about the
over-commercialization of Christmas.
Were the untiring critics who yearly issue
these complaints merely pointing out that some
people exert so much effort on holiday-related
activities that they make themselves miserable,
the critics' point would be well made. That is
not, however, their central point.
The implicit (and often explicit) purpose of
most of those who cavil at the commercializa
tion of Christmas is to encourage people to take
Christmas seriously. Their purpose is to encour
age an increasingly post-Christian world to re
turn to Christianity.
The simplest response to such would-be re
vivalists is to point out that Christianity is false.
The gospels according to Matthew and Luke
cannot even agree on Jesus' genealogy; the dis
agreement begins with the father of Joseph.
Both events and teachings differ in order and
content among the four gospels.
Christianity is clearly one of several examples
(another is Mahayana Buddhism) of the false
divinization of a religious teacher some time
after his death.
Yet, many people who know or vaguely sense
that Christianity is literally false feel that belief in
its doctrines is of moral or social value. Such a
view is unfounded.
For example, if men of good will were to take
the dictum to "turn the other cheek," seriously,
the result would be to place the world at the
mercy of thieves, tyrants, and murderers. The
doctrine of unconditional non-resistance
should be forever discredited by the example of
the Jewish failure to resist Hitler.
Through the ages, Christianity has exalted the
love of Cod and the love of others and denig
rated the love of self. Such apparent altru ism has
often masked hypocrisy. It has been, however,
most dangerous when sincere: the man who
will unflinchingly sacrifice himself forthe loveof
Cod or the good of humanity will hardly be
reluctant to sacrifice others for the same ends.
Christianity erects an impossible code of

morality in its insistence on selflessness, in its
antipathy to material pleasures, in its absurd
declaration that to feel anger and to commit
murder (or to lust in one's heart and to commit
adultery) are crimes of equal weight. The result
of this impossible code of morality, of the insis
tence that men are unavoidably sinners regard
less of their personal efforts, and of the promise
that any sin will be forgiven, is to convince men
that living morally is neither possible nor neces
sary.
The result of Christian morality is that men do
not live up to those standards of decency and
morality which are possible and desirable and
appropriate to the life of man on earth.
One should not be surprised that the existen
tial consequences of Christian morality have in
cluded the Inquisition, the Crusades, the mas
sacre of heretics and Jews, witchhunts and the
wars of religion.
Nietzsche was right; Christianity is a religion
fit only for slaves. It is a religion for those who
reject personal autonomy and responsibility, for
those who refuse to think for themselves or
make their own moral decisions.
Christianity is factually untrue, morally repul
sive and existentially disastrous.
Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to send
peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a
sword. For I am come to set a man at variance
against his father, and the daughter against her
mother. . ."Those words accurately sum up the
historical reality of the Christian religion.
Let us instead pursue the goal, so alien to
historical Christianity, expressed in the words
ef in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis —
"and on earth peace to men of good will."
During the coming holiday season, let us
enjoy decorating Christmas trees or seeing old
friends or recalling the pretty stories, myths,
and carols that have grown up around Christ
mas.
But let us — for our own sake and the sake of
humankind — reject the entreaties of those who
would have us take Christmas and the Christian
religion seriously.
