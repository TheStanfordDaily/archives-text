## Graduate housing problems 
### 
There is no question that
traditionally one of the impor
tant attractions of the Univer
sity for prospective graduate
students has been the possibil
ity of living in Escondido Vil
lage (EV). Its combination of
low and high rise units, excel
lent sports facilities and playg
rounds, good maintenance
services and a flexible, respon
sive administrative structure
have made it possible to de
velop a type of graduate stu
dent residential community
not found at any other major
U.S. univeristy.
Unfortunately, University
policies being enacted at this
very moment may bring about
the end of Escondido Village as
we have known it until now.
Until three years ago,
grounds maintenance in the
Village was under the direct
supervision of the EV office;
according to what long time re
sidents of the Village say, it
worked very well. Atthat point,
all grounds maintenance
within the University was cen
tralized. Since then, costs have
gone up at a rate of 20 percent a
year and the services have de
teriorated considerably.
In marked contrast to
grounds services, buildings
maintenance, under the direct
supervision of the EV office,
has continued to provide ex
cellent, quick service'. We may,
however, have seen the last of
it. Encouraged by the double
"success" of spiraling costs (20
percent a year) and deteriorat
ing services in grounds
maintenance, the University
has proceeded to centralize
buildings maintenance in EV,
as of November 1.
If EV's housing arrange
ments are well suited for mar
ried graduate students, with
and without children, they are
less appropriate for single
graduates, who have to share
one apartment. There has been
a long recognized need to
build, within the Village, hous
ing that is suited for single
graduate students. The Uni
veristy, however, will have
none of it. Although 82 percent
of undergraduates live on
campus and less than one third
of graduate students do so,
priority has been given to addi
tional undergraduate housing.
A recent report to the Board of
Trustees recommended build
ing 500 to 800 new units of un
dergraduate housing on cam
pus, at a total cost of $15-25
million. A measure of the prior
ity that the University gives to
its 4,0003 single graduate stu
dents as far as housing policy is
concerned, is that the report
considers them to provide "a
very substantial buffer against
future fluctuations in under
graduate housing demand."
(Campus Report, Nov. 15).

But there is more. Not only
are there no plans to build new
housing for single graduate
students, but the report re
commends that once under
graduates move into the new
dorms, single graduate stu
dents may be granted the
privilege of moving into the
trailers of Manzanita, which, as
we all know, are the worst ac
comodations on campus, and
should have been replaced by
proper housing a long time
ago.
Incredible ?s it may sound,
the University plans to do this
by having EV residents share
the cost of new undergraduate
housing. Under the new "cen
tralize everything" policies, in
the future the rent in EV will no
longer be calculated on the
basis of paying off the debt of
EV buildings, the cost of ser
vices, maintenance and
utilities; it will also include a
percentage covering the cost
of new buildings within the
University. Whether this will
initially include only hew hous
ing or all new buildings is not
entirely clear.
One of the great virtues of
this University is that it has
been able to curb the unba
lanced expansionist tenden
cies that affected so many uni
versities during the '60s. Total
centralization, however, may
be as destructive of a university
community as unbalanced
growth. What we are witnes
sing in Escondido Village today
is a good example of its per
nicious effects. The EV office
has been until now in many
ways a model of a responsive,
flexible, efficient administra
tive unit, located within the Vil
lage itself, with an extremely
competent and dedicated staff;
it has been geared to provide
the best services to a highly di
verse gradaute community.
Yet, it is being slowly stripped
of its responsibilities. Not only
have grounds and building
maintenance been reallo
cated; the EV office manager
position has been vacant since
June, and many people believe
that a new manager will not be
appointed at all.
The writing is on the wall:
the ultimate outcome of all this
may be to close the EV office,
and have its responsibilities
performed by some employee
in Encina or the Old Union. EV
residents with any problems
will have to ask for an ap
pointment with weeks in ad
vance, and after six months
some action may be taken on
the matter. We will be paying
$500 a month for a one bed
room apartment, single
graduates will have adapted
themselves to live in trailers,
and only a few will remember
the good days when EV was an
enjoyable place to live.

This scenario need not come
about. Common sense may
still prevail. Let us not destroy
the Village as it has existed
until now. Three steps that the
University could take im
mediately in this regard are:
1. Restore building mainte
nance responsibilities to the EV
Office.
2. Fill the Escondido Village
manager position that has
been vacant for five months.
3. Assure residents that EV
rents will continue to be calcu
lated on the basis of EV costs,
not on overall University hous
ing building costs.
Once these steps are taken,
EV residents and the University
administration can again start
cooperating on the present
and future needs of Escondido
Village. For the moment, how
ever, the very commitment of
the University to provide
graduate housing at affordable
prices is in question.

has proceeded to centralize
buildings maintenance in EV,
as of November 1.
If EV's housing arrange
ments are well suited for mar
ried graduate students, with
and without children, they are
less appropriate for single
graduates, who have to share
one apartment. There has been
a long recognized need to
build, within the Village, hous
ing that is suited for single
graduate students. The Uni
veristy, however, will have
none of it. Although 82 percent
of undergraduates live on
campus and less than one third
of graduate students do so,
priority has been given to addi
tional undergraduate housing.
A recent report to the Board of
Trustees recommended build
ing 500 to 800 new units of un
dergraduate housing on cam
pus, at a total cost of $15-25
million. A measure of the prior
ity that the University gives to
its 4,0003 single graduate stu
dents as far as housing policy is
concerned, is that the report
considers them to provide "a
very substantial buffer against
future fluctuations in under
graduate housing demand."
(Campus Report, Nov. 15).

But there is more. Not only
are there no plans to build new
housing for single graduate
students, but the report re
commends that once under
graduates move into the new
dorms, single graduate stu
dents may be granted the
privilege of moving into the
trailers of Manzanita, which, as
we all know, are the worst ac
comodations on campus, and
should have been replaced by
proper housing a long time
ago.
Incredible ?s it may sound,
the University plans to do this
by having EV residents share
the cost of new undergraduate
housing. Under the new "cen
tralize everything" policies, in
the future the rent in EV will no
longer be calculated on the
basis of paying off the debt of
EV buildings, the cost of ser
vices, maintenance and
utilities; it will also include a
percentage covering the cost
of new buildings within the
University. Whether this will
initially include only hew hous
ing or all new buildings is not
entirely clear.
One of the great virtues of
this University is that it has
been able to curb the unba
lanced expansionist tenden
cies that affected so many uni
versities during the '60s. Total
centralization, however, may
be as destructive of a university
community as unbalanced
growth. What we are witnes
sing in Escondido Village today
is a good example of its per
nicious effects. The EV office
has been until now in many
ways a model of a responsive,
flexible, efficient administra
tive unit, located within the Vil
lage itself, with an extremely
competent and dedicated staff;
it has been geared to provide
the best services to a highly di
verse gradaute community.
Yet, it is being slowly stripped
of its responsibilities. Not only
have grounds and building
maintenance been reallo
cated; the EV office manager
position has been vacant since
June, and many people believe
that a new manager will not be
appointed at all.
The writing is on the wall:
the ultimate outcome of all this
may be to close the EV office,
and have its responsibilities
performed by some employee
in Encina or the Old Union. EV
residents with any problems
will have to ask for an ap
pointment with weeks in ad
vance, and after six months
some action may be taken on
the matter. We will be paying
$500 a month for a one bed
room apartment, single
graduates will have adapted
themselves to live in trailers,
and only a few will remember
the good days when EV was an
enjoyable place to live.

This scenario need not come
about. Common sense may
still prevail. Let us not destroy
the Village as it has existed
until now. Three steps that the
University could take im
mediately in this regard are:
1. Restore building mainte
nance responsibilities to the EV
Office.
2. Fill the Escondido Village
manager position that has
been vacant for five months.
3. Assure residents that EV
rents will continue to be calcu
lated on the basis of EV costs,
not on overall University hous
ing building costs.
Once these steps are taken,
EV residents and the University
administration can again start
cooperating on the present
and future needs of Escondido
Village. For the moment, how
ever, the very commitment of
the University to provide
graduate housing at affordable
prices is in question.
(Norma Heine is treasurer for
the Escondido Village Coun

There is no question that
traditionally one of the impor
tant attractions of the Univer
sity for prospective graduate
students has been the possibil
ity of living in Escondido Vil
lage (EV). Its combination of
low and high rise units, excel
lent sports facilities and playg
rounds, good maintenance
services and a flexible, respon
sive administrative structure
have made it possible to de
velop a type of graduate stu
dent residential community
not found at any other major
U.S. univeristy.
Unfortunately, University
policies being enacted at this
very moment may bring about
the end of Escondido Village as
we have known it until now.
Until three years ago,
grounds maintenance in the
Village was under the direct
supervision of the EV office;
according to what long time re
sidents of the Village say, it
worked very well. Atthat point,
all grounds maintenance
within the University was cen
tralized. Since then, costs have
gone up at a rate of 20 percent a
year and the services have de
teriorated considerably.
In marked contrast to
grounds services, buildings
maintenance, under the direct
supervision of the EV office,
has continued to provide ex
cellent, quick service'. We may,
however, have seen the last of
it. Encouraged by the double
"success" of spiraling costs (20
percent a year) and deteriorat
ing services in grounds
maintenance, the University
has proceeded to centralize
buildings maintenance in EV,
as of November 1.

we all know, are the worst ac
comodations on campus, and
should have been replaced by
proper housing a long time
ago.
Incredible ?s it may sound,
the University plans to do this
by having EV residents share
the cost of new undergraduate
housing. Under the new "cen
tralize everything" policies, in
the future the rent in EV will no
longer be calculated on the
basis of paying off the debt of
EV buildings, the cost of ser
vices, maintenance and
utilities; it will also include a
percentage covering the cost
of new buildings within the
University. Whether this will
initially include only hew hous
ing or all new buildings is not
entirely clear.
One of the great virtues of
this University is that it has
been able to curb the unba
lanced expansionist tenden
cies that affected so many uni
versities during the '60s. Total
centralization, however, may
be as destructive of a university
community as unbalanced
growth. What we are witnes
sing in Escondido Village today
is a good example of its per
nicious effects. The EV office
has been until now in many
ways a model of a responsive,
flexible, efficient administra
tive unit, located within the Vil
lage itself, with an extremely
competent and dedicated staff;
it has been geared to provide
the best services to a highly di
verse gradaute community.
Yet, it is being slowly stripped
of its responsibilities. Not only
have grounds and building
maintenance been reallo
cated; the EV office manager
position has been vacant since
June, and many people believe
that a new manager will not be
appointed at all.
The writing is on the wall:
the ultimate outcome of all this
may be to close the EV office,
and have its responsibilities
performed by some employee
in Encina or the Old Union. EV
residents with any problems
will have to ask for an ap
pointment with weeks in ad
vance, and after six months
some action may be taken on
the matter. We will be paying
$500 a month for a one bed
room apartment, single
graduates will have adapted
themselves to live in trailers,
and only a few will remember
the good days when EV was an
enjoyable place to live.

This scenario need not come
about. Common sense may
still prevail. Let us not destroy
the Village as it has existed
until now. Three steps that the
University could take im
mediately in this regard are:
1. Restore building mainte
nance responsibilities to the EV
Office.
2. Fill the Escondido Village
manager position that has
been vacant for five months.
3. Assure residents that EV
rents will continue to be calcu
lated on the basis of EV costs,
not on overall University hous
ing building costs.
Once these steps are taken,
EV residents and the University
administration can again start
cooperating on the present
and future needs of Escondido
Village. For the moment, how
ever, the very commitment of
the University to provide
graduate housing at affordable
prices is in question.

There is no question that
traditionally one of the impor
tant attractions of the Univer
sity for prospective graduate
students has been the possibil
ity of living in Escondido Vil
lage (EV). Its combination of
low and high rise units, excel
lent sports facilities and playg
rounds, good maintenance
services and a flexible, respon
sive administrative structure
have made it possible to de
velop a type of graduate stu
dent residential community
not found at any other major
U.S. univeristy.
Unfortunately, University
policies being enacted at this
very moment may bring about
the end of Escondido Village as
we have known it until now.
Until three years ago,
grounds maintenance in the
Village was under the direct
supervision of the EV office;
according to what long time re
sidents of the Village say, it
worked very well. Atthat point,
all grounds maintenance
within the University was cen
tralized. Since then, costs have
gone up at a rate of 20 percent a
year and the services have de
teriorated considerably.
In marked contrast to
grounds services, buildings
maintenance, under the direct
supervision of the EV office,
has continued to provide ex
cellent, quick service'. We may,
however, have seen the last of
it. Encouraged by the double
"success" of spiraling costs (20
percent a year) and deteriorat
ing services in grounds
maintenance, the University
has proceeded to centralize
buildings maintenance in EV,
as of November 1.
If EV's housing arrange
ments are well suited for mar
ried graduate students, with
and without children, they are
less appropriate for single
graduates, who have to share
one apartment. There has been
a long recognized need to
build, within the Village, hous
ing that is suited for single
graduate students. The Uni
veristy, however, will have
none of it. Although 82 percent
of undergraduates live on
campus and less than one third
of graduate students do so,
priority has been given to addi
tional undergraduate housing.
A recent report to the Board of
Trustees recommended build
ing 500 to 800 new units of un
dergraduate housing on cam
pus, at a total cost of $15-25
million. A measure of the prior
ity that the University gives to
its 4,0003 single graduate stu
dents as far as housing policy is
concerned, is that the report
considers them to provide "a
very substantial buffer against
future fluctuations in under
graduate housing demand."
(Campus Report, Nov. 15).

But there is more. Not only
are there no plans to build new
housing for single graduate
students, but the report re
commends that once under
graduates move into the new
dorms, single graduate stu
dents may be granted the
privilege of moving into the
trailers of Manzanita, which, as
we all know, are the worst ac
comodations on campus, and
should have been replaced by
proper housing a long time
