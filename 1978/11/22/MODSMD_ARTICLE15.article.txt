## Consider Bhutto throughly 
### 
The ASSU Senate has offered a guest
professorship to Mr. Ali Bhutto. The impli
cations for Pakistan's future are not insig
nificant. iris therefore necessary to avoid a
hasty decision and to investigate the pros
and cons in some detail.
It is conceivable that in its enthusiasm to
stand up for human rights the senate
might perhaps have made a rash decision.
At best it seems to have confused the two
issues that are relevant: the demand for a
fair trial and the offer of a guest professor
ship. It is not clear that one follows from
the other. The demand for a fair trial and
the concern with human rights is to be
lauded. It goes without saying that one
would ask for a fair trial for any political
leader who is overthrown in the world,
irrespective of caste, color or creed. It
does not immediately follow that one
would invite them as guest professors at
the University.
It is thus clear that the two issues are
separate. It is therefore sufficient to con
centrate on the criteria which
ensure eligibility for selection as a
professor and on the process which sees
that these criteria are properly applied.
The selection forany majorposition at the
University (academic or otherwise) is usu
ally made on the recommendation of a
Search Committee. The committee
record of all candidates with
great thoroughness and only after it is
completely satisfied, sometimes after
months, does it announce its decisions.
In the present case, the senate was ap
proached by Rep. Pete McCloskey on
Tuesday. By Thursday night, agreement
had been reached and the decision was
announced in the Daily on Friday. A deci
sion which could have far-reaching con
sequences was made with such obvious
abandon. Does this unanimous decision
reflect perfect knowledge, perfect ignor
ance or a lack of regard for a remote coun
try buried somewhere in Asia? Objectivity
requries that such cases be examined care
fully before rather than after taking a
stance on them.
The initiative for the proposal came
from Congressman McCloskey and was
supported by Ramsey Clark. Is that
enough recommendation? Given time a
similar number of equally qualified people
would condemn the proposal. Even
otherwise post-Watergate history has re
minded us that the words of politicians
have to be weighed carefully.

However, the argument should not de
generate into a pro- or anti-Bhutto debate.
The point is that his record must be inves
tigated and evaluated agianst the criteria
reserved to apply to such selections. This
has not been done. There is enough doubt
to make it a possibility that the choice
might well be a poor one. In that case the
student body would have been used, the
stature of the University would suffer and
possible complications could ensue for
Pakistan.
Senate members and interested readers
would find it useful to refer to recent is
sues of the Asian Survey, a journal pub
lished at UC-Berkeley (Bhutto's alma ma
ter), to form their own opinions about the
events in Pakistan and Bhutto's role.
Another useful source is the Amnesty In
ternational report on Pakistan published
in 1976. If it is determined that Bhutto qual
ifies to be a member of the faculty at the
University he should be invited by all
means. Being "young, charismatic and
western educated'' is not enough. It
should not be forgotten that Bruce
Franklin lost his professorship at the Uni
versity for lesser crimes than Bhutto is ac
cused of.
All of us wholeheartedly support the
demand that everyone should receive a
fair trial. We should equally support the
contention that public officials should be
accountable for their acts. The senate
should not act to short-circuit this process
in Pakistan. Bhutto is not a prisoner of
conscience. He is largely a victim of his
own political actions. Pakistan deserves an
explanation so that it is spared similar
crises in the future. However, the manner
in which Bhutto's case is being handled
makes it obvious that something is very
wrong withthe mechanism by which polit
ical personalities are made to explain their
actions.
Bhutto would have been executed with
out a trial in half the countries of the
world. In a good many he would have
been hidden away for life (who remem
bers that Ben Bella still lives in Algeria or
Dr. Subandrio in Indonesia). In some he
might have received a pardon and become
a millionaire but it is not clear if that is
necessarily a better solution.
A worthwhile cause for the senate, while
petitioning the Pakistan government for a
fair trial for Bhutto, would be to investigate
mechanisms to ensure fair trials for all
public officials. Perhaps politicans such as
Bhutto could be tried under the auspices

ofa U.N. agency orthe International Court
of Justice. That would be a real contribu
tion in the battle to further human rights.
If one concedes that Bhutto might pos
sibly be guilty of the crimes which he is
accused of, one should consider the con
sequences of the senate's action on the
future of Pakistan. Such an honour bes
towed by one of the most prestigious uni
veristies in the bastion of democracy, the
heart of the free world, would be a tre
mendous political card in hands of any
politician. If by any chance an unscrupul
ous politician is handed that card it would
spell havoc and disaster for the country.
Given Bhutto's brilliant oratory and a 70
percent illiterate audience that looks up to
the U.S. for moral leadership, a disclaimer
at the end of the ASSU's resolution not
condoning Bhutto's acts would be worse
than meaningless. If, however, Bhutto is
innocent and the government is bent on
executing him, as is being claimed, a mere
invitation is not going to deter the au
thorities who are more likely to consider it
a provocation. In such a difficult cir
cumstance it is best not to prejudge the
situation and to await the decision of the
court.
Contrary to Michael 11 onomides' asser
tion that "executions in Pakistan follow
the final verdict almost immediately"
(Daily, Oct. 9), there has been no inci
dence of such a happening in the case ofa
political prisoner in the history of the
country. In the interim, the senate should
impress upon the U.N., the U.S. and
European governments to use their
enormous leverage to prevent such a
tragic eventuality.
The United States already has a poor
reputation for supporting tyrannical re
gimes in the Third World. The negative
feelings of people would be strengthened
if this Univeristy makes a wrong decision.
Fortunately, students in the U.S. are be
coming more conscious of happenings in
the rest of the world. Today they would
protest if an anti-people personality is in
vited from Latin America simply because
they are much more aware of the politics
of Latin America. Their relative ignorance
of Asian and Pakistan should not be an
excuse for misusing their good intentions
and good faith. Norshould the fate of mill
ions of oppressed Pakistanis be toyed with
in such casual manner.

Dr. Subandrio in Indonesia). In some he
might have received a pardon and become
a millionaire but it is not clear if that is
necessarily a better solution.
A worthwhile cause for the senate, while
petitioning the Pakistan government for a
fair trial for Bhutto, would be to investigate
mechanisms to ensure fair trials for all
public officials. Perhaps politicans such as
Bhutto could be tried under the auspices

ofa U.N. agency orthe International Court
of Justice. That would be a real contribu
tion in the battle to further human rights.
If one concedes that Bhutto might pos
sibly be guilty of the crimes which he is
accused of, one should consider the con
sequences of the senate's action on the
future of Pakistan. Such an honour bes
towed by one of the most prestigious uni
veristies in the bastion of democracy, the
heart of the free world, would be a tre
mendous political card in hands of any
politician. If by any chance an unscrupul
ous politician is handed that card it would
spell havoc and disaster for the country.
Given Bhutto's brilliant oratory and a 70
percent illiterate audience that looks up to
the U.S. for moral leadership, a disclaimer
at the end of the ASSU's resolution not
condoning Bhutto's acts would be worse
than meaningless. If, however, Bhutto is
innocent and the government is bent on
executing him, as is being claimed, a mere
invitation is not going to deter the au
thorities who are more likely to consider it
a provocation. In such a difficult cir
cumstance it is best not to prejudge the
situation and to await the decision of the
court.
Contrary to Michael 11 onomides' asser
tion that "executions in Pakistan follow
the final verdict almost immediately"
(Daily, Oct. 9), there has been no inci
dence of such a happening in the case ofa
political prisoner in the history of the
country. In the interim, the senate should
impress upon the U.N., the U.S. and
European governments to use their
enormous leverage to prevent such a
tragic eventuality.
The United States already has a poor
reputation for supporting tyrannical re
gimes in the Third World. The negative
feelings of people would be strengthened
if this Univeristy makes a wrong decision.
Fortunately, students in the U.S. are be
coming more conscious of happenings in
the rest of the world. Today they would
protest if an anti-people personality is in
vited from Latin America simply because
they are much more aware of the politics
of Latin America. Their relative ignorance
of Asian and Pakistan should not be an
excuse for misusing their good intentions
and good faith. Norshould the fate of mill
ions of oppressed Pakistanis be toyed with
in such casual manner.

The ASSU Senate has offered a guest
professorship to Mr. Ali Bhutto. The impli
cations for Pakistan's future are not insig
nificant. iris therefore necessary to avoid a
hasty decision and to investigate the pros
and cons in some detail.
It is conceivable that in its enthusiasm to
stand up for human rights the senate
might perhaps have made a rash decision.
At best it seems to have confused the two
issues that are relevant: the demand for a
fair trial and the offer of a guest professor
ship. It is not clear that one follows from
the other. The demand for a fair trial and
the concern with human rights is to be
lauded. It goes without saying that one
would ask for a fair trial for any political
leader who is overthrown in the world,
irrespective of caste, color or creed. It
does not immediately follow that one
would invite them as guest professors at
the University.
It is thus clear that the two issues are
separate. It is therefore sufficient to con
centrate on the criteria which
ensure eligibility for selection as a
professor and on the process which sees
that these criteria are properly applied.
The selection forany majorposition at the
University (academic or otherwise) is usu
ally made on the recommendation of a
Search Committee. The committee
record of all candidates with
great thoroughness and only after it is
completely satisfied, sometimes after
months, does it announce its decisions.
In the present case, the senate was ap
proached by Rep. Pete McCloskey on
Tuesday. By Thursday night, agreement
had been reached and the decision was
announced in the Daily on Friday. A deci
sion which could have far-reaching con
sequences was made with such obvious
abandon. Does this unanimous decision
reflect perfect knowledge, perfect ignor
ance or a lack of regard for a remote coun
try buried somewhere in Asia? Objectivity
requries that such cases be examined care
fully before rather than after taking a
stance on them.
The initiative for the proposal came
from Congressman McCloskey and was
supported by Ramsey Clark. Is that
enough recommendation? Given time a
similar number of equally qualified people
would condemn the proposal. Even
otherwise post-Watergate history has re
minded us that the words of politicians
have to be weighed carefully.

However, the argument should not de
generate into a pro- or anti-Bhutto debate.
The point is that his record must be inves
tigated and evaluated agianst the criteria
reserved to apply to such selections. This
has not been done. There is enough doubt
to make it a possibility that the choice
might well be a poor one. In that case the
student body would have been used, the
stature of the University would suffer and
possible complications could ensue for
Pakistan.
Senate members and interested readers
would find it useful to refer to recent is
sues of the Asian Survey, a journal pub
lished at UC-Berkeley (Bhutto's alma ma
ter), to form their own opinions about the
events in Pakistan and Bhutto's role.
Another useful source is the Amnesty In
ternational report on Pakistan published
in 1976. If it is determined that Bhutto qual
ifies to be a member of the faculty at the
University he should be invited by all
means. Being "young, charismatic and
western educated'' is not enough. It
should not be forgotten that Bruce
Franklin lost his professorship at the Uni
versity for lesser crimes than Bhutto is ac
cused of.
All of us wholeheartedly support the
demand that everyone should receive a
fair trial. We should equally support the
contention that public officials should be
accountable for their acts. The senate
should not act to short-circuit this process
in Pakistan. Bhutto is not a prisoner of
conscience. He is largely a victim of his
own political actions. Pakistan deserves an
explanation so that it is spared similar
crises in the future. However, the manner
in which Bhutto's case is being handled
makes it obvious that something is very
wrong withthe mechanism by which polit
ical personalities are made to explain their
actions.
Bhutto would have been executed with
out a trial in half the countries of the
world. In a good many he would have
been hidden away for life (who remem
bers that Ben Bella still lives in Algeria or
Dr. Subandrio in Indonesia). In some he
might have received a pardon and become
a millionaire but it is not clear if that is

months, does it announce its decisions.
In the present case, the senate was ap
proached by Rep. Pete McCloskey on
Tuesday. By Thursday night, agreement
had been reached and the decision was
announced in the Daily on Friday. A deci
sion which could have far-reaching con
sequences was made with such obvious
abandon. Does this unanimous decision
reflect perfect knowledge, perfect ignor
ance or a lack of regard for a remote coun
try buried somewhere in Asia? Objectivity
requries that such cases be examined care
fully before rather than after taking a
stance on them.
The initiative for the proposal came
from Congressman McCloskey and was
supported by Ramsey Clark. Is that
enough recommendation? Given time a
similar number of equally qualified people
would condemn the proposal. Even
otherwise post-Watergate history has re
minded us that the words of politicians
have to be weighed carefully.

However, the argument should not de
generate into a pro- or anti-Bhutto debate.
The point is that his record must be inves
tigated and evaluated agianst the criteria
reserved to apply to such selections. This
has not been done. There is enough doubt
to make it a possibility that the choice
might well be a poor one. In that case the
student body would have been used, the
stature of the University would suffer and
possible complications could ensue for
Pakistan.
Senate members and interested readers
would find it useful to refer to recent is
sues of the Asian Survey, a journal pub
lished at UC-Berkeley (Bhutto's alma ma
ter), to form their own opinions about the
events in Pakistan and Bhutto's role.
Another useful source is the Amnesty In
ternational report on Pakistan published
in 1976. If it is determined that Bhutto qual
ifies to be a member of the faculty at the
University he should be invited by all
means. Being "young, charismatic and
western educated'' is not enough. It
should not be forgotten that Bruce
Franklin lost his professorship at the Uni
versity for lesser crimes than Bhutto is ac
cused of.
All of us wholeheartedly support the
demand that everyone should receive a
fair trial. We should equally support the
contention that public officials should be
accountable for their acts. The senate
should not act to short-circuit this process
in Pakistan. Bhutto is not a prisoner of
conscience. He is largely a victim of his
own political actions. Pakistan deserves an
explanation so that it is spared similar
crises in the future. However, the manner
in which Bhutto's case is being handled
makes it obvious that something is very
wrong withthe mechanism by which polit
ical personalities are made to explain their
actions.
Bhutto would have been executed with
out a trial in half the countries of the
world. In a good many he would have
been hidden away for life (who remem
bers that Ben Bella still lives in Algeria or
Dr. Subandrio in Indonesia). In some he
might have received a pardon and become
a millionaire but it is not clear if that is
necessarily a better solution.
A worthwhile cause for the senate, while
petitioning the Pakistan government for a
fair trial for Bhutto, would be to investigate
mechanisms to ensure fair trials for all
public officials. Perhaps politicans such as
Bhutto could be tried under the auspices

ofa U.N. agency orthe International Court
of Justice. That would be a real contribu
tion in the battle to further human rights.
If one concedes that Bhutto might pos
sibly be guilty of the crimes which he is
accused of, one should consider the con
sequences of the senate's action on the
future of Pakistan. Such an honour bes
towed by one of the most prestigious uni
veristies in the bastion of democracy, the
heart of the free world, would be a tre
mendous political card in hands of any
politician. If by any chance an unscrupul
ous politician is handed that card it would
spell havoc and disaster for the country.
Given Bhutto's brilliant oratory and a 70
percent illiterate audience that looks up to
the U.S. for moral leadership, a disclaimer
at the end of the ASSU's resolution not
condoning Bhutto's acts would be worse
than meaningless. If, however, Bhutto is
innocent and the government is bent on
executing him, as is being claimed, a mere
invitation is not going to deter the au
thorities who are more likely to consider it
a provocation. In such a difficult cir
cumstance it is best not to prejudge the
situation and to await the decision of the
court.
Contrary to Michael 11 onomides' asser
tion that "executions in Pakistan follow
the final verdict almost immediately"
(Daily, Oct. 9), there has been no inci
dence of such a happening in the case ofa
political prisoner in the history of the
country. In the interim, the senate should
impress upon the U.N., the U.S. and
European governments to use their
enormous leverage to prevent such a
tragic eventuality.
The United States already has a poor
reputation for supporting tyrannical re
gimes in the Third World. The negative
feelings of people would be strengthened
if this Univeristy makes a wrong decision.
Fortunately, students in the U.S. are be
coming more conscious of happenings in
the rest of the world. Today they would
protest if an anti-people personality is in
vited from Latin America simply because
they are much more aware of the politics
of Latin America. Their relative ignorance
of Asian and Pakistan should not be an
excuse for misusing their good intentions
and good faith. Norshould the fate of mill
ions of oppressed Pakistanis be toyed with
in such casual manner.

The ASSU Senate has offered a guest
professorship to Mr. Ali Bhutto. The impli
cations for Pakistan's future are not insig
nificant. iris therefore necessary to avoid a
hasty decision and to investigate the pros
and cons in some detail.
It is conceivable that in its enthusiasm to
stand up for human rights the senate
might perhaps have made a rash decision.
At best it seems to have confused the two
issues that are relevant: the demand for a
fair trial and the offer of a guest professor
ship. It is not clear that one follows from
the other. The demand for a fair trial and
the concern with human rights is to be
lauded. It goes without saying that one
would ask for a fair trial for any political
leader who is overthrown in the world,
irrespective of caste, color or creed. It
does not immediately follow that one
would invite them as guest professors at
the University.
It is thus clear that the two issues are
separate. It is therefore sufficient to con
centrate on the criteria which
ensure eligibility for selection as a
professor and on the process which sees
that these criteria are properly applied.
The selection forany majorposition at the
