CPR center urged
I was delighted to read that
the Med Center might equip
a small cardiopulmonary re
suscitation (CPR) training
center in the University hospi
tal. Considering the small
amount of equipment required
to train us and the new hours
per year needed to maintain
proficiency, CPR brings a large
return. We would gain both in
the competence of our physi
cians and in the lives which
such trained physicians might
save.
I urge the administration of
the Medical Center to carefully
consider the advantages of
such a CPR training center.

'Deplorable'
behavior
We are appalled at the de
plorable number of students
who used the Hitlerian "Zig
Heil" salute as a means of ridi
culing the Cal band during the
Big Game. It was embarrassing
for us to sit in the same stands
with fellow students who could
find humor in the most tragic
era of modern history.
To compare the Berkeley
band to Adolf Hitler, called by
Winston Churchill "the re
pository and expression of the
most virulent hatreds that have
ever corroded the human
breast," represents an insult
far exceeding the limits of
good taste. That Stanford stu
dents could engage in such

reprehensible behavior, even
in jest, is a sad comment on our
student body.
No doubt rivalry is a healthy,
normal, fun emotion — one
which engenders school spirit.
But carried to the extreme at
this year's Big Came, it serves
only to degrade and defile the
name of Stanford.

A better plan
After considering Pete
McCloskey's plan for national
service, and his efforts to free
Ali Bhutto in Pakistan, we have
concluded that both efforts
should be merged: McCloskey
should be drafted, and then
traded for Bhutto. We would
gain a political prisoner and
lose a proponent of the draft —
leaving everyone unambigu
ously better off.

Females can be
assertive
In her recent letter Elaine
Forthoffer takes note of the
CEEW report which says that
Stanford women seek jobs less
aggressively than men. She
quotes us as saying that the
male is the more aggressive
member of the human species,
and that there is probably a
biological component in male
aggression. These quotes are
accurate.
Her conclusion is that we
should simply accept women's
less "aggressive" job-seeking
as natural: with this, we disag
ree. Part of the problem is the
two meaningsof "aggression."
The "natural" aggression to
which we have referred in our
work is fighting. Males usually
do it as part of their greater in
terest in establishing and main
taining dominance relation
ships among themselves — as
aspect of relationships with
which women and girls are less
concerned.
The fact that a woman is less
likely to fight, however, does
not mean that she need be a
less "aggressive" job-seeker. It
would have been clearer if the
CEEW report had said: "Stan
ford women seek jobs less as
sertively than men." It is possi
ble to be assertive without
being aggressive. There is no
evidence that women are
biologically biased against
being assertive. They are cul
turally conditioned in this di
rection however — con

ditioned to be self
deprecatory, and to withdraw
when males raise their voices.
What cultures establish they
can change. We are not argu
ing that women should be
taught to use their fists as read

ily as men do. Only that there
would be nothing "unnatural"
in teaching them to seek jobs
more assertively.

reprehensible behavior, even
in jest, is a sad comment on our
student body.
No doubt rivalry is a healthy,
normal, fun emotion — one
which engenders school spirit.
But carried to the extreme at
this year's Big Came, it serves
only to degrade and defile the
name of Stanford.

A better plan
After considering Pete
McCloskey's plan for national
service, and his efforts to free
Ali Bhutto in Pakistan, we have
concluded that both efforts
should be merged: McCloskey
should be drafted, and then
traded for Bhutto. We would
gain a political prisoner and
lose a proponent of the draft —
leaving everyone unambigu
ously better off.

Females can be
assertive
In her recent letter Elaine
Forthoffer takes note of the
CEEW report which says that
Stanford women seek jobs less
aggressively than men. She
quotes us as saying that the
male is the more aggressive
member of the human species,
and that there is probably a
biological component in male
aggression. These quotes are
accurate.
Her conclusion is that we
should simply accept women's
less "aggressive" job-seeking
as natural: with this, we disag
ree. Part of the problem is the
two meaningsof "aggression."
The "natural" aggression to
which we have referred in our
work is fighting. Males usually
do it as part of their greater in
terest in establishing and main
taining dominance relation
ships among themselves — as
aspect of relationships with
which women and girls are less
concerned.
The fact that a woman is less
likely to fight, however, does
not mean that she need be a
less "aggressive" job-seeker. It
would have been clearer if the
CEEW report had said: "Stan
ford women seek jobs less as
sertively than men." It is possi
ble to be assertive without
being aggressive. There is no
evidence that women are
biologically biased against
being assertive. They are cul
turally conditioned in this di
rection however — con

ditioned to be self
deprecatory, and to withdraw
when males raise their voices.
What cultures establish they
can change. We are not argu
ing that women should be
taught to use their fists as read

ily as men do. Only that there
would be nothing "unnatural"
in teaching them to seek jobs
more assertively.

CPR center urged
I was delighted to read that
the Med Center might equip
a small cardiopulmonary re
suscitation (CPR) training
center in the University hospi
tal. Considering the small
amount of equipment required
to train us and the new hours
per year needed to maintain
proficiency, CPR brings a large
return. We would gain both in
the competence of our physi
cians and in the lives which
such trained physicians might
save.
I urge the administration of
the Medical Center to carefully
consider the advantages of
such a CPR training center.

'Deplorable'
behavior
We are appalled at the de
plorable number of students
who used the Hitlerian "Zig
Heil" salute as a means of ridi
culing the Cal band during the
Big Game. It was embarrassing
for us to sit in the same stands
with fellow students who could
find humor in the most tragic
era of modern history.
To compare the Berkeley
band to Adolf Hitler, called by
Winston Churchill "the re
pository and expression of the
most virulent hatreds that have
ever corroded the human
breast," represents an insult
far exceeding the limits of
good taste. That Stanford stu
dents could engage in such

reprehensible behavior, even
in jest, is a sad comment on our
student body.
