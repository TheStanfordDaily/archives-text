# More than 600 miles from earth
## Aerial photography gives geology clues 
### SALLY OURIEFF 
While environmentalists and
resource developers debate
the future use of the earth,
Prof. Ronald Lyon is reaching
600 miles out in space for new
perspectives and possible sol
utions.
Sitting amidst the stacks of
books, papers, charts and
photographs which clutter his
large office, Lyon, a professor
of applied earth sciences (AES),
explained the complexities of
his current research.
"Both sides have to learn
how to measure what they're
talking about," Lyon said.
"We're trying to give them
some hard facts."
The LANDSAT II and 111 satel
lites, circling the earth every 18
days, are providing the hard
facts Lyon refers to. The satel
lites, 600 miles above the earth,
photograph the areas they pass
over, sending the images down
in the form of numerical val
ues.
The values are converted
into black and white or color
prints by computer. When as
sembled, the prints provide
three-dimension-like photo
graphic maps of extensive
areas of the earth.
The satellites, computer

and photographs are the tools
of Lyon's work. He describes
himself and his fellow workers
as "users" who are simply tak
ing advanced technology and
applying it to geological
fieldwork.
While Lyon could at one time
be seen stomping the hills
wearing an Australian bush cap
and two pairs of glasses, he is
now found spending long
hours in the computer room,
hunching over his high altitude
photographs.
The 50-year-old professor,
born and educated in Au
stralia, began his career as a
mining geologist. Interested in
using a variety of instrumental
techniques to analyze surface
minerals, Lyon was awarded a
Fulbright Scholarship at the
age of 23. He later went to
UC-Berkeley. Except for a
two-year return to Australia,
Lyon has remained in the Un
ited States ever since.
As instruments became
more sophisticated, Lyon's
fieldwork moved off the land
and into the air. Using aerial
photography and radar, he be
came more involved in discov
ering how land forms can serve
as clues to underlying rock
types and mineral deposits.

Radar, he explained, en
thusiastically jumping up to
show examples, is the prefer
red technique, as it can penet
rate bad weather and is particu
larly useful in tropical areas.
Photography, he added, while
giving clearer and more de
tailed images, can only capture
small areas and demands good
weather and proper sunlight.
It is the satellites, according
to Lyon, which should revol
utionize physical geology.
LANDSAT is "essentially what I
call a 'vegetable looker.' " The
technique, known as "remote
sensing," can give continual
data on the condition of land
vegetation around the world.
This information, Lyon said,
has a great deal of environmen
tal potential.
Lyon has developed compu
ter systems to analyze the data
for several specific projects. In
1977 Congress passed the Sur
face Mining Law. This states
that open-pit mining com
panies must insure that the
stripped land is returned to its
original condition, completely
revegetated to equal or better
its natural state.
With some single mines
spanning 12 miles, traditional
field methods would not be

able to cover the vast amount
of land needing to be moni
tored, according to Lyon. The
satellite photographs how
ever, make the process both
objective and practical.
In California, the Bureau of
Land Management has chosen
Lyon's system to locate impor
tant mineral deposits in an at
tempt to define wilderness and
resource exploration areas.
While approximately 25
other scientific groups in the
United States are also using
and researching lANDSAT re
mote sensing, Lyon and his
group here have developed a
computer processing system
for the satellite information
which is attracting interest
worldwide because of its de
tailed statistical approach.
The approximately $150,000
system is very economical ac
cording to Alfrede Prelat, a
post-doctoral researcher in
AES and, "will be a transfer of
technology from Stanford to
other countries."
While some countries, such
as Argentina and possibly
China, are sending students to
the University to learn the sys
tem, others, including Au
stralia, India, Zaire, and Swe
den, are building the approxi

mately $10 million satellite re
ceiving stations.
Lyon eagerly explains that
LANDSAT can help those coun
tries predict annual food yields
and the effects of climate
change on individual crops.
Because remote sensing is
relatively new, Lyon em
phasized that here "what we
would like to know is how
truthful is the satellite relative
to what we see on the ground.
The Stanford role is really a
precision role. Can we trust the
numbers?"
While Lyon's research relies
on complex roving space satel
lites, his manner is straightfor

ward and down-to-earth. Ac
cording to Stuart Marsh, a doc
toral candidate in geology,
Lyon "likes to give his students
a sense of the real world in
terms of putting them through
trial by combat."
Tim Townsend, also a doc
toral candidate, said, "Ron's
probably one of the more ac
cessible professors in terms of
just being friends."
Better known as "Renaldo
Remoto" among his fellow
workers (a nickname he re
ceived in Venezuela in refer
ence to his teaching of remote
sensing), Lyon seems to ap

preciate his students as much
as they enjoy him.
After each of the doctoral
candidates finishes the oral de
fense of his dissertation, Lyon
breaks out brandy glasses,
carefully stored in an egg car
ton, opens a bottle of the finest
French cognac, and offers a
toast in celebration. He does
have class!!
Next month Lyon will return
to Australia on a one month
Fulbright Scholarship. Excited
and motivated about his re
search Lyon said, "We've all
got to live together. But we've
got to figure out how!"

Ronald Lyon, professor of applied earth sciences here, displays aerial photographs of various land
masses. The photographs, shot from 600 miles above the earth's surface, are used to study mineral
deposits and rock types.
While environmentalists and
resource developers debate
the future use of the earth,
Prof. Ronald Lyon is reaching
600 miles out in space for new
perspectives and possible sol
utions.
Sitting amidst the stacks of
books, papers, charts and
photographs which clutter his
large office, Lyon, a professor
of applied earth sciences (AES),
explained the complexities of
his current research.
"Both sides have to learn
how to measure what they're
talking about," Lyon said.
"We're trying to give them
some hard facts."
The LANDSAT II and 111 satel
lites, circling the earth every 18
days, are providing the hard
facts Lyon refers to. The satel
lites, 600 miles above the earth,
photograph the areas they pass
over, sending the images down
in the form of numerical val
ues.
The values are converted
into black and white or color
prints by computer. When as
sembled, the prints provide
three-dimension-like photo
graphic maps of extensive
areas of the earth.
The satellites, computer

and photographs are the tools
of Lyon's work. He describes
himself and his fellow workers
as "users" who are simply tak
ing advanced technology and
applying it to geological
fieldwork.
While Lyon could at one time
be seen stomping the hills
wearing an Australian bush cap
and two pairs of glasses, he is
now found spending long
hours in the computer room,
hunching over his high altitude
photographs.
The 50-year-old professor,
born and educated in Au
stralia, began his career as a
mining geologist. Interested in
using a variety of instrumental
techniques to analyze surface
minerals, Lyon was awarded a
Fulbright Scholarship at the
age of 23. He later went to
UC-Berkeley. Except for a
two-year return to Australia,
Lyon has remained in the Un
ited States ever since.
As instruments became
more sophisticated, Lyon's
fieldwork moved off the land
and into the air. Using aerial
photography and radar, he be
came more involved in discov
ering how land forms can serve
as clues to underlying rock
types and mineral deposits.

Radar, he explained, en
thusiastically jumping up to
show examples, is the prefer
red technique, as it can penet
rate bad weather and is particu
larly useful in tropical areas.
Photography, he added, while
giving clearer and more de
tailed images, can only capture
small areas and demands good
weather and proper sunlight.
It is the satellites, according
to Lyon, which should revol
utionize physical geology.
LANDSAT is "essentially what I
call a 'vegetable looker.' " The
technique, known as "remote
sensing," can give continual
data on the condition of land
vegetation around the world.
This information, Lyon said,
has a great deal of environmen
tal potential.
Lyon has developed compu
ter systems to analyze the data
for several specific projects. In
1977 Congress passed the Sur
face Mining Law. This states
that open-pit mining com
panies must insure that the
stripped land is returned to its
original condition, completely
revegetated to equal or better
its natural state.
With some single mines
spanning 12 miles, traditional
field methods would not be

able to cover the vast amount
of land needing to be moni
tored, according to Lyon. The
satellite photographs how
ever, make the process both
objective and practical.
In California, the Bureau of
Land Management has chosen
Lyon's system to locate impor
tant mineral deposits in an at
tempt to define wilderness and
resource exploration areas.
While approximately 25
other scientific groups in the
United States are also using
and researching lANDSAT re
mote sensing, Lyon and his
group here have developed a
computer processing system
for the satellite information
which is attracting interest
worldwide because of its de
tailed statistical approach.
The approximately $150,000
system is very economical ac
cording to Alfrede Prelat, a
post-doctoral researcher in
AES and, "will be a transfer of
technology from Stanford to
other countries."
While some countries, such
as Argentina and possibly
China, are sending students to
the University to learn the sys
tem, others, including Au
stralia, India, Zaire, and Swe
den, are building the approxi

mately $10 million satellite re
ceiving stations.
Lyon eagerly explains that
LANDSAT can help those coun
tries predict annual food yields
and the effects of climate
change on individual crops.
Because remote sensing is
relatively new, Lyon em
phasized that here "what we
would like to know is how
truthful is the satellite relative
to what we see on the ground.
The Stanford role is really a
precision role. Can we trust the
numbers?"
While Lyon's research relies
on complex roving space satel
lites, his manner is straightfor

ward and down-to-earth. Ac
cording to Stuart Marsh, a doc
toral candidate in geology,
Lyon "likes to give his students
a sense of the real world in
terms of putting them through
trial by combat."
Tim Townsend, also a doc
toral candidate, said, "Ron's
probably one of the more ac
cessible professors in terms of
just being friends."
Better known as "Renaldo
Remoto" among his fellow
workers (a nickname he re
ceived in Venezuela in refer
ence to his teaching of remote
sensing), Lyon seems to ap

preciate his students as much
as they enjoy him.
After each of the doctoral
candidates finishes the oral de
fense of his dissertation, Lyon
breaks out brandy glasses,
carefully stored in an egg car
ton, opens a bottle of the finest
French cognac, and offers a
toast in celebration. He does
have class!!
Next month Lyon will return
to Australia on a one month
Fulbright Scholarship. Excited
and motivated about his re
search Lyon said, "We've all
got to live together. But we've
got to figure out how!"

Ronald Lyon, professor of applied earth sciences here, displays aerial photographs of various land
masses. The photographs, shot from 600 miles above the earth's surface, are used to study mineral
deposits and rock types.
While environmentalists and
resource developers debate
the future use of the earth,
Prof. Ronald Lyon is reaching
600 miles out in space for new
perspectives and possible sol
utions.
Sitting amidst the stacks of
books, papers, charts and
photographs which clutter his
large office, Lyon, a professor
of applied earth sciences (AES),
explained the complexities of
his current research.
"Both sides have to learn
how to measure what they're
talking about," Lyon said.
"We're trying to give them
some hard facts."
The LANDSAT II and 111 satel
lites, circling the earth every 18
days, are providing the hard
facts Lyon refers to. The satel
lites, 600 miles above the earth,
photograph the areas they pass
over, sending the images down
in the form of numerical val
ues.
The values are converted
into black and white or color
prints by computer. When as
sembled, the prints provide
three-dimension-like photo
graphic maps of extensive
areas of the earth.
The satellites, computer

and photographs are the tools
of Lyon's work. He describes
himself and his fellow workers
as "users" who are simply tak
ing advanced technology and
applying it to geological
fieldwork.
While Lyon could at one time
be seen stomping the hills
wearing an Australian bush cap
and two pairs of glasses, he is
now found spending long
hours in the computer room,
hunching over his high altitude
photographs.
The 50-year-old professor,
born and educated in Au
stralia, began his career as a
mining geologist. Interested in
using a variety of instrumental
techniques to analyze surface
minerals, Lyon was awarded a
Fulbright Scholarship at the
age of 23. He later went to
UC-Berkeley. Except for a
two-year return to Australia,
Lyon has remained in the Un
ited States ever since.
As instruments became
more sophisticated, Lyon's
fieldwork moved off the land
and into the air. Using aerial
photography and radar, he be
came more involved in discov
ering how land forms can serve
as clues to underlying rock
types and mineral deposits.

Radar, he explained, en
thusiastically jumping up to
show examples, is the prefer
red technique, as it can penet
rate bad weather and is particu
larly useful in tropical areas.
Photography, he added, while
giving clearer and more de
tailed images, can only capture
small areas and demands good
weather and proper sunlight.
It is the satellites, according
to Lyon, which should revol
utionize physical geology.
LANDSAT is "essentially what I
call a 'vegetable looker.' " The
technique, known as "remote
sensing," can give continual
data on the condition of land
vegetation around the world.
This information, Lyon said,
has a great deal of environmen
tal potential.
Lyon has developed compu
ter systems to analyze the data
for several specific projects. In
1977 Congress passed the Sur
face Mining Law. This states
that open-pit mining com
panies must insure that the
stripped land is returned to its
original condition, completely
revegetated to equal or better
its natural state.
With some single mines
spanning 12 miles, traditional
field methods would not be

able to cover the vast amount
of land needing to be moni
tored, according to Lyon. The
satellite photographs how
ever, make the process both
objective and practical.
In California, the Bureau of
Land Management has chosen
Lyon's system to locate impor
tant mineral deposits in an at
tempt to define wilderness and
resource exploration areas.
While approximately 25
other scientific groups in the
United States are also using
and researching lANDSAT re
mote sensing, Lyon and his
group here have developed a
computer processing system
for the satellite information
which is attracting interest
worldwide because of its de
tailed statistical approach.
The approximately $150,000
system is very economical ac
cording to Alfrede Prelat, a
post-doctoral researcher in
AES and, "will be a transfer of
technology from Stanford to
other countries."
While some countries, such
as Argentina and possibly
China, are sending students to
the University to learn the sys
tem, others, including Au
stralia, India, Zaire, and Swe
den, are building the approxi

mately $10 million satellite re
ceiving stations.
Lyon eagerly explains that
LANDSAT can help those coun
tries predict annual food yields
and the effects of climate
change on individual crops.
Because remote sensing is
relatively new, Lyon em
phasized that here "what we
would like to know is how
truthful is the satellite relative
to what we see on the ground.
The Stanford role is really a
precision role. Can we trust the
numbers?"
While Lyon's research relies
on complex roving space satel
lites, his manner is straightfor

ward and down-to-earth. Ac
cording to Stuart Marsh, a doc
toral candidate in geology,
Lyon "likes to give his students
a sense of the real world in
terms of putting them through
trial by combat."
Tim Townsend, also a doc
toral candidate, said, "Ron's
probably one of the more ac
cessible professors in terms of
just being friends."
Better known as "Renaldo
Remoto" among his fellow
workers (a nickname he re
ceived in Venezuela in refer
ence to his teaching of remote
sensing), Lyon seems to ap

preciate his students as much
as they enjoy him.
After each of the doctoral
candidates finishes the oral de
fense of his dissertation, Lyon
breaks out brandy glasses,
carefully stored in an egg car
ton, opens a bottle of the finest
French cognac, and offers a
toast in celebration. He does
have class!!
Next month Lyon will return
to Australia on a one month
Fulbright Scholarship. Excited
and motivated about his re
search Lyon said, "We've all
got to live together. But we've
got to figure out how!"
