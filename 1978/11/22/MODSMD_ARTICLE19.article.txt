## Dons knock soccer team out, 6-3 Cards scare USF, then lose 
### DEAN EYRE 
San Francisco — The Stanford
soccer team's Far West reg
ional appearance, first in 16
years, was brief but nonethe
less impressive. USF, proving
that it deserves its No. 2 na
tional rating came from behind
to outpace the Cardinals, 6-3,
eliminating them from further
post-season competition.
The Pacific Soccer Confer
ence champ Dons were playing
in their sixth straight regional
playoff and carried a 24-1 mark.
The third-place Cards sported
a 16-5 record and proved a
more-than-worthy opponent,
closing a gap in skill levels with
endless hustle. Showing total
disregard for the Don's status,
the Cards jumped out in front
2-0 before five minutes had
elapsed.
Overcoming a habit of being
a second-half team, Stanford
came out charging right from

the opening whistle and drew
first blood when Andre Mann,
assisted by Peter Phillips, put in
his second goal of the season
two minutes into the game.
Phillips made an unassisted
goal a couple minutes laterand
it seemed as if David had
knocked Goliath to the soggy
turf of Ulrich Field. Stanford
supporters among the 3000
spectators cheered wildly with
amazement.
"I predicted an early goal
because they (USF) would
come out very lax and we
would come out very strong
and I figured if we were going
to score a goal it would be at
this time," Stanford coach Nel
son Lodge said.
Unfortunately, in this
gladiator battle, Goliath got
back on his feet, Roar Ander
sen putting the Dons on the
scoreboard with a goal 13 mi
nutes into the first period and

followed by Roger Alphonso
scoring seven minutes later.
USF took the lead when Dag
Olavsen put in a shot three mi
nutes later. With just more
than a minute remaining in the
half, Goodwin Odiye scored to
give the Dons a 4-2 lead.
just what happened to the
Cards as they lost their two
goal margin?
"Looking back on it, I don't
think we grasped the oppor
tunity presented us, because
we had it right there," Hecht
said. "The defense didn't hang
onto it; we gave up six goals. I
think everybody on the de
fense felt kind of bad."
"I think there was a loss of
concentration because I didn't
feel the intensity on the field
that I would have liked to feel,"
McNevin said. "We lost the in
tensity that got us the goals in
the first place. We were
dominating and pressing mi
nutes before and after the goal,
then we kind of let off."
"The only thing this team
lacks now is maturity," Lodge
said. "To be ahead 2-0 against
the top team in the country and
all of a sudden a psychological
thing sets in — that we
shouldn't belong there (being
ahead) and we're going to lose
anyway."
Stanford started the second
half just the way it opened the
game — with a bang. In less
than three minutes the Cards
were down at USF's goal
threatening and Ted Rafalovich

crossed a perfect corner kick
across the mouth of the goal
and in the struggle to control
the ball, it went past the keeper
— again instant bedlam for the
Card rooters.
No team has scored three
goals against USF in the same
game since early 1977 when
Maryland lost to the Dons 5-4
and Brown beat them 3-2.
The teams displayed a con
stant in playing styles: Stanford
relying on speed down the
sidelines and crossing while
the Dons played a sjiort pass
and dribble game. The Cards
were in control until the sleep
ing giant awoke 17 minutes
into the final period when Alex
Nwosu put USF ahead 5-3.
Odiye added the final goal of
the game with 11 minutes left.
"We're playing by far the
best team in the country,
mostly because they're not
from this country," assistant
coach Phil Wright said. "They
didn't play one American at all
today except at goalie."
Perhaps the optimistic sen
timents of those involved with
the program were best expres
sed by Lodge as he sat next to
the dressing room filled with
slightly disappointed, yet
realistically satisfied soccer
players.
"I can't tell you how happy I
am with the team's perfor
mance," he said. "We're going
to be here (the regionals) lots
of times and to me it's just edu
cational."

Olavsen put in a shot three mi

than a minute remaining in the
half, Goodwin Odiye scored to
give the Dons a 4-2 lead.

Cards as they lost their two

"Looking back on it, I don't
think we grasped the oppor
tunity presented us, because
we had it right there," Hecht
said. "The defense didn't hang
onto it; we gave up six goals. I
think everybody on the de
fense felt kind of bad."
"I think there was a loss of
concentration because I didn't
feel the intensity on the field
that I would have liked to feel,"
McNevin said. "We lost the in
tensity that got us the goals in
the first place. We were
dominating and pressing mi
nutes before and after the goal,
then we kind of let off."
"The only thing this team
lacks now is maturity," Lodge
said. "To be ahead 2-0 against
the top team in the country and
all of a sudden a psychological
thing sets in — that we
shouldn't belong there (being
ahead) and we're going to lose
anyway."
Stanford started the second
half just the way it opened the
game — with a bang. In less
than three minutes the Cards
were down at USF's goal
threatening and Ted Rafalovich

crossed a perfect corner kick
across the mouth of the goal
and in the struggle to control
the ball, it went past the keeper
— again instant bedlam for the
Card rooters.
No team has scored three
goals against USF in the same
game since early 1977 when
Maryland lost to the Dons 5-4
and Brown beat them 3-2.
The teams displayed a con
stant in playing styles: Stanford
relying on speed down the
sidelines and crossing while
the Dons played a sjiort pass
and dribble game. The Cards
were in control until the sleep
ing giant awoke 17 minutes
into the final period when Alex
Nwosu put USF ahead 5-3.
Odiye added the final goal of
the game with 11 minutes left.
"We're playing by far the
best team in the country,
mostly because they're not
from this country," assistant
coach Phil Wright said. "They
didn't play one American at all
today except at goalie."
Perhaps the optimistic sen
timents of those involved with
the program were best expres
sed by Lodge as he sat next to
the dressing room filled with
slightly disappointed, yet
realistically satisfied soccer
players.
"I can't tell you how happy I
am with the team's perfor
mance," he said. "We're going
to be here (the regionals) lots
of times and to me it's just edu
cational."

Stanford's Laird Cagan (8) and (JSF's Nick Lambridis (2) battle for a head ball in the first half of Monday's
Far West regional semi-final match. Cards Andre Mann (5) and Greg Delgado also get in on the play,
while Dons Jon Erik Skaug (3) and goalie Andy Fry defend.
San Francisco — The Stanford
soccer team's Far West reg
ional appearance, first in 16
years, was brief but nonethe
less impressive. USF, proving
that it deserves its No. 2 na
tional rating came from behind
to outpace the Cardinals, 6-3,
eliminating them from further
post-season competition.
The Pacific Soccer Confer
ence champ Dons were playing
in their sixth straight regional
playoff and carried a 24-1 mark.
The third-place Cards sported
a 16-5 record and proved a
more-than-worthy opponent,
closing a gap in skill levels with
endless hustle. Showing total
disregard for the Don's status,
the Cards jumped out in front
2-0 before five minutes had
elapsed.
Overcoming a habit of being
a second-half team, Stanford
came out charging right from

the opening whistle and drew
first blood when Andre Mann,
assisted by Peter Phillips, put in
his second goal of the season
two minutes into the game.
Phillips made an unassisted
goal a couple minutes laterand
it seemed as if David had
knocked Goliath to the soggy
turf of Ulrich Field. Stanford
supporters among the 3000
spectators cheered wildly with
amazement.
"I predicted an early goal
because they (USF) would
come out very lax and we
would come out very strong
and I figured if we were going
to score a goal it would be at
this time," Stanford coach Nel
son Lodge said.
Unfortunately, in this
gladiator battle, Goliath got
back on his feet, Roar Ander
sen putting the Dons on the
scoreboard with a goal 13 mi
nutes into the first period and

followed by Roger Alphonso
scoring seven minutes later.

relying on speed down the
sidelines and crossing while
the Dons played a sjiort pass
and dribble game. The Cards
were in control until the sleep
ing giant awoke 17 minutes
into the final period when Alex
Nwosu put USF ahead 5-3.
Odiye added the final goal of
the game with 11 minutes left.
"We're playing by far the
best team in the country,
mostly because they're not
from this country," assistant
coach Phil Wright said. "They
didn't play one American at all
today except at goalie."
Perhaps the optimistic sen
timents of those involved with
the program were best expres
sed by Lodge as he sat next to
the dressing room filled with
slightly disappointed, yet
realistically satisfied soccer
players.
"I can't tell you how happy I
am with the team's perfor
mance," he said. "We're going
to be here (the regionals) lots
of times and to me it's just edu
cational."
