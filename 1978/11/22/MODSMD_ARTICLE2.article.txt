# Fountain planned for Law School front
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Architects here are currently working on plans
for a large fountain to replace the "Four Square
(Walkthrough)" sculpture which stood in front of
the Law School before it was removed this sum
mer, Law School spokesmen said this week.
The Barbara Hepworth bronze piece, also
known to students as "Legal Loopholes," was re
turned to the sculpture gardens in Pasadena's Nor
ton Simon Museum. It had been located near the
main entrance of the new Law School building
since 1975.
"The work had been on a two-year, gratis loan
since 1975, and the loan was extended one more
year in 1977," explained )ohn Merryman, law pro
fessor and committee chairman for design and
construction of the Law School building.
Because the site was originally intended for a
fountain, a drainage system already lies under the

aggregate and brick walkways, said Law School
Assoc. Dean Joseph Leininger.
Heavy pedestal
In addition, "the base pedestal is designed for
something heavy, like a fountain or statue," he
said.
However, pump rooms and electrical facilities
are not provided for at present, but are being
planned by the facilities office here.
Preliminary schematic drawings for the fountain
call for a work of "granite slabs arranged in non
symmetrical fashion," Leininger said. Designs
were prepared by Sprankle, Lynd and Sprague, a
San Francisco-based firm.
Plans must still be approved by a Law School
faculty committee, the planning office and the
Stanford Committee on Outdoor Arts, Leininger
said.
Cost is limited t0550,000, which will be provided

through gifts to the Law School, he added.
"Legal Loopholes" was not the only work to be
removed from the Law School this summer. A
group of 30 Gemini fine prints was also returned
after its two-year loan and one additional year's
loan expired this summer.
Gemini, a Los Angeles firm, was described by
Merryman as being one of the finest print houses
in the world.
"We had pieces which represented some of the
finest lithographs of today. Many were from Ge
mini's archival collection," Merryman said.
Student reaction
"People say they really miss the prints, but I've
heard more talk about the Hepworth piece," Mer
ryman added. "Students miss that a lot. It was a
fine piece of sculpture."
But, he added, the school still holds several
major pieces, all gifts of substantial worth.
