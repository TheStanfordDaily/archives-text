Stanford's Pacific-10 champ
ion water polo team opens the
NCAA championships Satur
day against Air Force Academy
at 9 a.m. at Long Beach's Bel
mont Plaza.
The Cardinals are seeded
first in the national champion
ships ahead of UC-lrvine,
California and Pepperdine.
Four unseeded, at-large teams
will also compete this weekend
— Air Force, Loyola of
Chicago, Bucknell and Texas
A&M. Both Loyola and
Bucknell played in last year's
tournament, though neither
placed in the top four.
Last year's nationals hold bit
ter memories for the Cards as
they had entered the tourna
ment seeded first, only to be
upset in the semi-finals by Ir
vine. They ended up finishing
third and watched from the
sidelines as Cal beat Irvine to
take the national title.
According to Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti, getting to
the semi-finals this year should
not be difficult for the Cards.

The second-year coach said he
considers Saturday's game
against Air Force a "prelimi
nary match." Dettamanti said
the out-of-state teams are no
match for even smaller
schools' water polo teams in
California, let alone pow
erhouses such as Stanford,
Cal, Irvine and Pepperdine.
Dettamanti said that back-up
goalie Vince Vannelli will start
in the goal against Air Force
and that everyone should get a
chance to play in the game.
Vanelli has started four other
games this year, allowing an
average of less than six goals a
game.
"The Air Force game is a
tune-up for what (we think) will
be the Pepperdine game," De
ttamanti said. "If you play a
particularly weak team, it
doesn't do you that much
good.
"But I'd rather have an easy
game than a tough one," he
added.
If the Cards beat Air Force,
they would move into the

semi-finals against the winner
of the Pepperdine-Bucknell
game. The semi-final match
will be played at 7:30 p.m. on
Saturday.
The finals will be played on
Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m.
Dettamanti said he feels this
year's team is better than last
year's and is better prepared
for the nationals.
"Last year we went all out to
beat Cal (during the last week
of the season) and we were a
little flat for the nationals," he
said. "This year we're trying to
peak for the nationals."
Specifically, Dettamanti
pointed out that team has
been working harder during
the last three weeks and "we're
in better shape than we were
last year," the coach said.
"Everybody is going into this
wanting to win," said senior
Tom Angelo. "Even the
freshmen really want to win —
that's the difference this year."
"It's the ultimate goal of the
year," said freshman Alan
Mouchawar.

the out-of-state teams are no
match for even smaller
schools' water polo teams in
California, let alone pow
erhouses such as Stanford,
Cal, Irvine and Pepperdine.
Dettamanti said that back-up
goalie Vince Vannelli will start
in the goal against Air Force
and that everyone should get a
chance to play in the game.
Vanelli has started four other
games this year, allowing an
average of less than six goals a
game.
"The Air Force game is a
tune-up for what (we think) will
be the Pepperdine game," De
ttamanti said. "If you play a
particularly weak team, it
doesn't do you that much
good.
"But I'd rather have an easy
game than a tough one," he
added.
If the Cards beat Air Force,
they would move into the

semi-finals against the winner
of the Pepperdine-Bucknell
game. The semi-final match
will be played at 7:30 p.m. on
Saturday.
The finals will be played on
Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m.
Dettamanti said he feels this
year's team is better than last
year's and is better prepared
for the nationals.
"Last year we went all out to
beat Cal (during the last week
of the season) and we were a
little flat for the nationals," he
said. "This year we're trying to
peak for the nationals."
Specifically, Dettamanti
pointed out that team has
been working harder during
the last three weeks and "we're
in better shape than we were
last year," the coach said.
"Everybody is going into this
wanting to win," said senior
Tom Angelo. "Even the
freshmen really want to win —
that's the difference this year."
"It's the ultimate goal of the
year," said freshman Alan
Mouchawar.
Stanford's Pacific-10 champ
ion water polo team opens the
NCAA championships Satur
day against Air Force Academy
at 9 a.m. at Long Beach's Bel
mont Plaza.
The Cardinals are seeded
first in the national champion
ships ahead of UC-lrvine,
California and Pepperdine.
Four unseeded, at-large teams
will also compete this weekend
— Air Force, Loyola of
Chicago, Bucknell and Texas
A&M. Both Loyola and
Bucknell played in last year's
tournament, though neither
placed in the top four.
Last year's nationals hold bit
ter memories for the Cards as
they had entered the tourna
ment seeded first, only to be
upset in the semi-finals by Ir
vine. They ended up finishing
third and watched from the
sidelines as Cal beat Irvine to
take the national title.
According to Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti, getting to
the semi-finals this year should
not be difficult for the Cards.

The second-year coach said he
considers Saturday's game
against Air Force a "prelimi
nary match." Dettamanti said

match for even smaller
