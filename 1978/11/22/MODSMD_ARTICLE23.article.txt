# Zetes squeak by Biz II
## Close contests the rule in IM playoffs 
### RICK OSTILLER 
Several top teams were given scares, but
few were beaten as the IM playoffs com
pleted the quarterfinals last week.
In the "A" playoffs, the top-seeded Zetes
needed a last-minute touchdown to defeat
Biz 11, 20-18. During the regular season the
Zetes were unbeaten in five games, while Biz
II was winless. But after routing the Delts,
32-0, the men from the CSB almost pulled the
upset of the season.
In the other "A" quarterfinals, the Theta
Delts knocked off the KAs, 14-0; Biz I took the
Betas, 20-6, and Sigma Chi got by the Th un
derbids on a forfeit.
In the "B" playoffs, the top two teams both
had close calls. At halftime of its quarterfinal
contest, top seeded Off the Wall Gang trailed
Woosie-0,13-0. But OTWG rallied for three
second half scores and a tough 21-19 win.
The second-seeded Ghetto was fortunate
to survive its second-round contest. The 2B
Lions from Roble dominated the game but
the Ghetto got a long touchdown pass and a
conversion to advance with a 7-6 victory.
Third-seeded Organized Grime had worse
troubles. They beat the Spiders from Mars,
12-0, in the opening round but the Spiders

filed a protest claiming one of Crime's
players had competed for a second team,
thereby making both him and Grime ineligi
ble. The protest was upheld, so the Spiders
now advance to the second round Monday
against DU. The winner will meet Donner I
Tuesday for a berth alongside Off the Wall
Gang, Ghetto and Cravath, Swaine and
Moore in the semi-finals.
In the coed leagues, top-seeded Taste of
Honey was beaten by RTD in the quarterfi
nals, but still advanced to the semis because
RTD had an ineligible player.
Elsewhere, Recycling Works, undefeated
but unseeded after losing a star player to
injury, proved the omission an error with a
14-13 overtime win over BRA.
There were no women's league contests,
but top-seeded Taste of Honey lost, 13-2, to
the top-ranked team from California over the
weekend. Taste of Honey held its own when
touch football was played for a half, but the
half of flag football proved its undoing as Cal
scored both touchdowns in the last stanza.
