# Balanced Cards open season against Pomona
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Readjust your perceptions, Stanford
sports tans. Time to shift your attention
from pass patterns to pick-and-rolls, from
blitzes to slam dunks, from the splintered
benches of Stanford Stadium to the var
nished slats of Maples Pavilion.
Basketball season is upon us, and the
C.irdinals begin their 27-game 1978-79
campaign this Saturday against Cal Poly-
Pomona at 8 p.m. in Maples.
Last year's squad displayed undesirable
balance, posting a 13-14 record. Even the
scores were nearly equal: the Cards aver
aged 72.8 points per game while allowing
7"5.9. Frustrating figures indeed, especially
when one remembers that Stanford lost
seven games by three points or less, six of
those defeats coming in Pac-8 play.
Yet the balance is what pleases Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso most about his sea
son's group. The abilities of the players,
from the first to the fifteenth man, are
evenly spread.
"Our strengths lie in the competition
that exists at forward and guard," said the
fourth-year coach. "This year's practices
have been most competitive and produc
tive because of that, and the players have
increased confidence in each other.''
Of course, Dißiaso is depending on his
three returning starters: senior guards
Wolfe Perry and Paul Giovacchini and
junior forward Kimberly Belton.
Perry, an exciting performer who aver
aged 9.2 points a game last year, becomes
one of the few four-year starters in Stan
ford basketball history. Giovacchini led
the team in assists in '77-'lB and was
elected captain for this season. "They have
played very well together in practices,"
Dißiaso said.
The b-foot-7 Belton, meanwhile, ranks as
one of the top power forwards in the con
ference. Voted to the second-team All-
Pacific-8 squad last year, he paced the
Cards in scoring (15.0), rebounding (9.0)
and twelve other individual categories.
Six-foot-11 junior center Tom Schmal
zried and 6-7 freshman forward Brian
WeU h round out the starting quintet. As a
freshman, Sthmalzried played in every
game and started frequently, but last year
spent much time on the bench behind Jeff
M( Hugh and saw ac tion in just 14 games.
Welch comes from Boise Capital High
School in Idaho as one of the most highly

recruited players from that state. He led
his team to three consecutive state titles,
including a 25-0 mark last year while av
eraging 23.4 points a game and 13 re
bounds a contest.
However, Dißiaso realizes the impor
tance of his substitutes to the Cards' suc
cess. "It sounds like an old coaching
cliche, but out strength has to be in the
capital letters T-E-A-M," he said. "Belton
has obviously proved his ablility to play
effectively, but we must have good ba
lance in scoring and defense. We need
each player counting on the others for ef
fectiveness."
Six-foot-seven sophomores Jeff Ryan
and Steve Crandell, along with 6-7
freshman Orlando Ward, are the backups
at forward. Ryan, who lettered a year ago,
could start occasionally. Scott Howard, a
6-9 freshman who won't turn 18 until Feb
ruary, will spell Schmalzried at center.
Dißiaso's reserve guard corps, led by
quick 6-foot junior Daryle Morgan, is
solid. Sophomore Mark Pitchford, an
early-season hero in '77-78, has been
hampered with a back injury since the first
week of practice, but |unior Doug Barnes,
sophomore Peter Lai las and freshmen
Doug Marty and Terry Smith compensate
for Pitchford's absence.
"There's been so much balance in com
petition that we would feel comfortable
sending in any of our players," D Biaso
said.
Every team has its vulnerabilities, how
ever, and Dißiaso said he teels that the
center spot could be a problem for the
Cards.
"We're unproven in the middle," he
said. "Schmalzried has shown marked im
provement, but we realize he won't play
the whole game every game." Without
Schmalzried, Dißiaso added, Stanford
could be lacking defensively.
It Schmalzried is to remain on the floor
and help the Cards, he must stay out of
foul trouble. Schmalzried fouled out of
nine games as a freshman and committed
20 fouls in just 9716 minutes last year.
Experience may prove to be a c ommod
ity the Cards lack. Morgan is the only re
turning reserve guard wiih significant ex
perience, and as Dißiaso said, sending in
relatively untested players like Crandell,
Barnes or Lallas is like sending in a
freshman.

Stanford's non-league opponents in
clude WCAC powers Santa Clara and USF.
The Cards have four games before open
ing the Pac-10 slate against USC Dec. 6 at
Maples, and by then Dißiaso should know
a lot more about his club.
"We'll use those games for gaining ex
perience and working with different com
binations," he said. "Seeing what our
strengths are now and what they will be
after a couple of games might be two diffe
rent things."
Dißiaso wisely refused to make any pre
dictions for '78-79, choosing to cite the
time-honored sports adage of "playing
them one at a time." A team cannot preoc
cupy itself with goals over a 27-game sea
son, he said.
"You do as well as you can in a confer
ence, but you don't permit yourself to
think about conference championships —
right now we just have to beat Cal Poly-
Pomona," Dißiaso said.
The Cards fell victim to the quirks of the
new Pac-10 schedule, being forced to play
USC soon before final examinations and
UCLA at home during Christmas vacation
when most of the students will be away.
"It's unfortunate from the student
standpoint," acknowledged Dißiaso.
"With the expansion of the Pac-8 to the
Pac-10 we had to play UCLA and USC first,
and to find any time we could in De
cember. We had to move some teams out
of out schedule or back a year or two."
The Pac-10 itselt, Dißiaso believes,
should provide rigorous competition as
usual. "It's as tough a league as it's ever
been,"he said.
Dißiaso mentioned perennial champion
UCLA, which returns All-Conference per
formers David Greenwood and Roy Hamil
ton; Washington State, with monsters
lames Donaldson (7-2) and Stuart House
(6-11); USC, which had two excellent re
cruiting years, and Oregon State, which
defeated the Russian national team, as
among more difficult league foes.
The 1978-79 squad is the first composed
totally of Dißiaso recruits, and the Card
coach knows what he expects from his
men.
"We don't have the personnel to run
and gun and full-court press the whole
game," Dißiaso said. "A team that plays
with enthusiam and emotion — that
should be Stanford."

Readjust your perceptions, Stanford
sports tans. Time to shift your attention
from pass patterns to pick-and-rolls, from
blitzes to slam dunks, from the splintered
benches of Stanford Stadium to the var
nished slats of Maples Pavilion.
Basketball season is upon us, and the
C.irdinals begin their 27-game 1978-79
campaign this Saturday against Cal Poly-
Pomona at 8 p.m. in Maples.
Last year's squad displayed undesirable
balance, posting a 13-14 record. Even the
scores were nearly equal: the Cards aver
aged 72.8 points per game while allowing
7"5.9. Frustrating figures indeed, especially
when one remembers that Stanford lost
seven games by three points or less, six of
those defeats coming in Pac-8 play.
Yet the balance is what pleases Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso most about his sea
son's group. The abilities of the players,
from the first to the fifteenth man, are
evenly spread.
"Our strengths lie in the competition
that exists at forward and guard," said the
fourth-year coach. "This year's practices
have been most competitive and produc
tive because of that, and the players have
increased confidence in each other.''
Of course, Dißiaso is depending on his
three returning starters: senior guards
Wolfe Perry and Paul Giovacchini and
junior forward Kimberly Belton.
Perry, an exciting performer who aver
aged 9.2 points a game last year, becomes
one of the few four-year starters in Stan
ford basketball history. Giovacchini led
the team in assists in '77-'lB and was
elected captain for this season. "They have
played very well together in practices,"
Dißiaso said.
The b-foot-7 Belton, meanwhile, ranks as
one of the top power forwards in the con
ference. Voted to the second-team All-
Pacific-8 squad last year, he paced the
Cards in scoring (15.0), rebounding (9.0)
and twelve other individual categories.
Six-foot-11 junior center Tom Schmal
zried and 6-7 freshman forward Brian
WeU h round out the starting quintet. As a
freshman, Sthmalzried played in every
game and started frequently, but last year
spent much time on the bench behind Jeff
M( Hugh and saw ac tion in just 14 games.
Welch comes from Boise Capital High
School in Idaho as one of the most highly

recruited players from that state. He led
his team to three consecutive state titles,
including a 25-0 mark last year while av
eraging 23.4 points a game and 13 re
bounds a contest.
However, Dißiaso realizes the impor
tance of his substitutes to the Cards' suc
cess. "It sounds like an old coaching
cliche, but out strength has to be in the
capital letters T-E-A-M," he said. "Belton
has obviously proved his ablility to play
effectively, but we must have good ba
lance in scoring and defense. We need
each player counting on the others for ef
fectiveness."
Six-foot-seven sophomores Jeff Ryan
and Steve Crandell, along with 6-7
freshman Orlando Ward, are the backups
at forward. Ryan, who lettered a year ago,
could start occasionally. Scott Howard, a
6-9 freshman who won't turn 18 until Feb
ruary, will spell Schmalzried at center.
Dißiaso's reserve guard corps, led by
quick 6-foot junior Daryle Morgan, is
solid. Sophomore Mark Pitchford, an
early-season hero in '77-78, has been
hampered with a back injury since the first
week of practice, but |unior Doug Barnes,
sophomore Peter Lai las and freshmen
Doug Marty and Terry Smith compensate
for Pitchford's absence.
"There's been so much balance in com
petition that we would feel comfortable
sending in any of our players," D Biaso
said.
Every team has its vulnerabilities, how
ever, and Dißiaso said he teels that the
center spot could be a problem for the
Cards.
"We're unproven in the middle," he
said. "Schmalzried has shown marked im
provement, but we realize he won't play
the whole game every game." Without
Schmalzried, Dißiaso added, Stanford
could be lacking defensively.
It Schmalzried is to remain on the floor
and help the Cards, he must stay out of
foul trouble. Schmalzried fouled out of
nine games as a freshman and committed
20 fouls in just 9716 minutes last year.
Experience may prove to be a c ommod
ity the Cards lack. Morgan is the only re
turning reserve guard wiih significant ex
perience, and as Dißiaso said, sending in
relatively untested players like Crandell,
Barnes or Lallas is like sending in a
freshman.

Stanford's non-league opponents in
clude WCAC powers Santa Clara and USF.
The Cards have four games before open
ing the Pac-10 slate against USC Dec. 6 at
Maples, and by then Dißiaso should know
a lot more about his club.
"We'll use those games for gaining ex
perience and working with different com
binations," he said. "Seeing what our
strengths are now and what they will be
after a couple of games might be two diffe
rent things."
Dißiaso wisely refused to make any pre
dictions for '78-79, choosing to cite the
time-honored sports adage of "playing
them one at a time." A team cannot preoc
cupy itself with goals over a 27-game sea
son, he said.
"You do as well as you can in a confer
ence, but you don't permit yourself to
think about conference championships —
right now we just have to beat Cal Poly-
Pomona," Dißiaso said.
The Cards fell victim to the quirks of the
new Pac-10 schedule, being forced to play
USC soon before final examinations and
UCLA at home during Christmas vacation
when most of the students will be away.
"It's unfortunate from the student
standpoint," acknowledged Dißiaso.
"With the expansion of the Pac-8 to the
Pac-10 we had to play UCLA and USC first,
and to find any time we could in De
cember. We had to move some teams out
of out schedule or back a year or two."
The Pac-10 itselt, Dißiaso believes,
should provide rigorous competition as
usual. "It's as tough a league as it's ever
been,"he said.
Dißiaso mentioned perennial champion
UCLA, which returns All-Conference per
formers David Greenwood and Roy Hamil
ton; Washington State, with monsters
lames Donaldson (7-2) and Stuart House
(6-11); USC, which had two excellent re
cruiting years, and Oregon State, which
defeated the Russian national team, as
among more difficult league foes.
The 1978-79 squad is the first composed

The Cards fell victim to the quirks of the
new Pac-10 schedule, being forced to play
USC soon before final examinations and
UCLA at home during Christmas vacation
when most of the students will be away.
"It's unfortunate from the student

"With the expansion of the Pac-8 to the

of out schedule or back a year or two."

Dißiaso mentioned perennial champion
UCLA, which returns All-Conference per
formers David Greenwood and Roy Hamil
ton; Washington State, with monsters
lames Donaldson (7-2) and Stuart House
(6-11); USC, which had two excellent re
cruiting years, and Oregon State, which
defeated the Russian national team, as

The 1978-79 squad is the first composed

"We don't have the personnel to run

Readjust your perceptions, Stanford
sports tans. Time to shift your attention
from pass patterns to pick-and-rolls, from
blitzes to slam dunks, from the splintered
benches of Stanford Stadium to the var
nished slats of Maples Pavilion.
Basketball season is upon us, and the
C.irdinals begin their 27-game 1978-79
campaign this Saturday against Cal Poly-
Pomona at 8 p.m. in Maples.
Last year's squad displayed undesirable
balance, posting a 13-14 record. Even the
scores were nearly equal: the Cards aver
aged 72.8 points per game while allowing
7"5.9. Frustrating figures indeed, especially
when one remembers that Stanford lost
seven games by three points or less, six of
those defeats coming in Pac-8 play.
Yet the balance is what pleases Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso most about his sea
son's group. The abilities of the players,
from the first to the fifteenth man, are
evenly spread.
"Our strengths lie in the competition
that exists at forward and guard," said the
fourth-year coach. "This year's practices
have been most competitive and produc
tive because of that, and the players have
increased confidence in each other.''
Of course, Dißiaso is depending on his
three returning starters: senior guards
Wolfe Perry and Paul Giovacchini and
junior forward Kimberly Belton.
Perry, an exciting performer who aver
aged 9.2 points a game last year, becomes
one of the few four-year starters in Stan
ford basketball history. Giovacchini led
the team in assists in '77-'lB and was
elected captain for this season. "They have
played very well together in practices,"
Dißiaso said.
The b-foot-7 Belton, meanwhile, ranks as
one of the top power forwards in the con
ference. Voted to the second-team All-
Pacific-8 squad last year, he paced the
Cards in scoring (15.0), rebounding (9.0)
and twelve other individual categories.
Six-foot-11 junior center Tom Schmal
zried and 6-7 freshman forward Brian
WeU h round out the starting quintet. As a
freshman, Sthmalzried played in every
game and started frequently, but last year
spent much time on the bench behind Jeff
M( Hugh and saw ac tion in just 14 games.
Welch comes from Boise Capital High
School in Idaho as one of the most highly

recruited players from that state. He led
his team to three consecutive state titles,
including a 25-0 mark last year while av
eraging 23.4 points a game and 13 re
bounds a contest.
However, Dißiaso realizes the impor
tance of his substitutes to the Cards' suc
cess. "It sounds like an old coaching
cliche, but out strength has to be in the
capital letters T-E-A-M," he said. "Belton
has obviously proved his ablility to play
effectively, but we must have good ba
lance in scoring and defense. We need
each player counting on the others for ef
fectiveness."
Six-foot-seven sophomores Jeff Ryan
and Steve Crandell, along with 6-7
freshman Orlando Ward, are the backups
at forward. Ryan, who lettered a year ago,
could start occasionally. Scott Howard, a
6-9 freshman who won't turn 18 until Feb
ruary, will spell Schmalzried at center.
Dißiaso's reserve guard corps, led by
quick 6-foot junior Daryle Morgan, is
solid. Sophomore Mark Pitchford, an
early-season hero in '77-78, has been
hampered with a back injury since the first
week of practice, but |unior Doug Barnes,
sophomore Peter Lai las and freshmen
Doug Marty and Terry Smith compensate
for Pitchford's absence.
"There's been so much balance in com
petition that we would feel comfortable
sending in any of our players," D Biaso
said.
Every team has its vulnerabilities, how
ever, and Dißiaso said he teels that the
center spot could be a problem for the
Cards.
"We're unproven in the middle," he
said. "Schmalzried has shown marked im
provement, but we realize he won't play
the whole game every game." Without
Schmalzried, Dißiaso added, Stanford
could be lacking defensively.
It Schmalzried is to remain on the floor
and help the Cards, he must stay out of
foul trouble. Schmalzried fouled out of
nine games as a freshman and committed
20 fouls in just 9716 minutes last year.
Experience may prove to be a c ommod
ity the Cards lack. Morgan is the only re
turning reserve guard wiih significant ex
perience, and as Dißiaso said, sending in
relatively untested players like Crandell,
Barnes or Lallas is like sending in a
freshman.

Stanford's non-league opponents in
clude WCAC powers Santa Clara and USF.
The Cards have four games before open
ing the Pac-10 slate against USC Dec. 6 at
Maples, and by then Dißiaso should know
a lot more about his club.
"We'll use those games for gaining ex
perience and working with different com
binations," he said. "Seeing what our
strengths are now and what they will be
after a couple of games might be two diffe
rent things."
Dißiaso wisely refused to make any pre
dictions for '78-79, choosing to cite the
time-honored sports adage of "playing
them one at a time." A team cannot preoc
cupy itself with goals over a 27-game sea
son, he said.
"You do as well as you can in a confer
ence, but you don't permit yourself to
think about conference championships —
right now we just have to beat Cal Poly-
Pomona," Dißiaso said.

The Cards have four games before open
ing the Pac-10 slate against USC Dec. 6 at
Maples, and by then Dißiaso should know
a lot more about his club.
"We'll use those games for gaining ex
perience and working with different com
binations," he said. "Seeing what our
strengths are now and what they will be
after a couple of games might be two diffe
rent things."
Dißiaso wisely refused to make any pre
dictions for '78-79, choosing to cite the
time-honored sports adage of "playing
them one at a time." A team cannot preoc
cupy itself with goals over a 27-game sea
son, he said.
"You do as well as you can in a confer
ence, but you don't permit yourself to
think about conference championships —
right now we just have to beat Cal Poly-
Pomona," Dißiaso said.
The Cards fell victim to the quirks of the
new Pac-10 schedule, being forced to play
USC soon before final examinations and
UCLA at home during Christmas vacation
when most of the students will be away.
"It's unfortunate from the student
standpoint," acknowledged Dißiaso.
"With the expansion of the Pac-8 to the
Pac-10 we had to play UCLA and USC first,
and to find any time we could in De
cember. We had to move some teams out
of out schedule or back a year or two."
The Pac-10 itselt, Dißiaso believes,
should provide rigorous competition as
usual. "It's as tough a league as it's ever
been,"he said.
Dißiaso mentioned perennial champion
UCLA, which returns All-Conference per
formers David Greenwood and Roy Hamil
ton; Washington State, with monsters
lames Donaldson (7-2) and Stuart House
(6-11); USC, which had two excellent re
cruiting years, and Oregon State, which
defeated the Russian national team, as
among more difficult league foes.
The 1978-79 squad is the first composed
totally of Dißiaso recruits, and the Card
coach knows what he expects from his
men.
"We don't have the personnel to run
and gun and full-court press the whole
game," Dißiaso said. "A team that plays
with enthusiam and emotion — that
should be Stanford."

Readjust your perceptions, Stanford
sports tans. Time to shift your attention
from pass patterns to pick-and-rolls, from
blitzes to slam dunks, from the splintered
benches of Stanford Stadium to the var
nished slats of Maples Pavilion.
Basketball season is upon us, and the
C.irdinals begin their 27-game 1978-79
campaign this Saturday against Cal Poly-
Pomona at 8 p.m. in Maples.
Last year's squad displayed undesirable
balance, posting a 13-14 record. Even the
scores were nearly equal: the Cards aver
aged 72.8 points per game while allowing
7"5.9. Frustrating figures indeed, especially
when one remembers that Stanford lost
seven games by three points or less, six of
those defeats coming in Pac-8 play.
Yet the balance is what pleases Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso most about his sea
son's group. The abilities of the players,
from the first to the fifteenth man, are
evenly spread.
"Our strengths lie in the competition
that exists at forward and guard," said the
fourth-year coach. "This year's practices
have been most competitive and produc
tive because of that, and the players have
increased confidence in each other.''
Of course, Dißiaso is depending on his
three returning starters: senior guards
Wolfe Perry and Paul Giovacchini and
junior forward Kimberly Belton.
Perry, an exciting performer who aver
aged 9.2 points a game last year, becomes
one of the few four-year starters in Stan
ford basketball history. Giovacchini led
the team in assists in '77-'lB and was
elected captain for this season. "They have
played very well together in practices,"
Dißiaso said.
The b-foot-7 Belton, meanwhile, ranks as
one of the top power forwards in the con
ference. Voted to the second-team All-
Pacific-8 squad last year, he paced the
Cards in scoring (15.0), rebounding (9.0)
and twelve other individual categories.
Six-foot-11 junior center Tom Schmal
zried and 6-7 freshman forward Brian
WeU h round out the starting quintet. As a
freshman, Sthmalzried played in every
game and started frequently, but last year
spent much time on the bench behind Jeff
M( Hugh and saw ac tion in just 14 games.
Welch comes from Boise Capital High
School in Idaho as one of the most highly

recruited players from that state. He led
his team to three consecutive state titles,
including a 25-0 mark last year while av
eraging 23.4 points a game and 13 re
bounds a contest.
However, Dißiaso realizes the impor
tance of his substitutes to the Cards' suc
cess. "It sounds like an old coaching
cliche, but out strength has to be in the
capital letters T-E-A-M," he said. "Belton
has obviously proved his ablility to play
effectively, but we must have good ba
lance in scoring and defense. We need
each player counting on the others for ef
fectiveness."
Six-foot-seven sophomores Jeff Ryan
and Steve Crandell, along with 6-7
freshman Orlando Ward, are the backups
at forward. Ryan, who lettered a year ago,
could start occasionally. Scott Howard, a
6-9 freshman who won't turn 18 until Feb
ruary, will spell Schmalzried at center.
Dißiaso's reserve guard corps, led by
quick 6-foot junior Daryle Morgan, is
solid. Sophomore Mark Pitchford, an
early-season hero in '77-78, has been
hampered with a back injury since the first
week of practice, but |unior Doug Barnes,
sophomore Peter Lai las and freshmen
Doug Marty and Terry Smith compensate
for Pitchford's absence.
"There's been so much balance in com
petition that we would feel comfortable
sending in any of our players," D Biaso
said.
Every team has its vulnerabilities, how
ever, and Dißiaso said he teels that the
center spot could be a problem for the
Cards.
"We're unproven in the middle," he
said. "Schmalzried has shown marked im
provement, but we realize he won't play
the whole game every game." Without
Schmalzried, Dißiaso added, Stanford
could be lacking defensively.
It Schmalzried is to remain on the floor
and help the Cards, he must stay out of
foul trouble. Schmalzried fouled out of
nine games as a freshman and committed
20 fouls in just 9716 minutes last year.
Experience may prove to be a c ommod
ity the Cards lack. Morgan is the only re
turning reserve guard wiih significant ex
perience, and as Dißiaso said, sending in
relatively untested players like Crandell,
Barnes or Lallas is like sending in a
