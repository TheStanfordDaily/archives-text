American Caesar: Douglas
Mac Arthur, 1880-1964
William Manchester
Little, Brown and Company
793 pp. $15
"He was a great thundering
paradox of a man, noble and
ignoble, inspiring and out
rageous, arrogant and shy, the
best of men and the worst of
men, the most protean, most
ridiculous, and most sublime.
No more baffling, exasperating
soldier ever wore a uniform.
Flamboyant, imperious, and
apocalyptic, he carried the
plumage of a flamingo, could
not acknowledge errors, and
tried to cover up his mistakes
with sly, childish tricks. Yet he
was also endowed with great
personal charm, a will of iron,
and a soaring intellect. Un
questionably he was the most
gifted man-at-arms this nation
has produced."
Inflated prose
Manchester's lofty, inflated
prose fits well the egoistic,
theatric Mac Arthur. He has
done a thorough job of exa
mining primary and secondary
material on Mac Arthur, al
though he often leans heavily
on previously written biog
raphies, particularly that of W.
Clayton James, for both infor
mation and interpretive
framework. Scenes are vividly
written, painstakingly detailed.
He assiduously roots out all of
the quirks and contradictions
of Mac Arthur's life, exposing
Mac Arthur's paranoia and van
ity as well as his courage and
magnetism. Yet, at the same
time, the author is an obvious
admirer of Mac Arthur, and at
times his position is barely dis
tinguishable from the person
about whom he is writing.
Manchester takes special
pains to debunk some of the
myths that still envelop his pro
tagonist. He attacks the legend
of cowardly "Dugout Dug" by
documenting countless stories

of Mac Arthur's brazen disre
gard for his own safety during
excursions to the battlefront.
He also shows how Mac Arthur
privately promoted himself for
the Presidency in 1944, 1948
and 1952, while publically dis
avowing his ambitions for
reasons of military protocol.
He likewise disposes of stories
claiming that Mac Arthur had
considerable financial hold
ings in the Philippines. Man
chester also concludes that the
decision to march to the Yalu
and attempt to unify Korea
under Syngman Rhee after the
September 1950 Inchon land
ing was as much President
Truman's and Secretary of
State Acheson's as it was
Mac Arthur's. Until recently,
most scholars, and Truman
himself, have maintained that
Mac Arthur's refusal to stop at
the thirty-eighth parallel and
his confident assurances to
Washington that China would
never enter the conflict lulled
the president into a false sense
of security. In fact, recent
study confirms that both Tru
man and Acheson, as well as
Mac Arthur, were behind the
idea from the start, hoping to
destroy Kim II Sung and thus,
in their estimation, deal Mos
cow a heavy blow.
Little substance
Outside of the intriguing
anecdotes, however, there is
little substance to the book.
Like many biographers, Man
chester becomes so engrossed
in detail that he loses sight of
historical forces that shaped
both Mac Arthur and the world
around him. Manchester ver
ges on psychological reduc
tionism in his emphasis on
Mac Arthur's need to match his
father's heroic "dash up Mis
sionary Ridge" or his self
image as a nineteenth century
gentleman warrior. He never
places Mac Arthur in the larger
context of international
geopolitics or economic con
flict. Nor does he critically
examine the "liberalism"
Mac Arthur displayed in the
Philippines and in Japan; he
makes no connection between
Mac Arthur and the liberal
ideologies of paternalism and
economic self-interest which
sanctioned and reinforced
American expansion into and
dominance over parts of the

Pacific.
Manchester's preoccupation
with Mac Arthur also causes
him to overestimate the gener
al's impact on the American
occupation of Japan. He per
sonalizes the occupation, even
contending that Japan's exper
iment in representative gov
ernment would have failed if
the "general had been less
than omnipotent." Above all,
he slights the Japanese as a
hapless, passive people,
wholly subservient to their
"omnipotent," "benevolent
dictator." He ingores the
groundswell of political activity
in Japan which greeted the re
forms offered by the Ameri
cans. Moreover, Manchester
shows no critical understand
ing of the larger economic and
social issues which shaped
postwar Japan. Thus, the im
pact of the Korean War goes
wholly unexplained. It was the
prosperity generated by the
war that stabilized the
Japanese economy, thus en
couraging the development of
representative or bourgeoise
democracy in the postwar
period.
Cliche-ridden
But perhaps more damaging
is Manchester's stereotyped
and cliche-ridden treatment of
East Asia and its people. Like
many Americans he views East
Asia as an undifferentiated "O
riental" monolith and is as
awed as McArthur's contem
poraries by the geiferal's sup
posed grasp of the "Oriental
mind." He refers to recruits in
the Filipino army as "natives"
and to the Japanese as "Nip
ponese," which in the United
States has been a xenophobic
term connoting military fanati
cism. Prewar Japanese
teachers are described as
"quaint . . . with yellowish
buckteeth and baggy pants."
The emperor becomes their
"little sovereign . . . His mus
tache was straggly, his face co
vered with moles, his spectacle
lenses so thick that his eyes
looked as though they had
been put in by a taxidermist."
Lin Piao's Chinese troops fight
ing in Korea are predictably
"inscrutable" and of course "a
Red tide." Korea itself "hangs
like a lumpy phallus between
the sprawling thighs of Man
churia and the Sea of Japan."
Manchester is fascinated by
Mac Arthur's mistress, a
woman with whom Mac Arthur
became involved in 1930, after
the breakup of his first mar
riage. He is obsessed with
Mac Arthur's liaison with this
non-white woman; the reader
encounters her not by name
but almost always as "his Eura
sian mistress." Such condes
cending language shows Man
chester, the biographer, to be
insensitive, if not ignorant.
In short, Manchester's work
stands as a collection of fas
cinating Mac Arthur
memorabilia. But Manchester
is never convincingly able to
move frorn biography to his
tory. Mac Arthur is left
stranded, above context and
larger issues. And the people
most affected by Mac Arthur
remain as inscrutable to the
reader as they did to both
Manchester â€” and Mac Arthur.

Manchester's preoccupation
with Mac Arthur also causes
him to overestimate the gener
al's impact on the American
occupation of Japan. He per
sonalizes the occupation, even
contending that Japan's exper
iment in representative gov
ernment would have failed if
the "general had been less
than omnipotent." Above all,
he slights the Japanese as a
hapless, passive people,
wholly subservient to their
"omnipotent," "benevolent
dictator." He ingores the
groundswell of political activity
in Japan which greeted the re
forms offered by the Ameri
cans. Moreover, Manchester
shows no critical understand
ing of the larger economic and
social issues which shaped
postwar Japan. Thus, the im
pact of the Korean War goes
wholly unexplained. It was the
prosperity generated by the
war that stabilized the
Japanese economy, thus en
couraging the development of
representative or bourgeoise
democracy in the postwar
period.
Cliche-ridden
But perhaps more damaging
is Manchester's stereotyped
and cliche-ridden treatment of
East Asia and its people. Like
many Americans he views East
Asia as an undifferentiated "O
riental" monolith and is as
awed as McArthur's contem
poraries by the geiferal's sup
posed grasp of the "Oriental
mind." He refers to recruits in
the Filipino army as "natives"
and to the Japanese as "Nip
ponese," which in the United
States has been a xenophobic
term connoting military fanati
cism. Prewar Japanese
teachers are described as
"quaint . . . with yellowish
buckteeth and baggy pants."
The emperor becomes their
"little sovereign . . . His mus
tache was straggly, his face co
vered with moles, his spectacle
lenses so thick that his eyes
looked as though they had
been put in by a taxidermist."
Lin Piao's Chinese troops fight
ing in Korea are predictably
"inscrutable" and of course "a
Red tide." Korea itself "hangs
like a lumpy phallus between
the sprawling thighs of Man
churia and the Sea of Japan."
Manchester is fascinated by
Mac Arthur's mistress, a
woman with whom Mac Arthur
became involved in 1930, after
the breakup of his first mar
riage. He is obsessed with
Mac Arthur's liaison with this
non-white woman; the reader
encounters her not by name
but almost always as "his Eura
sian mistress." Such condes
cending language shows Man
chester, the biographer, to be
insensitive, if not ignorant.
In short, Manchester's work
stands as a collection of fas
cinating Mac Arthur
memorabilia. But Manchester
is never convincingly able to
move frorn biography to his
tory. Mac Arthur is left
stranded, above context and
larger issues. And the people
most affected by Mac Arthur
remain as inscrutable to the
reader as they did to both
Manchester â€” and Mac Arthur.

Mac Arthur, 1880-1964
William Manchester
Little, Brown and Company
793 pp. $15
"He was a great thundering
paradox of a man, noble and
ignoble, inspiring and out
rageous, arrogant and shy, the
best of men and the worst of
men, the most protean, most
ridiculous, and most sublime.
No more baffling, exasperating
soldier ever wore a uniform.
Flamboyant, imperious, and
apocalyptic, he carried the
plumage of a flamingo, could
not acknowledge errors, and
tried to cover up his mistakes
with sly, childish tricks. Yet he
was also endowed with great
personal charm, a will of iron,
and a soaring intellect. Un
questionably he was the most
gifted man-at-arms this nation
has produced."
Inflated prose
Manchester's lofty, inflated
prose fits well the egoistic,
theatric Mac Arthur. He has
done a thorough job of exa
mining primary and secondary
material on Mac Arthur, al
though he often leans heavily
on previously written biog
raphies, particularly that of W.
Clayton James, for both infor
mation and interpretive
framework. Scenes are vividly
written, painstakingly detailed.
He assiduously roots out all of
the quirks and contradictions
of Mac Arthur's life, exposing
Mac Arthur's paranoia and van
ity as well as his courage and
magnetism. Yet, at the same
time, the author is an obvious
admirer of Mac Arthur, and at
times his position is barely dis
tinguishable from the person
about whom he is writing.
Manchester takes special
pains to debunk some of the
myths that still envelop his pro
tagonist. He attacks the legend
of cowardly "Dugout Dug" by
documenting countless stories

of Mac Arthur's brazen disre
gard for his own safety during
excursions to the battlefront.
He also shows how Mac Arthur
privately promoted himself for
the Presidency in 1944, 1948
and 1952, while publically dis
avowing his ambitions for
reasons of military protocol.
He likewise disposes of stories
claiming that Mac Arthur had
considerable financial hold
ings in the Philippines. Man
chester also concludes that the
decision to march to the Yalu
and attempt to unify Korea
under Syngman Rhee after the
September 1950 Inchon land
ing was as much President
Truman's and Secretary of
State Acheson's as it was
Mac Arthur's. Until recently,
most scholars, and Truman
himself, have maintained that
Mac Arthur's refusal to stop at
the thirty-eighth parallel and
his confident assurances to
Washington that China would
never enter the conflict lulled
the president into a false sense
of security. In fact, recent
study confirms that both Tru
man and Acheson, as well as
Mac Arthur, were behind the
idea from the start, hoping to
destroy Kim II Sung and thus,
in their estimation, deal Mos
cow a heavy blow.
Little substance
Outside of the intriguing
anecdotes, however, there is
little substance to the book.
Like many biographers, Man
chester becomes so engrossed
in detail that he loses sight of
historical forces that shaped
both Mac Arthur and the world
around him. Manchester ver
ges on psychological reduc
tionism in his emphasis on
Mac Arthur's need to match his
father's heroic "dash up Mis
sionary Ridge" or his self
image as a nineteenth century
gentleman warrior. He never
places Mac Arthur in the larger
context of international
geopolitics or economic con
flict. Nor does he critically
examine the "liberalism"
Mac Arthur displayed in the
Philippines and in Japan; he
makes no connection between
Mac Arthur and the liberal
ideologies of paternalism and
economic self-interest which
sanctioned and reinforced
American expansion into and
dominance over parts of the

Pacific.

done a thorough job of exa
mining primary and secondary
material on Mac Arthur, al
though he often leans heavily
on previously written biog
raphies, particularly that of W.
Clayton James, for both infor
mation and interpretive
framework. Scenes are vividly
written, painstakingly detailed.
He assiduously roots out all of
the quirks and contradictions
of Mac Arthur's life, exposing
Mac Arthur's paranoia and van
ity as well as his courage and
magnetism. Yet, at the same
time, the author is an obvious
admirer of Mac Arthur, and at
times his position is barely dis
tinguishable from the person
about whom he is writing.
Manchester takes special
pains to debunk some of the
myths that still envelop his pro
tagonist. He attacks the legend
of cowardly "Dugout Dug" by
documenting countless stories

of Mac Arthur's brazen disre
gard for his own safety during
excursions to the battlefront.
He also shows how Mac Arthur
privately promoted himself for
the Presidency in 1944, 1948
and 1952, while publically dis
avowing his ambitions for
reasons of military protocol.
He likewise disposes of stories
claiming that Mac Arthur had
considerable financial hold
ings in the Philippines. Man
chester also concludes that the
decision to march to the Yalu
and attempt to unify Korea
under Syngman Rhee after the
September 1950 Inchon land
ing was as much President
Truman's and Secretary of
State Acheson's as it was
Mac Arthur's. Until recently,
most scholars, and Truman
himself, have maintained that
Mac Arthur's refusal to stop at
the thirty-eighth parallel and
his confident assurances to
Washington that China would
never enter the conflict lulled
the president into a false sense
of security. In fact, recent
study confirms that both Tru
man and Acheson, as well as
Mac Arthur, were behind the
idea from the start, hoping to
destroy Kim II Sung and thus,
in their estimation, deal Mos
cow a heavy blow.
Little substance
Outside of the intriguing
anecdotes, however, there is
little substance to the book.
Like many biographers, Man
chester becomes so engrossed
in detail that he loses sight of
historical forces that shaped
both Mac Arthur and the world
around him. Manchester ver
ges on psychological reduc
tionism in his emphasis on
Mac Arthur's need to match his
father's heroic "dash up Mis
sionary Ridge" or his self
image as a nineteenth century
gentleman warrior. He never
places Mac Arthur in the larger
context of international
geopolitics or economic con
flict. Nor does he critically
examine the "liberalism"
Mac Arthur displayed in the
Philippines and in Japan; he
makes no connection between
Mac Arthur and the liberal
ideologies of paternalism and
economic self-interest which
sanctioned and reinforced
American expansion into and
dominance over parts of the

Pacific.
Manchester's preoccupation
with Mac Arthur also causes
him to overestimate the gener
al's impact on the American
occupation of Japan. He per
sonalizes the occupation, even
contending that Japan's exper
iment in representative gov
ernment would have failed if
the "general had been less
than omnipotent." Above all,
he slights the Japanese as a
hapless, passive people,
wholly subservient to their
"omnipotent," "benevolent
dictator." He ingores the
groundswell of political activity
in Japan which greeted the re
forms offered by the Ameri
cans. Moreover, Manchester
shows no critical understand
ing of the larger economic and
social issues which shaped
postwar Japan. Thus, the im
pact of the Korean War goes
wholly unexplained. It was the
prosperity generated by the
war that stabilized the
Japanese economy, thus en
couraging the development of
representative or bourgeoise
democracy in the postwar
period.
Cliche-ridden
But perhaps more damaging
is Manchester's stereotyped
and cliche-ridden treatment of
East Asia and its people. Like
many Americans he views East
Asia as an undifferentiated "O
riental" monolith and is as
awed as McArthur's contem
poraries by the geiferal's sup
posed grasp of the "Oriental
mind." He refers to recruits in
the Filipino army as "natives"
and to the Japanese as "Nip
ponese," which in the United
States has been a xenophobic
term connoting military fanati
cism. Prewar Japanese
teachers are described as
"quaint . . . with yellowish
buckteeth and baggy pants."
The emperor becomes their
"little sovereign . . . His mus
tache was straggly, his face co
vered with moles, his spectacle
lenses so thick that his eyes
looked as though they had
been put in by a taxidermist."
Lin Piao's Chinese troops fight
ing in Korea are predictably
"inscrutable" and of course "a
Red tide." Korea itself "hangs
like a lumpy phallus between
the sprawling thighs of Man
churia and the Sea of Japan."
Manchester is fascinated by
Mac Arthur's mistress, a
woman with whom Mac Arthur
became involved in 1930, after
the breakup of his first mar
riage. He is obsessed with
Mac Arthur's liaison with this
non-white woman; the reader
encounters her not by name
but almost always as "his Eura
sian mistress." Such condes
cending language shows Man
chester, the biographer, to be
insensitive, if not ignorant.
In short, Manchester's work
stands as a collection of fas
cinating Mac Arthur
memorabilia. But Manchester
is never convincingly able to
move frorn biography to his
tory. Mac Arthur is left
stranded, above context and
larger issues. And the people
most affected by Mac Arthur
remain as inscrutable to the
reader as they did to both
Manchester â€” and Mac Arthur.

Mac Arthur, 1880-1964
William Manchester
Little, Brown and Company
793 pp. $15
"He was a great thundering
paradox of a man, noble and
ignoble, inspiring and out
rageous, arrogant and shy, the
best of men and the worst of
men, the most protean, most
ridiculous, and most sublime.
No more baffling, exasperating
soldier ever wore a uniform.
Flamboyant, imperious, and
apocalyptic, he carried the
plumage of a flamingo, could
not acknowledge errors, and
tried to cover up his mistakes
with sly, childish tricks. Yet he
was also endowed with great
personal charm, a will of iron,
and a soaring intellect. Un
questionably he was the most
gifted man-at-arms this nation
has produced."
