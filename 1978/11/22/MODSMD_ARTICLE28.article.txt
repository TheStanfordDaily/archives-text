Even though writer John
D. Mac Donald and his not
quite detective creation
Travis McGee often appear
tobeachingly weary in their
new novel, The Empty Cop
per Sea, the book has a con
fident feel to it — as if they
picked themselves off the
floor and found an unex
pected supply of adrenalin
someplace. Although this
may not be the best possible
mix, here it's a successful
one.
John D. Mac Donald pub
lished his first novel in 1946.
In 1964, he began the Travis
McGee series with The
Deep Blue Cood-By, a thin
novel that was largely indis
tinguishable from much of
his preceeding output,
most of which was ending
up on airport bookshelves.
While remaining prolific (he
has written more than 60
books and The Empty Cop
per Sea is the 17th Travis
McGee novel), Mac Donald
has ridden the McGee
novels' gradual success to
become a much stronger

writer, a more confident
writer.
And it shows a lot of con
fidence for a "hardboiled"
mystery writer like Mac-
Donald to let his tough guy
hero grow old, which he
begins to do in this novel.
Chandler didn't do it with
Philip Marlowe and Ham
mett stopped writing long
before he faced such a di
lemma.
But McCee's slide into
middle-age is hardly a
smooth one. A man of the
sea, or, better said, a man of
the Florida coast, McGee is
more at home on his boat,
"The Busted Flush," than he
is on land. McGee inti
mately knows the people
who inhabit the sprawling
coastal towns and is there
fore all-too-familiar with the
various formsof crimethese
people engage in. When
one of his friends finds him
self in trouble, McGee be
gins his "salvage work."
This go-around, McGee is
out to clear the name of a
Captain Van Harder, skip
per of the boat "The Julie,"
the owner of which "unfor
tunately" fell overboard
while Van Harder was
passed-out on the deck.
Intrigue
But it's hardly clear
whether Van Harder is at
fault, and it's even less clear
whether or not the owner of
the boat, Hub Lawless,
didn't fake his own death in
ordertoescape his business
debts. With the limited ob
jective of getting Van Har
der's license back so he can
work his trade, McGee and
his friend Meyer head for
Timber Bay, where the acci
dent occurred. Of course,
they end up accomplishing
much more than this.
But in the melancholic

first half of the novel,
McGee finds that he can't
go at the investigation with
his customary obsessive ex
pertness. "]ust as the idea of
an ancient hippie is gross
and ludicrous, so is the idea
of an elderly beach bum,"
he muses. "I dreaded the
shape of the gray years
ahead and wished to hop
out of myself."
Because the book is seen
entirely from McGee's vie
wpoint, the reader is liable
to sink down as low as
McGee does. Though
McGee's straightforward
first-person narration is
hardly as incisive (or as con
voluted) as, say, Faulkner's,
his psyche is revealed
starkly, with force and be
lievability, which are the
goals of the best first
person narratives.
Awkwardly touching
But Mac Donald's mass
market sense is too acute to
allow McGee to wallow in
reveries about his "gray
years." So he has McGee fall
in love. Mac Donald is more
than a little bit awkward
with the incredible woman
character he creates for his
hero, and is equally clumsy
with McGee's feelings for
her ("We could have been
the only two people in the
world. I wanted to kiss her.
My heart was in my
throat."), but the prose is
often touching; it's like
when you see a friend cry
for the first time.
But the best thing about
McGee's transformation is
that it lifts McGee and the
book right out of the dol
drums and into a driving
and surprising finish.
Constantly diverting
The ending is surprising
but not breathtaking like
the English mysteries often

can be; Mac Donald isn't in
terested in intricate
puzzlers. The McGee
novels stay mysterious by
constantly diverting your at
tention with simple charac
ter vignettes.
McCee's eye is sharp and
his descriptions are too.
Describing motorcyclists in
a bar, he says: "all the
macho whiskers and the
leather clothes and the dead
eyes and their feral, abused
little women. Hundreds of
them roar up and down the
highway in formation, mak
ing a formal protest about
the law forcing them to wear
a helmet. . . . Very macho.
But when they don't wear
helmets, they abuse the
taxpayers, taking a couple
of weeks to die in intensive
care, their primitive brains
jellied by hard impact with
the concrete highway.
Somebody has to pick them
up when they go down and
deliver them to Emergency,
regrettably."
Explodes
It's stripped-down,
hard-edged writing such as
this which has led to Mac-
Donald's recent "great
novelist, not just a great
mystery writer" status. To
some extent, that's de
served; much of what Mac-
Donald does works as the
best movies do — grabbing
you the first time you ex
perience them. But great
novelist tags are also ir
relevant; at worst, they're
arty and pretentious. And
The Empty Copper Sea not
only isn't these things, but
like much of Mac Donald's
best writing, it explodes
such labels before they have
a chance to take hold. But
perhaps that's what great
writing is.
