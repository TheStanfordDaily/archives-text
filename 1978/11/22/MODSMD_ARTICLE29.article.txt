Yardbird Lives!
Ishmael Reed and Al Young,
eds.
Grove Press
288 pp. $5.95
The chronic disease of most
iiterary magazines, particularly
the regional ones, is tedious
ness. Small magazines may be
edifying, educational, and
even, at times, important —
but seldom are they readable.
The Yardbird Reader, which
made its debut in 1972, cer
tainly does not fall into this
mold. Perhaps this was be
cause of the spirit of rebellion
in which the magazine was
formed, or perhaps it was sim
ply because of the per
sonalities of its founders.
Ishmael Reed and Al Young —
in any event the writers of the
Yardbird Reader were im
mediately distinguished from
other artistes by actually having
something to say. More often
than not they said it well.
Yardbird, like its namesake,
was short-lived. Nonetheless,
a compendium of the best
material Yardbird published
during its five years has been

collected in the appropriately
titled collection, Yardbird
Lives.
The obscure
The authors range from the
well-known to the practically
obscure. Surprisingly, it is the
latter who add the most to the
publication. Mike Newman's
account of the worst habit, in
"The Addict," is a compelling
story which seems to border
on autobiography. In the
poetry, as well, the lesser

known generally present the
best.
All, however, is not perfect.
Much of the writing is overly
pretentious — it attempts to
present a type of writing which
I can only describe as "sophis
ticated beat." This contradic
tion in terms perhaps reveals
why it falls short. Claude
Brown's blazing attack, "In
Consequence of Manchild," is
the most overly self-righteous
piece of writing I have read
since I last perused Ezra
Pound's essays.
jazz
As its name indicates,
Yardbird is deeply rooted in
jazz. Sometimes this shows in
the selection of a subject, more
often in the use of an unusual
idiom or metaphor. The writ
ing exudes the jargon of the

jazz club and the sensibility of
the jazz fan. The jazz approach
is not done with historical pre
cision, as one would find in an
over-zealous jazz critic, but
with affection and admiration.
In "Jazz Muse for Clifford
Brown" the difference bet
ween Brown's horn and his
lover fades, becomes irrelev
ant. The spirit of the music per
vades, never the notes or
chords.
Like all improvisations,
Yardbird makes up for its lack
of balance with added inspira
tion. I can make no claims for
how the collection will wear
with time. It strikes me as being
very vibrant and moving right
now. And immediacy in art is
not the mortal sin some critics
would make it out to be.

ween Brown's horn and his
lover fades, becomes irrelev
ant. The spirit of the music per
vades, never the notes or
chords.
Like all improvisations,
Yardbird makes up for its lack
of balance with added inspira
tion. I can make no claims for
how the collection will wear
with time. It strikes me as being
very vibrant and moving right
now. And immediacy in art is
not the mortal sin some critics
would make it out to be.

Yardbird Lives!
Ishmael Reed and Al Young,
eds.
Grove Press
288 pp. $5.95
The chronic disease of most
iiterary magazines, particularly
the regional ones, is tedious
ness. Small magazines may be
edifying, educational, and
even, at times, important —
but seldom are they readable.
The Yardbird Reader, which
made its debut in 1972, cer
tainly does not fall into this
mold. Perhaps this was be
cause of the spirit of rebellion
in which the magazine was
formed, or perhaps it was sim
ply because of the per
sonalities of its founders.
Ishmael Reed and Al Young —
in any event the writers of the
Yardbird Reader were im
mediately distinguished from
other artistes by actually having
something to say. More often
than not they said it well.
Yardbird, like its namesake,
was short-lived. Nonetheless,
a compendium of the best
material Yardbird published
during its five years has been

collected in the appropriately
titled collection, Yardbird
Lives.
The obscure
The authors range from the
well-known to the practically
obscure. Surprisingly, it is the
latter who add the most to the
publication. Mike Newman's
account of the worst habit, in
"The Addict," is a compelling
story which seems to border
on autobiography. In the
poetry, as well, the lesser

known generally present the
best.
All, however, is not perfect.
Much of the writing is overly
pretentious — it attempts to
present a type of writing which
I can only describe as "sophis
ticated beat." This contradic
tion in terms perhaps reveals
why it falls short. Claude
Brown's blazing attack, "In
Consequence of Manchild," is
the most overly self-righteous
piece of writing I have read
since I last perused Ezra
Pound's essays.
jazz
As its name indicates,
Yardbird is deeply rooted in
jazz. Sometimes this shows in
the selection of a subject, more
often in the use of an unusual
idiom or metaphor. The writ
ing exudes the jargon of the

jazz club and the sensibility of
the jazz fan. The jazz approach
is not done with historical pre
cision, as one would find in an
over-zealous jazz critic, but
with affection and admiration.
In "Jazz Muse for Clifford
Brown" the difference bet
ween Brown's horn and his
lover fades, becomes irrelev
ant. The spirit of the music per
vades, never the notes or
chords.
Like all improvisations,
Yardbird makes up for its lack
of balance with added inspira
tion. I can make no claims for
how the collection will wear
with time. It strikes me as being
very vibrant and moving right
now. And immediacy in art is
