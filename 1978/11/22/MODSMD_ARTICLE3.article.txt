# Many fled into Guyanese wilderness
## Troops searching for Temple survivors 
### 
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — Sur
vivors of the Jonestown cult suicide,
menaced by flesh-eating piranha fish
and other deadly perils of the jungle,
eluded searching soldiers in the
nearly impenetrable Guyanese wil
derness for a third day yesterday.
Police Commissioner Lloyd Barker
estimated between 200 and 300 sur
vivors fled into the bush and said
some possibly made it to friendly In
dian villages. Other sources place
the number of survivors at nearly
800.
At the site of the mass suicide, the
corpses of 409 members of the
American religious sect lay decom
posing in the equatorial sun. U.S.
military officials were planning to air
lift the bodies to the United States.
A State Department spokesman in
Washington said Guyana asked that
the U.S. government remove all the
bodies, despite their state of decom
position. He had said earlier some of
the bodies might be buried at the
jungle settlement.
"The bodies are starting tp swell
and some seem ready to burst," said
U.S. Embassy official Peter Lon
doner. About 200 U.S. troopers,
awaiting the arrival of a dozen
helicopters, were standing by in
Georgetown for the evacuation op
eration.
Members fled
Estimates of the number of sect
members who fled the Jonestown
camp Saturday during the ritual of
self-destruction by poison ranged
from 200 to more than 775. Stephan

Jones, son of the Peoples Temple
founder, the Rev. Jim Jones, esti
mated some 500 had gone into the
inhospitable rain forest.
Commissioner Barker, whose na
tional police are conducting the
search along with Guyanese soldiers,
said he believed the figures for the
Jonestown population and survivors
had been over-estimated. "We think
the survivors would be more like 200
to 300," he said.
Barker told reporters in
Georgetown there are trails linking
Jonestown to small Indian villages
and also crossing into Venezuela,
about 15 miles to the north. Some
Indians had traded with the U.S.
settlers and received medical treat
ment at the camp, he said, and he felt
any survivors seeking refuge with the
Indians would be well treated.
Search parties
Search parties were sent to some
of the villages, he said, but had not
yet reported back.
Defense Department officials in
Washington said Guyana asked that
U.S. helicopters be equipped with
loudspeakers to help contact the
survivors. They emphasized no U.S.
forces would be engaged in the
search on the ground.
Jim Jones ordered the mass
suicide, a ritual he code-named
"White Knight" and had rehearsed
with his followers, after sect mem
bers ambushed and killed Rep. Leo
Ryan (D-San Mateo) and four mem
bers of Ryan's party that made an in
vestigative visit to the camp.

Jones was one of three persons
who died of gunshot wounds, appa
rently self-inflicted. About one
quarter of the dead were children,
some babies whose mothers repor
tedly fed them the brew of Kool Aid
and cyanide.
The 19-year-old Stephan Jones,
who denounced his fatheras a "man
obsessed," told reporters yesterday
his greatest concern now was for the
well-being of those who fled into the
jungle, apparently unwilling to de
stroy themselves along with their
suicidal master.
"I want to do all I can to see every
body gets a chance to find some
place to settle down and start over
again, if that is possible," he said.
Won't return
But the younger Jones, who had
left the camp three weeks ago on a
trip with its basketball team, said the
survivors could never return to
Jonestown, a four-year-old agricul
tural commune cut out of virginal
forest 150 miles northwest of
Georgetown.
Stephan Jones said 45 cult mem
bers were in Georgetown when the
Jonestown settlers killed them
selves.
U.S. officials have said 14 survivors
reappeared in Jonestown and
Guyanese authorities say three sect
members have been arrested in con
nection with the attack on Ryan's
party at the Port Kaituma airstrip,
eight miles south of Jonestown.

Barker said about 40 settlers had
been found both at Jonestown and
Port Kaituma, but he gave no break
down of the figures.
Survival chances
Guyanese familiar with the area
questioned whether the fugitives
could long survive without shelter
and steady food supplies in a jungle
filled with swamps and criss-crossed
by streams and rivers inhabited by
piranhas and electric eels. The rainy
season is just starting.
Barker said there were indications
some of the survivors were working
in the jungle and when they returned
to the camp and saw the bodies they
gathered food supplies and went
back into the bush.
The Rev. Jones is known to have
instilled a fervid will to survive
among some of his followers, how
ever, telling them their settlements
could become sanctuaries where
they would escape a nuclear
holocaust or other calamity. A fear
that outsiders were about to destroy
their small society apparently
triggered the mass suicide.
About 200 Guyanese troops and
police were trying to track down the
survivors around Jonestown, but of
ficials said they were hampered by
thick brush that makes it impossible
to see beyond a few feet. There is
only one road in the area, and its
potholed surface turns to mud with
the rains. Aerial surveillance is nearly
useless because of the heavy tree
cover.

U.S. officials have said 14 survivors
reappeared in Jonestown and
Guyanese authorities say three sect
members have been arrested in con
nection with the attack on Ryan's
party at the Port Kaituma airstrip,
eight miles south of Jonestown.

Barker said about 40 settlers had
been found both at Jonestown and
Port Kaituma, but he gave no break
down of the figures.
Survival chances
Guyanese familiar with the area
questioned whether the fugitives
could long survive without shelter
and steady food supplies in a jungle
filled with swamps and criss-crossed
by streams and rivers inhabited by
piranhas and electric eels. The rainy
season is just starting.
Barker said there were indications
some of the survivors were working
in the jungle and when they returned
to the camp and saw the bodies they
gathered food supplies and went
back into the bush.
The Rev. Jones is known to have
instilled a fervid will to survive
among some of his followers, how
ever, telling them their settlements
could become sanctuaries where
they would escape a nuclear
holocaust or other calamity. A fear
that outsiders were about to destroy
their small society apparently
triggered the mass suicide.
About 200 Guyanese troops and
police were trying to track down the
survivors around Jonestown, but of
ficials said they were hampered by
thick brush that makes it impossible
to see beyond a few feet. There is
only one road in the area, and its
potholed surface turns to mud with
the rains. Aerial surveillance is nearly
useless because of the heavy tree
cover.
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — Sur
vivors of the Jonestown cult suicide,
menaced by flesh-eating piranha fish
and other deadly perils of the jungle,
eluded searching soldiers in the
nearly impenetrable Guyanese wil
derness for a third day yesterday.
Police Commissioner Lloyd Barker
estimated between 200 and 300 sur
vivors fled into the bush and said
some possibly made it to friendly In
dian villages. Other sources place
the number of survivors at nearly
800.
At the site of the mass suicide, the
corpses of 409 members of the
American religious sect lay decom
posing in the equatorial sun. U.S.
military officials were planning to air
lift the bodies to the United States.
A State Department spokesman in
Washington said Guyana asked that
the U.S. government remove all the
bodies, despite their state of decom
position. He had said earlier some of
the bodies might be buried at the
jungle settlement.
"The bodies are starting tp swell
and some seem ready to burst," said
U.S. Embassy official Peter Lon
doner. About 200 U.S. troopers,
awaiting the arrival of a dozen
helicopters, were standing by in
Georgetown for the evacuation op
eration.
Members fled
Estimates of the number of sect
members who fled the Jonestown
camp Saturday during the ritual of
self-destruction by poison ranged
from 200 to more than 775. Stephan

Jones, son of the Peoples Temple
founder, the Rev. Jim Jones, esti
mated some 500 had gone into the
inhospitable rain forest.
Commissioner Barker, whose na
tional police are conducting the
search along with Guyanese soldiers,
said he believed the figures for the
Jonestown population and survivors
had been over-estimated. "We think
the survivors would be more like 200
to 300," he said.
Barker told reporters in
Georgetown there are trails linking
Jonestown to small Indian villages
and also crossing into Venezuela,
about 15 miles to the north. Some
Indians had traded with the U.S.
settlers and received medical treat
ment at the camp, he said, and he felt
any survivors seeking refuge with the
Indians would be well treated.
Search parties
Search parties were sent to some
of the villages, he said, but had not
yet reported back.
Defense Department officials in
Washington said Guyana asked that
U.S. helicopters be equipped with
loudspeakers to help contact the
survivors. They emphasized no U.S.
forces would be engaged in the
search on the ground.
Jim Jones ordered the mass
suicide, a ritual he code-named
"White Knight" and had rehearsed
with his followers, after sect mem
bers ambushed and killed Rep. Leo
Ryan (D-San Mateo) and four mem
bers of Ryan's party that made an in
vestigative visit to the camp.

Jones was one of three persons
who died of gunshot wounds, appa
rently self-inflicted. About one
quarter of the dead were children,
some babies whose mothers repor
tedly fed them the brew of Kool Aid
and cyanide.
The 19-year-old Stephan Jones,
who denounced his fatheras a "man
obsessed," told reporters yesterday
his greatest concern now was for the
well-being of those who fled into the
jungle, apparently unwilling to de
stroy themselves along with their
suicidal master.
"I want to do all I can to see every
body gets a chance to find some
place to settle down and start over
again, if that is possible," he said.
Won't return
But the younger Jones, who had
left the camp three weeks ago on a
trip with its basketball team, said the
survivors could never return to
Jonestown, a four-year-old agricul
tural commune cut out of virginal
forest 150 miles northwest of
Georgetown.
Stephan Jones said 45 cult mem
bers were in Georgetown when the
Jonestown settlers killed them
selves.

survivors. They emphasized no U.S.
forces would be engaged in the
search on the ground.
Jim Jones ordered the mass
suicide, a ritual he code-named
"White Knight" and had rehearsed
with his followers, after sect mem
bers ambushed and killed Rep. Leo
Ryan (D-San Mateo) and four mem
bers of Ryan's party that made an in
vestigative visit to the camp.

Jones was one of three persons
who died of gunshot wounds, appa
rently self-inflicted. About one
quarter of the dead were children,
some babies whose mothers repor
tedly fed them the brew of Kool Aid
and cyanide.
The 19-year-old Stephan Jones,
who denounced his fatheras a "man
obsessed," told reporters yesterday
his greatest concern now was for the
well-being of those who fled into the
jungle, apparently unwilling to de
stroy themselves along with their
suicidal master.
"I want to do all I can to see every
body gets a chance to find some
place to settle down and start over
again, if that is possible," he said.
Won't return
But the younger Jones, who had
left the camp three weeks ago on a
trip with its basketball team, said the
survivors could never return to
Jonestown, a four-year-old agricul
tural commune cut out of virginal
forest 150 miles northwest of
Georgetown.
Stephan Jones said 45 cult mem
bers were in Georgetown when the
Jonestown settlers killed them
selves.
U.S. officials have said 14 survivors
reappeared in Jonestown and
Guyanese authorities say three sect
members have been arrested in con
nection with the attack on Ryan's
party at the Port Kaituma airstrip,
eight miles south of Jonestown.

Barker said about 40 settlers had
been found both at Jonestown and
Port Kaituma, but he gave no break
down of the figures.
Survival chances
Guyanese familiar with the area
questioned whether the fugitives
could long survive without shelter
and steady food supplies in a jungle
filled with swamps and criss-crossed
by streams and rivers inhabited by
piranhas and electric eels. The rainy
season is just starting.
Barker said there were indications
some of the survivors were working
in the jungle and when they returned
to the camp and saw the bodies they
gathered food supplies and went
back into the bush.
The Rev. Jones is known to have
instilled a fervid will to survive
among some of his followers, how
ever, telling them their settlements
could become sanctuaries where
they would escape a nuclear
holocaust or other calamity. A fear
that outsiders were about to destroy
their small society apparently
triggered the mass suicide.
About 200 Guyanese troops and
police were trying to track down the
survivors around Jonestown, but of
ficials said they were hampered by
thick brush that makes it impossible
to see beyond a few feet. There is
only one road in the area, and its
potholed surface turns to mud with
the rains. Aerial surveillance is nearly
useless because of the heavy tree
cover.
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — Sur
vivors of the Jonestown cult suicide,
menaced by flesh-eating piranha fish
and other deadly perils of the jungle,
eluded searching soldiers in the
nearly impenetrable Guyanese wil
derness for a third day yesterday.
Police Commissioner Lloyd Barker
estimated between 200 and 300 sur
vivors fled into the bush and said
some possibly made it to friendly In
dian villages. Other sources place
the number of survivors at nearly
800.
At the site of the mass suicide, the
corpses of 409 members of the
American religious sect lay decom
posing in the equatorial sun. U.S.
military officials were planning to air
lift the bodies to the United States.
A State Department spokesman in
Washington said Guyana asked that
the U.S. government remove all the
bodies, despite their state of decom
position. He had said earlier some of
the bodies might be buried at the
jungle settlement.
"The bodies are starting tp swell
and some seem ready to burst," said
U.S. Embassy official Peter Lon
doner. About 200 U.S. troopers,
awaiting the arrival of a dozen
helicopters, were standing by in
Georgetown for the evacuation op
eration.
Members fled
Estimates of the number of sect
members who fled the Jonestown
camp Saturday during the ritual of
self-destruction by poison ranged
from 200 to more than 775. Stephan

Jones, son of the Peoples Temple
founder, the Rev. Jim Jones, esti
mated some 500 had gone into the
inhospitable rain forest.
Commissioner Barker, whose na
tional police are conducting the
search along with Guyanese soldiers,
said he believed the figures for the
Jonestown population and survivors
had been over-estimated. "We think
the survivors would be more like 200
to 300," he said.
Barker told reporters in
Georgetown there are trails linking
Jonestown to small Indian villages
and also crossing into Venezuela,
about 15 miles to the north. Some
Indians had traded with the U.S.
settlers and received medical treat
ment at the camp, he said, and he felt
any survivors seeking refuge with the
Indians would be well treated.
Search parties
Search parties were sent to some
of the villages, he said, but had not
yet reported back.
Defense Department officials in
Washington said Guyana asked that
U.S. helicopters be equipped with
loudspeakers to help contact the
survivors. They emphasized no U.S.
forces would be engaged in the
search on the ground.
