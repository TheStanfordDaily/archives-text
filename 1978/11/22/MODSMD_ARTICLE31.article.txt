Germany 1866-1945

For some reason, it's not
enough for History Prof.
Gordon Craig to have been
the honored subject of a
Chaparral inquiry into the
cultist potential of German
history. For some reason,*
it's not enough for Craig to
have written several
award-winning books about
Germany, the Prussian army
and diplomatic history, to
have won excellence-in
teaching awards both here
and at Princeton and be na
tionally acclaimed as a Ger
man history scholar. For
some reason, it's not
enough for the man to be
the ).E. Wallace Sterling Pro
fessor of Humanities here.
No. Fie has to go ahead
and write a book for the Ox
ford History of Modern
Europe which was de
scribed by one reviewer as a
potential "standard one
volume history of modern
Germany," although Craig
himself described the book
as being "intended for the
intelligent lay public."
How singularly approp
riate, though, when you sit
back and think about it, that
Gordon Craig should be the
one to write Germany:
1866-1945. Who could look
more like your classic con
ception of Otto von Bis
marck or some Prussian
junker from the 19th cen
tury?
Not favorite
Craig admitted that this
book was not his favorite
work. He said many scho
lars consider his 1955 book,
The Politics of the Prussian
Army his classic, while he
personally had "more fun"
writing his history of the
Battle of Koniggratz.
But he added that he
thought this book is "a bet
ter book ... I'm a better
historian than I was 20 years
ago."
Craig's new book surveys
the history of Germany from
its unification under Bis
marck to the collapse of the
Third Reich under Hitler.

He quickly emphasized
that despite his personal
specialization in the fields
of political, diplomatic and
military history, his new
book is more socially
oriented and devotes much
time to the prevailing social
conditions and intellectual
currents. One reviewer
wrote that:
Craig is able to link his ac
count of German political
development with a deep
knowledge of German lit
erature and culture, so
that the novelists and pain
ters and musicians discus
sed are used to illustrate
the nature of the society in

which they lived instead of
being, as so often in gen
eral works of history, a list
of names tacked on to a
political narrative.
Craig said he viewed
Germany as a nation whose
main strength might well
have lain in its cultural con
tributions to western civili
zation and not in the chaos
of world politics. He quoted
one German statesman of
the period as having said, "if
only we would not try to do
so much we would get along
. . . but we do try and we
make enemies instead."
Political education
However, despite his at
tention to social conditions,
he explained that "any
book" about Germany in
this period "has to ask cer
tain questions."
"Why, for instance,"
asked Craig, "did Germany
develop, or fail to develop
politically, and why was its
history so bloody? Why did
Bismarck's empire fail; why
did Weimar fail; why did Hi
tler come to power? These
are all controversial
points."
Craig said the answer to
these questions turns on
the "failure of Germans to
gain political education to
the same extent as other
western nations." While the
history of France and of Eng
land was marked by revolu
tions and popular uprisings,
Germany was not even a un
ified state until the late 19th
century, and thus was rela
tively inexperienced in the
exercise of international
power.
Craig explained in his pre
face that
(Bismarck) soon revealed
himself to be an uncom
promising conservative,
intent upon preserving the
structures of ancient au
thority against all the
forces of change, increas
ingly jealous of his own
prerogatives, and when
the rights of others ap
peared to threaten them,
ever more willing to deny
the validity of those rights.
His ascendancy in the
council of nations doubt
less enhanced the self
esteem of his people, but
his domestic governance
robbed it of opportunities
to grow in self-reliance
and to acquire the rudi
ments of political educa
tion.
Craig ends the book with

a suggestion that
while destroying much
that was good in Germany
and many thousands of
people who might have
made that good better, Hi
tler also eliminated much
that was bad. . . . Adolf
Hitler was nothing if not
thorough. He destroyed
the basis of the traditional
resistance to modernity
and liberalism just as
completely as he had de
stroyed the structure of
the Rechtstaat and democ
racy ... he left the Ger
man people nothing that
could be repaired or built
upon . . . Hitler had not
only restored to them the
options that they had had a
century earlier but had
also bequeathed to them
the memory of horror to
help them with their
choice.
Reactions
Craig said he has not been
surprised by the reactions
to his book. He said the
younger historians have
criticized him for paying too
close attention to people,
rather than economic and
political trends. But he re
plied that "I think it's fair to
say that in my work I always
say more about people,"
and for that reason he has
been labeled a
traditionalist. "In any given
situation it is the action of
human beings that will de
termine the actual course of
events," he added.
As a final note, Craig in his
preface reveals part of his
general approach to history.
The darkest pages in his
tory are often the most in
structive. The brief history
of united Germany . . .
demands the attention of
reflective men, not only
for what it has to teach
about the role of fear and
cupidity and obtuseness in
human affairs, about the
seduction of power and
the consequences of polit
ical irresponsibility, and
about the apparently limit
less inhumanity that man
is capable of inflicting
upon his fellow, but be
cause it also has much to
say about courage and
steadfastness, about devo
tion to the cause of liberty,
and about resistance to
the evils of tyranny.
In this book, Craig has
captured the humanity
which he so treasures in the
study of history.

a suggestion that
while destroying much
that was good in Germany
and many thousands of
people who might have
made that good better, Hi
tler also eliminated much
that was bad. . . . Adolf
Hitler was nothing if not
thorough. He destroyed
the basis of the traditional
resistance to modernity
and liberalism just as
completely as he had de
stroyed the structure of
the Rechtstaat and democ
racy ... he left the Ger
man people nothing that
could be repaired or built
upon . . . Hitler had not
only restored to them the
options that they had had a
century earlier but had
also bequeathed to them
the memory of horror to
help them with their
choice.
Reactions
Craig said he has not been
surprised by the reactions
to his book. He said the
younger historians have
criticized him for paying too
close attention to people,
rather than economic and
political trends. But he re
plied that "I think it's fair to
say that in my work I always
say more about people,"
and for that reason he has
been labeled a
traditionalist. "In any given
situation it is the action of
human beings that will de
termine the actual course of
events," he added.
As a final note, Craig in his
preface reveals part of his
general approach to history.
The darkest pages in his
tory are often the most in
structive. The brief history
of united Germany . . .
demands the attention of
reflective men, not only
for what it has to teach
about the role of fear and
cupidity and obtuseness in
human affairs, about the
seduction of power and
the consequences of polit
ical irresponsibility, and
about the apparently limit
less inhumanity that man
is capable of inflicting
upon his fellow, but be
cause it also has much to
say about courage and
steadfastness, about devo
tion to the cause of liberty,
and about resistance to
the evils of tyranny.
In this book, Craig has
captured the humanity
which he so treasures in the
study of history.

Germany 1866-1945
Cordon A. Craig

For some reason, it's not
enough for History Prof.
Gordon Craig to have been
the honored subject of a
Chaparral inquiry into the
cultist potential of German
history. For some reason,*
it's not enough for Craig to
have written several
award-winning books about
Germany, the Prussian army
and diplomatic history, to
have won excellence-in
teaching awards both here
and at Princeton and be na
tionally acclaimed as a Ger
man history scholar. For
some reason, it's not
enough for the man to be
the ).E. Wallace Sterling Pro
fessor of Humanities here.
No. Fie has to go ahead
and write a book for the Ox
ford History of Modern
Europe which was de
scribed by one reviewer as a
potential "standard one
volume history of modern
Germany," although Craig
himself described the book
as being "intended for the
intelligent lay public."
How singularly approp
riate, though, when you sit
back and think about it, that
Gordon Craig should be the
one to write Germany:
1866-1945. Who could look
more like your classic con
ception of Otto von Bis
marck or some Prussian
junker from the 19th cen
tury?
Not favorite
Craig admitted that this
book was not his favorite
work. He said many scho
lars consider his 1955 book,
The Politics of the Prussian
Army his classic, while he
personally had "more fun"
writing his history of the
Battle of Koniggratz.
But he added that he
thought this book is "a bet
ter book ... I'm a better
historian than I was 20 years
ago."
Craig's new book surveys
the history of Germany from
its unification under Bis
marck to the collapse of the
Third Reich under Hitler.

He quickly emphasized
that despite his personal
specialization in the fields
of political, diplomatic and
military history, his new
book is more socially
oriented and devotes much
time to the prevailing social
conditions and intellectual
currents. One reviewer
wrote that:
Craig is able to link his ac
count of German political
development with a deep
knowledge of German lit
erature and culture, so
that the novelists and pain
ters and musicians discus
sed are used to illustrate
the nature of the society in

which they lived instead of
being, as so often in gen
eral works of history, a list
of names tacked on to a
political narrative.
Craig said he viewed
Germany as a nation whose
main strength might well
have lain in its cultural con
tributions to western civili
zation and not in the chaos
of world politics. He quoted
one German statesman of
the period as having said, "if
only we would not try to do
so much we would get along
. . . but we do try and we
make enemies instead."
Political education
However, despite his at
tention to social conditions,
he explained that "any
book" about Germany in
this period "has to ask cer
tain questions."
"Why, for instance,"
asked Craig, "did Germany
develop, or fail to develop
politically, and why was its
history so bloody? Why did
Bismarck's empire fail; why
did Weimar fail; why did Hi
tler come to power? These
are all controversial
points."
Craig said the answer to
these questions turns on
the "failure of Germans to
gain political education to
the same extent as other
western nations." While the
history of France and of Eng
land was marked by revolu
tions and popular uprisings,
Germany was not even a un
ified state until the late 19th
century, and thus was rela
tively inexperienced in the
exercise of international
power.
Craig explained in his pre
face that
(Bismarck) soon revealed
himself to be an uncom
promising conservative,
intent upon preserving the
structures of ancient au
thority against all the
forces of change, increas
ingly jealous of his own
prerogatives, and when
the rights of others ap
peared to threaten them,
ever more willing to deny
the validity of those rights.
His ascendancy in the
council of nations doubt
less enhanced the self
esteem of his people, but
his domestic governance
robbed it of opportunities
to grow in self-reliance
and to acquire the rudi
ments of political educa
tion.
Craig ends the book with

a suggestion that

which they lived instead of
being, as so often in gen
eral works of history, a list
of names tacked on to a
political narrative.
Craig said he viewed
Germany as a nation whose
main strength might well
have lain in its cultural con
tributions to western civili
zation and not in the chaos
of world politics. He quoted
one German statesman of
the period as having said, "if
only we would not try to do
so much we would get along
. . . but we do try and we
make enemies instead."
Political education
However, despite his at
tention to social conditions,
he explained that "any
book" about Germany in
this period "has to ask cer
tain questions."
"Why, for instance,"
asked Craig, "did Germany
develop, or fail to develop
politically, and why was its
history so bloody? Why did
Bismarck's empire fail; why
did Weimar fail; why did Hi
tler come to power? These
are all controversial
points."
Craig said the answer to
these questions turns on
the "failure of Germans to
gain political education to
the same extent as other
western nations." While the
history of France and of Eng
land was marked by revolu
tions and popular uprisings,
Germany was not even a un
ified state until the late 19th
century, and thus was rela
tively inexperienced in the
exercise of international
power.
Craig explained in his pre
face that
(Bismarck) soon revealed
himself to be an uncom
promising conservative,
intent upon preserving the
structures of ancient au
thority against all the
forces of change, increas
ingly jealous of his own
prerogatives, and when
the rights of others ap
peared to threaten them,
ever more willing to deny
the validity of those rights.
His ascendancy in the
council of nations doubt
less enhanced the self
esteem of his people, but
his domestic governance
robbed it of opportunities
to grow in self-reliance
and to acquire the rudi
ments of political educa
tion.
Craig ends the book with

a suggestion that
while destroying much
that was good in Germany
and many thousands of
people who might have
made that good better, Hi
tler also eliminated much
that was bad. . . . Adolf
Hitler was nothing if not
thorough. He destroyed
the basis of the traditional
resistance to modernity
and liberalism just as
completely as he had de
stroyed the structure of
the Rechtstaat and democ
racy ... he left the Ger
man people nothing that
could be repaired or built
upon . . . Hitler had not
only restored to them the
options that they had had a
century earlier but had
also bequeathed to them
the memory of horror to
help them with their
choice.
Reactions
Craig said he has not been
surprised by the reactions
to his book. He said the
younger historians have
criticized him for paying too
close attention to people,
rather than economic and
political trends. But he re
plied that "I think it's fair to
say that in my work I always
say more about people,"
and for that reason he has
been labeled a
traditionalist. "In any given
situation it is the action of
human beings that will de
termine the actual course of
events," he added.
As a final note, Craig in his
preface reveals part of his
general approach to history.
The darkest pages in his
tory are often the most in
structive. The brief history
of united Germany . . .
demands the attention of
reflective men, not only
for what it has to teach
about the role of fear and
cupidity and obtuseness in
human affairs, about the
seduction of power and
the consequences of polit
ical irresponsibility, and
about the apparently limit
less inhumanity that man
is capable of inflicting
upon his fellow, but be
cause it also has much to
say about courage and
steadfastness, about devo
tion to the cause of liberty,
and about resistance to
the evils of tyranny.
In this book, Craig has
captured the humanity
which he so treasures in the
study of history.

For some reason, it's not
enough for History Prof.
Gordon Craig to have been
the honored subject of a
Chaparral inquiry into the
cultist potential of German
history. For some reason,*
it's not enough for Craig to
have written several
award-winning books about
Germany, the Prussian army
and diplomatic history, to
have won excellence-in
teaching awards both here
and at Princeton and be na
tionally acclaimed as a Ger
man history scholar. For
some reason, it's not
enough for the man to be
the ).E. Wallace Sterling Pro
fessor of Humanities here.
No. Fie has to go ahead
and write a book for the Ox
ford History of Modern
Europe which was de
scribed by one reviewer as a
potential "standard one
volume history of modern
Germany," although Craig
himself described the book
as being "intended for the
intelligent lay public."
How singularly approp
riate, though, when you sit
back and think about it, that
Gordon Craig should be the
one to write Germany:
1866-1945. Who could look
more like your classic con
ception of Otto von Bis
marck or some Prussian
junker from the 19th cen
tury?
Not favorite
Craig admitted that this
book was not his favorite
work. He said many scho
lars consider his 1955 book,
The Politics of the Prussian
Army his classic, while he
personally had "more fun"
writing his history of the
Battle of Koniggratz.
But he added that he
thought this book is "a bet
ter book ... I'm a better
historian than I was 20 years
ago."
Craig's new book surveys
the history of Germany from
its unification under Bis
marck to the collapse of the
Third Reich under Hitler.

He quickly emphasized
that despite his personal
specialization in the fields
of political, diplomatic and
military history, his new
book is more socially
oriented and devotes much
time to the prevailing social
conditions and intellectual
currents. One reviewer
wrote that:
Craig is able to link his ac
count of German political
development with a deep
knowledge of German lit
erature and culture, so
that the novelists and pain
ters and musicians discus
sed are used to illustrate
the nature of the society in

which they lived instead of
being, as so often in gen
eral works of history, a list
of names tacked on to a
political narrative.
