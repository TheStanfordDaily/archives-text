Prelude to Terror
Helen Maclnnes
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich

Every work of art is the child
of its age; in many cases it is the
mother of the future. It follows
that each generation produces
an art of its own which can
never be repeated and which,
if understood, will illuminate
its culture. We attempt to
know past ages by studying the
art forms which have been pre
served through the graphic
"media and through the print
ing of music, drama and litera
ture: thus we can expect that
future generations will use our
printed literature as a means of
understanding our culture.
What, you may ask, does this
have to do with a review of Pre
lude to Terrorl Truthfully, I had
not planned to write anything
more than a simple book re
view. But sometimes a mun
dane task becomes more im
portant than expected, and
such is the case with this re
view. While I was reading Pre
lude to Terror and planning to
expose it for the trash that it is,
some very fundamental ques
tions came to mind. If litera
ture does indeed reflect the
age which creates it, and if we
accept Prelude to Terror as rep
resentative by virtue of its
being printed and widely read,
then what does it say about our
artistic literary tastes and thus
about our culture?
In judging this book, I used a
standard which the great
nineteenth-century novelist,
Henry James, set forth in The
Art of Fiction. "The only reason
for the existence of a novel is

that it does attempt to repre
sent life." Representation of
life means more than writing
about ill-defined and shapeless
emotions. The novelist, living a
complicated and compara
tively subtle life, will endeavor
to evoke, in the readers capa
ble of feeling them, subtle
emotions that are beyond the
reach of words.
By this criterion, Prelude to
Terror has no value as a novel
or as a work of art: Maclnnes
writes about none of life's
complex, ethereal emotions.
Instead, she attempts to ex
press life's complexity with an
entangled and unpredictable
string of events. The book's
plot, if you call an unconsoli
dated medley of fraud, mur
der, romance, conspiracy and
international terrorism a plot,
is no different than the outline
of a thousand other books of
this type. And the characters, a
dozen or so two-dimensional
replicas of humanity, are no
different from any other stock
characters: they are indistin
guishable except by sex and
physical appearance. Sadly,
Maclnnes cannot deal
adequately with even the
"shapeless" emotions: though
the inside jacket claims that
Prelude to Terror shines with
her "celebration of courage
and love," it should say that the
book glitters with bravado and
lust. As literature, Prelude to
Terror fails.
Soulless
Men have said that litera
ture, music and art are the first
and most sensitive spheres in
which spiritual revolution and
the resulting human introspec
tion are felt. The arts turn away

from the soulless life of the
tangible reality to those ideas
which give free reign to the
non-material strivings of the
soul. Therefore, Prelude to Ter
ror cannot be called literature:
it is about life at its most super
ficial level, in which the only
reality is the physical world and
the only values are the
materialistic, "soulless" val
ues.
However, Prelude to Terror is
not even good escapist fiction.
The inner jacket speaks of
Maclnnes' "ingenious plotting
and irresistible narrative": her
"ingenious plotting" consists
of introducing a new character
or moving the action to a new
location whenever the story
begins to slow down; and her
narrative is flat and plodding,
barely literate (she uses "eata
ble" rather than "edible"), and
totally lacking in style. All of
the characters, both Americans
and Europeans, speak alike.
The inner jacket's claim that
"in the genre of highly literate
suspense, she is unrivaled" is a
gross untruth: Prelude to Ter
ror is neither highly literate nor
suspenseful; and as to being
unrivaled, it is clear that there
is no comparison between
Maclnnes' work and the novels
of such authors as Alistair Mac-
Lean and Agatha Christie.
Maclnnes simply doesn't rate.
Material success
Despite Maclnnes' many
flaws as a writer of fiction, she
is quite successful in the mate
rial sense. Al! of her books
have been best-sellers, and not
just in America: they have
been translated into 22 lan
guages! Since we print these
books and embrace them with

material success, we set them
up as representatives of our art
and our culture. Thus, we must
realize what Prelude to Terror
will say about our age â€” and it
is not flattering. Prelude to Ter
ror reflects an extremely super
ficial view of life, an obsession
with the external characteris
tics of persons and ideas, and a
total neglect of the spii itual as
pects of life. And worse, any
vitality which Prelude to Terror
now has will die as soon as our
tastes evolve. This book cannot
be the mother of the future, for
when as artist creates for pre
stige and material gain instead
of to explore life's fundamental
questions, his or her work can
only create an artistic feeling
which is already clearly felt.
Thus, by allowing Prelude to
Terror material success now,
we necessarily send future
ages a work lacking in imagina
tion and vitality to be our rep
resentative.
-Catherine Austin
