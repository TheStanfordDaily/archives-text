Israel approves peace draft
The Israeli Cabinet gave unqualified approval
yesterday to a draft peace treaty with Egypt put
forward by the United States but rejected Cairo's
demands for a timetable on resolving the Palesti
nian question. Egypt recalled its chief negotiator
from the talks in Washington for consultations
after the Israeli decision.
Egyptian officials said before the cabinet's an
nouncement in Jerusalem that a treaty will not be
signed unless Israel changes its position on a
timetable.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin informed re
porters in Jerusalem of the Cabinet's decision and
said Israel "is prepared to sign the treaty of peace
. . . if Egypt is ready to act likewise."
The draft was worked out 10 days ago between
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan. Sources said the text is
almost identical to one the cabinet rejected Oct.
25.
The Egyptians are trying to pin Israel down to
timetables on movement on Palestinian autonomy
in the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Caza
Strip. Begin says the latest Egyptian proposals for a
timetable are inconsistent with the Camp David
accords worked out in September. He said Sunday
Israel "will never accept timetables."
"We are serious about linkages and timetables,"
said a government source in Cairo, "and it is our
bedrock position."
The source, who declined to be identified, pre
dicted the talks in Washington will continue, but
without a change in the Israeli position, he said,
chances are less that a treaty will be signed soon.

The Egyptians want Israel to agree to elections
and autonomy for the Palestinians that would
coincide with normalization of relations between
Cairo and Jerusalem. Otherwise, the sources said,
it would be "against nature" to leave the Palesti
nian problem unresolved.
There was no immediate word on when Dayan
and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman would return
to Washington.
Painkiller claimed unsafe
Washington — Ralph Nader's Health Research
Croup asked the government yesterday to ban the
painkiller Darvon and related compounds, charg
ing it "is the deadliest prescription drug in the
United States."
An analyst at the National Institute on Drug
Abuse said there are indications that prop
oxyphene, widely promoted under the trade name
Darvon, actually kills substantially more people
across the country than the illicit drug heroin.
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Nader group,
told Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano that the relatively mild painkiller
ought to be banned immediately as "an imminent
hazard to the public health."
Propoxyphene is manufactured by several
pharmaceutical companies but promoted under
the trade name Darvon by Eli Lilly and Co.
Earlier this year, based on studies conducted by
Lilly and Co., the Food and Drug Administration
ordered manufacturers to warn physicians pre
scribing the widely used painkiller that it should
not be taken with alcohol, tranquilizers or other
depressants. The combination may result in con-

vulsions or even death.
Propoxyphene is not very effective as a pain
reliever but in excessive doses is capable of pro
ducing "a euphoric high, which makes it attractive
as a drug of abuse," said Wolfe.
Fresno teachers picket in rain
Fresno —Teachers picketed in a steady rain yes
terday as negotiators tried to settle the first strike
in Fresno Unified School District's history.
There was no immediate indication whether the
latest bargaining had produced any progress to
ward a new contract. District and teacher associa
tion negotiators had not met since Sunday be
cause both sides were busy coping with the first
day of the strike Monday.
Schools remained open in the state's fifth
largest school district, with classrooms staffed by
teachers who didn't strike and substitutes for
those who did.
Spokesmen for both sides jokingly told a repor
ter they had ordered up the storm which forced
pickets to wear rain gear as they marched in front
of the district's 77 schools.
Posters reappear in Peking
Tokyo — A new crop of wall posters in Peking is
reopening old political sores and pointing to a
power struggle in China's leadership.
The posters indicate a challenge to the policies
and politics of Chinese Chairman Hua Kuo-feng
and a boost to twice-purged, but now restored,
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
They indirectly question the role the disgraced
"Gang of Four" may have had in Hua's rise to
power.
The posters, seen by correspondents of Japan's
Kyodo news service, said some "fascist" leaders
had gone unpunished and called for formal revo
cation of a 1976 decision dismissing Teng. This
would be a symbolic act, since Teng already is one
of the more powerful men in China.
Kyodo said one new poster yesterday suggested
indirectly that Teng be promoted to chairman.
The posters said more should be done to re
verse actions of the Gang of Four radical leaders,
who held considerable power before the death of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung in September of 1976.
Stocks slip in slow selling
New York — The stock market was slightly
changed in slow trading yesterday, showing little
reaction to government reports on corporate pro
fit levels or weakness in the dollar in foreign ex
change trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
closed off 1.56 points at 804.05 after bouncing up
and down in a narrow range throughout the day.
Big Board volume came to 20.75 million shares,
the slowest pace in more than a week. The volume
on Monday was 24.44 million.
Today's weather
Clearing today with chance of showers. Mostly
fair tonight and tomorrow with chance of local fog.
Colder tonight. Lows mid-40s to low 50s. Highs
uppersos to low 60s. Probability of precipitation 30

and a boost to twice-purged, but now restored,
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
They indirectly question the role the disgraced
"Gang of Four" may have had in Hua's rise to
power.
The posters, seen by correspondents of Japan's
Kyodo news service, said some "fascist" leaders
had gone unpunished and called for formal revo
cation of a 1976 decision dismissing Teng. This
would be a symbolic act, since Teng already is one
of the more powerful men in China.
Kyodo said one new poster yesterday suggested
indirectly that Teng be promoted to chairman.
The posters said more should be done to re
verse actions of the Gang of Four radical leaders,
who held considerable power before the death of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung in September of 1976.
Stocks slip in slow selling
New York — The stock market was slightly
changed in slow trading yesterday, showing little
reaction to government reports on corporate pro
fit levels or weakness in the dollar in foreign ex
change trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
closed off 1.56 points at 804.05 after bouncing up
and down in a narrow range throughout the day.
Big Board volume came to 20.75 million shares,
the slowest pace in more than a week. The volume
on Monday was 24.44 million.
Today's weather
Clearing today with chance of showers. Mostly
fair tonight and tomorrow with chance of local fog.
Colder tonight. Lows mid-40s to low 50s. Highs
uppersos to low 60s. Probability of precipitation 30
percent today.
Israel approves peace draft
The Israeli Cabinet gave unqualified approval
yesterday to a draft peace treaty with Egypt put
forward by the United States but rejected Cairo's
demands for a timetable on resolving the Palesti
nian question. Egypt recalled its chief negotiator
from the talks in Washington for consultations
after the Israeli decision.
Egyptian officials said before the cabinet's an
nouncement in Jerusalem that a treaty will not be
signed unless Israel changes its position on a
timetable.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin informed re
porters in Jerusalem of the Cabinet's decision and
said Israel "is prepared to sign the treaty of peace
. . . if Egypt is ready to act likewise."
The draft was worked out 10 days ago between
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan. Sources said the text is
almost identical to one the cabinet rejected Oct.
25.
The Egyptians are trying to pin Israel down to
timetables on movement on Palestinian autonomy
in the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Caza
Strip. Begin says the latest Egyptian proposals for a
timetable are inconsistent with the Camp David
accords worked out in September. He said Sunday
Israel "will never accept timetables."
"We are serious about linkages and timetables,"
said a government source in Cairo, "and it is our
bedrock position."
The source, who declined to be identified, pre
dicted the talks in Washington will continue, but
without a change in the Israeli position, he said,
chances are less that a treaty will be signed soon.

The Egyptians want Israel to agree to elections
and autonomy for the Palestinians that would
coincide with normalization of relations between
Cairo and Jerusalem. Otherwise, the sources said,
it would be "against nature" to leave the Palesti
nian problem unresolved.
There was no immediate word on when Dayan
and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman would return
to Washington.
Painkiller claimed unsafe
Washington — Ralph Nader's Health Research
Croup asked the government yesterday to ban the
painkiller Darvon and related compounds, charg
ing it "is the deadliest prescription drug in the
United States."
An analyst at the National Institute on Drug
Abuse said there are indications that prop
oxyphene, widely promoted under the trade name
Darvon, actually kills substantially more people
across the country than the illicit drug heroin.
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Nader group,
told Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano that the relatively mild painkiller
ought to be banned immediately as "an imminent
hazard to the public health."
Propoxyphene is manufactured by several
pharmaceutical companies but promoted under
the trade name Darvon by Eli Lilly and Co.
Earlier this year, based on studies conducted by
Lilly and Co., the Food and Drug Administration
ordered manufacturers to warn physicians pre
scribing the widely used painkiller that it should
not be taken with alcohol, tranquilizers or other
depressants. The combination may result in con-

vulsions or even death.
Propoxyphene is not very effective as a pain
reliever but in excessive doses is capable of pro
ducing "a euphoric high, which makes it attractive
as a drug of abuse," said Wolfe.
Fresno teachers picket in rain
Fresno —Teachers picketed in a steady rain yes
terday as negotiators tried to settle the first strike
in Fresno Unified School District's history.
There was no immediate indication whether the
latest bargaining had produced any progress to
ward a new contract. District and teacher associa
tion negotiators had not met since Sunday be
cause both sides were busy coping with the first
day of the strike Monday.
Schools remained open in the state's fifth
largest school district, with classrooms staffed by
teachers who didn't strike and substitutes for
those who did.
Spokesmen for both sides jokingly told a repor
ter they had ordered up the storm which forced
pickets to wear rain gear as they marched in front
of the district's 77 schools.

hazard to the public health."
Propoxyphene is manufactured by several
pharmaceutical companies but promoted under
the trade name Darvon by Eli Lilly and Co.
Earlier this year, based on studies conducted by
Lilly and Co., the Food and Drug Administration
ordered manufacturers to warn physicians pre
scribing the widely used painkiller that it should
not be taken with alcohol, tranquilizers or other
depressants. The combination may result in con-

vulsions or even death.
Propoxyphene is not very effective as a pain
reliever but in excessive doses is capable of pro
ducing "a euphoric high, which makes it attractive
as a drug of abuse," said Wolfe.
Fresno teachers picket in rain
Fresno —Teachers picketed in a steady rain yes
terday as negotiators tried to settle the first strike
in Fresno Unified School District's history.
There was no immediate indication whether the
latest bargaining had produced any progress to
ward a new contract. District and teacher associa
tion negotiators had not met since Sunday be
cause both sides were busy coping with the first
day of the strike Monday.
Schools remained open in the state's fifth
largest school district, with classrooms staffed by
teachers who didn't strike and substitutes for
those who did.
Spokesmen for both sides jokingly told a repor
ter they had ordered up the storm which forced
pickets to wear rain gear as they marched in front
of the district's 77 schools.
Posters reappear in Peking
Tokyo — A new crop of wall posters in Peking is
reopening old political sores and pointing to a
power struggle in China's leadership.
The posters indicate a challenge to the policies
and politics of Chinese Chairman Hua Kuo-feng
and a boost to twice-purged, but now restored,
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
They indirectly question the role the disgraced
"Gang of Four" may have had in Hua's rise to
power.
The posters, seen by correspondents of Japan's
Kyodo news service, said some "fascist" leaders
had gone unpunished and called for formal revo
cation of a 1976 decision dismissing Teng. This
would be a symbolic act, since Teng already is one
of the more powerful men in China.
Kyodo said one new poster yesterday suggested
indirectly that Teng be promoted to chairman.
The posters said more should be done to re
verse actions of the Gang of Four radical leaders,
who held considerable power before the death of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung in September of 1976.

Israel approves peace draft
The Israeli Cabinet gave unqualified approval
yesterday to a draft peace treaty with Egypt put
forward by the United States but rejected Cairo's
demands for a timetable on resolving the Palesti
nian question. Egypt recalled its chief negotiator
from the talks in Washington for consultations
after the Israeli decision.
Egyptian officials said before the cabinet's an
nouncement in Jerusalem that a treaty will not be
signed unless Israel changes its position on a
timetable.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin informed re
porters in Jerusalem of the Cabinet's decision and
said Israel "is prepared to sign the treaty of peace
. . . if Egypt is ready to act likewise."
The draft was worked out 10 days ago between
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan. Sources said the text is
almost identical to one the cabinet rejected Oct.
25.
The Egyptians are trying to pin Israel down to
timetables on movement on Palestinian autonomy
in the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Caza
Strip. Begin says the latest Egyptian proposals for a
timetable are inconsistent with the Camp David
accords worked out in September. He said Sunday
Israel "will never accept timetables."
"We are serious about linkages and timetables,"
said a government source in Cairo, "and it is our
bedrock position."
The source, who declined to be identified, pre
dicted the talks in Washington will continue, but
without a change in the Israeli position, he said,
chances are less that a treaty will be signed soon.

The Egyptians want Israel to agree to elections
and autonomy for the Palestinians that would
coincide with normalization of relations between
Cairo and Jerusalem. Otherwise, the sources said,
it would be "against nature" to leave the Palesti
nian problem unresolved.
There was no immediate word on when Dayan
and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman would return
to Washington.
Painkiller claimed unsafe
Washington — Ralph Nader's Health Research
Croup asked the government yesterday to ban the
painkiller Darvon and related compounds, charg
ing it "is the deadliest prescription drug in the
United States."
An analyst at the National Institute on Drug
Abuse said there are indications that prop
oxyphene, widely promoted under the trade name
Darvon, actually kills substantially more people
across the country than the illicit drug heroin.
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Nader group,
told Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano that the relatively mild painkiller
ought to be banned immediately as "an imminent
hazard to the public health."
Propoxyphene is manufactured by several
pharmaceutical companies but promoted under
