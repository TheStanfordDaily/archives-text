# Students pleased with campus, survey finds
## 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
A survey of 80 students conducted
here at the beginning of the quarter
reveals a high degree of satisfaction
with the University. It was so high
that Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons commented, "We're a little
suspicious of it.
"We worry a little that people
aren't self-critical enough about
Stanford," Lyons said.
About 30 staff members from sev
eral residences, Tresidder Union,
Cowell Student Health Center, the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services and the Office of Student
Activities interviewed the students.
Lyons said interviews were prefer
red over mail surveys because more
can be learned about the subject
through personal contact. He de
scribed the interview as a chance to
sit down and ask, "Well, how are
things going?"
Letters sent
Some 225 letters requesting inter
views were sent in hopes of yielding
150 participants, but only 80 followed
through with the interview.
"We didn't invite enough subjects
because we underestimated the
trouble in communicating that early
in the year, and we overestimated
the number of people who would re
spond," Lyons said. He explained
that temporary addresses and phone
numbers combined with directories
that had not been updated from last
year added to the communication
gap-
Those surveyed were not selected
fully at random, according to Lyons.
He said that his office tried to limit
the study to juniors in order to avoid
sophomores participating in a simi
lar, four-year study conducted by the

Undergraduate Studies Office. Some
subjects were graduate students.
The graduate students complained
of inadequate child care, the isola
tion from the rest of the University
they had experienced and marital
problems that stemmed from the
stresses of graduate student life, ac
cording to the survey.
The interviews indicated that
graduate and undergraduate women
seem to find it more difficult to de
velop long-lasting friendships with
other women than men here do with
other men. This was expressed
equally by those for and against
sororities.
Women surveyed also expressed
concern about physical safety on
campus.
Undergraduate complaints fo
cused on bad teaching assistants, ad
visors, residence maintenance and
occasionally poor faculty teaching,
according to the survey. About half
of those surveyed criticized their fel
low students as being self-centered,
competitive and insufficiently adven
turesome. However, most students
interviewed displayed a great deal of
satisfaction with the University.
'Passive' students
The survey found that there are
many "passive" students here.
"They just let Stanford happen to
them," one staff member said.
The Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs reached the conclusion that
generalizations about Stanford can
not be made. They found no "typi
cal" Stanford students and were un
able to isolate "the Stanford experi
ence."
Lyons said the group was not sur
prised by the results of the survey
because he said other surveys taken
here have revealed similar results.

occasionally poor faculty teaching,
according to the survey. About half
of those surveyed criticized their fel
low students as being self-centered,
competitive and insufficiently adven
turesome. However, most students
interviewed displayed a great deal of
satisfaction with the University.
'Passive' students
The survey found that there are
many "passive" students here.
"They just let Stanford happen to
them," one staff member said.
The Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs reached the conclusion that
generalizations about Stanford can
not be made. They found no "typi
cal" Stanford students and were un
able to isolate "the Stanford experi
ence."
Lyons said the group was not sur
prised by the results of the survey
because he said other surveys taken
here have revealed similar results.
A survey of 80 students conducted
here at the beginning of the quarter
reveals a high degree of satisfaction
with the University. It was so high
that Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons commented, "We're a little
suspicious of it.
"We worry a little that people
aren't self-critical enough about
Stanford," Lyons said.
About 30 staff members from sev
eral residences, Tresidder Union,
Cowell Student Health Center, the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services and the Office of Student
Activities interviewed the students.
Lyons said interviews were prefer
red over mail surveys because more
can be learned about the subject
through personal contact. He de
scribed the interview as a chance to
sit down and ask, "Well, how are
things going?"
Letters sent
Some 225 letters requesting inter
views were sent in hopes of yielding
150 participants, but only 80 followed
through with the interview.
"We didn't invite enough subjects
because we underestimated the
trouble in communicating that early
in the year, and we overestimated
the number of people who would re
spond," Lyons said. He explained
that temporary addresses and phone
numbers combined with directories
that had not been updated from last
year added to the communication
gap-
Those surveyed were not selected
fully at random, according to Lyons.
He said that his office tried to limit
the study to juniors in order to avoid
sophomores participating in a simi
lar, four-year study conducted by the

Undergraduate Studies Office. Some
subjects were graduate students.
The graduate students complained
of inadequate child care, the isola
tion from the rest of the University
they had experienced and marital
problems that stemmed from the
stresses of graduate student life, ac
cording to the survey.
The interviews indicated that
graduate and undergraduate women
seem to find it more difficult to de
velop long-lasting friendships with
other women than men here do with
other men. This was expressed
equally by those for and against
sororities.
Women surveyed also expressed
concern about physical safety on
campus.
Undergraduate complaints fo
cused on bad teaching assistants, ad
visors, residence maintenance and
occasionally poor faculty teaching,
according to the survey. About half
of those surveyed criticized their fel
low students as being self-centered,
competitive and insufficiently adven
turesome. However, most students
interviewed displayed a great deal of
satisfaction with the University.
