# Senators question Lyman on campus housing problems
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
President Richard Lyman spoke to
members of the ASSU Senate last
night in an informal meeting and
answered their questions on various
campus issues. Their major area of
interest seemed to be student hous
ing.
Sen. Brett Kingstone asked if any of
the $53 million the University re
ceived in gifts last year was going to
be channeled into building new
dorms.
Lyman answered that most gift
money is restricted, that is the donor
intends the money to go for a specific
purpose. Lyman said that, if nothing
else, the University is legally re
quired to respect the donor's wishes.
Restricted funds pay for such
things as scholarships, professor
ships and campus improvements.
Unrestricted funds pay for the "huge
areas of the University not glamor
ous enough to get gifts," according
to Lyman.

Lyman said that, based on the ex
perience of experts responsible tor
soliciting gifts for the University, it is
very difficult to raise restricted funds
for student housing.
If money for building dorms is
taken from the unrestricted funds,
then otherareas of the University will
suffer, he said.
The University housing system is
supposed to pay for itself, according
to Lyman. If a new dorm is built, a
possibility Lyman called likely, it
would be financed by borrowing the
money and repaying the loan over
the years by raising the rents on
campus. He said that studies show
the cost of living off campus is ex
pected to rise and that students will
actually be paying less to live on
campuswith the increased rents than
they would pay to live off campus.
Sen. JimEsserman asked why fund
ing for dorms must come solely from
rents. Lyman responded that while it
is difficult to explaih in detail the in
tricacies of the budget, he did not
want to see the University constantly
weighing the benefits of housing
versus setting professors' salaries.
He added that the costs of a new
dorm "will have to bulge out some
where," and if rents don't rise, tui
tion will.
Lyman began the meeting by tel
ling the senators that the senate was
"a good thing to have" from the ad
ministration's point of view. He said
he did not have much advice to offer
them in their attempts to shed the
image the body has sometimes had
in the past, an image he described as
"sandbox politics."
Lyman did, however, suggest that
the senate be more of an "investiga
tive body," spending more time re
searching issues and less time pas
sing resolutions.

Sen. Dave Steuer said that stu
dents are "fighting a losing battle in
the dorms" against rats, leaky roofs,
and a general state of disrepair. He
asked Lyman if any major repairs
were being planned.
Lyman said that the administration
was struggling with finding funds for
those repairs but that the funds were
hard to come by.
He added with a smile, "The ad
ministration is against rats."
Kingstone asked why tuition rises
faster than the national inflation rate
and inquired where the extra money
goes.
Lyman replied that a University is
necessarily more labor intensive
than most other types of businesses,
and thus is more sensitive to infla
tion. Lyman compared cutting cor
ners at a university, where salaries
play a major role, to trying to cut
costs in a symphony orchestra by
having the musicians play faster.
Sen. Thomas Arima asked Lyman
what he thought of the senate with
drawing ASSU funds from the Uni
versity's Merge Pool B in which they
are currently kept. Part of the pool is
invested in firms doing business in
South Africa, and a resolution prop
osed by Sen. Geoff Baskir would di
vest the funds from those firms.
Lyman said the senate is "free to
take any action it wants." If the se
nate is willing to make the symbolic
gesture of withdrawing the funds, he
said, they have the right, tfe added,
however, that the ASSU, as caretak
ers of the students' money, has a
legal duty to handle it responsibly. If
they don't, they could be sued for
mishandling of funds.
"It's a real-world decision and well
worth looking at in those terms,"
Lyman said.

Sen. Dave Steuer said that stu
dents are "fighting a losing battle in
the dorms" against rats, leaky roofs,
and a general state of disrepair. He
asked Lyman if any major repairs
were being planned.
Lyman said that the administration
was struggling with finding funds for
those repairs but that the funds were
hard to come by.
He added with a smile, "The ad
ministration is against rats."
Kingstone asked why tuition rises
faster than the national inflation rate
and inquired where the extra money
goes.
Lyman replied that a University is
necessarily more labor intensive
than most other types of businesses,
and thus is more sensitive to infla
tion. Lyman compared cutting cor
ners at a university, where salaries
play a major role, to trying to cut
costs in a symphony orchestra by
having the musicians play faster.
Sen. Thomas Arima asked Lyman
what he thought of the senate with
drawing ASSU funds from the Uni
versity's Merge Pool B in which they
are currently kept. Part of the pool is
invested in firms doing business in
South Africa, and a resolution prop
osed by Sen. Geoff Baskir would di
vest the funds from those firms.
Lyman said the senate is "free to
take any action it wants." If the se
nate is willing to make the symbolic
gesture of withdrawing the funds, he
said, they have the right, tfe added,
however, that the ASSU, as caretak
ers of the students' money, has a
legal duty to handle it responsibly. If
they don't, they could be sued for
mishandling of funds.
"It's a real-world decision and well
worth looking at in those terms,"
Lyman said.
President Richard Lyman spoke to
members of the ASSU Senate last
night in an informal meeting and
answered their questions on various
campus issues. Their major area of
interest seemed to be student hous
ing.
Sen. Brett Kingstone asked if any of
the $53 million the University re
ceived in gifts last year was going to
be channeled into building new
dorms.
Lyman answered that most gift
money is restricted, that is the donor
intends the money to go for a specific
purpose. Lyman said that, if nothing
else, the University is legally re
quired to respect the donor's wishes.
Restricted funds pay for such
things as scholarships, professor
ships and campus improvements.
Unrestricted funds pay for the "huge
areas of the University not glamor
ous enough to get gifts," according
to Lyman.

Lyman said that, based on the ex
perience of experts responsible tor
soliciting gifts for the University, it is
very difficult to raise restricted funds
for student housing.
If money for building dorms is
taken from the unrestricted funds,
then otherareas of the University will
suffer, he said.
The University housing system is
supposed to pay for itself, according
to Lyman. If a new dorm is built, a
possibility Lyman called likely, it
would be financed by borrowing the
money and repaying the loan over
the years by raising the rents on
campus. He said that studies show
the cost of living off campus is ex
pected to rise and that students will
actually be paying less to live on
campuswith the increased rents than
they would pay to live off campus.
Sen. JimEsserman asked why fund
ing for dorms must come solely from
rents. Lyman responded that while it
is difficult to explaih in detail the in
tricacies of the budget, he did not
want to see the University constantly
weighing the benefits of housing
versus setting professors' salaries.
He added that the costs of a new
dorm "will have to bulge out some
where," and if rents don't rise, tui
tion will.
Lyman began the meeting by tel
ling the senators that the senate was
"a good thing to have" from the ad
ministration's point of view. He said
he did not have much advice to offer
them in their attempts to shed the
image the body has sometimes had
in the past, an image he described as
"sandbox politics."
Lyman did, however, suggest that
the senate be more of an "investiga
tive body," spending more time re
searching issues and less time pas
sing resolutions.
