# Growing number of students are postponing their graduate studies
## 
### NONNIE GERBER 
Concerned about the cost of education and
no longer inclined to regard schooling as an
unbroken succession of degrees, many college
students throughout the country have been
opting to postpone theirgraduate studies forat
least a year.
This trend, which has been growing since the
late 19605, is being welcomed by many
educators who think that students will get more
out of their graduate work if they take time to
mature after completing their bachelor de
grees.
Gaining practical on-the-job experience be
fore entering graduate school is especially
being recommended by the Business School
here.
Lawrie Lieberman, director of admissions for
the Business School, said full-time work ex
perience before studying for an MBA is benefi
cial for several reasons.
"It enables students to relate what they learn
in class to what they have already experienced
on the job. People with experience also
heighten the reciprocal learning environ
ment," he said.

In addition, Lieberman said a business school
graduate who has also worked full-time will
have an advantage when seeking employment.
According to a report from the Business
School, the trend toward deferring graduate
work is illustrated by the fact that the average
age of the entering MBA class is 26, and 77
percent of the class has spent a year or more
working before enrolling. Ten years ago, only
38 percent of the new students had worked for
a year or more after graduating from college.
Best interest
Lieberman said he thinks full-time experi
ence before enrolling is in most people's best
interest. But it is not for everyone, said William
Cohen, faculty chairman of the admissions
committee for the Law School. According to
Cohen, 60 percent of the new law students en
tered directly from college, and only 40 percent
took time off.
Cohen explained that the Law School has not
set a policy on admitting students who have
deferred admission.
"Taking time off can be a positive or negative
factor in considering someone for the Law
School. It helps if the student has done work in

something useful like working in Congress
drafting legislation," he said.
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of graduate studies
for programs outside of the professional
schools, said, "In certain cases it makes excel
lent sense to take time off. In fact, I did it my
self." The positive aspects of taking time off are
that a student can gain a new perspective on his
life and his studies, and that it is good to have a
break in formal education for a while, Car
nochan said.
Yet, it can be overdone, Carnochan pointed
out. "The farther away you get, the less relevant
letters of recommendation and scores may
seem, thus, the harder it may be to apply and
get into graduate school."
What makes students decide to take time off
before graduate school? "They're sick and tired
of continuing in lockstep fashion through
school," said Bill Washburn, assistant to the
dean of undergraduate studies here.
Furthermore, some students say that by get
ting jobs and having a chance to reflect on their
earlier education they expect to be able to
make better-informed decisions about what to
study on the master's and doctoral levels.
Tom Thurston, 25, is a first-year Engineering
graduate student who graduated from the Uni
versity of Tennessee in 1975 and has spent the
last two years working for IBM. Looking back,
Thurston is glad about his decision.
"It provided me with a lot more insight into
what exactly is important and what isn't. I came
back much more motivated to learn. People
who are not working tend to have more of a
feeling of 'Let's just get the degree and get this
over with' and, therefore, they dispense with
learning," he commented.
However, there are some drawbacks to being
out of the mainstream of the educational pro
cess for three years.
"You remember the concept of what you
learned before but forget the details," said
Thurston.
Bruce Burrell, a graduate student in Opera
tions Research who graduated from Oberlin
College in 1977 and took one year off to be a
bartending magician, agreed.
"I wouldn't condemn anyone for taking time
off — the merits are great — but I wouldn't
recommend it point-blank to everyone. For me
it was great. It was a relaxing time and benefit
ted me financially. It also made me realize how

much I wanted to get back to grad school."
Another master's student, Eric Lamb, who
took time off to go to Morocco with the Peace
Corps, said he thinks all students should con
sider taking time off to do something in their
field.
"The experience helped me very much be
cause it gave direction to what I liked. Now
when I look fora real job I wouldn't mind going
overseas; before, I never would have consi
dered it."
One law student who took a year off to study
orangutans in Indonesia advises other students
that if there's something they've always wanted
to do, the interim before grad school is a great
time to do it.
"It was something I'd always dreamed of do
ing. Working with orangutans in Indonesia was
a great experience but also really tough. It
tested me and made me stronger. It didn't be
nefit me so much academically as personally."
Of course, there are also pragmatic reasons
why some students decide not to take time off.
As Bob Waldman, Haverford '78 and first-year
law student said, "If you have something neat
to do you should definitely do it; if not, well,
the longer you stay in school the longer you
have to pay loans back."

sider taking time off to do something in their
field.
"The experience helped me very much be
cause it gave direction to what I liked. Now
when I look fora real job I wouldn't mind going
overseas; before, I never would have consi
dered it."
One law student who took a year off to study
orangutans in Indonesia advises other students
that if there's something they've always wanted
to do, the interim before grad school is a great
time to do it.
"It was something I'd always dreamed of do
ing. Working with orangutans in Indonesia was
a great experience but also really tough. It
tested me and made me stronger. It didn't be
nefit me so much academically as personally."
Of course, there are also pragmatic reasons
why some students decide not to take time off.
As Bob Waldman, Haverford '78 and first-year
law student said, "If you have something neat
to do you should definitely do it; if not, well,
the longer you stay in school the longer you
have to pay loans back."
Concerned about the cost of education and
no longer inclined to regard schooling as an
unbroken succession of degrees, many college
students throughout the country have been
opting to postpone theirgraduate studies forat
least a year.
This trend, which has been growing since the
late 19605, is being welcomed by many
educators who think that students will get more
out of their graduate work if they take time to
mature after completing their bachelor de
grees.
Gaining practical on-the-job experience be
fore entering graduate school is especially
being recommended by the Business School
here.
Lawrie Lieberman, director of admissions for
the Business School, said full-time work ex
perience before studying for an MBA is benefi
cial for several reasons.
"It enables students to relate what they learn
in class to what they have already experienced
on the job. People with experience also
heighten the reciprocal learning environ
ment," he said.

In addition, Lieberman said a business school
graduate who has also worked full-time will
have an advantage when seeking employment.
According to a report from the Business
School, the trend toward deferring graduate
work is illustrated by the fact that the average
age of the entering MBA class is 26, and 77
percent of the class has spent a year or more
working before enrolling. Ten years ago, only
38 percent of the new students had worked for
a year or more after graduating from college.
Best interest
Lieberman said he thinks full-time experi
ence before enrolling is in most people's best
interest. But it is not for everyone, said William
Cohen, faculty chairman of the admissions
committee for the Law School. According to
Cohen, 60 percent of the new law students en
tered directly from college, and only 40 percent
took time off.
Cohen explained that the Law School has not
set a policy on admitting students who have
deferred admission.
"Taking time off can be a positive or negative
factor in considering someone for the Law
School. It helps if the student has done work in

something useful like working in Congress
drafting legislation," he said.
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of graduate studies
for programs outside of the professional
schools, said, "In certain cases it makes excel
lent sense to take time off. In fact, I did it my
self." The positive aspects of taking time off are
that a student can gain a new perspective on his
life and his studies, and that it is good to have a
break in formal education for a while, Car
nochan said.
Yet, it can be overdone, Carnochan pointed
out. "The farther away you get, the less relevant
letters of recommendation and scores may
seem, thus, the harder it may be to apply and
get into graduate school."
What makes students decide to take time off
before graduate school? "They're sick and tired
of continuing in lockstep fashion through
school," said Bill Washburn, assistant to the
dean of undergraduate studies here.
Furthermore, some students say that by get
ting jobs and having a chance to reflect on their
earlier education they expect to be able to
make better-informed decisions about what to
study on the master's and doctoral levels.
Tom Thurston, 25, is a first-year Engineering
graduate student who graduated from the Uni
versity of Tennessee in 1975 and has spent the
last two years working for IBM. Looking back,
Thurston is glad about his decision.
"It provided me with a lot more insight into
what exactly is important and what isn't. I came
back much more motivated to learn. People
who are not working tend to have more of a
feeling of 'Let's just get the degree and get this
over with' and, therefore, they dispense with
learning," he commented.
However, there are some drawbacks to being
out of the mainstream of the educational pro
cess for three years.
"You remember the concept of what you
learned before but forget the details," said
Thurston.
Bruce Burrell, a graduate student in Opera
tions Research who graduated from Oberlin
College in 1977 and took one year off to be a
bartending magician, agreed.
"I wouldn't condemn anyone for taking time
off — the merits are great — but I wouldn't
recommend it point-blank to everyone. For me
it was great. It was a relaxing time and benefit
ted me financially. It also made me realize how

much I wanted to get back to grad school."
Another master's student, Eric Lamb, who
took time off to go to Morocco with the Peace

what exactly is important and what isn't. I came
back much more motivated to learn. People
who are not working tend to have more of a
feeling of 'Let's just get the degree and get this
over with' and, therefore, they dispense with
learning," he commented.
However, there are some drawbacks to being
out of the mainstream of the educational pro
cess for three years.
"You remember the concept of what you
learned before but forget the details," said
Thurston.
Bruce Burrell, a graduate student in Opera
tions Research who graduated from Oberlin
College in 1977 and took one year off to be a
bartending magician, agreed.
"I wouldn't condemn anyone for taking time
off — the merits are great — but I wouldn't
recommend it point-blank to everyone. For me
it was great. It was a relaxing time and benefit
ted me financially. It also made me realize how

much I wanted to get back to grad school."
Another master's student, Eric Lamb, who
took time off to go to Morocco with the Peace
Corps, said he thinks all students should con
sider taking time off to do something in their
field.
"The experience helped me very much be
cause it gave direction to what I liked. Now
when I look fora real job I wouldn't mind going
overseas; before, I never would have consi
dered it."
One law student who took a year off to study
orangutans in Indonesia advises other students
that if there's something they've always wanted
to do, the interim before grad school is a great
time to do it.
"It was something I'd always dreamed of do
ing. Working with orangutans in Indonesia was
a great experience but also really tough. It
tested me and made me stronger. It didn't be
nefit me so much academically as personally."
Of course, there are also pragmatic reasons
why some students decide not to take time off.
As Bob Waldman, Haverford '78 and first-year
law student said, "If you have something neat
to do you should definitely do it; if not, well,
the longer you stay in school the longer you
have to pay loans back."
Concerned about the cost of education and
no longer inclined to regard schooling as an
unbroken succession of degrees, many college
students throughout the country have been
opting to postpone theirgraduate studies forat
least a year.
This trend, which has been growing since the
late 19605, is being welcomed by many
educators who think that students will get more
out of their graduate work if they take time to
mature after completing their bachelor de
grees.
Gaining practical on-the-job experience be
fore entering graduate school is especially
being recommended by the Business School
here.
Lawrie Lieberman, director of admissions for
the Business School, said full-time work ex
perience before studying for an MBA is benefi
cial for several reasons.
"It enables students to relate what they learn
in class to what they have already experienced
on the job. People with experience also
heighten the reciprocal learning environ
ment," he said.

In addition, Lieberman said a business school
graduate who has also worked full-time will
have an advantage when seeking employment.
According to a report from the Business
School, the trend toward deferring graduate
work is illustrated by the fact that the average
age of the entering MBA class is 26, and 77
percent of the class has spent a year or more
working before enrolling. Ten years ago, only
38 percent of the new students had worked for
a year or more after graduating from college.
Best interest
Lieberman said he thinks full-time experi
ence before enrolling is in most people's best
interest. But it is not for everyone, said William
Cohen, faculty chairman of the admissions
committee for the Law School. According to
Cohen, 60 percent of the new law students en
tered directly from college, and only 40 percent
took time off.
Cohen explained that the Law School has not
set a policy on admitting students who have
deferred admission.
"Taking time off can be a positive or negative
factor in considering someone for the Law
School. It helps if the student has done work in

something useful like working in Congress
drafting legislation," he said.
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of graduate studies
for programs outside of the professional
schools, said, "In certain cases it makes excel
lent sense to take time off. In fact, I did it my
self." The positive aspects of taking time off are
that a student can gain a new perspective on his
life and his studies, and that it is good to have a
break in formal education for a while, Car
nochan said.
Yet, it can be overdone, Carnochan pointed
out. "The farther away you get, the less relevant
letters of recommendation and scores may
seem, thus, the harder it may be to apply and
get into graduate school."
What makes students decide to take time off
before graduate school? "They're sick and tired
of continuing in lockstep fashion through
school," said Bill Washburn, assistant to the
dean of undergraduate studies here.
Furthermore, some students say that by get
ting jobs and having a chance to reflect on their
earlier education they expect to be able to
make better-informed decisions about what to
study on the master's and doctoral levels.
Tom Thurston, 25, is a first-year Engineering
graduate student who graduated from the Uni
versity of Tennessee in 1975 and has spent the
last two years working for IBM. Looking back,
Thurston is glad about his decision.
"It provided me with a lot more insight into
what exactly is important and what isn't. I came
back much more motivated to learn. People
