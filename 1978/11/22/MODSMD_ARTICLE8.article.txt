Participation before precipitation
It's hard to believe that only five days ago students were flying frisbees and emptying kegs of beer
under sunny skies at the Inter-Fraternity Council Meganooner, one of the pre-Big Game activities
held last week. Located in front of the Delta Upsilon and Beta Theta Pi fraternity houses, the
Meganooner featured a band and 40 kegs of beer.
