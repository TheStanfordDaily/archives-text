# Conservation efforts improve here

### DEAN EYRE 
Located in the basement of Crothers
Memorial, a seemingly unappropriate
niche for such an active organization, is
the Energy Conservation Center. Or
ganized in 1977 and headed by Karl
Johnson, a graduate in product design,
the center has made significant steps
towards reducing energy waste and
consumption on campus.
Last year was a particularly rewarding
milestone for the young office. A wide
range of activities were sponsored in an
attempt to increase the public's aware
ness of energy savings.
"People made the difference in living
situations," Johnson said. "The dorms
were 21 percent below base level (the
amount of energy consumed before
conservation measures); the row
houses were down 14 percent, a sav
ings of 91,000 kilowatt-hours, and the
cluster houses were down 7 percent.
Overall, one million kilowatt-hours
were saved during the 1977-78
academic year. This is the equivalent of
one million pounds of coal or 325,000
years of lighting for an average house."
During the winter quarter, the center
teamed with a SWOPSI class entitled

"Energy Conservation as an Energy Re
source" to "study, retrofit, and insu
late" Phi Psi and Hammarjskold houses.
Using these small scale experiences as a
testing ground, the center then insu
lated 12 additional row houses in the
spring and completed projects to insu
late several dorms, as well.
The total project insulated over
130,000 square feet of attic space,
Johnson said. "Each student carried 3'/a
tons of insulation to the attics and saved
$15,000 over contract labor. The esti
mated savings of $6500 per year makes
for a payback period of 3Vi years, not
even considering fuel price increases."
"Some of the dorms are inaccessible
for insulating, like Stern with its flat
roof. Also, Flo Mo and Wilbur pose
problems," Johnson added. Heat is
prevented from escaping through the
attics of buildings because the insula
tion creates dead air spaces beneath
the attic floors which trap the rising
heated air. Most of the buildings insu
lated on campus were treated with a
blown-in cellulose material chemically
processed with fire retardant. Since the
cellulose is recycled from newspapers,
it is preferred over other less environ
mentally sound insulating materials,

such as fiberglass.
The major focus for the center and
two successive SWOPSI courses during
winterand spring quarters was the solar
heating system installed at Roth House.
"In six months, we designed and built a
solar water heater with 52 percent effi
ciency — which is real high," Johnson
said. "A visiting Department of Energy
representative called it a 'beautiful sys
tem,' to be included in a series of suc
cess stories of solar energy."
The Roth system provides 225 gallons
of water storage in the basement. The
water is heated by the sun; rays strike
metal collector panels and the water
reaches temperatures as high as 160
degrees. The system is providing ap
proximately 30 percent of the hot water
demand in the house.
In addition to the accomplishment of
constructing the actual water heating
apparatus, the cooperative experience
was valuable. The project required the
students to "think, design and build,"
rewarding them with the "satisfaction
of building," Johnson explained. "They
created a high group energy with in
creased communication — the success
showed that."

The Roth system provides 225 gallons
of water storage in the basement. The
water is heated by the sun; rays strike
metal collector panels and the water
reaches temperatures as high as 160
degrees. The system is providing ap
proximately 30 percent of the hot water
demand in the house.
In addition to the accomplishment of
constructing the actual water heating
apparatus, the cooperative experience
was valuable. The project required the
students to "think, design and build,"
rewarding them with the "satisfaction
of building," Johnson explained. "They
created a high group energy with in
creased communication — the success
showed that."

Located in the basement of Crothers
Memorial, a seemingly unappropriate
niche for such an active organization, is
the Energy Conservation Center. Or
ganized in 1977 and headed by Karl
Johnson, a graduate in product design,
the center has made significant steps
towards reducing energy waste and
consumption on campus.
Last year was a particularly rewarding
milestone for the young office. A wide
range of activities were sponsored in an
attempt to increase the public's aware
ness of energy savings.
"People made the difference in living
situations," Johnson said. "The dorms
were 21 percent below base level (the
amount of energy consumed before
conservation measures); the row
houses were down 14 percent, a sav
ings of 91,000 kilowatt-hours, and the
cluster houses were down 7 percent.
Overall, one million kilowatt-hours
were saved during the 1977-78
academic year. This is the equivalent of
one million pounds of coal or 325,000
years of lighting for an average house."
During the winter quarter, the center
teamed with a SWOPSI class entitled

"Energy Conservation as an Energy Re
source" to "study, retrofit, and insu
late" Phi Psi and Hammarjskold houses.
Using these small scale experiences as a
testing ground, the center then insu
lated 12 additional row houses in the
spring and completed projects to insu
late several dorms, as well.
The total project insulated over
130,000 square feet of attic space,
Johnson said. "Each student carried 3'/a
tons of insulation to the attics and saved
$15,000 over contract labor. The esti
mated savings of $6500 per year makes
for a payback period of 3Vi years, not
even considering fuel price increases."
"Some of the dorms are inaccessible
for insulating, like Stern with its flat
roof. Also, Flo Mo and Wilbur pose
problems," Johnson added. Heat is
prevented from escaping through the
attics of buildings because the insula
tion creates dead air spaces beneath
the attic floors which trap the rising
heated air. Most of the buildings insu
lated on campus were treated with a
blown-in cellulose material chemically
processed with fire retardant. Since the
cellulose is recycled from newspapers,
it is preferred over other less environ
mentally sound insulating materials,

such as fiberglass.
The major focus for the center and
two successive SWOPSI courses during
winterand spring quarters was the solar
heating system installed at Roth House.
"In six months, we designed and built a
solar water heater with 52 percent effi
ciency — which is real high," Johnson
said. "A visiting Department of Energy
representative called it a 'beautiful sys
tem,' to be included in a series of suc
cess stories of solar energy."
