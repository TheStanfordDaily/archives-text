"This Place Has It All!"
In its issue of Oct. 6th the "Bay Guardian" evaluated 43
bookstores around UC Berkeley and Stanford. This is
what it said about Kepler's Books & Magazines in Menlo
Park:
"By far the best bookstore anywhere near Stanford, this
place has it all — reference books, hardbacks,
paperbacks, magazines — under the visages of Marlon
Brando, Paul Newman and Farrah Fawcett Majors.
Reading tables are available to help you pore over books
on the bar exam, women's rights, the Mickey Mouse
Club, Mc Donald's Hamburgers, you name it. Also
magazines & newspapers, both domestic & foreign."
We couldn't say it better ourselves.
