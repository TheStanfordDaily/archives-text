# Poloists edge Cal in overtime for NCAA title
## 
### BRAD BROCKBANK 
These are the times that try
men's souls . . .
Long Beach — If it hadn't
happened before a capacity
crowd of more than 2000
screaming spectators, one
would have thought the script
had been written by a Hol
lywood screenwriter with a
flair for the dramatic.
But it was real.
With 26 seconds left in
sudden-death overtime senior
Doug Burke pushed a shot past
California goalie David Young
to give the Stanford water polo
team a 7-6 victory in the finals
of the NCAA Championships at
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach last night.
Stanford's bread and butter,
the counter-attack, had been
mostly ineffective against the
Bears. But after a series of ex
changes in the sudden death
period, in which each team
missed three opportunities to
score, junior Randy Kalbus
took an outlet pass on the left
wing, tossed the ball to a driv
ing Alan Mouchawar, who in
turn passed it to Burke on the
right side.
A split second later, Stanford
became the national champ
ions.

"I just wanted that game
over with," a jubilant Burke
said afterward.
"Doug was open," com
mented a champagne-soaked
Mouchawar, "and I didn't want
to miss that last shot."
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said his first feeling
after Burke's score was one of
great relief.
"It's the greatest feeling in
the world (to win the NCAAs),"
he said.
The first quarter of the game,
however, belonged entirely to
Cal as the Bears seemed to do
everything right and the Cards
seemed helpless to stop the
onslaught. Cal's Kevin
Robertson scored three goals
in the quarter to give the Bears
a 3-0 lead at the end of the
period.
For Stanford it was a quarter
marked by missed shots and
numerous ejections. Both
senior Tom Angelo and
freshman Jody Campbell were
called for two personal faults in
the first quarter. Angelo even
tually fouled out with his third
in the fourth quarter.
"We were very nervous,"
said Dettamanti. "We made
some mistakes and they
capitalized on them."

Down by three goals going
into the second quarter the
sluggish Stanford offense
slowly came to life, methodi
cally chipping away at the Cal
lead until it was 3-2 at halftime.
After the break, Mouchawar
paced the team on a crusade:
"Beat the Bears."
The freshman, playing in his
home town, scored the next
three goals of the game — one
in the third quarter and two
early in the fourth — and sud
denly Stanford found itself
holding a 5-3 advantage.
Cal, however, did not make
it to the finals on luck. The
Bears battled back in the last
two minutes of regulation play
to tie the score at five.
In the following two over
time periods, Cal's Carlos Stef
fens scored a goal in the first
but Kalbus tied it up again in
the second with a tap-in off a
rebounded 6-on-5 shot.
And then there was the
sudden-death period, or as
goalie John Gansel put it:"I
was just praying to Cod that it
didn't go in at my end."
In the opening round Satur
day morning, the Cards shot
down the Air Force Academy
before the Falcons even got off

the ground.
The first quarter could be
most accurately described as
the "Kelsey and Angelo Show"
as each scored two goals and
Kelsey made two of his game
high four steals.
Because of an injury to the
hand of freshman hole man
Jody Campbell last Wednes
day, senior Dave Egan stepped
in to start the game.
Very quickly in the first quar
ter, however, Egan was twice
ejected and Dettamanti went
to his bench and came up with
sophomore Bill Taylor. Taylor
responded by scoring four
goals — two in the second
quarter — to pace the Cardinal
attack. Angelo finished with
three.
By half time, Stanford held
an 11-0 lead as the Cards'
counter-attack "completely
blew them out," according to
Dettamanti.
Goalie Vince Vannelli and
the Cardinal defense held Air
Force scoreless until 1:49 in the
third quarter when Mike Mul
lady skipped one past Vannel
li's outstretched arms.
Pepperdine has been a thorn
in Stanford's side for the last

couple of years and the semifi
nal match between the two
teams Saturday night was no
different.
With Campbell back in the
starting lineup and )ohn Gan
sel in the goal the Cards were at
full strength. The Waves, how
ever, came out quickly and
scored before 30 seconds had
ticked off the clock.
When Arnold fouled a Pep
perdine player inside the
four-meter line and the Waves
were awarded a penalty shot,
things began to look even
worse for the Cards. But Gan
sel, as he did in last year's
NCAA's, lunged out to block
the penalty shot and the tide
turned against the Waves.
In the ensuing two minutes,
Stanford scored four times —
twice from the arm of Burke —
and when the period ended
the Cards clung to a tenuous
5-3 lead.
During the second quarter,
the Stanford lead went from
tenuous to nearly nonexistent.
The Waves outscored the
Cards — or more precisely,
Alan Mouchawar — 3-2 in the
quarter and Stanford got out of
the pool at half time leading
7-6.
Part of the reason for the

close score at half time lay in
the Cards' inability to convert
on man-up situations — usu
ally a strong point in Stanford's
game.
In the first half, the Cards
blew three 6-on-5 oppor
tunities and finished the game
having converted on only one
of five chances.
Pepperdine, meanwhile,
kept close by virtue of three
first-half goals by hole man
Terry Schroeder, who also sets
holeforthe U.S. national team.
"You've gotta stop
Schroeder," said Dettamanti.
"If you don't execute perfectly
(on defense) they'll score. You
almost have to play perfect de
fense."
The Cardinal coach said
execution was the main prob
lem in the first half for Stan
ford, but he added that the
Cards' strategy for stopping
Schroeder was working.
According to Dettamanti,
the Cards tried to tire
Schroeder out by moving him
as far down the pool as possi
ble on defense, thereby forc
ing him to swim the entire
length of the pool when the
ball turned over.
It seemed to work. When the

teams began the second half,
Schroeder was visibly fatigued.
Stanford, sensing a let-up in the
Wave attack, tightened down
the defensive execution and
held Schroeder to only one
goal in the second half.
Pepperdine managed only
two goals in the third period
against the Card's four, and the
final quarter was all Stanford as
three Cardinal goals found
their way into the Pepperdine
net, including top-scorer
Burke's fourth of the game.
Meanwhile, California had
little trouble getting by UC-
Irvine in their semifinal match
and the stage was set for the
fifth Stanford-Cal contest of
the year and the third in the last
three weeks.
Stanford placed six players
on All-Tournament teams.
Cansel, Arnold and Burke were
chosen to the first team and
Mouchawar, Angelo and
Campbell were voted to the
second team.
Kelsey, who played every
minute of the final game,
summed up Stanford's desire
to win:
"This is the culmination of
four months work. You'll kill
yourself before you quit."

Part of the reason for the

close score at half time lay in
the Cards' inability to convert
on man-up situations — usu
ally a strong point in Stanford's
game.
In the first half, the Cards
blew three 6-on-5 oppor
tunities and finished the game
having converted on only one
of five chances.
Pepperdine, meanwhile,
kept close by virtue of three
first-half goals by hole man
Terry Schroeder, who also sets
holeforthe U.S. national team.
"You've gotta stop
Schroeder," said Dettamanti.
"If you don't execute perfectly
(on defense) they'll score. You
almost have to play perfect de
fense."
The Cardinal coach said
execution was the main prob
lem in the first half for Stan
ford, but he added that the
Cards' strategy for stopping
Schroeder was working.
According to Dettamanti,
the Cards tried to tire
Schroeder out by moving him
as far down the pool as possi
ble on defense, thereby forc
ing him to swim the entire
length of the pool when the
ball turned over.
It seemed to work. When the

teams began the second half,
Schroeder was visibly fatigued.
Stanford, sensing a let-up in the
Wave attack, tightened down
the defensive execution and
held Schroeder to only one
goal in the second half.
Pepperdine managed only
two goals in the third period
against the Card's four, and the
final quarter was all Stanford as
three Cardinal goals found
their way into the Pepperdine
net, including top-scorer
Burke's fourth of the game.
Meanwhile, California had
little trouble getting by UC-
Irvine in their semifinal match
and the stage was set for the
fifth Stanford-Cal contest of
the year and the third in the last
three weeks.
Stanford placed six players
on All-Tournament teams.
Cansel, Arnold and Burke were
chosen to the first team and
Mouchawar, Angelo and
Campbell were voted to the
second team.
Kelsey, who played every
minute of the final game,
summed up Stanford's desire
to win:
"This is the culmination of
four months work. You'll kill
yourself before you quit."

Air Force in the first round of the NCAA water polo finals Saturday in Long Beach. After drowning the
Falcons, the Cards knocked off Pepperdine, 14-8, and Cal, 7-6, to win the national title.
These are the times that try
men's souls . . .
Long Beach — If it hadn't
happened before a capacity
crowd of more than 2000
screaming spectators, one
would have thought the script
had been written by a Hol
lywood screenwriter with a
flair for the dramatic.
But it was real.
With 26 seconds left in
sudden-death overtime senior
Doug Burke pushed a shot past
California goalie David Young
to give the Stanford water polo
team a 7-6 victory in the finals
of the NCAA Championships at
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach last night.
Stanford's bread and butter,
the counter-attack, had been
mostly ineffective against the
Bears. But after a series of ex
changes in the sudden death
period, in which each team
missed three opportunities to
score, junior Randy Kalbus
took an outlet pass on the left
wing, tossed the ball to a driv
ing Alan Mouchawar, who in
turn passed it to Burke on the
right side.
A split second later, Stanford
became the national champ
ions.

"I just wanted that game
over with," a jubilant Burke
said afterward.
"Doug was open," com
mented a champagne-soaked
Mouchawar, "and I didn't want
to miss that last shot."
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said his first feeling
after Burke's score was one of
great relief.
"It's the greatest feeling in
the world (to win the NCAAs),"
he said.
The first quarter of the game,
however, belonged entirely to
Cal as the Bears seemed to do
everything right and the Cards
seemed helpless to stop the
onslaught. Cal's Kevin
Robertson scored three goals
in the quarter to give the Bears
a 3-0 lead at the end of the
period.
For Stanford it was a quarter
marked by missed shots and
numerous ejections. Both
senior Tom Angelo and
freshman Jody Campbell were
called for two personal faults in
the first quarter. Angelo even
tually fouled out with his third
in the fourth quarter.
"We were very nervous,"
said Dettamanti. "We made
some mistakes and they
capitalized on them."

Down by three goals going
into the second quarter the
sluggish Stanford offense
slowly came to life, methodi
cally chipping away at the Cal
lead until it was 3-2 at halftime.
After the break, Mouchawar
paced the team on a crusade:
"Beat the Bears."
The freshman, playing in his
home town, scored the next
three goals of the game — one
in the third quarter and two
early in the fourth — and sud
denly Stanford found itself
holding a 5-3 advantage.
Cal, however, did not make
it to the finals on luck. The
Bears battled back in the last
two minutes of regulation play
to tie the score at five.
In the following two over
time periods, Cal's Carlos Stef
fens scored a goal in the first
but Kalbus tied it up again in
the second with a tap-in off a
rebounded 6-on-5 shot.
And then there was the
sudden-death period, or as
goalie John Gansel put it:"I
was just praying to Cod that it
didn't go in at my end."
In the opening round Satur
day morning, the Cards shot
down the Air Force Academy
before the Falcons even got off

the ground.
The first quarter could be
most accurately described as
the "Kelsey and Angelo Show"
as each scored two goals and
Kelsey made two of his game
high four steals.
Because of an injury to the
hand of freshman hole man
Jody Campbell last Wednes
day, senior Dave Egan stepped
in to start the game.
Very quickly in the first quar
ter, however, Egan was twice
ejected and Dettamanti went
to his bench and came up with
sophomore Bill Taylor. Taylor
responded by scoring four
goals — two in the second
quarter — to pace the Cardinal
attack. Angelo finished with
three.
By half time, Stanford held
an 11-0 lead as the Cards'
counter-attack "completely
blew them out," according to
Dettamanti.
Goalie Vince Vannelli and
the Cardinal defense held Air
Force scoreless until 1:49 in the
third quarter when Mike Mul
lady skipped one past Vannel
li's outstretched arms.
Pepperdine has been a thorn
in Stanford's side for the last

couple of years and the semifi
nal match between the two
teams Saturday night was no
different.
With Campbell back in the
starting lineup and )ohn Gan
sel in the goal the Cards were at
full strength. The Waves, how
ever, came out quickly and
scored before 30 seconds had
ticked off the clock.
When Arnold fouled a Pep
perdine player inside the
four-meter line and the Waves
were awarded a penalty shot,
things began to look even
worse for the Cards. But Gan
sel, as he did in last year's
NCAA's, lunged out to block
the penalty shot and the tide
turned against the Waves.
In the ensuing two minutes,
Stanford scored four times —
twice from the arm of Burke —
and when the period ended
the Cards clung to a tenuous
5-3 lead.
During the second quarter,
the Stanford lead went from
tenuous to nearly nonexistent.
The Waves outscored the
Cards — or more precisely,
Alan Mouchawar — 3-2 in the
quarter and Stanford got out of
the pool at half time leading
7-6.
Part of the reason for the

close score at half time lay in
the Cards' inability to convert

the ground.
The first quarter could be
most accurately described as
the "Kelsey and Angelo Show"
as each scored two goals and
Kelsey made two of his game
high four steals.
Because of an injury to the
hand of freshman hole man
Jody Campbell last Wednes
day, senior Dave Egan stepped
in to start the game.
Very quickly in the first quar
ter, however, Egan was twice
ejected and Dettamanti went
to his bench and came up with
sophomore Bill Taylor. Taylor
responded by scoring four
goals — two in the second
quarter — to pace the Cardinal
attack. Angelo finished with
three.
By half time, Stanford held
an 11-0 lead as the Cards'
counter-attack "completely
blew them out," according to
Dettamanti.
Goalie Vince Vannelli and
the Cardinal defense held Air
Force scoreless until 1:49 in the
third quarter when Mike Mul
lady skipped one past Vannel
li's outstretched arms.
Pepperdine has been a thorn
in Stanford's side for the last

couple of years and the semifi
nal match between the two
teams Saturday night was no
different.
With Campbell back in the
starting lineup and )ohn Gan
sel in the goal the Cards were at
full strength. The Waves, how
ever, came out quickly and
scored before 30 seconds had
ticked off the clock.
When Arnold fouled a Pep
perdine player inside the
four-meter line and the Waves
were awarded a penalty shot,
things began to look even
worse for the Cards. But Gan
sel, as he did in last year's
NCAA's, lunged out to block
the penalty shot and the tide
turned against the Waves.
In the ensuing two minutes,
Stanford scored four times —
twice from the arm of Burke —
and when the period ended
the Cards clung to a tenuous
5-3 lead.
During the second quarter,
the Stanford lead went from
tenuous to nearly nonexistent.
The Waves outscored the
Cards — or more precisely,
Alan Mouchawar — 3-2 in the
quarter and Stanford got out of
the pool at half time leading
7-6.
Part of the reason for the

close score at half time lay in
the Cards' inability to convert
on man-up situations — usu
ally a strong point in Stanford's
game.
In the first half, the Cards
blew three 6-on-5 oppor
tunities and finished the game
having converted on only one
of five chances.
Pepperdine, meanwhile,
kept close by virtue of three
first-half goals by hole man
Terry Schroeder, who also sets
holeforthe U.S. national team.
"You've gotta stop
Schroeder," said Dettamanti.
"If you don't execute perfectly
(on defense) they'll score. You
almost have to play perfect de
fense."
The Cardinal coach said
execution was the main prob
lem in the first half for Stan
ford, but he added that the
Cards' strategy for stopping
Schroeder was working.
According to Dettamanti,
the Cards tried to tire
Schroeder out by moving him
as far down the pool as possi
ble on defense, thereby forc
ing him to swim the entire
length of the pool when the
ball turned over.
It seemed to work. When the

teams began the second half,
Schroeder was visibly fatigued.
Stanford, sensing a let-up in the
Wave attack, tightened down
the defensive execution and
held Schroeder to only one
goal in the second half.
Pepperdine managed only
two goals in the third period
against the Card's four, and the
final quarter was all Stanford as
three Cardinal goals found
their way into the Pepperdine
net, including top-scorer
Burke's fourth of the game.
Meanwhile, California had
little trouble getting by UC-
Irvine in their semifinal match
and the stage was set for the
fifth Stanford-Cal contest of
the year and the third in the last
three weeks.
Stanford placed six players
on All-Tournament teams.
Cansel, Arnold and Burke were
chosen to the first team and
Mouchawar, Angelo and
Campbell were voted to the
second team.
Kelsey, who played every
minute of the final game,
summed up Stanford's desire
to win:
"This is the culmination of
four months work. You'll kill
yourself before you quit."

Stanford junior Roy Cedarstrom (21) follows a pass thrown to a teammate in the Cards' 20-2 romp over
Air Force in the first round of the NCAA water polo finals Saturday in Long Beach. After drowning the
Falcons, the Cards knocked off Pepperdine, 14-8, and Cal, 7-6, to win the national title.
These are the times that try
men's souls . . .
Long Beach — If it hadn't
happened before a capacity
crowd of more than 2000
screaming spectators, one
would have thought the script
had been written by a Hol
lywood screenwriter with a
flair for the dramatic.
But it was real.
With 26 seconds left in
sudden-death overtime senior
Doug Burke pushed a shot past
California goalie David Young
to give the Stanford water polo
team a 7-6 victory in the finals
of the NCAA Championships at
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach last night.
Stanford's bread and butter,
the counter-attack, had been
mostly ineffective against the
Bears. But after a series of ex
changes in the sudden death
period, in which each team
missed three opportunities to
score, junior Randy Kalbus
took an outlet pass on the left
wing, tossed the ball to a driv
ing Alan Mouchawar, who in
turn passed it to Burke on the
right side.
A split second later, Stanford
became the national champ
ions.

"I just wanted that game
over with," a jubilant Burke
said afterward.
"Doug was open," com
mented a champagne-soaked
Mouchawar, "and I didn't want
to miss that last shot."
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said his first feeling
after Burke's score was one of
great relief.
"It's the greatest feeling in
the world (to win the NCAAs),"
he said.
The first quarter of the game,
however, belonged entirely to
Cal as the Bears seemed to do
everything right and the Cards
seemed helpless to stop the
onslaught. Cal's Kevin
Robertson scored three goals
in the quarter to give the Bears
a 3-0 lead at the end of the
period.
For Stanford it was a quarter
marked by missed shots and
numerous ejections. Both
senior Tom Angelo and
freshman Jody Campbell were
called for two personal faults in
the first quarter. Angelo even
tually fouled out with his third
in the fourth quarter.
"We were very nervous,"
said Dettamanti. "We made
some mistakes and they
capitalized on them."

Down by three goals going
into the second quarter the
sluggish Stanford offense
slowly came to life, methodi
cally chipping away at the Cal
lead until it was 3-2 at halftime.
After the break, Mouchawar
paced the team on a crusade:
"Beat the Bears."
The freshman, playing in his
home town, scored the next
three goals of the game — one
in the third quarter and two
early in the fourth — and sud
denly Stanford found itself
holding a 5-3 advantage.
Cal, however, did not make
it to the finals on luck. The
Bears battled back in the last
two minutes of regulation play
to tie the score at five.
In the following two over
time periods, Cal's Carlos Stef
fens scored a goal in the first
but Kalbus tied it up again in
the second with a tap-in off a
rebounded 6-on-5 shot.
And then there was the
sudden-death period, or as
goalie John Gansel put it:"I
was just praying to Cod that it
didn't go in at my end."

took an outlet pass on the left
wing, tossed the ball to a driv
ing Alan Mouchawar, who in
turn passed it to Burke on the
right side.
A split second later, Stanford
became the national champ
ions.

"I just wanted that game
over with," a jubilant Burke
said afterward.
"Doug was open," com
mented a champagne-soaked
Mouchawar, "and I didn't want
to miss that last shot."
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said his first feeling
after Burke's score was one of
great relief.
"It's the greatest feeling in
the world (to win the NCAAs),"
he said.
The first quarter of the game,
however, belonged entirely to
Cal as the Bears seemed to do
everything right and the Cards
seemed helpless to stop the
onslaught. Cal's Kevin
Robertson scored three goals
in the quarter to give the Bears
a 3-0 lead at the end of the
period.
For Stanford it was a quarter
marked by missed shots and
numerous ejections. Both
senior Tom Angelo and
freshman Jody Campbell were
called for two personal faults in
the first quarter. Angelo even
tually fouled out with his third
in the fourth quarter.
"We were very nervous,"
said Dettamanti. "We made
some mistakes and they
capitalized on them."

Down by three goals going
into the second quarter the
sluggish Stanford offense
slowly came to life, methodi
cally chipping away at the Cal
lead until it was 3-2 at halftime.
After the break, Mouchawar
paced the team on a crusade:
"Beat the Bears."
The freshman, playing in his
home town, scored the next
three goals of the game — one
in the third quarter and two
early in the fourth — and sud
denly Stanford found itself
holding a 5-3 advantage.
Cal, however, did not make
it to the finals on luck. The
Bears battled back in the last
two minutes of regulation play
to tie the score at five.
In the following two over
time periods, Cal's Carlos Stef
fens scored a goal in the first
but Kalbus tied it up again in
the second with a tap-in off a
rebounded 6-on-5 shot.
And then there was the
sudden-death period, or as
goalie John Gansel put it:"I
was just praying to Cod that it
didn't go in at my end."

the ground.
The first quarter could be
most accurately described as
the "Kelsey and Angelo Show"
as each scored two goals and
Kelsey made two of his game
high four steals.
Because of an injury to the
hand of freshman hole man
Jody Campbell last Wednes
day, senior Dave Egan stepped
in to start the game.
Very quickly in the first quar
ter, however, Egan was twice
ejected and Dettamanti went
to his bench and came up with
sophomore Bill Taylor. Taylor
responded by scoring four
goals — two in the second
quarter — to pace the Cardinal
attack. Angelo finished with
three.
By half time, Stanford held
an 11-0 lead as the Cards'
counter-attack "completely
blew them out," according to
Dettamanti.
Goalie Vince Vannelli and
the Cardinal defense held Air
Force scoreless until 1:49 in the
third quarter when Mike Mul
lady skipped one past Vannel
li's outstretched arms.
Pepperdine has been a thorn
in Stanford's side for the last

couple of years and the semifi
nal match between the two
teams Saturday night was no
different.
With Campbell back in the
starting lineup and )ohn Gan
sel in the goal the Cards were at
full strength. The Waves, how
ever, came out quickly and
scored before 30 seconds had
ticked off the clock.
When Arnold fouled a Pep
perdine player inside the
four-meter line and the Waves
were awarded a penalty shot,
things began to look even
worse for the Cards. But Gan
sel, as he did in last year's
NCAA's, lunged out to block
the penalty shot and the tide
turned against the Waves.
In the ensuing two minutes,
Stanford scored four times —
twice from the arm of Burke —
and when the period ended
the Cards clung to a tenuous
5-3 lead.
During the second quarter,
the Stanford lead went from
tenuous to nearly nonexistent.
The Waves outscored the
Cards — or more precisely,
Alan Mouchawar — 3-2 in the
quarter and Stanford got out of
the pool at half time leading
7-6.
Part of the reason for the

close score at half time lay in
the Cards' inability to convert
on man-up situations — usu
ally a strong point in Stanford's
game.
In the first half, the Cards
blew three 6-on-5 oppor
tunities and finished the game
having converted on only one
of five chances.
Pepperdine, meanwhile,
kept close by virtue of three
first-half goals by hole man
Terry Schroeder, who also sets
holeforthe U.S. national team.
"You've gotta stop
Schroeder," said Dettamanti.
"If you don't execute perfectly
(on defense) they'll score. You
almost have to play perfect de
fense."
The Cardinal coach said
execution was the main prob
lem in the first half for Stan
ford, but he added that the
Cards' strategy for stopping
Schroeder was working.
According to Dettamanti,
the Cards tried to tire
Schroeder out by moving him
as far down the pool as possi
ble on defense, thereby forc
ing him to swim the entire
length of the pool when the
ball turned over.
It seemed to work. When the

teams began the second half,
Schroeder was visibly fatigued.
Stanford, sensing a let-up in the
Wave attack, tightened down
the defensive execution and
held Schroeder to only one
goal in the second half.
Pepperdine managed only
two goals in the third period
against the Card's four, and the
final quarter was all Stanford as
three Cardinal goals found
their way into the Pepperdine
net, including top-scorer
Burke's fourth of the game.
Meanwhile, California had
little trouble getting by UC-
Irvine in their semifinal match
and the stage was set for the
fifth Stanford-Cal contest of
the year and the third in the last
three weeks.
Stanford placed six players
on All-Tournament teams.
Cansel, Arnold and Burke were
chosen to the first team and
Mouchawar, Angelo and
Campbell were voted to the
second team.
Kelsey, who played every
minute of the final game,
summed up Stanford's desire
to win:
"This is the culmination of
four months work. You'll kill
yourself before you quit."

Stanford junior Roy Cedarstrom (21) follows a pass thrown to a teammate in the Cards' 20-2 romp over
Air Force in the first round of the NCAA water polo finals Saturday in Long Beach. After drowning the
Falcons, the Cards knocked off Pepperdine, 14-8, and Cal, 7-6, to win the national title.
These are the times that try
men's souls . . .
Long Beach — If it hadn't
happened before a capacity
crowd of more than 2000
screaming spectators, one
would have thought the script
had been written by a Hol
lywood screenwriter with a
flair for the dramatic.
But it was real.
With 26 seconds left in
sudden-death overtime senior
Doug Burke pushed a shot past
California goalie David Young
to give the Stanford water polo
team a 7-6 victory in the finals
of the NCAA Championships at
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach last night.
Stanford's bread and butter,
the counter-attack, had been
mostly ineffective against the
Bears. But after a series of ex
changes in the sudden death
period, in which each team
missed three opportunities to
score, junior Randy Kalbus
took an outlet pass on the left
wing, tossed the ball to a driv
ing Alan Mouchawar, who in
turn passed it to Burke on the
right side.
A split second later, Stanford
became the national champ
ions.
