# Poloists edge Cal in overtime for NCAA title

These are the times that try
men's souls . . .
Long Beach — If it hadn't
happened before a capacity
crowd of more than 2000
screaming spectators, one
would have thought the script
had been written by a Hol
lywood screenwriter with a
flair for the dramatic.
But it was real.
With 26 seconds left in
sudden-death overtime senior
Doug Burke pushed a shot past
California goalie David Young
to give the Stanford water polo
team a 7-6 victory in the finals
of the NCAA Championships at
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach last night.
Stanford's bread and butter,
the counter-attack, had been
mostly ineffective against the
Bears. But after a series of ex
changes in the sudden death
period, in which each team
missed three opportunities to
score, junior Randy Kalbus
took an outlet pass on the left
wing, tossed the ball to a driv
ing Alan Mouchawar, who in
turn passed it to Burke on the
right side.
A split second later, Stanford
became the national champ
ions.

"I just wanted that game
over with," a jubilant Burke
said afterward.
"Doug was open," com
mented a champagne-soaked
Mouchawar, "and I didn't want
to miss that last shot."
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said his first feeling
after Burke's score was one of
great relief.
"It's the greatest feeling in
the world (to win the NCAAs),"
he said.
The first quarter of the game,
however, belonged entirely to
Cal as the Bears seemed to do
everything right and the Cards
seemed helpless to stop the
onslaught. Cal's Kevin
Robertson scored three goals
in the quarter to give the Bears
a 3-0 lead at the end of the
period.
For Stanford it was a quarter
marked by missed shots and
numerous ejections. Both
senior Tom Angelo and
freshman Jody Campbell were
called for two personal faults in
the first quarter. Angelo even
tually fouled out with his third
in the fourth quarter.
"We were very nervous,"
said Dettamanti. "We made
some mistakes and they
capitalized on them."

Down by three goals going
into the second quarter the
sluggish Stanford offense
slowly came to life, methodi
cally chipping away at the Cal
lead until it was 3-2 at halftime.
After the break, Mouchawar
paced the team on a crusade:
"Beat the Bears."
The freshman, playing in his
home town, scored the next
three goals of the game — one
in the third quarter and two
early in the fourth — and sud
denly Stanford found itself
holding a 5-3 advantage.
Cal, however, did not make
it to the finals on luck. The
Bears battled back in the last
two minutes of regulation play
to tie the score at five.
In the following two over
time periods, Cal's Carlos Stef
fens scored a goal in the first
but Kalbus tied it up again in
the second with a tap-in off a
rebounded 6-on-5 shot.
And then there was the
sudden-death period, or as
goalie John Gansel put it:"I
was just praying to Cod that it
didn't go in at my end."
