## Richard Wohl 'P.O. Box Blues' 
### 
Unfortunately, a numb bureaucracy and its
senseless waste is a problem not confined to
national headlines. A little investigation has laid
bare a startling example here on campus, which
directly affects most undergraduates.
As anyone who rents a post office box knows,
the rates increased 25 percent this year, to a fat
$20. Some people prefer to rent a box for privacy
or convenience, but most students have no
choice: there is no mail delivery to their dorms.
Students seem to assume that this state of
affairs is somehow Cod-given. The deception
begins with the note you find inserted in the
materials the University sends incoming
freshmen, to the effect that federal mail cannot
be delivered to Wilbur, Branner, Toyon,
Lagunita, Roble, or Flo Mo; in other words, you
had better jump at the carrot costing $20, be
cause the stick is no mail at all.
But in reality this system is far from Cod
given. It is not University policy that students in
the above dorms cannot receive mail. It is not
U.S. Postal Service policy, either. Rather, the
whole question has somehow slipped through
the fingers of the policy-makers; an issue that
costs students a conservatively-estimated
$40,000-$50,000 every year has been lost some
where, in that amorphous gray area between
bureaucracies.
Even a cursory look at what goes on now
makes this negligence obvious. The present sys
tem is utterly irrational. Among the dorms, both
Crothers and Stern have mail receptacles. All
Row houses, including the newest ones, and all
the fraternities, each receive a single bulk deliv
ery, to be sorted by someone inside. Mirrielees
and Manzanita residents get mail delivered a la
Stern. Everyone else on campus suffers the post
office box blues.
In all of this, it is interesting to note that no
administrative office or faculty department goes
without direct delivery — evidently the
bureaucracy does know howtocare foritsown.
But more than just the system itself testifies to
the fact that student needs have been ignored.
Interviews my roommate and I conducted last
autumn with officials in the Dean of Residential
Education and the Residence Manager's Office
revealed an unusual lack of knowledge and con
cern.
The best they could do was to give us a copy of
their files on the subject, which showed little
more than their own success in sitting sedately
on more than 10 years of intermittent com
plaints. During these years, both offices found it
easy to assume that post office regulations were
to blame.
Yet, as noted above, the utter irrationality of
the present system is itselfpr/ma facie evidence
against this assumption.
Still stronger evidence against the lazy logic of
the past came from a new round of interviews I
conducted last week. Rod Sodlink, manager of
Stanford's post office, stated flatly that he
"would rather not even be in the post office box
business." Despite the revenue from rentals,
the mammoth daily task of individually sorting

so much mail gives his employees the P.O. box
blues, too.
I asked how he would feel about a restruc
tured system, where the University would sup
ply each house with its own big street mail box,
like each row house and fraternity has now. In
other words, near the main office of each dorm
complex, there would be a line of seven or eight
boxes, oneforeach house. As on the Row, every
day someone from each house would pick up
the mail and sort it into alphabetically-ordered
cubby-holes inside.
"I wouldn't have any objections to that at all,"
Sodlink replied. He showed me the latest U.S.
Postal Service regulations, which specifically
permit "mail for students living in dormitory
buildings or residence halls on campus to be
delivered in bulk to one point in each build
ing "
But before any of this can happen, three
bureaucratic hurdles must be jumped — some
thing no one has yet had the initiative to try.
First, each house within a dorm complex —
Arroyo in Wilbur, for example — should be de
signated as a separate "building," to satisfy post
office rules. "We already do that ourselves,"
confirmed Phil Curry in the Dean of Residential
Education's Office.
The second question, not surprisingly, is
money. "The costs incurred to the residential
system would have to be resolved," cautioned
Rob Ramirez of the Residence Manager's Office.
Apparently, each big mailbox, plus the cubby
holes inside the house, cost a wicked $300.
Even so, simple math shows how cost
effective such an expenditure would be. A
house like Arroyo, with 90 people, presently
pays $1800 every year.
The third problem may prove the most dif
ficult: getting approval for the new deliveries
from the regional postal director. Nonetheless,
despite that office's notorious reputation, com
bined pressure both from the local sympathetic
postmaster and from the considerable political
weight of the University might well persuade.
To accomplish all this, University housing and
local postal officials will need to communicate
and coordinate carefully in a concentrated and
planned effort — a continuation of past policy
certainly will not serve the students' best in
terest.
But more crucial is interest and input from
students themselves. In their lack of knowledge
and concern about the postal delivery problem,
administrators are by and large reflecting stu
dent apathy.
This time, let's make it clear that we will not be
satisfied with a passive assumption of failure, a
few half-hearted phone calls, or a short flurry of
exchanged memos. Find a way to tell the Resi
dential Education and Residence Manager's Of
fices that you care. Otherwise, don't wince
when you next pay your $20, or when you hear
someone humming "The P.O. Box Blues."

ply each house with its own big street mail box,
like each row house and fraternity has now. In
other words, near the main office of each dorm
complex, there would be a line of seven or eight
boxes, oneforeach house. As on the Row, every
day someone from each house would pick up
the mail and sort it into alphabetically-ordered
cubby-holes inside.
"I wouldn't have any objections to that at all,"
Sodlink replied. He showed me the latest U.S.
Postal Service regulations, which specifically
permit "mail for students living in dormitory
buildings or residence halls on campus to be
delivered in bulk to one point in each build
ing "
But before any of this can happen, three
bureaucratic hurdles must be jumped — some
thing no one has yet had the initiative to try.
First, each house within a dorm complex —
Arroyo in Wilbur, for example — should be de
signated as a separate "building," to satisfy post
office rules. "We already do that ourselves,"
confirmed Phil Curry in the Dean of Residential
Education's Office.
The second question, not surprisingly, is
money. "The costs incurred to the residential
system would have to be resolved," cautioned
Rob Ramirez of the Residence Manager's Office.
Apparently, each big mailbox, plus the cubby
holes inside the house, cost a wicked $300.
Even so, simple math shows how cost
effective such an expenditure would be. A
house like Arroyo, with 90 people, presently
pays $1800 every year.
The third problem may prove the most dif
ficult: getting approval for the new deliveries
from the regional postal director. Nonetheless,
despite that office's notorious reputation, com
bined pressure both from the local sympathetic
postmaster and from the considerable political
weight of the University might well persuade.
To accomplish all this, University housing and
local postal officials will need to communicate
and coordinate carefully in a concentrated and
planned effort — a continuation of past policy
certainly will not serve the students' best in
terest.
But more crucial is interest and input from
students themselves. In their lack of knowledge
and concern about the postal delivery problem,
administrators are by and large reflecting stu
dent apathy.
This time, let's make it clear that we will not be
satisfied with a passive assumption of failure, a
few half-hearted phone calls, or a short flurry of
exchanged memos. Find a way to tell the Resi
dential Education and Residence Manager's Of
fices that you care. Otherwise, don't wince
when you next pay your $20, or when you hear
someone humming "The P.O. Box Blues."

Unfortunately, a numb bureaucracy and its
senseless waste is a problem not confined to
national headlines. A little investigation has laid
bare a startling example here on campus, which
directly affects most undergraduates.
As anyone who rents a post office box knows,
the rates increased 25 percent this year, to a fat
$20. Some people prefer to rent a box for privacy
or convenience, but most students have no
choice: there is no mail delivery to their dorms.
Students seem to assume that this state of
affairs is somehow Cod-given. The deception
begins with the note you find inserted in the
materials the University sends incoming
freshmen, to the effect that federal mail cannot
be delivered to Wilbur, Branner, Toyon,
Lagunita, Roble, or Flo Mo; in other words, you
had better jump at the carrot costing $20, be
cause the stick is no mail at all.
But in reality this system is far from Cod
given. It is not University policy that students in
the above dorms cannot receive mail. It is not
U.S. Postal Service policy, either. Rather, the
whole question has somehow slipped through
the fingers of the policy-makers; an issue that
costs students a conservatively-estimated
$40,000-$50,000 every year has been lost some
where, in that amorphous gray area between
bureaucracies.
Even a cursory look at what goes on now
makes this negligence obvious. The present sys
tem is utterly irrational. Among the dorms, both
Crothers and Stern have mail receptacles. All
Row houses, including the newest ones, and all
the fraternities, each receive a single bulk deliv
ery, to be sorted by someone inside. Mirrielees
and Manzanita residents get mail delivered a la
Stern. Everyone else on campus suffers the post
office box blues.
In all of this, it is interesting to note that no
administrative office or faculty department goes
without direct delivery — evidently the
bureaucracy does know howtocare foritsown.
But more than just the system itself testifies to
the fact that student needs have been ignored.
Interviews my roommate and I conducted last
autumn with officials in the Dean of Residential
Education and the Residence Manager's Office
revealed an unusual lack of knowledge and con
cern.
The best they could do was to give us a copy of
their files on the subject, which showed little
more than their own success in sitting sedately
on more than 10 years of intermittent com
plaints. During these years, both offices found it
easy to assume that post office regulations were
to blame.
Yet, as noted above, the utter irrationality of
the present system is itselfpr/ma facie evidence
against this assumption.
Still stronger evidence against the lazy logic of
the past came from a new round of interviews I
conducted last week. Rod Sodlink, manager of
Stanford's post office, stated flatly that he
"would rather not even be in the post office box
business." Despite the revenue from rentals,
the mammoth daily task of individually sorting

so much mail gives his employees the P.O. box
blues, too.

or convenience, but most students have no
choice: there is no mail delivery to their dorms.
Students seem to assume that this state of
affairs is somehow Cod-given. The deception
begins with the note you find inserted in the
materials the University sends incoming
freshmen, to the effect that federal mail cannot
be delivered to Wilbur, Branner, Toyon,
Lagunita, Roble, or Flo Mo; in other words, you
had better jump at the carrot costing $20, be
cause the stick is no mail at all.
But in reality this system is far from Cod
given. It is not University policy that students in
the above dorms cannot receive mail. It is not
U.S. Postal Service policy, either. Rather, the
whole question has somehow slipped through
the fingers of the policy-makers; an issue that
costs students a conservatively-estimated
$40,000-$50,000 every year has been lost some
where, in that amorphous gray area between
bureaucracies.
Even a cursory look at what goes on now
makes this negligence obvious. The present sys
tem is utterly irrational. Among the dorms, both
Crothers and Stern have mail receptacles. All
Row houses, including the newest ones, and all
the fraternities, each receive a single bulk deliv
ery, to be sorted by someone inside. Mirrielees
and Manzanita residents get mail delivered a la
Stern. Everyone else on campus suffers the post
office box blues.
In all of this, it is interesting to note that no
administrative office or faculty department goes
without direct delivery — evidently the
bureaucracy does know howtocare foritsown.
But more than just the system itself testifies to
the fact that student needs have been ignored.
Interviews my roommate and I conducted last
autumn with officials in the Dean of Residential
Education and the Residence Manager's Office
revealed an unusual lack of knowledge and con
cern.
The best they could do was to give us a copy of
their files on the subject, which showed little
more than their own success in sitting sedately
on more than 10 years of intermittent com
plaints. During these years, both offices found it
easy to assume that post office regulations were
to blame.
Yet, as noted above, the utter irrationality of
the present system is itselfpr/ma facie evidence
against this assumption.
Still stronger evidence against the lazy logic of
the past came from a new round of interviews I
conducted last week. Rod Sodlink, manager of
Stanford's post office, stated flatly that he
"would rather not even be in the post office box
business." Despite the revenue from rentals,
the mammoth daily task of individually sorting

so much mail gives his employees the P.O. box
blues, too.
I asked how he would feel about a restruc
tured system, where the University would sup
ply each house with its own big street mail box,
like each row house and fraternity has now. In
other words, near the main office of each dorm
complex, there would be a line of seven or eight
boxes, oneforeach house. As on the Row, every
day someone from each house would pick up
the mail and sort it into alphabetically-ordered
cubby-holes inside.
"I wouldn't have any objections to that at all,"
Sodlink replied. He showed me the latest U.S.
Postal Service regulations, which specifically
permit "mail for students living in dormitory
buildings or residence halls on campus to be
delivered in bulk to one point in each build
ing "
But before any of this can happen, three
bureaucratic hurdles must be jumped — some
thing no one has yet had the initiative to try.
First, each house within a dorm complex —
Arroyo in Wilbur, for example — should be de
signated as a separate "building," to satisfy post
office rules. "We already do that ourselves,"
confirmed Phil Curry in the Dean of Residential
Education's Office.
The second question, not surprisingly, is
money. "The costs incurred to the residential
system would have to be resolved," cautioned
Rob Ramirez of the Residence Manager's Office.
Apparently, each big mailbox, plus the cubby
holes inside the house, cost a wicked $300.
Even so, simple math shows how cost
effective such an expenditure would be. A
house like Arroyo, with 90 people, presently
pays $1800 every year.
The third problem may prove the most dif
ficult: getting approval for the new deliveries
from the regional postal director. Nonetheless,
despite that office's notorious reputation, com
bined pressure both from the local sympathetic
postmaster and from the considerable political
weight of the University might well persuade.
To accomplish all this, University housing and
local postal officials will need to communicate
and coordinate carefully in a concentrated and
planned effort — a continuation of past policy
certainly will not serve the students' best in
terest.
But more crucial is interest and input from
students themselves. In their lack of knowledge
and concern about the postal delivery problem,
administrators are by and large reflecting stu
dent apathy.
This time, let's make it clear that we will not be
satisfied with a passive assumption of failure, a
few half-hearted phone calls, or a short flurry of
exchanged memos. Find a way to tell the Resi
dential Education and Residence Manager's Of
fices that you care. Otherwise, don't wince
when you next pay your $20, or when you hear
someone humming "The P.O. Box Blues."

Unfortunately, a numb bureaucracy and its
senseless waste is a problem not confined to
national headlines. A little investigation has laid
bare a startling example here on campus, which
directly affects most undergraduates.
As anyone who rents a post office box knows,
the rates increased 25 percent this year, to a fat
$20. Some people prefer to rent a box for privacy
or convenience, but most students have no
choice: there is no mail delivery to their dorms.
