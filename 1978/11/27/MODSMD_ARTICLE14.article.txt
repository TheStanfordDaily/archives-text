## Clear terms on abortion 
### 
Abortion just may be too hot
an issue for anyone with defi
nite views on the matter to dis
cuss fairly. But in the hope that
genuine dialogue can at least
be given a chance, let me
suggest a few possible ground
rules and basic distinctions.
To start with, the definition
of abortion and the names
given to the opposing factions
must not be conducive to cir
cular reasoning or parody of the
opposition. If we begin by cal
ling abortion "the murder of
unborn babies" or "a choice
made by a woman over her
own body," or refer to the
woman involved as "the
mother," then we are already
begging some of the very ques
tions the abortion issue raises:
Is a fetus a baby, or a human
being proper? Is it merely a
part of a woman's own body?
And so on.
We must also avoid using
labels that our opposition will
not accept. Do we call ourse
lves pro-life? Is the other side
therefore anti-life? Do we call
ourselves pro-choice? Is the
other side therefore anti
choice? Surely two of the ques
tions that need real answers
are "What is life?" and "What is
choice?"
And speaking of sacrosanct,
let me suggest that abortion, in
most cases anyway, is not fun
damentally a medical issue. Or
rather, let me simply ask what
special sanction is given to
something decided on "bet
ween a woman and her doc
tor?" What if we said "between
a woman and her lawyer" or
"between a woman and her
stockbroker?" Sure, abortion
has its medical aspect. But it
has legal and financial aspects,
too. And neither legal nor fi
nancial practitioners are
treated as ersatz priests.
Can we not agree at least that
abortion is essentially a moral
issue, and that the two main
opposing groups consist, re
spectively, of those who see
abortion as morally permissi
ble and those who see it as
morally impermissible? If the
two sides accordingly agree
about the nature of the basic

issue — if they can agree on
what it is they disagree about
— then a lot of fruitless animos
ity will be avoided.
Agreement on the moral
character of the issue will also,
one hopes, put a stop to the
ledger-sheet approach to abor
tion. To talk about the cost of
aborting or not aborting as if it
counted for anything either
way is simply to misapprehend
the nature of the basic issue. If
something is morally wrong, it
is not made moral by being
profitable. If something is
morally right, it is not made
immoral by being unprofita
ble.
It is worth adding that if
something is wrong, it is not
made morally permissible by
the fact that the rich are freer
than the poor to behave im
morally.
However, we must sharply
distinguish the basic moral
issue from the legal issue, even
though they are connected.
Among those who consider
abortion morally impermissi
ble, some favor making it il
legal, while others either ac
cept legalization or simply
aren't sure what position to
take. What confusion would be
avoided if this distinction were
observed! It is simply
muddle-headed to think that if
you consider abortion wrong,
you've got to make it illegal.
Maybe you ought to; but that's
quite a separate issue.
The question of legalization
must in turn be distinguished
from what I would call the fiscal
aspect of abortion. If abortion
takes place, who pays for it? At
the moment this is a hot ques
tion politically, and one's posi
tion on it will follow from one's
view of abortion's morality, not
its legality. It seems to me,
furthermore, that both sides of
the abortion debate must ac
cept the right of other citizens
and taxpayers to have a say in
how public money is spent.
Presumably, if one thinks abor
tion morally permissible, one
will have no moral objection to
its being publicly funded. If
one thinks it morally imper
missible, one will have serious

objections indeed. Both posi
tions are natural and rightful.
Neither ought to be decried as
irrational or fanatical.
By creating a caricature of
their opposition or by using
logically outrageous slogans,
both sides cheapen their posi
tions. The virtual guerrilla tac
tics of a small group of "anti
abortionists" are indeed de
plorable, and bespeaks dread
ful lack of moral sensitivity.
However, those who believe
abortion is morally permissible
and who favor its being pub
licly funded have no logical
grounds at all for seeing a de
nial for such funding as "forc
ing you to have a baby," to
quote one banner that flut
tered over the campus.
Both sides of the abortion
debate, I date say, nod to
show greater respect for each
other and for the principles of
sound reasoning. What I have
tried to do here is to indicate
some things on which we
might all agree: abortion is bas
ically a moral issue but has dis
tinct legal and fiscal aspects
that must be considered sepa
rately.
Of course, the definition of
abortion remains problematic.
Myself, I do not know whether
the line should be drawn at
conception, at implantation or
at 40 days. However, assuming
that some such line can be
drawn, I must admit that I do
believe abortion to be morally
impermissible. I am not at all
sure that it ought to be made
illegal. But on the basis of what
I consider its moral status, I
strongly oppose its being pub
licly funded. So do many
others. And I would submit to
those who believe abortion to
be morally permissiblethat any
citizen has a perfect right to
voice such opposition.
Only if all parties in this way
recognize both the nature of
the issues and each other's
right to speak out will the de
bate on abortion have a chance
of being carried on fairly and
responsibly.

rather, let me simply ask what
special sanction is given to
something decided on "bet
ween a woman and her doc
tor?" What if we said "between
a woman and her lawyer" or
"between a woman and her
stockbroker?" Sure, abortion
has its medical aspect. But it
has legal and financial aspects,
too. And neither legal nor fi
nancial practitioners are
treated as ersatz priests.
Can we not agree at least that
abortion is essentially a moral
issue, and that the two main
opposing groups consist, re
spectively, of those who see
abortion as morally permissi
ble and those who see it as
morally impermissible? If the
two sides accordingly agree
about the nature of the basic

issue — if they can agree on
what it is they disagree about
— then a lot of fruitless animos
ity will be avoided.
Agreement on the moral
character of the issue will also,
one hopes, put a stop to the
ledger-sheet approach to abor
tion. To talk about the cost of
aborting or not aborting as if it
counted for anything either
way is simply to misapprehend
the nature of the basic issue. If
something is morally wrong, it
is not made moral by being
profitable. If something is
morally right, it is not made
immoral by being unprofita
ble.
It is worth adding that if
something is wrong, it is not
made morally permissible by
the fact that the rich are freer
than the poor to behave im
morally.
However, we must sharply
distinguish the basic moral
issue from the legal issue, even
though they are connected.
Among those who consider
abortion morally impermissi
ble, some favor making it il
legal, while others either ac
cept legalization or simply
aren't sure what position to
take. What confusion would be
avoided if this distinction were
observed! It is simply
muddle-headed to think that if
you consider abortion wrong,
you've got to make it illegal.
Maybe you ought to; but that's
quite a separate issue.
The question of legalization
must in turn be distinguished
from what I would call the fiscal
aspect of abortion. If abortion
takes place, who pays for it? At
the moment this is a hot ques
tion politically, and one's posi
tion on it will follow from one's
view of abortion's morality, not
its legality. It seems to me,
furthermore, that both sides of
the abortion debate must ac
cept the right of other citizens
and taxpayers to have a say in
how public money is spent.
Presumably, if one thinks abor
tion morally permissible, one
will have no moral objection to
its being publicly funded. If
one thinks it morally imper
missible, one will have serious

objections indeed. Both posi
tions are natural and rightful.
Neither ought to be decried as
irrational or fanatical.
By creating a caricature of
their opposition or by using
logically outrageous slogans,
both sides cheapen their posi
tions. The virtual guerrilla tac
tics of a small group of "anti
abortionists" are indeed de
plorable, and bespeaks dread
ful lack of moral sensitivity.
However, those who believe
abortion is morally permissible
and who favor its being pub
licly funded have no logical
grounds at all for seeing a de
nial for such funding as "forc
ing you to have a baby," to
quote one banner that flut
tered over the campus.
Both sides of the abortion
debate, I date say, nod to
show greater respect for each
other and for the principles of
sound reasoning. What I have
tried to do here is to indicate
some things on which we
might all agree: abortion is bas
ically a moral issue but has dis
tinct legal and fiscal aspects
that must be considered sepa
rately.
Of course, the definition of
abortion remains problematic.
Myself, I do not know whether
the line should be drawn at
conception, at implantation or
at 40 days. However, assuming
that some such line can be
drawn, I must admit that I do
believe abortion to be morally
impermissible. I am not at all
sure that it ought to be made
illegal. But on the basis of what
I consider its moral status, I
strongly oppose its being pub
licly funded. So do many
others. And I would submit to
those who believe abortion to
be morally permissiblethat any
citizen has a perfect right to
voice such opposition.
Only if all parties in this way
recognize both the nature of
the issues and each other's
right to speak out will the de
bate on abortion have a chance
of being carried on fairly and
responsibly.
(Dennis Danielson is a
graduate student in English.)
Abortion just may be too hot
an issue for anyone with defi
nite views on the matter to dis
cuss fairly. But in the hope that
genuine dialogue can at least
be given a chance, let me
suggest a few possible ground
rules and basic distinctions.
To start with, the definition
of abortion and the names
given to the opposing factions
must not be conducive to cir
cular reasoning or parody of the
opposition. If we begin by cal
ling abortion "the murder of
unborn babies" or "a choice
made by a woman over her
own body," or refer to the
woman involved as "the
mother," then we are already
begging some of the very ques
tions the abortion issue raises:
Is a fetus a baby, or a human
being proper? Is it merely a
part of a woman's own body?
And so on.
We must also avoid using
labels that our opposition will
not accept. Do we call ourse
lves pro-life? Is the other side
therefore anti-life? Do we call
ourselves pro-choice? Is the
other side therefore anti
choice? Surely two of the ques
tions that need real answers
are "What is life?" and "What is
choice?"
And speaking of sacrosanct,
let me suggest that abortion, in
most cases anyway, is not fun
damentally a medical issue. Or
rather, let me simply ask what
special sanction is given to
something decided on "bet
ween a woman and her doc

It is worth adding that if
something is wrong, it is not
made morally permissible by
the fact that the rich are freer
than the poor to behave im
morally.
However, we must sharply
distinguish the basic moral
issue from the legal issue, even
though they are connected.
Among those who consider
abortion morally impermissi
ble, some favor making it il
legal, while others either ac
cept legalization or simply
aren't sure what position to
take. What confusion would be
avoided if this distinction were
observed! It is simply
muddle-headed to think that if
you consider abortion wrong,
you've got to make it illegal.
Maybe you ought to; but that's
quite a separate issue.
The question of legalization
must in turn be distinguished
from what I would call the fiscal
aspect of abortion. If abortion
takes place, who pays for it? At
the moment this is a hot ques
tion politically, and one's posi
tion on it will follow from one's
view of abortion's morality, not
its legality. It seems to me,
furthermore, that both sides of
the abortion debate must ac
cept the right of other citizens
and taxpayers to have a say in
how public money is spent.
Presumably, if one thinks abor
tion morally permissible, one
will have no moral objection to
its being publicly funded. If
one thinks it morally imper
missible, one will have serious

objections indeed. Both posi
tions are natural and rightful.
Neither ought to be decried as
irrational or fanatical.
By creating a caricature of
their opposition or by using
logically outrageous slogans,
both sides cheapen their posi
tions. The virtual guerrilla tac
tics of a small group of "anti
abortionists" are indeed de
plorable, and bespeaks dread
ful lack of moral sensitivity.
However, those who believe
abortion is morally permissible
and who favor its being pub
licly funded have no logical
grounds at all for seeing a de
nial for such funding as "forc
ing you to have a baby," to
quote one banner that flut
tered over the campus.
Both sides of the abortion
debate, I date say, nod to
show greater respect for each
other and for the principles of
sound reasoning. What I have
tried to do here is to indicate
some things on which we
might all agree: abortion is bas
ically a moral issue but has dis
tinct legal and fiscal aspects
that must be considered sepa
rately.
Of course, the definition of
abortion remains problematic.
Myself, I do not know whether
the line should be drawn at
conception, at implantation or
at 40 days. However, assuming
that some such line can be
drawn, I must admit that I do
believe abortion to be morally
impermissible. I am not at all
sure that it ought to be made
illegal. But on the basis of what
I consider its moral status, I
strongly oppose its being pub
licly funded. So do many
others. And I would submit to
those who believe abortion to
be morally permissiblethat any
citizen has a perfect right to
voice such opposition.
Only if all parties in this way
recognize both the nature of
the issues and each other's
right to speak out will the de
bate on abortion have a chance
of being carried on fairly and
responsibly.
(Dennis Danielson is a
graduate student in English.)
Abortion just may be too hot
an issue for anyone with defi
nite views on the matter to dis
cuss fairly. But in the hope that
genuine dialogue can at least
be given a chance, let me
suggest a few possible ground
rules and basic distinctions.
To start with, the definition
of abortion and the names
given to the opposing factions
must not be conducive to cir
cular reasoning or parody of the
opposition. If we begin by cal
ling abortion "the murder of
unborn babies" or "a choice
made by a woman over her
own body," or refer to the
woman involved as "the
mother," then we are already
begging some of the very ques
tions the abortion issue raises:
Is a fetus a baby, or a human
being proper? Is it merely a
part of a woman's own body?
And so on.
We must also avoid using
labels that our opposition will
not accept. Do we call ourse
lves pro-life? Is the other side
therefore anti-life? Do we call
ourselves pro-choice? Is the
other side therefore anti
choice? Surely two of the ques
tions that need real answers
are "What is life?" and "What is
choice?"
And speaking of sacrosanct,
let me suggest that abortion, in
most cases anyway, is not fun
damentally a medical issue. Or
rather, let me simply ask what
special sanction is given to
something decided on "bet
ween a woman and her doc
tor?" What if we said "between
a woman and her lawyer" or
"between a woman and her
stockbroker?" Sure, abortion
has its medical aspect. But it
has legal and financial aspects,
too. And neither legal nor fi
nancial practitioners are
treated as ersatz priests.
Can we not agree at least that
abortion is essentially a moral
issue, and that the two main
opposing groups consist, re
spectively, of those who see
abortion as morally permissi
ble and those who see it as
morally impermissible? If the
two sides accordingly agree
about the nature of the basic

issue — if they can agree on
what it is they disagree about
— then a lot of fruitless animos
ity will be avoided.
Agreement on the moral
character of the issue will also,
one hopes, put a stop to the
ledger-sheet approach to abor
tion. To talk about the cost of
aborting or not aborting as if it
counted for anything either
way is simply to misapprehend
the nature of the basic issue. If
something is morally wrong, it
is not made moral by being
profitable. If something is
morally right, it is not made
immoral by being unprofita
ble.
It is worth adding that if
something is wrong, it is not
made morally permissible by
the fact that the rich are freer
than the poor to behave im
morally.

issue from the legal issue, even
