## The
						Big Game Weenie roast 
### 
Well, folks, it's all over now. The
weekend of the quarter. Big Game — the
time when we're deluged with rallies,
posters, parties and people trying to pre
tend that we go to a normal, huge football
school.
But nothing's normal about an Ivy
League school founded by one of the rich
est robber barons in the history of the
West. There's no reason why a university
created in memory of an anemic 10-
year-old should handle anything in a con
ventional way.
I looked back on the Big Game weekend
Sunday morning, while showing all the
symptoms ofa 19-year-old college student
headed for delirium tremens by age 30. As
the digital clock flipped to 11:03, I stum
bled gracefully off my top bunk. My
roommate and I tripped over to the eating
club in bare feet and bathrobes braving
the 40-degree weather. (It's amazing how
susceptible I am to such suggestions when
in a semi-conscious state.)
Half-buried in a pile of sports pages
from every imaginable Bay Area news
paper, I managed to down some coffee
and one-third of a blueberry muffin. I
started to reflect on the last two days. First
I realized that the chronology was shot.
The order of key events (the game and the
rallies) was intact, but transitions were
fuzzy, and obscure details stuck in my
mind.
The weekend began with a group of us
forming very short (two-Fiat) caravan up to
San Francisco Friday night. The caravan
survived until the 19th Street exit, where
we got hopelessly split up. We soon gave
up ideas of reuniting and decided to park
Fiat No. 1. Donning red and white in mul
tiple layers we took off to find the Band.
Having forgotten the map, we jogged
through the city for 45 minutes in a work
out which could rival training routes for
the Bay-to-Breakers run.
Eventually we tried hitchhiking. No
luck. Would you pick up someone wear
ing a Stanford sweatshirt, red and white

striped pants, Cal Weenie buttons, and a
bottle of Bacardi?
We finally found the Band, and various
other lost souls, at the rally at Ghirardelli.
We spent two hours tromping around in
mud through clumps of inebriated bodies.
A group of more rambunctious folks were
attempting an uncoordinated derivative of
the can-can. Good times. If you could hear
the Band, it might have been even better.
Some time in the middle of the night we
arrived in Berkeley. Wandering around
with sleeping bags and knapsacks, we
managed to find the Sorority, our home
for the night. We were in bed (on the floor
ofa huge room with 30 other girls) by3:oo.
At 6:30 a.m. we were woken up for coffee
and donuts and singing by our Berkeley
"sisters." If my real sister did that to me,
I'd probably beat her brains in.
We kicked off the day by absorbing the
infectious football spirit of the 50 or so
Greek establishments on the Berkeley
campus. Front porches were lined with
those California residents admitted on the
merits of a computer application and a
B-plus average in high school.
Being the outgoing and socially adept
people typical of Stanford, we spent the
morning hitting "Stanford" parties, where
we would already know everybody. We
rated the parties on a scale of one-to-ten,
based on the alcohol content of the
drinks, minus the number of alumni pre
sent.
Slightly buzzed and feeling especially
cocky, we trudged up to the stadium. The
cockiness wore off when we realized we'd
left our tickets down at the sorority house.
Once inside the stadium, we paraded
back and forth a few times deciding where
to sit. We settled with some people who'd
been there since9a.m. Now that's dedica
tion.
What can I say about the game?
Everyone, especially our weak "competi
tion" from that tax-supported remedial in
stitution of the Blue and Gold, knew we
were going to cream Cal. No surprises

there.
Since the game went along as expected,
the crowd looked for other diversions.
The Stanford Band, crude, rude and
Lampoonish-ly funny, brought quality to
the halftime show. Somebody had to re
scue it after a feeble display by those blue
automatons with the musical talent of a
herd of deaf bison.
Featuring the best in perversion and
off-the-wall humor, the LSJUMB was rev
ving up for its usual quota of post-game
hate mail from the alums. After all, would
you want your kid making lewd jokes
about weenies?
Along with the Band came the Dollies.
Dressed in short red and white skirts
straight out of a small-town lowa parade,
the Dollies bounced around in front of the
beer-saturated top three percent of the
nation's young intellectuals. Only in
America.
During halftime the Cal side made a
pathetic attempt at a card show, full of
vivid images like turkeys. Don't know but
I'd be a bit embarrassed to use that one,
considering their position.
The game ended as the sun edged down
and shadows hit the feet of the first row of
Berkeley fans on the east side of the
stadium. The post-game entertainment
was a battle between the vigor and en
thusiasm of the drug-fortified LSJUMB and
fumbling notes of the Cal band.
Feeling sober and looking as if they'd
just gone through finals or been hit by a
Mack truck, the students plodded out of
the stadium. The heartier fans headed for
more parties. But the majority of the Stan
ford students — having the same stamina
when approaching parties as when tackl
ing term papers — piled into various vehi
cles and headed south to the Farm, the
only Western institution that can still com
bine real intelligence with real football.
See you at the Bluebonnet Bowl.
