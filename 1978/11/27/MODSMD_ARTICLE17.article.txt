Gaieties Review
Misguided
In reading the review done
on Gaieties (Daily, Nov. 21) by
Martha Manqueros and Carl
Chamberlain, I was, to say the
least, disappointed. And,
strangely enough, the reason I
was disappointed had nothing
to do with reviewers' opin
ion of the show. Rather, it was
because the entire review was
totally misguided. They, as re
viewers, missed the entire
premise and foundation that a
show like Gaieties is based on.
What the two reviewers
somehow missed (or at best
played way down), and what
over 4400 other people obvi
ously didn't miss, was the
energy and spirit, the enjoy
ment and fun that the cast and
show possessed. These were
the key ingredients, the neces
sary driving forces behind the
show that made it successful.
It was not, as the reviewers
felt, the "entertaining, if not
meaningful, stereotypes," nor
was it our directing that "ef
fected peripheral character in
teractions and juxtapositions,"
which made the show so much
fun. It was everyone's attitude
that did it. It was the commit
ment by the cast and staff to
having as much fun as possible
while staging and performing
that made the show happen for
us. And it was the audience se
eing and feeling this enjoy
ment and energy from the cast
that made it enjoyable and ex
citing for them.
And while it is good to men
tion outstanding performances
by cast members (they de
served it, as did many more not
mentioned), it is a fallacy to
think for one minute that any
of the larger roles carried the
show. Only the cast as a unit
could, and ultimately did, carry
the show to the heights that it
reached. And it was this base,
this foundation that we started

with, vastly complemented by
great tech, musicand choreog
raphy, that made the show
what it was.
By choosing to review mainly
the technical aspects of the
show based on the usual theat
rical standards, the reviewers
ignored the whole reason that
made Gaieties as good as it was
— the fun and enjoyment that
the cast and staff had in doing
it, and as a direct result of that,
the fun and enjoyment the au
diences had in watching and
being part of it. The major
power and asset of the show
was barely even mentioned.

I just wanted to correct an
impression that I think was pro
jected in last week's article on
Gaieties. Though credit is
sometimes given through the
Drama Department for Ram's
Head work, most of the credit
comes through SCIRE. As a pol
icy board member of SCIRE, I
like to see this organization get
credit for all the work it has
done in sponsoring and en
couraging Ram's Head, and I
know that the organization can
use all the publicity and en

Causes of disease
not simple
Anorexia Nervosa is a com
plex and baffling disorder. The
Daily's(Nov.6) article offered a
simplistic and insensitive view
of this catastrophic illness.
A main cause for th's disease
was presented as America's
"obsession with the sensuous
beauty of a streamlined fi
gure." Anorexia Nervosa re
mains an idiopathic disorder.
New research, however, indi
cates the possibility of
neurological and biochemical

abnormalities, rather than
psychiatric disturbances, as
causal factors.
Anorexia Nervosa is a con
spicuous and public illness,
often treated with a degree of
flippancy inappropriate to the
enormity of the tragedy faced
by these patients and their
families. I hope the profes
sionals, while contending that
"the mouth bone is connected
to the head bone," will re
member that the head bone is
connected to the heart bone.

Gaieties Review
Misguided
In reading the review done
on Gaieties (Daily, Nov. 21) by
Martha Manqueros and Carl
Chamberlain, I was, to say the
least, disappointed. And,
strangely enough, the reason I
was disappointed had nothing
to do with reviewers' opin
ion of the show. Rather, it was
because the entire review was
totally misguided. They, as re
viewers, missed the entire
premise and foundation that a
show like Gaieties is based on.
What the two reviewers
somehow missed (or at best
played way down), and what
over 4400 other people obvi
ously didn't miss, was the
energy and spirit, the enjoy
ment and fun that the cast and
show possessed. These were
the key ingredients, the neces
sary driving forces behind the
show that made it successful.
It was not, as the reviewers
felt, the "entertaining, if not
meaningful, stereotypes," nor
was it our directing that "ef
fected peripheral character in
teractions and juxtapositions,"
which made the show so much
fun. It was everyone's attitude
that did it. It was the commit
ment by the cast and staff to
having as much fun as possible
while staging and performing
that made the show happen for
us. And it was the audience se
eing and feeling this enjoy
ment and energy from the cast
that made it enjoyable and ex
citing for them.
And while it is good to men
tion outstanding performances
by cast members (they de
served it, as did many more not
mentioned), it is a fallacy to
think for one minute that any
of the larger roles carried the
show. Only the cast as a unit
could, and ultimately did, carry
the show to the heights that it
reached. And it was this base,
this foundation that we started

with, vastly complemented by
great tech, musicand choreog
raphy, that made the show
what it was.
By choosing to review mainly
the technical aspects of the
show based on the usual theat
rical standards, the reviewers
ignored the whole reason that
made Gaieties as good as it was
— the fun and enjoyment that
the cast and staff had in doing
it, and as a direct result of that,
the fun and enjoyment the au
diences had in watching and
being part of it. The major
power and asset of the show
was barely even mentioned.

Gaieties. Though credit is

Causes of disease
not simple
Anorexia Nervosa is a com
plex and baffling disorder. The
Daily's(Nov.6) article offered a
simplistic and insensitive view
of this catastrophic illness.
A main cause for th's disease
was presented as America's
"obsession with the sensuous
beauty of a streamlined fi
gure." Anorexia Nervosa re
mains an idiopathic disorder.
New research, however, indi
cates the possibility of
neurological and biochemical

abnormalities, rather than
psychiatric disturbances, as
causal factors.
Anorexia Nervosa is a con
spicuous and public illness,
often treated with a degree of
flippancy inappropriate to the
enormity of the tragedy faced
by these patients and their
families. I hope the profes
sionals, while contending that
"the mouth bone is connected
to the head bone," will re
member that the head bone is
