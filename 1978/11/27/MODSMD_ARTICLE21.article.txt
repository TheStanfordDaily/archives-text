## A 						bettor's primer To beat the odds, take Dallas early 
### JIMMY THE GEEK 
Point spreads, odds, parlays,
pushes — they all seem pretty
straightforward to the bookie,
the guy who juggles them daily
while conducting his business.
But I'm becoming increasingly
aware that some ignorance, as
well as common misconcep
tions, exist among many
people — both sports fans and
non-fans concerning exactly
how the betting game is
played. It seems about time for
an effort to be made to clarify
some of these things.

First of all, how do the odds
work? Most bookies, espe
cially those who cover a size
able volume, take 11-10 odds.
If the bettor decides to bet
$100, he is actually risking $110
(11/10 times 100) in the event
that his team loses.
Also, some bookies require
"money up front" (i.e. — the
bettor leaves the amount that
he is risking with the bookie
when he places his bet), which
complicates things on a $100
bet, the bettor leaves his $110
with the bookie. If his team

loses, the bookie simply keeps
the money to spend as he sees
fit. If the bettor's team wins, on
the other hand, he gets back
his $110 and the $100 he stands
to win for a total of $210.
The $110 can be considered a
deposit, allowingthe bookie to
avoid the risk of bad debts.
This is the way wagering works
at the horse races, where the
price of the wagering ticket ($2
and up) is the "deposit." If a
bettor bets on a horse going off
at 3-1 odds and the horse wins,
the bettor receives his $6 win

nings plus his $2 deposit.
Naturally, though, when a
bookie takes money up front
the bad debt risk is reversed.
Bookies are generally quite
mobile, and all it might take is
one very bad weekend to send
a bookie off on a permanent
trip to Acapulco with the de
posit money.
Now on to the point spread.
Obviously, more than just
which team wins the game is
involved when dealing with
winning and losing bets.
Otherwise, what kind of an

idiot would bet on Northwest
ern if it was playing at Michi
gan? The point spread is the
device that more or less evens
the game up.
In the case of Michigan vs.
Northwestern, the spread
might have Michigan favored
by 28 points, so that someone
betting on Michigan wouldn't
win unless the Wolverines won
the game by at least 29 points.
If Michigan were to win by 27
the players might be satisfied,
but people betting on them
would be damned ticked off

because they'd lose their
money.
To see which team won the
game for betting purposes just
add the point spread to the un
derdog's score. If, after doing
this, you end up with a tie, the
game is called a "push," which
usually calls for no money to
change hands either way. If a
bettor had put $110 up as in my
previous example, he would
simply get his $110 back with
no additional payoff.
Some bookies take pushes,
so that people betting on

either team lose. I'm one of
those bookies, which is why
some people hate me.
There are some misconcep
tions about the real meaning of
point spreads. At the simplest
level they are looked upon as a
statement by the linesmakers
telling us which team they
think is better and how much
they should win by. Hence, in a
weekend where many of the
favorites lose, people taking
this approach will say that the
oddsmen did a bad job. This
type of outlook is inaccurate.

The job of the linesmaker is not
to predict the behavior of foot
ball players, but instead to
predict that of the bettors.
The true object of the point
spread is to split the betting
right down the middle on each
game to assure the bookie of
his profit. This is why you see
spreads change during the
week. If the original spread
creates uneven betting, it must
be shifted a point or two to try
to get things evened up. For
example, the early spread on
Stanford vs. Arizona State fa-

vored Stanford by 2. This
prompted too much betting on
the Sun Devils, though, so the
spread was shifted during the
week until Arizona St. wound
upas a 1-point pick. This way, a
bettor taking Arizona St. had to
give a point instead of taking 2,
so that people were more apt
to bet on Stanford and even the
betting.
Because the bookie takes
odds on all bets, he has a cer
tain profit if the betting is even
— assuming no push. For in
stance, if a typical bookie with
11-10 odds winds up covering
$3000 each way on a game, he
gains a $300 profit either way.
He really could care less if the
favorite loses by three
touchdowns and makes his
line look bad.
If, on the other hand, he has
to cover $5000 one way to just
$1000 the other, he will most
likely be very agitated come
game time. Should he lose the
$5000, to tell him that at least
the favorite won the game
would allow him little solace.
The test of an oddsmaker's
skill is not how many of his
favorites win, but whether or
not the bookies win. Bad point
spreads make things too easy
for the bettors. They can con
centrate their money on a team
that's not given enough of a
handicap — or against one with
too much of a handicap — and
the bookies can take a bath.
Tied in with the outlook that
oddsmakers aren't doing their
job if favorites lose is a some
what mysterious belief that on
such a weekend the bookies
must necessarily take a beat
ing. I've encountered this
many times, with people offer
ing me their sympathies after a
bad weekend for favorites, but
there's actually no basis for
such a conclusion.
Knowing which teams beat
their spreads tells a person no
thing about which teams the
bettors had bet on. The fact is
that in my own experience a
weekend in which favorites get
whipped is usually a very pro
fitable weekend for me, be
cause there is a tendency for
people to bet on favorites
more often than they bet on
underdogs.
It's tendencies such as this
that allow a smart bettor to find
an edge, because any common
betting tendencies must

necessarily be reflected in the
point spreads.
Let me use the example of
the tendency to bet on favo
rites, and examine the possible
action on a particular game.
Say Dallas is playing at New
York against the Giants, where
an accurate prediction of the
outcome might be Dallas by 8.
Because of the tendency to bet
on favorites, the spread might
have to be pushed up to 11 to
keep the betting even. This
gives someone betting on the
Giants a few free points and
hence a better that even
chance of winning.
Betting on underdogs this
way can often be profitable.
Indeed, through the first few
weeks of the current NFL sea
son underdogs have beaten
the spread around 60 percent
of the time, with home under
dogs being particularly suc
cessful.
Another example of a way to
bet against tendencies is to bet
against so called "public
teams," teams with a large na
tional following. Examples of
such teams are Green Bay, at
least in their glory years, Notre
Dame and Dallas. Notre Dame
fans probably lurk behind
every bush in the Midwest, and
a lot of them like to back their
sentiments with their money.

Someone betting against the
Irish often gets a couple of
extra points just as would the
bettor going against Dallas in
the earlier example.
If you want to bet on Notre
Dame, do it early in the week
before the Irish money has a
chance to force the spread up.
By the same token, if you want
to bet against Notre Dame, you
might get more points if you
wait until later in the week.
Finally, I'll briefly describe
parlays. A parlay is a combina
tion of two or more teams
which the bettor combines
into a single bet. If any one of
his teams loses to the spread,
he loses his money. But if all of
his teams win versus the
spread he receives a payoff
which depends on how many
teams were in the parlay and
on what the odds of the par
ticular bookie happen to be.
I, for instance, odds
on a three-team parlay and 7-1
on a four-teamer. So a $5 four
teamer that wins would pay
$35.
Well, I've pretty much co
vered the basic mechanics of
the betting game now, and
even armed you with a couple
of tips, so go out and place
your bets. Don't worry, my bet
ting tips are better than my
Pac-10 predictions.
