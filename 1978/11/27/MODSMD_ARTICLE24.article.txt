# Belton leads Cards with 26
## Cagers down Pomona, 89-75 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Lacking nothing in intensity
but something in execution,
the Cardinals began their
1978-79 basketball season
Saturday night in winning fash
ion with an 89-75 decision over
visiting Cal Poly-Pomona.
Offensively, Stanford dis
played smoothness, variety
and balance. Led by senior
guard Paul Giovacchini, the
Cards maintained continuity in
their offensive patterns from
start to finish, taking mostly
good shots and committing
just 11 turnovers.
However, the Cards' glaring
defensive, rebounding and
free-throw shooting deficien
cies left Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso feeling anything but
triumphant.
All too often and easily the
Broncos found openings in
Stanford's defense for an un
contested shot. Frequently
those shots were missed —
Pomona made just 27 percent
of its attempts in the first half
and 37 overall — but the Bron
cos usually grabbed the ensu
ing rebound. Their 31-18 first
half rebounding edge was the
main reason why Stanford held
only a 35-30 lead at intermis
sion.
"We played a lot of zone be
cause our man-to-man was so
lousy," said Dißiaso, explain
ing why the Cards resorted
mostly to 2-3 and 2-1-2 zone
alignments. "Hunter
(Broderick Hunter, who
finished with 17 points) was
sticking it all night, breaking
out from the low post without
being guarded."
The Cards managed just two
offensive rebounds in the first
half, and failure to execute the
fundamentals caused the prob
lems on both boards, Dißiaso
said.
"We didn't box out, which is
something we have been work
ing on in practice," he said.
"Offensively, we were not in
good position to get the ball.
(Brian) Welch didn't crash from
the wing — we weren't near
the ball at all in the first half."
The Cards' poor free-throw
shooting (7-of-15) also dis
pleased Dißiaso. Stanford shot
better from the floor, making
41 of 73 attempts for 56 per
cent.
Nervous exhaustion due to
opening-night jitters might
have plagued Stanford. "We
were a little tired," said Di-
Biaso. "Everybody was 'juiced'
for the first game."
Yet the Cards did win, and at
least one observer was impre
ssed by what he saw.
"Stanford played better
against us than Cal did," said
Pomona coach Don Hogan,
whose team lost Friday night to
Berkeley, 73-52. "From the
start Stanford played at a high

level of intensity."
Particularly impressive in the
early going were center Tom
Schmalzried and forward Brian
Welch.
Schmalzried, a 6-foot-11
junior, dominated the action
around the basket, snuffing a
couple of Pomona scoring op
portunities with blocked shots
and getting at least a hand on
the ball on every contested re
bound.
As for Welch, it was impossi
ble to tell he was playing his
first college game. The 6-foot-7
freshman coolly hit his first
four shots, three of them long
jumpers, to help the Cards to a
20-10 lead. He finished with 13
points on six-for-nine shoot
ing.
"It was just great," Welsh
said happily of his indoctrina
tion. "It's a big difference from
high school, especially under
the boards."
Welch, who showed no tre
pidation in his shooting, knew
before the game he would
have chances at the hoop. "I'm
confident with my outside
shot," he said. "I saw in the
films that those shots from the
wing would be open."
Soon after blocking his
fourth and final shot, Schmal
zried committed his third foul
with 4:52 remaining in the first

half, and went to the bench
with Stanford holding a 29-20
advantage.
"I committed stupid fouls,"
Schmalzried said. "At the be
ginning, I was going after a lot
of balls. With three fouls I be
came overcautious; with time
I'll be able to gauge my play
more so fouls won't affect me
as much."
Pomona then seized the op
portunity to capitalize on the
Card big man's absence, slic
ing the margin to 41-38 on
Hunter's third basket in a row
with three minutes gone in the
second half.
Seconds later forward Cleve
Porter, who led the Broncos
with 19 points, was driving fora
fast-break tally that would have
brought Pomona within one.
But Porter missed the easy
lay-in, and Kimberly Belton's
follow shot and jeff Ryan's
short jumper put Stanford up
45-38, vanquishing the Bron
cos' challenge.
"The game was a sequence
of peaks and valleys — we were
in it and out of it,' said Hogan.
"We stayed a little longer in the
valleys than we wanted to."
With Belton rejuvenating
himself after an unimpressive
first half (three points, three
rebounds), Pomona was
forced to stay in Death Valley.

Stanford's muscular 6-foot-7
forward scored 23 of his
game-high 26 points after in
termission, hitting 12 of 20
shots overall on an assortment
of tips and lay-ins. He also top
ped all rebounders, collecting
12 boards.
Belton's first second-half
basket, a loop-the-loop re
verse layup enthralling the
3478 spectators, signalled that
he was once again animated
and agile.
"The first half was like a
test," Belton said. "They were
trapping us in the zone, and we
weren't geared for that. It took
a while for me to get warmed
up, but I felt much quicker in
the second half."
Nine straight points from
Belton and hoops from guard
Wolfe Perry and Welch ex
tended Stanford's bulge to
82-67 with 3:30 left and settled
matters.
Three Cards besides Belton
and Welch scored in double fi
gures. Perry shot consistently
from the perimeters and
finished with nine-for-20 from
the floor and 19 points, despite
having two shots pop in and
out.
"We've got new rims up here
— I've gotta get used to them,"
Perry joked.
Ryan came off the bench to
pour in 12 points, all in the sec
ond half. Ciovacchini, the
team captain who owns the re
sponsibility of running the of
fense, sank five of six bombs
for 11 points and dished off 10
assists.
Reserve guards Terry Smith
and Mark Pitchford did not suit
up due to injury. Smith suf
fered a stress fracture in his
right foot last Thursday, and
Pitchford is still bothered by
back troubles.
Stanford resumes the season
tonight against San jose State,
which lost to Cal 77-66 on
Saturday.

sticking it all night, breaking
out from the low post without
being guarded."
The Cards managed just two
offensive rebounds in the first
half, and failure to execute the
fundamentals caused the prob
lems on both boards, Dißiaso
said.
"We didn't box out, which is
something we have been work
ing on in practice," he said.
"Offensively, we were not in
good position to get the ball.
(Brian) Welch didn't crash from
the wing — we weren't near
the ball at all in the first half."
The Cards' poor free-throw
shooting (7-of-15) also dis
pleased Dißiaso. Stanford shot
better from the floor, making
41 of 73 attempts for 56 per
cent.
Nervous exhaustion due to
opening-night jitters might
have plagued Stanford. "We
were a little tired," said Di-
Biaso. "Everybody was 'juiced'
for the first game."
Yet the Cards did win, and at
least one observer was impre
ssed by what he saw.
"Stanford played better
against us than Cal did," said
Pomona coach Don Hogan,
whose team lost Friday night to
Berkeley, 73-52. "From the
start Stanford played at a high

level of intensity."
Particularly impressive in the
early going were center Tom
Schmalzried and forward Brian
Welch.
Schmalzried, a 6-foot-11
junior, dominated the action
around the basket, snuffing a
couple of Pomona scoring op
portunities with blocked shots
and getting at least a hand on
the ball on every contested re
bound.
As for Welch, it was impossi
ble to tell he was playing his
first college game. The 6-foot-7
freshman coolly hit his first
four shots, three of them long
jumpers, to help the Cards to a
20-10 lead. He finished with 13
points on six-for-nine shoot
ing.
"It was just great," Welsh
said happily of his indoctrina
tion. "It's a big difference from
high school, especially under
the boards."
Welch, who showed no tre
pidation in his shooting, knew
before the game he would
have chances at the hoop. "I'm
confident with my outside
shot," he said. "I saw in the
films that those shots from the
wing would be open."
Soon after blocking his
fourth and final shot, Schmal
zried committed his third foul
with 4:52 remaining in the first

half, and went to the bench
with Stanford holding a 29-20
advantage.
"I committed stupid fouls,"
Schmalzried said. "At the be
ginning, I was going after a lot
of balls. With three fouls I be
came overcautious; with time
I'll be able to gauge my play
more so fouls won't affect me
as much."
Pomona then seized the op
portunity to capitalize on the
Card big man's absence, slic
ing the margin to 41-38 on
Hunter's third basket in a row
with three minutes gone in the
second half.
Seconds later forward Cleve
Porter, who led the Broncos
with 19 points, was driving fora
fast-break tally that would have
brought Pomona within one.
But Porter missed the easy
lay-in, and Kimberly Belton's
follow shot and jeff Ryan's
short jumper put Stanford up
45-38, vanquishing the Bron
cos' challenge.
"The game was a sequence
of peaks and valleys — we were
in it and out of it,' said Hogan.
"We stayed a little longer in the
valleys than we wanted to."
With Belton rejuvenating
himself after an unimpressive
first half (three points, three
rebounds), Pomona was
forced to stay in Death Valley.

Stanford's muscular 6-foot-7
forward scored 23 of his
game-high 26 points after in
termission, hitting 12 of 20
shots overall on an assortment
of tips and lay-ins. He also top
ped all rebounders, collecting
12 boards.
Belton's first second-half
basket, a loop-the-loop re
verse layup enthralling the
3478 spectators, signalled that
he was once again animated
and agile.
"The first half was like a
test," Belton said. "They were
trapping us in the zone, and we
weren't geared for that. It took
a while for me to get warmed
up, but I felt much quicker in
the second half."
Nine straight points from
Belton and hoops from guard
Wolfe Perry and Welch ex
tended Stanford's bulge to
82-67 with 3:30 left and settled
matters.
Three Cards besides Belton
and Welch scored in double fi
gures. Perry shot consistently
from the perimeters and
finished with nine-for-20 from
the floor and 19 points, despite
having two shots pop in and
out.
"We've got new rims up here
— I've gotta get used to them,"
Perry joked.
Ryan came off the bench to
pour in 12 points, all in the sec
ond half. Ciovacchini, the
team captain who owns the re
sponsibility of running the of
fense, sank five of six bombs
for 11 points and dished off 10
assists.
Reserve guards Terry Smith
and Mark Pitchford did not suit
up due to injury. Smith suf
fered a stress fracture in his
right foot last Thursday, and
Pitchford is still bothered by
back troubles.
Stanford resumes the season
tonight against San jose State,
which lost to Cal 77-66 on
Saturday.

Senior guard Wolfe Perry (21) uncorks a jumper over the hands of Pomona guard Geoff Worley (32)
during Stanford's 89-75 season opening victory Saturday. Perry had 19 points and four rebounds against
the Broncos.
Lacking nothing in intensity
but something in execution,
the Cardinals began their
1978-79 basketball season
Saturday night in winning fash
ion with an 89-75 decision over
visiting Cal Poly-Pomona.
Offensively, Stanford dis
played smoothness, variety
and balance. Led by senior
guard Paul Giovacchini, the
Cards maintained continuity in
their offensive patterns from
start to finish, taking mostly
good shots and committing
just 11 turnovers.
However, the Cards' glaring
defensive, rebounding and
free-throw shooting deficien
cies left Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso feeling anything but
triumphant.
All too often and easily the
Broncos found openings in
Stanford's defense for an un
contested shot. Frequently
those shots were missed —
Pomona made just 27 percent
of its attempts in the first half
and 37 overall — but the Bron
cos usually grabbed the ensu
ing rebound. Their 31-18 first
half rebounding edge was the
main reason why Stanford held
only a 35-30 lead at intermis
sion.
"We played a lot of zone be
cause our man-to-man was so
lousy," said Dißiaso, explain
ing why the Cards resorted
mostly to 2-3 and 2-1-2 zone
alignments. "Hunter
(Broderick Hunter, who
finished with 17 points) was

junior, dominated the action
around the basket, snuffing a
couple of Pomona scoring op
portunities with blocked shots
and getting at least a hand on
the ball on every contested re
bound.
As for Welch, it was impossi
ble to tell he was playing his
first college game. The 6-foot-7
freshman coolly hit his first
four shots, three of them long
jumpers, to help the Cards to a
20-10 lead. He finished with 13
points on six-for-nine shoot
ing.
"It was just great," Welsh
said happily of his indoctrina
tion. "It's a big difference from
high school, especially under
the boards."
Welch, who showed no tre
pidation in his shooting, knew
before the game he would
have chances at the hoop. "I'm
confident with my outside
shot," he said. "I saw in the
films that those shots from the
wing would be open."
Soon after blocking his
fourth and final shot, Schmal
zried committed his third foul
with 4:52 remaining in the first

half, and went to the bench
with Stanford holding a 29-20
advantage.
"I committed stupid fouls,"
Schmalzried said. "At the be
ginning, I was going after a lot
of balls. With three fouls I be
came overcautious; with time
I'll be able to gauge my play
more so fouls won't affect me
as much."
Pomona then seized the op
portunity to capitalize on the
Card big man's absence, slic
ing the margin to 41-38 on
Hunter's third basket in a row
with three minutes gone in the
second half.
Seconds later forward Cleve
Porter, who led the Broncos
with 19 points, was driving fora
fast-break tally that would have
brought Pomona within one.
But Porter missed the easy
lay-in, and Kimberly Belton's
follow shot and jeff Ryan's
short jumper put Stanford up
45-38, vanquishing the Bron
cos' challenge.
"The game was a sequence
of peaks and valleys — we were
in it and out of it,' said Hogan.
"We stayed a little longer in the
valleys than we wanted to."
With Belton rejuvenating
himself after an unimpressive
first half (three points, three
rebounds), Pomona was
forced to stay in Death Valley.

Stanford's muscular 6-foot-7
forward scored 23 of his
game-high 26 points after in
termission, hitting 12 of 20
shots overall on an assortment
of tips and lay-ins. He also top
ped all rebounders, collecting
12 boards.
Belton's first second-half
basket, a loop-the-loop re
verse layup enthralling the
3478 spectators, signalled that
he was once again animated
and agile.
"The first half was like a
test," Belton said. "They were
trapping us in the zone, and we
weren't geared for that. It took
a while for me to get warmed
up, but I felt much quicker in
the second half."
Nine straight points from
Belton and hoops from guard
Wolfe Perry and Welch ex
tended Stanford's bulge to
82-67 with 3:30 left and settled
matters.
Three Cards besides Belton
and Welch scored in double fi
gures. Perry shot consistently
from the perimeters and
finished with nine-for-20 from
the floor and 19 points, despite
having two shots pop in and
out.
"We've got new rims up here
— I've gotta get used to them,"
Perry joked.
Ryan came off the bench to
pour in 12 points, all in the sec
ond half. Ciovacchini, the
team captain who owns the re
sponsibility of running the of
fense, sank five of six bombs
for 11 points and dished off 10
assists.
Reserve guards Terry Smith
and Mark Pitchford did not suit
up due to injury. Smith suf
fered a stress fracture in his
right foot last Thursday, and
Pitchford is still bothered by
back troubles.
Stanford resumes the season
tonight against San jose State,
which lost to Cal 77-66 on
Saturday.

Senior guard Wolfe Perry (21) uncorks a jumper over the hands of Pomona guard Geoff Worley (32)
during Stanford's 89-75 season opening victory Saturday. Perry had 19 points and four rebounds against
the Broncos.
Lacking nothing in intensity
but something in execution,
the Cardinals began their
1978-79 basketball season
Saturday night in winning fash
ion with an 89-75 decision over
visiting Cal Poly-Pomona.
Offensively, Stanford dis
played smoothness, variety
and balance. Led by senior
guard Paul Giovacchini, the
Cards maintained continuity in
their offensive patterns from
start to finish, taking mostly
good shots and committing
just 11 turnovers.
However, the Cards' glaring
defensive, rebounding and
free-throw shooting deficien
cies left Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso feeling anything but
triumphant.
All too often and easily the
Broncos found openings in
Stanford's defense for an un
contested shot. Frequently
those shots were missed —
Pomona made just 27 percent
of its attempts in the first half
and 37 overall — but the Bron
cos usually grabbed the ensu
ing rebound. Their 31-18 first
half rebounding edge was the
main reason why Stanford held
only a 35-30 lead at intermis
sion.
"We played a lot of zone be
cause our man-to-man was so
lousy," said Dißiaso, explain
ing why the Cards resorted
mostly to 2-3 and 2-1-2 zone
alignments. "Hunter
(Broderick Hunter, who
finished with 17 points) was
sticking it all night, breaking
out from the low post without
being guarded."
The Cards managed just two
offensive rebounds in the first
half, and failure to execute the
fundamentals caused the prob
lems on both boards, Dißiaso
said.
"We didn't box out, which is
something we have been work
ing on in practice," he said.
"Offensively, we were not in
good position to get the ball.
(Brian) Welch didn't crash from
the wing — we weren't near
the ball at all in the first half."
The Cards' poor free-throw
shooting (7-of-15) also dis
pleased Dißiaso. Stanford shot
better from the floor, making
41 of 73 attempts for 56 per
cent.
Nervous exhaustion due to
opening-night jitters might
have plagued Stanford. "We
were a little tired," said Di-
Biaso. "Everybody was 'juiced'
for the first game."
Yet the Cards did win, and at
least one observer was impre
ssed by what he saw.
"Stanford played better
against us than Cal did," said
Pomona coach Don Hogan,
whose team lost Friday night to
Berkeley, 73-52. "From the
start Stanford played at a high

level of intensity."
Particularly impressive in the
early going were center Tom
Schmalzried and forward Brian
Welch.

as much."
Pomona then seized the op
portunity to capitalize on the
Card big man's absence, slic
ing the margin to 41-38 on
Hunter's third basket in a row
with three minutes gone in the
second half.
Seconds later forward Cleve
Porter, who led the Broncos
with 19 points, was driving fora
fast-break tally that would have
brought Pomona within one.
But Porter missed the easy
lay-in, and Kimberly Belton's
follow shot and jeff Ryan's
short jumper put Stanford up
45-38, vanquishing the Bron
cos' challenge.
"The game was a sequence
of peaks and valleys — we were
in it and out of it,' said Hogan.
"We stayed a little longer in the
valleys than we wanted to."
With Belton rejuvenating
himself after an unimpressive
first half (three points, three
rebounds), Pomona was
forced to stay in Death Valley.

Stanford's muscular 6-foot-7
forward scored 23 of his
game-high 26 points after in
termission, hitting 12 of 20
shots overall on an assortment
of tips and lay-ins. He also top
ped all rebounders, collecting
12 boards.
Belton's first second-half
basket, a loop-the-loop re
verse layup enthralling the
3478 spectators, signalled that
he was once again animated
and agile.
"The first half was like a
test," Belton said. "They were
trapping us in the zone, and we
weren't geared for that. It took
a while for me to get warmed
up, but I felt much quicker in
the second half."
Nine straight points from
Belton and hoops from guard
Wolfe Perry and Welch ex
tended Stanford's bulge to
82-67 with 3:30 left and settled
matters.
Three Cards besides Belton
and Welch scored in double fi
gures. Perry shot consistently
from the perimeters and
finished with nine-for-20 from
the floor and 19 points, despite
having two shots pop in and
out.
"We've got new rims up here
— I've gotta get used to them,"
Perry joked.
Ryan came off the bench to
pour in 12 points, all in the sec
ond half. Ciovacchini, the
team captain who owns the re
sponsibility of running the of
fense, sank five of six bombs
for 11 points and dished off 10
assists.
Reserve guards Terry Smith
and Mark Pitchford did not suit
up due to injury. Smith suf
fered a stress fracture in his
right foot last Thursday, and
Pitchford is still bothered by
back troubles.
Stanford resumes the season
tonight against San jose State,
which lost to Cal 77-66 on
Saturday.
