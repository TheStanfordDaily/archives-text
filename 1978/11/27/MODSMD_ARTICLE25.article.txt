# Long Beach St. rally snuffs Card spikers' regional aspirations
## 
### PETER FINCH 
The season is now over for the Stanford women's vol
leyball team. The Cards took their last shot at a berth in the
regional playoffs Thursday night against Long Beach State,
but came up short in a five-game match.
Although they lost on Thanksgiving, the Cardinals could
hardly have been mistaken for turkeys. The match was close
all the way, with the Cards going down, 13-15, 15-13, 15-9,
6-15, and 10-15.
"This was a tough match to lose," said Stanford coach Fred
Sturm. "The girls were pretty disappointed. We really
wanted that spot in the regionals. Long Beach played very
well, though. They made no mental errors in that final
game."
According to Sturm, seniors Liz Hughes and Shawn
Hoover, playing the last match of their Stanford careers, put
in excellent performances.
"It really was typical of the way they played all year," Sturm
said. "They have led this team all through the season." Sturm
added that freshman Jan Linden played another fine match at
the net.
The Cards have met the tough Long Beach team twice
earlier in the season. Their first meeting was at the San Jose
State Tournament where Long Beach won in three games.
Their next meeting was at the UCLA Tournament, where they
split a two-game match. The Cards were given the victory on
the basis of points won and lost.
This time the Cardinals succumbed to a fatal 49er com
eback, the Long Beach rally terminating their season. The
Cards finished the year with a 9-3 mark in NCAC play, a 13-7-1
record overall.
