# Legislators to discuss medical school billing
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior Staff writer 
Should private medical schools bill
patients for services rendered? Can
faculty physicians bill patients and
then turn those fees over to the med
ical school institution? Are Stanford,
USC and Loma Linda all in violation
of the California Business Code?
These are some of the many ques
tions the California legislature will be
analyzing Wednesday as medical
school administrators and various
other factions argue the corporate
practice of medicine issue in San
Francisco.
The legislative hearing is being
spurred on by Assemblyman Gordon
Duffy (R-Hanford), who has intro
duced an amendment which
would make it legal for a private
non-profit medical school to charge

professional fees for services re
ndered to patients by faculty physi
cians.

News analysis

Although Stanford, USC and Loma
Lindaall followthis billing procedure
now, the Board of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA) has been inves
tigating its legality.
Major problems
Major problems arose last year
when the Union of American Physi
cians (UAP) and some individual doc
tors discovered that Section 2008 of
the California Business Code states
that medical schools and institutions
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered to pa
tients."
But administrators here do not

think Stanford is billing illegally.
"The regulation was never meant
to apply to the private medical
schools in California," Larry Horton
of the government relations office
here said. "The public policy of the
state is to provide good medical care
and to avoid the so-called 'fast-food'
medical care which might have re
sulted had this law not been made."
Horton added that University of
California schools bill the same way
as private medical schools. But no
question has been raised there, he
added, because UC schools answer
directly to the California State Con
stitution which supersedes the busi
ness code. There is no Constitution
provision which is similar to Section
2008.
University administrators are also
convinced Stanford is not in violation

simply because the Medical School
does not do the billing. Horton said
the University sends out bills on be
half of the faculty physicians who au
tomatically turn over collected fees
to the University since they receive
faculty salaries. So although the Uni
versity ends up with the money, the
institution does not technically do
the billing.
Consequences
If legislators refuse to pass Duffy's
amendment and decide the private
medical schools are in violation of
the business code, what will be the
consequences?
"We'll simply have to change our
billing procedures," Horton said.
"There are a number of various plans
we can change to, but all would be
expensive moves. If there's any way
