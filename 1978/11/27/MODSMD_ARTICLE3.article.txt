# Legislators to discuss medical school billing
## 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior Staff writer 
Should private medical schools bill
patients for services rendered? Can
faculty physicians bill patients and
then turn those fees over to the med
ical school institution? Are Stanford,
USC and Loma Linda all in violation
of the California Business Code?
These are some of the many ques
tions the California legislature will be
analyzing Wednesday as medical
school administrators and various
other factions argue the corporate
practice of medicine issue in San
Francisco.
The legislative hearing is being
spurred on by Assemblyman Gordon
Duffy (R-Hanford), who has intro
duced an amendment which
would make it legal for a private
non-profit medical school to charge

professional fees for services re
ndered to patients by faculty physi
cians.

News analysis

Although Stanford, USC and Loma
Lindaall followthis billing procedure
now, the Board of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA) has been inves
tigating its legality.
Major problems
Major problems arose last year
when the Union of American Physi
cians (UAP) and some individual doc
tors discovered that Section 2008 of
the California Business Code states
that medical schools and institutions
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered to pa
tients."
But administrators here do not

think Stanford is billing illegally.
"The regulation was never meant
to apply to the private medical
schools in California," Larry Horton
of the government relations office
here said. "The public policy of the
state is to provide good medical care
and to avoid the so-called 'fast-food'
medical care which might have re
sulted had this law not been made."
Horton added that University of
California schools bill the same way
as private medical schools. But no
question has been raised there, he
added, because UC schools answer
directly to the California State Con
stitution which supersedes the busi
ness code. There is no Constitution
provision which is similar to Section
2008.
University administrators are also
convinced Stanford is not in violation

simply because the Medical School
does not do the billing. Horton said
the University sends out bills on be
half of the faculty physicians who au
tomatically turn over collected fees
to the University since they receive
faculty salaries. So although the Uni
versity ends up with the money, the
institution does not technically do
the billing.
Consequences
If legislators refuse to pass Duffy's
amendment and decide the private
medical schools are in violation of
the business code, what will be the
consequences?
"We'll simply have to change our
billing procedures," Horton said.
"There are a number of various plans
we can change to, but all would be
expensive moves. If there's any way
to avoid it, we will."
ButHorton added that the Medical
School still I must receive fees from
patients.
"There's no place in the country
which is going to give free services,"
he said. "That's why this 2008 issue is
so important; it's got to be solved.
The BMQA investigation began last
year after the UAP and Stanford's As
soc. Prof, of Cardiovascular Surgery
Dr. Eugene Dong, questioned the
University's compliance with Section
2008.
But since then, allegations of con
flicting interest have colored the in
vestigation. The executive director of
BMQA, Robert Rowland, is a Stan
ford graduate, a former Stanford
employee, and the son of a former
Stanford business manager, William
Rowland.
This conflict has led Dr. Robert
Weinmann, president of UAP, to ask
the California Senate and the Attor
ney General to "look over BMQA's
shoulder" during the investigation.
Objectivity questioned
Weinmann has also questioned
BMQA's objectivity because two
members of the division licensing
board are Stanford faculty.
His concerns may be justified. Last
month, while it was still conducting
its investigation, BMQA's division of
licensing voted to recommend that
the executive board come out in
favor of Duffy's amendment.
Although the two Stanford faculty
abstained from the vote, voting pro
cedures were still questionable. Orig
inally, a third board member, Lewis
Simpson, also abstained, saying he

didn't have enough information on
the subject. Voting was sub
sequently tabled due to a lack of
quorum.
But after a short break, moments
later the issue was reopened and
Simpson voted in favor of the re
commendation. The motion passes,
4-0 with two abstentions.
Rowland, who was at this Oct. 17
meeting, denied talking with Lewis
during the break.
Rowland also denies any conflict of
interest.
"I'm a big boy now," he said. "I
have fond feelings for the University,
but the family ties have to be distinct
from my professional responsibil
ity."
Other issues
The corporate practice of
medicine issue has often been con
fused with other billing problems at
the Medical School, Horton claims.
The so-called double billing con
troversy is in no way connected with
the corporate practice issue, he says.
"The 2008 question involves
whether the Medical School can bill
anyone for anything," he explained.
"Double billing involves how the
medical school bills.
Hence, "if it is wrong today to en
gage in the alleged double billing, it
would still be wrong if Duffy's
amendment passes," he said.
Double billing is the practice of fa
culty physicians billing for services
when they have not seen the patient
but have advised the resident who
served as the patient's doctor. Med
iCal is currently investigating allega
tions that Stanford engages in this
practice.

members of the division licensing
board are Stanford faculty.
His concerns may be justified. Last
month, while it was still conducting
its investigation, BMQA's division of
licensing voted to recommend that
the executive board come out in
favor of Duffy's amendment.
Although the two Stanford faculty
abstained from the vote, voting pro
cedures were still questionable. Orig
inally, a third board member, Lewis
Simpson, also abstained, saying he

didn't have enough information on
the subject. Voting was sub
sequently tabled due to a lack of
quorum.
But after a short break, moments
later the issue was reopened and
Simpson voted in favor of the re
commendation. The motion passes,
4-0 with two abstentions.
Rowland, who was at this Oct. 17
meeting, denied talking with Lewis
during the break.
Rowland also denies any conflict of
interest.
"I'm a big boy now," he said. "I
have fond feelings for the University,

from my professional responsibil

Other issues
The corporate practice of
medicine issue has often been con
fused with other billing problems at
the Medical School, Horton claims.
The so-called double billing con
troversy is in no way connected with
the corporate practice issue, he says.
"The 2008 question involves
whether the Medical School can bill
anyone for anything," he explained.
"Double billing involves how the
medical school bills.
Hence, "if it is wrong today to en
gage in the alleged double billing, it
would still be wrong if Duffy's
amendment passes," he said.
Double billing is the practice of fa
culty physicians billing for services
when they have not seen the patient
but have advised the resident who
served as the patient's doctor. Med
iCal is currently investigating allega
tions that Stanford engages in this
practice.
Should private medical schools bill
patients for services rendered? Can
faculty physicians bill patients and
then turn those fees over to the med
ical school institution? Are Stanford,
USC and Loma Linda all in violation
of the California Business Code?
These are some of the many ques
tions the California legislature will be
analyzing Wednesday as medical
school administrators and various
other factions argue the corporate
practice of medicine issue in San
Francisco.
The legislative hearing is being
spurred on by Assemblyman Gordon
Duffy (R-Hanford), who has intro
duced an amendment which
would make it legal for a private
non-profit medical school to charge

professional fees for services re
ndered to patients by faculty physi
cians.

News analysis

Although Stanford, USC and Loma
Lindaall followthis billing procedure
now, the Board of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA) has been inves
tigating its legality.
Major problems
Major problems arose last year
when the Union of American Physi
cians (UAP) and some individual doc
tors discovered that Section 2008 of
the California Business Code states
that medical schools and institutions
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered to pa
tients."
But administrators here do not

think Stanford is billing illegally.
"The regulation was never meant
to apply to the private medical
schools in California," Larry Horton
of the government relations office
here said. "The public policy of the
state is to provide good medical care
and to avoid the so-called 'fast-food'
medical care which might have re
sulted had this law not been made."
Horton added that University of
California schools bill the same way
as private medical schools. But no
question has been raised there, he
added, because UC schools answer
directly to the California State Con
stitution which supersedes the busi
ness code. There is no Constitution
provision which is similar to Section
2008.
University administrators are also
convinced Stanford is not in violation

simply because the Medical School
does not do the billing. Horton said
the University sends out bills on be
half of the faculty physicians who au
tomatically turn over collected fees
to the University since they receive
faculty salaries. So although the Uni
versity ends up with the money, the
institution does not technically do
the billing.
Consequences
If legislators refuse to pass Duffy's
amendment and decide the private
medical schools are in violation of
the business code, what will be the
consequences?
"We'll simply have to change our
billing procedures," Horton said.
"There are a number of various plans
we can change to, but all would be
expensive moves. If there's any way
to avoid it, we will."
ButHorton added that the Medical
School still I must receive fees from
patients.
"There's no place in the country
which is going to give free services,"
he said. "That's why this 2008 issue is
so important; it's got to be solved.

provision which is similar to Section
2008.
University administrators are also
convinced Stanford is not in violation

simply because the Medical School
does not do the billing. Horton said
the University sends out bills on be
half of the faculty physicians who au
tomatically turn over collected fees
to the University since they receive
faculty salaries. So although the Uni
versity ends up with the money, the
institution does not technically do
the billing.
Consequences
If legislators refuse to pass Duffy's
amendment and decide the private
medical schools are in violation of
the business code, what will be the
consequences?
"We'll simply have to change our
billing procedures," Horton said.
"There are a number of various plans
we can change to, but all would be
expensive moves. If there's any way
to avoid it, we will."
ButHorton added that the Medical
School still I must receive fees from
patients.
"There's no place in the country

The BMQA investigation began last
year after the UAP and Stanford's As
soc. Prof, of Cardiovascular Surgery
Dr. Eugene Dong, questioned the
University's compliance with Section
2008.
But since then, allegations of con
flicting interest have colored the in
vestigation. The executive director of
BMQA, Robert Rowland, is a Stan
ford graduate, a former Stanford
employee, and the son of a former
Stanford business manager, William
Rowland.
This conflict has led Dr. Robert
Weinmann, president of UAP, to ask
the California Senate and the Attor
ney General to "look over BMQA's
shoulder" during the investigation.
Objectivity questioned
Weinmann has also questioned
BMQA's objectivity because two
members of the division licensing
board are Stanford faculty.
His concerns may be justified. Last
month, while it was still conducting
its investigation, BMQA's division of
licensing voted to recommend that
the executive board come out in
favor of Duffy's amendment.
Although the two Stanford faculty
abstained from the vote, voting pro
cedures were still questionable. Orig
inally, a third board member, Lewis
Simpson, also abstained, saying he

didn't have enough information on
the subject. Voting was sub
sequently tabled due to a lack of
quorum.
But after a short break, moments
later the issue was reopened and
Simpson voted in favor of the re
commendation. The motion passes,
4-0 with two abstentions.
Rowland, who was at this Oct. 17
meeting, denied talking with Lewis
during the break.
Rowland also denies any conflict of
interest.
"I'm a big boy now," he said. "I
have fond feelings for the University,
but the family ties have to be distinct
from my professional responsibil
ity."
Other issues
The corporate practice of
medicine issue has often been con
fused with other billing problems at
the Medical School, Horton claims.
The so-called double billing con
troversy is in no way connected with
the corporate practice issue, he says.
"The 2008 question involves
whether the Medical School can bill
anyone for anything," he explained.
"Double billing involves how the
medical school bills.
Hence, "if it is wrong today to en
gage in the alleged double billing, it
would still be wrong if Duffy's
amendment passes," he said.
Double billing is the practice of fa
culty physicians billing for services
when they have not seen the patient
but have advised the resident who
served as the patient's doctor. Med
iCal is currently investigating allega
tions that Stanford engages in this
practice.
Should private medical schools bill
patients for services rendered? Can
faculty physicians bill patients and
then turn those fees over to the med
ical school institution? Are Stanford,
USC and Loma Linda all in violation
of the California Business Code?
These are some of the many ques
tions the California legislature will be
analyzing Wednesday as medical
school administrators and various
other factions argue the corporate
practice of medicine issue in San
Francisco.
The legislative hearing is being
spurred on by Assemblyman Gordon
Duffy (R-Hanford), who has intro
duced an amendment which
would make it legal for a private
non-profit medical school to charge

professional fees for services re
ndered to patients by faculty physi
cians.

News analysis

Although Stanford, USC and Loma
Lindaall followthis billing procedure
now, the Board of Medical Quality
Assurance (BMQA) has been inves
tigating its legality.
Major problems
Major problems arose last year
when the Union of American Physi
cians (UAP) and some individual doc
tors discovered that Section 2008 of
the California Business Code states
that medical schools and institutions
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered to pa
tients."
But administrators here do not

think Stanford is billing illegally.
"The regulation was never meant
to apply to the private medical
schools in California," Larry Horton
of the government relations office
here said. "The public policy of the
state is to provide good medical care
and to avoid the so-called 'fast-food'
medical care which might have re
sulted had this law not been made."
Horton added that University of
California schools bill the same way
as private medical schools. But no
question has been raised there, he
added, because UC schools answer
directly to the California State Con
stitution which supersedes the busi
ness code. There is no Constitution
provision which is similar to Section
2008.
University administrators are also
convinced Stanford is not in violation

simply because the Medical School
does not do the billing. Horton said
the University sends out bills on be
half of the faculty physicians who au
tomatically turn over collected fees
to the University since they receive
