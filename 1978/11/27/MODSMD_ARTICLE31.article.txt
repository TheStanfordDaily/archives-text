Sadat expects treaty to be signed
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat said yes
terday he believes Egypt and Israel will sign a
peace treaty "sooner or later" despite the current
deadlock in the Washington negotiations.
"There are problems and it will take time but
that does not mean I am pessimistic, not at all,"
Sadat told reporters. "Sooner or later we shall be
signing an agreement. This is a fact."
But in Israel the state radio said Prime Minister
Menachem Begin reaffirmed Israel's position in a
Cabinet meeting yesterday that there is no reason
to send negotiators back to Washington at this
point.
Government spokesman Arieh Naor said Israel
was awaiting Egypt's reply to the Israeli Cabinet's
decision last Tuesday rejecting Sadat's proposal
that a timetable for Palestinian self-rule in the West
Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip be
included in the peace treaty.
Sadat has ordered a top-level committee to reas
sess the Egyptian position in the negotiations in
light of the Israeli decision.
Iranians strike against the shah
Tehran, Iran — A general strike called by Moslem
religious leaders and politicians who want to top
ple the beleaguered Shah of Iran virtually shut
down this strife-torn country yesterday, and new
anti-shah violence erupted in the provinces.
Official reports said troops shot and killed at
least nine people and wounded 30 in the town of
Gorgan, 185 miles northeast of here, when anti
government demonstrators did not obey orders to
disperse. Rioters reportedly tried to set fire to sev
eral buildings and a bank but were driven off by
security forces.
The general strike, called to maintain pressure
on Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and protest the
actions of his troops in quelling riots, was backed
by the opposition National Front, whose leader,
Karim Sanjabi, is in custody for allegedly inciting
public dissent to the shah's 37-year-old reign.
Employees of the government's Central Bank,
nerve center of Iran's monetary system, stayed off
their jobs for the second straight day, crippling the
country's ability to conduct day-to-day financial
affairs. The bank controls payments to govern
ment workers and to the many state-run indus
tries, and handles government contracts.
Shops and bazaars, the center of commercial
activity in every Iranian town and city, were re
ported closed across the country yesterday, a
normal workday in Iran. Food stores, bakeries and
some pharmacies remained open.
New information on JFK case
Dallas — An amateur photographer took pic
tures that, according to one photo analyst, may
show two people in the Texas School Book De
pository double-window from which President

John F. Kennedy was shot, minutes before the
shots were fired, the Dallas Morning News says.
In a copyright story yesterday, the newspaper
reported that greatly enlarged still frames of movie
film taken by Charles Bronson, of Ada, Okla., were
analyzed by Robert Groden, of Hope Lawn, N.J.,
who has served as consultant on photographic
evidence for the House Select Committee on As
sassinations.
Groden described forThe Associated Press what
he saw in the blow-ups.
"There is another person moving in the next set
of windows (enlargement)," he said. "He (the fi
gure) is wearing a bright red shirt. Another figure
appears to be wearing a brownish-tannish or olive
shirt. It's difficult to tell because the windows are
dirty. I can make out figures moving simultane
ously in both sets of windows.
"You can actually see one figure walking back
and forth hurriedly," Groden told the Morning
News. "I think what was happening there is the
snipper's nest was actually being completed just
prior to the shots being fired."
Motel fire kills 10, injures 24
Rochester, N.Y. — An early morning fire spread
quickly through a Holiday Inn jammed with
Thanksgiving weekend travelers yesterday, killing
10 persons and injuring 24.
The fire sent flames more than 100 feet into the
airand gutted the9l-room Holiday Inn-Northwest
in Greece, a Rochester suburb. It broke out in a
storage room at ground level in the corner of the
1.-shaped building, raced up a stairwell to the sec
ond and third floors and spread out into both
wings, according to arson investigator Michael
Fantigrossi of the Monroe County District Attor
ney's office.
It was not known for certain whether the motel
had a fire alarm system. Some survivors said they
heard a muffled alarm before fleeing the 15-year
old structure. Others said they were unsure the
alarm was a fire warning.
Damage was estimated at $2 million.
Nicaraguan outposts fired upon
Managua, Nicaragua — Leftist guerrillas staged
hit-and-run attacks on Nicaraguan national guard
outposts near the Costa Rican border yesterday,
but military spokesmen said there were no casual
ties.
A spokesman for President Anastasio Somoza's
national guard, Nicaragua's combined army and
police force, said the raids on the Boca de Sabalo
guard posts were made by members of the "Inter
national Brigades of Sandinistas."
The spokesman said the guerrillas "fled back
into Costa Rica to their refuge" after the raids.
The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front,
which led a bloody two-week rebellion against the
Somoza government in September, is known to
have gathered recruits from several other Latin

American countries.
Col. Felix Sanchez, a Nicaraguan military
spokesman, said Nicaraguan troops found a guer
rilla hideout while patrolling near the border with
Costa Rica early yesterday.
Amin forces still in Tanzania
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Tanzania said yester
day that Ugandan forces are still on Tanzanian soil
and Ugandan President Idi Amin is sending rein
forcements across the border.
Uganda says it withdrew the army units that oc
cupied 710 square miles of Tanzania late last
month, but a Tanzanian communique said there
was fighting in the area Saturday and "a number of
enemy soldiers were killed."
Uganda did not respond and the report could
not be independently confirmed. Uganda said
Saturday that Tanzanian troops invaded southern
Uganda and were supported by aircraft dropping
bombs. Tanzania made no reply to that assertion.
The latest Tanzanian communique made no
mention of Tanzanian casualties in fighting it said
took place near the town of Mutukula, which
straddles the border with Uganda in the Minziro
Forest area.
Record numbers touring U.S.
Washington — Lower air fares and a cheaper
dollar are bringing record numbers of tourists to
the United States this year, the U.S. Travel Service
says.
In the first six months of the year, travelers to the
United States totaled 8.6 million, an increase of 7
percent from the same period last year, the agency
said.
"The heavy devaluations of the U.S. dollar are
stimulating large number of travelers to visit the
U.5.A.," the Travel Service said.
For the entire year, 20 million foreign tourists
are expected to visit the United States, a 7.7 per
cent increase that is just above the average annual
increase for the past six years.
Based on polls taken abroad in 1977, foreigners,
whether traveling or not, listed the following
places in order as the ones they would most like to
see: the Far West, the Northeast, the South, the
Southwest, the mid-Atlantic region, and Atlantic
and Pacific islands. Rated lowest were the Great
Lakes, the Mountain West and New England.
More than two-thirds of the visitors are from
Canada and Mexico, but the substantial gains this
year were from all parts of the world.
Today's weather
Variable fog and low clouds locally dense nights
and mornings clearing afternoons through tomor
row. Little temperature change. Lows in the 40s.
Highs in the 50s and low 60s. Variable winds to 15

religious leaders and politicians who want to top
ple the beleaguered Shah of Iran virtually shut
down this strife-torn country yesterday, and new
anti-shah violence erupted in the provinces.
Official reports said troops shot and killed at
least nine people and wounded 30 in the town of
Gorgan, 185 miles northeast of here, when anti
government demonstrators did not obey orders to
disperse. Rioters reportedly tried to set fire to sev
eral buildings and a bank but were driven off by
security forces.
The general strike, called to maintain pressure
on Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and protest the
actions of his troops in quelling riots, was backed
by the opposition National Front, whose leader,
Karim Sanjabi, is in custody for allegedly inciting
public dissent to the shah's 37-year-old reign.
Employees of the government's Central Bank,
nerve center of Iran's monetary system, stayed off
their jobs for the second straight day, crippling the
country's ability to conduct day-to-day financial
affairs. The bank controls payments to govern
ment workers and to the many state-run indus
tries, and handles government contracts.
Shops and bazaars, the center of commercial
activity in every Iranian town and city, were re
ported closed across the country yesterday, a
normal workday in Iran. Food stores, bakeries and
some pharmacies remained open.
New information on JFK case
Dallas — An amateur photographer took pic
tures that, according to one photo analyst, may
show two people in the Texas School Book De
pository double-window from which President

John F. Kennedy was shot, minutes before the
shots were fired, the Dallas Morning News says.
In a copyright story yesterday, the newspaper
reported that greatly enlarged still frames of movie
film taken by Charles Bronson, of Ada, Okla., were
analyzed by Robert Groden, of Hope Lawn, N.J.,
who has served as consultant on photographic
evidence for the House Select Committee on As
sassinations.
Groden described forThe Associated Press what
he saw in the blow-ups.
"There is another person moving in the next set
of windows (enlargement)," he said. "He (the fi
gure) is wearing a bright red shirt. Another figure
appears to be wearing a brownish-tannish or olive
shirt. It's difficult to tell because the windows are
dirty. I can make out figures moving simultane
ously in both sets of windows.
"You can actually see one figure walking back
and forth hurriedly," Groden told the Morning
News. "I think what was happening there is the
snipper's nest was actually being completed just
prior to the shots being fired."
Motel fire kills 10, injures 24
Rochester, N.Y. — An early morning fire spread
quickly through a Holiday Inn jammed with
Thanksgiving weekend travelers yesterday, killing
10 persons and injuring 24.
The fire sent flames more than 100 feet into the
airand gutted the9l-room Holiday Inn-Northwest
in Greece, a Rochester suburb. It broke out in a
storage room at ground level in the corner of the
1.-shaped building, raced up a stairwell to the sec
ond and third floors and spread out into both
wings, according to arson investigator Michael
Fantigrossi of the Monroe County District Attor
ney's office.
It was not known for certain whether the motel
had a fire alarm system. Some survivors said they
heard a muffled alarm before fleeing the 15-year
old structure. Others said they were unsure the
alarm was a fire warning.
Damage was estimated at $2 million.
Nicaraguan outposts fired upon
Managua, Nicaragua — Leftist guerrillas staged
hit-and-run attacks on Nicaraguan national guard
outposts near the Costa Rican border yesterday,
but military spokesmen said there were no casual
ties.
A spokesman for President Anastasio Somoza's
national guard, Nicaragua's combined army and
police force, said the raids on the Boca de Sabalo
guard posts were made by members of the "Inter
national Brigades of Sandinistas."
The spokesman said the guerrillas "fled back
into Costa Rica to their refuge" after the raids.
The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front,
which led a bloody two-week rebellion against the
Somoza government in September, is known to
have gathered recruits from several other Latin

American countries.
Col. Felix Sanchez, a Nicaraguan military
spokesman, said Nicaraguan troops found a guer
rilla hideout while patrolling near the border with
Costa Rica early yesterday.
Amin forces still in Tanzania
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Tanzania said yester
day that Ugandan forces are still on Tanzanian soil
and Ugandan President Idi Amin is sending rein
forcements across the border.
Uganda says it withdrew the army units that oc
cupied 710 square miles of Tanzania late last
month, but a Tanzanian communique said there
was fighting in the area Saturday and "a number of
enemy soldiers were killed."
Uganda did not respond and the report could
not be independently confirmed. Uganda said
Saturday that Tanzanian troops invaded southern
Uganda and were supported by aircraft dropping
bombs. Tanzania made no reply to that assertion.
The latest Tanzanian communique made no
mention of Tanzanian casualties in fighting it said
took place near the town of Mutukula, which
straddles the border with Uganda in the Minziro
Forest area.
Record numbers touring U.S.
Washington — Lower air fares and a cheaper
dollar are bringing record numbers of tourists to
the United States this year, the U.S. Travel Service
says.
In the first six months of the year, travelers to the
United States totaled 8.6 million, an increase of 7
percent from the same period last year, the agency
said.
"The heavy devaluations of the U.S. dollar are
stimulating large number of travelers to visit the
U.5.A.," the Travel Service said.
For the entire year, 20 million foreign tourists
are expected to visit the United States, a 7.7 per
cent increase that is just above the average annual
increase for the past six years.
Based on polls taken abroad in 1977, foreigners,
whether traveling or not, listed the following
places in order as the ones they would most like to
see: the Far West, the Northeast, the South, the
Southwest, the mid-Atlantic region, and Atlantic
and Pacific islands. Rated lowest were the Great
Lakes, the Mountain West and New England.
More than two-thirds of the visitors are from
Canada and Mexico, but the substantial gains this
year were from all parts of the world.

Sadat expects treaty to be signed
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat said yes
terday he believes Egypt and Israel will sign a
peace treaty "sooner or later" despite the current
deadlock in the Washington negotiations.
"There are problems and it will take time but
that does not mean I am pessimistic, not at all,"
Sadat told reporters. "Sooner or later we shall be
signing an agreement. This is a fact."
But in Israel the state radio said Prime Minister
Menachem Begin reaffirmed Israel's position in a
Cabinet meeting yesterday that there is no reason
to send negotiators back to Washington at this
point.
Government spokesman Arieh Naor said Israel
was awaiting Egypt's reply to the Israeli Cabinet's
decision last Tuesday rejecting Sadat's proposal
that a timetable for Palestinian self-rule in the West
Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip be
included in the peace treaty.
Sadat has ordered a top-level committee to reas
sess the Egyptian position in the negotiations in
light of the Israeli decision.

New information on JFK case
Dallas — An amateur photographer took pic
tures that, according to one photo analyst, may
show two people in the Texas School Book De
pository double-window from which President

John F. Kennedy was shot, minutes before the
shots were fired, the Dallas Morning News says.
In a copyright story yesterday, the newspaper
reported that greatly enlarged still frames of movie
film taken by Charles Bronson, of Ada, Okla., were
analyzed by Robert Groden, of Hope Lawn, N.J.,
who has served as consultant on photographic
evidence for the House Select Committee on As
sassinations.
Groden described forThe Associated Press what
he saw in the blow-ups.
"There is another person moving in the next set
of windows (enlargement)," he said. "He (the fi
gure) is wearing a bright red shirt. Another figure
appears to be wearing a brownish-tannish or olive
shirt. It's difficult to tell because the windows are
dirty. I can make out figures moving simultane
ously in both sets of windows.
"You can actually see one figure walking back
and forth hurriedly," Groden told the Morning
News. "I think what was happening there is the
snipper's nest was actually being completed just
prior to the shots being fired."
Motel fire kills 10, injures 24
Rochester, N.Y. — An early morning fire spread
quickly through a Holiday Inn jammed with
Thanksgiving weekend travelers yesterday, killing
10 persons and injuring 24.
The fire sent flames more than 100 feet into the
airand gutted the9l-room Holiday Inn-Northwest
in Greece, a Rochester suburb. It broke out in a
storage room at ground level in the corner of the
1.-shaped building, raced up a stairwell to the sec
ond and third floors and spread out into both
wings, according to arson investigator Michael
Fantigrossi of the Monroe County District Attor
ney's office.
It was not known for certain whether the motel
had a fire alarm system. Some survivors said they
heard a muffled alarm before fleeing the 15-year
old structure. Others said they were unsure the
alarm was a fire warning.
Damage was estimated at $2 million.
Nicaraguan outposts fired upon
Managua, Nicaragua — Leftist guerrillas staged
hit-and-run attacks on Nicaraguan national guard
outposts near the Costa Rican border yesterday,
but military spokesmen said there were no casual
ties.
A spokesman for President Anastasio Somoza's
national guard, Nicaragua's combined army and
police force, said the raids on the Boca de Sabalo
guard posts were made by members of the "Inter
national Brigades of Sandinistas."
The spokesman said the guerrillas "fled back
into Costa Rica to their refuge" after the raids.
The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front,
which led a bloody two-week rebellion against the
Somoza government in September, is known to
have gathered recruits from several other Latin

American countries.
Col. Felix Sanchez, a Nicaraguan military
spokesman, said Nicaraguan troops found a guer
rilla hideout while patrolling near the border with
Costa Rica early yesterday.
Amin forces still in Tanzania
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Tanzania said yester
day that Ugandan forces are still on Tanzanian soil
and Ugandan President Idi Amin is sending rein
forcements across the border.
Uganda says it withdrew the army units that oc
cupied 710 square miles of Tanzania late last
month, but a Tanzanian communique said there
was fighting in the area Saturday and "a number of
enemy soldiers were killed."
Uganda did not respond and the report could
not be independently confirmed. Uganda said
Saturday that Tanzanian troops invaded southern
Uganda and were supported by aircraft dropping
bombs. Tanzania made no reply to that assertion.
The latest Tanzanian communique made no
mention of Tanzanian casualties in fighting it said
took place near the town of Mutukula, which
straddles the border with Uganda in the Minziro
Forest area.
Record numbers touring U.S.
Washington — Lower air fares and a cheaper
dollar are bringing record numbers of tourists to
the United States this year, the U.S. Travel Service
says.
In the first six months of the year, travelers to the
United States totaled 8.6 million, an increase of 7
percent from the same period last year, the agency
said.
"The heavy devaluations of the U.S. dollar are
stimulating large number of travelers to visit the
U.5.A.," the Travel Service said.
For the entire year, 20 million foreign tourists
are expected to visit the United States, a 7.7 per
cent increase that is just above the average annual
increase for the past six years.
Based on polls taken abroad in 1977, foreigners,
whether traveling or not, listed the following
places in order as the ones they would most like to
see: the Far West, the Northeast, the South, the
Southwest, the mid-Atlantic region, and Atlantic
and Pacific islands. Rated lowest were the Great
Lakes, the Mountain West and New England.
More than two-thirds of the visitors are from
Canada and Mexico, but the substantial gains this
year were from all parts of the world.

Sadat expects treaty to be signed
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat said yes
terday he believes Egypt and Israel will sign a
peace treaty "sooner or later" despite the current
deadlock in the Washington negotiations.
"There are problems and it will take time but
that does not mean I am pessimistic, not at all,"
Sadat told reporters. "Sooner or later we shall be
signing an agreement. This is a fact."
But in Israel the state radio said Prime Minister
Menachem Begin reaffirmed Israel's position in a
Cabinet meeting yesterday that there is no reason
to send negotiators back to Washington at this
point.
Government spokesman Arieh Naor said Israel
was awaiting Egypt's reply to the Israeli Cabinet's
decision last Tuesday rejecting Sadat's proposal
that a timetable for Palestinian self-rule in the West
Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip be
included in the peace treaty.
Sadat has ordered a top-level committee to reas
sess the Egyptian position in the negotiations in
light of the Israeli decision.
Iranians strike against the shah
Tehran, Iran — A general strike called by Moslem
religious leaders and politicians who want to top
ple the beleaguered Shah of Iran virtually shut
down this strife-torn country yesterday, and new
anti-shah violence erupted in the provinces.
Official reports said troops shot and killed at
least nine people and wounded 30 in the town of
Gorgan, 185 miles northeast of here, when anti
government demonstrators did not obey orders to
disperse. Rioters reportedly tried to set fire to sev
eral buildings and a bank but were driven off by
security forces.
The general strike, called to maintain pressure
on Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and protest the
actions of his troops in quelling riots, was backed
by the opposition National Front, whose leader,
Karim Sanjabi, is in custody for allegedly inciting
public dissent to the shah's 37-year-old reign.
Employees of the government's Central Bank,
nerve center of Iran's monetary system, stayed off
their jobs for the second straight day, crippling the
country's ability to conduct day-to-day financial
affairs. The bank controls payments to govern

appears to be wearing a brownish-tannish or olive
shirt. It's difficult to tell because the windows are
dirty. I can make out figures moving simultane
ously in both sets of windows.
"You can actually see one figure walking back
and forth hurriedly," Groden told the Morning
News. "I think what was happening there is the
snipper's nest was actually being completed just
prior to the shots being fired."
Motel fire kills 10, injures 24
Rochester, N.Y. — An early morning fire spread
quickly through a Holiday Inn jammed with
Thanksgiving weekend travelers yesterday, killing
10 persons and injuring 24.
The fire sent flames more than 100 feet into the
airand gutted the9l-room Holiday Inn-Northwest
in Greece, a Rochester suburb. It broke out in a
storage room at ground level in the corner of the
1.-shaped building, raced up a stairwell to the sec
ond and third floors and spread out into both
wings, according to arson investigator Michael
Fantigrossi of the Monroe County District Attor
ney's office.
It was not known for certain whether the motel
had a fire alarm system. Some survivors said they
heard a muffled alarm before fleeing the 15-year
old structure. Others said they were unsure the
alarm was a fire warning.
Damage was estimated at $2 million.
Nicaraguan outposts fired upon
Managua, Nicaragua — Leftist guerrillas staged
hit-and-run attacks on Nicaraguan national guard
outposts near the Costa Rican border yesterday,
but military spokesmen said there were no casual
ties.
A spokesman for President Anastasio Somoza's
national guard, Nicaragua's combined army and
police force, said the raids on the Boca de Sabalo
guard posts were made by members of the "Inter
national Brigades of Sandinistas."
The spokesman said the guerrillas "fled back
into Costa Rica to their refuge" after the raids.
The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front,
which led a bloody two-week rebellion against the
Somoza government in September, is known to
have gathered recruits from several other Latin

American countries.
Col. Felix Sanchez, a Nicaraguan military
spokesman, said Nicaraguan troops found a guer
rilla hideout while patrolling near the border with
Costa Rica early yesterday.
Amin forces still in Tanzania
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — Tanzania said yester
day that Ugandan forces are still on Tanzanian soil
and Ugandan President Idi Amin is sending rein
forcements across the border.
Uganda says it withdrew the army units that oc
cupied 710 square miles of Tanzania late last
month, but a Tanzanian communique said there
was fighting in the area Saturday and "a number of
enemy soldiers were killed."
Uganda did not respond and the report could
not be independently confirmed. Uganda said
Saturday that Tanzanian troops invaded southern
Uganda and were supported by aircraft dropping
bombs. Tanzania made no reply to that assertion.
The latest Tanzanian communique made no
mention of Tanzanian casualties in fighting it said
took place near the town of Mutukula, which
straddles the border with Uganda in the Minziro
Forest area.
Record numbers touring U.S.
Washington — Lower air fares and a cheaper
dollar are bringing record numbers of tourists to
the United States this year, the U.S. Travel Service
says.
In the first six months of the year, travelers to the
United States totaled 8.6 million, an increase of 7
percent from the same period last year, the agency
said.
"The heavy devaluations of the U.S. dollar are
stimulating large number of travelers to visit the
U.5.A.," the Travel Service said.
For the entire year, 20 million foreign tourists
are expected to visit the United States, a 7.7 per
cent increase that is just above the average annual
increase for the past six years.
Based on polls taken abroad in 1977, foreigners,
whether traveling or not, listed the following
places in order as the ones they would most like to
see: the Far West, the Northeast, the South, the
Southwest, the mid-Atlantic region, and Atlantic
and Pacific islands. Rated lowest were the Great
Lakes, the Mountain West and New England.
More than two-thirds of the visitors are from
Canada and Mexico, but the substantial gains this
year were from all parts of the world.
