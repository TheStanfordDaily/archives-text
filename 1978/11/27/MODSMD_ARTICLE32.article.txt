Fine forgiven
Harvard University has graciously
forgiven a professor what would
have been the largest library fine in
its history after a collegue returned a
book 50 years overdue.
Late last month Physiology Prof.
George Feigen returned to Harvard a
copy of The Theory of Transfinite
Numbers by Georg Cantor, checked
out by the late )ulien Ripley a half
century earlier. Ripley received his
Master of Science at Harvard in 1932.
A retired professor of physical sci
ences here, Ripley died four years
ago in Pennsylvania. While visiting
the family there, Feigen discovered

the overdue book and sent it back to
Harvard. Feigen added a note, "Hav
ing know )ulien well, I think it would
have pleased him to know that the
book was returned on the 29th of
October, 50 years late, owing Har
vard a fine of $913.10. For the repose
of his soul, I hope that this sets some
kind of record." A spokesman forthe
Harvard Library replied that the wish
"is more than realized. Due to an
increase in the fine to 10 cents a day
in 1950, subtracting Sundays and ad
ding leap years, the grand total came
to $1263.75, which we have decided
to waive in consideration of your
superb timing of its return on the
50th anniversary of the due date."
