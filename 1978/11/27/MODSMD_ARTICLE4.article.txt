# Soviet involvement with sect alleged
## Task force leaves Guyana 
### 
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — The
U.S. military task force, its gruesome
job at Jonestown completed, began
moving out of Guyana yesterday.
Black smoke hung over the airport
here as the troops burned uniforms,
boots and tents that might have been
contaminated by the decaying
bodies at the site of the mass
suicide-murders of American cul
tists.
The contingent's commander,
Col. William Gordon, said a total of
909 bodies were found at Jonestown.
But in Dover, Del., where the bodies
were taken, officials said they had
counted 912 corpses.
Others slain in the weekend of vio
lence were Rep. Leo Ryan (D-San
Mateo), three newsmen and a Jones
town woman killed in an ambush at
the Port Kaituma airstrip, and four

cult members murdered at the sect's
Georgetown headquarters.
Tim Carter, one of the survivors of
the Nov. 17 suicide-murders at the
Jonestown settlement in northern
Guyana, said Jones frequently spoke
of relocating the colony in another
country. Jones specifically men
tioned the Soviet Union about three
months ago, calling it the "promised
land," said the 28-year-old Carter
from Boise, Idaho.
Possible Soviet involvement
According to Carter, it was general
knowledge at the settlement that two
Soviet consular officials made at least
two visits to Jonestown, and he said
Jones' aides had visited the Soviet
Embassy in Georgetown.
Carter, his brother Michael, 20,
and Michael Prokes, 32, of Modesto,
Calif., had been arrested by
Guyanese police for investigation of
the Nov. 17 killings in Port Kaituma.
Carter, his brother and Prokes
were released from police headquar
ters Saturday night. At that time the
three men told reporters they had
been told to deliver a suitcase,
packed with money, to the Soviet
Embassy.
They said Maria Katsaris, who they
identified as Jones' mistress, came to
them during the death ritual, gave
them the suitcase and told them to
take it to "the embassy."
Carter said he thought she meant
the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown,
but the case was too heavy to carry
far and when they opened it they
found it contained thousands of dol
lars and a letter addressed to the
Soviet Embassy.
The evacuation of bodies was
finished Saturday night, with the de
parture of the last American C-141,
carrying 83 caskets containing more
than 180 bodies, many of them chil
dren, to the mortuary at Dover Air

Force Base, Del.
A Pentagon press attache, Army
Maj. Brigham Shuler, said that as of
last night, 512 bodies had been
fingerprinted by an FBI disaster team
and 26 positively identified, includ
ing the cult's leader, the Rev. Jim
Jones. The others' names were not
released.
The task of identifying, cleaning
and embalming the bodies could last
a month or more, he said.
Bodies 'in rings'.
Air Force Capt. John Moscatelli,
the task force spokesman, said the
bodies "appeared to be in rings or
circles with the kids in the centerand
the larger adults on the outside."
Except for cult leader the Rev. Jim
Jones and two women, all three of
whom died of bullet wounds, none
of the bodies showed any signs of
death other than by poison, Mos
catelli said.
U.S. Embassy officials here said
survivors not involved as material
witnesses or suspects in the slayings
could return to the United States as
soon as Guyanese officials release
them, but they could not say when
that would be. Guyanese officials
were not available for comment yes
terday.
In Delaware, a sealed note was
found on the body of the Rev. Jones
by an ai rman, the FBI said yesterday.
The note has been read, said FBI
spokesman Tom Coll, but its con
tents will not be released soon be
cause it may eventually be used for
evidence. Coll said the note was
being disinfected in an FBI laboratory
— it apparently had been on Jones'
bodyforsix days — and will probably
be examined today.
"We have not established as yet
that it is in his handwriting," said
Coll, adding, "we have not said it was
a suicide note."

Embassy in Georgetown.
Carter, his brother Michael, 20,
and Michael Prokes, 32, of Modesto,
Calif., had been arrested by
Guyanese police for investigation of
the Nov. 17 killings in Port Kaituma.
Carter, his brother and Prokes
were released from police headquar
ters Saturday night. At that time the
three men told reporters they had
been told to deliver a suitcase,
packed with money, to the Soviet
Embassy.
They said Maria Katsaris, who they
identified as Jones' mistress, came to
them during the death ritual, gave
them the suitcase and told them to
take it to "the embassy."
Carter said he thought she meant
the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown,
but the case was too heavy to carry
far and when they opened it they
found it contained thousands of dol
lars and a letter addressed to the
Soviet Embassy.
The evacuation of bodies was
finished Saturday night, with the de
parture of the last American C-141,
carrying 83 caskets containing more
than 180 bodies, many of them chil
dren, to the mortuary at Dover Air

Force Base, Del.
A Pentagon press attache, Army
Maj. Brigham Shuler, said that as of
last night, 512 bodies had been
fingerprinted by an FBI disaster team
and 26 positively identified, includ
ing the cult's leader, the Rev. Jim
Jones. The others' names were not
released.
The task of identifying, cleaning
and embalming the bodies could last
a month or more, he said.
Bodies 'in rings'.
Air Force Capt. John Moscatelli,
the task force spokesman, said the
bodies "appeared to be in rings or
circles with the kids in the centerand
the larger adults on the outside."
Except for cult leader the Rev. Jim
Jones and two women, all three of
whom died of bullet wounds, none
of the bodies showed any signs of
death other than by poison, Mos
catelli said.
U.S. Embassy officials here said
survivors not involved as material
witnesses or suspects in the slayings
could return to the United States as
soon as Guyanese officials release
them, but they could not say when
that would be. Guyanese officials
were not available for comment yes
terday.
In Delaware, a sealed note was
found on the body of the Rev. Jones
by an ai rman, the FBI said yesterday.
The note has been read, said FBI
spokesman Tom Coll, but its con
tents will not be released soon be
cause it may eventually be used for
evidence. Coll said the note was
being disinfected in an FBI laboratory
— it apparently had been on Jones'
bodyforsix days — and will probably
be examined today.
"We have not established as yet
that it is in his handwriting," said
Coll, adding, "we have not said it was
a suicide note."
Georgetown, Guyana (AP) — The
U.S. military task force, its gruesome
job at Jonestown completed, began
moving out of Guyana yesterday.
Black smoke hung over the airport
here as the troops burned uniforms,
boots and tents that might have been
contaminated by the decaying
bodies at the site of the mass
suicide-murders of American cul
tists.
The contingent's commander,
Col. William Gordon, said a total of
909 bodies were found at Jonestown.
But in Dover, Del., where the bodies
were taken, officials said they had
counted 912 corpses.
Others slain in the weekend of vio
lence were Rep. Leo Ryan (D-San
Mateo), three newsmen and a Jones
town woman killed in an ambush at
the Port Kaituma airstrip, and four

cult members murdered at the sect's
Georgetown headquarters.
Tim Carter, one of the survivors of
the Nov. 17 suicide-murders at the
Jonestown settlement in northern
Guyana, said Jones frequently spoke
of relocating the colony in another
country. Jones specifically men
tioned the Soviet Union about three
months ago, calling it the "promised
land," said the 28-year-old Carter
from Boise, Idaho.
Possible Soviet involvement
According to Carter, it was general
knowledge at the settlement that two
Soviet consular officials made at least
two visits to Jonestown, and he said
Jones' aides had visited the Soviet
Embassy in Georgetown.
