# Profs reach high school history classes nationwide
## 
### BRAD CRYSTAL 
Even before arriving here, scores of stu
dents in every incoming freshman class
have been on intimate terms with two of
the University's most eminent history pro
fessors.
Emeritus Prof. Thomas Bailey and Prof.
Carl Degler, authors of two widely used
American history texts, are familiar names
to Advanced Placement (AP) history clas
ses across the country. Ironically, Bailey
and Degler, whose respective works, The
American Pageant and Out of Our Past, sell
thousands of copies a year, never in
tended their works to be used at the high
school level.
In fact, Bailey, who taught here for 40
years, says he wishes so many high schools
didn't use the Pageant, which has sold
about one million copies since the first
printing in 1956. He added that colleges,
particularly junior colleges, often spurn
his text because of its reputation as "high
school" reading.
Nevertheless, the chipper 75-year-old
does "not regard the Pageant's use in high
schools as a denigration of the book"
since it has been adopted primarily by AP
classes.
AP courses, however, do not account
exclusively for the book's sales. Less than
six months ago the Pageant was adopted
statewide by the high schools of South
Carolina.
What explains the book's overwhelming

popularity — the kind of popularity which
spurred a Marin High School history class
to send Bailey a congratulatory telegram
on his birthday? Perhaps it is the author's
common sense theory that "the things that
engage our interest are those that we re
member the easiest and best."
Or perhaps it is the relatively short sen
tences and paragraphs and the frequent
use of pictures, cartoons and subheads.
At times Bailey has been accused of
"overstepping the bounds of good taste."
For example, "I say Theodore Roosevelt
bastardized the Monroe Doctrine.' Some
of these inspectors don't know enough
about the English language to realize that's
a perfectly good word in that context. I'd
rather overdo it than underdo it,"he said.
"If I had tried to please everyone at the
same time, I would have had a bland,
bland book that people would have gone
to sleep over."
In contrast to Bailey, Degler has no re
servations about Out of Our Past being
used at the high school level. "The wider
the audience the better," said the 54-year
old native New Yorker.
Published in 1959, Out of Our Past was
Degler's first book. He calls it a "risky"
endeavor because "people who are un
known don't usually write for the layman."
He described the book as a compilation of
personal views reflecting a philosophy
that "history is not a set pattern."

His objective was to bring to intelligent
readers the controversies that historians
live with. "My book suggest that the per
ception of the past is constantly changing
as a result of new information," he said.
Out of Our Past was acclaimed by the
late History Prof. David Potter as "the best
single-volume book on American his
tory." Degler said he believes the book
was directly responsible for his invitation
to become a professor here.
Since the initial printing, Out of Our Past

has been revised only once —10 years ago
when Degler began his professorship
here. He said he has been deterred from
more revisions because he believes that if
he were to embark on another such under
taking he "would want the relatively
young age of 35, he said "when I was
young I thought I had all the answers."
Revisions
Unlike Degler's analytical Out of Our
Past, Bailey's book has been revised sev
eral times, with the latest sixth edition
scheduled to roll off the presses in De
cember.
The sixth edition updates American his
tory to the Carter administration and con
tains new information on women and
ethnic minorities, Bailey said.
Bailey said he decided collaborate with
History Prof. David Kennedy on the latest
revision because he thought it was best
"to pass on to him the 'secrets' of The
American Pageant."
"I am now 75," Bailey wrote in a letter to
his publisher D.C. Heath, "and by taking
aboard a co-author I may give the impres
sion that I have lost interest in the book —
or even lost some of my 'marbles," I can
only say that since my 'retirement' ten
years ago I have authored or co-authored a
half dozen books.
"I have not yet hung up my suit, but
when I do I shall rest secure in the know
ledge that I have passed on the torch to the
best possible hands," he said.
