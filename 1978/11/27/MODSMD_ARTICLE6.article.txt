# Lacing costumes, transporting performers
## Student group 'livens' Lively Arts 
### JESSICA CHERESKIN 
One of the liveliest things
about the University Lively Arts
program this year is its new
17-member student commit
tee. The students provide extra
assistance and unique services
for the Lively Arts staff.
Through the Lively Arts prog
ram, numerous dancetroupes,
musical ensembles and other
performers visit the University
annually. The student commit
tee's primary duty is to pub
licize concerts to University
students.
The committee members
visit dormitories during study
breaks to explain the Lively
Arts and to spark interest in its
performances. They also pre
sent promotional "student
awareness" fairs periodically.
Last spring, Vicki Holt, direc
tor of the Office of Public
Events, which oversees the
Lively Arts program, met with
her staff to discuss what
seemed to be a growing prob
lem. Only 30 percent of the au
diences at Lively Arts events
were students. "We were in a
position to totally lose contact
with the students," said Susie
Farr, associate director of the
Lively Arts program. Holt's staff
then organized a publicity fair
at Tresidder Union, held in
May. Students interested in
learning about or applying for
committee membership could
do so at the fair.
During the selection inter
views, Holt, Farrand other staff
members looked for en
thusiastic students with an in
terest and background in the
performing arts. They also
wanted diverse membership.
The students selected repre

sent all class divisions and
many different majors. Some
are dancers; some play musical
instruments while others have
no performing talents. The re
sult is a committee which is as
unhomogenous as the Univer
sity population, and thus, can
be an accurate indicator of di
verse student opinion here,
sophomore Kathleen Harris,
said.
Farradmitted that, "We were
all a little nervous at the first
meeting," but initial uneasi
ness soon disappeared as ideas
and plans for the year rolled
forth. Besides Farr, Lynn
Mecklenburg, publicity direc
tor for the Office of Public
Events, and Craig Leitner,
community outreach coor
dinator, represent the adult
adviser faction which attends
the committee's bimonthly
meetings and directs its three
main functions.
As well as forming a liaison
with their student peers, the
committee members host visit
ing artists by arranging any
thing from transportation of
performers and post
performance private recep
tions to distributing backstage
refreshments or finding tennis
partners for some artists.
Harris, whose stint as an
usher at the Paramount Thea
ter in Oakland originally in
duced her to apply for a posi
tion on the committee, picked
up the Kathryn Posin Dance
Company at the airport. Harris
ended up eating dinner with
the dancers at Posin's family's
home.
During the company's per
formance, Harris stood
backstage, helping dancers put

on and remove cumbersome
costumes. "Most students
don't get to see artists the same
way that we do," she said,
"during the middle of a per
formance or in the relaxed at
mosphere off-stage.'
The committee members are
also largely responsible for as
sisting Leitner with the com
munity outreach program, a
two-year-old activity funded by
a grant from the San Francisco
Foundation for the Arts. At
tempting to break down bar
riers between the University
and the Bay Area community,
Leitner arranges for Lively Arts
performers to stage free mini
concerts for neighboring
school groups, small colleges,
senior citizens and private au
diences.
Members have also com
piled an Artists Orientation
Packet which lists restaurants,
hotels, laundromats, cinemas
and verious service facilities in
the Palo Alto area. The stu
dents also hope to begin sel
ling drinks and snacks during
performance intermissions.
Lively Arts T-shirts and badges
may soon be sold also.
To serve again next year, cur
rent members must reinter
view with the Lively Arts staff.
Vacancies will be filled by new
applicants.
"I think the committee's
marvelous," Holt said. "It gives
us some real direct contact
with students and also new
input into the Lively Arts." Farr
concurs, citing larger student
audiences and positive feed
back from artists and their
agents as signs of success. She
hopes to attract more off
campus students to perfor

mances and to educate the
committee members on the fi
nancial sides of the performing
arts, such as booking artists,
arranging contracts, and or
ganizing fund-raising efforts.
"I think the possibilities for the
committee are endless," she
said .
Student members agree
about the committee's suc
cess. "I'd say it's one of the
best things I've gotten involved
with at Stanford. I'm very en
thusiastic about it," Harris
said. She and her equally avid
colleagues value their special
chance to help and talk with
performers personally. They
receive satisfaction from most
of the artists who respond
warmly and appreciatively to
their efforts. "Each of us has a
richer experience because of
this."


In addition to helping performers dress before concerts and publicizing Lively Arts events, members of the
student Lively Arts committee sell programs to event patrons.
