"Solar power is the only
answer for our energy needs.
But solar collectors require
huge land areas which are un
available. Wecould put the col
lectors in space. The power
could then be beamed to earth
from these solar satellites.
"It is uneconomical to con
struct a solar collector with
materials shot up from the
earth. Instead, we could build
them with raw materials ob
tained from space. The moon
has many valuable building
materials. The ore could be
broken down into the size of
softballs and shot to a proces
sing facility orbiting the moon.
But the moon doesn't have

some essential materials. As
teroids do. They vary in size
and are the remnants of an un
formed planet. We could send
a space-shuttle after one to
bring it into orbit around the
moon where it could be pro
cessed by an orbiting facility.
"The development of space
would require large numbers
of workers there; self
supporting colonies would be
set up to provide comfortable
living quarters."
Are these the prophecies of a
science fiction writer? No.
These are statements of David
Ross, a doctoral candidate here
in aeronautical engineering.
Ross, whose thesis discusses
the retrieval of valuable mate

rial from asteroids, is a
member of a new group here,
the Stanford Space Develop
ment Institute. The organiza
tion's members hope to gener
ate interest in the development
of space. They plan to bring
speakers to campus and form a
small library on the subject.
Also to be established is a net
work of possible employers
and research projects for
graduate students interested in
this field. Gayle Pergammit,
another member and student
spouse, said the institute's
formation was largely "spon
taneous. No one person is
starting it. The subject is not
limited to any single academic
field, like aeronautics."
A symposium on space de
velopment, sponsored by the
institute and a SWOPSI space
colonization course, will be
held in early December. Per
gammit said that Gerard
O'Neill of Princeton University

will probably be the featured
speaker.
Beaming solar power to
earth is one possibility for
space development, according
to Pergammit. Another is the
enhancement of global com
munications. Ross continued,
"With larger communications
satellites built in space, man on
earth would need little equip
ment to communicate, such as
a telephone wristwatch. Any
one from a tribe in Tanzania to
a hiker in the wilds could
communicate instantly and
globally with just a wrist
phone."
The initial costs of using
space, including the construc
tion of a processing and man
ufacturing facility with acolony
of workers in space, would be
"twice the cost of the Apollo
space program," Ross said.
Government and industry
sources would bear the initial
costs.

available. Wecould put the col
lectors in space. The power
could then be beamed to earth
from these solar satellites.
"It is uneconomical to con
struct a solar collector with
materials shot up from the
earth. Instead, we could build
them with raw materials ob
tained from space. The moon
has many valuable building
materials. The ore could be
broken down into the size of
softballs and shot to a proces
sing facility orbiting the moon.
But the moon doesn't have

some essential materials. As
teroids do. They vary in size
and are the remnants of an un
formed planet. We could send
a space-shuttle after one to
bring it into orbit around the
moon where it could be pro
cessed by an orbiting facility.
"The development of space
would require large numbers
of workers there; self
supporting colonies would be
set up to provide comfortable
living quarters."
Are these the prophecies of a
science fiction writer? No.
These are statements of David
Ross, a doctoral candidate here
in aeronautical engineering.
Ross, whose thesis discusses
the retrieval of valuable mate

rial from asteroids, is a
member of a new group here,
the Stanford Space Develop
ment Institute. The organiza
tion's members hope to gener
ate interest in the development
of space. They plan to bring
speakers to campus and form a
small library on the subject.
Also to be established is a net
work of possible employers
and research projects for
graduate students interested in
this field. Gayle Pergammit,
another member and student
spouse, said the institute's
formation was largely "spon
taneous. No one person is
starting it. The subject is not
limited to any single academic
field, like aeronautics."
A symposium on space de
velopment, sponsored by the
institute and a SWOPSI space
colonization course, will be
held in early December. Per
gammit said that Gerard
O'Neill of Princeton University

will probably be the featured
speaker.
Beaming solar power to
earth is one possibility for
space development, according
to Pergammit. Another is the
enhancement of global com
munications. Ross continued,
"With larger communications
satellites built in space, man on
earth would need little equip
ment to communicate, such as
a telephone wristwatch. Any
one from a tribe in Tanzania to
a hiker in the wilds could
communicate instantly and
globally with just a wrist
phone."
The initial costs of using
space, including the construc
tion of a processing and man
ufacturing facility with acolony
of workers in space, would be
"twice the cost of the Apollo
space program," Ross said.
Government and industry
sources would bear the initial
costs.
"Solar power is the only
answer for our energy needs.
But solar collectors require
huge land areas which are un
available. Wecould put the col
lectors in space. The power
could then be beamed to earth
from these solar satellites.
