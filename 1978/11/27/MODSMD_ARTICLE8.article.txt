# Visiting German prof adds vitality, experience
## 
### ALEEN ZIMBEROFF 
"The man thinks in symbols
and metaphors," said one of
his students, Alan Talbott.
"He's made a marvelous con
tribution to the German De
partment in such a short time,"
added Joe Harris, associate
professor of English.
Judging from these com
ments, visiting Prof. Gerd

Weber, Scandinavianist and
medievalist at the Johann-
Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat
in Frankfurt, has made quite an
impression this quarter.
"I'm just a guest here. The
only thing that is me is the mail
and my keys," said Weber
modestly. He was invited here
to replace Theodore An
dersson who is on leave this

quarter. Weber is teaching a
course on European, especially
Nordic, symbolism in literature
and art about 1900.
In the classroom, Weber
completely wipes away the
usual regiment of a lecturing
professor. He rocks back and
forth at the edge of a desk, urg
ing on the comments of the 12
students assembled to explore

the works of Strindberg and Ib
sen.
Weber began specializing in
Nordic studies as a student in
Frankfurt. He chose medieval
literature "as a matter of
chance. The students in Ger
many demanded it. It came
partly by force and then I came
to like it,"he said.
He stressed the importance
of studying literature. "Litera
ture is part of our human cul
ture. When human beings lose
their historical perspective,
they become one
dimentional," he argued.
Weber was born in 1942 in
Offenbach. "As a boy, I liked to
go out to the country. It's dif
ficult to do now in Germany —
there's no country left.
"I was growing up in idyllic
surroundings when everyone
else was struggling to get away
from the war. I am very fond of
nature. I can sit on cliffs and
enjoy it. But, I am not a
naturalist," he said.
Weber attended Oxford and
University of Salamanca. He
was "infatuated with the
Spanish culture," and rather
fancied himself starting a
career in Spanish studies. His
teaching career includes two
years in Sweden and five years

as a full professor at the Uni
versitat in Frankfurt where he
received his doctorate in 1972.
Weber has integrated his
work with pleasure. "My job, is
in part, my hobby," he
explained. "I go to auctions of
oriental rugs, not to buy, but
because I like the patterns. I
travel to talk to people of
foreign cultures and investi
gate their minds."
Although Weber studies
Germanic poetry, he does not
compose it. "Learning about
all these things interferes with
my own creativity," he confes
sed. He also enjoys painting
and tennis.
Weber taught at the Univer
sity of Uppsala in Sweden and
found the people "shy and re
stricted. The girls don't live up
to the European image," he
added.
Weber described Stanford as
a "large monastery" where the
students are "committed to
learning."
"There is a real desire for
knowledge here. The ap
proach is more naive. It's fas
cinating for a teacher."
Because the German De
partment here has a pre
arranged schedule, Weber is
"less free to teach what I want

here." He was planning to
teach a graduate seminar on
Germanic poetry but all the
prospective students are over
seas this quarter.
"Instead of growling about
the students not being at his
feet, he goes out and seeks
them," said George Brown, an
English professor here. "He's
immensely open to every stu
dent that comes in to talk,"
Brown added.
"Weber is a really bright
man. He's got an individual
outiook about what he's doing.
I have a sense that it really
means something to him," one
student said.
"He's interested in a lot
more than just academic en
deavors," commented a resi
dent of Haus Mitteleuropa
where Weber spoke last
month.
Although Weber "usually
talks 10 to 15 minutes" over
every class, and is accessible to
students, he is a private per
son.
"I rather like to camouflage
myself all the time," he admit
ted. He speaks several lan
guages and "finds privacy in
the Swedish tongue."
Weber has written several
books and numerous articles

and reviews. "His breadth is
extraordinary," said Joe Harris.
But he isn't ready to put it all
down in words yet.
"At my age you don't think
about your own biography,
you just keep on living," said
Weber.

here." He was planning to
teach a graduate seminar on
Germanic poetry but all the
prospective students are over
seas this quarter.
"Instead of growling about
the students not being at his
feet, he goes out and seeks
them," said George Brown, an
English professor here. "He's
immensely open to every stu
dent that comes in to talk,"
Brown added.
"Weber is a really bright
man. He's got an individual
outiook about what he's doing.
I have a sense that it really
means something to him," one
student said.
"He's interested in a lot
more than just academic en
deavors," commented a resi
dent of Haus Mitteleuropa
where Weber spoke last
month.
Although Weber "usually
talks 10 to 15 minutes" over
every class, and is accessible to
students, he is a private per
son.
"I rather like to camouflage
myself all the time," he admit
ted. He speaks several lan
guages and "finds privacy in
the Swedish tongue."
Weber has written several
books and numerous articles

and reviews. "His breadth is
extraordinary," said Joe Harris.
But he isn't ready to put it all
down in words yet.
"At my age you don't think
about your own biography,
you just keep on living," said
Weber.

"The man thinks in symbols
and metaphors," said one of
his students, Alan Talbott.
"He's made a marvelous con
tribution to the German De
partment in such a short time,"
added Joe Harris, associate
professor of English.
Judging from these com
ments, visiting Prof. Gerd

Weber, Scandinavianist and
medievalist at the Johann-
Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat
in Frankfurt, has made quite an
impression this quarter.
"I'm just a guest here. The
only thing that is me is the mail
and my keys," said Weber
modestly. He was invited here
to replace Theodore An
dersson who is on leave this

quarter. Weber is teaching a
course on European, especially
Nordic, symbolism in literature
and art about 1900.
In the classroom, Weber
completely wipes away the
usual regiment of a lecturing
professor. He rocks back and
forth at the edge of a desk, urg
ing on the comments of the 12
students assembled to explore

the works of Strindberg and Ib
sen.
Weber began specializing in
Nordic studies as a student in
Frankfurt. He chose medieval
literature "as a matter of
chance. The students in Ger
many demanded it. It came
partly by force and then I came
to like it,"he said.
He stressed the importance
of studying literature. "Litera
ture is part of our human cul
ture. When human beings lose
their historical perspective,
they become one
dimentional," he argued.
Weber was born in 1942 in
Offenbach. "As a boy, I liked to
go out to the country. It's dif
ficult to do now in Germany —
there's no country left.
"I was growing up in idyllic
surroundings when everyone
else was struggling to get away
from the war. I am very fond of
nature. I can sit on cliffs and
enjoy it. But, I am not a
naturalist," he said.
Weber attended Oxford and
University of Salamanca. He
was "infatuated with the
Spanish culture," and rather
fancied himself starting a
career in Spanish studies. His
teaching career includes two
years in Sweden and five years

as a full professor at the Uni
versitat in Frankfurt where he
received his doctorate in 1972.
Weber has integrated his
work with pleasure. "My job, is
in part, my hobby," he
explained. "I go to auctions of
oriental rugs, not to buy, but
because I like the patterns. I
travel to talk to people of
foreign cultures and investi
gate their minds."
Although Weber studies
Germanic poetry, he does not
compose it. "Learning about
all these things interferes with
my own creativity," he confes
sed. He also enjoys painting
and tennis.
Weber taught at the Univer
sity of Uppsala in Sweden and
found the people "shy and re
stricted. The girls don't live up
to the European image," he
added.
Weber described Stanford as
a "large monastery" where the
students are "committed to
learning."
"There is a real desire for
knowledge here. The ap
proach is more naive. It's fas
cinating for a teacher."
Because the German De
partment here has a pre
arranged schedule, Weber is
"less free to teach what I want

here." He was planning to
teach a graduate seminar on
Germanic poetry but all the
prospective students are over
seas this quarter.
