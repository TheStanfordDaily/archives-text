# Aurora newspaper offers forum for women's views

### GAYLE MAYERS 
Aurora, now in its second year of publication,
is a newspaper designed to provide a forum for
women's views.
Aurora, named after the Roman mythological
goddess of dawn, is published twice per quarter
bya staff ofabout 20 women, including students
and community members. The newspaper in
cludes contributions of articles, poetry, photo
graphs and graphics that present social issues
from a woman's perspective.
According to one of its founders, Lisa Atlas,
the paper is run by a collective which meets
weekly at its office at the Center for Research on
Women in Jordan Quad.
"All editorial decisions require a consensus of
the Aurora staff. We want to avoid a hierarchical
situation and let diverse opinions be expres
sed," Atlas said.
More creativity
She added thatthis technique is time consum
ing and tiring, but allows greater creativity and
diverse viewpoints.
Production is divided into three separate
cooperatives of editing, business and advertis
ing, but there is great flexibility between jobs,
according to Atlas. She said it has been a valu
able experience to learn all aspects of producing
a newspaper.
According to AdrienneTorf, another founder,
Aurora's main problem has been funding be
cause "conventional means of getting money
are not available."
Funding
Torf said last year Aurora received money
from the ASSU Publications Board, but has not
yet received any money from the board this

year. The newspaper also received money from
SCIRE as an "innovative seed project," but this
money was only available for one year.
Last year's budget was approximately $4000
including revenue from advertisement sales and
fundraising activities.
"With a circulation of 5000 we cannot raise
advertising rates," Torf said. To raise money to
meet this year's expenses, "we are selling spon
sorships to people interested in seeing Aurora
continue," she said.
Excludes men
There are no men on the staff and no con
tributions are accepted from men. Although
male participation is frequently discussed, Atlas
said the consensus has been to exclude men.
Atlas said she sees Aurora as a newspaper run
and distributed by women in a media world
dominated by men. However, she emphasized
that Aurora encourages men to read the paper
and hopes it will increase their awareness of
issues in relation to women.
According to Atlas, most of the women see
themselves as feminists, but ideas about wo
men's issues differ within the staff.
Combat sexism
Atlas sees Aurora as one way to attempt to
combat sexism on campus. She emphasized Au
rora's educational role of highlighting issues,
promoting discussion and advocating action.
According to Torf, "Aurora's ability to combat
sexism on campus is not on an institutional level
but on a personal level because people who
read the paper will have a chance to recognize
sexism in their lives."
Staff members stressed the need for greater
feedback from readers to enable Aurora to more
accurately assess its impact on campus.
