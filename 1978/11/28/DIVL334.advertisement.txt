Dear Max, v
To tone down the image and noise level, yet
keep that feeling of power, trade for a Vespa Scooter. But what
do you want out of life? A good hot bath is a great place to think about it
Vittoria
Dear Vittoria.
I got a Vespa Scooter and I really dig it. I think Vespas are the
answer to all the world's problems, except this one. I miss my '62 Nash
(the seats fold down completely) because I can slip my arm around a
girl's shoulder in a car. but not on a scooter. Is there a solution?
Gary from Wayne University
Dear Gary.
Call me up sometime. But first, go down to your Vespa dealer and take
a look at the nifty baskets he stocks. They're just right for books, a
picnic lunch and a blanket. Get the idea?
