# Supervisor Harvey Milk also slain
## S.F. mayor assassinated 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Mayor George Moscone and
Harvey Milk, the city's first openly homosexual super
visor, were shot to death yesterday in City Hall and a
former city supervisor who wanted his job back was
arrested 45 minutes later.
Police said Dan White, 32, a one-time city police of
ficerand fire fighter, was booked for investigation of the
murders after he turned himself in to police at a station
eight blocks from City Hall.
The murders stunned the city, still reeling from the
murder-suicides in Guyana of more than 900 members
of the Peoples Temple, headquartered here.
Between 25,000 and 40,000 tearful San Franciscans
gathered in front of City Hall last night to mourn the
assassinations.
Singing "We Shall Overcome," thousands of people
carrying lighted candles massed on Castro Street in the
heart of the city's homosexual community where Milk
lived and worked. The people marched arm-in-arm
down Market Street to City Hall, about two miles away.
The tears were for both Milk, and Moscone, a strong
supporter of gay rights.
"This is an unparalleled time in San Francisco," a red
eyed Dianne Feinstein, president of the Board of Super
visors and now acting mayor, said in a special meeting of
the board after the murders.
"If there was ever a time for this city to pull itself
together...this is that time."
Resigned
Police and city officials said White resigned from the
Board of Supervisors Nov. 10, citing financial reasons.
He then asked for his job back and was meeting with
Moscone in a back conference room of the mayor's
officd when the shooting occurred shortly before 11
a.m.
Moscone, 49, had scheduled an 11:30 a.m. news con
ference to announce White's successor, Don Horanzy,
who was waiting in a nearby office when the shots rang
out. Moscone press secretary Mel Wax speculated that
White was begging the mayor to reconsider and reap
point him. White lost a court bid last Friday to win the
post back.
The press secretary said that although White had
showed up in Moscone's office without an appointment,
no aide sat in the meeting as was normally the case. This
time, "George said there was no need for that," Wax
said.
Moscone's body, shot twice in the head and once in
the left arm, was found minutes later when Deputy
Mayor Rudy Nothenberg walked into the back office for
an 11 a.m. appointment.
After leaving Moscone's office through a back door,
police said, White ran the 99 steps to the supervisors'

office and asked secretary Terry Wallen if he could see
Milk. "He was wild-eyed," Wallen recalled.
Milk shot
Milk and White strolled into White's old office
and three more shots were fired, witnesses said.
Both victims were shot with a .38 caliber revolver.
Milk, 48, had a premonition he would be a target of
violence and made a taped recording Nov. 17, 1977,
which was released yesterday by attorney John Wahl.
In the tape, Milk acknowledged he might be assassi
nated and urged his supporters to channel any anger
into constructive pursuits. He also urged homosexuals
in "the closet," those concealing their sexual identity, to
come out.
"I canot prevent anybody from getting angry, or mad
or frustrated. I can only hope they'll turn that anger and
frustration and madness into something positive, so that
hundreds will step forward," Milk said.
Armed police guard the two official entrances to
City Hall and visitors are required to walk through a
metal detector. But city administrative officer Roger
Boas said White was known by the guards and usually
bypassed the metal detector. Boas also said White could
have entered City Hall via a locked side door to which all
the supervisors had keys.
Immediately after the murders, police issued an all
points bulletin for White who, they said, raced away
from City Hall in a blue car.
"He just walked in the door, put his hands up and
turned himself in," said a police officer at the Northern
Station, minutes from City Hall.
Murder charges
White was questioned at the station, then transferred
to the city's Hall of Justice where he was booked on two
counts of murder and scheduled for medical and
psychiatric testing.
White, considered one of the most conservative of the
11 supervisors, said two weeks ago that he was finan
cially strapped and could no longer support his wife and
4-month-old son on a supervisor's $9600 a year salary.
A fried-potato concession he had just opened on
Fisherman's Wharf was not making up the difference
between that salary and the $19,000 he was making as a
city fire fighter. Under city rules, he had to quit that job
when he was elected to the board in November 1977.
But two days after resigning, he changed his mind and
asked for the job back, saying his 16 brothers and sisters
had offered him up to $10,000 in loans to tide him over.
As late as last Friday White was arguing that his resig
nation was invalid because he submitted it to Moscone
instead of the clerk of the Board of Supervisors. But
Moscone, a liberal, had long been at political odds with
White and reportedly was determined to replace him.
