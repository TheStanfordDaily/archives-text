# Public information center approved
## 
### GAYLE MAYERS 
The proposed construction
of a public information center
on Galvez Street has been ap
proved by the University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation, but Roger
Cairns, senior project planner
in the Facilities Office said he is
trying to reduce the cost of the
project before construction
begins.
The information center is
designed to help orient visitors
to the University. The center
would include campus maps
and telephone services for vis
itor information and direc
tions.
Cairns said that the esti

mated cost of the center is
$24,000, including construc
tion and overhead costs.
A similar facility near Hoover
Pavilion was completed in Oc
tober, 1977 at a cost of $14,000.
The Hoover facility is the only
public information center now
on campus.
Cairns explained that the
higher cost is due to the rise in
material and labor costs, and
also because the Calvez site is
fairly remote and will require
the installation of longer tele
phone and electricity lines.
The Calvez Street site was
chosen by the Committee on
Parking and Transportation,

Cairns explained, because it is
on a major access route to the
campus. Cairns said the com
mittee hopes that in the future
similar centers will be con
structed on other major streets
including Serra Street,
Mayfield Avenue and in a spot
near the Hospital.
Cairns said that in the next
few weeks he hopes to be able
to revise the estimated costs to
avoid any excessive expendi
ture.- Money for the construc
tion will be made available
from funds for general plant
improvement.
No dates for the beginning
of construction have been set
yet, Cairns said.
