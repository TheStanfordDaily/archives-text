# Service offers career planning tips

### MARK VAN OSS 
What should I major in? In
what career would I be the
most happy? What should I
do with my life?
Seeking answers to these
and similar questions, hun
dreds of students visit the
University's Counseling and
Psychological Service
(CAPS) annually in search of
quick answers to questions
they have been asking for
years.
The answers they receive
are quick and free of
charge. But their accuracy
has been questioned.
Some discrepancies
"Yes, there are dis
crepancies," said )ane Pao,
who administers the voca
tional interest surveys at
CAPS. "No test is perfect.
There is no perfect correla
tion leading to a person's
career choice."
Pao said that at the center
here the tests are used only
as added information, and
serve mainly to facilitate
counseling sessions.
"These aren't diagnostic
tests. They are not some
thing that turn on new lights
or give magic answers," she
said.
Guy Browning, a coun
selor at CAPS, said, "Often
we find that the tests pro
vide a launching point for
discussion. People seem to
be more willing to talk
about themselves when
they have an inventory to
refer to."
Browning said, "I can

look at test results and ask
specific questions about the
student. Often, important
needs are brought up which
would not normally be dis
cussed during the course of
a conversation."
He said that the inven
tories are just one part of
the overall counseling ex
perience, since "you can't
just look at test scores and
hope to make an intelligent
career choice."
A visit to the counseling
center is needed to begin
the counseling process. Lo
cated on Salvatierra, the
center is the scene of all vo
cational counseling and
testing.
Before the actual testing,
the student must meet with
a counselor. There are hun
dreds of available tests that
measure vocational in
terests and the student,
with the counselor's assis
tance, must decide which
tests could be most helpful.
Flexible operation
"How we operate here is
very flexible," Pao said.
"We don't have a standard
battery of tests that we give
to everyone. We try to make
the program as personal as
possible."
The Strong-Campbell Vo
cational Interest Blank and
the Kuder Occupational In
terest Survey are two of the
most popular tests.
"These tests are the most
widely researched, most
carefully studied inven
tories that you will find in
test literature today,"

Browning said.
When taking the Kuder
Inventory, the student is
presented with 100 sets of
activities. In each set the
student is asked to select his
or her most and least prefer
red activity. Answers are
scored by a computer and
scores are returned on a
computer-printed form.
Measuring scores
These scores, according
to the test manual, "repre
sent the degree of agree
ment between your re
sponses and those typical of
hundreds of satisfied
people in each of the listed
occupations."
For instance, if a student
scores highly on the "fire
man scale" it means that he
or she responded to the
questions in much the same
way that satisfied firemen
responded.
The Strong-Campbell
consists of a list of qualities,
characteristics and jobs.
Students are asked to de
cide whether they like what
is listed. This test differs
from the Kuder in compar
ing the student to "people
in-general" and not to
specific occupations.
Both tests are designed to
measure only interests and
not aptitudes. Students who
score highly on the
"mathematician scale" do
not necessarily have
mathematical skill. But their
interests seem to match
those of the mathematicians
on whom the scale was
based.

At this point the actual
counseling comes into play.
"We'll bring up discrepan
cies," Pao said. "There may
be a conflict of interests."
If, for example, a student
wants to go into politics — a
field that demands a certain
amount of aggressiveness
— but scores poorly on "ag
gression scales," then this is
brought to his attention.
"We want the student's
career choice to be part of a
well thought out process,"
Pao said.
She also said that stu
dents must look both at
what they learn from their
test results and what they
discuss with their coun
selor. A student who makes
a career choice based solely
on vocational testing would
be making a big mistake.
'Highly reliable'
Despite minor criticisms
of the tests, they are often
credited as being highly re
liable.
"They sure helped me,"
said one student who took
the tests. "They really didn't
tell me anything that I didn't
already know, but they
helped me define my in
terests and needs."
According to Browning,
many students seem to be
nefit from the tests and the
counseling sessions.
Stanford'svocational test
ing program may not offer
magic answers to every
career problem. But the
center can offer valuable
advice to those who ask.
