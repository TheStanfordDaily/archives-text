# Jahns discusses earthquakes, landslides

### MATTHEW KREPS 
Where would Dean Richard Jahns like to
be if an earthquake hit San Francisco?
"I'd like to be at the top of the Trans
america tower — it would make an in
teresting ride," the dean of the School of
Earth Sciences here said recently.
"If a quake should hit San Francisco,
there would be extensive damage,"
warned Jahns, who has been on numerous
advisory boards studying earthquakes and
other disasters.
"But the University has spent a great
deal of money and taken great caution to
ensure against earthquakes." Part of the
reconstruction presently going on in the
Quad is to ensure against such a possibil
ity, he added.
Jahns will have more time to watch ear
thquakes after Aug. 31,1979, when he said
he plans to leave the dean's office to re
turn to teaching and research fulltime.
Jahns said he will probably retire in 1980
when he reaches retirement age — but not
until he's finished working on a "tre
mendous number of scientific reports" —
and even then, he isn't likely to quit.
While Jahns discounted the potential

damage a quake could cause at Stanford,
he was more concerned about the recent
landslide in the Southern California com
munity of Laguna Beach.
"If people do nothing, we can expect
more slides," he predicted.
lahns explained what he believes
caused the slides: the Laguna Beach
homes were built on a canyon composed
of alternating layers of rock and clay.
Heavy rains soaked the clay making it slip
pery and causing the rock to slide. This
process can occur even after several "dry"
years with little or no rainfall, he said.
|ahns proposed massive landfills to act
as "stoppers" as one solution to the slide
problem.
But Jahns' favorite topic isn't landslides
or earthquakes. Ever since he was a pro
fessor at Cal-Tech in Southern California,
his major contribution to geology has
been in the study of pegmatites — giant
freak crystals found in granite and other
igneous rocks. A 12-foot-high pegmatite is
on display in the basement of the Earth
Sciences building.
Scientists aren't sure how pegmatites
are formed, but Jahns said he has some

theories to test.
As an administrator, scientist and
teacher, )ahns has a reputation for "fair
ness and compassion," according to some
of his colleagues and students.
"He is clearly outstanding in providing
guidance and leadership to the school,"
said Geol™y Prof. William Luth, who has
worked closely with )ahns in pegmatite re
search.
When Jahns came to Stanford in 1965, he
found the plans for the Earth Sciences
building "on the back burners," he said.
By helping to "drum up support" )ahns
was able to watch the building reach com
pletion by 1971.
As a teacher, Jahns "enjoys a rapport
with graduates and undergraduates that
very few other faculty members can
claim," doctoral student Kent McMillan
said.
Jahns enhances his lecture style with
geological field trips. Well-dressed in both
the office and classes, Jahns switches to
khaki shirts and trousers in the field, and
while nearly everyone else trudges along
in hiking boots, Jahns dons an old pair of
tennis sneakers.
