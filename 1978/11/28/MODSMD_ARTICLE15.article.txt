Slanted caption
The picture entitled "Repent
Ye Sinners!" and the adjoining
comment run in the Daily
(Nov. 16) shows an appalling
lack of objectivity on the part of
theDaily. Given the wording of
the article, the reader has no
choice but to conclude that the
Daily considers the man pic
tured (who was not identified,
or, apparently, interviewed) as
a fanatic, and what he is saying
as not worth our attention. A
possible reaction — one, in
fact, which I heard — would be
to assume that he was acting
out a joke.
Assuming that he was not
joking — and being aware of
other individuals who are
doing the same thing with seri
ous intent — it is my opinion
that the Daily is being a great
deal less than professional
when it ridicules this man, who
is being paid very little for
doing something he obviously
believes in (would you risk
being the object of derision for
the Daily's readers for 175 a
week?).
The Daily is not being a good
representative of the Stanford
community — or, for that mat
ter, a good newspaper — when
it treats this and subjects such
as this with flippancy. Being
against "premarital sex, forni
cation and decadence" is not
stupid or worthy of ridicule,
and there is a considerable
portion of the Stanford com
munity who would, if not
applaud his methods, agree
with the "ranting" evangelist's
philosophy. Even if this were
not the case, regardless of the
personal slants of the editorial
staff of the Daily, individuals of
differing opinion and/or lifes
tyle should be able to expect
fair and objective journalistic
treatment from the paper.

Editorial discounts
symbolic gestures
On Tuesday, Nov. 21, the
Daily printed an editorial
patemalistically scolding the
ASSU for considering divest
ment from University holdings
in South Africa. The date
should be remembered as
some final turning point in
Stanford's political awareness.
The editorial implies that such
divestment would be foolish
and risky from a financial point
of view, and nothing but a vain
"symbolic gesture" from the
moral. Apparently, a "strong,
safe and diversified investment
portfolio" has become the ul
timate purpose of student gov
ernment. Apparently, "sym-

bolic gestures" are no longer
proper activities for responsi
ble students. Now that the
Daily has cleared this little
cloud from our sky, we can all
go back to our books.

Emotion in
abortion column
Eugene Ashby (Daily, Nov.
17) has succeeded in adding
another uncritical emotion
packed statement to those
which have already been made
by the anti-abortionists. I see
two problems with his article
which commonly occur in
other "pro-life" arguments.
First, Ashby states his abso
lute, a priori premise: "Life, we
all agree, is sacred." Certainly
such religious terminology is
apt to arouse awe and passion
in persons who have been
conditioned to believe in sac
rality. However, life is not "sac
red," though perhaps a life that
is a happy and fulfilled one, or
one that is filled with compas
sion and the desire to help
others, comes very close.
The unwanted child born
into poverty and/or hostile en
vironmental conditions will
most likely lead a life filled with
misery, as will its mother, who
often seems to be forgotten by
anti-abortionists and male
commentators such as Ashby.
Is suffering also sacred? Why
kid ourselves by believing in
Horatio Alger ideals when the
odds are overwhelmingly
against the underprivileged
and unwanted child leading a
good life?
A second problematic ele
ment in Ashby's letter which fi
gures in other issues besides
that of abortion is Ashby's out
right religious stance on the
matter. In his final paragraph
he rails without reason at per
sons who would "kill our un
born whom God has a hand in
sending to us." He chastises
those who advocate the
banishment of prayer from
public schools as well as the
mention of "God" on coinage
and in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Ashby's statements border on
direct support for a breach of
the Constitutional ideal of sep
aration of church and state. In
deed, the Supreme Court has
decided that prayer and Bible
recitation in public schools is
such a violation.
I am amazed that a scientist
like Ashby could demonstrate
such a lack of intellectual rigor
and skepticism. Does he not
realize that history shows
godism had to be fought when
man made his successive steps

toward science, liberty and re
form? Futhermore, if anything
is a "sin," it is teaching a child
the cruel myth that a god
exists. Paralyzing a child's
mind with the idea that his or
her puppy died "because it is
God's will" or that prayers can
solve his problems is tan
tamount to teaching him/her to
live a lie. Is it right that we con
dition and shackle a young mind
to hold to such unfounded
non-humanistic beliefs?
Ashby asks if America is re
ally the "land of the free." It's a
shame he can't side with free
thinkers in calling for freedom
from the influence of religion
and the painful solutions of the
"moral," "pro-life" preacher.
