"For I was hungry and you gave me
food, I was thirsty and you gave me
drink. ..."
Matthew 25
Last Tuesday (Nov. 21) the Stanford
Committee on Hunger sponsored a day
of fasting on the Stanford Campus. In
the spirit of Thanksgiving students
were reminded that there is much for
which we are to be thankful.
Unfortunately, as in every year past,
after perhaps a few days of contempla
tion, we will go on and live our daily
lives, get caught up in our own melan
cholic misfortunes of the moment and
in a week forget the poor. We will be
lulled by the familiar phrases and calm
ing rhetoric of our political leaders,
until we sink back into the safe medioc
rity of complacency and breath with a
sigh, "the poor are always with us;
there's nothing we can do. . .
And yet the true spirit of Thanksgiv
ing tells us not only to be thankful for
what we have, but to be mindful of the
responsibility that our blessings must
entail.
As a people, the biblical passage
rings true — "unto whom much is gi
ven, much shall be required." Clearly,
we have been given much. It is, how
ever, equally clear, when viewing the
condition of our fellow man through
out the world, that we have not fulfilled
our responsibility.
Our responsibility is not to assume
an attitudeof superiority and "noblesse
oblige" — that we, the wealthy gentry,
the powerful nation, in our preeminant
position can somehow look down upon
the underprivileged classes and nations
of the world, and show them our way to
prosperity and economic growth. Itwas
the unfortunate application of this at

titude that led to the failure of what
otherwise might have been the suc
cessful domestic "War on Poverty" and
Third World development programs in
the '60s.
Our responsibility is rather to wake
up from our complacent acceptance of
the status quo, to re-evaluate our pre
sent attitudes toward the poor, and to
declare that poverty amidst a world of
abundance is an injustice we cannot
and must not accept.
The first step toward fulfilling our re
sponsibility is to recognize the prob
lems of poverty. Unfortunately we are,
today as always, preoccupied with
those domestic problems that affect the
American pocket book directly. The
consumer price index, Dow Jones In
dustrial averages and inflation and un
employment rates — our barometers of
public health — all point to the fact that
our public sector is sick. So, what do we
do? Out of desperation (and with ample
justification), Californians pass Propos
ition 13, the spirit of which passes
through the nation — "government
can't do it, so let's get the bureaucrats
off our backs!"
President Jimmy Carter and the Con
gress join the national frenzy of cutting
taxes. The results? The poorare the first
and the hardest hit. Social services
which affect the politically powerless,
not governmental waste which is per
petrated by the politically powerful, are
ttttWk. -
The facts, statistics and details re
garding poverty are reported week
after week in almost every newspaper,
magazine or evening newscast: at least
25 million Americans live in poverty.
Today, many children in the wealthiest
nation in the world go to school hun
gry-
We have, however, become immune
to such reports, and thus what is
needed is rather an analysis of the ori

gins of poverty both nationally and in
ternationally.
As difficult as it may be to face, we
must realize the fact that poverty has
become an inherent aspect of our
domestic and international economic
system. The gross economic asymetries
between the rich and the poor present
us with the disheartening observation
that we have developed and per
petuated a "zero-sum" economy —
where the wealth of one class or nation
is built upon the poverty of another
class or nation.
Although domestic poverty is more
subtle and less widespread than the
poverty found in such nations as Chad
and Bangladesh, economic disparities
and inequities still exist within the U.S.
Poverty is heavily concentrated among
minority groups — unemployment
among young blacks may reach as high
as 60 percent. Such trends stem from
years of economic and political repres
sion and a clear denial of "equal oppor
tunity."
Domestic poverty is a mere micro
cosm of the poverty that exists interna
tionally. The Washington Post reports
that from 1971 to 1976, the poorest na
tions of the world comprising one bill
ion people showed no real economic
growth. In addition, the national debts
of these Third and Fourth World na
tions have increased. Among the less
developed countries (LDCs), where the
per capita annual gross national pro
duct (GNP) ranges from about $50-500
as compared to a U.S. per capita CNP of
$6,200, malnutrition, starvation and
complete poverty are rife. The LDC s
remain steadily behind the developed
world with little sign of improvement.
The cause of this poverty is built into
the current international economic or
der. The world is becoming more in
terdependent, as evidenced by in

creases in international trade, foreign
investment and transgovernmental de
alings. This interdependence is, how
ever, highly asymetrical. As a result, the
LDC s are much more dependent on
U.S. support than the United States is
on their trade.
The overall result is that the Third
World nations remain in poverty, in
crease their debts and have little
chance to develop to their benefit.
Colonial and imperialistic exploita
tion of Third World raw materials, in
creased dependency of the LDC s on
the United States and ineffective fore
ign aid have left the current world
economic order with intense conflict,
dividing the world into two factions:
poor and rich. Furthermore, within our
own nation conflicts exist between
those who are poor, unemployed or
discriminated against and those who
wish to maintain the status quo.
And so, finally, we are faced with the
harsh realization that we, the affluent
Americans, are on the receiving end of
a system that creates and perpetuates
both wealth and poverty.
In the true spirit of Thanksgiving we
must be mindful of this realization and
the implications that it entails. In so
doing we will be taking the first step
toward adopting the change in attitude
necessary to start solving the problems
of poverty. And in this framework — of
recognizing the reality, sources an(l
origins of poverty — we can 6egft\\o
fulfill our responsibility to assist the
poor, and to heed the philosophic
warning President John Kennedy made
17 years ago:
"If a free society cannot help the
many who are poor, it cannot save the
few who are rich."

sion and a clear denial of "equal oppor
tunity."
Domestic poverty is a mere micro
cosm of the poverty that exists interna
tionally. The Washington Post reports
that from 1971 to 1976, the poorest na
tions of the world comprising one bill
ion people showed no real economic
growth. In addition, the national debts
of these Third and Fourth World na
tions have increased. Among the less
developed countries (LDCs), where the
per capita annual gross national pro
duct (GNP) ranges from about $50-500
as compared to a U.S. per capita CNP of
$6,200, malnutrition, starvation and
complete poverty are rife. The LDC s
remain steadily behind the developed
world with little sign of improvement.
The cause of this poverty is built into
the current international economic or
der. The world is becoming more in
terdependent, as evidenced by in

creases in international trade, foreign
investment and transgovernmental de
alings. This interdependence is, how
ever, highly asymetrical. As a result, the
LDC s are much more dependent on
U.S. support than the United States is
on their trade.
The overall result is that the Third
World nations remain in poverty, in
crease their debts and have little
chance to develop to their benefit.
Colonial and imperialistic exploita
tion of Third World raw materials, in
creased dependency of the LDC s on
the United States and ineffective fore
ign aid have left the current world
economic order with intense conflict,
dividing the world into two factions:
poor and rich. Furthermore, within our
own nation conflicts exist between
those who are poor, unemployed or
discriminated against and those who
wish to maintain the status quo.
And so, finally, we are faced with the
harsh realization that we, the affluent
Americans, are on the receiving end of
a system that creates and perpetuates
both wealth and poverty.
In the true spirit of Thanksgiving we
must be mindful of this realization and
the implications that it entails. In so
doing we will be taking the first step
toward adopting the change in attitude
necessary to start solving the problems
of poverty. And in this framework — of
recognizing the reality, sources an(l
origins of poverty — we can 6egft\\o
fulfill our responsibility to assist the
poor, and to heed the philosophic
warning President John Kennedy made
17 years ago:
"If a free society cannot help the
many who are poor, it cannot save the
few who are rich."

"For I was hungry and you gave me
food, I was thirsty and you gave me
drink. ..."
Matthew 25
Last Tuesday (Nov. 21) the Stanford
Committee on Hunger sponsored a day
of fasting on the Stanford Campus. In
the spirit of Thanksgiving students
were reminded that there is much for
which we are to be thankful.
Unfortunately, as in every year past,
after perhaps a few days of contempla
tion, we will go on and live our daily
lives, get caught up in our own melan
cholic misfortunes of the moment and
in a week forget the poor. We will be
lulled by the familiar phrases and calm
ing rhetoric of our political leaders,
until we sink back into the safe medioc
rity of complacency and breath with a
sigh, "the poor are always with us;
there's nothing we can do. . .
And yet the true spirit of Thanksgiv
ing tells us not only to be thankful for
what we have, but to be mindful of the
responsibility that our blessings must
entail.
As a people, the biblical passage
rings true — "unto whom much is gi
ven, much shall be required." Clearly,
we have been given much. It is, how
ever, equally clear, when viewing the
condition of our fellow man through
out the world, that we have not fulfilled
our responsibility.
Our responsibility is not to assume
an attitudeof superiority and "noblesse
oblige" — that we, the wealthy gentry,
the powerful nation, in our preeminant
position can somehow look down upon
the underprivileged classes and nations
of the world, and show them our way to
prosperity and economic growth. Itwas
the unfortunate application of this at

titude that led to the failure of what
otherwise might have been the suc
cessful domestic "War on Poverty" and
Third World development programs in
the '60s.
Our responsibility is rather to wake
up from our complacent acceptance of
the status quo, to re-evaluate our pre
sent attitudes toward the poor, and to
declare that poverty amidst a world of
abundance is an injustice we cannot
and must not accept.
The first step toward fulfilling our re
sponsibility is to recognize the prob
lems of poverty. Unfortunately we are,
today as always, preoccupied with
those domestic problems that affect the
American pocket book directly. The
consumer price index, Dow Jones In
dustrial averages and inflation and un
employment rates — our barometers of
public health — all point to the fact that
our public sector is sick. So, what do we
do? Out of desperation (and with ample
justification), Californians pass Propos
ition 13, the spirit of which passes
through the nation — "government
can't do it, so let's get the bureaucrats
off our backs!"
President Jimmy Carter and the Con
gress join the national frenzy of cutting
taxes. The results? The poorare the first
and the hardest hit. Social services
which affect the politically powerless,
not governmental waste which is per
petrated by the politically powerful, are
ttttWk. -
The facts, statistics and details re
garding poverty are reported week
after week in almost every newspaper,
magazine or evening newscast: at least
25 million Americans live in poverty.

nation in the world go to school hun
gry-
We have, however, become immune
to such reports, and thus what is
needed is rather an analysis of the ori

gins of poverty both nationally and in
ternationally.
As difficult as it may be to face, we
must realize the fact that poverty has
become an inherent aspect of our
domestic and international economic
system. The gross economic asymetries
between the rich and the poor present
us with the disheartening observation
that we have developed and per
petuated a "zero-sum" economy —
where the wealth of one class or nation
is built upon the poverty of another
class or nation.
Although domestic poverty is more
subtle and less widespread than the
poverty found in such nations as Chad
and Bangladesh, economic disparities
and inequities still exist within the U.S.
Poverty is heavily concentrated among
minority groups — unemployment
among young blacks may reach as high
as 60 percent. Such trends stem from
years of economic and political repres
sion and a clear denial of "equal oppor
tunity."

prosperity and economic growth. Itwas
the unfortunate application of this at

titude that led to the failure of what
otherwise might have been the suc
cessful domestic "War on Poverty" and
Third World development programs in
the '60s.
Our responsibility is rather to wake
up from our complacent acceptance of
the status quo, to re-evaluate our pre
sent attitudes toward the poor, and to
declare that poverty amidst a world of
abundance is an injustice we cannot
and must not accept.
The first step toward fulfilling our re
sponsibility is to recognize the prob
lems of poverty. Unfortunately we are,
today as always, preoccupied with
those domestic problems that affect the
American pocket book directly. The
consumer price index, Dow Jones In
dustrial averages and inflation and un
employment rates — our barometers of
public health — all point to the fact that
our public sector is sick. So, what do we
do? Out of desperation (and with ample
justification), Californians pass Propos
ition 13, the spirit of which passes
through the nation — "government
can't do it, so let's get the bureaucrats
off our backs!"
President Jimmy Carter and the Con
gress join the national frenzy of cutting
taxes. The results? The poorare the first
and the hardest hit. Social services
which affect the politically powerless,
not governmental waste which is per
petrated by the politically powerful, are
ttttWk. -
The facts, statistics and details re
garding poverty are reported week
after week in almost every newspaper,
magazine or evening newscast: at least
25 million Americans live in poverty.
Today, many children in the wealthiest
nation in the world go to school hun
gry-
We have, however, become immune
to such reports, and thus what is
needed is rather an analysis of the ori

gins of poverty both nationally and in
ternationally.
As difficult as it may be to face, we
must realize the fact that poverty has
become an inherent aspect of our
domestic and international economic
system. The gross economic asymetries
between the rich and the poor present
us with the disheartening observation
that we have developed and per
petuated a "zero-sum" economy —
where the wealth of one class or nation
is built upon the poverty of another
class or nation.
Although domestic poverty is more
subtle and less widespread than the
poverty found in such nations as Chad
and Bangladesh, economic disparities
and inequities still exist within the U.S.
Poverty is heavily concentrated among
minority groups — unemployment
among young blacks may reach as high
as 60 percent. Such trends stem from
years of economic and political repres
sion and a clear denial of "equal oppor
tunity."
Domestic poverty is a mere micro
cosm of the poverty that exists interna
tionally. The Washington Post reports
that from 1971 to 1976, the poorest na
tions of the world comprising one bill
ion people showed no real economic
growth. In addition, the national debts
of these Third and Fourth World na
tions have increased. Among the less
developed countries (LDCs), where the
per capita annual gross national pro
duct (GNP) ranges from about $50-500
as compared to a U.S. per capita CNP of
$6,200, malnutrition, starvation and
complete poverty are rife. The LDC s
remain steadily behind the developed
world with little sign of improvement.
The cause of this poverty is built into
the current international economic or
der. The world is becoming more in
terdependent, as evidenced by in

creases in international trade, foreign
investment and transgovernmental de
alings. This interdependence is, how
ever, highly asymetrical. As a result, the
LDC s are much more dependent on
U.S. support than the United States is
on their trade.
The overall result is that the Third
World nations remain in poverty, in
crease their debts and have little
chance to develop to their benefit.
Colonial and imperialistic exploita
tion of Third World raw materials, in
creased dependency of the LDC s on
the United States and ineffective fore
ign aid have left the current world
economic order with intense conflict,
dividing the world into two factions:
poor and rich. Furthermore, within our
own nation conflicts exist between
those who are poor, unemployed or
discriminated against and those who
wish to maintain the status quo.
And so, finally, we are faced with the
harsh realization that we, the affluent
Americans, are on the receiving end of
a system that creates and perpetuates
both wealth and poverty.
In the true spirit of Thanksgiving we
must be mindful of this realization and
the implications that it entails. In so
doing we will be taking the first step
toward adopting the change in attitude
necessary to start solving the problems
of poverty. And in this framework — of
recognizing the reality, sources an(l
origins of poverty — we can 6egft\\o
fulfill our responsibility to assist the
poor, and to heed the philosophic
warning President John Kennedy made
17 years ago:
"If a free society cannot help the
many who are poor, it cannot save the
few who are rich."

food, I was thirsty and you gave me

Last Tuesday (Nov. 21) the Stanford
Committee on Hunger sponsored a day
of fasting on the Stanford Campus. In
the spirit of Thanksgiving students
were reminded that there is much for
which we are to be thankful.
Unfortunately, as in every year past,
after perhaps a few days of contempla
tion, we will go on and live our daily
lives, get caught up in our own melan
cholic misfortunes of the moment and
in a week forget the poor. We will be
lulled by the familiar phrases and calm
ing rhetoric of our political leaders,
until we sink back into the safe medioc
rity of complacency and breath with a
sigh, "the poor are always with us;
there's nothing we can do. . .
And yet the true spirit of Thanksgiv
ing tells us not only to be thankful for
what we have, but to be mindful of the
responsibility that our blessings must
entail.
As a people, the biblical passage
rings true — "unto whom much is gi
ven, much shall be required." Clearly,
we have been given much. It is, how
ever, equally clear, when viewing the
condition of our fellow man through
out the world, that we have not fulfilled
our responsibility.
Our responsibility is not to assume
an attitudeof superiority and "noblesse
oblige" — that we, the wealthy gentry,
the powerful nation, in our preeminant
position can somehow look down upon
the underprivileged classes and nations
of the world, and show them our way to
prosperity and economic growth. Itwas
the unfortunate application of this at

titude that led to the failure of what
otherwise might have been the suc
