## Dissident Russian author views two Stanford rallies 
### 
I visited two political rallies,
one after the other, at Stan
ford. At the first, Sanya Slepak
spoke about the persecutions
of Jews in the USSR — and in
particular about the fate of his
parents, who were exiled to
Eastern Siberia.
After his speech I asked
Slepak whether he considers
that the attempt to give Ameri
cans the impression that in the
USSR only the Jews are perse
cuted and only they are fight
ing — is erroneous, even from

the point of view of the Soviet
Jews themselves. He agreed
with me.
It is possible to divide the
Jews who wish to emigrate
from the USSR into two
groups: those who wait pas
sively — sometimes years —
not only never uttering a single
word of protest, but at every
step emphasizing their loyalty
to the authorities; and those
who actively strive for the right
to emigrate both for them
selves and for others, appeal

ing to world public opinion. It
is precisely these Jews who
have achieved — for them
selves and for the passive ones
— the right to emigrate from
the country. The very logic of
opposition leads them into col
laboration with those who are
fighting not only for Jewish or
Ukranian or Russian rights, but
for human rights in general.
It is not surprising, that pre
cisely this active portion of the
Jewry is subjected to persecu
tion by the authorities; at times
the authorities can even make
concessions to passive Jews,
knowing that as soon as they
succeed in stopping up the
mouths of the activists, it will
be possible to ignore the
"nonvocals" completely. And
most of all, the authorities fear
a fusion of the Jewish move
ment with the Soviet move
ment for human rights. Unfor
tunately, the position of Israel
on this question, followed by
the majority of American
Jewish organizations, concurs
with the point of view of the
Soviet government.
Even if these organizations
take up the defense of a Jew
who is participating in the
human rights movement, they
avoid mentioning this in
volvement and stress only the
fact that he defended the rights
of Jews. Thus, in defending
Anatoly Sharansky — one of
the organizers of a Helsinki
human rights group — these
organizations not only did not
mention those other particip
ants in the group who were ar
rested together with him, like
Yuri Orlov and Alexander
Cinsburg, but they remained
silent about Sharansky's own
participation. The Soviet au
thorities, for their part, also
tried to divorce these affairs
since it is easier to deal with
them separately.
The argument of these or

ganizations — that the Jewish
problem has existed for several
millenia and in many coun
tries, and for this reason alone
is international, while the posi
tion of other Soviet peoples is
an internal affair of the USSR —
does not seem convincing to
me.
The question of human
rights, wherever they are in
fringed upon, is an interna
tional question, and here it is
necessary to stand on princi-

raid that if Sakharov
were to be arrested,
not a single Jewish
organization in the
U.S.A. would step

pie, and not on a pragmatic
point of view. It is absolutely
clear that every nationality and
every country focus more on
those infringements which
immediately concern them,
but this does not mean that
they have to show indifference
to the others. If we stand on
the point of view that it is
necessary to defend the Jews
and to brush aside the non
lews, or that it is necessary to
defend the Moslems and to
brush aside the Christians, or
that it is necessary to defend
the blacks and to brush aside
the whites, or that it is neces
sary to defend the Russians and
to brush aside the Jews, then in
this case we would have to
brush aside the whole problem
of human rights.
If the Jews appeal for sup

port to many non-Jewish
groups in the world and are
met with this support, then
others have a right to count on
their support. The Nobel Peace
Laureate Andrew Sakharov,
over the course of many years,
has come out in support of the
Jews in the Soviet Union. I am
very much afraid that if he were
to be arrested, not a single
Jewish organization in the U.S.
would step forward in his sup
port for the simple reason that
he is not a Jew.
Three leading American
magazines, Newsweek, Time,
and U.S. News and World Re
port, consecutively asked me
for an article about the trials of
Orlov, Ginsburg and
Sharansky, and consecutively
refused it because I criticized
the attitude of American
Jewish organizations in the ar
ticle. If the Jews in the U.S. play
the role as the sacred
cows in India, then it is very sad
for them. The fear of criticism
— especially criticism coming
from a friend — is a sign of
weakness, and not of strength.
In the USSR I fought to
gether with the Jews for our
common freedom, and what I
have run up against in the U.S.
has left me perplexed. It seems
to me, that one of the lessons
of the tragedy suffered by the
European Jews is that it is
necessary not to work sepa
rately but to join with those
who are working for freedom
and human dignity indepen
dent of religion and race.
After national sectarianism I
was able to become ac
quainted with an ideological
brand at the second political
rally I visited. Jane Fonda had
10 times more listeners than
Sanya Slepak because, as I was
told, she is a famous actress.
While I was still in Siberian
exile, I saw one of her films,
but next to her father she

seemed colorless, and I went
not to see an actress, but to
hear a leftist of the epoch
of the Vietnam war, about
whom I had read so much in
the Soviet press.
I wasn't sorry that I went:
Jane Fonda is a good speaker
with a strong voice, exact ges
tures and most important,
wonderful articulation. Hers
was the first speech that I un
derstood fully in English. I
agree that there is danger in
alienation and inaction, but as
a whole her approach seemed
to me demagogic, simplistic
and one-sided.

The onesidedness
of Fonda's speech,
however, surprised
me most of all: as if
the world ends
when it reaches the
borders of the
Communist coun
tries.

The Russian writer Andrey
Sinyavsky introduced the term
"a detective understanding of
history." Radicals, both left
and right-wing, understand
history as a result of a conspi
racy of "dark forces" —
Zionists or communists, im
perialists or socialists, "big
corporations" or Masons. Alas,
the more attractive the expla
nation, the further it is from re
ality. Above all, imperfect
human nature resists "in
volvement" in making deci
sions: man does not like to
make sustained efforts, fears
responsibility, poorly orients
himself in his surrounding
world, and of his own free will

strives as much as possible to
narrow the sphere of his activ
ity. As one of my prisori
cellmates told me: the less you
know, the easier it is to live.
The onesidedness of Jane
Fonda's speech, however, sur
prised me most of all: as if the
world ends when it reaches the
borders of the Communist
countries. Speaking about the
infringements of human rights
in the Philippines or in Chile,
and about the role of American
corporations in these couni
tries, she didn't touch on suchj
infringements in the USSR or
'on the efforts of American cor
porations to utilize the cheap
Soviet labor force and market,
just as they utilize them in the
Philippines and do this,
moreover, at the expense of
American taxpayers, insofar as
the government must guaran
tee them capital investment. It
is interesting that the audience
didn't have a single question
about the USSR. California is 3
lucky state if it can permit itself
the luxury not to be interested
in this giant.
However, it seems very im-"
portant to me that a dialogue
take place not only between
the leaders of the U.S. and
USSR, but also between the in
ternal critics of both systems. I
approached Jane Fonda to ask
whether I could write her a let
ter, but I scarcely said twc|
words when she, without
answering, ran away from me. |

liteness of Americans even
when they are in a hurry, that |

But since Russians are persisj

— so far unanswered.

others have a right to count on
their support. The Nobel Peace
Laureate Andrew Sakharov,
over the course of many years,
has come out in support of the
Jews in the Soviet Union. I am
very much afraid that if he were
to be arrested, not a single
Jewish organization in the U.S.
would step forward in his sup
port for the simple reason that
he is not a Jew.
Three leading American
magazines, Newsweek, Time,
and U.S. News and World Re
port, consecutively asked me
for an article about the trials of
Orlov, Ginsburg and
Sharansky, and consecutively
refused it because I criticized
the attitude of American
Jewish organizations in the ar
ticle. If the Jews in the U.S. play
the role as the sacred
cows in India, then it is very sad
for them. The fear of criticism
— especially criticism coming
from a friend — is a sign of
weakness, and not of strength.
In the USSR I fought to
gether with the Jews for our
common freedom, and what I
have run up against in the U.S.
has left me perplexed. It seems
to me, that one of the lessons
of the tragedy suffered by the
European Jews is that it is
necessary not to work sepa
rately but to join with those
who are working for freedom
and human dignity indepen
dent of religion and race.
After national sectarianism I
was able to become ac
quainted with an ideological
brand at the second political
rally I visited. Jane Fonda had
10 times more listeners than
Sanya Slepak because, as I was
told, she is a famous actress.
While I was still in Siberian
exile, I saw one of her films,
but next to her father she

seemed colorless, and I went
not to see an actress, but to
hear a leftist of the epoch
of the Vietnam war, about
whom I had read so much in
the Soviet press.
I wasn't sorry that I went:
Jane Fonda is a good speaker
with a strong voice, exact ges
tures and most important,
wonderful articulation. Hers
was the first speech that I un
derstood fully in English. I
agree that there is danger in
alienation and inaction, but as
a whole her approach seemed
to me demagogic, simplistic
and one-sided.

The onesidedness
of Fonda's speech,
however, surprised
me most of all: as if
the world ends
when it reaches the
borders of the
Communist coun
tries.

The Russian writer Andrey
Sinyavsky introduced the term
"a detective understanding of
history." Radicals, both left
and right-wing, understand
history as a result of a conspi
racy of "dark forces" —
Zionists or communists, im
perialists or socialists, "big
corporations" or Masons. Alas,
the more attractive the expla
nation, the further it is from re
ality. Above all, imperfect
human nature resists "in
volvement" in making deci
sions: man does not like to
make sustained efforts, fears
responsibility, poorly orients
himself in his surrounding
world, and of his own free will

strives as much as possible to
narrow the sphere of his activ
ity. As one of my prisori
cellmates told me: the less you
know, the easier it is to live.
The onesidedness of Jane
Fonda's speech, however, sur
prised me most of all: as if the
world ends when it reaches the
borders of the Communist
countries. Speaking about the
infringements of human rights
in the Philippines or in Chile,
and about the role of American
corporations in these couni
tries, she didn't touch on suchj
infringements in the USSR or
'on the efforts of American cor
porations to utilize the cheap
Soviet labor force and market,
just as they utilize them in the
Philippines and do this,
moreover, at the expense of
American taxpayers, insofar as
the government must guaran
tee them capital investment. It
is interesting that the audience
didn't have a single question
about the USSR. California is 3
lucky state if it can permit itself
the luxury not to be interested
in this giant.
However, it seems very im-"
portant to me that a dialogue
take place not only between
the leaders of the U.S. and
USSR, but also between the in
ternal critics of both systems. I
approached Jane Fonda to ask
whether I could write her a let
ter, but I scarcely said twc|
words when she, without
answering, ran away from me. |

(Andrei Amalrik is a Russiari
writer and dissident who wasi
expelled from the Soviet Union
in 1976. He is presently a w's/f-J
ing fellow at the Hoover Instil
tute.) J
I visited two political rallies,
one after the other, at Stan
ford. At the first, Sanya Slepak
spoke about the persecutions
of Jews in the USSR — and in
particular about the fate of his
parents, who were exiled to
Eastern Siberia.
After his speech I asked
Slepak whether he considers
that the attempt to give Ameri
cans the impression that in the
USSR only the Jews are perse
cuted and only they are fight
ing — is erroneous, even from

the point of view of the Soviet
Jews themselves. He agreed
with me.
It is possible to divide the
Jews who wish to emigrate
from the USSR into two
groups: those who wait pas
sively — sometimes years —
not only never uttering a single
word of protest, but at every
step emphasizing their loyalty
to the authorities; and those
who actively strive for the right
to emigrate both for them
selves and for others, appeal

ing to world public opinion. It
is precisely these Jews who
have achieved — for them
selves and for the passive ones
— the right to emigrate from
the country. The very logic of
opposition leads them into col
laboration with those who are
fighting not only for Jewish or
Ukranian or Russian rights, but
for human rights in general.
It is not surprising, that pre
cisely this active portion of the
Jewry is subjected to persecu
tion by the authorities; at times
the authorities can even make
concessions to passive Jews,
knowing that as soon as they
succeed in stopping up the
mouths of the activists, it will
be possible to ignore the
"nonvocals" completely. And
most of all, the authorities fear
a fusion of the Jewish move
ment with the Soviet move
ment for human rights. Unfor
tunately, the position of Israel
on this question, followed by
the majority of American
Jewish organizations, concurs
with the point of view of the
Soviet government.
Even if these organizations
take up the defense of a Jew
who is participating in the
human rights movement, they
avoid mentioning this in
volvement and stress only the
fact that he defended the rights
of Jews. Thus, in defending
Anatoly Sharansky — one of
the organizers of a Helsinki
human rights group — these
organizations not only did not
mention those other particip
ants in the group who were ar
rested together with him, like
Yuri Orlov and Alexander
Cinsburg, but they remained
silent about Sharansky's own
participation. The Soviet au
thorities, for their part, also
tried to divorce these affairs
since it is easier to deal with
them separately.
The argument of these or

ganizations — that the Jewish
problem has existed for several
millenia and in many coun
tries, and for this reason alone
is international, while the posi
tion of other Soviet peoples is
an internal affair of the USSR —
does not seem convincing to
me.
The question of human
rights, wherever they are in
fringed upon, is an interna
tional question, and here it is
necessary to stand on princi-

raid that if Sakharov
were to be arrested,

pie, and not on a pragmatic
point of view. It is absolutely
clear that every nationality and
every country focus more on
those infringements which
immediately concern them,
but this does not mean that
they have to show indifference
to the others. If we stand on
the point of view that it is
necessary to defend the Jews
and to brush aside the non
lews, or that it is necessary to
defend the Moslems and to
brush aside the Christians, or
that it is necessary to defend
the blacks and to brush aside
the whites, or that it is neces
sary to defend the Russians and
to brush aside the Jews, then in
this case we would have to
brush aside the whole problem
of human rights.
If the Jews appeal for sup

port to many non-Jewish
groups in the world and are
met with this support, then
others have a right to count on
their support. The Nobel Peace
Laureate Andrew Sakharov,
over the course of many years,
has come out in support of the

(Andrei Amalrik is a Russiari
writer and dissident who wasi
expelled from the Soviet Union
in 1976. He is presently a w's/f-J
ing fellow at the Hoover Instil
tute.) J
I visited two political rallies,
one after the other, at Stan
ford. At the first, Sanya Slepak
spoke about the persecutions
of Jews in the USSR — and in
particular about the fate of his
parents, who were exiled to
Eastern Siberia.
After his speech I asked
Slepak whether he considers
that the attempt to give Ameri
cans the impression that in the
USSR only the Jews are perse
cuted and only they are fight
ing — is erroneous, even from

the point of view of the Soviet
Jews themselves. He agreed
with me.
It is possible to divide the
Jews who wish to emigrate
from the USSR into two
groups: those who wait pas
sively — sometimes years —
not only never uttering a single
word of protest, but at every
step emphasizing their loyalty
to the authorities; and those
who actively strive for the right
to emigrate both for them
selves and for others, appeal

ing to world public opinion. It
is precisely these Jews who
have achieved — for them
selves and for the passive ones
— the right to emigrate from
the country. The very logic of
opposition leads them into col
laboration with those who are
fighting not only for Jewish or
Ukranian or Russian rights, but
for human rights in general.
It is not surprising, that pre
cisely this active portion of the
Jewry is subjected to persecu
tion by the authorities; at times
the authorities can even make
concessions to passive Jews,
knowing that as soon as they
succeed in stopping up the
mouths of the activists, it will
be possible to ignore the
"nonvocals" completely. And
most of all, the authorities fear
a fusion of the Jewish move
ment with the Soviet move
ment for human rights. Unfor
tunately, the position of Israel
on this question, followed by
the majority of American
Jewish organizations, concurs
with the point of view of the
Soviet government.
Even if these organizations
take up the defense of a Jew
who is participating in the
human rights movement, they
avoid mentioning this in
volvement and stress only the
fact that he defended the rights
of Jews. Thus, in defending
Anatoly Sharansky — one of
the organizers of a Helsinki
human rights group — these
organizations not only did not
mention those other particip
ants in the group who were ar
rested together with him, like
Yuri Orlov and Alexander
Cinsburg, but they remained
silent about Sharansky's own
participation. The Soviet au
thorities, for their part, also
tried to divorce these affairs
since it is easier to deal with
them separately.
The argument of these or

ganizations — that the Jewish
problem has existed for several
millenia and in many coun
tries, and for this reason alone
is international, while the posi
tion of other Soviet peoples is
an internal affair of the USSR —
does not seem convincing to
me.
The question of human
rights, wherever they are in
fringed upon, is an interna
tional question, and here it is
necessary to stand on princi-

pie, and not on a pragmatic
point of view. It is absolutely
clear that every nationality and
every country focus more on
those infringements which
immediately concern them,
but this does not mean that
they have to show indifference
to the others. If we stand on
the point of view that it is
necessary to defend the Jews
and to brush aside the non
lews, or that it is necessary to
defend the Moslems and to
brush aside the Christians, or
that it is necessary to defend
the blacks and to brush aside
the whites, or that it is neces
sary to defend the Russians and
to brush aside the Jews, then in
this case we would have to
brush aside the whole problem
of human rights.
If the Jews appeal for sup

port to many non-Jewish
groups in the world and are
met with this support, then
others have a right to count on
their support. The Nobel Peace
Laureate Andrew Sakharov,
over the course of many years,
has come out in support of the
Jews in the Soviet Union. I am
very much afraid that if he were
to be arrested, not a single
Jewish organization in the U.S.
would step forward in his sup
port for the simple reason that
he is not a Jew.
Three leading American
magazines, Newsweek, Time,
and U.S. News and World Re
port, consecutively asked me
for an article about the trials of
Orlov, Ginsburg and
Sharansky, and consecutively
refused it because I criticized
the attitude of American
Jewish organizations in the ar
ticle. If the Jews in the U.S. play
the role as the sacred
cows in India, then it is very sad
for them. The fear of criticism
— especially criticism coming
from a friend — is a sign of
weakness, and not of strength.
In the USSR I fought to
gether with the Jews for our
common freedom, and what I
have run up against in the U.S.
has left me perplexed. It seems
to me, that one of the lessons
of the tragedy suffered by the
European Jews is that it is
necessary not to work sepa
rately but to join with those
who are working for freedom
and human dignity indepen
dent of religion and race.
After national sectarianism I
was able to become ac
quainted with an ideological
brand at the second political
rally I visited. Jane Fonda had
10 times more listeners than
Sanya Slepak because, as I was
told, she is a famous actress.
While I was still in Siberian
exile, I saw one of her films,
but next to her father she

seemed colorless, and I went
not to see an actress, but to
hear a leftist of the epoch
of the Vietnam war, about
whom I had read so much in
the Soviet press.
I wasn't sorry that I went:
Jane Fonda is a good speaker
with a strong voice, exact ges
tures and most important,
wonderful articulation. Hers
was the first speech that I un
derstood fully in English. I
agree that there is danger in
alienation and inaction, but as
a whole her approach seemed
to me demagogic, simplistic
and one-sided.

The onesidedness
of Fonda's speech,
however, surprised
me most of all: as if
the world ends
when it reaches the
borders of the
Communist coun
tries.

The Russian writer Andrey
Sinyavsky introduced the term
"a detective understanding of
history." Radicals, both left
and right-wing, understand
history as a result of a conspi
racy of "dark forces" —
Zionists or communists, im
perialists or socialists, "big
corporations" or Masons. Alas,
the more attractive the expla
nation, the further it is from re
ality. Above all, imperfect
human nature resists "in
volvement" in making deci
sions: man does not like to
make sustained efforts, fears
responsibility, poorly orients
himself in his surrounding
world, and of his own free will

strives as much as possible to
narrow the sphere of his activ
ity. As one of my prisori
cellmates told me: the less you
know, the easier it is to live.
The onesidedness of Jane
Fonda's speech, however, sur
prised me most of all: as if the
world ends when it reaches the
borders of the Communist
countries. Speaking about the
infringements of human rights
in the Philippines or in Chile,
and about the role of American
corporations in these couni
tries, she didn't touch on suchj
infringements in the USSR or
'on the efforts of American cor
porations to utilize the cheap
Soviet labor force and market,
just as they utilize them in the
Philippines and do this,
moreover, at the expense of
American taxpayers, insofar as
the government must guaran
tee them capital investment. It
is interesting that the audience
didn't have a single question

U.S.A. would step
forward in his sup
port . . c.

pie, and not on a pragmatic
point of view. It is absolutely
clear that every nationality and
every country focus more on
those infringements which
immediately concern them,
but this does not mean that
they have to show indifference
to the others. If we stand on
the point of view that it is
necessary to defend the Jews
and to brush aside the non
lews, or that it is necessary to
defend the Moslems and to
brush aside the Christians, or
that it is necessary to defend
the blacks and to brush aside
the whites, or that it is neces
sary to defend the Russians and
to brush aside the Jews, then in
this case we would have to
brush aside the whole problem
of human rights.
If the Jews appeal for sup

port to many non-Jewish
groups in the world and are
met with this support, then
others have a right to count on
their support. The Nobel Peace
Laureate Andrew Sakharov,
over the course of many years,
has come out in support of the
Jews in the Soviet Union. I am
very much afraid that if he were
to be arrested, not a single
Jewish organization in the U.S.
would step forward in his sup
port for the simple reason that
he is not a Jew.
Three leading American
magazines, Newsweek, Time,
and U.S. News and World Re
port, consecutively asked me
for an article about the trials of
Orlov, Ginsburg and
Sharansky, and consecutively
refused it because I criticized
the attitude of American
Jewish organizations in the ar
ticle. If the Jews in the U.S. play
the role as the sacred
cows in India, then it is very sad
for them. The fear of criticism
— especially criticism coming
from a friend — is a sign of
weakness, and not of strength.
In the USSR I fought to
gether with the Jews for our
common freedom, and what I
have run up against in the U.S.
has left me perplexed. It seems
to me, that one of the lessons
of the tragedy suffered by the
European Jews is that it is
necessary not to work sepa
rately but to join with those
who are working for freedom
and human dignity indepen
dent of religion and race.
After national sectarianism I
was able to become ac
quainted with an ideological
brand at the second political
rally I visited. Jane Fonda had
10 times more listeners than
Sanya Slepak because, as I was
told, she is a famous actress.
While I was still in Siberian
exile, I saw one of her films,
but next to her father she

seemed colorless, and I went
not to see an actress, but to
hear a leftist of the epoch
of the Vietnam war, about
whom I had read so much in
the Soviet press.
I wasn't sorry that I went:
Jane Fonda is a good speaker
with a strong voice, exact ges
tures and most important,
wonderful articulation. Hers
was the first speech that I un
derstood fully in English. I
agree that there is danger in
alienation and inaction, but as
a whole her approach seemed
to me demagogic, simplistic
and one-sided.

The onesidedness
of Fonda's speech,
however, surprised
me most of all: as if
the world ends
when it reaches the
borders of the
Communist coun
tries.

The Russian writer Andrey
Sinyavsky introduced the term
"a detective understanding of
history." Radicals, both left
and right-wing, understand
history as a result of a conspi
racy of "dark forces" —
Zionists or communists, im
perialists or socialists, "big
corporations" or Masons. Alas,
the more attractive the expla
nation, the further it is from re
ality. Above all, imperfect
human nature resists "in
volvement" in making deci
sions: man does not like to
make sustained efforts, fears
responsibility, poorly orients
himself in his surrounding
world, and of his own free will

strives as much as possible to
narrow the sphere of his activ
ity. As one of my prisori
cellmates told me: the less you
know, the easier it is to live.
The onesidedness of Jane
Fonda's speech, however, sur
prised me most of all: as if the
world ends when it reaches the
borders of the Communist
countries. Speaking about the
infringements of human rights
in the Philippines or in Chile,
and about the role of American
corporations in these couni
tries, she didn't touch on suchj
infringements in the USSR or
'on the efforts of American cor
porations to utilize the cheap
Soviet labor force and market,
just as they utilize them in the
Philippines and do this,
moreover, at the expense of
American taxpayers, insofar as
the government must guaran
tee them capital investment. It
is interesting that the audience
didn't have a single question
about the USSR. California is 3
lucky state if it can permit itself
the luxury not to be interested
in this giant.
However, it seems very im-"
portant to me that a dialogue
take place not only between
the leaders of the U.S. and
USSR, but also between the in
ternal critics of both systems. I
approached Jane Fonda to ask
whether I could write her a let
ter, but I scarcely said twc|
words when she, without
answering, ran away from me. |

liteness of Americans even

— so far unanswered.

in 1976. He is presently a w's/f-J
ing fellow at the Hoover Instil
tute.) J
I visited two political rallies,
one after the other, at Stan
ford. At the first, Sanya Slepak
spoke about the persecutions
of Jews in the USSR — and in
particular about the fate of his
parents, who were exiled to
Eastern Siberia.
After his speech I asked
Slepak whether he considers
that the attempt to give Ameri
cans the impression that in the
USSR only the Jews are perse
cuted and only they are fight
ing — is erroneous, even from

the point of view of the Soviet
Jews themselves. He agreed
with me.
It is possible to divide the
Jews who wish to emigrate
from the USSR into two
groups: those who wait pas
sively — sometimes years —
not only never uttering a single
word of protest, but at every
step emphasizing their loyalty
to the authorities; and those
who actively strive for the right
to emigrate both for them
selves and for others, appeal

ing to world public opinion. It
is precisely these Jews who
have achieved — for them
selves and for the passive ones
— the right to emigrate from
the country. The very logic of
opposition leads them into col
laboration with those who are
fighting not only for Jewish or
Ukranian or Russian rights, but
for human rights in general.
It is not surprising, that pre
cisely this active portion of the
Jewry is subjected to persecu
tion by the authorities; at times
the authorities can even make
concessions to passive Jews,
knowing that as soon as they
succeed in stopping up the
mouths of the activists, it will
be possible to ignore the
"nonvocals" completely. And
most of all, the authorities fear
a fusion of the Jewish move
ment with the Soviet move
ment for human rights. Unfor
tunately, the position of Israel
on this question, followed by
the majority of American
Jewish organizations, concurs
with the point of view of the
Soviet government.
Even if these organizations
take up the defense of a Jew
who is participating in the
human rights movement, they
avoid mentioning this in
volvement and stress only the
fact that he defended the rights
of Jews. Thus, in defending
Anatoly Sharansky — one of
the organizers of a Helsinki
human rights group — these
organizations not only did not
mention those other particip
ants in the group who were ar
rested together with him, like
Yuri Orlov and Alexander
Cinsburg, but they remained
silent about Sharansky's own
participation. The Soviet au
thorities, for their part, also
tried to divorce these affairs
since it is easier to deal with
them separately.
The argument of these or

ganizations — that the Jewish
problem has existed for several
millenia and in many coun
tries, and for this reason alone
is international, while the posi
tion of other Soviet peoples is
an internal affair of the USSR —
does not seem convincing to
me.
The question of human
rights, wherever they are in
fringed upon, is an interna
tional question, and here it is
necessary to stand on princi-
