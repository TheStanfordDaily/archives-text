# Escondido residents decry centralized maintenance

Escondido Village residents are
"outraged" by the quality of mainte
nance care they are receiving under
the University's maintenance cen
tralization plan, according to a village
official.
)on Seigel, president of the Escon
dido Village Council, said more than
60 residents attended a recent meet
ing to complain that the responsive
ness of University personnel has de
creased because of the centralization
of grounds and building mainte
nance.
Residents also charge that the plan
increases costs, Seigel said.
The University consolidated
grounds maintenance in 1976 and
building maintenance this month.
The moves were made to increase
personnel flexibility and to avoid
equipment duplication, according to
Ed Scoles, associate director of ser
vice operations.
The controversy stems from a rent
increase of more than 9 percent for

the 1978-79 year, Seigel explained.
Residents said they object to rent
hikes while there is what they con
sider a decline in services, he said.
They have asked that the consolida
tion approach be reappraised.
Centralization of grounds mainte
nance, designed to control costs, has
not kept them down, Estes said. In
stead, "the figures we have show that
costs are going up."
Director of Service Operations
lason Mavis insisted however that
"consolidation has nothing to do
with increases in rents." He blamed
rent hikes on inflation and expansion
of the amount of maintenance being
done.
But, residents believe the in
creases exceed the inflation rate,
without improved services, Estes
said, adding "We'd like to know
where the money's going."
The centralization plan was carried
out with little forethought, Seigel
claimed. He said costs of centraliza
tion have not been adequately ap

praised.
Scoles said that he recognized the
need for a "thorough accounting of
the costs of maintenance" and is
planning such a study.
The difficulty seems to grow out of
a lack of communication between re
sidents and the administration. Al
though residents are concerned,
Mavis said, he has received virtually
no complaints about centralized
maintenance.
He said that determining whether
grounds maintenance is adequate is
subjective. In some cases, he
thought, care had improved.
Estes said residents hope to re
solve the problem through "regular
channels." But, Seigel said that the
residents are a "volatile group." He
added that contingency plans, in
cluding possible rent strikes in
lanuary and phone calls to adminis
trators, will be discussed at a meeting
next week.
Escondido residents hope to pre
sent their grievances before the next
University trustees meeting, at which
next year's rents will be decided,
Seigel said.
