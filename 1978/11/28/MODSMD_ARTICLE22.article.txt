# 79-76 loss evens season record
## SJS drops Cards in overtime 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
San Jose — San Jose State
forward Wally Rank undid
Stanford last night by coming
off the bench in a second over
time period to score eight
points and bury the Cardinals
79-76 at Independence Fiel
dhouse.
Rank returned to the game
with 4:28 remaining and the
score knotted at 68. A San Jose
free throw put the Spartans on
top but freshman forward
Brian Welch drained a 20-
footer to shift the lead to Stan
ford.
Rank tipped a missed shot in
and Welch answered with two
free throws as Stanford stayed
ahead, 71-70.
When Welch snagged a de
fensive rebound with 2:30 left,
the Cards went into a stall of
fense. It worked — for a mi
nute.
A poorly-judged pass from
guard Wolfe Perry to Welch
was tipped by Spartan Mickey
Jackson, grabbed by Rank and
slammed through the hoop
with 1:23 left.
An offensive foul on Stan

ford forward Kimberly Belton
gave the ball to the Spartans
and Rank canned an 18-foot
jumper. With 50 seconds left,
Rank added a pair of free
throws to extend the Spartan
lead to 77-72, putting them out
of reach.
Rank shared game-high scor
ing honors with Perry, both
finishing with 19 points. Belton
had 16 points and 15 rebounds
while Welch scored 12 and
grabbed 12 boards.
The game was played at In
dependence High School
which was only right since both
teams looked very uncollegiate
last night. Ball handling mis
cues, excessive travelling and
poor passing plagued both
teams while San Jose missed
numerous lay-ins and Stanford
missed its usual load of free
throws.
"We shot something like
10,000 tree throws," said Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso of the
preseason, "and we made 84
percent. And tonight, for the
second game in a row, we're 12
or 13 of 21 (they hit 14)."
Belton, with a career percen

tage of .579 from the foul line,
continued to be particularly
Chamberlainesque, missing all
three attempts against the
Spartans.
"I don't think our offense
played very well tonight," Di-
Biaso said. "Wedidn'texecute.
You see someone take a bad
shot, but sometimes it's be
cause there's an improper pass
or someone is too far out."
Both teams were erratic and
both needed comebacks to
make it to the second over
time.
Stanford, which led by as
many as nine points in the first
half before taking a 34-31 lead
to the locker room at intermis
sion, held a 58-54 lead as time
dwindled during regulation
play. Two 18-footers by SJS's
Douglas Murrey, however,
sent the game into overtime.
San Jose seemed to have
iced its victory when Sid Wil
liams scored on a lay-in to give
the Spartans a 68-64 advantage
with 36 seconds left.
But Daryle Morgan sank two
free throws 13 seconds later
and Belton grabbed an offen

sive rebound and slammed it
through the net with eight sec
onds left.
Note. KZSU's broadcast of
the game last night was cut off
when the telephone company
killed one of its lines. The sta
tion apologized for a listener
inconvenience which was out
of its control.
