# Conditioning methods, self-defense learned
## Students attempt to master martial arts 
### CYNTHIA SANTANA 
Quiet concentration is the
introduction for Karate stu
dents.
Then in segregated, or
ganized groups, Karate-do
students do series of jabs and
stretching exercises. The Roble
gym becomes ignited with the
energy of quickly-delivered
punches and kicks.
"Karate emphasizes linear
techniques, and is very con
cerned about striking with
maximum," says University
graduate George Pegelow,
who heads the martial arts
program here. Aikido, Tai-Chi
Chuan, Karate-do and Chinese
Kenpo, for which club sport
programs operate here, are
just a few of the numerous
martial arts.
There are numerous differ
ences between the arts.
"Aikido involves the use of cir
cular movements, throws and
grabs at joints to subdue an at
tacker. Tai-Chi Chan is an an
cient system of movements for
general health maintenance,
but with applications of self
defense as well. Chinese
Kenpo, derived from Kenpo
Shaolin, a temple Buddha, has
a Chinese basis. A number of
techniques are added from
other systems, adhering to the
philosophy that no one has a
monopoly on the truth,"
Pegelow said. "The significant
philosophy of the arts is non
violence and avoiding conflict
is the highest aim of the arts."
Students here interested in
learning one of the martial arts

may participate in martial arts
club sports. Students can re
ceive academic credit for their
participation in the clubs. Club
instruction is done in classes.
Students at all levels of Ka
rate enroll in one class, which
is then divided into four
groups which simultaneously
workout with different instruc
tors. Regardless of the level of
instruction, individual de
velopment of technique and
self-discipline are stressed.
Pegelow, also head of the
security system at Jasper Ridge,
a biological preserve behind
the University, has been learn
ing Karate forover 15 years. He
is the beginners' instructorand
teaches basic strikes and
punches. A philosophy section
coordinated with workouts
provides "physical examples of
how one can deal with prob
lems one can encounter in a
flexible and spontaneous way
rather than a rigid and mechan
ical way," Pegelow said.
Mark Mir, a graduate student
at San Francisco State Univer
sity, is the advanced level in
structor for the Karate class.
Mir, who has been active in
mastering Karate for 14 years,
teaches advanced sets, forms
and sophisticated Karate
techniques. One exercise stu
dents do in his class entails
kicking badminton birdies to
"develop quick eye reflexes.
What I stress is the economy of
speed. Each person must ad
just physically and learn the
capabilities of his own body.
One's own style rather than an

arranged style is important,"
Mir said.
Mary Crawford, also a Uni
versity graduate, teaches in
termediate level students. "In
Karate a person sets his own
limits, and is always trying to
improve. Martial arts can never
really be mastered," Crawford
said.
Intense competition is not
stressed in the classes. Some
individuals compete on their
own and occasionally dual
meets with UC-Berkeley are
held, but these are considered
learning experiences rather
than competitions. The belt
ranking system is also
downplayed, according to
Pegelow, "as it tends to create
a gap between students and in
structors."
"The most challenging as

pect of Karate is the self
discipline to become totally
consumed in the perfection of
each stroke," Erika Scheimer, a
beginning level freshman said.
"Testing the limits of my own
body to see how much I can do
is most challenging," said
Debra Tong, a third-year
graduate student who has
been taking Karate lessons for
neariy two years.
Students have numerous
reasons for enrolling in Karate
classes here but primary
among them is to learn self
defense techniques. As stu
dents continue, conditioning
and physical activity become
foci for interest in the sport.
"After graduation I hope to
continue working out on a
daily basis and continue to de
velop the self-control and
self-awareness that Karate re

quires," said Phil Davis, a
junior.
For some students, self
defense is not a motive for
learning Karate or other martial
arts. "Self-defense was never
really an objective for me,"
said senior Eric Roth, "I be
came interested in the mys
tique of the martial arts when
George spoke at my freshman
dorm. I have fun with Karate
and I also enjoy being dressed
up in these PJs to jump around
a little."
The martial arts club sports
operate independently from
the University. The Judo Club,
originated in 1%4, spawned
the existing clubs. Appoxi
mately 110 people are currently
involved in the program.
About 20 percent of these are
women.

workout with different instruc
tors. Regardless of the level of
instruction, individual de
velopment of technique and
self-discipline are stressed.
Pegelow, also head of the
security system at Jasper Ridge,
a biological preserve behind
the University, has been learn
ing Karate forover 15 years. He
is the beginners' instructorand
teaches basic strikes and
punches. A philosophy section
coordinated with workouts
provides "physical examples of
how one can deal with prob
lems one can encounter in a
flexible and spontaneous way
rather than a rigid and mechan
ical way," Pegelow said.
Mark Mir, a graduate student
at San Francisco State Univer
sity, is the advanced level in
structor for the Karate class.
Mir, who has been active in
mastering Karate for 14 years,
teaches advanced sets, forms
and sophisticated Karate
techniques. One exercise stu
dents do in his class entails
kicking badminton birdies to
"develop quick eye reflexes.
What I stress is the economy of
speed. Each person must ad
just physically and learn the
capabilities of his own body.
One's own style rather than an

arranged style is important,"
Mir said.
Mary Crawford, also a Uni
versity graduate, teaches in
termediate level students. "In
Karate a person sets his own
limits, and is always trying to
improve. Martial arts can never
really be mastered," Crawford
said.
Intense competition is not
stressed in the classes. Some
individuals compete on their
own and occasionally dual
meets with UC-Berkeley are
held, but these are considered
learning experiences rather
than competitions. The belt
ranking system is also
downplayed, according to
Pegelow, "as it tends to create
a gap between students and in
structors."
"The most challenging as

pect of Karate is the self
discipline to become totally
consumed in the perfection of
each stroke," Erika Scheimer, a
beginning level freshman said.
"Testing the limits of my own
body to see how much I can do
is most challenging," said
Debra Tong, a third-year
graduate student who has
been taking Karate lessons for
neariy two years.
Students have numerous
reasons for enrolling in Karate
classes here but primary
among them is to learn self
defense techniques. As stu
dents continue, conditioning
and physical activity become
foci for interest in the sport.
"After graduation I hope to
continue working out on a
daily basis and continue to de
velop the self-control and
self-awareness that Karate re

quires," said Phil Davis, a
junior.
For some students, self
defense is not a motive for
learning Karate or other martial
arts. "Self-defense was never
really an objective for me,"
said senior Eric Roth, "I be
came interested in the mys
tique of the martial arts when
George spoke at my freshman
dorm. I have fun with Karate
and I also enjoy being dressed
up in these PJs to jump around
a little."
The martial arts club sports
operate independently from
the University. The Judo Club,
originated in 1%4, spawned
the existing clubs. Appoxi
mately 110 people are currently
involved in the program.
About 20 percent of these are
women.

students do series of jabs and

"Karate emphasizes linear
techniques, and is very con
cerned about striking with
maximum," says University
graduate George Pegelow,
who heads the martial arts
program here. Aikido, Tai-Chi
Chuan, Karate-do and Chinese
Kenpo, for which club sport
programs operate here, are
just a few of the numerous
martial arts.
There are numerous differ
ences between the arts.
"Aikido involves the use of cir
cular movements, throws and
grabs at joints to subdue an at
tacker. Tai-Chi Chan is an an
cient system of movements for
general health maintenance,
but with applications of self
defense as well. Chinese
Kenpo, derived from Kenpo
Shaolin, a temple Buddha, has
a Chinese basis. A number of
techniques are added from
other systems, adhering to the
philosophy that no one has a
monopoly on the truth,"
Pegelow said. "The significant
philosophy of the arts is non
violence and avoiding conflict
is the highest aim of the arts."

Pegelow, "as it tends to create
a gap between students and in
structors."
"The most challenging as

pect of Karate is the self
discipline to become totally
consumed in the perfection of
each stroke," Erika Scheimer, a
beginning level freshman said.
"Testing the limits of my own
body to see how much I can do
is most challenging," said
Debra Tong, a third-year
graduate student who has
been taking Karate lessons for
neariy two years.
Students have numerous
reasons for enrolling in Karate
classes here but primary
among them is to learn self
defense techniques. As stu
dents continue, conditioning
and physical activity become
foci for interest in the sport.
"After graduation I hope to
continue working out on a
daily basis and continue to de
velop the self-control and
self-awareness that Karate re

quires," said Phil Davis, a
junior.
For some students, self
defense is not a motive for
learning Karate or other martial
arts. "Self-defense was never
really an objective for me,"
said senior Eric Roth, "I be
came interested in the mys
tique of the martial arts when
George spoke at my freshman
dorm. I have fun with Karate
and I also enjoy being dressed
up in these PJs to jump around
a little."
The martial arts club sports
operate independently from
the University. The Judo Club,
originated in 1%4, spawned
the existing clubs. Appoxi
mately 110 people are currently
involved in the program.
About 20 percent of these are
women.
