# University pledge program will solicit all seniors here

### DAN JACOBS 
The University senior pledge program is kick
ing off its second season, and its chairmen hope
to solicit every senior on campus. Their target :
30 percent participation among campus seniors,
an increase over the 19 percent participation
rate last year.
The pledge program is designed to accustom
undergraduate seniors with the idea of con
tributing money to the University. Roberta
Sueda, 1977-78 chairman of the program said,
"Many students don't realize that tuition pays
only 50 percent of the costs of the University. If
anyone thinks seriously about making* a gift
once, then later, when they have money, they'll
be more forthcoming." Last year Sueda asked
each senior to make a $40 pledge, payable over a
three-year period.
Last year the University received 184 pledges
for a total of approximately $7,000. Opposition
to the program developed as a result of the
University's refusal to divest itself of stock in
corporations which invest in South Africa. The
Rev. Manfred Bahmann, a member of the Un
ited Campus Ministry here, helped spearhead
the protest. He complained that the University
Board of Trustees refused to discuss its invest
ment policy with students. The United Campus
Ministry urged all seniors to return a card, rather

than money, to the University. On the card was a
statement of a student's refusal to give money
until the investment policy was modified.
The protest was successful, according to
Bahmann. From 10 to 15 percent of the senior
class returned the cards. Bahmann said, "The
program was effective inasmuch as it created a
hell of a lot of controversy, including editorial
debates in The Daily. For us to get 19 percent is
really amazing. I don't know if the boycott and
the publicity helped our visibility." Julie Peter
sen, current co-chairman of the drive, com
mented, "The program really has nothing to do
with South Africa."
None of the organizers of the drive is certain
whether the boycott will be renewed this year;
the University investment policy is presently
unchanged, according to Bahmann.
Aside from the boycott, the pledge program
faces the problem of conquering its low visibil
ity as a campus project. Petersen hopes to over
come this problem by more efficient, cen
tralized organization and by personally contact
ing every senior here. She said, "Our goal is to
talk to every senior. We felt that what we got last
year was very good. We are going to aim for
between 25 and 30 percent this year, which
would make our class the best of any classes."
