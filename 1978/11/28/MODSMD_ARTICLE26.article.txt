## Movies/jim mattson 'Violette' offers no easy answers 
### 
Violette's father, assured
that the milky liquid was
medicine to treat "hereditary
syphilis," drank the poison wil
lingly. But her mother, appal
led at its bitter taste, stopped
after drinking just half a glass.
Violette Noziere was only eigh
teen when, for no concrete
reason, she decided to elimi
nate both her parents. If her
reasoning was weak her de
termination was not: she had
to make two separate attempts
to achieve even a partial suc
cess. Violette's triumph was
short lived because her mother
lived to press charges.
French director Claude
Chabrol (who did Les Cousins,
Les Biches, and The Butcher,

among others) has turned the
infamous 1933 murder case
into an unexpectedly thought
ful film. His Violette is a fine
movie, rich with ideas yet offer
ing no facile answers. The best
drama is often that which
shows instead of tells, and that
is what Chabrol has achieved
here.
The audience is told little
about what makes this oddly
vulnerable young murderess
act the way she does; instead,
we are shown her actions and
asked to draw our own conclu
sions. At her trial Violette tells
the judge that she killed her
father to put an end to his in
cestuous advances. Although
we are certain that she is lying
we still hope for the ploy to
work, so good a job has Chab
rol done in portraying the con
fusion of his character.
Huppert
Chabrol, of course, takes full
advantage of the services of
one of the most interesting ac
tresses of today, the twenty
three year old Isabelle Hup
pert. Huppert, a pretty,
round-faced Frenchwoman,

has distinguished herself by
her ability to project herself
into a role with amazing
realism. After seeing her in her
first starring role in The
Lacemaker, it was impossible
to think of the actress as being
anything other than pitifully
shy in real life. Now, after Vio
lette, one is faced with the task
of trying to picture the actress
as anything but a fearful,
strangely guileless perpetrator
of patricide.
Huppert, however, isn't the
only one who gives a fine per
formance in Violette. Stephane
Audran, who also appeared in
Chabrol's Les Biches, does a
magnificent portrayal of Violet
te's mother, capturing the
woman's vengeful rage and her
feelings of guilt that somehow
she might be the reason for her
daughter's act. Jean Carmet,
who plays Violette's father,
gives his character an air of
absent-minded affection to
ward the whims of his daugh
ter. Only Jean-Francois Gar
reaud, as Violette's first lover,
gives a less than strong per
formance, probably because

his character (a small-time
gigolo) lacks the depth that has
been given to the others.
The film is visually rich, as
well, with its period sets and
salmon-toned photography. It
is as though Chabrol intended
to contrast the warmness of his
main character's surroundings
with her constricted, neurotic
world view. This mental state is
also reflected in the film's jolt
ing structure of flash-forwards
and flash-backs, which makes
the devices of filmmaking re
flect on the workings of the
mind and memory.
Violette's greatest ac
complishment is that it makes
the viewer leave the theater
still puzzling over what has
been shown. We know how,
when, and where the girl
committed her murder, and
from these we must determine
why she did it. It is a tribute to
the skill of Chabrol and his en
semble that one leaves feeling
that one has gained some in
sight into the complexities of a
disturbed and yet somehow
very special human being.
(Violette is now playing at the
Clay Theatre in San Francisco.)


Isabelle Huppert plays the titular heroine in Claude Chabrol's Violette Noziere.


The scandalous and vain Lady Kitty, whose infidelity outraged British society, is portrayed by Marrian
Walters in the A.C.T. production of W. Somerset Maugham's 1920s comedy The Circle. The witty satire
opened Nov. 15 at the Geary.
