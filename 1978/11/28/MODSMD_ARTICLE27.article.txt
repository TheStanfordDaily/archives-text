## ACT: in the winner's 'Circle' 
### 
There are old actors and new
actors and the difference isn't
in their ages. It's in the way
they move and speak and play
to an audience. The old ones,
for instance, perform comedy
with stylish delight that re
minds you of 1,000 years of
theater tradition.
That's the kind of actors
needed for W. Somerset
Maugham's The Circle. And
that's the kind ACT offers in its
revival of last season's
smash.
Returning stars William
Paterson, Sydney Walker ana
Marrian Walters dominate this
production. Together, they
work like those music boxes
you can watch and listen to
forever. They trade grunts,
sneers and well-placed jabs as
if they'd done nothing else all
their lives. More important, for

a play so sharply written, they
know when to push a line and
when to let one push itself.
The new Circle players are
less effective, mainly because
of their roles. They must com
pete against that endearing if
exasperating trio of seniors
and Maugham simply didn't
give them the weapons.
As the title implies, he did
give us circles; the parallel
plots involve "love taking a
chance on itself" as Lady Kitty
(Walters) returns to England
after running off 30 years be
fore with her husband's best
friend (Walker). They arrive at
Kitty's son Arnold's (Daniel
Kern) estate, only to find her
husband Clive (Paterson) has
popped in for a surprise visit.
In the midst of this, Arnold's
wife Elizabeth (Barbara Di
rickson) has decided to run

away with the houseguest
(Randall Smith).
Kitty and her lover Porteous
have learned that romance
isn't all it's cracked up to be,
but dreamy and desperately
bored Elizabeth won't heed
their advice. Arnold, however,
listens to his father's tips on
how to keep his wife from fle
eing.
Maugham's other circle is
the charmed one in which the
British upper crust sips tea and
ruins lives with equal abandon.
It seems nothing hurts too
much and no one cares a whole
lot about anything. Only in the
third act, when this magic is
broken do we discover hearts
of gold and venom beneath the
mannered wit.
Walters comes on as a cross
between Phyllis Diller and Au
ntie Mame. Under her rouged

face and — according to Pater
son — soul however, lies
sensitivity and a devoted if
wicked curious interest in
others' welfare.
Paterson's Clive is winningly
droll, always on top — at least,
he likes to think so. He has a
mischievous sense of taste
and a roving eye, which allows
him to enjoy both old wine and
young women.
Walker, by contrast, is a
grumpy, stiff walrus. Like Wal
ters' Kitty, he could have made
Porteous into a mantlepiece.
But, just when you think he'll
fall asleep forever, he wheezes
a punchline.
Against this competition, the
others have a lot of ground to
make up. Barbara Dirickson
pulls through in strong form as
the bland, stifled socialite.
Daniel Kern is sometimes too
stuffed a stuffed shirt, but
makes it easy to see why his
wife would leave him for
bouncy Randall Smith, the
least effective because he's the
most broadly played.
That hurts because this pro
duction, originally directed by
Stephen Porter and recreated
by Eugene Barcone, never
loses control. It depends upon
fine-tuned timing, careful act
ing and that mysterious com
modity called "atmosphere."
That last is provided by
Robert Fletcher's costumes
and Robert Blackman's sets,
meticulously appointed by Ar
nold, who believes a house
should be an antique furniture
showroom.
His obsession with Sheraton
chairs points to another
Maugham circle: the endless,
pointless pursuits of perfec
tion and dreams. The senior
three have chased the impos
sible and know it's a sham. The
young want- their chance to
find out.
The Circle is Maugham's best
play, a collection of wit and
style as absurdly elegant as Ar
nold's living room.

bored Elizabeth won't heed
their advice. Arnold, however,
listens to his father's tips on
how to keep his wife from fle
eing.
Maugham's other circle is
the charmed one in which the
British upper crust sips tea and
ruins lives with equal abandon.
It seems nothing hurts too
much and no one cares a whole
lot about anything. Only in the
third act, when this magic is
broken do we discover hearts
of gold and venom beneath the
mannered wit.
Walters comes on as a cross
between Phyllis Diller and Au
ntie Mame. Under her rouged

face and — according to Pater
son — soul however, lies
sensitivity and a devoted if
wicked curious interest in
others' welfare.
Paterson's Clive is winningly
droll, always on top — at least,
he likes to think so. He has a
mischievous sense of taste
and a roving eye, which allows
him to enjoy both old wine and
young women.
Walker, by contrast, is a
grumpy, stiff walrus. Like Wal
ters' Kitty, he could have made
Porteous into a mantlepiece.
But, just when you think he'll
fall asleep forever, he wheezes
a punchline.
Against this competition, the
others have a lot of ground to
make up. Barbara Dirickson
pulls through in strong form as
the bland, stifled socialite.
Daniel Kern is sometimes too
stuffed a stuffed shirt, but
makes it easy to see why his
wife would leave him for
bouncy Randall Smith, the
least effective because he's the
most broadly played.
That hurts because this pro
duction, originally directed by
Stephen Porter and recreated
by Eugene Barcone, never
loses control. It depends upon
fine-tuned timing, careful act
ing and that mysterious com
modity called "atmosphere."
That last is provided by
Robert Fletcher's costumes
and Robert Blackman's sets,
meticulously appointed by Ar
nold, who believes a house
should be an antique furniture
showroom.
His obsession with Sheraton
chairs points to another
Maugham circle: the endless,
pointless pursuits of perfec
tion and dreams. The senior
three have chased the impos
sible and know it's a sham. The
young want- their chance to
find out.
The Circle is Maugham's best
play, a collection of wit and
style as absurdly elegant as Ar
nold's living room.
There are old actors and new
actors and the difference isn't
in their ages. It's in the way
they move and speak and play
to an audience. The old ones,
for instance, perform comedy
with stylish delight that re
minds you of 1,000 years of
theater tradition.
That's the kind of actors
needed for W. Somerset
Maugham's The Circle. And
that's the kind ACT offers in its
revival of last season's
smash.
Returning stars William
Paterson, Sydney Walker ana
Marrian Walters dominate this
production. Together, they
work like those music boxes
you can watch and listen to
forever. They trade grunts,
sneers and well-placed jabs as
if they'd done nothing else all
their lives. More important, for

a play so sharply written, they
know when to push a line and
when to let one push itself.
The new Circle players are
less effective, mainly because
of their roles. They must com
pete against that endearing if
exasperating trio of seniors
and Maugham simply didn't
give them the weapons.
As the title implies, he did
give us circles; the parallel
plots involve "love taking a
chance on itself" as Lady Kitty
(Walters) returns to England
after running off 30 years be
fore with her husband's best
friend (Walker). They arrive at
Kitty's son Arnold's (Daniel
Kern) estate, only to find her
husband Clive (Paterson) has
popped in for a surprise visit.
In the midst of this, Arnold's
wife Elizabeth (Barbara Di
rickson) has decided to run

away with the houseguest
(Randall Smith).
Kitty and her lover Porteous
have learned that romance
isn't all it's cracked up to be,
but dreamy and desperately
bored Elizabeth won't heed
their advice. Arnold, however,
listens to his father's tips on
how to keep his wife from fle
eing.
