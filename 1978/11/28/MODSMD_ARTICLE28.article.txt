## Cruising to a place in the sun 
### 
It seems that the number of
hits Pablo Cruise amasses is in
versely proportional to the age
of their audience. At least that
was the case Saturday night as
several thousand screamy
teeny-boppers from ages 9
to 15 (not including parents)
cheered on the gyrations of
Cory Lerios' hips when they
weren't swooning over his fast
finger work — on the piano.
The music that rocked the
Berkeley Community Theater
was quality and the perfor
mance of the four Bay Area
bred musicians, who started
out as regulars at the Keystone
in Berkeley, was outstanding,
but there was a marked ab
sence of match-lighting and
dope-smoking and alcohol
smuggling that usually accom
panies a rock concert. With
their tailored pants and
virgin-white piano and drum
set, Pablo Cruise seemed to
encourage that wholesome
ness. In any event, it didn't af
fect the rock and roll.
They opened with "Worlds
Away," the title cut l/om their
fourth and most recent album.
A little strobe work drove the
boppers wild as did the sub
sequent lighting effects pro
duced to take advantage of a
clever, creative set: palm trees
against a changing colored
backdrop that at one time
exhibited a rising sun, at
another a waning moon.
"Love Like This" and "Rag
ing Fire" drew similar ecstatic
responses, but the show had
only just begun. Pablo Cruise
has a lot of hits. You forget how
many they've actually pro
duced.
An energetic rendition of

"Atlanta June" was followed by
an amazing display of talent as
Lerios, with his teasing, en
dearing grin and swaggering
manner took the darkened
stage (and spotlight piano
bench) to perform the piano
introduction to "Ocean
Breeze." He has a right to
swagger. We were only 30 feet
from the stage and couldn't see
his fingers they were flying so
fast. Lerios plays wih prover
bial heart-wrenching intensity.
Needless to say, the audience
was mesmerized — be it from
passion or amazement.
And then they really warmed
up.
"Don't Want to Live Without
You" started off a string of hits
including "A Place in the Sun,"
"What you Gonna Do" and "Is
land Woman." Utilizing the
neighborly size of the au
ditiorium and the latest in re
mote control guitars, lead
guitarist David lenkins wan

dered into the audience, sat on
some willing laps and won a
few flutters for himself with his
off-stage parading. A little la
ter, using the home-town qual
ity that pervades the group to
its fullest, Jenkins sidled over
to the piano, hopped up and
finished a song cross-legged.
You got the impression he was
sitting in your living room.
A brief interlude of cheering
brought the group back for
their encore: a raucous en
livened version of "I Go To
Rio" that had the majority of
the house on its feet. The sec
ond encore was an instrumen
tal that clinched any previous
notions that perhaps Pablo
Cruise is truly diverse.
And so is the audience that
witnessed the Berkeley en
gagement Saturday. The com
munity theater and a following
of thousands, no matter what
age, is a well-deserved step up
from the Keystone.
