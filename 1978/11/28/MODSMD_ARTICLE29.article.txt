## A 						mesmerizing comedian 
### 
He looked like an Hawaiian-shirted elf, talked
like a tape-recorder on fast-forward, and im
itated everyone from a red-neck trucker, to a
squeaky voiced Nadia Comanechi. Although
Robin Williams returned for two encores, his 80
minute show was not long enough.
The star of television's Mork and Mindy did
not tell one joke in that time. Instead the impro
visational comic filled the stage with dozens of
characters, often acting out two or three parts at
once.
Laughter filled the Boarding House from the
moment Williams appeared in a Devo costume
until his final good-night. He quickly jumped
into the audience, comparing the many arms
reaching toward him to "a human carwash." He
wandered upand down theaisles, climbed up to
the lighting platform where he did silhouettes of
mooses and Notre Dame gargoyles, and coyly
avoided a back section of the nightclub oc
cupied by "the Furies," â€” teenage girls yelling,
"Robin, we want your body!"
Williams revealed several talents on stage in

eluding an ability to imitate sounds both human
and inhuman, to misquote Shakespeare, and to
play the harmonica in accompaniment to au
tobiographical blues: "I was born in a ghetto
called Tiberon, I didn't get my first BMW till I
was 16."
The sold-out crowd knew that all good things
must come to an end and Williams mastered the
audience more than ever at his closing. He
quietly walked on stage as himself after World
War III: "I feed the pigeons my methadone so
they come back." He handled hecklers with
more skill than before by staying in character,
referring to one with "Don't listen. That's my
boy, Cal. He took a lot of radiation. Now he's got
two heads so he just sits and talks to himself."
As Mork, he is responsible for skyrocketing
the badly written ABC show to top-ratings. But
Robin Williams must be set completely free
from a script for his comic brilliance to be fully
appreciated. When Williams took his last bow, a
standing ovation answered a question he voiced
earlier in the evening, "T.V. or not T.V.?"
