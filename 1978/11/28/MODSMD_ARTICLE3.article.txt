# Pakistani students oppose Bhutto offer
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
Several Pakistani students here are
launching a campaign to convince
the ASSU Senate to reconsider its
decision to offer a guest professor
ship to former Pakistani prime minis
ter Ali Bhutto.
Anjum Mir, a spokesman for the
group, said that the group has spo
ken to four or five senators and in
tends to contact the rest before the
senate meeting Thursday.
Mir said the Pakistanis are not at
tempting to pressure the senators
into adopting their point of view, but
are "just letting them know they ha
ven't heard from us." Mir said that
the senators rushed into their initial
decision because they were "mis
led" into believing Bhutto was to be
executed within 48 hours of the time
the matter was brought to theiratten
tion three weeks ago.
Letter
Mir said that this weekend he dis
covered that the National Associa
tion of Pakistani Students recently
wrote the senate to tell the body it
did not support the decision to invite
Bhutto here.
Miralso said he had learned that in
1975, Bhutto's alma mater, Oxford
University, considered granting the
then-prime minister an honorary
doctorate in civil law. Mir said that
the proposed degree met with so
much controversy it was put to a vote
of Oxford's students and faculty,
who denied Bhutto the honor.
Bhutto was convicted this summer
of the 1974 murder of the father of
one of his political opponents. Some
Western observers have called Bhut
to's trial unfair.
At the request of Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), the
ASSU Senate instructed the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board to offer a
position to Bhutto to give the military

government that deposed him an al
ternative to executing him.
McCloskey is in Africa and has yet
to decide whether to go to Pakistan
later this week to deliver the invita
tion in person.
Mir said that the senate should re
consider its invitation in time to re
call McCloskey in case the body does
decide to cancel the guest professor
ship offer.
Senate Whip Ron Johnson said that
if the Pakistani students write a re
solution it will be "only fair" that the
senate reconsider its decision.
Johnson said it will take a simple
majority of the senate to bring the
issue to the floor and a two-thirds
vote to recall the invitation.
Support
Johnson added, however, that he
stili supports the senate's decision.
He said that senators should be
discussing this issue with the stu
dents in their districts this week to
elicit students' response.
Senate Chairperson Peter Stamos
said yesterday he received a letter
from Amnesty International which
stated that the senate's efforts "can
only help" in the movement to en
sure Bhutto's safety.
Mir said that one of his complaints
concerns the fact that the senate
made no attempt to contact the 14
Pakistani students on campus when
it made its initial decision. Mir said
that almost all the Pakistanis here
with whom he has spoken are op
posed to the decision.
The Pakistanis here, according to
Mir, generally feel that Bhutto's per
formance as prime minister was not
exemplary. Mir said there is enough
evidence to question Bhutto's use of
power while in office.
Mir also said that Bhutto may use
the prestige of a Stanford appoint
ment to justify his past actions and
further his political career.
