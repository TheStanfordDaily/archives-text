Carter vows 'tight' 1980 budget
St. Louis — President Jimmy Carter, declaring
that "no aspect of government will be sacred,"
warned the nation's top urban leaders yesterday
that the next federal budget will be "very, very
tight" and that they will have to exercise restraint
to help fight inflation.
"All of you have been through the budget cycle
yourself, and you know what it is to face unlimited
demands with limited resources," he told the
board of directors of the National Leagueof Cities.
In an earlier speech before the league's annual
convention, Carter pledged "to do this without
starving useful programs." He said repeatedly that
military spending will be scrutinized as carefully as
domestic programs, but he did not say military
spending would be cut.
Carter is committed to cutting his 1980 federal
budget to achieve a federal deficit of no more than
$30 billion. White House officials have said military
spending would not be cut, raising concerns
among city officials.
Court won't take Farber case
Washington — New York Times reporter Myron
Farber and his newspaper were denied Supreme
Court review yesterday of their contempt convic
tions for refusing to surrender confidential files.
The nation's highest court turned its back to
arguments by Farber and the Times that the
contempt-of-court convictions violated the Con
stitution's free-press protections and a state repor
ters' shield law.
Farber spent 40 days in jail and the Times paid
$285,000 in fines after being found in contempt of a
New Jersey judge's request for files compiled by
Farber in his investigation of a series of mysterious
hospital deaths.
None of the court's nine justices went on record
as favoring a review of Farber's appeal, but Justice
William Brennan, for unexplained reasons, took
no part in considering the appeal.
The justices' action cannot be interpreted as a
statement on the merits of the Farber case.
China accused of repression
London — Amnesty International accused the
People's Republic of China yesterday of systemati
cally repressing political dissent through social
censure, imprisonment, mental torture and
execution since the 1949 Communist takeover.
In its first major report on China, the London
based human rights group quoted official Chinese
documents indicating the number of people
punished for straying from official policy is in the
millions.
Amnesty International, which advocates the re
lease of political prisoners everywhere and won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said the report was
the result of "several years of intensive research."
Most material in the report, Amnesty said, came

from official sources such as the Chinese press,
decrees, statements and legal documents or from
unofficial accounts from people whr fled China.
Among the reforms urged in the report is a "re
peal of all laws prescribing administrative or crim
inal punishment for the non-violent expression of
beliefs." It says the "laws are loosely worded and
have been interpreted broadly, permitting large
scale imprisonment on political grounds."
Yoshimura disputes conviction
San Francisco —An attorney Yoshim
ura, comparing her trial to the famed Sacco and
Vanzetti case, urged the state Court of Appeal
yesterday to overturn her conviction on 1972
weapons charges on gronds she was improperly
linked to Patricia Hearst.
Ms. Yoshimura, 35, and Ms. Hearst were ar
rested together in September 1975 in the San Fran
cisco apartment they shared. Ms. Yoshimura later
was convicted on 1972 charges that a machine gun,
pipe bomb and ther weapons and explosive mate
rials were found in a garage she rented in Ber
keley.
But Depute State Public Defender Dennis Rior
dan said prosecutors in Ms. Yoshimura's Alameda
County Superior Court trial improperly intro
duced as evidence her association with Ms. Hearst
and Bill and Emily Harris, Symbionese Liberation
Army members who have pleaded guilty to kid
napping the newspaper heiress.
In fact, Riordan told the three-judge panel, his
client "had never heard of" either Ms. Hearst or
the harrises when she was indicted in April 1972 for
illegal possession of the weapons. She fled after
the indictiment and was a fugitive until her arrest.
Gunman holds 10 in bar
Wyandotte, Mich. — A man with a rifle held 10
tavern customers hostage yesterday for up to eight
boozy hours during which the drinks were on the
house and five of the hostages turned down a
chance to leave, police said.
One of the hostages, Ben Dudley, a 41-year-old
driver, said Gary Cornell, 35, of this Detroit suburb
entered Bill's Corner Bar at 1:40 a.m., then went
back out and returned with a rifle.
"Give everybody a drink. This is not a holdup or
a stickup. I've got problems," Dudley quoted
Cornell as saying.
Police said the incident ended without injury
after a reporter came to the bar to talk with Cornell
about his problems, which included charges of
mistreatment by a hospital. Cornell was then taken
to Wyandotte General Hospital.
No charges were immediately filed.
Three Monet paintings stolen
Santa Barbara — Three paintings by French im
pressionist Claude Monet valued at an estimated
$1 million were stolen during the weekend from
the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, a museum offi

cial said.
The three paintings, the most valuable in the
museum's collection, were taken off a wall in the
Could Gallery on the main floor of the museum
sometime between Saturday evening and Sunday
morning, said Paul Mills, museum director.
The paintings, each about two by three feet in
size, and their frames were removed without dis
turbing the museum's security system, police said.
There was no sign of forced entry.
The three artworks are "odighers" one of a
series of Monets painted in the Italian Riviera re
sort town in 1884; "Charing Cross Bridge" of 1899
and "Waterloo" of 1900, both paintied during the
short trips to London.
Winter storm hits Northeast
The Northeast's first big snowstorm of the sea
son struck from the nation's capital to New Eng
land yesterday, icing roads and prompting a run
on tire chains and snow shovels.
As much as eight inches of snow was predicted
for the western ridges of New England, six inches
fell in the mountainous western regions of Mary
land.
The storm had blanketed the Washington, D.C.,
area by dawn, and whitened Times Square in
Manhattan.
It sent school buses skidding in Michigan and
left spun-out autos along the highways of Pen
nyslvania.
"This is one of the earliest storms we've had,"
said Charles Schlott of the National Weather Ser
vice in Newark.
New Jersey State Police blamed the rash of acci
dents there on too many motorists who lacked
snow tires. At one point yesterday, the maximum
speed on the NewJerseyTurnpikewasdropped to
35 mph.
