The Guaranteed Student Loan
Program offers a lucrative source of
financial aid forcollege students who
need help and legislation passed by
Congress makes the money more
widely available than ever.
The new law extends interest be
nefits available under the program to
all students, regardless of family in
come. Federal officials hope to im
plement the legislation by January —
in time for the spring semester.
Here's how it works:
Money is borrowed directly from a
bank, credit union or other financial
institution. The loan is guaranteed by
a state or private non-profit agency
or is insured by the federal govern
ment.
The interest rate is only 7 percent.
No interest is paid while the student
is in college.
Undergraduate students may bor
row up to $2500 a year. Graduate and
professional students generally may
borrow up to $5000 a year, although
the amount is less in some states. The
total amount you may borrow for
undergraduate or vocational study is
$7500. The total allowed for both
graduate and undergraduate study is
$15,000.
Interest payments for the period
while the student is in college — and
they can amount to hundreds of dol
lars — are taken care of by the federal
government. This benefit used to be
restricted to students from families
with incomes of less than $25,000 a
year, but Congress abolished the
limit.

Borrowers must start repaying the
loan with 9 to 12 months after gradua
tion. Up to 10 years is allowed for
repaying the total. Individual pay
ments will vary, but in most cases at
least $360 a year must be paid back.
The government helps make up
the difference between the 7 percent
rate and the amount lenders could
get on conventional loans.
Note: An insurance premium of up
to 1 percent of the total loan out
standing may be collected each year
in advance for a loan guaranteed by a
state or private agency; a premium of
one-fourth of a percent will be col
lected for federally insured loans.
To borrow money under the
Guaranteed Student Loan Program,
get an application form at a local len
der, from the school counselor or
from regional offices of the U.S. Of
fice of Education.
Part of the form must be filled out
by the students and their families.
The rest must be completed by the
financial aid officer at the college or
university which the student will be
attending. The completed form
should be taken to a lending institu
tion which participates in the prog
ram. It is up to the student to find
such an institution since participa
tion is voluntary.
If the lender agrees to make the
loan, he or she gets the approval of
the guarantee agency or the U.S. Of
fice of Education, and then gives the
student the money in one or more
payments. The loan check or checks
must be made payable to the student
or to both the student and the school
involved.

Part of the form must be filled out
by the students and their families.
The rest must be completed by the
financial aid officer at the college or
university which the student will be
attending. The completed form
should be taken to a lending institu
tion which participates in the prog
ram. It is up to the student to find
such an institution since participa
tion is voluntary.
If the lender agrees to make the
loan, he or she gets the approval of
the guarantee agency or the U.S. Of
fice of Education, and then gives the
student the money in one or more
payments. The loan check or checks
must be made payable to the student
or to both the student and the school
involved.
The Guaranteed Student Loan
Program offers a lucrative source of
financial aid forcollege students who
need help and legislation passed by
Congress makes the money more
widely available than ever.
The new law extends interest be
nefits available under the program to
all students, regardless of family in
come. Federal officials hope to im
plement the legislation by January —
in time for the spring semester.
Here's how it works:
Money is borrowed directly from a
bank, credit union or other financial
institution. The loan is guaranteed by
a state or private non-profit agency
or is insured by the federal govern
ment.
The interest rate is only 7 percent.
No interest is paid while the student
is in college.
Undergraduate students may bor
row up to $2500 a year. Graduate and
professional students generally may
borrow up to $5000 a year, although
the amount is less in some states. The
total amount you may borrow for
undergraduate or vocational study is
$7500. The total allowed for both
graduate and undergraduate study is
$15,000.
Interest payments for the period
while the student is in college — and
they can amount to hundreds of dol
lars — are taken care of by the federal
government. This benefit used to be
restricted to students from families
with incomes of less than $25,000 a
year, but Congress abolished the
limit.

Borrowers must start repaying the
loan with 9 to 12 months after gradua
tion. Up to 10 years is allowed for
repaying the total. Individual pay
ments will vary, but in most cases at
least $360 a year must be paid back.
The government helps make up
the difference between the 7 percent
rate and the amount lenders could
get on conventional loans.
Note: An insurance premium of up
to 1 percent of the total loan out
standing may be collected each year
in advance for a loan guaranteed by a
state or private agency; a premium of
one-fourth of a percent will be col
lected for federally insured loans.
To borrow money under the
Guaranteed Student Loan Program,
get an application form at a local len
der, from the school counselor or
from regional offices of the U.S. Of
fice of Education.
