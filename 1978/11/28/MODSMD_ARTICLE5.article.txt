# First year biz school class includes former chimney sweep, basketball pro, producer

### RUSS KALAN 
The first year business school class here in
cludes four doctors, a movie producer, a chim
ney sweep, a rock music promoter and a former
professional basketball player.
While many business students get their work
experience in traditional fields like accounting,
consulting, finance and marketing, others have
more unorthodox backgrounds.
Over 75 percent of the Graduate School of
Business' first-year students are returning to
class after working full-time for a year or more,
according to a recent business school report.
That figure has doubled in the last 10 years.
According to Lawrence Lieberman, director
of MBA admissions here, the increase is caused
by the school's preference for applicants with
work experience.
"Work experience enables students to relate
what they learn in class with what they have
already experienced on the job," Lieberman
said. "It leaves students in a better position to
integrate what they are learning from various
subjects.
"People with experience also heighten the

reciprocal learning environment so that a great
deal of student learning comes from exposure
to the experience of others," he said.
"This is especially important in a problem
solving curriculum like ours."
Basket to books
John Hummer, 30, came to the business
school after six years in the National Basketball
Association. Until a seventh ankle operation in
1976 made him decide to retire, he played with
the Buffalo Braves and Seattle Supersonics.
Hummer wants to acquire some administra
tive skills and to "do something fairly construc
tive with my life."
"The transition from the pros to work is
tough," Hummer said. "In terms of attention
and salaries, athletes are specially treated."
Hummer said that his undergraduate prepara
tion (he graduated from Princeton with a de
gree in English) has hurt him academically so
far.
Unlike Hummer, Doug Burgum came to the
business school directly from college. During
his senior year at North Dakota State, Burgum
worked parttime as a chimney sweep in Fargo

where he had the highest workman's compen
sation rate in the state.
As part of his $40 chimney-sweeping service,
Burgum drove to work in a 1948 Chevy pickup
and wore a white tuxedo. Typically, neighbors
would gather to watch the spectacle and he'd
shake hands with onlookers afterward.
Lots of luck
While chimney sweeping doesn't always
bring good luck, it certainly hasn't hurt Bur
gum: Burgum wore his chimney tux while he
filled out his business school application.
Only 314 of 4179 candidates were accepted
this year. Between classes, Ronald Kauffman,
25, is producing the movie version of Kurt Von
negut's Breakfast of Champions.
Kauffman is an accomplished filmmaker — at
15, his film shared top honors at an interna
tional film festival with a film by Samuel Beckett
— who wants to acquire comparable business
skills.
"When I'm out of here, I want to be able to
take over 20th Century-Fox, so I want to learn
stocks and bonds," he said.
