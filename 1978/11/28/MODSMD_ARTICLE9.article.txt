# Alumnus represents SLAC

### MARK STOTT 
Menlo Park — He graduated from Stanford 12
years ago. Now Republican Bob Naylor is again
affiliated with the University. But this time he
represents part of the campus in the State As
sembly.
However, Naylor said he doesn't believe his
district is greatly affected by the campus portion
of his district — the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center.
"I don't think SLAC's presence affects it as
much as having a lot of highly qualified technical
professionals," he said referring to his con
stituents in the so-called Silicon Valley.
The 20th Assembly District covers San Mateo
County, south of and including part of the city of
San Mateo. It also encompasses the 480 acres of
SLAC and several parts of the Stanford Coif
Course.
Naylor, Daily editor here 14 years ago, sur
prised students by endorsing condidate Barry
Goldwater for president. Naylor explained his
political philosophy.
"I think the basic kernel of my philosophy is
the same . . . basically a limited government
theory."
But, he added, "the government has a bigger
role to play than I would have conceded in '64."
Naylor cited his practical experiences since
graduating in 1966, for adjustments in his
philosophy. He said army service in Oklahoma
and Vietnam from 1969-1971, seven years with a
law firm and participation in Republican Party
politics have convinced him that government
must protect the environment and consumers.
Naylor said he believes Stanford prepared
him well for his tenure at Yale Law School and
for his career in Republican politics.
During his time here, Naylor participated in
Stanford-in-Washington and Stanford-in-
Cermany programs, served on the senate and
became an associate member of the California
State Central Committee.
"I was a compulsive activist at Stanford," he
admitted.
Comparing his '60s experiences at Stanford

and Yale, he said Yale "seemed insulated" and
"lacked vitality Stanford had.
"There was lots of intellectual ferment at
Yale,"he added. "They really didn't go through
the extreme discontent with the Vietnam War."
Naylor said he does not believe claims that
students of the 70s are less interested in politics
than their '60s counterparts.
"If anything, they're a little more studious.
But I don't think they're less interested as a
group. The difference may be that interested
students may be less inclined to get involved in
radical causes," he said.
Compared to the unrest of the '60s, he added,
student political interest in the '70s "doesn't
make good copy."
Nalyor said today's students might be a little
more conservative. He explained, though, that
this would be a logical transition.
"Things radicals were talking about in the '60s
were part of the conservative libertarian strain
all along," he said, noting the civil-rights move
ment. "Once the old conservatism shed its ra
cist tones ... it became more acceptable."
As a lawyer, Naylor, specialized in tax reform.
Throughout his career, though, he said, "I guess
in the back of my mind I always felt . . . depend
ing on the situation I was in, that I would some
day run for public office."
When Dixon Arnett vacated the 20th District
assembly seat to run for state controller in June,
Naylor had his chance.
His years in state politics make him believe,
that "in California, at least, politics are wide
open."
Since college, he has chaired the San Mateo
County Republican Committee, Ronald
Reagan's 1976 presidential campaign in that
county, and the Elections and Reapportionment
Committee of the party's State Central Commit
tee. i
"If you're intelligent and willing to put in the
time," he explained, "you will be asked to do
more and more. The activists are such a ti ny, ti ny
fraction of the population that groups are starv
ing for talent."
