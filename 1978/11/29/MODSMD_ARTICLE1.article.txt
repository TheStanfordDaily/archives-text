# Moscone-Milk assassinations
## White charged with murder 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Former San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White was
charged yesterday with the murders
of Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk in a criminal
complaint which cites a law calling
for the death penalty.
District Attorney Joseph Freitas, in
a brief news conference, revealed
that the two-count complaint had
been filed in Municipal Court.
He said White would be arraigned
today on the charges which cite
"special circumstances" — a crime
covered by the death penalty in
California.
Freitas charged that White killed
Moscone and Milk "in retaliation for
and to prevent the performance of
the official duties" of the two offi
cials.
Moscone and Milk were killed
Monday in City Hall. White surren
dered to police about 45 minutes
after the shootings.
No questions
The district attorney refused to
answer questions and said he would
make no further comment on the
case.
"I feel very strongly that my office
may not comment on this case in
order that there be no violation of
the rights of this defendant," he said.
In addition to the two counts of
murder, White was charged with
possessing and using a firearm, a .38
caliber revolver, during the assassi
nations.
Prop. 7
The "special circumstances" sec
tion of the California penal code was
recently the subject of an election
proposition — Prop. 7. Voters ap
proved the measure which allows the
death penalty for assassination of
elected officials and certain multiple
murders.
The section of the complaint
against White dealing with such vio

lations would take effect only if he is
convicted of one or both of the as
sassinations here.
The initial charge alleges that
White "did willfully, unlawfully and
with malice of forethought murder
George Moscone, the duly elected
mayor of the city and county of San
Francisco, California."

of Milk.
Special Circumstances
The charge under the special cir
cumstances code section reads: "It is
alleged that George Moscone was an
elected local official of the govern
ment of the city and county of San
Francisco . . . and the killing as was
alleged in count one was personally
carried out in retaliation for and to
prevent the performance of the offi
cial duties of the said George Mos
cone."
Another count gave the same
wording for the murder of Milk.
Freitas, speaking at a jammed news
conference in his office, assured the
press that he will not seek to keep
any information secret.
"The case will unfold and the pub
lic will know everything that hap
pens," he said.
White, 32, a former city police of
ficer and fireman, had been fighting
for about two weeks to regain his
seat on the city's Board of Super
visors, from which he resigned Nov.
10.
Law and order
"On the board, White was the
greatest advocate of law and order.
But it was clear that he was angry and
felt he was entitled to get his seat
back," Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver
said Monday.
Considered among the most con
servative on the 11-member board,
White was also the most outspoken
against gay rights issues in this city
where police estimate as many as

one-sixth of its 700,000 residents are
homosexual.
Asked in November about his
hopes for gay rights issues before the
board, Milk said he was generally
pleased.
"But Dan White — he's going to be
trouble," Milk said.
Nonetheless, the two were pic
tured smiling together. Roger Boas,
the city's chief administrative officer,
said he had seen White "berate" two
other supervisors, "but I never saw
any problems between Mr. White
and Mr. Milk."
White determined
But city officials said White was de
termined to get back on the board
after his resignation Nov. 10. He said
then a supervisor's $9600 salary could
not support him, his wife, Mary Ann,
and four-month-old son, Andrew. It
was half the salary he had made as a
city firefighter, a job he had to quit in
order to serve on the board.
But he changed his mind after his
16 brothers and sisters offered him
up to $10,000 in loans, and asked for
his job back.
White apparently felt double cros
sed by the mayor, who at first had
praised him publicly forchanging his
mind about resigning, then told him
he would have to rally support in his
blue-collar neighborhood in order to
win reappointment.
Vigo Nielsen, one of two attorneys
White hired to get his job back, said
White told him he thought Moscone
"had gone back on his word."
Woman front-runner
On Thanksgiving Day, White an
grily read news reports that a woman
was the front-runner for his board
seat. The next day, his attorneys ar
gued to Superior Court Judge Francis
Mayer that White's resignation was
actually invalid because he had
handed it to the wrong person.
Mayer refused to bar Moscone
from naming a replacement.
On Sunday night, a reporter who
had learned White would not be
reappointed called him for his reac
tion. "He seemed taken aback," sh >
said. "He hung up on me."
Lights burning
A neighbor on White's block,
Stella Sorbi, said she saw his lights
burning until past 1 a.m.
Monday morning, a half hour be
fore Moscone was to name Don
Horanzy as White's successor, White
walked into Moscone's office. Nearly
everyone in City Hall believes it was
his last futile plea for reappointment.
Scores of flowers and burned
down candles — placed on the steps
to City Hall by San Franciscans
mourning the deaths of Moscone
and Milk met city workers yesterday.
Some workers said their offices
were operating normally but the
hushed voices and somber faces be
lied the mood on the day after the
tragedy.
"It's not business as usual since
this happened," said Richard Evans,
of the department of public works.
"No way. No way," he said.
