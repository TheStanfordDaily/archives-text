Facts on
Recycling Center
Although we at the Recycling
Center are appreciative of the
publicity afforded us by the
Daily article of November 14,
there are a few minor poi nts we
might straighten out.
While it is irrefutably true
that we receive many articles
including birdfeeders, old piz
zas, and underwear in our re
cycling drums, we have re
ceived nowhere near 75 tons of
aluminum in our entire exis
tence, much less in one
month. If this were the case,
we would be bringing in
$25,500 per month from
aluminum alone. And if that
were the case, you can bet that
not only would we be breaking
even, but that we would all be
pocketing a substantial profit!
No such luck. The figure for
aluminum recycled is about
1-1% tons per months.
While we are on the subject
of money, we'll say something
about Steven Mentor's salary
which we feel was rather tack
ily included in the article. What
with taxes, government bribes,
and three martini lunches, Ste
ven estimates the actual take
home figure is somewhere
around $16.95 which goes di
rectly to payments on his
taped eck.
Also, the initial capital for the
recycling project came from a
two quarter fee assessment last
year, not from an ASSU grant.
In essence students are paying
for recycling, and they should
use it.
Our staff was shocked to
hear that they are taking Bob
Wenzlau's SWOPSI class next
quarter — most of them
learned of it from the Daily ar
ticle. Good luck gang, the extra
units will do you good.
Lastly, and maybe most im
portant of all is the fact that
Stanford does indeed generate
11,000 tons of solid waste per
year or 30 tons per day. So far
the Recycling Center has been
extremely successful and the
response to recycling pheno
menal. We c/o service the Med
ical Center as well as SLAC and
are continually expanding. But
we need everyone's continued
support to maintain ASSU Re
cycling's status as the most
successful campus recycling
program in the country.
Oh, we did like the pictures.

(Editor's note: Evidentally there
was a typesetting or copyedit
ing error in the recycling article
in question. Rather than the
correct .75 tons of aluminum,
the copy was published as 75

tons. The initial capital for the
recycling project did come
from a two-quarter fee assess
ment which the reporter mista
kenly called an ASSU grant.
The Daily regrets the error.
However, the Daily does not
consider that printing the salary
of Steven Mentor is "tacky." It
is valid information in an article
based on the new position of
public awareness office oc
cupied by Mentor.
The article also stated that
members of the recycling
center will be involved with -
i.e. talking to, helping organize
- the SWOPSI course on recycl
ing next quarter. The reporter
did not say that staff members
would be enrolled in the
course.
Finally, the article does state
that Stanford generates 11,000
tons of trash per year, in a direct
quote by Mentor.

Discussion a
'pleasure' to attend
I had the pleasure of attend
ing at the Bechtel Center on
Nov. 9 a discussion of the polit
ical and social situation in Iran.
I want to commend Stanford
New Directions for sponsoring
the program.
The speakers were very defi
nitely opposed to the govern
ment of the shah. Their presen
tation was very interesting; I
agreed with parts of their posi
tion and seriously questioned
other parts. In any event, I
learned and I gained new
perspective.
The most significant aspect
of this discussion is that it actu
ally took place. The speakers
were allowed and encouraged
to share their views, an oppor
tunity not allowed another
speaker on Iran just a few
weeks ago.

A 'holy Christmas'
"False, hypocritical, danger
ous, absurd, morally repulsive,
etc. etc." — it would be hard to
believe that David Miller
("Christmas Spirit," Daily,
Nov. 22) was referring to the
Way followed in good faith by
millions of Christians, except
that I myself might have made
such statements at an earlier
time in my life. Happily, our
Lord really is a friend of sin
ners, as even so zealous a per
secutor of the church as St.
Paul testified: "in the end, he
came even to me."
I won't try to deal with mis
conceptions here, except to
point out that, quoted out of
context, the Bible can be used
to prove virtually anything —
and, indeed, has often been so
used. The New Testament is a

deep spiritual document
whose whole is far greater than
the sum of its parts. I recom
mend one of the excellent
Bible studies available around
Stanford, as well as the services
of the campus ministry: the
truth really will make you free.
Hearing Miller's anger as a
cry for help, I have begun to
pray for him, as Jesus taught us
to bless those who curse us. I
hope other Christians will join
me in this prayer and in wish
ing you and all Daily readers
not only a Merry but a Holy
Christmas.

A 'holy Christmas'
"False, hypocritical, danger
ous, absurd, morally repulsive,
etc. etc." — it would be hard to
believe that David Miller
("Christmas Spirit," Daily,
Nov. 22) was referring to the
Way followed in good faith by
millions of Christians, except
that I myself might have made
such statements at an earlier
time in my life. Happily, our
Lord really is a friend of sin
ners, as even so zealous a per
secutor of the church as St.
Paul testified: "in the end, he
came even to me."
I won't try to deal with mis
conceptions here, except to
point out that, quoted out of
context, the Bible can be used
to prove virtually anything —
and, indeed, has often been so
used. The New Testament is a

deep spiritual document
whose whole is far greater than
the sum of its parts. I recom
mend one of the excellent
Bible studies available around
Stanford, as well as the services
of the campus ministry: the
truth really will make you free.
Hearing Miller's anger as a
cry for help, I have begun to
pray for him, as Jesus taught us
to bless those who curse us. I
hope other Christians will join
me in this prayer and in wish
ing you and all Daily readers
not only a Merry but a Holy

Facts on
Recycling Center
Although we at the Recycling
Center are appreciative of the
publicity afforded us by the
Daily article of November 14,
there are a few minor poi nts we
might straighten out.
While it is irrefutably true
that we receive many articles
including birdfeeders, old piz
zas, and underwear in our re
cycling drums, we have re
ceived nowhere near 75 tons of
aluminum in our entire exis
tence, much less in one
month. If this were the case,
we would be bringing in
$25,500 per month from
aluminum alone. And if that
were the case, you can bet that
not only would we be breaking
even, but that we would all be
pocketing a substantial profit!
No such luck. The figure for
aluminum recycled is about
1-1% tons per months.
While we are on the subject
of money, we'll say something
about Steven Mentor's salary
which we feel was rather tack
ily included in the article. What
with taxes, government bribes,
and three martini lunches, Ste
ven estimates the actual take
home figure is somewhere
around $16.95 which goes di
rectly to payments on his
taped eck.
Also, the initial capital for the
recycling project came from a
two quarter fee assessment last
year, not from an ASSU grant.
In essence students are paying
for recycling, and they should
use it.
Our staff was shocked to
hear that they are taking Bob
Wenzlau's SWOPSI class next
quarter — most of them
learned of it from the Daily ar
ticle. Good luck gang, the extra
units will do you good.
Lastly, and maybe most im
portant of all is the fact that
Stanford does indeed generate
11,000 tons of solid waste per
year or 30 tons per day. So far
the Recycling Center has been
extremely successful and the
response to recycling pheno
menal. We c/o service the Med
ical Center as well as SLAC and
are continually expanding. But
we need everyone's continued
support to maintain ASSU Re
cycling's status as the most
successful campus recycling
program in the country.
Oh, we did like the pictures.

(Editor's note: Evidentally there
was a typesetting or copyedit
ing error in the recycling article
in question. Rather than the

the copy was published as 75

tons. The initial capital for the
recycling project did come
from a two-quarter fee assess
ment which the reporter mista
kenly called an ASSU grant.
The Daily regrets the error.
However, the Daily does not
consider that printing the salary
of Steven Mentor is "tacky." It

The article also stated that
members of the recycling

quarter — most of them

Discussion a
'pleasure' to attend
I had the pleasure of attend
ing at the Bechtel Center on
Nov. 9 a discussion of the polit
ical and social situation in Iran.
I want to commend Stanford
New Directions for sponsoring
the program.
The speakers were very defi
nitely opposed to the govern
ment of the shah. Their presen
tation was very interesting; I
agreed with parts of their posi
tion and seriously questioned
other parts. In any event, I
learned and I gained new
perspective.
The most significant aspect
of this discussion is that it actu
ally took place. The speakers
were allowed and encouraged
to share their views, an oppor
tunity not allowed another
speaker on Iran just a few
weeks ago.

A 'holy Christmas'
"False, hypocritical, danger
ous, absurd, morally repulsive,
etc. etc." — it would be hard to
believe that David Miller
("Christmas Spirit," Daily,
Nov. 22) was referring to the
Way followed in good faith by
millions of Christians, except
that I myself might have made
such statements at an earlier
time in my life. Happily, our
Lord really is a friend of sin
ners, as even so zealous a per
secutor of the church as St.
Paul testified: "in the end, he
came even to me."
I won't try to deal with mis
conceptions here, except to
point out that, quoted out of
context, the Bible can be used
to prove virtually anything —
and, indeed, has often been so
used. The New Testament is a

deep spiritual document
whose whole is far greater than
the sum of its parts. I recom
mend one of the excellent
Bible studies available around
Stanford, as well as the services
of the campus ministry: the
truth really will make you free.
Hearing Miller's anger as a
cry for help, I have begun to
pray for him, as Jesus taught us
to bless those who curse us. I
hope other Christians will join
me in this prayer and in wish
ing you and all Daily readers
not only a Merry but a Holy
Christmas.

Facts on
Recycling Center
Although we at the Recycling
Center are appreciative of the
publicity afforded us by the
Daily article of November 14,
there are a few minor poi nts we
might straighten out.
While it is irrefutably true
that we receive many articles
including birdfeeders, old piz
zas, and underwear in our re
cycling drums, we have re
ceived nowhere near 75 tons of
aluminum in our entire exis
tence, much less in one
month. If this were the case,
we would be bringing in
$25,500 per month from
aluminum alone. And if that
were the case, you can bet that
not only would we be breaking
even, but that we would all be
pocketing a substantial profit!
No such luck. The figure for
aluminum recycled is about
1-1% tons per months.
While we are on the subject
of money, we'll say something
about Steven Mentor's salary
which we feel was rather tack
ily included in the article. What
with taxes, government bribes,
and three martini lunches, Ste
ven estimates the actual take
home figure is somewhere
around $16.95 which goes di
rectly to payments on his
taped eck.
Also, the initial capital for the
recycling project came from a
two quarter fee assessment last
year, not from an ASSU grant.
In essence students are paying
for recycling, and they should
use it.
Our staff was shocked to
hear that they are taking Bob
Wenzlau's SWOPSI class next
quarter — most of them
learned of it from the Daily ar
ticle. Good luck gang, the extra
units will do you good.
Lastly, and maybe most im
portant of all is the fact that

ical Center as well as SLAC and
