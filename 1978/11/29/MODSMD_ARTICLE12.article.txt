## Plan fulfills capitalist needs 
### 
Two weeks ago I noted that
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey
had reason to fear an all black
(or poor) army. I contended
that some of McCloskey's
reasons might not be discern
able from his rhetoric. At the
conclusion of that column I
promised that I would proceed
this week with an explanation
of how McCloskey's National
Service Plan might fulfill some
of the present day needs of
American capitalists as well as
some of those of the American
capitalist state.
First, however, I must clear
up a misunderstanding as
sociated with my last column.
The Daily editors compose the
titles for all of the columns
printed by the paper. Unfortu
nately, the editors misun
derstood the intent of my
analysis, as they entitled it
"McCloskey's Plan Racist." I
do not find McCloskey's plan
to be racist. It is possible that
the historical origins of the
plan may be associated with ra
cism in our society. In fact,
McCloskey wants us to believe
that his plan is anti-racist. He
contends that the plan is an at
tempt to insure that minority
people are not the majority in
the armed forces. However, as
one can see if he or she read
my last column, my analysis of
McCloskey's motives indicates
that the Congressperson may
have other goals (other than
equal representation in the
military) in mind as he offers up
his scheme. This brings me to
my topic at hand.

Why (he National Service
Plan? The sophisticated, highly
technological armed forces in
our capitalist state structure
are an integral part of what C.
Wright Mills called the
"Military-Industrial Complex."
The military needs highly edu
cated individuals to run its in
tricate operations, operations
that in the future might include
— and certainly in the past did
include — quelling liberation
struggles in the Third World.
Further, many U.S. corpora
tions depend on the consump
tion by the military to provide a
stable market for their
hardware, computers, etc. If
the ranks of the military are
staffed by predominantly poor,
undereducated individuals,
the effective functioning of the
military and hence of the milit
ary industrial complex — might
be impaired or severely dis
rupted.
The military's leadership has
attempted to cope with this
situation, as it has offered
commissioned "managerial"
positions to educated
graduates of American insti
tutes of higher learning. This
effort seems'to have been in
adequte, as most highly edu
cated young Americans do not
voluntarily flock to the armed
forces. Thus, the military has
had to upgrade the education
of those recruits it has been
able to enlist, i.e. the poor un
dereducated "all-black" army
personnel that McCloskey
"fears." This poses many prob
lems — some of which I have

mentioned in my previous col
umn. For instance, there is no
longer any excuse for non
promotion of minority enlisted
persons. Yet the figures indi
cate that relatively few officers
are Third World people.
Further, once these Third
World men and women are
dumped back into the "civi
lian" sector their skills levels
should be passports to jobs.
However, unemployment and
poor pay still face most blacks,
Hispanic peoples, Asian
Americans, Native Americans,
and other minorities.
According to Bakke and
other misinformed Americans,
inequality of opportunity is a
thing of the past. The state of
affairs surrounding minorities
associated with the military is
debunking the "end of dis
crimination" myth. Institu
tional racism continues to be a
vicious reality, and Third
World people and other
Americans will not continue to
be convinced to the contrary
when concrete examples con
front them.
Enter McCloskey and his
mandatory conscription plan.
What better way to hype over
the non-promotion of Third-
World enlistees than to draft
large numbers of white young
people? Many white middle
class persons who would not
have been interested in the
military will be funnelled into
the armed forces during an im
pressionable period of their
lives. Certainly some of the of
ficers will be chosen from the
pool of poor or Third World
military personnel. But, as in
the other sectors of society,
white educated people will
have a formidable advantage
when promotions are consi
dered.
The mandatory draft plan
will provide other functions in
the operations of present
American economic and social
relations. First, all 18-year-olds
will undergo an intensive,
centrally controlled socializa
tion process, whether that
process takes place in boot
camp or in their training to
"replace illegal aliens in the
fields." Mass training is known
to be a type of brainwashing
experience that is ac

complished by regimentation,
fragmentation and the incul
cation of a sense of powerless
ness. Eighteen-year-olds will,
certainly, be taught not to de
monstrate in the streets as their
brothers and sisters have in the
past. Instead they will be im
bued with a notion that the
military and the present ruling
classes find functionally ap
propriate — conformity.
Further, those who are
employed in what McCloskey
calls "government service" will
be another weapon in the
State's arsenal aimed against
working people. These young
people will be an ideal labor
force that can be manipulated
to "strike-bust" in certain cir
cumstances. Note McClos
key's public statement that the
ranks of the draftees will be
used to oust "illegal" aliens
from America's fields. Who
else might these maneuverable
workers drive from their jobs?
Perhaps the working people
who are organizing themselves
into unions might be another
target, especially those work
ers in government jobs who
are revolting against their mis
erable working conditions.
Finally, McCloskey's plan
will remove a whole age brac
ket from the labor pool. This
will artificially and temporarily
ease the increasing numbers
who comprise the un
employed. However, the pro
cess will be mystifying, for
once many of the young
people finish their stint they
will find few job prospects.
However, at this point it will be
"their own fault."
It has been reported by the
Daily that McCloskey thinks
that the GOP is "devoid of
thought." Although I do not
subscribe to a "conspiracy
theory" as an explanation for
the functioning of America, I
- do not believe that McCloskey
and his associates are unaware
of the benefits that might acrue
to American capitalists and the
American capitalist state if
McCloskey's National Service
Plan is adopted. I think it's time
we called the Congressper
son's bluff.
