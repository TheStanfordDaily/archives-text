## Defending Christian spirit 
### 
I was disturbed by David Mil
ler's denunciation of Christian
ity and the "Christmas spirit"
(Daily, Nov. 22), because it
seemed to display a vast mis
understanding of the Christian
message. I will not argue
whether or not our "post-
Christian world" should return
to Christianity. But I do want to
comment on Miller's particular
views of Christianity, its de
mands on the individual and
its effect on the world.
Miller claims that Christian
ity is false since )esus'
geneologies don't agree in the
gospels of Matthew and Luke.
This seems a trivial point on
which to reject all of Christian
ity, especially since the key to
Christianity is the teachings of
Christ.
But Miller says, "Both events
and teachings differ in order
and content among the four
gospels." It is true that the
order of events in the four gos
pels differs. This is in keeping
with the fact that the gospel
writers were not concerned
with writing chronological
biographies of Christ. Their in
tent was to bring together
(each in his own manner) the
many events of Christ's minis
try in such a way as to explain
the purpose, lesson and effect
of Christ's life on earth. Furth
ermore, despite Miller's impli
cation, in relaying to us the
teachings of Christ, the gos
pels do not contradict each
other as to the content of that
teaching.
Miller says Christ's com
mand to "turn the other
cheek" would "place the world
at the mercy of thieves, tyrants,
and murderers." But this
command by Christ was ad
dressed to individuals. The
Bible in several places affirms
the authority of the state to
punish the wrongdoing that

thieves, tyrants, and murder
ers would be guilty of.
Miller criticizes Christianity
for its "impossible code of
morality" and"the promise
that any sin will be forgiven." It
is true that Christianity teaches
that all people are sinners de
spite their personal efforts, i.e.
that no human is, nor can be,
perfect. But rather than give in
to the pressures for a more
"reasonable" morality, Christ
insisted that his followers try to
get as close as possible to the
unreachable standards of per
sonal morality he set.
Christ being the only perfect
human, he told his followers
that he would send them his
Spirit to guide and help them
as they tried (and still try) to live
up to his standards. It is that
Spirit, the spirit of a man who
gave himself to others in per
fect love, which is the "Christ
mas spirit" that many people
feel is lacking in our "post-
Christian world" and its celeb
ration of Christmas.
If God had not offered man
forgiveness of sin, it would be
devastating to even try to live
up to Christ's impossible stan
dards. It is true that some
people abuse this privilege of
forgiveness as a sign of his love
and try to give that love in turn
to the people around them,
especially during the Christ
mas season.
Miller denounces Christian
morality for its part in the
Crusades, massacres of here
tics and Jews, etc. But such a
one-sided approach is unfair.
Christian morality has also led
to the helping of many people
in need. Non-Christians and
atheists have also participated
in massacres, e.g. in the many
purges in Communist Russian
and China. These examples
just help to underscore the
Christian claim that nobody is

perfect, that "all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of
Cod."
Finally, Miller claims "Christ
ianity is a religion fit only for
slaves. It is a religion for those
who reject personal autonomy
and responsibility, for those
who refuse to think for them
selves or make their own moral
decisions." This is simply not
true. Cod places a full burden
of responsibility on us in insist
ing upon such a high level of
morality. He requires us to
think for ourselves by making
our every action a moral action
requiring a moral decision.
If God wants me to live a life
of love in which everything I do
should manifest his Spirit of
love then I have no easy way
out. I must decide for myself at
every moment what is my most
moral act, my most loving ac
tion.
Many Christians have looked
at the over-commercialization
of Christmas and tried to point
out that the Spirit of love of the
man whose birth is celebrated
at Christmas seems to be lack
ing today. They have looked at
their own lives as well as
others', and they are con
cerned that they and we are not
living up to the high-level mor
ality of love that Christmas was
meant to call forth from us.
We have been commer
cialized too. It is our moral re
sponsibility, both Christian
and non-Christian, to fight the
tendencies of over
commercialization which sap
us of the morality of love we
seek to follow. Therefore, let
us look around us and within
ourselves, and try to find and
encourage that spirit of love
and giving which is the Christ
mas spirit.

ity is false since )esus'
geneologies don't agree in the
gospels of Matthew and Luke.
This seems a trivial point on
which to reject all of Christian
ity, especially since the key to
Christianity is the teachings of
Christ.
But Miller says, "Both events
and teachings differ in order
and content among the four
gospels." It is true that the
order of events in the four gos
pels differs. This is in keeping
with the fact that the gospel
writers were not concerned
with writing chronological
biographies of Christ. Their in
tent was to bring together
(each in his own manner) the
many events of Christ's minis
try in such a way as to explain
the purpose, lesson and effect
of Christ's life on earth. Furth
ermore, despite Miller's impli
cation, in relaying to us the
teachings of Christ, the gos
pels do not contradict each
other as to the content of that
teaching.
Miller says Christ's com
mand to "turn the other
cheek" would "place the world
at the mercy of thieves, tyrants,
and murderers." But this
command by Christ was ad
dressed to individuals. The
Bible in several places affirms
the authority of the state to
punish the wrongdoing that

thieves, tyrants, and murder
ers would be guilty of.
Miller criticizes Christianity
for its "impossible code of
morality" and"the promise
that any sin will be forgiven." It
is true that Christianity teaches
that all people are sinners de
spite their personal efforts, i.e.
that no human is, nor can be,
perfect. But rather than give in
to the pressures for a more
"reasonable" morality, Christ
insisted that his followers try to
get as close as possible to the
unreachable standards of per
sonal morality he set.
Christ being the only perfect
human, he told his followers
that he would send them his
Spirit to guide and help them
as they tried (and still try) to live
up to his standards. It is that
Spirit, the spirit of a man who
gave himself to others in per
fect love, which is the "Christ
mas spirit" that many people
feel is lacking in our "post-
Christian world" and its celeb
ration of Christmas.
If God had not offered man
forgiveness of sin, it would be
devastating to even try to live
up to Christ's impossible stan
dards. It is true that some
people abuse this privilege of
forgiveness as a sign of his love
and try to give that love in turn
to the people around them,
especially during the Christ
mas season.
Miller denounces Christian
morality for its part in the
Crusades, massacres of here
tics and Jews, etc. But such a
one-sided approach is unfair.
Christian morality has also led
to the helping of many people
in need. Non-Christians and
atheists have also participated
in massacres, e.g. in the many
purges in Communist Russian
and China. These examples
just help to underscore the
Christian claim that nobody is

perfect, that "all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of
Cod."
Finally, Miller claims "Christ
ianity is a religion fit only for
slaves. It is a religion for those
who reject personal autonomy
and responsibility, for those
who refuse to think for them
selves or make their own moral
decisions." This is simply not
true. Cod places a full burden
of responsibility on us in insist
ing upon such a high level of
morality. He requires us to
think for ourselves by making
our every action a moral action
requiring a moral decision.
If God wants me to live a life
of love in which everything I do
should manifest his Spirit of
love then I have no easy way
out. I must decide for myself at
every moment what is my most
moral act, my most loving ac
tion.
Many Christians have looked
at the over-commercialization
of Christmas and tried to point
out that the Spirit of love of the
man whose birth is celebrated
at Christmas seems to be lack
ing today. They have looked at
their own lives as well as
others', and they are con
cerned that they and we are not
living up to the high-level mor
ality of love that Christmas was
meant to call forth from us.
We have been commer
cialized too. It is our moral re
sponsibility, both Christian
and non-Christian, to fight the
tendencies of over
commercialization which sap
us of the morality of love we
seek to follow. Therefore, let
us look around us and within
ourselves, and try to find and
encourage that spirit of love
and giving which is the Christ
mas spirit.

I was disturbed by David Mil

(Daily, Nov. 22), because it
seemed to display a vast mis

whether or not our "post-

with writing chronological
biographies of Christ. Their in
tent was to bring together
(each in his own manner) the
many events of Christ's minis
try in such a way as to explain
the purpose, lesson and effect
of Christ's life on earth. Furth
ermore, despite Miller's impli
cation, in relaying to us the
teachings of Christ, the gos
pels do not contradict each
other as to the content of that
teaching.
Miller says Christ's com
mand to "turn the other
cheek" would "place the world
at the mercy of thieves, tyrants,
and murderers." But this
command by Christ was ad
dressed to individuals. The
Bible in several places affirms
the authority of the state to
punish the wrongdoing that

thieves, tyrants, and murder
ers would be guilty of.
Miller criticizes Christianity
for its "impossible code of
morality" and"the promise
that any sin will be forgiven." It
is true that Christianity teaches
that all people are sinners de
spite their personal efforts, i.e.
that no human is, nor can be,
perfect. But rather than give in
to the pressures for a more
"reasonable" morality, Christ
insisted that his followers try to
get as close as possible to the
unreachable standards of per
sonal morality he set.
Christ being the only perfect
human, he told his followers
that he would send them his
Spirit to guide and help them
as they tried (and still try) to live
up to his standards. It is that
Spirit, the spirit of a man who
gave himself to others in per
fect love, which is the "Christ
mas spirit" that many people
feel is lacking in our "post-
Christian world" and its celeb
ration of Christmas.
If God had not offered man
forgiveness of sin, it would be
devastating to even try to live
up to Christ's impossible stan
dards. It is true that some
people abuse this privilege of
forgiveness as a sign of his love
and try to give that love in turn
to the people around them,
especially during the Christ
mas season.
Miller denounces Christian
morality for its part in the
Crusades, massacres of here
tics and Jews, etc. But such a
one-sided approach is unfair.
Christian morality has also led
to the helping of many people
in need. Non-Christians and
atheists have also participated
in massacres, e.g. in the many
purges in Communist Russian
and China. These examples
just help to underscore the
Christian claim that nobody is

perfect, that "all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of
Cod."
Finally, Miller claims "Christ
ianity is a religion fit only for
slaves. It is a religion for those
who reject personal autonomy
and responsibility, for those
who refuse to think for them
selves or make their own moral
decisions." This is simply not
true. Cod places a full burden
of responsibility on us in insist
ing upon such a high level of
morality. He requires us to
think for ourselves by making
our every action a moral action
requiring a moral decision.
If God wants me to live a life
of love in which everything I do
should manifest his Spirit of
love then I have no easy way
out. I must decide for myself at
every moment what is my most
moral act, my most loving ac
tion.
Many Christians have looked
at the over-commercialization
of Christmas and tried to point
out that the Spirit of love of the
man whose birth is celebrated
at Christmas seems to be lack
ing today. They have looked at
their own lives as well as
others', and they are con
cerned that they and we are not
living up to the high-level mor
ality of love that Christmas was
meant to call forth from us.
We have been commer
cialized too. It is our moral re
sponsibility, both Christian
and non-Christian, to fight the
tendencies of over
commercialization which sap
us of the morality of love we
seek to follow. Therefore, let
us look around us and within
ourselves, and try to find and
encourage that spirit of love
and giving which is the Christ
mas spirit.
