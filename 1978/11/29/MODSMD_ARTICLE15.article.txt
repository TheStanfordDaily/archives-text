# Southern Cal beaches are dying
## Coastline disappearing into sea 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The beaches of
Southern California are dying. Geologists
and engineers warn that much of the
sandy coastline, ravaged by nature and
starved by man, is disappearing into the
sea.
Once the rivers fed the beaches, collect
ing sand from the inland mountains to re
place that stolen from the coast by waves
and surf. The balance of nature at its amaz
ing best.
But along came civilized man and one
by-one the flood-prone rivers that flow
west out of the Coast Range were tamed by
giant dams and concrete channels. Sand
no longer tumbles freely to the sea.
Instead of feeding the beaches, says
Brent Taylor of the California Institute of
Technology, "it's going into our flood
control reservoirs and in our water supply
reservoirs. The reservoirs are gradually fil
ling up with sediments" needed by the
beaches for survival.
Bridging gap
To rescue the beaches, he said, convoys
of dump trucks or giant pipelines may
have to do the rivers' work, shuttling sand
from clogged reservoirs to the hungry

coast — a situation of man having to bridge
a gap in nature's cycle that he once spent
millions to carve out.
Taylor is heading a 3-year-old study by
Caltech's Environmental Quality Laborat
ory and the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. The continuing study,
which involves nine major rivers between
Point Conception and the Mexican bor
der, is to assess the damage and seek solu
tions.
"It looks like about a million cubic yards
of sand a year is being delivered to the
southern shoreline by the major rivers arid
. . . streams," Taylor said. "Under natural
conditions, you'd be delivering maybe
two million cubic yards."
Dams blamed
He blames most of the loss on dams
built throughout the region.
Yet others believe nature is mostly to
blame.
"Up until last winter, we've had a
drought cycle of at least 10 years. The riv
ers haven't had enough water in them to
deliver the sand, whether or not they had
dams on them," said Perry Davis, execu
tive assistant to the U.S. Army Corps of

Engineers' district engineer.
A classic example of man's impact on the
shoreline is the cobblestone beach at
Oceanside. Once, Taylor said, the stones
were covered by a layer of sand.
But, he said, the San Luis Rey River was
dammed in 1927 and the San Marguerita in
1947. "Our studies indicate that the reduc
tion in sand and sediment carried to
Oceanside has been 30 to 50 percent on
those two rivers."
Military harbor
And then there's the nearby military
harbor, built during World War 11, that "in
terferes with the natural transportation of
sand down the coast."
Wave action carries sand continually
southward, taking from one beach to give
to another. Some also disappears along
the way, sliding into undersea canyons
near the coast.
"These things have starved the beach,"
Taylor said. The harbor blocks the sand
drifting down from northern beaches and
dams take what the river once supplied.
"So now you've got a cobblestone
beach — all you have left are the larger
particles that the waves can't move."

dams take what the river once supplied.
"So now you've got a cobblestone
beach — all you have left are the larger
particles that the waves can't move."
Los Angeles (AP) — The beaches of
Southern California are dying. Geologists
and engineers warn that much of the
sandy coastline, ravaged by nature and
starved by man, is disappearing into the
sea.
Once the rivers fed the beaches, collect
ing sand from the inland mountains to re
place that stolen from the coast by waves
and surf. The balance of nature at its amaz
ing best.
But along came civilized man and one
by-one the flood-prone rivers that flow
west out of the Coast Range were tamed by
giant dams and concrete channels. Sand
no longer tumbles freely to the sea.
Instead of feeding the beaches, says
Brent Taylor of the California Institute of
Technology, "it's going into our flood
control reservoirs and in our water supply
reservoirs. The reservoirs are gradually fil
ling up with sediments" needed by the
beaches for survival.
Bridging gap
To rescue the beaches, he said, convoys
of dump trucks or giant pipelines may
have to do the rivers' work, shuttling sand
from clogged reservoirs to the hungry

coast — a situation of man having to bridge
a gap in nature's cycle that he once spent
millions to carve out.
Taylor is heading a 3-year-old study by
Caltech's Environmental Quality Laborat
ory and the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. The continuing study,
which involves nine major rivers between
Point Conception and the Mexican bor
der, is to assess the damage and seek solu
tions.
"It looks like about a million cubic yards
of sand a year is being delivered to the
southern shoreline by the major rivers arid
. . . streams," Taylor said. "Under natural
conditions, you'd be delivering maybe
two million cubic yards."
Dams blamed
He blames most of the loss on dams
built throughout the region.
Yet others believe nature is mostly to
blame.
"Up until last winter, we've had a
drought cycle of at least 10 years. The riv
ers haven't had enough water in them to
deliver the sand, whether or not they had
dams on them," said Perry Davis, execu
tive assistant to the U.S. Army Corps of

Engineers' district engineer.
A classic example of man's impact on the
shoreline is the cobblestone beach at
Oceanside. Once, Taylor said, the stones
were covered by a layer of sand.
But, he said, the San Luis Rey River was
dammed in 1927 and the San Marguerita in
1947. "Our studies indicate that the reduc
tion in sand and sediment carried to
Oceanside has been 30 to 50 percent on
those two rivers."
Military harbor
And then there's the nearby military
harbor, built during World War 11, that "in
terferes with the natural transportation of
sand down the coast."
Wave action carries sand continually
southward, taking from one beach to give
to another. Some also disappears along
the way, sliding into undersea canyons
near the coast.
"These things have starved the beach,"
Taylor said. The harbor blocks the sand
drifting down from northern beaches and
dams take what the river once supplied.
