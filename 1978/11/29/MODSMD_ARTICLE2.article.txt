# University department gets challenge grants
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
The National Endowment for the
Humanities recently made two chal
lenge grants to the University in an
attempt to stimulate University fun
draising for the humanities and to
strengthen the financial base of the
Stanford University Press, according
to Assistant Provost Michael Oman.
Oman said the proffered grant of
$1.5 million over a three-year period
for humanities programs is the
largest such funding ever awarded to
a university and called.it "a tribute to
Stanford."
Stanford University Press received
a promise for $100,000 to extend over
the same three years. Press director
Leon Seltzer stated that "as far as I
know, we are the first to get this type
of grant."
The University, however, must
earn these grants by matching every
federally-donated dollar with three
dollars in private gift support to be
obtained from either new gifts or in
creased levels of monetary support
from previous donors.
Oman said the University has "ev
ery expectation of meeting the go
als" provided by the challenge. He
added that fundraisers will continue
to use the same methods as those

practiced during their recently
completed donation drive.
According to Oman, the
humanities grant will be used to sub
sidize four particular areas of import
within the Department of
Humanities and Sciences: the
purchase of library books, the foun
dation of endowed chairs in the de
partment to be determined by donor
interest, the support of the Center
for Research in International Studies
and the renovation of the History
corner of the Quad.
The Center for Research in Inter
national Studies acts as the coor
dinator and administraitive center
for research in teaching and studying
international relations in the defined
area fields of Eastern Asia, Latin
America, Africa and Eastern Euro
pean and Slavic nations.
Seltzer said that university presses
exist to publish scholarly works
within a small market, which he cal
led "uneconomical." Income forthis
activity is usually derived from the
University, the government or other
types of scholarly organizations. The
$100,000 grant will fortify fiscal
means for the publication of works of
history, philosophy, literature, the
arts and cultural anthropology, he
said.
