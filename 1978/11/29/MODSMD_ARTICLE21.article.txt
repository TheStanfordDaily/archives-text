# X-mas comes early for Thompson
## Pac-10 coaches overlook Dils 
### 
Stanford's Darrin Nelson,
Gordy Ceresino and Ken
Margerum, each tabbed for
first-team All-Coast honors last
week, were named to the first
team All-Pacific-10 football
squad yesterday after a vote by
the conference coaches. But
Stanford's All-Coast quarter
back Steve Dils, who led the
nation in passing this season,
was edged by Washington
State's Jack Thompson for
first-team honors.
Joining Dils on the second
squad were Stanford offensive
linemen John Macaulay, Jim
Stephens and Gene Engle, and
Cardinal safety Robby Chap
man. Macaulay's selection was

particularly impressive as the
sophomore center did not start
until the sixth game of the sea
son. He was also named to the
second-team All-Coast squad,
as were Engle, Stephens and
Chapman.
Nelson, a repeater from last
year's squad, was the only
unanimous selection to the of
fensive team. UCLA linebacker
Jerry Robinson, Washington
linebacker Michael Jackson
and UCLA safety Kenny Easley
were the only other unanim
ous picks.
Today the conference will
name the Most Valuable Player
and the AII-Pac-10 Coach.

Ken Margerum (28) looks for a Dils pass against San Jose State. The
numerous catches that followed those looks earned the sophomore
wide receiver first team All Pac-10 honors, though Dils, the leading
passer in the nation, had to settle for second team.
