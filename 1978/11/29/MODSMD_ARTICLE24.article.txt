### CHRIS HAFT 
Stanford's basketball squad
literally faces a "big" test to
morrow night at 8 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion against the
Santa Clara Broncos.
The 1-1 Cardinals, a team
with only mediocre size, will
doubtlessly confront the prob
lem of being physically over
matched many times this sea
son. Tomorrow night's game
marks the first such occasion.
Santa Clara coach Carroll
Williams, who directed a 93-67
victory over Nebraska-Omaha
last Friday, will probably start a
front line whose proportions
are actually similar to Stan
ford's.
Bespectacled Kurt Rambis is
at one forward spot. The
6-foot-8 junior paced the Bron

cos in scoring last season with a
13.7 average, and was one of
the West Coast's top reboun
ders, grabbing 8.5 boards an
outing. Rambis opened strong
against Nebraska-Omaha, col
lecting 20 points.
joining Rambis in the
forecourt will be forward Gary
Carpenter, a 6-5 junior, and
6-10 sophomore Mark
McNamara, who returns at
center. McNamara had an im
pressive rookie season in
1977-78, averaging 11.4 points
and 6.7 rebounds a contest.
Against Nebraska-Omaha he
tallied 18 points.
The Broncos' bench looms
large over the Cards', how
ever. It is well-stocked with
giants like 6-8 sophomore
Steve Wallace, 6-9 senior Mark

Breuning and 6-10 senior Korky
Nelson.
Junior Londale Theus, a 13.5
scorer a year ago, is Santa Cla
ra's backcourt ace. Theus' 21
points led the Broncos' offen
sive attack Friday night when it
setc jchool record by shooting
66 percent from the field.
Stanford will be trying to
duplicate last year's exciting
69-67 triumph over the Bron
cos. Forward Kimberly Belton
tops the Cards' scoring after
two games with a 21.0 average,
followed closely by guard
Wolfe Perry's 19.0.
Coach Dick Di√üiaso's men
have suffered freethrow shoot
ing difficulties, making just 21
of 36 charity tosses their first
two contests.
