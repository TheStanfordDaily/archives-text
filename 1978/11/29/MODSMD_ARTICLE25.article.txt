# Oklahoma's Sims claims the Heisman
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” In the second closest vote
in history, Billy Sims, Oklahoma's record
setting running back, won the 44th annual
Heisman Trophy yesterday although he re
ceived 12 fewer first-place votes than Penn
State quarterback Chuck Fusina.
Sims, a 6-foot, 205-pound blend of power
and speed, came to Oklahoma from Hooks,
Tex., in 1975 as one of the most heavily re
cruited players ever but suffered a string of
nagging injuries and was redshirted while
missing almost all of the 1976 season.
This year, however, he is the nation's lead
ing rusher and scorer and smashed the Ok
lahoma and Big Eight Conference single
season records by romping for 1762 yards in
11 games and averaging 7.6 yards per carry
while scoring 20 touchdowns. During the
season, he tied a national record by rushing
for 200 or more yards in three consecutive
games.
Michigan quarterback Rick Leach finished
third and Charles White, Southern Califor
nia's junior tailback, was fourth.
Stanford quarterback Steve Dils, the
NCAA's leading passer, did not finish among
the top 10 vote-getters.
