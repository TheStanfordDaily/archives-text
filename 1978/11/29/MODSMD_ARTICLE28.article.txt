Inflation reaches 9.6 percent
Washington — A dollar will buy only half as much
as it did 11 years ago, the government said yester
day as it released figures showing a new surge in
food prices last month.
In its monthly report on inflation, the Labor De
partment said increases in beef, poultry and pork
prices in October helped push consumer prices
up .8 percent for the second straight month — a
rate of 9.6 percent if averaged over the entire year.
President Carter's chief inflation adviser called
the new figures "God-awful."
Prices have risen 8.9 percent in the past year,
and most economists have predicted the 1978 in
flation rate will end up between 8.5 percent and 9
percent.
The costs of food, housing and fuel are more
than double what they were in 1967.
Food is 116 percent more expensive, housing
109 percent and fuel 120 percent. The price of
clothing is up 63 percent since 1967, the index
shows, and medical costs are up 89 percent.
The Labor Department report showed the aver
age worker's purchasing power, after taxes, de
clined .1 percent in October, the sixth decline this
year.
Warsaw talks split over budget
Vienna, Austria — Maverick Romanian leader
Nicolae Ceausescu's opposition to increasing
Warsaw Pact defense spending has prompted
other pact members to recall their envoys from
Romania, sources in Bucharest said yesterday.
The diplomatic sources said by telephone that
ambassadors from the Soviet Union, Poland,
Hungary, Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechos
lovakia departed Bucharest by special planes yes
terday "for consultations."
Communist Party chief Ceausescu, 60, has
angered Moscow before for his independent
minded foreign policy, but he runs a rigid Com
munist society at home.
The Romanian news agency Agerpres quoted
Ceausescu as telling applauding military and gov
ernment leaders in the speech that the Warsaw
Pact and NATO nations already had the means "to
destroy the whole of mankind several times.
"In the light of this situation, one may ask what
is the purpose of this faster-paced production of
new weapons? How many more times is mankind
to be wiped out?" he was quoted as saying.
Observers here said it was too early to assess the
implications of the moves, buttheysaid it undoub
tedly indicated a new low in Soviet-Romanian rela
tions.
Clark testifies on King murder
Washington — Former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark testified yesterday he kept the Justice De
partment from taking an active role in the investi
gation of Martin Luther King )r.'s assassination be
cause he feared worsening relations with FBI Di

rector J. Edgar Hoover.
Clark told the House assassinations committee
he viewed his role as one of showing concern,
encouraging the fullest FBI investigation possible
and keeping track of its progress.
He said that even a decade after the King assas
sination, nothing causes him to believe a more
thorough investigation would have resulted from
the day-to-day participation of Justice Department
lawyers.
"And it probably would have been worse in
terms of already strained relations," he said, refer
ring to his widely publicized differences with
Hoover at the time.
Clark said that while he had frequent disagree
ments with Hoover over various law enforcement
issues, including the use of wiretaps, he does not
believe the King investigation should have been
handled any differently.
The committee has said the Justice Department
failed to use investigative techniques such as con
vening a grand jury or creating a strike force to
make sure any conspiracy in the King killing was
uncovered.
Judge rules on lesbian firings
Boise, Idaho —A federal judge has ruled that the
city of Boise improperly fired six female police
employees last year after what he called an "abys
mal" investigation into alleged lesbian activity.
The women, who have not denied they are les
bians, sued the city for $10 million, claiming that
their constitutional rights of due process were vio
lated and that the city broke its own civil service
rules by denying them hearings.
U.S. District Judge Ray McNichols, in a partial
judgment issued Monday, said he could not un
derstand "a city the size of this (about 100,000
people) with the help it has available to it, going
through such an operation in 1977."
He did not order the women reinstated, but he
ordered attorneys for both sides to prepare
memoranda on damages and indicated arguments
may be held next spring on the women's request
for $10 million plus legal costs.
Chief of Police John Church, a defendant in the
suit along with Mayor Dick Eardley and the 1977
City Council members, said yesterday he was sur
prised at the decision.
The investigation was launched after citizen
complaints that the women were seen in public as
lesbian couples and made no secret of their sexual
preferences.
Peking poster attacks Mao
Tokyo — Another wall poster attacking Mao
Tse-tung went up in Peking yesterday within 24
hours of Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's sugges
tion that critics should lay off of the "great
helmsman" who died two years ago.
In Tienanmen Square, thousands of Chinese
gathered Tuesday night to demand more political

and economic democracy and the rehabilitation of
some leaders cashiered during Mao's Cultural Re
volution of the late 19605.
Japan's Kyodo news service said the latest
anti-Mao poster, signed by restaurant workers,
accused Mao of making the state his own prop
erty, like a feudal king.
Teng, 74, was himself a victim of Mao and radi
cals led by Mao's wife, Chiang Ching, and was
disgraced and demoted in the cultural purge. Re
stored in 1973, he fell from grace a second time in
1976. But he has been back in power since July
1977.
The first attack on the once-sacred image of Mao
came two weeks ago, followed by flurries of wall
posters in the same vein.
Teng was quoted Tuesday by China's official
Hsinhua news agency as saying the right to con
duct the wall poster campaign is guaranteed by the
constitution and described the posters as an ex
pression of democracy approved by the Com
munist Party.
Steelworkers strike in Germany
Essen, West Germany — For the first time in 50
years, steelworkers in the industrial heartland of
West Germany went on strike yesterday to press
their demands for 5 percent more pay and a 35-
hour work week.
Employers of the 37,000 strikers countered with
the announcement that they intend to lock out
29,000 workers at eight other plants on Friday. A
spokesman for the employers said he anticipated
the move will cut the strike short.
Before the employers made their final offer last
week of a 3 percent pay increase and six full weeks
vacation, nearly 90 percent of the powerful IG
Metall union's 208,000 members had voted to
strike. The average wage for a steelworker now is
$1,190 a month.
Most of the struck plants produce parts and
accessories for the automobile industry in the
northwest German industrial Ruhr area and in the
cities of Bremen and Osnabrueck.
The last conflict in the German steel industry
began Nov. 1, 1928, when employers locked out
200,000 workers for refusing a mediated contract
offer. That dispute lasted a month.
