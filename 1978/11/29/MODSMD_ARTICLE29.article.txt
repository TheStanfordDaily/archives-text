### 
Cincinnati (AP) — The Cincinnati
Reds have fired one of baseball's
nice-guy managers and replaced him
with another man known for rapport
with his players.
Saying they wanted a new ap
proach, the Reds fired Sparky Ander
son after nine years and hired twice
fired John McNamara yesterday.
Anderson guided the Reds to con
secutive world championships in
1975 and 1976 — Cincinnati's first
World Series triumphs since 1940.
But even though he had compiled
one of the best managerial records in
baseball, Anderson was dismissed
after the Reds finished in second
place the last two years.
The job was offered to McNamara,
46, who has been managing a last
place team in the Dominican Repub
lic winter leagues.
"I had hoped to get one more op
portunity at managing," said
McNamara.
Anderson, the winningest man
ager in Cincinnati history, hopes to

stay in baseball. "I just hope I've
made a big enough impression on
this game that someone will come
calling," Anderson said from his
home in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Reds' president Dick Wagner, who
earlier in the day, declined to explain
the firings, said in a radio interview
that the team lost its aggressiveness
under Anderson.
"We've got to be an aggressive
ballclub on the field. I didn't feel he
did that this year. I don't think we can
sit back on our laurels. With the per
sonnel we have, you can't finish
where we finished. You just can't sit
back and let the ballclub go dow
nhill."
Anderson, a surprise choice when
he was hired by the Reds in 1969,
became one of the most successful
managers in baseball, winning two
world championships, five division
titles, and four National League pen
nants. He has a 863-586 record, an
average of almost % victories a year.
The two-time National League
Manager of the Year said he was
stunned when Reds' President Dick
Wagner flew out to California Mon
day with the decision.
