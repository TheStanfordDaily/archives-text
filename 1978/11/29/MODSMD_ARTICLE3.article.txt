# Council delays issuance of new liquor licenses
## 
### ROD STEVENS 
The Palo Alto City Council passed a
moratorium last week on the is
suance of new liquor licenses. The
action temporarily supplants a recent
state decision, effective )an. 1, to lift
the ban on liquor stores located
within Vh miles of universities and
colleges.
The six-month moratorium, which
passed by a 6-1 vote, will take effect
immediately.
Palo Alto residents asked the city
council to take action after Bel
tramo's Liquors, of Menlo Park,
applied fora license on the corner of
Bryson and Middlefield roads.
The University, which lies outside
the city of Palo Alto's jurisdiction, is
not affected by the moratorium. Uni
versity attorneys were unable to
comment on whether it will be legal
to sell packaged liquor on campus.
|ohn Beltramo, an owner of the
store, described the council's action
as "unfair," since he had already
applied for the permit. Beltramo said
he had filed all of the appropriate

forms for a license, checked zoning
laws and received no protests from
the city concerning his choice of site.
Beltramo said that in building a
new store he was motivated by the
potential neighborhood demand
and not the store's proximity to the
college campus.
"The undergraduate population
alone would not justify building a
store close to campus, although
graduates buy a lot of wine," he said.
"We plan to continue fighting for
that location," he added.
Lou Green, a Palo Alto assistant
city attorney, said he expects the
moratorium to be lifted by the coun
cil before the six month period ends.
"My feeling is that the council will
soon pass zoning legislation that will
be more restricting," he said.
Stan Nowicki, a Palo Alto planning
department official, said he believes
the council will eventually opt for
conditional-use permits in issuing
liquor store licenses. Such permits
will restrict business hours and the
distance between stores.
