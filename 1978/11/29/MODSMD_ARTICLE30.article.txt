The last staff lunch of the quarter
will be held today at noon. Plans for
the banquet will be announced, and
sandwiches will be provided.
Milk Memorial Fund
A fund has been set up in memory
of Harvey Milk, who was slain in San
Francisco Monday. The Cay Peoples
Union here is making a contribution
to this fund in the name of Stanford
University. Anyone interested in
contributing to the fund should send
a check made out to Stanford GPU to
P.O. Box 8265, Stanford, Ca., 94305.
Correction
In yesterday's article on the Uni
versity pledge program, Roberta
Sueda was incorrectly identified as
the 1977-78 chairman of the program.
Sueda was actually acting as a
spokesman for the program.
Senior portraits
Seniors who have not made ap
pointments to have portraits taken
this week are urged to drop by the
lobby of Old Union at their conveni
ence. Photos are being taken
through Friday at Old Union, and
Monday at the Quad office, between
the hours of 9a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to
5 p.m.
