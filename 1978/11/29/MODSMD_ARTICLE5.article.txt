# U.S.-Soviet military force equal

### MONIKA GUTTMAN 
"The past decade has seen a
change from U.S. military superiority
to a rough equivalence with Russia,"
said Richard McCormack yesterday
at the Bechtel l-Center's Tuesday
luncheon series.
The former deputy political ad
visor for the U.S. mission to NATO
spoke about "The Current Issues and
Political Developments Within
NATO."
"There is an intensity in this coun
try on security matters and questions
of national security," he said. "I seea

ferocious debate surrounding the
threat of Russian military buildup."
McCormack spoke before an au
dience of 35 on the challenges facing
NATO.
"Actually, there has been a fairly
consistent level of military spending
in the USSR," he said. "There hasn't
been any real increase.
"What has happened, however,
has been an increasing qualitative
improvement of military equipment,
such as tactical aircraft," he added.
"This increases the possibility of
rapid penetration by the USSR."

McCormack attributed Russia's
rapid military expansion partially to
the fact that a large percentage of the
nation's gross national product
(CNP) is devoted to military budget.
"Free societies, like those in the
West, do not devote as much to
military spending," he said. "Russia
applies approximately 11 to 15 per
cent of their CNP to defense, while in
the alliance as a whole (NATO) it's
only been .5 percent."
According to McCormack, this
places pressure on the Western gov
ernments.
"The Carter administration saw
that a special effort was required to
improve the military, particularly be
cause of Russian improvements
while the U.S. was involved in
Southeast Asia," he said.
Thus the priority of the past year
has been long-term defense,
McCormack stated.
"This is not so new, and actually
uses old studies as a basis," he said.
"But what is new is that it looks ahead
more than five years. We see plans of
10 years and more into the future."
But McCormack mentioned prob
lems inherent in the NATO alliance
which do not affect nations in the
Warsaw pact.
"Within the Warsaw countries,
weapons are much more standar
dized, and trnd to ho Soviet made,"
he said. "Among the NATO coun
tries, it tends to be somewhat of a
museum."
He cited as evidence the fact that
there are many guns within the West
which are of the same caliber but
can't fire the same ammunition.
"This is a duplication of defense
efforts within the NATO countries,"
he said. "There is a need to standar
dize.
"Standardization would save
money," he added, "but there is a

suspicion on the part of European
allies that this would mean 'buy
American.' "
When asked if the economic dif
ferences between the U.S. and
Europe posed a problem to the al
liance, McCormack replied that so
far it hasn't.
"The U.S. is more concerned for
the overall economic health of these
nations rather than economic com
petition," he said.
McCormack pointed out that other
problems with the alliance are
created because NATO is operated
on a consensus basis, and the U.S.
doesn't dominate the situation as
Russia dominates the Warsaw al
liance.
"NATO strategy was worked out
with great difficulty in the early '605,"
he said. "Any effort to change this
strategy creates a lot of psychological
disadvantages which the alliance
doesn't need."
McCormack said that neither side
has an advantage in terms of morale.
"There are problems on both
sides," he said, "which are really too
different to compare. There is more
public discussion of this in the West,
however."

spoke about "The Current Issues and
Political Developments Within
NATO."
"There is an intensity in this coun
try on security matters and questions
of national security," he said. "I seea

ferocious debate surrounding the
threat of Russian military buildup."
McCormack spoke before an au
dience of 35 on the challenges facing
NATO.
"Actually, there has been a fairly
consistent level of military spending
in the USSR," he said. "There hasn't
been any real increase.
"What has happened, however,
has been an increasing qualitative
improvement of military equipment,
such as tactical aircraft," he added.
"This increases the possibility of
rapid penetration by the USSR."

McCormack attributed Russia's
rapid military expansion partially to
the fact that a large percentage of the
nation's gross national product
(CNP) is devoted to military budget.
"Free societies, like those in the
West, do not devote as much to
military spending," he said. "Russia
applies approximately 11 to 15 per
cent of their CNP to defense, while in
the alliance as a whole (NATO) it's
only been .5 percent."
According to McCormack, this
places pressure on the Western gov
ernments.
"The Carter administration saw
that a special effort was required to
improve the military, particularly be
cause of Russian improvements
while the U.S. was involved in
Southeast Asia," he said.
Thus the priority of the past year
has been long-term defense,
McCormack stated.
"This is not so new, and actually
uses old studies as a basis," he said.
"But what is new is that it looks ahead
more than five years. We see plans of
10 years and more into the future."
But McCormack mentioned prob
lems inherent in the NATO alliance
which do not affect nations in the
Warsaw pact.
"Within the Warsaw countries,
weapons are much more standar
dized, and trnd to ho Soviet made,"
he said. "Among the NATO coun
tries, it tends to be somewhat of a
museum."
He cited as evidence the fact that
there are many guns within the West
which are of the same caliber but
can't fire the same ammunition.
"This is a duplication of defense
efforts within the NATO countries,"
he said. "There is a need to standar
dize.
"Standardization would save
money," he added, "but there is a

suspicion on the part of European
allies that this would mean 'buy
American.' "
When asked if the economic dif
ferences between the U.S. and
Europe posed a problem to the al
liance, McCormack replied that so
far it hasn't.
"The U.S. is more concerned for
the overall economic health of these
nations rather than economic com
petition," he said.
McCormack pointed out that other
problems with the alliance are
created because NATO is operated
on a consensus basis, and the U.S.
doesn't dominate the situation as
Russia dominates the Warsaw al
liance.
"NATO strategy was worked out
with great difficulty in the early '605,"
he said. "Any effort to change this
strategy creates a lot of psychological
disadvantages which the alliance
doesn't need."
McCormack said that neither side
has an advantage in terms of morale.
"There are problems on both
sides," he said, "which are really too
different to compare. There is more
public discussion of this in the West,
however."
"The past decade has seen a
change from U.S. military superiority
to a rough equivalence with Russia,"
