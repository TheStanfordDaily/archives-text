# Staff vital in expected collegiate problems

### KATHY ANDREWS 
Faculty members can be either part of the prob
lem or part of the solution to the reduced financial
base and enrollment problems which collegiate
institutions will be facing for the next 20 years,
according to Education Prof. Louis Mayhew.
Mayhew reached this conclusion in the course
of researching material for his latest book, which
tentatively will be titled The Viable College: An
Agenda for Institutional Vitality and Survival.
He explained that faculty members contribute
to rising education costs as they benefit from in
creasing salaries, fringe benefits and availability of
tenured positions, while assuming smaller teach
ing loads.
Yet faculty members may also be instrumental in
insuring their institution's viability. Their suppor
tive functions vary according to the type of institu
tion that employs them, Mayhew said.
External support
He explained that prestigious private and public
universities such as Stanford, Harvard and UC-
Berkeley receive much external research support
for their well-known professors. In addition to
providing financial resources, research support
enhances the institution's national reputation.
This prestige in turn increases the institution's at
tractiveness to prospective undergraduates and
graduate students, according to Mayhew.
"Like other universities, Stanford has been hit
by the shrinkage of several kinds of research
funds. But compared to schools in the rest of the
country, it's still in pretty good shape," Mayhew
said.
He added that the University's enrollment ap
plication figures have also maintained a high level
relative to other schools.
Star system
Institutions that establish a strong financial base
in the 19605, like Notre Dame and the University of
Southern California, may develop a "star system"
of faculty-building similar to Stanford's, Mayhew
said.
Other less prestigious schools can still use their
faculty as a powerful resource, he continued.
For these schools, Mayhew said, the degree to

which the institution's faculty performs well is re
lated to student application and retention rates.
"Students apply to a specific institution because
of location, cost, parental contact with the institu
tion or enrollment decisions by classmates and
friends.
"But whether they stay, once enrolled, seems
related to the degree of satisfaction with the social
environment and the academic program. Both of
these can be and are powerfully determined by the
faculty," he said.
Eastern example
Mayhew cited the changes in the incidence of
dropping out for a small eastern women's college
as an example of the influence the faculty exerts
on student retention rates. After faculty members
at the college were encouraged "to improve
themselves over the summer" by doing research
projects and taking courses, the drop-out rate de
creased significantly, Mayhew said.
Faculty members can also improve the col
legiate environment by making their courses more
interesting, becoming more involved in advising
and developing new academic programs, he said.
According to Mayhew, they can also exert influ
ence over institutional life by granting legitimacy
to proposals initiated by the president or his as
sociates. While boards of trustees give ultimate
approval to these proposals, it has traditionally
been faculty action which assigns legitimacy to
them.
Faculty impact
Presidents rarely seek legal approval for their
proposals from boards of trustees without first
securing faculty approval, Mayhew explained.
Thus, faculty members can have considerable im
pact on financial, curricular and personnel
policies, he said.
Mayhew also said that a new managerial style of
faculty administration will become increasingly
essential to an institution's ability to adjust to new
educational trends.
He stressed that, to some extent, all institutions
will be subject to such problems as sudden aggre
gate resource declines, obseletion of academic
fields and declines in faculty members' effective

ness.
At less prestigious institutions, solving major
faculty problems is relatively easy, according to
Mayhew. Through increased workloads, substitu
tion of full-time faculty membeis for lower-paid
part-time members, encouragement of faculty
participation in developmental programs and
transferral of members to new disciplines, ad
ministrators can maximize their faculty resources,
he said.
At highly prestigious universities, however,
major changes in faculty structure are not as easily
achieved, he explained. Because these faculty
members often consider themselves autonomous
and believe their research is vital to their institu
tion, they tend to assume a conservative stance on
faculty reorganization, Mayhew said.
In order to develop the flexibility necessary to
solve their problems, Mayhew recommended that
administrative officers use sanctions such as rec
ognition and salary adjustment to orchestrate fa
culty efforts for institutional purposes.
Officers should also assume such bureaucratic
responsibilities as redeployment of tenured posi
tions, Mayhew said. These positions should be
allocated where they can be best utilized in the
university as a whole, instead of being automati
cally refilled by the department, school or college
in which the vacancy occurred. In addition, offic
ers should develop specific criteria by which the
need for programs, departments, schools and col
leges can be reviewed, he said.
University adjustment
Mayhew said he believes the University will be
able to adjust well to the new educational envi
ronment. He gave the example of the central ad
ministration's decision to eliminate the geography
department because it no longer seemed to be a
growing and attractive field. Despite the consider
able antagonism this move generated at the time,
the administration carried their decision through,
according to Mayhew.
"Stanford's management structure makes it one
of the most flexible of its kind in the country,"
Mayhew said.
