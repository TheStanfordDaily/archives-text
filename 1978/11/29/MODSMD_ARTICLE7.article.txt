# San Francisco-a city for intellectuals, misfits
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — In the
chilly, beautiful city that has in
spired song and poetry, grief
hung like fog today amid a
plague of bizarre violence that
led residents to ask: "Why
does it happen here?"
"I feel so sorry for this city,"
said a citizen shaken by the
murder Monday of San Fran
cisco Mayor George Moscone
and Supervisor Harvey Milk.
"We've had the Zebra killers,
the Zodiac, the SLA, the
People's Temple and now this.
I don't know how much more
we can take."
Columnist Herb Caen,

among the most influential
men in town, summed up the
feelings of his city in yester
day's San Francisco Chronicle.
"Horror upon horror. Shock
upon shock," Caen wrote.
. .disbeliefstretchesonlyso
far. . . At the end of a week of
incredible headlines, all of us
were left stunned, exhausted,
overwhelmed by the flood of
bloody 'senseless' informa
tion.
. . Itwas all senseless. And
yet there must be a thread
connecting all this violence."
The thread that connected
Moscone and Milk, Caen said,

was one common to many of
their constituents: "They
loved San Francisco."
So did ]im Jones. And Char
lie Manson.
"This is every misfit's favo
rite city as well as the favorite
city of a lot of straight, normal
people," said San Francisco
Examiner editor and publisher
Reg Murphy.
"It's the most photogenic
city in the country," Murphy
added. "It contains some of
the brightest minds in America
. . . But there's an odd mixture
of the highly intellectual com
munity and the crazy commun

ity."
The "crazy community"
bloomed in the 19605. Long
haired young people calling
themselves "hippies" and
"flower children" swarmed
into the tawdry Haight-
Ashbury district.
The flower children were
hallucinating on drugs. "We
were riding on the wind," one
of them would remember. Her
name was Lynette "Squeaky"
Fromme. Years later, she
would try to kill a president.
She came to San Francisco
with the Charles Manson "fam
ily" in 1968. Manson, guru of a

band of young misfits, had pas
sed through Haight Ashbury
earlier, long enough to learn
the power of drugs and a word,
"Love." He took his "hippies"
to Los Angeles and ordered
mass murders.
In Haight Ashbury, teena
gers "freaked out" screaming
in the agony of LSD "bad
trips."
Some died after taking drugs
laced with strychnine. Some
committed murder. Those who
survived drifted to drug re
habilitation centers or moved
away.
But the plague they had
brought did not die. It festered
and burst in the '70s, San Fran
cisco's most violent decade
since the days of the Barbary
Coast.
In 1969 and 1970, a murderer
calling himself "Zodiac" sent
grisly coded messages to local
newspapers. "Killing people is
more fun than killing wild
game," he wrote. Zodiac's

missives have continued
sporadically. He has not been
caught. Police say he probably
killed six persons. He boasts of
slaying 37 victims.
In 1972, a midwestern
preacher, the Rev. )im lones
set up his People's Temple in
San Francisco's poor Fillmore
district.
'Zebra killers'
In 1973, a wave of random
street killings terrorized the
city. The "Zebra killers," struck
without warning, killing whites
at night.
In April 1974, it was over.
Four young Black Muslims
were arrested and charged
with 14 murders, seven as
saults, one rapeand an attemp
ted kidnapping. The Zebra
murderers were convicted in
1976 after the longest trial in
San Francisco history.
On Feb. 4, 1974, the daugh
ter of one of San Francisco's
first families — Patricia Hearst
— was kidnapped. Her travels

through the radical under
ground exposed a subculture
of disaffected young re
volutionaries known as The
Symbionese Liberation Army.
Six of them died that spring
in a shootout with Los Angeles
police. The otheis — Hearst
and Williamand Emily Harris —
drifted back to the only Ameri
can city where they could hide
— San Francisco. They eluded
police for 18 months before
their capture Sept. 18, 1975.
In 1976, Hearst, Sara Moore
and Squeaky Froome went to
prison. Radical groups such as
The New World Liberation
Front bombed buildings and
issued communiques.
In 1977, the plague seemed
to pass. City fathers remem
bered the town's old slogan,
"Everybody's Favorite City."
The city's large homosexual
population savored political
victory — election of the first
gay member of the city's Board
of Supervisors — Harvey Milk.
