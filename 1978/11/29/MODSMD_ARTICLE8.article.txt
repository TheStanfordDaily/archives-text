# Profs examine fertility rates in Victorian women

Behind the yawning facade
of the University Department
of Economics lies a mysterious
wealth of adventure. What
exactly are those bearded math
geniuses doing behind Enci
na's closed doors? Anything
but yawning!
Prof. Warren Sanderson is
one of the economists pre
sently immersed in intrigue.
He's researching Victorian
America fertility patterns. But
how does an economic histo
rian find himself studying 19th
century sexuality?

It all began approximately
three years ago when History
Prof. Carl Degler, a Pulitzer
prize winner, unearthed a ver
itable goldmine in the Univer
sity archives. Beneath the dust
of nearly 100 years' oblivion lay
an uncatalogued collection of
questionnaires dating from
1892 to 1913. They provide
first-time evidence concerning
the sexual behavior and con
traceptive practices of married
couples living in Victorian
America.
Economists are necessarily
interested in population de
terminism, said Sanderson.
Degler's startling discovery

swept him into a massive re
search project he had never
planned.
The questionnaires were cir
culated in the late 1800s by a
woman doctor, Clelia Mosher,
who received her master's de
gree here during the middle of
that century. Several of the re
sponses werefrom the wives of
University professors who
were Mosher's patients.
Sanderson, whose research
centers around this amazing
body of data, says it is "infor
mation of a kind no one has
ever seen before." When he
heard about Degler's find he
"was at the archives when it
opened," he said. This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
"to test the validity" of our
image of Victorian sexuality,
Sanderson said.
Were 19th century women
really as prudish as modern
historical perspective would
have us believe? Sanderson's
data seems to say no. Women
responding to Mosher's ques
tionnaires speak far more can
didly about their sex lives than
one might expect, Sanderson
added.
Sanderson and Economics
Prof. Paul David, began inten
sive research on the fertility of
Victorian women in 1976,
based on "the enormously
rich" finds in the archives. The
two professors have also unco
vered "bits and pieces of med
ical records" from the Victo
rian era, Sanderson said. But
these haven't helped very
much because most of the re
cords consist only of physi
cians' diagrams of human
bodies.
Sanderson and David have
what they term "an historical
puzzle" to deal with. Over the
period from 1800 to 1920, the

total fertility rate of the Ameri
can population declined by a
surprising 58.7 percent. How
did they do it? If Victorian soci
ety was so repressed, how did
they even talk about fertility
control? Women living in the
1800s were largely ignorant of
ovulation patterns. They
thought of unsafe periods in a
woman's menstrual cycle in
primitive terms, "much like
animals in heat," said Sander
son.
Logic would seem to suggest
use of abortion rather than
pregnancy prevention, said
Sanderson. Yet, on the basis of
the 45 available question
naires, an unusual combina
tion of "what we would call
very bad, or by today's stan
dards, very ineffective, con

traception ind lowered coital
frequencies" resulted in a tre
mendously successful fertility
control, Sanderson said. Basi
cally, they used post-coital
douches of little or no spermic
idal value, even by 1930 stan
dards and practiced a kind of
half-hearted abstention. But
despite the hit-or-miss nature
of their methods, women cut
fertility rates by more than half.
Penile withdrawal as a means
of birth control was cited by
the interviewed women far less
frequently than we expected,
said Sanderson, probably be
cause 19th century medical and
marriage manuals emphatically
warned their readers of the
dangerous psychic consequ
ences that followed from such
practices.

Sanderson said the disco
vered documents are incredi
ble because they provide clues
into people's outlook during
the Victorian era. The inter
viewed women speak earnestly
about avoiding meat, liquor
and tobacco as it increases pas
sion. They talk about surviving
the earthquake of 1906. They
discuss the heartaches of being
descendants of the Salem,
Mass. witches.
Sanderson expects to spend
at least several more years
working on the project, al

though he says "this and teach
ing is enough for three lives."
He welcomes the aid of other
intellectual disciplines be
cause "economists are trained
to think only in terms of for
mal, mathematical ap
proaches" and he feels that
psychological analysis of the
data, for example, would add a
new dimension to his research.
One psychologist men
tioned to Sanderson the possi
bility of using the question
naires to study Victorian sexual
orientation. Homosexuality

often appears related to the
presence of a father figure dur
ing adolescence and the
Mosher documents supply that
information. "There is so much
here that we really can't
explore all the possibilities
alone," Sanderson said.
Sanderson is also consider
ing redistributing the 19th cen
tury questionnaire to current
female University students to
find attitude differences bet
ween 19th and 20th century
women.
