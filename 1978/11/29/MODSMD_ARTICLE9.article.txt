## Local military spending 
### 
Each year more than $350 billion is spent
throughout the world for military purposes, or
about $100 for every single person in the world.
You may be surprised to know that a large
amount of this money goes to military contrac
tors in the Santa Clara Valley and constitutes a
major part of the local economy.
The state of California and Santa Clara County
lead the nation in prime contract money from
the Department of Defense (DOD). Because of
the heavy dependence on these contracts, the
State Senate Select Committee on Investment
Priorities and Objectives will hold hearings on
the economic impact of federal military spend
ing on the California economy on November 29
and 30 in Los Angeles and San Jose respectively.
In fiscal year 1977, the DOD spent a total of
$16.2 billion in the state, an amount larger than
the entire state budget. Of this total, $10 billion
was awarded to corporate contractors. Los
Angeles County had the most military contracts,
representing a total of $4.7 billion. The Santa
Clara Valley (Santa Clara and San Mateo coun
ties) was next with nearly $2 billion, making this
area one of the most military-dependent per
capita in all of the United States. Over $1400 per
person comes into Santa Clara County each year
in prime military contracts, more than twice the
figure for Los Angeles County. Lockheed Mis
siles and Space Company in Sunnyvale received
nearly half of the valley total ($9lB million) for
its work building Poseidon and Trident nuclear
missiles, satellites, and advanced reconaissance
equipment.
The Santa Clara Valley is the electronics capi
tal of the United States, and half the work of this
growing industry is directly related to the milit
ary. The large firms, such as Lockheed, Ford
Aerospace, and Litton, integrate the electronic
systems while firms like Hewlett Packard, GTE
Sylvania, Textron Dalmo Victor, ITEK Applied
Technology, ESL (TRW), Varian Associates, Wat
kins Johnson, and Teledyne as well as hundreds
of smaller firms manufacture the semiconductor
components, tubes, and "devices" which are
essential for today's electronic warfare.
Other major area contractors include United
Technologies, Sunnyvale (missile propellant
and engines); Westinghouse, Sunnyvale (mis
sile propulsion systems); FMC, San Jose (tanks,
machine guns), SRI International (research),
and Stanford University (research).

California gets much more than its share of
military contracts. The record $10 billion in
prime contracts represents 21 percent of the
nationwide total of $47 billion. But California
receives less than its share of other federal ex
penditures. Of a grand total of federal spending
in California of $47.2 billion, 39.6 percent is
military related.
Amidst all of this military money, the Santa
Clara Valley is suffering from all the growing
pains that accompany sudden industrialization:
housing shortages, inadequate public transpor
tation, and pollution.
Because of high military expenditures, other
aspects of U.S. technology are slighted. Forty
percent of all U.S. scientists and engineers work
directly on military-related research and de
velopment.
Despite record-high military contract money,
military jobs in the state and in the valley have
been declining due to the increasingly capital
intensive nature of tne industry. For example,
Lockheed-Sunnyvale employed 31,500 people
in 1978 while receiving $552 million in military
contracts. In 1977, the number of jobs had de
clined to 16,000 while the contract monies total
led $918 million. The situation is similar
throughout the state. Military workers are in
creasingly vulnerable to the boom and bust na
ture of military industry. The layoff of Rockwell
workers after the cancellation of the B-1 Bomber
last year provides a clear example of this vul
nerability.
A cut-back in federal military spending could
hurt the economy of the Santa Clara Valley se
verely. It is important to plan for this con
tingency by establishing alternate use commit
tees which would analyze the job skills and
equipment involved military production and
find alternative products that could be manufac
tured.
After years of layoffs at Lucas Aerospace, Bri
tain's largest defense firm, the Shop Stewards of
13 unions developed a comprehensive alternate
use plan for shifting job skills and equipment to
manufacture of solar equipment, transportation
vehicles, and medical devices.
At the hearings in San Jose, many speakers
will urge that alternate use committees be estab
lished at the state, county and local levels.

the Department of Defense (DOD). Because of
the heavy dependence on these contracts, the
State Senate Select Committee on Investment
Priorities and Objectives will hold hearings on
the economic impact of federal military spend
ing on the California economy on November 29
and 30 in Los Angeles and San Jose respectively.
In fiscal year 1977, the DOD spent a total of
$16.2 billion in the state, an amount larger than
the entire state budget. Of this total, $10 billion
was awarded to corporate contractors. Los
Angeles County had the most military contracts,
representing a total of $4.7 billion. The Santa
Clara Valley (Santa Clara and San Mateo coun
ties) was next with nearly $2 billion, making this
area one of the most military-dependent per
capita in all of the United States. Over $1400 per
person comes into Santa Clara County each year
in prime military contracts, more than twice the
figure for Los Angeles County. Lockheed Mis
siles and Space Company in Sunnyvale received
nearly half of the valley total ($9lB million) for
its work building Poseidon and Trident nuclear
missiles, satellites, and advanced reconaissance
equipment.
The Santa Clara Valley is the electronics capi
tal of the United States, and half the work of this
growing industry is directly related to the milit
ary. The large firms, such as Lockheed, Ford
Aerospace, and Litton, integrate the electronic
systems while firms like Hewlett Packard, GTE
Sylvania, Textron Dalmo Victor, ITEK Applied
Technology, ESL (TRW), Varian Associates, Wat
kins Johnson, and Teledyne as well as hundreds
of smaller firms manufacture the semiconductor
components, tubes, and "devices" which are
essential for today's electronic warfare.
Other major area contractors include United
Technologies, Sunnyvale (missile propellant
and engines); Westinghouse, Sunnyvale (mis
sile propulsion systems); FMC, San Jose (tanks,
machine guns), SRI International (research),
and Stanford University (research).

California gets much more than its share of
military contracts. The record $10 billion in
prime contracts represents 21 percent of the
nationwide total of $47 billion. But California
receives less than its share of other federal ex
penditures. Of a grand total of federal spending
in California of $47.2 billion, 39.6 percent is
military related.
Amidst all of this military money, the Santa
Clara Valley is suffering from all the growing
pains that accompany sudden industrialization:
housing shortages, inadequate public transpor
tation, and pollution.
Because of high military expenditures, other
aspects of U.S. technology are slighted. Forty
percent of all U.S. scientists and engineers work
directly on military-related research and de
velopment.
Despite record-high military contract money,
military jobs in the state and in the valley have
been declining due to the increasingly capital
intensive nature of tne industry. For example,
Lockheed-Sunnyvale employed 31,500 people
in 1978 while receiving $552 million in military
contracts. In 1977, the number of jobs had de
clined to 16,000 while the contract monies total
led $918 million. The situation is similar
throughout the state. Military workers are in
creasingly vulnerable to the boom and bust na
ture of military industry. The layoff of Rockwell
workers after the cancellation of the B-1 Bomber
last year provides a clear example of this vul
nerability.
A cut-back in federal military spending could
hurt the economy of the Santa Clara Valley se
verely. It is important to plan for this con
tingency by establishing alternate use commit
tees which would analyze the job skills and
equipment involved military production and
find alternative products that could be manufac
tured.
After years of layoffs at Lucas Aerospace, Bri
tain's largest defense firm, the Shop Stewards of
13 unions developed a comprehensive alternate
use plan for shifting job skills and equipment to
manufacture of solar equipment, transportation
vehicles, and medical devices.
At the hearings in San Jose, many speakers
will urge that alternate use committees be estab
lished at the state, county and local levels.
(Randy Schutt graduated in 1977and lives in Palo
Alto.)
Each year more than $350 billion is spent
throughout the world for military purposes, or
about $100 for every single person in the world.
You may be surprised to know that a large
amount of this money goes to military contrac
tors in the Santa Clara Valley and constitutes a
major part of the local economy.
