Feature-length African Film j\ n
by Ousmane Sembene (Senegal) *
This graceful, funny, and unweighty satire is one of the most
important and mature products of the African cinema. A
self-satisfied, half-Westernized Senegalese businessman is
suddenly struck down by the xald, a curse rendering its victim
impotent. The hero's malady becomes a mirror for the impotence
of all young African nations over-dependent on white technology
and bureaucratic structures.
