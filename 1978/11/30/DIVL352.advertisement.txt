Correction
In Andy Moravcsik's re
view of the Guarneri String
Quartet (11/21), four lines
were inadvertently omit
ted. The passage should
have read: "Even the dark
anguished Mozart No. 15
and the harmonically dar
ing Haydn Op. 76 No. 6,
both late 17th Century
works, contain latent
Romanticism, and the Bar
tok Quartet No. 2 (1908)
harks back to a more lyri
cal century. Only the two
French encores — De
bussy and Ravel — al
tered the atmosphere.
"It was during the first
concert, Wednesday
night, that the Guarneri
had their finest hour. The
Schumann Quartet No. 3,
contrasting frantic virtuos
ity with hopeless depres
sion, was brilliantly
realized."
The Daily regrets the er
ror.
