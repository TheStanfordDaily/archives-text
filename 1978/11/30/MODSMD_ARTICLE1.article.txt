# Speakers at Iran forum blast shah
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
Three speakers decried the cur
rent political situation in Iran and cal
led for a quick end to the regime of
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in a
forum last night jointly sponsored by
the Stanford chapter of the Re
volutionary Communist Youth
Brigade (RCVB) and the Iranian Stu
dent Association (ISA).
"The current demonstrations
show the deep and burning hatred of
the shah's regime and of U.S. im
perialism in Iran," said Farhad Ehia, a
speaker from the ISA, which has its
local headquarters in San lose. "The
mass killings of demonstrators have
not stopped the struggle but inten
sified it," he added.
Also speaking at the forum, held in
Room 268 of the Quad, were Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center Prof.
Pierre Noyes, and a representative of
the RCYB, who requested that his
name be withheld.
Iran, because of its strategic posi
tion in the Middle East (it is just south
of the Soviet Union) and its richness
of natural resources, is considered
by many to be vital to the United
States, according to Ehia. It was for
precisely this reason, Ehia said, that
the United States engineered a
"bloody coup" through the CIA in
1953 to install the shah, because the
previous rulertried to nationalize the
western-owned oil fields.
"Iran was the stage where the U.S.
power play was launched. There was
a complete takeover of U.S. im
perialism in Iran, making the shah
the 'watchdog' of the Middle East
and the policeman to carry out
American policy," he told the audi
ence of about 20.
Last year, when the shah visited
President jimmy Carter in
Washington, the RCYB speaker said
that Carter told the shah, "We look
upon Iran's strength as an extension
of U.S. strength." He added that the
Pentagon has devised a Rapid Reac
tionary Strike Force (RSF) plan which
could send a contingency squad of
up to 100,000 American soldiers into
Iran on short notice.
Noyes, who spoke first at the
forum, told the audience that the un
fortunate possibility of military inter
vention in Iran is "an old story for
those of us who were against U.S.
involvement in Vietnam."
One of the major concerns of the
United States is obviously the possi
bility of a Soviet takeover should the
shah's government fall, he added.
There is no guarantee that the Soviet
Union would not try to "fill the vac
uum" despite Moscow's current de
nials that it will interfere with Iran,
the speaker said, "but if Iranians are
strong enough to sweep out U.S. im
perialism, they'll sweep out the
U.S.S.R. also. The future belongs to
the masses of people," he said.
Ehia said that reports in the Ameri
can press are "very misleading." Fie
