## Judiciary overstepping authority 
### 
The current controversy over
whether the California Supreme Court
improperly withheld an opinion be
cause of the election has over
shadowed an even more ominous activ
ity of the court — its increasing ten
dency to legislate rather than adjudicate.
The case at the center of the with
holding controversy is a vivid example.
According to press reports, the court
has decided to overturn the 1975 law
mandating a jail term for those who use
a weapon in the commission of a crime.
The decision is allegedly based on the
"improper" limitation of the discretion
of the judge.
If the press reports are indeed accu
rate, it will be a frightening portent of
things to come. The California Sup
reme Court will be telling us that judges
are beyond the control of our elected
representatives — that their discretion
may not be limited while they daily limit
the discretion of others. It will be judi
cial arrogance at its worst.
Unfortunately, this case is only one
more example of government by
judiciary. The California Supreme
Court has recently eviscerated grand
juries, changed the rule for legal insan
ity, and revolutionized local school
financing. Though all of these decisions
may embody the best policy judgments
(I tend to agree with all of them), they

are decisions for the legislature, not the
courts.
The phenomenon of a judiciary run
amok has been with us for a long time,
though it has not always been so preva
lent. Around the turn of the century
and up into the New Deal conservatives
relied on the irresponsible activism of
the courts to invalidate minimum wage,
maximum hour, and child labor laws.
Defeated in the proper areas of
policy-making — the legislative and
executive branches — conservatives
used the inflexibility of an appointed
judiciary to maintain their political in
fluence. This gross abuse of power was
eliminated after a change in the make
up of the U.S. Supreme Court in the
19305.
Chastened by their New Deal experi
ence, the federal courts have perma
nently abandoned their previous
economic adventurism. However, the
country is now awash in a torrent of
social interventionism. The courts,
though beginning slowly after the New
Deal, have simply gone berserk as so
cial activists.
Judges now regularly amend the
Constitution under the guise of inter
preting it. Decisions on administrative
procedures for welfare benefits, resi
encyf requirements for welfare and
vtotirrg. school busing and apportion

ment of state legislatures, have shred
ded the fabric of the legislative process.
Rights and laws are variously created
and destroyed by the application of
phantom constitutional principles.
The most obscene usurpation of
legislative power was the 1973 decision
in Roe v. Wade, which voided the abor
tion laws of every state in the country.
Seven members of the U.S. Supreme
Court — because of their personal sup
port for abortion — simply declared the
existence of a non-existent right, and
overturned the policy judgments of
every state legislature in the nation.
Thankfully, the court stepped back
from the brink of judicial absolutism
when it refused to require the govern
ment to finance abortion. Liberal
groups, defeated in the proper forums
of political activity, sought to impose
their will through the appointed elite.
Surprisingly, their effort failed — the
court wisely balked at the idea of forc
ing the public to pay for their attempts
at social engineering. The people still
have the right to spend and not spend
their own money as they see fit.
However, decisions on the mega
issues, such as abortion, welfare be
nefits and voting rights, are merely the
most visible elements of a judiciary on
the rampage, judges now run school
systems and prisons. They redesign

employment tests and job criteria; they
do land use planning. They evaluate
energy needs, rule on the use of IQ
tests, and regulate corporal punish
ment. judges joyously create chaos in
every possible area of human en
deavor, despite their complete and
utter ignorance in all of them.
The judiciary all too often blithely ig
nores reality by imposing huge de
mands on the other branches of gov
ernment, while wrecking delicately ba
lanced compromises among compet*-
ing interests. It then seeks to escape all
responsibility for its actions, with a
plaintive cry of "judicial indepen
dence."
It is time that we move away from
government by judiciary. The proper
forums for most policy decisions are
the legislative and executive branches
of government. Croups who have lost
their battle there should no longer run
to the appointed elite seeking satisfac
tion.
Judges are now exercising power
without its concomitant responsibility;
this misrule by nonelected vigilantes
hell-bent for social reform cannot be
squared with representative democ
racy.

However, decisions on the mega

The current controversy over
whether the California Supreme Court
improperly withheld an opinion be
cause of the election has over
shadowed an even more ominous activ
ity of the court — its increasing ten
dency to legislate rather than adjudicate.
The case at the center of the with
holding controversy is a vivid example.
According to press reports, the court
has decided to overturn the 1975 law
mandating a jail term for those who use
a weapon in the commission of a crime.
The decision is allegedly based on the
"improper" limitation of the discretion
of the judge.
If the press reports are indeed accu
rate, it will be a frightening portent of
things to come. The California Sup
reme Court will be telling us that judges
are beyond the control of our elected
representatives — that their discretion
may not be limited while they daily limit
the discretion of others. It will be judi
cial arrogance at its worst.
Unfortunately, this case is only one
more example of government by
judiciary. The California Supreme
Court has recently eviscerated grand
juries, changed the rule for legal insan
ity, and revolutionized local school
financing. Though all of these decisions
may embody the best policy judgments
(I tend to agree with all of them), they

are decisions for the legislature, not the
courts.
The phenomenon of a judiciary run
amok has been with us for a long time,
though it has not always been so preva
lent. Around the turn of the century
and up into the New Deal conservatives
relied on the irresponsible activism of
the courts to invalidate minimum wage,
maximum hour, and child labor laws.
Defeated in the proper areas of
policy-making — the legislative and
executive branches — conservatives
used the inflexibility of an appointed
judiciary to maintain their political in
fluence. This gross abuse of power was
eliminated after a change in the make
up of the U.S. Supreme Court in the
19305.
Chastened by their New Deal experi
ence, the federal courts have perma
nently abandoned their previous
economic adventurism. However, the
country is now awash in a torrent of
social interventionism. The courts,
though beginning slowly after the New
Deal, have simply gone berserk as so
cial activists.
Judges now regularly amend the
Constitution under the guise of inter
preting it. Decisions on administrative
procedures for welfare benefits, resi
encyf requirements for welfare and
vtotirrg. school busing and apportion

ment of state legislatures, have shred
ded the fabric of the legislative process.
Rights and laws are variously created
and destroyed by the application of
phantom constitutional principles.
The most obscene usurpation of
legislative power was the 1973 decision
in Roe v. Wade, which voided the abor
tion laws of every state in the country.
Seven members of the U.S. Supreme
Court — because of their personal sup
port for abortion — simply declared the
existence of a non-existent right, and
overturned the policy judgments of
every state legislature in the nation.
Thankfully, the court stepped back
from the brink of judicial absolutism
when it refused to require the govern
ment to finance abortion. Liberal
groups, defeated in the proper forums
of political activity, sought to impose
their will through the appointed elite.

court wisely balked at the idea of forc
