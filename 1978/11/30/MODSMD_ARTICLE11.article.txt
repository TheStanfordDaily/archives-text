Constructive
course evaluation
needed
As the end of the quarter
rolls around, students will be
asked once again to evaluate
the courses they are taking.
These evaluations are of grea
ter importance than usual this
quarter, and I call upon all stu
dents to give them your re
sponsible attention.
The Faculty Senate has ag
reed in principle to the idea of
universal course evaluation. A
plan for implementation is
being given a trial run this
quarter, and many curious
eyes are focused on the evalua
tion form that is being used in
most departments of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences this year. The form was
drawn up by the Faculty Senate
Sub-Committee on Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching
after many months of informa
tion and opinion gathering and
extended discussion about the
intent and use of course evalu-

ation. All schools and depart
ments have been asked to use
either this evaluation form or
their own form if they have
one.
There is a general feeling at
Stanford that student evalua
tion can be useful to instruc
tors, students and adminis
trators. But any form of evalua
tion can be only as good as the
effort and consideration put
into it by those who use it. If
the evaluators do a careful, re
sponsible job, the evaluation
process can be very helpful to
all concerned. And we, the
students, are the evaluators
upon whom that responsibility
rests.
As we sit in our classrooms
and anonymously face those
forms, we have the power to
make or break this particular
approach to evaluation and
improvement of teaching. If
our comments are childish,
cruel, derisive or petty, we
may destroy our chance to
keep this important concern
for good teaching as a perma
nent part of the educational

process.
It is time to lay aside our
frustrations. It is time to hold
back our stinging sarcasm. We
are being given the chance to
participate in a constructive
way in the on-going effort to
improve teaching. We should
be critical, but we must
criticize constructively and sar
casm has no place in construc
tive criticism.
The comments you make are
not destined only for theASSf
Course Guide; in many cases,
these forms will never reach
the Course Guide. But every
comment you make will reach
the instructor involved. And
they will read your comments.
If you are sarcastic, they will
feel the brunt of your sarcasm.
And they will respond defen
sively, just as you would re
spond defensively to a sarcas
tic evaluation of your perfor
mance. But if you are construc
tive, if there is kindness and
honest concern in your criti
cism, then they will respond in
kind, with honest concern.
Eitherway, yourcomments will
not go unheard, but if your
comments are helpful they will
be acted upon.
Be specific. "You were terri
ble" is no more help to an in
structor than a "D" at the bot
tom of an otherwise unmarked
paper you have written is of
any help to you. Point out
specific topics, methods, read
ings, etc. that were poorly
handled. Suggest ways of im
proving. And be specific about
good things, too. "You were
excellent" may make an in
structor feel good but will not
enlighten the instructor as to
what he or she did right.
Evaluate your instructors in
the same way that you would
like them to evaluate you on an
exam or paper. We appreciate
it when we get papers back
with many thoughtful com
ments on them; we, too,
should make extensive,
thoughtful comments. It is our
best chance to help improve
the teaching here.
So the next time you get the
urge to be sarcastic in your
evaluations, remember: a sen
sitive fellow human being will
read that comment about him
or herself. Then recall that if
your comments are not help
ful, instructors may decide not
to bother with evaluations. So
be constructive. Take a re
sponsible part in the effort to

improve teaching. Show that
you care.

A society of guns
Out of the horror and shock
which followed the an
nouncement of the shooting
deaths of Mayor Moscone and
Supervisor Milk arise some
grave questions about our
democracy. Though the deaths
may not have been the resultof
a political action, their con
sequences are very much polit
ical. The choices of hundreds
of thousands of voters for
mayor and supervisor have
been invalidated by the actions
of a single man with a gun.
How can our political system
really function as a democracy
when it is vulnerable to such a
man? He can actually exert
more influence than millions
of citizens voting in an elec
tion. Assassins have used their
capacity to kill to remove from
office, among others, presi
dents Lincoln, McKinley and
Kennedy. The American
people never had the oppor
tunity to vote for Robert Ken
nedy in 1968 orGeorge Wallace
in 1972. How many potential
candidates will never cam
paign because they fear the in
herent dangers involved? If
Edward Kennedy campaigns
for the presidency, one of his
real concerns will be to survive
the campaign.
The power to kill can also
disarm the guarantees of the
First Amendment. How much
will I daretosayin public when
it may result in bodily harm to
me? The tragedy of Martin
Luther King )r. points out that
even the highest ideals are not
sufficient to avoid this danger.
The problem is sufficiently
large to demand our attention,
but how much are we doing
about it? As Moscone said
prophetically, if someone
wanted to shoot him, a body
guard wouldn't stop that per
son. The Secret Service is not
enough, any real solution must
be broad and fundamental. But
what is it?
There is obviously no solu
tion, but perhaps gun control
can help. After the shootings of
Wallace and Sen. lohn Stennis
this issue was raised in Con
gress â€” the only place where
action broad enough can be
taken. But heavy lobbying by

the American Rifle Association
and other groups successfully
silenced all discussion, as soon
as the initial shock had worn
off. There will always be the as
sertions that "when guns are
controlled, only criminals will
have guns" and "guns don't
kill people, people kill
people." But more credence
must be given to the real suc
cess in Britain, where not even
policemen have guns and
deaths from shooting are al
most nil.
It may be truethat the United
States is not Britain and gun
control can never be perfect,
but it is the best solution we
have. How much longer can we
allow guns to delimit our polit
ical freedoms and take from us
the few leaders that we have?
How can we allow the taking of
a God-given human life?

Poorly thought-out
logic
Andrei Amalrik {Daily, Nov.
28) gives the impression that he
believes that Jews look only
after their own kind while over
looking the problems of those
non-Jews around them. I
would like to present two ideas
to him.
First, I agree with Amalrik
that Jews do indeed look after
their own kind. This has come
about through centuries of
Jews having no one else to turn
to except their fellow Jews. My
father escaped from Germany
and was rejected by half the na
tions in Europe before manag
ing to smuggle himself (with
the help of fellow Jews) into
Jewish Palestine. Had he de
pended on the help of non-
Jews he would be dead today.
Now, when he hears of a Soviet
Jew trying to find freedom, he
thinks of his past, and he tries
that much more to help.
Second, Amalrik states that
"if the Jews appeal for support
to many non-Jewish groups
. . . then others have a right to
count on their support." From
this I infer that Amalrik be
lieves that others have not
been able to count on Jewish
support for non-Jewish causes.
Throughout the ages, even
while under persecution
themselves, Jews have fought
for the freedoms of speech and
religion, for the rights of
blacks, women and other

minorities, and for the support
of the poor, aged and helpless.
Jews continue to maintain
and to support the ACLU even
when ACLU lawyers (them
selves Jewish) fight for the
rights of the Nazis. Indeed, it is
the Jews who are supporting
the Christians in Lebanon. And
in each of these cases, it is rare
for the Jew to ask what he will
get in return.
Many dissidents have impor
tant messages. Others do not. I
am afraid I must join with Time,
Newsweek and U.S. News and
World Report by rejecting
Amalrik's poorly thought-out
logic.

Trailers
not so bad
I have always been in
terested in students' attitudes
toward various aspects of cam
pus life. One such attitude
which I find quite often is
brought out in Lois Nesbitt's
opinion {Daily, Nov. 15): People
dislike the trailers.
It's a somber time when one
draws 4400, because it means
the trailers ("Oh, no not the
trailers!"). I "got stuck" in the
trailers last year because I had
three options: Stern, a frater
nity, or Manzanita Trailer Park.
I didn't want to live in Stern two
years in a row, and I neither
own a Rugby shirt nor drink
beer, so I "got stuck" in the

trailers. I admit that I wasn'ttoo
sure what it would be like, but
then I never went to look at a
trailer before the second draw.
Nesbitt says that she got tired
of explaining why she spends
$7000/ year to live in a mobile
home. Not true. She spends
approximately $900/ year to live
in a mobile home; the other
$6100 goes toward tuition,
food, books, etc.
I can't imagine living in a
cubicle such as in Stern or Wil
bur, where people are always
borrowing oil to make popcorn
and playing Frisbee in the hall
attwoa.m.Nesbitt's complaints
about the trailers can apply to
many campus residences (not
everyone can live in a two
room double in the Italian
House). She does hit home,
though, on one gripe: theants.
Many times I have opened the
cupboard, reached for the box
of doughnuts, and found the
ants had gotten there first. All in
all, the ants are a pain, but they
consume no more than a hun
gry neighbor in Stern who's
looking for the room that made
the popcorn.
Nesbitt says the best way to
survive in the trailers is not to
take them seriously. I would
say that the key is to take them
seriously and use what they
have to offer: privacy, but not
seclusion, and food when one
wants it.
