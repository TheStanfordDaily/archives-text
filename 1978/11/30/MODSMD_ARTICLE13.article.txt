# Staff response to Gaieties letter
## 
### 
Our review of Gaieties
owes no apologies. How
ever, in light of Gary Fur
long's criticisms, we offer a
brief clarification.
Contrary to his claim, we
do acknowledge the show's
enthusiasm: in fact, our
conclusion was that
"Gaieties fulfilled its goal of
eliciting spirit through en
tertainment."
Furthermore, these re
viewers saw the dress
rehearsal, and, without the
reaction of "over 4400
others" we could only judge
the energy of a hard
working yet rather tired
cast.
Furlong's letter to the
editor claims that "it is a fal

lacy to think for one minute
that any of the larger roles
carried the show." We
never wrote that this was
the case.
Finally, a review requires
covering all the aspects of a
production. Furlong's belief
that we concentrated too
much on the technical as
pects of the show and too
little on the fun of Gaieties is
contrary to a review's pur
poses.
An article focusing exclu
sively on the enthusiasm of
Gaieties would be a very
short, uninformative com
mentary on the obvious.
