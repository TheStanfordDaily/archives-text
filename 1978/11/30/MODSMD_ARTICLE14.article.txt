# Catcher in the Rye, others banned in Anaheim schools

Anaheim (AP) — When
school opened this fall, one of
Nancy Mitchell's tasks was to
pack away dozens of books she
had accumulated over the
years as supplemental reading
for her literature students.
The paperbacks, which had
been used in her 10th and 11th
grade English courses for close
to 10 years, suddenly were
banned from her classroom
because they were not on the
list of 270 books deemed ap
propriate for English classes in
the Anaheim Unified School
District.
Anaheim is one of a growing
number of communities in this
country to ban books from
classrooms. There were more
incidents of removing or cen
soring books in the last school
year than at any other time in at

least 25 years, according to
Judith Krug, director of the
American Library Association's
(ALA) Office for Intellectual
Freedom.
About 300 incidents were re
ported and among the books
considered inappropriate for
schools were The American
Heritage Dictionary because it
contained too many four-letter
words, The Catcher in the Rye,
Black Boy and the works of
Richard Brautigan, including
his well known Trout Fishing in
America.
The Anaheim case is unusual
because teachers are touted as
designers of the program,
which strives to return to the
basics of grammar, while in
most communities, banning
stems from parental com
plaints to the school board and

teachers aren't consulted.
But Anaheim teachers be
lieved they were merely pro
viding examples of appropriate
books and not creating a re
stricted list. The limitations
were imposed later by the
board, they claim. The
teachers feel they were duped
and that the new curriculum
was used by the board to dis
creetly accomplish what itfears
to do openly.
"I think theyarein fact trying
to delete all controversial
books from the list," said Dave
Barnes, former chairman of the
district's English department.
"If they did that overtly, it
would be very obvious and
would draw a lot more criti
cism. By going in the back
door, it makes them look more
legitimate.

"I think there was an attempt
to control the students' read
ing," agreed Mitchell.
"Most of the teachers who
participated in the revision of
the curriculum did not realize
those books not on the new
lists would not be available for
supplemental reading."
But James Bonnell, president
of the Anaheim Board of Edu
cation, said the teachers appa
rently misunderstood.
"The only effort to restrict
comes from the content of
basic grammar classes," he
said. "If they teach grammar
properly, they will have no

need for further books. Nor
will they have time for them."
Vet the teachers' "misun
derstanding" about whether
the list of books was all
inclusive was shared by board
member Jo Ann Barnett, who
voted for the new curriculum.
And Barnett also shares the
belief that the board majority
specifically meant to limit the
reading material available to
youngsters. She noted that two
of the five current board mem
bers also sat on the board that
openly tried to ban about 15
books from the district in 1971.

When confronted with com
munity pressure about that
banning, the board backed off.
Whatever the intent,
Anaheim has unquestionably
become part of a nationwide
grass roots movement toward a
simpler kind of education in
the classroom. In many com
munities, that effort is linked to
removal of certain books from
the schools.
There is, however, no un
iform objection to the mate
rials being censored out of the
nation's classrooms. Some are
considered inappropriate be

cause they contain obscene
language or reference to drugs
or premarital sex. In other
cases, the authors themselves
have come under fire — some
times for being homosexual,
sometimes Communist.
"Whattheydid in Anaheim is
a little broader than is com
mon," said Dorothy Massie of
the National Education Associ
ation. "But it's not at all un
common for school boards to
bow to community pressure to
take some books out of the lib
rary or make modifications in
the program.
