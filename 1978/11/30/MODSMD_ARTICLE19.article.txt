# Violence at city halls worries nation's municipal officials
## 
### 
St. Louis (AP) — The assassi
nations in San Francisco are
sparking worry among the na
tion's city officials that violence
may be spreading as a means of
settling routine political dis
putes.
"We all live with this every
day,"says one mayor. "I've
had meetings with Mafia types,
labor hoodlums and Black
Panthers. Vou always figure
that in a political meeting, the
weapons will be words.
"More and more, I'm afraid
the weapons will be weapons."
The mayor made the remark
in an offhand conversation to
colleagues, many stunned by
Monday's murders of Mayor

George Moscone and Super
visor Harvey Milk at San Fran
cisco City Hall. Others among
some 3300 officials here for the
annual meeting of the National
League of Cities publicly ex
pressed dread at realizing that
the murders seemed to stem
from a classic political confron
tation rather than from some
random lunacy.
'Inside' violence
Joel Wachs, a thoughtful city
councilman from Los Angeles,
reflected the feeling of many
officials, saying: "There's just
no way to deal with 'inside'
political violence. There's no
way to protect yourself from
your colleagues.

"This goes way beyond any
question of security," he said.
"We're talking about the basic
ways to settle a political dis
pute."
The Moscone and Milk mur
ders were at least the fourth
violent attack at a major city
hall in three years. The earlier
incidents — in 1976 in Newark,
Washington, D.C. and Balti
more — all grew out of day
to-day disputes in government
and politics.
Baltimore incident
It was noontime in April
1976, when Charles Hopkins
entered a temporary city hall in
Baltimore with guns blazing.
He shot two city council mem
bers, killing one. Witnesses
told police that Hopkins said
he was really after Mayor Wil
liam Schaefer.

The trigger to Hopkins' exp
losion: He was frustrated with
the bureaucratic runaround
about his application to open a
restaurant. Hopkins went to
trial and was found innocent by
reason of insanity.
In Washington, Mayor-elect
Marion Barry — then a city
councilman — was wounded
as a band of Hanafi Muslim
gunmen shot their way into the
office of the city council presi
dent. The incident was part of a
takeover of three buildings
stemming from the Hanafis'
grievances with the District of
Columbia Superior Court over
lenient sentences meted out in
a murder case and over a de
mand that American movie
owners stop showing a film
considered sacrilegious by
Hanafi leaders.

In Newark, City Councilman
Anthony Carrino and 50 con
stituents smashed through the
locked door of Mayor Kenneth
Gibson's office to confront
Gibson over his choice of an
out-of-towner for a top police
post. The intruders were not
armed.
Gibson, who was not actu
ally physically attacked, pres
sed charges of assault and
malicious damage against his
political foe, but an Essex
County grand jury declined to
bring an indictment.
What concerns city officials
meeting here is that all these
instances of violence seemed
to explode out of nowhere
from people involved in estab
lished governmental and polit
ical processes.
William Stafford, aide to

former Seattle Mayor Wes
Uhlman and now to Mayor
Charles Royer, says Uhlman
received any number of death
threats during his tenure but
never actually implemented
strict security precautions.
Police in Seattle announced
Tuesday that they were increas
ing security around Royer but
did not elaborate.
Stafford expressed a major
problem: "You can't frisk
every neighborhood activist
who meets with the mayor, let
alone every member of the city
council."
Vice Mayor Nicholas Car
bone of Hartford, Conn., visi
bly shaken by the San Fran
cisco murders, expressed fears
that "we're a society increas
ingly willing to settle our
scores with a bullet."

He suggested that local polit
ical systems are often so unre
sponsive that frustration
explodes into violence. This is
especially true, another city of
ficial noted, when dealing with
emotional issues such as abor
tion and gay rights that fre
quently crop up in city halls.
Mayor Tom Bradley of Los
Angeles, personally stunned
by the deaths of his San Fran
cisco political allies, said, "The
public is the real loser, not only
because of the loss of George
Moscone and Harvey Milk, but
because the system suffers
when people in public life are
faced with these sorts of at
tacks."
Bradley's posture, reasona
bly enough, was one of
helplessness. Moscone's
meeting with his alleged assail
ant was nothing more than one
of dozens of routine meetings
that every mayor conducts
daily.
Ex-supervisor
Moscone allegedly was kil
led during a late-morning con
ference with Dan White, who
had resigned as a supervisor
but then told Moscone he
wanted his job back. Before he
was shot, Moscone apparently
told White that he would ap
point someone else to the
post. White then allegedly shot
Milk before surrendering to
police.
Milk was a leader of San
Francisco's large gay commun
ity. White was a political foe of
both men.
