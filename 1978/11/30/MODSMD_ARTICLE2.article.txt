# Lack of influence on government policies noted in Lipset talk
## 
### SUSAN ESSOYAN 
Most Americans didn't vote in the
recent Congressional election be
cause they felt their votes would not
affect government policies, Hoover
Fellow Seymour Martin Lipset said at
a political science sherry hour yes
terday.
Because people see problems
such as inflation as unmanageable,
they don't bother to cast their votes,
Lipset said.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, however, was more optimis
tic. He blamed the low turnout — 30
percent of the electorate — less on
cynicism and alienation than on "an
indifference born of satisfaction."
Brody warned against "misreading
the mood of the American public."
The poor turnout this year was not
surprising, he said, because over the
last "16 years about 2 percent less of
the electorate has voted" in each
successive election.
Lack of "luster"
Both men agreed that the candi
dates and their campaigns "lacked
luster." "Nobody was passionate
about anything," which tended to
reduce popular involvement, Lipset
said.
The speakers also agreed that
political parties as organizations, are
falling apart, although Lipset seemed
to view this more negatively than
Brody.

Lipset said the decline of political
parties "brings more problems than
the evils it was intended to destroy.
Without parties, "issues are
politicized and partisanized," Lipset
explained.
Politicians running by themselves,
moreover, lack organization and a
"sense of balance," he added.
Brody said the decline of the polit
ical party has "produced some in
teresting effects." Candidates must
work through the media and distri
bute buttons and pamphlets to con
vince the public that they are worthy
of election. The success of these tac
tics, however, may have increased
voter apathy, Brody said.
Voters have "a sense that it doesn't
matter that much which candidate
wins because they both say they're
good," Brody said.
Fickle attitude
Lipset called this attitude fickle.
"The most significant thing about
this election is in the number of state
opinion polls that were way off, be
cause people changed their minds
before election day,"he said.
With the decline in voter participa
tion, Lipset said there has been more
involvement in single-issue politics.
"People relate to politics in terms
of issues that are of concern to them,
rather than the party, so the act of
voting becomes less important," he
said.
