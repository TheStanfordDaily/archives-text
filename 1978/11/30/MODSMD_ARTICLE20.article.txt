## Rock/jessica chereskin Heads: an immobile feast 
### 
Talking Heads, New York's highly touted
New Wave band, returned to San Francisco's
Boarding House on Thanksgiving evening and
delivered a powerful and impressive set.
David Byrne, lead singer, guitarist and wri
ter, fronted the four-piece band in his typi
cally idiosyncratic way. He performed like a
man crazed, straining to keep control. His tall
body was taut, his neck strained and the eyes
popped out of his close-cropped skull as he
sang about being perplexed by contemporary
American society. This ultimate modern man
is high-strungand paranoid, butalso witty and
insightful. To watch him sweat and hear him
shriek, chirp, grunt and wail on stage meant
seeing the '70s world through his nervous vis
ion.
Bare
Byrne's spare appearance typified Talking
Heads' entire show. The four members
sported lean frames, short haircuts and plan
street clothes (prep school casual). The stage
stood bare except for equipment and the di
rect white lighting never changed. So the au
dience focused on the music. The set in
cluded all of More Songs About Buildings and
Food, two favorites from their debut Talking
Heads: 77 album, "Psycho Killer" and"The
Book I Read," their first single "Love Comes
to Building on Fire," and one new song, "Elec
tricity." Byrne shared the guitar-playing
with )erry Harrison who also punched
keyboards and added occasional backing
vocals. Their jangling, staccato strumming
was complemented by Chris Frantz's strong
steady drumming and Tina Weymouth's insis
tent throbbing bass line. She looked pale and

worn on Thursday, but her feet never ceased
pummeling the floor as she stood rooted in
one spot, digging her head into her hunching
shoulders.
Searing
From the opening of "The Big Country" to
the last encore, Talking Heads proved tight,
sparkling and searing. Risking novelty, the
guitarists added country and western licks,
disco beats and power pop chords to their
inspired sound. The quartet's songs are com
plicated, but they reproduced the flawless
quality of their well-produced records while
inserting inventive improvisations. You
couldn't ask for more from a live perfor
mance. "Warning Sign," "The Big Country"
and "Thank You For Sending Me an Angel"
were especially magical.
Without addressing or hardly looking at the
audience, Byrne worked the crowd into a
frenzy. By the band's last number, "Psycho
Killer," people were dancing transfixed to the
hypnotic rhythms. A magnificent encore of Al
Green's "Take Me to the River" wasn't
enough, as the screaming fans recalled the
band once more for a climactic "The Good
Thing."
I too enjoyed the concert but wondered
why Talking Heads remained stoic and im
mobile, performing as though a brick wall
stood between them and the audience. We
might not even have been there, judging by
the group's expressions (or lack thereof).
Surely their act would retain all its excitement
and energy if they showed that they liked play
ing as much as we liked listening. How about
it fellows, give us a smile.

cluded all of More Songs About Buildings and
Food, two favorites from their debut Talking
Heads: 77 album, "Psycho Killer" and"The
Book I Read," their first single "Love Comes
to Building on Fire," and one new song, "Elec
tricity." Byrne shared the guitar-playing
with )erry Harrison who also punched
keyboards and added occasional backing
vocals. Their jangling, staccato strumming
was complemented by Chris Frantz's strong
steady drumming and Tina Weymouth's insis
tent throbbing bass line. She looked pale and

worn on Thursday, but her feet never ceased
pummeling the floor as she stood rooted in
one spot, digging her head into her hunching
shoulders.
Searing
From the opening of "The Big Country" to
the last encore, Talking Heads proved tight,
sparkling and searing. Risking novelty, the
guitarists added country and western licks,
disco beats and power pop chords to their
inspired sound. The quartet's songs are com
plicated, but they reproduced the flawless
quality of their well-produced records while
inserting inventive improvisations. You
couldn't ask for more from a live perfor
mance. "Warning Sign," "The Big Country"
and "Thank You For Sending Me an Angel"
were especially magical.
Without addressing or hardly looking at the
audience, Byrne worked the crowd into a
frenzy. By the band's last number, "Psycho
Killer," people were dancing transfixed to the
hypnotic rhythms. A magnificent encore of Al
Green's "Take Me to the River" wasn't
enough, as the screaming fans recalled the
band once more for a climactic "The Good
Thing."
I too enjoyed the concert but wondered
why Talking Heads remained stoic and im
mobile, performing as though a brick wall
stood between them and the audience. We
might not even have been there, judging by
the group's expressions (or lack thereof).
Surely their act would retain all its excitement
and energy if they showed that they liked play
ing as much as we liked listening. How about
it fellows, give us a smile.


The Talking Heads
Talking Heads, New York's highly touted
New Wave band, returned to San Francisco's
Boarding House on Thanksgiving evening and
delivered a powerful and impressive set.
David Byrne, lead singer, guitarist and wri
ter, fronted the four-piece band in his typi
cally idiosyncratic way. He performed like a
man crazed, straining to keep control. His tall
body was taut, his neck strained and the eyes
popped out of his close-cropped skull as he
sang about being perplexed by contemporary
American society. This ultimate modern man
is high-strungand paranoid, butalso witty and
insightful. To watch him sweat and hear him
shriek, chirp, grunt and wail on stage meant
seeing the '70s world through his nervous vis
ion.
Bare
Byrne's spare appearance typified Talking
Heads' entire show. The four members
sported lean frames, short haircuts and plan
street clothes (prep school casual). The stage
stood bare except for equipment and the di
rect white lighting never changed. So the au
dience focused on the music. The set in
cluded all of More Songs About Buildings and
Food, two favorites from their debut Talking
Heads: 77 album, "Psycho Killer" and"The
