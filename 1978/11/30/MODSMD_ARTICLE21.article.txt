Handel Vocal Music
Elly Ameling
Philllips Festivo
Fortunately Dutch soprano
Elly Ameling is no stranger to
the gramophone, though she
is heard more often in lieder
than in concert works. One
label now offers her in an
album of Christmas songs with
Dalton Baldwin; fine as that
may be, I dare say this mid
price reissue from Philips rep
resents better value, and it is at
least partly religious.
Handel called his "Silete
venti" a motet, though it could
just as well bfe thought of as a
cantata in Latin scored for sop
rano, oboe, strings and con
tinuo. The cantata "Crudel
tiranno Amor," though in Ita
lian and secular, is not dissimi
lar in style. Ameling sings both
here with tender simplicity,
and Raymond Leppard con
ducts the English Chamber Or
chestra from a harpsichord
which is fortunately audible.
For me the high point of this
release is the filler, Cleopatra's
aria "Piangero la sorte mia"
from Guilio Cesare. It is a mas
terpiece of Handel's operatic
writing; on record neither Be
verly Sills nor Joan Sutherland
can match the spirit with which
Ameling sings this, though
both are more "operatic" in
the modern sense.
There is a good cassette,
which is fortunate since Amel
ing's voice can be unkind to
the best of pickups and one
will want to play this recording
over and over again. Texts are
included but no English trans
lations.
Beethoven: Violin Concerto
New Philharmonic Orchestra,
Alceo Galliera, cond. Arthur
Grumiaux, violin,
Philips Festivo
Beethoven's violin concerto
is, as Schnabel said of the
piano sonatas, music better
than it can ever be played.
There is no shortage of record
ings — most violinists have re
corded the piece twice — yet
most of them fall short of
greatness in some way.
Not only is the solo part dif
ficult, but problems of balance
are paramount. The soloist
must make bold statements
but then reduce his volume to
that of the rank and file while
the woodwinds, for example,
take the melodic line. The
conductor must make the
first-movement orchestral tutti
loud and taut but then accom
pany the soloist with quiet ten
derness. In short, there must
be a complete partnership.
It would be fairer to credit
Arthur Grumiaux's 1966 re
cording, issued here on
Philips' new mid-price label,
for what it is than to carp about
what it is not. Not only is the
violinist's usually creamy tone
in evidence but there is also a
spirit of serenity here; the slow
movement is appropriately re
poseful and there is no grand
standing anywhere.
Philips offers this either on a
well-pressed disc or a good
quality cassette which both in
clude Beethoven's Romances

for violin and orchestra, mak
ing them a bargain at the price.
There is only a little orchestral
hardning of the arteries in the
sound.
Still, I can't help wishing that
they'd issued instead their 1975
recording — only available in
Europe — in which Haitink and
the Concertgebouw are joined
by their concertmaster Her
mann Krebbers. Krebers' solo
is meticulous, and the reading
brings out the symphonic
strength too more than any
other stereo recording. Only
Furtwaengler's mono record
ings with Menuhin and
Schneiderhan and Solti's with
Elman can offer better con
ducting in theirdifferent ways.
Piatigorsky plays Beethoven
Cello Sonata No. 2, Brahms
Cello Sonata No. 7
Piatigorsky
Seraphim
We have never had any shor
tage of great cellists on record,
but Piatigorsky was unique. He
was the Heifetz of the cello in
that his tone and vibrato were
distinctive: he took you by the
shoulders, shook you and said
cello the same way Primrose
could say viola, yet no one's
playing could be more suave.
In theory, then, this record
would be ideal: Piatigorsky
captured in his prime during
the '30s playing two cello mas
terpieces with the perfect ac
companist for each, Schnzbel
in Beethoven and Rubinstein in
Brahms. Unfortunately
Seraphim has castrated the
HMV originals with ruthless
treble filtering and Piatigors
ky's gorgeous overtones are
lost. The artistry is there in
spades, especially Schnabel's
contribution in the Beethoven,
but I cannot recommend this
record.
Schnabel can be heard ac
companying Fournier in all the
Beethoven sonatas on a better
Seraphim set, while happi : y
Piatigorsky recorded the
Brahms again for RCA shortly
before his death. He and
Rubinstein found some pas
sages a bit more of a scramble
then, including the final Al
legro in fugal style, but overall
it is a marvelous-sounding re
cording with the considerable
bonus of Brahms' second
sonata.
Brahms Piano Quartet No. 7,
Op. 25
Busch Quartet members with
Rudolf Serkin
Odyssey
It is a very great pleasure to
see the recordings of violinist
Adolf Busch trickling back into
the catalogue. There is a fam
ous 1906 photo of him turning
the pages for a piano quartet
performance at which )oachim
played first violin and
Dohnanyi the piano, yet Busch
did not become a master of
romantic music just by his as
sociation with its leading ex
ponents.
Not technically brilliant, he
nonetheless had a distinctive
alto tone and he was an inter
pretative master. "An artist
should not draw attention to

the beauty of his playing, but
only to the beauty of the music
being played,'' Busch said. Un
like certain present-day en
sembles which win favor by
safe, suave sound, Busch and
his quartet always took risks on
the composer's behalf.
Thus the Intermezzo and
Trio of Brahms' first piano
quartet have never sounded
more impassioned than here,
the final Rondo alia Zingarese
never more gypsy. If you de
mand perfect intonation at all
times and dislike slides, look
elsewhere, but Brahms lives
here. Serkin, Busch's son-in
law, brings great cooperation
to the all-important piano part.
At its price the Odyssey issue
is a good buy, but it has some
muddy bass and muffled highs
which are not the fault of the
original 1949 recording. A
German Electrola pressing, if
you can find it, does much bet
ter justice to the performance
and also offers the Busch re
cording of the second piano
quartet.
Mendgelssohn Viola Quintets
Op. 18 and 87
Jaime Lardeo, Ani Kavafina, vio
lins.
Heiichiro Ohyama, Kim
Kashkashian, violas.
Sharon Robinson, cello.
Columbia
In an age when the classical
record industry is engaged in
the umpteenth re-recordings
of so many works, the neglect
of other pieces is all the more
unaccountable. What, for
example, did the Mendelssohn
quintets ever do to have been
ignored for so long outside the
concert hall?
No one would claim that
they are on a par with Mozart's
supreme examples of the
genre, buttheyareas sparkling
as Mendelssohn's Octet; they
have only been represented in
Schwann, however, by a now
deleted Budapest Quartet per
formance of Op. 78 and a
wanly-recorded Vox Box
featuring the unnamed mem
bers of the Bamberg Quartet.
So the present release is par
ticularly welcome.
