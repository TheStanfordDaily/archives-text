## New Santana, Morrison: tragic flaws 
### 
Nobody ever accused Bill Graham of
being dumb. Opportunistic maybe, even
greedy, but not dumb. Graham, premier
San Francisco rock promoter, has been at
it a very long time, booking acts, and man
aging a select few.
Graham is obviously swinging with the
times; rock groups must survive commer
cially, especially with disco, jazz/rock fu
sion, and pure jazz competing fora similar
age group.
And survival means hits. Hits need radio
play, FM and AM crossover possibilities
becoming more important than ever.
Groups need a large and loyal (read: pay
ing) following before they can even dare
try anything unconventional.
Commercial need
The groups that Graham personally
manage are becoming a reflection of this
commercial need. Santana is a good case
in point. Devadip Carlos Santana ventured
into untested waters with Caravanserai,
a heavily jaza-influertced record several
years back, which alienated many original
fans. '.j'./I
Amigos and Festival saw Santana at
tempt to veer back to shorter record cuts,
with rock songs with a salsa touch.
Their newest effort, Inner Secrets, com
pletes the swing back. Gone are any traces
of extended songs. Short, hook
dominated songs prevail. Reworkings of
Buddy Holly's "Well Alright," )im Capal
di's "Dealer," and the old Classics IV tune,
"Stormy" are featured.
This is a very listenable album, geared
for lots of radio play, and lots of sales. The
songs are tight, and Greg Walker's vocals
have never sounded more soulful. And yet

something is amiss here.
Lacking is Carlos Santana's searing
guitar solos. When Carlos Santana
chooses to play his brand of rock and roll
guitar, his fire is unsurpassable.
Having caught Santana's act last year at
New York's Palladium, I can safely say that
time has not tarnished his ability to control
songs with his playing. He remains one of
rock's premier guitarists.
But where is it displayed on Inner Sec
rets? Nowhere, that's where. Santana, in
tensely religious about his music, allows
the rest of his band to dominate through
out.
There is nothing wrong with this motive.
There is also nothing wrong with making
good rock and roll in four-minute songs.
Nick Lowe is a good example of this.
Santana's soul
But Santana's soul is Carlos Santana's
guitar. When he explodes, the group ex
cels. His playing still evokes more feeling
than most of his contemporaries. Sacrific
ing this talent for any reason, robs the
group and cheats his audience.
Van Morrison, rock icon, Irish image
maker, long-time Bay Area resident, is a
recent Graham convert. His 1976 A Period
of Transition was produced by Mac Re
bennack (Dr. )ohn) while Morrison was
being managed by Harvey Goldsmith.
Transition was Morrison's first release in
two years, and saw him venture headlong
into the blues. The record ultimately dis
appointed many critics and fans and was a
commercial flop.
Now Morrison is under Graham's tutel
age. Wavelength the current release from
Morrison, is getting heavy airplay, sales

are brisk, and Morrison's recent tour was a
critical and financial success.
Images
The album showcases Morrison as one
of rock's true -stylists. His songs remain
filled with images that defy any easy expla
nation. Morrison in a recent Rolling Slone
interview with lonathan Cott, preferred to
avoid any explanation of his songs, trying
to let his music speak for itself.
"Natalia" and Kingdom Hall," two of
Wavelength's strongest rockers, show
Morrison in top form. His phrasing is still a
joy, and his gutteral growls are so strong,
they can almost frighten.
Yet for the longest time, classic Morri
son meant horn arrangements non-pareil.
But Wavelength finds Morrison eschewing
horns in favor of a synthesizer, which is
used tastefully at times, but too often de
generates into simple noodling.
Tragic flaw
Both Wavelength and Inner Secrets
seem headed for the top of the charts, and
seeing two of rock's finest still turning out
solid music is something one should be
grateful for.
Yet each record contains a tragic flaw
that prevents each from going beyond
simply good commercial music, into
something beyond that.
Both Devadip Carlos Santana's and Van
Morrison's past contain ample evidence
that each is capable of giving "that some
thing extra." One only hopes that the pre
sent commercial success wave each is rid
ing will allow them to go beyond what they
have achieved, and not remain tied down
by limits that are, at best, artificially im
posed.

that prevents each from going beyond
simply good commercial music, into
something beyond that.
Both Devadip Carlos Santana's and Van
Morrison's past contain ample evidence
that each is capable of giving "that some
thing extra." One only hopes that the pre
sent commercial success wave each is rid
ing will allow them to go beyond what they
have achieved, and not remain tied down
by limits that are, at best, artificially im
posed.
Nobody ever accused Bill Graham of
being dumb. Opportunistic maybe, even
greedy, but not dumb. Graham, premier
San Francisco rock promoter, has been at
it a very long time, booking acts, and man
aging a select few.
Graham is obviously swinging with the
times; rock groups must survive commer
cially, especially with disco, jazz/rock fu
sion, and pure jazz competing fora similar
age group.
And survival means hits. Hits need radio
play, FM and AM crossover possibilities
becoming more important than ever.
Groups need a large and loyal (read: pay
ing) following before they can even dare
try anything unconventional.
Commercial need
The groups that Graham personally
manage are becoming a reflection of this
commercial need. Santana is a good case
in point. Devadip Carlos Santana ventured
into untested waters with Caravanserai,
a heavily jaza-influertced record several
years back, which alienated many original
fans. '.j'./I
Amigos and Festival saw Santana at
tempt to veer back to shorter record cuts,
with rock songs with a salsa touch.
Their newest effort, Inner Secrets, com
pletes the swing back. Gone are any traces
of extended songs. Short, hook
dominated songs prevail. Reworkings of
Buddy Holly's "Well Alright," )im Capal
di's "Dealer," and the old Classics IV tune,
"Stormy" are featured.
This is a very listenable album, geared
for lots of radio play, and lots of sales. The
songs are tight, and Greg Walker's vocals
have never sounded more soulful. And yet

something is amiss here.
Lacking is Carlos Santana's searing
guitar solos. When Carlos Santana
chooses to play his brand of rock and roll
guitar, his fire is unsurpassable.
Having caught Santana's act last year at
New York's Palladium, I can safely say that
time has not tarnished his ability to control
songs with his playing. He remains one of
rock's premier guitarists.
But where is it displayed on Inner Sec
rets? Nowhere, that's where. Santana, in
tensely religious about his music, allows
the rest of his band to dominate through
out.
There is nothing wrong with this motive.
There is also nothing wrong with making
good rock and roll in four-minute songs.
Nick Lowe is a good example of this.
Santana's soul
But Santana's soul is Carlos Santana's
guitar. When he explodes, the group ex
cels. His playing still evokes more feeling
than most of his contemporaries. Sacrific
ing this talent for any reason, robs the
group and cheats his audience.
Van Morrison, rock icon, Irish image
maker, long-time Bay Area resident, is a
recent Graham convert. His 1976 A Period
of Transition was produced by Mac Re
bennack (Dr. )ohn) while Morrison was
being managed by Harvey Goldsmith.
Transition was Morrison's first release in
two years, and saw him venture headlong
into the blues. The record ultimately dis
appointed many critics and fans and was a
commercial flop.
Now Morrison is under Graham's tutel
age. Wavelength the current release from
Morrison, is getting heavy airplay, sales

are brisk, and Morrison's recent tour was a
critical and financial success.
Images
The album showcases Morrison as one
of rock's true -stylists. His songs remain
filled with images that defy any easy expla
nation. Morrison in a recent Rolling Slone
interview with lonathan Cott, preferred to
avoid any explanation of his songs, trying
to let his music speak for itself.
"Natalia" and Kingdom Hall," two of
Wavelength's strongest rockers, show
Morrison in top form. His phrasing is still a
joy, and his gutteral growls are so strong,
they can almost frighten.
Yet for the longest time, classic Morri
son meant horn arrangements non-pareil.
But Wavelength finds Morrison eschewing
horns in favor of a synthesizer, which is
used tastefully at times, but too often de
generates into simple noodling.
Tragic flaw
Both Wavelength and Inner Secrets
seem headed for the top of the charts, and
seeing two of rock's finest still turning out
solid music is something one should be
grateful for.
Yet each record contains a tragic flaw
that prevents each from going beyond
