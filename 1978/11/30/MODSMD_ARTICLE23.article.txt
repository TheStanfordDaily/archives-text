## A 						successful collaboration 
### 
Because of Stanford's large size, departments
here often seem to operate as autonomous un
its. The graduate students of the dance and
drama departments who are jointly presenting
An Evening in Early December should thus be
congratulated not only on an individual but also
on a combined basis.
Leslee Lewis, a masters candidate in dance,
with Polly Wilkinson, also a dancer, and John
Rathman, a doctoral candidate in drama, last
year independently generated the idea for a
joint performance. Michael Ramsaur of the
drama department brought them together ar
ranging for the use of the Little Theater where
the program will be produced this Friday and
Saturday at 8:30, and Sunday at 2:30.
Involving not only those already mentioned,
the program has grown to include other
graduate and undergraduate students. The
program's seven pieces vary not only in length,
under three minutes to over 20, but contrast
greatly in theme and content. All involve dan
cers, but because of Rathman's orientation to
ward a designer's theater where the set and
lighting make statements as well as the actors or
dancers, the pieces generally show integrated
efforts.
Street noises
The program opens with a solo by Lewis titled,
Pursuit, performed to the accompaniment of
street noises. The dance is a continual chase,
with the pursued just ahead of the pursuer
though the roles may reverse in an instant.
Whisper, the next piece choreographed by

Julienne Weston, is performed by herself and
Eugenia Haney, also masters candidates in
dance, and a recent masters recipient, Diane
Waller. This piece reflects current trends and
fads in its music by Devo and dance.
The dancers and actors of the next piece,
Euphoria, had just met each other in rehearsal
the night I saw the piece, but with some tighten
ing this piece could be simultaneously powerful
and light. Rathman put the "one-act" together
from sone of Samuel Beckett's prose works,
with excerpts from a radio play. Wilkinson and
Lewis' choreography at the beginning of the
work, provided an entry point for the main
character, who as in traditional vaudeville wan
ders in and then gets caught on stage.
Two duets
Lewis has choreographed two duets for the
program, one for herself and Waller, The Admi
ral and the Dancer, and the other for Haney and
Weston, Muck and Ice. The first piece is greatly
enhanced by the live harpsichord accompani
ment played by John Toenjes, also a student
here. Wilkinson has also choreographed a piece
for six performers, Memories of Persepolis.
The program as a whole provides a good basis
for future collaborations, my only criticism
being that it could have gone even further. Wal
ler's final solo, And the only place you are is
where you are not, performed to musical and
spoken accompaniment, possibly comes closest
to synthesizing the two mediums providing a
sharp, flashy ending to a good evening.

greatly in theme and content. All involve dan
cers, but because of Rathman's orientation to
ward a designer's theater where the set and
lighting make statements as well as the actors or
dancers, the pieces generally show integrated
efforts.
Street noises
The program opens with a solo by Lewis titled,
Pursuit, performed to the accompaniment of
street noises. The dance is a continual chase,
with the pursued just ahead of the pursuer
though the roles may reverse in an instant.
Whisper, the next piece choreographed by

Julienne Weston, is performed by herself and
Eugenia Haney, also masters candidates in
dance, and a recent masters recipient, Diane
Waller. This piece reflects current trends and
fads in its music by Devo and dance.
The dancers and actors of the next piece,
Euphoria, had just met each other in rehearsal
the night I saw the piece, but with some tighten
ing this piece could be simultaneously powerful
and light. Rathman put the "one-act" together
from sone of Samuel Beckett's prose works,
with excerpts from a radio play. Wilkinson and
Lewis' choreography at the beginning of the
work, provided an entry point for the main
character, who as in traditional vaudeville wan
ders in and then gets caught on stage.
Two duets
Lewis has choreographed two duets for the
program, one for herself and Waller, The Admi
ral and the Dancer, and the other for Haney and
Weston, Muck and Ice. The first piece is greatly
enhanced by the live harpsichord accompani
ment played by John Toenjes, also a student
here. Wilkinson has also choreographed a piece
for six performers, Memories of Persepolis.
The program as a whole provides a good basis
for future collaborations, my only criticism
being that it could have gone even further. Wal
ler's final solo, And the only place you are is
where you are not, performed to musical and
spoken accompaniment, possibly comes closest
to synthesizing the two mediums providing a
sharp, flashy ending to a good evening.

Because of Stanford's large size, departments
here often seem to operate as autonomous un
its. The graduate students of the dance and
drama departments who are jointly presenting
An Evening in Early December should thus be
congratulated not only on an individual but also
on a combined basis.
Leslee Lewis, a masters candidate in dance,
with Polly Wilkinson, also a dancer, and John
Rathman, a doctoral candidate in drama, last
year independently generated the idea for a
joint performance. Michael Ramsaur of the
drama department brought them together ar
ranging for the use of the Little Theater where
the program will be produced this Friday and
Saturday at 8:30, and Sunday at 2:30.
Involving not only those already mentioned,
the program has grown to include other
graduate and undergraduate students. The
program's seven pieces vary not only in length,
under three minutes to over 20, but contrast
greatly in theme and content. All involve dan
