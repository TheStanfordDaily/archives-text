### 
"The Disc Collectors" — a
celebration of 20 years of col
lecting and preserving sound
recordings for the Stanford
Archive of Recorded Sound by
its founders William Moran
and Ed Colby — will be pre
sented by the Department of
MusicatB p.m. Sunday, Dec. 3,
in Annenberg Auditorium.
There will he no admission
charge.
Moran and Colby will share
the Dec. 3 program, and each
will illustrate his talk with taped
excerpts of historic recordings
from the Archive.
Collection
Twenty years ago William R.
Moran, a geologist with Union
Oil and a Stanford alumnus,
persuaded the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries of the impor
tance of preserving sound re
cordings. Together with
former music librarian Colby,
he began and helped to build
the collection which has be
come the Stanford Archive of
Recorded Sound, now rated
among the' six major sound
archives in North America and
the only one west of Syracuse,
New York.
A serious private collector of
recordings since the age of
eight, fv\cjran will talk on what

is actually involved in the col
lection of sound recordings:
on acquisition, historic and
discographic research, and
preservation. He will also ex
pand upon the value and im
portance of preserving
sounds, speech and music
from the past.
Instantaneous documents
"Recordings are instantane
ous documents, although
people didn't realize this for
many years," says Moran.
"They can recall events, situa
tions, conjure up atmosphere.
What people listened to, the
sounds and speech, they heard
around them, are as much a
part of real history as the physi
cal artifacts left to us," he adds.
"They are the aural equivalent
of motion pictures."
An unpublished recording of
a speech by Stanford's first
president David Starr Jordan,
on "The Spirit of Stanford,"
will open Moran's talk. Re
corded in 1916'0n Jordan's re
tirement, it commemorates the
25th anniversary of the open
ing of the University. The re
cording was recovered by
Moran from Jordan's widow,
and became the first item in the
Archive.

Other treasures Moran has
chosen from the collection in
clude a previously unpub
lished was cylinder recording
made in 1900 with Marcella
Sembrich singing "Voci di
Primavera" ("Voices of
Spring") by Johann Strauss, Jr.
A privately recorded 10-inch
disc of 1917 made by Enrico
Caruso singing the tenor solo
from the quartet in Rigoletto,
and an equally unique pressing
made in Australia in 1916 of
Nellie Melba performing
Dvorak's "Songs My Mother
Taught Me," will also be aired.
(These have been copied and
recorded on discs by the arc
hive and are available for sale.)
From its beginnings the Arc
hive has been used in a variety
of interesting ways, and Colby
will explore some of these,
with recorded examples, dur
ing his part of the program.
Variety
Colby has been asked to
supply music to induce tr
ances; "guillotine music" for a
history presentation on the
French Revolution; recordings
of Sarah Bernhardt reciting
speeches from "Phaedra" and
"L'Aiglon" for drama classes; a
record of Caruso singing
"Over There" for a film

documentary on World War I.
(The Archive also contains
speeches by Hitler and
Woodrow Wilson, and mus
ical relics such as a version
of Mussolini's marching song
"Giovinezza" sung by famous
Italian tenor Beniamino Gigli.)
The Archive is rich in re
sources for students research
ing 19th and 20th century per
formance practice in voice, in
strumental music, conducting,
and even dance. Colby will
play excerpts from a rare re
cording of composer Pietro
Mascagni conducting in its en
tirety his own opera "Caval
leria Rusticana," which offers a
unique insight into the com
poser's intended interpreta
tion of the work.
One doctoral student has
used the Archive for compara
tive studies of the performance
ofa single Chopin Nocturneby
over 30 different pianists;
another to reconstruct early
black American dances like the
Cakewalk.
The Dec. 3 program will pay
tribute not only to the inven
tion of the phonograph but
also to the still-growing legacy
of sound left to Stanford by two
far-sighted — and far-hearing
— men: Colby and Moran.
