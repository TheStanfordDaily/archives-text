The case of the missing plate
Apparently the brass insert in the plate covering the 1978 senior class time
capsule in the Quad has been slowly cracking for some time. According to
the Office of Public Affairs, the sunken plate had become a hazard for
pedestrians and bicyclists. So last week it was removed for repair, and the
time capsule safety stored in the public affairs office.
