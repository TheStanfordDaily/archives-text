Quake rocks southern Mexico
Mexico City — Six strong earthquakes and
aftershocks jolted the capital and much of
southern Mexico yesterday, causing property
damage, injuries and panic from the Atlantic to
the Pacific. But officials said there were no
confirmed reports of deaths.
Officials said possibly 600 persons were
treated for injuries orshock, and some Mexico
City newspapers and radio stations said as
many as seven persons died in Oaxaca state,
300 miles south of Mexico City.
The quakes shattered windows, shook
buildings and sent thousands of office workers
fleeing into the streets.
In a downtown Mexico City hotel "the bed
started moving and a large opening came bet
ween the walls," said Yvonne Nestro of Pue
blo, Colo. "The new and old parts of the build
ing came apart about a foot and a half. I
jumped over the opening to get to the stairs.'
Federal inspectors said some buildings were
seriously damaged but that none were de
stroyed. The inspectors said some buildings
twisted on their foundations, but did not cave
in.
The tremors — measured as high as 7.9 on
the Richter scale — rolled through this city o!
13 million beginning at 11:53 a.m. Ihe first
tremor was followed in 12 minutes by a shorter
quake and about an hour later by another
strong tremor that swayed tall buildings on
Paseo de la Reforma Boulevard. The ground
continued to roll sporadically in a soft, roc king
motion into the early evening hours.
Cornices and masonry fell from many build
ings. Some balconies hung crazily. The subway
system stopped temporarily but was back in
service soon after the tremors stopped.
In Mexico City, hospital emergency rooms
reported more than 106 injuries. A nurse at one
huge medical complex said, "We have 11
people in the emergency room and they are
still coming in."
Fire department officials said at least four
fires were caused by the earthquake. 1 Revi
sion and radio stations warned about fallen
high power electrical wires.
Ambulance sirens whined through the
center of town, but electric ity and other essen
tial services appeared to be functioning nor
mally.
Guyana survivors fly home
New York — Seven elderly, penniless mem
bers of the depleted People s Temple cult, said
to be "scared" and "not feeling well," re
turned to the United States trom Guyana yes
terday.
After being questioned for 90 minutes by
government officials aboard the Pan American
World Airways jet that brought them back, the

survivors — three in wheelchairs, the others
walking — headed for an airport bus and con
necting flights to California.
Meanwhile, a pathologist who viewed the
carnage at the People's Temple compound in
jonestown, Guyana, said yesterday that re
hearsals for the mass murder-suicide may have
included the use of knock-out drops to simu
late death.
Dr. Lynn Crook, a clinical pathologist at the
Medical University of South Carolina at Char
leston, said he found six to eight empty one
gallon bottles of elixir of chloral hydrate a
mixture known popularly as a Mickey Finn.
They were near the vat containing the potas
sium cyanide that caused the deaths of more
than 900 members of the Rev. Jim |ones ag
ricultural community in Guyana.
In Washington, justice Department officials
have changed their minds and now plan to
seek autopsies on the bodies of the Rev. Jim
Jones, the deceased People's Temple leader;
two of his close aides and four randomly
selected victims of the mass deaths at the cult s
Guyana settlement.
Trade deficit grows rapidly
Washington — A sharp decline in exports of
food, chemicals and gold pushed the nation's
trade deficit to $2.1 billion in October, the
worst in three months, the government said
yesterday.
The U.S. trade deficit, which now totals
$24.8 billion for the first 10 months of 1978, has
been a major cause along with inflation of the
steep decline in the dollar during the past two
years.
Officials estimate there already are about
$500 billion in U.S. dollars held abroad, most
of them trom past trade deficits. As the supply
ol dollars outpaces foreign demand, which it
has, the value declines.
Chairman G. William Miller of the Federal
Reserve Board said yesterday the decline in the
dollar has added about 1 percent to the na
tion's inflation rate in 1978, and will raise it
even more in 1979.
The dollar decline alone, he said, is costing
Americans between $10 billion and $15 billion
a year in lost purchasing power.
It seemed certain the trade gap for the year
will surpass last year's record $26.5 billion de
ficit. However, the administration expects the
trade deficit to dec line substantially next year,
perhaps by half, as other countries increase
their imports of U.S. goods.
Protesters to greet Nixon
London — Former President Richard Nixon
told reporters yesterday he is not worried and
will feel "very much at home" if students de
monstrate during his speaking engagement at

the Oxford Union debating society.
Nixon, who resigned in 1974 as a result of the
Watergate scandal, arrived at Heathrow Air
port from Paris, where he appeared on a televi
sion show and answered viewers' questions.
American students at Oxford said they plan
ned to demonstrate against Nixon. They
code-named their operation "CREEP'' — the
acronym of Nixon's 1972 Committee to Reelect
the President, which was involved in the
Watergate burglary.
Undergraduate student president Charles
Parsons said at least 1000 demonstrators would
protest Nixon's lecture today because they
"remember very well the excesses of the
Nixon administration and are opposed to this
visit."
Britain's Labor government arranged
maximum security and minimum courtesies
for the arrival of Nixon, on his first visit to
Europe since leaving the White House.
An aide to Prime Minister James Callaghan
told a reporter, "The prime minister has no
plarls to see Mr. Nixon.'
An attempt to stop the Nixon visit failed last
week when Home Secretary Merlyn Rees re
jected a call by Labor lawmaker John Lee for a
ban on Nixon as an undesirable alien.
Smoking standards ordered
New York — Health, Education and Welfare
Secretary Joseph Califano |r. ordered new fed
eral safety standards yesterday for industries in
which smoking increases a worker's chance
of disease.
The new standards would tighten safety re
strictions on some companies unless they re
quire workers in certain jobs not to smoke at
work.
Cigarette smoke is thought to increase the
risk of certain diseases — particularly cancer —
when workers are already exposed to a
hazardous substance on the job.
Califano said the risk of cancer or other dis
eases rose for smokers who were exposed to
talc in the rubbery industry, to decay products
of the element radon in uranium mining and to
fluorocarbons in the plastics industry.
He said those three industries would be the
initial targets of the standards.
FTC okays MD advertising
Washington — The American Medical As
sociation, by prohibiting doctors trom adver
tising, has fostered an illegal price-fixing con
spiracy that has inflated medical bills, an ad
ministrative law judge ruled yesterday.
Federal Trade Commission ludge Ernest
Barnes ordered the 200,000-member AMA, the
largest professional association in the world,
to rescind its rules that keep physicians from
advertising or otherwise soliciting patients.

The AMA said in a statement it will appeal the
order.
Robert Hunter, chairman ot the AMA board
of trustees, said, "We don't feel that lawyers,
dentists, engineers and other professionals,
labor unions, business entities, charitable or
ganizations, state and local governmental enti
tles should have to ask the federal government
if they can issue ethical guidelines to their
members and what those guidelines should
say."
The decision comes after a pivotal ruling last
year by the Supreme Court, striking down the
American Bar Association's restriction on ad
vertising, which was similar to the AMA's.
Reagan: Jones attracted Demos
Bonn, West Germany — Former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday that the
Rev. |im |ones, cult leader of People's Temple,
appeared to attract more members of the
Democratic Party than Republicans.
"I'll try not to be happy in saying this,"
Reagan said. "He supported a number of polit
ical figures but seemed to be more involved
with the Democratic Party. I haven't seen any
one in the Republican Party having been
helped by him or seeking his help."
Reagan, who lost the 1976 race for the Re
publican presidential nomination to Gerald
Ford, is currently on a tour of European capi
tals.
Reagan said he will spend three days in West
Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt in West Berlin and Bavarian conserva
tive leader Franz Josef Strauss in Munich.
When asked it his trip was in preparation for
presidential campaigning, Reagan answered,
"You'll have to ask me that question sometime
in 1979."
