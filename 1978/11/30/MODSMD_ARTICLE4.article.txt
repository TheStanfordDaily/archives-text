# White admits murders, published report states
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Former
Supervisor Dan White has confessed
to the murders of the mayor and
another city official, according to a
report in today's editions of the San
Francisco Chronicle.
The Chronicle did not say when
the purported confession to police
was made and police officials had no
comment on the newspaper report.
According to the article, police
also believe the gunman killed both
Mayor George Moscone and Super
visor Harvey Milk Monday by shoot
ing them twice each in the back of
the head as they lay wounded on the
floors of their City Hall offices.
Unnamed sources close to the in
vestigation were quoted in the paper
as saying that powder burns and the
almost adjacent head wounds in
each victim showed the shots were
fired at extremely close range.
White, who would face a mandat
ory death penalty if convicted under
a special statute covering the murder
of public officials, appeared in court
briefly yesterday. His arraignment
was postponed one week to allow
him time to get an attorney.
Dressed in a bright orange prison
jumpsuit, White bit his lip as he was
led into court by two bailiffs and did

not speak during the three-minute
hearing.
White's temporary attorney, Gil
bert Eisenberg, did not seek bail for
White. He requested the con
tinuance in White's behalf.
"The family needs time. He needs
time," Eisenberg told a crush of re
porters and cameramen outside the
courtroom. He refused to comment
on White's emotional state.
Meanwhile, mourning San Fran
ciscans made thierway toCity Hall by
the thousands yesterday, paying last
respects to murdered Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey
Milk and hearing the acting mayor
call for the city's "emotional recon
struction."
Acting Mayor Dianne Feinstein
said, "In the wake of the tragedies in
Guyana, this additional senseless
monstrosity seems simply unreal.
"In our sorrow, this lovely jewel of
a city seems a dark and saddened
place."
Police estimated at least 15,000
people would file through the gold
and-marble City Hall rotunda to pay
their last respects to Moscone and
Milk.
Moscone will be buried today and
Milk is to be cremated tomorrow

night.
The mayor and Milk were gunned
down in their offices minutes before
Moscone was to go before television
cameras and announce White's re
placement. Witnesses told of hear
ing gunshots, and seeing White run
ning through the corridors of City
Hall.
White surrendered to police at
Northern Station Monday about 35
minutes after Moscone and Milk
were shot to death and turned over a
.38 caliber revolve which police now
say has been matched with bullets
recovered from the slain bodies.
The suspect was brought quickly
to the Hall of justice where Falzon
and Homicide Inspector Ed Erdelatz
questioned him for half an hour.
Shortly after that, Attorney lames
Purcell arrived and was closeted with
White for another 30 minutes.
After that, White's wife, Mary Ann,
and Purcell talked with the suspect
foranother4s minutes before Purcell
finally emerged and told reporters,
"I regret I was not present" during
White's interrogation by detectives.
Coroner Boyd Stephens, who per
sonally examined the bodies at City
Hall after the murders Monday and
later performed autopsies on the
slain leaders, said that in both cases
the victi ms were "alive at the time the
head wounds were administered."
But he would not say if the head
wounds came from the last bullets to
be fired in each of the murders.
Moscone, 49, was shot four times
and Milk, 48, was shot five times, in
dicating the assassin had to reload
the .38 caliber revolver between the
two offices — a distance of about 100
steps.
The Chronicle said police believe
both victims were standing at the
time they were first shot, and that
each crumbled wounded to the
floor.
Then, the newspaper said, it is be
lieved the killer leaned over the vic
tims and fired the final two shots.
Proof that Moscone and Milk were
slain in this calculated manner would
be crucial to a prosecution attempt to
show the acts were deliberate and
premeditated.
In court, judge Reynolds set
White's hearing for Dec. 6 and said
he should be prepared to enter a plea
at that time. A preliminary hearing
would then be scheduled.

White's temporary attorney, Gil
bert Eisenberg, did not seek bail for
White. He requested the con
tinuance in White's behalf.
"The family needs time. He needs
time," Eisenberg told a crush of re
porters and cameramen outside the
courtroom. He refused to comment
on White's emotional state.
Meanwhile, mourning San Fran
ciscans made thierway toCity Hall by
the thousands yesterday, paying last
respects to murdered Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey
Milk and hearing the acting mayor
call for the city's "emotional recon
struction."
Acting Mayor Dianne Feinstein
said, "In the wake of the tragedies in
Guyana, this additional senseless
monstrosity seems simply unreal.
"In our sorrow, this lovely jewel of
a city seems a dark and saddened
place."
Police estimated at least 15,000
people would file through the gold
and-marble City Hall rotunda to pay
their last respects to Moscone and
Milk.
Moscone will be buried today and
Milk is to be cremated tomorrow

night.
The mayor and Milk were gunned
down in their offices minutes before
Moscone was to go before television
cameras and announce White's re
placement. Witnesses told of hear
ing gunshots, and seeing White run
ning through the corridors of City
Hall.
White surrendered to police at
Northern Station Monday about 35
minutes after Moscone and Milk
were shot to death and turned over a
.38 caliber revolve which police now
say has been matched with bullets
recovered from the slain bodies.
The suspect was brought quickly
to the Hall of justice where Falzon
and Homicide Inspector Ed Erdelatz
questioned him for half an hour.
Shortly after that, Attorney lames
Purcell arrived and was closeted with
White for another 30 minutes.
After that, White's wife, Mary Ann,
and Purcell talked with the suspect
foranother4s minutes before Purcell
finally emerged and told reporters,
"I regret I was not present" during
White's interrogation by detectives.
Coroner Boyd Stephens, who per
sonally examined the bodies at City
Hall after the murders Monday and
later performed autopsies on the
slain leaders, said that in both cases
the victi ms were "alive at the time the
head wounds were administered."
But he would not say if the head
wounds came from the last bullets to
be fired in each of the murders.
Moscone, 49, was shot four times
and Milk, 48, was shot five times, in
dicating the assassin had to reload
the .38 caliber revolver between the
two offices — a distance of about 100
steps.
The Chronicle said police believe
both victims were standing at the
time they were first shot, and that
each crumbled wounded to the
floor.
Then, the newspaper said, it is be
lieved the killer leaned over the vic
tims and fired the final two shots.
Proof that Moscone and Milk were
slain in this calculated manner would
be crucial to a prosecution attempt to
show the acts were deliberate and
premeditated.
In court, judge Reynolds set
White's hearing for Dec. 6 and said
he should be prepared to enter a plea
at that time. A preliminary hearing
would then be scheduled.
San Francisco (AP) — Former
Supervisor Dan White has confessed
to the murders of the mayor and
another city official, according to a
report in today's editions of the San
Francisco Chronicle.
The Chronicle did not say when
the purported confession to police
was made and police officials had no
comment on the newspaper report.
According to the article, police
also believe the gunman killed both
Mayor George Moscone and Super
visor Harvey Milk Monday by shoot
ing them twice each in the back of
the head as they lay wounded on the
floors of their City Hall offices.
Unnamed sources close to the in
vestigation were quoted in the paper
as saying that powder burns and the
almost adjacent head wounds in
each victim showed the shots were
fired at extremely close range.
White, who would face a mandat
ory death penalty if convicted under
a special statute covering the murder
of public officials, appeared in court
briefly yesterday. His arraignment
was postponed one week to allow
him time to get an attorney.
Dressed in a bright orange prison
jumpsuit, White bit his lip as he was
led into court by two bailiffs and did

not speak during the three-minute
hearing.
