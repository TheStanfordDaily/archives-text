# Students called 'pessimists'
## Med School debates thesis requirement 
### ANDREA JAMES Senior staff writer 
Students speaking out against a re
cent committee report which
suggests that med students here be
required to write a thesis before re
ceiving their degrees were deemed
"pessimists" last night by one of the
authors of that report.
Dr. Robert Chase, chairman of the
committee on curriculum evaluation
for the Med School, met with about
75 medical students to discuss the
thesis requirement. No students
spoke in favor of the proposal.
A major student concern raised at
the meeting was that the paid lab as
sistant positions which some facuity
members now award to students will
disappear if all students are required
to work in labs and clinics to com
plete the thesis requirement.
"If the faculty knew students had
to do the lab work to meet a re
quirement, they would not pay,"one
student said, "It would be like paying
them to sit in class."
"What a group of pessimists!"
Chase retorted. He did not comment
further.
Global payment
According to the committee re
port, the thesis requirement would
be countered by a global tuition
payment which would be identical
forstudents staying in school for four
to six years.

He added that a recommendation
by recently resigned Dean Clayton
Rich, which mandates that students
pay tuition a minimum of 13 quarters,
was made independently of the so
called Chase committee report.
"It's an inevitable occurrence that
tuition is going to rise," Chase
explained. "But the two recommen
dations were not connected what
soever.
The global tuition requirement
would provide students with an extra
two years to obtain "investigative
experience in some aspects of
medicine," according to Chase.
Extra research
"We based our report on the feed
back we have received from students
who graduated after five years and
used the extra year for research and
from students who have done re
quired theses at Yale," Chase said.
"The committee concluded that an
individual who has been in such a

project will be a better physician."
He added that the thesis require
ment will help all students become
"innovators, pioneers, scientists,
scholars and teachers."
Chase said the report was also re
sponding to faculty who were "disil
lusioned with the increasing number
of students wanting to rush and push
arid pet through med school in four
years."
"Only 35 to 40 percent of our med
ical students stay the full five years,"
Chase said. "This is the lowest per
centage of any school I know of in
the country."
He said the four-year curriculum
does not permit students to have the
research opportunities which he said
they should receive in med school.
Five-year curriculum
But he emphasized that the report
does not suggest a mandatory five
year curriculum.
"I know there's some students

here who will do the thesis in four
years along with the four-year cur
riculum," he said.
Chase said the suggested policy
would affect both faculty and stu
dents because "faculty will be obli
gated to accept students in their labs
and clinics and serve as preceptors."
But some students questioned the
importance of the research they
would be doing and described tome
research opportunities as "trivial."
Chase replied that of the theses
required of Yale students, only 10 to
15 percent of those turned in each
year are considered "trivial" by a
panel of professors.
Chase also said that thesis research
could be done in the individual's
specific field of interest and did not
have to be limited to laboratory
work.
"You're looking at research in the
narrowest definition of the word,"
he told the students.
