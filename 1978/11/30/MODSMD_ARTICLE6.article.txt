## 'Folksy style' distinguishes Hastorf 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Psychology Prof. Albert Hastorf
moves not unlike a wind-up toy.
He walks, he talks, he tells jokes,
and he gestures when he teaches.
The 58-year-old man strides en
thusiastically across the stage,
keeping his audience's attention
riveted on his ever-changing posi
tion.
In the privacy of his office, too,
he jumps up from his seat, and
walks back and forth in rhythm
with the conversation. He sits at
his desk, then suddenly propels
his chair backward, puts his feet

up on the couch, and continues
his discourse without interrup
tion. He often springs up to use
the blackboard in his office to il
lustrate a point.
Hastorf explains his hyperactiv
ity, "by acknowledging that it is
probably rooted "in some anxi
ety" he has. This may be the same
anxiety that makes him chew on
pencils and styrofoam cups. Hon
esty about himself is part of his
no-nonsense manner, or what
Sociology Prof. Sandy Dornbusch
called his "folksy style." Because
of it, people do not find him
threatening, Dornbusch said.

Assistant Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Sydney Burkhart,
who worked with Hastorf both in
the dean's office and in the
Psychology Department, re
marked on his "gentlemanly ap
proach...a cerain formality."
Handicapped
Since 1955, Hastorf's profes
sional interests have centered on
the handicapped and how their
handicaps influence their be
havior in society. Lately, he has
compared experimental subjects'
reactions and responses to hand
icapped and non-handicapped
persons.
"Put yourself in a wheelchair,
give yourself a bit of palsy, go to a
party and announce that two and
two are five, and no one will say,
'That's a lot of horseshit," said
Hastorf.
He said he has found that
people feel more comfortable
with handicapped persons who
acknowledge their abnormalities
than with those who ignore them.
Football investigation
Hastorf has also conducted an
investigation of a controversial
1951 football game between
Dartmouth and Princeton in
which many penalty calls were
questioned. Then a professor at
Dartmouth, Hastorf and a col
league at Princeton studied the
ways students from the two col
leges perceived the facts. Not
surprisingly, Hastorf discovered
most subjects saw the calls in the
way more favorable to their
school's team.
As Hastorf later commented in
summarizing his 1970 book, Per
son Perception, "Once there was
a group of umpires. The first one
said, 'I call 'em as I see 'em.' The
second one said, 'You're all wet. I
call em as they are.' The third one
said, 'You're both crazy — they
are what I call 'em.'And the fourth
said, They ain't nothing 'til I call
'em.'"

This comment illustrates one of
Hastorf's most recognized traits
— humor. Students and friends of
25 years' standing, like
Dornbusch, all seemed to agree
that he has an acute sense of
humor. Dornbusch, though,
added that Hastorf does not tell
jokes — instead he seizes an op
portunity in the context of the dis
cussion to twist a phrase or turn a
cliche.
Amherst grad
Before coming to the University
here, Hastorf earned his
bachelor's degree at Amherst and
then went on to do graduate work
at Princeton. Then, in 1961, after
12 years on the faculty at
Dartmouth, he was named chair
man of the Psychology Depart
ment here, holding that post for
eight years.
He became the dean of
humanities and sciences in 1970,
but left the job in 1973 because, as
he said, he wanted to "get back to
the firing line of education." He
has been director of Boys Town, a
center for research on youth de
velopment here, since 1975
Hastorf said he is satisfied with
his present post at Bov s 1 own and
doesn't want to return to a time
consuming administrative posi
tion. A member of the search
committee for a provost to re
place William Miller, who is step
ping down in January, Hastorf said
he is a publicly proclaimed non
candidate for the job. He has paid
his "managerial dues" by being a
dean, he said.
Administrative praise
As an administrator, praise from
Pediatrics Prof. Merton Bernfield
for his ability to see all sides of an
issue and decide the most impor
tant for himself.
In addition, Dornbush said Has
tof's outstanding quality as an
administrator is that "when he
wields power, he thinks about
people. He tries to see things

trom the other person's perspec
tive."
And as for some of Hastorf's
own persepctives:
— On tenure: As dean, he
wrote a memo to all faculty saying
a person must be superior in
either teaching or research and at
"least very good" in the other to
be granted tenure. In an article
published in the Daily at the same
time, he stressed the errors to
which the system is prone and the
need to be sparing in appoint
ments to tenure to maintain the
University's financial integrity. In
February, Hastorf said an im
provement in student input to te
nure decisions is possible.
— On curriculum: "We must
develop a clearness of purpose in
our undergraduate program.
We've allowed it to go too much
the cafeteria route." Hastorf said
freshman and sophomore
courses should all stress com
munication skills more strongly.
— On stiff requirements for
pre-med and engineering stu
dents : "I'd love to see those lifted
somewhat."
— On Proposition 6: With 17
other members of the Psychology
Department, Hastorf signed a let
ter saying that "suppressing dis
cussion of homosexuality is not
only restrictive but dangerous."
— On the People's Temple: A
group as isolated as the cult tends
to become paranoid when under
pressure, he said in class.
— On his alma mater: Amherst
is "known for producing
teachers, preachers, and bond
salesmen."
— On his athletic career: "I was
a pole-vaulter in college. In those
days you had to prove your man
hood by winning your freshman
numeral. I would not say I was a
great jock."
— On conversation: "Unfortu
nately, I like to talk more than I
like to listen."
