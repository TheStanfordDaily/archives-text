# Unusual work-study jobs give students needed funds
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Gary Childrey is an assistant
child therapist for the Penin
sula Children's Center. Under
the guidance ot a professional
child therapist, he works with
emotionally disturbed children
every afternoon.
Childrey is just one of many
students here who have found
interesting and unique jobs
under the Federal Work-Study
Program. Although all the jobs
created by the program are not
as interesting as Childrey's, the
program offers financially
needy students a chance to
challenge their abilities and
explore their interests while
earning income to pay for their
education.
Lynne Mason, directorof the
work-study program here, said
that the program offers stu
dents unique opportunities
because it provides money for
jobs that would otherwise be
left undone.
For instance, through the

program, science labs can hire
assistants to provide valuable
help in numerous lab tasks. At
the same time students gain
useful experience in a field of
interest.
To be sure, plenty of clerical
and administrative work is
done by students employed
through the program.
The Black Student Union,
Asian American Student As
sociation, Native American
Cultural Centerand others par
tially owe their existence to
work-study funding.
Diane Burbie is operations
manager at the Black Student
Union (BSU). Her job, funded
by the work-study program,
includes such diverse tasks as
hiring, bookkeeping and prog
ram development and evalua
tion.
One of her recent projects
was a joint effort with the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) to provide
blacks here with assistance in
finding jobs with the help of

peer counselors. First, Burbie
wrote a proposal which was
later approved by the CPPC.
Next, she recruited the peer
counselors. Finally, she com
piled all the information
"specific to minority students
and condensed it," for use by
blacks here seeking jobs in a
number of fields.
Only students who qualify
for financial aid are eligible for
jobs funded through the fed
eral program. The federal gov
ernment agrees to pay 80 per
cent of a student's salary, if the
sponsoring organization will
pay 20 percent. But due to
other administrative costs, the
University actually pays about
one-third of the total cost of
the program, according to Ma
son.
Eligible students have a wide
variety of jobs to choose from,
some requiring special qualifi
cations, others merely requir
ing a willingness to learn. Job
listings are not the only way
work-study jobs are posted,

Mason said. Although the fi
nancial aids office maintains a
large listing of job openings,
students have personally
gained employment to organi
zations they want to work for
under the program.
Under federal guidelines the
organizations must be non
profit and "in the public in
terest," according to Mason.
)obs created by the funding
must not serve to displace cur
rent workers, she added.
Some organizations don't
wait for students to come to
them. "We have employers
who call us and simply list their
jobs," Mason said.
Many of these organizations
are located off-campus. Thus,
students are not exclusively
bound to look for work on the
University campus. Besides the
Peninsula Children's Center,
the Community Association for
Retarded Children, the Sierra
Club and the San Mateo
County Legal Aid Office are
several off-campus organiza
tions that offer work-study pos
itions to students here.
Lory Bitek's job is probably
more typical of work-study.
She works in Meyer Under
graduate Library's language
lab. At the beginning of each
quarter she shows new stu
dents how to use the lab
equipment.
After several weeks, she also
duplicates tapes on cassettes
to allow students to have per
sonal tapes for home instruc
tion. Occasionally, when the
lab here can't satisfy a tape re
quest, she is asked to obtain
tapes from labs at other univer
sities.
Ed Duncan works with data
gathered by researchers at the
University's Primate Research
Facility. He devises graphs and
completes mathematical man
ipulations to organize the data.

Occasionally he helps with
feeding and cleaning of the
animal cages.
Most work-study students
aren't as lucky as Art Cook.
Cook had a chance last year to
work on a self-designed pro
ject at the University Medical
School's division of infectious
diseases. Though he finished
that project, Cookstill works in
the lab performing experi
ments designed by his super
visor.
Currently Cook is working
with cancer-causing viruses in
chickens. He is extracting DNA
from cells infected with such a
virus and laying it over healthy
cells in an effort to determine
which part of the virus is caus
ing the cancer.
It may be difficult to find jobs
like Cook's, but every student
who wants a work-study job
gets one, according to Mason.
"I can't fill the jobs I've got,"
she exclaimed.
Part of the reason that many
jobs go begging, she said, is
that in many cases, if a depart
ment or organization cannot
fill a job with a work-study stu
dent, "they won't fill it" be
cause it would cost too much
to pay the entire salary of the
student.
Last year the University paid
about $120,000 of the $327,000
cost of the program, Mason
said. The amount varies with
the number and need of stu
dents working under the prog
ram, she added.
If it seems that the program
provides an inexhaustible sup
ply of money for interested and
needy students, it doesn't,
Mason said. Each year the gov
ernment asks the University,
how much money it wants, but
"you don't get anywhere near
what you ask for," she said.
