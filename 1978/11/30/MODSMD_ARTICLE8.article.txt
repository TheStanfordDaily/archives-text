## Ted Gioia Press not infallible 
### 
Few today would discount
the vital role the press has
played as watchdog over the
abuses of government. Many
times when the checks and ba
lances of the Constitution have
failed to provide protection
against corruption, the press
has moved in to fill an impor
tant gap. The cloud of the
Nixon administration perhaps
showed its silver lining when it
made it clear that the press
could expose corruption in
even the highest branches of
government.
Several events of the past
year have shown, however,
that the press, like the gov
ernment, is far from infallible.
If the press is to continue to
retain its prestige as a watch
dog, some means must be
found to expose corruption in
the press. Quistustodiet ipsos
Custodes — Who will guard
the guards themselves?
As early as six year* ago, syn
dicated columnist Les Kinsolv
ing began an investigative re
port on the activities of Rev.
)im Jones and his People's
Temple. Kinsolving's life was
threatened and his investiga
tions halted, but not before he
had accumulated enough evi
dence to warrant a full-scale
investigation. An investigation
which never took place.
Both San Francisco dailies re
fused to publish the final chap
ters of Kinsolving's report; yet,
when Lt. Gov..Mervyn Dymally
returned from Guyana with
glowing praise for Jones it
gained full coverage. Figures
show that both the Chronicle
and Examiner accepted money
from Jones, and the record
shows that both kept quiet.
The pull which Jones had in
high levels of government has
already been reported; but
when local officials refuse to
act, it is undoubtedly the re
sponsibility of the press to see
that these abuses do not go
unnoticed. But the press has
too often shown itself vulnera
ble to the very vices it has tried
to correct.
The controversy over the

Farber case in New York is
another excellent example of
the press' reluctance to report
both sides of a question in
which it is involved. The Farber
case is, admittedly, a difficult
question. On one side is
poised a reporter's right to re
tain his notebooks, yet on the
other side a man's right to a fair
trial is being questioned.
Perhaps this short quiz will
make this clear. Do you know
who Mario Jascalevich is? Very
few do, I would imagine. But
several weeks ago Jascalevich
was in serious danger of being
convicted of murder because
he could not gain access to the
material which Farber had
gained against him. Each pas
sing day, while newspaper
headlines proclaimed Farber's
retention, the plight of Jas
calevich remained largely neg
lected.
Let me make it clear that I am
not convinced that Farber
should have surrendered his
notes; I am sure, however, that
the story was grossly misrep
resented in the press. It was
largely due to Farber's efforts
that Jascalevich was indicted
for five murders. Jascalevich's
attorney had reason to believe
that the stories which witnes
ses told Farber did not match
their later testimony — the
doctor's career, not to mention
his life, were on the line and he
was not able to see evidence
which could possibly save him.
The question involved is a
sticky confrontation between
the First Amendment and the
Sixth Amendment. I do not
propose to have the answers,
but the press in its haste to pro
tect self-interests drastically
simplified the issue. As Gary
Wills has pointed out in a rare
dissenting piece in the New
York Times: why should a re
porter have any more right
than the president not to turn
over subpoenaed papers?
The question at stake
stretches even farther than the
rights of the press — it touches
the credibility of the entire
media.

The journalism field is fight
ing for its most fundamental
right — the right to gain and
publish news. Vet if the press is
unable to exhibit discretion in
its own dealings it will turn out
to be its own worst enemy. The
complete freedom of the press
is something many reporters,
including myself, have fought
for for years; it is dishearten
ing to now see the greatest
struggle come from within: the
struggle to maintain a credible
and just press. Reporters must
, show a respect for the rights of
i all individuals, not just for their
own and those of their
sources.
