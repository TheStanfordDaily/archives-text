up wftn she's in a trance. She ..*3W
evenliakes fun of my tattoos. I
like fy macho image. Who is right 7
Max, U. of Cincinnati dropout
To pie down the image and noise level, yet jfL^,
kef that feeling of power, trade for a Vespa Scooter. But what
do/ou want out of life' A good hot bath is a great place to think about it.

D^ r Vittoria,
I gi a Vespa Scooter and I really dig it. I think Vespas are the
arwer to all the world's problems, except this one. I miss my '62 Nash
(tfi seats fold down completely) because I can slip my arm around a
gifs shoulder in a car, but not on a scooter. Is there a solution?
Gary from Wayne University
Dsr Gary.
dl me up sometime. But first, go down to your Vespa dealer and take
aook at the nifty baskets he stocks. They're just right lor books, a
pinic lunch and a blanket. Get the idea 7
