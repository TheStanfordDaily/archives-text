# British mail service profitable, unlike money-losing U.S. post
## 
### 
London (AP) — What? A
postal service that WANTS to
handle magazines, delivers
first-class mail in a single day
and still turns a profit?
Britain has one — and has
this advice for its money-losing
cousin in America: Kick the
habit of government support,
trim off the fat, and get out and
sell your service.
Oh, and don't pay your
employees too much.
That dose of old-fashioned
capitalism is credited with turn
ing the money-losing mail ser
vice into the pride of Britain's
score of nationalized indus
tries — from a $242 million loss
in 1975 to a $77 million profit
last year.
4 o'clock tea
Service isn't what it used to
be. The Post Office admits that
the day is gone forever when a
Briton could get up from
lunch, mail a penny postcard
and be sure it would reach a
hostess in time to count him in
for 4 o'clock tea.
But 93 percent of first-class
letters are delivered the first
working day after mailing, and
the service takes seriously its
failure by 1 percent to get 95.5
percent of second-class mail to
its destination by the third day.
Though distances are obvi
ously not as great in Britain,
even across-town deliveries
have been a problem in the Un
ited States.
Profit 'pretty good'
And while British Post Office
spokesman Robert Hannah
says his country's postal profit
is not one "that a private sector
company of comparable size
would be happy with," it looks
pretty good next to the $1686 a
minute lost by state-owned
British Steel or the U.S. Postal
Service's $688 million loss in
1977.
Counting its other activities,
such as telephone and tele
graph services, postal banking,
the British Post Office's profit
— including the $77 million
from mail services — came to
$708 million last year.
"The major difference bet
ween us and most other postal
services is that we have a finan
cial target set by the govern
ment, and we are allowed to
manage commercially without
detailed control from govern
ment," says Denis Roberts,
postal system managing direc
tor.
"Three years ago the gov

ernment told us they weren't
going to make up our losses
any longer. It was the best
thing that could have hap
pened to us."
Hannah says that produced
"a massive exercise in good
housekeeping. It meant virtu
ally no promotions for any
body for a couple of years. The
staff was reduced by several
thousand, but it saved us liter
ally millions and millions of
pounds.

"And we used to expect that
people would just come to us
because we are the Post Office.
Now we're going out and mar
keting postal business."
Magazines and parcels,
those pariahs of the postal pro
fession, are not despised in Bri
tain. Mailers are actually
courted with discounts. The
average magazine of 2.8
ounces goes for 15 cents —
about 4 cents less than the reg
ular charge.

body for a couple of years. The
staff was reduced by several
thousand, but it saved us liter
ally millions and millions of
pounds.

"And we used to expect that
people would just come to us
because we are the Post Office.
Now we're going out and mar
keting postal business."
Magazines and parcels,
those pariahs of the postal pro
fession, are not despised in Bri
tain. Mailers are actually
courted with discounts. The
average magazine of 2.8
ounces goes for 15 cents —
about 4 cents less than the reg
ular charge.
London (AP) — What? A
postal service that WANTS to
handle magazines, delivers
first-class mail in a single day
and still turns a profit?
Britain has one — and has
this advice for its money-losing
cousin in America: Kick the
habit of government support,
trim off the fat, and get out and
sell your service.
Oh, and don't pay your
employees too much.
That dose of old-fashioned
capitalism is credited with turn
ing the money-losing mail ser
vice into the pride of Britain's
score of nationalized indus
tries — from a $242 million loss
in 1975 to a $77 million profit
last year.
4 o'clock tea
Service isn't what it used to
be. The Post Office admits that
the day is gone forever when a
Briton could get up from
lunch, mail a penny postcard
and be sure it would reach a
hostess in time to count him in
for 4 o'clock tea.
But 93 percent of first-class
letters are delivered the first
working day after mailing, and
the service takes seriously its
failure by 1 percent to get 95.5
percent of second-class mail to
its destination by the third day.
Though distances are obvi
ously not as great in Britain,
even across-town deliveries
have been a problem in the Un
ited States.
Profit 'pretty good'
And while British Post Office
spokesman Robert Hannah
says his country's postal profit
is not one "that a private sector
company of comparable size
would be happy with," it looks
pretty good next to the $1686 a
minute lost by state-owned
British Steel or the U.S. Postal
Service's $688 million loss in
1977.
Counting its other activities,
such as telephone and tele
graph services, postal banking,
the British Post Office's profit
— including the $77 million
from mail services — came to
$708 million last year.
"The major difference bet
ween us and most other postal
services is that we have a finan
cial target set by the govern
ment, and we are allowed to
manage commercially without
detailed control from govern
ment," says Denis Roberts,
postal system managing direc
tor.
"Three years ago the gov

ernment told us they weren't
going to make up our losses
any longer. It was the best
thing that could have hap
pened to us."
Hannah says that produced
"a massive exercise in good
housekeeping. It meant virtu
ally no promotions for any
body for a couple of years. The
staff was reduced by several
thousand, but it saved us liter
ally millions and millions of
pounds.
