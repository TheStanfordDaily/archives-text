# Appetite hormone may be clue to obesity
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Medical researchers
led by a Nobel Prizewinner have identified
an appetite hormone that seems to tell the
brain when the body has had enough to
eat.
If the chemical message is not delivered,
the result may be compulsive overeating
and obesity, at least in laboratory animals,
Dr. Rosalyn Yalow of the Bronx Veterans
Administration Hospital in New York said
this week.
She said tests with mice revealed a dis
tinct relationship between gross overeat
ing and a shortage of cholecystokinin — a
chemical that seems to turn off the urge to
eat.
The research suggests a similar
biochemical imbalance may exist in over
weight people, she said, but that
hypothesis is far from proven and no tests
have been done with human subjects.
"We always hope that what we find out
will benefit people and this is a very prom
ising lead," she said in telephone inter

view. "But you just can't tell until you do
it."
The results of the research will be pre
sented today during a conference on
psychosomatic medicine at UCLA's
Neuropsychiatric Institute in Los Angeles.
To control cholecystokinin-caused
obesity, she said, "you'd have to find a way
to get additional cholecystokinin into the
brain."
Theoretically there are ways of getting
drugs into the brain, but it's uncertain
whether they would give the same results
as those produced naturally, she said.
The hormone apparently dictates long
term eating patterns while playing little or
no role in day-to-day changes in appetite,
she said. Its effect may be dramatic in
those who are grossly overweight, Dr.
Yalow said, "but for those who are some
thing like 20 percent overweight, I really
don't know."
Dr. Yalow shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine in 1977 for her role in developing

the radioimmunoassay, a precise method
of measuring chemicals in the body. The
technique was used in the current re
search with co-worker Dr. Eugene Straus.
Dr. Yalow said 15 years of research had
shown that some types of brain damage
led to uncontrolled eating — victims could
never get enough to eat, gorged them
selves continually and became obese. The
appetite control center was found in a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus.
Dr. Yalow and Straus worked with a st
rain of mice noted for their enormous ap
petitites. The researchers found some
mice from the same litter were twice as fat
as their brothers and sisters.
Tests showed the brains of the overeat
ers contained barely a third as much
cholecystokinin as their more moderate
siblings.
The probable explanation, she said, is
that the appetities of thinner mice are kept
under control by cholecystokinin dis
patched from one part of the brain to the
appetite center.

To control cholecystokinin-caused
obesity, she said, "you'd have to find a way
to get additional cholecystokinin into the
brain."
Theoretically there are ways of getting
drugs into the brain, but it's uncertain
whether they would give the same results
as those produced naturally, she said.
The hormone apparently dictates long
term eating patterns while playing little or
no role in day-to-day changes in appetite,
she said. Its effect may be dramatic in
those who are grossly overweight, Dr.
Yalow said, "but for those who are some
thing like 20 percent overweight, I really
don't know."
Dr. Yalow shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine in 1977 for her role in developing

the radioimmunoassay, a precise method
of measuring chemicals in the body. The
technique was used in the current re
search with co-worker Dr. Eugene Straus.
Dr. Yalow said 15 years of research had
shown that some types of brain damage
led to uncontrolled eating — victims could
never get enough to eat, gorged them
selves continually and became obese. The
appetite control center was found in a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus.
Dr. Yalow and Straus worked with a st
rain of mice noted for their enormous ap
petitites. The researchers found some
mice from the same litter were twice as fat
as their brothers and sisters.
Tests showed the brains of the overeat
ers contained barely a third as much
cholecystokinin as their more moderate
siblings.
The probable explanation, she said, is
that the appetities of thinner mice are kept
under control by cholecystokinin dis
patched from one part of the brain to the
appetite center.
Los Angeles (AP) — Medical researchers
led by a Nobel Prizewinner have identified
an appetite hormone that seems to tell the
brain when the body has had enough to
eat.
If the chemical message is not delivered,
the result may be compulsive overeating
and obesity, at least in laboratory animals,
Dr. Rosalyn Yalow of the Bronx Veterans
Administration Hospital in New York said
this week.
She said tests with mice revealed a dis
tinct relationship between gross overeat
ing and a shortage of cholecystokinin — a
chemical that seems to turn off the urge to
eat.
The research suggests a similar
biochemical imbalance may exist in over
weight people, she said, but that
hypothesis is far from proven and no tests
have been done with human subjects.
"We always hope that what we find out
will benefit people and this is a very prom
ising lead," she said in telephone inter

view. "But you just can't tell until you do
it."
The results of the research will be pre
sented today during a conference on
psychosomatic medicine at UCLA's
Neuropsychiatric Institute in Los Angeles.
