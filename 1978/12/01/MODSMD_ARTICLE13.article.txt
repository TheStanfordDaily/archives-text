## 'Only my opinion' 
### 
Several weeks ago, I
overheard a curious conver
sation. A graduate student
(or perhaps it was a young
professor) was standing
outside one of the clas
srooms in the Inner Quad,
setting an undergraduate
straight about truth, error,
and the pursuit of sociol
ogy-
"By now," he said, "you
should be a good enough
sociologist to know that we
don't talk about ideas as
being true or false. We can
say that one hypothesis fits
the data better than
another, but we don't call it
"truth" — just
"hypothesis" or "opin
ion."
"I see," said the under
graduate. "So I shouldn't
have said that such-and-so
is true, only that it happens
to be my opinion."
"Right," replied her
mentor; "truth is a
philosophical concept, not
a scientific one."
This conversation re
minded me of a seminar at
Johns Hopkins, two years
ago. We were reviewing a
number of models for per
ception; eventually, the
discussion became so in
volved that the leader(a re
cent Stanford Ph.D.) held
up his hands and exclaimed
"Just what are we doing all
this for, anyhow?"
"I thought," I replied,
"we were trying to figure
out whether this model is
true or not."
"True?" he cried, with a
look of incredulity. "True?
What are you talking ab
out? Grow up, kid."
"What are we doing all
this for, anyhow?" This is
the one question which
modern academics cannot
answer — at least the sort
who train sociologists and
psychologists to think as
these two did. And the
University seems to be a
haven for just this sort of
thought — or, perhaps one

should say, of anti
thought.
One reason we don't
know the answer to this
question is that we. don't
have time to think about it.
We are too busy "making
progress" — we know
neither why nor where —
and "achieving" — we
know not what — but in any
case as quickly as we possi
bly can. Indeed, the only
thing of which people
seem to be certain today is
that truth and values are
outmoded, remnants of an
era out of which we hope to
evolve as soon as possible.
We are, as one person put
it, in the position of "saying
that language does not
exist, and writing that there
is no such thing as writing."
To be sure, there are
criteria forjudging a theory
or an opinion. Is it
"dynamic?" Does it have
"heuristic value?" Most
important: is it "original?"
And if not, woe be unto it
— it must be written off as
dogmatism, or obscuran
tism, or nostalgia for the
past. It shall be unto us as
anathema, for it was not
thought of by someone of
the 20th century or disco
vered in a scientific
laboratory.
The curious thing is that
few people seem to see
that the relativistic thinking
which pervades the Uni
versity is fundamentally
self-destructive. We are
rapidly approaching the
point where acceptance of
any truth, whether from
the discipline of art or of
mathematics, is no longer
taken as a sign of the func
tioning of the intellect, but
at best professional discip
line, and at worst, say, "a
morbid fascination with
numbers." We are forced
into the double bind of hav
ing to doubt everything,
yet believe that the intelli
gence expressing this
doubt is competent to do

so.
The ill effects are not
only intellectual but fiscal.
It is becoming increasingly
difficult to justify the set
ting aside of large parcels
of land and millions of dol
lars in support of an enter
prise that seeks only to dis
cover the truth. And inso
far as the University proc
laims that "truth" is an illu
sion from which we are
soon to be liberated, it
writes it own death war
rant. Like the peacock, the
disciplines which once
formed the core of a uni
versity — the humanities
and the pure sciences —
have little or no extrinsic
value. Like the peacock,
they do not produce milk
or eggs; they do not guard
one's house or catch mice;
they do not turn a profit. So
they must be sacrificed and
consumed that the "relev
ant" disciplines may sur
vive.
Let those whose job it
once was to teach us what
is good and just and true
learn "useful" skills. Let
the historians and the
philologists take a course
in business administration;
let the poets and the musi
cians learn computer
programming. Perhaps this
will keep them from starva
tion when they finish
graduate school. The gos
pel according to St. Stan
ford is no longer "seek the
truth, for it will make you
free," but "support the
applied sciences, for they
will keep you out of debt
for another year."
All of this sounds very
pessimistic, and it is. But if
what you have read here
seems disturbing, there is a
simple way to be quit of it
and go about your busi
ness. Just remind yourself
that "it's only his opinion."

formed the core of a uni

Several weeks ago, I
overheard a curious conver
sation. A graduate student
(or perhaps it was a young
professor) was standing
outside one of the clas
srooms in the Inner Quad,
setting an undergraduate
straight about truth, error,
and the pursuit of sociol
ogy-
"By now," he said, "you
should be a good enough
sociologist to know that we
don't talk about ideas as
being true or false. We can
say that one hypothesis fits
the data better than
another, but we don't call it
"truth" — just
"hypothesis" or "opin
ion."
"I see," said the under
graduate. "So I shouldn't
have said that such-and-so
is true, only that it happens
to be my opinion."
"Right," replied her
mentor; "truth is a
philosophical concept, not
a scientific one."
This conversation re
minded me of a seminar at
Johns Hopkins, two years
ago. We were reviewing a
number of models for per
ception; eventually, the
discussion became so in
volved that the leader(a re
cent Stanford Ph.D.) held
up his hands and exclaimed
"Just what are we doing all
this for, anyhow?"
"I thought," I replied,
"we were trying to figure
out whether this model is
true or not."
"True?" he cried, with a
look of incredulity. "True?
What are you talking ab
out? Grow up, kid."
"What are we doing all
this for, anyhow?" This is
the one question which
modern academics cannot
answer — at least the sort
who train sociologists and
psychologists to think as
these two did. And the
University seems to be a
haven for just this sort of
thought — or, perhaps one

should say, of anti
thought.
One reason we don't
know the answer to this
question is that we. don't
have time to think about it.
We are too busy "making
progress" — we know
neither why nor where —
and "achieving" — we
know not what — but in any
case as quickly as we possi
bly can. Indeed, the only
thing of which people
seem to be certain today is
that truth and values are
outmoded, remnants of an
era out of which we hope to
evolve as soon as possible.
We are, as one person put
it, in the position of "saying
that language does not
exist, and writing that there
is no such thing as writing."
To be sure, there are
criteria forjudging a theory
or an opinion. Is it
"dynamic?" Does it have
"heuristic value?" Most
important: is it "original?"
And if not, woe be unto it
— it must be written off as
dogmatism, or obscuran
tism, or nostalgia for the
past. It shall be unto us as
anathema, for it was not
thought of by someone of
the 20th century or disco
vered in a scientific
laboratory.
The curious thing is that
few people seem to see
that the relativistic thinking
which pervades the Uni
versity is fundamentally
self-destructive. We are
rapidly approaching the
point where acceptance of
any truth, whether from
the discipline of art or of
mathematics, is no longer
taken as a sign of the func
tioning of the intellect, but
at best professional discip
line, and at worst, say, "a
morbid fascination with
numbers." We are forced
into the double bind of hav
ing to doubt everything,
yet believe that the intelli
gence expressing this
doubt is competent to do

so.
The ill effects are not
only intellectual but fiscal.
It is becoming increasingly
difficult to justify the set
ting aside of large parcels
of land and millions of dol
lars in support of an enter
prise that seeks only to dis
cover the truth. And inso
far as the University proc
laims that "truth" is an illu
sion from which we are
soon to be liberated, it
writes it own death war
rant. Like the peacock, the

Several weeks ago, I
overheard a curious conver
sation. A graduate student
(or perhaps it was a young
professor) was standing
outside one of the clas
srooms in the Inner Quad,
setting an undergraduate
straight about truth, error,
and the pursuit of sociol
ogy-
"By now," he said, "you
should be a good enough
sociologist to know that we
don't talk about ideas as
being true or false. We can
say that one hypothesis fits
the data better than
another, but we don't call it
"truth" — just
"hypothesis" or "opin
ion."
"I see," said the under
graduate. "So I shouldn't
have said that such-and-so
is true, only that it happens
to be my opinion."
"Right," replied her
mentor; "truth is a
philosophical concept, not
a scientific one."
This conversation re
minded me of a seminar at
Johns Hopkins, two years
ago. We were reviewing a
number of models for per
ception; eventually, the
discussion became so in
volved that the leader(a re
cent Stanford Ph.D.) held
up his hands and exclaimed
"Just what are we doing all
this for, anyhow?"
"I thought," I replied,
"we were trying to figure
out whether this model is
true or not."
"True?" he cried, with a
look of incredulity. "True?
What are you talking ab
out? Grow up, kid."
"What are we doing all
this for, anyhow?" This is
the one question which
modern academics cannot
answer — at least the sort
who train sociologists and
psychologists to think as
these two did. And the
University seems to be a
haven for just this sort of
thought — or, perhaps one

should say, of anti
thought.
One reason we don't
know the answer to this
question is that we. don't
have time to think about it.
We are too busy "making
progress" — we know
neither why nor where —
and "achieving" — we
know not what — but in any
case as quickly as we possi
bly can. Indeed, the only
thing of which people
seem to be certain today is
that truth and values are
outmoded, remnants of an
era out of which we hope to
evolve as soon as possible.
We are, as one person put
it, in the position of "saying
that language does not
exist, and writing that there
is no such thing as writing."
To be sure, there are
criteria forjudging a theory
or an opinion. Is it
"dynamic?" Does it have
"heuristic value?" Most
important: is it "original?"
And if not, woe be unto it
— it must be written off as
dogmatism, or obscuran
tism, or nostalgia for the
past. It shall be unto us as
anathema, for it was not
thought of by someone of
the 20th century or disco
vered in a scientific
laboratory.
