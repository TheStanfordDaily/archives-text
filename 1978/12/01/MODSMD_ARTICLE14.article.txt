## Wade French Mourning is not enough 
### 
San Francisco was beset by deep, numbing
tragedy on Monday morning. Two city officials,
two men who fully deserved the title "public
servants," were murdered in their offices.
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey
Milk were dead. And the city grieved.
The pain and loss so deeply felt by the citizens
of San Francisco spread as quickly as the news of
the acts themselves. Throughout the country
people mourned and shuddered as again they
were forced to face the vulnerability of those
selected to serve them.
But some of us wept not merely at the loss of a
political leader, nor even at the loss of the
cherished public servant. Some of us wept at the
loss of a hero and a friend.
Milk was a man who fought for what he be
lieved in, and what he believed in most was an
end to human suffering. Last year when he came
to speak at the University, he spoke to some of
us beforehand about this commitment to
human welfare. He talked about how he gave up
his job as an accountant because his employers
wouldn't allow him to protest the attacks on
Cambodia in 1970. There was a mischievous
twinkle in his eye as he described the look on his
employers' faces when he told them what they
could do with his job. And as was so much a part
of his character, he made light of the hardships
that he endured because of his determination
not to let anyone cheapen the value he placed
on humanity.
To the gay community, Milk was much more
than just a political leader — he was the emblem
of the new pride, openness, and willingness to
strive actively for political change that has only
recently begun to characterize the efforts of
gays in this country. He seemed to embody the
dreams of gays from every corner of the nation.
Soon after his election, he won passage of the
gay rights ordinance that had been his promise
to the people of his district. In the campaign
against Proposition 6, he led us in our fight
against Sen. Briggs and exposed him and his
proposition for what they really were. Even at
the moment of his death, Harvey Milk was again
working for his people. On the Board of Super
visors' agenda for Monday was a proposal for a
city-funded gay community center that he had

long espoused. His last dream was that instead
of privately mourning our loss that we would all
"come out of the closet" in response to his
death. Especially he wanted the doctors, the
lawyers, the judges and the other professionals
of our society to come out and thereby destroy
the stereotype that has plagued the gay com
munity for so long.
Milk did not win public office through appeals
to bigotry or mistrust. Although himself an ob
ject of hatred, Milk won office by appealing for
unity and working together on common prob
lems. He felt it was important that the non-gay
businesses of the Castro Street area not be pres
sured out by those interested in capitalizing on
the increased property value brought in by the
gay businesses. He wanted to see a total com
munity working together, not yet another gay
ghetto, with its built-in barriers to communica
tion. He and Ruth Silver, another San Francisco
supervisor, often fought side by side for the
causes of minorities, as in their efforts for better
care of the elderly and less housing discrimina
tion. He spoke of the need, both in his speech at
the University and often since then, for a work
ing coalition of blacks, women, gays, Chicanos
and all oppressed groups. "Within five years the
ethnic minorities, women and gays will have the
strongest influence — if not control — in city
government. This is, if they stop playing games
with each other and get it together. . .
Milk was a dreamer. He was a man who
worked hard and committed himself to the
things he believed in. During the candlelight
march for Milk and Moscone on Monday it was
hard to believe that Milk wasn't going to be
there at the end to smile and urge us on, to
revitalize our souls as he had done so often in
the past.
He's gone now. This is a loss that we will
surely feel in our hearts for a long time to come.
But for us merely to mourn his tragic and sense
less death is not enough. We must continue to
dream the dreams he had, and strive to make
them a reality. Only then will the true spirit and
legacy that Milk left us be realized.
