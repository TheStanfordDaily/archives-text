Discrimination
not mentioned
Regarding the story on the
Stanford communications
graduate who became first
woman sports editor of the
New York Times (Daily, Nov.
13), it was interesting that
neither the Daily reporter nor
the interviewee mentioned
one important fact. The New

York Times is approaching or
has already approached the
climax of a several-year-old
court battle in which their resi
dent women journalists filed a
class action suit charging sex
discrimination in hiring,
promotion and salaries. Since
that suit was filed, the "old
grey lady" (that endearing but
misbegotten name for the
Times) has had to reluctantly
clean up its mostly collective

male act to salvage its "liberal"
image. I really enjoyed the
story and I really applaud her
obvious capabilities and the
fact she was hired. Window
dressing? Not really. It goes to
show how some things kind of
slip by, even right by the Daily.
