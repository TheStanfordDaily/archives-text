# The 						reality of rape at Stanford
## 
### 
Recently the Daily has begun
focusing on an important so
cial problem here at the Uni
versity: rape. I find this desp
erately needed attention per
sonally reassuring, because
earlier this quarter I was raped.
The incident occured barely
a mile from campus, on Coyote
Hill Road just after you turn off
of Page Mill Road. I was walk
ing through a field at dusk,
heading for my bicycle which
was parked on Coyote Hill
Road. A man approached me (I
suspected nothing since many
people keep horses in this field
and therefore walk through it),
and asked me what I was doing
there, thus throwing me on the
defensive. After a minute of
conversation I proceeded on
toward my bike. Suddenly he
lunged forward and grabbed
me, pinning my arms back and
clapping his hand over my
mouth. Another man jumped
out from the trees and seized
my legs, and they carried me
down into a dry creekbed and
raped me.
The California penal code
says that the woman must
show a clear "lack of consent."
Well, I did not scream and I did
not fight. The men who at
tacked mewerebigandstrong,
and there were two of them. I
was utterly at their mercy, and
they knew it. They did not
threaten me with a weapon;
they had no reason to. They
told me that if I screamed I
would be hurt; besides, it was
obvious that I could scream all I
wanted and no one would hear
me out there. The only people
around were those at the stable
a half a mile away, and the
commuters roaring home on
Page Mill. Fighting them off was
out of the question, unless I
were a karate expert and could
have knocked one of them un
conscious fast enough to get to
the other one before he got to
me. Naturally, I did not reason
this all out at the time. But in
tuitively I knew that I had no
choice but to submit.
Moreover, I was terrified. I
seriously thought that they in
tended to kill me, that within
the hour I would be dead. If
these bastards are ever caught,
I hope that the courts will be
lieve me when I explain that I
was willing to do literally any
thing ratherthan be killed. Had
my assailants ordered me to
join them in a plot to kill Car
ter, I would have agreed. I re
member crying over and over,
"I'll do anything you ask, but
please don't kill me." Fear re
nders one irrational; after they
had finished and let me go, I
naturally wanted to thank them
for not killing me.
No, I did not resist, and I
came away with hardly a
bruise. Later, reading over the
Working Against Rape pam
phlet passed out last year, I
noticed that the pamphlet
urged women to scream and
fight, and I cursed myself for
my passivity. But upon reflec
tion, I realized that in this par
ticular case I had done the
most intelligent thing.
My assailants were easily
capable of inflicting serious in
jury, and if I had struggled they
would have had nothing to lose
by beating me up, or throwing
me into their car, taking me
somewhere even more sec
luded, and abandoning me.
Had I been badly hurt, I could
have lain in that field hidden
from view, and Cod knows
when someone would have
found me. As it was, I am damn
lucky that their perversion did
not include brutal violence;
the next day the Chronicle ran
an article about a gir! who was
raped and then had both her
arms cut off.
I do not write about this

nightmare to air my experience
at the expense of the taste of
Daily readers. This column is
not easy to write. I admit that
my intention is to shock — to
shock some sense, and maybe
a little fear, into the rest of the
University community, particu
larly the women.
Like most of us at the Univer
sity, I have led a pretty shel
tered life. My family has never
been robbed, and no one I
know has ever been violently
assaulted, or raped. As a result,
I have been going naively and
blissfully through life without
locking doors, walking alone at
night, even occasionally hitch
hiking alone. I always trusted
people and held the
philosophy that if I treated

But these horrors were things that
happened to others — to the hapless
inner city dwellers and the
daughters of the rich and powerful
— not to your average, middleclass
me.

people well and trusted soci
ety, then society would treat
me well in return.
Up until now, all my experi
ence had only confirmed this
blind attitude. Blind, because I
had closed my eyes to the more
sordid realities. Sure, I read the
newspapers, fascinated and
repulsed by the sensational
stories of mass murders and
savage rapes. But these horrors
were things that happened to
others — to the hapless inner
city dwellers and the daughters
of the rich and powerful — not
to your average, middleclass
me. Sure, I glanced through
the Working Against Rape
pamphlet, but it never truly en
tered my mind that I was a po
tential victim. I didn't think
twice about walking home
alone from Meyer at night. If I
allowed the possibility of rape
to slip into my mind, I'd reas
sure myself by thinking, "no
problem — if someone jumped
out from the bush there, I'd
just kick him in the groin,
knock him out with my book
filled backpack, tie up his legs
with my purse strap, and turn
him in." The hell I would. You
just don't realize how helpless
you are!
The other evening a friend in
my house was looking for
someone to run to "the dish"
with her, and I asked her if she
ever ran alone at night. "Oh,
no, not unless I'm staying on
the campus. I always get
another person to come along
if I go to 'the dish.' " I nodded
approval. Then I thought, my
Cod, she should never run
alone, even on campus; the
recent assault on Campus
Drive proved that. As for "the
dish," my two assailants could
easily have overpowered three
women, or even a woman and
a man. People, stay out of
fields after dark! No one is
going to hear you out there if
you scream, no one is going to
help you if you get hurt.
Yet the truly frightening as
pect remains: no amount of
caution can guarantee that you
are sate from rape. Rape is like
traffic accidents: you can do
everything to drive safely and
carefully, but you cannot pre
vent other drivers from run
ning into you. It is impossible
to go through life avoiding
every potentially dangerous
situation, unless you are pre
pared to say goodbye forever
to cars, airplanes, cities at
night, and most athletic ac

tivities. I may have put myself
in foolish, risky situations
numerous times, but when I fi
nally did get assaulted I was not
in a particularly foolish situa
tion, or one which I would
have considered particularly
dangerous. It was barely dusk,
and I'd been in that field alone
hundreds of times.
Of course, it would be con
venient to suggest that my
naive attitude toward violence
indirectly fostered my being
raped, but things just are not
that simple. I could have been
far less naive in my awareness
of violence and behaved far
more cautiously, and I still
would not have judged it
dangerous to be in that field
and I would have been raped

just the same. This is extremely
disturbing. I refuse, however,
to go through life quivering
with paranoia, and I have no
respect forcynicism. While the
incidence of rape is not caused
by ignorance, it is certainly in
creased by it. Just because you
cannot entirely escape traffic
accidents does not mean you
should drive recklessly. Rec
ognize that rape can happen to
you — and now, armed with
that knowledge, let's work to
prevent it.
Someone wrote a letter to
the Daily several weeks ago
suggesting that the general ig
norance of the problem pre
vailed because we never heard
about rape incidents. The wri
ter asked theDa//y if they could
briefly report when and where
an attack occurred, both to
warn and enlighten us. The
Daily explained that they were
not privy to rape reports, and
could not print mere rumors.
Well, I hope that this column
serves to enlighten by making
the problem seem more vividly
real.

As for warning people, why
couldn't the Rape Education
Project print up campus maps
with danger zones highlighted,
and specify certain routee
which would be kept well
lighted and patrolled, as has
been done at Berkeley? The
University administrators do
care; they are extremely con
cerned about rape and were
very helpful and supportive
when I was raped. I am relieved
to see that they are finally br
inging this problem out into
the open; but a lot more needs
to be done before I will feel
safe.
Life does not stop because
something terrible has hap
pened to you. I had to force
myself to get back into school
life, to concentrate on study
ing, to party when I wanted to
cry, to dance when I hated
being touched, to act naturally
around fellow students when I
felt like screaming at them,
"How can you joke with me
when I was raped the other
night?" Healing has not been
easy, but I do know several
things: that despite my experi
ence here, I would not trade
being at Stanford with anyone
at any other school, and that I
amterriby lucky. I was violated,
but I am whole and healthy.
This story may sound grue
some, but hundreds of women
are raped daily, and I suspect (I
hope I never have to find out),
that as far as rapes go mine was
relatively mild. Sometimes,
pedalling across the sunlit
campus, I think of the rape and
it's as though I'm recalling a
movie I saw; I cannot re
member what it was like to be
that scared. Other times, how
ever, when life seems less
friendly, vivid scenes of the
rape come back and haunt me.
