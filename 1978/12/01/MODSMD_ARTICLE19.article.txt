# Chainletter craze goes coast-to-coast
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” A $100-
a-person chain-letter
scheme has swept from the
West to the East Coast in a
matter of weeks, luring
hundreds with promises of
$100,000 payoffs.
But law enforcement offi
cials say the entire chain is
illegal and a fraud, and
they're determined to find
the chain's originators.
The chain, called the
"Circle of Cold," started
about four months ago in
Marin and Santa Cruz coun
ties, according to Bay Area
authorities investigating the
chain.
A month ago it was de
tected in Chicago, and New
York authorities now say the
scheme has spread here,
taking the theatrical com
munity by storm. One
source said that the entire
cast of one Broadway show
was involved, as well as the
staff in the office of a local
hospital.
The chain works like this:
A buyer puts down $100,
and receives two copies of a
list of 12 names. The seller
receives $50 and the other
$50 is sent to the top name
on the list, with the seller

looking on to insure that the
rules are followed.
Then, the name at the top
is crossed off and the seller
puts his name at the bottom
of the list. If the chain is un
broken, he will eventually
rise to the top of the chain,
and will receive $50 from
2048 people.
The buyer, in turn, sells
two copies of the list, re
couping his $100and adding
his name to the bottom of
the list.
Though promoters of the
chain say it is legal because
the letters are exchanged in
person, Judith Ford, direc
tor of consumer fraud for
the San Francisco County
prosecutor's office, said
participants can be prose
cuted for mail fraud, and the
chain's originators are guilty
of a misdemeanor under
California law.
She said she had inter
viewed 15 people who had
joined the chain, and none
had received more than the
$100 they had invested.
"I'd like to warn people
that they are at some point
going to do a disservice to
their friends and families by
selling them these letters."
