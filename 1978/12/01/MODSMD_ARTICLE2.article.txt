# University predicts loss of $7 million by 1984
## 
### KURT COBB Senior staff writer 
Vice-president and Provost Wil
liam Miller reported to the Faculty
Senate yesterday that the University
is forecasting large deficits, perhaps
in the millions, in the next five years.
One pessimistic figure ventured by
Miller estimated the deficit might be
about $7 million by 1984.
Miller said most pressures are
pushing expenses up and income
down, noting that library acquisi
tions, utilities, and plant mainte
nance are expected to rise far
beyond the norm for most other
costs.
Kent Peterson, director of man
agement of financial planning
explained that one factor which is in
creasing the cost of library acquisi
tions is the dollar's decline abroad.
This means that foreign books,
which comprise half of all acquisi
tions, are more expensive.
Miller added that the cost of library
acquisitions is growing 15 percent
faster than the inflation rate.
Peterson also said that the rises in

fuel costs and unexpected plant ex
penses are responsible for the above
normal increases in those areas.
In another report, Dean of Student
Affairs lames Lyons outlined four
major problems with the current
University housing system. First, he
described the 460 living spaces in
Manzanita as "isolated" and "not
good" for undergraduate living. He
said that four-fifths of the students
living there did not choose that resi
dence area.
The second problem is that about
450 students currently living off cam
pus would like to live on campus if
housing space existed.
Third, only 18 percent of all single
graduates are now being housed in
University housing while 58 percent
of all married graduates receive
housing. He said the "inequity is
more than we think is justifiable."
Fourth, he said there would be a
demand for about 1500 spaces by
single graduates if appropriate on
campus facilities could be provided.
A new dormitory that has been
proposed may replace the spaces in

Manzanita, which Lyons said could
then be used for single graduate
housing. He said it is likely that under
such circumstances only three stu
dents would be assigned to each
trailer.
With respect to the proposed new
dormitory Lyons said that the aver
age cost of each new student space
would be about $32,000. Even at this
level, "it appears we can carry that
debt service on rents alone," he said.
The size of the increases necessary
to accomplish this repayment would
only be about 1 or 2 percent beyond
that required to keep up with infla
tion, according to Peterson.
The size of the debt service will
depend on whether the University
can obtain lower interest money
through the California Educational
Facilities Act or whether it will have
to rely on higher interest private
sources.
In response to an unrelated ques
tion, Miller said that a study revealed
that rising tuition, room and board
rates have not affected the composi
tion of those students who enroll
here.

Vice-president and Provost Wil
liam Miller reported to the Faculty
Senate yesterday that the University
is forecasting large deficits, perhaps
in the millions, in the next five years.
One pessimistic figure ventured by
Miller estimated the deficit might be
about $7 million by 1984.
Miller said most pressures are
pushing expenses up and income
down, noting that library acquisi
tions, utilities, and plant mainte
nance are expected to rise far
beyond the norm for most other
costs.
Kent Peterson, director of man
agement of financial planning
explained that one factor which is in
creasing the cost of library acquisi
tions is the dollar's decline abroad.
This means that foreign books,
which comprise half of all acquisi
tions, are more expensive.
Miller added that the cost of library
acquisitions is growing 15 percent
faster than the inflation rate.
Peterson also said that the rises in

fuel costs and unexpected plant ex
penses are responsible for the above
normal increases in those areas.
In another report, Dean of Student
Affairs lames Lyons outlined four
major problems with the current
University housing system. First, he
described the 460 living spaces in
Manzanita as "isolated" and "not
good" for undergraduate living. He
said that four-fifths of the students
living there did not choose that resi
dence area.
The second problem is that about
450 students currently living off cam
pus would like to live on campus if
housing space existed.
Third, only 18 percent of all single
graduates are now being housed in
University housing while 58 percent
of all married graduates receive
housing. He said the "inequity is
more than we think is justifiable."
Fourth, he said there would be a
demand for about 1500 spaces by
single graduates if appropriate on
campus facilities could be provided.
A new dormitory that has been
proposed may replace the spaces in

Manzanita, which Lyons said could
then be used for single graduate
housing. He said it is likely that under
such circumstances only three stu
dents would be assigned to each
trailer.
With respect to the proposed new
dormitory Lyons said that the aver
age cost of each new student space
would be about $32,000. Even at this
level, "it appears we can carry that
debt service on rents alone," he said.
The size of the increases necessary
to accomplish this repayment would
only be about 1 or 2 percent beyond
that required to keep up with infla
tion, according to Peterson.
The size of the debt service will
depend on whether the University
can obtain lower interest money
through the California Educational
Facilities Act or whether it will have
to rely on higher interest private
sources.
In response to an unrelated ques
tion, Miller said that a study revealed
that rising tuition, room and board
rates have not affected the composi
tion of those students who enroll
here.
