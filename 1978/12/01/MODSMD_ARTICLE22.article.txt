# Off-the-hill internships offer critical outlet

### KATHLEEN GILROY 
The prospect of a summer in
ternship in Washington D.C.
for many signifies the prestige
of working alongside senators
and congressmen on Capitol
Hill. While the majority of stu
dents here interested in work
ing in Washington elect a con
gressional internship, a select
few choose to work off the Hill,
outside the congressional sys
tem.
These students' motivations
are as varied as the kinds of
internships off the Hill. For
some, an off-the-Hill intern
ship offers the possibility for
directed reading and research
in a specific field of interest.
Others choose an internship
outside "the system" in order
to look at the workings of
Washington from a critical dis
tance. Whatever the motiva
tions, the Washington intern
ship off the Hill is a qualita
tively different experience for
the student with qualitatively
different advantages and dis

advantages.
Last summer junior Cedric
Smith applied for two intern
ships on Capitol Hill and 15 in
ternships off the Hill. After
being offered four positions,
he decided to wait until he ar
rived in Washington before ac
cepting a specific job.
"When I arrived in
Washington I went to the con
gressional office where I had
been accepted. There were 10
interns already there and I
would have been the eleventh.
They were just searching for
work for the interns to do,"
Smith said.
Instead of falling in behind
10 other students, Smith ac
cepted an internship with the
Center for National Security
Studies, an organization which
studies intelligence agencies in
Washington. Smith selected
the internship out of other al
ternatives because he believed
it would offer him a more inti
mate setting in which to work.
"The internship's advantage

was its size," Smith said. "In
the office there were five staff
members and five interns,
each attached to one staff
member. I had a lot of close
contact with the people in the
office. In fact I was just as much
a part of the staff as the perma
nent people. The office
needed its interns in order to
survive."
Smith's work for the center
entailed first organizing a con
ference sponsored by the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) on abuse in intelli
gence agencies and also re
searching a film on the flows of
intelligence information
among intelligence agencies in
Washington and agencies on
the state and local levels. Smith
said his work took him not only
onto Capitol Hill, but also to all
of the peripheral organizations
dealing with government
abuse. The result, Smith be
lieves, was a broader-based
exposure to Washington."I
got a much fuller experience
working off the Hill. I had a lot
of contact with the Hill through
senate committee hearings on
intelligence. On the Hill, one
tends to think everything is
government. But there are also
thousands of periphery groups

in Washington. In the building
I was in, there were five affinity
groups, Women's Lobby, for
example. The people in these
offices, because of common
concerns, get to know one
another. Through my work, I
talked to these people and be
came aware of things happen
ing outside of government."
Like Smith, senior Molly
Keating had several reasons for
not working on Capitol Hill last
summer. "I thought of working
on the Hill but what a congres
sional internship had to offer
didn't give me free enough
rein to do something I really
believed in." Keating noted the
necessity of sublimating one's
political beliefs while holding a
congressional internship as a
reason encouraging her to
work off Capitol Hill. "My con
gressman, Robert Badham
(R-Newport Beach, Calif.), is a
very conservative man, and I
vehemently disagree with his
politics; and because I disag
ree with his politics I knew I
couldn't work as effectively in
his office as I would like." In
order to have necessary flexi
bility, Keating instead elected
to work for another periphery
organization off the Hill, Wo
men's Lobby. Her internship

entailed lobbying for legisla
tion concerning women's is
sues. In her work this summer,
Keating successfully lobbied
for two bills: legislation on
domestic violence which allo
cated booster federal funding
to permanently establish, on
the state level, shelters for
female victims of such vio
lence; and the pregnancy dis
ability bill which established a
woman's right to take pre
gnancy leave and be re-hired.
As Keating's work took her to
the Hill everyday, she felt she
had the benefits of exposure to
the federal government with
out the drawback of an over
whelming and unsupportive
system. "I got the sense that on
the Hill you are just another in
tern. You are a pain for the of
fices and you don't really know
what's going on. The women I
worked with were so suppor
tive of my work. It was just as
educational if not more than
working on the Hill. I listened
to my co-workers give
speeches on various issues. I
was always going to committee
hearings and listening to de
bates on the floor. On top of it
all, I felt like I could be in
volved personally with what I
was doing."

However, not all internships
off the Hill are broad enough to
encompass action in
Washington's periphery and
the Hill itself. Some students
who elected internships off
Capitol Hill felt disconnected
from the federal system and in
sulated by narrowly-specified
research tasks. Senior Morris
Kremen worked for the Ameri
can Enterprise Institute. His in
ternship involved doing
background research on
frequently-debated topics for a
magazine published by the in
stitute. Kremen believes his
job provided him with no clear
picture of the federal system.
"My work gave me more ac
cess to research and publica
tion of a magazine. In order to
see how the federal govern
ment really worked, I would
have to go back to Washington
again."
Senior Nancy Wilson also
found the nature of her work
off the Hill narrowly limited to
research. Wilson accepted an
internship with the General
Accounting Office (GAO) in
order to do work in foreign in
vestment policy. Before arriv
ing in Washington she had de
veloped a project for GAO in
San Francisco which included

both researching a specific
issue and gathering data for
her research. When she ar
rived in Washington though,
because of her limited amount
of time there, the nature of her
work changed. "When I got
there, the people in GAO had
no real idea about what they
wanted their summer irterns
to do. They asked me what I
was interested in and then they
dug around for a project and
found something in foreign in
vestments. Someone had al
ready started the project they
gave me and it was full of stale
information. I spent most of
my time this summer reading
the data and then was expected
to write up a proposal."
Wilson said part of the prob
lem with her job lay in the
structure of GAO. "GAO isan
office of the legislative braich
of the government. In offices
of the executive branch at least
you are making policy. All GAO
deals with is the follow-up on
issues and it runs into aiot of
bureaucratic problems/ Wil
son recommends a re«earch
job only for student! who
enjoy research and wan 1 to see
how people work in a bireauc

research job is notgoodatall."
Off-the-H ill interrships,
then, offer a vast array of ex
periences, which are some
times more diverse than the
congressional or senatorial in
ternship. While the non-Hill
experience often allows £ stu
dent to work on issues of per
sonal interest, research asks
may be burdensome. Perhaps
of most value to the off-Hll in
tern is being able to viev the
political system from a crtical
distance without having to
shed one's own persuasicns.

The prospect of a summer in

for many signifies the prestige
of working alongside senators
and congressmen on Capitol
Hill. While the majority of stu
dents here interested in work
ing in Washington elect a con
gressional internship, a select
few choose to work off the Hill,
outside the congressional sys
tem.
These students' motivations
are as varied as the kinds of
internships off the Hill. For
some, an off-the-Hill intern
ship offers the possibility for
directed reading and research
in a specific field of interest.
Others choose an internship
outside "the system" in order
to look at the workings of
Washington from a critical dis
tance. Whatever the motiva
tions, the Washington intern
ship off the Hill is a qualita
tively different experience for
the student with qualitatively
different advantages and dis

advantages.
Last summer junior Cedric
Smith applied for two intern
ships on Capitol Hill and 15 in
ternships off the Hill. After
being offered four positions,
he decided to wait until he ar
rived in Washington before ac
cepting a specific job.
"When I arrived in
Washington I went to the con
gressional office where I had
been accepted. There were 10
interns already there and I
would have been the eleventh.
They were just searching for
work for the interns to do,"
Smith said.
Instead of falling in behind
10 other students, Smith ac
cepted an internship with the
Center for National Security
Studies, an organization which
studies intelligence agencies in
Washington. Smith selected
the internship out of other al
ternatives because he believed
it would offer him a more inti
mate setting in which to work.
"The internship's advantage

was its size," Smith said. "In
the office there were five staff
members and five interns,
each attached to one staff
member. I had a lot of close
contact with the people in the
office. In fact I was just as much
a part of the staff as the perma
nent people. The office
needed its interns in order to
survive."
Smith's work for the center
entailed first organizing a con
ference sponsored by the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) on abuse in intelli
gence agencies and also re
searching a film on the flows of
intelligence information
among intelligence agencies in
Washington and agencies on
the state and local levels. Smith
said his work took him not only
onto Capitol Hill, but also to all
of the peripheral organizations
dealing with government
abuse. The result, Smith be
lieves, was a broader-based
exposure to Washington."I
got a much fuller experience
working off the Hill. I had a lot
of contact with the Hill through
senate committee hearings on
intelligence. On the Hill, one
tends to think everything is
government. But there are also
thousands of periphery groups

in Washington. In the building
I was in, there were five affinity
groups, Women's Lobby, for
example. The people in these
offices, because of common
concerns, get to know one
another. Through my work, I
talked to these people and be
came aware of things happen
ing outside of government."
Like Smith, senior Molly
Keating had several reasons for
not working on Capitol Hill last
summer. "I thought of working
on the Hill but what a congres
sional internship had to offer
didn't give me free enough
rein to do something I really
believed in." Keating noted the
necessity of sublimating one's
political beliefs while holding a
congressional internship as a
reason encouraging her to
work off Capitol Hill. "My con
gressman, Robert Badham
(R-Newport Beach, Calif.), is a
very conservative man, and I
vehemently disagree with his
politics; and because I disag
ree with his politics I knew I
couldn't work as effectively in
his office as I would like." In
order to have necessary flexi
bility, Keating instead elected
to work for another periphery
organization off the Hill, Wo
men's Lobby. Her internship

entailed lobbying for legisla
tion concerning women's is
sues. In her work this summer,
Keating successfully lobbied
for two bills: legislation on
domestic violence which allo
cated booster federal funding
to permanently establish, on
the state level, shelters for
female victims of such vio
lence; and the pregnancy dis
ability bill which established a
woman's right to take pre
gnancy leave and be re-hired.
As Keating's work took her to
the Hill everyday, she felt she
had the benefits of exposure to
the federal government with
out the drawback of an over
whelming and unsupportive
system. "I got the sense that on
the Hill you are just another in
tern. You are a pain for the of
fices and you don't really know
what's going on. The women I
worked with were so suppor
tive of my work. It was just as
educational if not more than
working on the Hill. I listened
to my co-workers give
speeches on various issues. I
was always going to committee
hearings and listening to de
bates on the floor. On top of it
all, I felt like I could be in
volved personally with what I
was doing."

However, not all internships
off the Hill are broad enough to
encompass action in
Washington's periphery and
the Hill itself. Some students
who elected internships off
Capitol Hill felt disconnected
from the federal system and in
sulated by narrowly-specified
research tasks. Senior Morris
Kremen worked for the Ameri
can Enterprise Institute. His in
ternship involved doing
background research on
frequently-debated topics for a
magazine published by the in
stitute. Kremen believes his
job provided him with no clear
picture of the federal system.
"My work gave me more ac
cess to research and publica
tion of a magazine. In order to
see how the federal govern
ment really worked, I would
have to go back to Washington
again."
Senior Nancy Wilson also
found the nature of her work
off the Hill narrowly limited to
research. Wilson accepted an
internship with the General
Accounting Office (GAO) in
order to do work in foreign in
vestment policy. Before arriv
ing in Washington she had de
veloped a project for GAO in
San Francisco which included

both researching a specific
issue and gathering data for
her research. When she ar
rived in Washington though,
because of her limited amount
of time there, the nature of her
work changed. "When I got
there, the people in GAO had
no real idea about what they
wanted their summer irterns
to do. They asked me what I
was interested in and then they
dug around for a project and
found something in foreign in
vestments. Someone had al
ready started the project they
gave me and it was full of stale
information. I spent most of
my time this summer reading
the data and then was expected
to write up a proposal."
Wilson said part of the prob
lem with her job lay in the
structure of GAO. "GAO isan
office of the legislative braich
of the government. In offices
of the executive branch at least
you are making policy. All GAO
deals with is the follow-up on

The prospect of a summer in

for many signifies the prestige
of working alongside senators

Hill. While the majority of stu

ing in Washington elect a con
gressional internship, a select
few choose to work off the Hill,
outside the congressional sys

These students' motivations
are as varied as the kinds of
internships off the Hill. For
some, an off-the-Hill intern
ship offers the possibility for
directed reading and research
in a specific field of interest.
Others choose an internship
outside "the system" in order
to look at the workings of
Washington from a critical dis
tance. Whatever the motiva
tions, the Washington intern
ship off the Hill is a qualita
tively different experience for
the student with qualitatively
different advantages and dis

advantages.
Last summer junior Cedric
Smith applied for two intern
ships on Capitol Hill and 15 in
ternships off the Hill. After
being offered four positions,
he decided to wait until he ar
rived in Washington before ac
cepting a specific job.
"When I arrived in
Washington I went to the con
gressional office where I had
been accepted. There were 10
interns already there and I
would have been the eleventh.
They were just searching for
work for the interns to do,"
Smith said.
Instead of falling in behind
10 other students, Smith ac
cepted an internship with the
Center for National Security
Studies, an organization which
studies intelligence agencies in
Washington. Smith selected
the internship out of other al
ternatives because he believed
it would offer him a more inti
mate setting in which to work.
"The internship's advantage

was its size," Smith said. "In
the office there were five staff
members and five interns,
each attached to one staff
member. I had a lot of close
contact with the people in the
office. In fact I was just as much
a part of the staff as the perma
nent people. The office
needed its interns in order to
survive."
Smith's work for the center
entailed first organizing a con
ference sponsored by the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) on abuse in intelli
gence agencies and also re
searching a film on the flows of
intelligence information
among intelligence agencies in
Washington and agencies on
the state and local levels. Smith
said his work took him not only
onto Capitol Hill, but also to all
of the peripheral organizations
dealing with government
abuse. The result, Smith be
lieves, was a broader-based
exposure to Washington."I
got a much fuller experience
working off the Hill. I had a lot
of contact with the Hill through
senate committee hearings on
intelligence. On the Hill, one
tends to think everything is
government. But there are also
thousands of periphery groups

in Washington. In the building
I was in, there were five affinity
groups, Women's Lobby, for
example. The people in these
offices, because of common
concerns, get to know one
another. Through my work, I
talked to these people and be
came aware of things happen
ing outside of government."
Like Smith, senior Molly
Keating had several reasons for
not working on Capitol Hill last
summer. "I thought of working
on the Hill but what a congres
sional internship had to offer
didn't give me free enough
rein to do something I really
believed in." Keating noted the
necessity of sublimating one's
political beliefs while holding a
congressional internship as a
reason encouraging her to
work off Capitol Hill. "My con
gressman, Robert Badham
(R-Newport Beach, Calif.), is a
very conservative man, and I
vehemently disagree with his
politics; and because I disag
ree with his politics I knew I
couldn't work as effectively in
his office as I would like." In
order to have necessary flexi
bility, Keating instead elected
to work for another periphery
organization off the Hill, Wo
men's Lobby. Her internship

entailed lobbying for legisla
tion concerning women's is
sues. In her work this summer,
Keating successfully lobbied
for two bills: legislation on
domestic violence which allo
cated booster federal funding
to permanently establish, on
the state level, shelters for
female victims of such vio
lence; and the pregnancy dis
ability bill which established a
woman's right to take pre
gnancy leave and be re-hired.
As Keating's work took her to
the Hill everyday, she felt she
had the benefits of exposure to
the federal government with
out the drawback of an over
whelming and unsupportive
system. "I got the sense that on
the Hill you are just another in
tern. You are a pain for the of
fices and you don't really know
what's going on. The women I
worked with were so suppor
tive of my work. It was just as
educational if not more than
working on the Hill. I listened
to my co-workers give
speeches on various issues. I
was always going to committee
hearings and listening to de
bates on the floor. On top of it
all, I felt like I could be in
volved personally with what I
was doing."

However, not all internships
off the Hill are broad enough to
encompass action in
Washington's periphery and
the Hill itself. Some students
who elected internships off
Capitol Hill felt disconnected
from the federal system and in
sulated by narrowly-specified
research tasks. Senior Morris
Kremen worked for the Ameri
can Enterprise Institute. His in
ternship involved doing
background research on
frequently-debated topics for a
magazine published by the in
stitute. Kremen believes his
job provided him with no clear
picture of the federal system.
"My work gave me more ac
cess to research and publica
tion of a magazine. In order to
see how the federal govern
ment really worked, I would
have to go back to Washington
again."
Senior Nancy Wilson also
found the nature of her work
off the Hill narrowly limited to
research. Wilson accepted an
internship with the General
Accounting Office (GAO) in
order to do work in foreign in
vestment policy. Before arriv
ing in Washington she had de
veloped a project for GAO in
San Francisco which included

both researching a specific
issue and gathering data for
her research. When she ar
rived in Washington though,
because of her limited amount
of time there, the nature of her
work changed. "When I got
there, the people in GAO had
no real idea about what they

Senior Nancy Wilson also

information. I spent most of
my time this summer reading

Wilson said part of the prob

Off-the-H ill interrships,
then, offer a vast array of ex

congressional or senatorial in

The prospect of a summer in
ternship in Washington D.C.
for many signifies the prestige
of working alongside senators
and congressmen on Capitol
Hill. While the majority of stu
dents here interested in work
ing in Washington elect a con
gressional internship, a select
few choose to work off the Hill,
outside the congressional sys
tem.
These students' motivations
are as varied as the kinds of
internships off the Hill. For
some, an off-the-Hill intern
ship offers the possibility for
directed reading and research
in a specific field of interest.
Others choose an internship
outside "the system" in order
to look at the workings of
Washington from a critical dis
tance. Whatever the motiva
tions, the Washington intern
ship off the Hill is a qualita
tively different experience for
the student with qualitatively
different advantages and dis

advantages.
Last summer junior Cedric
Smith applied for two intern
ships on Capitol Hill and 15 in
ternships off the Hill. After
being offered four positions,
he decided to wait until he ar
rived in Washington before ac
cepting a specific job.
"When I arrived in
Washington I went to the con
gressional office where I had
been accepted. There were 10
interns already there and I
would have been the eleventh.
They were just searching for
work for the interns to do,"
Smith said.
Instead of falling in behind
10 other students, Smith ac
cepted an internship with the
Center for National Security
Studies, an organization which
studies intelligence agencies in
Washington. Smith selected
the internship out of other al
ternatives because he believed
it would offer him a more inti
mate setting in which to work.
"The internship's advantage

was its size," Smith said. "In
the office there were five staff
members and five interns,
each attached to one staff
member. I had a lot of close
contact with the people in the
office. In fact I was just as much
a part of the staff as the perma
nent people. The office
needed its interns in order to
survive."
Smith's work for the center
entailed first organizing a con
ference sponsored by the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) on abuse in intelli
gence agencies and also re
searching a film on the flows of
intelligence information
among intelligence agencies in
Washington and agencies on
the state and local levels. Smith
said his work took him not only
onto Capitol Hill, but also to all
of the peripheral organizations
dealing with government
abuse. The result, Smith be
lieves, was a broader-based
exposure to Washington."I
got a much fuller experience
working off the Hill. I had a lot
of contact with the Hill through
senate committee hearings on
intelligence. On the Hill, one
tends to think everything is
government. But there are also
thousands of periphery groups

in Washington. In the building
I was in, there were five affinity
groups, Women's Lobby, for
example. The people in these
offices, because of common
concerns, get to know one
another. Through my work, I
talked to these people and be
came aware of things happen
ing outside of government."
Like Smith, senior Molly
Keating had several reasons for
not working on Capitol Hill last
summer. "I thought of working
on the Hill but what a congres
sional internship had to offer
didn't give me free enough
rein to do something I really
believed in." Keating noted the
necessity of sublimating one's
political beliefs while holding a
congressional internship as a
reason encouraging her to
work off Capitol Hill. "My con
gressman, Robert Badham
(R-Newport Beach, Calif.), is a
very conservative man, and I
vehemently disagree with his
politics; and because I disag
ree with his politics I knew I
couldn't work as effectively in
his office as I would like." In
order to have necessary flexi
bility, Keating instead elected
to work for another periphery
organization off the Hill, Wo
men's Lobby. Her internship

entailed lobbying for legisla
tion concerning women's is
sues. In her work this summer,
Keating successfully lobbied
for two bills: legislation on
domestic violence which allo
cated booster federal funding
to permanently establish, on
the state level, shelters for
female victims of such vio
lence; and the pregnancy dis
ability bill which established a
woman's right to take pre
gnancy leave and be re-hired.
As Keating's work took her to
the Hill everyday, she felt she
had the benefits of exposure to
the federal government with
out the drawback of an over
whelming and unsupportive
system. "I got the sense that on
the Hill you are just another in
tern. You are a pain for the of
fices and you don't really know
what's going on. The women I
worked with were so suppor
tive of my work. It was just as
educational if not more than
working on the Hill. I listened
to my co-workers give
speeches on various issues. I
was always going to committee
hearings and listening to de
bates on the floor. On top of it
all, I felt like I could be in
volved personally with what I
was doing."

However, not all internships
off the Hill are broad enough to
encompass action in
Washington's periphery and
the Hill itself. Some students
who elected internships off
Capitol Hill felt disconnected
from the federal system and in
sulated by narrowly-specified
research tasks. Senior Morris
Kremen worked for the Ameri
can Enterprise Institute. His in
ternship involved doing
background research on
frequently-debated topics for a
magazine published by the in
stitute. Kremen believes his
job provided him with no clear
picture of the federal system.
"My work gave me more ac
cess to research and publica
tion of a magazine. In order to
see how the federal govern
ment really worked, I would
have to go back to Washington
again."
Senior Nancy Wilson also
found the nature of her work
off the Hill narrowly limited to
research. Wilson accepted an
internship with the General
Accounting Office (GAO) in
order to do work in foreign in
vestment policy. Before arriv
ing in Washington she had de
veloped a project for GAO in
San Francisco which included

both researching a specific
