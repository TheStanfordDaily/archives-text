# Area craftsmen, musicians display talents at annual fair
## 
### DAN JACOBS 
The seventh annual Christ
mas Faire will open this morn
ing at Tresidder Union. Musi
cians, artists and craftsmen will
be displaying and selling their
work. International food and
many kinds of entertainment
will also be featured.
The faire booths, which will
be run through Sunday, will
occupy most of Tresidder.
Jean Martin, program man
ager of Tresidder, said that the
faire is supposed to be a "fun"
event. Seven years ago, re
venues gained from the faire
were considered incidental.
"Another student and myself
wanted to do a fun event be
fore Christmas. A large part of
it was food, drink and music.
We were as surprised as any
body when it made money.
The emphasis even now is still
on entertainment."
The revenues in recent years
have become considerable and
important. Last year the faire
net profit totaled $9000. This
money is now being used to
pay for Program Board ac
tivities, such as musician per
formances and speeches dur
ing the year.
The Board's total budget last
was $40,310, $15,350 of
which was self-generated, and
$9000 of which came directly
from profits. Faire craftsmen
must contribute 20 percent of
their profits to Tresidder.
The 84 craftsmen participat
ing this year were selected
from more than 600 northern
California applicants. Martin

and students from the Program
Board selections based
on the quality and appeal of ar
tists' products. The judges also
look for artists who will be
congenial to other artists and
patrons, Martin said. Each
year, 80 percent of the previ
ous year's participants return,
hence new interested artists
face stiff competition in being
selected.
Fair participants sell numer
ous crafts. "It's an arts and
crafts fair. We have jewelry,
photography, pottery, textiles,
dolls. In each Tresidder room
we set up a stage and have
music, mimes, magic and other
entertainment. In the small
lounge, we have Vietnamese
food, Hanukkah Itakes (Jewish
food) and other international
food.
"It's very relaxed. Particip
ants are there not only to sell
their art but also to have fun,"
Martin said.

One San Jose craftsman,
Beth Noel, will enter the faire
for the second consecutive
year. Noel mounts minerals
and fossils.
She commented, "We try to
enhance the fossil's natural
display. We're the only ones in
the country who do this work."
The Christmas Faire, according
to Noel, has an educated, ap
preciative audience. "It's nice
to show your stuff to a well
informed audience," she ad
ded.
Shelly Komarov, designer
and maker of artificial flowers,
was born in Odessa, Russia.
She won prizes in competition
in Leningrad before emigrat
ing to the United States earlier
this year. Komarov will be dis
playing her work at the faire.
Another craftsman, Holly
Deake, carves pine cone birds
from driftwood. Peake will dis
playing her wares for the
seventh consecutive year.

We were as surprised as any
body when it made money.
The emphasis even now is still
on entertainment."
The revenues in recent years
have become considerable and
important. Last year the faire
net profit totaled $9000. This
money is now being used to
pay for Program Board ac
tivities, such as musician per
formances and speeches dur
ing the year.
The Board's total budget last
was $40,310, $15,350 of
which was self-generated, and
$9000 of which came directly
from profits. Faire craftsmen
must contribute 20 percent of
their profits to Tresidder.
The 84 craftsmen participat
ing this year were selected
from more than 600 northern
California applicants. Martin

and students from the Program
Board selections based
on the quality and appeal of ar
tists' products. The judges also
look for artists who will be
congenial to other artists and
patrons, Martin said. Each
year, 80 percent of the previ
ous year's participants return,
hence new interested artists
face stiff competition in being
selected.
Fair participants sell numer
ous crafts. "It's an arts and
crafts fair. We have jewelry,
photography, pottery, textiles,
dolls. In each Tresidder room
we set up a stage and have
music, mimes, magic and other
entertainment. In the small
lounge, we have Vietnamese
food, Hanukkah Itakes (Jewish
food) and other international
food.
"It's very relaxed. Particip
ants are there not only to sell
their art but also to have fun,"
Martin said.

One San Jose craftsman,
Beth Noel, will enter the faire
for the second consecutive
year. Noel mounts minerals
and fossils.
She commented, "We try to
enhance the fossil's natural
display. We're the only ones in
the country who do this work."
The Christmas Faire, according
to Noel, has an educated, ap
preciative audience. "It's nice
to show your stuff to a well
informed audience," she ad
ded.
Shelly Komarov, designer
and maker of artificial flowers,
was born in Odessa, Russia.
She won prizes in competition
in Leningrad before emigrat
ing to the United States earlier
this year. Komarov will be dis
playing her work at the faire.
Another craftsman, Holly
Deake, carves pine cone birds
from driftwood. Peake will dis
