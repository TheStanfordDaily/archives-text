# Schmalzried shines at both ends
## Stanford spills Santa Clara, 85-73 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Tom Schmalzried's
baseline-to-baseline ferocity
keyed an all-around savage
performance by the Stanford
Cardinals in an 85-73 triumph
over Santa Clara last night at
Maples Pavilion.
Finesse rarely surfaced in
either team's play, as the col
lege students in basketball un
iforms often resembled cave
men in bearskins, ceaselessly
slaughtering each other for re
bounds and pawing at the ball
instead of dribbling it.
Nothing was prehistoric
about the Cards' offense,
however, as Wolfe Perry, Brian
Welch and Schmalzried paced
a solid 49 percent (36-for-74)

shooting effort.
Vet according to Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso, the Cards
won the game with the biggest
intangible of all — emotional
desire.
"The team played with tre
mendous emotion, confi
dence and intensity through
out the game," said Dißiaso.
"We were ready to play when
we came to practice Tuesday."
Nobody evinced this spirit
more than Schmalzried, the
Cards' 6-foot-11 junior center,
who aggressively ripped 13 re
bounds in 2bVi minutes and
helped stifle Santa Clara's
dangerous big men, 6-foot-8
Kurt Rambis and 6-foot-10
Mark McNamara.

Shooting with confidence,
Schmalzried contributed sig
nificantly to Stanford's offen
sive attack with 19 points (15 in
the first half) on 9-for-14 shoot
ing.
"I was super-juiced, and that
made all the difference in my
game," Schmalzried said. "It
was a really emotional game for
all of us."
"Schmalzried did the best
job of his career/' Dißiaso
stated flatly.
Stanford took a 22-16 lead
with 8:51 to go in the first half
and seemingly had control of
the action. But the Broncos
surged back to tie after just one
and a half minutes — one of
five first-half score ties.

Undaunted, the Cards built a
33-28 advantage on a 22-footer
by Welch and lay-ins by
Schmalzried and Paul Giovac
chini. At halftime Stanford still
held a five-point cushion,
41-3b.
Leading 61-55 midway in the
second half, Perry sparked a
10-2 Stanford outburst that
gave the Cards their biggest
lead, 71-57, with 7:39 remain
ing. The senior guard hit two
16-foot jumpers and two free
throws in that stretch.
Perry suffered slightly
strained ligaments in his left
knee and did not start last
night.
"I was mentally bothered by
my knee at first," Perry admit

ted. Eventually, the only
people bothered by Perry's
performance were the Bron
cos, who succumbed to his
22-point, 9-for-17 showing.
"Neither team played well
tonight untii Stanford moved
in the second half when Perry
had that great streak," said
Bronco coach Carroll Williams.
"He always seems to have
good games against us."
Santa Clara put on a minor
scare, closing to within 73-65
on guard Londale Theus'
shooting, but six more Perry
points and two Giovacchini
free throws finally saddled the
Broncos.
