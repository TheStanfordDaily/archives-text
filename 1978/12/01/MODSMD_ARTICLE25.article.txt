# Top seeds in IM finals
## 
### RICK OSTILLER 
The top seed in each of the
four classifications has ad
vanced to Sunday's finals in the
IM football playoffs.
In the A's, the top seeded
Zetes had their second straight
tough game but managed to
hold off Sigma Chi, 6-0. Last
week they needed a last
minute touchdown to edge Biz
11, 20-18. Joining the Zetes in
the finals are the second
seeded Theta Delts, 14-0 vic
tors over Biz I. In the regular
season the Zetes beat the Theta
Delts 6-0 but the Zetes have
had their problems lately and a
Theta Delt upset is a strong
possibility.
In the B's, defending champ
ion Off the Wall Gang, the top
seed, marched into Sunday's
final with a 13-7 victory over
previously undefeated
Kravath, Swaine and Moore.

OTWG will face the second
seeded Ghetto, a 13-0 winner
over a tired DU team. Because
a protest delayed several
games, DU had to play three
contests in as many days. They
beat Spiders from Mars 20-6
Monday and rallied from a 14-0
deficit to upset Donner 18-14
Tuesday. But Wednesday, fac
ing a Ghetto squad that hadn't
played in 10 days, DU couldn't
get things started as it suffered
its only loss of the season.
As for the finals, some
players consider Off the Wall
Gang the best team in either
A's or B's and OTWG should be
able to defend its title Sunday.
In the coed division, top
seeded Taste of Honey routed
Larkin 33-12 while unseeded
Recycling Works annihilated
second-seeded Who Are We,
31-13. Recycling Works was

ranked throughout the regular
season but wasn't seeded in
the playoffs after losing one of
its best players through injury.
The injury hasn't hurt that
much and the Works has an ex
cellent chance to upset Taste cf
Honey in the finals.
In the women's division the
top two seeds are both in the
finals. Top seeded Tastp o :
Honey destroyed Madera 27-t
while second seeded High
Energy beat Roble 1 3-7. Taste
of Honey knocked off High
Energy in the regular season
and the way they are playing
they have a great shot to do it
again Sunday.
Sunday's finals will begin at 1
p.m. with the women's tinals
on 112 ield 7 and the B's on Field
8.
At 2 p.m. the coed final will
be on Field 7 and the A's on
field 8.
