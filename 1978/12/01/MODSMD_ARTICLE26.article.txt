## Cardinals host swim tournament 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Swimmers from about 20
AAU and collegiate teams will
dive into the deGuerre pools
this weekend to participate in
the Stanford Invitational
Championships.
Stanford assistant coach
Claudia Kolb Thomas said that
competition will be very stiff,
especially for the women, but
"we're looking fora good meet
for both the men's and the
women's teams."
A vibrant Stanford aquatic
contingent will face a demand
ing challenge from a host of
outstanding clubs led by age
group and senior powerhouse
Mission Viejo. To enhance

their competitive strengths,
the Nadadores will be tapered,
shaved and skin-suited, pro
viding a vital psychological and
physical edge.
To aid them in meeting strin
gent NCAA qualifying times,
some Stanford men will also
taper and shave, Thomas ad
ded. Their unrested women
counterparts however, may
use last year's times to meet
AIAW national standards. Ac
cording to Thomas, around
one-half of the Stanford
women have already matched
or bettered the necessary
clockings.
AAU teams from Arden Hills,
Santa Clara, Ladera Oaks and

Philadelphia Foxcatchers plus
collegians California and Uni
versity of Pacific will also pre
sent a "tough test."
)esse Vassallo of Mission
Viejo heads a list of notable
individual performers. He cap
tured gold medals in the 400 IM
and the 200 backstroke at the
World Aquatic Championships
held last summer in West Ber
lin.
Cal junior Graham Smith, a
Canadian who won an unpre
cedented six gold events in the
Commonwealth Games this
past summer, spearheads the
visiting university attack. His
teammate backstroker Peter
Rocca, in the words of Stanford

head coach )im Gaughran
"without question the premier
collegiate backstroker," adds
another potential record threat
to the meet's agenda.
Thomas noted that the
dominance of male collegiate
swimmers means that AAU
swimmers proportionately
exert more influence in wo
men's swimming. Mission
Viejo brings top competitors
Jennifer Hooker, Alice
Browne, the former American
record holder in the 200 but
terfly, and explosive
breaststroker Dawn Rodigheo
to press an improved Stanford
team.
Two freshmen, Linda )ezek,
American record holder in the
100 and 200 backstroke, and
Noel Moran, the 1976 National
AAU Indoor 200 breaststroke
champion, give needed depth
to the Stanford varsity which is
otherwise sparked by stalwart
returnees Valerie Lee, Stan
ford's Outstanding Woman
Athlete for the previous two
years, and former Olympian
Kim Peyton.
The women have already
garnered easy victories in their
first two NorCal league meets
this season against California,
Fresno State and San Jose
State. Thomas candidly admit
ted that the NorCal division is
"not very competitive for us".
Gaughran has said the 1978-79
women's team is in better con
tention for attaining an elusive
AIAW national crown than in
previous years.
Senior Mike Bruner, Ameri
can and NCAA record holder in
the 200 fly, will compete in five
events this weekend to spur an
always-strong Stanford men's
team toward a return to na
tional success.
The Invitational's 38 events
will proceed in accordance
with AAU senior meet format,
beginning at 9 a.m. Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. Final
heats will commence daily one
hour after the completion of
the morning preliminaries.
