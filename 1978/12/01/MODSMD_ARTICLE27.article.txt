For the returning varsity players on Stan
ford's national championship water polo
team, last weekend's sudden-death victory in
the finals of the NCAAs in Long Beach was not
only a great way to end a year, it was also
sweet revenge.
Last year, the Cards were seeded No. 1
going into the nationals, hut were upset in
the semi-final round by UC-lrvine. California
went on to claim the title without too much
trouble, as Irvine was no match for the Bears
in finals.
A lot of Stanford players felt they should
have been the champions last year, so the
scene after this year's heart-stoppi.ig victory
was understandably insane.
Seconds after Doug Burke scored the win
ninggoal, the pool becamealivewith scream
ing, ecstatic bodies. Coaches, managers and
even reporters found themselves splashing
around in the pool, fully clothed.
After the pool cleared, freshman )ody
Campbell, Chris Kelseyand Alan Mouchawar
left the champagne-soaking ritual and
jumped off the highest diving platform. They
were followed by the team's three top scorers
— seniors Tom Angelo, Robby Arnold and
Burke.
A number of players said the victory and
the championship felt "better than sex!"
It was the traditional "letting-off-the -the
steam-after-months- of-hard-work" crazies.
In fact, hard work is one of the differences
that distinguished this year's team from last
year's. Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti said
before the NCAAs that his team was in much
better shape this year and was better pre
pared for the nationals.
Angelo, however, said he thought that one
of the major differences was that everyone
really wanted to win it all this year.
Whatever the reason, it was evident from
early on in the season that whatever differ
ences may have existed among the team
members and the coach last year would not
be allowed to thwart this year's champion
ship drive. After the Irvine Tournament in
late September, Stanford's version of "The
Big Red Machine" performed like a well
tuned steam roller, flattening everything in
its way.
Balance was a key to Stanford's attack. De
ttamanti stressed many times that all his
players were very capable of scoring, but
each contributed something special to the
team.
With Campbell and senior Dave Egan re
sponsible for the hole duties, the Cards al
ways had a scoring threat in the middle. The
quick drives of Arnold and Angelo gave Stan-

ford a potent front-court offense that re
sulted in many goals for the Cards and many
ejections for their opponents, as the two
seniors' sudden bursts caught the opposing
players with their hands where they
shouldn't have been.
But the bread-and-butter play for Stanford,
without question, was the counter-attack.
With Kelsey and junior Randy Kalbus leading
the way, the Cards' quick reactions and
speed down the pool was unmatched.
The defense rarely failed the Cards as they
held opponents to an average of six goals per
game. The backbone of the defense was one
)ohn Gansel, sophomore. Winning first-team
All-NCAA Tournament honors for the second
year in a row, Cansel played perhaps his best
game of the year against Cal in the finals.
Besides denying 13 would-be Bear goals,
Cansel guarded the goal during the sudden
death period like a miser guards his gold.
"I was just praying to God that it wouldn't
go in at my end," he said after the game.
If Cansel was the boss of the defense,
Burke was the field foreman. With Arnold
and Angelo providing the necessary goal
output, Burke concentrated on defense for
most of the season. Whenever Stanford had
to have a goal, however, Burke was there.
Besides scoring the winning goal Sunday, the
modest, soft-spoken Burke also beat Cal at
deCuerre th ree weeks ago wi th a last-second
goal.
Although there was no Most Valuable
Player award given at this year's NCAAs, this
reporter's choice would be a tie between
Burke and Mouchawar.
Mouchawar, the player Dettamanti turned
to first when he went to his bench this fall,
made a living out of giving Cal as much trou
ble as possible this year. In five games against
the Bears this season, Mouchawar's three
goals in the NCAA final gave him a totAl of
seven for the tournament — more than any
other Cardinal player except Burke, who also
had seven.
Next year, Stanford will be without the ser
vices of Angelo, Arnold, Burke, Egan and jack
Lorenz. Returning will be Gansel, Kalbus,
Campbell, Kelsey, Mouchawar and a handful
of varsity reserves, including junior Roy
Cedarstrom and sophomores Michael Phil
lips, Bill Taylor, Steve Smith, Mark Kousnetz,
)oe Wall and back-up goalie Vince Vannelli.
In addition, the victory in Long Beach
should make for a successful recruiting year
for the Cards. If this spring's recruiting is as
successful as it was last spring — when it
brought Campbell, Kelsey and Mouchawar to
Stanford — the future of water polo on The
Farm will look very bright indeed.
