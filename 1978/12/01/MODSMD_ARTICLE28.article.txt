# Women keyed for season with talent
## Freshman recruits Paccione, Ruark and Smith add spark to existing Card potential 
### SALLY JENKINS 
Depth is the key to the im
provement of the women's
basketball team this season,
and this depth takes the form
of the new freshmen Paccione,
Ruark and Smith.
Until Louise Smith injured
her ankle in practice, it looked
like three of the starting five
would be freshmen. Starting
the first games in her place will
be sophomore Kathy Murphy,
a veteran from last year.
Don't kid yourself into think
ing they will be hurting with
the loss of forward Smith for
the first games. Murphy led the
team in rebounding last year,
as well as being the No. 2
scorer behind Maggie Nelson,
who has graduated.
Freshman )eanne Ruark av
eraged 34 points and 17 re
bounds per game in 1977-78,
and was named Alabama player
of the year. She had prep highs
of 50 points and 30 rebounds in
games last season.
According to Stanford Coach
Dorothy McCrea, "Potentially,
Jeanne could become one of
the best strong forwards in the
Western United States.
"She shoots effectively from
17 feet and has great inside
moves."
Everyone is expecting great
things from Angie Paccione,
undoubtedly Stanford's star
recruit. Generally regarded as
New York's best player, she set
a state single game scoring re
cord of 62 points, connecting
on 28 of 34 field goal attempts.
She also had nine assists in that
game, accounting for 80 of her
team's 83 points in that game.
Olympics? Could be . . .
The third freshman hotshot
is Smith. Named California 4-A
Player of the Year, she aver
aged 30 poi nts per game and 13
rebounds. Aside from that,
along with Ruark, she's six feet
tall. Look out.
The two returning starters on

the team are co-captains Betsy
Lough and Stephanie Calef.
McCrea said Lough is "by far
our best defensive player.
She's the type of player that
goes unnoticed, but we
couldn't get along without
her."
Senior Galef is best noted for
her rough and tumble style of
play. Her injuries last year in
cluded a broken jaw, but she
hangs in there as the
playmaker, with a team
leading 48 assists last year.
Despite the loss of Nelson,
McCrea said she feels that the
team is greatly improved this
year.
"We have much more depth
this year, particularly at the
guard position. We don't have
to depend on one person to do
the scoring. We have the capa
bility to score more points."
Awesome as the new
freshmen may be, the fact re
mains that they are young.
McCrea doesn't appear overly
worried by that, though she
said she does feel that they
need improvement as a team.
"They have all improved in in
dividual skills, now they need
improvement as a unit."
As for the two opening
games tonight and tomorrow,
McCrea said, "you're always a
little shaky about the first
games, before you get into the
flow of things. Once we do,
though, there shouldn'tbe any
problem."
At any rate, indications are
that the team is greatly im
proved. With new talent, a
more potent offense and some
capable veterans, the Cards
have a running chance to take
the conference championship
this year.
Maybe.
But if not, Stanford certainly
ought to go further than last
year's team. In the regionals,
guess who Stanford had
the wonderful luck to draw in

the first round? None other
than UCLA. Guess what UCLA
won last year? None other than
the national championship.
Uh-oh.
But the Cards did place sec
ond in the NCAC with an over
all record of 17-12, and a 9-3
record in the conference.
The team played an intra
squad game in Maples Satur
day night. McCrea apparently
liked what she saw.
"Our players are improving
all the time," she said. "We're
still young, but I thinkthereare
a number of players who could
have excellent seasons. I was
especially impressed with our
two freshmen, (Paccione and
Ruark)."
Another reason why the
team has such depth lies in the
reserves. Swingman 5-foot-9
Shelly Chapman, and 5-foot-10
forward Kathy Schultz are both
promising freshmen.
McCrea knows how to give
her team incentive, too. When
they practice their free throws
she puts a silver dollar on the
floor. Whoever sinks the most
gets it.
Maybe I should join the
team.

Cardinal forward Kathy Murphy (44) demonstrates the wrist and
knee follow-through that made her Stanford's set ond-leading scorer
last season (14.2 ppg). The 5-10 sophomore was also the team's
leading rebounder.
Depth is the key to the im
provement of the women's
basketball team this season,
and this depth takes the form
of the new freshmen Paccione,
Ruark and Smith.
Until Louise Smith injured
her ankle in practice, it looked
like three of the starting five
would be freshmen. Starting
the first games in her place will
be sophomore Kathy Murphy,
a veteran from last year.
Don't kid yourself into think
ing they will be hurting with
the loss of forward Smith for
the first games. Murphy led the
team in rebounding last year,
as well as being the No. 2
scorer behind Maggie Nelson,
who has graduated.
Freshman )eanne Ruark av
eraged 34 points and 17 re
bounds per game in 1977-78,
and was named Alabama player
of the year. She had prep highs
of 50 points and 30 rebounds in
games last season.
According to Stanford Coach
Dorothy McCrea, "Potentially,
Jeanne could become one of
the best strong forwards in the
Western United States.
"She shoots effectively from
17 feet and has great inside
moves."
Everyone is expecting great
things from Angie Paccione,
undoubtedly Stanford's star
recruit. Generally regarded as
New York's best player, she set
a state single game scoring re
cord of 62 points, connecting
on 28 of 34 field goal attempts.
She also had nine assists in that
game, accounting for 80 of her
team's 83 points in that game.
Olympics? Could be . . .
The third freshman hotshot
is Smith. Named California 4-A
Player of the Year, she aver
aged 30 poi nts per game and 13
rebounds. Aside from that,
along with Ruark, she's six feet
tall. Look out.
The two returning starters on

the team are co-captains Betsy
Lough and Stephanie Calef.
McCrea said Lough is "by far
our best defensive player.
She's the type of player that
goes unnoticed, but we
couldn't get along without
her."
Senior Galef is best noted for
her rough and tumble style of
play. Her injuries last year in
cluded a broken jaw, but she
hangs in there as the
playmaker, with a team
leading 48 assists last year.
Despite the loss of Nelson,
McCrea said she feels that the
team is greatly improved this
year.
"We have much more depth
this year, particularly at the
guard position. We don't have
to depend on one person to do
the scoring. We have the capa
bility to score more points."
Awesome as the new
freshmen may be, the fact re
mains that they are young.
McCrea doesn't appear overly
worried by that, though she
said she does feel that they
need improvement as a team.
"They have all improved in in
dividual skills, now they need
improvement as a unit."
As for the two opening
games tonight and tomorrow,
McCrea said, "you're always a
little shaky about the first
games, before you get into the
flow of things. Once we do,
though, there shouldn'tbe any
problem."
At any rate, indications are
that the team is greatly im
proved. With new talent, a
more potent offense and some
capable veterans, the Cards
have a running chance to take
the conference championship
this year.
Maybe.
But if not, Stanford certainly
ought to go further than last
year's team. In the regionals,
guess who Stanford had
the wonderful luck to draw in

the first round? None other
than UCLA. Guess what UCLA
won last year? None other than
the national championship.
Uh-oh.
But the Cards did place sec
ond in the NCAC with an over
all record of 17-12, and a 9-3
record in the conference.
The team played an intra
squad game in Maples Satur
day night. McCrea apparently
liked what she saw.
"Our players are improving
all the time," she said. "We're
still young, but I thinkthereare
a number of players who could
have excellent seasons. I was
especially impressed with our
two freshmen, (Paccione and
Ruark)."
Another reason why the
team has such depth lies in the
reserves. Swingman 5-foot-9
Shelly Chapman, and 5-foot-10
forward Kathy Schultz are both
promising freshmen.
McCrea knows how to give
her team incentive, too. When
they practice their free throws
she puts a silver dollar on the
floor. Whoever sinks the most
gets it.
Maybe I should join the
team.

senior, noted for her rough-and-tumble style, will be one of the
team's co*captains this season.

leading rebounder.
Depth is the key to the im
provement of the women's
basketball team this season,
and this depth takes the form
of the new freshmen Paccione,
Ruark and Smith.
Until Louise Smith injured
her ankle in practice, it looked
like three of the starting five
would be freshmen. Starting
the first games in her place will
be sophomore Kathy Murphy,
a veteran from last year.
Don't kid yourself into think
ing they will be hurting with
the loss of forward Smith for
the first games. Murphy led the
team in rebounding last year,
as well as being the No. 2
scorer behind Maggie Nelson,
who has graduated.
Freshman )eanne Ruark av
eraged 34 points and 17 re
bounds per game in 1977-78,
and was named Alabama player
of the year. She had prep highs
of 50 points and 30 rebounds in
games last season.
According to Stanford Coach
Dorothy McCrea, "Potentially,
Jeanne could become one of
the best strong forwards in the
Western United States.
"She shoots effectively from
17 feet and has great inside
moves."
Everyone is expecting great
things from Angie Paccione,
undoubtedly Stanford's star
recruit. Generally regarded as
New York's best player, she set
a state single game scoring re
cord of 62 points, connecting
on 28 of 34 field goal attempts.
She also had nine assists in that
game, accounting for 80 of her
team's 83 points in that game.
Olympics? Could be . . .
The third freshman hotshot
is Smith. Named California 4-A
Player of the Year, she aver
aged 30 poi nts per game and 13
rebounds. Aside from that,
along with Ruark, she's six feet
tall. Look out.
The two returning starters on

the team are co-captains Betsy
Lough and Stephanie Calef.
McCrea said Lough is "by far
our best defensive player.
She's the type of player that
goes unnoticed, but we
couldn't get along without
her."
Senior Galef is best noted for
her rough and tumble style of
play. Her injuries last year in
cluded a broken jaw, but she
hangs in there as the
playmaker, with a team
leading 48 assists last year.
Despite the loss of Nelson,
McCrea said she feels that the
team is greatly improved this
year.
"We have much more depth
this year, particularly at the
guard position. We don't have
to depend on one person to do
the scoring. We have the capa
bility to score more points."
Awesome as the new
freshmen may be, the fact re
mains that they are young.
McCrea doesn't appear overly
worried by that, though she
said she does feel that they
need improvement as a team.
"They have all improved in in
dividual skills, now they need
improvement as a unit."
As for the two opening
games tonight and tomorrow,
McCrea said, "you're always a
little shaky about the first
games, before you get into the
flow of things. Once we do,
though, there shouldn'tbe any
problem."
At any rate, indications are
that the team is greatly im
proved. With new talent, a
more potent offense and some
capable veterans, the Cards
have a running chance to take
the conference championship
this year.
Maybe.
But if not, Stanford certainly
ought to go further than last
year's team. In the regionals,
guess who Stanford had
the wonderful luck to draw in

the first round? None other
than UCLA. Guess what UCLA
won last year? None other than
the national championship.
Uh-oh.
But the Cards did place sec
ond in the NCAC with an over
all record of 17-12, and a 9-3
record in the conference.
The team played an intra
squad game in Maples Satur
day night. McCrea apparently
liked what she saw.
"Our players are improving
all the time," she said. "We're
still young, but I thinkthereare
a number of players who could
have excellent seasons. I was
especially impressed with our
two freshmen, (Paccione and
Ruark)."
Another reason why the
team has such depth lies in the
reserves. Swingman 5-foot-9
Shelly Chapman, and 5-foot-10
forward Kathy Schultz are both
promising freshmen.
McCrea knows how to give
her team incentive, too. When
they practice their free throws
she puts a silver dollar on the
floor. Whoever sinks the most
gets it.
Maybe I should join the
team.
