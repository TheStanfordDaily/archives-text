# Ruggers debut in day-long tourney
## 
### 
Between 60 and 70 Bay Area
teams will participate in the
10-a-side tournament that will
open Stanford's rugby season
Saturday. The fields around
Maples Pavilion will be the site
of the tourney which is slated
to begin at 8 a.m. and continue
until dark. Stanford will enter

five or six teams.
Several of the men's team
members are overseas until
Winter quarter, so the Cards
will not be at full strength.
Two or three women's teams
will be participating in a 10-a
-side tournament of their own
at the same time.
