# Motion to 'rescind' invitation fails
## Senate reconsiders Bhutto proposal 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will meet in spe
cial session Monday night at 7:30 in
CSB 75 to discuss further the prop
osed guest professorship offer to
former Pakistani prime minister Ali
Bhutto.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Regina Petty used her pres
idential powers to convene the meet
ing Monday. Earlier, the senate had
voted to hold a special session on the
RHv f »o issue at the beginning of next
quarter. However, Petty said that
"January will be too late" to discuss
the issue.
Controversy has surrounded the
Bhutto issue because of the speed of
the senate's move to offer a profes
sorship to the Pakistani ex-official,
whose appeal is scheduled to come
before the current Pakistani regime
soon.
lonathan Cool, a spokesman for a
large group of mostly Pakistani stu

dents who opposed the offer, said
the issue needs to be more closely
examined by the senate.
He cited an incident in 1975 when
Oxford University refused to grant
Bhutto an honorary degree. It took
Oxford two months to finally make
that decision, he said, and ques
tioned the senate's ability to make a
similar decision in 36 hours.
The Bhutto issue was brought to
the senate's attention by Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) only two
days before the Nov. 9 meeting. At
that time, many senators were under
the impression that Bhutto was to be
executed within 48 hours.
Since that time, however, the
Pakistani government has failed to
carry out the execution. In a letter to
the ASSU, McCloskey stated that ac
cording to the State Department, the
Pakistani Supreme Court's decision
on Bhutto's appeal may be expected
during the first week of December.
Under the senate proposal,

McCloskey would visit Pakistan in
person to offer Bhutto the guest pro
fessorship here.
Anjum Mir, a Pakistani student at
the meeting, said he was pleased
with last night's outcome.
"We made them realize it is an im
portant issue," he said.
He added that the senators do not
haveenough information to offer the
invitation, "or do they have enough
information to revoke it."
Mir said a copy of the Amnesty In
ternational report on Bhutto's reign
has just been placed on record with
the senate, making it available for
senators to read. Mir said he deemed
this document the "most com
prehensive" report of any on Bhut
to's conduct while in office.
Senate chairperson Peter Stamos
said he is still convinced that the re
solution is a good one and that it will
not be rescinded. However, he
added that the senate has a right to
hold a full debate on the matter and

that he supports the special meeting.
Stamos said he found it difficult
last night both to run the meeting
and answer questions concerning
the Bhutto resolution without bias.
At Monday's meeting, Stamos will
yield the chair to his parliamentarian
Roc Blumenthal so he can testify on
the resolution.
Sen. Brett Kingstone said after the
meeting that he is "extremely dis
tressed over the amount of time the
seriate is spending on the Bhutto is
sue."
"What happened to issues like
housing and tuition?" he asked.
Sen. George Drysdale said that the
senate must hold a hearing, get the
facts, and make an informed deci
sion. "We can't just get back to the
affairs of Stanford students," he said.
He added that the senators must set
tle the matter in a responsible way
now that they are involved with it.
In other business, the senate pas
sed a resolution establishing a task
force on consumer affairs "to protect
Stanford students by promoting
competitive prices for goods and
services purchased on campus."
According to the resolution, which
was submitted by Sen. Alex Alben in
conjunction with senior Rick
Gottfried, the task force "shall inves
tigate prices of goods and services
available on campus" compared to
those off campus and "analyze the
fairness of pricing practices."
Another function of the task force
will be "to receive and act upon
complaints filed with the task force
by individual students," which will
include creating a phone line and
complaint file.
As provided for in the resolution,
the academic affairs committee will
recommend a task force director to
serve a three-quarter term, subject to
senate approval.
The director will be responsible for
selecting "interested and qualified
students" to serve on the task force,
and will report its findings regularly
to the academic affairs committee.

that he supports the special meeting.
Stamos said he found it difficult
last night both to run the meeting
and answer questions concerning
the Bhutto resolution without bias.
At Monday's meeting, Stamos will
yield the chair to his parliamentarian
Roc Blumenthal so he can testify on
the resolution.
Sen. Brett Kingstone said after the
meeting that he is "extremely dis
tressed over the amount of time the
seriate is spending on the Bhutto is
sue."
"What happened to issues like
housing and tuition?" he asked.
Sen. George Drysdale said that the
senate must hold a hearing, get the
facts, and make an informed deci
sion. "We can't just get back to the
affairs of Stanford students," he said.
He added that the senators must set
tle the matter in a responsible way
now that they are involved with it.
In other business, the senate pas
sed a resolution establishing a task
force on consumer affairs "to protect
Stanford students by promoting
competitive prices for goods and
services purchased on campus."
According to the resolution, which
was submitted by Sen. Alex Alben in
conjunction with senior Rick
Gottfried, the task force "shall inves
tigate prices of goods and services
available on campus" compared to
those off campus and "analyze the
fairness of pricing practices."
Another function of the task force
will be "to receive and act upon
complaints filed with the task force
by individual students," which will
include creating a phone line and
complaint file.
As provided for in the resolution,
the academic affairs committee will
recommend a task force director to
serve a three-quarter term, subject to
senate approval.
The director will be responsible for
selecting "interested and qualified
students" to serve on the task force,
and will report its findings regularly
to the academic affairs committee.

Dean of Student Affairs james Lyons spoke before the ASSU Senate last night on
the student housing shortage. Lyons is proposing that Manzanita Park be con
verted to graduate housing after 800 new units are constructed west of Lagunita
Court.
The ASSU Senate will meet in spe
cial session Monday night at 7:30 in
CSB 75 to discuss further the prop
osed guest professorship offer to
former Pakistani prime minister Ali
Bhutto.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Regina Petty used her pres
idential powers to convene the meet
ing Monday. Earlier, the senate had
voted to hold a special session on the
RHv f »o issue at the beginning of next
quarter. However, Petty said that
"January will be too late" to discuss
the issue.
Controversy has surrounded the
Bhutto issue because of the speed of
the senate's move to offer a profes
sorship to the Pakistani ex-official,
whose appeal is scheduled to come
before the current Pakistani regime
soon.
lonathan Cool, a spokesman for a
large group of mostly Pakistani stu

dents who opposed the offer, said
the issue needs to be more closely
examined by the senate.
He cited an incident in 1975 when
Oxford University refused to grant
Bhutto an honorary degree. It took
Oxford two months to finally make
that decision, he said, and ques
tioned the senate's ability to make a
similar decision in 36 hours.
The Bhutto issue was brought to
the senate's attention by Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) only two
days before the Nov. 9 meeting. At
that time, many senators were under
the impression that Bhutto was to be
executed within 48 hours.
Since that time, however, the
Pakistani government has failed to
carry out the execution. In a letter to
the ASSU, McCloskey stated that ac
cording to the State Department, the
Pakistani Supreme Court's decision
on Bhutto's appeal may be expected
during the first week of December.
Under the senate proposal,

McCloskey would visit Pakistan in
person to offer Bhutto the guest pro
fessorship here.
Anjum Mir, a Pakistani student at
the meeting, said he was pleased
with last night's outcome.
"We made them realize it is an im
portant issue," he said.
He added that the senators do not
haveenough information to offer the
invitation, "or do they have enough
information to revoke it."
Mir said a copy of the Amnesty In
ternational report on Bhutto's reign
has just been placed on record with
the senate, making it available for
senators to read. Mir said he deemed
this document the "most com
prehensive" report of any on Bhut
to's conduct while in office.
Senate chairperson Peter Stamos
said he is still convinced that the re
solution is a good one and that it will
not be rescinded. However, he
added that the senate has a right to
hold a full debate on the matter and

that he supports the special meeting.
