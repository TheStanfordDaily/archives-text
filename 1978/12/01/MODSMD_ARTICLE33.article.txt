What you are eating
Cantonese. Hunan.
Szechwan. Shanghai.
Time was that only one type
of Chinese food existed in
America. But as American
tastes become more sophisti
cated, and the "Cooking
Craze" gains momentum,
there are more representatives
of the different schools of
Chinese cuisine.
In a country with such a de
sperate food situation, the
Chinese have had to adapt to
the exigencies of the varied
geography. For example,
southern cooking on the coast
is known for its excellent sea
food dishes.
To sort out the various
Chinese cooking styles found
in the Bay Area, here is a brief,
but by no means definitive,
glossary:
NORTHERN (includes Peking
and Hunan)
Typical dishes: barbecued
meats, Mongolian Firepot,
Peking Duck.
Distinguishing characteris
tics: use of chile peppers, gar
lic, green onions, lamb (espe
cially in Mongolia), pungent
sweet-and-sour dishes.
SZECHWAN
Typical dishes: chicken with
hot peppers and nuts,
Szechwan prawns, Szechwan
Duck.
Distinguishing characteris
tics: use of "cloud ear" fun
gus; use of nefarious fagara
pepper, known for its delayed
numbing reaction.
CANTONESE
Typical dishes: the old favo
rites — spring roll, dim sum,
simple stir-fry dishes.
Distinguishing characteris

tics: least oily and most subtle
cooking; use of chicken stock;
mushrooms; a more pale soy
sauce to preserve the natural
colors of the freshest of ingre
dients.

Mui Kiang
895 Villa St.
Mountain View
969-3232
dinner: Sunday to Thursday, 5 to
9:30; Friday & Saturday, 5
to 10:30
Among the great conglom
eration of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there
is a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
About 1600 years ago, a
major revolution in Northern
China caused the elites to flee
to other parts of China and
Southeast Asia. They adopted
the name "Hakka" or "visitor,"
for they always longed to re
turn to their homeland. Over
the centuries, Hakka cuisine
remains both a heritage and a
way of cooking for these
people.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Manda
rin and other styles of Chinese
cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
Stuffed Snow Crab Claws ($3
each) include a savory paste of

chopped shrimp and water
chestnuts dipped in egg batter.
Angel's Treat ($3 for eight)
combines the blended essence
of pork, chicken and milk, and
is not to be missed.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup ($2.50), the chef's own
recipe, is yet another example
of the creativity in which the
Hakka chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
the "most popular dish in
Hong Kong." Seasoned only
with sea salt, it has unparalleled

succulence.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken
and the mustard sauce with
which it is served may not
please every American. This is
not a poor reflection on the
kitchen, but rather it means
that American tastes are not
accustomed to all the tastes of
Chinese cooking.
All of the prawn dishes are
superb. The prawns them
selves are crunchy, not tough

from too much stir-frying.
The vegetable dishes are
models of their kind. Mixed
Mushrooms with Tender
Greens ($4) include Chinese
and straw mushrooms and are
highly recommended.
Finally, in deference to the
American sweet-tooth, the
owners and the chefs have in
vented Heavenly Custard.
Tricky to prepare, the custards
are deep-fried and served
immediately. ($4 and enough
for four.)
Mui Kiang is the Tse family's

third restaurant; the other two
are in Hong Kong and Kow
loon. Incidentally, Edison Tse
is a professor of engineering
economics here.
The exterior of Mui Kiang is
striking and elegant. A stream
representing the Mui Kiang
(Plum Blossom) Kiver forms
part of the landscaping. The in
terior, however, has the same
shortcomings as the interiors
of many other Chinese re
staurants: dining halls in
orange, yellow and red that are
just too big and too bright.
Hardly conducive to intimate
dining.
But do not let this flaw deter
you from enjoying what is
perhaps the best Chinese food
on the Peninsula, or even the
Bay Area.

Su Hong Restaurant

323-6852
If you like Chinese food,
you're certainly in the right
place. The density of Chinese
restaurants per square mile
around Stanford must rival that
of any suburban city. One's di
lemma then, is in choosing
which of the 379 spots to chew
your chow mein.
Until recently I have been a
rather undiscriminating
Chinese gourmand. Quantity
taking precedence over qual
ity. One Chinese restaurant
seeming fnuch like another.
Since an extended period of in
tensive bulks of noodles and
rice (called "starve in Europe
on $10/day or eat Chinese") my
taste in Chinese cuisine has
become somewhat more re
fined.
I now demand more from a

Chinese restaurant than quaint
lanterns, sweet-and-sour pork,
egg rolls and fortune cookies. I
seek a little adventure, an exo
tic dish or two, perhaps a spe
cialty from some lesser known
province — in short, some
thing to distinguish that par
ticular restaurant from the
amorphous blob of all other
chopstick havens.
Su Hong restaurant is disap
pointing in this respect. Al
though its menu includes a
wide variety of Mandarin and
Szechwan dishes, there is little
to lift one to ecstatic heights or
to divert one momentarily
from life's mundane routine.
Perhaps I'm expecting a lot
from mere food, however. The
meals at Su Hong are certainly
hearty and reasonably priced.
The food is well prepared and
the service prompt. It would
make a nice restaurant to lunch
at particularly due to their spe
cial luncheon menu which fea
tures soup, spring roll or fried
won ton, pork fried rice, chow
mein and a main dish — all for
less than $3.
The Winter Melon Soup is
very good as is their Kun Bau
Chicken, a mixture of chicken
and peanuts in a hot sauce. Hot
Szechwan beef is more hot
than tasty. The curry prawns
not bad though again very
spicy. The downfall of the meal
lay not as much with the en
trees, however, but with the
accompanying chow mein,
fried rice, won ton and spring
rolls. All of these items are
somewhat bland and generally
uninspiring.
Among the more interesting
dishes are Oyster Sauce
Abalone, Crab Meat with
Chinese Green and Straw

Mui Kiang
895 Villa St.
Mountain View
969-3232
dinner: Sunday to Thursday, 5 to
9:30; Friday & Saturday, 5
to 10:30
Among the great conglom
eration of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there
is a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
About 1600 years ago, a
major revolution in Northern
China caused the elites to flee
to other parts of China and
Southeast Asia. They adopted
the name "Hakka" or "visitor,"
for they always longed to re
turn to their homeland. Over
the centuries, Hakka cuisine
remains both a heritage and a
way of cooking for these
people.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Manda
rin and other styles of Chinese
cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
Stuffed Snow Crab Claws ($3
each) include a savory paste of

chopped shrimp and water
chestnuts dipped in egg batter.
Angel's Treat ($3 for eight)
combines the blended essence
of pork, chicken and milk, and
is not to be missed.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup ($2.50), the chef's own
recipe, is yet another example
of the creativity in which the
Hakka chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
the "most popular dish in
Hong Kong." Seasoned only
with sea salt, it has unparalleled

succulence.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken
and the mustard sauce with
which it is served may not
please every American. This is
not a poor reflection on the
kitchen, but rather it means
that American tastes are not
accustomed to all the tastes of
Chinese cooking.
All of the prawn dishes are
superb. The prawns them
selves are crunchy, not tough

from too much stir-frying.
The vegetable dishes are
models of their kind. Mixed
Mushrooms with Tender
Greens ($4) include Chinese
and straw mushrooms and are
highly recommended.
Finally, in deference to the
American sweet-tooth, the
owners and the chefs have in
vented Heavenly Custard.
Tricky to prepare, the custards
are deep-fried and served
immediately. ($4 and enough
for four.)
Mui Kiang is the Tse family's

third restaurant; the other two
are in Hong Kong and Kow
loon. Incidentally, Edison Tse
is a professor of engineering
economics here.
The exterior of Mui Kiang is
striking and elegant. A stream
representing the Mui Kiang
(Plum Blossom) Kiver forms
part of the landscaping. The in
terior, however, has the same
shortcomings as the interiors
of many other Chinese re
staurants: dining halls in
orange, yellow and red that are
just too big and too bright.
Hardly conducive to intimate
dining.
But do not let this flaw deter
you from enjoying what is
perhaps the best Chinese food
on the Peninsula, or even the
Bay Area.

If you like Chinese food,
you're certainly in the right
place. The density of Chinese
restaurants per square mile
around Stanford must rival that
of any suburban city. One's di
lemma then, is in choosing
which of the 379 spots to chew
your chow mein.
Until recently I have been a
rather undiscriminating
Chinese gourmand. Quantity
taking precedence over qual
ity. One Chinese restaurant
seeming fnuch like another.
Since an extended period of in
tensive bulks of noodles and
rice (called "starve in Europe
on $10/day or eat Chinese") my
taste in Chinese cuisine has
become somewhat more re
fined.
I now demand more from a

Chinese restaurant than quaint
lanterns, sweet-and-sour pork,
egg rolls and fortune cookies. I
seek a little adventure, an exo
tic dish or two, perhaps a spe
cialty from some lesser known
province — in short, some
thing to distinguish that par
ticular restaurant from the
amorphous blob of all other
chopstick havens.
Su Hong restaurant is disap
pointing in this respect. Al
though its menu includes a
wide variety of Mandarin and
Szechwan dishes, there is little
to lift one to ecstatic heights or
to divert one momentarily
from life's mundane routine.
Perhaps I'm expecting a lot
from mere food, however. The
meals at Su Hong are certainly
hearty and reasonably priced.
The food is well prepared and
the service prompt. It would
make a nice restaurant to lunch
at particularly due to their spe
cial luncheon menu which fea
tures soup, spring roll or fried
won ton, pork fried rice, chow
mein and a main dish — all for
less than $3.
The Winter Melon Soup is
very good as is their Kun Bau
Chicken, a mixture of chicken
and peanuts in a hot sauce. Hot
Szechwan beef is more hot
than tasty. The curry prawns
not bad though again very
spicy. The downfall of the meal
lay not as much with the en
trees, however, but with the
accompanying chow mein,
fried rice, won ton and spring
rolls. All of these items are
somewhat bland and generally
uninspiring.
Among the more interesting
dishes are Oyster Sauce
Abalone, Crab Meat with
Chinese Green and Straw

What you are eating
Cantonese. Hunan.
Szechwan. Shanghai.
Time was that only one type
of Chinese food existed in
America. But as American
tastes become more sophisti
cated, and the "Cooking
Craze" gains momentum,
there are more representatives
of the different schools of
Chinese cuisine.
In a country with such a de
sperate food situation, the
Chinese have had to adapt to
the exigencies of the varied
geography. For example,
southern cooking on the coast
is known for its excellent sea
food dishes.
To sort out the various
Chinese cooking styles found
in the Bay Area, here is a brief,
but by no means definitive,
glossary:
NORTHERN (includes Peking
and Hunan)
Typical dishes: barbecued
meats, Mongolian Firepot,
Peking Duck.
Distinguishing characteris
tics: use of chile peppers, gar
lic, green onions, lamb (espe
cially in Mongolia), pungent
sweet-and-sour dishes.
SZECHWAN
Typical dishes: chicken with
hot peppers and nuts,
Szechwan prawns, Szechwan
Duck.

Southeast Asia. They adopted
the name "Hakka" or "visitor,"
for they always longed to re
turn to their homeland. Over
the centuries, Hakka cuisine
remains both a heritage and a
way of cooking for these
people.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Manda
rin and other styles of Chinese
cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
Stuffed Snow Crab Claws ($3
each) include a savory paste of

chopped shrimp and water
chestnuts dipped in egg batter.
Angel's Treat ($3 for eight)
combines the blended essence
of pork, chicken and milk, and
is not to be missed.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup ($2.50), the chef's own
recipe, is yet another example
of the creativity in which the
Hakka chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
the "most popular dish in
Hong Kong." Seasoned only
with sea salt, it has unparalleled

succulence.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken
and the mustard sauce with
which it is served may not
please every American. This is
not a poor reflection on the
kitchen, but rather it means
that American tastes are not
accustomed to all the tastes of
Chinese cooking.
All of the prawn dishes are
superb. The prawns them
selves are crunchy, not tough

from too much stir-frying.
The vegetable dishes are
models of their kind. Mixed
Mushrooms with Tender
Greens ($4) include Chinese
and straw mushrooms and are
highly recommended.
Finally, in deference to the
American sweet-tooth, the
owners and the chefs have in
vented Heavenly Custard.
Tricky to prepare, the custards
are deep-fried and served
immediately. ($4 and enough
for four.)
Mui Kiang is the Tse family's

third restaurant; the other two
are in Hong Kong and Kow
loon. Incidentally, Edison Tse
is a professor of engineering
economics here.
The exterior of Mui Kiang is
striking and elegant. A stream
representing the Mui Kiang
(Plum Blossom) Kiver forms
part of the landscaping. The in
terior, however, has the same
shortcomings as the interiors
of many other Chinese re
staurants: dining halls in
orange, yellow and red that are
just too big and too bright.
Hardly conducive to intimate
dining.
But do not let this flaw deter
you from enjoying what is
perhaps the best Chinese food
on the Peninsula, or even the
Bay Area.

If you like Chinese food,
you're certainly in the right
place. The density of Chinese
restaurants per square mile
around Stanford must rival that
of any suburban city. One's di
lemma then, is in choosing
which of the 379 spots to chew
your chow mein.
Until recently I have been a
rather undiscriminating
Chinese gourmand. Quantity
taking precedence over qual
ity. One Chinese restaurant
seeming fnuch like another.
Since an extended period of in
tensive bulks of noodles and
rice (called "starve in Europe
on $10/day or eat Chinese") my
taste in Chinese cuisine has
become somewhat more re
fined.
I now demand more from a

Chinese restaurant than quaint
lanterns, sweet-and-sour pork,
egg rolls and fortune cookies. I
seek a little adventure, an exo
tic dish or two, perhaps a spe
cialty from some lesser known
province — in short, some
thing to distinguish that par
ticular restaurant from the
amorphous blob of all other
chopstick havens.
Su Hong restaurant is disap
pointing in this respect. Al
though its menu includes a
wide variety of Mandarin and
Szechwan dishes, there is little
to lift one to ecstatic heights or
to divert one momentarily
from life's mundane routine.
Perhaps I'm expecting a lot
from mere food, however. The
meals at Su Hong are certainly
hearty and reasonably priced.
The food is well prepared and
the service prompt. It would
make a nice restaurant to lunch
at particularly due to their spe
cial luncheon menu which fea
tures soup, spring roll or fried
won ton, pork fried rice, chow
mein and a main dish — all for
less than $3.
The Winter Melon Soup is
very good as is their Kun Bau
Chicken, a mixture of chicken
and peanuts in a hot sauce. Hot
Szechwan beef is more hot
than tasty. The curry prawns
not bad though again very
spicy. The downfall of the meal
lay not as much with the en
trees, however, but with the
accompanying chow mein,
fried rice, won ton and spring
rolls. All of these items are
somewhat bland and generally
uninspiring.
Among the more interesting
dishes are Oyster Sauce
Abalone, Crab Meat with
Chinese Green and Straw

What you are eating
Cantonese. Hunan.
Szechwan. Shanghai.
Time was that only one type
of Chinese food existed in
America. But as American
tastes become more sophisti
cated, and the "Cooking
Craze" gains momentum,
there are more representatives
of the different schools of
Chinese cuisine.
In a country with such a de
sperate food situation, the
Chinese have had to adapt to
the exigencies of the varied
geography. For example,
southern cooking on the coast
is known for its excellent sea
food dishes.
To sort out the various
Chinese cooking styles found
in the Bay Area, here is a brief,
but by no means definitive,
glossary:
NORTHERN (includes Peking
and Hunan)
Typical dishes: barbecued
meats, Mongolian Firepot,
Peking Duck.
Distinguishing characteris
tics: use of chile peppers, gar
lic, green onions, lamb (espe
cially in Mongolia), pungent
sweet-and-sour dishes.
SZECHWAN
Typical dishes: chicken with
hot peppers and nuts,
Szechwan prawns, Szechwan
Duck.
Distinguishing characteris
tics: use of "cloud ear" fun
gus; use of nefarious fagara
pepper, known for its delayed
numbing reaction.
CANTONESE
Typical dishes: the old favo
rites — spring roll, dim sum,
simple stir-fry dishes.
Distinguishing characteris

tics: least oily and most subtle
cooking; use of chicken stock;
mushrooms; a more pale soy
sauce to preserve the natural
colors of the freshest of ingre
dients.

Hong Kong." Seasoned only
with sea salt, it has unparalleled

succulence.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken
and the mustard sauce with
which it is served may not
please every American. This is
not a poor reflection on the
kitchen, but rather it means
that American tastes are not
accustomed to all the tastes of
Chinese cooking.
All of the prawn dishes are
superb. The prawns them
selves are crunchy, not tough

from too much stir-frying.
The vegetable dishes are
models of their kind. Mixed
Mushrooms with Tender
Greens ($4) include Chinese
and straw mushrooms and are
highly recommended.
Finally, in deference to the
American sweet-tooth, the
owners and the chefs have in
vented Heavenly Custard.
Tricky to prepare, the custards
are deep-fried and served
immediately. ($4 and enough
for four.)
Mui Kiang is the Tse family's

third restaurant; the other two
are in Hong Kong and Kow
loon. Incidentally, Edison Tse
is a professor of engineering
economics here.
The exterior of Mui Kiang is
striking and elegant. A stream
representing the Mui Kiang
(Plum Blossom) Kiver forms
part of the landscaping. The in
terior, however, has the same
shortcomings as the interiors
of many other Chinese re
staurants: dining halls in
orange, yellow and red that are
just too big and too bright.
Hardly conducive to intimate
dining.
But do not let this flaw deter
you from enjoying what is
perhaps the best Chinese food
on the Peninsula, or even the
Bay Area.

If you like Chinese food,
you're certainly in the right
place. The density of Chinese
restaurants per square mile
around Stanford must rival that
of any suburban city. One's di
lemma then, is in choosing
which of the 379 spots to chew
your chow mein.
Until recently I have been a
rather undiscriminating
Chinese gourmand. Quantity
taking precedence over qual
ity. One Chinese restaurant
seeming fnuch like another.
Since an extended period of in
tensive bulks of noodles and
rice (called "starve in Europe
on $10/day or eat Chinese") my
taste in Chinese cuisine has
become somewhat more re
fined.
I now demand more from a

Chinese restaurant than quaint
lanterns, sweet-and-sour pork,
egg rolls and fortune cookies. I
seek a little adventure, an exo
tic dish or two, perhaps a spe
cialty from some lesser known
province — in short, some
thing to distinguish that par
ticular restaurant from the
amorphous blob of all other
chopstick havens.
Su Hong restaurant is disap
pointing in this respect. Al
though its menu includes a
wide variety of Mandarin and
Szechwan dishes, there is little
to lift one to ecstatic heights or
to divert one momentarily
from life's mundane routine.
Perhaps I'm expecting a lot
from mere food, however. The
meals at Su Hong are certainly
hearty and reasonably priced.
The food is well prepared and
the service prompt. It would
make a nice restaurant to lunch
at particularly due to their spe
cial luncheon menu which fea
tures soup, spring roll or fried
won ton, pork fried rice, chow
mein and a main dish — all for
less than $3.
The Winter Melon Soup is
very good as is their Kun Bau
Chicken, a mixture of chicken
and peanuts in a hot sauce. Hot
Szechwan beef is more hot
than tasty. The curry prawns
not bad though again very
spicy. The downfall of the meal
lay not as much with the en
trees, however, but with the
accompanying chow mein,
fried rice, won ton and spring
rolls. All of these items are
somewhat bland and generally
uninspiring.
Among the more interesting
dishes are Oyster Sauce
Abalone, Crab Meat with
Chinese Green and Straw
