# Not by bread alone
## The
						Memory Remains 
### Harry Killas 
The orange sun had de
scended into grayness over
Berkeley Memorial Stadium.
As the Band thrashed out the
last bars of "Yellow River," my
roommate turned to me and
said, "Hunan." "Hunan" quic
kened our pace down the lit
tered streets of wasted toy
bears and shattered beer bot
tles. "Hunan" carried us
through the constipation of
Bay Bridge traffic. "Hunan"
was our guide through the
half-deserted streets of
Chinatown.
For years my roommate had
been forced to put up with my
continual adulation of the
Hunan Restaurant. I would
read and reread articles by
Shelton, Caen and Dates in
Gourmet magazine about a
tiny, unpretentious, chaotic
Chinese restaurant that The
New Yorker once proclaimed
the "best" in the world.
At Hunan, you could dine at
a bar and watch cooks prepare
your meal. Both those dressed
in denim and those dressed in
mink stand together in the fog
and damp, often waiting an
hour for a table.

Finally, we were here in the
City, and my roommate could
discover Hunan's food. We
parked the car and walked two
blocks, the solitary streetlamps
threw our shadows up against
the drab brick buildings.
As we rounded the corner,
my heart leaped. I ran to the
storefront, seized the door
handles and pulled. The door
was locked. My friend pointed
to a small piece of cardboard
next to the door. It said the
Hunan had moved to its sec
ond location and showed by
diagram how to get there. The
"original" Hunan, it con
tinued, would re-open some
time next year. . . Thank you.
Still eager, we darted down
Broadway and turned left on
Sansome. In the distance, I
could barely discern the writ
ing on a neon sign. But as we
drew closer, we saw it said
"Hunan," and our feverish
pace stopped.
Inside, everything was
wrong.
We were in a bar and lounge
— an enormous room with
burgundy walls that soared
upward. Chinese poetry in

large white letters com
plemented the repetition of
drink price lists. There were
Home Magazine chairs.
Cocktail waitresses. Even a di
gital cash register. We were
lost in the noise and the chaos
of people laughing, smoking,
drinking.
We forced our way through
the throngs to see how long we
would have to wait. A young,
Oriental fellow in a dark
three-piece suit appeared. "Do
you have reservations?" he
asked. My roommate replied
that we did not. "I'm sorry it's
well over an hour's wait." As
we turned away, disappointed
and defeated, he added,
"Well, you know, it's at least
that long a wait in any good
restaurant in the City on a
Saturday night."
I, however, long for the old
Hunan, to eat at the bar and get
splattered with peanut oil, to
sit at one of the five tables
crammed inside while drinking
beer with my friends. But I
especially hope that my
roommate will know the Hu
nan, not as its sister is now, but
as the friend it once was.

Mushroom, and Rolling Let
tuce Chicken — chopped chic
ken, black mushroom, onion
and waterchestnuts, served
with lettuce, plum sauce and
green onion. I was impressed
with their selection of soups —
spinach bean curd, tomato egg
flower, abalone and seaweed,
to name a few.
For fun you might try a jar of
sake — a rice wine served
warm from a slender china jar.
Tasting nothing like white or
red wines, this fiery liquid re
minds me more of brandy than
anything else, being downed
in tiny thimble-like cups,
rather than sipped from crystal
goblets.

The China Lion
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
The China Lion, though only
in existence tor two years, is
establishing a reputation of ex
cellent Chinese food. Samson
Chu (brother ot "chef Chu"),
owner and head chef, brings a
wide and varied experience to
the restaurant. And it shows.
Opening the first page of the
menu, you will find a guaran
tee that the foods are the finest
available, each ingredient the
best. The dishes are prepared
individually, even down to a
bowl of won ton soup. There
are 180 selections from which
to choose. Many standard dis
hes are offered, but if you call
the China Lion, state the
number in your group and the
price you wish to spend per
person, when you arrive, the
owner promptly prepares
selected dishes.
If you don't find a dish on the
menu (which is hard to believe)
justaskand it will beprepared.
Start with the Po Po Platter
for $2.50. Vou will receive a
plate of egg rolls, beef stick,
wrapped paper chicken, crab
won ton, and barbequed pork,

along with three sauces: very
hot mustard, mild lemon, and
sweet-and-sour. Follow that
with Three Delight Sizzling
Rice Soup. The rice is brought
to the table, and indeed sizzles
when poured into a broth of
chicken, shrimp, beef, chicken
and assorted vegetables. Both
the appetizer and the soup are
fairly mild, and both are great.
There are many dishes to
choose from, but instead of re
lying on an old favorite like
sweet-and-sour pork, experi
ence one of the more unusual
dishes. Lobster Chicken Ball,
though quite an investment at
$7.25, has a sauce which is
made naturally when the lobs
ter, chicken and vegetables

cook together. Hunan Lamb
($5.25) is cooked in a brown
ginger sauce. Three Gems, one
of the most popular dishes at
the China Lion, lets you sample
many different foods. You will
find chicken, beef, prawn,
broccoli, Chinese greens, car
rots, mushrooms and Chinese
cabbage, among many other
ingredients.
The only ingredient you
won't find in any of the China
Lion's dishes is MSG, the in
famous flavor enhancer, used
by many Chinese restaurants.
Every good meal deserves
some wine to complement it.
The wine list actually includes a
Chinese wine. Produced in
California, Fu Jin ($5 per bottle)

is a medium dry, slightly sweet
wine.
And why end the meal at
Swensens? The Lychee, a chil
led truit resembling a c ross be
tween orange and pineapple,
seems a perfect way to end a
Chinese meal.
The dishes at the China Lion
are never greasy. The atmos
phere is quiet and relaxed. The
wines will tantalize you.
The unfortunate part is that
prices will be about 25 cents
higher than at Chef Chu's per
dish. The little extra time to
prepare the dish is worth the
little extra money.
If you're tired of greasy
chopsticks, try the China Lion.

The afternoon sun reflects off El Camino onto the cleanly appointed tables at the China I ion restaurant in
Palo Alto. Here patrons can be assured of dining on great Mandarin and Hunan style Chinese cooking.
