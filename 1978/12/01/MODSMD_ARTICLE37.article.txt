## whitman's 'antigone'/fred cheever Classical tragedy keeps its sting 
### 
"Nobody does dorm plays in the fall quar
ter," according to Bob Gender. He is co
director of Antigone, a Greek tragedy, to
be presented tonight and Saturday even
ing in the Whitman House lounge. Its odd
scheduling is not the only thing that sets
the Whitman production of Antigone
apart from the run-of-the-mill dorm show.
Sophocles' classical tragedy is a far cry
from the musical comedy norm.
Antigone, perhaps the best known of
Greek tragedies, was first performed dur
ing the fifth century B.C. The play draws its
subject from the legend of Oedipus and
his family. The action takes place in
Thebes after the death of Oedipus, the
subsequent civil war, and the death of
Oedipus' two sons. Antigone, one of
Oedipus' daughters, defies the order of
Creon, the new king, and buries
Polyneices, one of her dead brothers. The
conflict between Creon and Antigone
ends in tragedy for both.
A blend
Gender and his co-director Paul August
attempt to blend the traditions of classical
Greek theater with modern stage

techniques. The play is performed in an
cient Creek costume, the principle charac
ters wear masks and act on a bare stage,
accompanied by junior Paul Krieg's origi
nal recorder music.
The production seeks to emphasize the
role of the traditional Creek dramatic
chorus. According to Gender, "The
chorus is the play." All the members of the
cast are members of the chorus. They put
on masks to become major characters and
remove them again when their parts have
been played. August feels that this prac
tice helps to "depersonalize" the principle
characters, subordinating them to the
chorus. The chorus, the bare stage, and
masks make Whitman's Anf/gone very dif
ferent from the average student produc
tion.
Closeness of action
The Whitman lounge, half filled with the
multi-level stage, is a small theater. The
directors hope that the closeness of the
action will heighten audience interest and
sympathy. Though a few couches have
been set up against the walls, most of the
seating is on the floor. To help create a

congenial atmosphere, wine and cheese
will be served.
At first the stage is dark. The lights come
up revealing Antigone (Liz Rosner) alone
on stage. Her sister Esmene (Sari Levine)
enters, and the play begins. As the play
progresses the rest of the cast appears.
Through the main scenes of the play
most of the eight-member cast are on
stage, either in their principle or choral
roles. The scenes are performed one after
another without a break. Lighting designer
Ben Pollock feels the stage lights change to
reflect the changes in "emotional cli
mate." The plot is carried through, the
action is finished, the chorus pronounces
the final words, the lights go out, and once
again the stage is'dark.
In the hour and fifteen minutes of the
play there is no break in the mood. The
plot moves steadily toward its bloody and
sorrowful resolution. Certainly, Sopho
cles' works would not have lasted nearly
twenty-five hundred years if it was not a
potent drama. The Whitman production
proves that time has not stolen its sting.


Whitman's Antigone is being presented tonight and Saturday as the first dorm production of fall quarter.
Principal roles are played by, from left to right: Liz Rosner as Antigone, Mary McNeil as Eurydice and Sari
Levine as Ismene.

characters, subordinating them to the
chorus. The chorus, the bare stage, and
masks make Whitman's Anf/gone very dif
ferent from the average student produc
tion.
Closeness of action
The Whitman lounge, half filled with the
multi-level stage, is a small theater. The
directors hope that the closeness of the
action will heighten audience interest and
sympathy. Though a few couches have
been set up against the walls, most of the
seating is on the floor. To help create a

congenial atmosphere, wine and cheese
will be served.
At first the stage is dark. The lights come
up revealing Antigone (Liz Rosner) alone
on stage. Her sister Esmene (Sari Levine)
enters, and the play begins. As the play
progresses the rest of the cast appears.
Through the main scenes of the play
most of the eight-member cast are on
stage, either in their principle or choral
roles. The scenes are performed one after
another without a break. Lighting designer
Ben Pollock feels the stage lights change to
reflect the changes in "emotional cli
mate." The plot is carried through, the
action is finished, the chorus pronounces
the final words, the lights go out, and once
again the stage is'dark.
In the hour and fifteen minutes of the
play there is no break in the mood. The
plot moves steadily toward its bloody and
sorrowful resolution. Certainly, Sopho
cles' works would not have lasted nearly
twenty-five hundred years if it was not a
potent drama. The Whitman production
proves that time has not stolen its sting.


Whitman's Antigone is being presented tonight and Saturday as the first dorm production of fall quarter.
Principal roles are played by, from left to right: Liz Rosner as Antigone, Mary McNeil as Eurydice and Sari
Levine as Ismene.
"Nobody does dorm plays in the fall quar
ter," according to Bob Gender. He is co
director of Antigone, a Greek tragedy, to
be presented tonight and Saturday even
ing in the Whitman House lounge. Its odd
scheduling is not the only thing that sets
the Whitman production of Antigone
apart from the run-of-the-mill dorm show.
Sophocles' classical tragedy is a far cry
from the musical comedy norm.
Antigone, perhaps the best known of
Greek tragedies, was first performed dur
ing the fifth century B.C. The play draws its
subject from the legend of Oedipus and
his family. The action takes place in
Thebes after the death of Oedipus, the
subsequent civil war, and the death of
Oedipus' two sons. Antigone, one of
Oedipus' daughters, defies the order of
Creon, the new king, and buries
Polyneices, one of her dead brothers. The
conflict between Creon and Antigone
ends in tragedy for both.
A blend
Gender and his co-director Paul August
attempt to blend the traditions of classical
Greek theater with modern stage

techniques. The play is performed in an
cient Creek costume, the principle charac
ters wear masks and act on a bare stage,
accompanied by junior Paul Krieg's origi
nal recorder music.
The production seeks to emphasize the
role of the traditional Creek dramatic
chorus. According to Gender, "The
chorus is the play." All the members of the
cast are members of the chorus. They put
on masks to become major characters and
remove them again when their parts have
been played. August feels that this prac
tice helps to "depersonalize" the principle
characters, subordinating them to the
chorus. The chorus, the bare stage, and
masks make Whitman's Anf/gone very dif
ferent from the average student produc
tion.
