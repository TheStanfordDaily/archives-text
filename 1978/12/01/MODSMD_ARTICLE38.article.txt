### 
lulid
Sunday, Mem Aud
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and com
plete and purposeful intelligence
dominate this movie about
friendship and its respon
sibilities. Jane Fondaand Vanessa
Redgrave star in this true story
based on a chapter of Lillian
Hellman's autobiographical
book Pentimento. Both are bril
liant; Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine, un
derstated performance as the
idealistic Julia.

Sleuth ★★★
Friday, Kresge
This movie's parlor games
begin to drag about two-thirds of
the way through, but the acting
games are more than enough to
sustain your interest. Laurence
Olivier and Michael Caine romp
gleefully through Antony Shaf
fer's excessively witty play about
two men whose English mystery
one-upmanship goes more than
a little too far.
—R.L.
Iphigenia ★★★
New Varsity
Fine, faithful film adaptation of
the Euripedes tragedy. Filmed in
Greece by Michael Cacoyannis,
Iphigenia manages to capture the
spirit of the great play without
mummifying its characters into
institutions rather than people.
With Irene Papas as Clytem
nestra, Costa Kasakos as
Agamemnon, and dark-eyed
Tatiana Papamouskou as the
doomed Iphigenia.

The Wizard of Oz it if it it
Saturday, Cubberley
If you've never seen this
American institution on the big
screen, you're in for a treat. All
the glossiness of the MGM
studios went into the making of
this technicolor confection, and
until you've watched it as it was
meant to be watched — without
the wicked commercials —
you've missed half the fun. Judy
Garland sings, Ray Bolger
dances, Jack Haley squeaks, and
the great Bert Lahr purrs.
—Jim Mattson
Paradise Alley ★★
Old Mill
Sylvester Stallone can't seem
to deal with his success; maybe
he needs to be poor again.
Paradise Alley is a meticulously
crafted, smooth and curiously
lifeless movie, and if Stallone
didn't needlessly shout so much
in it, you'd probably forget about
the film 10 minutes after you'd
seen it.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.
— J.M.

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for! You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at Ev

erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room. _ (

self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.
Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.
—J.M.

Animal House irifkir
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approarh fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
)ohn Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this One; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europef ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as |ust pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-lackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.

If you've never seen this

the glossiness of the MGM

Sylvester Stallone can't seem

One of the year's most promis

its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the

nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.

Who do we fear for! You can't

As always, John Belushi gives

Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy

great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis

Director Fred Zinnemann's

dominate this movie about

This movie's parlor games
begin to drag about two-thirds of

games are more than enough to

Iphigenia ★★★
New Varsity
Fine, faithful film adaptation of
the Euripedes tragedy. Filmed in
Greece by Michael Cacoyannis,
Iphigenia manages to capture the

mummifying its characters into

With Irene Papas as Clytem

If you've never seen this
American institution on the big

the glossiness of the MGM
studios went into the making of
this technicolor confection, and
until you've watched it as it was

you've missed half the fun. Judy
Garland sings, Ray Bolger

the great Bert Lahr purrs.

Paradise Alley ★★
Old Mill
Sylvester Stallone can't seem
to deal with his success; maybe

Paradise Alley is a meticulously

the film 10 minutes after you'd

UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis

Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the

nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low

after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of

turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun

some array of multi-colored cos

Who do we fear for! You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing

The Wiz that fantasy never has a

As always, John Belushi gives

Who is Killing the Great
Chefs of Europef ★★★
Palo Alto Square
It would have been really easy
to dismiss this movie as |ust pure
fluff handled in a fake style way,
but I enjoyed the damn thing,
and I won't deny it. Chefs is a
great throwaway movie, and
even though some of its chemis
try never quite comes off (the
George Segal-lackie Bisset pair
ing especially), the movie works
on a semi-classy what the hell'
level. Robert Morley overacts so
zealously that you begin to enjoy
it.

jane Fonda and Maximillian Schell star in /alia, playing Sunday night at Mem And
lulid
Sunday, Mem Aud
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and com
plete and purposeful intelligence
dominate this movie about
friendship and its respon
sibilities. Jane Fondaand Vanessa
Redgrave star in this true story
based on a chapter of Lillian
Hellman's autobiographical
book Pentimento. Both are bril
liant; Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine, un
derstated performance as the
idealistic Julia.

Sleuth ★★★
Friday, Kresge
This movie's parlor games
begin to drag about two-thirds of
the way through, but the acting
games are more than enough to
sustain your interest. Laurence
Olivier and Michael Caine romp
gleefully through Antony Shaf
fer's excessively witty play about
two men whose English mystery
one-upmanship goes more than
a little too far.
—R.L.
Iphigenia ★★★
New Varsity
Fine, faithful film adaptation of
the Euripedes tragedy. Filmed in
Greece by Michael Cacoyannis,
Iphigenia manages to capture the
spirit of the great play without
mummifying its characters into
institutions rather than people.
With Irene Papas as Clytem
nestra, Costa Kasakos as
Agamemnon, and dark-eyed
Tatiana Papamouskou as the
doomed Iphigenia.

The Wizard of Oz it if it it
Saturday, Cubberley
If you've never seen this
American institution on the big
screen, you're in for a treat. All
the glossiness of the MGM
studios went into the making of
this technicolor confection, and
until you've watched it as it was
meant to be watched — without
the wicked commercials —
you've missed half the fun. Judy
Garland sings, Ray Bolger
dances, Jack Haley squeaks, and
the great Bert Lahr purrs.
—Jim Mattson
Paradise Alley ★★
Old Mill
Sylvester Stallone can't seem
to deal with his success; maybe
he needs to be poor again.
Paradise Alley is a meticulously
crafted, smooth and curiously
lifeless movie, and if Stallone
didn't needlessly shout so much
in it, you'd probably forget about
the film 10 minutes after you'd
seen it.
—R.L.
Lord of the Rings ★
UA Pruneyard, San Jose
One of the year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is
less Tolkien than tacky. The low
est blow is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.

The Wiz ★
Old Mill
A corporate executive's idea of
a movie musical: lots of every
thing — but make sure that we
don't offend anybody. In his de
sire to energize this sprawling
mess, Sidney Lumet, the direc
tor, simply increased the budget,
turned the volume up and en
larged the sets. Individuality and
subtlety are trampled by all the
technology.
The movie has huge sets, hun
dreds of dancers, and an awe
some array of multi-colored cos
tumes. But who do we focus on?
Who do we fear for! You can't
have a fantasy if there's nothing
to fantasize about, if there are no
details for you to wonder at Ev

erything is so loud and huge in
The Wiz that fantasy never has a
chance. I guess fantasies die in
the board room. _ (
The Boys from Brazil irk
Old Mill
While I suppose that it is quite
possible to respect The Boys from
Brazil for being a professionally
crafted thriller, I never found my-

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than
Guano -fl

self liking it. Boys gets it done,
but in a very cold way.
However, the two stars, Greg
ory Peck and Laurence Olivier,
give engaging performances.
And at certain moments, such as
when either of them do some
thing that is just right, you begin
to get immersed in Boys from
Brazil. Then the movie pulls
away.
The film needs the reckless
energy — the sense of urgency —
that the best thrillers have, and
which young directors like Brian
De Palma and Steven Spielberg
infuse into their movies. I em
phasize young because it is a
central issue in Boys from Brazil.
What is old and tired is its ap
proach, not its stars. Profes
sionalism can only do so much.

Midnight Express
Guild, Menlo Park
Columbia Pictures proudly
presents the first mainstream ex
cursion into sado-masochism.
This textbook case of rabid
cinema is the violence-fortified
story of Billy Hayes, an American
college dropout imprisoned in
Turkey for the possession of two
pounds of hashish. If you should
hear Midnight Express' whistle
a'blowing, take the bus instead.
—J.M.
Watership Down ★
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most not
able for its lack of distinction —
I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster talking rabbits any day.
Director Martin Rosen has brag
ged in interviews that he knew
nothing about animation before
undertaking Watership Down,
and it shows in every
institutionally-colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy which, instead of waking
you up, makes you the the
ater feeling as if you've slept all
night with your mouth open.
—J.M.
Violette ★★★
Clay, San Francisco
Violette Noziere poisoned her
father and mother; her father
died but her mother survived to
press charges. Claude Chabrol
directed this intelligent, slow
moving examination of the
"French Lizzie Borden." Much of
the film's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle
Huppert as Violette; she cap
tures the spoiled, confused air of
this curiously sympathetic mur
deress.
—J.M.

Animal House irifkir
Old Mill
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approarh fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals" in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
)ohn Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this One; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
