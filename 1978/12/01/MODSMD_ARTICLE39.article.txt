This evening (Sunday, Nov.
19) they very nearly took the
advice you handed them in
Cinemascope on Friday and
carried it, along with their
books to the library, saving the
dollar and the two hours it
would cost to see The Good
bye Girl at the Sunday Flicks. I
believe it was the extreme
self-confidence with which
you branded Richard Dreyfuss'
Academy Award-winning per
formance "two-star," and the
apparent expertise from which
you drew to label Neil Simon's
approach to humor in this film
"clinical" and a "turn-off" that
was almost overwhelming
enough to save them from the
long lines outside of Memorial
Auditorium...but not quite.
Fortunately enough, the idea
of studying was so utterly unat
tractive that any diversion, no
matter how many rating stars
attached, would have drawn
them away from the carrels. It
was outside Mem Aud that
each found a near sell-out
crowd of other somewhat
selective, slightly sophisticated
film-going Stanford students
who were willing to endure
long rainy cues and two hours
of psychological manipulation
by Simon's "fair" comedy to be
able to devote a little more
Big-Game-Weekend time to
not learning anything. It was
inside Mem Aud that they were
delightedly surprised by a very,
very funny movie - enough so
that they laughed uncontrolla
bly, applauded loudly and fre

quently and left feeling bubbly
good (of course I speak only for
those who made all the noise).
And I am writing to propose
that your self-confidence is un
founded; that 'psuedo-'should
be plainly attached to the word
'expertise' to characterize your
tone; that, specifically, you
apply such adjectives as 'turn
off far too broadly; and most
importantly, that you owe it to
your readers to establish very
clearly how unobjective your
viewpoints really are, to outline
your personal criteria in rating
films and to dispel the miscon
ception which your tone has
thus far promoted through lack
of qualification of terms that
yours (and that of your col
league, John Nielsen, who
boldly stamped one star next to
The Turning Point) is the last
word in film rating and criti
cism.
Obviously, I recognize that
you are only offering your opin
ions and, quality in film or in
any art is not determined by
majority or crowd approval, but
when you deviate so. far from
the general opinion of those
who really know what makes a
film good or bad you should at
least be held responsible to
elaborate on and qualify your
judgements, especially in the
absence of a representation of
other well founded view
points. I do not believe you
have been so responsible.
I am no expert, I am not cer
tain of these opinions which I
here express, and criticizing

critics places one in a very vul
nerable position. Yet I hope
this letter and responses to it
are printed. To the editors, I
pose, "What is the role of
aesthetic criticism, and are
your reviewers fairly assuming
that role?"

Manager, ASSU Sunday Flicks

Since Jay's letter asks very
hard questions that do need to
be answered, we have decided
to reply to his letter with re
sponses that are lengthier than
the usual staff replies to letters
to the Editor. Hopefully, this
will help to make some of our
positions regarding movies
more understandable.
lay:
In a perverse way, we ap
preciateyourattackon ourcrit
ical virility— it indicates, to our
great relief, that someone is
paying attention. And whether
or not you meant it, we enjoy
being said to have "aesthetics"
— it's quite a change from what
we're used to hearing from
people with whom we differ.
But despite all that, we think
you've missed the point. What
we're out to do is to get people
to look at movies in an active
way — to turn their emotions
on, and by so doing get them to
develop a new basis for making
their movie judgments.
A statement of our "aesthe
tics" will probably fail to be a
complete (or regrettably, a
satisfactory) one. The danger
here for critics is that, in laying

out their standards, they trap
themselves in rigid theories
that often lead them to false
and contorted views. Movies
that critics may love sometimes
won't fit their theories, and too
often they will deny their emo
tions and accept their intellec
tual theorizing.
Thus our "aesthetics" are
necessarily eclectic in nature,
and the terms perhaps too
broad and too general. But
here goes. As critics, we try to
relate our thoughts and feel
ings about everything that
could possibly pertain to the
movie we are watching.
Because we turn our emo
tions on in watching a movie,
we look to see if the primary
forces behind the film,
whether they be the screenwri
ter, the producer, or, and this
is more often the case, the di
rector, have exploited their ta
lents to the fullest or whether
they have let themselves fake
their way through. The best
movies are made by people
who go all the way, who take
their talent to the limit, who
tackle old problems in new and
imaginative ways or who sim
ply (and it isn't simple) con
struct completely new view
points.
When a movie and its makers
don't do this, we are prone to
use adjectives like "clinical"
and "turn-off" because that's
the way we feel. We feel sold
out. Why should we try to go all
the way as movie critics when
the movie and the people who

made it haven't pushed them
selves? When a movie is a rehash
of one-liners like The Goodbye
Girl or a pretentious and half
hearted attempt at a "film
about women" like The Turn
ing Point, we feel compelled to
attack them, because if we
don't, we deny our emotions,
and that's precisely what we
want to avoid.
This sense of being turned
off is necessarily a subjective
one and there's nothing much
anyone can do about it. And
since movie criticism is an indi
vidual process, we often fail to
live up to our own criteria. Too
often, due to deadlines or
other pressures, we accept ef
forts from ourselves that are
less than our best. But that's
what art is all about — this con
tinual struggle to wrench the
best out of yourself. We'll
praise the people who keep up
the fight, whether they be In
gmar Bergman or the lowliest
B-grade filmmaker, and rip the
people who don't give a damn,
whether they are the latest
Academy Award-winners or
our best friends.
In conclusion, lay, thank you
for your letter. We love discus
sion and controversy. Love us,
disagree with us, hate us, any
thing; just don't be passive or
apathetic. If you don't give a
damn, it sure ain't worth much.
Again, thanks.

Daily film reviewer

As hard as this may be for
you to believe, jay, the people
who write the Daily film re-
movies. But because
we do like them, we are also
inclined to treat them seri
ously. It is not our job to tell
people to stay away from a
movie. The Goodbye Girl re
view, for example, succeeded
in making you formulate
reasons for liking the film, and
on that level it was successful.
The Daily, like the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and The New
Yorker magazine, makes no
claims that its reviews are ob
jective. A "review" implies that
it has been written by a re
viewer, and reviewers, by
necessity, form opinions. This
is why each Daily review bears
the name of the person who
wrote it. Whenyou accuse our
reviews of being "unobjec
tive," it appears that you be
lieve that an "objective" view
point can ever exist about an
artform as complex as film.
The safest way out would be
to merely print plot outlines
without making any judg
ments about whether a film is
"good" or "bad." You ques
tion whether we were correct
in giving The Goodbye Girl two
stars; yet you are not question
ing, I am forced to assume,
whether we are correct in giv
ing stars at all. There would
have been no objection had we
wreathed this film with four
stars — which would have

been every bit as subjective as
the review we did give.
You assert that the person
who reviewed this film "de
viated from the general opin
ion of those who really know
what makes a film good or
bad." I would assert that The
Goodbye Girl, like any film,
partook of a healthy mix of
opinion in the national reviews
it received; I would also assert
that there were those in your
audience who did not leave
feeling "bubbly good." It is
important to me and my col
leagues that our reviews take
an active stance on a film rather
than a passive, unquestioning
one. We try to make them in
quisitive and thought
provoking; we do not try to
make them barometers of
taste.
Our "judgments" of any
film's worth are, almost by de
finition, opinionated, but they
are not written in a vacuum.
Each reviewer makes a serious
effort to make a logical, cohe
rent statement about what he
feels are a film's strengths and
weaknesses when compared
to the medium and its
capabilities. We recognize
your right to disagree with our
opinions. At the same time we
will defend our right to try to
evaluate something as impor
tant and potentially magical as
a movie.

Since Jay's letter asks very
hard questions that do need to
be answered, we have decided
to reply to his letter with re
sponses that are lengthier than
the usual staff replies to letters
to the Editor. Hopefully, this
will help to make some of our
positions regarding movies
more understandable.
lay:
In a perverse way, we ap
preciateyourattackon ourcrit
ical virility— it indicates, to our
great relief, that someone is
paying attention. And whether
or not you meant it, we enjoy
being said to have "aesthetics"
— it's quite a change from what
we're used to hearing from
people with whom we differ.
But despite all that, we think
you've missed the point. What
we're out to do is to get people
to look at movies in an active
way — to turn their emotions
on, and by so doing get them to
develop a new basis for making
their movie judgments.
A statement of our "aesthe
tics" will probably fail to be a
complete (or regrettably, a
satisfactory) one. The danger
here for critics is that, in laying

out their standards, they trap
themselves in rigid theories
that often lead them to false
and contorted views. Movies
that critics may love sometimes
won't fit their theories, and too
often they will deny their emo
tions and accept their intellec
tual theorizing.
Thus our "aesthetics" are
necessarily eclectic in nature,
and the terms perhaps too
broad and too general. But
here goes. As critics, we try to
relate our thoughts and feel
ings about everything that
could possibly pertain to the
movie we are watching.
Because we turn our emo
tions on in watching a movie,
we look to see if the primary
forces behind the film,
whether they be the screenwri
ter, the producer, or, and this
is more often the case, the di
rector, have exploited their ta
lents to the fullest or whether
they have let themselves fake
their way through. The best
movies are made by people
who go all the way, who take
their talent to the limit, who
tackle old problems in new and
imaginative ways or who sim
ply (and it isn't simple) con
struct completely new view
points.
When a movie and its makers
don't do this, we are prone to
use adjectives like "clinical"
and "turn-off" because that's
the way we feel. We feel sold
out. Why should we try to go all
the way as movie critics when
the movie and the people who

made it haven't pushed them
selves? When a movie is a rehash
of one-liners like The Goodbye
Girl or a pretentious and half
hearted attempt at a "film
about women" like The Turn
ing Point, we feel compelled to
attack them, because if we
don't, we deny our emotions,
and that's precisely what we
want to avoid.
This sense of being turned
off is necessarily a subjective
one and there's nothing much
anyone can do about it. And
since movie criticism is an indi
vidual process, we often fail to
live up to our own criteria. Too
often, due to deadlines or
other pressures, we accept ef
forts from ourselves that are
less than our best. But that's
what art is all about — this con
tinual struggle to wrench the
best out of yourself. We'll
praise the people who keep up
the fight, whether they be In
gmar Bergman or the lowliest
B-grade filmmaker, and rip the
people who don't give a damn,
whether they are the latest
Academy Award-winners or
our best friends.
In conclusion, lay, thank you
for your letter. We love discus
sion and controversy. Love us,
disagree with us, hate us, any
thing; just don't be passive or
apathetic. If you don't give a
damn, it sure ain't worth much.

Daily film reviewer

As hard as this may be for
you to believe, jay, the people
who write the Daily film re-
movies. But because
we do like them, we are also
inclined to treat them seri
ously. It is not our job to tell
people to stay away from a
movie. The Goodbye Girl re
view, for example, succeeded
in making you formulate
reasons for liking the film, and
on that level it was successful.
The Daily, like the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and The New
Yorker magazine, makes no
claims that its reviews are ob
jective. A "review" implies that
it has been written by a re
viewer, and reviewers, by
necessity, form opinions. This
is why each Daily review bears
the name of the person who
wrote it. Whenyou accuse our
reviews of being "unobjec
tive," it appears that you be
lieve that an "objective" view
point can ever exist about an
artform as complex as film.
The safest way out would be
to merely print plot outlines
without making any judg
ments about whether a film is
"good" or "bad." You ques
tion whether we were correct
in giving The Goodbye Girl two
stars; yet you are not question
ing, I am forced to assume,
whether we are correct in giv
ing stars at all. There would
have been no objection had we
wreathed this film with four
stars — which would have

been every bit as subjective as
the review we did give.
You assert that the person
who reviewed this film "de
viated from the general opin
ion of those who really know
what makes a film good or
bad." I would assert that The
Goodbye Girl, like any film,
partook of a healthy mix of
opinion in the national reviews
it received; I would also assert
that there were those in your
audience who did not leave
feeling "bubbly good." It is
important to me and my col
leagues that our reviews take
an active stance on a film rather
than a passive, unquestioning
one. We try to make them in
quisitive and thought
provoking; we do not try to
make them barometers of
taste.
Our "judgments" of any
film's worth are, almost by de
finition, opinionated, but they
are not written in a vacuum.
Each reviewer makes a serious
effort to make a logical, cohe
rent statement about what he
feels are a film's strengths and
weaknesses when compared
to the medium and its
capabilities. We recognize
your right to disagree with our
opinions. At the same time we
will defend our right to try to
evaluate something as impor
tant and potentially magical as
a movie.

This evening (Sunday, Nov.
19) they very nearly took the
advice you handed them in
Cinemascope on Friday and
carried it, along with their
books to the library, saving the
dollar and the two hours it
would cost to see The Good
bye Girl at the Sunday Flicks. I
believe it was the extreme
self-confidence with which
you branded Richard Dreyfuss'
Academy Award-winning per
formance "two-star," and the
apparent expertise from which
you drew to label Neil Simon's
approach to humor in this film
"clinical" and a "turn-off" that
was almost overwhelming
enough to save them from the
long lines outside of Memorial
Auditorium...but not quite.
Fortunately enough, the idea
of studying was so utterly unat
tractive that any diversion, no
matter how many rating stars
attached, would have drawn
them away from the carrels. It
was outside Mem Aud that
each found a near sell-out
crowd of other somewhat
selective, slightly sophisticated
film-going Stanford students
who were willing to endure
long rainy cues and two hours
of psychological manipulation
by Simon's "fair" comedy to be
able to devote a little more
Big-Game-Weekend time to
not learning anything. It was
inside Mem Aud that they were
delightedly surprised by a very,
very funny movie - enough so
that they laughed uncontrolla
bly, applauded loudly and fre

quently and left feeling bubbly
good (of course I speak only for
those who made all the noise).
And I am writing to propose
that your self-confidence is un
founded; that 'psuedo-'should
be plainly attached to the word
'expertise' to characterize your
tone; that, specifically, you
apply such adjectives as 'turn
off far too broadly; and most
importantly, that you owe it to
your readers to establish very
clearly how unobjective your
viewpoints really are, to outline
your personal criteria in rating
films and to dispel the miscon
ception which your tone has
thus far promoted through lack

on, and by so doing get them to
develop a new basis for making
their movie judgments.
A statement of our "aesthe
tics" will probably fail to be a
complete (or regrettably, a
satisfactory) one. The danger
here for critics is that, in laying

out their standards, they trap
themselves in rigid theories
that often lead them to false
and contorted views. Movies
that critics may love sometimes
won't fit their theories, and too
often they will deny their emo
tions and accept their intellec
tual theorizing.
Thus our "aesthetics" are
necessarily eclectic in nature,
and the terms perhaps too
broad and too general. But
here goes. As critics, we try to
relate our thoughts and feel
ings about everything that
could possibly pertain to the
movie we are watching.
Because we turn our emo
tions on in watching a movie,
we look to see if the primary
forces behind the film,
whether they be the screenwri
ter, the producer, or, and this
is more often the case, the di
rector, have exploited their ta
lents to the fullest or whether
they have let themselves fake
their way through. The best
movies are made by people
who go all the way, who take
their talent to the limit, who
tackle old problems in new and
imaginative ways or who sim
ply (and it isn't simple) con
struct completely new view
points.
When a movie and its makers
don't do this, we are prone to
use adjectives like "clinical"
and "turn-off" because that's
the way we feel. We feel sold
out. Why should we try to go all
the way as movie critics when
the movie and the people who

made it haven't pushed them
selves? When a movie is a rehash
of one-liners like The Goodbye
Girl or a pretentious and half
hearted attempt at a "film
about women" like The Turn
ing Point, we feel compelled to
attack them, because if we
don't, we deny our emotions,
and that's precisely what we
want to avoid.
This sense of being turned
off is necessarily a subjective
one and there's nothing much
anyone can do about it. And
since movie criticism is an indi
vidual process, we often fail to
live up to our own criteria. Too
often, due to deadlines or
other pressures, we accept ef
forts from ourselves that are
less than our best. But that's
what art is all about — this con
tinual struggle to wrench the
best out of yourself. We'll
praise the people who keep up
the fight, whether they be In
gmar Bergman or the lowliest
B-grade filmmaker, and rip the
people who don't give a damn,
whether they are the latest
Academy Award-winners or
our best friends.
In conclusion, lay, thank you
for your letter. We love discus
sion and controversy. Love us,
disagree with us, hate us, any
thing; just don't be passive or
apathetic. If you don't give a
damn, it sure ain't worth much.
Again, thanks.

Daily film reviewer

As hard as this may be for
you to believe, jay, the people
who write the Daily film re-
movies. But because
we do like them, we are also
inclined to treat them seri
ously. It is not our job to tell
people to stay away from a
movie. The Goodbye Girl re
view, for example, succeeded
in making you formulate
reasons for liking the film, and
on that level it was successful.
The Daily, like the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and The New
Yorker magazine, makes no
claims that its reviews are ob
jective. A "review" implies that
it has been written by a re
viewer, and reviewers, by
necessity, form opinions. This
is why each Daily review bears
the name of the person who
wrote it. Whenyou accuse our
reviews of being "unobjec
tive," it appears that you be
lieve that an "objective" view
point can ever exist about an
artform as complex as film.
The safest way out would be
to merely print plot outlines
without making any judg
ments about whether a film is
"good" or "bad." You ques
tion whether we were correct
in giving The Goodbye Girl two
stars; yet you are not question
ing, I am forced to assume,
whether we are correct in giv
ing stars at all. There would
have been no objection had we
wreathed this film with four
stars — which would have

been every bit as subjective as
the review we did give.
You assert that the person
who reviewed this film "de
viated from the general opin
ion of those who really know
what makes a film good or
bad." I would assert that The
Goodbye Girl, like any film,
partook of a healthy mix of
opinion in the national reviews
it received; I would also assert
that there were those in your
audience who did not leave
feeling "bubbly good." It is
important to me and my col
leagues that our reviews take
an active stance on a film rather
than a passive, unquestioning
one. We try to make them in
quisitive and thought
provoking; we do not try to
make them barometers of
taste.
Our "judgments" of any
film's worth are, almost by de
finition, opinionated, but they
are not written in a vacuum.
Each reviewer makes a serious
effort to make a logical, cohe
rent statement about what he
feels are a film's strengths and
weaknesses when compared
to the medium and its
capabilities. We recognize
your right to disagree with our
opinions. At the same time we
will defend our right to try to
evaluate something as impor
tant and potentially magical as
a movie.

Daily film reviewer
This evening (Sunday, Nov.
19) they very nearly took the
advice you handed them in
Cinemascope on Friday and
carried it, along with their
books to the library, saving the
dollar and the two hours it
would cost to see The Good
bye Girl at the Sunday Flicks. I
believe it was the extreme
self-confidence with which
you branded Richard Dreyfuss'
Academy Award-winning per
formance "two-star," and the
apparent expertise from which
you drew to label Neil Simon's
approach to humor in this film
"clinical" and a "turn-off" that
was almost overwhelming
enough to save them from the
long lines outside of Memorial
Auditorium...but not quite.
Fortunately enough, the idea
of studying was so utterly unat
tractive that any diversion, no
matter how many rating stars
attached, would have drawn
them away from the carrels. It
was outside Mem Aud that
each found a near sell-out
crowd of other somewhat
selective, slightly sophisticated
film-going Stanford students
who were willing to endure
long rainy cues and two hours
of psychological manipulation
by Simon's "fair" comedy to be
able to devote a little more
Big-Game-Weekend time to
not learning anything. It was
inside Mem Aud that they were
delightedly surprised by a very,
very funny movie - enough so
that they laughed uncontrolla
bly, applauded loudly and fre

quently and left feeling bubbly
good (of course I speak only for
those who made all the noise).
And I am writing to propose
that your self-confidence is un
founded; that 'psuedo-'should
be plainly attached to the word
'expertise' to characterize your
tone; that, specifically, you
apply such adjectives as 'turn
off far too broadly; and most
importantly, that you owe it to
your readers to establish very
clearly how unobjective your
viewpoints really are, to outline
your personal criteria in rating
films and to dispel the miscon
ception which your tone has
thus far promoted through lack
of qualification of terms that
yours (and that of your col
league, John Nielsen, who
boldly stamped one star next to
The Turning Point) is the last
word in film rating and criti
cism.
Obviously, I recognize that
you are only offering your opin
ions and, quality in film or in
any art is not determined by
majority or crowd approval, but
when you deviate so. far from
the general opinion of those
who really know what makes a
film good or bad you should at
least be held responsible to
elaborate on and qualify your
judgements, especially in the
absence of a representation of
other well founded view
points. I do not believe you
have been so responsible.
I am no expert, I am not cer
tain of these opinions which I
here express, and criticizing

critics places one in a very vul
nerable position. Yet I hope
this letter and responses to it
are printed. To the editors, I
pose, "What is the role of
aesthetic criticism, and are
your reviewers fairly assuming
that role?"

attack them, because if we
don't, we deny our emotions,
and that's precisely what we
want to avoid.
This sense of being turned
off is necessarily a subjective
one and there's nothing much
anyone can do about it. And
since movie criticism is an indi
vidual process, we often fail to
live up to our own criteria. Too
often, due to deadlines or
other pressures, we accept ef
forts from ourselves that are
less than our best. But that's
what art is all about — this con
tinual struggle to wrench the
best out of yourself. We'll
praise the people who keep up
the fight, whether they be In
gmar Bergman or the lowliest
B-grade filmmaker, and rip the
people who don't give a damn,
whether they are the latest
Academy Award-winners or
our best friends.
In conclusion, lay, thank you
for your letter. We love discus
sion and controversy. Love us,
disagree with us, hate us, any
thing; just don't be passive or
apathetic. If you don't give a
damn, it sure ain't worth much.
Again, thanks.

Daily film reviewer

As hard as this may be for
you to believe, jay, the people
who write the Daily film re-
movies. But because
we do like them, we are also
inclined to treat them seri
ously. It is not our job to tell
people to stay away from a
movie. The Goodbye Girl re
view, for example, succeeded
in making you formulate
reasons for liking the film, and
on that level it was successful.
The Daily, like the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and The New
Yorker magazine, makes no
claims that its reviews are ob
jective. A "review" implies that
it has been written by a re
viewer, and reviewers, by
necessity, form opinions. This
is why each Daily review bears
the name of the person who
wrote it. Whenyou accuse our
reviews of being "unobjec
tive," it appears that you be
lieve that an "objective" view
point can ever exist about an
artform as complex as film.
The safest way out would be
to merely print plot outlines
without making any judg
ments about whether a film is
"good" or "bad." You ques
tion whether we were correct
in giving The Goodbye Girl two
stars; yet you are not question
ing, I am forced to assume,
whether we are correct in giv
ing stars at all. There would
have been no objection had we
wreathed this film with four
stars — which would have

been every bit as subjective as
the review we did give.
You assert that the person
who reviewed this film "de
viated from the general opin
ion of those who really know
what makes a film good or
bad." I would assert that The
Goodbye Girl, like any film,
partook of a healthy mix of
opinion in the national reviews
it received; I would also assert
that there were those in your
audience who did not leave
feeling "bubbly good." It is
important to me and my col
leagues that our reviews take
an active stance on a film rather
than a passive, unquestioning
one. We try to make them in
quisitive and thought
provoking; we do not try to
make them barometers of
taste.
Our "judgments" of any
film's worth are, almost by de
finition, opinionated, but they
are not written in a vacuum.
Each reviewer makes a serious
effort to make a logical, cohe
rent statement about what he
feels are a film's strengths and
weaknesses when compared
to the medium and its
capabilities. We recognize
your right to disagree with our
opinions. At the same time we
will defend our right to try to
evaluate something as impor
tant and potentially magical as
a movie.

Daily film reviewer
This evening (Sunday, Nov.
19) they very nearly took the
advice you handed them in
Cinemascope on Friday and
carried it, along with their
books to the library, saving the
dollar and the two hours it
would cost to see The Good
bye Girl at the Sunday Flicks. I
believe it was the extreme
self-confidence with which
you branded Richard Dreyfuss'
Academy Award-winning per
formance "two-star," and the
apparent expertise from which
you drew to label Neil Simon's
approach to humor in this film
"clinical" and a "turn-off" that
was almost overwhelming
enough to save them from the
long lines outside of Memorial
Auditorium...but not quite.
Fortunately enough, the idea
of studying was so utterly unat
tractive that any diversion, no
matter how many rating stars
attached, would have drawn
them away from the carrels. It
was outside Mem Aud that
each found a near sell-out
crowd of other somewhat
selective, slightly sophisticated
film-going Stanford students
who were willing to endure
long rainy cues and two hours
of psychological manipulation
by Simon's "fair" comedy to be
able to devote a little more
Big-Game-Weekend time to
not learning anything. It was
inside Mem Aud that they were
delightedly surprised by a very,
very funny movie - enough so
that they laughed uncontrolla
bly, applauded loudly and fre

quently and left feeling bubbly
good (of course I speak only for
those who made all the noise).
And I am writing to propose
that your self-confidence is un
founded; that 'psuedo-'should
be plainly attached to the word
'expertise' to characterize your
tone; that, specifically, you
apply such adjectives as 'turn
off far too broadly; and most
importantly, that you owe it to
your readers to establish very
clearly how unobjective your
viewpoints really are, to outline
your personal criteria in rating
films and to dispel the miscon
ception which your tone has
thus far promoted through lack
of qualification of terms that
yours (and that of your col
league, John Nielsen, who
boldly stamped one star next to
The Turning Point) is the last
word in film rating and criti
cism.
Obviously, I recognize that
you are only offering your opin
ions and, quality in film or in
any art is not determined by
majority or crowd approval, but
when you deviate so. far from
the general opinion of those
who really know what makes a
film good or bad you should at
least be held responsible to
elaborate on and qualify your
judgements, especially in the
absence of a representation of
other well founded view
points. I do not believe you
have been so responsible.
I am no expert, I am not cer
tain of these opinions which I
here express, and criticizing

critics places one in a very vul
nerable position. Yet I hope
this letter and responses to it
are printed. To the editors, I
pose, "What is the role of
aesthetic criticism, and are
your reviewers fairly assuming
that role?"
lay Roach
Manager, ASSU Sunday Flicks

Since Jay's letter asks very
hard questions that do need to
be answered, we have decided
to reply to his letter with re
sponses that are lengthier than
the usual staff replies to letters
to the Editor. Hopefully, this
will help to make some of our
positions regarding movies
more understandable.
lay:
In a perverse way, we ap
preciateyourattackon ourcrit
ical virility— it indicates, to our
great relief, that someone is
paying attention. And whether
or not you meant it, we enjoy
being said to have "aesthetics"
— it's quite a change from what
we're used to hearing from
people with whom we differ.
But despite all that, we think
you've missed the point. What
we're out to do is to get people
to look at movies in an active
way — to turn their emotions
on, and by so doing get them to
develop a new basis for making
their movie judgments.
A statement of our "aesthe
tics" will probably fail to be a
complete (or regrettably, a
satisfactory) one. The danger
here for critics is that, in laying

out their standards, they trap
themselves in rigid theories
that often lead them to false
and contorted views. Movies
that critics may love sometimes
won't fit their theories, and too
often they will deny their emo
tions and accept their intellec
tual theorizing.
Thus our "aesthetics" are
necessarily eclectic in nature,
and the terms perhaps too
broad and too general. But
here goes. As critics, we try to
relate our thoughts and feel
ings about everything that
could possibly pertain to the
movie we are watching.
Because we turn our emo
tions on in watching a movie,
we look to see if the primary
forces behind the film,
whether they be the screenwri
ter, the producer, or, and this
is more often the case, the di
rector, have exploited their ta
lents to the fullest or whether
they have let themselves fake
their way through. The best
movies are made by people
who go all the way, who take
their talent to the limit, who
tackle old problems in new and
imaginative ways or who sim
ply (and it isn't simple) con
struct completely new view
points.
When a movie and its makers
don't do this, we are prone to
use adjectives like "clinical"
and "turn-off" because that's
the way we feel. We feel sold
out. Why should we try to go all
the way as movie critics when
the movie and the people who

made it haven't pushed them
selves? When a movie is a rehash
of one-liners like The Goodbye
Girl or a pretentious and half
hearted attempt at a "film
about women" like The Turn
ing Point, we feel compelled to
attack them, because if we
don't, we deny our emotions,
and that's precisely what we
want to avoid.

the name of the person who
wrote it. Whenyou accuse our
reviews of being "unobjec
tive," it appears that you be
lieve that an "objective" view
point can ever exist about an
artform as complex as film.
The safest way out would be
to merely print plot outlines
without making any judg
ments about whether a film is
"good" or "bad." You ques
tion whether we were correct
in giving The Goodbye Girl two
stars; yet you are not question
ing, I am forced to assume,
whether we are correct in giv
ing stars at all. There would
have been no objection had we
wreathed this film with four
stars — which would have

been every bit as subjective as
the review we did give.
You assert that the person
who reviewed this film "de
viated from the general opin
ion of those who really know
what makes a film good or
bad." I would assert that The
Goodbye Girl, like any film,
partook of a healthy mix of
opinion in the national reviews
it received; I would also assert
that there were those in your
audience who did not leave
feeling "bubbly good." It is
important to me and my col
leagues that our reviews take
an active stance on a film rather
than a passive, unquestioning
one. We try to make them in
quisitive and thought
provoking; we do not try to
make them barometers of
taste.
Our "judgments" of any
film's worth are, almost by de
finition, opinionated, but they
are not written in a vacuum.
Each reviewer makes a serious
effort to make a logical, cohe
rent statement about what he
feels are a film's strengths and
weaknesses when compared
to the medium and its
capabilities. We recognize
your right to disagree with our
opinions. At the same time we
will defend our right to try to
evaluate something as impor
tant and potentially magical as
a movie.
