# Lyman criticizes senate for moving fast on Bhutto issue
## 
### GARY FURLONG 
President Richard Lyman last night
criticized the ASSU Senate for its re
solution aimed at bringing former
Pakistani prime minister Ali Bhutto
here as a guest professor. Lyman
spoke on KZSU's Campus Confer
ence, held at Faisan Lounge in Flor
ence Moore Hall.
"The senate would have been
well-advised not to rush into their
resolution," Lyman said.
The criticism came in the wake of
recent protests against the move,
primarily by Pakistani students here
who cited the political strong-arm
tactics and human rights violations
committed by Bhutto during his term
as prime minister.
Lyman, who originally wrote a let
ter to the senate supporting the
move, said he didn't feel that it
looked into the issue enough before
passing it.
"They rushed into it very fast," he
said.
Lyman, who had just returned
from New Mexico, also discussed
Carter's new economic proposals.
"Right now, we're trying to figure
out what they mean," Lyman said.
"No one seems to know yet."
He also commented on the "vol
untary" aspect of the new proposals.
"They claim them to be volun
tary," said Lyman, "but that's if you
want to keep your government con
tracts. It's not very voluntary."
Lyman added that the University
probably would not be greatly af
fected by the proposals.
Lyman also commented on the
large amounts of publicity that the
griffin received around Big Game

time. The griffin, he said, is not at all
close to being the school's new mas
cot.
"The only explicit pressure for the
griffin came from the petition signed
by over 200 athletes," he said.
"That's really not enough. The mas
cot should be a rallying point for the
students, and unless almost
everyone is behind it, there's no
point in having it."
During the conference, Lyman re
fused to comment on the rumor that
he is one of the finalists for the presi
dency of the prestigious Ford Found
ation.
"I have heard the rumors from var
ious sources," he said, "but I haven't
heard them from the most important

source, namely the Ford Foundation
itself. I won't speculate on some
thing like this until it really hap
pens."
The search for a replacement and
successor to Provost William Miller,
who will step down Jan. 1 of next
year, is going on now, Lyman said.
The committee should make four or
five recommendations to him by
January, according to Lyman.
"At that time, I will make the
choice from the recommendations,"
he said.
Lyman went on to answer ques
tions concerning sororities, the new
student dormitory being discussed
by the trustees and the lack of
adequate lighting on campus. .

want to keep your government con
tracts. It's not very voluntary."
Lyman added that the University
probably would not be greatly af
fected by the proposals.
Lyman also commented on the
large amounts of publicity that the
griffin received around Big Game

time. The griffin, he said, is not at all
close to being the school's new mas
cot.
"The only explicit pressure for the
griffin came from the petition signed
by over 200 athletes," he said.
"That's really not enough. The mas
cot should be a rallying point for the
students, and unless almost
everyone is behind it, there's no
point in having it."
During the conference, Lyman re
fused to comment on the rumor that
he is one of the finalists for the presi
dency of the prestigious Ford Found
ation.
"I have heard the rumors from var
ious sources," he said, "but I haven't
heard them from the most important

source, namely the Ford Foundation
itself. I won't speculate on some
thing like this until it really hap
pens."
The search for a replacement and
successor to Provost William Miller,
who will step down Jan. 1 of next
year, is going on now, Lyman said.
The committee should make four or
five recommendations to him by
January, according to Lyman.
"At that time, I will make the
choice from the recommendations,"
he said.
Lyman went on to answer ques
tions concerning sororities, the new
student dormitory being discussed
by the trustees and the lack of
adequate lighting on campus. .
President Richard Lyman last night
criticized the ASSU Senate for its re
solution aimed at bringing former
Pakistani prime minister Ali Bhutto
here as a guest professor. Lyman
spoke on KZSU's Campus Confer
ence, held at Faisan Lounge in Flor
ence Moore Hall.
"The senate would have been
well-advised not to rush into their
resolution," Lyman said.
The criticism came in the wake of
recent protests against the move,
primarily by Pakistani students here
who cited the political strong-arm
tactics and human rights violations
committed by Bhutto during his term
as prime minister.
Lyman, who originally wrote a let
ter to the senate supporting the
move, said he didn't feel that it
looked into the issue enough before
passing it.
"They rushed into it very fast," he
said.
Lyman, who had just returned
from New Mexico, also discussed
Carter's new economic proposals.
"Right now, we're trying to figure
out what they mean," Lyman said.
"No one seems to know yet."
He also commented on the "vol
untary" aspect of the new proposals.
"They claim them to be volun
tary," said Lyman, "but that's if you
want to keep your government con
tracts. It's not very voluntary."
Lyman added that the University
probably would not be greatly af
fected by the proposals.
