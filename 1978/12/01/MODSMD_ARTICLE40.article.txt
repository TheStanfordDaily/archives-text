ate many groups.
Then, when later asked if the nation's economic prob
lems meant Americans might have to accept a lower
standard of living, he said, "I see no reason fordespair at
all."
Carter also said the mass murder-suicides at Jones
town, Guyana, were atypical of American life. And the
president acknowledged he has been somewhat dis

peace treaty.
He said that "temporary setbacks" experienced in the

those that occurred during the Camp David meetings
that produced a framework for future accords.
