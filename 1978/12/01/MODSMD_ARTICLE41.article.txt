# Rape, employee treatment
## Group to attack women's issues 
### ALEEN ZIMBEROFF 
"We want to organize issues and
attark them one by one," said Mary
Morimoto yesterday at the first meet
ing of the Women's Task Force.
Morimoto, a Council of Presidents
(COP) member, spoke with five
other women about safety, cur
riculum, treatment of women
employees at the University and ef
forts to coordinate women's ac
tivities here.
"Women are consciously making
choices to risk their safety because
they are unaware of the danger, or
don't want to impose on someone,"
said Morimoto. She expressed "con
cern about the communication net
works that report rape," citing
specific problems which occur when
victims report informally to Cowell
Student Health Centerand not to the
police. With no official information
on record, publicity is difficult, she
said.
"There are specific dangers that
women don't know about," said
Morimoto. She suggested that the
task force study the situation in more

depth than the Rape Education Pro
ject (REP).
"They have a more narrow focus,
basically just educating the dorms,"
she said.
Morimoto mentioned the possibil
ity of implementing an escort ser
vice, similar to those at other college
campuses. Women could call when
they are traveling alone and an escort
would accompany them to their de
stination.
Libby Vernon, a student in the
SWOPSI course on Self-Defense for
Women, commented that women
could coordinate their travels and
leave in groups. "Two women are
safer than one. Women should sup
port other women," said Vernon.
"Women are trained to be passive.
Violence and self-defense are not a
part of the women's experience.
They have to overcome their inhibi
tions to defend themselves," she
explained. Vernon is petitioning to
have the self-defense class taught
every quarter.
Morimoto stressed that both men
and women need to be more aware

of potential dangers. "If men are
more concerned, maybe that will
legitimize women's fears," said
Nancy Wilson, a member of the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women (CEEW).
Wilson said CEEW is "interested in
investigation," but is becoming
more "action-oriented."
Currently, CEEW is "looking into
graduate women's perceptions
about being women in their depart
ments," said Wilson. The group will
study possible discrimination in the
graduate programs. This group, and
the Committee for Research on
Women (CROW) are the only official
University committees dedicated to
women's issues. The COP task force
will try to "fill the gap," said
Morimoto.
One student recommended lobby
ing for a major in women's studies.
Currently, there is no such program
in the curriculum.
Morimoto expressed interest in
finding a location for a women's
center. The Bridge provides one
room and the task force agreed that a
larger place would be more ideal. Di
rector of the center, Martine Porter,
is a student and Morimoto said she
feels "there is too much for one stu
dent to handle." Morimoto has
suggested to the University that it
hire a full-time director.
The task force will also study the
treatment of female employees here.
Possible discrimination will be inves
tigated.
The group will work with Leah Kap
lan, dean of women affairs, and any
other club interested in the area of
women's activities.

leave in groups. "Two women are
safer than one. Women should sup
port other women," said Vernon.
"Women are trained to be passive.
Violence and self-defense are not a
part of the women's experience.
They have to overcome their inhibi
tions to defend themselves," she
explained. Vernon is petitioning to
have the self-defense class taught
every quarter.
Morimoto stressed that both men
and women need to be more aware

of potential dangers. "If men are
more concerned, maybe that will
legitimize women's fears," said
Nancy Wilson, a member of the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women (CEEW).
Wilson said CEEW is "interested in
investigation," but is becoming
more "action-oriented."
Currently, CEEW is "looking into
graduate women's perceptions
about being women in their depart
ments," said Wilson. The group will
study possible discrimination in the
graduate programs. This group, and
the Committee for Research on
Women (CROW) are the only official
University committees dedicated to
women's issues. The COP task force
will try to "fill the gap," said
Morimoto.
One student recommended lobby
ing for a major in women's studies.
Currently, there is no such program
in the curriculum.
Morimoto expressed interest in
finding a location for a women's
center. The Bridge provides one
room and the task force agreed that a
larger place would be more ideal. Di
rector of the center, Martine Porter,
is a student and Morimoto said she
feels "there is too much for one stu
dent to handle." Morimoto has
suggested to the University that it
hire a full-time director.
The task force will also study the
treatment of female employees here.
Possible discrimination will be inves
tigated.
The group will work with Leah Kap
lan, dean of women affairs, and any
other club interested in the area of
women's activities.
"We want to organize issues and
attark them one by one," said Mary
Morimoto yesterday at the first meet
ing of the Women's Task Force.
Morimoto, a Council of Presidents
(COP) member, spoke with five
other women about safety, cur
riculum, treatment of women
employees at the University and ef
forts to coordinate women's ac
tivities here.
"Women are consciously making
choices to risk their safety because
they are unaware of the danger, or
don't want to impose on someone,"
said Morimoto. She expressed "con
cern about the communication net
works that report rape," citing
specific problems which occur when
victims report informally to Cowell
Student Health Centerand not to the
police. With no official information
on record, publicity is difficult, she
said.
"There are specific dangers that
women don't know about," said
Morimoto. She suggested that the
task force study the situation in more

depth than the Rape Education Pro
ject (REP).
"They have a more narrow focus,
basically just educating the dorms,"
she said.
Morimoto mentioned the possibil
ity of implementing an escort ser
vice, similar to those at other college
campuses. Women could call when
they are traveling alone and an escort
would accompany them to their de
stination.
Libby Vernon, a student in the
SWOPSI course on Self-Defense for
Women, commented that women
could coordinate their travels and
leave in groups. "Two women are
safer than one. Women should sup
port other women," said Vernon.
