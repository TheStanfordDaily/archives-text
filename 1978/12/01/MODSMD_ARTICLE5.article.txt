# Red Brigades reflect world trend
## 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
"The Red Brigades fit in with an international trend.
The situation in Italy is similar to the situations in other
countries, and therefore there is a similar trend," said
Phil Ansell, undergraduate panelist at last night's forum
on the Red Brigades and Terrorism.
He continued, "The Red Brigade's goal is to institute a
socialist state, something they haven't really defined.
They believe it's impossible to gradually achieve a
socialist state. Their belief is that the only way to achieve
a socialist state is to overthrow the present bourgeois
state."
The round table discussion held at La Casa Italiana
featured panelists Mark Mancall, director of overseas
studies; Alberto Martinelli, professor of political science
at the University of Milan; and Claudio Segre, professor
of Italian history from the University of Texas.
Also featured were Erick Terzuolo, doctoral candidate
in East European history; Phil Ansell, undergraduate;
and David Newell, doctoral candidate in Soviet history.
The program was mediated by John Ahern, assistant
professor in Italian.
'Violent age'
"This is a violent age that calls for violent action,"
Mancall said. He said the Red Brigades use a strategy of
intimidation that is international. Such tactics as kidnap
ping and assassination are utilized. "The Red Brigade is a
commentary on the nature of society," Mancall said.
Terzuolo said the symbolic use of terror is nothing
new. He said he differentiated between the Red Brigade
and communist terrorists.

"The Red Brigades have tended to strike at individu
als," Terzuolo said. He contrasted them with the Italian
Communists, who use tactics such as bombing trains.
He said this was a more general act of terrorism.
The panelists had difficulty in defining what a terrorist
is, agreeing that the definition changes as society
changes. "A terrorist can be one man's enemy and
another man's freedom fighter," Segre said.
End of spectrum
There are presently an estimated 800 members of the
Red Brigades, according to Ansell. He said that members
are generally of two classes. Either they are unemployed
intellectuals, or they are "underproletariats," who are
also unemployed. He said that their support cannot be
defined, but that they are at the end of a wide spectrum
of opinions, as opposed to being off on a tangent, dis
tantly removed from all other opinions.
The brigades members believe that by stopping the
actions of the government reformers, and increasing
repression, they will foster wider opposition and thus
achieve a major confrontation, according to Martinelli.
However, Martinelli added they underestimate Italy's
societal structure.
"They tend to make mistakes in terms of their ac
tions," he said. He commented that the strategy of the
Red Brigades was more successful at the beginning of
their organization.
"The Red Brigades failed because they had to kill
Moro," Mancall said.

are generally of two classes. Either they are unemployed
intellectuals, or they are "underproletariats," who are
also unemployed. He said that their support cannot be
defined, but that they are at the end of a wide spectrum
of opinions, as opposed to being off on a tangent, dis
tantly removed from all other opinions.
The brigades members believe that by stopping the
actions of the government reformers, and increasing
repression, they will foster wider opposition and thus
achieve a major confrontation, according to Martinelli.
However, Martinelli added they underestimate Italy's
societal structure.
"They tend to make mistakes in terms of their ac
tions," he said. He commented that the strategy of the
Red Brigades was more successful at the beginning of
their organization.
"The Red Brigades failed because they had to kill
Moro," Mancall said.
"The Red Brigades fit in with an international trend.
The situation in Italy is similar to the situations in other
countries, and therefore there is a similar trend," said
Phil Ansell, undergraduate panelist at last night's forum
on the Red Brigades and Terrorism.
He continued, "The Red Brigade's goal is to institute a
socialist state, something they haven't really defined.
They believe it's impossible to gradually achieve a
socialist state. Their belief is that the only way to achieve
a socialist state is to overthrow the present bourgeois
state."
The round table discussion held at La Casa Italiana
featured panelists Mark Mancall, director of overseas
studies; Alberto Martinelli, professor of political science
at the University of Milan; and Claudio Segre, professor
of Italian history from the University of Texas.
Also featured were Erick Terzuolo, doctoral candidate
in East European history; Phil Ansell, undergraduate;
and David Newell, doctoral candidate in Soviet history.
The program was mediated by John Ahern, assistant
professor in Italian.
'Violent age'
"This is a violent age that calls for violent action,"
Mancall said. He said the Red Brigades use a strategy of
intimidation that is international. Such tactics as kidnap
ping and assassination are utilized. "The Red Brigade is a
commentary on the nature of society," Mancall said.
Terzuolo said the symbolic use of terror is nothing
new. He said he differentiated between the Red Brigade
and communist terrorists.

"The Red Brigades have tended to strike at individu
als," Terzuolo said. He contrasted them with the Italian
Communists, who use tactics such as bombing trains.
He said this was a more general act of terrorism.
The panelists had difficulty in defining what a terrorist
is, agreeing that the definition changes as society
changes. "A terrorist can be one man's enemy and
another man's freedom fighter," Segre said.
End of spectrum
There are presently an estimated 800 members of the
Red Brigades, according to Ansell. He said that members
are generally of two classes. Either they are unemployed
intellectuals, or they are "underproletariats," who are
also unemployed. He said that their support cannot be
defined, but that they are at the end of a wide spectrum
of opinions, as opposed to being off on a tangent, dis
tantly removed from all other opinions.
The brigades members believe that by stopping the
actions of the government reformers, and increasing
repression, they will foster wider opposition and thus

tions," he said. He commented that the strategy of the
