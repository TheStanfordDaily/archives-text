# Experts describe space exploration

In the not-too-distant future, it
may be possible for students here
to push a few buttons on a
"wristwatch" and talk to a friend
skiing in the Swiss Alps, according
to ). Peter Vajk, a senior scientist
with Science Applications, Inc.
Vajk, who described the
watch-telephone and other pos
sible advancements in satellite
technology, was one of six speak
ers featured at a Space Settle
ments Symposium last night at
Kresge Auditorium, co-sponsored
by the SWOPSI course on space
colonization and the Stanford
Space Development Institute.
The symposium, which concen
trated on various issues dealing
with the development of space
habitats, asteroid mining and ex
traterrestrial intelligent life, was
moderated by Michael Simon, an
undergraduate in engineering
economic systems who partici
pated in the 1975 NASA summer
study here on the prospect of
space colonization.
The space colonization project
was initiated in 1969 by Princeton
physicist Gerard O'Neill who
came to the conclusion — after
studying the problem with his
class — that the surface of a planet
is not the best place for the
growth of a technological civiliza
tion.
The symposium was opened by
William Berry, the chief of the Life
Sciences Experiment Project at
NASA Ames Research Center in
Mountain View. Berry gave a brief
summary of the current status of
NASA's space shuttle, the Enter
prise.
According to Berry, the shuttle

will begin life science experi
ments in low earth orbit before
1980. The effects of zero-gravitv
will be tested on plants and ani
mals — particularly rats and mon
keys.
After a description of the work
ings of the shuttle, Berry gave the
podium over to Vajk, who de
scribed the advancements that
satellites have provided and may
yet provide the people of the
world.
Vajk described NASA's plans for
the construction of solar power
satellites, four miles wide by eight
miles long, which would be
placed into geosynchronous orbit
to collect solar energy, convert it
to low-density microwaves and
beam it down to a receiving an
tenna on the earth's surface.
"If we get into a power satellite
program (before the end of the
century), which seems 50-50 at
this point," he said, "then we will
be talking about several thousand
to several tens of thousands of
people living and working in
space, on a routine basis, by the
turn of the century."
'Space is neat'
Vajk concluded his talk by say
ing that the real reason for going
into space is because "there are a
lot of people in the world who
think that space is neat. We're ex
cited, we want to go, and we think
we've found some ways to pay our
way (solar satellites)."
Richard Johnson, the chief of
the biosystems division at NASA
Ames, spoke next, detailing the
history of the space colonization
project and describing the plans
for construction and utilization of
the settlements.
