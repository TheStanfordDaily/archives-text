# Political, cultural, social aspects
## Students form Middle East club 
### ALEEN ZIMBEROFF 
In response to the lack of
courses on the Mideast taught
here, two students have
formed a club whose purpose
is to study the region.
Bill Kemmeries and Eve Ro
dler both took a freshman
seminar last year entitled "The
Contemporary Arab World."
The club they have formed, the
Stanford Middle Eastern
Studies Club (SMESC), is "an
offshoot of the class I taught,"
explained adviser Pat Nabti.

"The main purpose of our
group is to objectively study
not only the political aspects of
the Middle East, but also the
cultural, historical and social
components," said Kem
meries, a sophomore majoring
in political science.
Mideast issues
"It is becoming almost inex
cusable not to have a firm grasp
on the various issues in the
Middle East which range from
the Arab-Israeli crises to the
break-neck speed of

technological development in
Saudi Arabia," added Rodler,
SMESC co-president.
SMESC sponsored a speaker
who discussed "Human Rights
and a Justifiable Peace in the
Middle East," earlier this
month. Edmund Hanauer,
executive director of an or
ganization called Search for
lusticeand Equality in Palestine
and Israel, spoke to an audi
ence of about 40. Rodler said
the attendance was "inspir
ing."

The University is "weak in
Middle Eastern curriculum,"
Kemmeries said. At present,
the only course offered is "The
Ottoman Empire." Kemmeries
said he hopes the group's ac
tivities will "exert some influ
ence on the professors to add
additional courses on the to
pic."
Hillel committee
The Hillel Israel Action
Committee "definitely sup
ports the SMESC in their search
for a Middle Eastern
specialist," said committee
chairperson Natalie Wasser
man.
Kemmeries and Rodler both
said the SMESC is designed to
be a non-biased club.
"We don't celebrate any
holidays," Kemmeries added
lightly.
The SMESC recognizes other
campus groups which focus on
the Middle East but want to
make a distinction between
political and cultural activity.
"We want to expose the
Stanford community to the
many different facets of Middle
Eastern life," Rodler said.
The club now has about 10
members.
