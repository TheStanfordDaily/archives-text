# DiBiaso reaps heady crop of Farm frosh

When USC came to town
two years ago, the Trojans
were at the bottom of the con
ference. Last year, the men of
Troy moved up to the hierarchy
of the Pacific-8. Why the trans
formation from the cellar to the
top?
Recruiting.
Coach Bob Boyd has in the
past two years recruited such
talents as Cliff Robinson and
Purvis Miller, who are already
established collegiate stars.
Boyd does not simply recruit
young players and place them
on the bench; he employs
them right away. His tactics
have paid off.
As Stanford opens the
Pacific-10 season tonight at
8:00 in Maples Pavilion, it faces
a strong USC squad laden with
talented freshmen and
sophomores. But USC will not
be the only team on the court
loaded with young talent.
After a fine year of recruiting
of his own, Stanford Coach
Dick Dißiaso has five talented
freshmen on the Cardinal
squad. Dißiaso looks forward
to their contributions as
juniors and seniors. But he
feels they can contribute to the
1978 Cardinal season as well.

Ten years ago, freshmen
were not given the opportunity
to compete on varsity teams.
When the NCAA changed the
rule to allow frosh to play with
the upperclassmen, coaches
were still hesitant to use them.
Many felt that an 18-year-old
needed a year of watching
from the bench combined with
limited playing time to adapt to
the college game. But when
that 18-year-old was the most
talented player on the team, it
became harder and harder to
keep him out of the line-up.
So, college coaches gradu
ally changed their thinking.
Today, an outstanding young
recruit almost expects to start
as a freshman.
Dißiaso wisely feels that if a

player is talented enough to
help the team, even as a
freshman, then let him play.
The coach has stretched this
philosophy to its fullest in the
case of Brian Welch.
Freshman Welch has started
all of the Cardinals' games this
season and figures to play a
large part in Stanford's battle
with USC tonight. An outstand
ing pure shooter at 6-foot-7, he
has already established himself
as an exciting and consistently
high scorer.

A high school Ail-American
from Idaho, Brian took Boise
Capital High to three consecu
tive state championships. Av
eraging 23.4 points and 13 re
bounds per game, he was
named Idaho's outstanding
player two years running.

Two other freshmen who
have aleady played important
roles in Stanford's early season
success are guard Doug Marty
and forward Orlando Ward.

, A power type forward, Ward
can hold his own under the

boards and also venture out
side with his fine shooting
touch.'Orlando has already
seen much playing time as the
third forward.
In his senior year at Los
Amigos High in Southern
California, Ward averaged 17.2
points and 123 rebounds per
game. The 6-foot-7 Ward was
named All-CIF 3-A and led his
team to the CIF quarter-finals.
Marty, at 6-foot-2, has al
ready shown off his offensive
and defensive wares in the
Cardinals' young season. His
quickness and hustle on de
fense compliment his ball
handling abilities on offense.
Doug can popfrom the outside
or penetrate the lane and dish
off to an open teammate, as he
did in the Cardinal victory over
Santa Barbara last Saturday.
An All-CIF selection out of
Long Beach, Marty should play
a big role in replacing senior
Wolfe Perry in the years to
come. As a senior in high
school Doug averaged 23.7
points and passed off for five
assists per game.

Six-foot-9 center Scott How
ard and 6-foot-4 swingman
Terry Smith round out Di-
Biaso's group of frosh recruits.
Though both have been vic
tims of early season injuries,
both should play a role in the
Cardinal's late season charge,
as well as in future campaigns.
Out with a cracked bone in
his foot, Howard neverthe
less should contribute greatly
later this season. Coach Di-
Biaso expects Howard to allow
starting center Tom Schmal
ried periods of rest over the
next two years and then move
into a starting role.
Out of North Hollywood
High, Howard averaged 16
points and 14 rebounds per
game in leading his team to the
3-A city finals.
Howard can play either in
side or at the high post. De
spite his size, Dißiaso may use
him at the high post to utilize
his fine outside touch and ex

cellent passing ability. Scott
led his high school team in as
sists while playing center.
The left-handed Smith has
the size of a small forward and
the quickness of a guard. Out
with a stress fracture in his
foot, Smith will contribute
good balbhandling capabilities
and defense to the Stanford
cause.
Playing center at University
High in West Los Angeles,
Smith averaged 18 points and
10 rebounds per game. He has
greatly improved his ball
handling capabilities, accord
ing to Dißiaso, a rhajor step in
his transition from the post to
the backcourt.
Not all of thesefreshmen will
receive as much playing time as
Welch, butthey will contribute
nonetheless. The first half of
Stanford's 85-73 win over Santa
Clara last Thursday ex
emplified Dißiaso's phil
osophy of a balanced at
tack.

With Santa Clara still in the
contest, Dißiaso employed
nine of his twelve players, in
cluding all three available
freshmen. Though Santa Clara
trailed by only five at halftime,
the Cardinals were rested and
out of personal foul trouble. In
the second half, they were able
to move out to a comfortable
lead.
Dißiaso has a relatively small
team which must depend on
hustle and positioning on de
fense. By shuffling his person
nel at both guard and forward,
the coach can keep a five man
squad of fresh players in the
game and out of foul trouble.
To maintain the "Dißiaso shuf
fle," the coach must utilize his
freshmen.
The freshmen crop can con
tribute off the court, also.
Stanford is a very emotional
team whicb depends upon
momentum. Against Santa
Clara, the players on the bench
repeatedly came to their feet i n
response to a key steal or bas
ket. And each time, the first


Doug Marty
one on his feet was the injured
Howard.
The presence of this talented
group of frosh has also pushed
the veterans to greater heights.
Even the most established of
Cardinal stars has had to fight
for a starting job this year.
DiBiaso does not use his


Orlando Ward
freshmen as liberally as Boyd
has. Stanford still has experience
down the stretch in Kimberly
Belton and Wolfe Perry.
But Welch, Marty, Ward,
Howard and Smith won't just
sit and watch tonight. They will
contribute this season.
And for the next four years.
