# McCrea's cagers expect big results

### RICH MARTINEZ 
Women's basketball and
Stanford's program, in particu
lar are rising fast and soon
will be soaring higher than
Julius Erving. While the Cards
finished second last season in
the NCAC (Northern California
Athletic Conference) with a
17-12 overall record, they went
through the season, for the
most part, unnoticed. Not tak
ing notice of the 1978-79 wo
men's team will be like not no
ticing an approaching locomo
tive while on the tracks. And
the Cards are definitely picking
up steam.

Stanford ran over Sac
ramento State, 85-49, and then
Nevada-Reno, 78-59, last week.
Third-year Head Coach Dotty
McCrea commented, "It was
really nice beating teams that
we had usually lost to in the
,past. Our program is progres
sing so rapidly that this year I
don't see why we can't take the
league and within the next
couple of years be handling the
nation's top teams. The only

way we'll lose is if we beat our
selves."
Coach McCrea has sub
stance with which to back her
claims about 17'8" of sub
stance, as she boasts the fruits
of her recruiting labors: Angie
Paccione, a s'B" guard from
New York; Jeanne Ruark, a 6'.
center from Alabama; and
Louise Smith, another 6'
center-forward from Los
Angeles.
Paccione was voted First
Team All-America, averaged 31
points and 16 rebounds per
game last year, and was gener
ally regarded as New York's
best eager.
Jeanne Ruark averaged 34
points per game and 17 re
bounds, while being named
the Alabama Player of the Year. -
Another 30-point averager,
Louise Smith was named 1978
Southern California 4-A Player
of the Year.
"Not only does our rapidly
progressing basketball prog
ram impress the girls," exp
lained Sue Rojcewicz, assistant

coach, a member of the 1976
silver medalist U.S. Olympic
basketball team, and McCrea's
recruiting partner, "I believe
Stanford itself is another great
attraction.

"These girls realize that
there aren't any pro ranks in
women's basketball and they
should get the best education
they possibly can. Ruark and
Paccione were heavily re
cruited by countless other
schools and they picked Stan
ford not only for its fine bas
ketball program but also be
cause they wanted to take part
in the pre-med program," Roj
cewicz said.

Coaches McCrea and Roj
cewicz direct women's basket
ball camps during the summer.
This is their golden opportun
ity to find new talent. "We see
almost 3000 girls a summer,"
said McCrea, "and we choose
the finest ones to recruit for
our program. Most of the girls
on our team went to those
camps."
Although the Cardinals have
some seasoned veterans and
budding young stars, their
game plan is still very much
team oriented.
"You may be able to win in
men's ball with one or two
stars," said Rojcewicz, "but in
the women's game you have to
have a very balanced, unselfish
team. There is far less one-on
one type play in our game and a
greater emphasis placed upon
fast breaking, sharp passing
and taking high percentage
shots.

"I think some of the girls'
natural limitations make the
game that much more team
oriented and exciting," Roj
cewicz said.
And so it seems that those
associated with the Stanford
women's basketball team have
good reason to be so optimis
tic. The older players are de
veloping into leaders while a
successful recruiting year has
landed new talent.

The team plays Montana
State tomorrow night in the
home opener.
"It used to be that all anyone
knew about women's basket
ball were Ann Meyers and
UCLA," McCrea said. "Well,
before too long we'll be men
tioned right up there with the
best of them."
One can see the future of
this team, and everything
McCrea and Rojcewicz have
built it up to over the past few
years. And the future is bright.

the women's game you have to
have a very balanced, unselfish
team. There is far less one-on
one type play in our game and a
greater emphasis placed upon
fast breaking, sharp passing
and taking high percentage
shots.

"I think some of the girls'
natural limitations make the
game that much more team
oriented and exciting," Roj
cewicz said.
And so it seems that those
associated with the Stanford
women's basketball team have
good reason to be so optimis
tic. The older players are de
veloping into leaders while a
successful recruiting year has
landed new talent.

The team plays Montana
State tomorrow night in the
home opener.
"It used to be that all anyone
knew about women's basket
ball were Ann Meyers and
UCLA," McCrea said. "Well,
before too long we'll be men
tioned right up there with the
best of them."
One can see the future of
this team, and everything
McCrea and Rojcewicz have
built it up to over the past few
years. And the future is bright.

Kathy Murphy (44) shows classic jump-shooting form during a game
against San Jose State last season. This year, Murphy has been joined
by a group of freshman recruits as good as any in the country: Angie
Paccione, Jeanne Ruark and Louise Smith.
Women's basketball and
Stanford's program, in particu
lar are rising fast and soon
will be soaring higher than
Julius Erving. While the Cards
finished second last season in
the NCAC (Northern California
Athletic Conference) with a
17-12 overall record, they went
through the season, for the
most part, unnoticed. Not tak
ing notice of the 1978-79 wo
men's team will be like not no
ticing an approaching locomo
tive while on the tracks. And
the Cards are definitely picking
up steam.

Stanford ran over Sac
ramento State, 85-49, and then
Nevada-Reno, 78-59, last week.
Third-year Head Coach Dotty
McCrea commented, "It was
really nice beating teams that
we had usually lost to in the
,past. Our program is progres
sing so rapidly that this year I
don't see why we can't take the
league and within the next
couple of years be handling the
nation's top teams. The only

way we'll lose is if we beat our
selves."
Coach McCrea has sub
stance with which to back her
claims about 17'8" of sub
stance, as she boasts the fruits
of her recruiting labors: Angie
Paccione, a s'B" guard from
New York; Jeanne Ruark, a 6'.
center from Alabama; and
Louise Smith, another 6'
center-forward from Los
Angeles.
Paccione was voted First
Team All-America, averaged 31
points and 16 rebounds per
game last year, and was gener
ally regarded as New York's
best eager.
Jeanne Ruark averaged 34
points per game and 17 re
bounds, while being named
the Alabama Player of the Year. -
Another 30-point averager,
Louise Smith was named 1978
Southern California 4-A Player
of the Year.
"Not only does our rapidly
progressing basketball prog
ram impress the girls," exp
lained Sue Rojcewicz, assistant

coach, a member of the 1976
silver medalist U.S. Olympic
basketball team, and McCrea's
recruiting partner, "I believe
Stanford itself is another great
attraction.

"These girls realize that
there aren't any pro ranks in
women's basketball and they
should get the best education
they possibly can. Ruark and
Paccione were heavily re
cruited by countless other
schools and they picked Stan
ford not only for its fine bas
ketball program but also be
cause they wanted to take part
in the pre-med program," Roj
cewicz said.

Coaches McCrea and Roj
cewicz direct women's basket
ball camps during the summer.
This is their golden opportun
ity to find new talent. "We see
almost 3000 girls a summer,"
said McCrea, "and we choose
the finest ones to recruit for
our program. Most of the girls
on our team went to those
camps."
Although the Cardinals have
some seasoned veterans and
budding young stars, their
game plan is still very much
team oriented.
"You may be able to win in
men's ball with one or two
stars," said Rojcewicz, "but in
the women's game you have to
have a very balanced, unselfish
team. There is far less one-on
