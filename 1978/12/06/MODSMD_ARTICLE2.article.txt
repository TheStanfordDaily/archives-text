# Pac-10 tipoff
## 3-1 Cards meet powerful USC 
### CHRIS HAFT 
The "second season" begins
tonight at Maples Pavilion for
Stanford and USC as the Car
dinals host the nationally
ranked No. 11 Trojans in an
unusually early Pacific-10 Con
ference basketball opener.
I n past years when the Pac-10
was the Pac-8, conference
play did not commence until
January, by which time each
team had sufficiently evaluated
its personnel and established
its strategy with a dozen or so
games against nonco.nference
opponents.
However, this season's in
clusion of Arizona and Arizona
State into the league forced the
schedule makers to prepare
unorthodox and undesirable
dates: unorthodox in that
some teams have to battle con
ference foes after playing just a
few games; undesirable be
cause Stanford and California
face UCLA at home during
Christmas vacation while most
students are far away.
Yet tonight's coaches pos
sess decidedly neutral opin
ions concerning the premature
start, particularly USC's Bob
Boyd. "I don't know if I should
feel good or bad it doesn't
make any difference," he said.
"There's nothing we can do
about it, so there's
other than to feel good," said
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. "It's
different in that we haven't had
the chance to play our young
guys long enough."
Two of those "young guys,"
freshman Doug Marty and Or
lando Ward, significantly

helped the Cards win their
most recent encounter, a 74-63
decision over UC-Santa Bar
bara Saturday night that lifted
Stanford's record to 3-1.
Marty played 32 minutes at
guard as a replacement for
team captain Paul Giovacchini,
who pulled his left hamstring
during warmups, and the
6-foot-2 rookie came through
with 11 points and six assists.
The 6-foot-7 Ward, already a
Maples favorite, grabbed a
game-high 11 rebounds in just
19 minutes.
The most impressive first
year man, of course, is starting
forward Brian Welch. Averag
ing 14.3 points and 8.8 re
bounds an outing while shoot
ing 53 percent from the floor,
Welch has gained Boyd's re
spect.
"He's a nice perimeter shoo
ter we'll have to minimize
his effectiveness," said the
USC mentor.
"Welch is playing like an ex
perienced veteran," Dißiaso
said. "He's very mature and
fundamentally sound."
Dißiaso has also been
pleased by the "consistency"
of his three returning regulars:
Wolfe Perry, Kimberly Belton
and Giovacchini.
Perry, the senior guard with
the wheelin' and dealin'
moves, leads the Cards with a
22.0 scoring average on 37-
for-75 (49.3 percent) shooting.
He fired a career-high 28
through the hoop against Santa
Barbara.
"Wolfe is playing very much
under control this year," Di-

Biaso commented. "We've
tried to emphasize to him that
he can sometimes do more by
doing less. Now he's using his
one-on-one moves to his ad
vantage and taking the shots
we work on in practice."
While Perry roams the
perimeters, Belton controls
the inside area. The 6-foot-7
junior forward continues to be
the scourge of the Stanford
front line, scoring 15.3 points
and grabbing a team-leading
9.8 rebounds a game.
Belton's power borders on
the amazing. On one occasion
last Thursday against Santa
Clara, for example, he drove

baseline and scored over both
6-foot-8 Kurt Rambis and
6-foot-10 Mark McNamara.
A major reason behind the
Card duo's strong scoring is
playmaker Giovacchini, who
has dished off 8.3 assists a
game. At this writing, it was felt
Giovacchini's hamstring would
be sufficiently healed for him
to see action.
Ever-improving Tom
Schmalzried, averaging 8.8
points and 6.5 rebounds a con
test, will be at center for Stan
ford. Schmalzried's top per
formance of the young season
came against Santa Clara,
when the 6-foot-11 junior can
ned 19 points and ripped 13 re
bounds.
"It will take a number of
things to beat Stanford," Boyd
said. "We will have to execute
offensively and pick up on
their different defenses. I
know they're good; now I have
to convince my- players of
that."
Nobody has to convince
Stanford or anybody else,
for that matter that Trojan
center Cliff Robinson is one of
the best in the country at his
position.
The talented 6-foot-9
sophomore from Oakland has
led USC to victories over Hous
ton, 88-80, and Utah, 70-56, av
eraging 24.5 points and 13 re
bounds in the two games.
Sports Illustrated, which cal
led Robinson one of college
basketball's top 10 sopho
mores in its preview issue, re
warded him for his season
openingfeats with Player of the
Week honors.
As a freshman last year
Robinson was named to the
AII-Pac-8 and freshman All-
America teams while leading
the conference in scoring at a
18.4 clip.
/'We'll definitely have to
contain him," Dißiaso as
serted. ."Some say .he's the.best

center in the league."
Sophomores Purvis Miller
and Barry Brooks join Robin
son to round out the Trojans'
front line. Currently averaging
11.5 points a game, the 6-foot-7
Miller tallied 12.3-per outing a
year ago and is USC's "scor
ing" forward. Brooks, whom
Boyd called one of his most
improved players, is averaging
6.0 points a game.
Freshmen Maurice Williams,
and Leonel Marquetti from bas
ketball factory Verbum Dei
High in Los Angeles and junior
Doug Widtfeldt back up Miller
and Brooks at forward, giving
the Trojans excellent depth.
USC has three fine guards to
call on, though the two that
start, will probably be Steve
Smith and Dean Jones.
Smith, a 6-foot-2 senior, is
averaging 12.0 points a game.
His 5-foot-10 backcourt mate,
Jones was one of Boyd's re
cruiting prizes.
The California JC Player
the Year at Bakersfield last sea
son, Jones is averaging 5.5
points a game, but his true
value lies elsewhere.
"Jones gives us something
we really need: playmaking
and advancing the ball on an
extended defense," Boyd said.
"He's the best thing I've ever
seen from Bakersfield."
The third guard is 6-foot-3
junior Don Carfino, a 1977
second-team AII-Pac-8 selec
tion whose name recalls un
pleasant memories to Stanford
fans. Last year at Maples Car
fino's 35-foot jumper at the
buzzer won it for the Trojans
70-68.
It is that kind of game that
the Cards will try to avoid to
night. A victory would distin
guish them from last year's
hard-luck group which lost
seven games by three points or
less, and establish them as a
solid ballciub. A loss?.Utn.rDErb -

(25) await the rebound. Welch, the freshman forward from Boise, Idaho, is shooting 52 percent on the year,
mainly connecting on shots like the one above.
