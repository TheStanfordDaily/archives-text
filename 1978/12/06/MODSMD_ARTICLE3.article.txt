# Captain Giovacchini demands the best

### MIKE O'NEAL 
"Paul, you've gotten off to a
pretty good start this season at
3-1 and. . ."
"Well, I don't know - we
could be 4-0."
"Well, 3-I's not bad. It's bet
ter than 1-3."
"Yeah, but we should be
4-0."

, Paul Giovacchini is a com
petitor. He won't accept losing
no matter how the game is
played and he is representative
of the tough, scrappy team that
will be lighting up Maples
Pavillion this season.
The senior captain out of Salt
Lake City's Judge Memorial
high is used to leading he
was Utah's most valubale
player in 1975, not to mention
receiving All-America honors
and the position of valedicto
rian in his senior year. But he
has been somewhat frustrated
at Stanford, mainly because his
teams have been losing.
"It's been frustrating to see

the minimal success the team
has been having," Paul said.
But he added, "It's been fun to
watch the program grow."
Paul played some in his
freshman year and realized
how different college ball was
from his more comfortable
high-school style. He injured
his knee that year and had to
have it rebuilt. During his sec
ond and third years he saw
more action, though Head
Coach Dick Dißiaso said:

"Paul had to undergo a
change in his style those two
years. He had to find out what
he could and couldn't do after
the injury and had to learn to
play with that knowledge."
It's a tribute to the type of
athlete Giovacchini is that this
year he has come back at full
potential to take over the cap
tain's duties and to start at
guard.
In that starting role, the
senior guard has shined.
Giovacchini is averaging 9.0
points per game and like a true

on-the-court leader, is dishing
out 8.3 assists per game. He
was hampered by a pulled
hamstring and thus did not
play against UCSB, but will
start this evening.
Even in this, his best start in
his four years on the Farm,
Giovacchini is not completely
satisfied with his performance.
"Whenever you lose, you
can find things in your play that
you could have done better
and when you win you some
times overlook those things. I
might not be assertive enough
one night or I might have a
mental lapse on the court, but
whatever it is, these things are
inexcuseable to me," Giovac
chini said.
Talking to Paul one realizes
that he is a very "mental"
player and that's the thing that
makes him so critical of his
own play. It's also what gives
him his strong feelings about
the team. When talking about
the cage squad he is the eternal
optimist.
"The program's made great
strides during the years that
I've been here," he said em
phatically, "and I'm optimistic
about this season."
He's wrapped up in the team
in away a captain should be
and to him it's success is his
success not the other way
around. To Paul, success is the
only thing to think about for
champions and his almost
cliched desire has led Dißiaso
to say:

"Paul's got leadership qual
ities. He keeps the ball moving
and in many ways he's the
pulse of the team on the court.
I'm confident in him and he's
gained confidence in himself."
He's confident he can lead
the team all right, but when
asked if he feels that he's im
proved, Giovacchini talks team
improvement. When asked
about his goals at Stanford, he
talks mostly about the team
goals. He represents the team
and is a major part of it such
is a leader.
Giovacchini is an economics
major carrying a B average
overall. One of the things he
feels is so special about the
Stanford experience as an
athlete is the parallels he can
find here between the rigorous

academics and Division I athle
tics.
"College ball is an experi
ence in itself," Giovacchini
said, "but Stanford makes it
even special. To get the stiffest
competition in both the clas
sroom and in basketball is
pretty unique."
He likes the program all the
way around. It can be frustrat
ing for a competitor like
Giovacchini when the program
fails, but it is even more satisfy
ing when the student-athlete in
a program such as Stanford's
plays a team like UCLA and
wins. He's been impressed this
year with the cohesiveness of

the young team (the squad has
four freshmen and five
sophomores).
"People don't look too
highly at us because we're not
proven; but I don't believe it,"
Giovacchini said. And he has
no reason to believe it because
the Cards at 3-1 look very deep
and quite good.
Paul Giovacchini is a com
petitor but more importantly
he's a team competitor. He
leads the cagers with an Ail-
American boy vigor that seems
to be pushing the team into a
very promising season. "It's a
mental thing" he said, and he
may be right.
