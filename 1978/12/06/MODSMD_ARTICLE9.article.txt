# Welch is a big step forward

### ROBERT REED 
Welch. Brian Welch. Re
member that name. That won't
be too much trouble, since
you'll be hearing it a lot over
the next four years.
Welch, a 6-7, 200 lb.,
freshman forward for the
Cards, has been more than im
pressive in his first four outings
this year. Having wasted no
time in moving into the starting
frontline alongside Kimberly
Belton and 6-11 center Tom
Schmalzried, Welch has estab
lished himself as one of the key
figures in the Stanford offense,
having pumped in 13 in the
opener against Cal Poly-
Pomona, 12 against San Jose
St., 20 against Santa Clara, and
12 in the last game against UC-
Santa Barbara.
Welch's performance has
come not only as a pleasant
surprise to Cardinal rooters,
but to Head Coach Dick Di-
Biaso as well.
Though Welch was certainly
outstanding in high school,
and indeed, a dominating
force there, Dißiaso didn't
realize Welch would play such
an important role so soon. He
had hoped that, at best, Welch
would provide a push for some
of the other players.
"Some players help by com
ing in and starting. Some
players help by coming in and
competing (for a starting spot).
We thought Brian would be
able to help us in this (the lat
ter) way," Dißiaso said.
But Welch proved he could
do the job, even as a freshman.
Was Dißiaso apprehensive
about starting a freshman?
"No, I've started freshmen
before. Wofle Perry, Kim Bel
ton, Mark Pitchford, Jeff Ryan.
With freshmen, you just have
to have a little more patience,"
Dißiaso said. "Freshmen are
going to make a certain
number of mistakes."
Welch will be excused if he's
made less than most freshmen.
He had a good training.
"Brian is fundamentally

sound," said Dißiaso, "He
played for an excellent high
school coach, Charlie Henry,
at Capitol High in Boise,
Idaho."

Charlie Henry, during
Welch's stay at Capitol,
coached his team to three
straight state championships
and a three-year record of 72-4,
including a 25-0 season last
year. Welch, in leading this
team, averaged 23.4 points and
13 rebounds per game, hitting
58 percent from the floor (65
percent during league play)
and 83 percent from the line.
The handsome freshman
scored 45 points in his top high
school game. Because of all
this, he was named the out
standing player in the state his
junior and senior years, while
becoming a prep All-American,
and being acclaimedone of the
nation's top 50 players by Bas
ketball Weekly.
But wait a minute! This is all
high school stuff. We're sup
posed to to be talking about
big time college basketball.
And there's a world of a differ
ence between the two.
College basketball is a physi
cal game, a game of contact
among ten players of generally
the same caliber of play. In
order to win, you've got to be
on your toes, running faster
and rebounding harder than
you ever had to in high school.
Welch is no longer a giant
among many. Now, at least
with respect to his size and
strength, he's just one of the
guys. In order to compete, he
has to do things now that he's
never had to do before.
Welch said that in college
basketball, "You have to be a
lot quicker. You can't slack off.
You have to have total con
centration all the time. That's
the hardest adjustment.
There's so much more inten
sity in college."
Did this intensity make this
freshman a little nervous when
he first learned he was going to
start?

"I didn't really get nerv
ous...! was really excited,"
Welch said. Afterwards he
explained that what might have
eased his nervousness a bit was
the fact that he had before
been in a situation similar to
the one he is facing now.
Welch explained that in his
sophomore year in high school
he transferred to a new school,
and though nobody knew who
he was or what he could do, he
won the starting assignment
and then proved what he could
do. Welch is doing that now at
Stanford.
Welch, a mustachioed
brunet, is a quiet, mannerly
kind of guy, who has been de
scribed by Dißiaso as both a
"good person" and a "mature
individual." While his hobbies
include both tennis and golf,
the lanky 18-year-old is appa
rently a fanatic about ham
radio operating.
Besides basketball, Welch
also played baseball in high
school, while his older brother
Jim played football at the Uni
versity of Idaho. Welch is hop
ing, at the moment, to major in
economics while on the Farm.
Considered now to be the
outstanding pure shooter on
the Cardinal squad, the
freshman last year was one of
the most highly-recruited
frontline players in the West.
Welch received some 60 in
quiries and was recruited heav
ily by some highly-touted bas
ketball powers, among them
nationally-ranked Kentucky.
Why did he choose Stan
ford?
"Both the academic program
and the basketball program,"
responded the gifted forward.
Welch said also that he "liked
the idea of playing in the Pac-10
Conference."
Welch also made a strong
point of mentioning that the
players themselves also made
the selection process much
easier.
"All the players were nice
guys," said Welch. "You have

to be able to get along with the
other players, and I felt I could
with our guys."
Stanford also offered Welch
a good chance of playing.
"I wanted to go somewhere
where I thought I could play. I
didn't want to be sitting on the
bench; I thought I had a good
chance of playing at Stanford,"
Welch said. "I came down with
the idea of starting. That was
my goal. That's what I shot
for."
What goals has he set now
that he's won the starting as
signment?
"My goal right now is to do
my best to help the team win.
Every player has his role," said
the young forward, who
explained that his role called
for him to score, pass well, and
rebound. To feel that he is ful
filling his -role, Welch said that
he needs to sco re from 12 to 15
points and grab about 9 re
bounds each game.
"Teamwise, I hope to get to
the 20-win mark this season,"
said the forward, speaking of
yet another goal that may be
realized.

Considering that Welch is a
starting frontline player, just
how far the team gets may de
pend, at least in part, on how
well this freshman plays.
"Brian has a sense of court
awareness," said Dißiaso, exp
laining that Welch spaces him
self well away from the other
players and that the forward
knows how to get open to do
what he does best hit the
outside jumper.
This is a perfect complement
forthe other forward, Kimberly
Belton, who is well-known for
his tough, power game inside,
thus giving Stanford its best
"Mr. Inside Mr. Outside"
duo at forward in some years.
Dißiaso said that the
freshman's primary weakness
right now is "learning to play."
"He's not a complete player.
He has to improve his defense,
and some additional offensive
skills, and his rebounding,"
Dißiaso said.
Welch has a long way to go,
but so does the Card basketball
team. But maybe, just maybe,
they (Welch and the Cards) will
get there.

noted that Welch possesses the poise of an upperclassman in this, his
freshman season on the Farm.
