# Organ grievance ends in University's favor
## 
### GARY FURLONG 
The grievance case of Henry
Organ came to its administra
tive end this month, when a
Santa Clara County Superior
Court judge ruled that Stan
ford's grievance procedures
and policies were not legally
binding on the University.
Organ is associate director of
foundations in the General
Secretary Office (GSO) here.

News analysis

Organ's case began back in
the summer of 1977, when he
was working for the General
Projects Office of the GSO. At
that time, new Vice President
for Development joel Smith in
formed hint thai the General
Projects Office was being dis
solved.
In the ensuing organiza
tional shuffle, Organ ended up
reporting to a man who was
lateral to him on the organiza
tional chart, a change that he
felt was effectively a demotion
for him. He then filed a grie
vance.
President Richard Lyman
eventually ruled that Organ
was not demoted in any way,
and thus ruled against him.
Organ petitioned for an out
side hearing officer to Robert
Parker, head of the personnel
department. He was denied his
petition. He then took it to
court, and lost.
The implications of the case
are clear â€” the University is
not legally bound to internally
or externally review any case of
alleged unfairness on the part
of any University manager to
ward lower-level management.
"I've been interested in what
the implications are for the

people who will pursue grie
vances in the future," said Or
gan. "Basically, it means
everyone outside of union
contracts serves at the pleasure
of their supervisors."
"It doesn't encourage any
employee who feels grieved to
use the system."
Parker, however, doesn't
feel that the decision changes
anything.
"Employees should rely on
the fact that we take them (the
grievance procedures) seri
ously," Parker said. "It doesn't
change anything."
According to Parker, the
procedures are meant to be an
expression of commitment on
the part of the University, and
were never meant to be legally

binding. In the case where the
policy is not explicitly defined,
he added, the judgment and
interpretation of the University
will apply.
It is because the University
holds this power of final in
terpretation, according to Or
gan, that abuses of the system
can occur.
"It certainly allows any ad
ministrator to be arbitrary if he
feels like it," Organ said.
Organ said he questions the
basic premise that a manager
can be totally objective in de
ciding a dispute between him
and an employee when the
manager has the final decision.
He said he doesn't feel that the
procedure takes human nature
into account.

"Any managers who want to
advance in the University will
not decide against their
employers often," Organ said.
This effect would definitely put
the grievant at a disadvantage.
Organ also said he feels the
legal decision against him "cul
tivates the institution of un
ions" to protect the
employees, an institution that
he had formerly spoken out
against.
"Maybe that's the way to go
now," he said.
The grievance policies them
selves underwent major
changes last spring. Prior to
last May, the policies allowed
the grievant a chance to have
his case heard by an outside
hearing officer for many types

of complaint. However, the
new policies that went into ef
fect denied access to an out
side hearing officer except in
cases of firing or permanent
layoff.
The University bases this
strirtlv internal grievance
policy on rxtensive training of
its line managers to deal with
grievance problems.
Organ said he feels that giv
ing the University that much
power is adversely affecting
many employees.
In any case, the responsibil
ity for fairness now rests
squarely with the University,
since the Court has decided
that legally, the University may
deal with any grievant as it sees
fit.
