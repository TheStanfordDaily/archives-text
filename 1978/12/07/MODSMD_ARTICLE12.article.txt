# Little 11 delegate plans confirmed
## 
### STEPHANIE POGGI 
Plans to send 20 University delegates
to the "Little Eleven Conference," a
student symposium on undergraduate
education, were confirmed at a meeting
last Thursday. The conference, to be
held in Philadelphia next February, is
intended to open the way to inter
university communication.
"I think we all get the feeling that
we're living in a vacuum here," said
loan Harrington, co-director of SCIRE.
Stanford was the only West Coast
university asked to participate in the
largely Ivy League coalition. Represen
tatives will include Harvard, Yale,
Brown, Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell,
Columbia, University of Pennsylvania,
M.I.T. and University of Chicago.
Leonard Ginsburg, a student at the
Univeristy of Pennsylvania, who origi
nally proposed the conference, invited
Stanford to join in September. How

ever, the formal decision to attaryj was
not reached until last"weie'K'.
Stanford's interest in what COP
member Andrew Goldenkranz called "a
long overdue study on university educa
tion" several factors delayed an affirma
tive consensus.
"The obvious elitism of the whole
project was something we threw back
and forth for a long time," said Har
rington. "Ideally, more and more uni
versities will become involved. But we
have to admit to a commonality bet
ween the 11 schools chosen, including
Stanford. Whether good or bad, it
exists."
Raising the necessary funds for trans
portation was another major difficulty
discussed in the early planning stages of
the project. Although todate no specific
sources have formally offered cash con
tributions, "the possibilities for raising
the approximately $3000 the total con-

Jferejrice would entail from us look prom
ising",** siid Goldenkranz.
According to Goldenkranz, the Uni
versity's involvement in the "little ele
ven" is crucial because "it has been over
10 years since a comprehensive educa
tional study has been done here."
While inter-university rapport is vital,
"our real aim is to help Stanford stu
dents solve problems Stanford students
face," said Goldenkranz.
Plans are already in the works to in
tegrate the information from the up
coming February conference back into
Stanford in the form of reports to Uni
versity committees and exisitng on
campus organizations. "In the mean
time, we have to identify all the problem
areas here," said Goldenkranz.
"The selection procedure for the 20
Stanford delegates has not yet been de
termined," said Harrington at the
Thursday meeting.

dents solve problems Stanford students
face," said Goldenkranz.
Plans are already in the works to in
tegrate the information from the up
coming February conference back into
Stanford in the form of reports to Uni
versity committees and exisitng on
campus organizations. "In the mean
time, we have to identify all the problem
areas here," said Goldenkranz.
"The selection procedure for the 20
