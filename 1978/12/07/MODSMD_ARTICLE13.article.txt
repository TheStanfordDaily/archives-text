# Admission acceptances second to Harvard
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Almost two out of three applicants
accepted here last year enrolled at a
ratio second only to Harvard's three out
of four, according to Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Fred Hargadon.
However, Hargadon cautioned
against using the so-called "yield rate"
as an indication of a school's quality.
"We could have a yield of 100 percent,"
he said "if we admitted the bottom
15<K) candidates. . . . Anyone who tries
to rank the top universities is foolish."
Hargadon said that if his office makes
what he called the right decisions, the
chances are good that the students it
admits will be accepted to other selec
tive universities.
Recent study
And in fact, a recent study prepared

by Dave Velasquez, assistant director of
admissions, and Tony Cadena, prog
ram analyst for the financial aids office,
shows that three out of four students
declining the University's offers of ad
missions chose private schools of simi
lar cost.
Harvard-Radcliffe, Yale, Princeton
and MIT are the University's principal
competitors, according to the study.
Among public universities, UCLA and
UC-Berkeley draw many students away
from the University.
Hargadon said some schools use
what he feels are improper techniques
to artificially increase their yield rates.
Though he declined to name those col
leges, he said the schools use alumni
interviews to learn whether their
school is the applicant's first choice.

Students who admit that it is not de
crease their chances of admission, he
said.
He also mentioned the early decision
plan as a factor which raises yield rates.
Under the early decision system applic
ants apply early and agree to attend the
school if admitted. Consequently, all
students admitted under the early deci
sion plan enroll. Stanford does not
have such a plan, he added.
More people — nearly 11,000 —
applied here last year than ever before,
Hargadon said, anH this \,;ar is "run
ning ahead of last year.'
Minority enrollment
The Velasquez-Cadena study also
showed that there has been no signific
ant change in the minority enrollment
here. Hargadon said that while his of

fice considers a person's background in
making an admissions decision, they
do not use quotas to raise the numbers
of disadvantaged applicants admitted.
"We keep trying to increase it, but we
don't want to do it artificially," he said.
Hargadon said he doesn't think stu
dents admitted today are more conser
vative than those enrolled here eight
years ago.
"I'm willing to bet that students come
in more socially conscious than they
did in the 'famous '60s.' " he said. In
volvement was simply more visible
then than it is now, he added. Televi
sion stations won't send a camera down
to film a student tutoring a disadvan
taged child "but they would if you cal
led them up and said there would be a
rally," he said.
