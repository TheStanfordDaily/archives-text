# Dorm damage levels significant, but stable
## 
### SAMUEL HOWE 
Damages and vandalism to
University residences, while
still "significant," have not in
creased so far this year in com
parison to last year, according
to Rob Ramirez, director of the
Residential Manager's Office.
But, they have also failed to go
down, he noted.
A large problem in assessing
the actual total cost of damages
to the houses is that one can
not always draw a clear line be
tween what constitutes actual
damage and what represents
normal wear-and-tear, Ramirez
added.
In cases where it cannot be
proven that an individual resi
dent or residents within a
house are responsible, then
funds to repair damages or to
replace property stolen from
common areas must come
from a general fund set aside
for residential maintenance.
If someone from the resi
dences is responsible, then the
persons involved must pay for
the damages. If they are not
caught, the money comes from

the individual houses' funds,
and all residents are consi
dered "collectively responsi
ble," he said.
Often a judgment must be
made on the cause of the dam
ages, and the bill is sent to the
house if it seems clear that stu
dents were responsible, even if
they cannot be caught. For in
stance, if tiles are knocked out
of the ceiling, it is generally as
sumed that this resulted from
student horseplay, such as
Frisbee or 'tallplaying, and the
residence will be responsible
for the repair cost.
Dispute over circumstances
"When there is a dispute
over it, it has to depend on the
circumstances," said an
employee from the Stern Hall
offices. "We usually work it out
with them (the Resident Man
ager's office)."
For example, she said, if a
dorm has an open party, it
should take extra precaution to
look out for possible damage;
otherwise it might be liable for
negligence and thus responsi
ble if damage occurs.
But often the damages go
unclaimed or uncaught, and
money thus spent for needless
damages cannot be used for
new furniture or long-overdue
but less visible repairs to the
residence, Ramirez said.
He also noted that damage
tended to be much more pre
valent in undergraduate
houses and especially all
freshmen residences, as op
posed to graduate dorms such
as Crothers Memorial, where
Ramirez said that there has
been "virtually no damage"
since the beginning of the
year.
Directly liable
The reasons for damages in
the residences are not always
clear. Often accidents occur,
but as no one is considered
directly liable, the repair must
be paid from the residential
maintenance fund, Ramirez
said.
But in other cases, where
damage might occur by stu
dents either carrying their
roughhousing too far or inflict
ing actual vandalism to the re
sidences, then the bil
led. If no one confesses, the
cost is paid for by house funds.
Often, Ramirez said, his of
fice depends on reports from
housing associates or resident
fellows in order to find stu
dents responsible for van
dalism and bill them. "Usually
they (the students reponsible)
agree to pay," he said.
Repair costs are high, al
though again Ramirez said he
was reluctant to quote actual
figures because repairmen
cannot easily differentiate
damage from wear. However,
with costs such as $35 to $50 to
repair windows, $200 to $300
for broken panic equipment
on doors, and up to $1700 to

repair damages caused by stu
dents walking on roofs, the fi
gures add up, Ramirez said.
Damage rare
Among the 38 row and clus
ter houses for which the Row
Office is responsible, damage
is "fairly rare," according to
Diana Conklin, assistant direc
tor there.
However, it varies from resi
dence to residence. "Obvi
ously, some frats and row
houses tend to have a lot more
damage. Some are just a lot
rowdier than others," said Ann
Clatzel, an administrative as
sistant for the Resident Man
ager'soffice. "It depends upon
the personality of the house
and the year."
Often students consider that
they are "borrowing" specific
items such as furniture from
their residence's lounges and
that they can just return them
at the end of the year."
Borrowing problem
This problem of "borrow
ing" has been especially seri
ous in the Manzanita trailer
park, according to Elizabeth
Hiyama, director. Often stu
dents will take couches or
chairs from the Manzanita
lounge for their own use in the
trailers. "But if something is
missing," Hiyama noted, "we
have to assume that it has been
stolen . . . and the police are
notified."
But, she added, generally
items taken in this manner are
returned soon, as students
either become aware that what
they are doing is not allowed or
they are reported. "Basically, I
don't think it's a very serious
problem," she said.
Hiyama also noted that a
problem exists in that indi
vidual residences often blarne
each other for the theft of fur
niture and other items. For
example, she said, many times
other dormitories will call the
Manzanita office and ask if
couches might have been
found in any of the trailers.
Hiyama said that she did not
think itwa« «air to accuse trailer
residents just because their
living quai lers, which are gen
erally for three or four people,
are larger.

is "fairly rare," according to
Diana Conklin, assistant direc
tor there.
However, it varies from resi
dence to residence. "Obvi
ously, some frats and row
houses tend to have a lot more
damage. Some are just a lot
rowdier than others," said Ann
Clatzel, an administrative as
sistant for the Resident Man
ager'soffice. "It depends upon
the personality of the house
and the year."
Often students consider that
they are "borrowing" specific
items such as furniture from
their residence's lounges and
that they can just return them
at the end of the year."
Borrowing problem
This problem of "borrow
ing" has been especially seri
ous in the Manzanita trailer
park, according to Elizabeth
Hiyama, director. Often stu
dents will take couches or
chairs from the Manzanita
lounge for their own use in the
trailers. "But if something is
missing," Hiyama noted, "we
have to assume that it has been
stolen . . . and the police are
notified."
But, she added, generally
items taken in this manner are
returned soon, as students
either become aware that what
they are doing is not allowed or
they are reported. "Basically, I
don't think it's a very serious
problem," she said.
Hiyama also noted that a
problem exists in that indi
vidual residences often blarne
each other for the theft of fur
niture and other items. For
example, she said, many times
other dormitories will call the
Manzanita office and ask if
couches might have been
found in any of the trailers.
Hiyama said that she did not
think itwa« «air to accuse trailer
residents just because their
living quai lers, which are gen
erally for three or four people,
are larger.
Damages and vandalism to
University residences, while
still "significant," have not in
creased so far this year in com
parison to last year, according
to Rob Ramirez, director of the
Residential Manager's Office.
But, they have also failed to go
down, he noted.
A large problem in assessing
the actual total cost of damages
to the houses is that one can
not always draw a clear line be
tween what constitutes actual
damage and what represents
normal wear-and-tear, Ramirez
added.
In cases where it cannot be
proven that an individual resi
dent or residents within a
house are responsible, then
funds to repair damages or to
replace property stolen from
common areas must come
from a general fund set aside
for residential maintenance.
If someone from the resi
dences is responsible, then the
persons involved must pay for
the damages. If they are not
caught, the money comes from

the individual houses' funds,
and all residents are consi
dered "collectively responsi
ble," he said.
Often a judgment must be
made on the cause of the dam
ages, and the bill is sent to the
house if it seems clear that stu
dents were responsible, even if
they cannot be caught. For in
stance, if tiles are knocked out
of the ceiling, it is generally as
sumed that this resulted from
student horseplay, such as
Frisbee or 'tallplaying, and the
residence will be responsible
for the repair cost.
Dispute over circumstances
"When there is a dispute
over it, it has to depend on the
circumstances," said an
employee from the Stern Hall
offices. "We usually work it out
with them (the Resident Man
ager's office)."
For example, she said, if a
dorm has an open party, it
should take extra precaution to
look out for possible damage;
otherwise it might be liable for
negligence and thus responsi
ble if damage occurs.
But often the damages go
unclaimed or uncaught, and
money thus spent for needless
damages cannot be used for
new furniture or long-overdue
but less visible repairs to the
residence, Ramirez said.
He also noted that damage
tended to be much more pre
valent in undergraduate
houses and especially all
freshmen residences, as op
posed to graduate dorms such
as Crothers Memorial, where
Ramirez said that there has
been "virtually no damage"
since the beginning of the
year.
Directly liable
The reasons for damages in
the residences are not always
clear. Often accidents occur,
but as no one is considered
directly liable, the repair must
be paid from the residential
maintenance fund, Ramirez
said.
But in other cases, where
damage might occur by stu
dents either carrying their
roughhousing too far or inflict
ing actual vandalism to the re
sidences, then the bil
led. If no one confesses, the
cost is paid for by house funds.
Often, Ramirez said, his of
fice depends on reports from
housing associates or resident
fellows in order to find stu
dents responsible for van
dalism and bill them. "Usually
they (the students reponsible)
agree to pay," he said.
Repair costs are high, al
though again Ramirez said he
was reluctant to quote actual
figures because repairmen
cannot easily differentiate
damage from wear. However,
with costs such as $35 to $50 to
repair windows, $200 to $300
for broken panic equipment
on doors, and up to $1700 to

repair damages caused by stu
dents walking on roofs, the fi
gures add up, Ramirez said.

But often the damages go
unclaimed or uncaught, and
money thus spent for needless
damages cannot be used for
new furniture or long-overdue
but less visible repairs to the
residence, Ramirez said.
He also noted that damage
tended to be much more pre
valent in undergraduate
houses and especially all
freshmen residences, as op
posed to graduate dorms such
as Crothers Memorial, where
Ramirez said that there has
been "virtually no damage"
since the beginning of the
year.
Directly liable
The reasons for damages in
the residences are not always
clear. Often accidents occur,
but as no one is considered
directly liable, the repair must
be paid from the residential
maintenance fund, Ramirez
said.
But in other cases, where
damage might occur by stu
dents either carrying their
roughhousing too far or inflict
ing actual vandalism to the re
sidences, then the bil
led. If no one confesses, the
cost is paid for by house funds.
Often, Ramirez said, his of
fice depends on reports from
housing associates or resident
fellows in order to find stu
dents responsible for van
dalism and bill them. "Usually
they (the students reponsible)
agree to pay," he said.
Repair costs are high, al
though again Ramirez said he
was reluctant to quote actual
figures because repairmen
cannot easily differentiate
damage from wear. However,
with costs such as $35 to $50 to
repair windows, $200 to $300
for broken panic equipment
on doors, and up to $1700 to

repair damages caused by stu
dents walking on roofs, the fi
gures add up, Ramirez said.
Damage rare
Among the 38 row and clus
ter houses for which the Row
Office is responsible, damage
is "fairly rare," according to
Diana Conklin, assistant direc
tor there.
However, it varies from resi
dence to residence. "Obvi
ously, some frats and row
houses tend to have a lot more
damage. Some are just a lot
rowdier than others," said Ann
Clatzel, an administrative as
sistant for the Resident Man
ager'soffice. "It depends upon
the personality of the house
and the year."
Often students consider that
they are "borrowing" specific
items such as furniture from
their residence's lounges and
that they can just return them
at the end of the year."
Borrowing problem
This problem of "borrow
ing" has been especially seri
ous in the Manzanita trailer
park, according to Elizabeth
Hiyama, director. Often stu
dents will take couches or
chairs from the Manzanita
lounge for their own use in the
trailers. "But if something is
missing," Hiyama noted, "we
have to assume that it has been
stolen . . . and the police are
notified."
But, she added, generally
items taken in this manner are
returned soon, as students
either become aware that what
they are doing is not allowed or
they are reported. "Basically, I
don't think it's a very serious
problem," she said.
Hiyama also noted that a
problem exists in that indi
vidual residences often blarne
each other for the theft of fur
niture and other items. For
example, she said, many times
other dormitories will call the
Manzanita office and ask if
couches might have been
found in any of the trailers.
Hiyama said that she did not
think itwa« «air to accuse trailer
residents just because their
living quai lers, which are gen
erally for three or four people,
are larger.
Damages and vandalism to
University residences, while
still "significant," have not in
creased so far this year in com
parison to last year, according
to Rob Ramirez, director of the
Residential Manager's Office.
But, they have also failed to go
down, he noted.
A large problem in assessing
the actual total cost of damages
to the houses is that one can
not always draw a clear line be
tween what constitutes actual
damage and what represents
normal wear-and-tear, Ramirez
added.
In cases where it cannot be
proven that an individual resi
dent or residents within a
house are responsible, then
funds to repair damages or to
replace property stolen from
common areas must come
from a general fund set aside
for residential maintenance.
If someone from the resi
dences is responsible, then the
persons involved must pay for
the damages. If they are not
caught, the money comes from

the individual houses' funds,
and all residents are consi
dered "collectively responsi
ble," he said.
Often a judgment must be
made on the cause of the dam
ages, and the bill is sent to the
house if it seems clear that stu
dents were responsible, even if
they cannot be caught. For in
stance, if tiles are knocked out
of the ceiling, it is generally as
sumed that this resulted from
student horseplay, such as
Frisbee or 'tallplaying, and the
residence will be responsible
for the repair cost.
Dispute over circumstances
"When there is a dispute
over it, it has to depend on the
circumstances," said an
employee from the Stern Hall
offices. "We usually work it out
with them (the Resident Man
ager's office)."
For example, she said, if a
dorm has an open party, it
should take extra precaution to
look out for possible damage;
otherwise it might be liable for
negligence and thus responsi
ble if damage occurs.
But often the damages go
unclaimed or uncaught, and
money thus spent for needless
damages cannot be used for
new furniture or long-overdue
but less visible repairs to the
residence, Ramirez said.
He also noted that damage
