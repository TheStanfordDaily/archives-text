## Editorial Thanks & good luck 
### 
As we head full speed into Finals Week
trying to assimilate all we have learned and
experienced this quarter and jam it into
concise, to-the-point essays, we would like
to take the opportunity to thank some of
the students who have given us the chance
to occasionally break away from the library
doldrums and enjoy a football, water polo,
soccer game or any of the other sporting
events'competed in by Stanford teams.
Our special thanks and congratulations
go to the football and water polo teams.
The NCAA championship speaks for itself
and for the excellence of the water poloists.
The football team, a much more visible
competitor, had one of those seasons that
is hard to classify. We all know that the
team could have easily been 9-2, and with a
few breaks against USC and Oklahoma,

who knows? But the "ifs" don't, and prob
ably shouldn't, count for much when
you're defending a respectable 7-4 season
to your friends back home before the
Bluebonnet Bowl kickoff-
No, you won't be able to convince those
friends just how good this year's s^ anf " rc j
team is; the team will have to do that
against Georgia on New Year's Eve in Ho " s "
ton. But don't worry too much. Even if the
team loses, and we hardly think that will be
the case, it will provide football fans across
the country with a rare glimpse at a class
we simply want to thank this and
the other fine teams which gave us some
thing to stand up and yell about this fall and
we wish the football team the best of luck
against Georgia.
