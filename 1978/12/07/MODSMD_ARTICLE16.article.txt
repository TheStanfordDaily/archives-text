## A
						Christmas poem 
### 
With Hoover tower capped in snow,
and icicles clinging to Florence Mo,
As figures skate on old Lake Lag.,
the frozen foothills cloaked in fog;
It's time to visit nears and dears,
raise the wrist and toast with cheers,
With Miclf. and Bud, Becks and Coors,
(Rodney Dangerfield make it yours.)
It's time to recall with song and wine,
the Dow Jones slide and the latest line,
So let us now commemorate,
Nineteen-hundred and seventy-eight:
It was a time of big inflation,
big budgets and big devrluation;"Who," we
asked, "can save the nation?
Rescue the fiscal situation?
Howard Jarvis, Paul Gann? •
John Briggs, the Tidy-Bowl man?"
Meanwhile, Jimmy (wish him well)
let Jody Powell sound the bell:
"May all my enemies go to hell,
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel."
Now let's combine our rhyme and reason,
and call the watch-words of the season:
Congratulations lerry Brown,
Been "Living in the U.S.A.?"
To Ray Kroc and lowly Padres,
you deserve a break today.
To the boys in Dodger Blue .1 lament,
on Graig's glove and Buckv's dent.
To Senor Castro say you re sorry,
for Brezhnev's Somalian safari.
To Elvis Presley one last rave,
and a platinum L.P. from the grave.
Mister Claus has packed his sleigh,
with ice and gin and Perrier;
For little Chris a Star-Wars belt
For little Melvin — Hannukah geld.
But that hardly fills the stocking;
Santa, here's some last-minute shopping:
For Hamilton Jordan, his favorite dope,
For Alan Bakke, a microscope. .
For George McGovern a Cambodsn pen-pal,
For Ronny Reagan a new canal.
For Premier Begin .1 dinette set from Levitz,
For Anwar Sadat, a case of Manichewitz.

For Reverend Jones and Guyanese pride,
some kool-Aid laced with cyanide.
And for the shah a thousand clones,
and a Pinto equipped with Firestones.
Well, this is just a partial list,
I hope I've mentioned the season's gist.
And now let's honor Stanford's best,
without delay, at your request:
Three cheers for Johnny McEnroe,
from Econ 1. to tennis pro.
For Patty Hearst a new chain gang,
For Sally Ride a glass of Tang.
For Gaieties a "Yes" on Six,
For the Student Senate a "no" on "nix."
For Stanford trustees, SCRIP sings Gloria,
and loans them airfare to Pretoria.
A Chorus for the Stanford Band,
never boring, never bland.
Take the field and strike a cord, those forma
tions can't look fuzzy,
Put some weight on David Ford!
Put some clothes on Pamela C.uzv!
It's over the river and through the hills, to
touch the arm of Stephen Dils.
Twelve all-beef patties, lettuce and cheese,
tor Ceresino, if you please.
A french fry and clump of sod,
for Darrin Nelson and his father, God.
Roast the Weenies! Tear the goal!
charge to that Bluebonnel Bowl!
In a minute there is time,
but Dead Week's death knells start to chime:
Time to drop to thirteen units,
time to take P. Chem. pass/fail.
Too late to buy a supersaver,
too soon to send for grades by mail. . .
My Stanford comrades, let's take leave,
and reunite on New Year's Eve —
Don't ask me why it is our fate,
to travel to the Lone Star State. . .
it sure beats watching Johnny Carson!
