# Increasing awareness
## 
### 
For the purposes of introduction, I am the
female freshman who was sexually attacked on
campus Ikst month and (because I reported the
"attempted rape" to the police), the subject of
the articlfe in the Daily (Nov. 6).
First, I would personally like to thank and
congratulate the writer of that article, and espe
cially the editors of the Daily, for reporting my
attack in such a tactful manner. All too often the
temptation in journalism to sensationalize inci
dents of this nature overrules consideration for
the victim's feelings. I am grateful for the Daily's
policy of sensitivity in printing stories of this
kind.
Rape is a problem in this community. I find it
shocking, especially because now I listen more
keenly for conversations on the subject matter,
that the level of "rape-consciousness" at the
University is so persistently low. Despite the
laudable efforts of feminist-groups and prog
rams such as the University Rape Education Pro
ject (REP), a large percentage of the students
remain amazingly naive.
just a few days ago I overhead a conversation
between two women about so-called "date
rapes," during which one woman said, "But at
least there aren't real rapists walking around
here. I mean, violent criminals like there are in
Los Angeles or places." Well, unfortunately, vio
lent rape is a problem on this campus. The
"grapevine" which Bisceglia speaks of in her
letter to the editor [Daily, Nov. 17) is quite in
formative to those who are sufficiently curious. I
have heard enough to know that sexual assaults
in which the attacker(s) and the victim do not
know each other occur on this campus more
frequently than anyone supposes.
My intention is not to scare everyone into
becoming so "aware" that we all become
paranoid. In fact, I have the discouraging feeling
that many people, such as the woman quoted
above, will never be willing to accept or under
stand what women like myself are trying to say.
Their sense of security, however false it may be,
is simply too comforting to them. I only bring it
up because I feel this screaming for "aware
ness" has been misdirected.
I suggest that the only practical way to begin
solving this problem and make this campus safer

for women is to demand more police protec
tion and the only way to obtain this is to in
crease police awareness.
I was shocked when I read that my attack was
"the first reported incident this quarter," and as
far as I know, no other attacks have since been
reported. I know calling the police is not easy,
and the fear of the possible ordeal of police
investigations is a big deterrent. I could never
have done it myself if my best friend had not
coaxed me along and been there for support. I

In fact, I have the discouraging
feeling that many people will
never be willing to accept or
understand what women like
myself are trying to say, their
sense of security, however
false it may be, is simply too
comforting to them.

am also not suggesting that the police are the
cure-all. But let's be realistic â€” police protec
tion is a big part of any protection, and pdlice
need to be aware of problems before they can
take action, prevention or otherwise.
If you are, or have been a victim, report it. You
may do so anonymously (dial 329-2421 and your
information will be recorded), but get that in
formation to the police. Even if your case simply
becomes a statistic, it will make policemen
aware of the problem.
I'm not impugning the importance of the
"rape-awareness" programs on campus. On the
contrary, I think they are praiseworthy efforts
and commendable to both women and men,
(rape affects guys, too), for increasing their con
sciousness and understanding. But let's redirect
this demand for awareness to the police and
stop waiting for popular sympathy to end violent
rapes on campus.
