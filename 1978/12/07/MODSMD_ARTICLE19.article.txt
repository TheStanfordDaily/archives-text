## Recognizing John Brown 
### 
One hundred nineteen years ago, on
December 2, 1859, the commonwealth of
Virginia executed )ohn Brown for treason.
Each year the American people officially
celebrate the birthdays of George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Each
year they pass over in silence the anniver
sary of the martyrdom of John Brown, a
man besides whom Washington and Lin
coln were moral pygmies.
Such a contrast is not surprising.
John Brown was, of course, the man
who seized the U.S. Armory at Harpers
Ferry in order to obtain arms to support an
uprising of the slaves. His action was
quickly condemned not only by suppor
ters of slavery but also by many of slavery's
opponents.
An exception was the great abolitionist
and radical libertarian essayist Henry
David Thoreau. Thoreau, who was per
sonally acquainted with Brown, said of
him, "He did not recognize unjust human
laws but resisted them as he was bid . . .
knowing himself for a man and the equal
of any and all governments . . . He could
not have been tried by a jury of his peers,
because his peers did not exist."
Brown (like Thoreau) was one of that
historical minority with a passionate un
derstanding of the central libertarian in
sight that a government must be judged by
the same moral standards as anyone else.
He not one to suppress the desire
for liberty with specious sophisms about
the necessity for accepting the results of

the democratic process or the need of
working through established legal chan
nels. He agreed rather with the founders
of this republic that whenever any form of
government systematically violates human
rights, the people should exercise their
revolutionary right of rising up against that
government and, through violence if
necessary, altering or abolishing it.
Brown did not accept the current con
servative view that we must seek a balance

Only the piercing radicalism of
a Brown can rip the veil from the
face of government. . . .

between the freedom of the individual and
the needs of society. He recognized rather
that society is made up of nothing but in
dividuals.
Nor did Brown accept the current liberal
view which confuses liberty and welfare.
He did not believe that a well-fed and
well-treated slave was any less a slave.
He saw that law is simply the codifica
tion of the wills of individual men. If it
gives cectainty and protection to the rights
of individuals, it should be respected.
When it serves as a mask behind which
tyranny and aggression hide, it should be
resisted and destroyed.

It is understandable that the current
political and intellectual leaders of
America should extol as a national hero
not Brown but rather Abraham Lincoln,
the Kennedys, or Dr. Martin Luther King.
Such men were pragmatists willing to
acknowledge the legitimacy of the existing
state apparatus in exchange for the
privilege of power or influence.
The current oppression in American life
— the onerous taxation; the attempts to
'egislate morality and suppress dissident
lifestyles; the unprincipled foreign policy
which ignores human freedom abroad arid
threatens human liberties at home; the
web of economic restraints, controls and
favors which constitute an economy £112
privilege — is made possible only by
people's willingness to judge agents of the
government by different standards of
morality than those applied to everyone
else.
Only the piercing radicalism of a Brown
can rip the veil from the face of govern
ment, strip it of its robes of legitimacy, arid
subject it to the same scrutiny and stan
dards as any other human organization.'
If we wish to free America, we must rep
ognize and seek to emulate the moral sta
ture of Brown. It is not simply the only
moral but also the only practical way to
end the misery and subjection which gov
ernment has brought to the human rac"e
through the last 500 years.

Each year the American people officially
celebrate the birthdays of George

year they pass over in silence the anniver

Such a contrast is not surprising.
John Brown was, of course, the man
who seized the U.S. Armory at Harpers

uprising of the slaves. His action was
quickly condemned not only by suppor

opponents.
An exception was the great abolitionist
and radical libertarian essayist Henry
David Thoreau. Thoreau, who was per
sonally acquainted with Brown, said of
him, "He did not recognize unjust human
laws but resisted them as he was bid . . .
knowing himself for a man and the equal
of any and all governments . . . He could
not have been tried by a jury of his peers,
because his peers did not exist."
