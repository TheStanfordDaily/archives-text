## A
						cause for concern: pesticides 
### 
Why should we care about
pesticide use in California? Be
cause California fivp per
cent of the world's pesticides
each year. California s pes
ticide use has increased alarm
ingly to a point where it will
now double every four years.
Pesticides are mostly pet
rochemicals, and heavy insec
ticide and herbicide use de
pletes the precious supply of
fossil fuels. This is of concern
to everyone, for as the price of
petroleum based products
rise, the price of food will also
increase.
Pesticide use in California
should concern people be
cause we all carry traces of in
secticides in our own bodies.
We can't keep fooling ourse
lves about the realities of pes
ticides, herbicides and other
toxins. Pesticides have specifi
cally been designed to be
poisonous to living things. If
you use poisons on foods —
then the poison must go
somewhere. That somewhere,
in most cases, is in our own
bodies.
Often the toxicity of pes
ticides is not acute but chronic.
This means the poisons slowly
build up in small portions in
human tissue, because they do
not break down, and the harm
ful effects are not revealed (ill
several years in the future.
Many of these are novel
chemicals which never biodeg
rade. In other words, no living
organisms have evolutionary
experience in breaking down
these compounds, and they
create a permanent problem.
Many insecticides may not be
removed by thorough scrub
bing or washing of your fruits
and vegetables.
In addition, disease-bearing
mosquitoes are becoming a
potential problem in California
because of misuse and overuse
of chemicals. Ten percent of
the irrigated pastures now
cannot be treated with any in
secticide because the mos
quitoes have become resistant
to all known insecticides. This
could have grave consequ
ences for public health.
In agriculture, 95 percent of
our pest problems are aggra
vated or directly caused by the
massive doses of poisons

turned out by the petrochemi
cal industries. The California
State Department of Agricul
ture also reports that 22 of the
25 most serious pests are resis
tant to one or more insec
ticides. Thus many of our pest

mand inner biological
quality from our food:
nutritional value and
flavor. Society must
realize that every apple
in the basket cannotbe
unblemished. . . .

problems are aggravated or di
rectly caused by pesticide use,
and these problems are certain
to increase in the future.
In desperation, farmers
spray more and more each year
to control pests and yet have
less success. This occurs be
cause excessive spraying leads
to the outbreak of more resis
tant, or even to new, pests that
were formerly considered be
nign. Resurgence is common
due to the fact that killing off
the pest's natural enemies
along with the pests allows
those insects that didn't die, or
those that migrate from nearby
fields, to multiply without re
striction.
Considering the dangers of
pesticides to all living things,
their increasing ineffective
ness to control insects, and
their drain on limited pet
roleum reserves and on the
farmer's financial resources,
are pesticides vitally neces
sary? If we totally abandoned
chemical pesticides, a Cornell
entomologist, David Pimental,
estimates that American food
production would only fall
seven percent, mostly in fruit
production. Without pes
ticides our lives really would
not change dramatically. It
must be remembered that
prior to the advent of pes
ticides in this century, man had
successfully farmed organi
cally for 6000 years.
Hope for the future lies with
Integrated Pest Management

(IPM) — the most sophisticated
and advanced approach to the
pest problem. In September
1977, the President's Council
on Environmental Quality re
leased a report showing that
chemical insecticide use in the
United States could be cut by
50 percent without losses in
yields through use of IPM
techniques already proven ef
fective. IPM employs a whole
battery of techniques includ
ing computer analysis of insect
and predator life patterns, in
sect viruses, crop rotation,
natural predators, companion
planting, sex pheromone
traps, and, when appropriate,
selective use of pesticides. The
goal of IPM is to reduce the
pest population, not to eradi
cate every pest individually.
Individually we can help to
readjust our values to tolerate
some plant damage. We must

learn to demand inner biologi
cal quality from our food: nut
ritional value and flavor. Soci
ety must realize that every
apple in the basket cannot be
unblemished, and of the same,
size, shape and color.
The keys for the farmer in the
future lie in an awareness of
the ecological dynamics of the
system; the ability to identify
trends, anticipate problems,
and employ the most effective,
least disruptive control mea
sures. The components of the
IPM strategy — good plant nut
riton, natural predators, heal
thy soil, resistant seeds, com
panion planting and crop rota
tion — are valuable aids to the
farmer which lessen or obviate
the need for pesticides. IPM
will help us to economically get
off the pesticide treadmill.
