Sexism in cartoons
The Daily published a car
toon (Nov. 9) by Chris Jurrcich;
its final panel showed "the
most woman-hungry guy on
campus, J. Moist," de
monstrating how he acquired
his name. He's displaying his
waterbed to a woman, who
stands in a "sexy" pose, and
inquires: "of course we've all
heard of your waterbed,
Johnny, but how did you come
to give it a name like 'Victory at
Sea?' . .
Obviously, this cartoon is
sexist. Women are neither
items of food to satisfy sexual
"hunger," nor are they objects
of conquest, prizes to be won.
Implicit in the cartoon's humor
is the attitude that conquest is
an acceptable and surely harm
less male activity. It's specious
to say that Juricich is attacking
such attitudes; a truly positive
satire would present the
woman as a character to sym
pathize with, not as a mere
prop in the scenario, a body
with a back turned.
Furthermore, this isn't an
isolated incident; several of
Juricich's cartoons have been
egregiously sexist. Therefore
yve ask that Juricich remove
sexism from his cartoons. If he
can't, we ask that the Daily
stop printing them.
The Daily this year has
printed a number of extraordi
narily sexist articles, editorials,
cartoons, and ads. They aren't
innocuous; sexism, like ra
cism, isn'ta joke. It'saconstant
humiliation, a daily psycholog
ical (and often physical) blud
geoning which no human
being can bear without even
tual harm to body and soul.
Carolyn Craven, a well
known reporter and a rape vic
tim, addresses that point about
sexism in this quote: . .
women have got to stop taking
the blame for rape. And men
have to deal with that. . . .
Women can only do certain
things. Men have to stop it;
men have to stop committing
rape. Rape exists on a con
tinuum of sexism; it's the ulti
mate weapon of the sexist. It's
by stopping other forms of
sexism that you'll be able to
draw in the people out there
on the extreme. That's why
when I say that men have to
stop rape, one of the ways you
stop rape is that you stop way
early by not laughing at the
sexist jokes, not telling them,
stopping other people who
do. . . . And unless they stop
it, all the tension and hostility
and problems between men
and women are gonna con
tinue to increase and grow.
"And rape is certainly in
creasing as a crime. Last year,
62,400 women reported being
raped in America. . . . That
means that in actuality some
where between 500,000 and
600,000 women were raped in
1977. And you can't live in a
bubble and say it's never
gonna happen to men, or it'll
never happen to my wife or my
mother or sister or daughter or
my lover or my friend. . . .
That's really a serious problem
and it affects everybody."
So we must ask: will the
Daily help us end rape by end
ing sexism? Each of us — male
and female — must make this
choice, to be either sexist or
feminist; there is no middle
ground where human lives are
concerned. And the Daily staf
fers' choice can be profoundly
important.

/Editor's note: The cartoon in
; question is not "obviously"
sexist, in our opinion. Showing
I sexism is far from the same
thing as advocating or perpet
rating it. The character Johnny

Moist in the strip is portrayed as
an individual with sexist at
titudes just as Archie Bunker is
portrayed as a bigot. In no way
do either of these characters re
flect on the true attitudes of the
writers, cartoonist, television
network or newspaper which
present them to the public.
The argument that the Daily
and Chris Juricich in any way
condone or advocate rape
through the J. Moist cartoon
strip or any other means is ab
surd, irresponsible, and most
resentive.

Make your own
decisions
The column by Jonathan Day
(Daily, Dec. 1) neglects the dif
ference between empirical
truth and logical or absolute
truth.
An empirical truth is reached
by induction, being drawn
from experience. This is the
type of truth to which your
"graduate student" (or "young
professor") was referring. It is
basically speculative, i.e.,
opinion.
A logical, or absolute truth,
is reached by deduction. It is
unassailable if the premises of
the argument are correct.
When Day said "people . . .
(are) certain . . . that truth and
values are outmoded. . ~" he
was noticing that some people
have realized that many of the
moral truths they have been
taught are logical truths based
upon unproven premises. If
they are unwilling toaccept the
premises on faith, the moral
becomes meaningless.
If one wants the University to
"teach what is good and just
and true," one must become
one of the faithful and accept
the premises of its moral ar
guments. You would be better
off making your own decision
rather than taking the word of
some professor.

Learning about
differences
Recently a student told me,
somewhat surprised, that he
and his roommate got along
quite well even though he
liked sports and his roommate
didn't and even though he was
a Republican and his room
mate wasn't. Life in the resi
dences provides opportunities
to meet and learn from people
who have different
backgrounds, values, in
terests, and experiences.
One of the goals of residen
tial education is to provide op
portunities for residents that
encourage students to
examine their own values and
attitudes and to be open to and
accepting of those who think
and feel differently from them.
In Florence Moore during
fall quarter residential educa
tion has sponsored a series of
films about differences. Eye of
the Storm is an award-winning
documentary about a third
grade teacher in lowa who in
troduced her students to the
idea of prejudice by designat
ing blue-eyed children as
superior. The film records how
the children responded to the
roles of oppressor and oppres
sed and how the artificial eye
color distinction created
changes in behavior and at
titude. Other films focussed on
the distinctions in our society
relating to age, sex, race, class,
and physical disability.
In winterand spring quarters
a specially developed course
on homosexuality will be of
fered in Florence Moore. The

course is the first of what we
envision will be a series of
house-based classes dealing
with differences. We have cho
sen the topic of homosexuality
for the first of these experi
mental courses because it is an
important contemporary social
and political issue and because
students have sometimes de
monstrated an insensitivity to
their fellow students who are
gay-
SWOPSI 162 will survey at
titudes toward homosexuality
in an historical context, in part
through the presentations of
homosexuality in literature,
film and the visual arts. Con
temporary psychological,
sociological, and political as
pects of homosexuality in the
United States will be the prim
ary focus of the course.
The class is intended for men
and women, both homosexual
and heterosexual. The course
is not designed for students
who are trying to came to
terms with their own sexual
orientation, although it will
provide a range of intellectual
experiences in which students
can examine their personal at
titudes. The class will include
weekly readings, student pre
sentations, films, guest speak
ers, and a required research
project. The SWOPSI winter
quarter catalog contains a
course description and sign-up
procedures. Students wanting
more information can contact
Corb Smith in Overseas
Studies.

Aggression a
"combination of
traits"
In her arguments to refute
my recent comments on a sex
difference, Dr. Maccoby
would limit the area in which
aggressiveness as a natural trait
finds expression {Daily, Nov.
22).
Our disagreement arises in
the fact that she addresses the
behavior resulting from inner
impulses, whereas I refer to
the inner impulses.
There is no evidence, how
ever, that the dominance of
men in the marketplace is not
an expression of the same trait
(call it what you will) which ex
presses itself in physical ag
gression. I maintain that these
phenomena arise from a single
inborn trait or combination of
traits: and prima facie evidence
is sufficient to conclude that it
generally exists to a greater de
gree in men than in women.
Even were the difference
only the result of a primal sens
ing that, all else being equal,
dominance can be achieved
through physical strength
(which limitation I do not con
cede), the basis for such sens
ing remains an inherent part of
the human race.
Moreover, the fact that
women have been generally
unable to achieve full de facto
equity in the family (which fact
has been a major impetus in
the women's movement away
from the family) is a strong in
dication they will have even
less success on the whole in
the marketplace; for in the
family they have had a degree
of influence which cannot be
matched in the marketplace.
Meanwhile, they are surren
dering — and in California
have surrendered — those
domestic legal advantages
which have tended to balance
the picture. Except for "affir
mative action" programs
(which, because they require
constant policing by the minor
ity who attribute sex differ
ences to conditioning, can

have only very limited suc
cess), women are now increas
ingly forced — without equal
ity in all of the inherent assets
needed for equal showing in
competition — to compete in
society on an essentially equal
basis with me.
As a result, men are losing
their former less selfish mo
tives for economic gain, chil
dren are losing the "object
constancy" which they need in
mothers, anarchy reigns in the
family, and life is becoming a
mere free-for-all.

Wisdom in
preservation
I am writing to support any
effort to conserve as national
wilderness the areas desig
nated within the Alaska Lands
Bill, H.R. 39.
As members of a leading na
tion and a civilized society, I
hope we might demonstrate by
now that our criteria for civili
zation can include the protec
tion of irreplaceable wilder
ness — in its virginal, most un
civilized State — as an integral
part of our prosperity.
By now we should see that
human development need not
be a cancerous expansion
fueled by greed, wastefulness
and dangerous technology.
I hope that as we prosper we
might realize the wisdom in the
preservation of certain parts of
our country as invaluable as
sets not to our nation's
economy, but to our planet's
ecology and ultimately to our
own humanity.

A case against
deterrence
Ex-San Francisco Supervisor
Dan White's confession to the
assassinations of Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Har
vey Milk, as reported in the San
Francisco Chronicle on
November 30, should certainly
make it clear to proponents of
capital punishment that the
death penalty does not func
tion as a deterrent to murder
ers.
When White entered the
mayor's office with his .38-
caliber revolver, he was well
aware of the new law that ex
panded the realm of the death
penalty to include the "special
circumstance" of murdering

more than one person, both
victims being public officials.
In fact, White strongly en
dorsed Proposition 7, while
Moscone and Milk, longtime
opponents of capital punish
ment, came out against the
measure.
One may argue that if the
death penalty deters even one
potential killer, it is worth
keeping on the books. Who,
then, is going to be deterred
from killing someone, if not
Dan White? As Vietnam War
veteran, former policeman,
former fireman, former
elected public official, White
has been in some position of
responsibility virtually all his
life.
The next time Californians
are faced with deciding if the
death penalty should remain
reinstated, I hope they realize
that it will not deter murderers,
it will only kill them.

Tragedy
lacking in article
I would like to respond to
the letter of Ann Ellis that was
published in the Daily on
November 27 and to the article
on Anorexia Nervosa on
November 6. Ellis' letter
echoed my sentiments con
cerning the simplistic and in
sensitive portrayal of Anorexia
Nervosa that was characterized
in the article.
In my comments to the re
porter I pointed out two
social/psychological facts
about Anorexia Nervosa which
may be considered as con
tributing to the causality of the
disease. That is, there has re
portedly been increased inci
dence of Anorexia Nervosa oc
curring over the years that soc
iety has become more con
cerned with slimness. It has
also been noted that the onset
of the disease often follows a
diet carried out by an adoles
cent woman in order to
achieve slimness. However, I
believe and I stated that
Anorexia Nervosa appears to
have multiple causes that are
postulated to be intrapsychic,
familial, biological, and social
in nature. Research has ex
panded in two areas in particu
lar — the biological
physiological mechanisms (the
neuroendocrine and hormonal
pathways related to hunger
and satiety) and secondly, in
terms of the familiar environ
ment in which Anorexia Ner
vosa arises.
It was unfortunate that the
tragedy and anguish felt both
by the patients and their
families did not come through
in the Daily article.

Poor quality of
postal service
The United States Postal Ser
vice is so bad that in a rational
world it would have been
eliminated long ago. It always
takes four days for a letter to go
from Moorpark (which is less
than an hour's drive from
downtown Los Angeles) to
Stanford, or from Stanford to
Moorpark. And the October
1978 issue of the Stanford Ob
server was printed and mailed
on October 4 but did not reach
its readers in Menlo Park until
October 19 and did not get to
Moorpark until October 28.
If the United States Postal
Service was eliminated and
mail was delivered by private
carriers with free competition
and no restrictions on regula
tions, we would have mail deli
vered in one day between
Moorpark and Stanford (for
example) and at less cost.
