## Bhutto as symbol 
### 
We should look at Ali
Bhutto not as an individual,
not merely as a Prime
Minister deposed by a
military dictator, but as a
symbol and pillar of demo
cracy in the whole region,
enjoying overwhelming
support and confidence of
75 million people of his
own country, and of the Is
lamicWorldasawhole. His
fate cannot be left to a rep
ressive military regime,
whose own survival hangs
precariously in the ba
lance, because of total lack
of support from the
people.
The crimes, if any, com
mitted by Bhutto, are
therefore a matter of con
cern to his own people and
others beyond the frontiers
of his own land. His ideol
ogy and service to the
cause of world peace is
widely shared and acknow
ledged. His first and fun
damental crime is that he
was educated at Berkeley
and Oxford in the early
'50s, enshrining in his mind
the teachings of Abraham
Lincoln and the spirit of the
Magna Carta.
This won him in 1958, the
unique position of Federal
Minister in the Govern
ment of his country at the
young age of 30. In early
1966 when President Ayub
Khan of Pakistan went to
Tashkent to negotiate
peace with India under
Russian arbitration, Bhutto
as Foreign Minister, could
not reconcile what he cal
led betrayal of his country's
long term interests. He res
igned — an act of courage,
not common in the politics
of the East. This was his
second crime.
Bhutto was put into jail
by Ayub Khan but soon re
leased under violent public
pressure, which resulted in
the overthrow of the Ayub
regime and its replacement
by another military dic
tatorship of Yahya Khan.
Bhutto founded his Pakis
tan Peoples Party in 1967
and led one of the biggest
democratic movements in
Asia, urging the military
government for elections
which were held in 1970, in
which Bhutto's party won
more than 80 percent sup
port from the people of
West Pakistan.
East Pakistan voted
overwhelmingly for the
Awami league of Mujibur
Rahman and as a result of
international intrigue and
invasion by India, sup
ported by the Soviet Un
ion, East Pakistan fell apart
and became Bangladesh.
At this difficult hour in
the history of Pakistan,
Bhutto became the Presi
dent of Pakistan, replacing
the military dictator Yahya
Khan. This was his third
crime. It is of significant in
terest to note that all the
so-called political leaders
who today oppose Ali
Bhutto, contested the elec
tions in 1970 and were to
tally rejected by the people
of Pakistan. Knowing their
fate, these politicians are as
afraid today to face the
elections as they were in
1970, and hence they urge
Zia to keep on postponing
the promise of elections for
as long as possible, till
"positive results" can be
ensured, which means
elimination of Bhutto.
Let us complete the list of
Bhutto's crimes, since
1972, when he took over as
his country's elected

democratic leader:
1) Signed agreement with
India in 1972, resulting in
the release of 90,000 Pakis
tani POW's and normaliza
tion of relations between
the two countries.
2) Acting as a great bridge
between the United States
and the People's Republic
of China, paving the way
for the first ever dramatic
visit by U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger to
China which resulted in the
further visit of a U.S. Presi
dent to China with all its
historic consequences.
3) Consolidating the
Muslim World by holding
the Isamic Summit at La
hore in Feb. 1973, in which
more than 40 muslim heads
of state participated in
choosing Bhutto as chair
man of the Islamic Confer
ence — a position he still
holds.
4) A still greater crime
Bhutto committed was an
effort to bring the 77 coun
tries of the Third World to
gether with a View to give a
new economic order to the
world with the aid of the
democratic world, so that
their exploitation could be
forestalled. This act won
him more enemies in the
free world than one could
imagine.
5) In the same strain,
Bhutto negotiated a repro
cessing plant treaty with Fr
ance for peaceful de
velopment of his country's
economy and invited the
wrath of many friends who
had always described the
strength and stability of
Pakistan as a pillar of their
foreign policy.
The tale of his crimes at
home is indeed lengthy
and worthy of making him a
"horrible example" for
those who may dare to
thread his path. These in
clude:
1) Framing a federal and
democratic constitution for
Pakistan in 1973, <under
which he
from the Presidency and
became the first duly
elected Prime Minister.
2) Introducing agricul
tural reforms in 1972 limit
ing land holdings, thus
breaking the hold of the
old feudal landlords over
the serfs. The surplus land
thus made available was
distributed free of cost to
these age old serfs who
suddenly became respect
able and dignified land
owners.
3) Labor reforms were in
troduced in 1972-73, bring
ing labor laws more or less
at par with other free
societies in the West.
Major industries were
nationalized and taken
under state control. This
measure antagonized the
business magnates against
Bhutto, but his crime was
that he remained un
daunted. The labor today
stands solidly behind him.
The list of Bhutto's
crimes is very long but the
space of this article is li
mited. His biggest crime is
the creation of a sense of
dignity amongst the
downtrodden millions of
his country. The Pakistani
people want their democ
ratic right of fair and impar
tial elections, a slogan for
which people are being
flogged and put to jail by
the thousands. They also
want back their leader.
