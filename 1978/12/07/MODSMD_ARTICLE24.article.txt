# Non-Stanfordites falsely claim University degrees
## 
### RICK WEISSBOURD 
The next best thing to going to Stanford
University is saying you did. Or so have
found several job and graduate school
applicants falsely claiming Stanford degrees.
According to Bob Houghton, associate
registrar here, these self-proclaimed Stan
fordites use various forms of deception.
Some merely allege an "affiliation with a
prestigious school, but fail to mention that
the 'affiliation' merely consisted of auditing
a class. Others fraudulently use Stanford as
their alma mater when applying for jobs and
graduate school acceptance," Houghton
said. Less frequently, applicants will actually
obtain a fake Stanford University diploma.
Some examples
Houghton related several actual encoun
ters his office has had with crafty pseudog
rads: A phony diploma showed up at the
Registrar's office here. The diploma origi
nated in Hong Kong. A young man had
applied to work for a British company and
had alleged that he was a student here.
Houghton said that the "company wrote to
confirm the applicant's degree, but we had
no record. They thought thatfunny, because
they had a copy of a Stanford diploma sitting
right there." The British company mailed the
diploma here. The Registrar's office im
mediately recognized that the alleged dip
loma was fake and the office notified the
company.
Another person forged a telegram which
he sent to a company for which he wanted to
work. He purported that he was the Regis
trar here and was confirming that he had
gone to the University. The employer then
called the Registrar and found out the al

leged student had never been a student
here.
"Criminals on trial have claimed Stanford
degrees in an effort to soften the jury's ver
dict," Houghton said.
When a potential employer is unable to
confirm an applicant's University degree,
the applicant might phone Houghton from
the potential employer's office. On the
phone, the applicants often attempt to
prove they received the degree, even when
they know they never attended the Univer
sity. The employer merely sits in the room
and listens. The applicant carries on a
"fluke" conversation with Houghton. "Of
ten I am helpless in discovering who is cal
ling."
One man called from San Francisco and
stated that he had come from the Midwest to
verify a degree the Registrar's office origi
nally couldn't confirm. Houghton invited
him to personally visit the Registrar's office
and answer questions which would establish
whether he had ever been a student here.
The man never made an appearance.
People claim receipt of graduate degrees
when they only earned bachelor of arts de
grees. One individual accepted to attend the
University alleged receiving a degree before
he had finished his education here.
The Diploma Service Company, operating
out of Marina Del Ray, Calif, is one company
which required only a letter indicating one
had lost a diploma and a copy would be sent
fora $10 fee. Houghton had a hand in halting
the sale of diplomas by this company. "They
wanted an affidavit saying I had lost my dip
loma but it didn't have to be notarized."
Houghton then wrote the company a "basic

letter saying I had gone to Stanford and lost
my diploma and wanted a diploma with a
master's degree in economics." For $45,
Houghton was issued a degree.
Phony diplomas banned
The Superior Court in Los Angeles re
cently issued an injunction banning the Dip
loma Service Company's sale of phony dip
lomas. Houghton explained that "the state
of California was aware of the Diploma Ser
vice Company's actions and had had similar
experiences. It happened that I got into it at
the same time and got some local publicity
which strengthened the state's desire to
wind the matter up."
Unfortunately, it seems likely that a sig
nificant number of fraudulent claims and
fake diplomas go undetected, Houghton
said. The University, because of its prestige,
is a highly vulnerable target for degree
claimers. What can be done to prevent these
bold individuals from parading degrees
they've never earned?
Most frequently, people will claim
graduate degrees from the University on ap
plications and resumes. Houghton
speculated that the Registrar's office is "un
able to confirm about one call a week at
tempting to verify a degree." This may be
because an individual's name has changed
but often the degree requested was never
obtained here.
When a call comes in, Ernestine Jones, the
information secretary at the Registrar's of
fice, does an exhaustive search to see if
there is any record of the degree. If a degree
can't be verified, Houghton's office writes
those individuals alleging degrees. This let
ter inquires whether the University has up

dated information on the applicant's correct
name. He warns that "falsely claiming a Stan
ford degree is a serious offense which could
lead to legal action."
Houghton said that few people respond to
these letters and taking legal action is tricky.
Houghton asked Cassius Kirk, business
manager at Menlo College, to research the
questions of legal recourse. Kirk said that
when an employer discovers a false claim,
the employee may be dismissed but taking
"civil action is usually too expensive for a
company."
Legal difficulties
Houghton said itisdifficultforthe Univer
sity to prosecute false degree claimers. "In
civil action you have to show damages. It's
hard for Stanford to build up a case indicat
ing damage has been done."
Occasionally, federal and state govern
ments are able to prosecute those making
fraudulent claims. Kirk indicated that forg
ing a degree violates certain California state
educational codes and is a criminal of
fense." In past years, the federal govern
ment has been able to take action against
those falsely claiming degrees on federal
applications. Houghton said that "last year
on the East Coast, someone was tried for
falsely claiming a Stanford degree on a fed
eral application that he signed his name to."
This individual was eventually convicted of
perjury.
But the University.and other ,choolslailing
victim to so-called-grads, is relatively help
less in preventing its name from being mis
used.
Frequently, employers and graduate
schools don't bother to check a degree claim

with the University. Yet, Houghton ques
tions whose responsibility it is to halt the
process. It is certainly to the mutual benefit
of employers and universities not to have
people palming off degrees they don't have.
But, Houghton pointed out, "It is also stu
dents with real degrees that are losing."
Actions to take
Houghton suggested some actions both
employers and students could take to re
duce false degree claims.
Houghton encourages "Stanford grads in
any job or academic situation to check with
the University if they encounter someone
they don't believe went to Stanford and says
he did." In the past, Houghton indicated
that false claims have been discovered this
way. According to Houghton, "The Univer
sity guarantees confidentiality to those mak
ing inquiries if they wish it." The University
uses a special type of paper and a seal on its
transcripts to thwart potential forgers.
Employers and students should be aware of
these designations. In addition, the Univer
sity discourages students being asked to
give companies transcripts, Houghton
said.
According to Houghton, companies and
graduate schools should always ask to con
firm a degree and should "establish hiring
procedures that include verification of de
grees." Only with such measures will per
sons claiming degrees be detected.
Students here sometimes question why
they attend the University anyway. One be
nefit should now seem clear. At least stu
dents don't have to lie when they shine
those Stanford diplomas on graduation day.
