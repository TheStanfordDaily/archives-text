Parlez-vous francais? Quieres hablar espanol
mas mejor? Do you speak French? Would you
like to speak Spanish better? Maybe you would
like to improve your English. The International
Language Exchange Program here at Bechtel
l-Center offers students the opportunity to in
crease their language proficiency.
'The facility offers an informal basis for stu
dents to practice a language," said program
coordinator Kathy Minckler, a junior, who re
established the program earlier this year
through Bechtel. When she went to sign up to
learn Portuguese, Minckler found the program
defunct and decided to revive it.
The program works on two levels. First, in the
one-to-one program, a student looks through a
card file and matches himself with someone
who knows the language he wishes to learn. The
student then works on a one-to-one basis with
his "tutor." In turn, the tutor learns the lan
guage his student knows. Hence, the program
requires that each participant wants to learn the
language of the individual he works with. The
card file is located on the second floor of
Bechtel.
The second level works on a group basis. In
terested parties may set up group instruction by
contacting Mitch Hall who works at the center.
So far response has not been great, to either
possibility.

"Essentially, it's an organizationless arrange
ment," said senior James Robinson, who signed
up to learn Korean and Chinese. So far he hasn't
been reached by anyone knowing these lan
guages who wants to learn English, the language
he offers to instruct.
There are from 40 to 50 people in the program,
with the majority being foreign graduate stu
dents. Minckler says only a very small percen
tage of Americans are participating in the prog
ram. "We would like to reach those students
going overseas. There are many people willing
to help with speaking a language, homework
and checking compositions. It's an especially
good way to learn the idioms of a language,"
Minckler said.
The major reason for the failure of the cross
referencing system of the program is that
people don't make the time to go to Bechtel and
look through the files for a match. In contacting
students to comment on the effectiveness of the
program and their experiences, many said that
they had not been to the center to iook through
the files after they had initially deposited their
requests. Minckler said that the program lives
on its own and that "it is beneficial to students
who seek the help."
Since funding for the program comes only
from Bechtel, the advertising campaign is rela
tively small.
