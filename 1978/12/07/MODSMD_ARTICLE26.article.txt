# Fraternity finds home in Manzanita
## 
### SUE GOLDFARB 
Trailer 3X looks like any
other trailer in Manzanita
Trailer Park, almost. A small
sign hangs above the front
door that reads, "Phi Kappa
Psi."
Trailer 3X has an unusual
function. It serves as the
"house" for Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity. Its walls are adorned
with a banner, a fraternity char
ter and various photos of
fraternity members.
But why is a fraternity
housed in the trailers? Aren't
all frats located on frat row?
Phi Kappa Psi, the oldest
fraternity here, was organized
in 1891. Until their house was
built, members of the frater
nity lived in Leland Stanford's
home.
In 1970, Phi Kappa Psi, lo
cated at 550 San Juan, went
co-ed, although it remained
the residence of the fraternity.
According to sophomore Rico
Hernandez, vice-president of
Phi Kappa Psi, the house be
came a Universiy non-frat
house between 1972 and 1975.
The house maintains the
name Phi Psi, but has dropped
the middle letter Kappa to dis
tinguish it, a co-ed coop, from
the fraternity.
In the spring of 1976, Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity was re
founded. In last year's housing
draw, three of the 16 frat mem
bers decided to cohabitate in a
traiier, in order to provide an
on-campus meeting place for
the fraternity. Other fraterity
members live elsewhere on
and off-campus.
"We obviously don't have
the same kind of cohesiveness
as frats who live together.
We're looking for a different
kind. Their cohesiveness is
forced while ours is looser and
more enjoyable," John Han
sen, president of the fraternity,
said.
"A house to us isn't impor
tant. We think the sense of
brotherhood is more impor

tant. When we rush, we can't
sell a house; we can only sell
ourselves," Hernandez said.
But Phi Psi co-op members
disagree. "They'd love to take
over our house," senior De
nnis McEnnerney, resident as
sistant (RA), said.
Since the fraternity's return,
several problems have arisen,
say Phi Psi spokesmen.
Phi Kappa Psi alumni have
gone through the Phi Psi house
trying to reclaim things that
they say are rightfully theirs. A
stained glass window that al
legedly had sentimental value
to frat members was taken, a
Phi Psi spokesman said.
"Most of the things that are
important to them aren't im
portant to us, so we'll give
them most everything they
want," McEnnerney said. "But
we don't want people appear
ing periodically to scrounge
around for things, which is
what's been happening."
Among the items the frater
nity members wish to reclaim
are songbooks, scrapbooks
and other fraternity parapher
nalia.
A proposed solution to the
problem is for fraternity mem
bers to present a list of the
items they want to reclaim to
Phi Psi house members.
McEnnerney also said that
since the fraternity's return
there has been "all kinds of
confusion." A lot of people still
think the Phi Psi house is the
fraternity and people belong
ing to Phi Kappa Psi from other
campuses have called Phi Psi
fora place to stay, McEnnerney
said. "Lots of things refer to
our house as Phi Kappa Psi
even though we're Phi Psi
House."
"Alums think of the old Phi
Psi House sentimentally.
Realistically, our repossession
of their house is unlikely.
Alumni and nationals are work
ing on a couple of housing
leads, but Norm Robinson has
told us that sororities will have

priority over us in order to
bring the fraterity-sorority sys
tem into equilibrium. I don't
expect to live in a Phi Psi
House, but I would like to see it
eventually," Hansen said.
Like all fraternities here, Phi
Kappa Psi is a member of the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
"We are a fraternity. The only
thing we don't have is a
house," Hernandez said.
However, the fraternity is
exempt from the housing
quota system. The system re
quires fraternities to meet bid
quota requirements. The bid
requirement is based on the
previous year's demand for all

University housing. The pur
pose of the quota system is to
force fraternities to absorb
some of the over-demand for
University housing each year.
In addition to weekly meet
ings, Phi Kappa Psi members
eat dinner together one night a
week and hold approximately
two social functions every
three weeks.
"The most important thing is
maintaining the chapter. That
involves a sense of brother
hood and community. Joining
Phi Kappa Psi is an opportunity
to be involved in a fraternity
without living in an all-male
situation," Hernandez said.
