# Americans consuming more wine
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Ameri
cans now drink almost twice as
much wine as orange juice a
year, the Agriculture Depart
ment says.
Wine consumption in 1976
— the latest year for which fi
gures are available — was a re
cord seven quarts a person, ac
cording to new findings by two
department economists.
That compares to the mythi
cal average American's yearly
consumption of about four
quarts of orange juice and 132
quarts of milk, other depart
ment figures show.
In the early 19605, a typical
American drank less than four
quarts of wine a year.
A soon-to-be-published re
port on wine drinking based on
research by economists
Raymond Folwell and John
Baritelle shows that California
continues to dominate Ameri
can wine production, account
ing for 80 percent of the U.S.
wine flow.
The new issue of the de
partment's Farm Index
magazine notes several obser
vations from the economists'
wide-ranging study, which was
based on a scientifically
selected sample of 7000
households around the coun
try.
Among those observations:
— Almost four out of 10 non
drinkers said they abstain for
religious or personal reasons.
But the majority "indicated
they didn't know much abut
wine and therefore were reluc
tant to try it."
— Regular drinkers with
higher incomes, better educa
tion and smaller families prefer
table and sparkling wines.
