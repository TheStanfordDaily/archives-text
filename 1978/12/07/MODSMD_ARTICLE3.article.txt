# Senate retracts Bhutto offer
## 
### ROB LEMPERT Senior staff writer 
After a seven-hour debate Monday
night, the ASSU Senate voted to re
scind its offer of a guest professor
ship to former Pakistani prime minis
ter Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, arguing that
his conduct while in office does not
make him worthy of such an
academic honor.
The senate annulled their earlier
offer by a vote of 13-4, two votes
more than the required two-thirds
majority. At the first tally, the motion
fell one vote short, but at the last
moment, Sen. Tom Gart switched his
vote so that "such an overwhelming
majority would not go down to de
feat." Sen. Ted Gardenswartz sub
sequently followed Cart's lead, re
versing his own vote.
The senate's resolution recalls
their earlier invitation, but still re
tains the appeal for clemency.
A large contingent of students
from the sub-continent spoke to the
senate for several hours, accusing
Bhutto of misdeeds ranging from
rigging the 1977 parlimentary elec
tions in his country to giving his tacit
approval to the destruction of the
University of Dacca in the 1971 civil
war with East Pakistan, now called
Bangladesh.
Graduate senator Robert Shearer
said, "We have a right to interfere in
Pakistan if it is for a humanitarian
cause," but added, "I cannot bestow
an academic honor on a man who sat
by and watched the University of
Dacca burn."
After he was deposed in a military
coup last year, Bhutto was tried and
then sentenced to death for ordering
the 1974 murder of a political oppo
nent's father. In an effort to give the
present Pakistani government an al
ternative to executing their still
popular predecessor, the senate
voted last month to offer the guest
professorship to Bhutto.
At the start of Monday's meeting,
former attorney general Ramsey
Clark spoke to the senate via a phone
hook-up from New York to urge the
body to uphold their offer.
"The fundamental issue involves
what kind of world we want to live in
and what the purpose of a university
is," Clark said.
Clark argued that Bhutto's execu
tion would set a dangerous prece
dent.
"It means that governments have a
new and cunning way of getting rid
of their predecessors. Instead of
shooting them down and being ac
cused of murder, the government
accuses its opponents of murder and
executes them instead."
Clark, who attended part of Bhut
to's trial, said it was not a fair pro
ceeding. "They have not de
monstrated any facts that would call
for a grand jury indictment, much
less a conviction," he said.
Sen. Erik Thompson asked Clark
whether it was right for the students
here to interfere with Pakistani af
fairs, and the former attorney gen
eral responded, "all humanity has an
obligation to interfere when human
rights are being violated."

Anjum Mir, a Pakistani student
here, said, "one can make an appeal
for justice with closed eyes, because
one is appealing to a general princi
ple," but that offering a guest profes
sorship is a different matter.
Mir said that the offer will have lit
tle short-range effect because if the
Pakistani government wants to exe
cute Bhutto, it will, no matter what
the senate does.
He added, however, that the offer
could have dangerous long range
consequences. "In Pakistani politics
the sanction of authority is impor
tant," he said. In a country with an 80
percent illiteracy rate, Mir said
Bhutto could use the Stanford offer
as a justification to the Pakistani
people for his actions in office.
Mir also said he worried about the
effect on the Pakistani judicial sys
tem. This time, the government had
an open trial, he said, and they got
foreign interference, "Next time
they won't have a trial."
john Robinson, a student at Ox
ford when that university refused to
grant Bhutto an honorary degree,
said that the issue discussed at Ox
ford was "the wholesale destruction
of the University of Dacca." Bhutto
later promoted the general who de
stroyed the Pakistani institution.
Robinson said that Stanford would
become the laughing stock of the
academic world by offering a profes
sorship to a man who had condoned
the razing of a university.

Steve Tappel, a spokesman for
Amnesty International, said that his
organization considered the offer an
action much stronger than a mere
plea for clemency. However, he
added that his organization has not
adopted Bhutto as a prisoner of con
science because there is the possibil
ity that he has used or mandated vio
lence.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), who had first suggested the
idea of inviting Bhutto here, said he
was sorry the senate withdrew their
offer. He said that his one worry is
that the Pakistani government might
take this decision as a sign that
foreign opinion is turning against
Bhutto and that it will be safe to exe
cute him.
"Stanford's withdrawal could play
a part," he added, "but it's a judg
ment call on the senate's part."
Before the vote, Gardenswartz
said he had a "moral tug-of-war" in
side himself. "This has more ramifi
cations than we originally sus
pected," he added.
Sen. Jim Esserman said, "I would
certainly go listen to him if he comes,
but he has committed actions such
that I wouldn't want him to come
here."
Sen. Mark Morris said, "I will not
stick my finger into another country
and say 'you must release him.'
Bhutto is different (than otTier politi
cal prisoners) He is involved in a jud
icial proceeding in his own country."

the sanction of authority is impor
tant," he said. In a country with an 80
percent illiteracy rate, Mir said
Bhutto could use the Stanford offer
as a justification to the Pakistani
people for his actions in office.
Mir also said he worried about the
effect on the Pakistani judicial sys
tem. This time, the government had
an open trial, he said, and they got
foreign interference, "Next time
they won't have a trial."
john Robinson, a student at Ox
ford when that university refused to
grant Bhutto an honorary degree,
said that the issue discussed at Ox
ford was "the wholesale destruction
of the University of Dacca." Bhutto
later promoted the general who de
stroyed the Pakistani institution.
Robinson said that Stanford would
become the laughing stock of the
academic world by offering a profes
sorship to a man who had condoned
the razing of a university.

Steve Tappel, a spokesman for
Amnesty International, said that his
organization considered the offer an
action much stronger than a mere
plea for clemency. However, he
added that his organization has not
adopted Bhutto as a prisoner of con
science because there is the possibil
ity that he has used or mandated vio
lence.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), who had first suggested the
idea of inviting Bhutto here, said he
was sorry the senate withdrew their
offer. He said that his one worry is
that the Pakistani government might
take this decision as a sign that
foreign opinion is turning against
Bhutto and that it will be safe to exe
cute him.
"Stanford's withdrawal could play
a part," he added, "but it's a judg
ment call on the senate's part."
Before the vote, Gardenswartz
said he had a "moral tug-of-war" in
side himself. "This has more ramifi
cations than we originally sus
pected," he added.
Sen. Jim Esserman said, "I would
certainly go listen to him if he comes,
but he has committed actions such
that I wouldn't want him to come
here."
Sen. Mark Morris said, "I will not
stick my finger into another country
and say 'you must release him.'
Bhutto is different (than otTier politi
cal prisoners) He is involved in a jud
icial proceeding in his own country."
After a seven-hour debate Monday
night, the ASSU Senate voted to re
scind its offer of a guest professor
ship to former Pakistani prime minis
ter Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, arguing that
his conduct while in office does not
make him worthy of such an
academic honor.
The senate annulled their earlier
offer by a vote of 13-4, two votes
more than the required two-thirds
majority. At the first tally, the motion
fell one vote short, but at the last
moment, Sen. Tom Gart switched his
vote so that "such an overwhelming
majority would not go down to de
feat." Sen. Ted Gardenswartz sub
sequently followed Cart's lead, re
versing his own vote.
The senate's resolution recalls
their earlier invitation, but still re
tains the appeal for clemency.
A large contingent of students
from the sub-continent spoke to the
senate for several hours, accusing
Bhutto of misdeeds ranging from
rigging the 1977 parlimentary elec
tions in his country to giving his tacit
approval to the destruction of the
University of Dacca in the 1971 civil
war with East Pakistan, now called
Bangladesh.
Graduate senator Robert Shearer
said, "We have a right to interfere in
Pakistan if it is for a humanitarian
cause," but added, "I cannot bestow
an academic honor on a man who sat
by and watched the University of
Dacca burn."
After he was deposed in a military
coup last year, Bhutto was tried and
then sentenced to death for ordering
the 1974 murder of a political oppo
nent's father. In an effort to give the
present Pakistani government an al
ternative to executing their still
popular predecessor, the senate
voted last month to offer the guest
professorship to Bhutto.
At the start of Monday's meeting,
former attorney general Ramsey
Clark spoke to the senate via a phone
hook-up from New York to urge the
body to uphold their offer.
"The fundamental issue involves
what kind of world we want to live in
and what the purpose of a university
is," Clark said.
Clark argued that Bhutto's execu
tion would set a dangerous prece
dent.
"It means that governments have a
new and cunning way of getting rid
of their predecessors. Instead of
shooting them down and being ac
cused of murder, the government
accuses its opponents of murder and
executes them instead."
Clark, who attended part of Bhut
to's trial, said it was not a fair pro
ceeding. "They have not de
monstrated any facts that would call
for a grand jury indictment, much
less a conviction," he said.
Sen. Erik Thompson asked Clark
whether it was right for the students
here to interfere with Pakistani af
fairs, and the former attorney gen
eral responded, "all humanity has an
obligation to interfere when human
rights are being violated."

Anjum Mir, a Pakistani student
here, said, "one can make an appeal
for justice with closed eyes, because
one is appealing to a general princi
ple," but that offering a guest profes
sorship is a different matter.
Mir said that the offer will have lit
tle short-range effect because if the
Pakistani government wants to exe
cute Bhutto, it will, no matter what
the senate does.
He added, however, that the offer
could have dangerous long range
consequences. "In Pakistani politics

University of Dacca in the 1971 civil
war with East Pakistan, now called
Bangladesh.
Graduate senator Robert Shearer
said, "We have a right to interfere in
Pakistan if it is for a humanitarian
cause," but added, "I cannot bestow
an academic honor on a man who sat
by and watched the University of
Dacca burn."
After he was deposed in a military
coup last year, Bhutto was tried and
then sentenced to death for ordering
the 1974 murder of a political oppo
nent's father. In an effort to give the
present Pakistani government an al
ternative to executing their still
popular predecessor, the senate
voted last month to offer the guest
professorship to Bhutto.
At the start of Monday's meeting,
former attorney general Ramsey
Clark spoke to the senate via a phone
hook-up from New York to urge the
body to uphold their offer.
"The fundamental issue involves
what kind of world we want to live in
and what the purpose of a university
is," Clark said.
Clark argued that Bhutto's execu
tion would set a dangerous prece
dent.
"It means that governments have a
new and cunning way of getting rid
of their predecessors. Instead of
shooting them down and being ac
cused of murder, the government
accuses its opponents of murder and
executes them instead."
Clark, who attended part of Bhut
to's trial, said it was not a fair pro
ceeding. "They have not de
monstrated any facts that would call
for a grand jury indictment, much
less a conviction," he said.
Sen. Erik Thompson asked Clark
whether it was right for the students
here to interfere with Pakistani af
fairs, and the former attorney gen
eral responded, "all humanity has an
obligation to interfere when human
rights are being violated."

Anjum Mir, a Pakistani student
here, said, "one can make an appeal
for justice with closed eyes, because
one is appealing to a general princi
ple," but that offering a guest profes
sorship is a different matter.
Mir said that the offer will have lit
tle short-range effect because if the
Pakistani government wants to exe
cute Bhutto, it will, no matter what
the senate does.
He added, however, that the offer
could have dangerous long range
consequences. "In Pakistani politics
the sanction of authority is impor
tant," he said. In a country with an 80
percent illiteracy rate, Mir said
Bhutto could use the Stanford offer
as a justification to the Pakistani
people for his actions in office.
Mir also said he worried about the
effect on the Pakistani judicial sys
tem. This time, the government had
an open trial, he said, and they got
foreign interference, "Next time
they won't have a trial."
john Robinson, a student at Ox
ford when that university refused to
grant Bhutto an honorary degree,
said that the issue discussed at Ox
ford was "the wholesale destruction
of the University of Dacca." Bhutto
later promoted the general who de
stroyed the Pakistani institution.
Robinson said that Stanford would
become the laughing stock of the
academic world by offering a profes
sorship to a man who had condoned
the razing of a university.

Steve Tappel, a spokesman for
Amnesty International, said that his
organization considered the offer an
action much stronger than a mere
plea for clemency. However, he
added that his organization has not
adopted Bhutto as a prisoner of con
science because there is the possibil
ity that he has used or mandated vio
lence.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), who had first suggested the
idea of inviting Bhutto here, said he
was sorry the senate withdrew their
offer. He said that his one worry is
that the Pakistani government might
take this decision as a sign that
foreign opinion is turning against
Bhutto and that it will be safe to exe
cute him.
"Stanford's withdrawal could play
a part," he added, "but it's a judg
ment call on the senate's part."
Before the vote, Gardenswartz
said he had a "moral tug-of-war" in
side himself. "This has more ramifi
cations than we originally sus
pected," he added.
Sen. Jim Esserman said, "I would
certainly go listen to him if he comes,
but he has committed actions such
that I wouldn't want him to come
here."
Sen. Mark Morris said, "I will not
stick my finger into another country
and say 'you must release him.'
Bhutto is different (than otTier politi
cal prisoners) He is involved in a jud
icial proceeding in his own country."
After a seven-hour debate Monday
night, the ASSU Senate voted to re
scind its offer of a guest professor
ship to former Pakistani prime minis
ter Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, arguing that
his conduct while in office does not
make him worthy of such an
academic honor.
The senate annulled their earlier
offer by a vote of 13-4, two votes
more than the required two-thirds
majority. At the first tally, the motion
fell one vote short, but at the last
moment, Sen. Tom Gart switched his
vote so that "such an overwhelming
majority would not go down to de
feat." Sen. Ted Gardenswartz sub
sequently followed Cart's lead, re
versing his own vote.
The senate's resolution recalls
their earlier invitation, but still re
tains the appeal for clemency.
A large contingent of students
from the sub-continent spoke to the
senate for several hours, accusing
Bhutto of misdeeds ranging from
rigging the 1977 parlimentary elec
tions in his country to giving his tacit
approval to the destruction of the
University of Dacca in the 1971 civil
war with East Pakistan, now called
Bangladesh.
