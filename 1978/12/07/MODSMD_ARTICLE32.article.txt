Is there a student directory being published
this year? If yes, why is it taking so long?
- W.H.B.
The student directory will be available to stu
dents tomorrow, according to Ray Thomas,
chairman of the ASSU Publications Board. Di
rectories will be distributed through student re
sidences.
"Last year's directory came out on Tuesday of
Dead Week, but we've had a delay due to the
paper shortage," Thomas explained. "The shor
tage is a result of a continuing strike of the North
American Paper Mills. Most printers, except for
the big newspapers, have had to get their paper
on the black market," he said.
Does not the fact that the Roble Gym has a
women-only sunbathing area violate Title /X?
After all, the men used to have such an area at
the Encina Gym, but it was "integrated" by
women and subsequently closed. The whole
spirit of Title IX is "if they have one, we can have
one too." Shouldn't that cut both ways?
-R.S.
"The only entrance to the sunbathing area is
through the women's locker room. Itwould not
be possible to open that entrance to men," said
Cindy Cannon, secretary to the Athletics De
partment. Wesley Ruff, chairman of the depart
ment commented, "I tend to agree that it is
unfair. There should be men's and women's
hours."

A friend of mine says that the fast food outlets
like Mac Donalds and Jack-in-the-Box put wax in
their milkshakes to make them thicker. First of
all, is this true? And secondly, is there any legis
lation which requires such outlets to make avail
able information about the contents ot the food
that they sell? _

"The agriculture code specifies what is al
lowed in the shake mixture. All the ingredients
are fresh and wholesome, said Roy Sharp of
Santa Clara County Environmental Health Ser
vices. A spokeswoman from the purchasing de
partment of Mac Donald Corp. said that whole
milk or cream, sugar, butter fats and stabilizers
are the ingredients in their milkshakes.
"Stabilizers are added to improve the thickness
of the shakes. They are added to many milk
products," she said.
Although there is no legislation in this
consumers are protected by a "Truth in Menu
law, according to the Consumer Complaint and
Protection Coordinators. "That is the reason
that the lack Steak can't be called a steak when it
is really flaked and formed beef," one of the
coordinators explained.

Is there a student directory being published
this year? If yes, why is it taking so long?
- W.H.B.
The student directory will be available to stu
