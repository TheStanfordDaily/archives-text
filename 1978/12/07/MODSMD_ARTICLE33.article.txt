# Sex-based differences in aptitude shown

If the findings of a recent study done
by two psychologists here are correct,
then perhaps men ought to seriously
consider letting their wives and
girlfriends do the driving at night.
Psychology Prot. Karl Pribram and re
search psychologist Diane McGuin
ness, have developed a new hypothesis
concerning the relationship of cogni
tive differences and their physical man
ifestations.
In their soon-to-be-published study,
Pribram and Mc(<uinness claim that
women see better in the dark, but that
men have better daylight vision. Men
are more accomplished at tasks which
involve utilization of large motor move
ments, but women are better equipped
for any kind of fine muscular move

ment, according to the study.
"Girls are communicative, and boys
are, by and large, manipulative," the
study adds. This means that the cogni
tive organization of the male is such
that he is geared toward mechanical
abilities. The female, on the other
hand, develops communication skills at
a much earlier age and with greater pro
ficiency.
"Of course, there are always excep
tions," said Pribram. "You're always
going to tind girls and boysat the oppo
site ends of their spectrums.
Boys and girls, men and women have
varying aptitudes for basic sensory and
spacial functions. Pribram and Mc-
Guinness trace these differences to
gender variations in the make-up of the
brain.
In other words, children have physi

cal differences which cause them to de
velop skills and abilities in different
areas. Much research has been done to
determine just how early some of these
differences become evident, and what
effect they have on the further de
velopment of the individual.
One study cited in Pribram and Mc-
Guinness' research showed that female
babies are able to distinguish and re
spond to different photographs of
people. At the age of six weeks the in
fant girls responded enthusiastically to
sequences of facial photographs. Boy
babies showed little or no response to
the same series.
Boys, however, have an affinity for
object recognition at an equally early
age. When shown a three-dimensional
object, the male infants became com

pletely engrossed, and responded
quickly when the position ot the object
was changed. Female babies quickly
became disinterested with the object,
and showed no reaction when the ob
ject was removed.
According to the study, this early
male curiosity about the men hanical
world leads to a faster development of
the spacial skills needed later for
three-dimensional mathematics and
physics. At an early age, boys begin to
explore physical objects. This
problem-solving affinity later develops
into an aptitude for more involved
mechanical situations.
Girls, who are termed, "communica
tive creatures" in the study, are usually
the first to learn to speak. As babies,
they learn facial recognition much ear
lier than boys.
