## 
### ROBIN MILINGTON 
Several students here
tired of waiting for some
one else to get the Equal
Rights Amendment passed"
are organizing a group to
help encourage the ratifica
tion of that amendment.
Group spokesman Susan
Brookstone said, "the goal
ot the group would be to
educate people of the
simplicity and the necessity
ot adopting the ERA, and
after educating them, en
courage them to take ac
tion."
The as-yet-unnamed
group held its first organiza
tional meeting last week.
Involve people
According to Brookstone,
the group would like to in
volve people who are not
"necessarily activists but
who would like to help."
A major group goal is to
encourage letter writing as a
means of constituent pres
sure lor the passage ot I RA.
Although the group
would like to see letters sent
to every state capital and to
legislators, Brookstone said
that the pressure will prob
ably be concentrated on
states which have not yet
ratified the ERA, especially

Illinois, Nevada and Florida.
Not only will letter writing
put pressure on unratified
states, but it will "provide
something for people in
ratified states to do," said
Susanne Case, another
group organizer.
Brookstone said the
group plans to initiate the
letter campaign by first
holding outreach educa
tional programs and then
instituting letter writing.
The group will be working
with other organizations.
According to Brookstone,
members of NOW and
CROW were expec ted to be
at the White Plaza informa
tion booth set up during
dead week to distribute in
formation on the ERA.
Brookstone said she be
lieved the amendment
hasn't passed because the
opposition has been much
more organized and active
than ERA supporters.
Site said she believed that
"Political actions are pretty
much influenced by the de
sire of the constituents and
the more the politicians are
informed of what the con
stituents want, the more re
sponsive they will be to the
people's desires."
