# Prof says sexism pervades classroom
## 
### DIANNE CAHOON 
Norma Juliet Wikler, assis
tant professor of sociology at
UC-Santa Cruz, claims that
sexist attitudes often pervade
the college classroom and may
adversely affect the careers of
women professors.
Speaking at the Nov. 15
meeting of the Center for Re
search on Women's (CROW)
fall lecture series, Wikler fo
cused upon the "double-bind"
dilemma common to many
professional women.
She explained that if a
woman acts in the "male"
style, which is often perceived
as being assertive and domin
ant, she is likely to be judged as
unfeeling and is resented.
However, a woman displaying
warmth and the stereotypical
"female" traits is vulnerable to
the loss of respect and author
ity.
Wikler received a bachelor's
degree in nursing from the
University of Michigan and
continued her M.A. and Ph.D.
studies at UC-Berkeley. She
has researched the lives of
women in the United States
and France and the problems
faced by working women in
various fields.
Currently, she has a contract
for a book entitled Up Against

the Clock: Career Women Over
30 and is analyzing data col
lected over the past decade on
the potency of sex-role expec
tations in the academic realm
of student-professor relation
ships.
Curiosity
Wikier said her interest was a
matter of curiosity enhanced
by her own personal experi
ence. In recounting a meeting
among 35 female faculty mem
bers at UCSC in 1973, she said
she observed that "many were
noticing, despite the rhetoric
among students of anti-sexism,
the presence of in-class sexist
dynamics; that, in fact, gender
did make a difference."
She began her investigation
of this "dynamic" at the faculty
level. Seventy percent of the 30
UCSC female faculty respon
dents to an exploratory ques
tionnaire and interview session
said they felt that gender influ
enced their classroom atmos
phere. Although most were
happy in their roles and rela
tionships with students, they
held the impression that they
were accorded a special status
based upon sex.
Recurrent themes drawn
from this study were that
women professors believed
students expected them to be

more open, to offer easier
courses, to be more lenient, to
be more interested in personal
issues and to give easier exams
than their male colleagues.
Quandary created
One female social scientist
summed up the quandary
created by such illusions. "I
feel as if I cannot win in the
classroom. If I'm organized
and professional,' students
perceive me as cold and reject
ing. If I'm open and responsive
and warm, I seem to be chal
lenged and taken advantage of,
perhaps considered not quite
as bright."
Wikler concluded that, even
in the highly structured role of
professor, women sensed they
had to prove themselves to
achieve the same authority au
tomatically given a man in the
same position.
Many women instructors
were distressed by the intense
criticism of female students
with whom they sympathized.
Wikler referred to a type of
"fallen angel" syndrome.
A female student echoed
that sentiment. "I know I have
different expectations of many
women professors. I want
women to be fantastic, to really
know their stuff. There are so
many men professors, it really

doesn't matter if they aren't
competent. But women are
paving the way for other wo
men, so they better be good."
Major factors
Wikler said she discovered
class size and lormat to be
major factors in sexism in the
classroom.
Sexism increases propor
tionately with class size, ac
cording to Wikler. "The prob
able explanation is that large
lectures require male' traits
such as a strong commanding
voice, decisiveness and au
thoritative posture, while smal
ler classes provide a context for
expressiveness, nurturance
and a more subordinate role
for the instructor."
Santa Cruz women who co
taught courses with men
acknowledged a tendency by
students to assume that the
man was "in charge." Wikler
decided that for the students
"it's a question of seeing mom
and dad up there, and they just
can't overcome" the tendency
to expect the professors to as
sume familial roles.
Subject matter
Finally, subject matter
played a significant part in de
termining the woman profes
sor's image. A 1974 UCLA
course evaluation analysis con

firmed the Santa Cruz faculty
belief that women are more ac
cepted when teaching in less
controversial fields dependent
upon established fact.
The annual report of the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women
(CEEW) here stated that only
two appointments to the ranks
of associate and full professor,
among 30 in the past two years,
have been to women.
Committee member Byron
Brown said that the CEEW had
not looked into student rela
tionships with women profes
sors as a possible reason for
ihat declining figure. He
added that such a study would
"be interesting" to ascertain
the prevalence of a "sexist
dynamic" in the classroom
here.
