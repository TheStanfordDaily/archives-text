# Trial date set for deLeeuw murder
## 
### KURT COBB 
Two court-appointed doctors have
determined that Theodore Streleski
is competent to stand trial for the
Aug. 18 murder of Mathematics Prof.
Karl deLeeuw. A Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge received the
doctors' report Monday and set a
trial date for ]an. 3.
The trial was originally scheduled
to begin on Nov. 29, but criminal
proceedings were suspended on
Nov. 15 toallow timefora psychiatric
evaluation of Streleski by doctors.
Streleski's court-appointed lawyer,
James Blackman, said that at that
time Streleski refused to enter a plea
of not guilty by reason of insanity.
"I suggested to the court that there
might be some question of his com
petency," Blackman said. The court
overruled objections by the prosecu
tion and decided to have Streleski
examined, he explained.
Blackman is not Streleski's first
lawyer. Streleski was represented by
Howard Siegal of the Santa Clara
County Public Defender's Office.
Blackman was appointed by the
court on Oct. 18 after the public de
fender decided that there was a
"conflict of interest" on his part in
the case.
On Sept. 19, a search warrant sec
ured by the district attorney was
served on the Public Defender's Of
fice. It was used to obtain articles
taken from Streleski's San Francisco
apartment by the public defender in
preparation for his defense. Siegal,
who was representing Streleski at the
time, vowed to challenge the validity
of the warrant in court. He indicated
he would request that the evidence
obtained be supressed and returned
to his possession.
The District Attorney's Office
maintained that it was entitled to the
evidence, but Siegal said the search
endangered "the right of the defense
lawyer to move in and gather defen
sive evidence."
Norwood Needham, of the Public
Defender's Office, refused to detail
the reasons why his office decided
not to continue with the case. He did

say that the decision was made by
those working on the case because
they felt they could not "ethically"
represent Streleski.
He pointed out that his office de
clines hundreds of cases every year
because of conflict of interest.
Needharn explained that a public de
fender is not obliged to reveal the
reason for the conflict. He needs
only to indicate to the judge that
such a conflict exists, before the
judge will appoint new counsel from
outside of the Public Defender's Of
fice.
DeLeeuw was found dead in his
office in the late afternoon of Aug. 18
by a janitor making cleaning rounds.
Early the next morning, Streleski
turned himself in to Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies.
An examination of deLeeuw's
body showed that his skull had been
crushed by repeated blows with a
blunt instrument.

Blackman is not Streleski's first
lawyer. Streleski was represented by
Howard Siegal of the Santa Clara
County Public Defender's Office.
Blackman was appointed by the
court on Oct. 18 after the public de
fender decided that there was a
"conflict of interest" on his part in
the case.
On Sept. 19, a search warrant sec
ured by the district attorney was
served on the Public Defender's Of
fice. It was used to obtain articles
taken from Streleski's San Francisco
apartment by the public defender in
preparation for his defense. Siegal,
who was representing Streleski at the
time, vowed to challenge the validity
of the warrant in court. He indicated
he would request that the evidence
obtained be supressed and returned
to his possession.
The District Attorney's Office
maintained that it was entitled to the
evidence, but Siegal said the search
endangered "the right of the defense
lawyer to move in and gather defen
sive evidence."
Norwood Needham, of the Public
Defender's Office, refused to detail
the reasons why his office decided
not to continue with the case. He did

say that the decision was made by
those working on the case because
they felt they could not "ethically"
represent Streleski.
He pointed out that his office de
clines hundreds of cases every year
because of conflict of interest.
Needharn explained that a public de
fender is not obliged to reveal the
reason for the conflict. He needs
only to indicate to the judge that
such a conflict exists, before the
judge will appoint new counsel from
outside of the Public Defender's Of
fice.
DeLeeuw was found dead in his
office in the late afternoon of Aug. 18
by a janitor making cleaning rounds.
Early the next morning, Streleski
turned himself in to Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies.
An examination of deLeeuw's
body showed that his skull had been
crushed by repeated blows with a
blunt instrument.
Two court-appointed doctors have
determined that Theodore Streleski
is competent to stand trial for the
Aug. 18 murder of Mathematics Prof.
Karl deLeeuw. A Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge received the
doctors' report Monday and set a
trial date for ]an. 3.
The trial was originally scheduled
to begin on Nov. 29, but criminal
proceedings were suspended on
Nov. 15 toallow timefora psychiatric
evaluation of Streleski by doctors.
Streleski's court-appointed lawyer,
James Blackman, said that at that
time Streleski refused to enter a plea
of not guilty by reason of insanity.
"I suggested to the court that there
might be some question of his com
petency," Blackman said. The court
overruled objections by the prosecu
tion and decided to have Streleski
examined, he explained.
