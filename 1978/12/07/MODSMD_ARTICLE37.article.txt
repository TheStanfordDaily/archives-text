# Board to consider investment proposal
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
The University will receive authority to invest
available cash in high-yield, short-term invest
ments if the Board of Trustees approves a new
investment plan at its meeting next week.
Trustees are also expected to discuss plans for
new student housing facilities on campus and the
minimum donation required to endow a profes
sorship here.
The new investment plan will allow the Univer
sity to remove cash needed for expenses from
low-interest savings accounts and place the funds
in a special account with a Chicago bank.
That account involves short-term investment in
higher-yield money market instruments and al
lows for withdrawals to meet daily cash needs.
According to a trustee background report, the
University would estimate its daily cash require
ments, wire the information to Chicago and the
bank would wire the funds to the appropriate
Western bank.
Surplus money in the short-term fund could also
be invested in slightly longer-term notes through
First National City Bank and J.P. Morgan & Co.

under the proposed plan.
Investable cash has "ranged upwards to as much
as $70 million" over the past year, according to the
background report.
In other business, the board is expected to hear
an update report on proposed new University stu
dent housing facilities by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
Lyons last month gave a preliminary report on
the new dormitory.
According to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president for trustee affairs, Lyons may propose a
tentative time-table for construction of such a
facility.
The board is also expected to hear arguments
favoring an increase in the minimum donation re
quired to endow a professorship here.
Presently, endowed chairs which do not actually
add a member to the faculty require a minimum
$600,000 donation.
Under the proposed plan, that figure will rise to
$1 million.
According to Vice President for Development
)oel Smith, an average endowed professor re
ceives $40,000 in compensation plus $8000 in
fringe benefits. According to Smith, $1 million in

principal is necessary to actually cover a year's
cost.
The purpose of an endowed chair is to have a
special fund's income cover the cost of a faculty
member for a year, according to Smith.
Smith added that a survey of comparable institu
tions shows the University "at the low end" of
minimum donation requirements, with $1 million
the normal minimum.
Chairs which add a faculty member presently
must be endowed with $1 million. Smith said
under the new plan no minimum figure would be
set for such chairs, but that a starting rate of $1.5
million will be suggested.
The increase will be the first here in about a
decade.
Technically, such a move is up to President
Richard Lyman to initiate. No board action is re
quired, but Smith said discussion will be held next
week to assess board response.
Smith said the University has approached about
12 individuals concerning endowing professor
ships, and if approved, increases would not apply
to them.
The University now has over 110 endowed
chairs.

special fund's income cover the cost of a faculty
member for a year, according to Smith.
Smith added that a survey of comparable institu
tions shows the University "at the low end" of
minimum donation requirements, with $1 million
the normal minimum.
Chairs which add a faculty member presently
must be endowed with $1 million. Smith said
under the new plan no minimum figure would be
set for such chairs, but that a starting rate of $1.5
million will be suggested.
The increase will be the first here in about a
decade.
Technically, such a move is up to President
Richard Lyman to initiate. No board action is re
quired, but Smith said discussion will be held next
week to assess board response.
Smith said the University has approached about
12 individuals concerning endowing professor
ships, and if approved, increases would not apply
to them.
The University now has over 110 endowed
chairs.
The University will receive authority to invest
available cash in high-yield, short-term invest
ments if the Board of Trustees approves a new
investment plan at its meeting next week.
Trustees are also expected to discuss plans for
new student housing facilities on campus and the
minimum donation required to endow a profes
sorship here.
The new investment plan will allow the Univer
sity to remove cash needed for expenses from
low-interest savings accounts and place the funds
in a special account with a Chicago bank.
That account involves short-term investment in
higher-yield money market instruments and al
lows for withdrawals to meet daily cash needs.
According to a trustee background report, the
University would estimate its daily cash require
ments, wire the information to Chicago and the
bank would wire the funds to the appropriate
Western bank.
Surplus money in the short-term fund could also
be invested in slightly longer-term notes through
First National City Bank and J.P. Morgan & Co.

under the proposed plan.
Investable cash has "ranged upwards to as much
as $70 million" over the past year, according to the
background report.
In other business, the board is expected to hear
an update report on proposed new University stu
dent housing facilities by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
Lyons last month gave a preliminary report on
the new dormitory.
According to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president for trustee affairs, Lyons may propose a
tentative time-table for construction of such a
facility.
The board is also expected to hear arguments
favoring an increase in the minimum donation re
quired to endow a professorship here.
Presently, endowed chairs which do not actually
add a member to the faculty require a minimum
$600,000 donation.
Under the proposed plan, that figure will rise to
$1 million.
According to Vice President for Development
)oel Smith, an average endowed professor re
ceives $40,000 in compensation plus $8000 in
fringe benefits. According to Smith, $1 million in

principal is necessary to actually cover a year's
cost.
