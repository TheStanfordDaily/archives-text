# Costs to hit $7950 next year
## 
### MIKE CHARLSON Senior staff writer 
Tuition, room and board charges
will rise 8.9 percent next fall, when
the Board of Trustees approves ad
ministration recommendations for
the new rates at its meeting next
week.
Total costs will likely jump $650 to
$7950 next fall for a normal three
quarter, general tuition student.
Medical students will see a set of
complex price hikes with continuing
students paying 14.6 percent more
but newly entering students being
assessed some 27.6 percent more for
their year's work.
Continuing medical student tui
tion will rise from $5388 to $6174. En
tering students will pay $6873 for the
year.
The announcement came at a
briefing for student leaders and
press held Monday.

The weighted average of the gen
eral tuition, room and board hikes,
medical school tuition and other
charges assessed by the University
are in line with price guidelines set
by President Jimmy Carter. The
guidelines allow for an overall aver
age increase of 9.1 percent in prices
charged by the University "insofar as
we (the administration) have been
able to adequately understand and
apply" the guidelines, according to a
background report supplied to trus
tees.
Under the proposal, general tui
tion will rise 9.1 percent next fall
from $5130 to $5595. Tuition at the
law school will increase 8.8 percent
to $5744.
Room and board rates will jumpB.s
percent to $2354 from $2169 this year.
Background report
According to the background re
port, factors entering into the prop
osed figure include:
— consistency with wage-price
guidelines;
— consistency with the Universi
ty's financial plans; and
— continued accessibility of the
University to all qualified applicants
when tuition charges are offset by
financial aid.
Tuition generally comprises 50
percent of the operating budget re
venurs. This percenla({t' will con
npx i year, accordinu to
Rayrrtond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning.
He said that for planning pur
poses, the University assumed an 8
percent inflation rate next year.
Wages, which account for 67 percent
of operating budget expenses, are
limited by the wage-price guidelines
to a 7 percent hike.
Other expenses are expected to
rise by at least 8 percent, Bacchetti
said, with some expenses jumping by
a much larger rate.
Library costs, for example, will rise
by 16 percent, and recent declines in
the value of the dollar have put pres
sure on the Overseas Studies
budget.
Real growth
Real growth in income will total
about 1.9 percent, however, and that
money will be used for program im
provements, including institution of
the Western Culture requirements,
and the opening of the new Green
Library addition, among others.
Repair costs are also slated to in
crease because delayed work cannot
be delayed further, according to ad
ministrators.

According to Kent Peterson, direc
tor of management and financial
planning, some "risks" were taken
within the University during budget
cutting associated with programs de
signed to eliminate deficit budgets
here.
Those programs have now been
completed, but some of the risks will
now cost the University, Peterson
said. He said the programs resulted
in some cutting of maintenance
budgets. Some of those projects can
no longer be delayed.
A similar situation will be a major
pressure on the room and board
rate. According to Fdward Scoles,
University housing and food services
director, such costs will be 60 per
cent higher next year.
He said building code require
ments have been stiffened, neces
sitating improvements. In addition,
the buildings are getting old, so
more major work is being done.
Medical School
At the Medical School, the ad
ministration decided to make 1979-80
the year to bring tuition charges into
line with a 21 percent-oi-cost level,
according to David Hopkins, assis
tant dean for administration.
Hopkins said that a study in 1972-73
showed that it cost $16,450 per stu
dent per year for a medical educa
tion. Tuition at that time was about
$3450. or about percent of total
cost.

Hopkins said that since that time,
the principle adhered to in setting
medical student tuition levels has
been "general tuition, plus 5 per
cent."
As a result, the $5388 assessment
now comprises some 17.9 percent of
the estimated $35,000 per year it
costs to educate a student.
Other revenue sources are not
making up the difference, he said, so
the decision was made to bring tui
tion back up to a 21 percent level and
keep it there.
The differential increase for new
students versus continuing students
is linked to a new requirement on
number of quarters a student must
attend.
Presently, medical students must
pay tuition for as many quarters as it
takes to graduate.
Under the new plan, students will
have to pay for 13 quarters, but they
may attend up to 16 quarters here for
no additional charge.
The additional three quarters will
enable students to complete an orig
inal research project, Hopkins said.
He said that presently, some stu
dents complete the M.D. degree re
quirements in as few as 11 quarters,
but most students take longer. The
median number of quarters attended
is IJ, he said.
Doctoral candidates at the Med
School will he assessed the general
tuition rate, as in the past.
