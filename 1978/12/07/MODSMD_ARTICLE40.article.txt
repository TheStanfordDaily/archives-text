# Time runs out as Cards fail 1st Pac-10 exam
## 
### CHRIS HAFT 
Although it is Dead Week on
campus, it was a wild night
yesterday as the Cardinals and
USC opened the Pacific-10
basketball season in exciting
fashion before one of the most
enthusiastic gatherings in
Maples Pavilion history.
The prospect of final exams,
however, cannot be as depres
sing as the game's outcome:
USC 57, Stanford 55 — a sicken
ing reminder of last season.
The Cardinals have now lost
each of their last three games
to the Trojans by two points.
"They (the Trojans) played
excellent defense that forced
us out of our offense. Other
than that, our men played one
hell of a game," Card coach
Dick Dißiaso said, wearing a
long, drawn face.
Stanford began its final gal
lant challenge with less than
three minutes remaining and
USC on top, 51-46.
Guard Daryle Morgan hit a
free throw and a clutch driving
layup to cut the margin to two,
51-49, with 2:16 left.

(JSC's Dean Jones then beat
Stanford's fullcourt press for
an apparent breakaway basket,
but missed the easy shot. For
ward Barry Brooks atoned for
his teammate's error with a
steal and a hoop, extending the
Trojans' lead back to four.
Card center Tom Schmal
zried, a stellar offensive per
former in the late second half,
retaliated with a 10-foot jumper
at 1:38.
On USC's ensuing posses
sion, Kimberly Belton fouled
Jones, who missed the front
end of a one-and-one. After an
enormous tussle, Stanford's
Wolfe Perry came up with the
ball, which eventually found its
way to Belton.
The junior forward drove
baseline and hit a fantastic
scoop shot to tie it, 53-53, with
1:06 left.
Trojan Steve Smith's blazing
fast-break lay-in and Morgan's
two perfect free throws kept
the score knotted. USC gained
possession with 0:38 remain
ing and passed the ball around
the perimeter, looking for one

shot.
Paul Giovacchini committed
an almost imperceptible foul
on Jones with 10 seconds left.
Unfortunately for the Cards,
Jones failed to duplicate his
earlier shooting miscues and
hit both charity tosses.
Morgan rushed downcourt
for Stanford and got it to Perry,
who launched a 20-footer that
caromed high off the back rim.
The final buzzer sounded as
players continued to fight for
the rebound; for the Cards, it
was a futile effort.
Trojan coach Bob Boyd, ex
pansive in victory, said, "I
thought Stanford played an
outstanding game. They were
very good on the boards (the
Cards out-rebounded USC,
37-26)."
This contrasted with Boyd's
comments earlier in the week,
when he said, "I think we'll be
the best team that Stanford has
played, and I don't think any
one here would say they're the
best team we've played."
"For a team so filled with
confidence, they certainly

didn't show it with their stall,"
snapped Dißiaso, alluding to
Boyd's words and the short
lived spread-court offenses
employed by the Trojans when
they were leading 10-6 and
48-44.
Each club featured tight de
fense, particularly the Trojans
in the early going. Smith's off
ball pressure prevented Perry,
the Cards' high scorer this
year, from even taking a shot
over the first 10:18.
Yet Perry soon proved in
exorable, scoring 11 points in
just over six minutes to help
the Cards t to a 28-24 halftime
advantage.
Perry led Stanford with 17
points overall, followed by Bel
ton's 14 and Schmalzried's 10.
Belton added a game-high 12
rebounds.
Cliff Robinson, USC's Mr.
Everything, tallied a game-high
19 points — 5.5 below his aver
age — and grabbed just seven
rebounds. Six of his points,
however, paced a 10-2 run at
the start of the second half that
erased Stanford's lead.

Smith's 18 points on 9-for-13
shooting were also destruc
tive.
The season gets no easier for
the Cards, as they face the for
midable USF Dons in San Fran
cisco tomorrow night.

hit both charity tosses.
Morgan rushed downcourt
for Stanford and got it to Perry,
who launched a 20-footer that
caromed high off the back rim.
The final buzzer sounded as
players continued to fight for
the rebound; for the Cards, it
was a futile effort.
Trojan coach Bob Boyd, ex
pansive in victory, said, "I
thought Stanford played an
outstanding game. They were
very good on the boards (the
Cards out-rebounded USC,
37-26)."
This contrasted with Boyd's
comments earlier in the week,
when he said, "I think we'll be
the best team that Stanford has
played, and I don't think any
one here would say they're the
best team we've played."
"For a team so filled with
confidence, they certainly

didn't show it with their stall,"
snapped Dißiaso, alluding to
Boyd's words and the short
lived spread-court offenses
employed by the Trojans when
they were leading 10-6 and
48-44.
Each club featured tight de
fense, particularly the Trojans
in the early going. Smith's off
ball pressure prevented Perry,
the Cards' high scorer this
year, from even taking a shot
over the first 10:18.
Yet Perry soon proved in
exorable, scoring 11 points in
just over six minutes to help
the Cards t to a 28-24 halftime
advantage.
Perry led Stanford with 17
points overall, followed by Bel
ton's 14 and Schmalzried's 10.
Belton added a game-high 12
rebounds.
Cliff Robinson, USC's Mr.
Everything, tallied a game-high
19 points — 5.5 below his aver
age — and grabbed just seven
rebounds. Six of his points,
however, paced a 10-2 run at
the start of the second half that
erased Stanford's lead.

Smith's 18 points on 9-for-13
shooting were also destruc
tive.
The season gets no easier for
the Cards, as they face the for
midable USF Dons in San Fran
cisco tomorrow night.

Card freshman Doug Marty (22) passes over the head of USC guard
Dean |ones (12) in Stanford's 57-55 loss to the Trojans last night.
Although Marty only scored two points, he played a commendable
floor game.
Although it is Dead Week on
campus, it was a wild night
yesterday as the Cardinals and
USC opened the Pacific-10
basketball season in exciting
fashion before one of the most
enthusiastic gatherings in
Maples Pavilion history.
The prospect of final exams,
however, cannot be as depres
sing as the game's outcome:
USC 57, Stanford 55 — a sicken
ing reminder of last season.
The Cardinals have now lost
each of their last three games
to the Trojans by two points.
"They (the Trojans) played
excellent defense that forced
us out of our offense. Other
than that, our men played one
hell of a game," Card coach
Dick Dißiaso said, wearing a
long, drawn face.
Stanford began its final gal
lant challenge with less than
three minutes remaining and
USC on top, 51-46.
Guard Daryle Morgan hit a
free throw and a clutch driving
layup to cut the margin to two,
51-49, with 2:16 left.

(JSC's Dean Jones then beat
Stanford's fullcourt press for
an apparent breakaway basket,
but missed the easy shot. For
ward Barry Brooks atoned for
his teammate's error with a
steal and a hoop, extending the
Trojans' lead back to four.
Card center Tom Schmal
zried, a stellar offensive per
former in the late second half,
retaliated with a 10-foot jumper
at 1:38.
On USC's ensuing posses
sion, Kimberly Belton fouled
Jones, who missed the front
end of a one-and-one. After an
enormous tussle, Stanford's
Wolfe Perry came up with the
ball, which eventually found its
way to Belton.
The junior forward drove
baseline and hit a fantastic
scoop shot to tie it, 53-53, with
1:06 left.
Trojan Steve Smith's blazing
fast-break lay-in and Morgan's
two perfect free throws kept
the score knotted. USC gained
possession with 0:38 remain
ing and passed the ball around
the perimeter, looking for one

shot.
Paul Giovacchini committed
an almost imperceptible foul
on Jones with 10 seconds left.
Unfortunately for the Cards,
Jones failed to duplicate his
earlier shooting miscues and
hit both charity tosses.
Morgan rushed downcourt
