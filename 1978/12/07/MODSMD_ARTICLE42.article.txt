# It's a New Year's party in Houston
## Champagne and a bang for grid finale 
### IVAN MAISEL 
The biggest New Year's Eve
party west of New York's Time
Square is being thrown in
Houston, and the Stanford
Cardinals are the guests of
honor.
Twentieth-ranked Stanford
meets the seventh-ranked
Georgia Bulldogs in the 20th
annual Bluebonnet Bowl in the
Astrodome on New Year's Eve
in a game that will match the
classic running game of the
Bulldogsagainst the diversified
attack of the Cardinals.
Despite the fact that it will be
Stanford's first game in six
weeks, Cardinal defensive
coordinator Norb Hecker

doesn't feel that the Cards will
get rusty.
"We're looking forward to
it," Hecker said. "It's a chal
lenge to play the seventh
ranked team in the country,
but I'm sure our players will
rise to the occasion."
What the Cardinals have
been doing sincethe Big Came
Nov. 18 is soaking up ac
colades.
Darrin Nelson, Steve Dils,
Ken "Bluebonnet" Margerum,
Gordy Ceresino, Gene Engle,
John Macaulay and Robby
Chapman have all been hon
ored by various all-star squads.
All those plaques and

hosannahs won't help come
kickoff, however. The Cards
resume practice on Dec.l6and
will work for a week and break
for Christmas. The team leaves
for Houston on the 28th.
One aspect of the game that
Stanford is particularly excited
about is the artificial surface.
Stanford only played on the
bogus grass twice this year,
and won both games. The of
fense is licking its chops.
"Astroturf benefits our
backs and our passing game,"
Hecker said. "Darrin likes it,
and the receivers cut on it bet
ter."
Stanford has frequently
been tagged as the best four
loss team in the country. Con
versely, due to a not-so-tough
schedule and some very shaky
wins, Georgia is probably the
worst one-loss team in the na
tion.
Hecker, however, is impre
ssed with the 'Dogs, particu
larly after the come-from
behind victory Saturday
against Georgia Tech. Down
20-0 late in the second quarter,
the Bulldogs fought back for a
late 29-28 win.
"They showed a lot of
character. They didn't panic,"
Hecker said.
Hecker also paid tribute to
the coaching staff. "They did a
heck of a job of halftime ad
justing. That's the mark of a
good football team" he said.
Georgia is 9-1-1 on the year,
with the only blemishes on
their record an early-season
27-10 loss to South Carolina
and a 22-22 tie with Auburn.
That tie, which has been
hooted and howled about from
Atlanta to Plains, occurred
when Georgia scored a
touchdown with 5:18 to play to
pull within one of Auburn,

22-21.
Head coach Vince Dooley
opted to go for one, hoping
that Georgia could get the ball
back in time to drive down and
kick a winning field goal.
Auburn took the ball and ate
up the clock, and thus polished
off the Bulldogs' Sugar Bowl
hopes. The tie cost Georgia a
share of the Southeastern Con
ference crown and the right to
represent the SEC in the New
Orleans bowl classic.
Georgia's starting quarter
back is Jeff Pyburn, a 6-foot-1,
200-pound junior. Pyburn runs
the ball-control attack that
Georgia usually employs.
When the Bulldogs need a
quick offensive pick-me-up,
they turn to freshman signal
caller Buck Belue. Belue rose
to duty in last Saturday's win,
throwing for one touchdown
and directing another TD drive.
The Bulldogs' rushing attack
is led by All-SEC tailback Willie
McClendon, a 6-foot-1, 200-
pound senior. A fast, punish
ing runner, McClendon gained
1312 yards and rushed for 13
touchdowns this season.
Georgia ranks sixth in the
SEC in total defense, yet they
are first in scoring defense,
surrendering only 14.7 points
per game. They bend, but they
don't break.
"They are a solid defensive
team," Hecker said. "They use
an eight-man front, and three
deep backs. They're tough
against the run."

Keying that eight-man line is
senior linebacker Ricky
Mcßride, far and away the lead
ing tackier on the Georgia de
fense.
The leader in the secondary
is sophomore rover Scott
Woerner, who leads the team
in interceptions (4) and punt
returns, including a 72-yard
punt return for a touchdown
against Georgia Tech.
The Bulldog eight-man front
can snap the Southern
wishbone offense in two, but it
can't do much to a passing of
fense but wave when the pas
ses fly overhead.
"They'll have problems with
our pass offense. Everyone
else has, even those who see it
all the time," Hecker said.
The only two teams that pas
sed against Georgia were their
tirst two opponents, Baylor
and Clemson. Though they
won both games (thus handing
eighth-ranked Clemson its
only loss), thatwas way back in
September. Besides, neither of
those teams can pass like a Bill
Walsh offense can.
The folks in Houston, espe
cially those from )immy Carter
country, will be in for some ae
rial fireworks, courtesy of Dils
and friends. Vou can bet that
Stanford's offense will be every
bit as flashy and fiery as any
other fireworks shot off that
Sunday evening.
The only bet safer than that is
that 1979 will debut shortly
after the game is over.
