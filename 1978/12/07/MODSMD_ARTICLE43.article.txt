# New A.D. detects Bowl upsets
## Daily has Geiger-counter 
### 
Groveling on its knees to win favor with
next year's Athletic Department administra
tion, the Daily invited incoming Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger to do our bowl picks.
Geiger, currently the AD at the University
of Penn, plans to attend the Bluebonnet Bowl
New Year's Eve, then return toCalifornia, to
assume department reins. Geiger will replace
retiring )oe Ruetz Jan. 1.
Here is the Philadelphia forecast:
"Imagination and innovation thwarts
Southern Bulldogs. A great night for Dils,
Margerum, Nelson & Co. Happy New Year's.
Stanford 28, Georgia 17.
"USC 24, Michigan 10. Pac-10 continues to
frustrate the Big Ten, but this time it's no
upset.
"Penn State 21, Alabama 17. Penn State,''
ends Nittany Lion neighbor Geiger, "finally
wins the national championship."
